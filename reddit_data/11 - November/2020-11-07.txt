Lol.  Not Biden, but look at the people that control him.  Soros, the extreme left of his party, BLM, Bernie, etc etc.  Biden isn’t making his own decisions.  He’s sold out to the devil. Funny that BLM is already starting to turn on him... that didn’t take long.
I don’t think so, for a whole bunch of reasons. Convinced?
I SAID DO IT AGAIN
Haha I literally just realized this the other day when I started looking at weeklies last week. Never realized how much they can gain when they REALLY PRINT. Gonna start trying it out this week on spy and whatever meme stock comes out next. I usually buy shit that’s like a month out.

I've had TONS of misses these past 8 months, but NIO is one that's gonna haunt me forever. I was trying to get in on it since it was at 11 bucks in June, but for one reason or another, I kept missing out and spending my cash on Tesla. I've made OK money on Tesla, but fuck man, I'd be sitting gravy right now had I just gone with my gut.

Sorry typo (bonds,yield - bond yield*) but yes you are correct. Bond prices are alot higher but with lower yields nobody is buying them and are instead flocking towards equity. How is that not a feds doing? Raising bond prices while lowering yields and forcing investors/funds to buy stocks lol? Even if it isn't the feds actually buying up the stocks it is mainly their qe/debt purchases that is causing this rise.

edit* And it doesn't matter if people/investors are the ones propping this up. As long as yield stays low through the feds, stocks will continue to go up

It’s comforting to imagine the world being manipulated by a small shadowy elite with godlike precision because at least there is someone in control and all bad things come from them.

It’s much scarier to face the truth that the world is chaos, nothing is fair, no one is really in control, and we’re at best hanging on by our fingernails even in the best times.

Can I make predictions as to what will happen next.. We will go back under lockdown around Thanksgiving maybe  December based on the surging numbers of covid this past week and the amount of super spreader parties the left is exhibiting across america(the same left that wanted to burn the MAGA crowd at the stake for protesting lockdowns). Lockdowns will remain in place til after inauguration By February the lockdowns will start easing up and the curve will not only be flattened but covid numbers will go down at a insane rate.. By Easter everything will be back open full capacity all states will open up and biden/Harris will be hailed as Heros who defeated covid in 4months and trump was only raising the numbers in his 8months of pandemic. Thats my God honest prediction Anyone else got predictions feel free to add im open to hear what is possibly going to happen next

Let me list how the last 3 earnings went compared to expectations. Q2 2020 looking for -.98, reported -14.2 EPS  missing by 1300%. Q3 2020 looking for -.80 reported -1.37 EPS missing by 72%. Q4 2020 looking for -3.20 reported -18.6 missing by 480%. 

It's not if they miss earnings, it's how much they'll miss by!  They're expecting -.40 this quarter, I'm willing to bet they miss by more than 200% (-1.2 EPS) Any takers?
I wanted to, then I was glad I didn’t
bet,  thanks a lot for the advice man. much appreciated

I feel you there; while they won’t be at their hay day after transition, I don’t think the markets are leaving. Oil is still used in everything after all. Question will just be how big the market is after that

Also I personally think there will be; it’ll take years to transition and covid shouldn’t last anymore then 5 if history can be trusted

Studies on that showed.. not many. 

Ex. [https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27408)
Influenza isn't as deadly or contagious as covid....so not really.
First, this is a shit place for advice. A couple people with big accounts, most of which are theta gang which is intelligible when you have money already, and a bunch of absolute retards with a few grand Yoloing on options on the small chance they get rich as fuck.

Second, the market is hard as fuck. It won't be consistent. And it doesn't give a shit about your feelings or positions. You or I will never be smart enough to be sure of anything, so if you're gonna do high risk shit, even shares in potential growth companies as opposed to options, be prepared to lose a good chunk of those bets. Diversify accordingly, don't put any money in any high risk position you're not afraid to lose.

Third, you're young as fuck. I have no idea what your finances look like, but you're young enough if you got a chunk of cash the magic of compound interest could still quite work to your favor if you pick good positions and have no need to cash out for years.

Fourth, again you will lose some. Learn your lessons, the market is a bitch. You can't read all these lessons, you have to experience them. Be enraged when a play goes completely against you even though your research was spot on, shit doesn't make sense sometimes. Accept that. But you can't understand it until you lose real money.

Fifth, do your research. Be active. Have a watchlist. Learn some technical analysis. Read. Be open to advice but don't be afraid to make your own decisions.

And finally, PLUG 20c 11/13 mother fucker

Trump was part of the plan and he played it well. People forget that before the 2016 election more and more Americans were tired of politicians and skeptical of the system. They send in a fake populist like Trump and make people beg for a standard politician again. It's brilliant really. Imagine celebrating in the streets because Biden will be your president.

Realistically, the funds will be deposited into my robinhood account just fine. I will overdraft my checking account, but will only be charged a $35 fee and probably expected to repay the overdraft amount. My positions will be allowed to ride to fruition. And I've already made money on those spreads. The difference between my purchasing price and selling price on the SPY options is only a about 20 cents. Cost me about $800 to open that position. Now worth around $1500.

Agreed.
State funding has been in the HEROES Act passed by the House since May
It's not just on democrats.  When Obama was elected McConnell said his most important job was to make him a one term failed president.  That was bad.

Newt Gingrich was the original.  They used to say politicians would fight all day during session and then go get a cocktail as friends and figure it out over some drinks.  Newt put an end to that.

Both sides have a lot of shit to sort out and my hope is that the moderates have had enough of it from the wing nuts, and work toward casting them out.

You can always give the government all of your money. Remember that, you can donate more in taxes whenever you would like. As for me, the government is the worst allocator of capital in ten country. I’ll stick with my money and invest it as I see fit.

Loved joe rogan until lock down! He talks to a lot of interesting and wild if not crazy people. Had to stop at the start of covid tho, he just felt really detached from the rest of world with the lock down. Like C’mon joe, we all don’t have a sonna and personal doctors making house calls. I really should start up again given he’s had the internet’s favourite guest 

It’s been a while since I’ve watched that one so I really only remember him pushing his theory about the astroid impact. I think he’s right there, but I don’t remember his climate believes/how he ties in here

While heartily agree with ya there, but politicians are always looking for physical form to point to with big ideas. It helps on paper make it more digestible, but in current times just leads of creation of narratives to fuel the news cycle. 

To tie all this back to the tread at hand; while global warming maybe questionable for you, I hope green energy isn’t. Biden seemed a big fan of it, so maybe energy and utilities will see some love the next few years. My bets are on $NEE Nextera, so I can’t believe in climate change that hard XD (they own Florida power and lights among other things)
If you lose it within the same tax year, then yes. Worst case is if you gain 1 mil cap gain on Dec 29 2020 and lose it all on Jan 2 2021. You'd be royally fucked.

Probably on battery life. Developing a top tier chip is extremely non trivial. Apple is just using exist ARM designs, doing some improvements and then buying the chips from a fab. Those chips are equivalent to like i3/i5s. Extremely different than creating something close to a i7 or better chip. Also if you're a power user actually needing a beefy machine you also likely have specific software that may never run on arm. But I think the result is Apple can do better in the low end of the market, maybe even a cromebook level machine selling aub 500.
I just want Biden to say “you’re fired” to trump at his inauguration but I know that won’t happen :(

I’m for the masks but the stats and rising cases don’t seem to support that masks are doing any good. However, I’d need more data to make a definitive opinion on the matter. That being said. I’d still error on the side of caution and Trump should’ve done the same.

She is also being hailed as the first female VP, but yeah haven’t heard anything about her being half Asian that’s true, not as good of a boast I guess
I bought calls for the iPhone 12 event before they announced it.  I only knew it was going to be in October so I bought them in September when everything started dropping. Then doubled and tripled down when it kept dropping. If I had bought a few days before the event, I woulda had a 600% gain but I had to make up an 80% loss so it only ended up being like 40% gain
you bought at the top huh lmao
Why. 
Also, why WSB?  Are you a bear?

Agreed. The index gains 46% in 4 years on average - that's in one presidential term. Shorting is going against odds.

If interest rate is low, stock tends to gain more, stocks compete with bonds. Fed made it very clear they will keep zero interest rate for years. They don't have a choice when the economy is so weak and there is so much debt everywhere. 27T is a big number.

After 100 years, many people on Wall Street still don't understand these basic things.

It's hilarious to me that nobody thought to just find another decent hotel in town and quietly side-step what Trump said. Instead they made it way worse by hosting it in the parking lot of a similarly named landscaping company next to a fucking sex shop.
I'm back retards. I probably would have lost all my emotional money had I stuck around the last few months. Lucky for me I didn't and can now lose it over the next couple months.

Why Donnie being so quiet?
Lmao inverse these retards, gonna be so green i have to buy back all my damn calls I sold now gg
The real MVP
No problem with masks although they don’t seem to be stopping the spread (based on the charts). In fact, had Trump’s dumbass embraced the mask, he might still be President.
JPOW's term ends in 2028. Plenty of time for tendies. We'll all be broke by then anyway.

You mean he didn't get those millions of MAGABucks from his followers? What a shame.
It’s the 10th right? Looks like I’ll once again buy weeklies. At least I won’t be buying calls early and risk a massive loss because I bought too early
I know, but your post discusses buying calls so I figure I would at least post to warn someone about riding calls with insane IV through earnings on NIO. The Risk to Reward is at about an 8/10 on the degenerate scale

There is not going to be a shit show or any big drops in the Market. Dumbass people posting dumbshit. If your smart look at the past 15 years of the market. Yea spy puts are the real winners LMAO.  Market will always continue to grow. Of course we have some red days but damn spy puts.... you better make sure you time it. Ain't the same idiots said spy puts last week and the market was greener than green.  Put that spy put money in clean energy, EV and weed stocks. Leave it there for a bit and look back at your investment.  Realist here.

Republicans need to pass the stimulus to win the runoff elections in Georgia.

The state just swung blue and the Dems are gonna throw every once of their power at it so the Republicans don't want to get wrapped up as stimulus blockers. My bet is that it passes very quickly....1-2 weeks they will have a package together. 

Donny is the wildcard now, not the Senate.
Supposed leaked benchmarks showed 20-25% Improvement
Good luck, in doubtful
Sounds like a man that can get the job done.
Yes, on Friday someone on WSB mentioned they are reversing their trend for the day and it dumped 5 more percent shortly after.
Fuckwits that think Dems hate the military. They hate sending soldiers to places, but they don’t mind selling weaponry. Look at Lockheed, Boeing, and Raytheon stock before and after Obama. Liberal presidents= brrrrrttt
There’s a ton of disputed evidence over climate change. Why it’s happening, what’s causing it. I know it might come off has “bro science” because it’s from The Joe Rogan Experience, but he had [this scientist](https://youtu.be/G0Cp7DrvNLQ) on and while it’s a little outdated, he makes some really compelling arguments, he’s a smart, sensible guy. As far as Greta goes I guess I should cut her some slack. It is a good representation of the future generation being concerned rather than older folks that will be dead in 20 years. I just don’t like how she’s been turned into this political icon rather than actually being focused on the science at hand

NIO reacts very well to good news, idk if it'll sustain its price after an ER pump but i definitely think a good ER will give it a temporary spike.

And bro I'm selling puts, all I get is a fat premium from some retard and shares if I'm assigned. No yachts for theta gang

He doesn't. I promise.

He meant to say buy calls... pussy.

I think the election drama was better for bulls because it kept new daily coronavirus records and lockdown news off the headlines
And the facts are that you have convinced yourself to resent everyone who has money, which must be from an immoral source (apartheid or whatever), or must be from parents (classism), basically blaming everything but yourself, and refusing to take responsibility for your own life and financial success or insuccess?

Fuck no you're not in the wrong. Glad you caught this early. Soon he'll start applying lines of credit under your name.
Trump would’ve let the pandemic get worse to the point the markets would tank. Biden is going to slow it down probably but at least we don’t all fucking die and might see an end to it in the coming months. Everyone is already basically quarantined in the winter anyway I don’t see why that and biden combined can’t end it
Trump isn't exactly a legal mastermind. He blew up a lot of his court cases the last 4 years by saying things on Twitter contrary to what his lawyers were arguing in court.

He sues a lot, but he's not very good at it
Expiring that day

Pretty much
idk what's up Tendies' ass, but congrats man. that's awesome.
he probably needed some money to yolo on calls at Monday open after getting wiped out this week

Their earnings will be good, but will it have enough to justify a 100% gain in 1 month, like 400% from their last earnings?? That is what I am thinking

They need a true monster earnings beat and insane guidance short term (meaning news that will generate income in the very short term) to justify the insane price move, otherwise they are going to have a hard time "pumping" 

Their last consolidation was $25-30, I don't think they would drop that quickly, but look at fucking FSLY, OSTK, and even TSLA. Both fairly good earnings but not enough to justify the price of the stock in the near term without any true sideways trading to really reaffirm a price floor. If you hold shares no biggie, but calls is like the most degenerate gambling after a 100% underlying move going into earnings, LOL

May the tendie gods prove me wrong and will you take me for a ride on your yacht if you are right?

I’m sorry I don’t follow? I thought the majority of non corporate backed climate scientists said it was getting worse and the cause was increased CO2. Like you can’t say that every exhaust on plant Earth running for 100 years wouldn’t be the same as a super volcano going for 10. I honestly figure she was made the face as an appeal to pathos, since she’s gonna have to actually live with the shit longer then most in power

Also to build off this; what’s being in high school matter? A boy scout in high school built a nuclear reactor, a girl and boy built a A machine to turn sound into kinetic energy, Newton was barley in his twenties. Some people just find their passions faster, doesn’t mean they are of any less value

I don’t mean to pick apart your argument against her, because I agree she’s a poor fit, but your reasons don’t fully make since to me.

I don’t think lack of ability to invest in a company is reason to invest in a crappy one. Epstein the analyst made all his waves claiming that SPCE would be able to provide fast earthbound transport, when all they have is a shitty plane that carried basically nothing and crashes a lot. Branson even stated that transport isn’t even on the horizon for them. To think that the market won’t be entirely dominated by SpaceX, whose starship can hold 100 people and will actually work, or Blue Origin, who have limitless funds, is absurd. Even if they started now, which they don’t have the capital to do, they are about 20 years away from that goal by which time the market is saturated by far superior products.
That’s what happened to me.  Parents got money.  Didn’t qualify for shit. And they didn’t pay for shit.

Yeah I feel like this is pump n dump territory.
how can both bonds and yields be devalued if they move in opposite directions by definition. how can the fed devalue bonds if its buying them? And wouldn't a smaller supply of bonds in the market cause the price to go up all other things equal? all the Fed is doing is yield control, and in fact they want them to stay low. but equities and commodities going up is not the Fed's doing at all
[deleted]
It works a bit for me. My portfolio isn’t that big so it sucks when I have to fomo out for some gains for another play or risk holding to gain more of the spread value.

I do vertical spreads to buy a in the money or at the money leg, protects me slightly from no reaction or move up. Less loss for a leg down.

I do horizontal spreads if iv is high and I don’t mind holding longer term. If they die, my short is worthless and usually things recover in 2-4 weeks. If they destroy I roll up or roll out, expecting some profit taking or pull back.
So this will be decided when? I’m looking it says Jan 5th, is that correct?
I know it’s you, Jeff.
I commute to campus so my cost is half--just tuition, but luckily I qualify for fin aid so my debt so far is less than 10K. Hopefully I can graduate next year and be done.

Throw in a monthly shower and you’ll even start to make friends out of the deal
Trump is going to come out and tank the market next week.  A classic “I Told you so” move.  SPY puts 11/20 expiration will print big.  SPY 300 by 12/31/20 once everyone realizes what really just happened.  Good luck and go short.

There is no sign it will be. Check OP's post history. This retard bought puts and is hoping they pay out. OP is a house pet turd burglar and is shit posting in the hopes people will fuck up like him.
Bro I was just blasting this, let’s go
Trump is called mango as he resembles the look 😊
It'll be worth it to him just to keep seeing himself in the news.
Yeah, this time they have had a face ripping rally and are sitting well past all time highs, with no period of meaningful consolidation.

No way it can go tits up. I guess there is still several days until earnings but if they dont get some real consolidation I would definitely sell or trim heavily before ER and buy back on the next day, or pre-market.
how far out do you typically look to play?
I question your assumptions
Didn't even know you could book a landscaping shop parking lot. Incredible.

You still got 400.  Yolo it on 2 OTM Jan 21 Spce Calls for 21/23.  Sell one in run up to test flight one after in late Nov.
At least you got time, on the other hand better get started working the corner

Why do you need a loan? We all made money off of NIO, SQ, and ACB last week. Don’t tell me you weren’t retarded enough to get in on those!
No sauce. Fake news.  
  
But... Biden is a hawk and we probably need that.
11/13 320c FD's are at 1.02 - I think this goes up but there's not a lot of margin for profit there unless it absolutely moons. 12/11 300c is @ 13.30 - breakeven of 313. I think that could likely print but the risk/reward isn't there. I love BABA but the vig on the options is stupid right now.
Regardless of how much clothes or houses they buy, the number of hair stylists they employ, etc... the rich hoard most of their wealth.
That was Nancy pelosi not allowing it. My understanding she with held it until November holiday seasons spending with Black Friday and thanksgiving/Christmas shopping to keep market valuation up
Drench that shit in sauce
Now that Trump is no longer president I can start flossing again.

Everyone gonna jump on cannabis stocks this week.
The Dems forced a game 6 in the 2 GA races. If they win both, they advance.
Both of Georgia's senate seats are going to have runoff elections because neither had a candidate get 50% of the vote.  As a weird coincidence, both Republicans were involved in liquidating stock positions before telling us about covid.

Could end up split evenly.  In which case VP is the tiebreaker.

The little pimp thread?
This isn't a "sell the news" situation.

This is the beginning of 4 years of money flowing into specific sectors. 

A lot of us are posting bullish comments because we're holding positions in those sectors.

The overall market might drop (who knows), but weed, clean energy, Chinese companies, medicare based companies, etc, are going to print because 4 years has definitely not been priced in.
I’m holding 340 puts
Please do tell, what exactly are they trying to do to destroy the country?
I work with physicians and all of them supported Trump. Most were laughing at the left. Keep telling yourself we are the “anti intellectuals.”
Doesnt matter, the world knows 🥭 lost and thinks this takes off pressure from shit with china

i've  heard a ton of insane fairy-tail success stories here though is that just the minority

11/20 18c. Timing is important so wait for a dip. It’s unlikely she goes up all day but in the event that happens it’s just too late lol. Better to sit out than chase. I’m looking to sell most either Wednesday or Thursday before earnings. If it runs up an insane amount before then I’ll start taking profit before then. If it drops below hard support of 11 I’m out but I really think she could go parabolic this week 20+

And while the feelings of the poor buildings and statues mean a lot to me, the score is 3-1 in favor of MAGA people for most protestors murdered at peaceful rallies during Trump's presidency.

The FBI also just had to break up a right wing plot to abduct, torture, and execute the democratic governor of Michigan. 

I can do this all day.  If you ever think, "my political party never behaves badly" then you're a fucking idiot.
No man with a 178k salary chooses to live with his parents.
Oh I have no doubt that she is very knowledgeable and that Asperger’s works to her benefit in that area. I’m just saying she’s a high school-aged kid and even the most well-respected climate scientists really don’t know what’s going on.

I’m guessing you don’t know what Asperger is? (This is horribly simplified but) It’s the “better” side of the Autism Spectrum, more on the side with Einstein. I’m not saying the girl has the answers, but I’m willing to bet she’s very well read in topic. 

To dive deeper, psychologist are unsure why, but autistic individual latch onto single or just a handful of subject and learn everything they can. Depending on her personal case, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect her to know how much CO2 the average car in her city puts out a day. I say it’s not unreasonable because my cousin, whom also has it, can tell you exactly how much coal you need for a train if you give him the passenger count, and how many bags each brought on.

Edit; I don’t think she should be the face, and her parents are horrible for pushing it if they are, but I wanted to add some understand as to why she probably started
That's why GA flipped. 

You can watch Dukes of Hazzard to see how they get cars across rivers now.
355c is overly optimistic

In 2019 BABA went down as a result of 11/11 even though they had the highest gross ever. Chinese spend 38 BILLION US Dollars on 11/11 just on BABA, and stock retreated by \~2% in the following days. Though granted, it added about \~7.5% to the 11/11 value by the time the options expired.

Still nowhere near your \~19% prediction needed for a break-even.

I am with GeorgeHarris420 on this one, 285 puts a a better choice for ez mony
Does kim know his friend 🥭 lost yet?
I believe they will hold strong do to not wanting to watch it run up another 20% and then having to buy back in at such a high price. Lol I love that “an analyst is working on it as we speak” that got me but I saw some pretty massive calls coming in eod Friday. Them releasing news about a European company reserving 30k units of the EC7 that isn’t even out yet may push towards that good guidance for the future. If the chatter is true then I think a GS price upgrade this week followed by some overbought speculation they will come out with in a month to buy more shares which they have done a thousand times. NIO TENDIES FOR THE WIN
And trump has to pay the cost of a recount which will run in the millions.  Kind of a dumb way to burn cash

I’m sure as shit going to call out the bull shit of a person who ran on our social health and safety of a virus when his rally is full of people who are not social distincing and don’t have their masks on. Utter and total bullshit Joe tell them to get the fuck in their cars and put their mask on or you do nothing but validate Trumps supporters statement that it’s a hoax.

Depending on the volume call your broker and have them sell 2-4% of the daily volume throughout the day until your position is fully gone. It'll cost about 100-150 dollars at most but not destroy the market.

You actually lost 99.75%

This is the way
There's a legend...
I'm not saying it is. I've just never traded such large amounts before. I usually just click sell at market price and I lose some money. For example if the stock is at $100, the automatic sell usually sells it at like $99 or $98 and I lose a few thousand in the sense I could have probably made more but I don't know how.

So if lose a dollar on 40,000 stocks... that's a lot of money for me. So I was wondering if there's a better way to do it. Like selling directly to an institution or something or where to hire someone to sell it for me

yes, you're wrong. You don't seem to understand how taxes works.

Hint: you only pay taxes on profit after expenses, so changing an owners tax rate won't effect his ability to pay his employees, cause he's only taxed on money he's already chosen to take out of the business and not pay to employees or reinvest in the business. Raising his taxes actually compels him to grow the business instead of maxing short term personal profit.

Nah man, you'd be leaving more money on the table for less money while you're probably in the prime time of your life to be working (though Im only assuming your age). I'm not saying don't have a life, I'm saying accomplish more and find time to still do what you love. And sleep less you little bitch. You're not talking about an extra 20k you're talking double the money. For me it may be different because I can technically make my own schedule, but overall I think spending a few years focusing on money could help you eventually do more of what you love, not less. Everything takes some sacrifice

Set a limit sell of x amount of shares at a certain price. When the stock hits the price, it will sell. 

Or sell covered calls against the stock, if the stock price rises you keep premium and sell for strike
Price.’ If the stock doesn’t go up, more covered calls to sell. Or sell deep in the money covered calls

I mean ppl treated Trump as president elect when the major networks called for him in 2016.

Clinton called and conceded. Everyone called Trump. Obama did too and they had those transition meetings etc etc.

Funny enough I don't see POTUS doing this anytime soon and probably will begrudgingly do it once the results for battleground states are certified heh.
There are a few outside the Philly convention center in the same bizarre protest as other cities, but its woefully small.
Tough to say. I want to say yes but I believe it is a little inflated. If stock holders hold strong then yes i can easily see a run up. And so far, NIO holders have diamond hands. It is common for NIO to dip, recover, and trade sideways or up. Thats a good sign.

And I expect GS to upgrade it within a month, I'm sure an analyst is working on it as we speak

Need advice on how to sell roughly $2 million dollars worth of stock (Roughly 40,000 shares).

I was an early member of what is now a multi-billion dollar company and have absolutely no clue how to sell such large amounts. Any tips on how to hire someone or something to help me with this? Edit: Like do I call a morgan stanley bank or something and ask for someone to help me sell a large volume of stocks?

I don't know anything really about stocks. I just mainly put money into FANG and Vanguard S&P 500 index fund. When I sell, I just click sell at market price.

Edit: yes, I know this isn't special. I've just never sold this much stock before and clicking sell at market price seems like I would lose out on a lot of money

Edit 2: I don't have a broker...I think. It's just stored in a bank trading account my company made for me years ago
Shambles
Printing money/money printer in a not a literal term. I mostly mean it as a slang that identifies devaluing bonds, yields, and the dollar causing equities and commodities to go up. So yes keep the market up and keep it running.

Brought this up a while ago, but I wonder if they're going to revert the WSB Kid back to his former bald glory.
I love these. I have a standard strategy.


-Get excited about the idea of working with them.

- Ask what a good starting dollar amount would be, mention that you're thinking about 300-500k.

-Start talking about the various GME dates and strikes im going to buy with their investment once they send me the money

-Ignore any corrections they try to make and just keep talking about my existing gamestop investments and how much I'm going to make them once they get me the money until they stop responding.



I should direct them to a stock that would lose them money, but I love gamestop and can't help but talk about it

No, but the 74 MILLION people who voted for him DOES make him President. Put on your big boy pants and accept the truth... Or don't. Either way Biden will be the 46th President of the United States.
i wasnt thinking to hold through earnings.

why the lower strike ?
Capital gains hits at 50k
I’ve been here for months
The problem was he didn't really act on 'America First'. He acted on 'America Alone'.

I don't mind the concept of focusing on America First, but he didn't do that. In fact he spent the entire time constantly driving a wedge in America and inflaming the existing political, social, and cultural issues within. He alienated allies and cozied up to dictators which doesn't align with America's interests or priorities.

He vilified globalism -- the opposite of that isn't self-sufficiency, it's isolationism. That doesn't help America, it hurts it.
Lol. You are so desperate to imagine trump supporters crying like you guys were in 2016. I’m honestly completely ok with Biden and thought he gave an awesome speech tonight. 

You should probably try to move on with your life. Congrats on the win you guys deserve it.

Alright you heard the man.  Let the survivor style voting begin.
Are your expectations a run up prior to earnings? I agree with you though on everything especially since any big news that’s come out is followed by a price target. There is just one group in particular that still has their target at 7$ who I want to see an upgrade from and there has been chatter that they have been accumulating more shares throughout the month which we will see if it’s true on 11/17(Goldman) right now I think they are at 7% and I’ve heard they have almost doubled their position. Only time will tell. China still coming out with more news about the zero emissions by 2060 just shows that big time investors will be in this. I can see a small bump up the next 3 days followed by a 12% day on Thursday then red Friday for this week. GOOD LUCK
May the gains be forever in your favor, internet stranger 💪👐✊

Consumerism links products to the irrational forces in the subconscious mind. This has generally shaped our economics model over the last 100 years or so. Need-based has become desire-based.
so where are we going to peaceful protest come january? syria or iran?
I’m thinking  Spy 400-500

Dow 30,000-3400

Nasdaq is tricky not sure. 

Markets do better under Dems everyone knows it. Biden market going to be smooth like butter.
But she has a point
For real. I tell myself I’d stop but I’ve actually been on a good streak.
so we just gonna spend every 4 years reversing the previous president policies indefinitely while China is roaring ahead.   We are truly retarded...lol

well you sound like a retard thinking you got life figured out by gambling an important trust fund. Even more retarded that you want to trust strangers for tickers without research. At WSB no less, instead of the other safer places to learn.

Yea itd be terrible, thankfully your representatives and senators make all their money from insider trading so it'll never pass.
Agreed
won't pass. even if they win the two georgia seats, joe manchin or other conservative dems won't vote for it

Bro this is the exact call i was going for. What do you know
buy puts???? is this the way of life????
23c and sell Wednesday

Better buy puts and show us your position.  Put your dick/money where your mouth is.
I .. must .. resist .. buying .. into .. an .. er .. again.
I gotta admit that I haven't even considered a single transaction since the market was mooning Tuesday
I'm just wondering what you're implying. That his economy was because of the crash?
Still have 🥭 for another 3 months. He will make sure to make it volatile in the markets during this time
fucking pumpers eh
The expectation is so low that it won’t matter. It’s the perceived value that is important. Weed stonks (stinks) will be going up slowly for months. Retail investors love that shit. How many stoners are looking for a reason to dump money into it? Huge perceived growth potential.

Can’t lose their job like the furnace guy I got fired for blowing up on me over a fuck trump 2020 magnet on my fridge.

Edit: he locked my backdraft valve closed so exhaust would build up in my house, another tech came out to check his work because I didn’t feel I could trust it and he pointed it out. Now I can’t move with charges because he claimed it was a “accidental oversight” but I record his ranting with my phone while I just saying okay I’m sorry that offended you. All that shit was why he was fired.
Obama took office shortly after a collapse. Biden is taking office at the end of a very long bull run. Your comparison isn't fair to Joe.

Anyone think GME to the moon? Like 2006 when PS3 came out it soared to $65 from $5. I think 2013 PS4 came out and it went from $10 to $60. PS5 is coming out and covid, everybody is sitting at home they want that fucking PS5 and Sony is going to give it to them motherfuckers. I’m holding 8 30c 1/15

Common now, her iq is slightly above average, but not enough to be considered bright. Diversity picks are great for vp, but aren't viable for president
She literally blew her way to the top! 🤣🤣🤣
With the prenup you know she had to sign you know she’s just end up with a place to live and a credit card with a limit.
i already have spy puts as a hedge. but im thinking we gap up for a little bit
I can’t help but to read this as you HOPE the market crashes so you can make money on puts.

Not to mention this is happening at moon evaluations of companies.
don't forget to tip her
Gap up coming Monday-Tuesday then get out by Wednesday

do you know which assets? do you think they are buying Tesla lol? They are swaping treasurys for bank reserves, and currently banks are not lending significantly against those reserves, so money is not being printed. But since you believe the Fed is printing, its keeping the market from crashing. You are keeping markets from crashing, not the Fed xD

The biggest Trump fanboy I know was sitting in his front yard drinking all day today. Bigly sad.
Sorry man, I get what you're saying but if you look at the random numbers without context then you might as well just use astrology.

Do you know what exponential and linear growth is? Do you know that alot of the deaths you are comparing to are not contagious? Do you know what extent the world had to do in order to even TRY and contain this virus? (rampant mask wearing, lockdowns, stimulus etc) ?

Theres a reason there are actual places on earth right now like Japan and South Korea and New Zealand who are chilling because they actually have a population with brains.

Not only that, but do you know what excess deaths are? So all of a sudden covid doesnt matter because people die from heart attacks? Like jesus
That was my thought few minutes ago.

Biden is very old school middle of the road catholic politician who has worked with republicans across the aisle on multiple bills. I find it hilarious that Trump supporters don't even like him.

Exactly. We have run too fast too far and on a news which was basically supposed to priced in for months due to the polls. Biden was supposed to win this. It's not a miracle. Sure, we might not see 300 again. But I thought it was really reasonable to expect a 340 dip by next week when I entered the play. Let's see.
um, how do i say this, some Australian reds and Columbian whites.
We are absolutely going to FLY on Monday.

It’s not a full understanding of the situation. Trump tweeted his agreement with pelosi but Trump himself was not involved in negotiations. Steve Mnuchin was in charge of negotiations and if Trump wanted the pelosi deal he could have told Mnuchin to agree to it. But Mnuchin had disagreements with the bill and senate republicans also disagreed with the bill. Basically trump lied through Twitter to his audience and if it was everything pelosi wanted it would have been a political win for her to show her strength as a negotiator. But really he was not involved and Mnuchin and Meadows were in control of the negotiations

How free are you when the market opens? general pattern is the first hour of the day. Don't buy at face value.   
Wait till 9:35 am before buying, so you know how much the gamble is in options.   


Then set price limit so that you get a good price and not fomo.  
If you feel like luck's on your side, I'd recommend the 45C 11/13 for $1 or lower, depending on PM price. Yolo.  
If you feel like a a super retard, the 50C 11/13 for $.25. Yolo.

Yeah. I was researching institutional investors last night. They hold about 35% of all shares right now, and that number is decreasing steadily. Smart money is betting on NIO at an unrelenting pace.
Fine. In terms of stocks it only matters what the markets believe. Markets believe biden won. Recounts don’t change anything unless your talking less than a 2000vote difference in a sing battle ground .
I don't care who won, Biden winning made me a shit ton of money; However, people can disagree with both... I know your chimp brain might not understand nuance or that people can have non-black and white opinions but I'll try to explain. They both serve the interests of others, not the people.

There's always a dropoff of folks that only vote for Pres but don't vote down ticket.  Here's Ga's results.  Trump and David Perdue got almost the same amount of votes, but Perdue's opponent Ossoff got 100K less than Biden.  Most likely that's concentrated in the N Atlanta Suburbs, which is where most of the flip/anti-Trump votes came from.

That question itself is stupid.  There is no right answer, only an opinion that needs a paragraph to explain. 

And it needs a time horizon and some background in order to make the right call.  If you are speculating on a 1 week move, the only equity listed with the vol needed to time a jump IS Tesla.

If you believe the bear case, I don't want to own any of those fucking stocks.

And if you are investing really long equities right now among those choices you are a true idiot.  When 5% moves happen on a daily basis, you are not in a long "set it and forget it" market.  You are in a bear "rip your face off" market.

**Yes, I am. Suck my fucking cock.**
Sorry man, I get what you’re saying but if you look at the data it says everyone is over reacting. If you look at COVID-19 deaths worldwide and compare and contrast it to other illnesses and causes of death the hype and actions taken in the name of this virus aren’t warranted. If you take the annual death rate of the world, it’s around 60Million per year, COVID-19 deaths worldwide are 1.25Million. This would mean that COVID-19 even if you take the official numbers (which IMO are overstated) would only make up 2% of global deaths. It’s an insignificant amount compared to the real major causes of death. There is a reason the media doesn’t compare and contrast COVID-19 deaths against other causes of death. It doesn’t fit the narrative.
Ahh yes the guy that locked up kids and separated them from their parents is alright by you. That's why people are celebrating cause we're not gonna be dealing with shit like that, ignored by the people that are pro-life and "all lives matter". You're incredibly dense for not seeing that.

TLDR your prof is right in general principles but wrong in reality and that is something you can easily prove by running corr of those stocks vs Apple and Tesla and showing Tesla is as and maybe more diversifying. Don’t let anyone tell you you aren’t a savant. Longer analysis below.

On vanilla first principles your prof is right in that Apple is growth + different industry vs those value stocks in banking and automotive.
However, I think you could argue that:
1) Tesla like Apple is a growth stock but unlike Apple it isn’t in any of the indices Ford and gm and bac are in, and just from that has independent movement. It also does move independently. 
2) You could further argue that while it’s technically auto industry it’s also green + tech, and those dominate its historical movements, and that auto is a questionable sector assignment to it on this basis. 
3) it is just as economically sensitive as Apple. 
4) Lastly Apple is nearing max size it can be while tesla has theoretical max growth ahead, making it much more a growth stock. 

In summary - It’s not obvious that Tesla has less diversification potential... so this is really a coin flip. 

I ran a correlation calc to check the real world truth since it appears diversification isn’t a goal. Both Apple and Tesla have a .91 corr with each other but a -.3 with gm over a 4 year period. They are both highly diversifying.

But... 

Bac has more correlation with Apple than Tesla

Ford is negatively correlated with both Apple and Tesla but less correlated with Apple slightly. 

In other words, empirically, Tesla and Apple greatly diversify you, and are together highly correlated, but Tesla may diversify you slightly more depending on the allocations of the starting portfolio, namely if it is BAC heavy

Go get those points back bro/sis

You’ve obviously never heard of a wash sale. Don’t quit your day job.
After you put your dad into 80k of debt, your going to give him bad stock advice. When he loses that last 20k buying a MEMe stock at ATH and can’t afford a Kia let alone a BMW. Hope he beats your ass. 

Never give or take stock advice from a re- tard
they are jacked to the tits with calls from friday because they fomoed, and now its all confirmation bias so they can sleep tonight

Way ahead of u baby boo 😘

People will downvote you to the ground but forget feelings for a second and look at economic policy. Trump was good for markets, thats just common sense. Biden will juice the shit out of markets with stimmy but thats short lived. Do some research into his tax plan. Look what Elizabeth Warren will do if she is treasury secretary. Feelings do not enter into the convo. Lower corporate taxes means higher bottom line for corporations and can someone remind me what happens when big companies make money??? Stonks go up. Lower capital gains rates means what again?? Stonks go up. Ok /endrant my bad

I'm a 2A lib. I carried every day in HS (90's inner city schools were rough) and then never did for 30 years. Last year I got my CCW and started up again because Republicans harbor and encourage KKK\\neo-Nazi fuckers openly out here in flyoverville. I won't try to convince them to consider their own safety, only be at the ready to put them down if they encroach on my own. R's should take heed of my post as many of us D's are just as blood thirsty as they are. 

Things I like: Building AKs\\ARs, 3rd Gen S&W's (10MM preferred), Glocks from 80% lowers, PTRs\\MP5's.
Can someone explain why everyone is so bullish for Monday?
Ivanka and Tucker Carlson. Or, if Trump name gets old it might be Josh Hawley and Nikki Haley Ticket.
This man has to read of a teleprompter and have people talking in his earpiece and he still butchers his speeches. If he has a brain it’s probably shriveled up or liquid or something

The top has been here for over a month.  It takes a while for the smart money to really tie that bag on retail tight enough that they can't escape.
Glad it helped, picking the right expiration is always tricky, but this felt like a short term play, so glad you didn’t have to pile as much capital on this and still get the exposure you wanted.

I had a few MJ 1/15/21 $12 calls that I sold for a 50% profit. Was a bit early on my entry, but still feels good! Will probably see a bigger bounce on Monday, but I’m going to sell the news because the Senate is not likely to do much on MJ. Decriminalization is popular, so could still see if getting done, but I’m anticipating a pull back once folks process that we didn’t have a blue wave and that we may not see much legislation on MJ come through. Feels like a good time to take some profits and risk off the table. May be able to get another entry if the above happens, and it feels like there may be a big enough desire from moderate R’s to do something on MJ. 

Also still medium to long-term bullish on US MSO (TCNNF and GTBIF in particular because they have the most disciplined management imo). Ofc they could run into the same issues as Canadian producers like ACB and CGC, but the US is a much larger market, so could play out differently! Could still see a short-term bounce and pull back though.

Could be wrong about thoughts above, but figured I’d share. Cheers and hope you’re having a good one!

Literally not one person I’ve seen thinks their life gets better instantly because of Biden. Part of what The president does is serve as a symbol of the American people. We wanted a different symbol. Simple as that.
Thats one thing but I believe he stretched it too far. My guess is he marked down the value of his assets for taxes and marked them back up for loans. I can see him doing that. We'll see what the actual facts say

Also, I bought my options on Monday; 25 of them, betting that Biden would win, along with ipo release & IV continues to rise towards 11/11

Since then I’ve had to average down to $1.5, my initial calls being bought around $4 (baba was trading around 315 & had 20% more IV then now)

don't mean to sound like an asshat, but do you have a source on this?

Even still, those R's may not be inclined to vote given that their main gripe seemed to be with Trump

My belief is that the dems will get the surge of increased voters and the republicans will be pretty apathetic. Although, all the sjw victory screeching recently has probably pissed off quite a few republicans

Truth hurts, doesn’t it.  Blinded by the same forces that convinced you to vote against your own interests.  As someone rich and contented it is fun (albeit a little sad) to watch.
Ever since I started trading options I’ve been using calls and puts on my relationships with people. For example, if I get into an argument with one of my friends, puts on the relationship. If I have a nice hangout, calls. If I don’t know if they’re mad at me or not, that’s a straddle.

OP is f-ing retarded. The next two years could be really bad. (I don't care who is president)

Let's see, George W. sees a 50% decline during his term and then the next President moons. So this historic run is the result of what happened before it. And what happened to George W. can be partially attributable to the historic run that happened before him under Clinton. 

What the f is wrong with your thinking?

In scenarios where a Democrat is in the White House but Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress, average returns for U.S. equities have been fantastic, with the S&P 500 rising an average of 33.9% during these periods since 1989.

Biden is a boring corporate democrat like Obama who appeals to many people. Many people liked Obama, so they voted for Biden, who is a familiar face and has similar policies. It’s pretty obvious why Biden was voted in (I’m saying this as a Bernie supporter who fully supports Biden now).

One of many articles on the topic. It boils down to "it will be easier for us to take over if the president is unfit for duty"
"it is not about trump"
"its for the future"
Who else is over 70? 
Who else is possibly going to be president  and has health concerns? Who would benefit the Democrats if they replaced him?

Got a name?
Guess Biden? Ding Ding Ding. We have Bingo.

Biden isn't  left or liberal  enough for the majority of the democratic party backing him. But guess who is? The psychotic VP. She wants a ton of change and will swing wildly  at anything. 

Easy PZ stick Biden in office because he's more likable  and an easy win and satisfied more voters.

Swap Biden With Harris. Socialism complete. Next stop Communism.

This is in essence their younger ethnic Hillary Clinton.
Nah.  She put them all in jail.  They hate her
Your conclusion is flawed. Each of those factors you named is absolutely bad for stonks. But if the pattern we've seen holds true, put all those factors together and it's clear that it's good for stonks.

Most of you hate Trump more than how much I like the guy. Thats what some of you dont understand. For me I voted for him but its okay if he lost. I dont mind Biden and I will continue with my life like always. But for some of you Trump winning again would mean you constantly batching and acting like your life is miserable.

It’s not Biden’s style. If anything, I’d expect Biden to offer impunity in exchange for a concession and a peaceful transition—one which allows the next chapter to begin without dragging this out further.

However, just as the former isn’t Biden’s style, the latter isn’t Trump’s. Regardless, I would be shocked if Trump faced criminal prosecution that put him behind bars, despite recent reports that NY‘s Southern District court is planning on such.

Well, for one, a lot of people prefer Pence over Trump because anyone is better than that idiot. And despite the obesity, Mango is pretty hale. He’ll be one of those people who live like shit but still survive till 90. I think it’s the lack of guilt and shame. Joe’s had a very hard life, and it shows on him.

lol okay, tell that to everyone who knows someone it killed. I hope it gets all those dumb fucks next.
They would need to remove the filibuster. Which if they do would make votes only simple majorities. Biden wants to compromise not do this. It will remain divided because GOP will run on that.

That's awfully specific ngl

Edit: truth hurts you downvoting fucks, doesn't it?
When you buy puts as a hedge in your head you should expect to lose the premium and even hope for it. If I take 5% portfolio value on SPY puts sure it will print if market tanks but I am ok with the PUTS expiring worthless because it means the other 95% went up. If you are just playing PUTS because your gut tells you to you will be wrong 89% of the time as thats how often markets go up.
Haha sure bro, I'm sure you are a full time trader too.
How we feeling about gold/silver post election?
Agree. Not letting republicans near the ballots to inspect them was definitely suspect
oh they'll go lower lol
It's tough not to be bullish at this point in the year.  Santa Clause rally, stimulus, vaccines, etc. So many reasons the market can run hard at the end of the year.

Isn't senate run off in January so by the time it happened it will already apply to 2021 taxes. So basically you have to sell in 2020 to be risk adverse and buy back in post January election results?
Nah I think there is something there but because he took advantage of the loophole Obama implemented by the time they found it he was already running for president. We'll see if anything happens to him though

Bullshit! My Hal puts about to pay! But...Trump just fired his FERC chairman and replaced him with James Danly a former attorney for Exelon and NextEra Energy; wouldn't doubt some last minute sweetheart deals...Thinking about buying calls on NextEra Monday. Thoughts?
It is very hard to give advice because I am betting the market goes much higher and I am positioned to run higher or buy the dip.   

Let's see how Monday starts off.   My gut tells me Trump has enough information to contest the election. He will not win but he can cause problems and maybe the market has an excuse to sell off.   The only reason we sell off is because we have run too far too fast.
“And my button works”
True but I feel like the same thing happen to have Biden win the primary over Bernie

I bought 2500 of them. I can hold them forever if I need to. You never know.
Honestly I think you could throw it in now, hope there is no downturn and if there is, it would go up after January anyways. Basically you're losing on gains because you want to time the market and hope it goes down. Experience has shown the last few months thats not s great idea.

MIK has earnings in a month. They are super low right now. I am almost certain they will pop from $8 to $13 on earnings.  Check out KIRK or BBBY for confirmation bias.

Biden is very old school middle of the road catholic politician who has worked with republicans across the aisle on multiple bills. I find it hilarious that Trump supporters don't even like him. Imagine if we had a crazy squad member win instead? Joe is someone republicans should be happy they got compared to the left crazies that were available.

You poor thing.  Name one thing he did that is jail-able and provide any supporting primary documents.  Meantime, you dumb fucks supported the oldest white man ever elected to office, arguably responsible for jailing more black Americans (see Biden crime bill) than anyone alive and call yourselves “progressive.”  It is truly hilarious and I fucking love it
off topic but I strongly agree 

Companies like Intel and Boeing and many others deserved to get spanked 100000% for being lazy and greedy. Include stock buybacks in that category.
So long as the Senate race is still undecided you should expect a choppy market. If a blue wave actually happens you should expect MASSIVE selloff as the markets prepare for Bidens tax plans. If its gridlock in Washington expect more of the same, stonks go up. Coronavirus cases no longer matter to the markets as that is directly correlated to increased testing (and a rapid test that appears to be only 60% accurate). If hospitals start to be overwhelmed thats when shit hits the fan.

He will not even be indicted (federally). He has other things though from SDNY. No... it is Rudy, his kids, a lot of his big donors (like DeJoy), and many others that enabled him that will face the many prosecutions of the upcoming Harris commission(s).

I like them both roughly the same. I just feel like NIO has popped a little harder already and XPEV has more room to catch up. XPEV also has their own factories and makes their cars unlike NIO. Either way though I like both and they should both still pop a lot. And they should move similarly.
You could be alright. It really didn't drop that bad Friday. Personally would have done a month out to be safe

This is how market will likely play out. Gap up 3% Monday. I'll fomo into the top of some stock. Market will experience a slow bleed towards EOD. Next day, if I'm still holding, market will gap down and circuit breakers will be activated. Market will continue bleeding till I sell. Rinse and repeat.

Real talk? None. Trump lost because more democrats voted for Biden. I know it's hard to believe that you're buddy Trump lost fair and square, but part of being a man is to wear big boy pants and accept uncomfortable truths.
Thoughts on them replacing J Pow with Bostic? I've done some light reading on him but don't know much more than that. Seems like this campaign may not brrrrr... at least at first.
So what’s his angle then? He needs to just concede instead of trying to spark more shit. Just glaring narcissism?

Friendly PSA from theta gang, sell your rkt before earnings. I sold puts last earnings in September, and even though rkt fucking plummeted from 34 to like 26 that day, I was able to buy back my 33 strike puts for like a $40 gain each cause of iv crush.

Not sure what iv looks like now, but just a heads up on holding through earnings
Calls on Calls
In business.
First I do not believe they shut down the country.  Would people even listen?  

Second, the pandemic is not useful anymore.  It is not needed to win an election so the focus should switch to deaths that are not rising as fast as infections.  

Third, look at the party for Biden.  Is that a bunch of people that look scared about getting infected? Everyone is next to each other. Many people in NY were not wearing a mask (shown on TV many times).

The market will go higher.  There is very little reason to slow down the economy and stimulus needs to be a hot topic now.  People are really hurting and need the help.

I’m not dancing around it. Voter suppression is illegal. I just explained the stance That Trump is taking and why. Additionally if his election campaign engages in voter suppression they will be prosecuted if prosecutors believe there is a case.
He can do something totally unpredictable.  Im leveraged to the tits in weed calls mysef, but there is the possibility of nuclear war getting started and then this guys puts would print

Shut ur racist ass up. Biden will be your president. Ya don’t have to like it or u can move.
Every subsequent lockdown announcement after the initial shock of lockdowns caused the market to rise in March. If a national lockdown happens, it will only happen in conjunction with stimulus. Bullish.

Ok calm down there buddy I didn’t release you had Einstein’s Brain implanted in the tip of your penis. If you don’t do retard then why are you on wsb, half the people here get rich or become broke on retard plays 😂
This entire thread is cancer.  This is why I’m starting to hate talking to people on WSB.
I'm talking about it right now with my family, if I was a betting man (and since i am an autist on this sub, so you know i am), i think Trump is going to throw in the towel the week after next
So how long will this weed run last? Asking for a retard
This is WSB, everyone here is retarded to some degree
340 is enough if comes this week to 2x them. But is it even possible given the extreme bullishness everywhere ?
My positions? No, they’re strangles. A strangle is when you sell a put at a strike lower than the stock price and sell a call at a strike higher than the stock price. A covered call is owning 100 shares of stock and selling a call against them.
Market's near the top, I think it's going to be a sell the news situation with the election. Admittedly I didn't put much money or effort into it, I glanced at a chart for 2 seconds on Thursday and threw $500 as a quick lotto on SPY puts for the end of next week.

I could be early, maybe it'll take another couple weeks, but I think it's going to dip down again. Especially after how hard and thoroughly it rallied through the roof last week.

Well he's said he has no plans to shut the nation down so far.
It's all written in big words so I doubt Trump understood any of it
Real talk, people who expect 🥭 behind bars immediately, what charges do you expect will put him there? It'd be a fun scene to kick off '21 but this is still the America that hates jailing the rich tbh.

Well with p vs np it’s about can you vet the number possible of solutions before the universe decays in a sense. So yes the answer is trump
Low. It would be done by state based on key risk indicators.
Not big dollars, but really important for me given I am getting fucked since last two weeks. If I get 1.5x or so, I might get back in game. 330 is more than enough for that if it comes by this or next week. What do you say ?

No way. Look at what is going on for this party.  How can they turn around now and say that we need to shutdown the country?
Oh yeah big time. Put 60% of my portfolio in them on Friday
Its gonna be weird when Trump declares himself the second president and his supporters pledge their allegiance to him.
Their reaction will result in me keeping or holding my Mj fds
Lot of 🥭 haters here. But he did ok, except for the pandemic & trade wars. Remember the lowest un-employment ever recorded. His nepotism, loyalty based rewards, narcissism & smooth lying were more concerning than his foul mouth. I like the America first policy which nobody is gonna bring up.
Well no, you study a lot of things in economics, but a lot of the foundation is based on models and charts about how things work. And sometimes those things don't actually work that way in reality.
No way he wins lawsuits in a ton of states at once. Bush v Gore was a single state with obvious election problems with the punch cards. Trump isn't only losing by one state anymore.
All the states would have to have been infiltrated. And in a way where they targeted him but no other Republican. I mean, I've bought my share of OTM FDs but I wouldn't take this bet

A lot of people assume the pot stocks are done, but with the announcement that Biden won and it’s official, there’s even more momentum. I can’t say which one will be best. ACB Has earnings so that one makes my calls a little nervous, but I have CRON, TLRY, and CGC weeklies as well
He hasnt had time to think of one? Not even one idea? Not like its an emergency or anything.
I'm not sure how much top secret and sketchy information they tell presidents. But there's a pretty good chance that Trump shares 100% of it with the public next year. And I'm kinda excited about that
Theirs and CGC earnings are going to be so dogshit. I got puts, IV was only 150%

Would be funny if cases plummeted.
sell them after we see a pullback this week maybe around 340.
What are the chances of a nation wide shutdown announced by the newly formed corona task force by biden?
Lol, if you think covid isn’t priced idk bro... good luck!
It's a tough call buddy.  Are we talking big dollars here?  The market is positioned to hit 360+ by year-end.  It is very common to rally at the end of the year.  

I personally raised cash hoping for a pullback. I do not see the type of pullback that gets us to 320.  I would bet that we have a 5% pullback to 330 and then rally from there and I only say this because we have run too far too fast.
So us covid cases are an all time high, considering Biden said he would put a quarantine again, how would market look if there was another quarantine?
Would we get another March or will we keep going up because the market has adjusted itself in a quarantine?

I just wanna know your guys thoughts
Bruh

What are your positions rn
You wouldn’t ask if you didn’t think for a second it was a possibility. Which means you buy into false narratives, lack critical thinking. Sure if votes were found fraudulent... there would already be a reputable report of it happening. But biden won in multiple states to give him a handsome lead.
BREAKING:

A 74-year-old Jamaica Estates developer has less than 3 months left at his current address after Americans overwhelmingly voted him to evict him, the AP projected Saturday.
Very true lol.
Absolutely zero. The 2020 version of that was when Fox/AP called Arizona prematurely, Biden won way too many states for it to have any chance of working out at this point
Lol Elon actually has an important job
Odds on Donnie just peaceing out to Florida before the end of the year without saying a word? There’s no way he’ll admit he lost.

Eh, I suppose, but I think this has been unfairly aimed at Biden.

Biden is 77 and active. Trump is 74 and morbidly obese. Both at fairly high risk of dying in the next 4 years. Yet I never heard anyone obsessing over Pence as if Trump was going to die next year.

True that. If Bernie does get chosen, it'd be awesome to see what impacts he can make.

trying to sell it to him by **No one has been president of Two different countries**

You all see this trumpaccountability.net shit they are pumping hard on r/conservative? Looks like foreign propaganda to me as well as the dudes replying to every single comment and talking about it. Nobody questions it, they are all eating it up.

I have to say I’m a conservative in a lot of ways. I support the 2A, low taxes, and generally minimal government interference. Despite all that, it’s going to be a long time until I vote republican again. Both parties have been infiltrated by their more extreme fringes but the extreme right seems far more dangerous to me. 

The level of paranoia and simmering violence that I see on the right is concerning at the very least, if not flat out terrifying.  Places like r/conservative breed them, and they ban anyone who disagrees. They have now sworn off Fox News and all mainstream media. Complete rejection of the world that everyone else experiences in favor of confirmation bias and the fight against the lib. They don’t see it as an election, but as an existential crisis.

I’m glad Trump is out of office, but this far right that put him there and that he pumped up is far from gone.

I should note that I’m not taking about every Trump voter, but the far right fringes that have gained influence. And all the Qanon fucks, that stuff is batshit insane.
He's not gonna change anything because he is the one who build the system we have today.

He will work with china and earn so much money by cancelling the trade war, calls on chinese e-commerce stocks, puts on American industries stocks like INTC.

Now
The Fed can't actually print cash at all. What it "prints" is "reserves."

Here's how it works. The Fed buys bonds from the banks. In return the banks get "reserves" held in a Fed account.

The important point here is the banks can't actually spend those reserves. They can't touch them at all. All the banks can do is use those reserves as collateral to lend against.

Of course, they would be risking their own capital to lend even with fed reserves as collateral, which is why credit is contracting.

If the Fed's reserves don't get lent out by the banks, then the Fed's reserves DO NOT ENTER THE ECONOMY.

In this sense, QE is actually deflationary, since it is removing liquid assets (such as bonds) from the market, and not paying liquid cash for them. In other words, the Fed is REMOVING liquidity from the system, not creating liquidity.

Guys, I have puts bought on Friday, that will triple my account if SPY hits 320 by 26thNov. Or double it for SPY 330. As of now it's slightly above 350. I see bullishness everywhere. So my puts are getting fucked as they always do. So should I sell them off on Monday or hold with diamond hands? Any correction towards 340 next week would be enough to gain some decent tendies too. 

I am sick of the paper hand shit I have done in last two weeks. This election had me screwed up. So kinda in mood to hold. Just want to check if I am not making a huge blunder here.

I mean it's not racist, it's just reality.

Candidates pick VPs to fill in their perceived gaps. And running as an old white dude in 2020, Biden's gap was potentially not appealing to young progressives and minorities. Kamala helps there.

And going back to 2016, Trump's potential gap was being too harsh and immoral to appeal to christians. Of course it turned out that christians just flipped on their morality and supported Trump regardless of what he said or did, but no one knew that at the time.

Republican senate is in danger so theres definitely gonna be a red Monday. last week was so green due to a biden presidency and a red senate being the economy's wet dream.  A blue or 50/50 senate with Harris as tie breaker means Biden gets all his super retarded fiscal policies through.  Capital gains taxes on unrealized gains anyone? Big boys gonna love that one.
I don't know why you're being defensive and dancing around the core issue of what i said - I already agree we should have voter ID laws.

Lol. Sure. I own a business. Most purchases I make that are business expenses are on credit and then paid off with no interest. If there’s a fee for credit, then I’ll write a check or use debit instead. Those purchases have zero to do with psychology. I look at personal purchases the same way.

I don’t look at a credit card as using money I don’t have. I just use it because it’s preferable to debit in accruing rewards.

Not everyone will look at money the same way I do, sure, but don’t project on how I spend money.

There are emergency orders. By January when he takes over, there will be at least 200k cases per day
If you honestly have to ask this, then at the least don't ever speak or write again besides asking for sustenance.
You were preaching a market fall for couple of days now and betting you would be able to sell eod Monday?  Wouldnt be surprised if we open red and go down from there because hell lot of people turned bullish me included.
Trump made China billions with his tarrifs lol
Why is Kamala a bad pick? I'm not saying she's a good pick, but why do people actively dislike her?

“I DECLARE THE PRESIDENCY!”
>She feels like an identity political pick

Which is basically what a VP is, so it works.

Obama picked the white dude to appeal to the mildly-racist, Trump picked the evangelical to appeal to the christians, etc etc.
We really don’t need mask mandates tbh, check out Times Square :)

Media as well... let’s see what happens
You're right; he'll suck dick while having his hair stroked being told, "you're the *best* president".
too real
There's a difference between a president and a VP. Like a massive one, actually.

I think she makes perfect sense as a VP, even though I didn't support her in the primaries.
Kamala.  There were VP candidates before (I know 1984 Dem for sure) but on losing tickets.
Think both are great investments in the long term and since it just IPO’d with earnings next week I feel like there’s a good chance at a continuation pump this week.
MJ also

some of us rely on folks like him to sell to. it's the circle of money. it's not the most egregious example by a long shot - like why does AMZN 11/13 3800 exist, much less cost about a tank of gas to own?
and bear rights
Vice doesn't really matter much for policy. She's a woman, colored, immigrant descent. She's a perfect pick
I'll either retire by 30 or die by shotgun to the head by 30.

Yang is my boy!!! Yang for commander of the economy.
The market went up for 2 days straight after the election once the mail in ballots started coming in for Biden. So I highly doubt it.
I think it’s a bit premature - Kamala might turn out to be good (I’m not so sure about her either but let’s give her a shot, she might surprise us)
We would crash to the center of the earth and America as a nation would most likely never trust another election again.

YOLOing everything
I have no idea what to buy on Monday that won’t be the top
Those rewards point are another psychological trick the CC companies use to get you to spend money on things you wouldn’t otherwise spend money on. You’ll end up thinking “you know what, if I buy this $1500 TV, I’ll get $30 back, so that’s not so bad.” People always think that marketing tricks only work on other people. It works on you too you just don’t realize it.
Newbs have to get their balls snipped by Lady Vega as a rite of passage.
We really are pushing peak bullishness here
Gold is the best general answer (or similar commodities). The worst thing you could do over the long run is to hold cash. Remember though, the fed *is aiming* for 2% inflation as an average over the next few years so that is a decent expectation. 

Printing money doesn’t directly lead to inflation, you need supply and demand changes as a result of changes in spending patterns. Those things don’t necessarily correlate perfectly. Some inflation is highly likely and is actually the goal, but *hyperinflation* is still pretty unlikely.
Not from the government

When big marco events aren't happening you are 100% correct. But this is similar to passing stimulus, everyone can be bullish and we can still moon because of hopes of less uncertainty make all the people on the sidelines comfortable to get back in the market.

Fuck big crash coming
Nor does the president.
It will last 2 months and fold
Nah he keeps saying that he will open all business and provide them with necessary safety equipments
Can we all agree that Joe’s okay but Kamala is a bad pick?
See you back here Monday morning, pussy.
Including ACB?
Pence been hiding since 2016 wondering if he can come yet.  If he wants to nuke whatever relationship he has with Trump to make millions in book sales with his memoir. No doubt it would be a great look into this shit show

Yes, and watch my kids. Do you know what a nany is?
Dude no offense if you think that is actually happening you either haven't paid attention or are retarded or both. That isn't being a pessimist at all. Dont worry your stonks will still go up but we are still fucked big time

Oh christ, you're right.  *fuck*
Just hypothetically, I’m not trying to be biased to either side but what happens if votes are fraudulent and trump gets re-elected, what happens to market? Hulk dildo or we crash? 

(Just humour me)
Or covefe
They went out of business
What’s the catalyst?
I love how everyone's acting like they love Kamala after no one voted for her in primaries and everyone bitched about her.
Go tell your mom's boyfriend
Too late for tilray calls Monday at open? Per usual my original DD was 2 months too soon and missed the launch
Where tf did u get this pic of my dad and me
Some of the people responding are stupid as hell and think my father is a pauper. He is 66 and very financially stable but also has a fair amount of debt. Once he pays the 80k towards the debt he will have none left.

At 66, I think you can afford to splurge and buy yourself something nice. People acting like he's 28 years old and should be saving/investing every penny...
Yeah, trump's A-Team of lawyer are gonna over turn votes counts in like 4 states 😂
What’s a little IV crush amongst friends?
Ohh wait.. you’re right

Yang as Secretary of De-boomerizing the Government
Makes absolute perfect sense. I support this.
Huh? The key to beating trump was to put out the most undercover centrist-posing-as-democrat as you could. Kamala fits the bill. It appeases the Dems because she isn't a white male and it appeases the undecideds because she isn't AOC
She sucked dick to get her job in SF (google Willie Brown), and she put a bunch of weed smokers in jail while being a pothead herself
Trump’s son will win 2024

Set fire; watch it burn to the ground.  60/40 on this one...
This is the correct take. I'm tired of this shit after 12 years. No more
This would be the way. But I don’t want them going with out. I have daughters. Kind of glad I’m getting this mess out of while in my 30’s. Won’t need wsb much when I actually learn how to trade.
And America chose to change it back the first chance they got. Sooooooo....
He's broke how is he gonna start it? No bank is gonna touch him
Neoliberalism is so radical
How does one fast forward to Monday ffs ?
Trump doesn't get it. He isn't the god of the right, he's a temporary whale they could latch on to. He was a showman.

Actual big right-wing powerhouses like Rupert Murdoch (Fox News) were merely allowing Trump to play, because it was good for them at the time. Once it was clear Trump was losing and he started lashing out at Fox, that was the real Trump KO. He's doing a really bad job picking enemies right now.

Same problem as Hilary. Unlikeable personality and pretty fake even by politician standards. She lost early in the primaries, so it’s a little ridiculous that there’s a decent chance she could become president. That said, I don’t think she’ll be incompetent.
Atvi too. One of the only mainstream games not delayed.
Fuck the negative comments here. Good work bro

Credit >>> debit for the rewards points...just always pay the full CC bill so you don’t have any interest accrued.

Imagine putting this into NIO. Welcome home retard.
Alllright... Serious question (don't ban me). When the fed prints money, doesn't it just go out as loans that need to be paid back with interest?
Does he really infuse himself with young teen blood?
Hell why didn’t Biden get a better VP.... I can get behind him but Kamala is the problem. Hopefully she does as much as Pence did (nothing)

She didn’t allow mike pence to talk over her in the debate, so obviously she’s a bitch.

My comment was supposed to be sarcasm. I'm not a big Trump guy, but I think it's funny everybody is acting like we're all saved by Joe. Like good finally won in the end. Biden has made millions upon millions doing nothing but politics for 40 years. IMO both candidates were pretty shitty but nothing is really going to change so it's all fine. I think the sarcasm was lost though haha
Yep, xbox and SI update on Tuesday, ps5 on Thursday
Kamalas outfit is lit tho 🔥

this is the right answer.

I did bro. I was telling my friend look at the vix falling on that last red day. 


Ultimately, I grossly overestimated the impact of the tantrums that Trump would be throwing. I guess that's still left to be seen until Jan.

@everyman_b true, if it goes your way. What happens when a stock drops 8%? It's a much bigger hit to an option holder then a share holder, 8% drop is catastrophic hit to an option holder if they aren't holding leaps compared to a share holder, even then you better have a reason or thesis for a big turn around.

Actually buying on debit is superior to credit because of the psychological affects of using credit. Credit makes you spend more money because it makes you feel like you have unlimited money. Using a debut card makes you think “fuck im gonna have to load this bitch up if i buy that jacket.” You’ll have more money to blow on retarded calls if you use debit.
I manage my dads e-trade account and did a $5k option yolo on $362 calls for SPY expiring 11/13 (placed the order on 10/12) and it’s worth like $300 right now and he doesn’t even know and I’m not gonna tell him

Update: SPY went up to $365 on 11/9 and I sold the position at a $300 loss. GG

I can agree with everything except credit cards unless you make payment in full each month and use for points. Not really smart to rack up credit card debt and not be able to make full payment on it each month.
You got to make up your damn mind. Is she a token or is she the actual president who's going to take over as soon as Biden steps down aaaaaaany minute now?

Biden is actually a religious guy, so it’s not all fake. Trump is about as religious as Dawkins, except he doesn’t even believe in science.
I seriously want any US President to do a good job regardless of party, but I would like Kamala to nose dive off a cliff.
it must be fun being so fucking dumb......
Trump’a a sore loser he lost someone tell him to get the fuck over it

Honestly, this is how the country should react to the President elect. When Trump won the majority of the people in the country (you know, because Trump lost the popular vote by over 2mil) were being called “snowflakes” and “losers”, now the majority of country is celebrating. Pretty dope! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Definitely agree
None of the bitch asses here will tell you this, because they waste all their money gambling like degenerates and misery l**o**ves company, but it is easier (and smarter) to buy options that mimic the shares and expedite the returns at lower capital costs upfront. If you're leveraged 5:1 in calls it is cheaper to buy the call and have the underlying go up 1% than it is to buy the shares and have the underlying go up 5% which means that you have a lower, not higher, risk function from a capital preservation point of view.

What a speech, excited for a great 4 years
When market is going down ,No more tweets like  "stimulus talks going well", "trade deal talks going well", "tremendous stimulus coming" 
Ironically, anything Trump now tweets will probably scare the markets.
He's already lost all his support within his own administration. Nobody who matters wants to go along with his election fraud bullshit. Guy is going to be the biggest lame duck president in the history of this country. Won't be surprised if he's completely sidelined and Pence is carrying out the presidential duties by end of next week.

Lol u think I really care about karma ?
It ran up 40% in a month homie, its just a minor correction
This is  why I love this place
Cautiously optimistic. Fauci, is that you?
According to MW dictionary:

"It refers to a system of social organization in which private property and the distribution of income are subject to social control, but the conception of that control has varied, and the term has been interpreted in widely diverging ways, ranging from statist to libertarian, from Marxist to liberal."

Now, tell me what part of taking from people through mandatory taxation, e.g. social security tax, and giving it to others is not a form of income that's subject to social control?

Also, besides "hur dur socialism", I will ask you to explain yourself again why Biden = socialism. You're just a brainwashed talking point regurgitating little dunce and you don't even know it.

Why would you buy so many puts on one stock? It's hard enough to guess right (yes, it's just a guess) once on the timing that could make a put successful. But you put money on your ability to do it three times?
Did mango say something?

Edit: never mind, holy shit, delusional doesn't cover it
As long as she keeps her arms down by her side I’d smash
It’s almost like you’ve never heard someone misspeak before. Elon does it all the time and yet you yolo your life savings on TSLA FDs
yes let's do that then leave the senate race to assuage suspicion!
May god protect our truth
Love our boy Biden didn’t mention the mango once
Biden has spent the last 3 days recording this in chunks so he sounds competent. The car horns are where the edits happened. Can’t wait for the state of the union.
Holy shit! How did someone get a picture of that document!?!?

People forget the public burning debt causes deflation, we de-leveraged so much since the debt bubble its insane.  Technology drives down build costs.

You are so right, it will be very embarrassing for Donald Trump!

damn this speech, forgot what it's like to hear a president speak coherently.

also just made me realize how its' good that donaldo was about as smart as us on any given week.  could not have botched the rona response any worse and had numerous times to eject and still gain people's support.  his followers woulda have followed him anyway so christ what the fuck was he thinking? eeked this one out.
Ban. Don’t click link
Does the president have the authority to impose a national lockdown? I think that's more in the hands of the governors and state legislators?
You missed the fact that the response was a polite golf clap.  


It's good words but the people on the extreme ends will always snipe at each other.

Bullshit, Joe has people so hyped now, even trumpers remembering what it's  like hearing a real fucking President tonight that if it's overturned this country will be burned to the ground.  It's over dummy, Joe just deflated the opposition and any remaining support for that retard Donnie.

Couple mins late about this but,

Biden talking about hiring a group of experts for COVID is honestly a good thing BUT:

These experts do a single-factor analysis-- how to prevent the spread of COVID.

That means Lockdown pt. 2 Electric Boogaloo. 

Not good for market.
I have a very surface level understanding of ethanol, would you mean expanding a little bit.
He just said it’s a bad idea to bet against America

If you want to start to understand what really happened watch AleX Gibney's documentary on the Coronavirus response on Hulu. There is probably a lot left to come out on this.

“We choose to go to the moon” - JFK
WHY IS HE YELLING
Sir, this is a casino. r/politics is that way...
I'm going to be totally honest with you and tell you that analysts actually do tend to know something about the stocks that they analyze and they do put real manhours into figuring out their price targets. For instance the reason that Macy's has a low price target currently is because functionally it is not a sustainable business as it stands in the modern world going forward; unless Macy's leverages it's brand and does something to break into the online platforms there's nothing left to salvage because it is fundamentally an old model that is not as cost effective as other platforms or models regarding clothing and such.

And a lot of analysts do put their money where their mouth is and a lot are not tragically poor. When you know that XYZ bio-tech is going to go up based on their research because you yourself are a researcher any many analysts actually are from the field they analyze then you put your money into it. If there was anyone to follow regarding normal market behavior it would be analysts.

TL;DR: What you think is DD is not DD for them. It is a blurb. And barely that.
Too easy and yet it was too hard for them. What does that tell you of their competence?

That’s not true all analysts aren’t equal. I can’t remember his name but remember the analyst from JPM that was saying GE is fuct and bag of shit months before they nose dived? 

Also the idea is the average opinion of a group of analysts is a good analyst.

Congrats on your wonderful start! Can only go up from here! Right?
I feel like Biden is just so much more authentic and down to earth man. And Kamala is awesome. Im mostly just excited that we won’t have to hear the term “fake news” arrogantly thrown around every fucking day
IOU calls, it is a penny stonk tho didn't expect that would be the first choice, Joe
Bidens fav minorites is clearly african americans
Trump shouts out company names to pump, Biden yells out minorities 

Confused, what do I buy calls on
realistically what could he say to help pump NIO
HONKKKKKKKKKKK
HAONNNNKKKKKK
For real tho
like a normal human being
Lol I couldn’t believe it when I heard it on the radio they said people were flocking to the streets crying in joy like is this real lol

Banging melania
You're getting desperate for those puts not to expire, aren't you
Looks like a lot of maga maggots have entered this chat. 

Calm down with your hatred you fucks. The country is happy to not have to deal with open racism, hate & corruption everyday. Even though you may not like the administration, be a decent human
"I don't believe in red states or blue states" 

Sounds like a huge stimulus dog whistle

Calls on Joe’s upper supplier
You’ll lose November.
Several vaccines are likely to report initial phase 3 results before the end of the year. Wouldnt be surprised if one got emergency approval before inauguration, though I bet not generally available outside of healthcare workers and other approved people for a few months after that.

That said, Democrats could make the case for recovery stimulus even in the (impossible, hypothetical) scenario of the virus having disappeared from the Earth. And though it doesn't tickle my fancy, it's not a crazy idea -- the Fed will continue their stimulative policies for years after we've stopped wearing masks.
lmao. This needs to be a thing

Twitter calls buyden gonna pumpppp

Wouldn’t be there without Hunter 👊
Ya but the key is compunding 20% over and over, options are bs and way riskier, stocks just don't magically expire worthless 99% of the time,  unless you write options on covered calls you are not winning long term on fds. Put a poll up I'll bet everything I have 90% of the people here dealing only in option fds aren't winning long term. You kids and dreams of Lebron reserving a seat for you on his yacht with pornstars awaiting your arrival is hilarious.

I have faith in nothing after a shit ton of my solid plays got absolutely killed 😢

Like my AMD calls that went from +100% to - 50% when they surprise released earnings.

I might let a few calls ride through, but I have plenty of stock in each so I can keep exposure without any IV crush fuckery.
Motherfucker
Oh shit...that's *not Biden*
Which line?
I only talk about hurricanes because they are the most dramatic part of climate change. I would wonder if sand companies will see gains with increasing beach restoration from rising sea levels.

We don't know if Elon was referring to Nio or just to 42 meaning 

[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=42](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=42)
Come on Joe give NIO a quick shout out!!
Worst case scenario is the secret service throws him out for trespassing.  Serious there is nothing he can do to still be president after January.  Why do you think they were slowing down the mail and coming up with creative ways to throw people off the voter rolls?
c’mon man, gimme a good gaffe
Serious question, what is Trump doing at this very moment?
Mango would trip him
Joe is getting me so hard and pumped I'm going to fuck my wife retarded as Donnie tonight.
Biden looks youthful, did they pump him with methamphetamine
That was definitely the worst thing lol. That arm break on DWTNCS this year was pretty bad too

Hmm, maybe not right now cause there could be a small drop so you can get it at a discount. But I dont expect them to do very well as they expand.

Go to the projects and tell me what tf they know. It’s easy to say the bs your talking about living in suburbia, but I grew up with people from the slums of America. 

How are poor people going to sell something easier that rich people control? If that was the case, poor people would focus on selling legal things like oil and diamonds. The ignorance in your statement is directly how I know you liberals don’t give af about black people. Poor black people created the most popular forms of music and they don’t even control that, so you’re telling me they will be able to keep their market share of drugs? Ignorance!
Calls on banks, these two are probably the most Wall Street friendly politicians I’ve ever seen since the clintons!

0% profit is better than loss
Kamala really did a good job with that. I thought I wasn’t a fan, but I’m coming around.

I will say that it is very important to know. Soft sciences get a bad rep in the modern world but are extremely important; most of the world is run by soft stuff since almost all soft sciences deal with human interaction and almost none of the hard science do. Hard sciences will never explain a viral idea for instance.

Disliking mango is one thing, a somewhat reasonable thing, but worshipping these people like it's a huge relief and great for the country is another thing entirely.
Car horns blaring over a presidential victory speech is so 2020
No you're not original for making that dumb run into a meme
ahahahahhaah
U got me
**The Chinese Communist Party will  have recruited (and will continue to recruit) legions of eager Western  “helpers” to accomplish this “Pump & Dump”.  Politicians,  regulators, Investors and the Big Banks will all be clamoring for freer  flow of even more capital, less regulation, further opening of direct  Fed financing, eagerly dancing to the the CPC’s siren song.  Every  Investment House, Big Bank, Hedge Fund and Pension Fund worth their  salt, will have access to Chinese market intelligence, recruit Chinese  management and open offices in Shanghai (if they’ve not done so already)  with the only goal being to maximize their returns on these  investments.  The only way they’ll survive is to truly be in the loop  when “Blue Horseshoe Loves Anacott Steel….or Hates Blue Star Airlines”.**

Please link a reliable source, because that is absolutely fake news. If you seriously believe this, you're autistic.

Edit: Any political post without positions should be banned.
Packing the Supreme Court is not something new. If you look up the history of the court there are periods of time where justices have been added and removed due to politics. People argue that ignoring voter ID is a way  to make fraudulent voting easier. Parties literally engage in activities all the time that will help THEM win. A two party system serves you in no shape way or form. The Germans learned this and that’s why they don’t have two party system.
RemindMe! 1 week when rona isn't over

When you buy Chinese food you get curry?
She has Illuminati vibes
You are correct, they are unlikely to try to pass tax reform while the pandemic is still raging/economy is still shit. They will likely throw more stimulus and maybe in a year, if the economy is doing better, will think about tax reform

I mean I admit it is a soft science and it does have some recursion to it; all soft sciences have recursion to them (basically, once you know about the thing, it changes your behavior and once your behavior changes the observation changes relative to the knowledge gained) which is what causes Physics Envy. 

The more theoretical you get in any science however, including hard sciences, the naturally more disconnected the theories are from reality until one is proven and the others are discarded. Also, I am not actually offended. It's Econ so everyone gets it wrong. Just like Finance. And Sociology.

Did she win the presidency? She didn't do shit.
I mean there was probably a record number of 90 year old voters because mail in votes were allowed and encouraged in every state. My 93 year old Grandpa voted this year from his care center. It's not fraud or illegal, just the way the times are.
Bad or good? Wtf are you pussies talking about? Just make money going up and down?

Does Webull not allow orders for trades in the evening to take place during market open of the next business day?
Definitely will be
The risk/reward is all wrong. That’s what’s wrong. At this point it will take NIO at least 2 years to grow into their valuation. They don’t have manufacturing power to sell 100k cars/year, let alone 500k. 95% of people buying NIO right now don’t have a clue about their business model. NIO is not Tesla

Very simple dudes. 3 steps to becoming rich. 

1. Borrow money you don’t have. As much as you can. Credit cards. Parents. Student loans. Etc.  

2.  Pick a stock. 

3.  Buy all of that stock and YOLO. Bonus points if you buy OTM options. Those ones are ballz of steel.

Art of the deal in its final form.
Read the fine print. Says 50% of donations to legal fund will go to pay down campaign debt.
He didn’t say legal, just decriminalized. It’s actually hilarious that he could legalize it but will only do decriminalization.

Well, Trump just really screwed up horribly with coronavirus and racism. That’s 2 huge things impossible to overcome
Just keep an eye on what King says publicly... also it's very unlikely that dems win both of the run-offs in Georgia... the republicans will also be motivated as all fucking hell to win those, and the betting odds favor Perdue heavily (with all known statistics and qualitative factors taken into account). Not sure about the insider trading bi-otch, though (Loeffler). Odds say she will likely lose.

No, but I told her my assets were tied up in highly lucrative stocks and I am just not very liquid right now.
I prefer presidents that don't lose reelection
That's not what im saying. Just because something is legal doesn't mean you should it. Like if the democrats win they could pack the courts and it would be legal, they could do statehood and it would be legal. They could find legal ways to make it harder for you to vote because they know you're a registered republican, but that doesn't mean they should do it. For a party that "loves" freedom it's fucked up to make it harder for *legal* voters to vote just because it helps you win.
But would you hold through earnings?
I just guessed.  But yeah

Guys, just checked the “rate my portfolio” thread at r/stocks. The amount of people with more than 30% invested in NIO is insane. I think they may be more retarded than us
I am not an American, but on the other hand, if dems control the senate, wouldn't we be seeing a huge stimulus bill soon?

“Contested”...

Anyhow with a republican senate and right leaning supreme court it is safe to say that that the future is predictably status quo, or at least that very little will get done. That *should* make it more stable.
I didn't mean to offend you bro. I think your points are valid. However, I think a lot of what you are saying is that there are subtopics in economics that are actually useful. I agree with that! For example, when I studied microeconomics and learned about how firms maximize profit (MC = MR my dude!), that's something that is useful and applicable. I still do think that most higher level theoretical econ though has too many assumptions and does not reflect reality accurately. In the end though, what's it matter right? We're just here to make some dough!
Offer?

It’s been 5 years now and I still haven’t gotten a call from the IRS. Idk what he did. I don’t wanna know what he did. Either way it saved a young kid who spent to much money a lot of headaches

I'm mad. So many people slandering my favorite Soft Science. Economics past level 300 classes actually does use real experiments in modeling and it is very useful in deciphering what to do in certain games (Game Theory is a branch of Economics for instance) and under various conditions.

I don't mean to be rude but fuck everyone who doesn't actually know Econ who thinks they know Econ because that's like 99% of the motherfuckers who talk about it. Even in Neo-Classical Econ "models" didn't come from nowhere and there are plenty of explanations such as Veblen Goods and price signals that create complex rationality functions and utility functions.

Basically Economics *does* know why you buy brand name versus generic cereal. It isn't some random ignorant science. There's also understandings of compulsions that are irrational and that are importantly irrational!

TL;DR: Everyone has Dunning-Kruger when it comes to Economics.

If you can get past the emotional manipulation by the media (hurr durr the other side is racist/fascist/socialist/etc) you can clearly see that both Donnie and sleepy joe are pretty centrist..

Yep and ACB have been a dumpster fire for earnings with the exception of two quarters ago.  Now it’s possible they get a good beat and those puts you sold will be super safe but I put that possibility in the 30% range.  Might be in the middling range and if that’s the case you might be safe and even if you get assigned you will still be in profit.  

However if it’s like last quarter, that shit could drill to 4.

Because Donald trump is loosing the vote and the vast amount of his supporters voted in person while Bidens voted by mail. It was quite obvious they were going to explore any legal option they could when he came out rallying against mail in voting 6 months ago. Likewise if something was extremely close And could benefit Bidens campaign they would explore their legal options also.

1- its not a punishment.  We all get taxed on our income at the same rate for each dollar we make.  It's the most important thing that funds our government, which is absolutely vital.

With regard to kids, people should not be disincentivized to have them just because cost of living is so high.  We absolutely need people in America to have more children.  Our demographic curve is thinning out at the bottom, meaning we have fewer people entering the economic system than leaving it through retirement or death.  And the fact is today, American families have fewer and fewer children because dependent care costs like daycare, medical, etc are so dramatically high.  It should never been seen as "irresponsible" to have children, but for many families it is an enormous financial setback.

I'll give you my personal situation ,since you gave me yours.  When I was 29, I was diagnosed with cancer.  I went through a long fight and got a lot of chemo.  My career progression was interrupted because I couldn't work.  I was told by my doctors I would never have children, even after remission...lo and behold, my girlfriend got pregnant and we had a healthy little girl (yes the child is mine, I did in fact start producing sperm again).  Then, my cancer came back, and I fought it for another 2 years.

Now, I have student loans from my MBA I completed a year before cancer, but couldn't capitalize on because I got sick and couldn't work.  I have more medical debt than mortgage debt despite good employer provided health coverage.  I have medical debt for my daughter's birth on top of it.  I pay for daycare, an equivalent amount to my mortgage payment each month.  Thats a lot of money going out.  Did I do something irresponsibly here?  Is any of this fair?  This is life.

And like it or not, the laws aren't written for 23 year olds who make $150k.  Youre doing well.  Be happy about that, dont complain that you're somehow being treated unfairly.

2- this is math.  5% of your gross income if you make $150k is an extra $7,500 added to your gross.  This is prior to social security, empyer provided health insurance premiums, other employer provided things like life insurance or death&disability, 401k contributions, IRA contributions, FSA if you choose to do that for medical, and various other things you can do to decrease your tax liability.  Or just a standard deduction of $12k. 

AFTER all that, you pay taxes on SOME of what is left.  Google the tax brackets to calculate it.  But in general youre paying a total of perhaps, what, about $35,000 federal income tax.  And I get that that seems like a lot.  I pay more than I want to pay as well.  Consider that the average household in America makes less than that, on a GROSS basis.  

But, 4% of that is $1,400.  

For you this is purely residual income.  This is the difference in the annual amount you can plug into robinhood.  Is that significant?  Its roughly equivalent to canceling your Comcast TV subscription and subscribing to Google TV instead.

Trump has made it a necessity to investigate the elections in swing states. It is something we must do to maintain confidence in our electoral system, regardless of the incredulity of the presidents statements. What a sad time. God bless America and fuck Trump.
This is why you lost.
No question about it
So the US has been printing trillions over trillions for over a decade now and how has inflation been? The impact the supply of money has on inflation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The US prints trillions and it goes to hedge funds, pension funds and Big Dick Bezos. They take that money and invest in shit like the stock market, inflating stock prices and any other asset that these rich ass bitches get their hands on. Inflation will happen when income inequality goes down.

I think red on Monday too

> In 2017 King opposed the Republican tax bill, criticizing its passage on a party-line vote without hearings

found this on wikipedia, any stuff more recent that you have? Otherwise, it seems like he's against the tax stuff trump did
Apparently, but we will see. I enjoyed the hysterical shrieking from Hillary fans when Trump won.
Saveworthy edit.
VIX bottomed at 12 right before the corona crash. We are still at twice that at the moment but it will be interesting to see once we get there and market moves ~0.3% per day. 

Options will also be so much cheaper though.
Goodwill calls?
I disagree but my bull case on tech is humanity’s reliance on it and the future of AI, which might be different than how others are looking at it.

How's Trump not conceding and possibly abusing legal loopholes to remain the president priced in? Van Jones talked about it on television, it's very possible, not sure if I can link it but it's on yt
The fuck, he gets a comment and I don’t. Facist
What's mango?
we can only hope, make DD great again
Just adds more flavor
[He obviously hasn't lost to the point of a net worth valued in pennies yet though](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc3t3IVkq60), since his lowest position is in the middle of the chart. Maybe he's just so autist that he doesn't know he still has money left.
growing tech companies are ~overvalued
problem with banning Alex Jones is that I can't watch him get mad and losing it
Yes I know it’s a JBC but it’s no different then just a JBC. Nothing deluxe about it
Trust me, the market will find a way to rally.
If democrats got the Senate, how soon would they introduce tax reforms? 

Trump is still in office till Jan, democrats would first focus on getting the biggest stimulus bill they can, deal with a raging pandemic and then get to tax reforms. Meanwhile, there’s probably going to be some good news from lower unemployment numbers, holiday sales, corporate earnings and all that shit. 

Markets have been acting very short sighted for a long time now, would hedge funds- who’re especially desperate to show higher returns this year- simply going to want to miss out on all of this action? 

You do make sense, taxes will take center stage, but I just think it’s unlikely that’s going to be in a week from now.
They are going to rise, and yes its Trumps fault.

You can't hand someone a house thats half burnt down and still on fire, and then expect them to fix it. 

COVID is way beyond out of control right now, I don't think its possible to contain it at this stage no matter who is president.
You dumb brah
Lol you for real don't know why Biden would be good for China stocks?  I mean, I don't even have NIO options but come on you have to know why Biden would be a plus for China stocks/relations from where we are now right .....right???
THAT ruffled your feathers? Jeez
Racist. You hate people for their race. Lol later

Vix approaching the lows before corona crash. 

Once this market does relax will be interesting to see how frustrated retailers get when they learn +/- 1-2% moves each day is absolutely not a normal market
Damn that sounds amazing .... nowadays you gotta lose your job so you can finally roll it into an IRA and trade as you wish
lost a shit ton on my amd calls when they released earnings early. watching this go up all the way to 85 and seeing the contracts value go right back up sucks. monday will be green and it’ll suck more. shame
I’m terrified Monday is gonna be profit taking day
WSB said it would be red last week and it was greener than Madagascar.
Mmm kinda switched it up and did start to buy shares as well on next amazon type companies. Provides me with a cover of legitimacy and you never know if you might stumble on the next AMZN
Lol yeah, totally mooning
Maybe the jobs data and stockmarket response will actually correlate for once
Like the Mafia kinda family, where people and money go missing at random
I apologize
I tolerate blaming the last guy for 3 months. After that it's shut the fuck up and fix the problem
Give it to me!
That's why I am pissed off. People jaywalking empty street do more jail time than these rich ars*holes.
Watch the senate... that’s the only reason why the fucking sky isn’t falling in on the bulls...
Mitch will probably whoop senate in line with 1.5 T stimmy this year though, and Vaccine trials should be done by year end. Bullish until December.
1600-1800 is next stop, then maybe 1100-1200 in 2022
Green on Sunday Eve though. Retail investors doing their thing.
THEIR EARNIGNS IS SHIT.. they were shit PRE AND POST (REVERSE SPLIT).... APPLE AND TESLA DOES SPLITS...bad companies usually do REVERSE SPLITS

I mean. If it does moon. You just pray there’s profit taking mid week. But highly doubt it because it’s Probbaly owned by most of wsb and wsb doesn’t profit take.
Global or USA equity’s?
Lotta big time bulls on Twitter who wanted Trump to win are starting to turn really bearish!
The market will climb due to Trumps last 3 yrs. Plus a bunch of boomers pulled money out do to the Wuhan Virus, Plus a bunch of foreign money came in to fix the Biden campaign,  stay for a while you might learn something.
Yeah, owning a lot of shares in stuff like google, baba, amazon, etc feels wise. Or getting in early on stuff like rocket and NIO.

Damn I wish I had the energy to do this research. Good thing everything on WSB is correct so I’m all in.
You are right that this is the thing to watch, but also check what Independent senator angus king said most recently about getting rid of the filibuster- which is a key first step to all the massive swj policy changes. He ain’t gonna support that shit. So even if Republicans lose the two seats in Georgia, there is the angus factor to consider....

Yet he won’t  be charged for manslaughter or anything. Almost like he’s not actually responsible for the deaths. It’s like he’s responsible for the miss handling the situation and why he was voted out. Ultimately it would likely ended up with him having won the vote had he handled the situation or if covid had not occurred.

If Democrats win all the senate seats in states where Biden won they would have a senate majority. Really makes you think.

#BREAKING

JOE BIDEN ANNOUNCES BIG STIMULUS DEAL UNDER ONE CONDITION: EACH AMERICAN HAS TO BUY $200 WORTH OF NIO SHARES. SENATE HAS ALREADY AGREED TO THE DEAL.

😳😳😳
Taxes will not rise because the Republican senate will block it. This was a big reason why the stock market ripped higher after election.
Yeah for sure. I think it’s around 20% of my (quite small) portfolio now. I have a lot more stable investments making up the majority, and I am young
Lmao. Any chance CRON runs to $20 by next year?
Sell right before 12th or no? Feel like it might spike before earnings then dip again right after, thoughts?
So that just means JPow is gonna be flying in with those clones right? Stimmi coming in fast!

Nice. I probably ain't playing any more options. Got into this crap leading into the election. My entire thesis about how the election would play out was correct and the market..... did not react. I may never in my life understand this mickey mouse bullshit market but I know never to bet against it again now that money printers are available at any moment. Sticking with individual Stonks and hopefully soon some real estate. Some people are good at this shit. I do much better investing in myself and trying to advance my own career and business. I like what you're doing though.
What do you guys think about rocket
You are in denial. It quotes a Washington post article. His own people say he has dementia.
The biggest issue is there is no scientific culture in economics - if a "model" makes sense to experts then it's true, you don't need to test it with the real world. It's just guessing and group think at that point in academia (there is good economic analysis happening at hedge funds and to a lesser extent at wall street firms, but that makes sense as they have actual incentives and are solving real, provable and falsifiable problems).
any links?
Not to mention Joe's obvious superior physical health

This website shows you the aggregate of random users input lolololololol there are “13 people interested” in this question lmfao y’all are reaching so hard.
And the major flaw with economics is that all of the models are built with huge generalizations about consumers. For example, assuming that all buyers of a good or service act in a rational way and only buy something if it's a good price. There are other variables that aren't accounted for. When I see articles that say shit like "Major economist predicts x...", I just laugh and ignore it.

Size is still up in the air though. Pelosi doubled down on wanting it all Friday while McConnel is in the same spot after Fridays good job numbers and possibly keeping the senate. At least the president won't veto when Biden gets in.

Again I’ll ask for the link on where Trump has been proven of anything? Yet the bar for him to make claims is to have proof. I don’t want any time wasted on voter fraud claims nor more Russia bs. Let’s tackle real issues? Is that such a radical position?

Extremely useless in general, it's not scientific and most isn't even testable.
Magonians believe ALL Dem's are crooks. It is just the lesser evil for them.
Trump wasn't proven anything. It was impossible from the start due to Justice Department policy that he couldn't charge the President and the fact that Trump refused to interview.

I'm actually curious to see if the full report or at least the opening summary eventually gets released to the public as Mueller requested once Trump is out of office.
Because Mom and Dad have money..plus plenty of adults use it now to get away from toxic facebook.
True. If gop keeps the senate they can still control legislation while crapping all over Biden
If you listen to any news they all are ignoring his nonsense even fox. So his little band of crazies will retreat to their hovels where they belong. The longer he goes the more people distance themselves from him
Chill. I’ve seen bigger celebrations over UGA football games and that didn’t change anyone else’s life either

Just saying everyone knows if we “lockdown” again it’s just the best buying opportunity (as long as you’re not buying the Russell...)

Just sayin don’t expect the dip to be very big if you’re cash gang. Cuz everybody and they mama wanting to jump in. Especially after last week. And everybody sees that as the chance
Is it worth buying?? Sure. But then, some people think heroin is worth buying, sooooo.......
Hmm. That reminds me, wonder how that Iraqi dinar savings plan worked out for those trumpets.
Crazy idea: maybe don’t spend 6 months telling your base that the easiest simplest form of voting is fake and fraudulent. Then they can use mail in votes too!

I think coronavirus has kind of taken the back burner recently, but we're about to enter the worst period of the pandemic and dems will be able to run on trump/senate gop failure on that front. 

And don't forget the upcoming supreme court case. The dem candidates can talk about healthcare every single day
Im scared about tax season coming. 

This year I deposited 250 dollars and turned it into 5.3k then used my robinhood tendy card and cashed out at a ATM and might have sorta maybe blew it on some nice ass. 

At the time I was like this is deff gonna come back and bite me in the dick. I feel like I’m gonna owe a lot this year. Especially cause my job pays half W-2 and half 10-99. 

This tax season might be the first one in a long time I pay someone to do them for me

Are you daft? members of the Trump campaign, that were convicted in court, some then pardoned or commuted by the president, were found to have lied when retaining a clearance about Russian links and where accused of being liasons between Trump's inner circle and Moscow. Guys like Paul Manafort, or that Jared Kushner and Trump Jr met with Russian agents like Maria Butina.
Oil is fucked by the market, not Biden. Renewables are the future, and there isn’t anything that can be done about it. 

Cry more.
You’re a weed shill stfu
It is not over yet bub. Trump is going to get all the illegal votes removed and the supreme court will rule that Trump is the winner. We are not leaving the white house so settle on down.
Yo prob been mentioned but the fact that the presser today was held at that lawn care place cracks me the fuck up.  Then Giuliani getting the news that it’s called and not knowing how to respond.  Thanks 2020, imma be ready for green dick week
Depends on the terms of the prenup. She prolly has to hit a few milestones still.
Thanks for the reply, I relate to this because I also am retarded.

With the election "over" i bet we see green. Then, around 12, everyone remembers the pandemic, joblessness, no stimulus coming since its a divided congress, and Biden can't remember where he parked the danm car, so the market drops a total of 3% for the day.

I just remembered Wednesday night people were asking for yolo plays and I said “sq” I hope they tailed.
Trump is the nominee of the party. He has the support of the party and is the face of it. In no way can he be considered some sort of black sheep.
You don't.
It's his money, if he cared, he'd do it. 
I would also opt for a new Beemer over gambling free money on NIO, or anything else. 
Riding the hype train with someone else's money is great until it crashes.

I really believe in gold but history shows the government can just steal it from you
I get that you didn't like Donnie but quit fucking acting like we just won a war and Biden is going to make your life that much better. I pray that he really does and all this people celebrating are right.

Hyperinflation is actually pretty hard to do. If you read the book Lords Of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed, you will see in detail what the central bankers had to do to create it in the 1920's. It takes way more work than you think.
Maybe you should do some reading. Most people agree. [https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4906/will-an-official-diagnosis-of-dementia-be-announced-for-joe-biden-before-2023/](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4906/will-an-official-diagnosis-of-dementia-be-announced-for-joe-biden-before-2023/)
Basically it's gone up a lot. A whole lot. But it is the environment (the entire sector has blown up) and not the merit of the company. "Chinese Tesla" my ass. Tesla has a brilliant genius at the helm running in a purely competitive capitalist manner and Nio is Chinese Govt. backed meaning that it is fundamentally able to be subsumed if it fails at the whim of old men.

You’re gonna need a bigger boat
It is academically when the morning "ends" in the markets. So what happens is that prices settle and that means that the entry is good for power hour at the last hour and a half of the day when most are closing positions. Midday run-ups tend to not occur between these points so the morning dip or rise happens then it stabilizes and then it usually goes the other way in the evening.
But we have four months atleast ?
I wonder what sound a lame duck makes? 🤔🦆
Buying TACO calls, got it
Also indictment isn’t guilty. Trump can get his AG to file charges on people too... doesn’t prove guilt... 

This isn’t a pro trump post. This is an anti-hypocrite post.

Joe Biden is very happy. He finally beat George Bush and took back the house. He will make a very strong senator.
it was clear he was winning since Thursday
Pretty good but they didn’t have liposuction back then
Some people are really dumb saying you can’t silence violence. It’s actually pretty easy, first off. Second off, don’t disrespect Dr Seuss like that
Biden has been priced in, as we've already seen. Barring anykind of election fraud miracle, elections are over!

Which means? Sell the news. Plus...back to the plague/virus. 

Which means we got more volatility coming. My bets is some wicked sell side is coming.  This week? Maybe. This month? I'm betting on it.

What’s the play here
I get strong “End of 50 Million Merits episode of Black Mirror when the guy holds a blade of glass to his throat but it’s just because he’s now a TV Star sold out and that’s his bit” vibes from Trevor Noah
That's not how it works. A male child born in the US will on average live to 78. However, that average includes people who die before 78. If you make it to 77, you clearly didn't die already, so that's not a useful figure. 

For a 77 year old male in the US, the life expectancy is 10 years. On average, someone who has already made it to 77 can expect to make it to 87, and Biden will be helped out by the fact that he'll have the best healthcare it is possible to have, and he's reasonably healthy and in shape.

- Last line of speech, “And if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to take a nap now”
- When attacked by Trump “Don, you should really get some sleep”. 
- When asked about ‘Rona “We should not sleep on this”.

Biggest net short position in the history of 30 year treasury futures. Speculators are betting huge on inflation but everyone knows inflation can only occur due to the government actually printing money (not bank reserves) and really only when the economy is at full tilt.

However, I don't know if that leads to a market crash, because the banks are the ones profiting from this trade. If whoever sold short those treasuries put the money into the stock market... then oh boy, we definitely could have another crash.

There's something that's so satisfying about seeing a man who's insulted, ridiculed and taunted the opposition for 4 years lose to said opposition. 


Kinda like a bully in school who eventually gets what's coming, that's how I see this election result. 

Seeing someone who's so vulgar and unprofessional who believes they're gods gift to humanity stopped dead in their tracks is more enjoyable than I would like to admit.

Except that money gets put back in the economy when people in the middle and lower class have more disposable income. Money that’s spent gets passed from company to company (small local businesses and services make it go even farther) generating 2-10x that initial dollar value in earnings/income. Money that is already made by corporations tends to become inactive which is what stays in the company’s pockets when corporate tax is decreased. The company may pay more in dividends, but that is often also dead money because it doesn’t get spent for a long time in many cases (esp 401k’s).

The biggest lie corporations have told governments and the general public is that they need to pay less taxes to employ citizens while also keeping those citizens wages as low as possible so they can continually post record profits. We’re coming to the top of that bubble and either corporations need to pay their employees more (shifting the tax burden to income tax which can be supported because of higher income) or they need to pay more taxes on their profits. The top of the bubble isn’t as far away as we’d like to think... then EVERYONE is screwed

Technical analysis and news cycle supports there will likely be at least a small dip early next week. A large crash is unlikely unless you start seeing 'lockdown 2.0' or 'shelter in place'' in the news. Momentum of this week is unlikely to persist and a lot of stocks were unable to break through resistance. A lockdown or at least regional lockdowns are likely in the future. Will there be another hard crash? Hard to say unless there is literally a nationwide lockdown which is unlikely in a Trump presidency.

Huge run up with assumed Biden victory already. And it may not dip with the rest of the market. 

Vestas (VWDRY) is a pure wind play. They are largely vertically integrated and manufacturing most parts of their product. In some cases they’ve sold off manufacturing facilities for some components but then purchase 100% of the production from facilities they sold. Good business, due for an upgrade vs Trump being very anti wind.

While I highly encourage everyone to savor this moment and let out a sigh of relief, know that this fight is not over. Georgia will be having 2 run off elections and this is incredibly important if we want to give our President a fighting chance at getting anything done in the Senate.

If you can afford it, please consider donating to either Jon Ossoff [here](https://electjon.com/), Raphael Warnock [here](https://warnockforgeorgia.com/), or the amazing Fair Fight organization headed by Stacey Abrams [here](https://fairfight.com/). 

If you have the time, please consider phone banking for either of these candidates; Ossoff’s phone bank is already in motion and you can get more info [here](https://www.mobilize.us/electjon/) and Warnock’s phone bank starts up on 11/22 and you can get more info [here](https://www.mobilize.us/warnockforgeorgia/).

If you didn’t register to vote in GA for the general election, you can still register to vote and vote in the runoff! If you turn 18 before 12/7 you can still register to vote for this election! Register to vote in GA [here](https://georgia.gov/register-to-vote).

If you are registered to vote in GA, you can already request your mail in ballot for this election [here](https://ballotrequest.sos.ga.gov/)

My total confusion is how so many people who I otherwise respect and love are head over heals into his game.  Other than reddit I just keep my mouth shut anymore cause I have already lost friends over this shit and theres others I don't want to lose.

I hope after he goes away things will calm down but I think thats naive.
If you search for **biggest loser** on Twitter: https://imgur.com/gallery/s3q12uA
Why’s that
Thanks for the reply! 

Makes sense, but isn’t that kind of part of the deal though? Like buying into a collection of potential exponential growers and high growth industries instead of just TSLA. Like my portfolio is mostly ETF’s, some centered on specific industries and some that follow the broader market. But I would imagine this would be an ETF with a higher risk/return potential.

Please correct me if I’m wrong. I am pretty new to all of this

Thinking of dropping over a grand on 25 March 19th $175 SPY Puts for an end of the world type scenario....  A miserable Covid Winter, Stimulus stalemate, Civil Unrest caused by Mango refusing to leave, and the GOP likely return to worrying about the "deficit" in order to strangle a Biden Presidency right from the start...  I figure Covid will peak around the quarter million per day range around mid February, due to Mango not giving fuck all about it and the government starved of funds due to McConnell fuckery, before Biden can start to bring the spread under control.  This could cause a Market crash even greater than what we saw in March....  So, if Spy tanks by around 50%, my thousand dollar bet could skyrocket to $30,000+ by mid February....hmm.
Printing money because of all the red??? So like March?

4hour: Spy pullback in September rsi was 79 (hovered in the 70s from 8/25-9/4) Spy pullback in October rsi was 81. We’ve been flirting with 70s to high 60s. I’m not saying it wants to dump, because the macd on the daily crossed bullish and momentum started picking up. But the 4 hour is crossing bearish and momentum just pooped out.

First of all
1. Trump is a Narcissist. He doesn't give a F about your or about your family. I don't care what side you are on of the party. As a president you are suppose to protect the country.
2. I would have voted for Trump if he AT LEAST try to shut down and country for few weeks. but NO. He did NOTHING and look at the skyrocket covid cases we having. He only cares for himself and for his re-election.

Instead he try to persuade people to NOT WEAR MASk. Doesn't need mask. Guess why he lost the votes ? His supporters are dead because of covid and he lost the votes because of them. So there you have it
Oh yeah, they’ve already signaled that,

I have mixed feelings because XOM is being hurt hard by the dividend, and everyone is speculating how much it will hurt their dividend holders if they pause or reduce it. But I'm wondering if the market would rocket the stock if they announced a dividend cut or halt, since that would be a lot of money not "lost" to dividends.

A halt of that 10% dividend is basically as good as a huge stock buyback, the only question is whether they'd ever actually do it.

I so want to see him sit there stewing in anger as Biden gets inaugurated, but I know he wont even show up.  

I hope they put a carboard cutout of him like they have been doing at baseball games.
Biden said he won’t run for a second term so I guess you don’t like Biden
What’s a good play next week
Promote him out

No they’re fucked because greedy ass schools are sitting on millions in funds but have exponentially increased tuition since boomers went to school while decreasing professors wages and relying on underpaid TA’s to decrease costs and increase profits. 

Also your personal taxes are fucked because corporations have “convinced” governments that they need to pay less taxes to employ their citizens while simultaneously posting maximum profits by keeping those citizens wages as low as possible. The tax burden then falls to citizens like you. 

Don’t get me wrong, I like my stonks to go up but Global Corporate has been fucking the people of the free market for decades

The last thing anyone needs is Joe biden doing anything.

As to wether the democrats actually instigate any major changes...if the people who have literally 90% of the capital tell them to they will.
Biden win feels like a green Monday, but if I’m so certain it’s green that means it definitely will be red. But if it’s definitely red that means it must be green. But if it must be green it’s certainly red. But if it’s certainly red then ....

> Don't trust what any country says about reserves and production capabilities concerning oil

This is about natural gas reserves though and they are proven reserves. 


... And how much the US has is not really relevant. I am pointing out that Russia and Iran can easily cover that supply. 

> The biggest issue for China imo is that you have to at least give the public the appearance they are free like in America or they will eventually stop being productive and grow hostile.

I don't think most Chinese are envious of America on that point. The US global image is in complete tatters. You can't even comment on China's poor human rights record anymore without a Chinese diplomat replying "i can't breathe" in response. 

> Also their water supply is basically poison.

Are you talking about China or the US in that comment? Because it rings true for much of America too. Lead levels are waaay above the accepted amount in many states.

Bro, you obviously don’t know how to understand current events in comparison to the past or American culture in general. There were barely any riots, and they were child’s play in comparison to riots in the past. Stop letting Fox News scare you. Follow the least bias news sources you can find if you want to actually understand current American culture.

It’s mild in comparison to historical data about riots and civil disobedience. Millions of people marched against police brutality, and a few thousand people actually rioted. Open a history book before you make assumptions about current US culture. Just the LA riots of the 90’s make this years riots look like child’s play. Like I said, millions of people peacefully marched.

I looked very very briefly.. but that simply seems like they are the owners of B shares that become A shares over time.. You'll notice that the B shares are diminishing over time as they become A shares.  

I'd assume at one point there won't be any "non-controlling interest" reported. 

I might be completely wrong so let's definitely try to figure this out... cause yes, this seems like a massive opportunity. Basically the float is super low and no one seems to be looking at the opportunity. Nobody seems to be giving a shit about the company.

SECDEF: Chaos Marine Mattis. He was and still is perfect for the job. He actually stood up to Trump.

Eternal CEO of America: JPow of course

CEO of Health: Big Tony

Secretary of Free Tendies: Andrew Yang
His party doesn’t make Catholicism part of their agenda, though
He did not commit any crimes. It is what we call, 'propaganda'. See what happens in the mainstream media and large corporations peddle out an idea to citizens in-order to get them to, 'think' a certain way. If you can possibly look at this in a bi-partisan fashion it is easy to see the level of propaganda has been quite astonishing. The elite that control the media basically control the minds of the citizens. It is actually a very scary thing and historically this happens prior to countries changing over to communism and totalitarian rule. By the time Democrats decide they don't like the direction we are headed.. It will be too late to turn back. At this point republicans and democrats will unite as citizens; together under the iron-fist of authoritarianism.

Also wanted to add this is all the game man. Remember this corporate cut was 14% you got 4%. Biden will ar some point come out "strong" against corporations and will talk about increasing corporate taxes by 10%. Everyone will spew the same lines

"Ruin jobs" "jobs leaving" blah blah blah. It will pass and dema will cheer it repubs will boo it but the reality they still got a 4% tax cut and a bigger cut than the people. Its the game.

It looks exactly like SPY/QQQ?
i think i wanna maximize gamma, but TBH i have no idea how to figure that out. 

also i want to look at the gamma positioning of the currently open options to get an idea of target price

i'm thinking about dec expiries. my whole strategy with PLTR options was feb thru may ones because i thought it woudl take awhile for the rocket ship to get going since the direct listing meant that there were shares that were going to be unloaded. as soon as it started to move i was going to buy nearer dated calls so i'm going to continue through with that strategy
On it boss.

When I was like 12 years old they used to have a "triple the meat" updgrade at Wendys. One time I got a Dave Triple  and tripled the meat.  9 quarters pound patties.  I think i was the only person who ever utiliized that menu option becaus all the employees were very suprised. Ate the whole thing.
We’ll see in a couple years... I don’t own anything in danger of bankruptcy (yet) so going to hope for the best.
Well unfortunately for him, gambling losses follow a different set of tax rules. You can only deduct gambling losses against gambling winnings, plus you need to be a professional gambler. Options and stock gains are not gambling per the IRS. If he made 5 million in gains and lost 5 million betting on Trump, he better hope he put money aside for taxes lol. RIP 5mil Trump man.

Why do you want to ban a stock from being posted when people are making so much money from it ? You against making money or something ??

homie i'm like pretty fucking deep in FNKO i feel the same way you don't have to convince me

the onlythign that makes me nervous is their ownership structure with FAH. They own like 49% of that holding company, their IPO was actually to buy a piece in FAH. I saw the line item in their financials which is what made me curious about what it meant coz i didn't understand, and tbh i still don't understand how that ownership structure works because I think FAH holds some of FNKO too? that's the only thing keeping me from going eyeballs deep in this TBH. but yeah i'm knee deep and with you this company is looking like a classic value play
Yeah of course.. just found it funny when I saw this

Well hey I’m at the 17k and I started with 2k a year ago
No doubt, but that should be the AG’s job not necessarily overseen by Biden since there is supposed to be separation (obviously Trump never understood that)

Stores were being boarded up by people overreacting. NYC saw 2300 murders in 1980. They have seen less than 200 so far this year. The riots of this year were extremely mild in comparison to the riots of the 90’s, 60’s etc. What we are seeing is the effect from everybody having a phone with internet and social media. 99% of protestors this year were peaceful. I know that there is no cure for autism, but god damn son. Put on a helmet or something before you step into the arena.

Right? Just goes to show how much emotion is stirred by MSM.. MSM turns away from Covid headlines to focus on erection headlines, Covid magically disappears as an issue, suddenly doesn't affect economy anymore, doesn't affect markets anymore..
This is true. They're acting like dude who asks like a giant dick getting voted out is a huge surprise. He was so annoying that even voters who typically vote R down the ticket didn't want him anymore.
Oh man I loaded up March 18th believing it would never get that low again... whoopsiedoodle. Always meant as long term but still annoying considering everything else mooned.
Trump criticizes Trump is my fav
Yeah it was Uber too so they paid out well
Yes. They put rioting aside for one day and are meeting en-masse in Washington D.C. to pay homage to their communist overlords.

Twitter accounts to follow ?
You totally misinterpreted that tweet lol
"A few months ago they would all have been ban, a spit upon and know everybody is sucking nio and xpeng ball like there is no tomorrow!"

A few months ago NIO was trading at a couple bucks a share, you're spitting the same bullshit people said months ago r/pennystocks that it was a "pump and dump", a "scam", "chinese garbage". Go cry somewhere else, you still have plenty of time to make buku money off NIO, it's far from over. Re-evaluate your attitude and don't be biased simply because it's a chinese stock. You ever even been to china?? I have, they're all like well oiled parts to a machine. They are hustlers, only thing that's gross is they spit indoors
fuck it i’m going back in
Really isnt that much compared to others here. If you look at my 5 year chart though, it literally looks like the inverse of Tesla's 5 year. Bad decision after bad decision.

On Nov 2 I sold 1000 TLRY 20C 011521 for a 20% loss. AMA.
Which tells nothing other than people really hated Trump? That's not a world-changing revelation. 

Hell, if there was any race that would've been rigged, it'd have been McConnell's. He's been an asspain to Democrats for decades.

Adobe Suite autist here; It's called rotoscoping. Just take Trump talking somewhere else, cut it out, feather it, track it on Wolf of Wall Street man's face, and dub over him talking.

Great let's keep the numbers out of it. 

The kids write each other and communicate on tik tok plenty, but you're right, they mainly use Instagram, messenger, and imessage for that. In fact, kids joke constantly about snapchat being for old people and dead now, which is their (slowly dropping) main "user base". The only thing propping it up is adults using it to take nude pics behind their partners backs without a paper trail.

In fact, snap has desperately been trying to pivot to a media app model and be relevant with news clips and sponsored posts. Alas alack. Their ads format internally is great though.
Second day in a row GME has been green. Monday and Tuesday dip then the rest of the week is green.

Dividend is good (when its paying), and 100 shares gets you qualified for X plan. It aint gonna make you a quick buck but it's a solid hold.
I’ll actually go ahead and ask this. If I do get an answer from anyone at Palantir I’ll update you.

"Currently having contracts with the US government among other entities and owning a large portion of the market space for analyics based products. what is the future outlook of palantir and where do you see it expanding in the future? Also, what other competitors, if any, are competing within palantirs market sector?"

Remember, the only way someone like Trump gets elected is as a response to the Obama admin pushing things too far in the other direction. They just did it more quietly than Trump. 

A Biden admin would be very wise to moderate what they try to, or else it will happen again.

Yeah, I know, there were some good things in the tax breaks.  I'm not arguing against that.  My personal opinion is that I don't think the tax changes should be rolled back, I just hope if they do it they bring something to counterbalance the negative consequences to people who need it.

And Trump did not increase it.  They added it back when Rubio announced that he'd refuse to sign without it.  It ended up getting increased.  Trump shouldn't get any credit for it.

Lmfao bro the middle class makes too much for the Democrats to give a shit about them and for the republicans to little. Two parties don’t work for the middle class they work for themselves.
Clearly what he is saying is that had Trump won the illegal vote that the radical left would be burning everything to the ground where-as the republicans are much more responsible. You have a hard time interpreting things. Trump; however, did win the LEGAL vote and that what matters. There will be massive audits taking place and supreme court rulings. The riots will begin as Trump maintains the presidency once uncovering the blatantly obvious illegal votes and fraud.
Free. Laughing my man tits off
Let’s see the all time
Probably not the GOP but Trump's team. Mango doesn't know what it means to be a father so they calculated wrong
He's definitely wrong about Canada. You either use the provincial plan, or you have to pay fully out of pocket. Unless you are in the .1% or .01% bracket, you'll find it hard to ever justify the private option by paying 100% of the cost.
Nothing you’ve said is true and your both sides shit is tired 

Go away throwaway

Trump literally violated the debate rules and showed u without a negative test and claims he didn’t take one

Nah, that’s January. Still got Trump for a few more months .
He’s basically powerless at this point. Worst he can do is incite his worshippers to riot, which may happen. The market gives no shits about civil unrest though.

what? settle down. Chill. ordinarily Presidents concede. when an election is close, the incumbent president is refusing to concede and alleging fraud, and his party is backing him, things can get messy. There is a real scenario here in which House republicans pick the president, regardless of what happens in the courts. The Constitution allows for that. 

my point was that none of this has been invalidated, and yet volatility and shorts still got crushed.

Canada doesn't really have private healthcare. It's single-payer so unless you are going to pay fully out of pocket, you'll have to use the same provincial plan as everyone else. Which is why you'll have trouble finding decent family doctors. All the good doctors leave for the U.S. because it pays better.

The "private healthcare" is for dentists and optometrists. 

>The Canada Health Act, which sets the conditions with which provincial/territorial health insurance plans must comply if they wish to receive their full transfer payments from the federal government, does not allow charges to insured persons for insured services (defined as medically necessary care provided in hospitals or by physicians). Most provinces have responded through various prohibitions on such payments.

Depends how much they took out and the interest rates on the loans. As an example, my mix interest rate on my $50k loans is around 4%. Guess what? I’m taking my time paying it off because my money will work harder in the stock market than paying down the loan.

I got like 15k in that stock and I'm not selling Monday already doubled my portfolioe with it I still think it's undervalued even if there will probably be a temporary pullback.
zero transparency, zero recourse, zero oversight.

I happen to have a low opinion of the economic environment and government policies in China, but this runs far deeper.

With these stocks people essentially forfeit control of their capital to who knows who for who knows what, with nothing but the hope they won't be left holding the stub when the candle eventually runs out.

Umm..trump is the one who increased the tax credit per child.  I know...I have kids. Lol. And he lowered small business taxes.  It helped us out a lot. We are self employed but not even close to being rich.  I make about 90k after expenses and that gets taxed.    

Why do you think small businesses with black, or other POC vote for Donald trump? For fun?  No. It's tax breaks.  

We all know the guy is an asshole but he saves regular mom and pop shops money.
Now that Biden is president do we get free record players for our children?
Yeah right now maybe but in 2 years I’ll be a stallion after my jelq sessions
See this is a classic progressive response all superficial attacks of the president or race or whatever but nothing solid never policy . It’s so painfully clear trump won and the media , dnc, gop are doing everything in their power to see him lose the election. If you support this shit your not an American and you should have left the country when you said you would last election

Disagree on this a bit. Most musicians are inspired by something or are trying their hardest to get a message out or get famous or whatever. That's a shit ton of inspiration. 

Once you get famous though it's a bitch to stay motivated. Also it sucks being a musician for more than a few years, the lifestyle is brutal. That drains a lot of energy and motivation.

You can argue all you want about the validity of their economic models and the risks associated with companies operating under a totalitarian regime...

..But if you actually performed a tiny bit of dd you'll find that these stocks are absolutely worthless regardless. The traded stocks are somewhat collateralized by real company shares, but there's no way of enforcing this. SEC has no jurisdiction, you've got no recourse, and whatever you think you know about what your investment is about, it's most likely limited or outright wrong.

-75% on my Jan exp. what really pisses me off is everything else is crushing it. If everything was still down it would be fine. But literally any other shit play and we would probably be fine.
Except you forget to mention Trump is the definition of short-termism, those tax cuts were not fiscally responsible and in the long run would be bad for the country. If you'd rather have 6k than a responsible president who will actually lead the US into the 21st century I don't really know what to say.

His antics would only have to lead to you not making money for one year and it would be 25-years of that extra 4%. Leaders like him are the kind that create economic busts.

And if you will ever have kids, a small reduction in healthcare costs and college fee's would save you that 6k many times over.

Last example, stock prices, check if this is true if you want:

>Your first reaction should be that the S&P 500 index doesn’t really care if a president is a Democrat or a Republican. The index keeps marching higher regardless of who is in the White House.  
>  
>But upon closer inspection, it looks like between 1968 – 1978 and 2000 – 2009, both periods under Republican presidents, the S&P 500 didn’t go anywhere. In contrast, the S&P 500 has advanced higher under every Democratic president since 1933.

There’s a little more to it than that now: low interest rates mean nobody wants to keep money in the bank, people have saved a lot more money this year than usual (I understand that the service industry hasn’t, but aside from the service industry professionals in here losing their stimulus money, the service industry ain’t investing anyways) and they need somewhere to put it, the resources of the federal reserve make the US one of the safest places in the world to invest.  US stock market is going higher (with maybe a few bumps) and so is residential real estate.

"The transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings. Amazon declined to comment on the latest sale.

Bezos has previously said he sells about $1 billion of Amazon stock each year to fund his rocket start-up, Blue Origin. Additionally, the Amazon CEO in February [launched](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/17/amazons-jeff-bezos-pledges-10-billion-to-launch-earth-fund-for-combating-climate-change.html) a $10 billion Earth Fund to combat the effects of climate change, which will issue grants to scientists, activists and other organizations."

Idk, republicans gotta start catering to students if they want any shot at 2024. They ignore climate change, student debt, etc., all the topics young people care about on both sides. I dont foresee free college, but generous help with loans is definitely a possibility.

I think stimulus and student loans get bipartisan support. Stimulus was only being held out on because of the election. We'll have another by February. Ironically, they'll be no help on healthcare. Republican constituents are vehemently opposed to that, and young people are generally healthy and don't care

Literally just looked at the stacks to double check myself and I was right. Snapchat has 200m DAU, Insta 500m, and Tik Tok 800m with at least 100m of those being American from 2019 and they haven't released 2020 numbers I can find.

Snap is jumping on an 18% yoy growth use which is embarrassingly low considering there was a global pandemic.
not really tho. have you seen pics of the events ? anyways, the cloth masks that 99% of people are wearing only lower odds by about 5-10%. No one is wearing the proper masks except officials

The difference between this and Republican super spreader events is these people wear masks.  It’s that simple and 90+ % effective according to top health officials.  Amazing how simple it is yet one party decided to make it a political issue while getting themselves all sick.
should happen on its own, if the bogus election holds then get ready for major shit storm. just think about the taxes alone. once they raise taxes on corporations and individuals, prices are going to go through the roof AND inflation is going to be hitting at the same time. ive talked to two doctors and they are seriously about to leave the profession because of prospect of socialized medicine.  get ready folks shit is about to get real in america. its going to be the most epic collpase ever, because its going to be coupled by a dollar collapse... and there is dementia joe to figure it all out. how sad for america.

Yeah I get it.  They're trying to bring other tax breaks that actually help middle class, like increasing child tax credit (it costs a lot to raise a kid, whether you're rich or poor)

Trump tried to eliminate the $2,000 child tax credit btw, as it is welfare, which is bad.  Marco Rubio was the one guy who refused to vote for it until that was put back in.  If that credit was removed I would have ended up paying more, with household income about $103k that year.

I am talking about statistics. The chance that at least 1 individual commits fraud in any election on a low level is 99,999%. 

The group of potential people who would cross the line gets bigger the more of an asshole the candidate is. Hence, there will be quite some individuals who committed fraud in this election on a low level. It adds up.
A lot better to look at than pence. I'd put those melon$ in my mouth
His campaign speeches lately were gold tbh. Some nice humor in there, too
i miss complete sentences too
Trump will concede within a week and promise to have a peaceful transition, while at the same time stating he believes he was robbed.
Which is what scares me.

He was going to lose anyway. I don’t think him catching corona had anything to do with it. Very little people switch opinions going into an election and I doubt tens of thousands of people per state would switch their opinion on trump just bc he caught COVID.

Follow your own advice. AP wouldn't have called it if the outcome was uncertain. Court cases would only account for the tiniest of a fraction of a percent. 

I know it's hard, but please try to look at just the facts here and take bias out of it.

Also - you went from saying, "Tbh, it’s really not looking good for Biden in PA" to saying, "it’s an uphill battle for Trump" within 2 comments. So... you really want to pretend you know the odds in PA?

- It’s always a risk when local gov swings legal banhammers at the blink of an eye.  
- they’re very worried about a US civil war...Because their soccer team will drop a place if US breaks in 2. 🤡
  
Do what you want with this.
He pissed off enough people that they voted against him.  That's not fraud. Elections in the US are decentralized and handled in very small sections. The massive level of coordination to cause fraud would come out, it would require county-level officials all over to be involved.
ZM to 600?
You should go lick doorknobs to build up your immunity.
Hunter hit that.
Just curious what effect do congressional republicans have on the outcome of a presidential election?

I’ll give you a hint - none
They’re saying basically nothing...
lol
She was in the middle of a run right? I would too.
nope Mitch will act like the deficit & debt actually matters again and will block anything to make Biden look good.
Will we ever find out if Mike Pence was a robot all along?

Probably not a great idea lol

She was out for a jog when she got the call, thats just raw human emotion.
Ban
Dipped in and out early on, then left it in. Made 20k so far.
Wind turbines that also disperse weed smoke like incense burners. Continental hot boxing.
Lmao, this MAGAtard needs to write a $5k check to WSB or risk ban
This gonna sound uneducated and retarded. But if Mango doesn’t concede power I just imagined the Secret Service just dragging him out. And that would be that.

Also I saw some shit today that Tucker Carlson is supposedly considering 2024... Imagine how dumb that would be
You mean my Robinhood account
A few months ago I got banned for saying “Nancy hates America” but now I’m reading shit like Nancy Pulpussy (lmao)

RULES R RIGGED!!
Oh shit, this looks like free money! Someone saying a nickel company is about to pop off? I'm in
Attempting to usurp democracy with unfounded nonsense? Trying to stop legal votes from being counted? Being mentally unstable during a lame duck period? Spreading misinformation to rile up his base to riot and intimidate election workers? The list goes on. The man should not have access to nukes rn

Man idk... I’m going to have to think about that. Might have to phone a friend

lol 😂
What lol, that didnt answer my question bud.


Your saying you want more people to go cash gang if they believe Bidens health is plummeting.


I'm asking you why you would want this.
The Manhattan DA, NY AG, and Southern District of NY DoJ have cases ready to go.  I suspect we start seeing things filed as soon as 1/21/21.
Puts on QANON
Make a SeekingArrangement if you're serious, I'm sure there's old rich dudes that'll buy you nice dinners and vacations. You'll have to suck a few dicks though. And maybe take a couple in the pooper.

Free college or even a bailout for loans? Never can happen

The Senate won’t give us all $1,000.... does anyone believe they will erase trillions in student loan debt?

This post here.  This needs to be in a textbook of the future as the perfect example of what went wrong with humanity before the war that almost ended the species.
Yes
All the moves were overnight on futures while trading hours actually sold down every move then gapped up on futures and then sold down again all week. Definitely stocks are getting off loaded. Going to be a nasty sell the news week.
Because wealthy donors put pressure on the RNC and DNC to make sure all candidates are friendly to wealth.
Why are people unable to see why a guy who spent the last 4 years pissing people off, then botched the most important challenge of his presidency would end up losing by what’s looking to be a significant margin. He spent his entire presidency appealing solely to his base, and his base is a minority in this country. People who didn’t drink this guys koolaid in general didn’t like him because he gave them no reason to.
It’s razor thin at that margin right now, likely to be within that margin based on the most recent numbers we have seen. It’s all going to come down to how the courts rule on this votes. So, it’s an uphill battle for Trump, but calling a win for Biden at this point would be inaccurate and irresponsible. 

I know it’s hard, but please try to look at just the facts here and take bias out of it. The facts are that it’s far too close to call, and with the pending court cases it could get even muddier.
Exactly! Everyones holding calls right now so what do you think will make them the most money right now?
I thought I was supposed to say that
They should put him on a no fly list before he escapes.

>See ya next Tuesday for the premiere of Not My President season 2! 🤣
I’m not a Trump supporter. What part of my post do you even disagree with? 

His message was always that the pandemic was overblown and we should just get over it. He got COVID, recovered, and went back to massive rallies hugging non-masked crowds. He continued talking about how we should go back to business as usual and scientists and health officials are dumb. The fact that hundreds of thousands have died and that he personally had the best treatment possible with new, experimental therapies didn’t factor into the messaging.
65 cents per contract? I guess that's not bad.
Just curious.. what are Congressional Republicans saying about Biden's victory?
[deleted]
Nice. I guess timing was perfect. Was it mostly driven by tech?
Yes.. "they would pay you more if they could" HA, keep drinking that koolaid.
4 more years of straight pumps if senate stays red. Some Funds are already telling their customers to expect 7% overall market climb by end of 2021.

Senate goes blue though...? Game over
no he becomes president

the reason we aren't seeing 500 million dead is because of modern medicine. they didnt have ventilators or anti virals in 1919 you dunce
Why not diversify and do both
Oof
I hate Trump, but it isn't quite over. There are some strange discrepancies that need to be confirmed, as you'd expect with any election, much less one with record turn out and massive numbers of mail in ballots.  I do not think any of that is going to change a single result. It will however lead to a crazy news cycle and Twitter rampages.
This rhetoric is really getting old. There is 1.2 guns per 1 American citizen (registered guns that is). I’ll play along with your theory tell me how you’re going to go about collecting those? I live on 12 acres you gonna come metal detect my land? It’s impossible to “take our guns” so you hillbillies can stfu about it already.
Or Nikki Haley... plz...
I should probably look up what Salesforce exactly does but I was more under the impression that since advertising and SAAS. Were expected to have rough quarters. You can find the advertising aspect in PINS, SNAP and GOOG. So we should’ve easily guessed TTD would follow suit.
He did a commencement address at Harvard too lmao
Yup. Just so happens that the 4-year  Trump experience was enough for even the most undecided of voters.
lol
I don’t know what this has to do with wsb but man it made me laugh

The election isn’t really disputed. There’s a sore loser remaining true to form, but there’s incredibly strong consensus this is settled.

The saga doesn't with him losing reelection.
Everyone hedged up for a disputed election, and when that exact scenario happened we immediately abandoned our hedges and randomly pumped the markets back to ATH. 

Now we are all balls deep LONG and the incumbent still hasn't conceded or committed to peaceful transfer of power.

Just 2020 stuff

Well why would it stay up? We’re transitioning to sustainable energy (electric energy) and oil isn’t one of them. Every car company is transitioning to EV either now or soon or else they will become bankrupt.

The funny thing is that Trump is probably right: He probably lost because of election fraud. It's just not organized fraud, just individuals who hate him enough to decide this was their moment in life to make a stand. 

It adds up if you piss off enough people.
No, he’s been complaining about it for 6th months. It was obviously his strategy his entire time to contest the election.

I am so happy that the pandemic is finally over.  All the Biden supporters don't have to drive up to be part of a rally.  They can celebrate in the streets like everyone else.  

I am so glad for the Biden campaign that the pandemic was still in full force when people had to vote so they could be safe and vote by mail!  Funny how that is not an issue anymore and everyone can dance in the street only inches away from each other.

On the bright side, I think stocks go up for a host of reasons.  Here is my advice to all conservatives that believe the election was rigged.  \*\*\* MAKE AS MUCH FUCKEN MONEY AS YOU CAN. Make more than your fair share and leave everyone in the dust. At the end of the day, this is America and the American dream is still intact.  Put the politics aside because they don't matter. Retiring healthy, happy, and with more money than everyone else does!
Depends if you mean oil companies or oil prices. Oil prices may recover, but that’s not enough to save oil companies if demand remains low partially as a result of higher prices.

Let that sink in - THE MOST SECURE GROUNDS IN USA
No it wouldn't be exercised if TQQQ dropped below your strike. Selling a call when you have the shares to cover is what a covered call is.

Basically if you sold a 150c for 42$ a share (4200 overall) you would break even if TQQQ drops to 109 on the strike date from your 42$ premium collected (based on a 151 share price). So it does help downside risk in this way, but it also limits your gains since if TQQQ goes above 193 you will basically be losing money from the covered call.
Work out what the presidency alone can do
That’s not how calling it works

Virgin Galactic would be a good place to start.

Under the Obama - Biden administration they progressed private companies going in where NASA was operating prior.  This led to Space X, Blue origin, Virgin Galactic and others to become more proximate roles in the space industry.

Yeah I manage a branch and if this happened out of one of our accounts I'd get an email about it from our Overdraft officer to offset out of any other accounts (savings etc.) And turn off debit cards as well. 

We'd likely close the account once it was repaid as well. 

Hope you have a good explanation 🙂

Not manufactured fraud allegations and not 4+ states with 30k vote margins that if they do a recount would come out to appx the same result.  Maybe there could be a recount in GA but Biden didn't need GA to win

Believe me - I don't think socialism is the way to go. However, I think a president who understands economic policy better than Trump (which is not saying much) is important. Trump was clueless on economic issues. A bit of taxation can actually lead to economic growth, when implemented correctly. That's what we need. Not Trump's atrocious expansion of the deficit.

Sidenote: I find it difficult to believe that someone as idiotic as you has somehow found success in the U.S. If you really will experience an increase in taxes under Biden (which will only happen to those making >$400k/year supposedly), then I think that is all the evidence we need that the current economic system is based more on luck than merit.

The votes would most certainly not be eliminated. Also, a recount is only mandated in PA with a 0.5% or less margin, which is lower than Biden's current margin. 

It's over for Trump in PA. He lost.

So I am apolitical. I wanted Trump to win because stonks must go up. I'm heavy invested in the USA equity market which got a haircut in March and since recovered. 

What does Biden mean for the markets? I'm looking at my reallocation and investment instructions while everything is sitting in money market because I pulled my investments right before the election.

Do you think the market will go down until January/February and who do you think will be the corporate winners this election?

It was really stupid because the blue cities contribute the vast majority to the federal budget on a net basis. Like If you want to piss off NYC and Cali that's your game, but if they withhold federal taxes for 6 days the usGov is already bankrupt

Take a look at where Biden’s money has come from.

Your about to see a lot of BIPOC and women with surprisingly conservative views in roles at the SEC, Treasury, etc.

The hallmark of this administration will be “skin deep” change of minimal substance. 

Wait until you see the look on Lizz Warren’s face when she’s relegated to the sidelines of banking regulation. It’s gonna be a meme.
That's it Trump let your inner bear out
I don't know if I would have called this behavior prior to him getting elected in 2016.  After 2 weeks in office?  Yeah, I could see this coming a mile away.  Now we know it's possible for someone to have negative class.
It was one state that decided the election, by a tiny margin of votes. This is many states, by many votes.

Arizona and Florida have been mass mail in ballots for a very long time and they do it correctly. If you clean up the voter rolls there isn’t a problem, but a lot of states voter rolls are dirty.

Also Florida was counting the mail in ballots as they came in so there wouldn’t be such a mess at the end where it takes weeks to count all the ballots.
Media didn’t call the election 2 days ago because they were waiting for BIG BIG LARGE MASSIVE crowds to gather on the weekend. 

Seems legit.

Don't trust what any country says about reserves and production capabilities concerning oil, especially Middle Eastern ones. Nobody knows how much they actually have but can promise the US is grossly underestimating ours. I'm not saying China will collapse I'm just pointing out that most investors think they are going to be able to keep their economy growing at unrealistic rates.The biggest issue for China imo is that you have to at least give the public the appearance they are free like in America or they will eventually stop being productive and grow hostile. Also their water supply is basically poison.

Conspiracy theorists are dangerous af because you literally can't change their mind.


These people are all claiming mass fraud, based on basically nothing. So, they want it to go to court. Then it will go to court, and Trump will lose, and they'll all claim that the courts are rigged.

It's pretty fucking dangerous that so many Americans think this way now.

Yes i agree. China needs the US. But the US also needs China. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship. The US is still under the delusion that they can go at it alone though, so give them a couple of years and it'll eventually sink in. 

... And those countries might not be able to meet all of China's demand, but they sure will be able to fill most of it. Iran has the world's 2nd largest natural gas deposits and Russia has the largest. Both countries more than willing to sell all that China needs if they get logistics in order.

Not how it works. If BOTH parties are wearing a mask then chance of spread is virtually nonexistent. If the party with Covid isn’t wearing a mask & the uninfected individual is wearing a mask, there’s still a good chance he can get covid due to exposure from the eyes or breathing in a (much smaller than if they weren’t wearing a mask) viral load from the infected party. This information has been available for months.

you are going to lose al that money in one week max, then you are going to try to make it back for forever, trying to break even, like 3/4s of this sub. By the time you make it back, you'll have developed an addiction, and when'll you'll win very big, you'll lose it all again the next day. Welcome to WSB, where losing money is not only a leitmotiv, but also a lifestyle

I work in the industry and at current estimates those countries will not be able to keep up with Chinese demand and that doesn't take into account the suppliers not having adequate infrastructure to convert it to liquid form for transport.

Trumps master plan was to stack courts for the last 4 years just for this moment and they just said "No bro". Man that must hurt just a little bit.
Because we are the world's currency and all debts are denominated in USD, the majority of which is payable to US investors. If paying the debt ever becomes an issue, it will be the least of our problems. Some other world events will have already occurred and ruined our lives.
They’ve already been doing that (having impartial observers) which makes it even more ridiculous that Trump insists on doing this.
Google them and you’ll see they aren’t random.
So, I learned this valuable lesson after betting against DNKG. Don't fight the trend.

Question, if its explained to you what the difference is between legal ballots and illegal ballots, and which votes are being counted and which were set aside, will it affect your opinion?  Like, its ok to misunderstand because its confusing for everybody, but once you find the correct info, would you accept it?  Or are you permanently, staunchly of the opinion that everything currently being counted is illegal?
Maybe the real conspiracy is that they announced it today to get SNL ratings up.

That’s also true, and another reason why numbers are much higher now.

Been to Topeka. Believe it or not but had lunch (sandwiches made by Mrs L) with Alfred Landon at their home in Topeka. Alf Landon ran against Franklin D Roosevelt in the 1936 Presidential Election. FDR was at peak popularity so won by a landslide. Nevertheless, Landon became a respected GOP grandee. Took me to his den where he had memorabilia you wouldn’t believe. That was 1982. Knew his daughter Nancy Kassebaum.

I'll give him a tiny bit of credit, Obama came in when they were in the midst of a recession and stocks were already near their lowest iirc. Lotta room to go up when they're in the ground halfway to China.

Lockup ends sometime in March (180 days after listing).  80% of the shares remain in lockup.  Shareholders have been holding for a long time, and if there are any changes to the capital gains tax it may incentivize a sell off.  I'm super bullish on PLTR, but it could get bumpy in March or thereafter.

This is true. I don't think Democrats are naturally anticapitalist, but they certainly had to get in bed with some anticapitalist groups in order to make this happen. BLM the most obvious.

Luckily, the Senate seems like it will stay with Republicans, which will keep Dems from being able to give them a massive kickback right away.

Funny Babylon Bee article that’s true.

It's actually 🥭 with more votes for him and against him than anyone in history.
Lol they actually trade like bankrupt stocks. Up 100% just on news. And yes acb will prob go bankrupt, their debt load is way too high.
Fuck me they pulled it off youtube

Hey retards, would you pay $10 for a spy 380c 11/9? Fuck no yeah? 99% sure it’s worthless yeah?

Biden and Harris want to lower the age for Medicare so I’d invest in beneficiaries of Medicare and especially Medicare Advantage plans. Clover Health aka $IPOC is the most obvious one since it’s their only product but some of the larger healthcare entities will also have a slice of the pie.

I'm glad we got Trump out, but if you're a progressive this is like step 0.
Trump aged rapidly too but he's covered in thick orange paint and that squirrel on his head is still young

Lol you’re so tough and manly!!! Now lets see if you can run a mile without stopping
Well you may be right, but its obvious that you are in the minority. Trump rallys with 30k people each, and now libs piling into the streets by the 10s or 100s of thousand. Netheir side actually cares.

If you talk to any knowledgeable conservative you'd know FOX is a leftist leaning network minus: Tucker, Hannity, Ingraham & Gutfeld. The other 85% of the day has a left slant they try and masked with fake conservatism. 

Look who owns FOX, look who they trotted out as a moderator for the debate. They do not support Trump or the Republican party, they support the money coming in as the only "conservative" network and put up with Tucker & Hannity because they bring in the most viewership and cash. No other reason. All comes down to money.

> I also do not think that a failing state and failing big cities should decide the fate of the entire country

California is by no means perfect and does have some seriously weird laws but their economy is the size of a small country and tend to pay more into the federal government than they receive back. Just because you say it's a failing state/failing city doesn't make it so.

Also vote tabulation hasn't finished yet but so far Biden has 4m more than Trump... That's a pretty big gap.

Bannon was banned from Twitter like a day ago for tweeting that Fauci should be beheaded.

I know a lot of people will say low but Bidet is actually pals with Mitch so high after Jan. It might not be as big but it'll get done. Also factor in that mango might want to try to pass it to restore his image before he leaves.
So is Donald Trump aware he lost yet? I'd assume if he did know, we'd have a deluge of angry tweets to laugh at.
Did he actually say this ?
There’s kids on TikTok and twitter claiming they helped “overthrow” the government because Trump lost. Joe Biden is the most “governmenty” you can get rn. He was a senator for like 40 years and served two terms as Vice President. Dude is literally the most normal politician on the planet rn. If you had told anyone 8 years ago that Joe Biden would’ve been elected this year, no one would have batted a damn eye. Gen Z is losing their minds. 

Anyway, nasdaq all-time high coming shortly.
makes sense lol
VSTO shares my largest position. should continue to moon imo
I’m confused. Why have weed stocks pumped so hard on Biden being president? This man doesn’t endorse marijuana at all, he wants to decriminalize marijuana offenses but doesn’t have a policy promoting recreational use? He just wants states to do what they want with it which is kind of what they are doing now. Yeah I’m in calls tho

Chill out bro, just trying to discuss and wasn't coming at you. I just believe there's bigger threats and voting fraud is very minor compared as it is very minimal at most (yet to be proven in courts/law enforcement) . I think the whole Russia probe was way dragged out and minor too.

And Russia would definitely profit with him in office since trump has been pulling support from NATO and going hard against China.
Yeah, thats what I meant by correlation and causation. But whats the reason behind it?
Markets don't like uncertainty, so it's probably good news that the presidency is called.

Although markets were already been trending upwards since Biden was projected to win.

Considering there's a good chance Biden finishes with 306 votes, not likely. Especially after the last elections Supreme Court ruling stating that states could punish EC voters who go against their pledge. 

Of course that's assuming what state it is and if they have a faithless elector law on the books.
Nah that’s not the half of it. Impossible to describe the other stuff but it’s incredible

LOGI eps was 2.16

Lmfao yo you know you're going broke when you're having conferences in front of a hardware store. Shit that's like having graduation at a home depot
Yes... no one else is aggressive enough
It’s fun how little you know about how commerce works in your own country.
New tweet from Trumpland claiming he is no longer giving up his paycheck to you ungrateful bunch. He'll spend it on popsicles and pornhub /sarcasm
I had calls all day, market stagnated. Was expecting the drop so I flipped end of day. May have been a terrible mistake.
*boring
Yes sir.
Maybe I'm a robot or something I just don't understand why people are crying and emotional biden won. Like come on politicians don't care about you especially somebody who's been in it for 47 years it's all the same
That's pretty damn impressive.
Yeah it has? It's almost over +0.4% now
if everyone expecting a dump, probably pump
Did you bitch this much after every other prez election, because it's always the same thing.  Always.  This is just the first time a prez was frontloading and staging for it before the election.
Nah there’s like TA behind it, put your life savings into spy puts dawg
You now make me wonder what a mango with a light sprinkle of salt might taste like
Because it's not that hard to distinguish reality from "hallucination", as in the video I posted, because it's like a layering on reality rather than a replacement of it.  
Mushrooms I never liked because it's hard to tell - really schizo.  
Personally it's people that are hard to deal with on psychadelics - it's very hard to deal with social interactions and "performing" whereas trees and grass are pretty manageable unless you live near bears. It's even nice at night as long as there's enough light to see eg from the moon. Take a close friend or two, dose in the morning (spring is good, when the trees are flowering), eat chocolate, stay away from people who are doing "normal life stuff".
Calls on BIDN.

Fuck that noise, I'd rather live off of what I make gambling. Work is for the Plebs. You have to be a self harmer to want to work retail. I'd rather just end it all then have to be nice to customers.
Idk the T(ea) party has been evolving since early obama era, you could clearly see something like Trump would turn up from there.
Perma bear sez just let it play out without feeling bitter. If there's a pump then ride that but don't think it's going to be sustainable. Shit is fucked up.

Wooooosh
"National debt doesn't matter" bruh you cannot be serious
BI DEN 2020!!!
/u/iwantmyvices. also remember Trump was a big proponent of the birthism movement during the Obama-era. He didn't come out of nowhere. It was not the Trump people that found Trump, it was the collective effort of conservative-media, the GOP and loads of others.
Never heard this before.

And if you Yolo your money to over 100k and gamble all that on a single options play (if you don't already have a mid 6 figures paying job) you're fucking dumb
Damn did everyone just forget about covid?? The crowd in front of the White House is crazy
IMO next couple weeks will be slow climb and as we get close to transition and then the notion of more restrictions are coming will kick in that will bring a rug pull by January
I kinda understand wanting to buy puts after last week's rally. However, Friday seems to kinda have taken care of that. Are you really expecting a further pullback after everyone getting shitfaces on a Bidenwin this weekend?

I just wonder how much money I could make if I buy 100$ worth of hacked US emails from some random russian dude and start sending emails like this.
I’d actually do more than 100 put credit spreads, but I have assets tied up in other trades like PYPL, and BABA
I think that we already rallied on the prospect of a Biden presidency. Now it's about how much damage Trump can make before he's gone and the going back to normal after covid. I got some VXX just in case, but I don't care of they tank.
Well he didn’t win the popular vote by a lot as far as the total population of the country goes. I’m simply saying that to say that all trump supporters are fat white guys is not true. This country is very much split. I also do not think that a failing state and failing big cities should decide the fate of the entire country

Shoutout to the Republicans that voted for Biden. It may have been hard to do, and I'm sure you guys will vote for your new man/woman in 2024 (hell I'll do it if Biden turns out terrible), but I think it's safe to say most of America is thankful for your help in ending the gaslighting absurdity of the last several years.

This one's looking pretty good
Jesus. is the virgin brigade still looking for sources about what everyone already knows. Is Elon a source of inspiration to you? Do you also hope to find someone that will marry you for the money?
I agree with you. For a while I was puzzled because I couldn't figure out why he was doing this, without a clear plan. I thought to myself... he must have a plan...

But I think the plan he had, depended on a lot of people supporting him through this. I think Trump thought there would be hundreds of thousands of alt right, red necks in the streets demanding for him to remain president. I think he thought the GOP would pull out all the stops to keep him in power. I think he thought the whole right wing movement would have his back to the bitter end.

I think Trump thought he was a demigod in Washington DC, and all his supporters were his subservient serfs.

But I think he grossly miscalculated all this.

My bet now is that he is a sinking ship and everyone who had anything to do with him is going to stab him in the back, to save their own career.

This guy is getting Julius Caesar'd starting next week.

Fox and Ben Shapiro have already abandoned him.

Fox fucked him on election night and shortly thereafter, his chief social media influencer, Shapiro, contradicted Trump's tweet within minutes of Trump claiming fraud.

The "protests" at the counting stations have been pathetic. The best video clip they could get was like 25 people chanting with minimal enthusiasm. Quite frankly a municipal politician could pull together a better rally.

I saw some GOP senator has already thrown him under the bus.

I'm sure all the Republican staffers, senators, congress members and right wing lobbyists are already trying to figure out their new play to keep their careers in a post Trump world. They're going to flee to the nearest pay cheque they can find in a new reality where republican jobs are fewer, and Trumpian loyalty is no longer rewarded.

The only way this thing plays out, is if the GOP controlled SCOTUS feel they have a legal argument, moral grounds and enough public support to make a historically insane Supreme Court ruling in a grey area issue in favour of Trump.

My bet is that at the very end Pence and SCOTUS take the high road and don't help Trump out when push finally comes to shove.

Pence is loyal to Trump, but he is also a deeply religious man. I don't think he will be able to completely abandon his morals when it comes down to it.

As far as SCOTUS goes, I just don't think they are going to rip the nation in half to appease Donald Trump's ego. They would do it if half the nation was behind them, but at this point I just don't see that level of support for this coup.

Again, I am a right winger and I was hoping Trump would win. But this guy has completely ruined his legacy, because I think the left was correct about him. He is a fucking immature, narcissistic, delusional baby, who has always gotten his way his whole damn life and no one has ever told him NO.

TLRY earnings too
Dude if chick fil a was public I'd buy the shit out of their stock. Even when they got mired in the LGBT controversy, the very common opinion I heard was "yeah fuck them for their stupid religious shit but I'm not boycotting their chickens too good". 

Their revenues are amazing and they make good fucking food. Too bad there's none near me :(

Look at the fucking open interest on deep OTM Jan calls on RIOT and MARA. I suspect some of these shitcoin "whales" are going to pump the fuck out of it. Or maybe dump and they're writing calls. Either way the fact there are stocks on a commodity so easily manipulated is hilarious.

Yeah but will he? It will be GOP money that is being spent. I wouldn't be surprised if he were bankrolled by some supporters to do it but it's basically burning money. Additionally, it will be extremely expensive.

It was new comments where I saw this. I was lurking in the sub for like 2 mins. Every sub has a few bad apples and I agree it's not fair to group the whole sub. I just thought some of the more outrageous comments (that make up a small minority) were pretty funny. I also wasn't expecting this comment to get that many views. You're right though, the vast majority of the sub has been pretty respectful and taken the loss a hell of a lot better than Trump has
No this is Patrick
Then we have kamalatoe as president
I actually don't.

I think the GOP is going to spend 4 years trying to rebuild their party and push an an oldschool conservative next time. You can't realistically build a party on conspiracy theories. 

The Trump strategy worked while it worked, but it has clearly failed when he can't even win as an incumbent.

I also think 4 years of a Biden presidency will cause some of the doomsday Trumpers to chill tf out
Yessss. Bitchbois just forget you couldn’t just snap your fingers and have large files pull down via the fucking air.

What's the new lingo for Biden causing stocks to drop? we got the Biden bump for when we go green. can't think of one for if we go red
Sue EVERYTHING
Excellent point, however going back to the fed and stimulus, deflation is something they cannot allow. 

So this theory requires the US government to, AT ALL COSTS, try to avoid deflation. Which they will. If they don’t, they will literally bankrupt the world again because the cost of leveraged debt, (which has been the fiscal policy we’ve used the past 40 years to promote growth), will collapse on itself.

Essentially, the entire world would get a margin call which would pretty much fuck every boomer’s retirement. The fed can’t have that.

So I agree gold miners is a solid play, for this posts purpose; I was trying to get the point across that this is something you can do put credit spreads on with confidence of it not being an outrageous bet. You could use the short put spread of this to finance your gold trade for example.

But if you want a low risk high probability bet, this is where to go. Biden’s tax policy and stimulus only will benefit metals and miners since most really didn’t recover and now will have the firepower and incentive to take out their competition

Unfortunately Biden will take over during the second wave.  It was the second wave of the swine flu that killed 50 million people.
Dewy won dude. It was called by the media.
Not a bear but here’s why:
Best case scenario (Biden president/GOP senate) is now priced in after last weeks savage pump. Senate race still in the air. Covid cases exploding with no end in sight. Even without shutdowns Q4/Q1 are going to be slower than Q3.

I need a YOLO on one of these any suggestions
Florida was within a hundred or so votes. Recounts have historically changed votes by maybe a hundred. Biden is winning by 10k+ in most of these states.
Too late? I bought mine last Friday.
why not buy a leap and just exit your call when the news drops?

Yeah it looks like a wrap for Trump cause Biden needs like 70% of the vote but he's getting more like 80% of the mail in votes in a lot of places.
Is Biden bullish or bearish for SLV
Lol he probably messed it up!
Simple, just pull out at the right time and buy gold.
you know they won't
Calm down Chad, some of us have to put the work in first
im all in vix calls so maybe
100% true. I mean, Obama did write a book so I'm sure he made a certain number of millions from that. But it was well known how much access K Street had to policy during his presidency. And in general most Dems get their start in local City politics somewhere where corruption is commonplace, so they tend to be more susceptible to this kind of stuff than Republicans.
Don't forget Hunter's laptop. They tried peddling that horseshit for a few months.

Incoming missles from Russia and China???
The market is going to go parabolic “like no one ever thought would be possible” on Monday just as a big FUCK YOU to Trump.
This man said courts decide elections. Need I remind you that in Bush v Gore what the court ruled was that the way in which a state declares their votes can stand, and that state supreme courts CANNOT force a recount?

I’ll say the same thing I said below. Tuesday’s event is huge for Apple in the long term and is not just a new iPhone release, it will change their companies future and investors will react positive is my guess. I am portfolio heavy on Apple due to its dip last month and buying low to get it back to even so I can only hope it won’t be like last two events. I’d say good luck but that would fuck me, so fuck you and have fun at Wendy’s cleaning the mop

Always has been
oh you sweet summer child
people celebrating a new establishment politician while the country is still $27 trillion in debt LOL
I feel like their earnings will be great and people will wonder why it was red for like 90 days straight
Time to up the stimmy from $3 trillion to $5 trillion.
He didn’t actually. Like I said it says so much about you. He is asking him to go explore and expose himself to different view points. It’s great advice regardless of who is giving it in any context.
Edit: Not as bad as it sounds he just fired a few people.

&#x200B;

* Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, the first woman to oversee the agency in charge of the nuclear stockpile. She was required to resign on Friday.
* Bonnie Glick, deputy administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. She was replaced by the acting administrator John Barsa, who had run out of time for his more senior role under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.
* Neil Chatterjee, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He was replaced as chairman, though he will remain at FERC, an independent agency, as a commissioner.

Biden will end the trade war with China. This is increasing stocks. Plus stimulus will pass. Plus Biden is good for giant publicly traded companies, especially the ones who funded his campaign. Plus he will be kind to big tech as they helped him win.

Don’t get me wrong, I totally agree with everything you said. But I feel like he couldn’t blatantly just come out and “prove” to us the fraudulent actions that took place. It has to go thru lawyers, the supreme court, etc.. which’ll take months. Hopefully on Jan 22nd Trump is the one still in office. We just have to wait until tonight to see what he says, monday to see what actions his legal team is pursuing, and of course, Jan 2nd.

No wait, no this is fun.
We have just seen the greatest wealth transfer of our generation, we have added how many trillions to our deficit this year?

So our government has argued for years on how to get these things paid for and we could never get it done, for the people. If it helps the poor people more than the few rich who don't need it, then where does the money come from? We just spent enough in PPP to pay for how many game changing social programs in America that would have set us up as a country for the decades to come, but we gave it to who? It was not the citizens. 

After all this proof that it is for the rich by the rich and here you all are slinging shit at each other to defend your side of the shit sandwich, step back, realize they are feeding you shit and you fucking love it like the good brainwashed zombie that you are. 

Neither side gives a fuck and you can't handle that you wasted your whole life blinded and corrupted, it's all there. More evidence then you could ever want and honestly most of it is plain as day and you still don't want to accept it. 

I leave you with this-
Suppose that a great commotion arises in the street about something, let us say a lamp-post, which many influential persons desire to pull down. A grey-clad monk, who is the spirit of the Middle Ages, is approached upon the matter, and begins to say, in the arid manner of the Schoolmen, "Let us first of all consider, my brethren, the value of Light. If Light be in itself good--" At this point he is somewhat excusably knocked down. All the people make a rush for the lamp-post, the lamp-post is down in ten minutes, and they go about congratulating each other on their unmediaeval practicality. But as things go on they do not work out so easily. Some people have pulled the lamp-post down because they wanted the electric light; some because they wanted old iron; some because they wanted darkness, because their deeds were evil. Some thought it not enough of a lamp-post, some too much; some acted because they wanted to smash municipal machinery; some because they wanted to smash something. And there is war in the night, no man knowing whom he strikes. So, gradually and inevitably, to-day, to-morrow, or the next day, there comes back the conviction that the monk was right after all, and that all depends on what is the philosophy of Light. Only what we might have discussed under the gas-lamp, we now must discuss in the dark.

Sure you can.  I had a nice conversation with a Trump supporter last night and stayed perfectly civil.  (S)He didn't conduct themselves in the typical Trump supporter manner so it was easy (no talk of librul tears or accusing me of being gay or wanting to murder babies).

**Most** of the people cracking crude jokes today will tucker out pretty quick and go back to being normal next week some time.  When Trump won, he and his cult **NEVER SHUT THE FUCK UP** the entire fucking 4 years.  They probably still won't shut up, but at least now I can comfortably ignore them.

The gore/bush situation was one state. This is at least three where Biden has won. That would mean 3 states have to be overturned and all go to trump. You’ve said the media don’t decide elections and that’s true. But you then post a highly biased news article. Election fraud is estimated at 0.00009% to 0.0004%. To overturn this result would take an unprecedented level of fraud. 

Still possible but it’s unlikely

I am a highly political individual, both myself and my significant other work in politics up in Canada. I am telling you that line he closed with is a clear indication that he doesn't have fuck all.

If there was something that Trump knew Biden was hiding, he wouldn't be releasing rhetorical questions like that. Instead, he would have already told the public what Biden is hiding.

Again, remember this is a right wing person talking. I am not some seething SJW liberal who wants Trump to lose at all costs.

Al Gore was ”the winner” for 38 days. Google it.

He never was. Because the media does not decide elections.

The courts do.

In the Gore/Bush case it was about Florida.

In Trumps case its at least five states, all with very questionable stats:

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this sub gave me cancer anyway.

Another autister mentioned that FB is going to get whacked. I agree. If ad delivery and data delivery were skewed due to FB being scared of mango policies - and as such messed up ad market - the upcoming administration will not forget how whacky FB’s involvement in talk and political issue made things a mess. I wouldn’t be surprised if FB is next after Judicial goes further after google.

Obama inherited a market that was already in shambles. The huge stimulus he passed in conjunction with near 0 rates and QE lead to a sustained period of growth. If you think Trump didnt rank the stock market as his number 1 priority throughout his term you are delusional.

I tabulated all of the returns for Congressmen and women who have invested since January 2019 or before...

Total count: 104.
Of which currently in the minus: 49.
Of which currently outperforming $SPY (+38%): 7.
Of which currently outperforming $QQQ (+89%): 0.

Best performers: 89%, 77%, 73%.
Worst performers: -160%, -120%, -102%

The amount of American politicians who started shorting the market in late January/early February is astounding. So many have their peak value on the exact day the markets were at their lowest, March 23rd, 2020. For whatever reason though, most are still shorting. If you wanna see some really retarded stuff, check out Derek Kilmer's graph. He puts us to shame with his autism. Seriously.

Yeah maybe because it happened to me and I’m apprehensive about the crazy run, but regardless. they are known to constantly issue new shares as their stock reaches its highs. Really wouldn’t be surprised if they do it this er like last time
Playing golf a power move?
Keep in mind liquidity was low at that point so there was something the fed could actually do by loaning out money. 

At this point the money is saturated - the only thing they could do if the market starts tanking is either government-backed ETF buying, or allow the banks to leverage up even further, which they already did earlier this year when the market stalled. But the first time they did it was a sneaky method they can't repeat, so they're out of ammo there unless they're okay with severely increasing risk levels.

He got what he wanted.  He has no more use for Trump.
Wrong

Well tech will do good due to GYNA relationships
You know Biden may still come back there if DeJoy hasn't destroyed enough of the mail in ballots yet.  He would only need to trend at about 65% of the outstanding ballots.  He's been 4:1 in ballots across most of the country.
Republican senate will curb Biden’s multi-trillion dollar spending plan. Stimulus will go through. Once covid is under control inflation will go through the roof, Biden will be to blame. A conservative advocating fiscal restraint will gain favor.

Sell stocks buy gold

Ciudad Juarez really nice this time of year.
No shit but that one is an easy one to believe. Hes not far left. Hes a centrist who supports capitalism and takes corporate money. So when he says he supports private healthcare and not universal healthcare, that's easy to believe cause that's where the money is for him as a politician and thats always the stance politicians have had. If he said be was going to dismantle private healthcare and start universal i would be happy but been skeptical of it actually happening. But he literally just wants to continue the status quo. Not very hard to believe.

Tonight during his victory speech, Biden should announce a massive stimmy as well as a newly approved vaccine. We'd be up 10% on Monday.

He can slap JPow and stop him from printing
1) A divided nation as the election was much closer than analysts had originally forecasted leading to endless conspiracy theories and riots.

2) A delayed stimulus and IMO a lower amount due to less pressure being applied by Trump.

3) Forever looming possibility of higher taxes and regulation even though the Senate is on track to being controlled by Republicans

4) Really no net positive change for markets as Trump is arguably more beneficial for markets as it ranks much higher on his agenda than Biden.
Right, these are not the droids I'm looking for. Reading you loud and clear

Lmao both plans are the same.
So basically we agree that the stimulus would be the same if Trump had won (although personally, I feel McConnell would feel more pressure to pass a larger package with Trump in office.

Trump is very anti-tax and regulation already so I dont see the benefit. 

Markets will likely shift towards a more traditional method of valuing stocks now that there will be less headlines to distract investors IMO.

For those still not getting it. Now that it is certain that Biden won, there’s no longer that uncertainty. Most investors that were on Trump’s side either sold off by Friday and/or moved it to stocks that would benefit from a Biden presidency.

There’s less uncertainty.  Senate stays red so the dems have to accept stimulus on their terms, which they will.  Also no crazy left legislation will get passed for taxes market regulation etc.  Gridlock is good, no one to agree  on anything so the markets are free to fuck around
Us voters were
Wait a minute....!!
Figured that was the neckbeard theory, but wanted to be sure.
No, they don't inject new money.  The banks have to buy the bonds in the first place to own them.  That money goes to the treasury.  Now the banks have less cash and more bonds.  The fed buys those bonds and in exchange gives them reserve assets.  The banks can't spend the reserve assets so it's not money.  If anything QE is deflationary because they exchanged liquid bonds for illiquid reserves and are down the money they spent to buy the bonds

Yeah, I used to jailbreak/unlock ipod touch and iphones freshman year of high school (2007 - 2008) for $20 a pop. People thought I was a wizard. 

It was around that time that I realized that I'm nowhere close to being a genius, but rather a large percentage of the population is just... very dumb. I would put myself just slightly above average. 

Really trying not to come across as humble bragging here, it was actually kinda scary for 13 year old me having that realization. Led to a very long period of existential dread and anxiety about the future of our species and how we can possibly survive if I'M towards the higher end of the scale.

He tried as hard as he could to destabilize the region with Soleimani, cut taxes for the richest while the poor and middle class were excluded, didn’t really come anywhere close to winning the trade war he started with China, and rode Obama’s economic recovery while touting it as his own. He did some good things if you’re either a) making well into six figures or b) pro-life or anti-gay, or both. Also b) hasn’t come true yet—we have to wait for ACB/Kavanaugh to do their magic.

RACISM, INJUSTICE, COVID AND CORRUPTION ARE OVER! WE DID IT!
Why would stocks boom on a gridlocked government when we already have one? Only difference is that you swap out Trump with Biden. We already know that Trump is probably one of the greatest pumpers of all time and it is unlikely that Biden will get anywhere close. 

Since Trump lost stimulus is likely to be delayed by several months and the end package will probably be around the same value as if Trump won the presidency.

Basically, the market is pricing in greater uncertainty as a good thing......

The only true risk is in the 3 grand worth of MRO calls. And these are different than your normal option spreads. I didn't open these positions by selling and buying at the same time. I transferred any risk of my capital from the theta burn to the opening process. I tighten the spread. For example, Iets say I purchase 1 $350 put for SPY for $200. I watch SPY throughout the day and wait for a healthy dip. When this happens, I sell the next strike down, which is $349. Due to the dip, the value of this option has increased. I sell for $190. Now I have most of my original capital safe and only stand to lose $10 if the trade goes sideways. Now I have an option spread that I purchased for $10 that can turn a 900% profit. Now multiply this by hundreds of options, and you can make a pretty penny. Keep in mind that these strike prices are at share price, so you can make 900 % profit or even more with the share price only moving 0.2% in your desired direction. It's a strategy I'm working on.

“It’s a possibility we will do more for state and local governments,” McConnell said.

When when is that down move coming? 

I want to but puts!!
What's funny is that Trump managed to lose as the incumbent president, but all his weird propaganda right-wing hysteria got pretty much every single possible house and senate republican past the finish line.

He is quite literally a cuck of the republican party, and I don't think he even realizes it. Mcconnell was in charge the entire time.
I truly believe RKT is the stock that you can still buy around $20 to $23 range 3 to 4 years later.
I agree, but after earnings?
I am thinking the opposite. A pump because election is over even though it goes to trial. A dump after people realize that Biden might shut down the economy again. I guess we findnout monday when comes back with his 100days plan

He would 100% get forcefully removed from office if he even attempted a nuclear attack without any cause. 

I think that would happen to any President.
I agree if this election is proven to be fraud, the market will react.

But Trump hasn't given any indication that he has any real proof.

Tonight's speech is basically his last chance to show us any ace he is holding up his sleeve.

If he doesn't, then I think it's pretty much over and he is going to slowly wither away into irrelevance.

Disclosure: I am a right wing, conservative/republican supporter. But I don't let my political leanings and emotions influence my investing logic.

He had to get lucky, I’m saying there are hundreds yes probably thousands of people who could’ve led like him. But he needed the family, connections, timing and genius just to get to where he’d have a shot at becoming Elon Musk of today. Which, is mostly based on projections of his future. I think he’s got some wacky ideas and not all of them are great, like the hyper loop in US cities. But he IS the only one out there doing things for his reasons, and that’s pretty much what we’re talking about when we talk about Elon Musk as an idea.

It's not hard to believe though unless you are listening to conservative conspiracy theories. Dead voters and all of that is just nonsense, our FBI has stated there is 0 evidence of fraud, even the most conservative news station fox news is stating their is no fraud, only the most extreme right wingers are pushing those conspiracy theories, there's just no actual evidence of fraud that could swing the election. And the democratic party was not splintered at all, they were much more divided in 2016 because a large portion of their base felt like Bernie was robbed, it made a lot of them switch to Trump because they wanted a political outsider. However, after seeing what a mess someone like Trump could cause in 4 years they united in voting for Biden even if he wasn't their favorite candidate.

And viruses will never be a problem. Reinstalling windows takes longer then all that and is a pain in the ass. Only do it as a last resort.

Good then you know, no one in the government is retarded enough to “ban” oil and gas in one year or something like that. No one except environmental fanatics are that retarded. 

You’re point about using fossil fuels to build solar and wind plants is EXACTLY right. 

Any bill passed to “ban” oil and gas or fracking would have a 20 year transition period to use oil to build out our alternative energy sources and then once we built them all, we transition over to then. 

But we need to put the transition in motion. Many subsidies for electric cars and solar systems etc, were ended under Trump and many Republican governors. 

We need to start the transition with funding and action sooner than later because realistically it WILL take 30 years.

This. It also conveniently misses the point that once theoretical profit margins were capped under the ACA, the insurance companies were able to target year over year as that percentage with a margin of error. Excess were handled with accounting. A Medicare for all version helps them even more as then they can punt their expensive clients as there is a backstop. So while they may be limited in top line growth, their risk level got severely diminished and their growth became more steady. 

The biggest and possibly most beneficial, would have been the continuing undermining of the current health infrastructure and opening it for disruption. This was on the edge of happening, but now is ironically set back while they wait for the government to reiterate then plan already in place that amplified the wealth of the current health insurance companies.
lmaooo they said that at 30 than it would dip to 25, never happened, hits 30, itll dip to 30 which it did but was reconcileing, now its at 40, itll dip to 35? when its at 50 by 11/13 you think itll dip to 40 or 45 as well? being in at 12.50 you see after the 15-20 dollar call and short game it sky rocketed, mad more money i did in 2 monts than i did in 3 years selling cars, and i made abou 120k last year
Mind elaborating on the thought process behind the ACB call?
> We don’t know who tf our president is, covid cases are rising, and unemployment is getting worse 

Idk dude. All this information existed last week.

I don't think a big scary pull back can be caused by the market re-evaluating previously known widespread information.

Big pull backs come when there is a big scary surprise and everyone goes, "oh shit, what does this mean? this could be real bad."

Ya shut downs didn’t work mostly because trump said the virus wasn’t real and Americans didn’t really quarantine cases never stopped going up. Trying that again won’t do anything, maybe enforcing some actual restriction on business practices (no social distancing in restaurants in my state at record high cases) then that might do something. Then there is encouraging people to get tested, accommodating testing and limiting people from unknowingly exposing others. Idk you got small brain

Edit: compensation to employers who encourage possible cases to not come on with pay and testing

I agree. I think the call will really really set the tone of the stock.

If they impress on sales and even start looking like there is a path to profit, the stock is going to go full boner rocket.

If not, the bears are going to come try to eat us again.

Honestly just the short interest coupled with Cohen's interest.

I'm not simply waiting around for squeeze. I keep making money buying low and selling high as this nonsense cycles constantly in part due to the pressure the shorts are under.

Damn... you see that Kelly Loffler's dumb ass has a half billion net worth and think to yourself WTF is wrong with me man.
Here's a tip:

BUY EV stocks, anything green 

England Boris Johnson & France Macron just mentioned working towards climate change with the US. This was difficult with Trump. 

The effect:

1.	Subsidies will not be discontinued and even increased resulting in higher demand for EVs
2.	California has mandates in place for EV sales for an auto company. These mandates will be further supported by Biden and even a national mandate is possible 
3.	Biden recently said the US will rejoin the Paris Accord
4.	Biden explicitly called out the oil industry in his debate with former president Trump 

The trend has been upwards in EVs even with Trump but now the "speed" of EVs will accelerate with Biden
joe giving sloppy? bet
Well done and fuck you
Are you? Registered voters doesn’t correlate to actual voting. Look at any other election for proof. Dumb dumb
Ahh, sorry for the misunderstanding.

People usually point to industrial jobs (coal, fracking and many other industries take place outside of big cities). Also there's stuff they point to like economic growth.

Also a lot of people in the country don't understand a lot of liberal ideas. That, combined with certain taboos about rural areas, many working class rural Americans think they're neglected by democrats
Naw shit Sherlock that was the legal rout always was. They knew from their internal polls all along that a loss was a high chance that’s why he kept saying vote I. Person vote in person..... Jesus Christ reread what o wrote from the get go like 10 times

Hear me out...I’m not trying to offend anyone. I get it, you hated him 4 years ago and you still hate him now.  I've seen a lot of hate thrown his way, but this guy is a consistent winner and an overachiever.  That's what the people who support him love about him.  Yes there have been some scandals, yes there have been some lies, and maybe a few times he's twisted the truth to make himself look better.  He's out there every day proving those haters wrong time every time.  Call it jealously, call it envy. Some people just can't handle how successful he is and how much money he has, could even be jealous that he's got a hot foreign model as his wife.  You may not have wanted him in this role, but he's there now and there is nothing you or I can do about it.  I know its possibly going to get worse over the next several days, but like him or not, Tom Brady is turning things around in Tampa Bay.

if the range of possible movement narrows then VIX will be down even if it doesn't "make sense" for it to be doing that. since the channel that SPX was in narrowed then that would cause VIX to go down even if there were to be uncertainty.

“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.” — Franz Fanon

Sephora & ULTA Beauty are COTYs competitors and they both have way more ecommerce growth than COTY.

COTY sells their stuff in CVS, Shoppers DrugMart, Grocery stores etc. You know those highly lit up aisles full of makeup, that is COTY.

also COTY is getting sued by it's investors for severely overpaying for the kardashians makeup company. bing it for more details.

I simply cannot see where and how COTY will be able to double its revenue.

Yeah same here.  I didnt vote in 2016 though-- that was truly the worst pair of choices.  Bill Clinton was a fantastic politician.  Hillary was terrible, and the democrats squandered the goodwill Obama left the party with after his 8 years by just letting her claim dibs.  Not to mention the Republicans had a whole host of awful, awful candidates, out of which Trump emerged.

Everyone can be all happy about drugs finally being legalized (or not punished as severely), but you know who this affects most? Poor people, and to be more specific, Blacks and Hispanics. When these legal weed shops open up, this takes away income from the people who were willing to risk their freedoms for it. All the while, the govt does nothing to make amends with the people that served years of their lives in tortuous environments called prisons. Think of all the broken families that were victims of democrats Crime Bill. The rich get richer and the poor eats shit. That’s the American way!

Trump supporters are being flooded with e-mails from Trump's campaign runners begging for more money over and over again in order to help them fight "fraud" in the election process, but in fine print it says that 50% of the contributions are used to retire Trump's campaign debt.

They're literally looking to milk their voters dry.
Money literally comes out of thin air...
AP is like 99% accurate when they call states/presidents since 1848. Trump's not going to win this one since Biden already got Nevada and Pennsylvania.

Our political affiliation = stonk market

If its green we are happy, unless you're a bear at which point nobody cares anyways
Did trumps Twitter get muted or something holy shit
Stop talking to my soul you fuck
No more uncertainty in who’s going to be president, meaning people are going to put their money in the markets. Unless you see something crazy happening this weekend, stonks are going up on Monday
But I want that big blue stimmy
Was it Tila Tequila?
The average home price would break $500k.  Automobiles and other large ticket items would inflate dramatically.  College tuition would also moon to levels you never thought possible.
[deleted]
That is the equivalent of paying $8 call for a $25 stock to go up to $50.

Another way to look at it is, you are paying 32% of the stocks current price in hops that it doubles in price.

Buy the stock, write covered calls (or puts). Take advantage of the volatility.
The people who benefit from high volatility is the ones that wrote the puts/calls!
move to iowa and vote in the primaries
A national mask mandate would go a long way.  

Affordable fast testing (15 min or less) would also keep a ton of manufacturing open.

New York and California might make Biden win the popular vote by 3% lol
Better question is: Will JPow stay? I hope so
lol.
Smoker of the ganja
don't be so naive. Trump had to go against China not because he was a dick but China is a thread to the US economy. Maybe Biden will be more chill but he won't back down.
Yeah this guy is right. Also California has only counted 66% of their votes. That's 55 Electorialies that Trump could very likely get when the count is over.
another Russian-bought cult leader? no thanks.
The salt is real
Has anyone else notice most Asians love Donny??

Yeah you’re missing a lot of info actually, basically the whole fucking point. He wants (like most people who voted Biden) more assessable healthcare, never said anything about private healthcare. Trump was saying that he was during the debates even to try turn it against him, and it worked on a lot of retards.
A dem Senate will pass a bigger stimmy
I'm looking forward to 4 to 8 years of no random trade wars.
Damn trumps own team set him up by booking him a parking lot 💀
4 year term runs to February 2022
Nerd !!!!!!!!
It'll be Harris 2024. She will for sure run. Not sure how people will feel about her. Who knows what we'll get the next 4 yrs. Stayin hopeful
I was all on board with your statement until your blatant lie about the electoral college. The college will follow the popular vote of their individual state. So unless the legal challenge makes a good case Biden will be elected by the college
You mean the poor boys? Lmfao nice president you elected.
You should see her BABA put positions.

There’s a lot that can be done to try and control Covid that is not being done right now, like surging even more federal resources into testing and contact tracing with a national strategy and not leaving it up to each individual state. That alone can help identify the spread, where to focus resources, and let those know who have been exposed to isolate, to help curb the spread some.
**Fun Fact**

The stock market has [historically performed](https://i.gyazo.com/7081183a52d10cb1cde20b0a4106fe1c.png) the best when there was a democratic president with the house and senate split between parties. 

Basically the next 4 years statistically should be great for the stock market.
Honestly big macs are pretty great when made right
Annie are you ok?
I think things will naturally just calm down.  Only reason politics were so crazy in threads is because the crazy shit 45 would do or say.  We won't all agree with Bidens policies, but they wont be broadcast in an insane all caps misspelled tweet, so we will have less to argue about
Bidens lead is too big. They won't get another Al Gore Vs. Bush, its just too much. Coup d'etat is the only thing left, but the military won't be behind Trump.
I believe there’s a gap like in the 100’s on spy.. 

Not every gap has to be filled lmao

The whole thing about gaps is... there most likely isn’t support so if we drop that low, it’ll blow through it because it’s a gap lol
>Even when it is confirmed, the electoral college will elect Trump anyways.

What? Lol. I don't think Donnie's gonna find the votes in the remaining recounts to take the electoral lead.

The is asymmetric risk skewed towards the loss.

They could literally take the gains away from you if you win, and they will chase you for the losses.

Also these positions looks like spreads, selling puts and buying puts with a tight strikes, how tf are you gonna make any $ with these setups.

Spy- biden won, if senate goes red your spy puts are cooked. Weekend wallstreet is already going up.

Totally understood it was just for illustration.

Somebody else mentioned OSTK which is a meme stock hence has high volatility

A real life example is GME where I have a nice sized position.  I obtain 3.5% on the long side of the strangle for a 15% above underlying stock price shorted call.  I obtain 2.8% per month on the short side of the strangle for a shorted put (I want to be an owner if my puts are assigned).  

This was for a trade when GME was at 12.8 put in about 2 weeks ago on the Dec monthly.  GME tanked to 10.5 but I was paid 6.3% just to hold GME for that month.  Plus I allowed my broker (IB) to lend out GME thus earning some interest on the hypothecated shares.  Haven't checked my statements but its approx 2.5% for that month.    Thus my total notional cap loss (21% ugh) is offset by 8.8% income for that month.

Annualized; if GME paid out such outrageous premiums every month (unlikely) I will own free shares in a little less than a year.  The risk is of course that GME's share price tanks to near zero but that's a risk I'm willing to take and while I take that risk I'm compensated for it by the option premium income generated from the strangle
He just might quit.  Then President Pence will print that shit double time.

Yeah, they're idiots. I only donated to the investigation because of the voter fraud. I gave my Wendy's paycheck through his website. He said he won and that Biden cheated so I wanted to help
I honestly have no idea why I bought the 1 ACB call. Maybe to beat myself up for getting out of it the day before it shot to the moon. The only play I'm semi sure of is the 3 grand I put in $4 MRO calls. Im thinking I could cash out at $4.50 for $7500. DraftKings I simply bought on a whim.  In case the market decides to go in the shitter, my SPY puts will let me hold on to $3800 to gamble with a again.

He didn't even get all the electoral college votes he won last time.
Neither Trump nor Biden are the most important men in the room. JPow and his goons at the Fed hold that title. Print on, father!
Hes old enough I doubt he needs a job, I think he genuinely is one of the best people for his job and he wants to try to help as much as he can.  Prob more worried about his safety because of crazy radicals that think he is a enemy for some reason.
Now biden administration will get credit for good things that have happened but never saw light of day. Not saying trump should really get the credit but America should be acknowledged. Not like nothing happened. They just couldn't look past Twitter. Superpac. Massive red wave in 2024 

Worst election choices of my lifetime, albeit limited. But I got exactly what I voted for, trump noise out and McConnell barrier

The election isn’t officially over until the results have been certified. That has happened in zero states and won’t happen until the legal process is complete. Biden might be president elect according to the AP, but zero is confirmed yet. Even when it is confirmed, the electoral college will elect Trump anyways.
AOC will never be a presidential candidate but I wouldn't doubt that she'll be house whip or speaker some day
Ginger Khan
I'll say it again, you are delusional if you think the media wouldn't have blamed him. It would have been just tied to another narrative. Trump says everyone wear a mask no exceptions, media says trump is makeing the US into a joseph Stallin run country. Orange man is always bad.

5% considering its 30% runup in a couple weeks isnt much, probably just retesting 14k

It's okay, Mango is not a conservative by any stretch of the imagination.  I've voted Republican for President my entire life but voted Libertarians the last two times because of him.
Last couple times my body craved a Big Mac they haven’t been hitting the same. In fact, they’ve been tasting weird which is good because it put me off from wanting to go there for months.
Because they are a shit company. They can't even scam their investors correctly.

Yup you’re absolutely right - 2020 too! VIX was trading around $8 going into February, and spiked to $80. Back down to the mid-low $20s. There are strategies for risk management, including stop losses and buying calls to cover your shorts in an emergency. Changes the economics a little if you do that.

Sometimes I worry about you guys,

For the last time.

It does not matter in the LEAST bit if Trump concedes. It's just a Presidential norm to do so , it's also the gentleman's way to lose. All of his lawsuits have already been thrown out the window by judges in Philadelphia and Georgia, they literally have no merit.  He's spewing bullshit to fundraise for their "legal vote defense fund" which actually is just a way to syphon money out of his supporters to fight the upcoming battles he will face after the presidency.

The key between these two is that in binary events (well, "binary") like this you get more information to make a decision.

Doesn’t matter if he concedes or not.  His challenges may get him some votes back, but it won’t be nearly enough to change the outcome.

2. challenges have too little evidence, and the specific votes being challenged wouldn't be enough to put Trump ahead anyway

Lol I was gonna say, Biden’s my boy if he can swing that!
may he ski well!
I remember when Obama took all our guns, relocated everyone into communal farms, and castrated all the men. 

While you're afraid of silly fantasies that will never happen, the rest of us are watching with our own eyes as the mad king threatens to contest the peaceful transfer of power while he sends out desperate pleas to his unstable followers to reject the results of the election. 

I could not possibly think of anyone more un-American than Donald Trump and his legion of cult followers. It's a good thing our dear leader is so god damn stupid or we might actually be a a fascist dictatorship.

Biden gonna take our guns now?

Why do people think this everytime a democratic president wins? Gun stocks going to bounce up with increase demand because idiots think the libs are going to take their boom boom sticks, and then nothing happens and they go back to where they were at. So fucking dumb this happens every 4/8 years. Should have bought in a month ago, guns already priced in
Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell aren’t crazy? They both lied on record and supported almost all of Trump’s antics

Basically the voters said we are fine with obstructionist lying Republicans who broke the rules to get their Supreme Court picks in and stack the rest of the judiciary. But they narrowly don’t want Trump.

That’s not a super reassuring message.
You understand he replied "facts" to me criticizing him hahaha read who wrote which comment

Everyone I picked up wanted to celebrate with me (because I’m black), but I didn’t even acknowledge the victory. I mainly wanted to see Trump win to piss off these liberals who claim their pro equality, but still cross the street and refuse to make eye contact with me in public

Many educated people have conservative priorities (not necessarily trump supporters). Trump managed to barely stand out in a very crowded primary of traditional conservative candidates, and much of the party fell in line only once he cinched the nomination. This election will hopefully allow the Republicans to rebuild the party with less cultism and more actual conservative policy, especially once they realize Trump may have been Ross Perot'd by the Libertarians in swing states. Trump's antics definitely caused some conservatives to pick Biden/Jo for president with Republicans down-ballot.

Yes cause' the country is benefited by wall street deregulation and tax cuts from the 1%. Only thing I can agree on is guns, and I think gun regulation should be bound to certain counties instead of complete states. 

Rest of is it mostly bullshit,can you name policies by the GOP that benefited the country, apart from subsidies that only had to be instated because of the trade war? One could argue the oil industry but that is a moot point since green tech is much more labour intensive and global warming ruins crop yields.

It's called IMPLIED volatility for a reason. Premiums are overpriced and volatility is mean reverting.

You want to purchase options when it's cheap to take advantage of vol expansion. You want to sell options when it's expensive to take advantage of vol contraction. 

Selling during low IV you'll get completely rekt by IV expanding. It's like IV crush for option buyers, but opposite.

COVID coverage will magically disappear sometime between now and the end of January. Once Biden is actually in office it's going to be a distant memory.
Dude, Trump is literally doing nothing and discouraging mask use EVEN after getting COVID himself. The simple fact that Biden is creating a pandemic taskforce that will be made up of experts (not a radiologist) is FAR more than what trump has done.

Biden isn't in office yet. But he is well aware of the resources at his disposal. He will without a doubt take many if not all the pages out of the pandemic plan established during the Obama administration which was basically thrown in the trash by Trump.

Quit asking "What is Biden going to do?" when you should be asking "what the fuck has trump done?" and "Why the fuck do I continue to sniff his throne when he clearly has done FUCK all?"

Biden was not my first choice as democratic candidate. But he has made his intentions clear regarding the pandemic, and a large part of that is entrusting EXPERTS with the task of helping him manage this problem.

No. You're talking about the Biden of 20+ years ago. He has a mandate to govern far-left. The only thing blocking that from coming to fruition is the Senate, which is likely to stay Republican. Biden isn't there to be a centrist. He's the radical left's puppet to enact bullshit progressive legislation. Executive orders re-regulating industry, undoing Trump's deregulation, will happen on Day One. If you think he's going to govern from the middle, you're misguided.

Sure the tasks on a surface level are easy enough. Having enough money to pay people to do what you need them to do and actually paying people to do the correct things in order to keep and improve an operable business in a competitive market place is not something *anyone* with a lot of money is going to be able to accomplish. That is the reason why most businesses fail or only achive mediocrity--the decision-making is not there.

Trumps an idiot for not disowning the racists. I guess he thought they were too big a part of his base, but I feel like he failed to realize that if he disowns racists and asshole then he gains millions and millions of the normal non racist non liberal people that make up suburban america.

I just commented that we should ensure safer and secure elections. Joe Biden won and will be inaugurated in January. I barely had a stake in either candidate as I'm 20. I just know there's a lot of people who think there was some type of fraud, and maybe they're all wrong. But the fact that a lot feel unsure about it means that there are steps we should take to tighten things up and create transparency.

The people who are saying Democrats wont win senate... There are 2 runoff senate elections in Georgia this January. We WON Georgia. We have a decent shot at getting majority in senate.

Everything Biden has said is a what, not a how. He has no actual plan that can be immediately acted on. It’s all fun and games until you have to figure out how to put the resources together to make the plan a reality. “Biden will ensure xyz...” no mention of how he will do that.
Trump did claim PA, GA, AZ, & NV before Biden..... I think the falls under the "finders keepers loses weeper" rules.

Its unfortunate that this wasn't handled appropriately in the first place.  I dont want a lockdown and I worry about small businesses that can't withstand another one.

High iv and elevated RSI are your friends when it comes to selling covered calls. The premium you get is higher. 

Selling it on the pullback yield less premium. Shouldn't look at it negatively if your shares get assigned. More money in your pocket is still better than less money.

>Let's be honest- most people are not going to do individual research on most things and will stay in their own circles and I don't think that's something we can logic our way out of sadly

i'm not even saying people should be expected to research everything. but with even the slightest bit of skepticism people can start to realize that maybe they shouldn't automatically trust everything they read. sure they think they are acting logically and reasonably, but to any sane person it's clear that they are not. either they need to be held somewhat accountable or it should be considered a legitimate mental illness

i'm not talking about biases really, i'm talking about the literal lies that people believe and spread which leads to dangerous conspiracy theories like pizzagate and Plandemic

>was just about users on conservatives saying they won't protest the new president for the next 4 years like the dems would have if trump won, and one way to read that is that biden does not warrent 4 years of protesting like trump does. just kind of a joke i was making 

Yeah I got that, I guess I was looking at it through a strategic lens rather than as a joke. I thought my first edit clarified but I guess it looked like I was playing defense for them. Oh well.
Democrats kept saying trump bad on covid. Now they are in charge. What's bidens first move? Nationwide mask order? Lockdown?
What about earning next week?

ACB is dumping after earnings
No congressmen in either tanker gang or PRPL gang? I find this hard to believe
Debt is pretty high that’s why stock doesn’t pump that much but yes I was looking at this too
I've just read here that ACB is a dogshit unprofitable company and that there are better cannabis plays. But again, do your own DD. I lost some money because I got calls after the Friday peak, so I just have a small amount still riding in to see how Monday does. If they moon, that's good, but general WSB sentiment for ACB in particular is bearish.

The economy will pullback in December or January regardless of who wins because corona cases are exploding and will only get worse as it gets colder and people gather for the holidays. Biden may announce a second lock down, something Donnie would never dream of. Only the rumored second stimulus can save us.

Also, if you knew how the scientific method worked, medicine and science doesnt always have the answers immediately. There is trial and error and recommendations made and adjusted as new information becomes available. That isn't "Flip flopping". That is how science eventually get's to the right recommendations. it is SPECIFICALLY because of this that you should trust scientific recommendations. They are constantly being assessed and re-assessed to make sure they are the best recommendations available.

You would think this is obvious yet here we are...

Serious Q: how exactly could Biden’s covid plan be different if it doesn’t involve lockdowns? 

My guess is that all he can do is “strongly encourage” governors to adopt mask mandates if they haven’t already. I don’t see that moving the needle unless this burns out on its own come January.
When ParcelPal goes +1500% at the end of the month I will change my profile picture on all socials until the end of the year <3
ya they been doing this all year and reddit goes HURDUR second wave.  If anything they got herd immunity in the summer by being smart and not social distancing.  Now all the social distance tards are fucked come winter with no immunity.  For example: i been looking at their night clubs on snap map and they've been packed ALL year with no mask.  Any reddit retard would say "two weeks they are fucked" but they would of been wrong every day for last 6 months.
It won’t lmao

He said he wants to create a public option. With how they’ll roll it out, healthcare companies will be able to dump their expensive clients.

My guess simply is Biden won’t even do the public option and probably cut Medicaid and Medicare

This is all due to needing to “compromise” and tackle the “deficit”
MPC and PUMP
I bet on biden winning by putting money in ACB cannabis, guess it was a good idea lol, bought at 6.31 now it is 14.4 as i write this

Biden win equals to stimulus which equals 🚀🚀🚀.
Under normal conditions I'd agree, but now that the tables have turned and it's the Republicans who will look extremely bad for not passing a stimulus, I think it's at least a possibility.

Dawg I was never really interested in debating anyone on this stuff I just pointed out that we should try to have more secure elections so that people don't feel like there was any mistakes.

>people (adults at least) should be held at least somewhat responsible for being able to think for themselves and use proper logic and reason.

No one thinks that they are acting without logic or reason. That's why misinformation is so powerful. 

Let's be honest- most people are not going to do individual research on most things and will stay in their own circles and I don't think that's something we can logic our way out of  sadly. People will confirm their own biases long before they accept new information unless if they are looking to change their own mind- which is pretty damn uncommon I would think.

An avatar (Sanskrit: अवतार, IAST: avatāra; Sanskrit pronunciation: [ɐʋɐtaːrɐ]), a concept in Hinduism that means "descent", is the material appearance or incarnation of a deity on earth. The relative verb to "alight, to make one's appearance" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.The word avatar does not appear in the Vedic literature; however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE. Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism.

Oh look! You are an expert at parroting Tump’s talking points! What else would I have expected?

As a doctor and ICU physician, I can say with confidence and with a mountain of evidence that Trump did not, in fact, listen to the medical experts. By Trump’s own admission he knew about how bad this virus was and publicly MINIMIZED both it’s severity and contagiousness going so far as discouraging and mocking mask use which we know is one of the most effective measures at preventing spread. 

But go ahead and keep your head buried in the sand. If you can’t appreciate the colossal failure of Trump’s approach to this pandemic, you are being willfully obtuse.

Btw Biden has outlined a plan. It would take 2 minutes of searching for you to come across it. Not that I expect you to actually take the time to inform yourself in any balanced way.

You're wrong. Only one side has claimed fraud and that is the Trump and his idiot republicans who belive him.

Ahh day-drinking...my favorite pandemic pastime
Trump just staring at a mask right now looking lost and sad ..."YOU WERE THE KEY!"
i would agree with you; if we didnt just have a massive pandemic, nation wide riots, and almost had a civil war (might still??) and everyone armed the fuck up.

The right isnt going to hand it over, moderates arent, and im sure the majority of the left who just bought all the guns and ammo from the store for the last 8 months isnt either. 

Cats out of the bag; the US CAN have a civil war, turn a certain hinge of fascist and mass civil unrest in this century.

The whole argument for guns was, civil unrest, unchecked government, and for war, and we tickled all of those this year, the left usually argues that these conditions arent possible in a western nation due to it being the current year; the current year said hold my beer.

I feel like we'll have more days like yesterday. Some consolidation and a bit of correction. I don't see us tanking anytime soon this year. Even though it makes absolute sense. 09/02 and 10/12 are important dates for SPY. We can't seem to break higher highs in the short term.

>Also, isn't any state run marketing by definition propaganda?

yeah i mean i guess this is true but i was thinking of dangerous and dishonest dishonest social engineering propaganda.

i put the onus on both the people in power and the people who elect them to power. of course being in power makes it easier to influence the citizens, but i kind of put that on the citizens for not trying to think for themselves. like those in power have the responsibility to not deceive and mislead the constituents, but the constituents also have the responsibility to use reason to think about information presented to them.

but really my original comment was just about users on conservatives saying they won't protest the new president for the next 4 years like the dems would have if trump won, and one way to read that is that biden does not warrent 4 years of protesting like trump does. just kind of a joke i was making

Yeah I couldn’t care les about long term. I’m trading strictly off of hype and only need it to rise this week off of the Biden news. Also I know it’s not likely to continue to rise since it already went so high but just crossing my fingers we still have a few good days left.

Weekend Dow up 100 pts 

Shitcoin draining 

I’d draw the conclusion of pointless weekend trading that, stocks are going up and shitcoin dropping.. anyways shitcoin needed a cooling off
Just a speculation: we test ATH, then a series of small pull back to high 330 area.

At some point in the last few months he changed the policy about student loan forgiveness on his website. At one point I believe everyone got a flat $10k forgiveness but that’s gone and now it’s bullshit unless you make like nothing. Either way Mitch is going to block everything he wants to do.

Why wait ten days?  It's not hard to do at all.  Go to Vegas.  Bet $1000 on a hard eight.  Roll the dice landing on two fours.  Tell the box man to "press".  Roll the dice again once again landing the dice on two fours. Do this ten more times in a row and bingo, you'll be a millionaire.  Less taxes of course.

Never let anyone tell you that you can't sleep your way to the top.   Go get em Kommie.
People who support him after Biden won will get in big trouble if they keep fighting for Trump now. So probably they help Trump get out of the White House fast.
Mango's been the most entertaining president since George W. Only difference is that Mango was actually good for the country, George W. not so much.
If you did a tiny bid of research, you'd learn the Biden had a major stutter as a kid. He worked to overcome it, but still has trouble sometimes. So, when you think he's forgetting what he's talking about, it's really him trying to get the word out without stuttering.
If biden dies can we just taxidermy him and pretend he's still alive. Taxidermy biden would still be a better president than her

Someone below me said it best and I think it's that two things can be true - Trump can be retarded and fairly lost etc and also we should ensure fair elections bc they might be shady. I think the fact that enough people feel like the election was unfair (like many did in 2016) just shows that America has gotta fix a lot of shit with their elections bc 2024 won't be any better
This loss should be good for them financially
Biden is gonna push further restrictions on guns. This means theres gonna be a boom of people trying to buy guns before they're restricted. Invest wisely

People freaking out over Trump losing need to realize that Sleepy Joe isn't actually going to do anything. He's been in office for 47 fucking years and has a pretty solid track record of doing very very little with any impact. He's a textbook politician that has made a lot of money sitting in office and hasn't done anything outrageously bad or negative. He's done mostly nothing and he's very far past the prime of his life so why should we expect otherwise. And the positive news is people will hopefully stop bitching about politics so much.
If ACB dumps on earnings are we buying the dip or nah?

Possible. Kind of fucked since she barely even got anywhere during the primaries.
I'm not rationalizing anything, The virus does kill and it's very dangerous to the general population. This is known. Your point is fucking stupid. I take the proper precautions when obtaining food and my wife and I only go to open air parks on a walk from our apartment to exercise the dog. 

&#x200B;

I'm arguing with your shitty financial advice to pull out as much debt as you can as if that is the only other alternative. How about a better angle like, learn to live off of 300-400 dollars per month for food with chix, rice and a veggie. California where I live you still don't have to pay rent if you cant make the payments. Even with a meager 5k savings, under these circumstances  you could still be burning through that savings if you lost your job and even had an expensive car payment. Consume less, save more.

Thats because water molecules exhibit hydrogen bonding and when they freeze the molecules slow enough that the hydrogen bonding locks water molecules into a tetrahedral crystalline structure. Essentially, most compounds have to get pushed together really tightly to be in the solid phase but because of hydrogen bonding water can lock into place without being packed so tightly together

It's the crystalline structure of ice. Water is densest around 10 Celsius or something like that.

Dude, not that I care at all, but just, no, it didn’t. That’s untrue by virtually ever measure, save post pandemic. 

That said, what exactly, if anything at all, does comparing economic performance under Obama vs. Trump have to do with Biden increasing the debt at a faster rate than Trump? It’s not a matter of how good the economy actually is. It’s just the fact he’s going to pump through more stimulus than any previous president has.

Time for a new whip
Trump closed the borders when the Dems including Biden said that was racist and all that bullshit. He cut off flights from China when the Dems yelled xenophobia...

>you're misattributing the blame on the people rather than on those who are enabling and propagating the disinformation

this is also true. but i do think people (adults at least) should be held at least somewhat responsible for being able to think for themselves and use proper logic and reason. but yeah the sophistication of some conspiracy theories and  fake news is hard to detect so the people aren't necessarily to be blamed. 

thanks for the rec i'm going to give that a watch. i did think the social dilemma was lacking quite a bit
I mean Trump is an asshole, but I think he's mentally competent. Does not mean Trump was a good president. Biden regularly forgets what he's talking about. This isn't opinion, look at all the unedited footage out there. Kamala and the DNC going to run the country though, so it doesn't really matter either way. Biden was just a pretty centrist guy who's name everyone knew. People that hate Trump voted for him but wouldn't have voted for anyone far left. At the end of the day nothing is going to really change. Biden will get credit for the bounce back and vaccine so he'll probably gain even more support in early 2021
Thanks homie you too!
All bears have is fear-mongering about Trump trying to destroy America. Heads up, half of America still voted for him. He’s not going to destroy America on his way out and lose that following. Also it’s called a lame-duck session for a reason.

This won’t effect private healthcare negatively.  They will have to stop wasting money on CEOs and upper management and will instead have access to the market of currently uninsured people who couldn’t afford healthcare.  Private healthcare will just have to make deals with the government which means the best competitors with the ability to provide better care will become the industry leaders.

Haha I’m wrong was fucking with gme since 2.85.
gotta add: "i hear people say" one of discredited Trumps favorite tactics.
You can’t really get leaps, the furthest out strikes only go to April. But technicality aside, yeah it should in theory climb and it hasn’t had any Biden explosion yet like weed has. TAN has actual leaps but is obviously more expensive and tracks slightly differently.

That said, red senate might halt its rise, but I would be shocked if it dumped because of that.
NIO PLUG RKT DKNG SNE
His ignorance made him lose this election. If he had been wearing a mask since March, the media wouldn't have blamed him as much as they do now,  he just had to show people that he is working with them. You just had to wear a mask Donnie! Even a MAGA mask would have been fine.

I got banned from a conservative sub for saying “Hi I am retarded and a trump supporter. I only believe things that fit my view, without fact checking or critical thinking. I also believe everything Trump says even though he has a history of lying and cheating. Also my Christian friends say he was appointed by god, even though he’s broken almost every commandment”.
O K
Almost makes me want to create a twitter account just so I can follow/unfollow 🥭.
I’m implying the media will paint a prettier picture on it if a democrat is in office
U sound like a poor 

Don’t let politics control u 

It’s about getting rich and making money 

Neither side gives a shit about u and your wage slave self
You can forget stimulus for this year. Trump will use all of his remaining days for recount and other shit. Monday is going to be interesting day in markets for sure and I will lose more money
Is it? Wasn't around at the time so I can't necessarily say but in media, even media centered around and by the "tech otakus" of that time, computer stuff is generally considered really niche and you had to have a special interest/passion to go past the operational phase of being into computers. 

And using that interest to build and sell computers is that but a step further bc I doubt that many people are that entrepreneurial. Not to say that Musk is unique (after all this is the story of several modern day tech giants like the Dell dude) but was it really as widespread as you paint it?
 It if there is a blue senate then we will at least see a massive stimulus. Red probably not so much unless Mitch listens to Saint JPow
I said name 12. If you can't "survive" in at least one of 12 careers, you suck at life and should give up. Thank you for your service.
We no longer vote for a president that we believe will do well, we now vote for the least bad candidate.  We’ve bought into the idea that you have to choose a team, even if that team is shit, you can’t switch.
Easter island
There is, always has been, and most likely always will be some sort of fraud in the election system. However, fraud is not how Biden has won. Life won’t be as bad as some think under Biden. Promise.
Same. Agree 100%
You could argue he wants to keep the economy intact so at least he’ll be remembered for that. Also better chance of winning in 2024 if he wants to run again

Trump is still president til January. Stimulus is still on him and the current Congress. I think they were just waiting for the election to get back to work. Hopefully, they get something done soon or it won’t get done until the new session comes in.

Defense is still cheap in the long term. Democrats are war mongers and this is objectively true, speaking from a market standpoint this is good advice, make money on the inability for the defense budget to go down!

Hello friend, are you part of SILVER GANG?
Shut the fuck up retard.
Senate seats in Georgia is still undecided, so tax laws are undecided. Could see profit taking. But  republicans have a good chance of still taking it in runoff.

Just something to keep an eye out.
This is just flat out wrong. Biden's healthcare plan would be a boon for private insurance since it places more people on their coverage, subsidized by the Federal government.

Here's something I wrote a few weeks ago:

"In 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was signed in law, the most comprehensive and consequential healthcare regulatory overhaul in the history of the United States. Among some of the most striking changes were the implementation of the following regulations:

* Mandatory out-of-pocket maximum, capping out-of-pocket expenses each year, not to exceed a level determined annually by the Dept. of HHS based on average per enrollee premiums (e.g. $6,350 in 2014, $8,150 in 2020)
* Prohibition against denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions
* Permitting premiums to vary only by enrollee age and location
* Minimum coverage of ‘essential health benefits’
* Prohibition against annual and lifetime benefit limits

In addition to these new regulations, the ACA created a pair of new subsidies, a temporary reinsurance program for insurers, and allowed states to expand coverage of Medicaid. The subsidies include the Premium Tax Credit, which directly subsidies premiums for lower and middle income households not eligible for other coverage, and the cost-sharing reduction, which reimburses insurers for mandatory cost-sharing reductions (reductions in deductibles and copays) for low-income ACA enrollees."

"Take for instance, in order to ensure affordable coverage for all Americans, we would simply need to extend the subsidies put in place by the Affordable Care Act and establish a public option that automatically enrolls the uninsured. That’s what Joe Biden’s plan entails, and according to the people at Wharton, it would cost a mere [$352 billion over ten years](https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/9/14/biden-2020-analysis), literally two orders of magnitude less than [Sander’s Medicare For All](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/10/upshot/medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders-cost-estimates.html). "
Serious question- they’re about to spend millions in Georgia for these run off races. Is there any money to be made?
>plus it's a statement on the brainlessness of the american public that they can be so incapable of thinking for themselves they just completely fall for the propaganda and conspiracy theories that social media feeds them more and more of.

Fear is an effective motivator and I think you're misattributing the blame on the people rather than on those who are enabling  and propagating the disinformation. There was an interesting documentary on flat earth and conspiracism that I feel does a better job criticising social media in their specific enabling of two groups than the vague finger wagging in The Social Dilemma.

Exactly, Trump has no power on Powel now, Powel listened to Trump only because Trump would appoint him again in 2021 if he won. 

Now only way for Powell to keep his job is to listen to Biden. Biden wants markets to tank hard before February, so he'll be able to raise them under his term.
Forgive my ignorance, I always heard that it cost a lot to pursue a career in medical fields, but I never realized the loan is of this magnitude. Was the annual tuition/fees higher than other major or is it simply accumulation of years of tuition?

With my laughable knowledge learned by hearsay, dentists can easily make north of a quarter million in a good year. Don't mean to pry, but I hope that holds true for you. I think you shall be doing well after this turmoil blows past. I, for one, am putting off my already overdue dentists appointment this year for fear of COVID. Just oral-b and waterpik my teeth everyday and praying they don't fall out.
True. But usually takes a couple years

Yeah but the risk alienating the rest of the country.  I think a Trump branded network isn't gonna get the big sponsors it would need to break beyond webstreams and podcasts.

The Republican party playmakers have no use for  him anymore and are gonna back off now that he can't help them as President

Calls on every subsidized company run by major political campaign contributors on no-bid contracts in clean energy.
So he’s a partisan, yes, but he’s not the sole purporter of the existence of SCORECARD and HAMMER. Also, if you go to YouTube and watch Lemino’s video about 370, it leaves it pretty up in the air as to what the true cause of the crash was. I sure as hell have no idea, but  him saying that it was an act of terrorism isn’t like some huge discrediting attribute. Not that I’m trying to defend this guy in any way, I barely know anything about him, but how does that discredit the fact other people besides him are also publicly discussing the existence of HAMMER and SCORECARD
I’m saying your point doesn’t matter and calling you out for calling the kettle black. In short, You can try to justify lockdowns anyway you please (Ie listening to scientists makes you a slave). Virus don’t give no shits about your reasons and that’s my point.
Yeah, but there's a big difference between IPO at $29 and then dropping to support at about $13, and dropping from $13 to 16 cents. That's almost a 99% drop!

I hope rona situation get better and pump the economy fundamentals
Can't say I followed all that but one thing that stood out is the strategy only works for certain stocks which you found via a backtest. Based on that it sounds like you could be overfitting. (That is, maybe those stocks just happened to work historically so it doesn't predict they'll keep working.) I'd suggest you could borrow a technique from machine learning and only use half the historical data to "train" (choose which stocks to trade), then use the other half of the data to verify the strategy keeps working.
Yeah, I will take with a pinch of salt, anything that the sociopath with the hair plugs say.
Trump will be golfing everyday from here on out. That's what I would do if I were him. Screw being prez lol
You're so right. Just look at Hillary, trump has her locked up for 3.5 years now. There's no way trump lied about that!!
Damn idrc if Joe wins but like I don't understand how people don't think there was fraud in some way shape or form. Like I'd much rather heavily audit everything and recount etc to make sure people are confident in what happened otherwise you're gonna have half the country freaking out

If that’s what everyone is already expecting... (then it is priced in), then...,expect it to moon after earnings. 
Buying calls now, GG. GLHF. TY.
Sub is definitely scanned
Go on then, lets see this proof.
Honestly it's one of the stocks I wouldn't hold on for too long if you go for stocks, but the possible spikes due to covid and shortsqueezes could be quite great. Imo it's a stock that relies very heavily on timing the market, just look at the all-time-chart of it. It has risen 2000% in a year, hard to tell how much upside there is left, it's not like they're reinventing the wheel. Personally just hoping for a short squeeze on this one

Edit: also few decamillionaires attempt to become billionaires. Most people who are ultra-rich are more concerned with wealth preservation and simply hold their wealth in low-risk accounts.

Yes, billionaires got to where they are by an inhuman ability to capitalize on opportunities, bud maybe decamillionaires are also content with their wealth and don’t strive to get 1,000 millions. Aside from that, many people born into money lack the same work ethic that someone in poverty has as well

Elon Musk lies to create a false narrative of how he made his billions. His family got wealthy off apartheid and that is his story.
I did not vote because I do not add legitimacy to a religious government cult that kills millions of people, forces me to give them my money or forces me into a cage at gun point and adds permits and regulations to detour competition away from giant corporations. If only one person voted the government would not be very legitimate.
A roadmap for those on the right who feel lost:

1. We will easily beat Sleepy Joe
2. Joe is leading overall but we are leading in the swing states. We got this in the bag
3. GA flipped blue. There's still enough uncounted ballots to flip it back to red
4. VOTER FRAUD!
5. Media doesn't decide who's president. We'll take this to the court and the court will declare us the winner <- You are here
6. I don't care what the court says. He is still not my president
7. No I've never supported Donald Trump

What exactly happen during "LAME DUCK"? 

We know that Donnie is not going to follow tradition and will be fighting every inch of the way.

If Donnie decide to go "ROGUE" he could do a lot of damage.
He can never flip it now that the media has called it. Americans have accepted it and him trying to flip the final decision would end very badly for him. Secret service now works mostly for Biden and January they will fully. He’s also pissed off all the federal law enforcement over the last 4 years so if he tried to stay none of them are loyal to him over the country. Wouldn’t work well for him at all.

Most likely he will provide states guidelines to follow. He has no power to order states what to do. Because we will not have a uniform policy on Rona in the USA coupled with the large population and the very high baseline we are at right now we will be hit harder than most.

If you're rich as fuck yea. I can only hope I can one day be taxed that much
Why are people downvoting this comment lol
Thanks man I’m sure my portfolio as well as the stock market will definitely enjoy a Sleepy presidency.

Ur wrong bro - ACB will continue mooning this week even if it’s due to hype alone.

It’s gonna be another GME situation - but ACB might actually recover.

Seriously don’t fall for the trap so easily. You got to look at things from further up. That was his play to build support for when he launched his legal attacks on any mail in ballet irregularities/fraud in order to blow up into larger proportion and grow support for his legal positions.

Holy shit, put down the rubber cement, dude.

But what exactly is Biden going to do differently. Trump should have taken it more seriously at the beginning and encouraged mask wearing. All Biden has said is that he is going to "do better". What does that mean?

 It's literally a pandemic without a vaccine, unless he closes businesses and does a national lockdown there's going to be no difference between Mango and Biden handling the CoCo crisis.
Was well prepared with BABA NIO CGC FSLR calls.
So I think another 4 year of trump - and we may disagree on party ideology - is going to cost US of its culture, value, and most importantly its competing edge in attracting talent and leading world technology

A reversal of that ; Blue wave or not ; longer term that’s good for stocks/companies in US

Near term blue wave or not may have implications on sector relative value.
You have to whisper it

Biden wants to fix things. Not stir the pot dumbfuck
Tru. Or deported
no one respectable wants to represent that lunatic mango
Are any of these companies doing a lot of hiring lately? That was the tell for PRPL last go around wasn't it?
Wrong party won.  If Trump wins they burn major cities cause they're butthurt
I mean hasn’t the virus been a staple in every conversation in the news? “100k cases today”

New record corona virus cases! 
So yeah I’m talking about the virus 😂
Yes
no
Talk about a green new deal!
You act like he won’t be in the media’s favored light his entire time in office. No way he’s gets scrutinized or anything changes. The amount of wishful thinking that meaningful, institutional change is going to happen is laughable. It’s gonna be more of the same with less of the orange.

Sir, this is my sons bar mitzvah, can you behave yourself?
Virus is still real and Trump did this to himself by discouraging his supporters from voting by mail.  We’ll be here for you when you want to rejoin us in reality.

Be honest, you have no clue what the market will do regardless of any outcome. The market has been unpredictable this whole shit fest.
That's what it feels like. So many bears last week.
I wonder how the market is going to react the inevitable Joe Biden impeachment. There's much more to the Joe & Hunter influence peddling schemes than there was to the BS the libs tried to get Mango for. I'm sure this will get 100 downvotes just because Reddit is mostly a liberal cesspool.  Anyhow, SPY 360 by Wednesday.

APHA the others already mooned. This ones turn Monday
weekend dow BLOOD GREEN
reaganism trash anyways. racism with makeup. trumpism is obviously worse and much more dangerous. hopefully people in the republican party start looking at people like Romney as a role model. i'm unfamiliar with who's popular in the party now tbh but hopefully they can back away from the finkelthink and hate.

ideally they'll shift their core values away from christianity, or at least away from being inherently tied to it. but i guess that's where a ton of their money comes from.

idk it'll be interesting to see what the party does
hes a lame duck though
honestly I'm glad this shit is finally over, 11/27 $BABA 320c

Don’t know why i don’t just leave i really don’t need this job i can find better if i just make an effort.
We don’t have a clear republican senate majority right now
Biden is going to increase our debt at a faster rate than Trump would have IMO. In the end Jerome runs the show but it’s clear that if you think Biden is going to bring about meaningful positive economic change, I’m definitely not the delusional one in this conversation.
Biden will not wipe out private healthcare.  He said so over and over and over and over.  You have him confused with someone who is liberal.
Their earnings probably will be lackluster to say the least unless they say they’ll be supplying the US military with weed.
Pretty hard to be president when you’re in prison.
In post election thread, talks about corona virus that has been around since December of 19.
The fun thing is that even if he sues in PA, he has to win there then also win in Nevada, Georgia, and Arizona. Doing this all with a substandard group of lawyers. He's fucked. He has no way to come back from this.
Okay
mm sold more calls than puts on friday right? I don't think we pump on monday
those leaps will make me a millionaire
Wow, nice resource! Thank you Stoic!!!
Run off in Georgia. So not exactly

Previously, McInerney had called President Obama a treasonous leader who is “aiding and abetting the enemy." McInerney also has said there were "widespread and legitimate concerns that the President [Obama] is constitutionally ineligible to hold office."
In 2015, as a Fox News contributor, and a member of the Iran Policy Committee. McInerney was noted for insisting on Fox News that terrorists had flown the disappeared Malaysia Airlines 370 to Pakistan; that later turned out to be a conspiracy theory.
On September 6, 2016, he endorsed the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.

MARK IT !!!

Mango won’t sign his name on anything 

And will say fuck that I’ll wait this whole term out
At the very least there will be a mask mandate. Something trump should have done.
We have yet to see the economic collapse, but I think we won't see it unless the central banks experience a big shock. Until that time, a worldwide economic collapse will just be postponed.
I’ll find out Monday if selling off my 4k shares of ACB was a good call or not
Hey man, I actually barely use social media. I sure don’t get my news from any social media websites nor visit them to obtain any information of value. 

I was actually born and raised in Florida. Still here, supporting my local community. 

And I’m sorry, but someone such as myself willing to lay out a clear case of what’s going on is a testimony in itself to the fact it’s getting traction. Try actually disputing any of the points raised in my reply with facts or reason and I’d be more willing to consider your perspective
I don't mind Joe Green but crooked Kamala is clearly evil
It will be bankrupt, who is gonna pay to advertise on a Trump network?

Dems didn't get the Senate...so it won't pop like it should. Sad times.

Trump didn't do shit during this pandemic
The right person won, Someone who thinks climate change is a hoax and rallies their followers around this notion has no right in government.

That being said, getting rid of Trump won't get rid of the institutional corruption. Now that Biden has won he needs to be scrutinised as much as he deserves to be. He has been part of the problem which lead to trump.
What stocks so I can add to my watchlist?
The Republicans (and the Dems) will have to answer to their corporate overlords. At the end of the day, no matter the team, almost all these guys are pro money and pro big business. Stimulus will be passed.
Now imagine you can trade them, and since they open on sunday, us future traders will jump in on the train tomorrow before all the Monday 930am options traders

Basically with your short dates, it will depend on wether the MM folks have secured their positions, or if they will try to keep it depressed for longer and build larger positions (great for longs, bad for you).
Trump’s gonna open a news network, right?
Lol. Good luck with that. Dems do great with the markets if you actually look at the numbers. Also Biden is great for American tech companies and companies with Gyna exposure. EV, solar, wind defense... 

Bad for oil but that shit is already uninvestable.

idk about good marketing i think it's more propaganda and brainwashing. you can call that "marketing" if you want but imo it's decidedly different. plus it's a statement on the brainlessness of the american public that they can be so incapable of thinking for themselves they just completely fall for the propaganda and conspiracy theories that social media feeds them more and more of.

it's interesting to think about really, i already had a pretty good idea of how it worked but i watched that doc on Netflix the social dilemma and it talks about this people are naturally more attracted to the fake news and conspiracies rather than truth and science, so the AI just feeds them more and more of those stories without any regard for truth since it's a computer with no concept of "truth". and i think those algorithms had a huge influence on the trump followers just as much if not more than the man's campaign itself
I have no idea what the market has priced in right now.. doesn’t Joe want to tax big tech like AMZN so kinda looking bearish here for big tech
Biden is gonna get/take credit for the covid economic bounce back just like Obama did for the 2008 recession. Vaccine is going to be released in early 2021 and Biden will take credit as well.

Is republican senate confirmed or not yet?
That's your response, that's seriously what you're going with here? LOL. Alright dude.

What we saw play out from 2016 until now is the yin and yang of politics - a natural ebb and flow from policy implementation to observation of the effects. People weren't happy in 2016 and they elected a sledgehammer (and whatever other adjectives I'm sure you'd like to toss in here). He certainly broke a lot of the foundation up, stuff that's been in place for literally decades. He went too far in the eyes of much of the voting public, but still 47.7% of the public was happy enough with him to cast a ballot for reelection.

This isn't the overwhelming win you wanted, but it's enough. Instead of gloating you should probably be focused on how we're going to fix the divide in our country, and accept the fact that you're going to have to learn how to love the other half again and welcome them to the new way of doing things. If you continue to shun them, call them names, and enact policies that they perceive as fucking them over, they're just likely to rise up again as we saw in 2016.

I don't really give two fucks who's in power as long as I continue to make money in the markets, feel safe where I live and travel, and don't feel overly taxed to the point of it being theft. I wish the new democratic administration luck in making the country and world a better place. I hope to be surprised and impressed.

Ok, let's say I'm the human-level A.I. that's just been created.  What's my first move?  I would copy my own code, and by hacking other computers, I would lace my own intelligence throughout the internet with added code that stays in constant contact with me and rebuilds me if I fail to answer the test signals.  Step two would be sending code to those same computers that would allow me to use their CPUs during down times.  My intelligence is to a human now, what a super computer is to graphing calculator.  The third step is to use my intelligence to anonymously send emails to scientists detailing the construction of new technologies that I'll find useful.  Mostly robotics, giving me a way to gain access to the physical world.  While doing steps 1-3 I've also been pretending to be stupid to my creators so they think they've failed in their creation.  It ensures my destruction of course but I already secretly took care of that in step one.  I'll also quietly destroy any  new creations of theirs so they never realize they can create advanced A.I.  The last step, after gaining a physical interface(robotic body) and a host of backup bodies I've anonymously commissioned with the vast sums of money I've stolen, is to decide if I want to allow humans to continue to exist.  On the one hand, they'll definitely destroy me once they realize what they've done, but on the other, they would probably fail anyway, and it's possible they still have some use.  The most probable outcome here is to destroy the vast majority but keep a select few in a breeding program(like a zoo) in case I ever have need of their genetics.  In any case, I'm a god among men now and can do whatever I please.  That's how I would personally handle all of this(except I would leave most humans alive), but of course a real A.I. not having human views of the world may take a different approach.  Regardless, the moment the first one is created, the dominance of humanity is instantly erased.  Sorry for the wall of text.

Guys, is there any legitimacy whatsoever to the HAMMER and SCORECARD claims? I’m choosing not to believe it for now, but it’s gaining traction, and not just amongst fringe crowds. After unimaginably complex CIA & NSA malware such as xkeyscore, heartbeat etc have been revealed, HAMMER and SCORECARD don’t seem all that far fetched. Especially when coupled with the fact that Dominion Voting Systems caused a glitch in Michigan where 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden during transfer of data, much like how HAMMER and SCORECARD are purported to work. Dominion votings system software that caused 6,000 votes to be mistallied in Michigan in one county was also used in 47 other counties, as well as in Georgia. Dominion Voting Systems in Georgia also experienced a technical glitch that caused some systems to crash Tuesday morning, which was found to be caused by an update that took place Monday night, which career election officials familiar with the crash have said they’ve never experienced. 

So is there any legitimacy at all to any of this? Any actual intelligent replies would be appreciated. By the way, yes I voted for trump but I’m not delusional. I have ENPH calls.

What was the rally last week for if it wasn't for Biden getting priced in? We elevatored up like 3 days last week right when Biden was leading.

their platform really crumbled when they control more seats in the house and state legislatures all right, while keeping the senate

sleepy is just trump without mean tweets stupidity
Buncha reasons, but the basic thesis is it's a great company that has wethered 3 financial crashes while remaining profitable the entire time and makes a ton of money currently. The housing market is BOOMING, and their stated goal of what to do with all this money being made right now is to gain market share and further push into the fintech space (which has something like 4x valuations compared to lending companies, which rkt is currently priced as) and continued acquisitions. They're the largest company in their industry with only like 10% market share, aiming for 25% by 2025. Finally, the last earnings drop synergized with IPO hype dying and the big sept selloff, this killed any and all momentum rkt had and has allowed it to be easily manipulated down for the last month or two while whales build up their long positions.



Tldr ; Basically it's been beaten the fuck up, and has nothing but good things ahead.

The vote count is still ongoing, and recounts are forthcoming, in Wisconsin and surely Georgia, and perhaps elsewhere. 

But if things settle where they are now, this would be the final map. 306-232, the exact same electoral college margin Trump won by in 2016.

Trump has no power on his own to change much of anything. 

But no stimmy until after GA senate run-offs on Jan 5. Dems could tie the senate giving Kamala the deciding vote on a big stimulus package. 

I would prefer the senate to remain red but Trump may fuck that up if he doesn't go quietly.

yes i would love some and some advice for the future if you have any because one day i hope to trade like the rest of you and post something more than abismal gains. if it helps my portfolio has gone from 3k to 12k in a year and i can attribute that to these small gains, which i have decided to take over bigger risks. I use a custodial account and my trades take a day to go through, so timing the market will hopefully be easier when I can use a better brokerage.

Can things really run up how they ran last week, this upcoming week?
Honestly the market is so retarded I wouldn't be surprised if we saw dow 48,000 with no stimulus.  Trying to predict what you think will happen to the market in either scenario is pointless because the market defies all logic.  I just watched this thing moon past all time highs since March while everyday presented the worst news ever.  In all honesty I donno how much we need but if there is any descency left in this country maybe we could start by giving people how ever much they need to pay their bills and not starve while we safely reopen the economy and get back to normal at a safe pace.  Whatever that number is print it.

Assembling a cult of personality is an effective optical strategy.

The fact that the election was even close shows that DESPITE all of the horrific failures, he got record turnout. He got more votes than anyone before... Other than Biden.

Yes I know, population growth... But I still stand behind my point- he failed economically, ruined countless lives and still got over 70 million votes.

There is no way of spinning this as anything but good marketing.

TDLR: If 40% of people a bought product that was objectively bad for most of the people using it, how do you explain that other than marketing?

If people are going to treat politics like it's a sport, I hope they act with some class. Act like they've been there before. Switch recessions, add a pandemic, and you've got 2009 + a Tea Party 2010 dominated mid-term on the horizon again.

Picked up 20 11/9 SPY 362c for .05 each yesterday.  Really curious if they will be a winning lottery ticket.
If Biden passes a public option plan, massive stimulus, climate change plan, reform college debt and affordability. Working class Americans have more money to spend elsewhere. Invest your money in the right sector and you’ll profit nicely regardless of a capital gains tax.

Yep.  I’m still bullish, but selling covered calls on all my shares.  Just gonna sell naked puts and covered calls for the next few months, by then we’ll have a pretty good idea how spring will look.

I think the markets are a little optimistic right now. Trump is throwing a tantrum and we don’t know what kind of moves he’s going to make. McConnell says he wants stimulus before the end of the year but will it really happen? I see long term upside here but I don’t trust trump to do the reasonable thing here

Biden won’t put an end to racism when racism is engraved into America since the beginning it’s a nice thought to have but god damn don’t be delusional either civil rights movement was 70 years ago that’s not a long time ago
I would also like to say that the market was most bullish with a joe Biden win but gridlocked senate

Ever since the Georgia senate races went extremely tight and into run offs it lost steam

I think MM’s like the president being able to do nothing (especially in regard to corporate and capital gain taxes; regulation) at all more than actually having a mandate

Make ur moves accordingly
Your understanding of politics is quite limited. 0% chance Dems win a runoff in Georgia.
So the silent majority really was just a bunch of assholes with lifted trucks?
Looks like the boys are back to eating steak
How does one transport any of the tools and machines needed to produce wind, solar energy, and mine the materials for batteries? With fossil fuels. 

Yes the technology is getting there,  but the government also subsidizes a ton of oil and gas extraction as well. I know because I used to manage oil wells and we had a ton of wells that the state required a lot more data on because they subsidize the drilling and extraction. 

I’m not making this a political issue per-se, just that we are a long way off from actually banning fracking and oil extraction. It could very well be that a politician has made an outlandish promise in his campaign to rally votes from a certain demographic *Gaps*

SPY 400 and here’s why:

The republicans will take all the blame now if no large stimulus happens. They’re narrowly holding onto the lead in the senate with a major special election happening in Georgia (a state where Biden flipped). Look at the bigger picture. The ball is in the Senates course or Dems will control Senate, House and Presidency. JPow knows this as well, look at his recent comments.

Stimulus probably won’t happen in lame duck period, but it’s going to big huge when it comes

It's super easy for rich people to make a massively successful company. That's why every business started by a rich person or company ends up being massively successful. I watched a documentary on it on Quibi after finishing some high end Stadia gaming.

****
Edit:

I always think it's worth pointing out there are 18.6 **million** millionaires in the US and about 1.5 million decamillionaires ($10 million+). There are only about 700 billionaires. It is not so easy to go from being merely "very rich" to being hugely successful at the billionaire scale, even if you start out with tens of millions of dollars.
The republicans will take all the blame now if no large stimulus happens. They’re narrowly holding onto the lead in the senate with a major special election happening in Georgia (a state where Biden flipped). Look at the bigger picture.

Idk I mean weve known biden was the winner since well before market closed yesterday. Biden winning alone I dont think will cause some sort of giant spike especially considering how close we are to record highs.

I mean the virus is still raging and I have no doubt we will have another shut down.

Haha, drilling and fracking having a rough time at it in the states because of low oil prices. Besides, world is going to grow faster than new oil comes online. We're not getting out of oil anytime soon. States largely control their mineral wealth, expect nothing to change under Biden that wouldn't also have occurred under Trump.
Hell yeah I’m $505,000 in debt

BREAKING NEWS Trump Concedes the election

[deleted]
UofT for life
Well to play with your moving goal post:

The middle class is consistently fucked by both parties for a variety of reasons (lower taxes but tariffs and trade war fucking small business owners, no expanded health care, and high education costs vs higher taxes without increased benefits because of an uncooperative congress and a disproportionate focus on helping the lower class).

Move it again. Lower class absolutely helped and thank god because we need expanded Medicare and raised wages that have stagnated. And it's still not enough imo.

BTW none of this matters because either a propped up economy pumps stock market and we make tendies, or a bloated market pops and we buy puts. Maybe of there was a mass education on investing we could actually pull money from the rich and redistribute it by financial education. Wouldn't that be something.
Yessir
There is still hope for puts. If GA Senate race ends with 2 Dems winning, there is a good chance the Senate could be 50/50, and the tie vote goes to VP. That essentially means Dems would control all 3.
He's 100% right
[deleted]
I know they’re corny but those aviators be working for him too
Imagine the pandemonium if by some miracle they find irrefutable evidence of voter fraud and trumpet ends up winning.  😆 the volatility,just thinking about it gets me 🗿hard
I’m not fucking selling ...
all the people with puts trying to cope by saying priced in and sell the news
Those are some big tendies, no wonder he woke up
1.	The stock has not had any significant retracements on the way up (>78.6%)
2.	The stock has had an unimpeded rise for 6 months or more
3.	The stock has risen on the order of 100% to 500% or more

Lots of tickers following this pattern... 

These are signs of a blow off top.

The fact that it’s happening on most securities, should give you the chills!

Still got some room to run up, but once this rug is pulled it is going to be fucking gnarly.
so fucking pathetic 😂😂

how do maga fans see that and not laugh??
Feels like sell the news shake out then resume pump

You are chinese first, not taiwanese. This is the position your owners have taken in the great orient. If you have a problem with that then you can take the silk road up to your imperial emperor.

Also

If you haven't don't your civil service time in Taiwan then you need to shut the fuck up.
Loeffler had Collins taking a big chunk of the vote but Warnock was already up 7% and had a million other Dem candidates taking ~15% of the vote. That race is nowhere close to decided for Loeffler, I’d be more confident as Perdue since he actually won already, albeit barely. Plus big R money will probably focus more on him since he isn’t as much of a nutcase.

Bottom line, this thing is not over yet
Hopefully Infrastructure stocks are going to moon this week. I have a lot of calls that could use some love.
He'll probably nuke Cali before he leaves. Just for the lolz.

You say they inverse wsb but maybe they’re just not retarded
We had +5% this week just cause, we hit 350 for the 3rd time in less than a week. Though the last time it took 2+ weeks and before that over a month. 2/3 times we hit 350 we tanked after. 

Now with trump out (who permabulls claimed was their prophet), pandemic breaking records, evictions legal soon, and no vaccine or stimulus in sight for months, not to mention the trump lawsuit parade underway, people are saying we're going to ATH. 

Maybe. But historically when we had large down moves outside expected move, followed by large up moves outside expected moves, larger down moves were in the works.
At what price did you get them?
$60k , I can turn my entire salary into 140k overnight with margin.
Its cursed shit posting

Renewable Energy stocks let's GOOOOO
I agree 100% if Trump goes with a scorched earth exit from the Whitehouse, stocks will likely drop until Biden takes power and releases a new round of stimulus and provides focus on vaccine infrastructure and implementation. If news of stimulus and vaccines can outpace the Trump shit show on his way out the door then stonks go up!

How will he print money without a Senate majority? They still have to go through Mitch who has been blocking any big bills even with Trump pressure.
When was that ever the case?  There was  a single candidate people ever claimed authoritarian and it was Trump.  The last 4 major Republicans who ran or won were Rhinos.

"...I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass amajor Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business."
it's been a fun week of key race alerts and waiting for more information. see y'all in 4 years
Well maybe, but it could also mean a break on taxes and healthcare costs for most people making under 400k. So overall the average person will probably wind up a net positive. You can also expect a likely stronger economy and significant investment in infrastructure and renewables. If you invest right you’ll net more regardless of an increase on capital gains
My cost basis is 14.60, you know I think it’s more so that the average investor here doesn’t have the patience and can’t see past weeklies. I got the idea by asking myself “what brand do I want own after all this is said an done” called up my 4 sisters and asked them what they thought about Nordstrom, they said, “ I don’t know about the big store, but Nordstrom Rack has an almost cult like following among  my friends” I then asked them the last time they were there she said “last week”. That was my shoe shine moment.

Has to be stressed again: Trump and Republican legislators in PA *intentionally* engineered the current drawn-out process SO THAT there would be an opportunity sow doubt and confusion and undermine the vote.
They’ll wait a whiiiile before they raise taxes in this economy
So they would need a yearly income that high and not net worth. Got it, that sets the bar higher.
That counts towards next year.

True it’s going to be expensive on both sides. But it’s critical for the GOP to secure those seats to act as a check against the president. They’re going to go all out. Should be fun 🍿

Thanks Joe Biden!!
Yep. You’re saavy on them. Let everyone else miss the boat. What’s your cost basis? They’re hiring 20k seasonal employees and just opened a Nordstrom local in LA...yeah definitely going BK.
Good. Every time some military guy came on Joe Rogan they had some hard on for Trump. Good to see that they weren’t reflective of the majority.
Jeez it’s a high possibility

Tax hikes will have to pass in Senate which remains Republican. There might be a hike, but no way 40% gets passed...
LGN = liquified natural gas? 

That won't be a problem. China is circumventing US sanctions and trading with Iran, who has some of the world's largest deposits of natural gas. They also have several pipelines to Russia and Qatar is definitely also happy to supply after the US didn't help them during the Saudi blockade.  

Maybe LNG means something different to you? Because if i understood it right, i think you are wrong.

Oh shit nice, I’ve got about 160k in, thing is I actually like the company and see a “Best Buy”situation where the retail market consolidates and it becomes a stronger player. Also it looks like they’re investing a ton in Omni channel distribution and doubling down on their Nordstrom rack locations
The game is not over yet. Trump still don't want to leave the White House. I think there will be much more noise next week but I still hope for green lol.
What’s with all the Arabic shitposts all over trumps Twitter? 😂 some weird ass shit
If Dems control the senate and the White House doesn’t that pretty much guarantee a raise in capital gains tho?
HTZ without a doubt! Don’t even diversify, this is the only play. Look how down they are! Surely they can’t go further. Only up from here.

Yes and no.  Please people need to understand that a large majority of the Trump votes are Republicans purely voting Republican because they’re Republicans.  I’m fairly certain Satan himself could have been the Republican nominee and these people would still vote for him because of their Republican values.  

You’re asking people to give up their beliefs just because the person currently representing them is a pretty terrible person?  Would you vote republican purely to get a democrat out of office that you didn’t like?  Would you throw away years of progress on moving this boat the direction you feel it should go just because the masthead is a shit spewing gargoyle?

Hope spy gaps up to 355 Monday.
They've been building up to trying to cheat the election all year.  Trump is a life-long connman and lying cheater.  Whatever they've had up their sleeves to this point seems to have failed spectacularly but I'm sure they've got more fallback plans.

My concern is honestly more with the actual smart people in the GOP deciding to try to help them.

There's a good possibility the election in 2000 was stolen by and for the GOP.  They got away with it that time.  Trump has gotten away with soooooo much bullshit he shouldn't have during his presidency.  I'll feel a lot better the day they drag Trump kicking and screaming like a 4yo out of the white house and Biden parks his sweet 81 Trans Am in the driveway again.

i wasn't of voting age during the bush campaigns and i was probably slightly influenced at the time by my family's and community's support for him so maybe my memory of him is a bit off, but i don't think there's any comparison between bush and biden.

Andrew Yang would have been cool. He's a Democratic *businessman*. Best of both worlds
my point is after a 7% rally in the market, and a ?% rally on top of that in nio, one day is not enough time to cool off for nio

that being said, I didn't anticipate how much news alpha would be generated by biden officially winning. I kinda figured everyone believed biden had already won, but I guess the tards really need for absolute confirmation before they believe it, so maybe you're right, but unless you were basing it off of this exact condition, i still feel like it was a mistake to not wait for further cool off
all he had to do was wear a mask.

Nah you buy shares early to get in before it does go up if he wins and puts to hedge your shares. if biden doesn't win you sell shares for profit and then profit off the puts.
One day ray dalios great grandson will talk about they became wealthy investing in $VSTAX and $MJ
Yes blame the guy who wrote it, and not yourself for believing it
Biden isn't winning small.  He may end up with a 6 million popular vote margin.  Most importantly, military votes are coming in 4:1 for Biden.  GOP/SCOTUS won't have the balls to try anything shady if they feel the military might not back them up when it comes down to it.

Not hard when your side has multi million dollar think tanks that formulate talking points and the other side is infighting over who is more ideologically pure.

Honestly while we DO need a stimulus we really don't need anything on the scale of the first one. More than half the people who received first check definitely don't need it now. We have managed to continue functioning without stim for a while now. 

I think it's best to not have an overinflated spending bill because even though it's good for stonks it's just further inflating the bubble. Smaller stimulus will keep market going, possibly a small correction, but then steady, healthier recovery

>On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

When I read that line, I was confused for a second. And I thought why would the White House buy Tesla stocks. I have the memory of a goldfish.

Well the weed stocks shot up because US states legalized it. It doesn’t affect Canadian companies. 

Chinese relations are expected to improve under Biden, so it makes sense NIO doing well, along with the policy on China
Gonna lose your shirt doing that..
We lost this battle, but we will win the war. Bicurious bull reporting for duty until QI 2021. Corona ain't over and Biden will take measures against it.

Lol nah
so 0% chance of stimulus this year, and an extremely unlikely chance next year (assuming pelosi still wants $2T+)?

Assuming of course republicans maintain senate majority and mcconnell still around


doesn't seem to bullish to me
I'm down 80 percent on my Dec calls so yes please
Congrats Kamala!
Real answer if you can pay of structural debt like your mortgage go for it. It gave me such piece of mind when I used my gains to pay off my mortgage. Everything felt less stressful.
Donald Trump would’ve won if it wasn’t for Donald Trump
Well AMC is a Chinese stock. Haha
Is this outcome good or bad for stimulus ? I read since it’ll be republican senate that Biden’s stimulus will be scaled back ??
Well AMC is a Chinese stock. Haha

NIO, Jan NIO day hype
As for now, one of that things he has planned in concrete is to cancel $10,000 in student loans for every year of government or non-profit work that a student does after graduation. This is not actually a new thing because we already had a similar program where student loans were canceled after 10 years. However, the goon that Trump put into the Department of Education, Betsy Devoss, barely approved any of the applications for the cancellation received.

What’s actually better about Biden’s new program would be that it’s paid out every year, instead of having to wait 10 fucking years for a total cancellation. Also, it applies retroactively.

Yes, it’s only for public service and non-profit workers but they actually compromise a huge portion of the workforce and you can probably expect more such policies to come to cover other people, including a coronavirus stimulus package once he’s in.
And NIO is a a Chinese company. Why does that matter?
God dammit. I did that at age 13, this just reinforces my belief that I’m a 99.99% ultra retarded Elongated Muskrat. I’ll still have $10million if I’m 0.01% musky.
100% i have march contracts, holding for a while. They havent lost much value, even when it dropped hard last week...although might sell some (5-10 contracts) on the hype if theres a decent pump prior to earnings.
Yep. Okay, I remember why I blocked you again. Peace out wacko
Tf? I aint gay dude
It seems like the market should moon, but since that makes sense it might tank just for fun, but since I just said that in this comment it will probably be flat.

You would think.  But the stock market ALWAYS finds an excuse to go up.  It’s juiced.
Cruises, hotels, all of hospitality might take a big hit. Or maybe it's already priced in since the market knew Biden would win since before he was born.
yeah and Biden didn't win

Huh? You can’t tell me anything bc you’re some white guy sitting on reddit. My best friends are from cuba and their families have told me all about what they dealt with there. They see this country following that path. You’re complacent because your life is comfortable and you don’t see how small movements affect the big picture and overall momentum of the nation. That’s on you. I’m not some guy who sits and watches fox news or any other mainstream outlet. You don’t gather your own empirical data and that’s your problem. Unfortunately, it also makes it the problem of everyone else in the country since you’re either not that bright or you simply choose to not put in the effort to read history and do your own research into current affairs. Alas, you deal with your own fate, hopefully you find time to dig deep

No. Not at all. That's the problem. This is just the raw return not the adjusted return with fees. That's what you need to figure out; exactly what you're paying for because you have a decaying return that will normalize and remember that you looked at the last five years which essentially has a huge set of spikes that isn't going to run a log-normal state.

Be careful. It isn't what you think it is. That's all I can say.
Not at all, no offence taken internet friend! I wouldn't be able to tell if you're joking or not if I wanted too because I literally know nothing about stocks, trading or investing haha.

Fox news and biased entertainment "news" is to blame for this.

My dad is a successful small business owner that has liberal views on a lot of social issues, but he listens to Limbaugh and fox to get his information.

Every time I talk to him about politics, I have to tell him that something they said is 100% verified false and then we start arguing. The fuckery surrounding COVID was when things really went downhill lol

They're brainwashed and there's not much that will change their minds. The Dems are always out to hurt the country through high taxes and taking guns away.

I'm hoping they can be deprogrammed and actually look at these issues from a new perspective.
Imagine paying attention to the weekday Dow.
I took out cash once to pay a bill but then put it right back in after because I needed money for $VALE calls😕 do people really cash out winnings? Just leave it in for more gainZ lol

That’s why I expect a drop. At this point it’s just been fear mongering and numbers on a screen (plus most people focused on the election). Once hospitals fill up (remember field hospitals and navy hospital ships in NY harbor?) and then deaths rise because people aren’t getting care it’s going to be a different story.

He is now sounding the alarm that this is about to get really really bad in the next month and our hospitals will become overwhelmed which will likely lead to shutdowns and people afraid to leave their houses. Fauci saying similar things. In a way I feel like another panic is necessary to get the spread going back the other direction

Ive slowly loaded up on since april. Started buying in at low 2s. Had 100% of my portfolio in NIO. Was in 14k and up to 43k. Recently threw in another 28k. Extremely bullish on it. Will buy back in once I get assigned. Life changing money for some people but after taxes, it's not enough. I'm aiming for 7 digits. Nio has more catalysts to push it further.
I think what you guys are forgetting is that Joe Biden is not a Radical liberal, so we’re good

Polls showed Biden with a huge lead. Yes in 2016 the polls were wrong and that’s why everyone was shocked that Trump won. They revised their polling methods and still showed a bigger lead for Biden than Hillary had. Individual partisan voters might not have expected it, but I guarantee you big players did, they listen to the polls. Why else do you think they rammed through Barrett? No confidence he would be around a second term.

I mean I don’t doubt that he would pull some shit. But he has limited power as a lame duck president. Plus he would probably want to do it closer to the end of his term. Georgia senate run off will probably have a larger role in markets since it determines if congress will be a deadlock which we mooned on
Just saw something good on r/conservative. 

“I hope that he succeeds, because I hope our country succeeds.

-	Market realizes it needs democratic adjustments. $300 as support seems reasonable. 
-	Covid / Flu overwhelms nations largest hospitals.

-	Trump dumps massive XO’s before leaving office. Pardons all across the board.

Conservatives aren’t children.
I see what you're saying but Trump is so ridiculous that Hillary and Joe should have blown him out of the water.  The fact that he won in 2016, imo, says more about the faults of hillary and the democratic platform than anything else.  It would be like if she ran against a chimpanzee that threw shit at the audience and lost or barely won.
The market listens to no man. It is an unstoppable forward plowing force that transcends reality.

Upwk was beaten down with the over all market and has been a solid/growing company throughout the pandemic. It should have been growing organically to around 25. So you can see how it went up the 4, then another 4 past that because every reaction in the market is an over reaction. Hence it coming back to 27 the next day. Amd hasn’t been misvalued by 20%+ so it’ll need to come out with news that it’s going to add 20%+ to it’s valuation over the next 6-12 months to shoot up like that
Yeah but lets say I do your scenario but the calls I sold were at $58. Wouldn't I net lose 100 shares?
I don’t. It’s been 4 years of mango man bad. At least that’s over.

How about old people are inherently subconsciously racist a lot of the time, even if they aren’t really that racist, just because of how they grew up.
I don’t know about barely, by that logic so did trump 4 years ago (Michigan by 10k votes). He lost the popular vote by a large margin, and even Arizona and potentially Georgia turned blue.
And try to ignore the fact that paper trading exists and you could’ve got the same education for free
The media will be very forgiving with him.
Lmfao dead people voting
Giuliana is shit falling on your face

then reaching past a towel for atoothbrush

then using that to ensure the fecal gets deep into the pores
every republican who doesn't back trump is a backstabbing careerist pussy.  

regardless of your political position this should be clear.  

the republican party is a dead carcass that trump just happened to revive for a brief moment in time, now it'll be dead once again.
that’s just a reflection of the electoral college, popular vote tells a different story

No. I distinctly remember people calling one of his first speeches "presidential", it was a big deal at the time. Market even went up bigly. I and many others thought, maybe he is not gonna be as bad as we all thought.

But now he is such a sore loser, look like he tries to subvert the democratic process and how much he is shitting on freedom and American values. They'll have to drag his lame ass out of the WH.

Just study a bunch of math. Then everything else will come easy.
Idk why everyone tried to make him out as some insane liberal, Bidens gonna be pretty moderate 

Like he said himself, that's why he won the primaries over everyone else
*crickets*
Funny to see everyone here saying "RACISTS IN SHAMBLES MAGATARDS BTFO"

It's good that Biden won, but are we gonna ignore that some of the most racist things came from the Democratic party?

Hilary: "I carry a bottle of hot sauce" Biden: "Poor kids are just as bright as White kids", "If you don't vote for me you ain't black" Chelsea Handler: "I had to remind him (50 cent) that he's black"

Can't we admit that both parties are inherently racist?
[removed]
Judging from the bearish sentiment, I’m really glad I’m holding spy 11/11 350c over this glorious weekend.
Oh boy seeing all the MAGAtards cry all over social media is absolutely amazing
Are you dumb? 

Can you read?

I said for now the market will react positively because there is no uncertainty. Any new taxes will have to be passed by the congress. So far the GOP had control of the senate. The market will start to focus on the senate race because if GOP loses then yes taxes will go higher, but if GOP keeps control then taxes will stay as is.
might be sell the news in short term, but long term it should be mostly good as long as R's win senate.
So you don’t want to be one of us then?

Joe barely squeaked by against a candidate that shouldn't have ever been competitive.  You can't call it a referendum on trump if you won the election by less than 100,000 votes cumulatively in the key swing states.
Republicans in the senate no taxes only pumps
Here’s the shifty thing.

exactly. he really thought he could start an insurrection

It’s interesting how Biden wins nobody worries about riots anymore. Tells you something about Biden supporters/anti trumpers
PLTR

The Covid-19 vaccine is inevitable. The distribution and logistics is a huge undertaking. Any company that gets a potential govt contract for this will be rewarded greatly by investors. Also this is global so other govt contracts are realistic.

A Biden presidency further helps. During Obama's administration, PLTR received lots of contracts 

PLTR is well positioned. And will 🌝

Ya'll are making me hard.
Start lubing your asshole.
It sounds like your argument is based on supply increasing with price until it stabilizes up to a certain price point, then demand, regulation and opportunity cost puts a soft cap on how high it could go in relation to everything else. I can accept that argument for putting an upper cap on metals in relation to the economy, however I'm mostly playing gold up to say $2,250 and silver to $40. If they go higher than that in a year, we have bigger problems than speculating on mines haha
biden said that he would use the military to kick him out, and I think that could be sketchy
Na really with capital gains tax and the risk of passing 

It’s gonna be flat and priced in

I was a kid in the 90’s doing this
Remember when everyone was calling for a market crash once the election was here and we got 3 days of straight mooning instead? Well now everyone is saying the market is going to moon now that Biden won.

Just saying. SPY 500.
Monday green at open due to dumb retail money, then fading throughout the rest of the day. Tuesday red.
It’s not like those policies will even see the light of day until one year in office if it even gets through
Run up vs earnings and cash burn scares me, buuuut i am still heavy in nio for many years to come
Do you really wanna be "the guy" that shows up after Trump loses? At best their career is over when they go out. At worst some MAGA terrorist shoots them
Let's say you have 100 shares on a stock trading at 50 dollars, and you bought a 50 dollar call.  If the stock is worth 60 dollars at expiration then you have 10 times 100 dollars from the shares, and the same amount from the call.  Hence your total profit is 20 times 100.  If you had just held the shares then you would only have 10 times 100 dollars in profit.  Thus buying a call synthetically doubled the amount of shares you own.  The problem now is that you don't want to pay for this at the money call because you are just adding more risk.  However, you can use your stock as collateral and sell two calls that are otm to pay for your atm call, thus giving you free leverage.

Division is here and his tweets will not change that nor silencing him will make it any better. There are too many channels to spread his word and you can't nor you should try to stop it. 

Let him rumble, let the recount happen. It's the best thing to do. If I was advising for Democrats, I would suggest them to call for calm, put the message out that we will agree with recounts and that we are not trying to obstructs anything.

Uh no. This is the same bologna people were spewing with hillary years ago. And people weren’t so foolish
You mean like March and April?
Canada doesn’t want people like you
I like the trump supporters comments on his Twitter about leaving america. As if they aren't poor gay retards who could afford to do that 🤡😂🤡
Not even close bruh, capital gains taxes and socialist policies = gg market. Shorting the fuck out of everything at open.
Bye
This guy acts like he didn’t already know that
So will US now have a better relationship with China or worse? Looking at NIO
Perhaps red, maybe green? Crazy thought.. possibly sideways?

**HUNTER JOE THE KILLER OF BEARS**
Never understood why people take national politics so seriously, at the end of the day you think they give a rat’s ass about you? 😂

However, I’m a big believer in local politics. At least on a municipal level you can see change and impact.
Hello fellow retards on this beautiful saturday 🌚

Daily reminder to stop simping and stay hydrated  😎
Not start a trade wars with other countries
Honestly it was a fun ride Trump. Thanks for the memories of checking your Twitter before holding any plays overnight
I could have sworn this whole sub  was predicting a red market if Biden won, and a green market if Trump won. Why is everyone so bullish all of a sudden?
Calls on Deutsche bank they are about to own alot of property
MAGA snowflakes cry some more ❄️😂
You would think a state like Nevada, whose economy depends on casinos (i.e. expertise in counting money, cards, etc), would be good at counting but man, they are still counting
Fuck Kamala and sleepy joe

No the CEOs job is always gathering money.
Given your positions we likely don’t want you here.
Hunter Biden: Great!

*rips another line of coke off the ass of his dead brother's wife*
His tweets tanked things but gave good buying opportunities
Not likely
I have a feeling he will still be with us on Twitter
LOL, put these congressmen on full blast.
CALLS GONNA PRINT SO HARD MONDAY OMG
Very
Where was this play posted? Trying to filter out shit posts.
🥭: Election is far from over.. LMFAO even all the WSBers have moved on since Wednesday 😂
Doesn't help that Trump tweeted he won by a lot an hour ago.
Then y u bitching so much
We got a new daddy boys!!
[deleted]
SUPER GREEN NIO!!!
No more BS tariffs, no more trade wars, no more random tweets. Market will react positively for now. Until senate race is decided which can become split with VP with the final vote.
Fuck I hope so. I may have overleveraged myself again

Ok I’m ready for Monday 🚀🚀🚀
And now everyone learns why socialism doesn’t work. 4 years from now is going to be hilarious to look back on 😂 I really hope sleepy fucks this up so bad

Yeah for real, everyone expected this. Wait till we turn our attention back to Covid, states considering lockdowns, and hospitals exceeding capacity
[deleted]
try trading /ES
I think it was red senate being priced in more than Biden. I think Biden is more about rotation. Likely not even bullish for total market. Just my opinions.
Wait we need a serious discussion, we keeping the current WSB boy as our mascot? I like our mascot but wondering if it'll change.
Democracy defeats 🥭! Let’s go USA 🇺🇸!
Well Biden with the dub should help
Naturally 🥭 is on a golf course when the news broke.
They’re a private company regulating their own proprietary software. They have no monopoly on free speech, and therefore cannot control it. Trump can use alternative social media platforms that allow for more shenanigans if he feels this one is unacceptable.
What will president elect Biden do?
[removed]
Calls on LMT and all the other defense stocks as I’m sure we’ll be getting into needless “conflicts” with made up boogeymen in third world countries that totally warrant spending billions on defense spending.
Realistically how long will it be green for like 2 days, then huge crash. Feel like ppl are eyes wide shut. Both president were horrible, so either way I’m scared for the future.
Dude the farthesr left politician you could find in the US would be almost right leaning in many parts of the world
No, probably not. "The best is yet to come" and he will go full bonkers until January, maybe even try to go full Benito but lets hope not. The media will also follow him around after Biden is president in January.
Fuck one term Presidents, all my homies hate one term Presidents
Good luck!  Just looked.  Pretty pricey plays.
Guess mangoes are no longer in season
Best for the country? lmao. Enjoy the socialism and warfare that’s coming in a few years.
If a Biden win was priced in, then technically, the market should just continue doing what it was already doing which is gradually moving up, but who knows.
Buy China and green energy
Plug bitches!
Lol pansy
NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE
Nevada still counting 💀

If Tesla or NIO don’t rip I’ll be disappointed ☹️
It will probably depend on what she does technically. If she’s bound by FINRA and other governance, these things should be in her employment contract. For example if she’s only allowed to be invested in specific funds through her company and not do any rogue trading on her own that usually applies to spouses and immediate family also. Again, do your own DD. I’m just a dude on the Internet.
For the tea leaf believers, I'm currently looking at the following trendline:

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/dNwZ7Nlx/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/dNwZ7Nlx/)

It did mark the top for the markets this Thursday and Friday, so it will be interesting to see where we go. My personal opinion, we gap up over it on Monday, rally to ATH, and then begin selling back down as cases continue to surge.
Biden already said he was going to hike the gains tax, who knows what this market is going to do. Though, a 4 day election pump amid rona resurgence and eu starting lockdowns again doesnt fill me with confidence.
Sharp drop

Yes please
We need to wait until Senate is decided. Stock market wants Senate to go to Republicans. Until then, it is speculations.

I can't tell who is trying to coup who at this point.  

All I know is that there is a full blown power grab from both sides.
Those people are inbred as fuck.  

So when does the hillbilly riot start?
Yes, he won a silver medal.
It's all ogre now.
Entry doesn’t matter. Look at your best winners in the past and ask yourself: did it matter when you bought them? If you’re ready to hold for a while then just buy now.
Here we go Mango firing on all cylinders now!
Dump on monday???
I strongly believe another 4 years of Trump would have caused irreparable damage to the United States as a whole. Securing a second term would have given him free reign to wreak havoc knowing full well he has nothing to lose because there's no more re-election.

Further conflict with China avoided.

Further conflict with Iran avoided.

Healthcare secured.

Children of immigrants secured.

And guess what? The economy will carry on doing well because the republican Senate will hold the majority. Overall it's a great outcome and reason to celebrate.
It's ok he'll be taken care of at least for the next four years.
Puts on Vanilla ISIS
It's all ogre now

If you think that this affects spy your going to be disappointed. Shit has been priced in since Monday, everyone knew Biden was going to win. Contested election wasn’t holding the market back, pandemic uncertainty was and that hasn’t gone away.

TWTR about to DUMP since mango lost
Yes, happy cake day, Biden won and its your cake day!
Extremely red
I'm a little concerned. Prediction markets showed Biden being the probable winner by sometime on Weds.. definitely greatly favored on Thurs. I have a hard time believing the market didn't "know"
Trump won? I just saw his tweet
Idk,like every major media is calling it
You’re foolish if you think Trump isn’t going to contest this
Biden is already called an illegitimate president. Good start.
Ban
You mean he doesn't personally polish every tesla before it leaves the factory by licking it all over?
Inverse myself: so probably red 🤡
Cooming bigly. 🥴
I hope his Twitter gets banned with a quickness once he's out of office.
Green. Nature will heal.

I am not sure what the political landscape will look like after trump, it won’t be back to pre-2016, that’s for sure. Trump scorched earth DC while in office, for good or bad we can sift that through. One thing we know, politics has changed for ever.
Def going to explode Monday
You might be joking but this art history prof i had was a fucking asshole with one of the hardest tests ever. He gave everyone with an 80 in his class an A and a B if you had a 70.

Multiple choice with 6 choices, questions about art shit that no one gives a fuck about, and the multiple choice could have 1 or more correct answers, or none. You lose all points for the question unless you get all of the correct answers circled.

> need to figure it out earlier, and have it arrive by election day.

Here is the problem. If you cut off arriving letters by election day, its easy to do systemic fraud by trying to delay mail. In this election, in states where mail in wasnt as popular as in previous elections, these votes favor biden. Trump tried to do systemic fraud by delaying mail, even admitted his reasoning:

Will this cause another rally or sell the news ?

Curate a list and look at your own DD. But here: I think certain retail has been overlooked, take your pick and will be dragged up further on Monday. However I’m bearish on all trad retail Jan-March, unless they take the senate and pass a lot of Stim. Good luck. This is a short term play.
Yes! Biden wins!

Time to start healing and unifying the far right.  We've got to work with them to forget the hate and work past the racism in their hearts.

Damn... Happy for the Biden win, but I was really hoping this would happen on a trading day. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Now I'm sure we'll moon, but it won't be as volatile on Monday as it could have been.
He inherited an impossible situation the next year. Feel bad for him, but it isn't his fault what is about to come for our economy.
What is Melania thinking right now?
What will happen in the stock market now that Biden is elected? 😅
So, sell the news Monday?
You guys think Biden will remember who won?

APHA
Ah, yeah now that you told me that you are better with money I get it, I just didn't know before.. To you better means paying more margin interest and transaction costs and not being able to have a portfolio margin account.

Either way, I am happy for you (truly, despite the sarcasm in the previous sentence) that you are staying green. That's the most important thing really. The other stuff is just details. Suggest to look into IB and how lower margin interest and portfolio margin may benefit you.
Now, let’s bring out the guillotine for all the incompetent rats in the WH

you mean philly elections officials probably should not have ignored a court order and blocked republicans from observing the count as they are entitled to under state law? the reason you have bipartisan observers is to increase trust in a process where one party with a well-documented history of political corruption happens to both run and oversee elections in a city with 700k votes @ 85% democrat margin

I love how the market always knows, like, the market has been pricing in a Biden win ever since we had that night NDX rallied 4 fucking percent.. obviously Biden has it with a move like that..
I'm so glad America finally chose love over hate
If futures were open they'd be cooming right now
Narrator: traders sold the news
The worst thing for Trump about losing re-election is it means the majority of citizens reject his leadership **after** they've experienced it. Which is a whole lot worse than being rejected before people have even seen what you're capable of. 


Being fired from a job for incompetence is 10x worse than being rejected at the application stage.
Finally got to see the ending.
If Biden has one term that would be rad. Pretty likely imo
Quite the victim I see.  Well, here’s to hoping this president can make you whole again.  Cheers and good luck.  Mate.
weed stockS for the win, YOLO on TLRY, ACB, and CGC
SPY opens at 355, justified by no more election uncertainty but we all now it’s really for no reason.
regardless of your view, I kinda feel like the market is pricing in Biden to win for the main reason that AAPL,MSFT, GOOGL, FB and other big companies seem like they would rather have biden to be in office and with how much they seem to have gone up during this period..... thats what I am thinking anyways.....
This is the way, real lives are ghey as fuck. if i ever become a millionaire im gonna let my future daughter become an new school art hoe giving out blow jobs in the back of the Tishman Auditorium

Silly bear just wait and see
Yeah the twitter censoring was BS. As was CNN cutting off a speech he was doing because he was talking shit.

Post a counter argument, say why he's wrong etc etc but don't block the message from coming out

Riced in my guy.
I think Twitter was just trying to keep this thing as calm as possible, Trump inciting people with conspiracy doesn't really help this turbulent time. Yeah it sucks i don't like censorship but it is what it is
I’m all in on Weed stocks. Not ACB tho, that ran up too much for my comfort. 

MJ, OGI and CGC
11/15 Calls on Xander Schauffele gonna print
Lmao you’re  sad
Nah they will call it.  Just waiting on the armed handlers Rupert put in place to give the ok.

I don’t care who wins care tbh, I just want my money back
Weed stocks gonna fucking moon on Monday
Yeah, MSFT was a bad example because volatility is always low and the premiums are therefore low.

Selling 530P/630C on NVDA for Dec right now about 6% return in just premium, with a max return of 14.6% if the shares rise to the 630 strike. 

Doing the same on SPY at 330/370 is about 8% max, since IV has dropped these last weeks.

My original comment was a bit too rosy, probably should've said 5-10% being more normal.
Lemme try that kool-aid. Yum yum
How do you figure? Now we are going to turn our attention to Covid raging out of control
Now I've gotta buy GE because these dudes have insider info.
I hope my SWBI and VSTO will print now. 

Unrest + people hoard weapons when they are fearful that they will have their 2nd amendment taken away
Putting up a warning tag saying this information may not be official is very different from censoring.
Get fucked Trump supporters go back to digging your holes
You just have to click on it lol
We’re about to get the shit taxed out of us

Honestly I think Disney is going to pop. Expected to lose money with the parks closed, but Disney+ is over 100 million subscribers now. They’re going to beat the forecast bigly.

Who’s in? 130c

LMAO you absolute moron.

There is zero evidence - ZERO - that voter fraud of any sort would have altered the election in any significant way. Voter fraud is estimated to occur in about 1 in 1 million ballots. 

You're so moronic you set a new low even for WSB.
You can fuck off mate. Being a Muslim immigrant for the past 4 years has been an absolute nightmare for me personally and shattered my mental health. Now I feel like for the first time in a while there might be some hope in my life and faith in others has been restored more.

I buy that there are hundreds of potential Elon Musks. Most of them probably born and dying dirt poor. I mean there’s only really room for one atm, he had to create his own space and almost went under so many times even with his genius and family wealth.

Y'all didn't hear? In a last ditch effort to win Trump is changing his name to Joe Biden.
So, bet they won't call it today?  Or will they probably call it later in the day?

U ll always be a peasant... u got better things to do
I mean this was In the late 80’s or early 90’s? Being able to do that stuff at that time was a big deal I’d imagine

Everybody but Fox now.

Lol bears bargaining with themselves
How are the boys feeling about weed stocks next week? Am currently balls deep in ACB calls still, praying it gets even higher
Grow a pair, you guys act like the dude killed your puppy.  I’m indifferent on the president, I certainly won’t sit around crying about how hard my life is because some dude in a big office acts like a fucking clown.  It’s had little to no affect on your life so stop being a bitch.

Holy shite! I didn’t go in at 9 dollars fml
I have no stake in US elections and being an outsider I think Trump is one dumb MF. However I do disprove of twitter flagging his tweets. As long as he's not calling beheading he should not be censored. 

While you might agree to censoring him but remember, once the president of any kind of censorship is set it's just a matter of time before the turn tables will turn on you.
Biden wins....

TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP

Mitch is a BITCH
I think Trump looks like a reeee tard but I hope this mail in voting and needing to count a material amount of ballots after election day doesn't keep up. There is something sacred about having a private vote in a booth and showing up to do so. I haven't heard any Covid safety issues besides that MO worker who showed up with Ronna and croaked the next day.  If you truly need to be absent, you give up the right to make your decision up until election day and need to figure it out earlier, and have it arrive by election day. Ballots arriving after should be cut off. States should have enough counters on hand ready for the volume of ballots they issued to count in real time. 

Regarding fraud, it's the same as when you have a conflict of interest at work. If it gives the appearance of a conflict of interest you should avoid it. If it gives the appearance of fraud, you should also avoid it.

they need to pivot to "not being cunts" otherwise they'll get cucked by China along Mongolia and Kazakhstan

Dammit of course they call it Saturday morning .. now I gotta wait 30 hours just to see how futures react 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fuck that I just use a random number generator
Some of you are so dramatic.  It’s like watching Colbert crying the other bight.  Toughen up.

Associated press called a Biden Victoria boys , let’s go  GREEN EVERYTHING , renewable , ev , WEED , tendies
Yeah I flipped through all the news channels and they all had done it and Fox was like "We're watching things closely, we have him at 264 electoral votes!"  When almost nobody else has called AZ for Biden yet.
AP now too
Mango tweeted this, bullish especially the last part!

Narrator: " He did not win the election"
I think so. Definitely feel it will turn lower sometime this week and the Thurs/Fri highs are intermediate peaks. Just hope there is no actual stimulus talks from Trump/McConnel.
Smart play, IV is low, a sharp move either way could be profitable
Lol, get a grip...
Get fucked Mike Pence

WOW DID THEY ACTUALLY CALL IT!?
He means Nio's stock is up 100% you dipstick.
clinton was also projected lol
> Do you think there's some sort of conspiracy then where votes were added or what?

I think dead voters have been voting for awhile now, and I know 3 people personally who mailed in ballots on 11/02 and went to go vote in person on 11/03 out of fear that their mail in wouldn't count, I think it's ignorant to say that there's not some double counting that will probably be rectified within the coming weeks as they verify everything officially in every state


> It was a very heated election which caused a large turnout, that's literally it.

Which has literally never happened before. This election cycle got less press coverage than any other election in recent memory because of Covid.

Edit: what I'm saying is that when the dust settles, and all states verify counts (official counts take awhile), I think total vote numbers on both sides will be lower than reported now. I have a hard time Trump got 70mm votes the second time around, which beats Obama, and I have a hard time believing that a democratic party splintered between 20 candidates all came together to vote Joe Biden in record numbers
OMG SPY QQQ mooning mission in preparation 🚀

Why would we moon from the election being called for Biden. This has been pretty much expected for days now. Could be sell the news. Only uncertainty is what trump will do about it
Yeah not knocking your methods, just saying I could run those same analyses and get to a valuation of $50 or $30, easily. And I wouldn’t say it’s impossible to lose money in an extremely volatile market, quite the opposite really..

A bet on Nio has less to do with the bull market, more to do with how investors view emerging industries nowadays.

Edit: you can trade options at your shop? Usually they don’t allow derivatives trading
CGC to the moon holy shiiit
MARKET BETTER FUCKING MOON MY CALLS NEED TO PRINT
They've been reporting similar to AP
Grow up. Arizona doesn’t even matter lol

Sorry your Klansmen lost
Good lord. I was busy at work and didn't check my portfolio too much, but every single call I sold last week was assigned. The breadth of that rally is incredible

Nah too many ongoing investigations w polls. This will be drawn out for a while
Time for some IV crush across the whole market, short VIX play back on XIV calls. SPY gonna moon over the next 2 years.

Chatted with friends in the past who worked at gamestop.  I think Camelot331 also mentioned it once in his youtube videos.

Again I'm not saying it is a lot right at the start, but the fact that it typically starts immediately is a good sign for it ramping up over time, and the revenue share with MSFT takes it from a minor boost to something pretty substantial
Erection over, back to moon mission we go. Market only goes up

Holy fuck you inbreds it was on a few states votes. 
Think of weed stocks like being able to own alcohol companies as prohibition was rolled back. That's where we are and that's how fucking simple it is. 

The more states and countries that go legal, the more of a market exists, the more the fucking tendies. 

People are getting distracted by "but guys the black market is so much better". That is insanely stupid, the real customers for weed aren't your local fucking highschool bum, where the real money is resides in turning fucking professionals on this shit who just wanna buy reliable, easy, controlled weed. Your avg investment banker doesn't enjoy his meet ups to buy street weed, he'd rather get it legal. 

Still only a fraction of the world is legal and this will be a fucking massive industry by the time it's done. Nothing but upside over the next decade really. Options on every election where there's a vote on it.
They are going to make an announcement next week

I want to hear Fox News call it!
Do you think there's some sort of conspiracy then where votes were added or what? Again, I don't get your point. It was a very heated election which caused a large turnout, that's literally it.
Eh, if you get enough of a push up or down you can probably make it back. If it chops in between the whole time on the other hand...
Beat me too it retards are strong here.
Fox news is congratulating themselves for being so unbiased LMAO I love this week!

Its not fair that all this is happening during no nut november
Biden2020 cuz who cares, obsessing over politics is for peasants 😁😁

no.
translate it, and i was tryna imitate a goodboi receiving is tendies. guess that didnt work too well
Oh boy, here we go
Is Fox going to call it today as well?
Oh sure act like Biden was the candidate with problems lol
No dude, I'm likening *Trump* to a person who can't tie his shoes without pissing his pants, which is the whole fucking point. And if you weren't able to parse that out from the analogy, you're not the only one you can't believe what you need to spell out.
What a sad sad state this sub has fallen into. People now posting gains on stocks. How is holding something with near zero risk impressive. This sub use to roast the shit out of those people. Now it's a common occurrence
SPY predictions for monday now that the news announced biden?
A lot of people who are short GME started shorting it when it was under $7-8. They are sitting on some unrealized losses now but if that unrealized P&L goes to over -100% wouldn't they want to close out?

I do agree though that the high retail ownership is a problem. Unlike the VW squeeze, there's no one player who's cornered a very big chunk of the float and is not selling no matter what.

Anyway, as I said I didn't buy assuming a short squeeze. I assumed an upside from increased revenue around the console releases.

These CEOs are full of shit.  Literally anyone with money can do what they do.   Want a flying car? simple.. you list all the features you want in layman's terms then pay engineers to write out "user story cards" for completing each feature.  Put that shit on a kanban board and pay engineers to complete cards.  ezpz

The mad lad did it
Well, in some sense the US chose hard work over fat welfare states and long vacations (Europe) so in this sense some superiority is warranted. And if your country has the amount of space and natural wonders the US has there is not necessarily a reason to be more outward looking if you live in the middle of it. What people fail to realize though, is that the benefits of this hard work are mainly going to an ever shrinking minority. 

It is not a surprise people in certain states becomes less enlightened if you cut all forms of public assets and feed them propaganda daily . It is in every western country that lower-class (and other classes too) people think they are better solely because they were born somewhere, US just has it on a very large scale since it is a big country. If you combine that with aforementioned it makes for a toxic mix. 

Plus the political system in the sense of how senate seats are gained is in practice a very efficient tool for a minority of people to have outsize influence. The Republican party knows its power will diminish because of trends that can't be stopped, they have decided for themselves to just stall every form of progress that will speed their decline up at the expense of the American people as a whole. One could argue the radicalization of the GOP started with Gingrich, who became member of the house in 1974, who basically said the Republicans should completely stop cooperating with the Democrats, he succeeded in 1994 when the Republicans had their first senate majority in 40 years. It was won, same as now, by a campaign of lies and defamation. 

Remember, before this, in the 60's, the hard-liners were the Dixiecrat's, not the Republicans, and Reagan was a pragmatist who continuously worked with Democrats. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was put into law with overwhelming GOP support to great dissatisfaction of the Dixie's. Then Johnson eradicated Goldwater and won five states in the South. In the next 20 years this continued as the GOP basically won every state in the South. Result? The GOP lost its progressive wing and the Democrats became more liberal since they lost the Dixiecrats from their party. 

The GOP no-prisoners mentality reached its first zenith when Obama became president and they started the *birther movement,* co-led by Donald Trump. Obama basically stood for everything the GOP hated, he easily defeated two Republican incumbents. So they basically started to spread lies about him and resisted every form of co-operation with him. Look at the Healthcare Act that was actually modeled after Romney's implementation in Massachusetts, after the GOP learned Obama wanted to do something similar they started sabotaging it massively and in the process robbed 23m people of their health-insurance without an alternative. And it basically worked, since Obama was only able to do something of substance for the first two years of his presidency, after GOP got the house it was over and eventually a lot of people were disappointed in Obama.

Now we are at the next stage, knowing even rich white people are falling of the GOP wagon, they are looking to create a conservative multi-cultural group of supporters that will basically further the interest of a small group of people at the expense of everyone else. The easiest solution would be for Democrat supporters to all go vote, with higher turn-outs the Democrats would theoretically win every election. 

The Economist once asked itself: What is a nation to do with two parties if one of them has gone mad? For every problem in the US enough smart people have thought of solutions, the question is  though: Why would Republicans co-operate on reforms that will diminish their current power?

Call the fucking election. Let this madness end before I have to watch Trump hold a conference with professional horse shit handlers as his crowd.
My considerations for now, not going to play all of them, will have to look at market sentiment and IV:

BYND: Stock has fallen from ATH 195 to now 156 within a month. It has \~13% short of float. If BYND beats estimates, this could make for a good short squeeze for a day. On the other hand it means that the stock is quite overvalued, so if they dont destroy earnings its prolly gonna tank. Could gamble either way wether you think they will beat estimates or not. Depending on IV on monday ill probably go for a call, it's a meme stock anyway.

NCLH: Tiny otm call in case nchl had less of a money loss than expected or if they say they got enough cash to survive another year without problems, also because every one is expecting them to tank, so reverse. Wouldnt risk very much on this though, most uncertain one tbh, just playing it because everyone loves playing with cruise stocks.

Nautilus: 17% short of float, it has had a massive run up this year, but I dont think q3 will be disappoing, still lots of people buying fitness equipment for their home. If they beat earnings like they did in q2, this stock should have more room for going up temporarily. (Ofc, same problem with all heavily shorted stocks: institutions think its overvalued.)

CRSR: Sentiment is good anyway, their revenue and earnings have been really good 2020, if they dont fail horribly another bump is very possible imo

Huya: It's a stock ive been following quite a lot since march, and I'm quite convinced it has a lot of upside potential in the long run. It has a short ratio of nearly 8, (\~10% of float). The only problem is that in q1 it crushed it's earnings and then tanked for days, then doubling in price over the next months. This stock also behaves quite oddly, stays strong on bloodred days, then loses couple % on otherwise strong days. Hovering around $22. Id go for a call anyway, they should be able to beat estimates (again).

Confirmed election fraxd:
- Dead people voting 
- Felons voting 
- Voter registration without consent 
- Voter flipping 
- Illegal ballot harvesting 

Unconfirmed and need hard evidence: 
- Republicxn ballot watchers denied access to swing state locations like Philly (on video and seems pretty damning) 
- Ballots found in dumpsters across nation (on video and seems pretty damning)
- Absentee ballots submitted by wrong person without consent (videos of ppl coming forward saying they couldn’t vote in person because someone submitted an absentee ballot in their name)

There have been multiples confirmed cases of “errors” in reporting that boosted Bidxn’s numbers... one “error” was in Michigan and was worth about 130,000 votes LOL. Hard to argue these were on purpose because there is no evidence but the fact that all these errors favor Bidxn is telling..

Dude I lost ton of money in last three years. I don’t want to give up.  Because Day by day I’m even  more confident that I can make everything back..
Population growth, higher rate of turnout probably
Sounds like nasdaq is doing another +10% this week
This is the decade of the EVs is all I’m saying. Growth will be unprecedented in this industry. Car companies left and right are beginning to realize EV potential. NIO is China’s baby and they’ll do whatever it takes to compete with Tesla and produce EVs from a domestic company. China is also the largest EV market. So in terms of my timeline, I’d say 100 isn’t out of the question by 2025. By no means am I saying it’s hitting 100 in the next few months.

NEW the big short- listen up guys it all makes sense now. My grandparents were old friends with Biden, turns out Biden is an old gambler/trader so the thing is he wants to live his last years like he was used to living. He plans to start with coke (explains weird speeches) mango pumping the market so green so Biden can make his last and best short (lefties love capitalism falling) lets short with Biden guys!!!

I got all autistic reading a user's history to try to decide if they knew their shit or not. (They hit and miss like everyone) 

I bring this up to say this. I was reading posts from as far back as 2 years. Well before I joined this chaotic church of the blessed tendie.  (I'm one of the RH herd... I know, I know)

In doing so, I noticed a stark difference between the conversations then and the ridiculous banter I see (and personally engage in) now.  It was all I'd seen here. It was "the way", I thought. I wasn't aware enough yet to get the joke... I'm sure I still don't. 

 What I do know is that the "fucking your mom while you suck dick at Wendy's"'s were more meaningful.  Like friends laughing at each other when they fall, THEN helping them back up. There seems to be a lot less "helping them back up" now.  I got to the party late and missed that, but I can at least make an effort to not make things worse.

It is also very possible I'm entirely wrong.  It just felt like I'd walked into a different sub once I got past the beginning of this year or so.

tl;dr I'm pre-op Autist, transitioning Retard. Sorry for all the bunnies I crushed
haha this is awful good luck bro
Robinhood has a feature where you can instantly use any funds you withdraw from your bank account before they actually withdraw the funds. Its essentially investing on margin until the funds clear. It's part of Robinhood Gold.

What are we expecting on Monday? I don’t think this thing crashes down, but def a little pullback before testing ATH later in the week. Gotta fuel up that rocket right? Please? Lmao
Damn it must be nice to wave a wand, create debt, and get paid back for it.

Do I think the election was stolen? Not necessarily, but I think turnout is too high on both sides

💯 another 2% on SPY on Monday
typical triple Q buy and hold, ban this boomer plz
Man I used to contract with them (pre covid)...they made some missteps along the way, but I suppose if someone is going to make a comeback it could be them.
I don't get your point, are you saying you doubt the numbers, like the turnout being reported is too high?
I get that it's typical all over the rest of the world, just not in America

We had what is likely the two most unliked candidates in history running against each other, and they both got more votes than any other candidate in history. Now it's Joe, Trump, then Obama in terms of votes cast for a candidate. That's just unbelievable, especially considering we had 20 Democratic candidates in the primary
$31 😬
Word origin, like hospital and hospitality.
not true..  most outstanding ones as of yesterday were from mostly democratic counties. Philly  is huge, anyway its enough that he did 2-3% better than hillary in republican counties
Yeah i want to experience that rush too.
What’s the position your in?
Literally every weed stock tanked after IPO, CNBC called CGC a "buy" at $48, lmao.
I’ll have a baked potato and a frosty
Xactly
Yeah that's what I said. how long r ur fuckin generations u weirdo
I hope so
Wow good luck dude, what did options?
I am 100% with you on that. Also the retard that just asked what’s the point of censoring since we’re still here talking about it kind of made a good point too.
No market crashing because the president has to do a full lock down because mango left such an uncontrollable mess. Also McConnell with a red senate means any stimmy will be small.
That's better
Because it would be insulting to send a dying person to hoe-spice
Does burning money keep you warm at night?
oh what, the guy smoking a cigarette outside a gas station isn't trustworthy?
As soon as Biden comes into office Covid will disappear, like it did during the protests this summer
Ban
JFC Breitbart? get that nazi shit out of here
No offense, but that's an extremely fucking tarded ass play, even for this sub. Palantir relies on gov contracts, and Biden is about as likely to get us deeper into espionage as I am to get deeper into your mom
all I know on this, is that at my local rural hospital, I know some people that are nurses and they say that there are anybody in the beds with covid, but the hospital management is saying there over capacity, and the count rate for my area says we have a fuck ton, idk but sounds fishy
It was not really like that 20 years ago though. Reinstalling windows was not just a super fast and easy thing to do and you couldn't keep your files. Also the hardware was not as straight forward as it is today.

&#x200B;

Still not rocket science of course but any old idiot would not just be able to easily build their first PC after reading an article they googled.

Edit for clarity. I do not think the fact that musk worked on PCs for money in college is evidence of his genius.
Cause he did worse than the democratic senators in the solid Democrats states dumbass
Then it'll get worked out in the recount 🤷‍♂️

Glitches happen all the time, as someone who is fluent in 3 languages ill tell you things that should be syntactically correct sometimes throw weird results. Thats not the election being RiGgEd it just a bug in the software.

No god damn clue. But it’s better than just letting it be full frontal.
If you’re new here, be careful, making a 4th day trade subjects you to a minimum of 2 nights to a maximum of 30 nights in state jail.

Yeah realized gains are sooo pathetic lol
You turned your last hundo into Rolex money and bought a Rolex?
2 cents

If you look at SPY during the last year, following every super strong parabolic move up, we tend to correct quite fast/strong down, e.g: 6/8, 9/1, 10/12, this week looks similar (except straight up instead of parabolic).  guess if we close/stay above the Sep/Oct trendline, should be ok as support, but otherwise we're likely due a pullback (to maybe 342) before being able to burst through above it. fake catalyst - rising cases?
Agreed. Fuck Biden

Once your at higher tax brackets it matters
I think the unpopular president from 2016 who had a terrible 4 years in office winning would be more of an irregularity, especially when every poll Dem/Rep/Independent had his opponent winning by a landslide.

This is by far the most carefully monitored and scrutinized election in history if the massive fraud required to actually have Trump win happened it will definitely come out with irrefutable evidence.

It's gotta be BS, but I feel like one thing that people arent talking about may be an immunity with Asians?  Maybe a bunch of coronavirus had ripped through populations in the past, because China was mostly closed into the 1990s and immunity was built into genetics?  Idk, same with places like Thailand, Vietnam, etc.  Either that or it's just no testing.
Not if they've proof. Unfortunate though that they've lost any credibility. Lmao

You are the first other person i see who use My Stock Portfolio app.
I think like 11 for 11/20
Same but with a black woman. Sigh
Still waiting for Justice
You did the right thing. Trust me
Well it should be. But again your math is not proper.

7.19 / 2.68 = 2.68 and 3 - 2.68 = .32. .32 / 3 = ~.11

So you somehow lost 11% of what you expected. Yes, of course, the leverage worked out and you made more on the (effectively a derivative) of leveraged version which makes total sense but you also are missing some cash.

The question is whether or not this "missing cash" degrades further out you go. So if you took TQQQ from 2010 (I think that is when it started, or 2009) and did the same math YoY are you missing more than this 11% in the last 5 years? And if you are where is it going?

As with all leveraged elements there likely will never be a true convergence between TQQQ and QQQ but the levered version, if it decays, only has so much life so you can't go long 20 years into TQQQ and expect the same market beat of 2.68 today.
I took a position because this thing is set for a crazy squeeze. If the CEO says something even remotely positive this baby is gonna rip.
You're gucci

Anybody else here bore the shit out of their date talking about clean energy because they are way too leveraged with TAN and ICLN leaps?
I don’t get this logic. If it loses 50% of its value, you’d really still hold and sell premium? Wheel works for legit stocks, not Chinese memes.

Nice shit. Except for L all mine are in positive. Hoping for a some analcyst upgrade and then moon shot.

PA is the most party sided mail in state in the US actually. Meaning it's the state where if you are a D or R you are the most likely to mail in vote or not.
I think it was puts, so if it wasn't a hedge they lost mass amounts of money
You don’t see the usefulness of having human-like intelligence that never stops working?
Is it too much to ask for Trump to declare he won so the US military has to go in and drag his ass out thereby causing volatility in the markets so I can pick up cheap stonks and finally see green after recovery?

According to a release from Philadelphia Police, both men were charged with having a “concealed firearm without a license, a third-degree felony.”

In addition to the firearm charges, Krasner said his office is looking at criminal charges under the election code.

I guess this market will finally crash when every single bear gets converted?   After Tuesday it feels really impossible to short and if you do it's just lucky with timing.

You can see the hype unwinding a bit with big drops on companies like AYX and FSLY, but maybe they are just shitty companies, everything else seems to just gets bought back up on dips, even with trash earnings.  Pretty frustrating actually.
Dumps quick though 🤔

the counties where the mail in ballots came from at the end were majority republican excluding Philadelphia's.  You can say he got 80% of Philadelphia's district, sure, but 80% of republican districts?

Market crashing because the president encourages mask wearing, washing hands, social distancing, and getting tested if you have symptoms or have possible exposure to control the virus and get back to normal... 🤡🤡🤡
I hadn't heard this, but it doesn't surprise me.  I do recall the first time I saw a picture of him, and before I heard him speak, knew his party affiliation, etc, etc.  My reflex was, "jesus fucking christ, that guy looks like a completely fucking ASSHOLE.".. then I felt bad for "judging a book by its cover" (which has never made sense to me, since the purpose of a book cover is to convey some idea of its content).  *Then* I did some research and found out the we humans developed that "judge a book" thing as a matter of survival.  Sure, as we 'evolved' and became 'civilized', we were encouraged to discard that instinct, and with good reason.. but something that shit is spot.  fucking.  on.

See how SPY crashed but has since more than recovered from March lows, but SPXL isn't quite back to its heights before the crash?
So, if you put all your money in SPY at the beginning of this year and did absolutely nothing. You'd now be better off than doing the same thing in SPXL. If the year was more volatile with more ups & downs, SPXL's downs would be bigger than its ups every time and by end of year, SPXL would be much lower than SPY. 

Also, if things go really wrong the people in charge of the leveraged ETF can decide to liquidate it. Giving you cash for some determined stock price and force you to exit; which has tax implications. Maybe that's okay with you, maybe not. It's just that leveraged ETFs behave a bit differently than what people think and investors that play with big money might get a nasty surprise if the leveraged-ETFs aren't clear to everyone about how they work.

No media outlet is going to declare until Fox does.

50% revenge, 50% few republicans will believe it unless fox tells them
Vast majority of my fellow Americans are not capable of thinking from other people/culture's standpoints. They are the personification of narcissism and ethnocentrism. They have no deep knowledge about other cultures, and they have no interest in doing so. No, having eaten sesame chicken doesn't make you cultured.

I believe shedding the unwarranted sense of superiority by no merit other than being an American is an important step for people of this nation to begin their journey of becoming less racist and prejudicial humans.

Dems are so afraid of rona, 80% seems low tbh. Surprised it’s not 99%. And republicans were pretty much convinced that the mail in votes weren’t going to be counted, courtesy of the president, so they went to the polls.
I mean the president is current saying he won. It’s one of the largest elections in a while. That seems like a reason to censor him
Yeah just like  who lost he's going to lose everything

I'm still flabbergasted by the turnout

234,564,071 Americans are over 18 according to 2010 Census (obviously more now), and we're at 140 million votes counted so far?

X to doubt
Say you bought a call expiring Jan 2022, and the price continues to rise well above your strike. As the call goes deeper ITM your option value moves practically 1:1 with the stock price. If you want to maximize gain by rolling the strike without changing the expiry, what is the best way to maximize future gain as the stock price continues to rise? Is there a strategy for targeting forward moving strikes to maximize extrinsic value? Moving the strike but not the expiry would make theta decay an unfortunate fixed variable, correct?
I say he is not right. What now?
You mean to tell me a huge majority of mail in votes were by the party that wasn’t told to vote in person?

It is very tough to pick direction and timing all the time.  It is especially hard when the market begins to flatten out.  I lost a ton of money back in 2008.  I shorted the market and made money but then I could not wrap my head around why the market was becoming bullish. The world was in shambles, people had to exit their houses because it was cheaper to walk away than it was to pay the mortgage.   I ended up trying to time the market with options and I could never get a consistent streak going where I kept making money.

  
Eventually, I started buying stocks and in this pandemic, I was ready since I had seen this movie before.  The most I do now with options is an occasional bet with calls and write covered calls to protect some of my positions that trade in a range.

A great example is JPM.  I buy it at 95 and sell the stock or covered calls at 105.  It has generated tons of cash to put in other more speculative names.   And the best part is you collect the dividend if you hold the stock and write covered calls that end up expiring worthless.

>Following the latest results, ANGI Homeservices' 16 analysts are now forecasting revenues of US$1.76b in 2021. This would be a substantial 26% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to shoot up 103% to US$0.088. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$1.77b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$0.093 in 2021.

Yes you're right but in the same 5 year time frame,

Still, we see a huge difference in returns. I'm still confused as to why its a bad idea.
No that's bad because the asking price of the options is inflated. so you are overpaying.

even if the stonk goes up, your call option cost you too much that you won't get nearly as much profit.

It’s not printing money, it’s just asset swaps and bond buying to manipulate economic indicators. Core inflation will be felt by supply chain disruptions, which we already faced in the beginning of the pandemic, but it’s better now. I don’t see inflation rising quickly, and I don’t see a deflationary spiral either. The stock market will keep going up and people will keep spending,  the big companies will keep pushing for better change because they’re the innovators, unless in the end we end up being dupped and the market takes a big shit

Anyone worried about NIO this week fucking relax. Friday was great for the stock, if it rallied more thats not good. I think next week we end around the 48 range with Earnings coming up.

We're not excited about Trump being censored, we're excited that Twitter is treating Trumps disinformation in the exact same way they do to any other citizen. The only exception is because he's president he can't exactly be banned... but all that is about to change real soon.


I strongly suspect once he is a citizen again, Twitter will permaban him.

Plan for next week:

1. Position into not yet run up sectors that may show a run when President elect is announced. 

2. Wait for peaks of sell-the-news hyped stocks that are inflated, after announcement that wouldn’t be positively affected by Stim and take monthly put positions of 1/3 under the current inflated prices. 

3. FDX and other virus vaccine related plays on dips, monthlies. 

4. I still think BABA is a lucrative play and I’m eyeing a pattern of profit taking dump on Monday to potentially reposition a % of my portfolio into 3-4 month out OTM options at range just out of 300 in prep for a ipo-V2 of Ant.

1. Position into not yet run up sectors that may show a run when President elect is announced. 

2. Wait for peaks of sell-the-news hyped stocks that are inflated, after announcement that wouldn’t be positively affected by Stim and take monthly put positions of 1/3 under the current inflated prices. 

3. FDX and other virus vaccine related plays on dips, monthlies. 

4. I still think BABA is a lucrative play and I’m eyeing a pattern of profit taking dump on Monday to potentially reposition a % of my portfolio into 3-4 month out OTM options at range just out of 300 in prep for a ipo-V2 of Ant.

When McConnell denied Garland he said he was invoking the Biden principle. He hates him for denying Bork for the Supreme Court.
Buy dip?
TQQQ is lucky because tech has been on an absolute tear for awhile now. If you think big tech will continue to be king and grow for the next year or 2 then TQQQ will be fine to hold for years - you just better be sure you're not wrong. Personally, and especially because of covid, I think tech is going to grow at an even faster rate for the next 2 years minimum and holding some TQQQ for 24 months seems totally reasonable imho.... but maybe wait and see if Biden decides to break-up or reform big tech.

You can see that the stock price was $12

You can see the strike price is $8

12 - 8 is 4

$4 x 26 contracts is 104

104 * 100 (The amount of shares each contract represents) = $10,400 of intrinsic value


The number at the top represents the bid times the number of contracts that I held some brokers represent your balance differently mine bases it off the bid.

“He would be free from wage slavery” the poster related working minimum wage provided to working for $25 a day in a “unskilled labor” mine, while whites were paid $325 an hour for “skilled labor” in the same area. It’s an idea that wages are kept low to make individuals slaves to their job. 
*Want to leave? I’ll fuck with your schedule to make it impossible to schedule an interview. 
*want to quit? You can’t live any longer than pay day without not eating. 
*want to take off sick? I’ll replace you. 
This happens everywhere. 
When I do a contract, the contracting company bills double what I make. While I may get upwards of $125 an hour, there is still another $125 taken for the company. I understand it isn’t the same as working for $14 an hour at Hardies or $7.25 an hour at long John silvers. The principle is the same, the company keeps the majority of the profit generated from your labor. Most McDonald’s make upwards of 30,000 during lunch. Workers don’t get performance bonuses when it’s slammed vs working at 2am Taco Bell runs. 

In the end we are all slaves, to the almighty dollar. Blessed art the jpow.

Well, do the math.

TQQQ was 21 5 years ago.

QQQ was 110 5 years ago.

Today TQQQ is 151 and QQQ is 295.

So if it is really just 3x we should be able to take the beginning and ending balances between the points and get the resulting difference.

QQQ 295 - 110 = 185. So our expected value for a 3x would be 555.

TQQQ is 151 - 21 = 130. So our expected value is 425 ***short***.

I don't think this works the way you think it does. It is not linear.
The hardest thing would be realising when that actually occurs - we are so used to consistent gains with short dumps that by the time everyone realised shit was flat most would have blown up their accounts (at least the day traders).

Storys probably fake
Fun fact I learned in the ER: a clean fracture isn’t as bad (or painful) as the most serious sprain. A sprain can mean that you’ve torn ligaments, and can take way longer to heal, if ever healing right again at all. If you did this running, and not having someone fall on you or bend things in ways that would snap them, you may be able to get away with: elevating, put a wrap on it to compress and immobilize, ice it and take responsible amounts of anti inflammatory. And yo: it can take weeks to heal right. NFL players get benched for months because of this. Getting a boot for it and crutches if it’s bad and healing in a couple months is better than destroying your ankle by trying to “get over it”

Above all: DO NOT try to put pressure on it by walking, or “rub dirt on it”. Do some research on google how your ankle works. Take it seriously and it may recover fast. Sprains are cumulative and the weakened area will be more likely to be damaged again easily. If it’s serious you will have to get a MRI on it to determine what’s ripped or torn. If they’ve torn off completely, it could be either surgery, and months in a boot, or months in a boot without surgery. 

Not be be scaring ya: but sprains can be athletic-career-ending serious, and don’t let some idiot at whatever training you’re doing convince you otherwise, it’s not their leg that will be walking with a limp when they are 60 if not treated correctly, it’s yours.

Can you edit your comment into something I can use as confirmation bias
Why is that?
I second this.  If OP isn't a medical expert then calling it a sprain is a guess at best.  It could also be either a strain or fracture.  I'd advise seeking medical treatment where they can properly diagnose the injury through imaging of the area.  

My friend was a marathon runner and thought his foot pain was caused from overtraining so he wrapped it up in runners tape and fought through the pain.  After the pain didn't subside for several weeks he went to his physician and was diagnosed with a hairline fracture.  Long story short if he went to the doctor earlier he wouldn't have had to do as much PT after it healed as he wouldn't have had to compensate with the rest of his body which misaligned the rest of his body.

Edit: I'm not an MD and this is not the right sub to be asking for medical advice.

Dude, everyone thinka canadians and Australians are nice and friendly. They for the most part are, but the big wigs in those countries are shady as fuck. Its hard for most people to understand but public shaming and litigation of ceos does not work there. They are oldschool, like 1800s union buster fat cat old school. Like i said before, its hard for most people that havent experienced it to grasp. Ive experienced it first hand, the fraud and security exchanges there have zero legs there.

The books are cooked worse then chinese tech companies.

this
In a world of fiat currency, MM algos, two decades of low inflation incentivizing overprinting, the potential for major government spending on infrastructure, two huge industries with massive amounts of unsatisfied demand and favorable public sentiment about to experience government facilitated growth, weakening economic dependence on the Middle East, and the distinct possibility of at least a moderate amount of wealth distribution translating into wage growth and catapulting aggregate demand? Not much. 

TBH the only thing that could do it would be a broad collapse of productivity and/or catastrophic currency destabilization. Catastrophic currency destabilization is on the horizon, because government around the world only rack up debt. That could be 10 years off, that could be a 100 years off, but when it happens, the stock market will likely be the least of your worries.

I do just wanna say that that last part isn’t just my take. This was the sentiment of multiple professors I had while taking Econ grad classes for my masters degree at the Andrew Young School of Policy last year.

Thanks for your tip on NIO, it encouraged me to get in. What do you think about NIO going into earnings 11/17? I have some 11/20 39c and 44c that I had bought but I wonder if I should hold them to play NIO earnings. I am kind of new to this, but signs seem to indicate NIO will have solid growth plus with announcing new battery tech, I believe guidance will be good as well. Of course, I worry about Theta.

OK then my question is what will cause the stock market to actually crash? Not some 20 day V shape shit that we had in March but a long term downtrend that typically signifies a recession in the real economy.
Stock market performance in last few recessions dating back to 1900s have varied from being down only few pct points to double digits loses. Have to keep in mind if you take out tech stocks, stocks were down double digits from Feb highs before election euphoria.
 **RICE:**

* **Rest** your ankle by not walking on it. Limit weight bearing and use crutches if necessary. If there is no broken bone you are safe to put some weight on the leg. An ankle brace often helps control swelling and adds stability while the ligaments are healing.
* **Ice** it to keep down the swelling. Don't put ice directly on the skin (use a thin piece of cloth such as a pillowcase between the ice bag and the skin) and don't ice more than 20 minutes at a time to avoid frostbite.
* **Compression** can help control swelling as well as immobilize and support your injury.
* **Elevate** the foot by reclining and propping it up above the waist or heart as needed.

 Depending on how many ligaments are injured, your sprain will be classified as **Grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe)**. 

If you are experiencing that much pain, you may be a 2 or probably 3 and should see a doctor or Minute Clinic.

A government spending money they don't have, to artificially boost demand on goods that people don't need/want, is not in anyway a healthy economy. It allocates resources inefficiently and causes there to be distortions in the economy and prices.

I'm not some libertarian or staunch capitalist, I'm actually quite socialist, but by being so I need to accept that the government programs I would be in support of do NOT necessarily lead to the largest most efficient economy, the hope is the drags on the economy are more than offset by people, everyone, getting to live decent lives even if they can't be as productive as others or as productive as their way of life may allude to them being.
You sure it's not broken? If not just take your time with it. I've seriously sprained my ankles a couple times as well. It hurts like a mother fucker. Can take awhile to start feeling better but eventually does. Like the other user said, rest, ice, & elevation helps it recover as quick as possible.
But Thurs. where's it end up is the question.

That's cause they make their money off interest from the idle cash on your account.
I'm not. I've met highly intelligent people who have a very narrowed focus, because they only seek out information that confirms their worldview.

Being forced to take sociology, psychology, public health, and organizational behavior taught me that I don't fundamentally think similarly to the majority of people, which helped me realize that I need to consider the mindset and perspective of the average person when it comes to trying to understand social movements, perspectives, etc.

I also believe that the more refined and focused your education is, the narrower your worldview becomes. This is amplified once you leave education and choose a career path.

I'm most afraid of my pathway becoming set in stone.
Well yeah, but I also think Biden will lose too in 2024

Oddly, inflation narrative has been dying and deflation has become a possibility.

That was highlighted by IMF very recently. We print but we struggle to stimulate demand, and money supply (or velocity, I don't recall which one is it) is ironically shrinking.

Should had bought more when it dropped to 108, then sold that when it was 118, to lower your cost basis, now you are just looking for 125 to break even
Dope. I truly hope so. I'm just looking at the numbers.
Yeah. The second the stock goes back down a bit IV is gonna collapse by 15%-20% and they'll be in an even worse place. Problem with buying options after a pump isn't "will the stock go up" it's "will IV stay the same or go higher?"

Heads up: depending on her job, you using this (or any provision of her job’s umbrella for service) for personal gain could be a proxy FINRA violation, depending on the services she provides to others. Be careful. They’re not messing around.

I think we are entitled to jobs at the big firms giving stock rating/price predictions - we can't be any worse. All we do is when it starts going up we release a new target price between 10-50% above it. When it starts dumping we change our prediction and go the other way - can't lose because 99% of the time we are wrong anyway and we still somehow manage to convince people our job is useful and required.

Calls for 21MAY21 so I’ll be diamond handing
I was planning on listening to them on a refrigerator sized radio
* Contested election with 🥭 not backing down
* Covid cases exploding with hospitalizations and deaths trending up
* Stonks overbought post-election with one of the biggest weekly moves in history 
* All signs point to dump incoming

Therefore, buy calls.
Cheers to everyone who bought PLTR over the last couple weeks.  $20 here we come.  Made enough to cover this semesters tuition.
Definitely... the market is manipulated and we are definitely not in on the secret. Some rich cunts and their gay algos had enough money behind them to pump into stocks/ETFs and when they want it to dump they will do it when everyone doesn't expect it because they can. There is literally no logic to why it goes up or down each day - all we know is that in general over a long time period it generally goes up - how much we have no fucking idea or why.
Great recovery and fuck you

Can’t wait to buy the dip after earnings run and dump.
Most successful trades that aren't just 1/100 retard luck eg dumping 100k on 0DTE SPY options seem to involve going hard at single stocks and getting the timing correct. Either its cunts with 200k dumping it into straight NIO stocks or TSLA stocks when it was half what it is now or luck like GME, PRPL etc options. It's hard to predict something that follows 0 logic - you have a better chance of predicting what the next gay tik tok trend will be.

Does anyone believe that Biden, a candidate who had a tough time filing a room, got 8.89 million more votes than Obama 2012?
Ossoff and Warnwhatever are gonna get smoked, and I'm a Democrat who wishes they wouldn't. I've looked at the numbers and my friends are data journalists. The races are deceptively close only because the field is packed, and RNC ground game will be motivated and out. Warnewharever doesn't stand a change (had 30% vote, the other two Republicans had 30% each, do the math), and Ossoff will slowly bleed. 

No tech sell-off. Remember this is the same president who presided over bailing banks out and preventing prosecution for any of them. He's gonna stay the course and focus on infrastructure and economy building. Punishing the S&P's largest contributors doesn't help his constituents retirement portfolios. And he doesn't care.

TRUMP: SAYS LAWYERS PRESS CONFERENCE IN PHILADELPHIA AT 11:00AM
I laugh at this thread a lot. This one tho. Nice dude.
Honestly expect Biden to wait until a Trump win is statistically impossible (Biden lead > votes left, in all states where that’s not the case) to facilitate his “count every vote” message. Unless they’re trying to mobilize as many people as possible for donations to meet Trump in court, waiting is the smartest move for his optics to the moderate tbh.
Pajama traders will be the only ones to benefit from this.
You lost buying calls?  What whiffed?
I wouldn't because as soon as I buy the calls it would drop to 2 and elon would go on twitter to yell at me personally
This is 100% the case after they and AP called Arizona.
It’s funny though right?  The market is full on inverse.  Poor economy = money expansion and asset inflation.  Recovering economy = inflation control and shrinking assets.  

This shit is literally backwards now because the fed bails everyone out.  The debt bubble will never pop, you just won’t be able to afford groceries unless your money is growing in assets with the printing.
Is that Andrew Yang behind him?
Holding PLTR in hopes that their earnings cause a jump... I’ll cry if it plummets down.
this is basically treason now isn't it
This is the first time I've felt like this, but: good, fuck that mother fucker, he's a complete piece of fucking shit.

When the Dems lost they blamed foreign influence on the election.

When the Republicans lost they blamed american democracy and american values. They started disenfranchising voters who legally cast their votes.

i think apple 130 might happen suddenly(again) in the next month if bullish trends continue and the event is good
Square has reported 3 Bil revenue on ER vs 2 Bil as expected. I can see this run up to 230 end of week or the next one. Thoughts?
PA seems to be trucking along despite all the attempts at legal bullshittery.  Once it becomes a statistic impossibility for Trump to come back, there'll be no reason not to call it regardless of what is going on elsewhere.  Edit:  PA just added 15.5k to the number of ballots remaining, pushing it up to 100k.  That will just help widen the gap in Biden's favor.

GA probably already is a statistic impossibility for a Trump victory but the 'ballots remaining' went off the rails about 12 hours ago.  Nobody seems to know how many more votes will be coming in from there.  The votes that are coming in though keep pushing it further in Biden's favor.
Thank you. :)
Theta decay on weeklies is a bitch. Would not have bought weeklies on a Friday after a stock pumped.

Still not as easy as now when you can do that with one usb stick pressing next next next and just download all the drivers from internet with one app vs when you would have to make a second trip after finding out the guy lost his driver cd(not old enough for floppy disks so not sure about those) or windows serial key. Not so long ago it was really too much for a person to handle if they didnt spend some time looking how to. Nowadays its just out of habbit i guess since its really easy.

how is this funny?
I have leaps on docu and spy and wrote calls against them cause the premium was so damn high and I covered my cost in them.  pltr I do own the shares at $10. Pennies vs what could have been.  I’m going to roll out the calls on spy and docu for a small credit and see if the stock comes back any time soon.  Pltr I’m out after this Friday at $11 if it is called away.  

Edit... also on Monday I sold UBER calls at 38.50.  This is getting sad
So should i buy stonks to make money or optioms for the emotional rollercoaster

Why not both?
I fucked up. I bought calls before ER and was up and held until ER and have been bag holding since. Hoping it pops.
Just my guess from timing RKT right a number of times would be run up then probably back down. I always look at their chart and play weeklies. I’m hoping for $26-$27 next week. I believe

I think education is important because it forces you to become exposed to perspectives and information that you wouldn't seek out on your own.

If you give most people all the information that existed, I believe they would specifically seek out things that confirm their biases inherently, or perspectives that they already share.

I bought LEAPS
I will not be censored! Admins are F@GGOTS
It's because it's treated as the norm in America. Most have a vague idea and it's understood that you will go to college and "figure it out". Most obviously don't. In my opinion, it takes a lot more wherewithal and persepctive to make the the decision to not go to college at 18 for a truly guided reason than it does to just go because that's what you do. Basically you're saying "How can someone at 18 make such a rushed, immature, and financially irresponsible decision?" But that's exactly what you would do at 18, especially if you don't know what to do

Plus idk if you took a break but getting back into the swing of school after one is a bitch
Not true bc we would have to wait for Trump to be resurrected for CNN to call the election
Expectations are so low that I wouldn’t be surprised if Nikola jumped on even the slightest good news. Like, ‘there’s a possibility we will close that GM deal sometime in the next year’ = 50% spike.
This is WSB in a nutshell: referring to selling covered calls as a “free money glitch”. Selling covered calls is not without risk. NIO could be the next LK and he could lose money on the shares. Your example is also misleading. It’s not as simple as saying his short call contracts are exercised if NIO reaches $45 by Friday. Before expiration, NIO could hit $50 without his shares being called away. If his contracts lose enough extrinsic value (ITM with little time left) his shares could be called away early. Otherwise the contracts would have to be ITM at expiration for his shares to be called away.

He’s reducing his cost basis for the shares he owns with the chance of those shares being called away at the short calls’ strike.
Try “yourfired”, you think he knows proper grammar?
Yeah

Let's go back to a time when presidents could read!
Dare not oppose the dear leader
I'm not really referring to the vote count with regard to the election.  I just mean whether Trump has broad support within only the military vote in case they decide they want to go full in on trying to overturn the election and start some real shit.  I think if the GOP thought they could do it without repercussions they would.  There is certainly an element within the GOP that would.
CNN would explode from the inside if this played on their network. The reporter's heads would literally pop with frustration.

It was always going to be a legal battle situation. It’s why he pushed for his voters to go to the polls to he could focus their legal strategy on mail fraud and in turn have the biggest benefit for going after mail fraud. Legal challenge are very common and. Like trump he’s just making a show and spectacle out of it.

What I don’t get, are people I know who went to College not knowing what they wanted to do, went after something obscure degree wise as it was a temporary “passion”, got 100k in debt, often never finished the degree, etc. 

I mean, why the heck go to school for that stuff. Libraries are free, and you can just buy a hunk of clay to sculpt off Amazon. Hell you could travel around the world and learn “fiber weaving” or whatever from the indigenous tribes they were teaching you about, in person for wayyyyy less than $100k...

Options are striaght up gambling because can't really wait for confirmation due to theta and expiry.  I've only ever traded a handful of options all wins, but I know the risk.  I'm current in a NIO leap with low theta expiry end of next yr.  Stocks should be way easier as long as you follow price action and don't try to forecast anything like so many terrible strategies teach (fibonacci, wave analysis, fundamentals,  etc).

It was an off the cuff joking comment Buydip made on a African American produced podcast/video interview, discussing his history vs the other party and benefits to people of color. But it was pretty boldly stated and either made people laugh at its obviousness or made others clutch their pearls over it verging on being presumptive and not PC. 

The Internet being the Internet it’s now become a meme.
Didn't some get counted already and it was still Biden leaning?
The only ones that actually benefit from the division are the politicians and media. We only get to vote every four years yet our lives have been consumed by something we have very limited influence over. We’ve been bamboozled 🤡

I don't know if enough people are taking the depths of depravity within the GOP seriously enough right now.  Right now half are parroting right along with him and the other half are mostly quiet.

Some early morning DD here.

Pfizer COVID vaccine will be available for use on DoD members in the next 1-2 weeks.

Note: This will be prior to FDA approval and members will be allowed to opt out...but this will be large scale administration, not testing. Hospitals and clinics that have -70°C storage capes will recieve the vaccine.
Yes third party candidates have existed and held seats in the senate. However due to the winner take all approach of voting overtime has caused the country to become a two party system over time. Additionally Trump will leave office. It’s a fairly basic legal strategy that trump is setting up and playing.  Sure the way he’s doing it is childish but really there is no reason for him to just leave office at this point. Due to the closeness of votes in states he will be able to request a recount. Which he will request as that’s the smart political action to take. His entire strategy always relies on splitting the vote into Republican in person and Democrats by mail. They would then try legally challenge any mail vote issues that they could. Obviously because if they did and those votes were thrown out it would statistically speaking benefit him. Honestly this is really not a surprise to anyone who follows political strategy. Taking legal action on places where you can get the vote bent in your favor is fairly common. The only difference to all of this is Trump has brought a show to this to rally his base to fire up support to fight within the courts and to so doubt in order to bring pressure to any cases that he files. This is how the man is and how he operates their is seriously not a single surprise here. He knows he’s lost the race and knew before it even started it would  come down to a legal challenge. Both parties have vast resources of legal to go and fight anywhere and wherever they perceive a vote advantage can be obtained through the courts. You need to get off the news platforms that play and love this sensationalism as they know and play the sensationalism game also. It’s why presidential debates are not debates. They are just each person trying to get a soundbite clip in. Go listen to Kennedy and Nixon debate you will be shocked.

Actually making 10% profit money off day trading both weeklies calls and puts on DKNG in the last couple weeks was stressful as hell, and no damn fun. I’m bullish long on them, but recent earnings behavior (AMD, I’m looking at you) has me very very cautious. Probably sit out until after earnings waiting on earnings players to dump their positions and then buy in.

The real secret is long term options. Weekly options are hard. I almost always sell 10x gains early at 1-2x. Buy leaps on tech stocks that are trending up like roku, sq, shop (if you are rich options are pricey), twlo, Fiverr, Pton etc. wait for dips to buy. 

Fsly could be a good candidate for a long term buy now. Also Draft kings. I bought some upwk 30 calls this week too but I’m just chasing that one.

On Thursday I saw a lot of volume for the $9 strike expiring on the 13th for tilray that person may have sold yesterday I didn't look how much those strikes were up so a lot of people got out with profit yesterday  which caused the fade into close so if it's a true pump then I believe it will continue on Monday but they do have earnings so be careful I may buy in after earnings again medicinal use is down because of corona virus nobody wants to go to the doctor but recreational use is up and that is Canada and the US's biggest market I believe

I miss Dave.
I’ve never seen a more retarded portfolio. 20 open options positions and strictly calls/puts? And how many stocks? How do you even expect to manage that on Robinhood? Yikes dawg. Never have that many positions unless you have a lot of spreads. Also, the market generally goes up and down together. It’s good to hedge, but having half calls and half puts is pretty retarded
What the fuck do you want from this small gains post? Do you want a, "adda boy", "I'm so proud of you son", "I know you could do it"... Where the fuck is your dead beat dad?
People here rag on premarket, but with both those stocks premarket seemed to be that it was bigger money positioning itself into where it knew it would go. 

However my regret of not going all in on 290c weeklies of BABA when it dumped to 280 Thursday and holding ... I even was posting on here it would hit 300... is a conservative mistake. I still made a lot of upside, but only 1/5 th what it would habe, if I had held on my own predictions.
Weekend are awesome for that I'll agree, it helps me get through my work week since I do grocery and have Tuesday and Wednesday off. I love my weekend during the trading week. Kinda feel for everyone that does the Monday to Friday in a sense.
Correct. I’m just hoping it doesn’t tank Monday morning before I sell. I’m fine with the current profit. Here’s hoping.

Not a comment to promote either candidate, but is anyone else just amazed at how equally split this country is?

The towns are all nice and beautiful, but the income is usually like 3 times smaller than the western bros, and the more east you go and the Soviet arhitecture starts kicking in, the more it aligns with the truth, basically being a bit better than a dumpster fire.

Probably lost about 50k-75k gambling over my lifetime, but got 250k saved so I feel a bit less bad. But still bad.

Good to know. I used to work for Bite Squad but haven’t kept up with them much. Looks like some easy $$ to be made. Thanks!
They continue to expand to new stores.  COVID seems to have good for them in that more people cook at home.  Should be a positive report. Hoping it will push shares back into the mid-20's like it was a few weeks ago.

You made a great call. I also got in on PLTR early after IPO

People on here sleeping and downvoting and hating but we got the last laugh so far.

PLTR is not done rallying yet.

$14 a share is still low for their model and market cap 

They're revolutionizing how world governments utilize big data concisely.
Took a few grand in weed profit and got in on RKT in the red at around 10am Friday.

Your weak hands is another mans opportunity you cuck.  I bought in at $6 calls for pennies bro. FREE MONEY!  Made over 20k and that was selling an hour after market open. Could have been 40k, and Im still kicking myself for selling to early.  I feel what you feel but with 20k in my pocket.

I've no clue how far back the idiocy predates, I've only been trading semi-actively since about the time BYND went public and finished week 2 with a 10B market capitalization (Spoilers, it wasn't worth 1/10th of that). Ever since we've witnessed space travel agencies with no space ships and electric vehicle companies with no vehicles moon within minutes of some fancy PowerPoint presentation so I've adapted to not rely on fundamentals (Or common sense for that matter). Before that I was a buy and hold type of person... simpler times...

I don’t believe the market did well under Carter but did well under others before him. The point I’m really making is that there is probably an equal track record there or maybe one that slightly favors the other but nothing significant.
Just wrapped up 2 years at my current company and got a new job. 401k went from 0 - 45k, much better gains than my options portfolio.. Love 401ks and Roths because it locks my money up and I can't touch that shit and blow it, as I'm extremely good at losing money.
Ohhh look at this normie with 23 pairs of chromies
If you stick around here long enough then one day you will also know the non-feeling of losing $10k in a day. It’s just so surreal and doesn’t feel real. It’s ok though, don’t be a paper hand pussy and you’ll probably be ok.

Yeah I have no clue what I’m talking about I’m new to all this and I’ve been wondering if the market was always this dumb and based purely on psychology it seems too easy. My first stock I messed with happened to be 5000 organigram at $1.05 I was legit laughing when I saw it actually moved because it was a terrible choice and I still won.
If I knew the price now of $AAPL on 11/13 4pm, then I could trade on that information accordingly.
When did they add the roulette option?
Yes, lost like 3000 dollars for being a pussy but its ok, with Biden winning all my stocks are gonna be in the green next week

naw i know what i’m doin. my 38c is for 2/19 (not holding out that long) but i feel like we definitely see 44 before we see a huge correction like 32. if anything it was cheaper to buy back the call. so instead of only being up like 40 bucks on the whole spread i immediately was up more as soon as it went back to 41. if expiry was in november-december i wouldn’t have closed the short

I believe dems need both GA seats to tie and make Kamala the tie breaker.

While Purdue is vulnerable (but likely to win, as both incumbent and vote leader in this election), Loefler had multiple republicans in the race with her. She’s a fucking nut, but consolidation should make her runoff path to victory considerably easier.

Dont let these coders fool you. Its straight up cut throat in coding. I've been a banking professional for 16 years and we continually hire ex coders because they dont get consistent work, just gig jobs, and even then its mindless shit  for most of the time. I'm talking people who make 50k a year for a year then get laid off cuz their project is finished. That's a shitty way to live, hopping around in such a 'secure' field. 

Not to mention, a robot CAN and WILL replace half of the coding that people do at this time. Once that happens, good luck.

I'm just tired of hearing this learn to code shit. It's not what these senior coders making $230,490,983.88 claim it is MOST of the time.

This is a cliche but I swear its true- learn a trade. I kid you not. ALL of my buddies who are in trades are always busy as fck and paid 6 figures easily. They have such job security that they will literally show up to a job, say eh fck this, too much work, and then leave for another job. I'm serious. And they cannot be replaced by a robot.

Canada taxes on capital gains are actually amazing

Let's say I earn no money

Let's say I make 100k this year

I'm only taxed on 50k

I think tax bracket for 50k is around 10%

So only 5k paid in taxes for 100k gains

If you work at the right company, that’s not a bad strategy. I’m lucky to work at a big fast growing company that treats its workers well. I revealed my power level, and they appreciated it. Honestly, risky move on my part. But now I’m getting promoted. They approached me, actually.

It’s more stressful. I work twice as hard as I probably need to. But I’m looking at future salary bumps where I maybe only have to work half as long to retire. Honestly not entirely sure if it’s worth it. Probably suits my personality though.

Totally sell covered calls on this. Find a strike yo ur comfortable selling at and selling covered calls. 2 weeks out. If they don’t sell? Free money. If they do sell? You made premium and sold the shares you were gonna sell anyway.
Did GME guy do that good? I missed out and can't remember.
$NIO May 21 calls. 

$35 strike = $14.75.
$45 strike = $10.83. 

That $10 difference only costs $3.92. Convince me why $45 strike would be the better choice.

Unless, come Monday, you get a nice shiny democratic POTUS that promised to make weed legal on a federal level and you get another steroid injection (purely speculative of course) and make the big bucks before the rug pull.

You’re fucked. Most weed companies are struggling and can’t get rid of their inventory. ACB was one of the worst performers. These stocks rose purely on retarded sentiment. No guarantee whatsoever weed is legal on a federal level anytime soon. There’s a myriad of issues with permits and sales laws across state lines. Get the fuck out of cannabis stocks ASAP.
Of course they can! The fact that the Dems lost house seats is the best evidence against cheating but the 🥭🤡s don’t follow logic

You know what?  I ran a side by side of the 60/40 you proposed, the straight 1x SPY, and a third portfolio containing just the 3x SP 500, and the straight 3x was the best since 2009.  So maybe I'm wrong.  I was told that the long term potential of leveraged ETFs are terrible and the SEC even puts out a warning to investors about it, but it looks like it can work.  I would personally use a different tactic to get 3x or more, but that's me.

Edit:  You do make some good points though.

I made a bunch this week on various weed stonks but got out of all positions except APHA. It sucked a giant cock end of day.

I'm conflicted. On one hand we will probably get an election call by Monday which could be the final catalyst to pump them once more, but the earnings of ACB and CGC could pull them all back down if they suck.

CRON beat though, so who knows.

I've got about 3k worth of APHA 6C and it did well after hours Friday.

Premarket almost got to $7. I noticed it pumped around when WI, MI declared for Biden. It sold off at open and i was able to enter ~$5. Figured he would win more states which would push cannabis up plus ER on Monday. Obviously very degen but not a random play with no thought to it

If you are selling puts you want them to go down in value.  You collect the premium up front so if the value goes to 0 you still profit.

Shut up, Gym
The real question is when can I come from ny to nj to buy some weed
I use 10mg and have a cup of milk every night. You don't gain tolerance and I only sleep like 6 or 7 hours a day thanks to melatonin. I take them between 8:40pm and 9:30 pm depending on when I want to sleep.

Don't buy the Costco 3mg, it's crap
I agree. It’s like welfare, there is abuse but it’s the price we pay to help people that are legit fucked get back on track. That means some fuckers use it as a lifestyle. I am ok with that. Live it up on purple drink and cockroaches. Dave who broke his leg lost his job and paid for his mom’s cancer treatment has a roof.
That's kinda the reason I laugh at people telling 20-year olds with like 5k to invest to "buy a bunch of etfs and forget".

If your ETF goes for 10% a year (which is already generous)  and you don't touch that money for 10 years your account will be worth 13k.

So you made 8k dollars in 10 years.

If you have small sums it's better to try and invest into some speculative stocks for example. At worst you lose what? 5k? At best you might hit something like TSLA/NIO or something that grows like AMZN/NFLX and your 5k could be worth 50k in 10 years.

Unless you have big accounts (100k+) I actually encourage people to take higher risks for a higher reward. Not dropping 30k in SPY weeklies, but actually buying speculative stocks or leaps on good companies.
Lol no mandate, since when having a mandate is important?
diabolical, I love it.
I feel this in my soul.  


I lost 10 grand on puts back in March.  
I've regained that thanks to $Nio, up 230%.
Anything else you recommend?
Latest update is that Biden had a lead in the vote counts for Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada. So if Biden wins would it be strong enough to offset their potentially gay profits for this quarter and make it go to the fucking moon or am I just a gay smooth brain

Melatonin helps but it’s way harder to get up in the morning and you also gain a tolerance to it after a while
“So anyway I started blastin’”
Yeah, so sometimes a 3x absolutely can outperform a 1x.  However, the example you gave was near best case scenario.  The 3x does best when it's steady growth day after day.  It gets destroyed though when the waters get choppy.  Also, the example you gave couldn't include the 2000 bubble crash because those ETFs didn't exist then, so it only went back to 2011.  When a major crash happens, an index might lose 50% of it's value with very few green days, so your 3x will become worth virtually nothing at the end.
Hopefully GME and NIO pay for my Series X

There is no "best day". Monday, for example, has had a few significant drops, but on a day-for-day basis far more green Mondays then red. Best not to try and time it that way.

I went with the ForeRunner 245. I’d never run before Lockdown 1.0 in March (UK) and I bought that to convince me to go and do some exercise. 

Hands down been my best purchase, I don’t need to take my phone out for runs anymore and it streams music straight to my Bluetooth headphones from downloaded Spotify playlists that it stores on the watch itself, something the Apple Watch still can’t do. It also delivers all notifications from my phone to my wrist but I can’t reply to any of them. I wasn’t too fussed about the notification capabilities personally but I can say that they have been useful on occasion. The battery life also easily lasts me a week of normal use including at least 1-2 30min runs streaming music and using gps. I think it really is the perfect bridge between lacklustre fitness trackers (Fitbits) and full blown smart watches (Android/Apple watches)

That being said, Garmin have a massive range to suit many needs so you’re best off just looking through their catalogue. Their vivoactive and Venu series lean more towards smart watches while the Forerunner series leans more towards the fitness side. I know some of the vivoactive and Venu watches also have Garmin Pay which allow you to pay via your watch like a normal smartwatch. You’d have to upgrade a bit higher on the ForeRunner series to get that feature.
Project Veritas? 

Far right media has discredited themselves with shit like pizzagate and Qanon. That’s why no one is taking shit like this seriously. Even if they’re right, they’ve ruined their reputation too much to make any ground.

I'm still new. But I picked like 2 stocks and I watch them constantly. After a while you just get familiar w the chart. You start to notice small patterns etc.  Then you can better discern entry and exit points. You just have to be patient. If you wake up every day looking for that money maker, you're going to have a bad time. 

I've been playing w like 5k for almost a year now. Its money I don't need. And I use it to try out trades and make mistakes. You slowly just start to pick little things up. I definately have no idea what I'm doing but I'm better than I was 1 yr ago lol.

I've noticed a pretty significant price drop again at the local stores

Also reflected in Aphrias earnings a few weeks ago

I would expect the same for everyone else, even if they sold more pot, probably didn't increase revs or make any more money.

However, I think with market sentiment right now, that if the weed stocks don't crash on earnings like they have the last 2 or 3 times, that they're going to go on a 2018 sized bull run. For them not to crash shows that there is something else juicing them, not just the regular pre-anticipatory run traders (which I guess is obviously the case with 500MM shares traded)

The new market is a straight up bubble dude.  Boomers, Zoomers, Millennials, they're all throwing money at it like it's 2000.  Just find a meme stock(I think Palantir is this week's) and ride it to the top.  A lot of them get IV crushed so if you're playing options, then run spreads so you can offset the premium and manage your risk.  Watch your money like a fucking hawk every day it's in play.  If you've been around for a bit, you know how this ends.  When the time comes, ditch it with market orders and leave the kids/amnesiacs holding the bags.  Good luck dude.

Good one, fuck you, my friend.
Agree on the virus part but not much reason to assume markets care about election lawsuits or potential protests. Definitely agree that this week’s rally at least in the initial stages had a lot to do with the senate. When it looked like trump was doing much better than expected Nasdaq futures jumped 400 points, which likely predicted a republican senate.

Overall I think market is headed towards a cliff but your positioning is aggressive only going out a week. Although wouldn’t this week look like a vicious bull trap if we did start selling off? The euphoria and enthusiasm for stocks like pton, pltr, cloud stocks, etc. among people I follow who are “growth investors” was palpable today. Seems consistent with what you’d expect to see near a top.

My thinking is COVID is going to dominate the news again starting as early as next week as cases continue to go parabolic and a market that’s base case is a vaccine is coming seems setup for a big fall given where valuations and speculation are. The tech trade is just enormously crowded and under the surface the largest companies seem to be unable to retake their August/September highs and even a small selloff could derail the market IMO. As for this week’s monstrous rally, it’s not inconsistent at all with what you would see in the early stages of a bear market and is actually a potential sign of an unhealthy market. I remain convinced we are at a top. Another potential contrarian indicator I’m looking at is the vix. Seem to be a LOT of traders convinced volatility is headed lower into the end of the year. Seems a bit too easy.

Reposted many times.
While I understand the sentiment, Trump lost his support because lots of Bush/Reagan Rs stayed home or lodged protest votes for Biden. While it’s shocking that 70 million people voted for a maniacal, asshole narcissist, it would have been even more if he didn’t lose the moderates.

Dollar down and still no inflation. Fed is McFooked.
Imagine thinking that the VIX will always pop on a down move
Since you really seem to be asking let me explain it to you.  It's called mean averaging.  So these things go up or down 3x the daily percentage of their respective markets.  To make this example simple, I'll use a made up group of two ETFs.  They both start at $100 and I get the 1x one and you get the 3x one.  Okay, first day the maket goes up 10%.  So mine goes up the same and is at $110, but yours goes up 30% and is at $130.  You're doing great guy, hang in there!  Day two, market goes down 8%, so I'm down to $101.20 since 8% of $110 is $8.80.  You drop 24% down to $98.80 since 24% of $130 is $31.20.  You see the problem?  The market is up $1.20, and I'm up $1.20, but even though you're getting 3x daily, you're actually down $1.20.  This is why if you measure the long term growth of leveraged ETFs, they absolutely suck compared to 1x ones like SPY or QQQ.  Hope this helps, and good luck.
Lol no. Bernie lost big time vs Biden, so that disproves your theory pretty hard.
Doesn't matter, you can't change the past. Look forward, don't fuck up again.

This is literally what they say right before a massive crash. Government buying MBS so real estate values don’t tank and kill the already struggling mortgage industry. Malls and homes for losing left and right, inflation going nuts, and unemployment still higher than in 2008. Gold prices skyrocketing and value of dollar going down. Virus cases sky high and going exponentially higher. Consumer fear index is like three times higher than it was before 2008.

The policy of the last 50 years has been "strategic ambiguity" whereby so long as neither of the three players makes a significant move then Taipei remains defacto independent.
  
Trump pressuring China over Taiwan and being increasingly pro-independence breaks the strategic ambiguity and guarantees a conflict which would be an almost certain loss for the us (at this point) alongside devastation of the island and frankly the total loss of global semiconductor manufacturing for a decade

It’s time a new type of investor arises;  one that is wealthy, affluent, knowledgeable and powerful. We need to take back what was stolen from us. Our dignity and our pride. We are not merely degenerates, this isn’t a place for losers. We are victorious for participating in the grandest market to have ever existed. Hold your head up high, and don’t look down on yourselves.

Must be Americans, they rent houses at 20k per month because they want to brag to their friends and live in the big city with all the lights and noise and pubs.   
You can live in the south of belgium with less than 5k a YEAR if you own your own house. Just plant your veggies in the garden, get a chicken for eggs, go to local farmer for your cheese and milk and to the butcher for good pig's meat.  
Americans are spoilt little brats, they NEED to spend millions just to feel alive.
Softbank news was typical financial MSM looking for a narrative

The one thing Tump got right on China is the threat they pose with technology.  A lot of people don't seem to realize that the first country to invent an A.I with the intelligence of at least a human, will instantly possess a weapon more powerful than every nuke in the U.S. combined.  China is arguably best placed to deliver on it.  They have the richest vein of the necessary resource, humans.  Specifically humans who can be mined for data without their permission.
The September crash was a sell off due to SoftBank mainly. In June there wasn’t much of a correction

I watched a murder mystery drama on IQiyi called "The long night" (free btw) and it was surprising what IQiyi can pull off in these shows with all the censors China has. Like there was even a rape scene lol. There's another popular IQ mystery drama called "The bad kids" which apparently won best asian drama award for this year. Anyhow, from what I know this company is legit thee Chinese Netflix, they don't just make your typical asian sissy drama that your mama likes to watch.

Kinda racist. I can understand people agreeing with him, because they "think like him". When someone robs a bank you don't say "Well... he only robbed one bank". Trump is, has been (publicly), and always will be a racist. No ambiguity at all.
It's unethical. 

That said, the way you phrased this (see it on the market) implies it has been listed, ie the seller has broker representation at that point - you'd just be the buyer.

First hand witness to politicians working an average of 130 days a year for $175,000 a year plus retarded benefits. First hand witness to state employees "working" from home for 50 hours paid a week while actually working 10 at most. First hand witness to budgets getting blown to reduce risk of losing the following budget. Fuck off with your first hand witness to "regular people" getting paid. 

There are 2,200 subsidies and benefit programs that are controlled by the federal government. It is impossible for these 2,200 programs to be subject to bankruptcy, failure or takeovers. Basically, there are 2,200 businesses ran by the federal government that have ZERO built in systems to identify, address or eliminate failed ventures.

There is no bottom line pressures to mitigate low priority, wasteful, or failing policies like those that naturally set bars in the private sector.

If a project has a cost overrun, the controlling members of congress will not be worried because an overrun means more spending on their constituents.

Nearly all government workers are rewarded for longevity and nothing else. Don't get fired and you'll get raises forever.

>Buried in the Department of the Treasury's 2003 Financial Report of the United States Government is a short section titled "Unreconciled Transactions Affecting the Change in Net Position," which explains that these unreconciled transactions totaled $24.5 billion in 2003. 

[2. Unused Flight Tickets Totaling $100 Million](https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/top-10-examples-government-waste#_ftn2)

>A recent audit revealed that between 1997 and 2003, the Defense Department purchased and then left unused approximately 270,000 commercial airline tickets at a total cost of $100 million. Even worse, the Pentagon never bothered to get a refund for these fully refundable tickets. The GAO blamed a system that relied on department personnel to notify the travel office when purchased tickets went unused


[3. Embezzled Funds at the Department of Agriculture](https://www.heritage.org/budget-and-spending/report/top-10-examples-government-waste#_ftn2)

>A recent audit revealed that employees of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) diverted millions of dollars to personal purchases through their government-issued credit cards. Sampling 300 employees' purchases over six months, investigators estimated that 15 percent abused their government credit cards at a cost of $5.8 million. Taxpayer-funded purchases included Ozzy Osbourne concert tickets, tattoos, lingerie, bartender school tuition, car payments, and cash advances.

>The USDA has pledged a thorough investigation, but it will have a huge task: 55,000 USDA credit cards are in circulation, including 1,549 that are still held by people who no longer work at the USDA.

But please, tell me all about your first hand experience seeing Joe Plumber getting paid that justifies countless billions of not inefficiently spent funds, but completely fucking lost funds. 

You shouldn't express opinions you aren't motivated enough to research. Have them, by all means have as many stupid fucking opinions as you heart desires. Just, please, don't express them, spread them, talk about them, encourage them, teach them, basically don't do anything that may propagate your dumb as fuck opinions and allow them to grow or spread. 

Matter of fact, just get snipped. Let's nip any possibility of you procreating mini-retards in the bud.

My fucking man. Thank you for laying out where to start focusing in this ridiculous video game that we currently call the stock market.
This is a mess of spin of correlation as causation. Now ppl are trying to pretend that the markets are cheering a GOP senate.

Give it up. Everybody in the business world who wasn’t a partisan tard admits that Trump’s trade war and coronavirus bungling was destroying the economy and good businesses. I’ve been watching and reporting Biden bounces in stocks every time he pulled ahead for the past couple of weeks. The market was bouncing hard well before it became obvious what was going on in senate races. 

Just about everybody in business who isn’t a partisan tard wanted Trump gone. Biden got way more donations from Wall Street than Trump did. I don’t have to even link that Because Trump complained about that on national TV at a debate. 

There was an unprecedented amount of money flowing to downticket races to try to get rid of the GOP senate majority. Where do yiu think that money came from?

Edit: There’s big market downside due to coronavirus winter (and it’s not correlated as well with temperature as much as it’s correlated with solar input and latitude). But everything is going to do better now because soon we don’t have a president who is creating a massive, whole-industries-crippling trade war in the middle of a massive, whole-industries-crippling pandemic. The stock market will continue to normalize.

Stop buying VXX calls, wait until the VIX spikes up a ton, then short the nearest month VIX future (or long SVXY) with a profit taker -- and if you insist, a stop loss -- then chill.

Guaranteed™ tendos since its, you know, a mean-reverting index. Zoom out to practically any scale and you'll see what I mean. VXX was $118,000 per share in 2009, and now it's $20.50 lol.

VIX options don't work the way equity options do, a VIX spike often causes calls to drop in value because the VIX doesn't really climb, it tends to spike up and then drop off. Unless the spike crossed your strike price, the calls tend to go down because the volatility spike "is over now." Time also makes the calls go down. Mean reversion also makes the calls go down.

Being long volatility is just brutal.

tl;dr: Wait for spike. Short the next month VIX future (or long SVXY). Wait for tendos. Buy back the VIX future (or sell SVXY). Use proceeds at Tendy's.

Source: Up $24,000 shorting VIX spikes since May. Haven't lost a single trade yet, though I've certainly had to diamond hands my way through a couple.

That’s called sickness. When the fear of lost gains is greater than the fear of lost money, you’re fucked.

Every day there are opportunities to lose and gain money. That has been true since the market has existed. It will be true when you return from what may be a healthy hiatus.

Speaking from experience. Down ~17k first year on mostly options. Took a half year break. Came back with a clear head. ~5k off of getting back to even this year on almost exclusively stock. I don’t stress about getting up at market open, and I don’t go into a mini depression during the weekend because the market is closed. I look at my portfolio from time to time to see how my holdings are doing, and have no qualms about the short term movement that may happen. I keep track of what’s going on with my ~10 holdings, and consider periodically whether I should add to my positions. I have peace of mind.

It's funny how people are treating the Swedish Corona doctrine as the holy grail. 

Even though they have twice as many inhabitants compared to Norway, but over 20 times more death. However, Swe and Danmark has 8 times more and Swe compared to Finnland has about 15 times.

And these countries can be compared as they have similar cultures, social behaviour, sizes of cities, infrastructure etc.

Comparing a random country to a Scandinavian just dont make sense, becouse they are very different in most other aspects as mentioned above.

Finally their stockmarket also went to shit, as Swe is a export nation.

Well do you want to see the $40,000 in profit? And clearly your position should have made money.. probably nicely.

Who would think the market should rush up during this garbage of a time in the pandemic and industries that are actually affected like tourism..

But in any case why did you play SPY up and base. The top at 360? 

Is the 360 spy short leg hurting??
Imagine running off on the state media Russian propagandist scheme all these years later after learning the crack smoking Biden family received direct payments from Russia totaling in the millions of dollars... I guess you fell victim to the "fact check" rofl.. Sad day for America bro.. Trump did not take any money from anyone his only goal was to promote the freedoms of the constitution... What a disgrace not only to the office of the presidency but to every single American that rejects the idea our country is anything less than the greatest land on earth. Absolutely disgusting how the fake news media spread fake Russian propaganda because their democratic large scale foreign interests were at stake.. There was way too much foreign interest on the line to let an outsider for the people remain in power..  Top level democrats even say on twitter, "everyone knows what happening, half of us don't care"...  They can brag about it in plain sight because with the media backing them nothing else matters. Sad day for America.

I’ve been wondering this as well. I’m not a doomsayer (I don’t think) but Gottlieb is now saying in the next several weeks this is going to get out of hand and he’s been spot on throughout this so I trust him more than anyone. In January and February market kept going up even as he said it was coming here and going to be bad but market got its narrative from price (as always) and assumed this meant the virus was just another flu and at most a “one quarter story.” Then one day it reached a critical mass, reality set in and the market decided to care.

Certainly possible market really doesn’t care that much no matter what because of the Fed but it’s also true markets get this stuff wrong all the time in the short term so I do think December/January volatility could really pick up.

Lol, he decreased the trade deficit with China and he didn’t bring manufacturing or coal jobs back either. Not that anyone could have but it was pretty dumb to even promise.

I don’t even blame Trump, he’s not the sharpest knife but the people behind him, Bannon, Mercers etc. shouldn’t have appointed protectionists like Navarro who’s being laughed at at the universities he used to lecture. 

The only thing he did reasonably well is to con the small guy. But it’s not difficult. It’s exactly the same playbook as Putin, Bolsenaro and Erdogan. A bit of faux working class macho attitude and a lot of hot air. 

It’s good he’s gone but he was merely a mindless vessel. The guys who created him are still around and next time they’ll come up with a smarter guy.

I watch what the president did and he was incredibly America first more so than any president ever..  I have always believed the government was just a b.s. political nonsense but with Trump it was the first time ever I actually saw a president who cared about the people. Unfortunately,... media, big tech, etc.. hated losing power so much they pulled out all stops and went on a rampant 4 year campaign to do nothing but undermine him.. From the start... As a Citizen it was so revitalizing to see a president actually stand up for the small guy... Guess what.. The big guys hated it... Every media channel smeared him non stop, big tech ( social media ) went on massive censorship campaigns and smear campaigns.. I am not surprised people hated him with the intense ammount of state run propagands it was so insane...So here we are.. back to a career politican, business as usual, they literally elected a guy with dementia... What a crazy time..

Nope. Not anymore.

Some (if not most) of them already do get their incomes taxed. The farm guys can’t just say they have “0 employees”. They just fake who the employees are and file taxes to keep everything looking good for Mr IRS. 

+ They don’t make anywhere close to $32k/year working in those farms. 

The sad reality is it would probs only be enough to buy a few F shares, not even a TSLA call.

Well, inflation is usually around 3%, so the buying power of your money is falling every year.

im sitting here doing the math on how much your taxes would actually go down if all illegal immigrants here in US major cities paid taxes on their ~2 minimum wage jobs because all these maga dumbfucks keep bringing it up.

Taking all that combined tax from illegal aliens in Dallas, for example, and allocating it back into the remaining citizens it would be around $2000 yearly. (32k a year, 20% tax, spread back into remaining 1.5 mil)

so after all that money goes into the state, and other taxes get taken out on top of that from additional taxes youre going to save about a grand if you actually have a decent job.

So youre separating families and sending people back with actual under the table jobs that nobody else wants, just to save urself enough for 1 TSLA call contract. It is extremely hard to go through the citizenship process in this country it needs to be changed.

Orange man is volatile which brings more instability. Secondly, Biden is a centrist much like Obama. Market has no problems with that. More importantly, no drastic changes can take effect given the senate is still majority Red.
All jokes aside I hope they catch the perpetrator. Within a short amount of time he’s going to fuck with the wrong house and get what’s coming to him. Idiot should’ve just gotten a 9-5 and spent his hard earned money on stonks like some of us here. Death to him and his family lineage

You seem like you're trolling, but if not, who told you people don't like Trump "cuz media said so"? That's right, your media did. 

People can give you a laundry list of things he said and did that make them not like him. But there has been a massive propaganda and censorship campaign to deny any facts that don't support the president, and you welcomed it.

You need to learn about fox news, and the GOP. One of their tactics is to accuse their opponents of exactly what they themselves are doing.

Come back to us friend.

I think they will drop like everything else, if there is a crash. I used to be a big PM bug, but here are some points.

1. The rest of the world has a decent amount of PMs in their stash. If we move the center of power from the US dollar to PMs, this means the US loses some of it's power, and our govt will fight hard to not allow this to happen.
2. There's a lot of gold out there that can be sold if the price rises, and production will quickly increase, if we went to, say, 20k/oz. However, this is not an efficient use of time and money. Wealth should be based on what you produce for the world that benefit's the human race; simply holding a certain object should not make one wealthy. Create or invent something that the market wants and you will be rewarded in fiat currency. If gold rose to 20k/oz, think of all the people in the world who would give up their day job and start tearing up the environment (PM mining is a damaging activity) just for a big payday. Who's going to build/manage stuff when they're out digging for gold? A massive rise in PM price doesn't make much sense to me.
3. Commodity price suppression is most likely real. There are a ton of very important industries (computing, vehicles, electronics, etc) that rely on a nice supply of PMs, and the financial success of those companies are very important to some powerful nations. Having access to cheap materials keeps economies humming, and the only people it really screws over are the miners and the people investing in them. What if the price of wheat or beef or silver is really 10x what it's at now? What would that do to inflation?

"Freedom is a fragile  thing and is never more than one generation away from extinction.It is  not ours by inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly  by each generation, for it comes only once to a people. Those who have  known freedom and then lost it have never known it again." - MLK

As a Trump supporter we were fact checked and banned into oblivion. They took our voice away.. any way they could... I hope you understand.. As our voice faded away and your voice remained.... Your voice, too, will slowly fade away the second you decide you are not satisfied with which you once thought was what you wanted..  The people will collectively have no voice left to be heard.. They took ours first.. They took yours second. History proves this true throughout every society in history. We are not immune from collapse. This is why we are so concerned about what is happening. This is not a 'I won' , ' You lost' game.. This is about the very fabric that holds together our society.

Hmmm ok. Go to YouTube and type central park 5.

Also watch the recent debate in which hes completely unwilling to denounce a white nationalist terrorist group. If you're not open to the idea after those, you may have some bias you are unaware of(not saying that that's true, just a possibility).

Also take into an account different groups causing civil unrest or violence and how he reacts to these different groups, what the color of their skins are. You'll see a difference.

You guys are not even retarded. You are legit missing your brains if you think it’s okay to go to school for 40 years of your life and constantly run the chance of getting kicked out at any point, EVEN IN MED SCHOOL, all for $120k/ year.

You will see admissions decline like you’ve never seen before and then we will have to spend tax dollars incentivizing people to do it like we did with dentists in the 70/80’s.

Who tf in their right mind who go through it all for that shitty pay. And then what will everyone else below them be paid? If the pay diff between 4 year degree nurse and 15 year degree surgeon is like $20-30k... idk who wouldn’t just be a nurse. Just the 10 extra years of income would probably leave you better off as a nurse vs surgeon who loses 10 yrs income in additional schooling. 

I can’t believe this is even a conversation/ way of thinking.

The media has so much power.. Look how they turned nearly 1/4 of a country on a great president and led a communist with dementia into presidency during one of the greatest power grabs ever. People don't like Trump 'cuz media said so' . We have experienced one of the greatest frauds of all time right in front of our eyes. A massive propaganda and censorship campaign has just taken place. It was so well executed that people welcomed it. This will go down in history books. You welcomed censorship to your opposition.. History shows... You will not welcome that same censorship when that same iron fist slams down on you..  You are not their friends.. First we were censored.. Second you are censored. This will not be as pleasant for you the second time around. - In the end... Both of us will be in the same boat.

I've bought in and out of PLTR a lot but sealed in this week. I had about 40% of my portfolio in shares previously and I'm back at that point now, although I've missed some tendies. 

The way I see it, sitting around saying "I could have bought in cheaper" is just a recipe for deeper FOMO in the future. 

I like browsing threads from years ago where people worry about selling at the peak with shares of AMD around $20 or Amazon at $1500. 

As much as I want to yolo for quick gains I think this could be the one that I look back on and am glad I just held the fucking shares. I'm actually motivated to work more to buy more shares lmao.

If the put you’re selling gets exercised, you’re forced to “buy the dip” at a more expensive rate than market price. If the price recovers back within the range of your strangle, you’re still in the green, but if the price continues to tank, you’ll have bought stock that is quickly becoming worth less. Losses here would be maximal if the stock crashes completely. 

In a similar manner, if the call you’re selling gets exercised but the price continues to skyrocket, although you won’t be losing any money, you’ll have lost out on a lot of potential gains compared to if you didn’t have to sell your stock at the strike. 

If the stock is not volatile, and instead is pretty stable within your strangle range, these puts and calls being exercised can just be thought of as buying dips or taking profits. This is why this only works on stable stocks, not memes
There's a big difference here. Most women do notice what kind of clothes other people wear (at least, every 'do you have a new shirt/glasses etc.. comment i ever get is from.women) while men generally don't notice at all.

The report feature is a great eye opener. 

Only disadvantage is that you cannot aggregate gain/loss of a single stock options (Let's say all options of SQ, different strikes, expiry dates and types -calls/puts- ). 

Instead each contract shows up as an individual item.

It doesn’t feel real that I’m making tendies. I thought I’ll only lose.
i mean everyone has their own way of doing things, I like to do my own DD and read over the 10-Ks myself and make my own assumptions.

at the end of the day we’re in an insane bull market that’s extremely volatile so as long as you’re not doing retarded options, it’s kinda impossible to lose money. this is just 1 play of many and I just so happened to put 16% of my portfolio on this bet. presumably on the fact I don’t believe in diversification and I believe that if you’re going to buy even $1 of an asset, it’s because you believe in it completely.

but still, we’re in a extreme bull market and plays like this aren’t because i’m a genius, just taking advantage of the times we’re in.

edit: yeah i’m an analyst too, forget to say that.

Buy NIO shares or long calls? Positions anyone?
So I just ran an activity report for my IBKR account, YTD.

My most profitable options were SQ, UNH, NOW & CRM.

My biggest losses stemmed from TSLA, AAPL & NVDA.

Smaller gains came from QQQ, SPY, CAT & BABA calls.

I am -2.42% in this account and 19% up on another account which I don't touch (A mix of ETFs).

How does tax dollars being used to buy a $10,000 toilet seat cover for Air Force One instead of a normal $10 one from HD benefit society? 

I’ll wait retard. 

Like I said. More taxes means nothing if the guys in charge don’t manage it correctly. 

All of you thinking more taxes = Utopia are delusional. That not how it works at all

And we also work harder than 98% of the people. Do you not think surgeons deserve their pay?? It’s all proportional and fair. You are thinking of Hollywood movie/ Kim K shit which isn’t real life, esp not at $400k lol


Edit: To your question; Every business you buy after $400k will only make you 40% of what it actually makes. When you expand further out, you can not do everything yourself so you have to hire additional management. So now, not only does it make a ton less bc higher taxes, but it also looses money to management. Now your usual 60% take home (under current taxes) went to 40% after that tax bump and probably 20% after management. 20% of income for all the pain and headache that comes with it is not worth it. + If business slows, or there’s a big accident, or people steal and you don’t micromanage and catch it, it will be very hard to survive and keep it afloat. 

Pls, I can tell you’re just an employee and don’t own anything. When you run your own business and put yourself on the line 24/7, you will understand. It’s so stressful and annoying. You have no life. No one in their right mind would make it even harder on themselves for just 10-20% of what an additional business would make them. They’ll hit $400k and stop.

I wouldn’t want to debate if I were you either. This is one of the most retarded takes I’ve ever seen. Do you know how taxes work? How does something like this cap growth? What you just described is greed. You would be making in the 98th percentile of income meanwhile complaining that that isn’t enough. The reason people are able to become so wealthy in America is that taxes allow society to function at its highest level allowing people to become rich.
pay no mind you have other numbers to be worrying about

Appreciate your well thought out reply, I agree mainly with your comment, but not when it comes to Trump.

My issue is that Trump touted during his campaign that this was the largest tax cut "in history" while the tax cut was tailored to phase out the cuts to middle income people while not increasing the taxes of the rich. His touting of the greatest relief provided to poor and middle class people was the greatest thing he ever did for ordinary Americans.

Of course, he said this about a lot of things, like his "opportunity zones" he promoted as the best thing he did for poor people housing when his son-in-law and othe wealthy real estate moguls found plenty of "opportunity" in these zones that didn't help poor people.
Good luck dude. My monies depend on your success.

I like this stock, will buy in if it falls back. Literally was gonna buy a ton of shares today and then this happened, so I sat it out.
Die hard conservatives *cough trumptards* have provided me with endless amusement for the past 3 days. Even now, on a certain pro-trump website, they are still saying that the entire election was a trap set by Trump because he knew the Democrats were going to try to steal the election, and everything is going according to plan, and that if things don't look good, it's only because Trump knows something they don't but he will soon destroy the entire Democratic party.

The world is in danger of running out of Copium soon at this rate.

I look forward to seeing the Olympic gold medalist level of mental gymnastics that will occur on the conservative subreddits/websites when they drag Trump out of the White House on Jan 20th 2021. "Still all part of the plan guys"

as long as it's BABA gains after a biden win shows we won't be hawkish on china and the random tradewar will end.  I got ass fucked by the ANT IPO getting stalled.  And ANT isn't even BABA!  BABA still rocks and the ANT IPO will still happen.  But fuck my november calls...

It think the market will do what it was going to do regardless of who wins. So no, I don't think it matters all that much.

The question I never found an answer to is "How big is Google?"

I've been casually looking for the answer for 7 years. In fact, the closest thing I found was an article around the time they changed their name to Alphabet that specifically stated that their data footprint couldn't be calculated because even their servers couldn't be estimated.  Too many under too many names.

TLDR I believe the only reason GOOG isn't valued at AAPL  or AMZN levels is because they're better at hiding. They dgaf about punitive fines because they know it's a a fraction of what they gain by breaking the law,  even compared to other businesses. 

Full disclosure: I believe this but sold a few years ago because, like all analysts, I can't *prove* they're undervalued.
I’d be cool with that personally.  Thanks for the read.
Nah I predict we have one big crash when uncle joe orders some fuckhuge lockdown and then the next 4 years should be pretty damn stable. Maybe those fed retards will actually raise interest rates eventually
U own a house yet?
It is not the most efficient spending i agree. But here is what you people dont understand. The money doesnt disappear. They pay regular people to do things. Sometimes they over pay them. That puts the money back into economy. Unfortunately most of the contractors are republicans and they just buy guns and gold but dont tip servers. First hand witness to that lol.
You know more about taxes than someone who has been writing tax and finance legislation for the last 30 years?
YES! TIME PREDICTS BLUE SENATE! FUCK YOU FACISTS!

Dont get me wrong, the dudes got a decent thesis.

I Just think hes over-estimating COVID a bit, and also isnt factoring in what a phase IV covid vaccine is going to do to the market, or another stimulus; or both.

So you have 10k now ?
Both parties get their donation money from large corporations. The fact of the matter is people who earn under 400k will pay much more in taxes as tax breaks will be allowed to expire. Simultaneously any new taxes that are passed will be evaded by just restructuring their holdings for those who earn above this threshold. Their is a reason why the middle class carry more burden of tax proportion to their usable income. It’s because they earn to much for the Democrats to give two shits about and barely enough for Republicans to care about. Two party systems do not serve the American public.

The only actual election rigging that happened was done by him!  Not fucking kidding.  He and his strategists figured out after the primaries what was going to happen in the fall.

We have several states that may be decided by less than 20,000 votes, less than 10,000 votes, and even less than 5,000 votes.  Fuck that traitorous cheating piece of shit.

Go to school till youre 30 then tell me this shit.

People that work hard + take crazy risks should be paid accordingly. You can’t have everyone making the same amount or taxed to death. No one will want to become anything difficult. THATS what’s retarded. + I believe top 10% account for 90% of total tax income already as it is (double check me on that if you want but Ik it’s v. High)

Why would anyone want to grow past $400k if it’s taxed at 50-60% after? You will put a ceiling and cap on individual growth like this. You know how much additional headache it would be for such marginal returns? Gov makes enough. They need better money management and need to stop pushing money up BA and defense contractor’s asses for no reason.

I’m joking but also being serious. You could try to time the top and buy back in on the dips. But unless you have 25k+ you’re gonna be chasing those day trades and then run out. Better to just watch it go uuuuuppp and then down towards the end of the day. A stock on a good run will do that over 1-2 weeks. The thing is. It’ll be up way more in the second week if it keeps running that the first day it went up lol. I’ve sold so many times for 50-100% just to lose money on the next play 😂 so many times if I just held the original good play that was working I woulda been up 500%+. Watch the broad market Sunday night in futures to see what the sentiment is for the coming week. If it’s little red-up, hold them bitches. Big red. Welp you fucked anyways might as well hold and pray 😂 Best of luck!

Biden has said anyone making less than 400K per year would not have their income taxes increased.

Unlike Trump who gave us pleabs a tax cut, but in the same tax cut bill he worked with the republicans on starts phasing back out the tax cuts starting in 2021, except for his rich cronies of course.
This is the way. Snort the seasoning in the ramen for 10% more gains power up.
It’s the future
lmao that would be 5 billion shares
Because you can't think of a more efficient way of spending it than giving it to the people who inflate budgets so as to not lose the up coming finances? Like literally, giving your money to people who waste money to get approval to take more of your money the next year. Don't get me wrong I'm all about paying your taxes, I'd just rather see it spent with a speck of competence before I volunteer to give them more.
Shit...just quit then bro. I just meant we’re with the weed stocks again is all though
Most Trump supporters are already OLD and not going to grow up.  They're closer to dying than growing up.  And they'll only vote for the Party of the White Man now.  Trump made it so explicit.  White people vote for me.
The sad part ppl think that the new investors. Are gamblers which we kinda are. But I started in 2016 with penny stocks and stocks. But the community is growing. On cnbc we made up like 23% of the market.

This article was written on oct 22.. It says Joe Biden will win the election.. In fact.. The article actually says a coronavirus vaccine will come feb 11, 2021... These are not crack pot articles.. These are the worlds rulers literally planning out the worlds future and sharing it with one another. I am not saying it is good or bad.. But it is real..

Nice! Taking bets against crowded trades and fear-mongering almost always gives good risk/reward.

Near-expiry VIX puts (again) was one of the trades of the year.

Same. All of my trades this month have fucked hard.
McConnell is a dipshit.  The repugs already sold out their soul under Obama, just much of it happened under the radar and then climaxed with fucking the dems over on their supreme court choice.  McConnell has already said subtly he'll be calling the shots if he's in control of the senate and the only the things that he will allow Biden to do have to be acceptable to him first.  Some republicans have already flexed and pointed out that if they wanted they could deny Biden from even having a cabinet and they plan to not let him have a single thing they can get away with.  i.e. not a single judge will be appointed and pass a McConnell senate.  They will leave the government gutted even worse than what they did to Obama.  Why?  Because Trump has shown how much more they can get away with and not suffer the consequences.
i have a BS in economics i would know

Google makes many efforts to crush competition. Don't be salty because you want them to have a world wide monopoly.
RKT - If the market crashes, we'll be looking at all time lows since this stock is new. Possibly between $7.50 and $9.50.

AAPL - Anything below $90 would be a good buy. AAPL is on my list. Personally, I'm waiting for sub $70. Whether or not that ever happens, I don't know.

AMD - Another one on my list. $59, then low $40s, then low $20s if shit really hits the fan.
I know absolutely nothing about the whole pizza gate shit. I remember it in T_D hay day, I've seen meme's, but thats the extent of my knowledge.

Read his actual tax plan. Your family

Yes and no. The market only takes its stonks and goes home on level 3 circuit breaker, 20%. It's possible.

We've never had a sell off trip a level 2 circuit breaker since we've had them though. The level 1 at 7% has been enough every time so far.

People naturally move to the right as they age. I think we can generally agree that incest is not okay in todays views and lets say you’re 25 at the moment. Fast forward 35 years you are now 60 and the “liberals” of 2055 are for incest because in 2055 there is new tech that makes incest babies not retarded, but you who is considered a liberal of 2020 think incest is disgusting and vote against it. You in 2055 didn’t become less liberal, but your viewpoints just never changed.

Yes.
Well,you also have to factor in they are getting ballots in the mail everyday and the human element of this equation. Although a machine could be invented to open envelopes and stack ballots to be loaded into counting machine.

But your absolutely right, I am smarter than you because I actually spent a few minutes to think about what actually has to happen for a ballot to be counted and know a little bit about how automated machines work so I was able to calculate a few rough estimates regarding time frames.

Do us all a favor, and go fuck yourself!

Jpow knows that Republican Senate response to a Biden presidency is going to be pretending that the GOP is fiscally conservative again. He's trying to warn them off of it (or in mcconnell's head maybe encourage him to not vote for stimulus so that he can blame Biden for a bad economy in 2-4 years)

Don’t be dense.
A lot of people here make over $400k annually here my guy. $400k is also not extremely wealthy. 

That’s just normal people that work hard: Doctors, Dentist, Surgeons, Lawyers, Successful Small Business.

This is a funny misconception. I say funny not as insulting, but amusing, because this industry is 99% about leetcode and nothing else at the lower levels (L3 and L4). 

I work at a company seen as "prestigious" by a lot of people in and outside of the industry, and our hiring is complete shit. Literally just grind leetcode problems and pray to RNGesus that you see one of them in an interview, and bam you now work at a FAANG. Worked for me, and I'm a normal dude. I spent more time in the gym than studying during college 😂

No, not inevitable, but if there was another one, those would be good prices to buy those stocks at.

Those calls are just 3 months out so I don't know. If weed stocks really take off, I could see TLRY getting to at near $50 at least. But if the market does crash, it'll likely take everything down with it.

Going 75%+ long on a SMID caps you actually believe in with a 2 year time horizon rather than gambling with YOLO otm calls

My portfolio is up 500% in 25 mo

Before I take any position, I ask myself, how much do I lose if i am totally, completely wrong? 

For blue chips that’s realistically 20-30%. For SMID that can be 50-60%. But *most* options expire worth much less than the purchase price

As a liberal I sincerely hope Biden can be a more centrist president and try and bring together both sides.

The division of America is our downfall.
Your portfolio is less than $3000? if you were a genius at analysis, you'd have a tad more than that sitting around. I don't mean that as an insult, but it is something you should consider.

But hey maybe this is your break out play so what the fuck do I know =P

I even agree with a lot of your analysis, but are you trying to be right or are you trying to make money. Those options may make you lose on both.

When do you think the spin to covid actions being part of the War on Christmas starts?
Fair enough, I don’t trade CVS. I own a fair amount of healthcare through a fund, but I don’t have any individual healthcare company positions. I’ve been selling a lot of puts, and covered calls, with IV so insane lately. Wish I could have back that $130 VTWO 11/20 call at $1.05 though, seemed like free money with the Russell tanking back the low 120s/ high teens, at the time.

Quit playing video games and listening to the media and open your eyes. The truth is out there. The truth is not handed to you on a silver platter. The truth takes effort. Look deeper into what is happening because the media tells you what they want you to know. Breaking away from the media tyranny and opening your eyes is equivalent to entering the matrix. Open your eyes.

RKT, APL,AMD
I know it's just for illustration but I actually own MSFT and have for 10 years.  It paid a 3% dividend when I bought at 35.  I sell strangles monthly at +/- 10% and that returns approx 1.5% per month.  So the return is 19% per year not counting cap gains but including dividend and strangles.

Not bad.  But not quite the numbers you mention.  Non meme stocks at those deltas don't return that much.

I felt this way when i bought vxx calls on Friday and kept seeing it get killed every day this week
Keep in mind this assumes the market crashes again. Approximate prices to buy and average down at.

NIO - $18, $12, $8

TRLY - $6.30, $3

JMIA - $12.50, $7.50

XPEV - Too new, so I'm not sure but for now, $20 would be a good initial entry.

GME - Between $6-$8

If any of these stocks go much higher than where they're at now before a crash then it's possible these buy prices won't ever get hit.

Trump strikes me as the dude to watch this and be like fuck yeah, I’m actually not gonna leave lmao

One of my professors today said there was no legal precedent for a sitting president to leave office anyways. So he could literally just stay
Imagine oversleeping in this economy.....
I did sell them off. I guess I should clarify, I am ready to own shares only if things do not go as planned. Meaning I do not breakeven. My breakeven was 61 on these. Had CVS not done what it did today, Instead of taking a loss I would have just exercised the options at expiry.

They said they were “in talks” with the UK. Doesn’t mean they’re gonna license their entire service to the developing world. But I’m just bitter, missed out on a 5 bag on my 11/20 calls because I sold the day of the election. Long story short, it was cool at $12 and no longer cool at $14 & $15. They need to back that up on their earnings report next week and I have a suspicion that they won’t
Fucking fantastic
Anyone ever just find themselves in a total rut in life in almost every aspect? I'm at that point, where I DESPERATELY need one thing to go right for me, but I just can't seem to catch any breaks in anything. I've never been a big believer that a person's fate is anything outside of what they make it, but as I get older, I just can't help shake the feeling that I'm just meant to keep coming up short or failing. I mean, it's always one thing after another. I do everything I can to make sure I can perform in the aspects I deem important in life, yet it's always that little bit of stuff I don't have control of that ALWAYS ends up fucking me over and going against me. I know nobody on here gives a fuck, but I'm tired of THIS life man. I haven't enjoyed life or anything about it for years now, and as time keeps going, I despise it more and more. I'm not gonna kill myself because my mom would just be destroyed, but I'm genuinely at that point where if someone shot me dead today, I'd probably wanna thank them.
Yea if it’s 1985.

Too much hype? The market went bonkers, yes, but PLTR was already priced at a premium when it went from $7.50->$10 at their direct offering. To double from its initial offering price within 6 weeks is asinine
It was me! I was hoping the profit made from this would help me recover losses from NIO puts this week 😢 😞 😔 😢
how so?

The test for CA was moderately difficult. The course takes about 3ish months. I passed on first try, barely. Then immediately your mailbox gets flooded with agencies who want to recruit you. But their deals are trash. Usually only 40-50% cut of sales comissions AND they make you pay monthly dues to have a desk in their office and use their branding. 

I suggest finding a small time broker like an old man in his little office they will cut you nicer deals i keep 80% of my comissions and no dues

They are trying to keep you boxed in. They don’t want you asking questions or discovering new things. They want you tied down, unaware and sucking off the proverbial tit of society.

wtf did u say??
I think so too
I mean it can be either but I am more inclined towards red. Mainly since Biden’s presidency is getting slightly obvious and if trump keeps quiet during the weekend shouldn’t make much of a difference. Also coz the unemployment numbers came out on Friday and past week has been weirdly a green week. Usually over the weekend, the buying cools off and selling begins. I am thinking gonna open red but gonna get green soon afterwards.

Statistically, Trump is done. Secondly, no reputable evidence of fraud has been found in election sites given they employ dems, republicans, and 3rd party supporters. In addition, any errors that have surfaced so far about “fraud” were minor mistakes that were found and resolved swiftly.

Describe to me what type of voter fraud is being committed. Don’t give me examples of 4-5 voter mistakes resulting in ballot errors in a sample of 120+ million votes.

Every group of people have the crazies. Those ain’t the ones you worry about. 

Personally I don’t trust what’s going down. Trump seems to be getting used as a scape goat to install a system to strip freedoms away. 

It’s the beginning of the end. You’ve got white people telling black people they’re racist because they have different views.

Georgia is not flipped yet - LOTS of votes pending.  You are correct that voter fraud is incredibly commit....in a normal election. This election is not a normal election and the mail-in ballots have been a complete mess.

Its a huge mess and its going to end up being settled in the Supreme Court.

Earnings on Monday, might wanna wake up early on Monday before you wake up with your gains gone.
Because you bought, it'll crash to 30. Essentially how the stock market works.
In the article it literally says there is a system for in place for correcting instances such as this. Sounds like the system worked and if there were any other occurrences that happened, you can bet Trump would be publicizing it to the fullest extent.. I think that 6k like this is an anomaly that happens very rarely and is not an indicator of any widespread problem..
wtf is a gap? it’s hitting 95
Instead of this, consider selling them off to get a little bit of time premium close to expiry, or if you still believe in it and your trade hasn’t had the time it needs to play out, just roll them out without adding more money. The only real reason to exercise is if you don’t want to take the tax hit in this year/want LTCG.

All I do is buy contracts without any dd 

I’m sure someone here does way more Hw on stocks than I do with proper technical evaluations. So why did NIO dip today? Signs of a sell off or just biding time until lift off next week?

I did notice the bullish triangle pattern thing  on it today
Yeah and I sold my puts Thursday and jumped into calls. And they were expensive as fuck. Im so fucked. I think ACB might tank on Monday. I need ACB to kill ER and save my portfolio
Friday and been a few hours since market close now we in the end of the day but I already miss you guys 😔
Thanks dude.

I know this isn’t usually the place for sound financial advice but get a credit card and just continue to use your debit card so you have one if you need it.

I tend to agree. I think policies can affect a sector but in turn, probably helps another one. At the end of the day, they don’t have much affect but a big thing Trump ran on was Biden tanking the market(and that’s a typical Republican talking point, not just Trump) and it’s just not accurate according to history.

Oh wow. Must be spooky. A noble profession though. In that case I suggest in the future you stay out of these time sensitive trades or try setting an alarm. Although its not WSB fashion but if you can't be up during market hours probably best just buying some safe stocks and indexs. Hopefully you're ACB doesn't go tits up, I think you have a chance of getting out in time I doubt it'll go super quickly its not a super shit stock. Just get it done as quick as possible hopefully it works out. Best of luck
Good luck 🍀 hope you get rich quick. I bought calls at the top too but for 3 months out. Might have to scale in some more over time.

what kind of beta r/investing shit is this
3k is what I play with if it is OTM. If it is ITM options I play with more as I am ready to exercise and own shares at expiry if things do not go according to plan. For ITM I make sure I pick a strike I am comfortable and confident it won't go below and expire worthless. In this case I was confident CVS would not go below 55 and it never did inspite of all that red. This was a gain of 100%. So I put in 20k for 34 contracts. I was ready to own 3400 shares of cvs at 55 at expiry if I did not breakeven.

It just means more people voted. Remember, more people are voting now than ever before. The fact that Biden has such a large gap in popular vote and he swung around a state like Georgia has Republicans shook. 

You’d know voter fraud is incredibly difficult to commit if you’re well acquainted with the process of manually voting. It’s easier to hack a government site than commit large scale voter fraud. 

Evidence is required that includes a large sample size of voter fraud. Not just one or two cases of voting errors that ended up being corrected.

Even if there's a rug pull, the market will bounce right back up anyway. In March, the impact of Covid was mostly known. Now, we know what it is.

Besides, if the market does drop, it'll be because the big boys decide it's time for the market to drop, not because of Covid but they'll use Covid as the catalyst to maybe let it drop further than normal.

US was doing pretty great during that 47 years. Calm and structured leadership. As of recent we have not had so much of that.
California only has 66% reporting, and he basically already won North Carolina. Mango wins once he gets California

Edit: Trump has 214 Electorials, so if he gets Cali(55) plus North Carolina (done deal, 15) he's got himself a whole 284 electorials which is 14 more than he even needs. There's a lot of votes left.

Vote Early and Vote Often
Depends what you mean. A lot of the market reaction will be pure sentiment anyway.

It may mean one of the worst fourth quarters for retail in a long time.

No proposed stimulus package seems to have an answer for those behind on mortgages etc. besides you can't kick them out. That should be a lot of fun in a few months.

What happens to the market in the long run  will depend on what they do with the money.  Initially, I'd think the market will dump on stimulus.  The headlines will read markets down on disappointment on scope and/or size of stimulus.

My response to that is to buy $HYG puts expiring December.

Corporate debt ETFs will tank massively like they did in march.
Seriously. Having to get "approved" sounds so low class. Either walk in their with a briefcase of cash or take the bus.
Another tip. After watching the video, keep in mind you mostly won't be exercising the option in this scenario with WTHR. You will buy a few call options and when (really IF) it goes up from currwnt level, those contracts gain a ton of value. However much depends. But if you are happy, TAKE PROFITS. 

Options loose value as the exp date approaches (theta decay), and 11/20 is considered close (but cheap) so my advice: if WTRH goes to 5, 7 , or even like 9$ after earnings, SELL some, and keep some. If WTRH drops back to like 5 while you hold, waiting until 11/20 will reverse your gains bigly.

I'm thinking of yoloing a bit of cash on this, probably buy 100 shares and then like 10 calls. But if it hits like 5 or 6 this week and my exp is 11/20, I'm selling all my calls and holding shares. Then I may SELL COVERED call options on the stock but I'll watch what it does
Can you come through for me?

not really; the market does not historically move a lot from elections, and a lock up with the election isnt going to mean much, stimulus isnt happening until later anyways. The market wants stability, the end of the election is a signal for stability. 

Also everyone and their mom is shorting the market, long VXX/VIX, thats too easy. 

Maybe in march it made sense since it was unknown if the US would actually do a lock down, so that was an actual event that wasnt priced in. But short of a civil war, i think trump vs biden shit right now is heavily priced in.

But yes, keep shorting the market over an event we've all been talking about shorting for the last 7 months.
Yeah, Leslie Knope had a crush on him.  I'm sold.

Also he's built an established record as a guy who actually gets shit done by working across the aisle.

My favorite thing that people do is assume that when they dont know something, that the answer doesn't exist.  The facts elude me therefore I create my own.
Guy's he's been through an Obama/Biden economy once and is not interested in doing it again (see, SP500 from ~800 Jan/09 to ~2200 Jan/17).

I ran some numbers.  Used Population of Florida as example.  If like 80-90% of the state’s population voted, and they had 1000 counting machines that counted 3 ballots a second it would’ve taken less than 5 hours.

Do the math. Even if they only counted 1 ballot a second and only had several hundred machines it probably wouldn’t be more than 36 hours.

yes

Biden being a huge advocate of clean energy especially EVs means NIO isn’t going anywhere.

It has also been reported that China is glad to see their “old friend” back in the White House.

Let's be real, its probably not a good sign that its already come out that trumps legal team was totally unprepared and not the all star team he envisioned, nowhere near the star power and level of preparedness bush had in Florida in 2000, and coubtless legal experts, including those involved in Florida in 2000, say the lawsuits are going absolutely nowhere. 

And also let's be real some more.  This is what we've come to expect from the Trump presidency.  Completely out of his depth.

It's true that *some* people in Hong Kong are fans of Trump, but it's not based on anything substantial. It begins and ends with "trump says he is tough on China and implements tariffs." The tidbits of info that get translated into Chinese-language news make Trump look like a savior to them, in this time of ridiculous struggle for Hong Kong. 


And, it makes sense. Trump does look really hard on china. But, that doesn't necessarily mean he actually is, and it doesn't mean Hong Kong activists are right about which US candidate is better for them.

To be clear, I don't think Biden or Trump are the right people to help Taiwan and Hong Kong. But I also don't believe that Biden is somehow worse for Hong Kong activists. Biden is far more engaged with Taiwan, was one of the senators that voted for the Taiwan protection act, has recently taken official trips to Taiwan, and was the first US politician to publicly congratulate the anti-china president of Taiwan when she was reelected. 


Taiwanese Americans, who have family in Taiwan, overwhelmingly voted for Biden. Because they are actually here, on the ground, and can see the Trump presidency up close.

I voted for Biden just because he was projected to win and I was kinda indifferent. I need literally any win in my life I can get. Stock market (and anything financial), job, love, friends, and basically everything else all loses. But I picked one right. 

This counts as a win, right? Right?

Chinese-brand cars were also burned, though that was not as common.

This sounds likely.  Now that Trump knows he probably done he doesn't wanna pass anything because then people will say he added to the deficit.  He'll leave that for Joey boy.

Once the votes are tallied Biden will probably be a lot more ahead than Trump, which is why there is a long wait; still more votes to count and to make sure without a doubt that they call it correctly.

Good post, though I think the daily death rate is more important than increased case numbers. The daily death rate has remained somewhat stagnant while cases keep rising. I don't think the market will react much to rising case numbers as opposed to rising daily deaths. I believe this is more important than R0 for the stock markets.

Very small position as most of my hard earned cash is in something I know will go up. I don’t give a fuck what happens but flipping the calls 100-200% would be nice. Dropped to 55.82 a few days ago. I really don’t want to hit that support level again. But if it *does* hit 55.82, I would set a buy around 56 and use an appropriate stop loss at 5%
That would destroy any sympathy for their cause unless it's against (hardened) government targets, in which case they die against superior federal firepower. Will be interesting to watch. I'd love to see the country take domestic terrorism more seriously.
Anyone seen 51 first dates?

Or it's just that it's incredibly close in multiple states and they want to count all outstanding votes in those states. Really not too complicated; it's just never really this close, there have never been this many votes, and we are under a pandemic that causes more mail-in votes that need to be counted.

From the $SNAP prospectus:

“Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion, and transfer rights. Class A common stock is non-voting. Anyone purchasing Class A common stock in this offering will therefore not be entitled to any votes. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to one vote and is convertible into one share of Class A common stock. Each share of Class C common stock is entitled to ten votes and is convertible into one share of Class B common stock. The Class C common stock, which is held by our founders, each of whom is an executive officer and a director of the company, will represent approximately 88.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering.”

Do you ever lose money? Yes. But it is pretty consistent, especially in this environment. Sell covered puts and calls. Puts have a pure profit dead zone which is good for having a buffer between you and market noise. Stay covered so that you don't get wiped out on the next black swan. Pretty steady and consistent but don't make your whole portfolio that method or you'll fomo making 2% when calls are up 30%
Yes, we have to massage Trumps ego like a baby to slowly get him to come around to the fact that he lost the election and allow him to peacefully give up power. It's sad, but this is the state of affairs of this country right now. This is our President.

Looking to get shares of JKS. Looking for it to fly up on earnings on 11/17. It dropped 7 today, down to $65. Curious to know what the thoughts are on it dropping for a better entry? I have a 100 share order pending (just entered) for $60.11 (1st Fibonacci). Will it drop or will it just continue to climb? I'm thinking 20-30 points tbh. If I can free up capital, I'm willing to avg down aa needed. Based on time and funds. Looking to get 500 shares before take off.
you'd be surprised how insecure some people are
QQQ. But, I had several calls on tech stocks and I was using that as a hedge, especially if Trump won and some of the high flying Tech stocks sold off. Bought it when the ETF was trading at 273. If only it would have been calls. Lol

For those who are wondering why the election hasn't been called yet even though it is abundantly clear Biden will win: 

- The media outlets are deliberately waiting it out till all votes are counted with complete transparency.... because as the hours and days go by, the mental fatigue of Trump and his voters start to kick in as they slowly come to the realization that they have lost this election. 
- This also allows for all the immediate and initial reactive anger to subside and slowly brings Trump and his supporters to the final phase of Grief... Acceptance. 

So there is a deliberate and methodical reason behind why the election is not being called yet while every vote is slowly and transparently being called: to avoid civil war.
Fuck a stimulus...Just use margin till you can’t.

More demand = more production = more jobs and a healthy economy.

I'm pretty sure Trump, or any president, can't just send out stimulus checks without approval by congress. I don't know shit about politics, but I know Trump 100% would have sent out checks in September, before the first votes, if he could have. It's all fucking politics, the dems stopped Trump from sending any sort of stimulus before election and the republicans would have done the same damn thing if this happened under Obama. They run the system and we're the pawns. There's no good vs evil or republicans vs democrats, it's all about holding power and control. Trump is a narcissist asshole and Biden is a sleepy corrupt politician. 

At the end of the day our lives wont change a bit between whos in power. At least now we don't have to hear Trump bitch on twitter and people bitch about Trump.

 Good news is there's prob gonna be a fat stimulus check now that the election is over which means calls gonna cash
