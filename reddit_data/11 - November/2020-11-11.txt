What‚Äôs the measured move on that wick?
Would be super excited with that $AMD kind of turnaround. I suppose I was lucky with NIO and PLUg. (Not to mention SPCE on this board.) Anything is possible if the new management succeeds. üëç
Valuation is whack imo. If you're in better go long
We got a John Madden over here
You're better off buying a 2021 @ 4; 4 is the norm for the stock historically as far as I can tell. It's a slow climb but $4 will net you more than the $7 will after theta and vega.
Lmao

Hail Satan.
I feel the pain of months worth of losses was put into this post
It's been a hard few weeks for bears, it's okay to be angry
Are you delirious to the fact that their entire portfolio IS NIO? Never underestimate the collective insanity of the WSB meme bandwagon
I‚Äôm going to write one on $UNIT and why it‚Äôs undervalued and it‚Äôll half make sense
NIO is the new üçâ?
That's painful to look at
https://imgur.com/t/funny/R390EId
Shutdowns are good for HD imo
Manufacturing cost per vehicle, shipping and logistics all play a big part of upfront cost as well.

If NIO is spending less than Tesla to manufacture and ship a vehicle, then that would factor into EPS as well since it's less money spent.

I 100 percent think NIO is gonna slow down but simple blanket statements like that aren't good DDs for such aggressive puts. Who's not to say NIO doesnt announce dramatic logistical changes that lower the upfront cost of vehicle manufacturing? What about new battery breakthrough? Or how about potential Pacific trade deals? All of these factor into pure hype that is gonna push this thing along until they go too long without an announcement of some kind.

Right now NIO is pricing in to future growth rather than current numbers whereas Tesla will have to spend exponentially more to grow their share price at the same rate. 

Right now I see NIO capping at 50 by Dec on hype and trickling down to 40 by Feb. Your put is too aggressive given the circumstances surrounding the company. Pure hype is going to drive this thing into 2021 before it cools down.

I'd rather play March 38p but I dont have nearly the balls you do. 

God speed if your strike a tendie vein with your put though.

I don‚Äôt think increased education leads to economic prosperity. I think economic prosperity leads to increased education. Maybe just a fundamental disagreement. I do think a certain level of education for all is important and that a large portion of the US doesn‚Äôt attain it, but I also think there‚Äôs a lot of low value education attained just so people can apply to jobs that require a four year degree on paper but in reality just require basic social skills and critical thinking.

Heard a rumor that NIO will be the star of Matrix 4.
Why though?
$NIO FOMO still on?
Well, SNE doesn't tend to rocket one way or the other very often so I've been able to pretty frequently profit on the premiums while staying under strike on the contracts. I know that's pretty slow rolling in the grand scheme but I get free exposure on the weekend and long-term gains you can't get anywhere else. Totaled 7.8K in 2 months between day trades/CC. Wondering if that's out of the norm or expected. Either way - amped.

Nobody who has ever worked at Gawker or any of it's sibling outlets deserves any respect and should never be considered more than rage bait bloggers. Fuck you, Tom McKay.

I don‚Äôt actively trade it but have been holding since Sept and it‚Äôs made me absolutely nothing.  It‚Äôs a long term investment and you have to buy more and more on red days to add to your position and probably only realize gains years from now.  I like ARK funds but I feel like most have peaked already and growth will likely be slow for years to come.  The biggest thing that moves it is TSLA and most of us are already balls deep in that.  A friend in wealth management has been pumping ARKG as their next big winner but again, the Genomic revolution is like 10+ years away it will be a slow ascent I don‚Äôt have the fucking patience I already have an IAP & Pension for that kind of growth.  ETFS I see a bigger near term upside on are KWEB (China), QCLN (Green), ICLN (Green), TAN (Solar), GIGE (Gig Economy) to mention a few.

**The parable of the blind men and an elephant**

It is a story of a group of blind men who have never come across an elephant before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. 

Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. 

The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.

TLDR:, We are all fuk.

Do you guys think the NIO rumor is true?
Nikola is a tremendous company, tremendous. Never seen anything like it. They somehow became worth billions with only $30,000 in revenue. Truly remarkable.

NIO buying out SPY
Also what they said at $10, $15, $20, $30, $35, $40....

One of the best looking charts I have ever seen. These aren‚Äôt low volume pumps either. huge volume, which allows this thing to consolidate very quickly at new levels in a day or two (or even intraday), where most other stocks would take weeks. Is it overvalued? Yes. Does that matter in this market? No. Will it keep going? Who the hell knows, but why fight the trend? January 50c is what I‚Äôm playing on it (rolled out my January 20c I had from 3 months ago).
Nemo did 9/11
Hypothetically I was in a similar position. Last week I was down 90% this week I am down 60%

Depends. Qqq tends to be tech and tech manufacturing heavy. Basically the etf of the future. SPY is well balanced for volatile times such as now, but it is not well suited for a collapse and spy would be hit harder during a crash.
How are futures looking.

Sqqq calls. Is it bullish or bearish? I‚Äôd call it the Minotaur move. Also, why are you going so far out of the money? Why not go for shorter dated options that are more reasonably priced thus likely to profit? UUP calls and puts are extremely cheap. I‚Äôd go call heavy with June or May expiration with the expectation to sell early in February or March.

Recently moved to Fort Lauderdale. Publix is great. Dislike Trader Joe‚Äôs because unnecessary packaging on things like cucumbers and tomatoes but I do still go there for a few things every now and again
A for effort
I wanna know too
I see the numbers 16.50 and 795 I don't know what they mean because I didn't read it but I'm in.
They better pump it at night but I doubt it.
I have been cleaning up pretty good selling weeklies on DAL and SNE. Got really lucky last week that DAL shot up after calls expired Monday morning. Made 5k, short sold them, bought back in 3 dollars lower lol.

So, short answer is yes. I only own 100 shares but once I'm back to break-even on MSFT and cannabis (don't ask why I did that because I can't answer it) I'll be moving those investments to SNE probably. Selling calls on MSFT isn't worth it.
This is not the way.

Please make this happenüôè
Yup
You obviously make it back. You have 30% left you can do this. DO NOT YOLO THIS. You have to make small plays and make it back over a year. Maybe 10% a month at a time. Whatever you do don‚Äôt let your wife know and stall for as long as possible while you‚Äôre making it back. Say some shit about interest rates being so low that it‚Äôs actually not the best move to pay off loans right now. Idk. If she‚Äôs smart she might see through the excuses though. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Gaslight. Gaslight. Gaslight

You need it to hit $145.62 just to break even.  Hope for a  run up tomorrow and sell at the peak TOMORROW. DO NOT HOLD TO FRIDAY NOT MATTER WHAT.

Part of the value of the call is IV - implied volatility or basically uncertainty of what is happening at Disney.  Once the announce ER tomorrow at 4:30 all of that uncertainty disappears and the only value would be intrinsic or the price about the strike of $143.

You will be lucky to get half back if Dis hauls butt tomorrow to $143.  Even if it look like it will go higher on Friday, sell.  You will have some value on IV and time value above intrinsic before earnings.

I have watch calls lose most of their value the day after earnings even if they were above strike.
I got 425c 06/2021. I have been buying when it dips and bag hold it untill it turns profit. Sell half, repeat and rinse. So far made 2k+ with few hundred bucks investment.
That's what I was hypotheticaly thinking

Another good call as well as stocks to buy imo is IBIO.  Their manufacturing plant has the abilities to mass produce any vaccine.  Its cheap and pretty certain they will be a main manufacturing and distribution center for the vaccine.

MM‚Äôs just got back to me, they asked what a u/aux_armes was.
Oh for sure, I agree. Do you already own SNE shares? Because if you do, the SNE 1/21/22 $85c premium is has a $12.20/$12.60 bid ask spread. If you already have a bunch of shares at a decent average cost, you could very well grab up a few grand in premium on top of locking in a future $X amount gain on the back end. It‚Äôs worth looking into, if you do, as a solid theta play.
Elgoog
So hypotheticaly speaking. What's the difference between 70% and 100%. I'm hypotheticaly bad both ways. Might as well do one last yolo ?
I just have confidence in the FED, thats all. It's not very fair to compare a random drunk to a federal entity whose sole purpose is to promote financial stability and development. They work under a ton of supervision and have been very competent in the past. You really think that they havent thought ahead at all? There may be some struggle, but I'm sure the market will be fine in the long run.

Nokia started to lose market share to Huawei, ERIC, and Samsung under leadership that languished for the past 10-15 years, falling behind in 5G R&D during that time and diluting shares.

Absolutely nothing
Same date, but $350. Very far out, but if they go back to "stocks only go up" mode, I don't see it being a bad play. I'm holding until a few weeks before, crossing my fingers I can sell it around Christmas time for decent gains
[Look](https://imgur.com/gallery/7aLDycz) at all the 0dte SPY plays you can make now.

Shall get laughed at but since were all retarded here it‚Äôs 2023 $4c for the company that just got a deal with NASA to install 5g on the moon. And to the guy talkin bout straddles I think the theta was at .0001 (atleast according to Robinhood) so not to worried about the theta for now.

Dude. Ambien on planes is a bad idea. People go to sleep but they‚Äôre actually sleep walking and do shit. 

Google the one about the guy who took a shit on the drink cart. 

People get up and take their clothes off. Piss on other people.  

My doc gives me ambien for travel but told me only to take it once I got to the hotel and locked my doors.  

Just drink a few glasses of wine and lay the seat flat and you‚Äôll be out in no time.

Okay so we know the stock market isn't the economy. 

But what would happen from an economic standpoint if we drop to say $275 and stay within that range for a few years?

Would the economy be impacted by a flat market insomuch as there wouldn't enough income generated for retirement accounts which gets funneled into everyday spending?
Algos scrape this sub, this sub is retarded+

Hypotheticaly speaking what if you took most of that money plus a loan that she didn't know about and hypotheticaly lost 70% of all that trading. 

So hypotheticaly speaking your supposed to have enough money now to pay off her kia optima which hypotheticaly is the next hyptheical goal and you don't have the money. how do you tell her. 


Asking hypothetical question that's all.

>For one, as noted by University of Iowa College of Law professor Greg Shell, crashes involving SUVs or trucks are four times as likely to kill a child than a car, as the ‚Äúhigh, blunt front ends strike children in the head & direct them downward.‚Äù The Cybertruck‚Äôs angular front angle, combined with its supposedly undentable chassis, suggest that it should actually be named the Tesla Beheader, which is not as good as it sounds. My Gizmodo colleague Brian Kahn also points out at Earther that the marketing pitch for this vehicle appears to position it as an ‚Äúaffordable roving fortress to fend off plebes looking for a handout‚Äù in a climate dystopia, which tracks.

there is an alternative? ive been living my life wrong i guess
Yeah, I mean they‚Äôve always been pretty solid across the board. I‚Äôm just thinking next ER might come out decent with PS5 sales (same for MSFT with XSX/S) and also could do well in the coming 6+ months as they start pushing to release more capable 4K TVs with the 4K 120fps, VRR, HDMI 2.1, etc that, even though their own next-gen console can‚Äôt fully take advantage of, gamers will be likely to want for the XSX/S that can push out those higher benchmark gaming settings.
$1856.60 is an oddly specific amount to invest, bruv

If stock price = $50
You buy an ATM weekly put for 2.50 (250$)
Stock price goes to $45 put is worth 5.00 ($500) [strike 50 minus current price 45 = 5.00]
Stock price goes to $25 at expiration put is worth 25.00 ($2500) [strike 50 minus current price 25 = 25]

Profit = 2500-250= gtfo and go read investopedia

The trick is to not allow your emotions during that space to effect your play. *(Obv easier said than done)* 

If you make a decision you must stand by yourself and be firm on why you made it. Dont allow emotions and the feeling of losing "potential" profits sow doubt in your future decisions. That will end poorly for you.

Locking in profits is excellent. Id rather be up $600 watching it rise to +$1000 rather than trying to time it perfectly and potentially end up -$600.

Use the experience to learn but not to allow emotions to effect your ability to make a sound decision. Also sometimes a loss is invetible. Its part of the game. Dont let it dominate your life.

Good luck
Many people have commented saying that is a myth on various GME threads.  If you don't have a margin balance on TDA you can message TDA and opt out of lending shares.  Other brokerages likely have different rules.
Anyone got any thoughts about some plays I‚Äôm mulling over?: 

Some LAC 5/21/21 $5c-$10c

Some LIT 4/16/21 $45c-$50c

Some SNE 1/21/22 $85c-$95c

Some MSFT 1/21/22 $265c-$275c but they are fucking pricey. 

Some CRSR 12/17/21 $22.5c-30c, but also looking at some earlier dates with lower strikes for about the same premium.

I‚Äôm balls deep in GME.  But this is pretty retarded.  All we can hope for is a share buyback, GME being the only place to buy consoles/fulfill pre orders on time and maybe capturing market share from the new games am that are dropping.  And dropping the MSFT partnership type news that drive the prices up, which might push the cost to borrow up, and it stays up, which might force shorts to cover.  Other than major news or statement dropping from GME, we‚Äôre just going sideways.  If everyone on wsb bought like 50 shares we might have a shot at this epic squeeze
I‚Äôve heard about the rumor, but I haven‚Äôt heard *about* the rumor.

I made the mistake of responding ‚Äúlol‚Äù to an episode of drunk history my sister sent me last week and now she sends me a new episode every single day.
I remember joking about Trump becoming President. Then South Park had to go and make an episode about it. And here we are.
found a new finance tv show called industry. your welcome autists!
I hope you‚Äôre not serious. Medical illiteracy is far too rampant. They get injected with a vaccine or placebo. They go about living their lives. Pfizer (and others) sought out healthcare workers and essential workers bc they were most likely to get exposed. They injected modified mRNA of the virus that would cause our own bodies cells to produce a virus protein and create an antibodies to it. Also, for some this was a chance to get a vaccine early and help science and already passed phase 1 trials so most likely safe. Nobody got injected with anything near covid. So a couple hundred bucks is pretty good.

When looking at BABA you have to consider the following info: ANT IPO, antitrust against monopolies, and it's a "Chinese" company. But here is the thing, nobody cares about antitrust because in reality nobody can do anything about it because BABA literally is so intertwined in everything. It would destroy the stock if this happens, but I find it less then 1% likely. I made 2.5k in calls today (10x 250C 11/13, ya deeeeeep in the money). You would be far better just to trade deep in the money if your so confident and just roll over to the next week if it doesn't go your way, plus your break even is like 278.75 + com fees.

 There are so many paths to financial freedom, but they aren't typically fast and will take many long hours and years to get to a good place.

I calculated and the IV as of closing today is expecting a ~$4.54 move in the positive direction by Nov. 13. Anything below would result in some type of IV crush (depending on actual movement).

Do keep in mind however that being ITM and having intrinsic value could also keep you in the green if it moves enough.
Good advice. Watching stocks is a nice distraction though. I just bought a few BABA leaps, being careful not to chase highs for now at least

How bullish wsb is on NIO means inverse.. 

.. or inverse-the-inverse? Calls it is.
Yes, currently on 3rd rebuild of my account (still positive, but barely) all due to Microsoft 200.  Back in February of 2020. Microsoft 200c for 3/20 were all the rage and this idiot bit wiping out 90% of gains.  Built back up over about 3 months.  The last month of which Microsoft appeared range bound between about 202 and 195.  I see Microsoft at 202 and went all in with gains on a 200p, it then skyrocket up to 211 and stayed there until my weeklies were wiped.  

TLDR. I won't touch MSFT 200 ever again.

As much as I hate the software, Zoom continues to be the leading software all over the world since the outbreak of Covid-19. News of a vaccine was overdelivered by the money-hungry pharmaceutical CEO of Pfizer to fill his pockets and, as a result, ZM stocks were oversold. Reality is that researchers are still working hard to develop a proven and economical vaccine. That is why you are seeing people buying back into ZM.

What do you do if you don‚Äôt mind me asking.
You are fucked if you think that‚Äôs how this works
Idea:  Amazon has warehouses across the US with the shipping logistics to deliver the vaccine away from hospitals where there will be contagious people. Most of their warehouses have open land and are close to airports or sea ports where the military could easily bring in the vaccines in mass.  FedEx and UPS could then be contracted for moving the vaccine to the places Amazon can‚Äôt execute. Amazon already works with the military and the shipping companies.

Why did BYND dip so hard over the past few weeks?
TSM is the shit.

Love TSM, AMD, and NVDA as long holdings. Last big play on TSM was hundreds of JAN 2021 70c bought in Feb before the crash around 1.74 and banked them all between 15.00 and 17.00. Never broke a sweat, this is how sure I was that Intel would completely botch their processes.

I had plenty of both of those contracts (JAN, APR 100c) and offloaded most of them a couple days before earnings, now just have relatively few APR 100c and am short some naked ITM puts, which I'll keep rolling forever to keep long exposure.

Thing about TSM is even when the price looks like its range bound, IV on contracts moves around quite a bit. Buy low...

Full speed ahead on Tech, get your easy wins and then de-lever a little on options.  Watch for some juicy prices on 2021 calls on CNK, DAL, BA, etc as it starts to crater again.  This gave us a good preview of what will pop and what will crash. I expect another pump end of Dec or more probably in Jan/Feb looking into Spring time.

The most covid bearish stat is that with 140k cases a day US mobility trends are still actually above the normal yearly trend line. They were -40% in April.

Also close everything for weekends because liquidity doesn't matter then, except at Sunday at 4PM

Why would you want to hold the day at expiration unless you plan on exercising your contract to buy 100 shares for the strike price? Ideally, you are more profitable when you sell sooner when high IV is present. Also, choosing an expiration date two years out, one would expect to pick a reachable strike with potential upside. 

You buy shares 33x$42 = $1386  Sell at 33x$100= 3300 profit= $1914 that a 138% ROI.

You buy those 65c for $.19 ($19) a contract while the underlying stock price is 42$, and over a year, the price moves to a hypothetical conservative number of $65. Those contracts are probably worth $32 ($3,200 according to the options profit calculator). That's a 16k% ROI.

Why spend $1,386 for $138% ROI when I can spend $19 and get a 16K%ROI. Of course, there are more risks in options but look at the reward.

SPY 3 month chart is telling me it's time to get gaped out by puts again
Was thinking the same. January seems fire.
So are my ccl and aal puts gonna print?
But that should tank the price?
Man I only bought 10 puts instead of 40 spy puts cause I thought I‚Äôd save the rest to average down
Don‚Äôt listen to these assholes. They‚Äôre trying to pump n dump
You mean /r/vegasbets ?

oh yes I do wanna see that chart!
I'll know it when I see it type deal
Smh. Futures down because senators are cashing out before next lockdowns. Limit down tomorrow
I'm considering the same thing, but perhaps closer to march expiration.

If everything keeps mooning I'll sell the house in the spring, and roll profits into market positions, but until then I feel dirty not having short exposure or at least hedging the insane home value increases this year.

I can‚Äôt get over how AMC reported they are selling 20 million shares yesterday. They had $426 million in operating expenses quarter ending 9/30/20 and are selling 20 million shares. At yesterday‚Äôs close that‚Äôs $3.51 x 20M = $70.2M will cover five days of expenses.
Today was the mother of all bull traps. We‚Äôre cucked tomorrow. This is June 11 all over again

Well if we don't get another dip between tomorrow and Friday I'll just sit this one out. Made some killer gains last earnings and still holding shares.
How do I hire you?
Wrinkles=old

Like your wife‚Äôs boyfriend
No but it is almost second nature now.
I really should do this but like you said it won‚Äôt happen
Lmao why tf are you still holding puts bruh it has retard strength
This is what happens when you let too much shit slide.
[deleted]
I've been in downtrends and hit huge spikes when I get lucky. Every time I've traded on that momentum I lose gains and then some
Doing that before close tomorrow is the smart thing to do, I feel like. I own AMD, AAPL, and PTON which each beat earnings in the last 2 wks and yet each of them lost like 5 to 10 percent the next day. Fool me 3 times shame on me, fool me 4 times...won‚Äôt get fooled again.

Edit: it‚Äôs now 4:22 PM EST Thursday and looks like I was right. Now I get to rebuy my shares at a cheaper price tomorrow/next week.
Try not to manifest it

I think you have plenty of time, 2023 is still a long ways away and plenty of quarterly reports. Pltr is a unique company, I‚Äôll just say this though, don‚Äôt expect them to ever get any China contracts.

Look, I never said Trump is going to president. Stop deluding yourself by thinking I did. I was pointing out that there‚Äôs going to be open court cases on safe harbor day and it‚Äôll affect the dec 14th votes.

Today I was thinking about the shit storm that would ensue if Biden died before inauguration
Soros can't spell Gamestop, probably doesn't even know it exists unless a squeeze happens and cost him money somehow.
Copying from my response to someone else:

I quit before the annual raises/performance evaluations, on payday, with no notice, four days after someone else on our small team put in his two weeks. I offered to stay as an off-hours "consultant" to cover the workload while they replaced me and the other guy, but since I'd be doing my job + the other guy's, I demanded double my original pay and said I wouldn't attend any meetings. Boss said management probably wouldn't go for it, I shrugged and said it's all the same to me. Two hours after I leave, I get a call from my boss that management said no to my offer; I was having lunch at my favorite restaurant nearby, eating oysters and already drunk on champagne to celebrate quitting, and said "really? haha wow. good luck."

I checked the company site from time to time; it took them like 6 months to replace me. TBH I feel bad for my teammates because they didn't deserve the added workload, but fuck that company and the people who ran it.
Ahh shit, yah I did.  Computers are hard, man...

That article is amazingly bullish and should worry no one in the near term. They have a plan that requires no high tech equipment that is great news.
Guys the rumor mill is certainly churning about a NIO rumor. I mean to that extent?  At this hour. Why release it now. Congrats call holders
Remember last year when SPY barely fuckin moved

This makes me dislike chamath even more. He has the save the world persona (see that cnbc interview) but sounds just like every tech dude in upper managment-- an absolute prick.

If he really wanted to improve the social aspect of life he can use his "capital" in better ways then to continue taking more from the system.

It's almost like the knife sales types that the sucker the kids into. You hire ten kids who have a background made for a 30 under 30 magazine to gain social lore and establish yourself as a man of the people to sell to those same groups. Sure the 10 people get a small cut of the action but the rest pay 1000 percent more than if they just handed those ten kids the cash equivalent of their pay.
You don't think it'll take a dip after earnings?

What are people really seeing in zoom? They have the most users they will ever be able to get right now and once schools are all back in person they won‚Äôt be able to get new users. I know companies don‚Äôt want to pay for it, for example kpmg uses Microsoft hangouts(free alternative) 
I‚Äôd ride the wave back up to 500 but I‚Äôd take profits at or near 500 if it gets that close again because the first sign that a legitimate vaccine is coming out it will drill again.
NIO couldn‚Äôt possibly be better than we imagined right?  But this rumor is getting me excited. Now that trumps out this nio rumor should send it to the moon and back.  Congrats NIO Longs

If Biden's doctor's opinion gains steam (another nationwide lockdown) it won't be bullish. No way the GOP will shell out another 3 trillion dollars of money. They might go up to 1 trillion but that's not enough for what Biden seems to want. It would destroy any recovery we've had so far.
You are rumoured to have aids
There‚Äôs no rumor the dude saying shit is being vague and is just trying to drive call holders nuts for the next 11 hours
Nah it just freaked out and went down for a bit, which is good I can now save those videos. I just worry I'll come back to a favorite video and it'll disappear.

I shorted the stock going into earnings and lost.  Here is my hot retard take.  Spent about ten hours of reading about taco.  Two C suite or board members bought in the high $8 range.  Their stores are west coast and the wild fires and covid have crushed their dining room sales, but any company with a drive thru isn‚Äôt going bankrupt or seeing huge downside of stock price.  

If you check my history I am a huge Taco Bell guy.  Del Taco is likely to come out of covid very strong and will likely expand into the Midwest and compete with Taco Bell.  Stock could double in two years, but I would rather bank money in other stocks.

I was early when it would hit the ATH, but nailed the price...

The problem is 80% of their revenue comes from product sales not subscriptions...  in order to hit their crazy forecasted revenue they need to sell a ton of bikes/treads etc... their supply chain management is weak... they have positives too, I think at $100 it‚Äôs pretty fairly priced... but honestly this is more of an $80 stock for me

The tuition problem needs to be discussed and solved before loan forgiveness or we‚Äôre just going to be having this conversation again in 10 years. Make public universities free (or largely free) and make student loans bankruptable and deniable. Stop the flow of free cash and tuition will stop ballooning. Nobody should be borrowing (or loaning) huge sums of cash for a degree with no chance of paying off that debt.
Does non traditional background mean a degree outside of finance or just a retail trader?

word? You make me want to look up the science behind it. Also kinda mind blown. I've never tried burping on command since I only did it intentionally when trying to force the hiccups out. It's impossible to explain to people how to do it except like..mentally imagine it and center your thoughts on your guts.

So if today I buy a 01/20/2023 65c for $19 premium, then for example when the underlying is $70/share... the EV and IV will be substantially less than the premium paid, right?

 If the underlying goes to $100 at expiration, then Delta would be at essentially even money. So I profited $21 a share. ($2100)

I could make nearly the same money by going long 33 shares today at $42 and selling at $100.($1900 profit) without risking the entire wager to expiring worthless if it trades flat or down.

Have I got this completely wrong?

What I've learned is that what happens to a stock 5 seconds after I "invest" is a FANTASTIC indicator of whether it was a good investment.
damn, sounds like your grandma has a pH of 14
I mean, you're either right or wrong, so there's nothing with taking a chance if you truly believe it will continue. My concern is that without some kind of catalyst (i.e. continued wealth inequality + free-time + open money) this will lose juice. If it were me I'd deep OTM put straddle with an ATM call for the future, long 6+ mos.
Hopium is a helluva drug.

Going to hold PLUG a little longer.
The fact that everyone is saying this has me feeling very comfortable holding through earnings tomorrow. You don‚Äôt think the big boys know this ‚Äúsell off‚Äù sentiment and are gonna cook those puts alive? That‚Äôs truly why the ‚Äúinverse WSB‚Äù meme works more often than it doesn‚Äôt. I could be wrong (certainly wouldn‚Äôt be the first time), but everyone is so certain that it‚Äôs gonna sell off that I bet it moons past $20.

They keep your spit from flying. Simple logic home boy
Right? And recently (as referenced) on The Queen's Gambit (NFLX) as Beth Harmon.
Lending Club...connecting people who shouldn't be given loans...with greedy people who expect absurd returns for giving micro loans to their "peers".

There's two types of accounts at LC: 1) Investor 2) Borrower

The borrower applies for a loan on LC's website.
Investors get to pick the loans they want to fund, and the amount they want to fund.  Minimum note is $25.
When a loan is fully funded by a bunch of investors, the money gets sent to the borrower and LC services the loan.  They collect payments and call the borrower if they miss a payment.  Meanwhile, the investors sit back and wait for cash payments to show up each month.  

LC makes money on the loan origination fee.  LC screened the borrowers credit and rated them accordingly.  Investors could pick the grade of borrowers (A thru H), where A-grade borrowers had really good credit and  very low interest rates.  H were probably prisoners with internet access, and max legal interest rate.  The only thing the investor can see is the purpose for the loan and occupation.
Hell yeah Go Beavs

I don't hate shorts. You're just stupid if you think that's an optimal. Way to manage money. If you have ANY amount of fun doing this, sure, do that. I don't do this for fucking fun.

why would any insider care about holding a shit-ton of their company's stock, and then keeping it long-term?

they don't control the markets, and it's blatantly obvious that market performance does not necessarily correlate with company performance

so what's the point?

legal issues aside, insider trading is just them doing what every other trader is trying to do: turn a profit, using whatever edge they can get

2 main reasons- constrained equity holdings set by the board (aka governing why the CEO can't just own a fuckton of stock and then pump it up just to sell, ethics, etc)  


and the 2nd reason- in that position you wouldn't ever want to do something so egregious that it appears that you're manipulating the stock for a massive personal gain. typically you'd cap it to where it's not an amount that would raise too many eyebrows. Rumors of unethical behavior in a CEO position of a publicly traded company can get you ousted quickly.

Yer me neither. I actually got in at 293 a couple of days ago, could of done a day trade when it hit 300 intraday but I saw it going higher with singles day coming and some of the bad news behind it (Ant, earnings sell off) and then this china shit hit it, and then the broad market sold off too. Talk about getting gang banged. 

It's actually held up quite well given it's circumstances. If we can get past this, I have no doubt it'll eventually get back up to 310+ It's just a matter of how much time you have on options.
Nice play. Autistic. So I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll print.

Offering was priced higher than that,  I got burned really bad when Tilray did their offering back in March.  Shit screams to short it and then it spikes.  It should go back to 5 or lower since they are diluting but it also shouldn‚Äôt have recovered in the back half of the day either.

What's the deal with Del Taco? I heard some twitter types talking it up. Is it a value play based on a prolonged recession that causes people to flee CMG for cheaper fare? Or is there $1 menu that good?
It's pretty simple. The more people are talking about it the more likely it's gona dip. Everyone buying calls right now gona create a big short interest while if everyone buying puts creates a great squeeze opportunity. Snap pins gme and even tesla, all great examples. Therefore, all in nio. üòÉ

Sell.  Zm already dropped 25% and is now going back up.  Vaccine news on Monday was only good for a 2 or 3 day pop then everyone realized NOTHING HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED YET! ZM is a covid stock and covid is still here and will be nasty until spring.  Everyone is also realizing that even though Vaccine is effective it required special storage at -80.  No one has that special equipment right now.

WFH was a trend that definitely pre-existed covid and I agree it probably would've done well and grown in the future regardless. 

But you can't justify the market cap and P/E ratio for a video calling app which does nothing than put two cameras together. Nevertheless, I do agree it's going back up, not because it deserves to and their is a good business case to make for it, but because it's a retarded market with a lot of irrational exuberance.
It absolutely is!  Thanks for commenting
sell
 they have software that can watch video and audio and do a lot with it which is hot as shit right now. Problem with that is only the best software wins and I can't assess that. Probably calls and not shares. Might be skynet though so I'll throw something at it after assessing open.

Got NKLA $19P today, what you think????
Trading won't get you to where you need to be. It's not supposed to be a main source of income. I recommend turning into a welfare queen until you get a job.
I feel like this is a joke. But I'll bite.   Sell that!   Zoom isn't likely to drop that much.  Florida is currently experiencing a housing crunch because all of the companies that are sticking with telework and people can now live in beach communities while working for their companies located elsewhere. 

If you suck at WSBetting, then try r/investing for a while.

That's a dangerous game
I bet if trump kept his mouth shut he would have won this election
Logically yes. But Xi had been making moves that are contrary to opening up the market. Desperately clinging to power the guy is trying to retain control and kicking down prominent figures in the country is one method. He also references Mao in his public appearance as that is the model be wants China to be. I mean look at HK.

"In comparison to Macs, the single-core performance is better than any other available Mac, and the multi-core performance beats out all of the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro models, including the 10th-generation high-end 2.4GHz Intel Core i9 model. That high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro earned a single-core score of 1096 and a multi-core score of 6870."

That's for the new MacBook Air. If they can pull off the transition, Intel is fucked.

I mean the way to go would be a call spread to minimize theta. But due to his time frame as next year a straddle would be good cause you'll profit regardless of if your right on the direction. Just needs to move substantially which if it's a year down the road is pretty likely if he's playing leaps.

Neither of these articles claim they are far off from distribution. Also The cold chain issue is mostly clickbait.

Before January, Spy is either going to 400 or 320. I'm not really sure which one, but its going to move big regardless.

Also, there won't be a big sell off for tax reasons. We are safe from tax increases until at least 2022.

From my understanding  locking up shares by limit selling them, that stops the short sellers from being able to borrow your shares. The more we can lock up, the faster and harder the squeeze.

Hmm, I'm out of the market because I locked in profits and a SL took me out yesterday. Try not to let a winner turn into a loss, lock something in...if tomorrow NASDAQ is accelerating better than today I will enter...my gut feeling it will, but just lock some profits in bro.

Market makers will still profit, they just will be extremely picky and only bet when it‚Äôs very profitable.  Now market makers might be able to quote a market 0.05% wide but they would have to widen out substantially.  Realistically they‚Äôre not going to make a market 0.45% wide, they‚Äôll probably start at 1% wide.  So any time big investors come into the market it will probably move prices a lot more more than we see now.  

High frequency shops will go under because scalping isn‚Äôt profitable anymore.

Many of these positions that I had been waiting to get out from under and holding serious bags. These are they: CCL, BA, AAL, TGI, CNK, MCS, AMC, ESRT, DRH, SBH, PK, BLMN, DENN and a few more. Sure some ran higher after I sold but All of them have tanked since I passed the bags along. I am Very proud of myself and I didn‚Äôt lose money which is most important.

Anyone see Barbarians on Netflix. It's pretty dope.
These LEAPs on NIO are relatively expensive. IMO you're getting ripped off at these prices. Paying ~50% of share value is a ton for an option, even if the expiry is 800 days away. In comparison, look at some of the same dated LEAPs on SPY. You're paying around 10-15% of share value (around $39) for the same expiry.

You wanna look at IV Rank and IV Index to gauge the relative price of an option over the past year.

It has gone up an insane amount lately but if hydrogen really continues to pick up adoption, its current price is undervalued. Personally hoping for a pullback because I exited most of my position in the middle of this run up and want to get back in. I think $30 is a total possibility in 6 months.

Rooting for futures is peak smooth brain
/ES moved up to 3550 on Sunday. Monday we had the big green dildo from that level then faded and closed at that same price point. Tuesday selling pressure filled Sunday‚Äôs gap at open and buyers stepped in. Melted back up over 3550 today and tested it as support 3 times now and buyers stepped in again. IMO really bullish looking to get over 3590 then 3640. Red doesn‚Äôt matter if it can‚Äôt break below 3500. Short 350p and waiting to get a move up to get 364c
I'm closing most of my calls before earnings. Might let one ride, but I'm not even sure about that. Doesn't sound like earnings will be good.
You might not rebalance it all at once but you‚Äôre going to rebalance it all probably at least once per year.  So regardless of whether you rebalance it all at once or in piecemeal, you‚Äôre still paying the same in taxes.
Sir this is a Arby‚Äôs
That's not even how arguments work. If Mises and Rothbard say "X" and I point out that A, B, C, D... P all contradict them, that's not me presenting an argument. It's simply me pointing out that they're wrong, not arguing any position except "not their position."

The management already knows the 3Q quarter result. 

Justin Dopelara (DOMO Capital), who right now have 6 million shares, is saying that their QoQ online sales growth is probably flat, which is great, considering that the stores reopened.

Also, a consulting agency said today that last quarter was the best one for video games EVER.
The most sure thing is it'll run up to earnings. Sell right before earnings close but hold a gambling position that'll print heavily if it rockets upwards.

I had a 5k total position that I trimmed down to under 1k because the premiums were too juicy to not sell

BABA calls. This ordeal with the CCP will blow over. The CCP would be dumb to really screw BABA over because then other businesses/ entrepreneurs would seek to leave China and do business elsewhere.

They are just trying to do something similar to what we‚Äôre doing in the US by having the tech CEOs grilled on the Hill. The CCP just wants to make it look like they‚Äôre tough on big business, too, but they won‚Äôt derail BABA‚Äôs growth completely.

In a alternative timeline, Pfizer ceo didn‚Äôt pull a dick move and announce vaccine news on a Monday morning before market open and spy/chasdaq had a nice steady climb this week with Biden confirming a win and the senate staying the same thus throwing another uncertainty out the window for the market

The worst though is when you were sooo close to pulling the trigger and don't, and as you review what happened after later, you realize you nearly bought pretty much the exact bottom of the falling knife and would've made a retarded amount.

It's different when it's like "oh SQ went up a lot. I like SQ. I'm an idiot for missing that" vs. "I was a click away from that" or "I chased that up and gave up".

That said, the actual worst is holding on to something thinking it'll gain more and it goes down the tubes, so taking gains is important.
Boys, heed this advice or shiver thee tendies.

The last two times we topped out in 350s, we started drilling back to 320s right away. This time is different because we've still been holding onto 350s. If we don't drill below 350 by the end of this week, we are good.

Nah I of course i didn't have the "A" rating folks. Those payout like 0.5%    i mostly did middle of the road at the C loan level. Even with occasion defaults as expected, payout in prosper was about 8-11% annual. I wouldn't really call that absurd returns. Keep in mind I had been running with prosper for about 3 years and have lending club a go for 3 years. Slightly negative return over all 3 years at lending club. F dat.
maybe idk tho it might be overvalued cause keep in mind it hasn‚Äôt made a profit yet is valued the 6th biggest car company. but idk you do you it might take off to 50

so my pltr calls are fucked?
Think I might let some of these NIO 40c execute.  Wouldn't mind holding for a few more months.
Yikes
chick on Queens Gambit
8/not very often :(/mind your fucking business
DE and PG because they've broken trend and completed a pretty heavy back-test.

JPM, because it has no business over $104 in this market, also it can't close above resistance at $116.

Strangle on SPY because I don't trust that sonofabitch.

Switching my DIA calls to puts tomorrow for the same reason I'm in puts on PG and DE.  Also gonna be picking up LOW puts soon.

Seeing topping ALL over the market going since late August when we started this sideways channeling bullshit.
Then pay for tradeview
I think tech stands to be gaining. Dow might not as reality sets in that the vaccine will still take a while to get out there and a lot of these recovery stock companies will be zombies at best by then.

At this point, imma need 2 days like that.
not enough red tho...
I would say she‚Äôs very unattractive. All that plastic surgery and she still looks like the dumbest cunt ever.
All I want for tomorrow is TSLA to drop 10%.
But mom said it's our turn with ZM ):
Intel got woke and went broke, all in on amd
If I had money, I'd be more depressed along up this early every day. Fortunately, my account blew up enough that I don't need to worry now.

Hi all thanks for reading. We‚Äôre an all-female founded newsletter start up company. Today we received a job app for a Jennifer Toobin - says here she worked at the NEW YORKER for 27 years!! We‚Äôre so excited that we can‚Äôt seem to hold it in!!

Eat a bat see what happens
I‚Äôm selling covered calls just above it‚Äôs 50 day moving avg
ZM as well. Scalped a nice gain from that today.
Double down probably like true autists.
mmm, i dont know about that, i think palantir has a huge probability of becoming a large data processing company, but that‚Äôs even longer term than a long option so you autists wouldn‚Äôt give too much a fuck about it

How about this : bulls get ZM until 10:30am, bears get the rest of the day
Any chance baba reaches back to 295 by end of month ?

I‚Äôm not an economist but sacrificing the dollar to pump up equities seems scary.

Like the prices only? How is that going bro?
Fucking awesome dude, way to go! Also exited my positions throughout the late half of the day, but today. I had 02/2021's that were up between 170-200% when I was exiting. I've been burned too many times day before\of earnings. Actually got a few puts i'm excited about aswell. I really like PLTR and would like to play it long, but not playing these obvious catalysts is just leaving money on the table. How anyone can be bullish about tomorrow for them is beyond me
Does that actually work? Snopes? Snopes??
-2% day tomorrow my puts are gonna print so hard
Just keep holding on. One day, when our 50k losses finally break out into a 12k gain, we can say "I told you."
There was a limit on how much they could sell even with the DL

I need to get myself a nice momentum screener, what do you guys use?
I think selling naked is illegal.

But you're right in the rest.
Ironically there's truth to this. The higher the Dow goes the less likely we get a big stim package even though wall street is not main Street
Who else here is holding ZM puts?
So true you bring up your dad. I talk to my dad about plays all the time and he tells me to just fucking hold. Each time I‚Äôve gone against what he‚Äôs said and panic-sold it ends up being a multibagger in the end if I just could have had diamond hands!
He always has said to avoid them only because they're not paying him anything
So does having kids make me exponentially more valuable? Is it like passive income?

That‚Äôs what I thought lol thanks bro
I feel just as shitty as ever so no reason to get tested
What strike
you know the drill. Green by open
Buy the rumor sell the news.
Who‚Äôs playing DIS for earnings tomorrow?
Let‚Äôs make some money tomorrow
Alien invasion
I haven‚Äôt but I didn‚Äôt realize it was not limited to just YouTube. That‚Äôs very troubling that the outage was that widespread. Massive failures on multiple levels had to occur for that to happen.
The two hundred thousand dollar stock lol...bow
Yeah I am not using them lol nothing online?
Isn‚Äôt Ford like $5 per share?
If tomorrow is red, then Friday will also be red. Triple top. Drilling to earths core. The crazy part is that tomorrow won‚Äôt be red because this will be green by open, and my puts won‚Äôt print.
Idk where my other comment went but its mainly ptsd from sexual assaults.

Bro what are you talking about I‚Äôve been on the internet all night
SPY $7 by open.
We have nearly 11 million cases but many estimates say that the actual number of cases is 5-10x the reported cases which would put us anywhere between 55 million and 110 million which means anywhere from 1/3rd and 1/6th of the US population already got the virus.
Get a grip
Really sorry to hear this. I hope you‚Äôre both feeling better tomorrow.
Ticker strike and date then pls
Don‚Äôt look so autistic now. Try again.
Maybe I‚Äôm gay.

Has anyone been able to find an article about the major internet outage that just happened? It wasnt just youtube, it was like half the consumer focused internet/services: https://downdetector.com/

From my perspective as a cyber security analyst, this isnt an instance of "oh, looks like AWS/centralized services shit the bed". Anyone able to find anything about it? Sort of odd no news articles yet when it started 4 hours ago and ended 1 hour ago for most.

The thing that cracks me up about people freaking out about storage at -70C is that dry ice is -78C. I can get dry ice at a local grocery store. Most, if not all, hospitals have dry ice machines.
Yeah...a hold isn't a bad idea...I think people realize now its overpriced and are putting their money in other sectors.
Looks like BABA technical support around 253-258. So we might go lower than where we are now. It's oversold by some measures and I'm holding DEC calls and shares but I admit I don't comprehend the extent of what the Chinese government is doing, how far it might drop or stagnate from that.

Interesting if true, but with less than 1/10th the production of TSLA and cars as its only real product, I fail to understand how they are 1/10th the size by market cap without being profitable. At a similar point in TSLA's history it was worth less than a 1/5th what NIO is valued at right now and everyone and their mother was crying for its blood.
This and the release of PS5 and Xbox is going to be interesting. Hopefully the short squeeze happens

If you're trading and green, absolutely.

If you're long a stock, its not a good idea. You ignore the gyrations.

You will note that every mega growth/mega speculative stock on a zoomed out timeline puts in these upward legs that, but for weird, flukey events like 2007 or COVID, they don't go back under again and henceforth that represents a new floor. A lot of those permanent legs up are earnings day and there are a lot of retards who sold right before then and 'waited for a better entry point' who just wound up missing the train completely.
only down .25% lmao this is green by morning
Lol I also didn‚Äôt really believed in it but it kind of does lol i use it to help me to be more confident when I find a play
Lmao -0.30% and y‚Äôall acting like WW69 is about to happen

do you understand how much enterprise's spend on moving their shit to the cloud?  or how much they spend on having their shit operate in the cloud? guess what.. they dont give a fuck about how much it costs. companies spend a shit ton of money moving to the cloud because they dont care. its a perfect subscription based model that for these large cloud computing companies make bank off of. companies will spend whatever it takes to be able to say (sell) that their shit runs on the cloud. operational expenses vs capital expenses is ultimately what it comes down to. servers are fucking expensive to maintain operate anyways

If you can put together some good projects showcasing you know what you're doing, it could work. When I first started in the field, having a CS degree still meant something. These days I think it means way less and just being able to showcase projects and knowledge goes a long way.

If you want to go the JS route, you should learn some of the popular frameworks as well as the language itself. React is very popular and has great tutorials. Express is another one. Node.js is also important. JQuery isn't quite as popular these days but is good to know. I'm still getting back up to speed but those are some good entry points.

I can‚Äôt believe I sold PLUG at $4 a share
Not suggesting anyone commit bankruptcy fraud.

But I would suggest storing the value in a non cash hard to trace store of value.  Perhaps one would buy a few thousand dollars worth of Walmart gift cards, Best Buy gift cards, and other gift cards.  These can be sold for a percentage of value after you have been granted a discharge of debtor.

Further,  there are lots of loopholes that allow student loan to be dischargeable.  It happens more often than you think.  Some jurisdictions have law school programs that let law students go in and just fight with student loans at adversary proceedings.

after 6 months and several meetings, phone calls, etc. i just got it like a week ago.
then i got a notice that if i close the acct within 6 months they take the bonus back!

if its anything like that, check the terms and conditons for recieving the bonus, i.e. maintaining acct balance minimums, duration.
 those corkstuffers have a million ways to wiggle out of it.

wat rotation?
I‚Äôm not of that opinion. But look how high it is now, vs the year chart based upon QE. Hmmm. Jobs, unemployment benefits about to expire. No Stim. Many businesses about to go under. Housing loan crisis looming. Moratorium expiring for evictions. Things will be odd. Add a US President compromising national security, doing unprecedented things and also a pandemic about to kill a whole lot of people. Hard to say what will tip it off and how low it will go; but there‚Äôs nothing to justify the current bull run aside deregulation and shift to obsolescence of other industries and relying on tech. They said: I‚Äôve made a bunch of money off calls. Tis what it is.
The "system" is going to make an exception for COVID because so many people are impacted by it.  People who had their houses foreclosed during the global financial crisis in 2008 were able to get loans in less than 7 years.  "Forgiveness of debt" was the thing to do; just pay the taxes on the forgiven debt and it all goes away.  It will happen again.

Didn't Trump say they'd have something very soon in like June....
No it mooned on the pfe announcement monday. It will drop everyday back to whatever price it was last Friday. Hold until then.
Big bois love it! Rinse/repeat.
What was the peak?
These are the warning attempts to help people understand the danger we are in if we can't control the rate of spread and hospitalizations.
Hmm what pfizer just found out about this vaccine before, like idk a week or 2, but the ceo knew his date was so close so pfizer just postponed the announcement so it would time with the sale of the shares? Because back like in august the ceo said he will sell his shares at nov 9 provided the share price was at least x amount due to the regulations.
I have a 12/18 13c that is up 27% but I know that vega bitch IV crush is out to get me once the ER is out. Probably should have sold, now I just hope the danm thing moons and IV doesn't matter.

The longer the date, the better...  11/20 too close to expect a Market drop by then, if any... Markets probably gonna remain high for awhile longer on election and vaccine pump, imo; so mid Dec VXX calls if you can swing it, Covid rates after Thanksgiving should be through the roof by then....

I have been programming off and on making tools for my restaurant. I love voice assistants and enhancing their functionality for business-specific use cases. Once my restaurant is closed for good at the end of the month, I'll be applying to entry level dev and testing positions at food related tech companies since I have insight on restaurant-specific problems. Leverage your other skills and interests.

Creating projects and posting them to GitHub is a great way to show employers what you can do, especially if you don't have a degree in tech. Develop something that solves a problem you see in your day to day life or something that may help others. Even if it is an app that already exists, it can be a helpful exercise to try to do it yourself. At the very least it will give you an appreciation for how difficult it can be to make even a simple program that is actually useful and doesn't break every 5 seconds.

I don't understand this narrative. Elon and fanboys literally hate shorters and seem to think they're trying to undermine the company.

I made the mistake of trying to trying to short tsla recently. But I fucking love Elon.  He has some flaws, but he's easily my favorite CEO and I love that he shoots for the moon. I'm also a fan of Tesla and I think it'd be awesome for the world if they succeed.

It just seemed greatly overvalued at the time, so I thought it was a good opportunity to make money, or at least act as a hedge for my other optimistic investments.

I stand by what I said there. Definitely a bit morbid, but yeah.

Everyone's aware of the virus. Your article doesn't seem to mention people saying they had no idea it was real, or that it is deadly. Rational, cautious people will take steps to keep themselves safe, while others will take risks and hurt themselves and others. Some people who make the wrong choices, or come into contact with people who make the wrong choices, will die. It's a form of natural selection. There's definitely a lot of unnecessary grief, and of course some people are dying through no fault of their own, but the majority of these people had the knowledge to protect themselves if they so chose.

And it won't get out of hand. I don't see anything in that article about the ICU being so over capacity that patients are getting subpar treatment or being kept in hallways. There are a lot of cases there, but it seems manageable, and even in a place like Texas, it will not explode into an outbreak that kills millions.

I don't really like the government babying people and idiot-proofing society. I would prefer them to stand back and not take action unless there's actually a chance of portions of our society completely collapsing. They projected that this virus wouldn't even wipe out 1% of the population if left completely unchecked, and our country would definitely still be standing in the event that happened.
lmao finally it dawns on pepole that covid isn't gonna go running to the hills when the "trial" news broke out

All the articles were saying 50 million doses max by the end of this year. That just isn't enough.
Its a glorified FaceTime.  Thats all it is.  People will sell and take profits as they already have...dumping this.  If I didn't have all of my money invested right now I'd place puts 11/27 at 390.

Since the thing we‚Äôre measuring value with has gone down, the price should go up to accommodate that drop making it neutral as far as the asset is a store of value.

Stock price goes up is bullish.
Man how much longer can the market deny these covid numbers? Getting out of control
Out of the 100 largest companies thriving prior to 1900, only 15 of them still exist (this accounts for mergers and acquisitions considering the company to still existing).

The implication of this fact is that, over the course of ~100 years, there's an 85% chance a company will go down 100%.

You can half-life that number out if you'd like, but 50-50 probably happens within a retirement's period of time.

Too obvious. Thats not how the market works. It may be crazy overvalued but it wont drop bigly until every bear gives in. You know the saying "if you don't know who the dumb money at the table is it's probably you?".

Well...
Didnt he announce this like fucking months ago?
my 11/13 calls for 46c, So I might have to just except I'm gonna be fucked If I've got to sell Wednesday

So a downward dollar and upward stock is bearish, as you have to lower stock value accordingly? Is that a stupid conclusion to arrive to?
First, anyone on this sub holding shares needs to lock those up. Limit sell at a ridiculous price. Also all the dumdums buying weekly calls, stop wasting your money. Jump on the share wagon and hold. If the shorts cant get shares, we win.
The ceo can never get away with selling on the news üòÇ trust me they would investigate him.
Is there anything in particular about development that excites you or you just want a job? There's tons of different directions to take.
This also depends on what the market/that sector doing the week after earnings. Too risky plus IV crush killing the premiums. I always sell 1-2 days before earnings.
I almost did yesterday too. But two days of green with a down trend I thought was a good entry. We‚Äôll see though.
Yes

There's a lot you can do. Web development is the most clear one. Check out Node.js to see how much is out there for server-side stuff with JavaScript. 

I've been out of software for 8 years (started my own restaurant) but am getting back in the game now because COVID wiped my business out. I was mainly web dev in my career and it is nice to see JavaScript is even stronger than it was back then. I still have a lot of catching up to do.

Sell and place calls on CAPR.  News and earnings call 11/12.  Vaccine is better than BNTX.  Read trials for effectiveness  and no adverse effects. Will be the top vaccine.  Pfizer has acknowledged BNTX is far off from distribution with no results of long term effects.  CAPR will take the lead.  Also buy IBIO January 2022 $2c.  IBIO will be one if not the one manufacturing any vaccine due to the size of its manufacturing plant in Texas.

The average value of a human life in the United States over the course of a working life is 9.1 million dollars.  You lost $7k and it seems like a lot because you're in that moment, right here and now.  You lost it because you traded on emotional plays instead of following a gameplan.  Killing yourself here is just repeating that same mistake, and trading in a lost 7k for a lost 9.1 million.  

That's a more retarded trade than any fucking idiot on this subreddit has ever posted. 

Take a break to cool off, learn from your mistakes, work hard for now and come up with a gameplan for tomorrow morning.  Doesn't have to be complicated - getting out of bed, taking a shower, and getting dressed is enough.  While you're taking that shower, think about what your next move for tomorrow is - maybe clean up the place and take out the trash.  Keep doing that for a week and you'll get through this.

Honestly, you have it exactly backwards. You long as a hedge. A gambling subreddit should be shorting, because red days tend to be way bigger red (-3-5%) than green days tend to be green (1-2%). It continues to confuse me how this subreddit--mostly made of idiots buying lottos--disparages Bears. If you're looking for a 10 bagger, you should be buying puts. Unless you are buying leaps or investing...in which case, why are you here?

You're in luck!  It's 2020.  The loan officers in the future are going to ignore any credit dings during the COVID era - because a good portion of the population has credit problems right now.  Just ignore it and it will go away.

Maybe nobody in your eyes is different than mine. Banks will ab-so-fucking-lutly "sweat you". You'll get shitty credit card offers, possibly have some cancelled (amex is notorious for this if your score drops low enough). Want a mortgage, nope definitely not a conventional, maybe an FHA IF it stays above 640. Also insurance premiums... So many things get effected.. Credit hits for defaulting on a loan last 7 years.  And all these things i mentioned are automated processes, the systems they use don't make exceptions for the "COVID era". Thinking any different is just plain wrong.

Educated populations tend to do better. The more access to education a population has, the better educated it generally is. 

When you don‚Äôt prioritize education you end up with a population of people that thinks masks don‚Äôt spread infection and jfk is coming back from the dead to take on pedophile cabals. 

It is my belief that we should be prioritizing higher education at the same rate other developed nations are if we are to compete with them in the future. That said, I don‚Äôt think the government should pay for it but something definitely needs to be done to make it more affordable and obtainable for more people. We seem to regard certain institutions as prestigious and as such we pile the highest paying kids into them because it just becomes a supply and demand equation for the school but the other aide of that coin is you limit the number of educated in your population to how many those limited institutions can process in a given time. That made sense up until recently when technology made transmitting information in real time easier. Imo everyone should get an advanced education even if they are doing some stupid plumber shit with your life. Our entire population could benefit from knowing additional languages and having brains that are regularly exercised and trained to think critically. A big problem in our society now is that a large group of people figured out they don‚Äôt have to think at all to eat and survive and now you just can‚Äôt teach those morons shit.

I run a simulation, a $100 into NASDAQ-100 inflation adjusted back to 1980, buy and hold strategy, at start of 2018 your total capital invested in today's money about 30k, balance in account in today's money 0.5mil (aprox numbers as I'm doing this from memory). So biggest thing you got lad is time, do buy and hold and you will be fine, gamble what you can afford to loose amd if you hit a mother load cash out.

I dont and thats after googling for a while. Coldest I found is -50... Although I read that they will use dry ice and thermal containers... so as long as there is dry ice surrounding it or within the container, I think it will be sufficient and the need for large freezers wont be necessary. I think dry ice and thermal containers could be a play.... but definitely the vials for all of these companies thats why I am playing GLW

Was honestly kinda drunk for my meeting and the people I met had no idea. Was one of my better meeting performances in a long time. Will do more often.

I have been buying shares of DKNG as it tanked, I see this going over $70 share price but it is soooo levered to pro sports being open. If you have a long time horizon this one pays off.

Sell enough to make back your capital/maybe a little more/less. Tomorrow is gonna be a big run up before earnings, Earnings is anyone's bet though.
DB trying to push 5% additional income tax on those that have the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of working from home. ‚ÄúCould raise additional $48B a year‚Äù 

Like using your own utilities and having to upgrade everything at home is not taxing enough. 

I think DB is over leveraged in commercial and trying to push people back to work in the office. Idk why else they would even mess around with policies and taxes. 

TLDR: PUTS on DB

It's a bike that tracks calorie intake overtime, you have[ TWENTY ONE separate digital bike instructors of all races and sexes](https://www.onepeloton.com/instructors/bike). You can brag on social media and there's even levels like a video game. There's thousands of classes, HD speakers, HD video. You can check your heart rate, get custom meters of neat stuff, it's also basically a tablet, it has a browser, it has custom apps, youtube, netflix. Nigga you can trade stocks on it using the robinhood browser mode while you get slim. Not only that the parts are state of the art AND mostly made in usa/taiwan so you're indirectly pissing off the CCP while buying a bike. It also comes in treadmill version. The versions are upgradable via trade in and has very affordable financing.
Because PLTR own projections don‚Äôt match that valuation. The fact that you guys keep referencing catalysts that didn‚Äôt move the stock whatsoever on the dates the news was actually released. Was just a dumb election pump because ‚ÄúdEeP sTaTe StOcK‚Äù and hasn‚Äôt snapped back to reality yet. Earnings will be that reality.

It‚Äôs a good long play.
Then it‚Äôs a no.
Why
Dw man. Im 21, and i lost about 27k so far. Most of it is from my own money.
Hold PLTR through earnings or dump?
Hey man, no amount of money is worth that. I've had big swings too. But in reality, it's just money. You can overcome 7k even though it seems insurmountable.

My advice: step away, talk to someone, and when it's time to return, if at all, start with small wagers on call/put spreads to build an account.

This is good advice.
You can't buy a ticket to the moon with SPCE either, their "space tourism" is a glorified vomit comet for rich people
Id recommend not buying in until a pull back.  I doubt it will get that low again but it is due for a decent dip.

I also have no idea what I'm doing
The Fed cannot and will not raise the FFR until at least 2420.

Frankly, those professions require learning technical skills and honing one‚Äôs thinking over long periods of time. They‚Äôre not the best professions for generating wealth unless you have parents paying for them, and even then the opportunity cost of that money needs to be taken into account. They‚Äôre not professions that should be pursued lightly. They take a ton of work and passion, and you need to excel within your cohort to make a ton in those professions.  I think it‚Äôs a problem that our education system so blindly paints highly educated professions as the main road to success when most lawyers earn less than jobs that take much less education like software engineering or plumbing. I think it‚Äôs due to a lack of creativity and knowledge on the parts of teachers and our society on the whole. How many lawyers do you know in major debt with relatively low paying jobs? I know a number. The solution is fewer lawyers and more people in professions that have a higher impact on society with less education, not to have the government pay for everyone to become a lawyer.
And when they re-upload it YouTube it going to go down again..? Don't be a dumbass.

It's somewhat of a moot point since Lending Club closed their doors to P2P lending, for abundantly obvious reasons - but walking away from a P2P loan is like a non-moving traffic violation.  Yes, it will show up on your record - but it's 2020.  Half the population defaulted on their loans in 2020.  Nobody is going to sweat you about a bad debt during the COVID era.

Me, I was just scalping the swings back and forth to 300 after the ant ipo got scuttled. Got caught on the overnight - China announced new ‚Äúregulation‚Äù possibility‚Äôs. Bobs my uncle.

I think China is going to be more muscular than normal with the power vacuum of USA asleep at the mango splattered wheel at the moment. 

That‚Äôs my only nerves.

I made a [reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jselhw/yes_grandpa_dump_those_bonds_and_buy_tsla_calls/gbzulp8) to another comment elaborating on this, but it actually makes sense since TSLA's valuation is based on Elon's ability to achieve the goals he promised.

Options are freedom, they give you the power to break into the next level of society even if you‚Äôre god-dam lower-lower class flipping burger at Wendy‚Äôs. You might lose your shirt and Timmy may go hungry, but that‚Äôs the inherent risk that comes with investing.

Life should be worth living if you‚Äôre alive, and options breath life into those of us who are trapped in poverty.

Sell pltr shares before earnings and buy dip or hold?
Betting on TSLA is, at least to a certain extent, betting on Elon. He has a 10 year growth plan for Tesla that will make them worth substantially more than their current price if executed perfectly, with their valuation based on a 2 year trajectory towards that path. Priced into that trajectory is uncertainty about his ability to execute, since it requires compounded technological innovation and will miss the mark by a huge margin if it misses. Successfully leading another company to achieve a different difficult technological feat lowers uncertainty about his ability to do the same with Tesla, since despite being different companies with different goals, they have similar technological ambition.
Yeah it works fine

My big issue was emotional trading and compulsively trading.  Speculation was taking up a lot of my time, and I would be obsessed with not missing out on anything.  Then I would get bummed / pissed when I got out of a trade before expiration with a loss when if I held I would have made money.  This strategy is a set it and forget it investing method.  I know I could make more money actively trading, but I also know I could lose a lot more money and days off my life with the stress I was putting myself under.  But different things work for different mindsets, that's what makes trading so interesting.
You're a freak retard that should see a therapist

Well, he made me enough that I probably owe him one. Waymo got acquired by Google, but not exactly a small company anymore. Plenty of companies are working on autonomy, but combined have less than 10% of the miles of data Tesla has, and their lead is widening.  Like I replied to someone else just now, there will be select cities other companies try competing in, but the lion's share of that $2 trillion from autonomy is pretty much guaranteed to Tesla.

Do you have any insight into what would cause them to have a favorable earnings report? I'm ashamed to say, I haven't kept up as much as I should despite both selling a PUT and owning some stock in them.

Increasing social media buzz (which I log and quantify) is what drove my NIO trades as it tends to correlate with short term gains. I'd like to know more about how the company is actually doing though.
Because basically everything else has for the last six months except snap and salesforce
I sold everything today to be up 3 dollars. At least I'm not in the red? Tomorrow seems like it might be fucky
when it eventually gets back online, be sure to watch a video on how the internet works

YouTube was down because someone uploaded a ‚ÄúNevada Ballot Counting‚Äù video
You glance up from your book and see a spider web in the window. The creature who made it is there. She is dark, but somehow contrasts with the dark New England sky. You lean back and watch as she spins a thread around a hapless fly, and as you stare you see beyond her.

You see yourself in such threads. You see your home, and your world in such threads. Slowly, your focus shifts to the stars, and in them you see *Call*thulhu. The one whom old gods call The Old God. As the lights he controls--lights that dwarf your own sad sun--blink, you feel his presence growing and see his form. Rising. Ever rising.

In this moment, you realize that He--and all life--are waging a holy war against collapse, against entropy, against the vacuum of black holes. You, and the spider, and all of life--no matter how infinitesimal--are vehicles of the expanding universe. Everything goes *outward*, everything goes *up*, in its own way. Because Callthulhu wills it.

Suddenly, the fly breaks from the spider's harness and takes flight. You jump to your feet, and lose sight of it against the stars. The fly had dipped, and you hadn't wagered it would soar again. Even though The Old God had promised you all things soar in time. You hadn't bought its dip. Even though The Old God had promised that you, and your home, and your world, would break from such bonds.

I get you, but UPS was basically a utility for 5 years before covid: traded in a tight range of $90-$105.  Then covid excitement happened and stock went to $160+ for earnings, obv investors got a little too pumped about short term.  TGT was on a multi year bull run in 2018/2019 on new strategy and huge structural growth story.  Covid has definitely juiced the run in the near term but IMO the long term fundamentals are still extremely bullish.  So personally, I am ok with earnings risk since I really believe the long term opportunity is there
We cant actually know that. There is a chance his organization gained billions from the presidency. Even though people know about his debt, he cant exactly say "that trade war insider trading got me rich"

Imagine buying odte's right before all of those tariff tweets. He likely bought a lot of loyalty from republican senators that way too. 

He has billions sitting offshore, no doubt about it. The reason those dictators like him is because thats probably where his money is hiding because those state banks cant be touched. 

Hes not as dumb as people think, maybe tacky and loud. He knows how to corrupt people and hide money for dam sure. he has never been prosecuted for tax evasion despite doing it his whole life. Thats not by chance, it takes blackmail and corruption to pull that off.

Who‚Äôs ready for another +2% day?
People taking profits in fear of possibility of bad earnings. So they ride the hype train up until right before.
ZM up $6.66 AH for a smooth $420. $500 tomorrow.
YouTube is working fine for me. What is everyone talking about?
probably. it's even more overbought than NIO, which is insane
Futures are üåà
New revalations about Biden and the election. It was no talking or voice over, pure video tapes. One after another. A solid 30ish minutes long but I only got to watch 2 min before youtube pulled the plug.



When youtube's back up, the video wont be there, i gaurentee it.
Fucking James man
So is it Papa Thielen now?

check out Maurice Samuel "you gentiles", its kind of the opinion of the other side and why white westerners have made the world into a crazy place. it doesnt seek to solve the problems but does elucidate the issues facing us
Loser
Gotta sell for at least 500% if you want to be part of the autis club on WSB lol.

But, think of it this way. A small profit is better than a big loss.
If it's down, then it makes the latter seem like the more likely scenario.
Sold PLTR before close, damn week hands!
> Not already getting rich
NIO gonna skyrocket after ER
treadmills were a craze a decade ago, now it's these dumb bikes; it'll drop but god knows when
Source to back this claim?
Oh shit he‚Äôs right
Well Ni Hao my friend.
bout to get wild from coast to coast
RTL languages.
 It's long and can't be shortened, deal with it, haha.

I mean I suppose most of us are only going to give you advice that we ourselves would do so in a way we're all biased. Perhaps a bit of diversification? I personally am starting a (Rypt0 mine in the free industrial zone of the Republic of Georgia (an amazing place where you basically pay no tax, don't need any licences, don't need accounting its almost like a business lawless zone, you can do medical research and manufacture pharmaceuticals even make consumables for children with just like absolutely no oversight its the wild west out there) but also not a sketchy country. Unlike trading and most other forms of income it's relatively stable because of algo switching.

Not sure how familiar you are with (Rypt0 but basically assuming you know nothing (forgive me) it's like a stock except let's say one minute AAPL is the top profiting stock it will be 'harvesting' those returns minute by minute and cashing them out into a (Rypt0 or fiat currency, and as soon as maybe XOM was to begin outperforming it would switch to harvesting the returns and on and on the wheel rolls. It's kind of like Stock trading but it only increases, never goes down, of course a systemic crash would be different but if there were a systemic (Rypt0 crash at this point I expect the stock market would also tumble.

You have done very well and I congratulate you but yeah I think if you take the historical average gains of the stock market since inception the returns are 10-13% annually but this (Rypt0 stuff right now with my model I'm looking at making \~400% profit.

But the cool thing is, with a (Rypt0 mine system the biggest risk is where you hold your value. For example if you mine (Rypt0

 you can hold the (Rypt0 that can go up or down or crash or whatever. Or cash it out to another (Rypt0 or another fiat currency. But for a successful trader as you are. On a weekly interval (the interval just reduces transaction fees) 1week/1month is ideal/acceptable and once you mined the (Rypt0, each $1 you put in has turned into $4 you could have these profits automatically flowing directly into a USD slush fund for investing in your stocks. Seems like a good flowing business model.

It's actually something I would love to do myself, except I never made the commitment to become a trader (Yet!) but yeah as a miner I would love to have someone on the other end and I would maybe split my profits 50/50 between reinvesting in mining and stocks.

I just came up with this idea when I saw this thread so don't criticise too hard but the more I think about it the more excited I get actually... I think I'm onto something... It's beautifully synergistic.
YouTube mobile still works for me
There could be a big pop tomorrow because Xpeng is breaking out so much AH which means ER should be great.
Hey bro you're kindof pissing on my memes here so I'ma give you some NKLA shares to fuck off
I'm in 40C 2/19
Perfect time for a correction
Some new footage I've never seen before about Biden and another segment proving the election was fradulent.

But it was a solid 30ish minutes and I only got to watch 2 min before youtube pulled the plug.
CORONA HAS MUTATED AND IS INFECTING THE INERWEBS
Jokes on you. I dropped out for free and still had $30k in loans to pay back
Yeah lol
Soooo... is Xpev gonna plummet after earnings
I have no idea. I sold two 50 pmcc's that expire next week and I'm worried they might go itm... this things insane I also have two 2023 55 calls for future pmcc's when they are in the money and I buy further otm leaps with the pmcc proceeds lol

Also BaaS is forever passive income for Nio, Tesla has 0 passive income that I'm aware of

Have some BABA 300c 12/11/20. Used the option calculator and breaking even doesn‚Äôt seem so far fetch but can afford for it to go down anymore.
No fuckingmachines.com
youtube down worldwide. puts on google
First - who comes to /r/wallstreetbets for ethical advice?

Second - trying to say that it's unethical is like trying to argue that cutting through the middle of the race track is "cheating" in the Special Olympics.  Shame on you.
Puts on cloud providers
Much more slightly, but it does.
Reddit app was down few hours ago too
Bots place orders so it doesn‚Äôt matter
Would you dropout of college for $1m?
I'm not disagreeing with you but as a new trader, what causes some stocks to just drop before earnings, even if it's expected to have positive returns? Just people not risking it and taking profits while in the green?
I find these calls to be quite offensive.

My various universities constantly increase tuition, constantly add admins, constantly build more shit that isn't core to the mission, and have $billion+ endowments. And they call and beg constantly. Are you fucking kidding?
GUYS GO TO YOUR BROWSERR. TYPE WWW.YOUTUBE.COM AND YOUR IN! 

only the app is down.  Now I know why life didn't end. If the website is down then we fucked.

Shit man 
What do you think it was ??
So? I only care about the end game. How it gets there I could give a dam. NKLA went down and then back up before crashing down very hard.
Im still mad there was no March madness last year üò°
Some tards never learn it seems
Not necessarily. Many stocks grow with the market for a long time. They have ups and downs, so sometimes someone coming in later will earn from the losses of someone before them. Eventually every business will go under, and someone will be left holding the bag, but there's countless examples where people who get in early cash out their earnings to people who go on to make substantially more. This is never the case in a pyramid scheme.
Yep
fkn idiot aapl retards

Bro fut blood red my IRA and 401k is FCKED!
It‚Äôs true. I got one off to it before they took YouTube down.
It's literally in the name of the sub.....
Better quality, everything is filmed on RED digital cinema cameras
Funny enough, I manages to close some for a minor loss right before Cloudflare One was announced. I had sold it on the seemingly random rise and when it continued rising I freaked out and closed, thank God I did. 

Had 3 short calls @65 expiring this past Friday for an earnings play I sold days prior (also sold my long 11/20 calls before earnings go figure), I was able to get out for about a 70 dollar loss the morning after earnings right before it really ran up to over 70+.

Now mainly selling lotto weeklies, very low delta and low premium but it adds up.
That‚Äôs the kind of shit our governor in Ohio has been saying for 6 months. Hilarious.
Far OTM, of course

Youporn is up why id everyone freaking out?
It's a longish video, I didn't even get to watch all of it before the site shut down. It was about Biden and also showed tinbits of proof that the election was stolen/fraud.
I would give up all of my savings to see her get railed
what did you buy at? I bought $3000 worth at $23. Biggest bitch stock ever
Dude better to take profits then to be down. Was up 50% on apple puts. Thought it was gonna tank after the event so I held. I'm now down 60% because it pumped after the event which it never does.
Asian emoji
I bet people who are risky in life are risky traders. Doesn't make sense you'd be like that in one respect and not the other.
You bought a put expiring Friday when earnings is next week .... you know it‚Äôs going to run up before earnings and then get sold off right before
Everyone's doing it so you might as well

Got a free car wash because I was stupid enough to join the military. So that‚Äôs a win.

Now imagine if you weren't poor and bought more than $150 worth of shares lmfao
Kayleigh McEnany sex tape came out on YouTube. We missed it boys.
With Tesla, there were wild speculations like robo taxis, a million mile battery, S&P 500 inclusion.  

With NIO, investors want to hear NIO say they are going to manufacture 10,500 cars/month in 2021.   Nothing too fancy.
THIS IS THE PLAY
It's actually a Sears roebuck fridge from 1947 missing the upper door
Reddit was down for a little bit today.

So during the spring covid wave, hospitals were overrun only in certain places. Regional outbreaks. Like you could get nurses or whatever to move to other regions to help out. Bruh we are at the point where this shit is everywhere and all hospitals are being overrun.

Easy money. But not for you.
Damn down worldwide and people would still rather refresh an error page than go to Vimeo. Ouch lol
Im thinking that more positive vaccine data will be a great thing for GLW because they may end up making the glass vials for everyone or atleast more than just for Pfizer.... even just for Pfizer should cause their stock to move up to $40+ if and when FDA confirms it

GLW Feb $40c for $.95

Eh, that's a fair point in one way.

But China's government is not accountable enough to its people generally. So, while it is refreshing that they're willing to smack down powerful business people, it's unfortunate the way they treat their citizens more generally.

Of course, the obvious argument is that these features are inextricably intertwined unfortunately.

 We could pay for a package right now to cover all of the wages, lost wages for individual workers, for losses to small companies, to medium-sized companies or city, state, county governments. We could do all of that," he said. "If we did that, then we could lock down for four to six weeks."

Couple things:

I'm sure a lockdown would help slow the spread but wouldn't it rebound once we come back?

Also 4-6 week lockdown would probably need a multi-trillion dollar stimulus. I just don't see senate republicans agreeing to it.

They're hiding something on Youtube. I guarantee it.
If you‚Äôre fr my advice is don‚Äôt take that loan and return it. 

Work hard, invest in high dividend ETF‚Äôs like SPHD, and use dividend money to gamble on options.

This way your gambling is free and your chance of eventually hitting it big are 100% bc you keep getting free money from ETF dividends to try over and over again.

Who needs technical analysis when this shit is happening.
Hard to say dude. If you bought at the bottom of the recent week, I‚Äôd guess you have much more upside than downside at the moment. 

Doing some reading to try and make better decisions I‚Äôve found that the PRC Gov likes to talk around ‚Äúsingles‚Äù day, and the drafts at present aren‚Äôt currently implemented. However J.Ma and his hubris and the concern of him dumping bad credit into the Chinese economy from users and profiting, via Ant, and also scuttling the IPO may be the beginning of a new poise. 

Either way, USA is about to have some issues and how that affects could go either way.

One thing is for certain. My 295c weeklies I bought ATM are going to expire worthless, after I didn‚Äôt take 70% profit and held.

May you have better luck.
I'm bullish over the next few months. I think the drop was a bit unnecessary and that it'll likely rebound within the next week or two. How much it rebounds will have to be seen, but I'm in very OTM Jan calls, so hoping for a strong bounce soon

Good for tech
Damn bro so almost as much as me. Although your calls are higher risk than the 10k in shares you got. What strike price is this? If it's low enough you can probably get rid of the bags on the recovery. The companies P/E and valuation are very fair for a tech company. No way this thing crashes any further unless CCP basically comes out and says imma close u down. There is so much bad news on this stock and it's found a good support at 260. Only flat or up from here. I think what is slowing this down is just investors are concerned it won't perform due to the controversy surrounding it. Once people get over it it'll pop, there's prob shorts that need to cover too. Just need to wait it out with the bags. Sigh

Question 1: Open Interest

Question 2: Anyone who sells to open and has the trade picked up. Happens whenever there is a buyer and seller

Question 2 2: electric boogaloo: MMs hedge according to the delta on your option. If you are a retard buying 200% OTM $NIO calls expiring Friday, and you're here asking this question, so you probably are, the MM isn't buying the full 100 shares to offset your rampant retardation.

PS5 for amazing controller, design, and first party exclusives
I usually figure out how many contracts I want to buy, the least amount of time in willing to own them, and then try to find a strike that I believe is achievable in that timeframe.   (In this instance, I wanted the furthest dated options, 10 contracts, and I wanted to spend less than 300k).  So what I landed on what $160C 3/24/23.   Sadly, when I bought them on Mondays peak, my break even was 473.

I only sell my covered calls at a point that is greater than my break even, so even if the underlying breaks through the strike that I sold at I'll generate a profit despite losing the time value of the LEAP.    I also sell them at a delta that is high enough that had I just bought the stock outright, I would have sold it.

So now I sell these between 480 and 530, with <7 to 45 DTE.  This allows me to have a constant stream of income coming in, without having to constantly worry about the daily fluctuations of the stock price.  I generate a minimum of 4k a month and upwards of 10k.  This is more than enough to pay my bills, save a little bit, and still have my regular working income to do everyday stuff.   

If and when the underlying crashes, I do not start selling below my adjusted break even strikes.  That's a recipe for disaster.  The name of my game is just to pay my bills, and then put my work income into my brokerage account to buy more LEAPS.  I have forced 20 year retirement in my job, so I'm trying to by then if not sooner.

Open interest = number of contracts open. Volume is quantity traded. If there's high volume with no open interest, it very likely that a lot of new contracts were opened. High open interest with low volume means a lot of contracts were opened in the past but they didn't exchange hands that day. When contracts are exercised, open interest goes down the next day.

There are all kinds of people buying and selling contracts. We don't know who's doing the buying and selling.

Thanks for the kick, there's really no reason for me to hold long and not sell CCs. I used to do it back a long time ago with my dividend portfolio. I'd collect the dividend and goose it with CCs on T mostly (but INTC, PBI, AAPL, others too)

With something as stable as T I could only get like 2% a year but with vol like I'm into now I could make a lot more. Just need to overcome my inherent laziness and stubborn retardation.
Almost never. The main scenario is if dividends will be paid out the next day, call options are sometimes exercised early.
True

I sold all my positions today it was early but better than loss.

Don‚Äôt be scared to take some small losses, but also don‚Äôt be afraid to let ur winners ride. I know it‚Äôs a lot easier than done but that‚Äôs one of the most important things. Also don‚Äôt go chasing FDs and Yoloing when ur down big to try to come back overnight with one play. 9/10 times it‚Äôll just make u lose more. I also usually buy a few long dated contracts I‚Äôm confident in and scale out of my longer dated ones accordingly.

Bunch of things all in a row. Jack Ma talked back to Daddy Xi which resulting in Ant IPO being put on ice for ~6+ months (BABA owns 30%), vaccine efficacy announcement hit them (and all ecommerce) then immediately after that anti-trust draft regulations were announced that target BABA/TENCHY/JD.

Investors got very spooked and triggered a huge selloff down to ~260 support line.

Ok all the retards should be up to date now.

Long BABA obv.
More importantly rtx to 69.69
gotta watch the travis scott retard so he knows what to like.

Yea but if you open a bear spread or bull spread you get the premium and have to put up the width of spread - premium as collateral. But with iron condors I didn‚Äôt realize you get both premiums but don‚Äôt have to put up both collaterals. It‚Äôs only one width.

WTF happened with BABA lately? Xi gonna take all my money?
So you make sure the LEAPS you buy are mostly intrinsic value so that if the calls you sell are exercised you don't lose as much extrinsic? 

Synthetic covered calls are much more dangerous than regular covered calls because not only can you lose potential gains (not really a loss) but if you are forced to exercise your leaps you can lose a bunch of time value

what‚Äôs happening with the market i‚Äôm confused is it gonna go up or down
Depends on how much influence GOOG has
Use your imagination.
The problem is that whereas in March the outbreaks were in certain densely populated areas that quickly adopted social distancing and could fly in resources and personnel from elsewhere now it‚Äôs happening all over the country because the general population, like the market, has forgotten about it again. That will change very quickly when images of makeshift morgues and videos from stressed out nurses start emerging again. I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen I just think it‚Äôs inevitable if you just look at what the experts are saying combined with the fact that nobody is really taking it seriously enough yet. You also have a lame duck administration unwilling to do anything. It‚Äôs a Scary time
I don‚Äôt have high hopes for performance but we‚Äôll see.

I am taking this to mean "Buy $35 calls on Delta Airlines that expire on 11/20."  Going to drop $2,000 into them at open to see if my fortune cookies pick better stocks than me.
Nah, theyre just sold out everywhere right now and i have a couple of free days which id be able to actually play

Ok, so you take the initial 9.5 (89.5) and the inverse of 5.9 (85.9). Now, go through the history of the stock, and find the 2nd set of inverse antlers. when you have found that, set the difference of the 3rd antler point of the second antler. that price is called the *set price*. take the set price and do math with the radical difference of IV%. That will be the profit.

I feel you on that. Just know that just by being aware of that is a huge step in resolving the issue. I still struggle with it but it helps to actively try to be to other people what your dad couldn‚Äôt have been for you. 

 It‚Äôs probably not your dad‚Äôs fault as those characteristics were probably caused by his father, but you‚Äôre in a position to change that for your kids and for yourself! I hope all is well for you man. 

Try to keep an active lifestyle and eat the right things too. It really helps with confidence and gives you a positive image of yourself

How much did you buy these for? You can turn your remaining position into a spread by selling $15 or $16 calls against them.

That way you take tendies off the table while still having skin in the game.

NIO is interesting but I have never heard of a successful Chinese car company. I may feel a bit more confident when NIO creates the production capacity to compete. The question is if they can do so before other companies secure a footing in the marketshare.

You know what's crazy about that? I work in business insurance and they're not even paying the business interruption claims. It's a good thing policies are worded such that you need property damage to have a business interruption because this would've literally bankrupted the industry if not.

I mean you can play options, just not retarded FDs.

I went from owning a few hundred shares of Tesla to controlling 1000 shares using LEAPS out 860 days.  Each contract @ $120 strike was 27k, saving me 14k per 100 shares to sell synthetic covered calls against.  I sell CCs at 10-30 delta above my break even price.

That's a responsible way to use options to leverage your capital to gain great exposure and allow you to either harvest regular income, or average down your cost of entry.  Deep ITM options are relatively safe, especially if they have a delta that is almost 1 (my contracts are .95) as they are essentially serving as the stock.  It's when you try to get rich by having dozens of far OTM FDs trying to get rich quick that you're gonna (statistically) have a bad time.  4000 every month is better than maybe getting 40k once.

If you bought 1 put option for $500 then your maximum profit if exercised is $X.xx*100shares-$500, where X is strike price - stock price. Selling the option before expiration instead of exercising is based on the price of the option, not directly correlating to the price of the stock (though its always factored in the option price) which gives you potential for higher profit.
That‚Äôs what they want you to think.

The trade price is high on CNK cause I was selling weeks FDs at the 10 strike not expecting Pfizer to give everyone green dildos so I had to sell some shares to buy the calls back before it went up to high.

Ok i don't understand how this work then.Because my thought is if i "bet" 500$ that the price will fall it only can fall to 0$ so i won 500$ = 100% of my investment?

&#x200B;

Edit: In the other direction it can go above 500$ so i can win over 100%.

Thats my point of view pls correct me.
200 was fucking with me good luck cuz!
We should start an ETF for thots
I also tend to find it really funny when I‚Äôm losing money. Pretty sure it‚Äôs brain damage.
Well let's say you're right. I asked you for an example -- any example -- of an action that would be deemed "irrational" under the definition that you use.

You couldn't even give one.

What do you mean? The market can still stay positive and companies can waste away at the same time. You just do not hear about them. Ask zoomers how they feel about blockbuster, dell, or millennials about Packard, Amoco. 
Most companies have life cycles that come to an end and fade to history. The good ones manage to extend out.  

So if I were to offer you a 10 year option on TESLA or an equal valued option on FORD, which one would you take?

Tech is also creating highly volatile companies. Which is matching with the mindsets of the new generation trader.

People aren't taking about a physical size, they are using the fab branding (which just confusingly named that way) Intel 14nm++++++, Samsung 8nm, TSMC N7P or N5.

TSMC's N5 is the best process right now, they are killing it with their EUV nodes. It doesn't matter that the name doesn't make sense.

You don't have a concept of what scrutiny or logical debate are, and your comment about "rational actor" here just proves it. You made zero useful counterpoints, you gave examples proving my points then claiming that I was wrong, specifically around commodities and valuations. You were so disconnected from the basis of the conversation and what an economy is actually based on that your replies were nonsensical throughout, which is why the same things were said over and over again as you attempted to win an argument by latching onto a fragment and misinterpreting it as an attempt to distract from not having any coherency. Try to be better next time you give someone a "well change my mind!" comment.

Yes he would, lol his stock options would be worth less. Besides, it‚Äôs not illegal lol to be honest you could have done it too. They have already said when they were releasing data. Their vaccine efficacy goals were pretty low (60%). The whole protocol is published on their website. They won‚Äôt unblind the study until they get the number of cases need for each interim analysis so there‚Äôs no way he could have known much more than you or I.

Everybody acts like a guys ass is sexy, but mine looks like a fucking forest, and ass never smells good, so idk what the fuck the appeal is.
Imagine thinking about holding NIO through earnings when it generates 720mil rev but is valued at 60bil??? it's just waiting for a correction. It will likely drop when exposed through earnings unless they pull a LK and use Chinese math.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: I will be purchasing NIO calls if it drops 30% or more tomorrow
I hope you guys know that investors don‚Äôt particularly care if PLTR beat earnings. They‚Äôre more concerned with the value of the company as an asset to companies that rely on data analytics and manipulations- which is pretty much every single company...

Most worthless investment ever contrived.
Recent/relevant plays.

Yesterday, I bought a few hundred ZM calls for 550/600 strikes for late December. I am up 60-90% on them. I do not plan to hold the through earnings (a few).

I am short PLTR (very risky given the speculative nature).

I am short CSCO, but risky again since so much bad news is already priced in.  Long term, I see this company price falling. I do not know if this earnings will be the catalyst.

I have a decent put position on NIO. Tomorrow is the day I decide to hold or jump.

I closed out my CRSR positions today.

I have fetfetch positions I held since $26. Selling half tomorrow.

I have a put position for DKNG.

Note: I am using money out of my large gains pot for risky bets. I have plenty in reserves to end the year with my by far best year. So do not copy my plays as this is all money I am willing to lose in the hope of bringing home a big prize.

I have some reverse iron butterflies for a few trades next week I am opening.

Many of my other trades are just based off momentum in the moment during the day. I have no idea how you guys trade on a phone without having access to charts, scanners, scripts to run backtesting for quick modeling, etc.
It's like playing darts, but with the stock market.

When you call yourself a successful trader while being on wallstreetbets, just makes you the king of degenerates. 
Also did you really think saying 1 tick of options is 100? Fuck sake you were born to be on wall street bets with your pathetic logic. 1 point for options is $100. 1 point for SIL is $1000. 1 point for SI is $5000. Cool options have decay when Futures don't. Also congrats on making $310 dollars... idk if you were trying to making a point because 2000% for SIL is $1.1k

Nothing you've written really stands up to any scrutiny. But let me tell you a secret -- if we start delving into the economics of even 40 or 30 years ago and the experiments that were run, it gets even worse for the economic horoscopes that you believe in. Your beliefs were actually disproven. The "rational actor" idea was disproven so badly that you now have to redefine the word "rational" to have zero meaning.

You could change your mind. If you are smart, you will change your mind.
Anyone else feel like social media companies are testing out their kill switches instead of just outages? Brokerages too..
Yeah what he said. If you got hella shares then just sell options against them
Bears and Bulls alike should be making money everyday, this volatility can swing you in the money during the first 30 minutes of open on both sides.
‚ÄúOpen interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as options or futures‚Äù - literally copied off of investopedia
Huh. I only open bear or bull spreads never combined them to make an iron condor so yea I see now it‚Äôs only the difference of one sides width. 

Still, good luck getting that to close between $355 and $356 for max profit haha

Eventually online sports betting and fantasy sports are going to be HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE.

However, with COVID still shutting down everything, no one knows when. Also, online betting laws aren't 100% legal in all states.

I think too many people are day trading it to be a play in the near future.... but sub $40 prices per/share... i think is a good entry.

I bought stock sub $40, because I think people like you will bump the price in the coming weeks.

However, if winter is really coming... all this shit if gonna get shut down before christmas.
Above 100 by December. Earnings gonna be yuge
How much you think 1 can get from applying for a ppp loan?
It got rona
The next payments are due in January, it could be a first week issue for him. But agree definitely skeptical
I think it‚Äôs a good buy if you‚Äôre looking to get stocks. I am an idiot and lost a couple hundred in a few hours with some calls on Monday and I paper hands sold... A bunch of states just legalized online gambling snd DKNG has the name recognition and overall value is there... they released a bunch of new shares a few weeks back which crashed the stock hard. I‚Äôd jump in tomorrow before earnings if I were you and just ride on- as long as sports keep playing I think it‚Äôll keep growing. But also I‚Äôm an idiot.

You‚Äôre a fucking nimwit with a negative trading portfolio aren‚Äôt you? Don‚Äôt get mad because everyone is pointing out the obvious, which is you‚Äôre trading in ratios and paying the difference in the ratios because you are basing it off of a tick instead of dollars which can be broken down into percentages of a tick. 1 tick = $100 in options, and FYI $15 calls on XOM netted +2000% or 310.00 on Monday, could‚Äôve been 4.20 on Tuesday. Guess what? The decay was so minimal I would‚Äôve bank rolled even if there wasn‚Äôt a huge swing. Go ahead and try to hold those silver futures. What‚Äôs going to happen come November when it has slowly bled off costing you money based on time and value decay? Sure it‚Äôs going to go up, but I think it‚Äôs gonna drop sharply before it goes back up really hard. You should try studying your long term patterns.           

If a thousand return isn‚Äôt hard, why aren‚Äôt you making the type of money where you can sit back and make fun of dumb fucks like yourself instead of arguing with successful traders?

Futures you gotta have more capital to hold anything overnight, but you can pull the plug at anytime... so maybe they have more money and control their risk more, but if you actually trade options instead of just yolo shit I think options are way more complex.  So I just lose money on both
However I've gotten a few general Hammer bands and still don't have flare

>Goods and services providers are a small minority

...in what alternate dimension is that a majority? Do you have a job? You are selling a company your service, and you are a service provider. Anyone who is paid money is a goods or service provider. I think a very, *very* tiny minority in this country lives their lives without doing something to earn money.

>Fake news. The [original transcription of the speech from the WHO director](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---12-october-2020) says precisely nothing about "profound negative effects" of lockdowns. It simply recommends targeted interventions where and when needed going forward.

and yet, straight from [the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19):

>Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‚Äòlockdowns‚Äô, can slow COVID‚Äë19 transmission by limiting contact between people.

>However, *these measures can have a profound negative impact* on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.

I get that my government is acting. I don't blame them for trying. But the implementation is also wasteful and too strict. I hope they do a better job next time around.

I appreciate that Trump did not implement federal regulations surrounding masks and other prevention measures, and I hope Biden does not attempt to implement any, or tell states to enter more lockdowns. Everyone is aware of the virus at this point and there is no longer a chance it will get out of hand.

The recording is legit. If you watch the recording they do trick him into twisting up his story saying basically "ok it is POSSIBLE i MAY have heard something wrong" 

Then they use that to say he recanted when it was never really his intent

It's basically the same perjury trap they ran on Flynn. He should have had a lawyer with him. 

His allegations aren't really important anyways but the way he was interrogated (when it they thought he was going into more of an interview) and the way the media ran with the story says a lot.

i‚Äôll prob sell right b4 close

If you're up a couple hundred percent, don't risk holding during earnings. Run for your life.
I have tried so many times to understand how puts and calls work and i still have very little understanding. It seems to me, and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I have to actively sell them, aka i have to be monitoring them constantly in order to safely (lol) make money.

Puts on fatties. Young ones too
Bought at $17. When it hit $45 I put a stop loss at $39.50, thinking better to protect 100%+ gains than risk an overnight dump. It hit $39.10, Robinhood sold all my shares at $39.30 (is this even legal? Why does Robinhood get such shit prices? Shit app, fuckaround accounts only), and then it bounced. Thankfully I was able to buy back in at $39.75, but I feel like every time I set a stop loss it's just a V with my set value right at the bottom.

There are, on occasions, times when owning equity is superior to options if for no other reasons than you can baghold longer than the market can make a fool of you.

Broadly speaking, if they don't live up to expectations? It seems like a lot of the time, earnings are a crapshoot. I'm holding NIO and PLTR calls for Feb, but even I'm suddenly getting nervous about tomorrow.

I think INTC is slightly undervalued while NVDA is slightly overvalued. NVDA will definitely have a higher growth rate from here, but it's not like it's growing at 50% a year.... maybe 15%-20% a year max. Intel isn't going to disappear.
looks like you broke resistance and hit a bear trap, keep going you can do it
so what you‚Äôre really saying is that by next month spce will at least double? you coninvced me, i‚Äôm in you son of a bitch!

Fisker is butt ugly it will never blow up like NIO. NIO is a carbon copy of all the good aspects of Porsche and other European luxury cars and therefore gets sales. What ugly car can you think of broke out in a heavily saturated market? It's always the best looking one out of the bunch, technicals always come second unless it offers something absolutely groundbreaking like Tesla did, the look is what sells the car.

I'm sure there's something to that accusation, but if he was fully acting on insider information (in a criminal manner), it feels like he probably would have had even better timing. He obviously wouldn't have been able to gauge the markets day-to-day movement this far in advance, but wouldn't it have made more sense to at least give the stock price a full market day to finish rising after the announcement?

Only sell if you‚Äôre at a profit Thursday. If not don‚Äôt worry if it takes a dump after they report earnings. In fact I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised I could see it dump after the report as it‚Äôs only been on an up trend since it‚Äôs launch. This isn‚Äôt to scare you. I am 100% in this play. We have 3 months to reach the break even price of $20.50. It literally can do that in a day. If it dumps I‚Äôm

I agree with stoping option trading. (Down vote me bitch, my portfolio looks better than yours). But long term stocks and playing the market like a pussy has worked historically for ages. It will at least keep up with inflation over decades. Just put money in spy. Buy the dip and stay in. Not options, normal stock.

I'm in for the same calls. 140 contracts 22c  1/21/22. HAd a long position prior at 10.50 but fuck it. I'm checking back next August to see where I'm at. If we get to a 22 strike by EoY that'll be nuts.
There u go. I predict the volatility to keep going at the earliest until friday, or until the news gets out in a month that the offer at 7.50 was rejected. After news of an offering i have usually seen stocks stick at what they claimed the offer was, or just tank. I am predicting ACB will tank due to a variety of reasons. I don't understand why ppl buy in past 7.50.

This comment is hilarious - warning about not understanding a financial instrument and then not even knowing what OTM is. The option is OTM if its below the strike price, not the breakeven price. Obviously you can still exercise the option if its between the breakeven and strike, and its not going to expire worthless in that range. Take your own advice my dude.

Supposedly this Pfizer vaccine feels like a severe hangover - can't be good. I've also had hangovers worse than Flus. 

Taking a relatively untested mRNA vaccine (has a single mRNA vaccine EVER been approved and taken by a large population?) seems like a much larger risk to me than Covid itself at this point. About one-third to one half of the country wont touch any of these vaccines.

I'm still really bearish on these earnings. Given the record of the company and crazy hype I'm debating on dumping tomorrow and buying back in if it tanks.

The iPhone was the best phone for a long time and became a status symbol. Chinese phones like Oppo and Xiaomi just don‚Äôt have the same brand image. Even if China subsidized them to compete against Apple, Apple just has so much cash to burn.

And a big difference is that iPhones are portable. You can buy them abroad and bring them back to China. The government would have to ban the chipsets from its networks or something, and lots of people in the government probably had iPhones, so there‚Äôs no easy way to get rid of iPhones as a competitor to chinese brands.

With tech companies, you can just block the website from the Chinese internet, or say the software needs to pass regulator‚Äôs approval, and then refuse to approve it.

So if Tesla is a car company maybe they can sell cars, if they can find enough cash to burn to keep up with a government subsidized competitor. But as a tech company they don‚Äôt have a hope in China. And their stock is not valued as a car company.

I have been trying for months to understand  where is the profit in buying leaps unless the underlying goes so far ITM that it's basically like being long the shares. 
I'm looking at the 2023 leaps on NIO and they're $14 to $19 for calls as far as possible OTM. near the money is multiples more.
 I've watched videos and done all sorts of reading and I still can't get my head around how you make money on that. Is it really as straightforward as it seems in that the only way to make money is if they share price of the underlying goes to the strike plus the premium paid?
Because every day I look at options near expiration date are at or near the money and are a fraction of the premium paid for a leap. What am I missing? It seems like with far-out leaps there's no leverage and one would be better off going long the shares now if one has that much faith that the price of the underlying is going to move that far by expiration.

Have you never heard the phrase buy high sell low
Absolutely. Hold until 2030, when this show really takes off.
Compared to other modern tech companies their leadership structure is neutral and the whole "not turning a profit" thing doesn't mean much in a vacuum. There's a difference in not turning a profit between companies like NKLA vs AMZN vs TSLA, which all have entire units that bleed. Question is, what's the outlook? Hopefully we find out tomorrow

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday claimed that Hopkins went back on his allegations of ballot tampering, saying that **investigators from the USPS Office of Inspector General had told the committee that the whistleblower had signed a sworn affidavit recanting his claims**.

(if this is true, then his public bluster is just a face saving smokescreen. i choose to give deference to the USPS Inpector General.)

A partial clip released Tuesday night *appears to be recording of a meeting between Hopkins and USPS Office of the Inspector General Agent Russell Strasser*. The Epoch Times **has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the recording**.

Blood green
baby red
Yea but I‚Äôm not really doing it for money to buy FDs or anything. I just want enough collateral to sell puts on PLTR. I have about $2,500 in my portfolio, mostly held in stock and the first 1k on margin is interest free. So an additional 1k can just be used as the collateral and even if I get assigned there very little risk of a margin call because my account value would have to drop a whole $1,500
GO big or go home!
Mostly correct, but at $20.01 to $20.20, the option would be ITM, just not profitable for OP.   It would likely expire being worth however much the stock is above $20.
Why? You like feeding the machine? Way more fun to take from them.

Looks like the the notes restricted their ability to repurchase stock. If so, redeeming the $125m would allow them to better leverage their Revolving Credit which **does** permit **share repurchase** and **redemption of options**.

Interesting that the redemption date is a few days after earnings...seems like this news is setting up the stage for something BIG!
pretty much. they are getting all the shorts suckered in rn so that they can light their asses on fire.

but does one person sell to many or do many sell to one person
The market isnt shifting from tech as fast as the know it alls claim it. Boomer companies that survive this will still be on the down trend for the next decade.

The stock moons, you spend the entire day watching it deciding whether to enter. 10 minutes to close, this could be it. 'Play it safe' you think to yourself, 'If I put my money on an index surely I will be safer.' It's your final chance at redemption. The cursor moves slowly across the screen... BUY SPY 370 CALL.

Market closes, you're up 5% on your call already. You feel good and decide to take a break.

It's 5:30PM, you check the news, JPOW is speaking at 6. 

You wait. You have TradingView open on your laptop, watching your stock surge during after hours. The clock turns 6, JPOW walks on screen, opens his mouth and...

It's a bloodbath, SPY drops to 300 instantly. You freeze, watching the monitor with an empty gaze. There is nothing you can do so you take yourself to bed and cry yourself to sleep.

It's 9:20AM, you're already poised at your monitor with your finger on the sell button. You cannot lose more than this. Boom, market opens, you click with lightening speed as you see more red candles appear. You're out, safe from any further losses. You decide to stay out for the rest of the day, not only to preserve what little mental stability you have left, but also as you simply cannot afford to make another play.

It's 4PM, the news is on. You pay little attention until you hear the presenter say "The S&P 500 reached all time highs today after suffering a major blow overnight."

You sigh. Hop in your car and drive to the nearest Lowe's to buy some rope.

What major news network did you steal this from and why is it CNBC??
Walmart+
Why?
Futures flat = bears fuk
This is probably a smart money play... Unless it explodes and you miss the moon landing. Then you're stuck just fucking floating through space. 

Why not look at activity before, during and after previous earnings?
What is that you‚Äôre using to view futures?
‚ÄúOff to find the mythical clitoris!‚Äù
May have bottomed today but still looks like a knife catch. The bitch is that at some point Ma is gonna kiss the ring and this shit will gap up to 300+ overnight. So you either move now and bleed out waiting, or miss the huge move and hope there‚Äôs a follow up to new ATHs.
I know it's not really the sub to say this, but if you made 10% you're still doing better than putting that money in nearly any regular etf like most people do, and a fuckload better than people who just leave their money in "high interest" savings accounts which pay less than inflation
100 days out PLTR and 65 days out NIO but my paper hands finna tap sell tmr
Is*
Did PRPL beat earnings?
I'm all for gambling but with my own money, ya know?
I sold baba and sq put yesterday after two days of decimation. My inner wsb autist would've bought zm and baba puts yesterday at the low.
I'm selling msft amd aapl strangles, BA strangles, and tomorrow I'm going to sell DKNG covered puts to anticipate the earnings run-up.
Sure you can... you just need to have enough bitcon.
wtf.....
as for inflation:
> simply surviving is getting cheaper or staying the same compared to inflation

>*living* a good life is getting more expensive compared to inflation

This is the rift between the haves and the have nots, and what will eventually lead to UBI where the hard working folks are paying for the freeloaders.
Agree

Sorry for who bought
I‚Äôm doing that with AMC calls, I‚Äôll be a millionaire in no time!!!
Don't like disclosing my networth on reddit, but it's enough money that if we moon on Thursday the total gains will cover an entire year's salary for most people. 

I bought in one hour after IPO.
AMD 12/18-1/21 CALENDAR SPREAD 90C
HD OR LOW CALLS 300 or 170c
Not sure about a 3rd.. maybe ATVI call for wow expac and call of duty releases. 85c should hit.
I was speaking in terms of the market but yeah go ahead be an asshole
Imagine buying  calls at the top lol

Sounds legit
Where on robinhood can i buy futures on heroin?
Lol
Hope so
Imagine thinking futures matter 53 minutes into open. What the fuck is wrong with your brains.
Had to dump baba today, cant trust the chinese government. This is exactly why BABA is so undervalued.  Too risky for average American to invest in
Yo is there a way to track when executes have their stock sales set up? 

They legally can't sell based on dropping good news; so they just do the reverse. 

They set up the sells months in advance; then wait until that day to announce the good news they have been sitting on. 

Having executive stock sale schedules would be a goldmine
It‚Äôs apparently not wrong
Sir, this is a food bank.
Wait until after earnings to see if it trade sideway or dip. If it drop 5-10% do a leap call options with strike price of previous high or near the money.
These are gonna print ü§ëü§ëü§ë PLTR makes our money go brrrrrr

Go to your account page and check under Investing.
Why so?
Basically said that they want to limit the power and influence of big companies and want to regulate ‚Äúmonopolistic‚Äù businesses like BABA.
Come on OP, how long did your retarded ass take to pull this off?
Day traded PTON $105c 11/13. Closed for ~90% profit. I traded using the 5m chart.

I agree with OP, there still may be another 10-20% run in the next few days.

Looking at the daily chart, RSI is 44 and MFI is 60. Last two days have closed green. I may wait another day before trading longer dated calls.

If you‚Äôre day trading, the 5m and 10m charts are very helpful.
This is the way
Shares? That doesn‚Äôt sound right
Better dump hard. Was up almost a 100% on my puts the it pumped.

Quote from my brother that's only ever had ~$100 in his robinhood account:

*Yeah, Ford is where I've made most of my money on the stock market. Last week it went up to $50 and I sold that shit immediately.*

What kind of work do you do? I do video editing and graphic design and sometimes i use mandy.com for that. Also LinkedIn job search is quite good.
Thinking of upgrading to a margin account on RH... but that could be the beginning of the end
I think the key is to have my money in the market the least amount of stagnent time. Just decays. Or just start trading the wheel on something.
have you tried OnlyFans? Since I've created mine I am making a steady 800 a month. Yes I have to film myself doing some sounding and yes I've had to gap my asshole a lot (its loose now) but hey, I can afford to buy puts that will never print  ü§°
Right lol looks like I‚Äôm bag holding
In this market not everyone is going to be right every time

You could've sold cash secured RKT puts to some of these morons who blindly chased the company (remember what happened last time RKT had an earning) and got iv crushed. There are opportunities no matter the portfolio. Size isn't everything -- keep an eye out for a good stock under 100 that you think you can attempt to time it. I've been profiting from selling AMD options.
Can u explain to me if someone can get more than 100% out of a put option?  
Like i buy 1 Share worth 500$ so my maximum profit is 500$ right? Or is a put option more valuable when the drop happens almost instantly after you bought the option?

ZM $500 tmr
Bullish
Wow. That's bullish. I'm not even that confident. What's your total value?
Yeah, you're an inpatient alright...
Duh. Always sell before earnings. The crucial thing is, which date exactly are you gonna sell?

I feel more comfortable buying those stocks. If they have a good balance sheet, strong business fundamentals and aren't too reliant on credit, count me in even if Bald Adderall Man doesn't notice them. This is for long term investing, because I'm THAT kind of retard. 

For options? Fuck that, I want the ones the youtubers are talking about. Fuck a balance sheet and fuck fundamentals.

This is the way. Waiting to see what happens with earnings. Regardless the share price should be comfortably above $17.50 come February this literally can‚Äôt go tits up

Intel price/book 2.5, Nvidia price/book 25.86.

Intel free cash flow $15.43B,  Nvidia $3.67B.

&#x200B;

So Nvidia is worth 2x as much as intel but makes 1/4 as much money? Lmao

People could also argue that recessions only hurt the poor though and with more need for stimulus along with rates probably staying low for a while comes asset prices rising, not saying it couldn‚Äôt test lower but it also could push higher and then find support around this range for the next while to come

Just picked up 100 shares let's goooo
Option 1- a version of the wheel, sell puts when it's just under the normal value. Buy back when it's pumped up. If you get assigned, sell calls at the pump and buy back when it dips. Adjust to heavy on holding and selling covered calls if there are dividends to collect. Buy a long dated put if it is at risk of bankruptcy.

Option 2 - Sell a put 1-2 deviations above where it is trading, sell a call 1-2 deviations below where it is trading. You may need to have the cash to own 200 shares of the stock to do this depending on your options level. If the stock stays range bound like you say it does, you'll make a little bit of money every week. 

I'm doing one of each of these strategies in two different brokerages on a stock that trades around $3-$4 and has a lot of people gambling on it. I'm making $25-40 a week on a $800 max risk.

Fuck me I stared at PLTR stock when it was 9.50 for weeks I'm such a fuckin idiot getting in at 14. This shit better dip harder then Danny Brown at earnings so I can buy more
BLACK THURSDAY
Again; this is based off what I have seen with my eyes and heard with my ears. This is also one of the most irrelevant accusations of the many. It does show how grimy the feds are though. If you actually listen to this you hear them trying to get this guy to walk back his accusations for 45 minutes

of course these videos are constantly being pulled down by youtube so check them quickly if you care to.

The media are writing whatever they want right now; it honestly reeks of desperation. 1984 shit. Don't just go by Snopes to check if things are true or not lmao.

Imagine being so braindead you don't realize both sides are absolutely full of propoganda. The right uses sites like 4chan, the left has literally everything else (msm, tech, reddit itself)
This sounds like guaranteed losses. Basically an iron fly
It‚Äôs because MM know people are going to buy following Cramer‚Äôs advice so they dump the stock
sry bro, nice ride tho
What's a share?

Lol, I am rooting for you. You are right and I do appreciate the reminder.  I‚Äôm so loaded up on zoom right now that the $600 wasted on that doesn‚Äôt even register at the moment.

Not good we haven‚Äôt had a solid red day in awhile üò´
Long 2k shares of PLTR since day 1 and even I am praying for these circle jerkers to get wiped out this week. If I'm in the same boat as all these retards what does that make me?

Alright, thanks man. In the true spirit of this dumb fucking sub I‚Äôm gonna go in nearly blind and see what happens. I don‚Äôt have too much to lose lmao.
I'm so fucking pissed I sold my 11$ 11/20c last week. It's obscene the dumb shit I do even when I know the play.
Just bought like 11k in stocks and sold calls for $2 a pop dang Premium is crazy
Target is always packed. People spend their whole day there like it‚Äôs a resort.
You're smart! Mark my words

No you cant
Selling around 11 am tomorrow and then buying a cheap OTM call and cheap OTM put just to see what happens after earnings. I may lose 30 bucks on one but win big on the other.
Some of their competitors are trading 50-100 times sales. That would take the market cap somewhere between 40 and 80 billion, taking the price between $27 & $55. I‚Äôm grabbing so many of these FDs I can‚Äôt hardly stand it my ass is smoking. Best part is that I‚Äôm not seeing a flood of posts here on it so after the earnings bump it‚Äôs going to get a wave of retard energy fueling it ever higher. It will be glorious

PLTR going to the moon though?
I got a 2023 synthetic on Palantir.
It might go up because of short squeezes, but I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.

Sexy as fuck sir
My bad, I meant this retard as in me.  Dropped like a rock and still worthless.
Sorry got a call. So MRO capped their Oklahoma (right?) Operations but kept their Texas ops running. They're at about 50% capacity compared to last year. If this action is similar across the big boys then oil has stabilized on reduced production. It's a tough call to figure out if oil companies may resume ops to bring in a little extra revenue for a lower price or stay here. Also depends if you're doing oil or oil companies
PLTR is carrying my NIO losses
Ah yes the old ‚Äústick to 5-10% a day‚Äù strategy. Easily done and easily replicated over time. It‚Äôs so simple why doesn‚Äôt everyone do it?
Dude there is like $40 bucks in groceries there!
Source? I bought at the fucking top this week
Aapl 150C
Yes, and it‚Äôs an increase of over 20 percent from last year‚Äôs event
Pfizer is the same price it was 2 weeks ago.
we're hitting major trendline resistance but don't really have enough velocity to get thru that so they're like keep rotating back and forth thru shit to try to get thru it.

that's the simple version.

could do a better job of explaining but I'm exhausted.
How are my palantir and nio calls looking boys?
I sold a $47 call for Friday and now I sweating they're gonna take my shares.
I feel that. The cracking point for me was when my doctor told me I have no clue about nutrition and I couldn‚Äôt be plant based and healthy. He insisted on doing blood work, as he was sure that I was missing some vitamins. Never gave me the results, so I‚Äôm assuming everything came back fine. 

I was told by my accountant that I‚Äôm going to get a fine here in CA for not having insurance, so now that I‚Äôm paying for it, I feel like I might as well try with a new doctor and get the check ups I‚Äôm paying for.

Just curious if this was normal, because most people I know go every year, and sometimes even if they‚Äôre sick, which is crazy to me.
Positions
Yes

Just bought a few $T, 11/13 $40 strike, based on this comment.  Thanks!

yes thanks bro :)
PLTR isn't gonna shit itself. It may cool off a bit with these daily 5-10% runups, but it was way undervalued to begin with.

This retard is holding a weekly put at $70.  Bought before earnings, lmao.
Reminds me of election dump and volatility prophecies
I had NIO leaps, but China scares the fuck out of me. So I ended up selling them earlier today. I want to see what happens after earnings to re enter
‚ÄúPlease sir, I‚Äôll take some virus straight into my bloodstream.‚Äù What can go wrong?
‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt‚Äù meaning expiring in the money and losing out on potential earnings?
[deleted]
theres a good chance you've already had it!
(or will soon be able to say so)

PLTR makes the most sense with leaps. It‚Äôs not a breakout stock anyone playing it short is the retard. Nio either going to moon or literally catch on fire so you‚Äôre prob good there as well. See you in two years when they expire worthless.

A few things. Most things got pretty oversold, and filled most of the downside gaps as well. I don‚Äôt totally buy the whole ‚Äúrotation out of tech into value stocks‚Äù spiel. Black Friday, Christmas, etc. are coming up and people want their position before earnings and news.

Also think Tesla will either fly or plummet by EOW. Hard to tell which way, but I have a lot of money riding on it breaking out to the upside.

Oversold. But also overvalued at 130. 90-100 feels right.
Dumb Algos ain't accounting for the irrationality of Mango and the GOP to tank this whole economy in the middle of a raging Pandemic just to spite Biden, and hope to come back into power in the next two years....

Cool man. Good luck. I‚Äôd suggest just looking for patterns in the alerts, using logic, or finding large volume moves and not yolo‚Äôing into the first alert you see. For example, I went into the ZM calls that he alerted on because the volume was gigantic and I figured there was a shift back to tech after the last few days off.

Bought on open and just rode it down. Cashed out within $2 of it bottoming out thankfully :)
Truth lol.
I‚Äôm probs selling half tomorrow. It‚Äôs valued at 25 billion right now. Seems like a lot tbh. 

I like pltr, but I wanna lock in some profits in case it tanks hard off bad earnings.

RKT PUMPING on Mad Money appearance!!! üöÄüöÄ
I swear I‚Äôm not lol. Just had to share because I never imagined being able to get these gains.
Get a load of this guy
PLTR STROKE ME BABY
Thanks a lot bro. What do u think those idiots are going to do now?üòÇ
read some books about wiemar germany, the banned kind. there were stories about it being common for teenaged girls to prostitute themselves and it being the only way to make a living. there was a reason the germans got pissed, didnt come out of no where

thats happening again. onlyfans is the tip of the iceburg here
These people are legit retarded.. like, every bad investment, Softbank has had a stake in..
No I‚Äôm just so fucking stupid i don‚Äôt know what the date is
I've made a nice chunk from them playing the Wheel the last month or so.  I'll hate to see my shares go if it stays over 11 by 11/27.
Lol. What? That age range has always been a period of sexual exploration for men and women. The people are the same and everyone would have done this 40 years ago if the technology were there and used as readily as it is now.
Peep his post history, he hasn't missed

One word
Bidet
Bought shares üò∑ of PLTR a few weeks ago and had a pretty good return so far, honestly might just withdraw it all and put it in an EOW earnings play. It‚Äôs pretty much a shortcut to the moon.
Oh I'm not OP, but I was inspired by a few solid PLTR DD posts to pick up 2000 shares last week. I have that same 11/13 $15 strike call protecting half the shares so keeping in the loop on this guy's gains
The amount of people that are buying into and riding NIO is insane what if all y‚Äôall fucks ruin it?
Bullish

The SUK 10/24c is gonna print
I bought and sold PLTR around 9-10, bought and sold PLUG at 4, bought and sold NIO at 15. I think the moral of the story boys is to buy shares or leaps in companies you like and stop fuckin staring at numbers all day. Better for your health and your portfolio

Don't even touch that boomer stock. The company is ancient. The growth is limited. They had to pull a CSCO, IBM, INTC and buyback their crappy shares to keep price higher.
wish i was that rich

Where do I get that
So basically they are a bunch of maniacs gambling insane amounts of money.  I would love to know their short positions - I read somewhere he has a massive short position on Donkey Kong but who knows.  Still kind of feels like these fuckers are gonna ruin it all for everyone at some point
Thanks for telling me to sell at the bottom. Zoom back to 417

Yup. I held strong yesterday and today, managed to recover most of my losses after I made $2K profit this week, still up $1K. Now we know, you can reliably buy the dip and wait for a rebound. Just don't buy too close to expiry and get IV crushed.

I would refrain the way you look at it as less political. I understand that Biden said he wants to legalize weed. But the bottom line is states are legalizing weed and Americans love weed. Hell even Texas has a ballot measure to legalize weed coming up. Or at least I think I saw an article for it.

My main point is that the weed train is coming big money is already entrenched and behind it. This is the real reason why we will be legalized. Is that large money interests are ready to make money off of it. Main issue with the weed market is the black market. Basically home growers who don't want to pay the expensive club fees. But they're also not allowed to sell commercially due to all of the hoops the states make people jump through. So what you get is a large black market undercutting the clubs and the profit margins of the commercial distributors. I've had a thought of a great that would basically be a drop shipping weed company. Growers would sell their weed through the app the app would pay some of their fees to the government so they would get their money AKA sucking big money's dick has it always needs its dick sucked. Then small growers could sell their weed and consumers can get high. When when we're all high and we're more rich. Main issue is just going through each county or States legal system.

380 is becoming a fundamental bottom, for something that has traded so high above a premium (1800 when fundamentals said 1300) i think 400 is a bargain only 20 over. could go back into the threes. at that point high risk tolerance buybuybuy. but probably 400 get in, keep more cash reserves in case it goes lower for more. ride at least 450 and out or so. unless your holding for potential 550-700 in coming year or two.
good, gyms were always stupid
I weighed pros and cons, went with non-wealthy.

Aye I only bought this morning
I‚Äôm feelin a FSLY recovery, big cloud name with covid coming back, down 40 percent from ath a month ago, been flat for a month after that huge drop off and these dips the past few days have instantly been bought up, short percentage is 17, float is pretty low, 84 million.... tech dipped and now back on the rise. FSLY 11/20 80calls big gains potential.... fsly is basically a meme stock, it‚Äôs ran up 20-30 dollars in like 2-3 days before, multiple times.... fuckin yolo üôèüôèüôè

Nice man ...was thinking of picking up 100K in shares to sell covered calls on with that juicy IV
Idk if he sold after the announcement then it‚Äôs not really insider trading because it‚Äôs public information.

Insider trading would be him selling all his shares before announcing the vaccine is a flop or something like that.

Who doesnt need the tax breaks? Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and the rest of the juggernauts, that's who. Some large caps, a lot of mid caps, and almost all the small caps *do* need those breaks. Its similar to the way regulation cripples small companies, allowing large companies to thrive after competition has been starved out (dont argue with me on that, argue with the US Chamber of Commerce https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/blog/post/regulations-impact-small-business-and-heart-americas-economy).

It makes perfect sense. Any restaurant that has "hot hold" equipment can make super-tender ribs and brisket. It doesn't have the texture of the real deal, it's just super tender due to the temp and humidity settings available on this equipment.

I have made several comments about a company that benefits from a current trend and need to pound the table......again. GRWG - Grow Generation. This company is referred to as the Home Depot of MJ growing supplies. They were increasing market share BEFORE this hype around legalized MJ. They stand to really rocket now with this additional catalyst. Reported earnings today and absolutely smashed earnings and raised full year guidance by a significant margin. Forget the Canadian MJ stocks unless you are playing them for a trade because at some point if the US legalizes, do you think Canadian companies will benefit? Been in this stock since single digits and follow it religiously, the prospects are huge.
If you want to make pennies
Very cool, very legal.   


And fucked Mango over to boot!
Idk but I'm not feelin great. QQQ peaked its head over 300 back in Sept and hasn't made it back there since. Seems like investors don't think the valuations should go higher than that, so they basically keep dumping when it gets up there and faking rotations into other shit.. then of course they buy back tech and on we go again.

Some of it probably is legit positioning for when things get back to normal, but I do believe many know that there ain't much worth buying right now
Fukt

What's a good boomer ETF that will win after the covid lockdowns start ending due to vaccines being deployed?
Pfizer is a pretty stable stock. The stock price isn‚Äôt going to the moon from this vaccine. They already make tens of billions of dollars a year, it‚Äôs not like this is there only revenue stream. Furthermore they pay fat dividends and excess profits likely will be paid out as such.

tbh it was just random, played fastly early 2019 so cloudflare as a competitor was familiar to me, i just noticed on the particular day that it was down 8% when everything was green so i just decided to buy hoping for a shortterm trade, luckily ive since then held my position. started with 600 but sold 150 at 56 before earnings

I'm just sad that it looks like my days of playing NIO are over.  For months whenever I'd nearly blow an account, or the rare times when I actually withdrew some money to secure my profits, I could always count on NIO to run into delivery numbers the first week of the month and bring me back.  The little pop it did every day at open was like a "good morning" for me.

I guess I actually have to think about which calls to yolo into now, which sucks.
Where can I look in there portfolio of holdings
Compare and contrast this POS with the Biontech couple who actually made the vaccine.

Probably selling tomorrow

Who me? How‚Äôd you know?
What exactly do you think the real GDP growth rate has been under Trump, excluding COVID? 2018 was his only remarkable year with 3.18% growth, the other years being in line with trends over the last 10 years. 

It‚Äôs been proven multiple times though out our history that Keynesian economics, or driving demand in consumers through monetary policy, is far more effective than monetarist policies. When large corporations were interviewed about the tax cuts under Trump they literally said they didn‚Äôt need them and would probably use it to buy back stock or increase dividends, creating the illusion of a healthy market. Consumer demand is THE best way to grow an economy, and the best sign of a healthy economy.

I advise you don‚Äôt listen to the goofy goober for any policy advice or stock picks
I wish we had robinhood when I was a kid, I'd flex all my tendies for show n tell every morning.

Do you put guac on it
They keep going up to where they would be if they crushed earning by 10x, then people realize it's overvalued and drop out. The only times this doesn't happen is when you rally enough retards into buying it anyway. The real question is: How many retards are buying this tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that? Then the next question is: Can I reliably predict retarded behavior? I don't have the balls for it, more power to these autists, I guess. To me Palantir is an okay company with a good pedigree coming from Peter Thiel, but it hasn't been making money, and I don't know how much money it has to make to convince people it's worth anything. It's a big black box. I don't feel retarded for buying it, but I don't yet feel retarded for selling it.

Yup, it‚Äôs also why you don‚Äôt target smart people for cults, or a lot of managers avoid really ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù (neurotic) employees. Stupid people are great once they are trained in their roles.

So much miss-information here. The sale was based on a combination of a filing window (possibly months long and out of his control) and a minimum stock price being reached. The bump on Monday hit the minimum price and it was within the window he had no hand in but was instead set by his 10b5-1 filing. 

&#x200B;

Basically in August he banked that when the vaccine news hits in Q4 (whenever in Q4 that might be) that the price would jump and he'd make good money.
Yeah maybe just roll some out. I‚Äôm happy with May because if we have a pullback or anything they should be ok

If the autists here understood what you wrote meant, they‚Äôd be all for it. Paid $60 premium for Zoom FDs, they tripled, then I sold call with a higher strike price and a higher premium than I originally bought it for. Could make a free $750 if Zoom continues to rally but if not, I still made 30 bucks off it
Why?
We see strong rotation into the NKLA sector
You can watch a thousand videos but it'll click much more once you've done it. Just don't expect to keep the first x amount you spend. See it as an educational fee. 

You can buy or sell the options themselves or exercise them. I would recommend just trading the option itself for now. Buy a nio or pltr call tomorrow morning at open and then sell it when it's up a certain amount. The options that expire in a week are more risky "lotto tickets" since things fluctuate so much. If you have a longer term feel for a stock then buy an option that expires in a few months or even longer. Risky options are cheaper too but you're much more likely to lose it

I think there‚Äôs a couple things to this. First, Biden doesn‚Äôt take over till January so we could see declining numbers by that time. Second, it‚Äôs easy to talk shutdown until you‚Äôre the one responsible for the economy. I could easily see Biden (and his advisors) reneging once they‚Äôre the ones calling the shots. 

Regardless, it‚Äôs all priced in already.

Gyms are definitely done for after the pandemic. PTON needs to lock more people into the ecosystem by offering a $1000 device (rower? upright bike? etc). 

I think gyms themselves will shrink, consolidate, and focus more on personal traning and classes than just a huge room of machines and dudebros
At this point I‚Äôm just gonna stop looking until 2022
I hated you at the beginning of the thread but u won me over
It's my favorite. The iron condor works well, too. The reason I like this more is because you get to take the full premium of the option. The spread removes a lot of the profit in a lot of cases. Some stocks it works better than others, though. Low volatility might be better for the iron condor.

Agreed. Most times the market prices a stock on future potential, not past revenue( which is why stocks crash even if they beat EPS but future guidance is weak). So I laid out the most optimistic bull case for Tesla to justify its current price. Based on revenue alone Tesla stock should be 100 odd dollars or less.

The interest rate part intrigues me. I guess you're assuming Biden would try and press the fed to raise rates?
The statement would be literal without the clarification.

He has to schedule his sales. How many times is his company going to be able to make an announcement about their drugs efficacy at curing a once in a lifetime pandemic? All it proves is he isn‚Äôt a degenerate like all of us. We probably would be selling 100% to buy NIO calls...

People who assume that people are gonna go back to the gym when they have a PTON bike sitting around and a $40/mo subscription are delusional. Sure there are PTON bikes out there collecting dust but theyre the type of people who will just keep playing the subscription fee. Anyone who owns a PTON and actually uses it doesn‚Äôt have much interest in getting dressed and driving to the gym (and paying $30-60 a month to do so), peeing and walking around in a questionable locker room, and dealing with people who don‚Äôt wipe down the machines when they can just get a good workout at home. With winter coming, this will be especially true regardless of the virus.

Palantir is the next god teir stock.
Put it in the wheel. Not a WSB strategy, but if you have the money for 100 shares: sell a put at a strike you don't mind buying the stock at. Close to expiration or when you're positive enough in the position, by it back and sell another one unless it goes below your strike. Then you let the put be exercised and buy the 100 shares. Then sell covered calls on your 100 shares until that gets exercised. Rinse and repeat. 

I do this with AMD. Sell a put 1-2 weeks out for $1-$1.50 and buy it back if it gets to like $20-30 if there's still time left on it. Been selling covers calls, but I will adjust if I think it's going to move in a certain direction. Not selling covered calls right now because I think it's going back up. I figure if it hits $85 in the next day or so I'll sell another covered call. 

One of the keys to this is selling your covered calls for a strike price above what you bought the stock at to ensure profit.
exactly the opposite my dude- they are made to keep the poor poor for cheap labor, a capitalist imperative *par excellence*. no 25k minimum is economic egalitarianism in favor of wealth redistribution.

You do it in increments. Buy a car but don‚Äôt pay it all off, pay a chunk to your student loans and then save enough to pay the loan amounts on that for 6+ months. I‚Äôd recommend a year. Then file. When you file there‚Äôs a form that allows you to roll over debts and continue paying on them. Do this with the car you bought but not completely outright. If you buy it outright and don‚Äôt owe like 30% left on it then they‚Äôll force you to sell the vehicle to pay other debts. If you have the opportunity via credit, I‚Äôd say pay off 30%. It‚Äôll make a sizable dent without to much outward suspicion based on your attempted payment history via all that stuff I said. IMHO

That said I have no way to know whether the strike price they're giving you is a good deal, because the prices your companies stock trades at is personally secret. How valuable is the stock and what's the strike price. Dividends?

Now there is more confidence and certainty in surviving.

Glad the right answer is actually at the top.
If a white business owner complained during the blm riots guaranteed they would be experiencing a loss of business or worse, have their business sacked. Promotion of black business over white business is racism against whites. Business owners won‚Äôt have a choice. On their investments, people have been asking for reparations for a long time. Not surprising to see it happen. I believe ‚Äúwoken‚Äù white individuals liquidated a portion to donate to blm. This the world we live in

It's an OLED TV which is supposed to be the best on the market. Usually Samsung TVs (Especially if they are much cheaper than this) are QLED or something like that which is just a backlit panel. When the TV is backlit, if you are watching a dark scene, the pixels that are "off" are still being lit, so you end up with a grey color. In an OLED TV, each individual pixel can turn on and off, giving you a "true black" color, increasing the contrast and image quality. Thats why its a little more expensive.
Unless there actually is a broad Democrat conspiracy, recounts usually only shift the vote a few hundred in either direction. Furthermore, Trump needs a lot more than just Georgia in order to win.

That was the catalyst for making you feel bad?
Every person?  Every single one?  No exceptions.  And never purchase at the low.  Never ever?  Ever?  Such conviction.  Granted it makes sense since companies "at their low" are usually their for bad reasons and don't have excess cash flowing in.  That aside, this is Gamestop, why are people talking about this shitball company buying back shares???  They'll hand that cash to shareholders as dividends.  Shareholders don't want the money wasted on shares that will just go back down as this company spirals towards irrelevancy.
Bought NIO today :)
You‚Äôve got a good father
How much
Nope because it‚Äôs old news
Just watch the candles tomorrow. If it continues to bounce up once it gets down to 18.50-18.75 then pull the trigger. Ultimately you want it go below 18.50 and stay they for a while tomorrow.
You have 10% left to make it back
Well, I've personally been following the space/sat security space for the last year and seen a big surge in interest. As for the rest, they acquired Vricon which I think is a good thing since there was a revenue decline in their imagery department.

They have one small contract now, we'll have to see if you they manage to grow it in something bigger.  They are attractively priced right now considering they won contracts back-to-back, which shows the company is somewhat ahead of the curve. 

Lastly, right now not a lot of space companies are being traded. Looking forward I can only see demand increasing. Will it be Maxar that will be taking all the money from contracts? I don't know since I don't work there. They trade at a nice multiple right now though which makes them a good pick for me all in all. 

Right now, I wouldn't buy Maxar per se, the stocks I just posted are merely on my shortlist. I am hoping for a December dump during which I can pick up some bargains. The stock might also be a interesting acquisition target, iirc the Chinese wanted to buy them a few years ago.

CHWY Calls to the fucking moon
One day at a time baby
I did get in.
Company prints cash. Has room to grow. Low P/E for a tech stock (28-ish). It's dropped 15% already just on fear of regulations alone which IMO is mostly unwarranted. Even if it dips more, it will probably be very short lived. My guess is it'll be back at $300, or close to it, by EOY.

My recommendation: BABA $270C 1/15/21
Good point YOLO
xpev mooning
This is also what I come for

is this a serious question lmao
And spy red AH
If you look at their track record pre-IPO it's not pretty. I think it will tank after their first post-IPO earnings report. Plus I just don't like the company so I don't care dude. Do your own DD and make your own decisions. I was just sharing mine.
Yup i got hella shares and leaps

Are you retarded? I would advise you quit trading
"It will bounce back, it's it's only at -135%"
Very simple, buy high sell low.
This talk about the Pfizer ceo selling some shares is retarded.
> You really don't think that it's an issue when a government is acting against the interest of the majority of its citizens? 

Not in the slightest, that's precisely the purpose of government. For example: It's not in my interest to pay for goods and services. Goods and services providers are a small minority, yet their financial protection is favored over the interests of the majority. Whether or not you find this reasonable is a value judgement. Seem like a weird perspective? It is. Just another set of values that differ from yours and mine.

> Even the WHO has spoken up about lockdowns having a profound negative effect, and serve only as a way to buy time while other actions are implemented. 

Fake news. The [original transcription of the speech from the WHO director](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---12-october-2020) says precisely nothing about "profound negative effects" of lockdowns. It simply recommends targeted interventions where and when needed going forward.

> Tightening restrictions in response to small upticks in cases is not the best move.

Your tightened restrictions in response to a small uptick is another person's timely targeted intervention at the peak of COVID infection counts. Again, a value judgement.

> They should just test people and perform contact tracing... We have the capacity and knowledge to do that.

Most people are open to this, the disagreement is about when this level of defensiveness is appropriate. The resolution to that disagreement depends on a personal value judgement.

I'm not trying to argue with you here, simply to explain that what seems reasonable to you might not seem reasonable to others. The government is simply acting, and your personal values as well as those of your friends, family, and acquaintances agree with you that is unreasonable. That doesn't make it a fact, it's still a personal value judgement.
It's so trash they can't even give it away for free
Yes that‚Äôs true!
So do I that‚Äôs why I said prove me wrong ha
Buy high, sell low. This is the way!
Thanks, needed this!
The recount will just solidifiy Biden presidency. Theres no voter fraud.

Y'all fucked up if you sold NIO today

I thought this said Opioids
There was that one time for a day or two you were up overall tho... and some people never taste that ever (me)
At that point why not just put it all on red or black
Why is that? What made apple different from say google?
Sure let us stone OP? OP are you stoned?
I sold csp atm with that iv. Don't mind being assigned.
some weeks ago ZS, FSLY, CRWD all had a +50 P/S ratio and NET was at about 28-30 P/S ratio

now NET is the most expensive one with 46.9P/S where FSLY has 26.51, ZS has 38.3 and CRWD has 39.8.

Do you think that the premium for NET is justified or not? Its just crazy how much NET went up compared to the its peers

edit: I‚Äòm holding 450 shares of NET with a cost basis of 22.70
If you zoom out on SPY or /ES to July you'll see we just got a triple top today. Either breakout to 375 (I don't see it happening given the insane 10 days we just had) or back towards 321

Maybe not profitable now, but it has a lot of room to grow in the future
You got scared that Etsy would tank after vaccine news. Like Zoom did. You took a nice profit. No reason to look back. 

With the same logic it was stupid of you not to long anything that went up today and not to short anything that went down. And at the same time you‚Äôre smart not to short anything that went up and not to long anything that went down. 

Oh forgot, fuck you.
Yes
i think a lot of people here could prove you wrong
I‚Äôm sorry :( I‚Äôll post again when there‚Äôs another day like that one where there‚Äôs obvious great entry. They‚Äôll be one soon, IMHO another weekish we‚Äôll have a blood red day where everyone will be all doom and gloom and that‚Äôs the best time to sell puts and buy calls
Imagine thinking investment bankers are traders smh
So glad I dumped Pfizer and Gild for Moderna today-
Tmo 11/20 490c
did xpev release earnings
I bought long term options into covid positive stocks that took a hit due to the vaccine news. I can afford a red day tomorrow.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how big the pie is. China will let Tesla invest money, train workers, etc. But it‚Äôs not gonna let a foreign company take the driver‚Äôs seat in the market when there‚Äôs a viable domestic competitor. Look at FAANG. Only Apple succeeded in China.
Really hope these gains don‚Äôt get erased tomorrow morning

I just meant in general. I haven't seen an earnings call in forever. But I remember thinking avengers 3-4 would boost a quarter.  Once I looked at their financials it's a drop in the bucket compared to theme parks. OC theme park has been closed since March. I'm.sure the others have too.

I think it's a pretty desperate ploy that will not work. so far the talking heads and mainstream media just seem to be ignoring Trump which is is his greatest fear of not being listened to. VIX may start going up with this it may cause some volatility who knows.
the fuck, investment bankers dont look at stock graphs
Stocks? BTFD
Yeah rent is down 25% in the bay area and big tech where I work are all considering/have already sent entire teams full remote. I don't see this suddenly reversing when the vaccine is in, companies figured out they can pay the same devs who cost $300k in the Bay Area $200k anywhere else and the employees are happier lol.   


So I agree long term zoom is fine. It'll all come down to the timing >\_>
Big brains would sell tomorrow and buy back in post-earnings. Unless u feel like risking all your gains on a retarded yolo.
Why is US such a communist country. If I want to lose my money they should let me
ü§ûüôåHope You're right. I just want to land one of the big winners x5 + by holding shares long. So far bought nio at $33, pltr $14.8 and thinking of whether adding xpev or more pltr after both earnings if there's a dip
Commons. The price floor is about $21 so it's an asymmetric bet with a lot of upside. I'm expecting a merger target announcement before EOY
That or Friday. I sold off my puts this morning, bought some cheap calls for the reversal, and bought puts at close.
My call lost value today, made no sense. Was intending to sell but forgot to do it before close
The earnings come out tomorrow. No way they justify this stupid valuation.
Bruh, cyber truck night was just as bad, if not worse.
Low vol today makes me nervous
XPEV/NIO looking good AH

LOL how you got silver on 'TA' for the VIX proves the retardedness of this sub. I love it.
an optimistic, forward-looking earnings report is already getting priced in, so i'd expect pltr to bounce around the 12-15 range until insiders finish offloading in December. By the end of 2021 easily a 20 dollar price IF IF IF the market doesn't completely melt down next year
If you have a Youtube premium, you can get Stadia free. Just look it up.

The future will resemble Orwell‚Äôs 1984 no matter where therefore PLTR is a fucked up but smart investment

Just $500. If it drills like I think, I‚Äôll be really happy with the gains, but not terribly upset about the loss.

I like ZM and I will be buying calls leading up to earnings. I just think there is another leg down to the next support at $350 before we go back up

11/13 $365p
Made 300% on ZM calls I bought yesterday. Made 100% on calls I bought after the morning pump. Averaged down on 500s expiring next week

I think flat. Pfizer vaccine hope for boomer stock is waning out like a Viagra from earlier this morning. Tech was way oversold (in my opinion) when nothing has actually changed compared to last week. I don't think we go up much though. Flat tomorrow and ~0.25% movement either way Friday.
How you lose it all
That is why i bought all of the Covid stocks that crashed on the vaccine news. Shit was cheap and they all regained 50% of their pre fall.
haha casual racism nice!

Ah that would be fine bro don‚Äôt stress about it. Hope it works out for u
I did it this year on Apple calls with run up to the split. Lost it all afterwards.
First point - I usually agree, but do appreciate having people to sell ridiculously priced calls/puts (like a 1/20/23 $4 C for $.65 when the underlying is trading at $.97).

While you are mostly correct, as long as it is $20.01 or above it is still technically ITM, though not profitable unless it is over $20.20 if there is no theta.

However, even at 1 hr before close this option will probably have some theta value if it is trading above $19.50. 

That said this person should probably sell a $21 C at open to ensure a profit and the ability to make more money if it runs up. If they can't sell spreads, they should just sell at open and either buy shares with the profit or buy a call much further out.
Got fucked on SND_L! Love getting railed by shit weed penny stocks
Fauci said their vaccine should be just as good as Pfizer
Say what you want but the implied volatility still sky high. Shares for me till that comes down.

8k shares. I'm fully strapped in.
I have spxs I'm hopeing for a lock down
imagine investing in anything other than tech
Or a big set up to dump shares when the other 80% unlock. This is my short term hypothesis. I will be long with this company after next week.
Invest don't trade. It's NOT about TIMING the market, its about time IN THE MARKET. Some people get lucky or get insider information. Market such as SPY, DIA, QQQ can give you average 30 percent every year. Hedge consider themselves lucky if they make 31 percent consistently every year.

Edit: Also don't listen to people here. Its a cut throat game. Listen to me and invest and in the market. Fuck these losers here they want to lose your money.
The timing between tabs is perfect
I've only bought leap calls and shares of RKT, the premium on calls is actually quite reasonable IMO
Yes absolutely
did you sell already?
everyones gonna call you retarded anyway but just wanted to give some quick tips

1. never buy same week expiry options unless you're planning on day trading, as you dont wanna hold those overnight 

2. if you have a low entry price, dont waste it on shitty options or you'll just lose the money. explore call debit spreads. if you are just trading premiums, debit spreads are the most cost effective way. They put a cap on the maximum you can make in a trade, but they also have much less risk than naked calls.

3. make a plan before purchasing an option. is this the best entry point? whats your exit point? how long are you willing to hold? whats the maximum amount you are willing to lose before selling? options have a a theta decay, so to put it another way, until you are making money, you will always be losing money. thats just how options go.

No way this is real. Most of my savings($950) are going into an option which you obviously have no fuckin clue how they work. Then you buy a call when you meant put. You must not give a shit about your life savings.
stop looking at weeklies

do thots still use snap? it seem like every thots is on TikTok now
Yes lol there's orders of magnitude less production than available market for now
That‚Äôs true. Just kicking myself for selling leaps unnecessarily.
Lmfao

Lol I said that after losing 80% on amd calls last month. Here I am about to buy MSFT 220c 12/17
This is why they quiz you on your options/trading experience and goals before they give you access.  

It doesn't have to be true but it's a CYA move so if some idiot tries to sue they can show in court that you fraudulently claimed you were an expert with 10 years options experience and they had no reason to believe differently.
I bought long calls today just for this
I‚Äôm putting it at 5% of my IRA
Bought the baba and snap dip and immediately regretted it. Holding overnight

Sir GRWG would like to have a word with you. Although they don‚Äôt sell weed just everything you need to grow it
SPY is literally a triple top. Monday didn‚Äôt count because we didn‚Äôt close where we opened. The triple top is now complete. 350 tomorrow.
Yeah like I said, it was stupid of me.

Hello me
PLTR for sure bro.  10 bagger in the long run
 Now your getting it
Lol, I'm up 60% this month. Haven't used any, was just wondering why my buying power was different for AMZN vs NIO. I can't use the full $1095 on NIO shares
In a non-regulated economy? Yes. In China? No.
Why do you buy leaps if you don‚Äôt plan holding for long term
Stupid question... but any of you guys planning on holding PLTR for more than 2-3 years?
I'm simply pointing out that the crashes in the 1800's happened, contradicting your statement that fiat currency causes (or caused) gold to change in value.
You sold to close right? You‚Äôd have to be  clinically autistic to hold this any longer with how close it is to expiring and the volatility of Tesla
Ive also been stuttering since that day
how can you people buy zm calls. i checked the greeks, and even a small otm one had nearly triple the theta it had from delta...
If it his $500 again I‚Äôm out.

I‚Äôm a champion paper hander. Was up 50% on my ETSY calls ($3k) and sold them today. Should have held on and would have been up another $900 by close. The worst part is they were leaps (March 2021). There was no need to sell ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
NTES calls
Best way to learn is to yolo. For example I bought $NKLA $22 puts in September, watched it triple in value, didn't sell, and then watched it expire worthless when NKLA inexplicably went up to $24. Did I lose $300? Yes. Did I learn anything? Maybe.

Today's lesson: [https://imgur.com/a/EWJsVYr](https://imgur.com/a/EWJsVYr) 

1) Never sell meme stock FD unless you have 10lbs to lose from stress

2) Never buy a FD - if you bought a ZM put at yesterday's low, you've lost $1500 by now.

3) Sometimes Diamond hand pays off. Only sometimes.
The good news is I‚Äôve survived every WSB purge on big up/down days. The bad news is that I‚Äôve netted a total of +$3k this year
I'm fucking norwegian and can't use Robinhood. What makes it worse is that fucking retail traders in Norway are a bunch of pussies causing no liquidity in generally every option.

Only FD's I can trade is in bitch ass shitty norwegian companies.
Sold my calls at close for nice gains, will probably buy a lotto on any weakness tomorrow

That's pretty cash money of you GME thank you üòé
Bro been losing my hair cause the stress
No. Stocks have monetary value because companies either produce items and/or offer services. Earnings reports and speculations on future said reports fuel what the public says is fair market price nearly every day. If that system were anything remotely like a pyramid scheme and therefore subject to a 100% collapse, the entire country would collapse with it.

Politicians and government employees are a drain on the economy prove me wrong
Some good AH volume at these prices for SPY and QQQ.
The fundamentals are strong as fuck, but since all the reddit retards love it, the market makers keep dumping it so our calls will expire OTM. Once the new billion dollar buyback program starts buying up tons of shares we'll see it moon I think.

I started playing in may 2019, had AMD at 28, SNAP at 14, ROKU at 110, FSLY at 21, NET at 21, PYPL at 130... if I would have just held these I‚Äòd be up 300% compared to being break even... smh.
Lol I feel that
Uh, you know they aren‚Äôt a new company, right? Just newly IPO‚Äôd. They probably have held plenty of internal earnings reports and board meetings, just now on a more fixed schedule and public.
 What are some examples? I might be a little out of touch.
IV is elevated before earnings due to uncertainty around what earnings will be. After earnings have been released a big source of uncertainty will be resolved
Thoughts on my $35C 1/15/21? Not sure if I should hold through ER and hope for a boom or sell on Monday after it runs up and roll out to May.
I‚Äôve spent the last two weeks moving cross country so before I left I closed all my positions except for stonks. I hate to admit it but I‚Äôve made more and lost less in these last two weeks than when I actually make plays. FML.
I'm kind of hoping it drops back down below 14 so I can buy more and then start some theta shit

I don't know and I don't want to know. My siblings and I were nearly drawn into an argument with them about this once when we discovered this and it was mind-blowingly dumb.
The best of us just pick ourselves up & go lose more money
I haven't done a lot of DD, but XPEV seems to be rapidly increasing its market cap and increasing the number of cars it's delivering. Nio has a focus on its battery-as-service program, but XPEV just seems to be trying to deliver a Tesla-esque experience for the mid-to-low end of the market.   


Given that China wants off of internal combustion engine cars as soon as possible, I think it'll certainly go up in the medium-to-long term. The price targets all look lofty. But I am not sure how earnings will go. Do you have a position on it already or looking to get in?
Were gunna meme it into existence
It was running up like crazy. I got calls at the eod. I can see it running up more.

They have never made a single profit since 2003.

I suggest you look at their S1. lots of insiders dumped their shares, some even at IPO.

Decay would cause a reverse split every 6 weeks
Both.
Damn imagine how rich you‚Äôd be if those were calls instead
FReddit doesnt mean shit to me. All I care is talking about futures for people that might be interested with a small account. Plus, Im not saying futures are the only thing you need to do to make money, like you said very few are successful. I just suggested a different alternative for options and it not costing a lot. 
And yes, it is all technical bullshit because that is the best way to go with day trading. Swing and long term you need to do research and other shit for it to make it worth while however, for day trading, technical analysis and basic indicators will do just fine. Just need time.
McDonald‚Äôs?
I‚Äôd go balls deep. Get in a low point tmmrw. Anything under 16.40 is a good entry point IMO
And yet the multiple on it is still up like 30-40% this year and earnings without any meaningful change in growth.
I am so fucking broke

Tip of the day: Get money, fuck bitches, and buy stonks
Lmao
Basically right now they‚Äôre on their 14nm+++++++++++++ process and way behind the 7nm used by AMD and 5nm used by Apple. They‚Äôre starting to churn out their 10nm for laptops and servers this year which is comparable to 7nm used by AMD but their yield sucks (read: lower profit margin). No 10nm desktop for a while from Intel. 

They‚Äôre looking at the 7nm nodes for 2023 which is comparable to the 5nm nodes used by Apple. I follow a bunch of commentary from server guys and it seems like their consensus back in June or so was that Intel would be boring as shit this year. Next year they‚Äôll look much better with Sapphire Rapids. If that fails, they‚Äôre fuuccckkkkeeed. 

They also have been developing their own GPUs which is starting to look interesting so they are looking to enter that game. I think their plan is to sell server nodes where CPU + GPU share the same memory architecture - check out Aurora. 


There‚Äôs way more complexity to the whole thing with their other divisions (Mobileye etc.) that I did not mention. However, I just think that they are working on a lot of really cool shit that could put them right back in the game. At a market cap of <$200B, I think they are a good value. 

Don‚Äôt take this as DD because it‚Äôs not so don‚Äôt buy based on this. There‚Äôs too many things missing and too many things that I do not fully comprehend.
I mean it's a paper loss until they cover.
Fucking whale status

You can use less margin for options then you can stocks because options are risky derivatives which incur significantly more risk then stocks due to the possibility (and in your case, probability) of rapid and substantial losses.

After earnings? IV crush
I'm thinking about only trading 0dtes on fridays using WSB to find the most popular tickers and scalping momentum whichever way. It's honestly the way I've made the most gains lol
Are the daytrading restrictions only for US folks or does it effects even if you just trade in US but live somewhere else
I think baba gonna be up big tomorrow.
Me too rip
sold that fucker at 30 before earnings.. dont know when i want to jump back
I also get that actually lol I guess u need to look at the iv when you buy them? Anyway I hope you make money bro üòé which company are we talking about?
I prefer a lock down of 3 months!
can't use margin for options retard
450 or 380 is fine by me

Actually 450 then tank to 380 is ideal lol
If we all knew how to we wouldn‚Äôt be here

nah, but it will hold 300 ish and recover slowly when it turns out the vaccine isn't suddenly going to make everyone who has gotten used to remote work flow go back to an office.
go on park your cash in the shitty neighborhood
I don't disagree.  It's the exact reason why I'm no longer a Lending Club investor.  I grew tired of people walking away from their loans and Lending Club not doing a damn thing about it.
options are non-marginable
Leave while you are still fresh
So Mango was right when he said they‚Äôd lock it down. You get what you vote for, hope none of you work retail!
You have your answer in the last sentence
Zoom put holders keep down voting lol. They thought it was going back to 250 lmao
Limit sell is at $100.00. Will adjust accordingly early next week if necessary.
Remember when all you retards said Palantir was going to dump cus it was a shit company with 0 profits and Thiel as CEO.

Position: 1000 shares at $9.5 avg. don't @ me
True that. Forgot about that lol
Short XLF
I don‚Äôt know if it beats earnings but imo guidance for it matters far more
if amazon shits the bed tomorrow, im just holding and going back to bed...
If you wait 10-15 min you can just roll out of bed and buy the top every time
CRASH AND BURN. Short Interest is rising fast. If it isn't then Shorters will be burned.
I still hope it opens green but I exited at $43 for fear of IV crush lol. I recovered the $600 I was down at open though so I'll take that as a win. Gonna wait for another dip to buy calls again.
Hope for the drop after ER then get leaps?
So what if I sell options in the both directions?  I make money 3 out of 3 times.
With my luck that means mega drill incoming

Hmmm most people are bullish here. My spy puts are going to do well tmrw

Why is my buying power different when I'm buying shares vs options? I have $1095 in cash which I have full access to if I'm buying AMZN. For NIO I can only spend $950 on shares but even less at $550 for options. I'm using margin btw.

I have 25% exposure to MAXR, what's your thesis beyond space is going to boom? There are multiple players in this space, why MAXR?

Yeah that‚Äôs how this and last week feels like.

I got spy puts
Bought 500 spy 11/13 370s at close - am i going to be a millionaire?
Just holding my breath, waiting for these EXPE puts to print.  Those gains won‚Äôt hold.
Best case scenario for me is that it hits near $19 on Friday, I don't get my stocks called away from selling covered calls, and then I sell more weekly cc's next week for fat premium.
buy and hold PSTH until the end of the year if you'd like to have $30000. or just follow wsb advice and have $3 in about two weeks
Lock this bitch down..

First tab is good. The money is green and pointing up. Other tabs have bad money in them. They are red. Point down to. If the money is green (and line pointing to listen hole) its good money. If it's bad money it points to talk hole on phone.

I don't know why your considering the other tab options. Stick with 1D "call." Others have bad charts imo.

I fucking bought spy 360 calls expiring today instead of friday fuck me
Lol.. salty that your post isn't getting the karma you thought you deserved?

Fact of the matter is that most people here won't be better off buying futures over options. You barely even explained your "strategy" which is probably some bullshit technical analysis anyways. You *do* realize that the market makes most of its moves overnight? But to trade 24/7 you can't just put down $50, you need a higher margin. Regardless, the gains you're experiencing won't last long (the volatility we're seeing isn't permanent). Eventually, your "skill" of trading will run out and you'll realize there is no easier way to make money. And if PDT and 24/7 are your best reasons for trading futures over options, this just shows how little benefit it actually provides. You're basically day trading with extreme leverage. Can you disprove this statement? Options allow you to buy longer dated expirations, giving you the same effect as buying an equity long term but with leverage.

Anyways, unless you can find a way to profit day trading (which very few people can do successfully) share it with us or else options are clearly the better alternative. What are your strategies that give you an edge?

I made a lot last Wed and Thurs, but fell asleep on the couch before market close, so I couldn't sell.
I kept buying more with fake profit on Thurs, so by close, I was leveraged breasticularly.

Friday open, I watched 2 hard days of diamond hands getting testicularly ripped away.

I was long to m when the scan vaccine announcement was made, so I made a bit, but lost some.

I'm now long SPY/ES 28/11, with just enough leverage for me to lose just 95% and avoid margin call.
I'm going to lock myself away until the 25th or so. This thing of buying and selling daily like we at flea markets only benefits the MMs, and that hot-shot savant at JPM with the algo that keeps selling & buying from 1000 autists per yoctosecond.

Moral of the story?

A savant is worth 1000 autists
Yeah they pay, but I don‚Äôt think the payout is worth the gray hairs you get from seeing 4% gap ups
here I am, shorting zoom again. Will I ever learn? Probably not. Fuck :c
I don't think I'm gonna buy anything but leaps ever again. I have like 0 stress now lol
Why does it feel so damn good when an option you're holding goes ITM?
I was thinking just hitting an ETF but hmmmmmm

I have no predictions for ZM tomorrow. It either is flat, smacks 441, or goes below 370.
Such simple minded fool. Tomorrow will be both up and down as fears begin to set in and job reports come out. Both bears and bulls are fucked till further vaccine news which is not until the end of the month. Good luck chasing sectors as some will pump and dump every other day

Xbox one release was around nov 23 2013, gme traded around $48. There was a run up from March to oct from 24 to 55ish. 

In Jan 2014 gme dropped to around $34. This year‚Äôs console release is probably priced in. 

It sounds absolutely absurd in believing in this company outside of potential squeeze from console release but I have a different thesis. 

Brick and mortar toys toys are closing down (Toys R Us) and GME has been selling collectibles / toys, basically filling in that gap. I think it may become an e commerce one stop shop for all things nerdy with some physical flagship stores. I need to do DD on gme since I bought in the squeeze hype but I believe that this company may actually be a long hold for the next 2 years. I‚Äôll probably close my calls at a loss and buy leaps in addition to shares. 

Call me autistic (I probably am) but this could be a turning point for a beat down company. Imagine you bought amazon shares when they were trying to transition away from selling books. 

I am also strongly of the opinion that management has prevented the short squeeze because execs all know each other and when you‚Äôre an exec level employee the business has a relationship aspect with bridges you don‚Äôt want to burn. The only catalyst that can cause a short at this point is if more big name hedge funds pile in like what happened with Herbalife fight between Bill and Carl.

I've been doing this full-time for months now, as a professional trader (investment banker?) I can confidently say nobody needs two monitors to stare at all day. I do 100% of my trades from my phone and I promise one small bright red screen is more then enough
Hold that $20 position but I would sell the others  on Friday
2 weeks is just enough time to get asymptomatic
ok, so weed stocks round 2?
Didn‚Äôt know what to go in on, will just buy a call on whatever is red tomorrow
Interesting. Thanks
Tech 100 dropped from 12400 to 11500 in like 4 days
people stupidity, thats why we should go ham with tesla this week
Firstly, if you don't understand a financial instrument. DON'T BUY IT.

Okay so you bought a $20 for 11/13 and you spent let's say .20 a contract = $20 in total.

Therefore your breakeven price (price of the premium you paid + the strike price ($20)) is $20.20/share.

This means if the stock is not trading at $20.20 on 11/13 you're OTM (Out the Money) and your option expires worthless.

Now lets say the stock is $21 Friday. Your option is now ITM (In the Money) which means you will have the ability (and the right) to buy 100 shares at $20 a share from the person who sold you the contract.

So you'll have to spend $2,000 to buy 100 shares, but you'll instantly make a .80 profit per share (since you spent .20 or whatever on premium) yielding you $80 cash.

Does that make sense?

What exactly is the case for rifle companies right now? Isn't everything priced in in terms of the Biden Bump in relation to gun/rifle sales? I would love me some suggestions on defense companies, been eyeing:

- AJRD
- CW (bit late on this baby though)
- RTX (did you know they invented the micro-wave, their quarterly reports are amazing reading material)

High-Tech Defense worth looking at, with all this cyber-warfare these are primed for a run in both good- and bad times: 

- MAXR (Department of Defense has been eyeing space safety for some time now, just look at the Hack-a-sat challenge at Defcon, did you know almost all space internet traffic is unencrypted?)
- MRCY (net-income up 112.6% QoQ)
- MANT (IT and tech services to the U.S. federal gov. I mean, can you really go wrong with Biden coming in? Every adviser with a head will be hammering on the importance of cyber)
Lol.

Nah. I made good money last weekend from the market. $100 is nothing. When you make easy money it's even easier to spread the love. Wait.. Maybe this is the beginning of the downfall. . .
Sounds like a pretty whack bear thesis
You damn right im advertising for tradovate, it is simple. BUT YOU STILL MISS THE FUCKING POINT. Market time, SIL contracts are $55 after market they are $100. What is your point? They are 24/5 and slow and have a higher possibility for profit return. Fuck no, if i was a billionaire i wouldnt be talking about SILVER.
QQQ
How‚Äôs AH work exactly?
Remmeber when you guys said RKT was going to 100?
Are you selling calls against all those shares ?

Whats the ticker for nasdaq is it as good as spy
Theta fucks shit up hard
Can some explain in short term from here to January what is going to prop up this market any further ? I just have a hard time seeing spy holding above 350 or pumping towards 370 anytime soon. Vaccine/stimulus could be the catalysts but will we really get either by January ?
Corsair? Corsair.
grwg looking to run tomorrow BIGLY
Don't pussy out! Too late to join the PLTR crash gang.

Yep, baby yodas head is right. Xpev reports tomorrow before market open.

i used my professional photo editing software to draw the lines, calls on snap
Sold CC tranches at $11, $15, $18 üöÄ. Down 1200% on $11c 11/20 ü•Ç
The market rallied from that news. We already knew that and everything pumped EOD.
$20 was the strike price, thanks
Why the fuck is Amazon dumping? FFS, just pump it to 3500 what the fuck
Got me 100 shares of GRWG before earnings . Will be holding these for a while
Apples and tomatoes my dude. The comparison makes 0 actual sense.
Latina
sit, im trying to sleep on my gains bed
350 after 5x1 split
I'm saying that there wont be some dramatic short squeeze like everybody is talking about. MAYBE it will hit $20 per share by mid february but unlikely to have any dramatic movements. Shorts will have to cover and they will lose money, but it will be gradual so not really a squeeze. newest reported numbers show that there are less shorts than before and they are likely slowly covering. Stok has been hovering under $12 even with console release, debt buyback, partnerships. the only catalyst left is earnings which will not have a lot of the potential that people see factored in, so betting on a short squeeze is pretty dumb. If anything, hold positions for the next year to see gains. short term calls are burning money and LEAPS are way overpriced.
Nah why dump that shits gonna be worth so much one day
So annoying that if you just comment a couple times in a few jelqing subreddits, a couple weird fetish subreddits, and a couple other weird subs reddit labels you and puts them in your ‚Äúactive in these communities‚Äù sections. Like fuck off reddit, don‚Äôt try to label me as some sexual deviant
They are literally THE weed play by a long shot. I can cop bud from a few blocks away, but the person that grew it needed resources. Needed GRWG. I‚Äôm raising my PT from $15 to $26.

anyone else ever stop and ask themselves - why am I such a retard?
Yehawwwww
What's your time frame
Never sell in strength, sell in weakness. I bought Nio at 9.65 and sold at 9.70 cause I got tired of waiting for it to move up and sold as soon as it did. Look where it is now
I thought almost everyone got it the first time in March?

Yea I‚Äôm seeing crazy buys. One that stuck out the most was 11/20 $44 and $43.5 volume was ~40,000 combined today. Also noticed 12/18 $55 7,400 volume. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt gap overnight so I can get in but I‚Äôm guessing it will.

Stop talking about your hand like it‚Äôs a real person. They may call someone on you.
If the flight is successful and the road to higher and higher valuations will likely continue.  The next big catalysts are still on the horizon.  The Richard Branson and the start of commercial operations being the big ones and that is happening this winter.

I bought a 300 Call 1/15/21 the day it hit 265 and flipped it today for about 15%. As for the impending regulation issues facing BABA...there was a similar situation earlier this year (I can't recall details) and it didn't seem to impact growth in the following months. Right now I'm skeptical of short term expiration calls...my HIGHLY amateur opinion would be to pick a December expiration.
Shit, I accidentally bought stock in Pfizer Total Landscaping
Because I knew it was gonna go up on Monday and I was trying to exercise when it peaked around 2pm and robhinhood was holding my call and I canceled it and fumbled the bag hard

thoughts on infysos
It might have both. Maybe.
That's gotta be wrong, 6 million is 60% of his shares? He only has 10 million in shares? The CEO of Pfizer? Either he only just joined or they're not counting unvested shares and unexercised options. This is way too low
Two commonly used ultra low freezers come from ThermoScientific and PHC Corp. But let‚Äôs think this through, they won‚Äôt be adding these freezers at point of use (hospitals, primary care offices, field Ops) because of cost and they already have ultra lows if they need them. This isn‚Äôt the first medicine requiring -70c.... They can use dry ice and styrofoam-like coolers for temporary storage. Much more practical for field use, and for shipping / temporary excess amounts of vaccines.
You‚Äôre an idiot. I‚Äôm literally saying that monocropping is only as popular as it is so we can sustain our livestock population. If no one farmed livestock, we‚Äôd have significantly less land being farmed, in general. There would also be no reason for us to grow so many singular crops, therefor proving a reason to diversify crop varieties.

Yea thats not new.
Obviously you just suck at trading if you traded futures and then agree that options are better. Other than a yolo play would options be better than futures? NO PDT rule and 24/5 so you can do them after work. You are more of a clown than my spelling
I still feel like Nio has got to have a mild correction. Not comfortable getting more yet. Maybe an after earnings sell off will open an opportunity.
Not to mention I‚Äôd guess a lot of them had their cost basis at $1.50, $3, etc. Going from a 3-6x bagger is a huge difference from a 5-10x bag. Talk about Xmas bonus
you should be selling calls on Thursday before the close brother.

THETA GANG, RESPECT
Boomers don't like pot. They voted to criminalized it.
I mean, the last console release was the Switch, which had notoriously weak inventory levels. True though, that may be an issue with the current PS & Xbox launch. Both will suffer from weak inventory due to COVID.

But stock price isn‚Äôt entirely tied to reality right now. If people THINK it‚Äôs going to go up, because in the past it HAS gone up.... then it might just shoot up regardless of business practice and fundamentals.

Might be a long term play, but I‚Äôm selling if that shit passes 35$ a share lol

I don‚Äôt anticipate it going the Amazon route and hitting 3k a share, but DO remember to come ridicule me in two or three years if I‚Äôm super wrong.
It‚Äôs up 14% today and over 3% after hours how high do you want it lol
Are you joking? Death numbers going to be 3k a day by December
I saw that too, the 95s

I like $MPC since it is a refiner and they have a big bundle of cash from the Speedway sale. Also, MPC has that juicy dividend. These days I like buying refiners.

Why would PLTR have an earnings report? Please don't have an earnings report. I want to keep my money. It won't have an earnings call will it?
Apparently this doesn't work.  Has to be an opt out or cash account

This is gonna sound super rtarded but I‚Äôm holding reyn calls through earnings tomorrow, I‚Äôm hoping they do a tupperware move and sneak up on everyone. Volume is absolute shit but maybe if they get unbelievable gains everyone will try to fomo in. Up 90% so far
you go all in? you don't DCA?
I also bought SNAP 40 calls but mine expire next week

Stopping your broker from lending your shares out means they can't lend them to the shorts to cover, and they can't lend them to the shorts to short further (which they use to push the price down and stop runs).

Its small for a given shareholder but when multiple people do it, it matters.  VK only had 5% of its float "unlocked" and trading when it squeezed.  We have a lot more than that
No I think that biden will handle it well and peak uncertainty was in march not now
If the stock dipped to 39 and then jumped to 42, your 50 weekly call will still suffer dumbass.

Yes, you are clearly accepted into the world of wall street bets being a degenerate. A thousand return is not had with SIL IT COSTS ONLY 55 FUCKING DOLLARS. 
No the difference between me and a currency trader is that I would bring in more returns that them. Fuck forex and the forex futures. 
You didnt read the whole thing did you? I suggested a future with legit no movement and has high probability of returns BECAUSE IT COSTS $55 AND EACH TICK (which yes that is what it is called because you are sounding like im talking just straight air) MAKE $10 GOD DAMN DOLLARS.
Yes , been a fool to change that .. Thought I  need hold a few days for bigger gains but ..

Lolz was greedy and bought 11/13 calls. I knew it was dumb but all I could imagine was the potential. Pretty classic. Sold before FSLR and ROKU earnings and regretted the hell out of it. Decided not to sell before RKT. It is what it is
Nice. NIO to the moon

Imagine selling at $9 and feeling happy about your tenders. 

Imagine keeping an eye on the stock and realizing that you gave up 80 percent of your potential tenders to Robinhood mouth breathers.

You don‚Äôt understand the gravity of the situation do you, no cause you‚Äôre a degenerate
Oh right
no, you buy and not ask
I sold one of my 14.5c 11/20 and regret it
Speak for yourself. This is a hobby.
If earnings got leaked itd be at 40 already
They only go up
Exactly!
Thurs: IRDM, DQ, LPX, SPY should be settling down now that the election‚Äôs over... December is put season when it comes around but calls all around rn
So glad I sold my spy puts and rolled em into plug calls at 5 mins before close.

I don‚Äôt think she knows what social impact investing is really... like earlier this summer she wanted me to start a position on ETSY cuz she was anti-Amazon for like a month üò´.. honestly though, autistic me should‚Äôve bought some ETSY calls..
No, I didn‚Äôt miss anything. You are transparently advertising for Tradovate and trying to pass off their intra-day initial margins on their futures contracts as something magical, when most futures brokers do the same. And if you were such a futures trading genius you wouldn‚Äôt be here shilling for them - you‚Äôd be focusing on managing all those billions you most definitely have.

dark days are bullish
No I think its pretty well established that this sub is retarded.
How much did you put in. ? I bought 4k worth of calls yesterday. Im Currently getting 6k in profit
Maybe from giga-tech to tech that != a monopoly.

So you‚Äôre buying LEAPS for Jan 2086? What broker do you use??
No.

I should have loaded up on shares fuck. Went in at 10.55 along w some calls but I could have easily retired if I yolo'd my entire cash position

The true cruelty of this game is that even when something does well, you get made that you didn't buy more.
I did this for CCL. Months ago. January here we come....

0dte fast and hard is the way. Its been my scariest yet most profitable strategy. In and out same day and only 1 day to clear. Just gotta be right
It needs more time to consolidate, maybe even find a lower bottom ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 300c 2/21 üíéü§û
until earnings dump
Loses hundreds daily, but won‚Äôt pay $15 for some action‚Äî typical wsb priorities I guess üòÇ
Idk but I wish I would‚Äôve bought PLUG instead of SBE.
Tech is the economy at this point
I just heard of this company called NIO.  Don‚Äôt know much.  Looking for more info.
I hope you're right, it's like 12% of my portfolio
Still plenty of time before Biden takes office....
I'm pissed my stop loss triggered yesterday
Could have been a 200k investment.  But ya, I'd buy 50k shares if I could afford it.

As a young investor I found Stocktwits first and did not heavily invest in nio at 2 dollars a share because of their ‚ÄúDD‚Äù
Bullish
ZM is so undervalued right now. 
I‚Äôm forward looking to 2085 when we have our next global pandemic that‚Äôs even worse than this one. This is a forward looking market and other investors are gonna jump on soon too.

1700 shares checking in. Ready for lift off.
It was up 11% yesterday. I have reservations because their last positive EPS was because of LIFO inventory credits. I think they just shuffled paper around to call it a win. Perhaps next quarter they can attempt to redeem themselves
I don‚Äôt trust holding a damn thing after earnings
Is there a Mexican backpage or what
been doing this as well

2 days out of tech, 1 day into tech, 2 days out of tech etc
I saw this and smiled, what is the news?!

Are they all ugly?
Yeah but you're asking a bunch degenerates right now... Take the profit. You think it can run up more then buy back in with your profit or less.
PLTR is one of the Apples or Tesla‚Äôs that you wish you would‚Äôve bought shares earlier. It‚Äôll become a new defense industry titan.
Easy money...buy mid morning after it crashes to 38...sell at close. Rinse and repeat
See near bankrupt companies or companies still losing money are the most risky so these companies move 20% on a random day. PLTR and movie theaters and mall reits have something in common they are losing money so they need more funding lmao.
Were you the guy on facebook trying to trade it for a WLW

Guess I shouldn‚Äôt have sold my palantir calls today

My only move tomorrow tbh with everyone is FOMO'ing into PLTR at the top
that would be bearish

can't imagine a defense contractor leaking info to be a good thing
I got fucked on my leaps and recovering nicely
Yep, rotation from tech to tech+

fuck me dead this is poetic.
Yes the one's in mexico. You can get super model for a $100.
Who wants to tell him?
wait how is biden gonna pay it off
logic is telling me to sell my calls before earnings but i got $16 calls for cheap lol definitely selling my $18 though
Thats why i didnt get it this year, maybe later with a good discount
My 20c 11/20 lookin good on the comeback
Yea buy more if u want to double down
You‚Äôre fine tho lol
Got some Amazon and spy calls yesterday...feels nice seeing green.

You listed corn twice and forgot a bunch of others but either way........ free up farmable land for more monocroping lol?  Also these foods are horrible for people to eat at least on a gmo level and inflammatory response and other metabolic reasons. You need to read into regenerative farming , also there is no shortage of potentially farmable land in the us so taking up 80 percent is a meaningless statistic. I do agree that the current farming system in place needs to go but ULTRA PROCESSED mystery meat insulin burgers are not the answer if anything it‚Äôs a leap unto a direction I‚Äôm very concerned about. Also I know as of now we don‚Äôt have the resources for everyone to eat ‚Äú organic and paleo‚Äù but that is the direction we need if people want to be more than fat miserable reddit dwelling head cases.

I read this as baba and thought this dude is FUCKED
Yeah we all knew it was BS when you started with GF.
Other acceptable answers include: "Because you sold at a loss before it rocketed to $300."
They‚Äôre playbook is literally gathering vast amounts of data and selling analytics to companies

Thiel is likely against big government doing this but as long as it‚Äôs a private enterprise he is most assuredly fine with it
If it‚Äôs a Republican Congress, he‚Äôll run into issues. Georgia has a runoff election coming up in January I think that could flip the senate (?) blue

If nio is profitable it will soar.  But don't expect it.
This is gayer than 2 dudes fucking another dude

Stop. Please.
I lost it on my first option tho üòî I was at 453 Monday but couldn't exercise it and now I'm at 99 with no calls. I was thinking of doing 44C 11/13 but I wouldn't be able to sell till Friday
What are you even saying, are you saying that shorts would have covered after hearing this theory?
I'll probably go for 4. I think probability of printing is extremely high so 1 is worth it

What the fuck is there to he fishy about? You lowkey sound like the one person you says that trades and only puts iron condors and short strangles on AT&T
VLO and PSX move more and in the same direction, and have much more to recover compared to MPC

What's stopping you from going out and learning a trade that could make you wealthy one day?
It's a tech startup with famous SV leaders that works on something nobody else in tech wants to do (defense, because it's evil/racist), so they'll quickly corner the market 

And $15 a share is cheap when other tech companies are in the hundreds, so it's gonna be there, whether its logical or not

I'm still bullish on Covid boys. Numbers been lookin amazing and if this trend continues, we are going to see a pretty strong beat on cases/deaths numbers by the end of the year.

Might have to a suffer a big red day once the market decides they're gonna care about this for a day but it's gonna more tech mooning after that.
I'm a noob here. How does one play the earnings reports? Is there generally a sell off beforehand and then either a massive swing up or down based on the report?
Feel you man just broke back to even the other day. Jumped the gun on a few things that fucked me hard

I heard startup culture is a meat grinder unless you're a partner in the ownership
I tried to find it myself! Couldn‚Äôt. Some similar stuff but not the exact one I saw some time ago. Basically men mostly look at face, tits, arse / hips and calculate the breast/ waist/ hip ratios. Then look at hair, mouth, eyes.

Bro, you are retarded.  Theres no guarantee they could develop the vaccine.

And if they released this news weeks ago, Democrats would be saying they politicized the vaccine.
Def buying outs tomorrow at close. I expect a dip and then a good entry for leaps
Finally out of jail, right now I am eyeing:

\- $MPC March Calls

\- DOCU

Might as well get some calls on drilling companies 6 months out. Can't post them here cause' of the new market-cap requirements for tickets? Long is the way, of that I am sure. Do we get a December sell-off, most likely yes. Am I going to play it like a bear, nope.
So if NIO is profitable where are we expecting the stonk
You retards are going to ruin my PLTR, just like you ruined bitch TSLA
Just 1 haha
What are the odds of Biden making a change in the taxing structure? Doesn‚Äôt he not need congressional approval to make changes?
It is a funny company to go public.
Tech has been mooning because vaccines are going to take at least a year+ to get out to the public

Jk that didn‚Äôt happen üò≠ but I did start and increase my PLTR position though
Yea I think there are some interesting pieces on it (some really fucking dumb ones too but still) but when they do shit like that damn it's hard to support them.
Not perfectly, but not far off. Around 42.50 I think.

Thiel has spoken openly about his hate for mass surveillance and things going on at Google
Dammit had 100 shares of pltr that I sold like a month ago after making like 150 in profit. Hands made of silky sweet buttermile
Yeah I blew it by selling my BA shares last week. You are correct, you win, I hate myself.
Probably made four+ day trades within five days.
Short interest is over 30%.
Yes, the McRib is BACK
How many?

I got 25 @14.0 and I'm kicking myself for not starting at 100

My plan was to scale in when it dipped back to 10, so I only bought a small portion to start
I like that idea. I‚Äôm still waiting for access to StockTwits api for sentiment, even if I need to pay for it. They aren‚Äôt wanting my business apparently.

I‚Äôd have so much more money if I was patient
Just bought a watch so that‚Äôs probably why
my point was that you can still average the cost out since there was a massive drop, if this is a company that was attractive at $300, why not buy it at $266.64? when it's even more attractive with a better P/E ratio

Oh wow, what position on NIO?
IF it dumps, it is going to be a RKT and stay low like the POS it is.
if they go below 10 usd i'll blow all of my savings on intel. I wanted to the same on 5$ amd but family talked me out of it. Fuck. Them

I have a feeling rocket will blast off soon gonna load up on dec calls
I bought shares of  PLTR under $10.. **AMA**
Yes!!
pltr after hours üòéü•∂
You probably sold it to an algo brother
by selling my $400c that i bought yesterday a minute into market open because i didn't think it would run up any more today smh
Me too
Yes when Jeff takes them over as AMZ holds 23% or 20 cant recall
Anybody else jump on some ZM puts? Feeling tomorrow is going to be bigly red
Ouch. Positions?
Fuck we probably had the same positions. I sold like a pussy as bitch EOD
Rkt?
I like my bears salty, with a hint of wry
You could take it as a wonderful opportunity to get into theta gang activity, since any covered call you might write would be a gain, and since you've had "held" the stock since it was $6 a share, you'd be able to weather virtually any downturn in the stock.
Thank you, butthole.
tomorrow ... bigly!
Deep state shit
We all know BABA will be 280 soon so don't worry about it.
What is so surprising this is normal for first earnings for a newly listed stock. This is all speculation. They didn't do IPO to avoid all the potential issues with the company so they can't get sued like other IPOs have been for not listing the proper warnings.
Palantir a hold after earnings?
Time to get back into IPOB? Cathy seems lonely
Earnings are going to disappoint and a ton of shares unlock 3 days after. You can probably go even further OTM for next week and hit.

Seriously though, I think I might take out my initial investments and then just keep profits in.

Looking at the last minute of closing on FVRR stock, all of the transactions were made at exactly $106.7 can anyone tell of that was one large buy or sell limit order that soaked up all that volume? Buy or sell...

how much stock is he awarded annually?  This may just be him diversifying. If he gets awarded millions in stock annually, it's smart to sell part of it to diversify.  probably also has to pay tax when the stock vests no? so needs to sell to pay tax.
All these big tech companies are almost free money with stocks. BABA might not be as guaranteed as FAGMAN, but it has bigly higher potential.  Long BABA and TCEHY stonks.

Holy shit. How much? You need XPEV to tank tomorrow because theta is going to murder you
Maybe y‚Äôall will finally shift the job mentality from NIO to PLTR, except PLTR is American, unconstitutional, and is a fundamentally sound company run by Papa Elon‚Äôs very good friend Peter Thiel (cofounder of PayPal)

Do you think it will actually hit 50
Nope
Hoping pton shoots up
Very good. GL, Mate!
Actually of all of the companies on the NYSE I think PLTR is the single most likely one to be involved in a government conspiracy
lol all the articles i‚Äôm reading on PLTR can‚Äôt explain the move at all
It's only 3$ per day and the premium on options are insane. Not worth Imo.
Thank fuck for spikes...some idiot bought my 11/13 TAN @78p shorts when etf is still at 74.

Anyway, you missed the Idea. I choose a slow moving future and then suggested it's mini WHICH IS EVEN SLOWER. 
You complete missed the point of what I was saying. So what if leverage is added, do you even know why? Because in the mini has less silver in the contract. Don't give me this bullshit about it's just "something other than additional leverage". It is more than that, it is a proper opportunity to make money and you missed it
Wendy‚Äôs is fucking delicious I‚Äôm going there now.

You belong here
Its not a loss until you sell. I'm still holding my 863 shares and selling covered puts until we moon. I think the fundamentals point to a higher valuation and if the market decided to treat this stock as fintech (which it probably should since they're one of the most profitable companies in the fintech space) then I could see it tripling.
I will cum all up inside my pants if they gap down and drill.
True. Its just insane to me we keep having these 1000 point swings in just a couple days on nasdaq
nope

Yea I'm just joking around. I know what your post meant. You can always even sell some upside short term calls too if you are ok with the stock possibly blowing past the strikes.
I know this is a copypasta, but imagine spending 150k on a volatile stock ...and then setting a fucking stop loss that tight
Buying a PLTR 14.5p 11/13 to short term hedge smart? I have long calls

wtf is PLTR and why is it mooning. Is it involved in secret government conspiracy cabal stuff

its gonna be resistance but dont think long term, optimism is too big and boomers want in, now that tech will rally again (after vaccine hype fades), spy has all the ammo to move forward, 380-400 i think by december
was this before or after DKNG went up 3% today?

It's such a small position I don't even care. The thing is definitely gonna squeeze back to 10+ in the future and I'll sell for a couple hundred when it does.
He might be my brother. Lol
But I can't predict the future. It could moon after ER. If it tanks, I'm OK with it. My shares and calls are in the green. I'll probably sell my calls tomorrow though even though there's still a lot of time left.
NIO be like:

"Tesla. Look at me. I'm the Tesla now"
Because people hate thiel for doing the evil tech things out in the open rather than in secret
I tried bull gang, it didn‚Äôt work. I tried bear gang, it went even worse. I think it‚Äôs time I join theta gang
Come on XPEV...don't let us down with earnings tomorrow
Thanks. Splitting this by ETF and company would be nice.

Begger = chooser

VIX bounced of 52 week low today. Y‚Äôall know what that means right?
When I moved out of 0 DTE options + day trading using cash account strategy .. quick in and out 
 , had a positive account

When I reverted back to buy and hold  in the last week , lost  money
Just watch... thing's gonna pop and not in the good way
So u have shares LOLLLLLL u just called yourself retarded

Jesus PLTR, I was gunna sell my calls today but then I decided to inverse myself
Yep, I just sold everything. I doubt it‚Äôs true, but if it is, god help us

Up 500 today which for me is great
I done fucked up
Clearly rotating back into tech again. I sold so much of my hospitality, travel, and retail earlier this week on the run up. Sitting with mad cash now but don‚Äôt know what to do. I hate cash gang but there didn‚Äôt seem like much opportunity today.
How do I get a new drug dealer with all the bars closed? üòî
pltr has some insane momentum, probably going to keep 1 of my calls as a lotto, if it dumps im loading up again
The way I see it I either gamble with my life savings on the stock market and buy a house or I'm trapped renting with my crippling student debts until the heat death of the universe
I wish I could've done that and not be retarded. I panicked sold at 39 my 43C 11/13 option to cut losses and it went back up. I could've gotten back my losses smh
why would you short shares instead of just buying puts? 

they're hard to borrow and you pay interest

Stop regurgitating garbage propaganda.
Too bad they already took all my money. Knew I should have sold before earnings. Saw green you know it happens
spce call horders. when we going to the moon?
i mean the worst that can happen is the scammer now has your address. you didn't even have to put cc info or anything lol. we about to get all the hoes with some robinhood socks!
Real advice here, ride the amd wave. Seriously it's been really easy for me. I might go all in next time. When it gets to ~75 buy. When it's gets to ~85 sell.
No the one from wolf of Wall Street
I hope you win big
LOL @ palantir, this is insanity, I made a lot of money though, thanks

Why does PLTR cnn forecast suck? Any ideas?

1k shares at an average of 13 baby. It‚Äôs going to be in the hundreds in the coming years
what strike and exp?
Massive $CPCE reversal today. Yesterday put/call ratio was at a 6-month low at 0.37. Now at 0.52. People loaded up on puts today.
Awfully bullish in here on the lowest volume since 10/9. Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Stay safe out there. üôè

Boberic
No I‚Äôm trying to lose money fast to make my wage feel more important
Yeah, I've been rolling covered calls for sale every Tuesday about 2$ OTM for the following week. I'm at about a 200% annualized gain if the stock stays flat.
When will they ever learn
Are you exercising early to avoid IV? Or holding til close to expiration?
Great strike you got.
Iran is continuing to build up its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and now holds more than ten times the amount permitted under the 2015 nuclear agreement, the United Nations Atomic Agency said in a report - WSJ

There is a chance ü•≠ might smite the mullahs on his way out.
That sucks.  Do what I do - lose it all in the first 30 minutes and get it over with.
I just sell covered calls to retards like you
Some say it might be a bull trap.  But hopefully it‚Äôs a bear trap
I will somehow financially recover from this and then YOLO again into SPY puts
Could go either way
it will print retarded brother
Broke even for the month today, this means 2 limit down tomorrow and my stock getting delisted
Sold my shares at close today thinking earning were after hours today. Classic wsb shit
no shit
Gotta walk away and stop trading once you make money broski
May just chill between 22-23 by Friday üò£ lets see
The plan is to get mega gains tho bro that will make my life better
Get out of here you ameripoor
Ban.
I got some today should I be holding for a while?
You think it'll respond positively it negatively post ER?
I‚Äôm super high on in long term so I bought about 500 shares right after IPO.  This quick ascension it has had the last few weeks we‚Äôre not expected.  It‚Äôs gonna keep landing a bunch of DOD contracts though so I only see it going up long term, but it might pull back over the next few weeks.
Best of luck, when do those expire and what strike?
Ok I‚Äôll bite... what‚Äôs the rumor?
Lost out on 4k paper handing my zoom and docu weeklies i bought yesterday üòå

Fuck.  He‚Äôs a Mets fan too!  Can‚Äôt even baseball right!
amat thoughts?
What's the put to call ratio?   Looks almost the same just scrolling through a few strikes.  MM prob gonna pin it flat eow and fuck everyone.
I actually realized that today. It shot up this morning and then started plummeting and stayed flat before EOD. I‚Äôm hoping it follows the same trend tomorrow so I can get out. I honestly thought it can hit 25 again in the near future which is why I bought 11/20 calls, but now I kinda regret it.
same
Link plx
I BELIEVE
I'm long 200 shares so good luck.
You mean it‚Äôs not gonna go to 20 by tomorrow?
what
hm
Do you have puts
probably
Imagine wasting your entire off day watching stocks and making money, just to lose it all in the last 30 mins. ü§°ü§°
The fact that this sub exists speaks to the fact that nobody is paid good wages anymore. We are trying to make money fast to earn these lost wages.
Lol
I went full retard.  Will definitely post update depending how it goes
Yup
you mean yolo YOLO your way back to Wendys
I‚Äôm happy for you. My goal is to experience rbis lmao
Was thinking exercising them turns into intrinsic value so if earnings cause short term hype to drop they'd lose less value and since I'm long on the company or would still be worthwhile. 
But then this is my options high risk account so may settle for leaps.
Ngl my covered calls would appreciate this
Who didn‚Äôt buy calls on GRWG? Smh
Sold my weekly spy calls for a minor profit. Anyone who held, enjoy the massive moon we probably get while I punch myself in the bathroom mirror.
Wtf are you talking about. He was withdrawing cash from the atm...said banks weren't going to make it...said Hilton was going to 0 all the while buying it. Did you watch the same episode?

and for hollowing out to hide a small hammer in
think so
That's weird logic. I'm pretty sure you then would want to sell your shares and calls before earnings in that case and buy them back afterwards.
Buy vix or vxx calls and hope or buy straight up strangles. Buy double calendar for a safer play. Buy triple leverage ETFs.
I had 50% of my portfolio in long puts for a Q1 recession. Sold when covid started to make news for like 60% gain. 2 weeks of slow selling would have netted me about 600% gain.
Bro, you had 10k shares. That‚Äôs pretty damn big for a retail position.
It's my only green line because I'm a retard and invested heavy in pot stocks before the covid vaccine.
Why would libertarians want a surveillance state. Don't they want the government out of shit
Fisker warrants up huge recently...+40% on Monday. 

I prefer the warrants to the common stock  because you get the leverage of an call option but minimal decay

Not nice, Dre.
So there was an article on Barrons that I wanted to read but I needed to subscribe, well they have a 4 weeks for $1 offer so I did that. Now I went to go and cancel the sub so I don't get charged $9.99 in 4 weeks once I forget about it. However something straight out of /r/assholedesign you literally cannot cancel your subscription, there is even a thing that shows you have auto renewal on but there is no way to cancel it. You cannot even remove your payment method. I had to send a support ticket to cancel the sub and to have them remove my payment method.

Just a warning to everyone else, fuck Barrons bunch of cunts.

A lot of resistance uphead but I‚Äôm in the same boat

Bought down CATM today. Bought into AUPH. Holding BIIB and BLUE longer. Basically flat (down 0.05%) today.
We need more fear mongering in here
Vix sure is low as fuck for record cases. If the case number doesnt dip back down vix should pop. But it will only pop if the world makes sense so 50/50
What?
Can confirm, was up 5K last week and down $4300 currently
Doubtful. You can remind me as well if you would like.
He will continue to be up
same
That's unfortunate. I bailed on mine the second dip down, looked away and looked back and shrek was erupting all over the charts
you're coming out of the closet?
What makes you say that? Something happen?
Or it's just the 2011 top all over again

Tried tellin people. Was free money ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Definitely, the fact it hits exactly 13.18 is proof. My limit of 13.20 even had few shares plunging to 13.18 from the sell off...
its okay brother, it takes time to heal both our souls and accounts
Wow tease much
Was thinking that too.  Thanks.
Not high enough (sp)
Same. $1k that could have been used well
Up $3k today, can‚Äôt wait to hold past earnings and lose it all.
Guys I bought 10k worth of boomer call options, can‚Äôt wait till next year where I found out if I‚Äôm rich or lost 10%
I have 420s for Friday. Bought them at $2 before the run up. They went to $10 and I sold most. Kept a few runners.
I have PLTR shares and long term calls. I kind of want PLTR to tank hard on their ER like -20% so I can buy more shares and long term calls.
I sold my amd calls this morning out of fear AmA
NVDA 600 call give me strength
Raymond James analyst said we should buy it just after market closed. That SOB should have made his statement pre-market not now

NLS is amazing to play if you have day trade capabilities. It's followed the same exact movement like 24/25 days. Shoots up at open from PM, crashes down in a couple candles, creeps up till 2:00-3:00, and then dips EOD
It‚Äôs broken, just sell it now
Oh man, this rumor if true is going to shock the market tomorrow.
You could just tell me.
RIP my fellow RKT call holders. My account is down to its last 500. It was nice knowing you. Currently long going back to the day job
It'll only need 20% by tomorrow morning at this rate.

Want to switch my Broker but damn IB is some retard shit
It is not uncommon with stop loss. Has happened to me. The thing is you have to be more active in this case and be looking to the candlestick data plot and buy again if is in a solid uptrend. It could go the other way and you will be happy you didn‚Äôt lose more.

I think MM are waiting on good news before they let spy go past 360 and retest all time high.
It reached EXACTLY 12% down and not any further. Usually if anything drops more than 12%, it's a huge sign of something major like bankruptcy, this is nothing more than luck bs
Unless Disney Plus had a monster quarter that masks Disney's issues with their movie and theme park business (similar to how Amazon's cloud business masks losses in other segments within the company), you are likely to be right.

Those are always hedges, usually to reduce margin actually. Anyone who's actually shorting woulda just shorted the index in most cases.
It's not even paper hands, I was in it for long term, but a - 12% in a day definitely means something is wrong (imagine Enron, or bankruptcy). This - 12% is EXACTLY lotto for me and its not even on any news. Pure bullshit luck

spy is probably going to retest 360 tomorrow before it either breaks through or rejects it (I think its going to reject 360). Also way too many spy puts so I don't expect spy to be too down, MM wont allow it. Hope you bought spy calls.

Chad sold all of his NIO stock after the close bringing the RSI down to oversold levels. Now Chad's looking at NIO up .75c and currently overbought from where he sold. Poor chad.

yep, futes pump. trade flat during day.
Oh that one is close. You probably woulda made a tiny bit (maybe like 1.4x type of gain) if it opens here at 37.2 tomorrow. Unless it goes down more from here, it wouldn't have been much so don't fret over it.
Whats the difference between BYDDF and BYDDY?
no, it worked 90% of 90 cases...they haven't completed sampling all the 1000 cases yet. hence attempt at pumping the stock before all the results are in.

Funny post check out Wildwesttrades they had some interesting takes on this
You set a stop loss at 5% under the value of a highly volatile stock. That is no one's fault but your own. Per a shit ton of research, set it at 15-20% if you use it at all.
The app probably sends data on me and decide to knock me out exclusively... Just my luck.

How else did you explain it dropped to exactly $13.18 when my limit is 13.2...
Haven‚Äôt looked into XPEV as much so can‚Äôt say. Kinda view it more as a bandwagon hopper trying to take advantage of all the EV IPO hype but it has some big backers
Now THIS is loss porn
If he anticipates more growth he should still close out this contract and buy a new one with a higher strike.

Personally, I would sell this one, pocket $2,400, and buy 45c 4/16/2021 for ~$1100 tomorrow.

Pretty much under no circumstances should he hold this specific contract though. There are much better ways to remain bullish on NIO that would allow for some profit taking and still leave a greater potential for return.
I had the $35 puts
Proper name should be NIO210115C100
Do they have it on cassette?
Heavy volume on DDOG puts, plus way overbought on the RSI. Was 85p 11/13 a good move for tomorrow

Volatility isn't always a terrible thing, we just had crazy news on the foot of a presidential election and we are going into holiday season.  Something's got a give for or against the market, and with Black Friday around the corner, tech and retail may see some absolute gains, or not idk.

360 open probably for no reason.

Anybody know why FPRX is up like 400%? I heard they had some news about cancer trials today, but this seems absurd. Should I buy puts??
Fastly
Um, i personally find stop loss to be worthless. Yes scenario like what you said could happen, but more so really just, as long you have confidence in the company, you ought to just hold on to the stock, even if it drops, as stocks tend to recover and yes, they ‚Äúonly go up‚Äù. if you aren‚Äôt confident in the company (my feeling due to the reasons you gave) then maybe you shouldn‚Äôt invest in it. If you do purely to speculate a quick buck, maybe calls are better suited for spec play? Stop loss is even worse with options due to the huge swings both ways that can occur in relatively short amount of time.

Plus i feel like stop loss is way too conservative to belong in this sub hahaha. Yacht full of tendies or account is blown, middle ground is weak.
Would you say NIO would be a better investment compared to XPEV? Or do you think both companies are equally good choices

when Moderna reports similar results for their vaccine it will be another insane rotation trade. probably in next week or two.
Got this one on the day which was surprising even for me. The whole market is just broken rotations pre determined by MM. Just gotta guess it.

150,000 shares of SPY were gobbled up on the last minute of the trading day today. Green tomorrow at long as jobs numbers aren't horrific
WHEN!? I have 100 calls next week
GRWG I FUCKING LOVE YOU BABY
Indeed, a 3X ETF is certainly the safest bet one could make.
Tbf the app did exactly what you told it to do so its the last thing you should blame lol.
But will it have a retarded run like today? We shall find out
William and Sarah. Will they, or won‚Äôt they?
Yea

What a fkin pussy, if I waited 15 minutes my act is 8k instead of 4.5k
About the rumor of news?
You got a fucking taste
Your a mad man, take mine.
I remember when we had the crash back in March and I was down 10k, which was half of my portfolio. Now I am up at 50k and lose or gain thousands daily. Options are a hell of a drug
Tolerance unlikely. I've used it a half a dozen times a year at most, probably even less. 

You seem quite keen so maybe try and see how you perform on a mock test for the material you prepared? I'm also not sure how effective recall is.

Shit I thought WSB finally got shut down. I couldn‚Äôt connect to it since market close. I‚Äôm such a degenerate I went into withdrawal. Did that happen to anyone?!!
shut the fuck about fucking SPCE. if you have 1 cent in that company youre a certified retard
Shares are fine. I‚Äôm talking options. I would average down on shares too
I have NIO calls but there‚Äôs no way XPEV will break earnings. It‚Äôs a brand new company. Have they even delivered any vehicles?
i fuck wit both
You would have closed out all these trades early already for close to 100% profit; especially BA. It doesn‚Äôt matter how the company is ran, they have a monopoly on building aircrafts and hold large military contracts. No one can casually break into the plane manufacturing sector to edge BA out.
I‚Äôve been buying bottles of goldschlagger, pouring the liquid down the drain but collecting the gold in a coffee filter. Each bottle I get like 10 cents worth of gold.. if I buy enough bottles someday I might be rich

Same, im holding 11/20 calls  thru earnings
GET BACK DOWN HERE SPY
I have a feeling that xpev goes up, but nio dumps after earnings just to fuck all the calls
It‚Äôs what happened to the tattoo kid I would expect nothing different here
Give me a play tomorrow boys
Let‚Äôs get a few things straight: Masayoshi Son made one good call a decade ago but recent moves show megalomania and poor judgement. He is not using his own money here: SoftBank is using largely small Japanese investors / pension fund / institutional money to indulge in disasters like Wirecard in Germany and We Work in the US. 

The ‚ÄòVision Fund‚Äô is Son‚Äôs vainglorious attempt to be the ‚Äòorchestral leader‚Äò of tech, AI and the 4th Industrial revolution.   


He is a dangerous nut job.
I do have the money.  Do I want the shares though? I guess maybe for the long term.
Sounds like they waited to be profitable to IPO
BYND $170c 11/20
spy is probably going to retest 360 tomorrow before it either breaks through or rejects it (I think its going to reject 360). Also way too many spy puts so I don't expect spy to be too down, MM wont allow it. Hope you bought spy calls.
You ain‚Äôt lying.

I have $20k.. What's my play for tomorrow
I swear nobody have worse luck than me.

I bough PLTR yesterday at open at $15, wanted to hold long term but set a stop loss of $13.2 (12%) in the event of an emergency like Trump Tweets, HQ burnt or they suddenly declare bankruptcy.

Guess what, it dropped to $13.20, forcing me to sell my 10K shares and plunging the price further to exactly $13.18, the lowest price for the day. And now its freaking heading towards 16, after the pure bullshit to force me out... 

I know I'm unlucky but I feel betrayed, betrayed by the trading app, the pure bullshittery to dive down to exactly my limit to force me to sell and now decide to shoot for the sky...
At least a meow then splat. kss down 10%
This bear ass sucks, so loose!
well if I sold months ago when people told me to like I did my other options I wouldn't be at 3500.
Hell yea

There ceo sold shares because every ceo does. Benzo just did too . Yes i am aware there not much money in the vax market. They are doing it as it will not only give em free marketing, but also gov will pay n they can up the cost  . 

There vax needs to be done 2 times the first month. The guarantees atleast 2 vials bot.  

They have quite the amount of staff working on this to not make them look like a ass.
This dip will be irrelevant if XPEV beats
I don't give much of a shit really. Just wasting time on WSB being retarded as always. Great job with the predictions

Uh looks like kidney bean water... very gross
LMAO glad it worked out
Also short squeeze possible?
Even their king daddy quarter was like $10.50 EPS.

You're paying ~$3,000 for $10 of earnings. That is not a good deal at all.
The correct way to do this is to get your gain, and then set a stop loss a few percent below it. That way if it runs, you keep making gains. If it goes down and confirms your worries, you get out anyways.

The biggest issue, I suppose, is overnight gaps down.
Ok damm u right 

Maybe we gap up another 10% those and docu and net are my only Positions rn  so if they gap up again I‚Äôm gonna be hyped!!
No matter how good ER may be, I still think they are selling off after. Crazy run up into earnings normally leads to big sell off
My puts were so happy until the last candle. And I was as well. Now I‚Äôm fucked unless we get a -2% day tomorrow which is impossible since everything is bullish again.
lol no
It's still neither of their issues. They worked on and made it. The storage condition is what they determined the vaccine can be held at to keep stable for long periods. Distribution is not their problem.
The SEC is interested if insiders buy **before** the stock goes up or if they sell **before** the stock crashes.

He sold after the stock when up. No shit he should sell.
Salty zoom put holders got fucked.
AAPL and SQ single handedly saved my entire portfolio today. We‚Äôll see what happens tomorrow

It would have been purely un-american to be red on Veterans day.
I am pleased, will see how it holds up though
Yeah PLTR has a reputation of not making money and last week its been mooning like crazy regardless. I'm anticipating a train wreck but I have been wrong so many times before.

If you have ITM LEAPS way the fuck out, then you also hold.
It should be great for Pfizer if vaccine works. $19.99 x2 every year for billions of people!
Na this is a company you buy shares in and just sit on, not a bad suggestion though.

It is still hundreds of thousands, and also incase of an emergency like company bankrupt, HQ burnt or something... Imagine Enron and LB when that happened. 

The biggest betrayal is lowering to my stop loss just to force me to sell and mooning afterwards. I'm devastated at such bullshittery, its not even an emergency just pure bullshit luck to reach EXACTLY my stop loss. I  have already miss out on hundreds of dollars on the gain s from 13.2 to 16 and may miss out more in the future if it does goes to 30 eoy...

CYBERTRUCK BABY
Hold until late November I still think it has room to grow before the inevitable dump
Tomorrow/after.
If they‚Äôre short dated sell and roll them a few months out minimum
Gonna be accumulating PLTR puts tomorrow after riding calls in the last week. They will dump after earnings.  
  
Source: Their S-1: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm  
  
There is a reason there have been so many insider sells after IPO. Some even on the day of the IPO: https://fintel.io/n/us/pltr  
  
They said they were never gonna IPO but after looking at this retarded market, it made sense because retail will hype everything up.
no problem feel free to follow me at [link](https://twitter.com/BillionairePla2); I just started trying to find potential daily plays. Still trying to lock in the right criteria, but quite a few winners thus far. Black swan event has somewhat skewed the longer dated plays though.
Yessir!
Duck yeah
Yes, options. Weeklies to be specific.
Who‚Äôs waiting until PLTR‚Äôs ER before buying??
BABA should have a good day tomorrow
yes. easy. 

find a stock. 

think real hard if it's going to go up or down. 

Pick an option for 11/13 expiry and then pick the correct direction.

Then invest just the right amount to make back more than $12,814. 

Done.

One vaccine that won't be widely distributed until Q1 next year at the earliest is not "the end of COVID". It's the start of the end but we still got a winter of record cases and rising hospitalizations to get through.

I'd start rotating to some boomer stocks end of November maybe,  and def wouldn't be buying dips on stuff like ZM or Peloton. But as long as you're not in the obvious wfh COVID stocks, tech will be fine.
Fuck China and fuck you.

You too!
Why does CNN forecast otherwise?
Damn üòµ
incremental restrictions are being announced already, though seemingly not enough to really pump the stay at home trade into high gear

i think there is a possibility that a vaccine on the horizon might actually make lockdowns more likely, as well as more palatable to the general public, as there is a supposed end date in sight
169 >> 3500

It‚Äôs 20x your initial investment. 

The fuck do you think?
Idk, man. I feel like if they pull of this upcoming flight, and I would say the chances of success are pretty decent, then I think there is some near term money to be made
After ER, I'm gonna buy a few hundo with the trendies I make with the calls I yoloed.
For example, I bought 200 contracts of 356c 0dte when we sharply sold off to 355 at 2:50pm. 16k‚Äî-> 23k in 20 min
Bear booty is back on the menu!
Yup
Come on. Are you really unable to see how some people may have developed an opinion that they don't want Trump in office anymore?

I'm Canadian, just an observer, but I can see how some people support Trump, and I can see how other support Biden. 

You can't even fathom how someone can have a different opinion than yours. That is unfortunate.
Sir, those are $5k a piece
so when is pltr earnings again ?
Proof or ban
I loaded up on WTRG calls in march and im up 950% percent. Cost me 150 bucks.
I'd sell and reload against earnings if you're up all time. If you aren't, sell and withdraw
Fisker knows how to market themselves and has experience. SUVs are the biggest market for vehicles in America and fiskers next move is their affordable SUV. Plenty of analyst agree it will at the very least double. I own 100 shares and i got leaps today.

Isn‚Äôt it funny? Once WSB stops it moons
It hasn't reached yesterday's open.
BABA is a beast of a company that dwarfs other giants. It's only going to go up from here.
Who made bank on zoom calls?
>is too popular to be Epsteined

China has literal concentration camps, you think they'd give a shot about killing some billionaire?
It‚Äôs so funny how the meme stocks that die off in WSB go up bigly. Look at what GRWG Just did. I bet RKT explodes in a week also
Tomorrow evening
What happened,?
Welcome back
LMAO chill chief, I was teasing your balls. The only ticker I can reliably predict is $ROPE
Inovio
Got a quick 20% gain. Held one to see if there's a gap down tomorrow. Tea leaves work sometimes lol
wow how do you all get banned
'its not that hard to be right' LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Ban
Sub was bearish on zoom lol
what about lab freezer companies?
They have no cash and are diluting their shares, people are this retarded to buy it, id say $30
NIO swings are easy money. Just buy more than a week out
Get a loan from Lending Club.  Use it to pay off your other debt.  It will hurt your credit, but you can pretty much walk away from a Lending Club loan.  They're not aggressive about debt collection because it's not their money.  They don't sue.  Your bad debt gets spread across a bunch of investors and Lending Club is not allowed to give them any information about you - so you don't need to worry about being hassled about it.  

Make sure you tell them that you are consolidating debt.
Same plug been üí§on
Its also a pretty thinly held stock, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of volume on it, so its easy to pump and dump it.
Will my 300C print? CCP pls
> playing purely bullish or bearish is retarded. 

you've offended this entire sub
It ended at 15.96 it‚Äôs gonna first tomorrow drop dude, it‚Äôs a trap!
As soon as I saw someone say loading up on puts for zoom I was so quick to sell me  poots

Hey so I bought a NIO leap this summer for 1/15. I got in at $5.92 per share and paid $169 for the contract which is now worth $3500. Wish I held the 2 or 3 other contracts which we similar but oh well, I didn‚Äôt. Glad I held onto 1. But anyway, should I hold this or sell?  Also I‚Äôm wanting to get into some more EVs and Solar plays but is it too late? I feel like NIO has so much potential long term. Thanks y‚Äôall.

When is earnings? I fucking hate earnings
Fuckin sell em man, company has exploded this week based on nothing. The real climb isn't till 2021
Yes
Options on futures or just regular contracts?
Red leader standing by
Dammit it just is!
$PTON has a serious logistics issue that is going to come to light. They basically hand off their bikes to XPO Logistics, who completely screws it up. Don‚Äôt believe? Go to Peletons social media and look at the comments on any post. It‚Äôs a majority of people very angry how they ordered their bike months ago and it hasn‚Äôt come or came broke and now they‚Äôre stuck waiting months for replacement parts. 

It‚Äôs a huge mess and the word is going to get out. 
I don‚Äôt own any of their options but have ordered a bike and gone through the ringer getting it.
I got my SPY 11/20 270 calls as well
It's all hinges on XPEV's earnings. If they smash it, I feast tomorrow
Everyone out here talking about NIO this NIO that and I‚Äôm just sitting here with the $PLUG
yeah
True
tnx NVDA tnx ZM
On days when we open red, 9/10 times its best to just buy in the morning, we usually end higher than we started

The amount of money you can lose in a short amount of time with 0dte's is also astounding.
PLTR seems like one to go long on, even despite its recent moves. The volume is insane. More importantly the call activity is crazy all the way up to 25c+
And yet you got a 15 day ban whilst I got a 35 day ban.... curious
Down 10% but NIO probably going parabolic if XPEV ER beats
makes sense, there has been a fairly substantial shift back to an analogue feudal agrarian society in the wake of the Covid vaccine

Fuck it, I‚Äôm holding my PLTR calls through earnings. Let‚Äôs get this bread
Day late and $43,000 short if true.
Has anyone done DD on XPEV? Are they supposed to have a good earnings
Did ya win?
Holy shit guys I figured out a cheat code for options, you can actually sell them while they‚Äôre green  before ER‚Äôs and the eventual -99%, $600 back now only $18K more to go before I‚Äôm even for the last year!
That‚Äôs wsb in a nutshell tbh

It‚Äôs not that hard to be right, you just need the balls to pull the trigger
I believe in you
It's whatever the magic 8-ball says.
Right, puts are usually at their lowest due to IV crush and the slow climb up. Earlier today, I got puts at 0.25 that jumped to 1.17 on the lunch day dump. Observed this for the past month of green days, though, I'm not sure how red days interact with the model.
Sorry I got out of the gang today. I am ready for my reverse-initiation.

I have some PLTR calls expiring friday, sell em tomorrow morning or hold through earnings?

Might be right. 11/20 is a little close to ER, may not have enough time to rally big

If you bought at yesterday you would have been fucked... It opened at $15 and dropped to $13.2 in 1 hour, you think you can stomach that?

How did mfers know there would be a vaccine pump from Moderna? Up 8% during the day? Lol then small cap really rallied 1% in the final hour. This shit is so fake.
Sure. Here ya go. https://ibb.co/4gRQpmB

Shooting straight up as usual lol.
Down $15k at 88% overall. Solid work on buying the wrong puts and then the wrong calls. Time to start the ride back up with my $1000 deposit.
My problems aren't temporary
A 12% stop loss on a $15 stock? That‚Äôs on you brotha
One too many zeros there chief
Could PLUG ever become a 400 billion dollar company? ü§î
Say that to me and VRS. Shit earnings with -500m revenue in a small cap manufacturing stock? +15% same day earnings is released?surprisingly the options I bought a week after special div payout had a similar percentage payout ratio as the stock i held. CRS would‚Äôve been +400% had I bought the 5 month calls, but I wanted longevity and CRS is a long position for me due to where I bought it and potential outlook of the company. I‚Äôm fine losing 40% because I‚Äôd still only be down 10%.       

Crs day after exdiv: $16 while all the other small cap manufacturing and tech companies are almost back to normal? +33% later...

Snagged up 4 11/20 $352 spy puts. Hard to believe we stay above 355 rest of week
:S same lol.... lets hope they pay off :( hahah
RKT.  They committed to $1b buy back.  That's half the float at $22.  Stunning earnings.  Might double down on my Dec 25 calls.  Personally, I don't think rates are going anywhere anytime soon.  Maybe a housing slump tough?  Don't know
Aged like milk
Yea the 400k and 200k buys were interesting
Yes, but depends on how far otm they are.  Also, considering some of the other meme stocks people pile into for earnings, iv in the 100-120% range isn't the craziest.

Buddy, you're not allowed to consider alternative outcomes here. Even though during 2020 a ton of outlandish shit that no one would have ever predicted to happen has already happened there's no possible way something else could occur that would be unexpected. Once we get past Dec 14th and reality sets in then you can come back and try to pitch your DD.
ohbb
I have an eztremely small portfolio (1000 dollars) so ill probably sell by earnings
took some profits on PLTR and put them balls deep into PLUG leaps 

inshallah great tendies will rain upon me
Fuck it.. just grabbed a few puts

For real tho I fucked up on drugs for my 20s. I'm currently in trade school and work in food service. Was paycheck to paycheck until a lucky 3.5k between stimulus and one unemployment check (among other things) and got into robinhood when I had 5k or so saved up. 

The 7k isn't what I started with, I keep putting as much as possible into losing positions to get the high score!
if zm is big green tomorrow, buy jan 2022 300p and get ready to retire.
Yesterday morning it crashed $1.80 in like an hour, you can count on that happening tomorrow too
My robinhood acc says I‚Äôm up 4200% today lmao wtf it‚Äôs a sign
Did anyone check out the volume on 290p and 300p for next month? Insane. Why?
THIS JUST IN

U r fukt (probably)
no volume for the day. I guess no bidder could match any ask price. they were asking for 10¬¢ not 12¬¢

Disease is spreading faster which means they now have adequate sample data to determine effectiveness. They are just announcing they hit that mark faster than anticipated.
God damn market only goes up. I guess I need to only buy calls every god damn day!
Having to many options can make you overwhelmed you have no idea what to do. Should've stuck to making 5 - 10% a day instead of being an absolute retard.

Anyone else notice how lately reddit goes down the last 5-10 minutes before the market closes and then comes back?
Holding Jan calls. Sold weeklies for a loss so I don't get IV crushed. May buy again if there's another pullback. 11/20 calls should be free money though
I made money as an Intraday Bear...but there are times to hibernate on the overnight game
You miss about on the gains, I fucking loss because I ordered at open the only fucking day it crashed from $15 to $13.20 activating my stop limit. Out of all the fucking crash it had to be that one time, not fucking today... Fml
O.o

My $16 11/27 calls about to be printing... brrrrrrrrr .
AAPL put at close we‚Äôll see
Puts were the way to go fellas
The trend has shifted, autists. I'm the gayest Bear here, and loved September and October. Every rip was a Bull trap, and it was hilarious. But it's apparent the inverse is now true. The post-3 PM dips were both bought up and we almost ended at the intraday high. Don't fight trends. Be bisexual, and propser.
What did I say earlier before closing?? Zoom gonna pop bigly tonight!
It's a bank holiday.
I can‚Äôt imagine having only $7k to my name.
I hope you‚Äôre only like 17 if that‚Äôs your life savings. Also, good strategy, all calls, no hedging. Not retarded or anything
[deleted]
tomorrow man. for sure.
Well that's fucking dodgy
The market HATES success

Give me some more non-starter EV companies or bankrupt weed companies
Bring back high volatility lol
Every. Damn. Time!
Took one 357, coz I m pussy.

Buy a greyhound ticket to Oregon. Become crackwhore. Pay back loan. Good job tard
Me too... Standing tall for days already. Let's hope this will be an eternal orgasm... Don't stop, keep pumping
Amen
Praying these uvxy calls print
niceeeee, what positions went well for you?
my would you get puts on spy? there was massive buy volume at close which should tell you something about tmrw.

bigly green tmrw
Done took 1 call.
Excuse my retardedness, but what are the boomer stocks?

Remember Tech Mooning during last Covid? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
ZM gonna blast through 600 this Fri or Monday
knee deep
True hilarity. Big bois ready to pounce with some actual volume. Turn it down to 11. üìâ
You the man I‚Äôm up 20% on the 11/27 16c and that was in about 45 minutes. Hopefully it‚Äôll run up tomorrow and through earnings
270Cs for next week
Kakaine's a helluva drug.
Tried to play SPY in the last 10 min figured it would sell off. Burned a day trade to lose 80 bucks when it went upzies. Oh well
I placed so many orders for PLTR today and RH filled zero. Might play in the morning but most likely will wait til after ER.
OK puzzy...  Dark humor that's it...
This guy gets it
ZM will hit 600 within the next 6 months
Spy usually red Thursdays
The irony of it all is that im still gonna fuckin buy a tsla with my nio winnings
So is spy just never gonna be red again or what?
Put my entire savings into it yesterday open for $15. Out of all the days it decided to plunge to 13.2, which is my stop loss limit. Then right after that it mooned to this fuck shit right now. For the past 5 days it rose 10% on every day EXCEPT THE DAY I FUCKING BOUGHT IT. I hate this piece of shit and I will never buy it again. Regret for life than regret for life, my luckis already as abysmal considering it have to lower to exactly my stop loss limit. Fuck PLTR and FML.

PS thanks for hearing my rant.
ty
Guys I‚Äôm scared. JAMF has earnings coming up. Last time they reported I bought calls and all of a sudden the September crash. JAMF is 100% responsible for September and I‚Äôm hoping that they don‚Äôt pull that shut again
ZM lmao wtf
2% green tech days are 1000% better than Dow 5% days
Should have sold and moved at least a week out.
They have the best image search of tech.  It‚Äôs fucking addictive.
Moon on opening because it means no lockdown. Moon on lockdown because it means more tech. One of us is pulling the strings
Come on we all know he lying
Buy every dip
PLTR is where NIO was like 2 months ago.
800
Missed 65% gains ($7,350) on PLTR shares ($9.70 -> $16)

Instead I bought a shit SaaS stock. Fuck me
Not yet bby.  Earnings coming up soon.  Covid back on the menu.  Schools closing down all over.
lol cool spy pumping to ath now :D
Rally goes on! Stocks rotate back to tech üòÇ
Any day now enron will fill the gap.
I have 15k in BABA. One way ticket to tendie town or homelessness.
I really want to buy books but it‚Äôs so expensive! 100$!
I bought spy puts at close. I already know how this goes guh
My dude you have no idea how hopeful I was to be cracking 50 on earnings, but the math doesn‚Äôt lie.  Keep in mind those percentages are 68% accurate within one standard deviation.
Theta going to fuck you up, better hope for a crazy jump
Live and die by the tech stonks
I‚Äôm convinced this after hours green dildo is to prevent people from getting in on calls
ZM rocketing AH üöÄ
Do you though?
Violence is good until him or someone he cares about is getting attacked by an angry Jamal lmao.

im fucked on tech
üòçWtf PLTR? I love funding the fbi/cia/nsa or whatever agency Alex Jones and wsb thinks they‚Äôre funding
hopefully this shit shows that it's a resilient stock and can persuade investors to pile in more
[deleted]
Fuck you DIS, bagholding now lol
Hell yeah.  Floppy tacos for all
That‚Äôs a hell of a dead cat bounce lol
Well that doesn‚Äôt sound good for moderna....
PLTR with 14% day. 

Tomorrow‚Äôs gonna be another 15-20% day üöÄüöÄ
What I've learned is that when a stock subreddit starts hyping up a stock, you don't invest in that stock.
[deleted]
lockdowns are good for tech and companies like amazon... which is like most of our market at this point.
That would be fucking amazingü•≥
same man...ill hold if its some fuck shi
Damn there‚Äôs a lot of bots on this subreddit I guess

Spy puts tomorrow. $365p 11/13
feelsbadman 
hopefully XPEV has good news tomorrow and we blow the roof
ZM 11/13 450c were .35 this morning, now 1.85. "easy" 5x.

too bad i only bought 3 contracts.
Canada has a military?
Same close above 3150 on Friday plsss
Go for it.
Depends on advancing/declining volume. RH has a green hulk didlo, so I say g√ºd
Spy today made me wanna hit my head on the corner of my desk
Tell me before I fuck your girlfriend
LOL @ palantir, this is insanity, I made a lot of money though, thanks
Dead cat bounce on zm. Its dropping hard tomorrow!!
Well I hopped on Starbucks. Don't let me down white girls
Dude, it tanked from 45 to 38. You were supposed to inverse *before* that happened. Not after it starts a face ripping recovery.
Long-term bearish on something.
so, when do we get pltr
you make my head hurt.
Spy going ape shitt coconuts
The Middle Ages because apparently there is no room for technology and computers in a covid free future
BABA 75billion singles day revenue 

At close: almost -1% ü§°
Bro all the bulls in here called it NIO 43 end of day, gunna be 47 EOW and over 50 after ER. Next pullback might go to the mid to high 40s that‚Äôs the last chance for the haters to get in after they MURDER their ER again
Yea dumb fuck the dollar went up today
Shoutout NIO and PLTR for carrying BABA bitch ass üò§
Palantir > Nio
I unfortunately only have 159 shares bought at 14.. and not options
I have those exact same calls right now. Let's get it!
that good?
I just sold mine. If it opens red you're getting slaughtered by IV
[deleted]
Got 1, up 9%
 I said it yesterday, and I'll say it again: Xpeng's cars look like shit.
You sound like a monk. I'm down 43% and taking a break for now
[deleted]
mmmm.... I have mucho PLTR shares..but Total Addressable Market? bigger for ZM no?
I'm very bullish on RKT, I'll probably buy a few leaps if my NIO play pans out next week.

I don't think I'll ever play a RKT earnings again, unless I'm selling CSP or put credit spreads.
[removed]
Was bouncing green/red all day til the EoD pump. Thank you MMs for that round.
ughhh im cummin feels so gud to make some monie again
NIO with the casual 5 fucking dollar recovery from premarket god damn that‚Äôs a thicc bitch
Amen brotha.
PENISES DOWN thank you PLTR
Good point

DDOG $85 Call -  average cost $1.45 11/20

RAMP $60 Call - average cost $3.80 11/20

APD $280 Call - average cost $4.20 11/20

Dumb
Proof or ban
bUlL tRaP... the vaccine was bs per usual. The money is just rotating back into tech.
Took profits, exercised some calls. My portfolio is only stocks now (100 NIO, 300 PLTR). Low reward, but also low risk. Options were clearly not for me after losing $10k
IWM the last 30 EXACT minutes was fucking redic
Ban me idgaf I‚Äôm only posting a pic when I hit 500k which will be by EOY
I am declaring retirement on PLTR
One more day like today and I will be even
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.
it can go up, it can go down. got it.
Not selling calls, but selling my current call positions
Well thats why I asked..
Not a bear. But is the inevitable shut down really priced in at a market near ath?
Wheres all those fuck bois from morning chat talking shit about my best girl NIO?!
same, that late day pump was 100% not what I expected.
I don't Yolo, but given how tsla went, you may not be so fucking stupid.

I'd probably have gone more otm given 2 years, but 40 is basically a decent long term investment for 2023.

Im far more diversified with so many strikes and expirations I'd have to check my spreadsheet to stay straight, but if I was going to Yolo, it'd be on the Chinese ev knock off if tsla. 

This and xpeng.
down 23% today mostly holding calls lol

I know you idiot
PLTR Valued at **25B** on **7-800M** in revenue.  
ZM Valued at **125B** on **6-700M** in revenue.  
  
I'm not saying it's that simple.  
But sometimes it is.
üòÇ
Sometime in December when bodies are dropping like flies
I still don't know what pltr even does. Is there more room for it to run it up? I feel like it's peaking. Reminds me of rkt
Canada promised military intervention, lol wtf?
I have shares and am holding long term
I have 12
A job
Maybe they are doing fraud and they need cash up front
Welp it wasn't easy but I finally did it... Inversed WSB... just got NIO puts ü§ô
Bought two days ago. Still holding
Two weeks
I know damn well tis retarded but Tech don't fail me now!
no you
Not on my account.  Guess they think I'm too retarded to handle that massive responsibility.
I never am hahah
üöÄNIOüöÄ
Used to do the same with TSLA
I‚Äôm just a moron, but i think spring is the worst time for spy puts. If you don‚Äôt plan on holding them, then yeah sure could work, but winter will probably be harsher than spring on stonks
Triple digit close for AMZN please!
Sold some 45c. Not scared. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
SOLO Cup and Handle!
Should've bought pltr yesterday. Fingers crossed I'll get another chance after earnings.
next earnings Feb 4 2021, go longer
Fuck u buy stonks gtfo
Dump BABA Yolo PLTR
Care to share some of your extra chromosomes with us
PLTR Jan 2021 20c
Perhaps. ü•∫

I wanted to learn more about FSR, on trading212 it describes the company as a blank cheque company... seems about right for this sub
GRWG earnings about to make me horny
362s for Friday are .35 and will be 10 baggers.
Nio n pltr all in gonna double up once again motherfuckers fuck u all
[deleted]
Every time I see a NIO bear go "its going to implode any day now!" I ask them what their puts strike and expiry are. They always say some variation of "I don't have any puts on NIO"... what a bunch of know nothing cowards
Explain what happened with RKT please
üöÄ
Why did it pump like that? Any news? I was away for like 6 minutes and lost 1k.
Up 0.69% stagnant.
Nah, he‚Äôs already lost. Now he‚Äôs trying to get ignorant people to pay off his campaign debts. He‚Äôll disappear soon enough and remain nothing more than a bad memory.
Lost a fuck ton of money because spy is fucking retarded and just found out I got rejected after interviewing with my dream company. Long rope time.
y
Will you asshats stop talking about shit other than NIO!?
Indeed. This volume is un‚Äôbear‚Äôable. Truly atrocious.
Is this when I buy PLTR puts?!??
She's gonna regret this one day üòÇ
premium is high
Lol no I‚Äôm just straight up retarded
Come on AMZN wtf
God i fucking hope
Of course it runs again after I ask this question
Fuck baba
So what are thoughts on PFE leaps? It can only go up right?
Spy Bulls fuk tmrw
[deleted]
AAPL $600
Why?
Need a circuit breaker day soon. Early Christmas shopping son
Option volume on PTON went crazy...I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs news AH
Loading up on MOMO and TWTR calls because the bulls on the unusual options tracker must know something, right?
Okay I am fairly new to options.. I see so many folks in here talking about "rug pull" incoming, then when it doesn't happen they say "you just wait". Isn't that the whole idea with options? Timing the dips and rallies for profit?

&#x200B;

Taking this thought a bit further.. would it be beneficial to just load up long SPY puts around $320 for early Spring 2021?

To all of you that bought ACB while i was driving in the car and fucking my puts, i hope you get corona.

PLTR pushing 16
You are completely missing the point. My point was, Biden is not doing anything wrong, nor was Trump in 2016. Speaking to other leaders ahead of the electoral college vote is STANDARD PROCEDURE. Jeez man, orange man bad, I get it. Your stance isn't original.
[deleted]
Not too much room to drop imo it either stays flat or goes up. If it drops prolly won‚Äôt go below $20 but I‚Äôm always wrong with this damn ticker
[deleted]
daily reminder rug push tomorrow
DRI is up close to pre-COVID levels - makes no sense. Rising COVID numbers and hospitalizations as well as rising restrictions on dining coming - this should fall
I prefer to lose my money quickly but to each his own
Picked up a couple. Just cuz fuck ACB
Step 2 put Dick in the box? üì¶
[deleted]
Literally everyone is talking about NIO
I know buying stocks is retarded but I bought over 200 shares of PLTR after IPO and I'm a happy retard.
A little of both
Make or break with AMZN, let's see.
Sold my 357s today for 11.2% profit just to be safe
Youre not alone
You can still day trade, you just have to make sure you have 25k left over in cash.
Lol yeah I bought just a few puts cuz I'm not full gay but just bicurious. Never again. Stonks only go up
Link? That sounds interesting
Last time there was this little volume on the QQQ was 10/9. Giant leg up, then disaster. üìâ
What happened  exactly?
literally the most important part about investing. Tesla bears learned that a while ago or atleast they should have.
Enjoy the bull trap
Puts or callls?
Anyone getting into BABA leaps? ü§îü§î
[deleted]
more lockdown news coming soon....Zoom gonna pop bigly
Fed or what‚Äôs the catalyst?

Google photos will end unlimited photo storage from June 2021. WTF
you have a point there lol
Only joking. I watched Hannity last night to see about the "evidence" they had after mango man tweeted. Their whole point was basically voter fraud occured because the Republicans said it would occur and are now saying that it did occur (with no evidence), a poll of Republicans showed 70-75% dont believe it was fair and honest election so they can't all be wrong??? Pretty much what it boiled down to.
ZNGA has to come alive at some point

Ahaha awesome
Jack Ma is a patriot

Im as big as a chad bull as anyone in here, but i really feel like the rug pull is tomorrow.  352

you can, or you can close them
If apple can make a last push to 120 before close that would be nice thank you
Daily reminder rug pull tomorrow
lol
I have leaps so im holding, if you made good gains sell and buy a nice steak and some bourbon
AMZN üëÄ
Some üåàüêª's were like "Uh oh, NIO going red today!"

And NIO was like, "Nah, I got you fam."
Here's hoping
Nvda was showing really strong momentum before the whole tech selloff happened
Link or ban my man
Not you, but people will fomo tomorrow when they see the rally
Went from down -80% to -47% today. BABY STEPS
NIO
Seems volume doesn't really mean anything nowadays. It's like the algos and big players pump a stock on low volume, retail traders jump in, then the big players sell leaving retail traders with the bag.
Earnings tomorrow
what happened after?
Link it
Feeling a tingle in my b-hole, got some 11/13 spy poots
ACB ü•¥

Imagine still being a NIO bear when the last chance for a pullback before ER run failed miserably even when NIO bulls expected it. That just shows how strong this stock really is. I along with other top analysts were expecting a pullback to 35 aka another chance to buy in but it couldn‚Äôt even go that low. NIO 60 to 70 EOY

Honestly, the real easy money is scalping 0 DTE SPY puts. If its green, SPY almost never goes up after midday, with unlimited PDT you can reliably get 25-50% each day buying puts at the midday top and wait till the end of the day to sell. But I am retarded, so I bought 11/20 AMD $90c instead.

Trying to figure out if it dips or moons post earnings. If a dip is coming I wanna sell off ahead and buy right back into that temporary drop. Either way I think it keeps chugging upwards.

It makes you hyper focused on task at hand. But it does so in a very narrow way. For example one of my buddies took it to concentrate on a paper, tried to clean his table before sitting down and ended up cleaning his whole apartment instead. 

I've had similar-ish experiences. I'm a programmer and most of the time I don't like the code I've written on moda the next day. Code usually involves some mental gymnastics that's hard to read and isn't really modular or extendable (because of the narrow mindedness). 

Even early on, the main value I'd get out of such "trips" was to realise how fucking ridiculous I was being and telling myself to stfu and get back to honest work.

Trading to make money doesn‚Äôt mean trading to stay in the game as long as possible. Chasing plays and making revenge plays is a great way to go broke. This is coming from the guy whos blown his account 6 times in the past year.

Thing was flat for a month but now that it's pushing $16 it's time to buy shares, lol

Ah, I see. Your problem is you didn‚Äôt sell on Monday morning. We all knew that the drop after election was coming. It just got broken up by the weekend.
Thanks man. Really don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm gonna do but at least I can‚Äôt lose any more money now
Yeah so ima need news of a reverse stimulus which takes $1200 away from all Americans so my puts can print
I don‚Äôt think anyone has the balls to make a move yet. 90% probably still owns TSLA.

would be a good idea to buy FB calls. They took too big of a hit after the vaccine news and idk how the virus going away effects their business at all. If anything, companies will spend more for fb advertising after everything opens up

this nio run and hype sounds eerily similar to tsla earnings and battery day lmao

Gamestop was a solid pick up at the ATLs earlier this year. Anyone who picked up has made a fuck ton of money. It got down as low 2.80$ per share. Console Cycle coming up - more than half of game purchases are through retail/brick and mortar. Even if it doesn't survive the next 10 years GME has a clear path for the coming 2-3 years. I've been deeply following them for over a year - financials/10ks/cash flow/income/balance sheets. There is definitely something salvageable here. Have you seen their board of directors? 

Also...who the fuck clocks other peoples money? especially strangers? You sound like a fucking loser.

tl;dr you sound like you dont know what the fuck you're talking about. Anyone that picked up GME prior to august has at least doubled their investment.

NIO is literally going to be what OSTK, AMZN, TSLA, PTON etc is where you say there‚Äôs no way it can keep going up and it just keeps going up and you wait on the sidelines and grow to be an old man, filled with regret, while the people with calls are driving to tendie town in their new lambos. 

NIO 46c 11/13
Damn that‚Äôs a whole lotta pasta
when will baba pull his dick out of my anus?
I feel you man sold some calls I bought on Monday just now for about the same amount of loss
There‚Äôs a chance you get face ripped by great guidance if you‚Äôre selling calls I‚Äôd make sure they‚Äôre 30% OTM or more
yea I had perfect timing if I didn‚Äôt would‚Äôve been fucked
[deleted]
0DTE puts/calls you can go red in seconds
Well but every gain is a gain.     

Read the graphs afterwards and think you could have made more is just BS, you can't predict. And with experience you eventually get better on knowing when to buy and sell improving gains, but no one can go 100% efficient all the time.
max pain is for bears w a 2.1 P/C ratio
Keep it up nio bulls making puts so cheap and juicy
Guh

NIO is a lesson in IV today.

The calls I bought early today when NIO was down 1% are curently in the red by 12%

Geez whatcha investing in lol
Where do you see they lost 400 million in 2019? I'm seeing profit everywhere I look. They profited around 400 million less than in 2018, but still profited as far as I can tell. I'm stupid so I might not be reading these financials right, happy to be shown I'm wrong.



And why do you think it's not worth 40 billion? I haven't run the math exactly, but did estimates a while back that seemed to think that's about right

Mods r ghey
Watch the entire interview instead of 15 second clips. He repeatedly says he's long because the virus is bad enough he expects the government to step in and help, which they did. 

He did think they'd also get the virus under control which they obviously have not but still. If you watched the whole interview you would have gone long
Well it would only need like 10 cents
Don't act like you pay any taxes in the USA

Yup, still made a small profit. Would have been 3x higher if I didn't play myself but lesson learned. NIO dips have consistently been easy money though

Where will you be when NIO hits 100?
A 45 billion market cap or more is definitely achievable for this company

Considering other companies like scamazon is north of 1 trillion and all they do is sell fleshlights
Ban
Market cap should be at least 50 billion IMO, I'm really long on this stock so I'm gonna keep holding and selling covered puts until it pops off like PTON did a few quarters after IPO. With that 1 billion dollar buyback program I'm thinking they're gonna pump up the share price right before their lockup period ends by pumping that billion in large quantities.

I am sure the majority of people in my state would agree with me. You really don't think that it's an issue when a government is acting against the interest of the majority of its citizens? Or at the very least, not at all considering their interests?

Even the WHO has spoken up about lockdowns having a profound negative effect, and serve only as a way to buy time while other actions are implemented. Tightening restrictions in response to small upticks in cases is not the best move. They should just test people and perform contact tracing... We have the capacity and knowledge to do that.

Gotcha. Good luck on that one, only 100 contracts are open (open interest) so believe it or not your position is a substantial part of that strike's activity. Make sure you use limit orders to avoid getting screwed by spreads
these idiots shorting amzn in christmas season haha
I can‚Äôt wait for this fucking scammy market to tank... without the fed QE this is worth SPY180

That was a fucking mattress company lmfao. This is EV
I really gotta work on my anger issues, a fucking stock shouldn‚Äôt be pissing me off this much

Nah I don‚Äôt do weeklies... these are a month out
I have 200 shares and a leap for PLTR. Take profits or hold?
Curious. When people shit on Chinese stocks... what makes you think it's gonna be the next NKLA and not the next BABA or TCEHY?
Thats good for trading, youre probably being a degenerate gambler holding too long
I will cry if Baba doesn‚Äôt pump tomorrow
Worst case scenario the Chinese government just decides one day they dont want BABA to make money anymore. But hey what are the odds of that right?. Oh....wait
Yea go ahead and buy some, I‚Äôm sure all the nio bears can tell you how that worked out for them....oh wait they all extinct now after today
FUCK THIS MARKET
Why shouldn‚Äôt we short the fuck out of XPEV?

Sir ur hurting my feelings
Yeah, but it's pricing the potential it could move up or down. I'm confident it's going to moon.
SPR calls were not a good choice today
a covid prediction thread:
https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1326404864843390976?s=20

TLDR: deaths lag cases by about 22 days, we'll have about 2,000 deaths per day in 3 weeks time, which is higher than any day since early May at the peak (2700 in a day).
This means you wiped the wrong way. Try front to back üëç
Looks like we rally into the close. Bullish for tmr.
If you didn't buy the dip on NIO today, consider yourself fully retarded

Not prescribed. Used to work on me a year or so back. Maybe because of all the weed I did or smth it just doesn't do anything and just wears me out. 

I wasn't anxious when I took it though. I'm not even that anxious now. Just the usual procrastination actually... 

If you haven't tried wouldn't recommend it. It is not that useful tbh.
I'm gonna need more of these pronto
Instructions not clear my account is up 800%
Still early
If they slip another 7% or so I'll sell my puts on the assumption that were close to real support. Exiting my puts on stupid bullshit that the market bought on Monday by Friday since moderna should announce some preliminary results soon.
Imagine buying NIO, but not buying HCAC

Ever since I blindly started inversing WSB idiot sentiment I've been green
Yup. I exited my weeklies after I recovered what I lost yesterday. May buy 11/20 calls after a dip tomorrow and play the ER run up. Definitely dumping after ER though at which point I'll buy back in

Had to leave that terrible sub after that retard spooktober shit.
On days like this when I sit on the sidelines (waiting to get my day trades back), I try to remind myself that there will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

Doesn't work, but that's what I tell myself
Try WYNN or SPG puts. They are still up from vaccine pump.
Not unless   XPEV shits tomorrow morning dragging everyone down
Its not likely but its a possibility.
The chart is misleading. GME shares barely moved during last console release and it actually went down a few months after. This console cycle is different because I suspect management will direct new free cash flow to transform the business. This is what you should be investing in, a badly beaten business looking to make a big comeback. Just imagine if you had the foresight to invest in Amazon when they were selling books. 

I also don‚Äôt think the squeeze is gonna happen anymore, or at least not to the VW levels.

WHAT A GOOOD FKN DAY BOI
[deleted]
Bruh I got scammed by an ig bot last week. Haven‚Äôt been the same since
Why do u guys think pltr will rip after earnings?
No it shouldn‚Äôt. Because it‚Äôs chinese. You think investors around the world should trust baba as much as amazon? Good luck. 

I agree it should be worth more though. But the issue is trust so it won‚Äôt be worth more than amazon . 

Investing in a shady VIE structure based ADR with zero fiduciary duty is a hard sell to some big institutions.
Haha jokes on you I don't even write CUDA and just use PyTorch üòè
This might be a retarded comment, cuz honestly I can't tell what is actually retarded in this sub vs a bunch of retards just saying everything is retarded, but I'm expecting PLTR to smash earnings then tank like everything else is lately.

 Someone tell me I'm wrong and retarded then explain why please.
PLTR TO THE MOOON
The 100K PLTR guy is up about 13K rn if he held and didn‚Äôt rope the last few days.
If NIO holds 42.50 I'll be happy. 12/11 50c down 5% but I'm thinking 46/47 before earnings if the other chinese evs don't kill it
My man I came thinking about this.
Buy puts tomorrow at close. It‚Äôs going down just like RKT after first earnings. Then once it crashes, buy leaps
Yep. Pick up your cash now.
Hey atleast you're recognizing your gaps and are pulling back to learn and fill them in. Could be a total autist and do the same thing trying to get back in the game.

I did the exact same thing with weekly calls. Multiple times like a jackass. Since then I wont touch any thing atleast three weeks out with a max of like 10% needed to print. The only tempting thing is these meme stocks have a tendency to go parabolic and either induce fomo or suicidal thoughts. Good luck man!
Why? Any plans for it to turn up?
BULLISH AF - Seems like someone is wanting to either buy shares or get paid HUGELY. Who would want to buy 7 million of there own shares back ....

Keep in mind Pfizer doesn‚Äôt have approval, no peer review, their ceo sold shares, and they won‚Äôt have the best vaccine if a DNA vaccine like inovio‚Äôs can get through.... plus they‚Äôre not supposed to make much from the vaccine
Not necessarily. IV went down. IDK OP's expiration date, but my 1/15/21 calls are barely above even for the day, despite +3% in the underlying. Theta is nearly nothing on those calls, but IV went from 122% yesterday to 110% today.
Dont buy those back

That feeling when you‚Äôre long a bunch of OTM calls on meme stocks that are profitable but you‚Äôre gonna hold into the close and get gapped on tomorrow
That one is ok but too annoying and long. This starts purrfectly and the sounds are pleasant and upbeat with being too much.

Not saying it won't happen, but the next few months will determine the fates of businesses across many different sectors - they'll stay open no matter what the cost.

And even if everything does shut down, I'd go all in on tech - where else will I get all my gifts?
What's your position? I'm not sure what you are asking here. NIO opened down, filled the gap, and then is up a buck on my screen.
The banks are being held back by having no one worth lending to.  And the ones who are, don't need them.

Robinhood scales the chart according to the movement. Basically it plots a range that is plus/minus X from opening bell. That range will generally stay the same but where the upper and lower limits site respective to a dollar amount will vary (the range window moves up and down with price).

This makes even small movements look dramatic. One of my gripes about Robinhood. 

My apologies if my explanation is strange. I analyze data all the time for work and generally have a difficult time with words.

Say no more. All in June SPY calls
Puts on thread volume
Pre-market tomorrow
Right now it looks shitty but it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm holding on to a bunch of calls that are currently down about $12k combined, but I have a pretty high level of confidence that they‚Äôll be green by expiration (expire between 12/04/2020 and 04/16/2021).
I'm waiting for the Jan selling restrictions to ease up which should be bearish and provide a good buying opportunity. Probably won't get in below $10 (other than the token share I bought) but that's OK
What ever happened to EOD face rippers?
Yea via NIO
Yes. Sell

NIO making everyone rich out here
Yes
Spy took a massive shit in March because of UNCERTAINTY. Even if Covid causes shutdowns and what not, there's nothing new there. The economy has never shut down like it did and no one knew what was coming. Spy may take a bit, but not gonna even come close to March.
I did. Probably best seeing as I have no real rules or discipline
did my nio leaps get destroyed from IV crush? what the hell lol i bought monday at 9:30 when it was 42.58 now its higher than that and im down?

What‚Äôs the big day??
Spidey sense
The oracle just tells you what you need to hear
sold off enough, time to buy some back for cheap.
You can‚Äôt even explain why
But it expires in Dec 24, I‚Äôve played around with options before I wasn‚Äôt expecting that much of a change
When are they reporting?
No way the market will allow us to get rich lol
I get that but this is a reversal of that. I‚Äôm guessing tech was just oversold
goddamn stop making me want to buy more puts

Do
It
More buyers than sellers I guess
i mean id sell too.... AMZN is at all time highs why keep all your money tied to one company.
yes because its pricing in potential earnings movement, either get a spread (sell a higher strike contract at the same time) or don't play options before earnings
[deleted]
No way man

Why puts
[deleted]
I‚Äôd be suprised if the algos let the bulls escape from this one alive. That poor low on the day looks juicy on the Es
It's news of Pfizer and its 90% effective phase III trials. Investor sentiment believes there will be a shift into value rather than tech. Worrysome activity around the need for things such as ZM or PTON. It's typical to see this when tech has been on major runs and value has been suffering.
I'm new to this.. IV is very high on PLTR calls I bought.  AM I going to get fucked tomorrow because of that?
I mean you can use that logic for pretty much everything. Medicine is just biology, aerospace is just physics ...

How‚Äôs your account doing?
PLTR puts will print
IM NOT FUKIN SELLING
Not true, see my above post. 90% effective against equable placebo controls who had confirmed covid-19. Meaning ~84-85 of 94 people who got vaccine didn‚Äôt get covid compared to a relatively equal group of 94 people who got the placebo who all got covid. No measurement of antibodies involved. They waited til at least 7 days after second dose bc it‚Äôs very possible to get a vaccine and then get exposed the next day before the vaccine ever generates antibodies. Their phase 1/2 trial measured efficacy by antibodies. You‚Äôre several months behind.
I went all in on PLTR puts. Guaranteed to skyrocket on Friday. You‚Äôre welcome.

I took half and left the rest in there. I bought in for .14 I doubled it yesterday sold half got my investment back then bought 10 more at .14 yesterday. Then I sold another 8 at double again today. I was left with 10 (where the screen shot is) so I ended up selling 5 at around .5 with 5 left.

Alright my g I will break it down for you,

Sports betting is something you do for money and social value. It‚Äôs something you have parties to watch and talk about. 

With covid less people are doing social things and there‚Äôs less groups of people making draft leagues which means decline of interest (potential profit) and that value drop is reflected in the stock price
It‚Äôs either going to rain or not tomorrow calling it now
NIO open $45
yeah im gnna put the tech giants especially twitter. Like i said im betting my left nut that trump is going to take away their section 230 and fuck with them. Keep an eye on it.
Hope you didn‚Äôt get puts
Fastest way to blow your account is having more than 3 weekly trades open at a time
This weekend is gonna be interesting. Holding spy puts over the weekend is either gonna clap my cheeks or make some money

SPY needs to drop 14% in the next 3 weeks for your portfolio to break even. You might as well YOLO it on the nearest expiry weeklies.
My portfolio looks the exact same as yours right now. The NIO calls killed me at first, put me $600 down early. Now I‚Äôm $50 in the green today.
Puts on anything that got vaccine pumped. DIS has room to fall.

I have no advice but I just want to say thank you to whatever random comment I saw months ago that brought EAST to my attention. 

Bought a sizable share at $0.98 and sold some at $2.00 today. 

Tiniest baby gains compared to some here but desperately, desperately needed at this time. Been back to calling my insurance to reassure them money is coming but I need my fucking phone to be paid first since my laptop finally shit the bed.

Sorry for the rant, just been so fucking stressed and the last week or so has made me cry in financial relief a few times now.
Oh, and that was on a call that set me back $17,000!  So I was down $15,000 and then sold for a $3,000 gain!
Bought leaps
I think it‚Äôs just about done bottoming out.

Basically retail is trading a 5% stake in the company because the CEO decided to give himself 1.9 billion shares to retain a 95% stake in the company (greedy asshole). The implication is the company is worth 40 billion dollars (it's not). They lost $400 million in 2019 and got lucky as fuck in 2020 because of COVID and interest rates going down. The reason he IPO'd was literally to take advantage of the COVID situation to make HIMSELF richer and take advantage of the situation.

Get out before next earnings. February is going to be a shitshow.

There‚Äôs no way tbh. If it was going to 35 it would have happened this week. It won‚Äôt go below 45 after earnings

I‚Äôd love some insight on this as well

how tf is SPY not dead?
Sell but wait until PM movement tomorrow to decide what to buy. I'd buy 11/20 so you don't get IV crushed.

Earnings is tomorrow after hours. So buying tomorrow is asking to get fried by earnings.

But many governments, such as California's, are implementing solutions that **in your opinion** have worse effects than the problem itself.

Yes I hope it gets pile drived tomorrow but nah it'll go up another $30, got 11/13 like a tard. But only $200 loss, thankfully I got a bunch of longer dated QCOM calls that I'm sure will print nicely soon.

Let it ride and if you'd rather have the shares when it comes to expiration. Get them, if you'd rather have the premium, take it then
No way

I‚Äôm exercising my shares for 1/15/21 I have 13c. I figure if we hold a few months the premiums to sell covered calls will be so fkn juicy once the hype and FOMO stops

Devote more of ur port to shares and thetagang shit
Great idea, been eyeing RVLV for a while
Hoping for a $4 dump
Like just look at NVDA. $374 MM in stock based comp. Admin expenses at $627 MM. Received $94 MM (not notional value) in proceeds from new issuances related to employee stock comp plans in the last three months. 

May not seem like a lot of money to NVDA stock if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that NVDA‚Äôs P/S was 24.49x yesterday. Basically free money.
What about 11/20
> We already know people who have already had covid, and therefore have antibodies, can get sick again.

False, we know people who have tested positive for COVID antibodies have gone on to test negative and then to test positive again. Big difference there.

As far as I can tell the test results are majorly hit-or-miss, so I don't put much stock in antibody tests. I would wager it's more likely that the true PFE vaccine efficacy is 99% than than someone can get infected by COVID twice in the same year. 

Worst case scenario, there are multiple versions of COVID in the wild and we'll never get rid of it, like influenza. You can get COVID-A and COVID-B in the same year, but you can't get COVID-A twice in the same year.
I WOULD NEVER LET A CHINESE NIGGA FUK MY WIFE...........unless his name Nio

Everyone lelz at RKT, but its literally where it was 2 weeks ago.  Only people that got burned were people buying FDs

I feel like you and me understand this NIO situation a lot better than the other shills
I bought a Jan 3100 at open and sold for $2400 profit. On the mini mini dip bought two Dec 3160s. Really hoping that there‚Äôs more bounce to at least 3200-3300
bro all I want is to have enough gains to not be in the red whenever there's a red day, I can literally just stop caring, this shit stressful
ACB issuing 20m more shares at 7.50 is gonna pump this thing to the moon again. The investors picking it up are gonna have that avg down and wanna see it fly.

Selling half my position today. Let the rest ride!
Imagine not buying that NIO dip
We‚Äôre learning it was one of the most shorted stocks following the election.  Price artificially low until those shorts close then we should get a nice squeeze.

why airlines stock are back to where they were?

Maize, soybeans, and corn are the major culprits of monocropping. Do you know why that is? Because Maize, soybeans, and corn have become diet staples of...you guessed it... livestock.

 [Livestock takes up 80% of global agriculture land.](https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets) If we got rid of livestock farming we would not only free up literally 4/5ths of our farmable land, but we also wouldn‚Äôt have a need to produce as much soy and corn. Thus significantly reducing the impact we have on our farmable land. 

Also, it‚Äôs not mystery meat. It‚Äôs made with plantsl based ingredients. The ingredients list is very easy to find online. I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs much easier to find out what‚Äôs in these faux-meats than to find what kind of antibiotics and chemicals they‚Äôre pumping into your beef and chicken.

My personal opinions is that you will be healthier eating natural whole Foods compared anything processed.
‚Äú...i just buy stock and hold it.‚Äù

Lol. Nio premiums are barely green. Get out of your weeklies
No. Buy 11/20 on Friday at noon and sell Monday after it booms. Maybe buy puts on Monday and then use your winnings to buy shares when it dumps
Travel/Energy/Retail is about to have a new rotation of bag holders. That shits going even lower
Collect that premium easy cash

Yeah the Xilinx acq will probably pay off next ER I hope. Definitely not in the short term.

Pretty sure if I buy puts it will moon the fuck out.
Don‚Äôt believe they are mutually exclusive
NIO hold through ER?
Been waiting for plug to have a good day...greedy if I hold overnight?!
Last time I did Rh fucked me over and it took me a good while to get out of debt
Retards here are so sure the markets are forward looking and all of the bad news we have had/have coming up is already priced in are about to be in for a rude surprise. All you have to do is look back to February, when markets were ripping in spite of supply chains out of China getting butt fucked by COVID.
I try :)
Calls on Apple $130 Jan 15?
Plays?
Yeah, same. I finally got burned with these when I bought at $42 after the first -5% day but today just bailed me out. I'm gonna wait for a dip tomorrow and buy 11/20 calls OTM for that pre-ER boom on Monday.
Damn Box CEO looks like if Paul Bearer lost 150lbs.
I have $22 Feb 2021 PLTR leaps. Thinking I'm going load up on more leaps EOD, are there any other plays to look at for them?

Ah geeze dude I also need to decide that
Im doubling down right now
Why wasn‚Äôt this flaired Gain?
PLTR Straddle / Strangle
NIO > TSLA
I suspect earnings will be underwhelming, they've explicitly said they are interested in gradual compound growth and internal product focus. Don't be surprised if it's underwhelming and stock drops. I'll be buying the dip forsure.

How much you holding and what you buy at
Bury was calling for buybacks when he originally bought in, he knows
Or that you believed in your product as you‚Äôd hope the CEO would. Imagine if they had shit results. Obviously he expected results that would pump the share price and when they had them he released them. Nothing illegal.
HELL YEAH! I'M RIDING THE NIO WAVE ALL THE WAY TO THE MOON

trumps been planning this since 2018. He knew they stole the mid terms and moved to falsely impeach him on a hoax. Democrats love painting him as a idiot and plaster it all over reddit and msm and social media painting him like an idiot meanwhile he just sits back and lets them commit the crimes in the open and swoops in 1 sweep and shuts them down. He is going to get a 2nd term via the route of the courts and he will raise havoc on the tech giants. Gonna put them.

All in shares cuz I‚Äôm homo. At a $10avg it‚Äôs sitting at $14 now but huge announcements regarding manufacturing are coming Sunday.
PLTR is either going down 10% or up 10% tonight. Either way I sold mine and will buy back in tomorrow, not gonna let myself get burned by earnings same way rocket retards did
Suggested IPO price was under $8, they would have to have a pretty insane earnings beat to go up further tomorrow. I would cash in today I just sold a call myself.
I‚Äôm just going to iron fist my shares for like 5 years with this company and buy every big dip.
holy fuck pltr printing!
Give me a play
Remember when Garth momentarily became Chris Gaines? I member  


Also I'll be singing the above the rest of the day. Thanks for that
Not too late?
when your calls dated? can sell some otm calls? limit risk if unsure
Very poorly right now, I‚Äôm down about 68%.  But I also had a call with AMZN a couple weeks ago that I was down 90% and had a couple good days and sold for a 20% gain.  I usually buy calls 1 month out so I have time for these swings.
Probably not. I‚Äôll just be focusing on making more money than you gambling options.
Earnings are tomorrow AH so still plentlt of time to sell before ER
3k to 20k now down to 11k. Heard that.
A 300$ retard yolo screenshot is not worth the space in my phone
I disagree
Huge volume on GME so far today
Look at the chart and covid narrative is back
Average among all people taking the test. If the average American tests lower than the average person internationally, then the average IQ score in America can be less than 100.

Not saying it's true, with such a large sample size the average should still be 100, but meh I guess it could be
VIX is 2x historical average even with markets within 1% of all time high.

RSI is a good chart to look at to help identify potential reversals in price action.  As the price continues to dip, but the RSI goes up, then you know there's a bullish reversal setting up.  I think you'll be fine from a technical perspective.  Chinese politics is an entirely different scenario though...

Can‚Äôt lose any money if you‚Äôve lost all your money.
Or get in on that
Yea, I  hate this sub. Saw a post yesterday. Was watching earnings after hours. 1.21 a share and a 1 billion dollar buyback? But I couldn't quite figure out why the market cap was 44 billion when it showed 100.4 million shares outstanding. I bought at $21 a share after hours without researching. Woke up expecting a moon like a goddam retard. It's trading around my buy in. Sold DEC 11 $21 calls for $1.5 giving me room all the way down to $19.50. I found out the goddam CEO has 1.9 billion shares. Realized this company is fukt. Trying to roll the $21 strike down to $18 for a $2 credit to sustain more downward momentum.

Only times I ever fucking lose money is when I listen to this goddam sub. The good advice looks retarded as fuck and the bad advice looks good.
Lockdown news is more like diminishing values rule at this point. In Mar it seemed like the world was ending. Today it's just another day that we're already used to.

i'll probably let one of my calls ride as a lotto
Fuck yeah
Look at the chart, Check NIO twitter, check XPEV earnings date
I don't know whether to hold PLTR thru tonight or not.
I've bought the peak like 4 times now and I'm up bigly. This truly is the stock for retards like myself.
Also, they knew this result in Oct but waited until the day after Biden's win to release it.
What is this?? If you feel the need to screenshot it then it‚Äôs time to close it‚Ä¶
I'm just going to keep playing the swings because it's been working well so far, at least 5 times since I bought in the first place at like 35. I'm not qualified to give advice thouigh I really only got into the stock market in the late summer and lost like 10% of my portfolio yesterday from using too much leverage. But at least I think i'm learning and the nio trading has been consistently going well. it's been going between mid 39 to 44-45 like clockwork the last week but the average trend is still more upwards than down.
Netflix calls printing?
ACB dumping. get out fast.

if you're asking here then you better sell. Tomorrow looking like a red day anyways
Hehe, yeah man.

Who here constantly day trades at a loss. Just imagine. Smh
What makes you think XPEV will sell off?
Isn't every stock? However I do factor in red days (hourly stochastics) as well as potential surprises, which is why position tend fall well outside 30 days or more.
The 3rd one!!

It's had identical movements for so long now. Only difference is now its getting more hype, the moons are bigger and hence the pullbacks will be bigger

Sheeeeesh

So that sell off was for New York announcing more restrictions. Explains why tech didn‚Äôt budge. Anyway, market already shrugged it off.

Going up 10% for no reason?
I have a feeling PLTR will create a generation of Bagholders not seen since the RKT Sept 2.

Staying out of this one
Okay NIO I see you üëÄ thanks for the dipping earlier so that I could buy some calls
BABA calls - Oversold.  China wants to compete, not kneecap their biggest companies. ANT IPO.  Singles day sales #s.  Potential thawing of relations due to Biden.

ORCL puts - less confident about this but sounds like Tik Tok deal might hit a snag because Trump is busy doing whatever he's been doing.

Inversing yourself is the path to tendies.  Hold to expiry if you want to win.

Yeah I don‚Äôt think that would be a bad idea. Nice pickup though
Did you get some profits though?  Don't feel bad, profit is profit.  There's more trades you can make in the future.

Question: Does IV drop gradually or all at once like this? 


As in, do I sell now while my calls are still green because the IV is going to go down and down and down, or do I hold because the worst of the IV crush is behind us?
100 eoy is very speculative. 60-70 range is much more realistic imo

Looks to me that the stonk market will be significantly lower by EOD
so puts for now
fuck cisco
PFE'S a steal rn...
Depends if you get a huge run up beforehand or not. Huge run up = sell. No huge run up = hold. With Jan expiry you‚Äôre safe either way. But if you don‚Äôt have money to avg down it might be better to sell beforehand either way and then buy back in afterwards. The IV will crush after earnings either way dropping the price of premium if it doesn‚Äôt pop up or fall down significantly

if im wrong i still got a right nut.
i'll sell you mine for 700
I think this ends up being a 200$ stock in a couple years.  But for this earnings, I‚Äôd worry about them doing an offering.  I‚Äôll be taking profit on a significant portion.  But also holding shares for the long term.
it will not be 100 by eoy.. stop shilling and lying to the children.

That's what happened but as long as it's after the release of the positive news it's fine and legal. Now if it turns out he coordinated the sell with positive news, while knowing that that there's negative news coming down the road, that's unethical and possibly illegal.
Give me access

Please tell me if SPX dumps tmrw BABA won't move with it? BaBA is hugely oversold on the 4hr and consolidating and should move up tmrw but i think SPY will be red tmrw and second lockdowns and all, fuck should i just take loss?

I'm holding.... ppl get rallied on this stock why there is be even a little movement upward. I sold a call at $49, so if it reaches it, I'm out with a profit and a premium. If not, I still got a some premium.
Cash out my nio calls once it hits 50 eow
This. Sometimes you also lock in profits cause it goes up temporarily and then tanks after. Also IV does funny things.
what the fuck was going on with NIO options this morning? The calls I bought when it was at 0% are still in the red by 6% even though it's gone up more than 3% since I bought.
What the fuck is this market
Yes, innocent until proven guilty *is* stupid. Maybe after you get done coloring your molars with Crayola's you can share your thoughts on Women's suffrage with the class?
I'd be safe and get out before close and get back in after earnings if you're worried. Not like it will shoot up to 20 instantly

It‚Äôs insane how you guys don‚Äôt know how to look at charts NIO literally ALWAYS does this, it moons, trades flat a few days, had a healthy consolidation of 14% because it‚Äôs been up 90% in 1 month, and now it‚Äôs simply going to break out to $50, will be $100 by eoy I took the opportunity and bought dips at 39 and 41

I wanna stop losing money and try the wheel strategy. Was thinking about PLTR. What you think?

What makes u think FSR
I see tech taking a dive if he‚Äôs elected. I think most people don‚Äôt realize if it‚Äôs taken through the process it will go to congress. Each states gets 1 vote. It‚Äôs like 36 out of 50 votes that will go in favor of trump. 

Anyone can look up the constitutional process of electing a president. So I can see puts if trump takes office.

If you got money to gamble anything is possible

Youre only 2000 percent away from even, easy money
Dont listen to these cunts. I got fucked as well. Everyone was. Kang market at its best.
That was basically a few of my leveraged tech positions
Can someone call Jeff and tell him to do a stock split? thanks
DIA
Fucking VIX uses every opportunity to moon.

Market drops 0.1% from day's highs and VIX fucking jumps 4%.
It‚Äôs my 3rd largest holding lol
> forcefully economically harm everyone in the pursuit of preserving life. I don't think that's our government's job.

That's literally a main tenant of the institution of government. They cause some kind of small harm in pursuit of a greater good. If the greater good didn't involve harm people would all just do it without government intervention. The issue isn't with the harm in this case, it's that you don't agree that the harm is worth the good.
Rotation back into tech going well

Nevada counting going well

COVID cases going well
I‚Äôm still a fan of the Fisker hype
MGM FINALLY reached 25 and I fuckin missed it....
Only thing that‚Äôs ever green when American stonks take a shit
They doubted NIO, now it‚Äôs approaching 43

Buy calls but December ones
So, you mean if they win both senates at Georgia. Is this a real possibility?
Massive dip buying because ER hype. New update on car technology on their Twitter. XPEV reporting their earnings tomorrow morning
Someone please tell me it was a good idea to bet most of my portfolio on baba calls after the dip also yes I'm poor

[Proof](https://imgur.com/pZWK6FG.jpg)

If you‚Äôre scalping, you should be content on leaving profit on the table. Otherwise grow some balls and add/hold your positions.
2000 shares? you rich autistic fuck boii
And so NIO turns a down day into a 3% up day. God bless this stock.
This mf really edited in snapchat
Thanks guys, I have weathered my account since July and avoided blowing it up many times, I said I would stay out till after elections but it was too juicy, I have secured wins too early MANY times but as some of the vets here have stated, very important to secure your gains
AMD please I can only cum so much
Drumpf wins in the courts Hahahahahahahahaha... HA

Sorry buddy Scratch-N-Sniff Joe is Prez for the next 4 years if he doesn't kick the bucket 1st
Oh nice I didn't know a President-Elect talking with foreign leaders on the future of the transition is the same as a private citizen talking with a foreign adversary about deals that can come in the future. 

BRB have to send in 7000 more ballots as dead people to AZ.
Look at it today fuck face
Fuck no, Markets is in an election and Vaccine pump hangover, think it's finally starting to price in a horribad Covid Winter with this drop....
It‚Äôs an attractive buy up to 155 by next November just make sure you buy out far enough and leave some cash to avg down. Free money all year.
Buying NIO dips is literally free fucking money.
I agree with that other guy, take a break. Either that or Amazon to 3200 or smth.
New York to close restaurants and bars at 10 now
You must be taking a huge shit lol like for real

Should i hold my spy puts
[deleted]
I've been eyeing plug but I've got my eggs all dispersed in different baskets and I didn't have any spare for PLUG. Too late to hop in on the next drop?
The way to play BA is buy calls in 150‚Äôs and sell in 170‚Äôs have u not been paying attention for the last 3 months
Weed bears accounts going up in smoke üòâ
That‚Äôs why puts cost more
No thoughts either
I hate $ACB with an ardent passion.
*options
[deleted]
XPEV TAKE MY ENERGY
Flat
Simply put, yes that‚Äôs a good strategy when buying a long call. High delta, low theta, and low IV is gonna also mean ITM or ATM, and longer dated. Which means paying more in premium.
No no no no no!!!!!! Missed getting in on DDOG calls by barely $0.2 üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[deleted]
will be worth less next week
Am I gonna die?

Add more BABA calls or wait?
I don‚Äôt understand this NIO price action today. Why pump for no reason? Why no BABA pump?
Earnings runup....then maybe sell Tuesday at 3:59.
Your mom
Ive never  bought a call where it didnt drop immediately. i have the worst timing
If you ignore the flood of evictions due to occur one month from now it's a great idea.
what are u playing now
Monster company with great sales QoQ/YoY. as much as I hate the term synergistic, they make synergistic partnerships. They started their Hawthorne brand to dominate the weed business. The goal is to be the people selling the shovels to the gold miners, but for weed. They have a good dividend (i hold them in my IRA). the family that runs it still owns quite a bit which tells me they believe in the brand. 

Options are dog shit on it with no volume. I sell calls just for a bit of premium.
SPY 340 is my new buy the dip point. A 90% effective vaccine is the first actual news we've had in months. Resets expectations.
45 EOD
It works great right now. IMO selling investments is more profitable than actually investing right now, since investors are handing out money like candy. JPOW basically helped create a sellers market. 

Not only did companies not have to worry about raising capital when prices were low, they can now raise even more money while prices are high.
[deleted]
NIO ah prediction?
its ok baba you can have a red day little buddy we will get them tomorrow
All covid stocks are up rn. Yes.
Let's hope I'm right about the open too so I can close my positions and make my pre-ER moves
Haha
why is that?
It is The One.
This aged well üòÇüòÇ
**PSA: IF XPEV BEATS EARNINGS TOMORROW MORNING NIO IS GOING PARABOLIC**
I don‚Äôt understand how a gambling subreddit is so Bull heavy. Green trends are boring as shit. Half percent days, nickel and dimes the way up. Red trends are significant and sudden. So much more potential for OTM.
Take off the tin-foil hat.
GO NIO GOOO
Trump isn‚Äôt going to win without a civil war. Puts on the entire market if that happens lol
Apple puts, LOL
This dude I know has another dude who bought a few of them via some scanning software or whatever. I did have to pay an extra $250 for it though. I couldnt be bothered waiting any longer. Just built a new PC last month in expectations for the 3080 and I need it before Cyberpunk comes out but now that's delayed too. lol 

The new AMD cards should be awesome as well. I was planning to get AMD when it came out but then I found the guy with the 3080.
low volume. bull trap. watch out i‚Äôm holding cash
Nio shook off those paper hands noobs so that the real OGs can bask in tendies üòé
Just buy calls. It‚Äôs not rocket science
Nothing to see here, keep it moving
disappointed
Ya, no. But I‚Äôll sell you some sq puts
Nice, I‚Äôm a boomer with shares
I mean... I went full retard about bought 20c for this Friday, kinda feeling nervous ngl
Thanks China and Jack Ma for the 800 dollar loss on BABA.  Learned my lesson - fuck China.  Switching to shares and holding long.
You could've left my name there, but thanks for sharing here, too funny.
Oh
My 2021 ACB calls are worthless rn
Due diligence
It was news this morning when market opened
Come on Microsoft I need this
It‚Äôs wild looking at the PLTR call options activity all the way up to 25c in massive amounts. Big money knows there‚Äôs some news coming...

20 shares xpev, 2 ddog 80$c 11/20 you godtist better be right
At least at the fortune 500 level,  I've seen a GIANT shift in the last few years over to expansion in Azure and reduction of AWS services....

Granted AWS is so much better in a lot of ways - but the entry point into Azure is just so simple when you are already an office365 customer (every legitimate business is, or will be - at this point)
Being in Gold and Silver gang last three months has been depressing af.

predicts this rise....hmmmmm
Plug looks like such an easy short, no?
I just went to look at the comments of that post and OP sounds dumb as hell.  He's trying to find every possibility to sue his broker LMAO.

The more comments you read, the more dumb the questions get from him.  Its like he didn't know what he signed up for even though he took out the equivalent of a college tuition on margin.
This is the way.
Fuck it all in on NET
Wait, if I do steroids will my dick get that big?
Same
Thanks for the suggestion. I have another output on my dashboard under this, a simple performance graph with a filterable time period, I could make the period match, like last week of performance if we‚Äôre looking at weekly, last month performance for monthly.
[deleted]
16c 11/13 here
Wow RH actually gave me a share of PLUG when I signed up earlier this year. it was like $4 then.
fprx i believe
Trend is your friend bro.
As soon as they Announce partnerships with Apple, Microsoft and Google
VIX is great again, cleanest V shape day in a bit.  Easy scalp
But for real. I'm retarded though. I'm definitely holding. I actually only have shares (I know, it's lame). But I went all in 100% earlier this week on NIO & XPEV. So still risky. I just really like them as mid/long term plays.
and we're off!
Can we call it a rally on 30mil shares at 3pm or is it just a retard drift
Or we could prosecute Biden under the Logan Act for doing the EXACT SAME THING as Gen Flynn. Coin flip?

Nice! Now take break before you lose it all over trading!!
Don‚Äôt be a pussy. Make 60% return on meme stocks, set a stop ‚Äòloss‚Äô limit on 50%. Then buy the dips of some real stocks with the gains

Oxymoron, moron.
Uppies on all those?
Hope it continues through tomorrow. Can‚Äôt sell my positions because I bought more to double down

Nio mooning but IV raping
So what‚Äôs the advice for dummies? Choose an option with relatively high delta, low theta (like the one I‚Äôve???) and low IV ?
same.  We might be a little early, but we're not wrong...
Should I sell nio calls above the strike price? It only seems this stonk goes up
isnt that more for the US than for pfizer. did they get that money upfront? from the wording it doesnt seem like it.
Daily high incoming! The market don't care about no lockdowns or people dying, HA!
I spent a shitload on SPY 220P right at the bottom. They weren't even weeklies. Shit had like 3 months expiry. I just expected us to maybe graze 200 and then settle and maybe bounce a bit.

Well considering how you are in fact retarded. May as well hold because you were probably wrong anyway.

Edit: after taking a look, you‚Äôre likely gonna get fucked holding the bag on a classic therapeutics pump and dump. The good news is hopefully you learn from this. Also I might yolo some puts in your honor.

Lotta big volume candles on GME, will likely be a very high daily volume day...already at average volume per day
NIO
You can both be retarded.
Yeah the vaccine ruined the breakout momentum for SNAP but it will recover before December even starts
You're bending over backwards to defend this. Look at Pfizer price, it has already dropped since the initial announcement

No Chinee
You're bad
In fact, if you observe the trade right now, you can see about 30000 bid and ask exchanging hands to manipulate the price up for sometime. For someone like Peter Theivul who I admire but has interest in data, security, privacy and even FB, I don't even dare imagine what he is capable of to manupulate

Is being accused of sexual misconduct good or bad for a stock?
Today‚Äôs market sell off over Cuomo closing the bars at 10 is dumb as hell. Like you didnt know?

it went to 42. after that the ceo sold and it droped to 38 lol

**SPY DOUBLE BOTTOM**
Understood, I was in long position at 15 yesterday, all in. Then I've witness the craziest shit, a 10% drop in like 5 minutes. I am considering holding long term but it dropped even further to 13.2. It is absolutely ridiculous and I'm sure MM are the only players big enough to influence price that fast.

Logically speaking, they feel the stock is picking up momentum, they purchase large quantity and create more hype, making more people want to buy calls. So they sell their covered calls for a profit and drives the price to where ever profits them the most. It seems the short interest and put interest has been relatively low thus they likely benefitted more from selling calls. Yesterday was just a taste of how they can manipulate the market to their direction (esp if they have insider info on earnings).

Whilst I believe they are definitely great with data analytics and have big clients, and that they could be even bigger if they went B2C, and could be a big name in cloud, data and security for every individual, it may take years and huge volatility. Especially with their secrecy and shoddiness. 

I would like to go long but my experience with yesterday forcing me to sell at the bottom has burnt me such that I am never trusting the manipulation in this stock again. If it goes to 100 I will regret for life but also know I don't have the holding power for a fckin 12% drop teaser yesterday. Just an advice I can offer based on my own weak minded experience

* They have no real proprietary technology (most of their patents are design patents or minuscule in their reach);
* Nikola stealing goodwill: Nikola's patent lawsuit against Tesla was a complete joke; Their name is also just a quick goodwill/cheap brand association grab from Tesla;
* All they have are concept cars with no real ground breaking tech;
* To build their trucks they are getting most of their parts from third parties (i.e., no new tech);
* No one on their earnings call was confident in any of their answers!;
* They admitted to being unable to build the Honey Badger without GM's partnership (i.e., can't build it without use GM's technology and parts)
* And oh yeah, they have fraud allegations against them.

Given the money they raised, I believe they will be able to build a hydrogen fuel cell/electric truck sometime next year. I mean give any company the money they got and with enough engineers and partnerships they can pull off a functional truck too.

But Nikola is bleeding cash and never had any new tech from the start. So why are they up?

Media has NEVER, in the history of the US, EVER been responsible for calling elections.

But they have no authority, and in the eyes of the law, the 2020 election has not been called for either candidate.
Sales always funds R&D.  But in this case Pfizer had no guarantees it could develop/manufacture a vaccine. Pfizer paid for their R&D unlike Moderna which got **paid upfront by US Govt** for R&D.

Where are you getting live data, is wsb discord ? Or just posts on the sub ?
It also just showed NIO take a $3 dip in a matter of seconds so uh, cool. It did the same thing with my portfolio yesterday
This shit again.
My portfolio looks like kang gang two weeks and I haven't done shit
Firstly, a leap definitionally is an option purchased with an exp date more than a year out. So a long dated option is not necessarily a leap but a leap is a long dated option.

It would depend on exp date, is strike atm/itm/otm at time of purchase, value of the underlying at time of purchase. 

A really short OTM call (FD, YOLO, lotto, etc) is usually what you‚Äôre seeing when you see gain porn. Bought 50 contracts for .07 sold for $1.00+ is how you see outrageous amounts of percentage gain on a single trade usually. But that takes yuuuuge price movements. Like ZM most recently. Buying WAY otm puts would‚Äôve made you untold riches if you just tossed 1k at a lotto.

Yes they can. Dry dna/rna is basically totally stable at room temp. I think the problem is that vaccine need other additives (adjuvants is the technical term) in them to ensure they provoke a strong immune response. You could totally store the adjuvants and dehydrated mRNA separately and resuspend the mRNA but that‚Äôs not really possible to do in an FDA approved way outside of a compounding facility.

A few more institutional longs and a share buy back would reduce available float to single digits. Why do shorts not see this coming? It is looking like GME is setting itself up for a proper Squeeze. Probably announce buybacks on a weekend or holiday and the following morning will be chaos. I wonder if Burry seen this coming months ago. Burry if your here would you mind chiming in?

Some unsolicited advice. If you're down 80% 2 days before your call expires, why not just ride it out? If you lose 100%, thats only 20% more than you already did. But with a stock like Nio, you never know ride that bitch out. Thats just me though. Ive been buttfucked numerous because I panic sold.

Buy puts.
Theta is the literal value that the stock will lose each day. You‚Äôre correct about delta. An option is a derivative of the value of underlying and since the value of the underlying is always changing, so are the Greeks. So a big swing of a few dollars would mean your contract will raise more than $.50 on the dollar. If it moves slowly till the date of exp you might never see your profit increase significantly. If it moves against you sharply, the value will decrease significantly in value and you‚Äôll notice it will become much harder for it to make up that lost ground.

This is a pretty big coin flip short term... it could go down back to $12 easy, but also it could jump to $18 and not really fall back down because everyone knows long term it will be a solid hold.

If you believe in it long term and have gains, maybe you take some and hope for a reload after because you would be pissed if it dropped.  If it pops you can rebuy at a slightly higher price in a few months knowing it won‚Äôt matter long term.

If this is an ACB play for you... I mean you are playing with fire, but sometimes you get rewarded...
You‚Äôll just get IV crushed

GO DOWN BABY OH YEAH JUST LIKE THAT

Which put
> Pfizer got $2B from the government via the Warp Speed program for their drug,

No they didn't.  They signed a contract saying they **will** sell the US $2B worth of vaccine if they were able to manufacture it.  

Pfizer has received no money yet.  It's not semantics.  Pfizer paid for the development out of its own pocket  as per the CEO

If you can't understand the difference between development vs. manufacturing/distribution that's on you.
Offering coming. 2 years away from phase 3.

It means that over 99% of their sample is useless and the remaining portion is too small to draw conclusions.

I was gonna say.. AMD and NVDA are up 4% today. Apple and Microsoft are up 3. Hell, even Intel is up 2. It‚Äôs a good day for tech. Online services aren‚Äôt do great, though (like Google, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, etc), but none of them dropped today.
I‚Äôm retarded? Please tell me ANYWHERE in the world where lockdowns eliminated this. The ONLY time it was viable was before it left China but guess what? That boat is long gone.  

I‚Äôm guessing you subscribe to the whole notion of wearing a mask for two weeks will magically eradicate it too?
Anyone else in on SPCE-doing their test flight in 1-2 weeks.  Should go up enough to get some gains out of it.
Meh I doubt lockdown happens. If you‚Äôre in long I wouldn‚Äôt trip, read their guidance

I did exactly this yesterday and it did not work out.
His silence tells you everything
Lots of stories hidden in those weekly candles---alternating up/down days with circuit breakers, technical analysis bears having a field day, crying when DIS closed its theme parks and mooned, back to back to back +/-1000 pt Nasdaq days, crying Bill Ackman, and the infamous Rose Garden Mega Pump.\*

\*when the closest .01 call option on almost any ticker 30m to close was ten dollars ITM by 1m to close. My failing memory wants to say MSFT rose like 20 dollars in 15m.

"Market makers have already made their 100th move."
Carrier Global
Today was a big day though. NIO holders proved a point, it has bottoms and isn't all just fluff. It's only going up from here until earnings. It's a coin toss for next Wednesday though.
Same
I have puts that are now ITM on a stock that is 6% up. I‚Äôm not gonna say what tech stock it is, but super satisfying buying puts on a stock right at the top. This mfer was up 9% earlier and has cut my losses today. Shit I might end the day green. 

Hold or sell puts? ü§îü§î
Bagholding 11/27 320c's right now. It hurts
I only got 5 shares so I am not crying over it lol. Like I wrote to another WSBer here, baba could be state owned at some point. I hate if that happen but I won‚Äôt be surprised. I should know better when Jack Ma got forced out of his own company. ANT ipo and now antitrust? Nah, put our money in a boomer stock is much safer.
NIO to the moon
Nobody really knows if they will enforce aggressively or not... I bought more...baba is a juggernaut
Thank god that If someone ever said ‚ÄúNASQUACK‚Äù in here they would get banned...

All airlines will get worse as the COVID cases spike and vaccine news withers
PLUG calls FTW
This is the way.
Just growing pains.
I bought 150c 11/20 lets go!  Walmart+ is just growing  like crazy
If you have the holding power that is... Willing to hold if say the price drops from $15 to $7.5 due to abysmal earnings, and evantuallly to $3 or $4 if the hype dies out. Remember Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla all dropped below half of their IPO at one point before 10x their value after like 5 or 10 years gradually...
Buying spy 335p 11/27 right before close
I‚Äôm not a Chinese quant or anything but doesn‚Äôt that means the vaccine is not effective at all?
I've been running a shitpost stocks meme page on IG for fun and some of the shit dudes DM me makes you retards seem like geniuses
He made the decision to do this long before there was a vaccine in play. He should‚Äôve opted to NOT follow through with the plan to avoid looking like an ass. Another exec there had the same plan set in place and also chose to look like an ass.
Dudes probably millions in the red by now. Why listen to him lol.
Cracker Barrel do have some tasty biscuits tho
All in calls for power hour, WSB bearish af
Yum!
I created a bot using Python and Reddit's python API wrapper, praw. It pulls comments from the top 175 Hot posts on this sub, then parses them and  counts how many times stock tickers are mentioned. Note: the F count may not be an accurate representation of how many people are talking about Ford, due to members pressing F to pay respect.
yeah I was mostly joking, I don't have any cash anyway lol and I don't want to liquidate my current positions yet

bro i fucked up. i saw the morning dip, was down like 45% for the day, 80% for the last two days, i gave up. if i had held til the 1030am pump id have gotten out with much less of a loss. i hate this sub lmao, blew up my account on a meme stock. gonna stick to paper trading for now i think, im clearly fuckin retarded.

ddog still a play?
So many people are getting excited, because Biontech reported 90% efficiency of their Covid vaccine. What the media doesn‚Äôt say is that only a tiny fraction (0.2%) of their ‚Äúlarge-scale‚Äù study (43,538 participants) was actually exposed to the virus. If you‚Äôre a statistician, now‚Äôs the time to cry, this is noise.
So is it uhhh about to shoot up again

I know what it means. But don‚Äôt understand on a practical sense. Like i know theta means time decay. If the theta is high then it means it loses value quickly for every passing day. This doesn‚Äôt look too high. Delta here says for every $1 move on the stock option rises by $.50
Yo can all u trads stop short squeezing Walmart pls, thx
Pfizer buying back all that stock I bet, classic manipulation.
With $0 revenue. Who is even buying this shit?
Up until yesterday I was 166% up since I re-entered in September. Now because of BABA down to -22%.

Market Manipulators/Movers.
Big banks, financial institutes such as Goldman, JP, Citi, Softbank etc that sells covered options to yall at a profit, then either drives or crash a price depending on which direction earns them the most profit.
Isn't this effect infinitessimally small for any given shareholder? Also, don't we want the squeeze so the stonk moons?
It‚Äôs not how you trade stock like that, earning was gold and price is gonna continue moving. We saw a 16% up 2 days ago. Small correction today and we could easily see 17.50 by Friday. In the premarket seller were at 17.40!
There‚Äôs about to be a whole lot of warm buttholes for sale in hereüëÖüëÑ

"HAHA fuNnY WeEd StOnk Go BrRRrr"
Usually just buying the nearest option when there was a large change, like 6% daily or more. If it fell right below 5.00 for example, I'd buy as many calls for $5 as I could them sell them for profit the same day. It's probably a horrible strategy. I have no idea how delta points work, by pattern trading I mean entirely that I looked at the Robinhood charts over time and guessed if it would go up or down.l based on those alone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Right tax the workers, not themselves.
180 huh?   I think they need to drop but you're pushing the limits there.   The longer you're bagholding those the chances it'll be worth anything go down considerably.   You need it to start dropping fast and get out quick.   I'd wait until it starts to tank.  Next vaccine news maybe. Then swing it pretty quick.  I have too many of these horror stories in my portfolio to recommend.
We tripled our chromosomes that month.

Today was def a much easier day to play than others
Up by 5%
We opened -6% and everyone was saying to buy puts months out. Don't buy NIO puts if you want to make money. Just buy calls far out enough, guaranteed to rally at some point and you can repeat after every dip.
Well GME GANG IT IS!!!

They just acquired all of JCP's real estate for pennies .  SPG gonna own all commercial real estate.  You think we are never going to leave our house again?  

Set your horizon long term. like 10+ years.  Buy SPG to retire on (not today but when the eviction bubble bursts as /u/OTS_ points out)
Pfizer got $2B from the government via the Warp Speed program for their drug, as shown in their own press release and confirmed yesterday by their spokesperson in the NYT. Whether those billions were for research or delivery is purely semantics, and you and me both know this.

From the NYT article referenced in your quote:

‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed, the federal effort to rush a vaccine to market, has promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to deliver 100 million doses to the federal government, which will be given to Americans free of charge. But Dr. Jansen sought to distance the company from Operation Warp Speed and presidential politics, noting that the company ‚Äî unlike the other vaccine front-runners ‚Äî did not take any federal money to help pay for research and development.

‚ÄúWe were never part of the Warp Speed,‚Äù she said on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.‚Äù **On Monday, a spokeswoman for Pfizer clarified that the company is part of Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential coronavirus vaccine.‚Äù**

Softbank has been making some very stupid plays. Is FOMO really reaching even the senior levels of finance!?
Me: Don‚Äôt mention GME, it‚Äôll jinx this pump

GME: \*dumps anyway*
Higher prices on lower momentum and momentum keeps dropping. Could mean buyers are drying up and if it breaks to the downside, could accelerate. It's on a lower time frame so it'll be a quick trade. It's about to hit my trendline at 22.20 and if it rejects, I might jump in. Already popped above earlier today once then got rejected. These are all IFs lol

I‚Äôve been bagholding calls on SDIV since june 8 and it‚Äôs done absolutely nothing but slowly decline since then, until just the past few days it started to move up again

I have RKT leaps, shares, and put credit spreads so I‚Äôm not sweating this but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I expected a flat week. Thought for sure it would at least bump up 5-10% if not more
This will print. But cruises are already off their recent highs pretty much. So may not be much room to fall. I would go puts into something else like way otm SPY or disney puts.

What are good leaps ü§î

Yes ..I sold my dec calls for 150% which I bought this morning
What should I yolo 50% of my net worth on today?
The stock recorded is highest volume since its original price of 25$. The run will be short and profitable it won‚Äôt take months to see 2-3$ price increases
Just buy shares mank
The only question is how high do we gap up tomorrow
Sit back on options cause they expire next May and one is already deep in the money.

If the price tanks after earnings finna accumulate more shares.
I understand. But look at this volatility of one of large companies in the world is just not worth the headache. Plenty of plays in developed countries.
Red tomorrow
Vix will be green by EOD mayyyybe but what im tripping about is, will the market just not give a fuck tomorrow? And slam dunk that hoe back down to 17? Cause bruh thats just what goes down now
I almost sold my entire portfolio of leaps to go all in on AMZN calls this morning. Wish I did I'd be up like 80% but too bad I'm a giant pussy
Dammit to hell. If Biden forgives your student loans I will hunt your stupid ass down and shake your hand.
Covid is back!
Keep going up SPCE
Why would anyone buy a monthly put above the money line?
All trading accounts eventually lead back to zero...
Wasn‚Äôt the GME thing like a month ago why are y‚Äôall still trying to make it happen lol
what makes them complicated? i pay a cpa to do them for me
Alibaba $390 2/19/21... WILL IT PRINT???? Retards assemble!
Waste of money tbh. All the people who got bigly gains at least did monthlies. If you‚Äôre playing short-term, 12/18 is a better bet. Slightly more expensive but not by much.
Let it ride ........
It‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day but for single people in Chyna
Fuck this bot, bro, you do you!
I‚Äôve been getting hurt all day. Nows the time to shine
They write puts. The puts go otm. They get assigned. That becomes your stock buyback. Though this would work much better with buying calls

I'm brand new to this stuff. Am I buying or selling puts? And how much for 1 put?
IV is sky high. I wouldn‚Äôt risk it but you do you bro
Just a warning, you are against the big players who noticed this stocks. These MM fake pumps will kill you if you FOMO now. Never underestimate their power at driving from $15 opening yesterday to $13.2 in 10 freaking minutes. 

Since majority WSB are pro PLTR, yall better be ready for an insane crash the likes of which never seen before if they remain profitless. It could go other way too tho but always inverse wsb
If you had mistyped the N and the I you would have made thousands.

Masa should be applying for mods position of WSB üòÇ
When will you sell, certain price target in mind or other indicators? Pretty sick call to go for that one though
AMD calls?
So many of you right now are thinking 'Wow, so it's finally time for me to get in on HYLN! This is surely the real consistent run-up.' Well it fucking isn't. That run-up will never, ever, come. It's like the boobs Kenny and Gerald watch to touch on the cat-pee episode of Southpark. You never really get to see them or touch them. Don't get me wrong, I've made hundreds of dollars on HYLN calls. But I've lost thousands more. Playing options on HYLN is truly the lowest, most degenerate form of gambling.
Yea my plan is with another positive day tomorrow to sell my shorter dated calls and only hold the February ones through earnings, if were red or flat tomorrow I‚Äôll hold them
Do t do it bro
Nclh puts. Lots and lots of eow nclh puts and a few for next week, 18-20$

>It invested another $3.4bn in equity derivatives. The trades included ‚Äúlong call options‚Äù ‚Äî bets on rising stock prices that provide the right to buy stocks at a preset price on future dates ‚Äî that were worth $4.7bn by the end of September.

look at the SPY 1year chart. look for big red dildo going down. that is where lockdowns have been bearish.

According to a site that's banned on here, NKLA jumped today in sympathy to "a hydrogen partnership between Cummins and Navistar announced earlier today has turned a spotlight back on hydrogen Class 8 trucks."

I guess that puts more pressure on GM to close the deal with NKLA.

What's MM?
GME sucks fml
PLTR has murky links to CIA, was private for years - but never made a profit. Rumours of links to Dems therefore with Biden as POTUS = juicy contracts. Suspicious the IPO was for insiders to cash in, not for retail to share!   


Then again what do I know?

Implied move over ER is +/- 10%.  Needs to be recalculated tomorrow afternoon.  Max pain is 41, even if it jumps on earnings there‚Äôll be a selloff all day.

Also throw a little in spce calls. I see potenshal. No dd, all guts!
Hold my PLTR options down 40% and hope for earnings or take my losses?
Nope they deny me
It‚Äôs not a bad idea to buy into SPCE and sell covered calls

Yeah, good note for all fellow autists here. Had $12.5c Nov20 from last week, sold all, secured profits and rolled up to $15c yesterday. Will sell at 3:50pm tomorrow. Added a few leaps $20c Feb21 will gamble through earnings.

WTF happened to GME
If you ever wonder why these stocks magically jump out of thin air, you have to understand banks and institutions are selling juicy high premium Puts on majority of the these stocks and indexes, so when they feel their positions have the risk of being in the money, they literally pump the whole market up, giving it more wiggle room. It called range bound. Its notorious among big dogs. And understand that several of these dogs are holding hands doing these dirty trick.

Nice DD I‚Äôm in
I live in the city where it's HQed and I worked for them for a few weeks (I moved for college) as a driver. It's down for several reasons 

1. Wall St thinks it's a COVID stock. It's not and never was. 
2. Attacked directly by hurricanes lmao
3. Earnings call was 6 minutes ...? CEO seems to only be interested in acquisition. Fine by me 
4. Volume is down. Follow the volume and RSI and you can see the trend is weak. 

Get the app and see what they're doing. They're HEAVILY promoting themselves, possibly at their short term expense. Orders are often free now because they want more customers, and they just added grocery delivery and alcohol delivery. I don't use the service for delivery, just pick up because I'm not a lazy retard who needs food delivered to me. I believe in this stock more than any other in my portfolio and it's the only one I've really done serious tech and fundamental analysis on. 

It hurts to have 1,500 shares of it at $3.13 because my portfolio is down 10-20% because of this stock, but I'm trying to ignore it and further lower my basis. I'd suggest buying around $2.40 and never turning back. 

Too volatile to buy options, in my situation.
But you just got 1

Frustrating seeing the rest of the market pump ü•¥
im dumber for reading this
Probably smarter than us getting 100 for today at same price...
It's barley a hurricane calm down
if RKT's ER was so good why did the 3 analysts that cover this piece of dogshit all lower their PTs? The 1B buyback is odd when they just sold 1.8B in stock during the IPO, but regardless it should be higher imo. If and that's a big *if* \- it goes up, it'll probably happen in 2 days of +10% short squeezes
You might be on to something here young autist, nio just started warming those thrusters around the time you replied to this.

Quick share all your positions so we can make money!
Logi went up like $20 on it‚Äôs earnings doesn‚Äôt take a genius to bet on it going back down a bit. I just got lucky with the vaccine timing and people apparently offloading it
So many of you right now are thinking 'Wow, so it's finally time for me to get in on SPCE!  This is surely the real consistent run-up.'  Well it fucking isn't.  That run-up will never, ever, come.  It's like the boobs Kenny and Gerald watch to touch on the cat-pee episode of Southpark.  You never really get to see them or touch them.  Don't get me wrong, I've made hundreds of dollars on SPCE calls.  But I've lost thousands more.  Playing options on SPCE is truly the lowest, most degenerate form of gambling.
I bought yesterday and it was way higher

If there was a single stock you could beat the shit out of who would it be? And why $BABA?
Relative to where it was it was pretty oversold
My issue here is the stock grew 40+% this week. And it‚Äôs projected to make a profit. It‚Äôs first profit since 2003? Am I missing something here?
You were saying?
Hella bearish divergence on SPCE. Thinking about picking up some puts if it breaks below 22.

Hey Baba, figure it out ya fuckhead

I have a stop order placed at around 50% profit. I‚Äôm selling before close. Let‚Äôs see how high this baby can go, at 60% gain rn
Probably the right call if you're long.
I like how you added ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù, I think that‚Äôs going to carry a lot of weigh this time around. Added $12.5c and $15c weeklies last week and this week, will sell most at 3:50pm tomorrow. Also added Feb21 $20c leaps I‚Äôll hold through earnings
It‚Äôs risky, it‚Äôll spike when Astrazenica releases news but that could be before or after the expiration. If it was like January I‚Äôd say hold but I‚Äôd personally close that out
More COVID means more stimmi so fuck it go long
techs not dead

and wait for a negative covid day. tech gonna pop
My strangle on ACB is getting fucked now. Spread too wide. If it goes up 20% from here, I recover. If it goes down 50% from here, I recover. If it stays flat, I'm fugged.
So who's the one-up? Your wife's (VP's) boyfriend?
Imagine believing this buffoon. It's already in the 42s
Does that mean buy rn?
Hope you got in on this when I posted it, still time tho

Just a warning, these MM fake pumps will kill you if you FOMO now. Never underestimate their power at driving from $15 opening yesterday to $13.2 in 10 freaking minutes. 


Since majority WSB are pro PLTR, yall better be ready for an insane crash the likes of which never seen before if they remain profitless. It could go other way too tho
Fair enough.
I bought the dip hard at 280 but I didn't know it was a 7 layer dip.

It has killed the upside of the rest meme stocks in the order of thousands
Jumped big this morning. Wait for a drop to enter, or just buy in and hope it doesn't crater between then and now?
it already is worse. market see vaccine market go WHEEEEEEEEE
covid has been getting worse SINCE march, market gave no singles fucks about it
Maybe but expect a value stock sell off and more tech rotation  in a week or so as covid cases skyrocket and lockdowns begin

YOLO is the only way to roll. All in or nothing.
If I see another PLTR or NIO comment I'm going to end myself
I really hope so. If that wasn‚Äôt the bottom then so many of us are fucked
That‚Äôs how I got to this point üòÇ
Too many NIO posts lately which means we will get cucked during ER üñïüèºüêª
That's what I'm thinking tbh
Is it safe to buy back into the tech stocks that were beat up yet?
If my 12/4 puts pay out, I'm getting a NIKOLA t-shirt. They should have at least $20 for the creditors to fight over in bankruptcy court.
Lol yep. Just did. üòÇüòÇ
They haven't turned a profit in 17 years.  I wouldn't hold thru earnings, take the profit from the run up
baba is teasing the fuck out of my cock and balls
Absolutely
They might have been right if BA didn‚Äôt decide to raise another $2.5B.
$1.00 --> $0.01   -99%

$0.01 --> $0.02  +99%
Nancy Pumplosi will be promising us a stimmy for the next four years $$$
Whats good with tsla? We seeing $700 or $200 eow?

The other thing about being a bear is that when good companies dip, bulls see it as a buying opportunity. When good companies go up, it doesn't always trigger a sell off (otherwise stocks would never go up, as every profit would be taken). This puts bears on the backfoot always, unless they find a total piece of shit stock, but then why was the stock high in the first place? You're just so much more likely to find a stock that is, on average, going up more than its going down. Shit stocks go to very low numbers and then stay there, but that caps bears profit potential.

TL;DR - Being a bear is stupid.
So what‚Äôs gonna happen with BA... do I hold on for dear life

That's the right retarded mindset to have, good on you. We retards don't lose until we hit 00.00

> **We were never part of the Warp Speed,‚Äù Pfizer vice president Kathrin Jansen** told the New York Times. ‚ÄúWe have never taken any money from the U.S. government, or from anyone.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúPfizer, unlike its competitors, did not join Operation Warp Speed, the government initiative designed to erase the financial risk of vaccine and therapeutics development by providing funding to companies and helping coordinate the trials,‚Äù The Washington Post‚Äôs Carolyn Y. Johnson reported Monday. ‚ÄúInstead, Pfizer plowed $2 billion of its own money into the project and then struck a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to provide 100 million doses, contingent on the vaccine being effective.‚Äù


> The Department of Health and Human Services website makes the distinction clear. In March, HHS gave $456 million to Johnson & Johnson as it pushed to find a vaccine. In April, it gave $483 million to Moderna. In May, it announced that it would provide up to $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca‚Äôs effort.


>**In September, the CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, appeared on CBS News‚Äôs ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù where he was asked about not accepting government funding for development.**

I wanted them ‚Äî basically I gave them an open checkbook so that they can worry only about scientific challenges, not anything else.‚Äù

You guys know all the weed stocks are Canadian right? Weed won‚Äôt be legal in the us for a long time(unfortunately) and decriminalizing it doesn‚Äôt do anything for the companies you are buying into
Im with you mate, this stock is so manipulated as hell, freaking crashed $1 in 5 minutes when I decide to put all my savings to buy the stock yesterday at open...
Profitless company, unable to scale, highly manipulated by MM so majority of call holders (many from this sub), always inverse WSB
That should be the WSB tag line anytime someone mentions that shithole stock.
Repositioned from 12/18 42c to 12/18 50c. The return is just a better deal all around for that position, and not to mention its got a massive OI.
weird everything says tm
Always thought people that are into the markets was smart, oo boy was I wrong
What is this garbage?
Oh I‚Äôve definitely eliminated tendies 

That was the first thing I tried

Is there any way of seeing an options price history for the day (the graph) without owning the option itself?
SPY is a fat fuck right now
-99% and gains ain‚Äôt 1

Sorry Guys, I forgot to post it to WSB and only posted it to a few people, that my fault but there plenty of time for entry.
Made some money on puts after it hit 114 the other day.  Premiums are high though

99% of people who discuss stocks on the internet are trolls
I did initially, but I think they‚Äôre lack of profit was 1. Due to the fact they had gov projects ongoing from the start and 2. They hadn‚Äôt really deployed or had a chance to properly market their products commercially. They‚Äôre currently being used by hedge funds and I only think this is going to get bigger and bigger as these commercial clients realise how powerful data can be when it‚Äôs easy to analyse and all in one place. I truly, truly believe that data is the new currency in tech and having a backer like Peter Thiel, as controversial as he is, is a pretty solid stamp of approval. I think this company has the potential to be the Amazon of big data. Snowflake caters for the small timers but Palantir will be the product for the biggest companies out there

Cries in NFLX
I mean he definitely knew but was prolly like every company will have autonomous driving at some point and I'd rather get the in on a billion customers while everyone else catches up.
Who's sick of hearing about NIO?
Maybe that pump wasn‚Äôt to increase the market but to increase American‚Äôs hope during what will be a really bad two-three months. Hearing about a vaccine by March with ‚Äútrials showing 90% effectiveness‚Äù keeps the population calmer

Congrats, what were your plays
I agree that American weed companies are better from a fundamental standpoint but thats simply not where the money flow is. It's better to invest in Canadian weed stocks because thats where all the big money is in, not OTC American weed stocks. Prime example: look at how small the OTC American weed rally was compared to the Canadian weed rally. American rallied like 20-40% while Canadian ones went 100%+. You gotta follow the big money so I'mma stick with Canadian ones until the money flow changes. Also, not all of them are bad. $TLRY and $CGC are my favorite ones.
I believe in you GME

AMD breakout.
It can dip on XPEV and LI ER
Imagine being a bear
I think it's tested it's support and gotten a channel established. Really hoping this is good news -- can support a ~20% drop from 45 to 38 and rally back... fuck man, too much hope!!

NIO @ 200 by EOY!!!
Lol ACB
That would make NIO the 3rd highest marketcap automotive company in the world.. Higher than VW, BMW, GM.

It is all hype, their market is luxury EVs in China, it won't be the no.1 seller. It is NOT backed by CCP unlike the retards in WSB say, it is only invested by a 2nd tier city government.
Weak hands mfs are crying rn
stop trying to make GME squeeze, gretchen. IT'S NOT GONNA SQUEEZE!!!!

I am genuinely confused as to how SoftBank lost $3.7bn betting on tech over covid. They should have made an absolute fortune..
Hey kids, let me hip you to a fresh, new hot stock that is going to take over the technology sector. 

This company makes computers that fit on your lap and they make crazy phones that have no wires, fit in your hand and have no buttons. 

It‚Äôs called AAPL and it‚Äôs going to the Mooooon
Fucking acb stay down so I don't play you
Growth stocks‚Äô revenge
These are the days you have to thank your ass for allowing you to sit on it while raking in gains
I think the run up into earnings is definitely pricing in a good earnings. Good decision with the puts as a hedge
ACB is a joke.

Why did I not load up on calls EOD yesterday?? Not sure what to hold next lol

Retard here. On the options screen, why are some of the prices red and some green?
Yeah if this goes green I might do the same
[deleted]
spy puts are a good move. bearish as more lockdowns start again
Yea I think if we close green at all and XPEV beats it‚Äôs guaranteed Tendie town
It‚Äôs not too late for Nio. It will run up until earnings
1 share EDP

5 shares ET

First time buying, wish me luck
0.7? When was it that lol.
I literally just did that
If you didn‚Äôt buy zoom calls today you‚Äôre retarded
nope, I have seen this NIO move before. 3 PM dump and afterhours pump
Don‚Äôt you fucking remind me the 2021 $2C I sold for a 20% profit back in Dec 2019
He's one of us!
I said that at NVDA 500 and Tesla 400. Who the fuck is panic selling so hard down there lol. Retards...
Certainly
I know i f-ed up. I'm more of a long term holder of stocks though. Looking over 3 yr period, BABA has been on a uptrend  and is a company that's not going bankrupt anytime soon. I wanted to invest and forget about it for a year like I did with APPL, MS, AMZN and VOO. I didn't expect this stock to have a sudden 10% drop right after I bought (crying). Sudden systemic drops like this, however, have a higher likelihood to recover compared to other drops (earnings, legal battles, etc.) Look at the COVID drop in March, the drop in September, etc. So I am optimistic that given 3-6 month period this stock will go back to the $300 range cause its battling a Chinese regulation (a systemic shock to the whole tech sector in China), unlike declining sales, competitors taking it over, or Trump tweeting against it. My one year analysis is that it should overall do better than ETFs (annual 8% return) just because Alibaba is growing faster and looking to invest in many other tech sectors in China as well, which is overall on the incline.  But NONETHELESS, your right that i should have done a gradual investment in it, will keep that in mind going forward for other large trades.
Should‚Äôve left some runners. You know like sell half then let the other ones run. Then sell a few more and so on.

I always lose money so I decided to buy some NIO puts to help the rest of WSB out. This should send it over $50 when earnings release. You can thank me by sending me your pizza coupons that come in the mail once you start ordering filet mignon delivery instead.

200,000 is way closer to a flood than waymo's 600. And with Tesla growing to 900,000 cars sold/yr next year, that's another 180,000 FSD Teslas from that one year alone. 

Waymo will be active in a few cities. Tesla's getting the world-wide $2 trillion robotaxi revenue. No other company can even collect the data to compete. At this point, they'll be out of business long before they even get the chance to really start collecting the data needed.
I have 155 shares of palantir at 11.55 but I have puts for earnings just in case this goes full data dog we shall see my boys!

You could set a stop limit so if it dips hard you will keep some profit but let it run if it keeps going up
NIO $50 by eow?
LMAO, that nigga ACB really did plummet 20% and rallied back 20% in one day
It's going down. They aren't making any money
The only way Covid impacts the market is if business disruption happens. Cases on their own are a meaningless statistic.
What a great day
Why did I sell my ZM calls and buy SPY puts this morning. FML
They get your order flow anyways, doesn‚Äôt really matter.
Glad the market is acting normal for a couple days
NIO you show me a price of 45, I‚Äôll quit my job and divorce my wife and come work for you
BA max pain? Horrible stock !!!
let it run untill monday or even tues open. FOMO is going to bring alot of buyers
Ah, yes giant green dildos ramming through nios ass. Stock will be 75 after earnings and my December call will be ITM ü•∫

would lockdown affect aapl calls rly bad
Someone stop me from yoloing spy 356p fd‚Äôs please please

It's not.  If they reported last week, Pfizer still gets the stock bump.

Suspicious behaviour would have been to move up the announcement.
Got in 11/20 $170c

Hope so. My shares still sitting at .70 lol
So are my 11/20 305c fucked??
Thanks Dad
The oil straddle was bought yesterday, I don‚Äôt care where it moves but it‚Äôs not staying flat after a 20+% jump from nowhere
I think IV dropped a lot for a lot of stocks today. I have a spy call expiring December 31st, being up $3 today should have given me a bit over $100, but I only got about 60-70.

>Pfizer didn't directly control when they released results.

Lol Pfizer gets to choose the *exact* date and time when they take private information and make it public. And the date/time they chose was right before this stock sale. It's not like there was some automatic trigger that published the press release as soon as some metric was hit. It was a choice. In fact they didn't need to make this press release at all because they are publishing the results via FDA in another two weeks. But *someone* thought "hey this exact date and time might be a good time for a press release"

Taking them as prescribed doesn‚Äôt have the same negative effects as abusing them. At a certain point I was doing 300-400 mg every Tuesday & Friday night and playing Halo Reach - was a dumb kid. 

That being said, after many hours of google research (lol) I would contend that while you feel totally fine, your brain has still likely gone through some massive changes in those ten years because of that medication. I would guess that trying to get off them now would be a many months long process with severe and lasting consequences. 

Obviously if you‚Äôre content with where you‚Äôre at and are not feeling depressed/anxious/bad in general and are ok being dependent on the med, more power to you. There‚Äôs really nothing wrong with that as long as you feel it‚Äôs sustainable. My bigger message here is just don‚Äôt trust psychiatry blindly; do your own research and do it well.

Not going to get any sort of dip today eh? hmmmmm
It'll probably have it's biggest weekly gain ever the week after your option expires.
Yes, they are. But in order for GM to get the money for this accounts receivable ‚Äúasset‚Äù they need to borrow. GM financial borrows money and shows this as debt, then they loan that money out at a higher rate and show it as an asset as well. This is why GMs assets and debts are both inflated. All major automakers do this.

GME ready for next leg up ‚úàÔ∏è
Appreciate it!
On what time line? Cuz on the daily, for it to be a bearish engulfing it would need to top yesterday and then go back below yesterday as well. Yesterday was more bearish but held support. Actually nicely the bottom like from 37 to 38 with a strong resistance around 45. Higher bottoms. Higher highs. Amazing earnings around the corner. Avg 12 month target of $155 a share. If anything this looks like Tesla from 220-330 before if went to 550 and THEN up to 960 before selling off. I‚Äôd say we have a looong time before nio gets a huge sell off. People aren‚Äôt selling their shares man üòÇ

I'm on a shitty broker called Trade Republic, I was just simplifying "short" warrants with a forced stop loss. Hence why I said lose my profits, since when this sl gets hit the warrant becomes worthless even if the underlying drops afterwards.  

And to your broker question, I think IBKR has "real" options
Absolutely agree, fact that it hasn‚Äôt drilled to the core of the earth blows my mind a little.  The fact that they are diluting again because it‚Äôs the only way to keep the lights on should be a giant warning flare but naw let‚Äôs keep buying.

Best of luck to you if you are still holding though.

Why was it not "priced in" at the previous console cycle? Why did it continue to rise after release and stayed at very elevated levels for more than a year afterwards? Why is it that, just like previous console cycles, the stock at sitting at the same level it would be at this stage in the cycle (i.e. the beginning)? What makes you think it's gonna be *worse off* this time around, when GameStop is in the execution stage of a massive turnaround and pivot to e-commerce?

The truth is you can't answer these questions and still be so certain that GME is going to fail. Not if you're being honest with yourself, anyway. 

You've been presenting straw man arguments, claiming market sentiment is negative for GME solely on the basis of your own personal opinions and preferences with gaming, and rejecting any possibility that the stock will continue to perform in the near future. I don't think you're ready to have a logical argument about GME because of your own biases. If you were, you would already know *why* there is a great upside potential and *how much*.

Idk man, the bull sentiment has to be getting exhausting. Some stocks have taken major fucking hits in the last 4-5 days. Something will give, and bears haven‚Äôt even made a true showing yet. Volume validates that atleast.

Yes sir! This is the good news I needed to see today. $17k deep in shares and calls
Natasha Haughey
On October 12, FSLY hit $136 while NET was hovering around $41. A month later, FSLY is $71 while NET is $65. Whoever predicted that reversal made BANK! I have always maintained NET is superior to FSLY and for the long term, I'll bet on NET. I just didn't expect then to switch so quickly.

P.S.
Yes I know share price is different from market cap. But there is still a psychological effect of share price. For example, for a long time, AMD share price was always smaller than INTC but as soon as AMD overtook INTC, it mooned. I anticipate something similar will happen with NET and FSLY.

Mmm.. It's kind of looking bad for you right now
Imagine not owning PLTR
Why would you sell so soon?
That is a fucking problem.
Do it paper hands, allow them to be housed by a better father.

People wait for a mean reversion to buy
Cash out while you still have some extrinsic value from the high IV then buy your positions back after earnings and IV crush. Premiums will drop, regardless of their earnings, then go long again while the IV thus premium is lower
Ill probably hold, i got a debit spread and the buy close to being ITM
Kinda want to hold PLTR through earnings tomorrow but I don't want to pull another RKT

NIO 50 EOD
the price is too high.   I have traded it for 6 mos.   get in at the 60s (or better yet.. when it dips to high 50s) then it runs up the to high 70's low 80s  except for once to 90.   then sell.   then wait for the dip again and redo.
Are you not approved for level 3?
is weed back on the menu?
Nah retail investors will pull out money soon because of the holidays.
Short-term it‚Äôs finite. Long-term it‚Äôs infinite, as companies will dilute everytime the employee share pool runs out. To get around this quicker, comp plans use stock option grants, which are capped at notional values and dilute equity when exercised. 

Yes, you can just print money. That‚Äôs actually how it works right now. Thanks JPOW
Tim Aapl <3
if nio passes 41.77 its going to moon
My spread is 430/440 but there's plenty of time on it so I'm letting it run. I have become gun-shy too after learning my lesson and not taking profits before the markets tanked pre-election. I was sitting on good gains and lost all of them. So now I try not to FOMO over potentially higher gains - profit is profit and 10% is better than a lot of others :)
I feel like only bulls are buying though. Paper hands leaving as we hit green, bulls coming in. That‚Äôs good

Idk man, GM could be the next tesla since they're jumping into EVs. I wonder if they have beaucratic bullshit holding them back though. Musk seems to ignore all of that which is why they've done so much so fast

My mom got the vaccine trial and said the following few days were pretty brutal but she just tested positive for the antibodies. Very much anecdotal but compared to the Pfizer vaccine it doesn‚Äôt need to be stored at such low temperatures so it will have wider availability if cleared

Imagine being a day trader on the west coast waking up at fuckin 6:15am. I‚Äôd be even more of an alcoholic.
Everyone is ready for it, no disruption or surprise. When it went to highs it wasn't because of COVID, it was because of uncertainty about COVID and a downward spiral of margin calls that sent stock prices into the shitter and caused crazy volatility until people could assess and get their financial leverage under control.
What u thinking brother?

We have a deep freezer at our facility, not sure exactly how low it goes though. Probably not a lot of money at the hospital level as each facility would only need to purchase one freezer for the vaccine. What would be big is if retail pharmacy‚Äôs are confirmed to be getting vaccines and have  to upgrade their storage as they most likely only have a small regular freezer and there are a lot more sites.

What closing info?
Is it time to buy NIO calls for earnings?!?
You think that‚Äôs the one? I was looking last night and could only find Pelican Bio Thermal, which owns Nanocool, that has the products already for this. But they‚Äôre a private company
Seema Mody from CNBC can get all 4 inches
Isn't this their first earnings as a public company? I would also imagine with alot of election issues there might be a need for the government to monitor unrest?
I‚Äôd stick to value if you‚Äôre looking to profit off the vaccine. Hospitals already have the refrigeration necessary since it‚Äôs about - 2-8 degrees C (not -70 lol i think you mean‚Äôt F). That‚Äôs a few degrees below water‚Äôs freezing point lol
Still at 530 P/E rofl.

Never jump on a things like that. You have to go in before hand. High speed traders will see orders from idiots flooding in and sells before their order hits the market.
Yes, saw that. However still think there‚Äôs upside potential when they release and it‚Äôs positive.

When I say less debt, I‚Äôm talking on a ratio level. Debt-to-asset. Obviously their total outstanding debt isn‚Äôt lower, but on a ratio to their assets GM has far less debt. When most people within finance talk about one company having less debt than a competitor, they aren‚Äôt talking about total debt, they‚Äôre talking about the debt-to-asset ratio or debt-to-equity of the companies. Because Nios equity ratio is inflated at the moment due to a bubble in the stock, it‚Äôs more appropriate to use debt-to-asset in this circumstance.

Why tf is ACB mooning
PFE and MRNA use the same technology. If PFE works 90% then MRNA which is weaker should be in the 70-80% range. Results of phase III will be out later this month. MRNA vaccine is stored a warmer temperature than PFE so should be easier logistically.

Leveraged etfs are risky, a big pull back requires an even greater gain in the underlying to recover. It won‚Äôt return to pre-COVID levels any time soon even if everything it holds does. 

Also, just based on my experience with it, DFEN seems to swing mostly based on Boeing‚Äôs movements and Boeing is the embodiment of kang gang .

Hey China your economy is fucking trash 

Prove me wrong I dare you 
(BABA bag holder)
wtf ACB
Hang on, how can it be infinite? Are we talking about the same thing? The issuance of new shares needs to draw from some pool. Once the pool is empty, the rest of the company must be diluted to get more equity in the employee pool, or the shares issued to employees need to be private and worth a different amount than public shares right? You can‚Äôt just print money
[deleted]
11/20
it's kind of a holiday today
Buying MRNA calls on the dip Tuesday was such easy money. We JUST confirmed that mRNA vaccines are wildly effective via pfizer... And people sell off a company based entirely around that technology?? Lollll this market

that means theres no share to borrow... In order to short sell, the brokerage must have stock of that company or have stock from other people's margin account. The broker takes the stock and allows you to sell them and when you click buy they return it to the owner.

Most of those companies actually issue more shares to give to employees, which means more dilution.

The Japanese version is better
Right? How the fuck does that work as a defense. It‚Äôs not like CEO is unaware of when the announcement would be made.
Ummmmmmmm welp
Zoom is operating system agnostic (unlike FaceTime), Skype fell apart as a product after Microsoft bought it and ignored it.
Ugh this bitch needs to tank some more already. They are flooding the market with stocks (again..) this should be a penny stock.
Should I hold pltr call though to Friday or cash out before earnings
The immediate issue of getting the doses to everyone at -80c was pointed out on BBC news this morning. There's very few labs setup for that kind of work.
Didn't even think of looking at the holdings. TSLA at the top. Looks like NVTA was a really good buy as well.

This is just gambling. When it comes to options, we're all shooting in the dark.
Not a huge deal since you‚Äôre holding them but if you were on a broker that actually shows you TA indicators you would‚Äôve seen that was a terrible time to buy, better luck next time

Either way the CEO is selling after reporting the vaccine data.  He's getting that bump regardless.
This is called sector re-rotation.
If there is a boost after earnings, do you sell right after or hold?
It's gonna climb to $42 at 3PM and open +$3 tomorrow.

That's fair. Cramer is really good at describing market paradigms, but just like anyone else, he is pretty bad a predicting when those paradigms will shift.

If you're doing short term plays with calls, then I think his TA isn't really for that. He's generally describing long term trends and companies with sound fundamentals for people who would generally use their brokerage account to play roulette. I made a ton of money on PLUG, but that's short term speculation interest post election. I don't think he's wrong that alternative energy stocks like PLUG will see more growth in the future, but I'm not going to say "He was right!!" just because retail meme traders have run it up 50% in 4 days.

I made decent gains also doing the same thing in terms of depressed stocks in strong industries, but you do have to be somewhat careful to differentiate between unfashionable stock and badly run company.
So TLT isn't correlated to this?

Yup. 11/20 tho. I think it will get there by next week. Just needs another 10% drop.

Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has sold stake worth $5.56 million, according to a regulatory filing that showed the sale was made on Monday, the same day the drugmaker reported positive data on its experimental COVID-19 vaccine.

Bourla sold 132,508 shares at $41.94 per share, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Tuesday.

Pfizer said on Wednesday the sale was part of a pre-announced trading plan, adopted by Bourla on Aug. 19.


Some people have all the luck. Selling shares on a trading plan that just happens to intersect with a major announcement?  Fortituous to say the least.
I should buy 10 ZM 500c 11/20 tomorrow and definitely FOMO
I‚Äôm all for the valuation and prospects but it‚Äôs painful the number of times tech beats top and bottom line and the stock price shits the bed.

AMD about to blast off
In perspective: I bought in @ 3.65 a call for HD nov 20 285 ... that dropped to 1.7 a call on Tuesday. It is now @ 3.95 ... basically if I had averaged down hard, I would be looking at 132% profit right now. If I didn‚Äôt have money tied up in another play I would have gone all in at 1.7 ... that said, it‚Äôs oversold on its value and will have a big holiday season. Market is dangerous but, for an earnings play it seems like a lower risk call option to play towards. You do you though and good luck!

Most of those youtube trading gurus are crap anyway. They're mainly content creators and many of the ones who make a decent amount of money trading have the advantage of having a big following that they front run which is why so many of them focus on low float penny stocks.

Many beginners look at the profits these guys make and think they can replicate it, not realizing that it's not possible without building a big following of their own to front run.

Wow. Another WSB retard. It‚Äôs both dumbass. Look for yourself at the financial statements. It‚Äôs presented pretty clearly. Look at Ford‚Äôs debt for example. It‚Äôs the same deal. Ford credit makes up the vast majority of their debt. Major auto manufacturers will take on debt through their financing wing (GM financial, Ford credit, etc) but this debt isn‚Äôt debt in the traditional sense, it‚Äôs more like debt a bank would maintain. These financing services borrow money (and show it as debt) and then loan that money out at a higher rate (inflating their assets). Here‚Äôs an article that may help explain it to you.

1) Don't sell options on a meme stock.

2) Don't fomo and buy a put when a stock had two -5% days in a row. If you bought ZM put yesterday you would've lost 2k.

This is an extract from an italian song I like about Dante's inferno, it wasn't applied in this context but it can be applied and it rhymes, so it came to my mind. It can be translated in "It's bullshit that words hurt more than a sword. What do you think holds people off the most, a kissed rhyme or a spiked club?"

Ah, also, I've not "justified child labour", I've said it's way complicated, from a moral standpoint it's not a dichotomous choice, it's like the train lever dilemma, on one side you have child labor but wages, on the other you don't have child labor but those children are starving

While you accused me of "justifying child labor" I am from a family which, with a group of other families, send each motnhs altogether ‚Ç¨5,000 to a village in Burkina faso to provide food, water, medicine, education etc etc to the children who live in that place.

The market hates uncertainty. This fall/winter surge of Covid is terrible, such that the reality of the situation will be worse than March/April. However, we have much less uncertainty, so the market won't react as badly to it.

In riding ZM heavy. Vaccine news is an overreaction. Will take a while to be approved if it even does. Then it will take almost half a year for it to be distributed after months of mass production, which won‚Äôt happen unless they‚Äôre certain it works. Also kids aren‚Äôt going back after thanksgiving for finals, so dead week and finals week will be remotely administered. Guess when finals are? Nov, December. Guess when ZM earnings are? December

Hey wise guy. Take your logic and reasoning over to r/investing
I average down as well. Been practicing on penny stocks. Figured if I can get a good win rate with those, blue chip stocks should be easier. I know with those, a lot of the action is pre-market and right at opening even though I usually get in on the pull back after the morning run.

100% that's what happened. This news would have been released by the FDA 2 weeks from now when it receives final approval, but the CEO put out a company PR statement early to pump the stock. It's as simple as that.

Zoom mooning means Peloton could moon as well?
Haha my bad.
WHOEVER NEED TO HEAR THIS. 

SELL YOUR ZOOM CALLS NOW!
I'm very loose about things--I'm very happy with a 1% day? In general, I view what opportunity I see that's on the table--can't really dictate how big of an opportunity it is? I guess my big trade of the day I want to make like 500-1000, and then I might poke around to get a few hundred here or there scalping. 

I'm not very in the know about this stuff, as you can see, but I theorize that if I start to watch a bunch of other traders on YouTube or what have you, it will mess with my mojo. I'm sure I'm like every other idiot that thinks he's on to something but it's been working out so far.
ZM is mooning because CNBC described how bad the covid situation is. That has to be the reason why. When those graphs showed up. ZM took off.

I bought a single OTM 11/13 NIO call. Gettin pretty wild in here. 

All my buying power is in PINS January calls (PINS is all house money I made from the last earnings report) and AAPL leaps.
Wtf just happened to Zm
nope. not touching Zoom with a sudden run up like that

Why do I keep seeing NUGT plays did I miss something

NIO will overtake the market just like Tesla did it. Their cars actually looküòè
can amazon go to 3300 already, acting like a boomer stock
question, I sold a put and im down money on it, if I want to hold until expiration what if the person i sold the put to just sells the contract i sold him for a profit? or does it not work like that and ill always have my put i sold up until sxpiry because there will always be a buyer?

ZM: See you on the flip side of the moon....
What am I in denial of? Me having a different outlook on a stock than you doesn't mean I'm in denial.


And, you're asking me why I am bearish on a stock in a holding company that is supposed to represent the value of NIO, which is a China-based company that Americans cannot legally hold stock in, that is being pumped into oblivion by stocktwits users and is up 2,000% this year? One that opened at -7% and has intraday triple-topped? 

I just am, I guess. Call it a gut feeling.
Spy go up or down by eow ?
 tqqq puts here? TLT puts here? yep yep
Double bottom for NIO over the past week, Run up to earning gonna start soon?
Yes
Can someone please explain to me like I am retarded how VIX is at COVID lows when we are getting ass blasted by COVID and going to lock down in December? With the market at all time highs. Please and thank you.
ERA?
Exactly. Got a couple 15.5 calls for $2 each. Nothing would make me happier than to lose that $400 while all my calls keep printing, but holy fucking payday if shit goes haywire.

That‚Äôs fine my friend, start investing in yourself today too. You will get some dividends eventually. Also what people say is true, best way to get over someone is to get under somebody else. That‚Äôs your new goal. Gym up, diet up, sleep schedule up. Be future you‚Äôs best friend today. 

Also don‚Äôt discount your feelings. Feel bad it‚Äôs okay. Don‚Äôt allow the sadness to swallow you though. Schedule time to get outside and walk or just move. Being inside and staying in your head isn‚Äôt the way out of this dark day you‚Äôre in. Make yourself get out even if it‚Äôs diametrically opposed to everything you are right now. You can‚Äôt think yourself into right living, you need to live yourself into right thinking. Don‚Äôt forget that.

will need a big boi brokerage unfortunately my boi

ZM! god damn!
Nah it's just spacs are falling out of favor. I still think they will probably have a product and sales but the question is will the stock sustain that valuation or will it keep bouncing around $20 as people pump and profit take.
It's not

buy calls? Got it
When I do this, I make 5-10%, then I get out. The stock goes up and I miss out on big gains. I get fomo and get back in for the drop.

ZM??
You can totally order custom peptides from companies, but it is relatively expensive and probably not easy to do on an industrial/synthetic scale.
Totally, Fintwit is FILLED with some of the worst political takes ever.

Charts are dank though.
Cmon Zoom! Oh yeah Screw you boomers.
They have strengths, but have no real shot at US expansion relative to the MSOs. Reply pasted from above: US licenses are so limited that Canadian players don't stand a chance at catching up to US operators. Single states represent the entire Canadian market. That, plus the fact that MSOs are rapidly expanding their footprint via sale-leaseback REIT transactions (mainly IIPR), means their headstart and license/infrastructure advantage is locked in.
Yikes hit me right in the feels

TSLA has gone from under 100 to over 400 mark on 1 year, is that an ETF? don't think so

Just play calls and puts around 420 and you win.
[deleted]
Does Zoom even have a post-pandemic plan?
ZM zoomin
That's the response I needed.
PLTR too high. Either it pulls back today or tomorrow otherwise expect a big drop after earnings
They had a big round of good news. Kind of surprising.
Zoom you beautiful bastard
"Nice Economy you got here, shame if anything were to happen to it..."

Definitely holding my breath whether the fucker will even sign the budget bill, or if the two parties can work together if Mango still refuses to concede... UVXY at these rock bottom prices is at least worth a buy as a hedge.
Baba
Also ZM, check out the motley fool article on ZM joining telehealth industry

Rona is a raging. Be safe
Pfizer is a boomer stock that hardly even moved on the news and is now back to where it was when he put in the sell order in August.
Let the man have his day lol. DkNG went off the cliff the entire month of October.

Why
I got some $108 calls yesterday trying to decide if I should sell
Should of bought zoom in the morni  mg
WTF is going on with ZM
Gotta pay to play my mans. Get your money up.
$PLTR is a tech stock
UVXY calls?
retaird
Positions or ban
[removed]
You guys rich? How much were they
Maybe some insider info on the gm deal
yeet yeet
Zoom going crazyyyy
I would 100%. My point was that there is literally no way for him to play on a level playing field with everyone else because he's literally the CEO of the company so there's no point in complaining about him having more information. What he's doing is IMHO ethical.
Is... is TSLA a.... boomer stock now?????
still amazed in my luck going from $96 to $1500 in 4 days in one of my accounts
Hell yeah
Meh
2:89 pm
Nope
I‚Äôll say it again 4 the peeps that didn‚Äôt hear WMT puts will print tmmrw np
SPY 420C EOY is only $7.   Just saying
When I was about your age I lived in a realm of tendies, but everything changed when our king Donnie was viciously removed from his tweeting station. First we lost volatility, then your grandma's boyfriend left us so we had to make your father for government support.

Ahhh yes the magical face socks

i‚Äôm in 12/24 125c right now, my logic is for the holiday season ramp up which should take place early December and late november this year.
4 calls for 11/27 at 13 that ove been holding for a bit. Looking for tendies
i can not wait till this thing dumps and fucks all of you retards
Gotta do it soon, they might get stimulus for whatever reason
Come on SPY, DO SOMETHING!
Quick buy the boomer stock dip! Yea right, nobody buying that shit, market rotation my ass
NKLA 15% up on the day.  
  
Having NKLA calls or shares feels dirty. While my righteous puts wither away in the distance as the cold winds of fraud and manipulation blow over.
PLTR earnings tmo after close
Absolutely... but I could have used that $10k for the strip club this weekend. Here in the Midwest, you‚Äôd probably leave with a clean butthole after spending that in a night üòÇüòÇüòÇ
in at ~9.8
I follow this guy that makes money selling puts every week. On Monday he told everyone to sell puts on BABA and literally three minutes before that drop sent an email out saying to sell ATM puts on Lyft. Amazing how accurately wrong he is.
Me. Bought calls yesterday before close.
Bro you‚Äôre in denial lol. Can you explain why you‚Äôre bearish, I don‚Äôt get it
dear diary
So did Macys and many others that are only down 3%. Thinking about catching a bounce.
What kinda question is this
All this rally did was find the top.
ZM ripping
PLUG up 12%
Surprised we‚Äôre not pumping PLUG more
Hmmm honestly wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it slowly bleeds back to 29ish range
All the paper hands are gone and all that are left are Tesla permabulls that kept buying the dip.
Not legal in NV. Either is FD or Bet365
Came back in to tell all the NIO bears I told you so. I just keep buying
Me
If that‚Äôs in your risk tolerance yeah they are talking about lockdowns on CNBC right now not a terrible idea
Puts on North Dakota. My agency is trying to get me to go out there for 7700$ to work 60 hours a week.
Anyone holding nio till 3pm ? I need to exit my weeklies today
lockdowns coming back, ptons back
If you‚Äôre up and wanna be safe yea
This guy is going to sell the second it turns green
What‚Äôs about to pop off
As the others, also interested in the play
Fuck off a cliff. We don‚Äôt send our own kind here into shambles. Ban
both those events, everyone wears masks tho.
I‚Äôm 40% NIO 50% boomer bullshit and 10% cash in case something catches my eye.

Same, bro. Got greedy after killing it with options the last few weeks. I think we can at least recover most of our losses on these before close on Friday. Already down 70% so may as well hold on.

I thought I was smart swinging my whole account into every trade but lately I'm putting in like 40 into something I feel good about then averaging down if I missed the bottom (which I always do.) If you're doing shares, take a look at trading premarket and at open/right before close. To me, that's like 80% of my opportunity. During the day I just hope to ride a melt up now and then.

Fair enough, good assessment I suppose. However I see no bigger opportunity to become profitable ahead of schedule than the US legalizing cannabis, the biggest potential consumer base in the world. The likelihood of legalizing has never been higher, and 1/3 of the individual states have voted to legalize cannabis a few days ago, before the new White House even takes post.

The next 4 years will be loosening of cannabis in the states, how investors react to that, who knows, but given how these stocks responded when Canada legalized, I can only imagine a rally will happen as the US moves towards the same.
ER was a week ago
By the way, what % gain do you normally shoot for on your day trades?

botz is shit.  if it didn't have NVIDIA as it's number one holding it would really look like ass.  and NVDA is played out for a while so why would you possibly think BOTZ is going to sky.  It's a good safe ETF that will get you 10-20% gains a year.  I mean it is up what 30-40% for the year in which tech skied.  How is that special.  You could have thrown a dart at meme stocks and done way better.
I feel like the time to trade AAPL is pretty much over. It‚Äôs going to stay around 2T cap for a while. Still a good stock but I just don‚Äôt see what they could possibly do that would make people think it‚Äôs worth much more than it already is.

I'll dump the calls/stonks by EOD.  Rebuy in after earnings.
My observations, spy daily rsi isn't above 75- 80 like sep 2 blow off top, mac d massive momentum above 0 line with growing divergence compared to sep2.  Slow stochastic is above 80 but below 100 so room to grow or stay up here. Algos chase momentum. 351 yesterday back test of the sep2 downtrend line held confirming this breakout so far. I think 358 will provide resistance but it might just be a cool down area. I think if 351 and 348 breaks then big selling imo. There is a volume pocket between 358ish to 354 so that could be a good ride

We need to see more buying pressure and an increase in volume before I‚Äôm comfortable going long. Breaking resistance should push the price between 22-24. Won‚Äôt hold past 26.
whats at 2?

Customer retention post covid is likely to be high considering repeat customers increased in the last quarter, in the long term this will likely hold and in the short term further increase if we go back down under a harder lock down. Hedge funds buy ETSY in their portfolios, they marked their entry way into making masks during the beginning of the pandemic, after that non mask sales grew 93%. This is likely going to grow into a much larger ecommerce site. Many small businesses put their products on etsy now because of the lockdowns.
NVDA and APPL baby
That makes sense. Of course I have paper hands and I don't want to buy in. To think I had money back in 2009 and I didn't even buy in. That fat $6 per share divided on a $20 cost basis would have been great.
We got this

If you make money from other markets and put that money into American stocks you are building America, retards.  Don‚Äôt let anyone take that away from you.
My 8% trailing stop sell triggered maybe I should buy back in
so when we buying more calls?
i find myself coming here less and less each day tbh
Basically shitting your brains out üòå
Yep. I think we'll break through by EOY. This resistance doesn't get tested much and we keep touching it. Buyers obviously want to plow through,  and eventually they will.
So my weekly apple put is just kinda fucked now huh?

Please don‚Äôt include Aphria in with Canopy and Aurora. It‚Äôs happens to be a very well run company. I don‚Äôt disagree that some of the larger well run MSOs are profitable, but once weed is legalized federally the infrastructure they have had to build in every state will weight them down. Anyone can grow weed, so consumer packaging and branding models such as Aphria and even Cresco will thrive in the long run IMO.
No
Wow this thread is so useless now
I know their products have always been great. Doesn't necessarily translate though.

"You have a president who has shown a willingness to be vindictive," said Valliere, pointing to Trump's Monday firing of [Defense Secretary Mark Esper](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/trump-fires-esper/index.html). "Therefore, I worry that the stimulus bill, which we need, will come later than sooner." - [https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/business/trump-biden-transition-stimulus/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/11/business/trump-biden-transition-stimulus/index.html)

Catalysts: Earnings are on the 17th and they will crush them ...

Housing sales have been huge and interest rates are at unreal lows for house loans. People buying their houses are all doing home improvement in down time. 

Home renovation in the last 6 months has been cranking. Contractors have hardly had any downtime during COVID. Housing market booming has caused people to fix houses to sell as well as spend in HD to improve. 

Foreclosure takes a while. Banks that are clearing their books have nothing to do with HD. Unsold homes or a lack of work for renovation / development however does. 

Even if market takes a dip, there‚Äôs a ton of jobs under contract and paid for that won‚Äôt stop - and will go on for months. Last housing crisis took half a year to start to truly unwind. So really if there is concern it will be in Jan-Feb and stimuli will happen by then if it‚Äôs an issue

And that may not affect HD at all - even if those houses sel for less the banks are affected not HD, once the houses are headed to mrkt they will need work and HD will stay busy
That‚Äôs obviously a different situation.
Any day trade plays

But it's potential, meaning 99 would be your optimal ceiling that you can even hope for. You can at most dream of being average. Like if your gene line is restricted to double digit numbers your family is positively retarded. US army doesn't recruit below something like 82-86 IQ.

The IV for feb calls is just under 100, and PLTR has performing much better financially over the last two years. If they have a positive earnings and/or guidance then I think we‚Äôre fine. People have been crushing it on NIO options with the IV at +125
What trades had you made that made you feel like a true degenerate?
Literally all ameripoors sell the second if gets momentum
This has been the story of my puts with this dumbass company! Always soaring when I planned for it to tank. I ditched my 12/18 positions yesterday for modest gain, but I am going to be a dumbass and get in on some 12/11 puts and there will be a mass selloff on the 14th, I can see this already :(
usually i do, or at least 2 weeks. but i closed some contracts i sold yesterday this morning after they got IV crushed and figured i would make another couple bucks while i figure out the next contracts to sell

Anyone else selling their palantir calls here? Just sold half of mine, this is giving me tooo much ptsd from past earnings pump N dumps. I expect the dump tm before earnings and then a continued dump after

FWIW ive been long palantir af since the IPO and bought a call everytime i read a fuck ass analyst saying it was overvalued. They announced earnings for Nov 12 on Oct 29 which is around when this run up started-makes sense since earnings are earlier than i would have expected since theyve been public like 6 weeks so they‚Äôre setting the tone that earnings will be good. Feeling like thats priced in at this point and this is just the pump N dump hedgie game of them buying shares and selling calls to WSB
Spy puts baby 351p 11/13 expiry
How many of us here think there‚Äôs gonna be a dramatic drop coming in the next couple months of because of all this dark winter talk? Is the consensus really we‚Äôre in the clear or is everyone just tryna make some run up money before the drop? News outlets keep peddling that this time is going to be worse than before, so I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it entirely.
The CEO sold 62% of his shares
Synthesizing proteins more than a few dozen amino acids chemically is prohibitively expensive on a large scale. There are in vitro translation systems but scaling those reactions up to anything commercially viable is not really possible.

Much much easier to just insert the gene encoding said protein to a host (E. coli, yeast, insect cells etc) and purify the protein from them. Or better yet just inject the mRNA encoding the proteins into people so their own cells will make the protein.

Also -80 really isn't a big deal logistically for urban/suburban areas in a developed country. Every hospital and research lab in the country has -80¬∫ freezers all over the place. The infrastructure for sending and shipping stuff that needs to be very cold already exists because every hospital and university lab does it daily

That's not pfizer's issue or problem. They developed the vaccine. That's it. You literally have to store at -70 because sometimes you won't even be fully frozen at -20 or -40 depending on the solution. It's up to the government to figure out distribution.
???????
Pfizer didn't directly control when they released results. They had to wait until enough people got Covid to compare which group got it more often.

He actually almost fucked himself because they were originally going to release results when 32 total people got infected, but they decided to wait until 62 (and then by the time they decided on that change 94 had gotten it).
Yes... he made the news public the day his shares were due to sell to maximize profit

Find retarded IV stocks. Ideally WSB memes. Sell wide ass condors expiring the Friday of earnings weeks. Close out the morning after earnings.

Gotta say though, this pandemic will really reshape what we think of as work. Zoom has so much potential if it can somehow branch out from where it is now and focus on its fundamentals. Online telecommunicating is such a huge field, especially when you mix webcams with it.  Whether it is truly a value stock i dunno. And whether it will grow anymore, that's also hard to call. Depends on their investors, management, and company culture, which I don't see as making the cut?

Another reason is that when sp500 rises 10% in 6 days 95% of the time it's a bullish signal for the next year averaging 22% upside. The data set is 25 times this has happened. The worst year it this happened it dropped 25% best year it rose 53%. Goldman sachs also predicting 4600 sp500 by 2021. Backtest at 3510 still holds and bounced higher today if that breaks then more selling imo but so far action is bullish. Daily rsi isn't even 70, sep 2 had 75 80 rsi blow off top. macd is bullish momo above 0 line, slow stochastic rsi high but not over bot all telling algos to chase momo.

My super power is buying calls at the top, and puts at the bottom
Smart, took me a while to figure out that buying options, especially shorter dated ones, is statistically a bad idea. I think a lot of people here trade options simply because they don't have the capital to trade shares. Which is kinda funny because for most options traders, trading options ends up taking them further away from having enough to trade shares and making decent profits.

Teach him options obviously. He wants to learn.
I don't quite trust those top 3 richest people in the world's hearts. Think about it, their wealth is built off of something quite intangible (internet and computer processing systems mostly.) I kind of trust Musk (cars and sustainable energy is awesome and tangibly useful.) Arnault is a fashion guy so that is... normal I guess to have at least one of the richest people be in that field.

Person who's wealth I trust the most is Buffett's. His investment portfolio is beautiful, a lot of infrastructure that will always pay out in the long run and honestly is less riskier than others. Something you can trust, taste, and feel. If you track some of his investments, he is literally invested into the well-being of America. I honestly think his wealth is way more valuable than everybody else on the charts, but it isn't so obvious because they go off of present-day market valuations as opposed to different ones, like valuation using discounted cash flows.

150-300 by EOY 2021. Buy now & move out of your wife‚Äôs boyfriends house next Christmas
Pretty sure we are still decades, if not centuries away from being able to print proteins.
I think it‚Äôs a gamble just like everything else. Buying poots isn‚Äôt a bad idea. The last earnings I played were lulu, LOGI, and Pinterest. I trimmed off some of my position and took a little profit early. It saved my ass on lulu an logi. I hope you consider doing the same if you have a run up pre earnings.
Omg guys just go buy weed instead of CGC

It‚Äôs okay sweet baby NIO, you go to 46 EOD when you feel like it

So Logan Paul made Pokemon cards go up like 300%, what stock should we get him to hype up?
Thoughts on AMD puts?
RKT raped half this sub at the beginning of Sept and people still think any day now is the breakout. They make a lot of money and everyone already knows that ‚Äî there is no ace up the sleeve that is going to suddenly make them worth 2X as much as they already are. It‚Äôs not like they offer unencrypted video chat services or something.
Not feeling confident about any plays right now, sit on cash for a bit

theta is dicking me so hard right now üò©üçÜ

Yeah it should be through the roof with all these robinhooders off work, oh wait forgot they don‚Äôt have jobs
Too many people with 11/13s

Do they have patents?  Do they have a significant market share/brand?  Do they have relationships with the FDA? Did each of those questions make you think of pharma instead of these shitty penny stocks that have lost money for years?  Yah weed stocks are dead‚Äîbet on big pharma if you want to bet on weed.

I like it!  Stocks or options? Leaps? What are we thinking
One of the only useful bits of advice you see posted on this sub is "follow the trend, retard". Speaking as an SPY watcher, it was dumb to buy puts this summer, then it was dumb to buy calls September and October. The start of November has me thinking it's dumb to buy puts again.
So why would Fiverr rally because of that? Wouldn‚Äôt every other outsourcing platform be doing the same?
How do you make friends with congress men/women. I‚Äôd love to get in on these insider trades

Surprised nobody is talking about MMEDF (Mind Med), a Canadian psychedelics startup that is up almost 100% this year and has applied for Nasdaq listing.

Pretty well. A bit miffed I was at 5k and now sitting at 3.5k due to the drop from 45, but if we head back I'll be at like 5.5k since I did some repositioning on the drop.

I'm hoping earnings kills it and we see a nice 15-25% gain. That would put me near 10k.

Lolz. But atleast he finally exited with some profit.
My main point was that there's no way in hell *100% of the world population* is taking this vaccine. A lot of people do have concerns, and will not get vaccinated regardless of whether or not their concerns are valid or not. I think best case scenario you're getting maybe 50-60% of the US and Europe taking this vaccine and 20-30% of less-developed nations taking it. The others are going to either get natural immunity or never come into contact with the virus and be protected through herd immunity.

I'm not a fan of the government adding all these regulations though. Better to let people take their own risks and die through natural selection than to forcefully economically harm everyone in the pursuit of preserving life. I don't think that's our government's job.
Stop issuing challenges....
More of a gamble for me
Two Octobers ago I bought a bunch silver for $14 an oz. I bought it at spot price with those introductory offers from each company, using my family members as mules (different addresses required) to get as many as possible. I'm close to doubling my money, and if it gets to that point I'm selling. Silver and SPY had made me the most money over the years. Are you asleep yet?
so are weed stocks done for good?
I just accidentally clicked on the weird ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button instead of ‚ÄúTrade Options‚Äù. Whew that was scary. Felt like a kid who lost his mom in a Walmart

I'm very leery of anything that stacks the deck against me any more than my own ineptitude already does. I trade with like 80k just doing shares trading trends and what have you. I was just trading VTI for very small gains until I started hanging out in here and got a little loosened up. Not rich, just old to the point where it would be unreasonable for me to not have X amount of money, having worked all these years.
How did you lose on AMD, did you buy @ 90?
None, I‚Äôm not trading a meme stock, I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs a bearish engulfing candle if I have ever seen one.
No matter how retarded we are, we will never be as retarded as the people who comment on webull

Im thinking of getting 420 calls 11/20

AMT earnings tomorrow, anyone have thoughts on this?
Clearly they can't compete with NKLA
HA yeah you are right.
I'm trying a different strategy, gonna see what long term options perform, AAL 1/21/22 55c, yeah its only 300 i put in, but I did just blow up my account, so you know yolo what I can
At least for it to be on pace with NVIDIA
Ima tell you how to profit ezpz. Buy dips in ldos, de and pton and buys puts when they‚Äôre green
Anyone betting against the mouse today?

I bought a NIO leap this summer for 1/15 and paid $169 and it's now worth $3300+.

Anyway, I need a trade today that will net me similar gains. What's the play today boys and girls?
[deleted]
Gonna sell before earnings then buy in after

Hell yea
People realizing that the millions of people who were laid off are not going to be re-entering the mainstream workforce for quite some time.
Ok good to know
Just went over my accounts.  Ignoring the $17k in unrealized gains I gave back, I‚Äôm down $4k on options and futures, and up $600 on shypto.  

Oh and I lost $25k of my IRA on options.  

Starting to think leveraged shypto is for me.  But I feel gae not trading futures and options.
When?! Fuck
RKT cue up the stock buybacks! FUCKKK!!!
Seriously ... MODS!
remindme! 20 days
Every time tsla hits 450 it immediately sinks down. Guess I'll set a sell order for my 50 shares at 447 or something

Not necessarily, just that he definitely waited for the last week or few to announce before his scheduled sale.
Guess what, shiet is flat, was thinking to do that!
January 2022 145c LEAPS here. Slow roast tendies

Trade penny stocks
What should I use my day trade on
That‚Äôs what I thought a month ago
Yes
Gettin chopped
My brain is saying to load up on puts soon but my dick is saying buy calls.
2 shares of NIO go!
üòè That was my plan with my 12-04-20 155c, but a part of me wonders if it'll stay after earnings
Why are you a frog
lol, true

i think they do it every time it hits 15
Hyln and VLrd fuked me in September, and last one was because i was greedy with UVXY calls and didnt cash out before election!
They found someone in the terminal yelling about SouthWest was going to blow up after they made some "calls"

LUV 1/21c
Day trade calls
Slow bleed up and slow bleed down

Not true. I bought Pton calls.
Bought 2000 shares at 10.00. Sold half at 15.10.

Letting the other half ride long term. Will be selling CCs against is most likely
...so RKT is just going to trade between 20 and 21 forever huh
Easy money
Volume today has been pretty high compared to normal and with earnings tomorrow I feel like this shit opens at 260 at least tomorrow
What are you expecting? +10% day out of nowhere?
what was the lot size?
Even Europoors are rallying. I might just hit six figures this week.
Ddog calls? üßê

It's looking like we have to wait for the suits to come back to work tomorrow to see some real action.
It‚Äôs so retarded... so yeah I‚Äôll pick some up.
Exactly what I have lol
For your sake. I hope you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm just reading the chart in front of me and it‚Äôs turning into a strong sell.
‚Äòmember when BABA was trading around 300$, 2 days ago? 

Oh, I ‚Äòmember!

Baba 268.50 - my options 3.10 - 20 mins later baba 270.80 my options 2.70 .......
Normally I hate myself for buying short dated calls, but why the fuck did I buy all my SQ calls for 12/4? I missed out on so much more tendies
This can‚Äôt be real
there's something not sure if you ever heard of it, called google
Wrong Sub, idiot ... Ban this garbage

Diamond handed my qqq calls. Rotation talk smelled like bs.
The secret is to sell before earnings

It dropped a bunch after vaccine news, now going back up because that was an overreaction, today is 11.11 shopee day and earnings are next week
Anyone else picking up NIO $45 straddles before ER next week? Or is that too retarded?

Doesn‚Äôt the all digital versions change the dynamics?

That GME short squeeze is really picking up steam ü§°
I'm in a similar boat, over a longer period of time.

Honestly, I'm 100% fine with it. Way better than having started without luck and losing a bunch of money before getting the swing of things.

I feel like your first time really dipping back to original principal is when the game truly starts. It was a tutorial before that.
no, the market isnt really hinging on the election as this sub may have you think

I‚Äôm thinking of making sub for all intellectuals who own BABA calls. Opinions?

its like someone convinces WSB to hyper focus on like 5 tickers and it rotates every year. i remember in 

2017 it was MU

2018 it was TSLA/TLRY/AMD

2019 it was PRPL

This has got to be the biggest pump/dump. Shills out here pumping or selling options and yall just eating that up.
Which it‚Äôs why it‚Äôs going back down
This was the exact play I wanted to do, but didn't have the balls for. 355's were fine for me. I think you'll be just fine if you hold into next week. Lockdowns+lockdown news will be coming. Staying this close to ATH's is insane, we're golden.

Appreciate the warning but the only thing a üêª will be engulfing are deez nuts when my wsb bros and I vacation in the Maldives with our calls
How much have recounts shifted vote counts in modern history? Several hundred votes, sometimes up to a thousand.
I got lucky a few times, when they released 3000 series GPU their I swung $20k in FD's overnight and they jumped 8% by open thanks to price target upgrades. Solid profit off that play. At one point I was down -50% too

Also made $5k in them last week so I decided not to push it and buy yesterday or this morning. Waiting to get a clear direction

Sorry but your positions dont matter, me losing money is higher priority
Nio cucks will be the Next fastly Desaster
Yep - If you were holding a shit company like UAL that went from 80 to nothing - you would be happy to get half your capital back when it popped to almost 40.  Knowing that volume won‚Äôt return for a while and they are a horrible company - way better places to put money back to work.
Sorry
Nah fuck Trump
Damn, I hope you're making bank today.
Please give me a STERN no. I really need it. My shitcoin (5% of my holdings) is mooning and I'm feeling the fomo
Dude just relax
BABA calls go up wtf
Stop selling your NIO stonk!!!!
Uber Eats forgot my fucking fries
Yeah, I had read that about TWO so I bought some March calls a few weeks ago. They were near worthless from when I originally bought them and they're starting to recover a bit. If I had bought a lower strike I'd probably be up a decent amount. Gonna see how the rest of my day goes before I decide to buy up any more. Got greedy playing weekly options.

You might be right though, COVID isn't going away so it might be some time before there's a full recovery. I can see $9 within the year but only shortly unless there's some ridiculous stimulus package passed once Biden is in.
Found the retard, everyone
Cool, sorry if I was defensive. You wouldn't believe the reaction I got the other day in (IIRC) /r/news when I was working through some similar math concerning the death rate not actually being 5% or whatever they were saying.

Fuck GME
Go e-commerce
palantir is a once in a lifetime investment opportunity

the company was private for almost 20 years and engineers have been getting compensated with lots of stock options

watch some of Alex Karp's interviews, you can tell he is a good man with a strong moral fiber, and incredibly smart -- probably even a genius

not a chance in hell he would take a company public and not have something up his sleeve to wow investors during the first ER -- much of what his company does is kept quiet: I am betting they are profitable now

they treat engineers like GOLD and I seriously doubt he is going to risk their stock options by taking the company public and then blowing the ER

don't fucking miss it

also before you tell me they don't respect your privacy make sure you read EO12333 and understand it: google and facebook don't, palantir does... unless you're bin laden

Damn now I feel better about my loss
Nio instead of NKLA now
inversely, i bought puts, soooooo
In this case, I guess in august, the CEO announced that he would liquidate a large part of the stock if the stock hit a certain price point, that info was published and the vaccine news bumped it past that point and was exercised.  nothing really shady.

Baba going up and my calls arnt moving with it
I stay fairly focused with stocks that I trade often. It is easier to know the moves/price levels

99% of what I am trading is tech, 1% PRPL
Yeah the launch is scheduled for literally this month. November is the best test flight window for wherever the fuck they are launching from. (drawing on memory of reading some article about it)
My calls can‚Äôt wait to see BABA over $300 again

Hey if it expires itm you still made profit, just capped out. What premium did you get for that though?
Last 2 days were brutal for weeklies and earnings are on Tuesday. NIO is super volatile right now but I think it moons tomorrow or Friday before close. I can see $50 going into ER and then see it dropping back to low $40s unless it goes amazingly well. At that price people will start buying back in ahead of NIO Day in January.
Same for you! Lets get it
Tech dips are basically terrorism. Where‚Äôs the pentagon budget for fighting tech dips

* This is a B2B company, with initial focus on larger enterprises. The adaption of its software and hence revenue will be a lumpy process.
* The product once accepted by the customer tends to be very sticky.
* Palantir identifies its total addressable market (TAM) size today to be \~$119B ($56B in the commercial sector and $63B in the government sector). Future value of the company is really driven by its potential market share and how long will it take the company to get there.
* Palantir had never used a direct sales team to acquire customers, but it changed that stance late 2018. This change can be a catalyst for future growth. Growth in H1 2020 of 49% over same period last year likely provides some evidence of this approach.
* Most of its revenue today is concentrated in its top 25 customers.
* Company has a multi-class structure, designed to keep the control of the company with the founders via Class F shares. Media coverage on this topic has caused additional aversion to the stock.
* Palantir did a direct listing in September 2020 vs. a traditional IPO, which meant no roadshow, no raising of additional proceeds and hence no incentive for Wall Street firms to promote the company to the public.
* Election overhang. Peter Thiel is a well-known Trump supporter. However, CEO Alex Karp is not. The political opinions and viewpoints also cloud the objective assessment of the company for most investors.

Yeah sure, he said whenever they started the company was that their fundamental belief was "the west should be the strongest in software and data analytics to maintain our competitive advantage on the rest of the world." 

Just because their mission statement is true, it doesn't go against a company with close to zero competition and a TAM (Total Available Market) of 119b

Alright, I'll give you that.  I'll delete it but you're still pointing out that I have a lot of money.
By this time in 2016, after a much closer win than Biden‚Äôs, trump was already receiving classified briefings and had already been invited to and visited Obama in the White House, and was fully engaged with Obama‚Äôs transition team.

Trump has yet to speak to biden.  Stop pretending like he‚Äôs not actually fucking with the entire process already.
so RKT will never go up right? fuck this

They've never turned a profit. And there's basically no barrier to entry.

Peep ACB weekly chart.
I think that‚Äôs aggressive (personally). I say that, but the prices have gone up since when I went in @$6 3/19/21 about 2-3 months ago. I think you‚Äôll get some decent profit between now and Jan/Feb, but I‚Äôd get out at that target whenever a rally occurs. I‚Äôm also not a big ‚Äúshare‚Äù guy, but I have 17% of my portfolio currently in TWO. It‚Äôs the only REIT I own outside of SPG.  

If you look into their financials, they are looking to hedge any of their mortgages that go into forbearance with funds they‚Äôve set aside. I think they‚Äôre in a good position to weather the storm if it gets even rockier. Over the past 18-24 months, their percentage of mortgages estimated to be near, or at forbearance has gone down considerably. Most REITs don‚Äôt have the reserve funds necessary to balance a potential increase, or inverse of what you‚Äôve seen with TWO. Slightly different, but IVR is a dumpster fire. If the market recovers, those funds will be used for other things that will benefit you sometime in 2021/2022.
look at 1 year chart. it is a covid company.
How big do you size your lottos? $100? $500? $1,000? Bigger?
When WSB says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy tomorrow if it dips more‚Äù, that means the dip is in already

exactly lol.. when is the last time p/e was a factor?
Idk man, sure, maybe there's some long lasting damage in a lot of people. But considering not even 0.1% of people who contract COVID actually die from it, I would have to imagine the people who get long-term lung damage from it are less than 5-10% of cases. Early on we had no fuckin idea how to deal with the virus, and we were using the shit out of ventilators, which cause lung damage. Nowadays we have therapeutics that can help you beat it quickly. Look at fuckin Donny Pump up there in the white house. By any normal metrics, he's one of the most unhealthy people in the country, yet he kicked it in less than a week. How can you see that and say the *majority* of people in this country are going to suffer permanent damage?

If it was like herpes, and went dormant and flared up... The vaccine would do the same fucking thing. Notice we don't have a herpes vaccine, because injecting a virus into you that doesn't actually get destroyed by your body would give you it permanently instead of immunity?

yea maybe but jack really fked up in front of the china board for the ant ipo i think he pissed them off big time
Smart. Inverse the market. Buy when they sell.
I have a terrible track record.  
The only solace I can give you, is that I've never done a play this small and probably never will again.

For that reason, this may print.
Definitely more than one way to successfully trade. Lots of people look at volume, I don't. Certainly luck is part of it but as you mentioned earlier, market makers take advantage of traders' emotions and use it to profit off them. It's more about knowing what to look for to increase your odds of having a profitable trade though than luck.

Speaking of BABA, I bought a call option on it just yesterday, one of the few options trades I've made. Woke up this morning and happened to see it right at resistance and saw how far it fell premarket so I sold for a small profit. It dropped right after I sold. 

It should get back above $300 eventually so I might re-enter. It's oversold on the daily so it's a relatively safe spot to buy. Doesn't mean it can't drop more but compared to all last month when it was overbought, obviously a much better buy now.

/YM ripped right to 30000! I couldn't believe it. /RTY ripped a wormhole to a new dimension. /NQ was strange. Algorithms wanted to rip it, but humans probably stepped in to short it and metals given the huge shift in /ZB and the yield curve in general.

A lot of wsb would be better served by futures than options since, even when they are directionally correct, they tend to miss the timing and tend to concentrate risk in exactly one contract instead of across the chain and across underlyings.

The market can't even look forward to the afternoon, forget after lockdowns.

Bounced off 261 but expect ma to bend and baba to be back on track
It bottomed out pretty obviously over the last couple weeks. Could be a mix algos and people (like me) buying leaps and hoping for an eventual pop from GM that sends it up 40% in a day

Apple has been giving me the ol' sandpaper dildo for weeks now.
Market gave me my money back today
Lol no, 353.94 is next DP support to watch
As soon as I can exit my NIO weeklies I'm gonna load up on shares and just not look at Robinhood for a while. Made a killing on options for a bit and then got greedy. This shit is so stressful.
What are you shorting?
Can AAPL and AMD jump another 10% between now and June please?

I'm sorry man. The good news is that you'll probably lose less on the divorce.

For those doing this NIO thing, how many shares did you buy?
I ran out of cash so I started shorting things. Its free money!!
so my 12/11 350P are fucked?
Haha i bought mine before the last time they got IV crushed. What‚Äôs a second time? I also have 100 shares. This is a longer term play for me.
NIO $45c‚Äôs worth holding?
Yea I was tempted to take whatever profit I have now (not a lot) but I think I might wait
11/13 Spy $360c. Can pick up 5 of them for $500.

NIO dudes may wanna run, my friend notorious for buying the top, like Apple post split and Tesla top just took 10k out of his savings and bought NIO. I took some profit on some shares I bought awhile ago. This is a Donnie tweet about how well the stock market is doing.

Though tbf NIO has a ton of room to run long term, but I think he a bunch of shares and calls 3 weeks out. I hope it works for him bc hes down like 30k
Can someone legitimately explain to me why people think gap fills are necessary. I see shitty YouTube technical analysts citing the need for a gap fill as the reason a stock isn't going to move higher. It just seems like the most crystal ball, voodoo TA bullshit. Is there an actual underlying reason why gap fills are necessary, something based on the fundamentals of a stock, or is it just speculation about the psychology of people speculating on a stock?
NIO just breaks the resistance. Let see it goes to the moon!!!

There's a massive amount of shares on lock-up.  I think that's what has people concerned.
Aight bruh fuck off, I admit it I didn't even look up the percentage, I just made it up, get off my ass you cunt

It's still not 100% so I think my point has some validity to it anyway. 30-50% would be enough to at least end these stupid lockdowns

Well it did go down to that point in pre market and I actually bought at 259ish (I‚Äôm in Europe).
[deleted]
You're right, my bad:

The [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](https://www.cftc.gov/) reveals to the public the number of contracts bought or sold by "speculators" (defined as traders who do not use the future for protection purposes)

The 2nd chart at the bottom shows that number for the future on 5 year treasuries: very low = everybody is short, very high = everybody is long

Theory and practice seem to suggest that `"when everybody is short, don't be short"` unless you want to be in a short squeeze which is what could arguably happen here

*edit: unclear explanation*
I don't know what Rocket has to do to go up in price. I think that fake article saying they missed earnings really fucked it too

I‚Äôm starting to wonder if someone switched the market back to easy mode.
I can certainly relate to this post.  
I have meetings with VP level management (I work in tech) and I was day trading in the middle of a meeting.

Someone out of the blue asked me what my thoughts were. I had no idea what the heck they were talking about and I made a fool out of myself.

I have also decided that day trading is a higher priority because I know I can always make up the work in my day job someway somehow.   
Heck, it is almost like I want to get freed so I can day trade 100% full time; but deep down I know that is not a wise thing to do.

Trust me once a play works out 9/10 it will not continue no matter how sure you are. 60-100% is a typical max cutoff gain before you are taking a 80% loss chance on your bets.

Does anyone not even see the money they trade with as real money? I see the number but when I gain or lose for some reason I feel nothing but on the other hand if I gained or lost that same amount in my bank account I would definitely feel it
I should have known the poor stoners would have paper hands and sell that shit. Puts was such and easy play.

How are you doing on that call?
You‚Äôre insane . I want to blow you

Options trading allows for much higher gains (and much higher losses) than stock buying/selling.

Oh my god. You do understand marginal?!?!?!??!

Teachers spending their own money is out of necessity. Taxing the rich more is a necessity. Why can't both class accept that?

We probably hit 43 before ER
Just did the same. Super easy and everything is laid out super simple with the app. Plus you know these guys are getting PAID when they are raping you out of 5k for closing costs.
I mean it's all fun and games to say "bUy dEcEmBer cALLs" but if you have any serious money (50-200k) (unlike those people) going long is never a bad thing. This stock is an easily $300 bagger in a few years. Make that down-payment on your house or buy a condo, dividend stocks or just keep investing again

Hahahha i work in a lab. Theres a whole hall full of -80. I just see dollar signs.
PLTR might be an exception
I have lost money on RKT 2 times now but they are fucking printing cash. Beatings estimates everytime and they just announced a 1 billion buyback.

I am gonna buy leaps on this piece of shit stock and if it doesnt work I am gonna kill myself.
it would be pretty fun to watch the aftermath.
I wonder what happened to the dude I talked to on here last week who bought something like $15k in VXX shares and said he planned to hold for a while.

I'm down to my last 150[including bank account]. Threw it all in spy 365c 11/13 to finally end this game. If spy hits 360, its confirmed that this game is rigged to pull you back in at the last minute

Not true. They have $8 eighths at Earl‚Äôs.
There is probably at least 1 deep freezer, they‚Äôre relatively common for biology/medicine. Antibodies are pretty commonly used for instance and should be frozen at -80c. Even my undergrad‚Äôs public state school had one on half of the floors in both biology and chemistry. I can‚Äôt see that much demand from this, as most places probably have it near by. For portability purposes, a liquid nitrogen container can be used to do something like transport over relatively short distances and to maintain temperature while doing the experiment. Sometimes they can get full of different peoples experiment but  I mean those things are still pretty big already.

Dumped 250 xpeng shares get ready for it to absolutely rocket on earnings
I have 43c expiring next week. I want it to hit that fucking price and I‚Äôm out before earnings
Been holding since a couple days ago.  Bought at the top ~14.20 and kept going up.  Return is like +20% right now. Got a bunch of shares too so maybe make my exit on the calls, hold shares through, re-enter after earnings?
Just sold all of my DIS out of tax sheltered accounts. Virus cases making things re-spooky.
When is it? Couldn‚Äôt hurt to throw the lottos out there.
Yea gonna need some more of those concerted BABA-NIO Runups
Thanks mate, made my day a little better after losing out alot.

Thanks for your advice. I'm looking at the volume too. Sometimes I am just worried about the sudden extreme ditections or even something like Trump tweet which I'm certain the big players all cahoot to cause a major panic. 

Perhaps a mixture of bonds and etf would be better. This thing is not for me since I know I'm unlucky, I'm against the casino, and its affecting my work concentration and mental health too. I'll probably put into something like BABA or Google that I know are too big to fail (unless they pull an Enron lol) 

Appreciate you listening. Have a great day mate :)

Just refinanced with RKT , this puppy is going up... definitely a better experience.
Flaccid donkey
yeah was thinking like an etf like usmv or xlp but doesn‚Äôt really help in march-style correction when everything‚Äôs down and you need cash most
It‚Äôs been a fun couple days ‚Äúconsolidating‚Äù NIO. I‚Äôve enjoyed my time in the low 40s and am now ready for 50s. Ty.
A high leverage ratio is 3.5x. The interest payments of the debt will make it really hard for them to generate fcf

They will have downward pressure due to the internal Chinese tensions but IMO they should hold $270...

Confidence is high, I am riding my 260 put to expiry unless it really craters. Then I will buy back at a loss, sell another put to try and make up for any loss but I was in profit almost immediately after open
Same. My success deluded me into thinking I know what‚Äôs going on and that my next move must be solid

EV is not going anywhere. It's the future and it's coming faster than anyone expected. Now that China has gotten on board it's (EVs) gonna pump. $BYDDY manufactures and sells the batteries and the solar panels needed for this tech and infrastructure. As long as they play nice (pay the bribes) the CCP will let them continue to thrive. If they get too big for themselves ($BABA) they will suffer the consequences. AKA your stock will shit the bed. This stock will continue to rise right along side $NIO and any other Chinese EV/Solar company. I'm gonna hold these a bit longer now, but originally this was supposed to be a quick in and out for another position. Plans change, maybe this keeps me in longer for a better return?

anyone buying TQQQ/SQQQ options is really dumb unless you ACTUALLY have the underlying shares

stop getting killed by liquidity you idiots

also, if you're buying enough QQQ options, you should probably be buying NDX options. tax advantaged, cash settled, crappier liquidity though.

There's also NQX. even crappier liquidity. But they can be fun on friday, just pick some up 10 mins before close and let it ride. more fun than playing the lotto
They announced a huge share offering, diluting their shares quite a bit. A lot of negative sentiment. Plus they are a Canadian company that won't benefit to the same level from Biden as US competitors. Be wise.

Or be retarded, then you can show us loss porn.
Yeah now it‚Äôs oversold. Should see some momentum soon. Who knows when but we should. Went straight down. Needs to correct after last quarter brah.

Dude.  A trading computer is just something that supports a multiple monitor setup, has a non-grandpas computer amount of ram, a CPU that benchmarks betters than a stale piece of toast, and probably an SSD over an HDD.  

In other words, any modernish computer and as many monitors as you can look at without getting sick.  

If you‚Äôre a day trader and you can actually benefit from a setup like this, I assume the cost of the rig isn‚Äôt an issue because of the 25k (or mountains of cash) you already have sitting around.  

If you‚Äôre worried about the cost, you‚Äôre not rich enough to need to afford one.

Plot twist - Ackman is right this time and everyone gets fucked on a downturn including him
They don't stand to make a ton on the vaccine
Absolutely he will.
underrated strategy, imo
This is my kind of meme lol
Don't understand why people buy calls on stock that are up immensely, makes no sense unless you're day trading. You need to let the stocks calm down before you enter.
Anyways, since you bought a call that's almost 100% OTM, its gonna be really hard for you to make your money back because its gonna be a constant battle with theta. I do foresee $TLRY going back up by the end of the year but it may not move enough to counter the theta decay. So honestly, idk what to recommend. You're fucked
They‚Äôll still be around, claiming he runs in 2024

Good riddance ‚úåüèº
So here‚Äôs the thing with it. Demand really isn‚Äôt there and supply is high. However the US is drawing on more oil and gasoline than anticipated. Also if you believe this vaccine is a winner demand may come back. However oil is definitely overvalued with Libya producing and the major economies being flushed with it there‚Äôs no reason for it to be up over 40. However every single bank is leveraged to their eyeballs with oil. If oil slips they could start collapsing in weeks. So traders will never allow oil to get too low despite its true value. That‚Äôs just how it is for all commodities what Wall Street says it‚Äôs worth is bullshit. When oil was negative no one was giving away gas matter a fact prices at the pump where I am didn‚Äôt even come down during the entirety of that bear market. The Wall Street banks will not let it fall so I would really really avoid fighting them on it.
It‚Äôs just a number man +2k, -7k doesn‚Äôt matter at the end of the day It‚Äôs all artificial shit
Don‚Äôt
Ok, here is the idea... who produces those ultra cooling -70C fridges and can I buy positions on them?

Anyone know a ticket?
I follow oil pretty closely and I generally agree with your sentiment, but the biggest wildcard, and the thing keeping me from making that play, is the chance that Trump might bomb Iran and/or North Korea before he leaves office to really fuck things up for Biden.

If you don't think that's a possibility then being bearish on oil, especially at these prices, seems like a pretty fair bet to me.
Idk they‚Äôve tied themselves to Microsoft‚Äôs revenue and I think Microsoft will be around for a while

Hey, are you me? I‚Äôve been bagging shares in this shitbag stock for months and finally decided to buy options in it last week!
What these NIO haters are missing is that there's tons of price action over the past week in the $40.50-41 range.
Because coming up with your own plays is too much for you
What was it at the peak?
[deleted]
All the WSB NIO hate is making me feel optimistic again
I think every trader experiences what you're experiencing. Aside from a few trades here and there, I don't really trade options either, at least not anymore. I mainly scalp futures now. Just going for those small gains. Not as exciting as options but those small gains add up.

Been thinking of trading shares lately just so I have more stuff to look at rather than just 2 tickers, I trade SP500 and gold futures.

If you're trading short term and it doesn't involve news related events like earnings and announcements, looking at charts is the way to go in my opinion. I know a lot of people here believe TA is BS but it's not, well, most of it actually is BS but some are solid.

You could greatly improve your odds by just looking to see if a price is over sold/bought on the daily and basically avoid short positions if it's oversold. It's certainly not 100%, no TA is, price can just keep going down or up even if it's way over sold/bought but it puts the odds in your favor. 

I wouldn't enter a position because of it but I would avoid entering due to it. Like if it's oversold, don't blindly buy calls because of it but best to avoid buying puts.

Just something to consider.
VIX luvs gettin its cubes crushed
GM deal still on the table. IMO if GM was gonna bail, they would've done so immediately to get away from the bad PR. The fact they're still talking tells me they want in badly and will be officially in soon.

Dow starting to drop again
Idk man. Oil is still extremely low from a historical perspective. Plus I think production numbers came in lower than expected last week. With Biden coming in, any fracking restrictions would just bring oil price up imo
People are not going to stop using Zoom by now. Maybe a vaccine gets rolled out halfway through next year (I think I heard Q3). Even so, many companies will continue to meet virtually through most of next year. I work in production and we use zoom everyday for very large productions.

Pfizer only up 2.85% since vaccine announcement?
Mind explaining your DD?
I'm at like +220%  with a 4k position in this and I'm thinking about buying more but it's just so expensive compared to when I bought it.
Fundamentally compared to tesla and nio it's much more boring since it basically has the wide market as customers and not luxury and valuation on paper is still low. 
I'm just afraid that ev hype will die down like it did 3 years ago.

What's your opinion?
Knew this would pop, opened a position. It proceeded to fall, just touch my stop loss at 125, and moon straight after. This game is rigged.

NIO MOON MISSION COMING GET ON
Demand should go up short term once vaccine is out. More people leaving cities means more demand until electric cars become more popular. Long term not looking good with net zero climate goals globally. Short term should see an increase.
[deleted]
I think your correct on the first statement. 

Second statement it's just far more likely that the coming vaccines from astrazeneca and JNJ don't have the arduous storage requirements and will be much more popular because the logistics are so much easier. The euphoria around pfizera vaccine really can only go down from here as competitors products come on line.

Unless they all flop of course, but that seems unlikely.
DDOG calls for 12/18 looking juicy so I had to jump in
need to be able to get at least a full hand scoop worth
You're an idiot. It's 100% not RH fault. That's on you.
Its aight. Pays the bill and the options
That‚Äôs more money then most people here have made
I‚Äôm not an oil guy but I think the idea is that it won‚Äôt go up. Selling otm credit spreads or something might be the play. Not puts, because it doesn‚Äôt have a ton of room to go lower.
Source?
And then there's me who just bought a bunch of shares.
Nice bro, I was in at IPO for $9. After trading sideways for a few months I grew impatient and jumped out. This is definitely a long-term hold though. TAN, LIT, PSTH, PLTR and maybe RKT for my long term holds.
Ba dipping below 184 will touch 187-190 by EOD again. Ez scalp
The big question is. Will they make money? Everything coming in for COVID is being sold under market price as it should be (humanitarian side). Business side doesn‚Äôt like that.

Vix at 3 month lows on no good news and trump attempting coup

Hard to imagine what makes this market go down at this point
I‚Äôm so happy apples lawsuit against the makers of fort nite was thrown out. I never even played that game and I still think it‚Äôs bullshit they want to bully everyone into giving up 50% of their revenue.

Because they're trying to squeeze, so they don't want the shorts to have a hard time borrowing.

Listen people, you're killing Grandma. Do you really want to kill Grandma?

Even corn loving cousin fucker farmers know 50% isnt herd immunity. They raise cattle and know you need close to 90% for anything resembling herd immunity.

Wix,shop,and square all had reversals after ascending triangle.  And Etsy has been about 30 mins behind them in pattern.  will get back in at 126.
But what if XPEV impresses tomorrow morning?
Following some research here's what I've found regarding the potential COVID vaccine. Whoever the fuck manages to make one that works (front runners include PFE, AZN MRNA; will need to produce and distribute said vaccine. So that leaves us with the question of who's gonna make the vials and syringes?   
Well from what I can find is that GLW, BDX and CAH are the companies to look out for regarding vials and syringes. The worlds gonna need billions of these things, and these are the industry leaders capable of and have already started stockpiling supplies for this surge in demand. 

Any thoughts and input?
Will it affect NIOü§îüÜò
will $GOLD recover?

My naked BYND weekly calls I sold yesterday are up. That's how high the IV was. Stock is up 6 dollars from the point I sold those calls too.
Hmmm. I can see it getting upgrades in the next week or two. But MMs like to keep RKT down to let options expire too. If it were December I'd feel a bit safer. Depends on your strike I guess

stop waiting around until retirement. I promise you that it wont suddenly get better. Skills are something you can learn. Learn a hobby. Paint, woodworking, an instrument, anything. Spend some time outdoors. Notice the little things that we as people so often miss.  Life doesn't have to suck, but I promise you it will if you sit around waiting for it to get better. This is your wakeup call. dont blow it.
Trapped overnight in the dump. It‚Äôs my fault, I got greedy.

Get yourself together man. The bears will use that as lube if you don‚Äôt.
Dude if they are way ITM all you gotta do is short 100 shares against your position....otherwise you can sell. Don't put it below the intrinsic. That's dumb.

But if it's just slightly ITM, of course there are buyers. Even if it's 5 dollars ITM there will be. If it's like 15 dollars ITM, then short 100 shares.
Hopefully it stays above 20 till the weekend then I don‚Äôt care

Why. It just buy shares and forget about it.
did you hold through earnings
I really got fucked on my order fill. RH made me buy it so high that despite the stock moving up so much higher than where I bought my call I‚Äôm still under 20%. Such fucking bullshit they refused to fill the price I entered unless I paid the ask for it. I wish the worst on the founders may they all suffer ‚ù§Ô∏è
wrong time, they just fell 30%. Don't get me wrong, still overvalued as fuck, but they'll gap close a bit before plummeting more

I am not trying to shill here, but how could you not. A software package that enables a company to search all of their data and pull out info they need is incredible. 

Imagine Wendy sent some client an email in 2013 with advice that is now going to cause the company problems. They could search their databases to find the original email, all the reasons why Wendy gave that advice and any other related content about it. Then use that to distance themselves from Wendy and her continuous mistakes.
Ur gonna be ok BABA 290 eow
Well there's still money to pull out rn.
This idea that after one day tech is instantly back in rotation doesn't seem right. I feel like there is not enough reasoning behind that. Big banks will still turn to value and probably already have. Tech is so insanely high right now
Plus tariffs?  Oh wait...
Last chance to get on the BABA train!
A lot of tech stocks made ATHs recently. This is a dip from ATHs

Rotation is a hoax
Walmart & Home Depot report earnings on the 17th. They'll crush them.
right i understand lol thanks
You‚Äôll be remembered
BMW's new electric SUV has recently been announced and rumors are that it will be very affordable, only $100,000!
Nice run up on the lowest volume I have ever seen on spy

FNatic esports org is a good one but management totally screwed with investors and employee were using assets like it was a slush fund...

This is back in the day, also why would you crowd source from one of the hottest industries out there... especially when PE firms are often retarded when it comes to gaming/esports multiples...

...it‚Äôs cause you don‚Äôt want oversight
Honestly kind of hope it drops under 10 again. I‚Äôd go all in.
PFE says 500M doses by end of 2020 and 1.3B in 2021.
There are 5 other companies in or nearing large Phase III efficacy trials including at least one (Moderna) using similar RNA explorations as Pfizer. Expect multiple vaccines to be approved--maybe even another one by the end of the year. These companies are also getting U.S. money in order to ramp up production numbers. I'll go with Fauci, who says April.  Gonna be a dark winter, though
Didn't play earnings. Can't help but think this is a good time to buy.
Bro what the bell were you thinking buying calls when they have been up 60 percent in two weeks or so and we are heading for more lockdowns lol
Yeah I sold some puts, worked out
40% here bruh.

Its like a miracle to get a .5% gain before iv snatches it up.
No, but making the money I do at my age, with almost zero other skills gives me no choice. Life sucks then you die. If all goes well tho, I might have a nice retirement.
Not risking my whole account like these other retards bro we'll be okay. 40k volume on these puts. I believe.
I do but only because for the life of me I can‚Äôt figure out what they do
Lol only a very small portion

It sucks to know that my 10k investment could have paid off all my credit card debt, possibly be a down payment on a new car, could have been invested in a business idea...and here I am putting another 1k thinking I can make it back and break even T\_T
Luckily, yes I do. I work in the Fab at an MU facility. Just dangerous enough to pump some adrenaline and the pay/benefits are fucking stellar. Sorry to hear your having troubles, my dude.
Down 2% on my puts already
Nah man I agree, although I thought it was slightly exaggerated. But your math definitely checks out. Holy shit
TDOC calls yesterday was a fantastic decision
[deleted]
Financials will be released Monday. IPO a week or two into December
And SPCE on the other hand is losing even more money yet it pumps 6%.. this market makes sense
ask robinhood for 10000% margin over your deposit and try it out
Yes I was thinking that to, but what if they only are in the money by lets say 50cent over the strike price. It doesnt seem worth it, if there somehow is a cost to excersise them.
Now I‚Äôm glad I sold for profit lol
My bone spurs are tingling
RKT was the first option I ever bought last week. Feels good man
NIO just keeps printing money
Continue buying shares
Bro, same wtf
Hopefully fooking yes
yes... A/R and loans receivables is an asset... an asset is not debt. Any debt that is presented on the liabilities of GM‚Äôs financials is not this.
I do, but do the same thing for long enough, especially if you HAVE to, can make anyone feel sour. Good luck getting rich trading so you can free yourself from wage slavery.
Since birth.

Nah early December but financials released on Monday!
My LYFT calls are fucked. Fucking ridesharing companies

We don't need computers anymore, when the economy is run on airlines and malls.

In srs, people will rotate into shitty business that were barely holding on pre-covid and then wonder why their earnings are still shit, when they have to pay back huge loans and debts.

Take airlines, they have been burning trillions in the last 8 months, do you think they are paying dividends anytime soon? 

Meanwhile tech and ecommerce actually grew substantially even in the pandemic, do you think things will go back to "normal" again or do we keep this more efficient digital economy?

Great show
It's so funny when people are commenting on Ackman's bet against the economy. It was a hedge, he put small amount (26mil) on high risk cds and made 1000% gains. Of course he is going to cover his ass, playing purely bullish or bearish is retarded. Europe is going under a lockdown, US can go too. All of this Pfaizer hype will slow down.

     Okay, I wasn't expecting to see this guy who's from my little hometown in Turkey on WSB.
     More about him;
     He's blind, he was on the America's Got Talent equivalent of a show in Turkey around 2010 and became famous for a short while. He's called Bilal Goregen. Here's a video of him;

12/4 295c down 60% :/
Will they be easy to sell even tho they expire same day?   
I dont see much upside in buying them besides being ITM.
Watching billions right now, the show fucks
It‚Äôs because this isn‚Äôt an appropriate sub to discuss the guy cashing out.

What was apple turning around back then? They had steep competition from Microsoft to gain market share and a handful of their computer launches were failures. They didn‚Äôt have any other products. Your logic is skewed in survivorship bias. I‚Äôm not going to explain it more than that. Yea what the market couldn‚Äôt see the future like it cannot see it today. No one expected apple to take over the smart phone industry. Sure you can look at the fundamentals and create assumptions to your DCF but no one knows the future. Likewise, if DCF is so often wrong why would you be willing to take additional risk by paying up for PE hoping that the earnings continue to grow at the optimistic rates if no one knows the future?

Penny stocks are penny stocks for a reason. Their fundamentals suck. Their business model in the present suck. If the company doesn‚Äôt pass your litmus test why spend more time on DD. Also we just said how DCF is a crap shoot in projecting future prices so you would have to really want to take on a lot of risk without any factors of safety.

Best on both sides, 1B share buyback program. It didn't even run all that much on its week and month chart.

Don't really get it. Guess I'll just keep buying leaps just outside the money until it goes to 0.

But the allocation of funds to the top in ETFs is quite alarming over the long run. But I agree, I think it‚Äôs a looming problem but I don‚Äôt exactly think it‚Äôll ‚Äúpop‚Äù or cause a crash. More likely a long run change to value stocks.

I got a noob question. 

If I buy DIS calls 11/13 I plan to hold them trough earnings, if they go ITM by earnings and I somehow get a profit. How easy will they be to sell? - I dont have the Buying power to excersise them?
if he shorts Tesla then stages a workers strike, would that be considered insider trading?
Why did I read this as 'the market rear'
Wouldn't these be very long term plays? I doubt they are day trading with those amounts

You‚Äôre like a whining child. 1000s of tickers and you can‚Äôt find one that isn‚Äôt boring
I fell that‚Äôs why you just find a good stock suitable for this. I do this yesterday with 4 different stocks. Today I bought em all back and sold the underlying. All together I had 1800 in and cashed out total of 1900 today. All this just overnight
Its bearish for tech that is considered "stay at home". Its also "bearish" in that investors will be moving money out of tech and into other stocks in anticipation of their future growth. A good example might be putting money into casinos, transportation, or food/tourism industry stocks.
Thank you for your service

You don't think so? If we estimate 70 million people have had it, and estimate an average of 500,000 cases/day between now and April 30, we get 155 million people having had it by then. That's about half of the population. No virus has an attack rate of 100%, so most of the population who could end up getting it will likely have had it by then. These are not unreasonable assumptions given all the data that we have at this point.
Could be. I posted a screenshot in the edit of this post

AMD been real fucking gay all day
When are their next earnings? I'd playup to that possibly but im not invested. I think they are in for a major payday if their vaccine gets rolled out world wide. May even be a stock worth buying and holding if this is, as they say, a possible yearly virus (like the flu).

Just look at their revenue from the last 2 quarters and add them together.
We‚Äôre not looking at business travel resuming to normal until 2022-2023. Zoom will be here for awhile. Plus my calls are for December, when virus cases will likely be peaking. I‚Äôm not planning on holding long term.

Will it happen this time though??! I think it might :-/
False.
Keep buying, it‚Äôs working
You don‚Äôt know the news do you? Dropping 15% over two days is consolidation? lmao

No he had price trigger.
For this to be true, there would need to be a demand greater than the supply on that day.

Without any meaningful company news being announced, there's not going to be any additional demand on that day.
Bears much?
Too many call holders, I think you‚Äôre right. They waiting for them to sell.
I have a couple Jun 18 21  $500 calls, bought them about a year ago lol

Is investing in a turn-around play not investing? You're betting on their ability to improve their fundamentals and their business. Would you not say investing in Apple in the past in hopes that they turn their business around is a good investment? And yes, investing in any penny stock that became a multi-billion dollar business would have been a good investment. Obviously there was something there the market wasn't pricing in.

At any given point the price of a company should be the maximum price ever in an optimally efficient market with perfect foresight no? If you can look arbitrarily far into the future and know how the business will play out, then you should have a fair value. The market doesn't have perfect foresight and therefore is speculating on the future value. You buy stocks on the expectation you see something others don't, in the team, in the company, in the opportunity space.

Put another way, if stock prices being higher now doesn't make buying them at a lower price in the past a good investment what on earth are you doing?

While that's true, we've still never developed and produced a vaccine in this short amount of time. There's no telling what adverse effects could occur 2, 5, or 20 years down the road after taking this vaccine. I think it's a valid fear with anything you're putting into your body.

There's a good chance it'll be safe. I work in medical devices and I know the FDA is absurdly strict about this stuff. I think it would be worth the risk, knowing I can go out and socialize again without worry of contracting or spreading the virus.

But then again, considering most young healthy people who get sufficient vitamin D and zinc can recover from this virus faster than they'd recover from a cold... acquiring natural immunity kind of seems like it'd be a better option.
Because I bought
Looks really tempting at this range

Quick question, does this strategy work:
Buy 1C when cheap,
Price falls, 
Buy 3C when cheaper, 
Price falls, 
Buy 9C when even cheaper, 
Price falls, 
Buy 27C when even way cheaper,
Price rises, 
Sell at profit 14C minus time premium

Anyone have thoughts on this?
you guys just experienced one of the biggest tech booms ever and your begging for more, surely you can see that you were due for a correction after the past 11 months of gains on some tech stocks
It‚Äôs getting a little witchy if you know what I mean. Dollar is up nicely and smart money flow has been leaving the equity markets. Also Apple has had a sellside imbalance for a week straight almost.

Um, they might cut out the middleman, but they don't write most of their mortgages. They use partners, so I'm wondering why cut out the middleman just to put another one in?

Also, mortgage applications are dying rn. Who thinks they'll spike again before the vaccine is widespread and everything can reopen? Or before a massive stimulus gets passed, which still doesn't look likely?

Idk man that ass has a manly flavour to it
I bought more calls yesterday on the nio dip for next weeks earnings. And they are not looking good. I think nio getting pumped above 40 is going to be a volatile space for a hot minute. It‚Äôll rally higher but whether it can do it before next week we‚Äôll see. Fucking market rotation into Macy stock holy fucking shit why. That‚Äôs dumb money right there I hope all those motherfuckers lose their shirt on that stupid fucking play

Kinda but I'm looking at one in particular. Ticker is banned from the sub for whatever reason. I guess they're like a hybrid of a reit and a building company. They own land, lots of it, most currently under development. It's a medium to long term play that's already started taking off, so do what you will.
great question. I don't have answer but really would love answer for consistent small gains but it all depends again on timing. you need cash on hand for opportunities so its just a trade off

You're on the right track. They are measuring efficacy by presence of antibodies. We already know people who have already had covid, and therefore have antibodies, can get sick again. So a vaccine that generates antibodies.... yeah I'm not getting my hopes up
The US Army has already been told ‚Äúhey when those vaccines need to go out, you‚Äôre helping‚Äù. Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôll be efficient, but it will be effective.

And often I think statistically speaking it should not be going that way, but I tend to hold these big losers, while collecting small gains if they rise thinking market will crash or correct... The worst is when I long hold shares and the company crashed so hard I sold hoping it would drop but it never did and now the company quadrupled... Losing out x4 due to a 1% extra gain...

Thanks for listening to my rant ahaha

Lol. Be serious guys he needs to make some money

NIO is a value stock. Change my mind
That was the NIO top
You know the market is fucked when rkt does worse than Nkla after earnings
I went from up 98% on my NIO calls 2 days ago to being down 33%, why the fuck am I such a greedy shit stain of a trader. I need a new hobby
Imagine how boring the market will be in a year when all this volatility is gone
Sold TSLA at the top today... FEELS GOOD BOYS

Could it go down to 75?
I'm on my phone so I can't 100% tell if that gap was filled (looks like it was)
I didn't know BABA had one of Powell's money printers. Almost $75 BILLION in 11 days. LOL
We are moving up down so much that today is totally flat
Good luck Retard, may the tendies be plentiful
Reloaded rocket leaps.
Jelly of cash gang rn, today is extra fucking gay

I'm on ToS, but I guess that's the same concept

Top 10% as in what? Top as in good looks, as in big cock, you know, I don't think u r allowed to have cock pic with ruler. Top 10% bank account. What?

What if I bought using margin
we're broke
Me currently with my ACB 11/20 7p and my paper hands
When you see a POS like NKLA still here, mooning for sweet FA reason after terrible ‚Äòearnings‚Äô, then you KNOW this market is rigged as fuck. No, I don‚Äôt mean just a little like a casino, like serial rapist class rigged.   


\*Just needed a little rant..
Crack
Wow, a man of culture here! Very nice.
If it goes down hold, if it goes up sell
What queen B do
If you bought EOD yesterday or at open today.
I'm pretty sure that's a pump and dump though lol
cant go wrong with a huge dip like that
Even with no squeeze GME is a great value buy at this price.
Fuck your hotels. Look at [land and real estate](https://youtu.be/C__HDQgFIRA).
I'm also here for the confirmation bias. Feels (bad) good. Feels real (bad) good.
If you're on RH you can just click "sell" on whatever call and it's smart enough to use your leap as collateral, no need to close any of your current positions.
Alright I gotta learn how to use an image hosting site like Imgur real quick.
Gap down target near 6.32ish and should be support. That rangeish is also a key monthly level which if buyers showed up could have some large upside potential.

&#x200B;

Given your timeframe, I'd probably sell them by EOD.
I play shares so sorry if wrong forum. Options premium too ex for me. 

I set notification for high volume company that have a +-4% in a day, then I go either short or buy, hoping for a dip and adjust my limits accordingly. Problem arises when it goes crazy in the direction instead of taking a u turn.
This. CEO sold his position. Mission Accomplished. Next.
Are you fucking kidding
Pfzier ceo dumped his, talk about great timing
Lol you think nio would be a 800b company? Wow ur are retardedüòÇüòÇ

You guys are such tin foil hatters, lol. Its a sell if the stock hit a certain price, how evil lol.
Notice how many retards have bought into NIO calls this week. 

Realize that the majority of WSB has historically always been wrong.

Remember that stocks that beat earnings after running up 4000% still plummet.

Still go long and lose your money because you‚Äôre a retard.

Guhhhhh...
yeah, I just read that on twitter. I personally think TSLA is worth about half of what it is right now. Nice car though
the problem with poor entry is this.

you dumb ass self hur dur diamond hand it from -50% to break even and you're like omg finally. then you gtfo and thank the WSB gods for being kind to your poor peasant ass.

but what your retarded ass didnt realize is that the trend and sentiment has shifted and what you did was sold a solid winner, only to watch that position moon to +200% within the next few days.
RKT is just relentlessly disappointing
So bored of this market

This guy got wrecked in the comments lmao, you just love to see it Tom
Yeah definitely
Looking to reenter Berkshire puts
Acb
what are the greeks on it? specifically IV/Theta?

theta always has an impact as long as there is time left on the option. you said 11/13 so 3 DTE. So if you multiply theta times how many contracts you have, thats roughly how much premium you are losing to decay every trading day.

IV could be related to a few things, we've lost IV due to erection results leaning one way, however i think it is still inflated somewhat due to the contesting/tweeting being done.


It could furthur drop is mango fully concedes. It could also drop if any events,earnings, announcements are coming up.

Then again, it could also pump if mango has some legal case to stand on and contest things.

If you've made a nice chunk, i would consider exiting half at least. Just book those gains and let some of the winners run. With 3 DTE, i donno you already got your movement and are ITM, theta at this point would be my main concern
It‚Äôs enough for me, but it‚Äôs not enough to get tech prices back to non-fomo levels
Interesting definition of middle class you got there lol
If this is true, my retarded ass MIGHT switch back and donate more money to them.
Thinking bout datadog calls for December. I know nothing about them but the name is cool

Shhhh let‚Äôs keep that between us don‚Äôt tell everyone
uber eats. drive around, listen to music, make money.
Fuck was buying 11/20 NLS 22.5c a bad move?
Scare off the shorts. Both EC were great, rates low, market booming, this bitch prints money but keeps getting suppressed.
Post a screenshot of the setting, proof
It would be a diagonal spread. Instead of 100 shares getting called away, you would lose 1 leap. But you would keep whatever the difference is between your leap and the call you sold.
Stonks bro
This is spot on! A bubble burst is looming
so buy calls?
Don't go jinxing it for theta gang.
I‚Äôm with you there, but it is a hinderance when one of you can‚Äôt figure out how to stop spending money.

Yeah I‚Äôm leaving runners for that squeeze potential
No problem :]
Hello
I‚Äôm just concerned about a slow bleed from retail since they actually had a chance to get in this one at $2-5 range. Could be 1-2% a day for multiple days then a 10-15% drop out of nowhere from the big boys to justify to their daddy that they deserve the corner office.
so 2 massive days of tech falling to almost 10-20% isn't good enough? hmm i hope your amc calls are printing
[deleted]
lol.  We come here for laughs and memes.  If you're here for legit financial advice, you're stupid.  See you next Monday, retard.

Definitely. Once they are nailing the shipping aspect of it too people will continue to buy in. Theres a lot of naysayers right now with "not enough data" trying to downplay it.
23 actually but 24 this month
This is my quant
Tomorrow going to be solid green after the holiday. Buying into the financials dip.

Imagine gambling the CCP, look what they are doing to BABA.
Yes
Right? I‚Äôm actually cool with this
they still estimate to pull in 1 billion in revenue, the possibilities are endless, but that‚Äôs more long term

Cool bro. Fyi, I have already on an updated version of the app. So they might be rolling out incrementally.
You buy the same contract you sold. Not sure where we are missing each other here. If you sell a 11/15 100p on a stock for $5.00 and the price runs up, that contract may only be worth $1.00.  You‚Äôre doing good. You can either let it ride to expiration betting it won‚Äôt get in the money  In that case you‚Äôll make the $5. If you want to close the position, you just BUY an 11/15 $100p on the open market for a dollar. You are now long and short the same contract meaning it‚Äôs a closed position. Your collateral is released and your net profit is $4.00.
The news. Every night.

Nice to see the market barely moving to today. How wonderful
His sale date was pre set, so... news came after the date was set.
Who‚Äôs actually off work today?
Can double
Being retarded? It comes hand and hand with being poor
you really 14 though?
Let me know if you find a community who still does that !
So you...

- are too lazy to get up to put the CD in your console

- are annoyed by the *crazy* sounds the optical drive makes

- assume that people are generally okay with their purchased "item" retaining no value whatsoever, even if it's a mere $5

- think everyone, like you, can just go out and buy whatever they want, whenever they want

- think that most people have the internet capabilities to download games rapidly and would find it more convenient than spending an hour picking up a game

- probably haven't heard that Amazon are having troubles getting preorders out to some customers and won't be able to until December

- are going off of Y-o-Y "stats" and placing no value on anything that's happening being the scenes or the fact that GameStop will be one of *the* biggest beneficiaries of this gaming cycle at the very least, which will last 5 years at the very least


I don't think you're assessing GME fairly. You said it yourself, you only sell calls and but puts on GME. I think you are letting your bias get in the way of this one. It's not too late. Buy shares ;)

Cool, let's start w/ ur BAN
Not going to look at my portfolio anymore this week. Shit is fucking depressing me.
I grabbed a single one that expires 3 days after earnings just to spite you
Fuck this game. My puts down 30% on XLE even though it‚Äôs dipping hard. They start us up green on purpose to leech our option money
Look, I'm in on GME but I don't see how the PS, XBOX and a COD game release is going to trigger anything. The release has been known for months now. Why would the actual release day trigger anything? 

The numbers from those sales and programs that will be provided in a earnings report might trigger something but I just don't understand why anyone would think that something that literally every single short seller and long buyer has known for months will make anything change... Am I missing something? 

Sure there might be a small pop because of us retards on release day but people are going to sell as fast as others buy.
Can y‚Äôall put it in reverse a bit so i can join the ride?
BABA bagholders how you feeling today? I'm thinking we wont see 300+ until 2021.

People acting like they didn‚Äôt invent viagra
Someone else in the daily thread said he couldn‚Äôt find it either. Let me do some digging and I‚Äôll edit the post when I figure out why some people don‚Äôt have it.
Profitability is no longer a prerequisite for a company stock price to go up. PLTR‚Äôs core business is finding its feet now given how reliant on data analytics governments and companies around the world are now....
isnt that why we're here?

Seriously though, there's NO WAY Pfizer stays in the 30's with approval coming up shortly. Who cares if the CEO sold shares in a pre-approved sale done months ago. It's madness to think even this huge stock only moving 5% and still dropping lower on the biggest medical breakthrough in recent memory with billions of doses being bought up by countries.

Also, apparently, if FDA approves this vaccine it becomes much tougher for other companies to get approval. They are first to do it so they will reap all of the rewards.
[deleted]
No one cares
good morning everyone except RKT
Man, do some reading up if you like money.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna bleed. Maybe sideways, but too many people waiting on an entry point for this to drop much imo
Right
My funds didn‚Äôt settle because of Labor Day.... almost grabbed puts when I meant to grab calls so it worked out. Good luck out there gentlemen.
Right, I also made sure not to YOLO but even getting like 5-10 contracts min can bring a nice return. Low risk, high reward.
Oh? Analysts are saying otherwise üò≠üò≠

Law of supply and demand asserts the following:

1. When supply > demand, price drops.
2. When supply < demand, price increases.
3. When supply = demand, price remains unchanged.

On Dec 1, the supply is likely going to increase - because certain shareholders will be allowed to dump their holdings.

If NKLA were to announce a partnership with GM, it would likely cause the demand to increase.  If they were to announce it on or before Dec 1, it would shoot this to shit - but doing so would likely invite a barrage of lawsuits.  They would be accused of attempting to manipulate stock prices in advance of restricted shares becoming unrestricted - for personal gain.  Illegal or not, they would get dragged through the mud for it.

In all seriousness that track is hot wtf is it?
I have $580c dec 18 it‚Äôs down a lot so might as well hold
well. its a combination of IV and Theta. The relevant events have passed that could move the price, so IV decreases. and Theta has been ticking this whole time eating premium.

Basically your underlying hasn't moved ENOUGH to compensate for the IV/Theta.

We all learn this lesson one way or another. Some are still learning every earnings season.
NIO looks like it‚Äôs gonna bleed out for a while. Hyllion type pullback. I was in but got out at slightly above cost average because it just looks too familiar. Will wait for a GOOD buying opportunity and put these FOMO demons to rest.
Where did you see this
nice
My magic screen tells me we are at a quadruple hammer and sandal formation, expect consolidation around the 31 day average of volume converted to stock price by dividing by volume and multiplying by stock price, DaVinci values displaying major supporstance and I believe we are looking to travel through the channel to the other side, expect a massive sell off in the next 27.2 hours.

NIO is a great long-term play, even if you degenerates want to go long instead. It has the potential of making a lot of money for investors. Anyone with serious money looking for a company, I would argue that it is one of the best companies to invest in at this point in time.

Just posted as a reply in another thread but thought it might be more helpful here.

Looks like they have a partnership with Pfizer already and got funding from the government from earlier in the year.  

**For those who aren't familiar with the angle: this is Corning.  Among other things (like gorilla glass for cell phones) they're making vials for the vaccines and more specifically, standard vials won't work for the low temperatures needed for the vaccine from Pfizer, so Corning has developed new ones (Valor Glass).**

From NBC news:
>"Standard glass vials will shatter in the extreme cold needed to preserve the doses, so glass manufacturer Corning has partnered with the government to create a special line, for which production is ‚Äúramping up to address any supply shortages that may emerge,‚Äù spokeswoman Gabrielle Bailey told NBC News in an email."

https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-readies-herculean-effort-distribute-coronavirus-vaccine-n1247147

From Reuters (back in June):
>"Glass maker Corning Inc GLW.N said on Tuesday it would receive $204 million from the U.S. government to boost the manufacturing capacity of its vials that will be used to store coronavirus vaccines and treatments."

>"The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company‚Äôs ‚ÄòValor Glass‚Äô, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes.
The company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials. Pfizer said they would be used for some existing sterile injectable drugs and a range of new products."

Inverse Iron Condors. But I don't buy the long put outright until I think I need it. If the price action moves correctly in your favor the long put can cost the same as the short put after the stock has risen enough. So it is basically a free protective put.

Nope, holding through the week since theta isn't bad right now, and I'm still up 200%. It's getting hard to hold though with it dropping a dollar a day..
They're sold out because they have supply issues, not because they are making and selling boatloads of units. This guy doesn't understand that.
I've been making a lot more money with longer contracts however it is a lot more boring.
They released some new workout tech bullshit too could be a good play

So you're rich. Seriously, if you have the money to make a decent amount on relatively small percentage gains, buying shares is way smarter than buying options. I mainly scalp futures.

Done? You can't retire off that. Do it again.

What is a chart that can show me details of the stock price for each minute? Yahoo finance is ok for the day, but if I want to see price of the week, then it is impossible to see how the stock changed hour by hour minute by minute

Jesus Christ. I went to look at the GE options as a goof. people are buying LEAPS like they expect the company to become relevant again.
Those shares transacted at that spot price is the best you know. One person bought from one/many or sold to one/many.
All of the research facilities have these already and where the Vaccine will be distributed from. I don‚Äôt believe they would need to be constantly stored at -90 right before use.

Well I managed to unload those RKT puts only down about 20%.  Unloaded some APPS 42c 11/20 (half my position 5 contracts) at open when we pumped 6%.  Down 50%.  Currently down 80% on the rest and just diamond handing.

Picked up more PLTR and sold another 19c 11/13 for 50 bucks.  Theta gang slow gainz.
i think im done selling spreads on $cost super low trading on it the spread is ridiculous now and the credit spreads pay such trash for the risk.

been looking at jpm lately to trade with, not sure what other stock i can get sum good returns on
you have to yell it louder
You‚Äôre not serious right
I miss the old AMD

I'm a big ol üåàüêª and I think you need yo play both sides. Thats what I did untill June which kept my portfolio stable with a lot of puts. I stopped doing so at that point since I believed the msrket would fall before the end of the year, and now I'm down a lot. 

However I'm still liquid and have another 5 month horizon on many of my puts and some of my calls, althought the strik is getting weirdly OTM at this point. 

Tl;dr: identify as whatever you want, but don't be stupid. Have a thesis and play both sides so you have time to fight another day.

Noobs, so you didn't get approved for options or you're only allowed covered calls.  So, you bought shares and they are down... and you're getting killed out there.   Keep checking to unwind it after hours.   Low volume / high volatility -- you got AH 4-8 and premarket plus, my favorite extended overnight on some stocks.   Got out of some truly black out trades there with profits.   You're playing a game. Take a minute and learn the cheat codes.

/s
It doesn‚Äôt happen often but sometimes the other brokerage will exercise after 4pm and you‚Äôre brokerage won‚Äôt, usually after a sharp AH move like earnings. That‚Äôs if you hold through expirations, hence assignment risk. Basically your protective call expires and your short call exercises.

Go back to r/politics
Yeah the first earnings dump was slightly understandable because the stock rose too quickly after IPO. But this earnings they: Increased revenue, increased gross margin, buying back 1 billion in shares. Im scratching my head rn.
Agree with GLW. Not sure on the best timing, maybe on the next dip?  Looks like they have a partnership with Pfizer already and got funding from the government from earlier in the year.  

**For those who aren't familiar with the angle: this is Corning.  Among other things (like Gorilla Glass for cell phones) they're making vials for the vaccines and more specifically, the standard vials won't work at such low temperatures so they've developed new ones (Valor Glass).**

From NBC news:
>"Standard glass vials will shatter in the extreme cold needed to preserve the doses, so glass manufacturer Corning has partnered with the government to create a special line, for which production is ‚Äúramping up to address any supply shortages that may emerge,‚Äù spokeswoman Gabrielle Bailey told NBC News in an email."

https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/pfizer-readies-herculean-effort-distribute-coronavirus-vaccine-n1247147

From Reuters (back in June):
>"Glass maker Corning Inc GLW.N said on Tuesday it would receive $204 million from the U.S. government to boost the manufacturing capacity of its vials that will be used to store coronavirus vaccines and treatments."

>"The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company‚Äôs ‚ÄòValor Glass‚Äô, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes.
The company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials. Pfizer said they would be used for some existing sterile injectable drugs and a range of new products."

AMC time to cover is avg. 2 days and they're currently 50% short. That means they could skyrocket tomorrow to cover most of the shares sold short on Monday/Tuesday, right?

Much smaller bet than last time but definitely not good news
ETSY i fucking love you
Id say just day trade it. Buy it if you see a definite direction and either sell off in the morning or hold until you see a change in trend. That's what Ive been doing with it and its worked so far.
If your retarted enough you bought PFE at $41.00 so the meme can be right no matter how much you fuck up.
It's such a niche industry that doesn't really fall into tech/retail. So when money is moving around the others it gets looked over I think.

When it's not in the news it's not interesting. Think earnings will remind people it's there but it doesn't have a home that investors flock to based on market conditions. It's basically a meme stock even to institutional investors, almost like a luxury penny stock. It's where they'd go to dick around.
can't cuck the zuck
You hold until it goes back to -99% then sell

It‚Äôs skeptical but I‚Äôm a retard so I‚Äôm holding my 11/20 and 11/13 calls.

If you arent using leverage to go -126% then you are doing stonks wrong.
I don‚Äôt touch acb.
retards dont diversify then wonder why theyre all red.
Happy cake day
Stonks and onktions
Definitely think NIO could go either way after earnings
That's your problem. You have to be other people. Otherwise stonks don't go up.
DOCU is like free money when it loses 20+ a share. Always shoots right back up.
The 70bn of BABA was not for 11/11..?
there is a chance. no saying how probable though.
Example : Sell Put on stock XYZ at $50 strike for 1.00 and collect premium of 100$. Stock goes to $70. The Put you sold is now worth $0.50. If you buy it back, you'll make $50 profit, so 50% of the original premium. I'm tired of typing on my phone now so you'll have to look it up further yourself if you don't get it
You already got the 103. You have to pay 43 to close.
Sup. Selling covered calls on those gay shares? üòé
Do it
Seems like a solid move

Unless volume grows to meet market cap. Then yoh get poor.

That's why germany sets up vaccination centers all over the country and the army preparing to transport the vaccines so that the hospitals, doctors aso doesn't have to deal with this task and can concentrate on their daily business.

The relentless shilling and pumping of NIO on here has me feeling extra bearish... thinking about 11/20 35p

WMT is such an underrated stock. goes up 1% every day
I wonder if it's due to the US holiday, even tho market is open

Hahaha nope. Got 1/21s but the stocks flying up and then you say its dead for what reason? Just to be a douche like a Trumper is my guess.
Anybody gonna hold PLTR through earnings?
I don‚Äôt think the degenerates here know how exercising contracts works, 9x out of 10 you wanna sell the contracts.
So TSLA will be going down the next few weeks? Since there‚Äôs no catalyst coming out anytime soon?

Open a spread numb nuts. Sell the same amount of calls at same expiry right above yours on the option chain. Then close them both tomorrow

I second this
No, you only get the money for selling it. If you bought out your contracts right now with your profit of $103 you‚Äôd have $60
You would have to be retarded to do that ..
My gfs pancake ass
sell tdoc or hold?
Probably a good idea to learn before doing this.
Imagine thinking a $40 stock that‚Äôs already up 2,000% this year will hit $100 by the end of the yearü§°ü§°ü§° Delusional
Does anyone want to buy pictures of my dogs feet? Trying to make some money here
[removed]
It's showing you the profit if you were to buy back to close right now- In order to get the full premium of 1.03 you'd have to hold until expiry, but if you were to buy them back now, you'd give up around $40 to secure 60% profit. This a great example because it's \~$100, so the percentages are equal to the dollar cost.

Probably should have kept my acb puts

GME 12/18 pick your strike

AMC is just completely mind boggling right now. What the fuck is the technical explanation. It's not squeezing the shorts, it's not a value stock, it's not hovering around the price target. It's 50% sold short, and is exactly between the most recent all time low and all time high.

I have no explanation for this jizz drizzle price action...

I‚Äôve been losing with NIO all this week. So I decided day trade yolo with calls today. $1k gain in couple minutes. May not be that much but I can‚Äôt get out for todayüòå
ZM loves to pump for the first candle then die rest of the day.
It‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm buying it up.
If you only look at my daily chart I look like a fantastic trader
Honestly I recon NKLA caused this mindset.
Someone try and explain how nkla keeps going back up

closed out RKT 27c covered call. god i should have just fucking sold ATM lol.

i thought about 23-24 but that's my avg and i wanted to squeeze a bit out of the profit in case RKT moons. i mean, its 20% implied move and 200% IV, it has to do something right?

nope.

fuck this shit. honestly i can dump it now as i've sold enough calls since first ER but jesus christ

It was massively overbought, valuation is completely whack. Expect it to shed 30% when vaccine is approved and distribution plans are announced.

Yeah, I don‚Äôt think RH observes it. All the banks, like TD, seem to be observing it.

Imagine if you had ACB calls, sold them at the top and rolled it back into ACB puts
Me
What earnings are you playing? How‚Äôs Cisco?
AMC punching the air trying not to go bellow 3$
They don't earn much on vaccines, probably priced in by now.
FOR THE VETS!
Wtf is up with SPY volume. Do something.
Agreed it's been choppy but I think the much needed correction is over with. I'm holding Jan 15 $70c & $75c. Giving them another month to see how they play out
Maybe back down to like 16 but it‚Äôll keep going up it‚Äôs gunna be a huge company in a few years
And it shall. Just when we least expect it. Just like this news of voluntarily paying back debts came out on *console release day*. It's a show of strength from GME as we go into the new console cycle. 

**PS** I heard that Amazon are saying some preorders won't arrive till December. Who does this benefit?

It wants to drill so bad. But SPY gets bought up everytime lol.

can a kind stranger explain this to me? Getting into selling puts but confused as to what the numbers mean. Why am i up 58%? If I close the position now, do I get the $1.03 premium plus the $60 i'm up? WHAT DO THE NUMBERS MEAN?!
11/27? Possible but unlikely
Yes and no.
What do you mean profits? We just sell low and buy high here.
I am an American, sir
PFE is allergic to the number 40

Rotation out of tech back into tech lmao. Just buy tech calls
Remember yesterday when everyone was like tech is over, imagine thinking fucking tech is over smh
whatcha holding?
Got 35 puts on pltr for December lol
NIO priming to moon, last dip chance!
Hold Nio 12/14 Calls or Hold?
What tech stocks are you buying?
hopefully becky buys some more bikes. lets shoot pton over 110
Anyone looking at NIOs chart? I‚Äôm seeing it forming and climbing to $43 today?
It was alrdy undervalued at 320.

It got so many bad news and timing since then, like 10 lmfao
PFE is a shet stock anyways its the supplier for the vac moves very little even on good news
Yeah man I‚Äôm looking to minimize the damage and sell when it‚Äôs right at this point
Still uses rune scimmy though

Mini dip on nio bois then back to üöÄüöÄüöÄ

I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever seen a more obvious bear market trap than $PINS today. Bought puts let‚Äôs see if I eat these words
Those arent the numbers from today?
So you put in 30k to win 130 bucks? Lmao
Yes. I‚Äôm so far in the money at this point and mine are 11/13s. So not sure how much theta and IV will even have an impact at this point
Buddy, it already hit $200 a month back when I sold... LOL. Don‚Äôt be a clown because you don‚Äôt know how to trade. ü•¥
Baba up a bit more today then up a bit more tomorrow. I will be happy

Why the hell do you guys have so many holidays on the US...

So bored only baba is printing for me
Weed stocks are trash and always have been. Hold for max 5 hours
I doubt it‚Äôll go down anymore, you also have 30mins until 11/11 numbers released.

Either put a limit order or wait until EOD slight drop (tho might go up another 1-2% by then)


It‚Äôs going up tomorrow for sure
Straight up, I went dark on here since June my portfolio only went up. All the plays I found on my own since then. Then I read one comment "profit takers gonna cash out, tread carefully" and sell off for 96%
Only an idiot would do nio puts until maybe after the initial earnings boost. It‚Äôll hit 60 from the earnings report and all the big investors will put a target of over 50
Walmart sold theirs out in about 5 minutes... this company is one that will be phased out in the coming years. Look at it for what it is. One of the PS5s doesn‚Äôt even have a disc drive dude. You seriously think they‚Äôll be sustainable off of just selling consoles? Wake up man
I can verify all of this
Hold NIO 11/21???
What‚Äôs a reasonable target % for taking profits?
Lit fam
I bought
Can you eat my whole cock
NIO IS A STEAL RN BUY IT
No I think you are getting bad news sources. That's what they want you to think.
Buy half now
Well you should now that nio only goes up
BABA is prolly Going up this are just sales
It‚Äôs constantly fluctuating a bit. Now it‚Äôs -1.08%
MMs messing with UPS everyday. Let it go to 180 where it belongs.

Shoulda tripled down on NIO at open smdh
So then I was like "yeah just put it all on chinese electric vehicles" and we laughed and laughed. NIO= Neverending Infinite Orgasm.
Nio calls before earnings
This was the dip lmao
I don't think anyone knows. Consensus seems positive but the fda needs to approve it. I questioned the small sample size, others are questioning the storage and transport.

Bubble desperately trying not to pop
Imagine buying 10 shares of ACB yesterday because always buy on the dip, and then the next day they go down 20%
ACB....lol  Back down 86% on my shares.
if it gets/stays above 274 id say
Look at the big red candle abt 30 mins back.
Fucking discounts baby! I‚Äôm shopping! 1/20/23 40c
If we get more good vaccine news then yes. It‚Äôs struggling to stay afloat already. That would be the nail in the coffin. Move for it is to probably go with spreads on it.
Will Nokia hit $4
LOL
You can't just say that without specific strikes and dates.  Both these stocks have done crazy well the past year,  so if you want people to actually believe this, you gotta give specifics as that's the only way anyone is gonna make money with puts on NIO
Big money pumping to do more dumping like yesterday.
39c with runners at 41c 11/20
Just need it to hit 43 and I‚Äôm out of Nio
PAYPAL
NIO puts or DDOG calls for a daytrade? If it goes tits up I'm done trading till I get a good job, if it goes well I will keep doing yolo's
why do people think EV is a bubble? It‚Äôs literally going to be a mandate .
Will PLTR crash after earnings?
Remindme in 30 days
Will there be a sell off for pltr right before earnings?
With you on fsr brother
It‚Äôs like dealing with your bipolar relative
+5% gap and -3% intraday into one of the most boring Tuesdays ever
There won‚Äôt be another dip

Well that's the thing about staring contests. You can't just look away and *pretend* you didn't blink. You gotta maintain that eye contact. We need to wait this out and make them blink first. Hold the line.

Lol this place is just for the jokesüòÇüòÇ never listen to wallstreetbets even though sometimes you can find a good call here
I really want to buy TDOC here
Right? It doesn't matter that he scheduled the sale month ago if he can schedule the press conference to pump the stock and time it perfectly.
Bears were saying it was over when it hit $39 earlier ü§°
God I‚Äôm so wet to see nio 200+ next December
If you have to ask, sell it fast
sold in the open haha. thank god. nice tends for you brah
Tbf the only reason I got NIO calls yesterday was to be in on the fun
BA is a boomer stonk. It will never recover
GME leaps?
no please do look at it
Any chance RKT hits 22.5 this week?
Pfizer? Dont do me like that :c
Lol mms and GM, real cute, not selling u little bitches. 50 by Christmas üéÑ
Can someone explain PFE. Is their vaccine a bust? Reuters and others predicting it will available soon but stocks dropping. Makes me want to go all in on FDs
Buy BABA now or wait for the next Dip?
Hoarding 1100 shares here. Fewer for those bitches to short.
Well everyone knows they're not profitable or haven't been in the past but with the last few contracts they might be doing great honestly I have no idea what I'm talking about
this is one of those situations where since everyone knows what's going to happen, it's going to do the exact opposite
No reason for Rocket to be this low. Not a single reason üòÇüò≠
Probably not lol
Zillow $130 EOM
Meh, felt like gambling with a K today. The TSLA 420c is sacred

Considering how insane Monday's open was, I'm sad this week got boring as shit
I use TD fam. Had $10k buying power yesterday. Woke up to -$10k buying power
I‚Äôm holding, but I‚Äôm already up 30% I got trust in Thiel.
LMAO same. No I have $2k in this account. Maybe send an email?
here it is, the bi-hourly morning RuG pUlL comment
Discussion thread was insanely bearish on them last night
imagine not buying the MSFT dip. Why do you hate winning?
I recall a guy saying he would get the ShyKnees flag tattooed if Baba goes back to 300 end of next week
Come on algos - your human overlords are on Holiday. Take it to the moon!
NOC dip, YOLO
I'm assuming everyone in NIO is going to sell before earnings? Feels like one of those pump until earnings and then it's down 25 percent the next day.
Test. Yay. Unbanned
MM: oh damn covid is not gone yet let‚Äôs rotate back into tech stocks...
Yeah then I went on here and sold early cause this place is poison lol
ZM is such trash
Your puts doing well? üåàüêª
They are extremely weighed down by legacy (ICE) operations.  They can't just do a 180 and do ev, but do both concurrently.  That is not cheap nor easy.  They are car companies...nio and Tesla are technology, even software, companies.

I just watch nio rise, like when I was 13 and you used watch my dongus rise from soft to rock solid
NIO just set up a beautiful bear trap. Fuck the bears.
Every time a stock is down 5 percent or more no matter the stock I always feel like it's crashing to 0 but basically every time it fucking recovers in like 30 minutes. Moral of the story I'm a terrible trader
bank holiday
Very weird. I tapped on options settings and it‚Äôs a little iPhone style button you have to slide over. Maybe you‚Äôre right and it‚Äôs A/B testing or something. Hope you figure it out though cuz this is really awesome for RH to roll this out. Can‚Äôt believe you don‚Äôt have the setting though.

Never doubt NIO
Usually it doesn't but maybe they see the 100k in an account. If you want to know your credit score I would just use one of the federally free reports and pay the extra $5 for your score.
Nio really said "I call this one the 90 degree drop and recovery"

oh damn, was expecting a hard no. Idk what to say now.
Brother you‚Äôre picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Are you only gambling with like $300 or are you putting ur whole account into it and getting that much in return?
Thank you king

PDD TO THE MOON!!!
People will always need a house so I hope you went all in on rkt also
When you just made a reddit account and joined wsb
Any puts before Dec 11 are unfortunately a crapshoot.

In absence of genuine news, NKLA tracks indices pretty well, so if SPY is up, NKLA is up, and vice versa.

But any puts Dec 11 are a guarantee print. 

Dec 1: insiders are able to sell their shares (and they will for sure). 

Dec 3: GM deal does not close and they will finally announce since that is the "appropriate or required time" to.

My strategy: every time SPY goes up, NKLA goes up, I buy in more for 1/15/2021 15p.
Don't you give me hope.
Volume is so light in here RIP WSB fallen. I‚Äôm on the brink of joining u

I think Ackman does have a point. Lockdowns are likely (look at the data), markets will be depressed in the short-term. I‚Äôm bracing for bigly buying opportunities. As for math, that‚Äôs on you, son. Your mom and I have some positions to figure out ourselves. _That_ definitely won‚Äôt be quick.

buh buh buh babuh
Who has ZM puts...good job guys
This is great advice man. Would it be appropriate if I shot you a message here? I'd love to start a dialogue with someone who knows what they're talking about. Indeed, I have been a while and understand the basics but I need a bit of coaching on my risk management. To be frank, I lost my entire net worth being an absolute degenerate. I had around 20k in cash, 6k in my 401k and lost all of that. I also took out a personal loan of 10k (I know, the degeneracy is beyond comprehension, even to me as I type it) and lost most of it. I have gotten the loan down to 3k and am rebuilding my wealth, and my sanity. I'm 26 and thankfully this won't be the end of me - but if I was 36 and this happened it could very well be over. I have no responsibilities, and was looking to make a quick buck. Just a naive degenerate. I want to rebuild my wealth in a more pragmatic way. Anyways, let me know if you're cool with me sending you a message.. no worries if you don't have the time I can look all this stuff up on youtube. Thanks man
Pat on da head
Best of luck on that ride, man.
My hair is turning grey, I‚Äôm in the same position.

So I heard you guys were looking to buy NIO weeklies... Well step right up.. I'm sure I have what you're looking for.
[deleted]
Lol I wish. That‚Äôd be cool.
This feels really similar to the last two drops we‚Äôve had
Why do you feel compelled to go on the internet to tell people what won‚Äôt happen? Go to r/politics. Progression and innovation happens regardless of who is in power. We were moving in the direction of energy independence prior to Trump because of the ramp up in efficiency and production here in the states. We didn‚Äôt need others oil anymore because it was cheap enough and abundant enough.
Saw the same pattern over and over while wheeling it. Saw the dip yesterday, believed in myself, and now we mooning
so my buddy made 60k in one year from stock and he just quit his job to live off stocks lol wish him luck autists
Hate having a straddle. I want the stock to die but also to thrive. But if it died it would definitely be better.
im so smart i sold 1 nio 50c 10/13 to make sure our leaps and monthlys would moon, thank me later
Yes but why do you hate money
It was obvious with the massive numbers they are pulling on singles day. Was way over sold yesterday.
bought DDOG leaps cuz why not?
If it breaks 272, just might be 280 eod

Stay close to the money. Wait for below $3100 and for volatility to dip.

Back to going straight up
The exact same can be said about Uber, Lyft, Nio, Etc. None are profitable yet, and ACB is becoming closer to profitability each quarter with that threshold finally passing by 2024, and that‚Äôs without US legalization. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre supposed to be saying by ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù investors, my review boards that gave high price targets are the same that review Apple and CAT. Either way, I agree it‚Äôs good to be caution given cannabis stock history. It just finally looks like global, and US sentiment in particular is on the up, which will reward those willing to actually invest, and not trade.
Weeklies?

Okay, it‚Äôs still highly unethical to schedule a sale of your stock and then schedule a critical press conference for the same day to pump the stock lmao. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether they sold on the day of the press release or did the press release on the day of their stock sale - same result

Sorry man. Earnings went well. Call was fantastic. This seems a little price manipulative. I‚Äôm holding through. This is why I bought calls further out
Have I made the right calls? Did I do something right for once? NET 63.5c, NIO 40c, Disney 137p, all EOW.

I got a cheap lesson on IV crush when I bought a too far OTM weekly on LYFT. LYFT went up but my call went way down.

that's call WINNING
WHOA RKT?????
every morning nio dips a ton and i say this will come up at least a few % and then i dont do anything about it and then nio comes up. in the mean time i keep dumping money into rkt. i feel like i should be captain of wsb
This is the wrong play probably they are a piece of shit lol

Looking at price isn‚Äôt investing. Their stock price being higher now doesn‚Äôt mean it was a good investment back then. Stock prices are fundamentally related to future cash flows discounted back to today‚Äôs value to account for opportunity cost. We‚Äôre either of those companies printing money in 2000? No. 
By your same argument then any company that started out as a penny stock and it now worth something more regardless of the time it took to reach those higher price is a great investment.
Yep, let it build a good base for post-earnings jump.

NIO just shaking out the paper hands real quick
I'm in @11 which really makes me wish I had sold at the 52 week high a few weeks ago so I could have made a quick buck and sat on the sidelines to watch this staring contest since it ended up dropping back below my original cost basis.

Okay sounds reasonable but do you know anything about the stock at all or just think hype will die?

Wow good thing I got those 7c SRNE lottos yesterday
Big money starting to slowly exit. Yesterday's volume demonstrated it. It is overbought and way overvalued riding on the TSLA hype. TSLA is far more advanced and have better technology and infrastructure. NIO would crash down to $12 range it wasn't so heavily back by the CCP.

There was never doubt about BABA's growth. China wants Shenzen to be the next Silicon Valley; with that it needs international presence like BABA to attract talent and investments. Its not going to spite Jack Ma to cripple the country's growth.

Downvote all u want, makes me harder
That‚Äôs not what I said bro. I said what I bid will never get filled EVEN WHEN THE PRICE BETWEEN THE ASK AND THE BID IS WHAT I ORDERED AT. I‚Äôve used seven brokers before I never had an issue with getting an order filled like this. If the price doesn‚Äôt significantly go below what I put in Robinhood won‚Äôt fill it. Don‚Äôt defend this company anyway they‚Äôre shady as fuck and have showed multiple times they do make you over pay on orders.
Rotation back into tech stocks. Get out of those grandpa stocks you fools.
SPY has ran up or been flat everyday in November, we‚Äôre due to start dumping soon especially if election uncertainty continues, thinking puts for 11/20
Yea same here, just gonna ride this rocket ship till earnings and gtfo. Might hop in after if it dips too
BABA going vertical
Picked up some tech on sale last couple days for the inevitable rotation back into tech

Sorry I‚Äôm new to options sorry if I‚Äôm stupid but if they hit are you selling the contract or exercising it? Or is it whichever one gets you more profit?

So by that prediction the legacy OEMs are 5-6 years behind? By that point Tesla will have released something with more range and 2x cheaper. There is a reason it‚Äôs market cap is big. It‚Äôs because it compiles 5 companies in one. We don‚Äôt need GM, Ford, Toyota, Daimler, BMW. We only need one. There won‚Äôt obviously be one car manufacturer but at this rate the only remaining ones will be buying from Tesla

Then I thought fuck it margin is cheap I‚Äôll take 500 hundred and I‚Äôll buy leaps on spy if it goes down I got SPXS anyway. Holy shit though can‚Äôt buy a leap without overpaying.

Can‚Äôt go wrong with NVDA. Always a rocket ship few days before earnings. Not sure if holding through earnings is the move since amd and mu dipped
BABA about to show its power in 15min.
BABA is coming back baby
Please take note of the rising DXY index (USD), I find many of you funny enough to not want you guys to be wiped out from this thread.
5 contracts bought at $45.

Sold 3 contracts for a 15 dollar profit lmao. I‚Äôm  to scared to be risky. I don‚Äôt have a lot to invest only use what little I have left over after paychecks.

Small earnings are better than big losses.
PLTR?

I agree, they‚Äôve just gone insane at this point, can‚Äôt wait for them to get Blown out
Lot of salty downvoters here. Who hurt you bb?
I love how bears just assume the worst, meanwhile chad bulls realize dips are discounts

the great tech dip of November 2020, no one will ever forget it
Plug just got it‚Äôs price point raised to $26 by data analysts. It just jumped $20.01 close yesterday to ~$21.65 rn and still growing. Looking like some calls a couple months out to ~$25 might be the wave.

Imagine not buying the dip the past few days.
Dow crashing

This morning was the last time NIO will be under 40...hope you picked some calls up
Based on sentiments after every 1% drop on tick, whole subreddit is just bunch of traders buying on absolute top.

If I had the capital I would do the same. They got slammed hard and are finally starting to recover. I've always liked Ford, and seeing it so cheap I had to buy, First shares because I had NO idea when the recovery was coming, now calls because I believe it's starting. F belongs at 13, and once the dividend returns it will get there again as the boomers buy back in.

ADBE was comparatively lower on the PM advances than the other tech stocks, so did a safe scalp at open with 1/15 calls, and sold out 15 minutes later for a $1.3k profit. Not a lot, I know, but a nice little snack while the leap dinners simmer on the back-burners.

Musk has already gone over the physics behind it, its the conversion process that makes it not economically viable, there is a TON of energy loss converting and storing hydrogen, its fewer steps to just charge a battery then uncharge a battery with an electric motor, then improve the quality, longevity of the battery.

100% of the population definitely doesn't need it. I think maybe 30-50% would be plenty for herd immunity.

And I'm pretty sure about 50% of the population is going to refuse to take it, at least in the US. Even polio vaccines, which have been used and tested for a much longer time than this COVID-19 vaccine, have been reported to cause cases of polio. And COVID is a pretty new virus based on RNA... we really don't know if the vaccines could cause cancer 2-3 years down the road, especially when we haven't even tested them for a year yet.

I know a number of people who would much rather get the virus itself than take the vaccine. And I'm kind of on the fence myself.

Edit: 30% is way too fuckin low, you actually need 90-95% in a group to be immune in order to create herd immunity. Still, I think about 50% taking the vaccine would be just fine. Only about 50% of people take the flu vaccine each year and it's not wiping out our population

Wow the PLTR call activity is getting even crazier. Big money thinks this has a long way to go
ok NIO needs a little retard strength... i need some of you autists to bag hold with us

You‚Äôve been here a while so I assume you have the basics down. Try this for a little bit:

The riskiest option you should try buying is a slightly OTM SPY/QQQ call expiring in 5 weeks.

Your bread and butter should be options 6+ months out (e.g. SPY 400C 06/18/21)

Sure if might be boring but repeated 10-20% plays adds up quick 

I make $180K in finance and lost $7k in September. Realized it doesn‚Äôt matter how much you make, you still wasted time. Can‚Äôt get that back
except for the fact that almost all of their LARGE contracts were granted by Obama-Biden administration

not saying earnings will be good, just saying that the future looks bright
Yes I agree they are huge advertising engine;  I joke that if a platform doesn't generate ad money, they scrap it (lookup Google's Graveyard). However, through their years of focusing on tailored search, which has tons of personalized data, they have massive datasets that are being used to train machine learning neural networks and now can offer this neural network to AI initiatives. There are not a lot of companies that have this massive amount of personalized datasets, maybe just Facebook and Amazon.

Yes, but we are talking moving millions of doses.  Deep freeze is not super common to the point to handle that kind of volume.
profit taking is coming soon, people who are in the money will sell at any price as they are still in profits. be careful as we might be due for a small crash
BABA trying so hard
Pump the shit out of NIO! Blow it back in those MMs faces. Take back what the Bogs stole from you!

Calling it now. This is where we see a dip and then slow curve down until like 11:30 when we see what the rest of the day will do.

So are we just gonna ignore how Ulta is partnering up with Target? I thought y‚Äôall paid attention to Becky stocks or is that old news?
I think she said that she was young, and more importantly, Mormon, meaning that she basically had zero idea how to act in situations like that. And I'm sure the Trevvie boy can be very persuasive. He did create a multibillion dollar fraud after all.

Someone reminded me on here that nio‚Äôs price target was 46. Shit load up on calls

Nio aside, folks bitching right now decided to rotate into boomer shit after it went up crazy and did not buy the dip on tech. If you BTFD on the tech overcorrection you are being handsomely rewarded right now like a good little bull

Don't lie.


Also you said "bullish green dildo at open," while these are gamma green dildos. Not bullish.
> the flu is almost 120+ Years Old and there has never been a vaccine above 60%.

That‚Äôs just not how vaccines work, at all. You comparing coronaviradae to influenza is like comparing a giraffe to a dog. You can‚Äôt just draw conclusions like that because they are completely different. 

Ie. Look at the vaccine for rabies, TB, tetanus, or diphtheria. Those aren‚Äôt at 60% despite being as old as the flu, because they are completely different - mostly nonchanging viral bodies

It's not even efficacy right?  It's 90% immune response/anti body creation.   I'm not claiming to fully understand this, but much like the flu shot, there's multiple strains they are trying to fight against, so not sure the immune response is enough if there's multiple strains of Covid at this point already.

Biden is gonna be POTUS, EVs can only go up
whoever said ATVI crashes every morning .. fuck u and fuck my poots
oh. i'm not going anywhere. cutie pie
Gap filled, calling NDX top here
Yessir!  Only regret is not having more money to have bought more of that dip!
FVRR
So like. We really just did a 2 day rotation here? Pointless... hope ya'll made money on the way up and down.
See dude, I told ya - BABA is a very strong stock.

I would be shocked if they stay under $270 by Friday
JD lessgooo
WORK finally remembered it was a tech stock
this is literally me holding 5k shares of rkt going full mouth-breather as it bottoms
CRSR is the new NIO
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúOptions Trading Crash Course and Strategies‚Äù by Jeremy Walters
It becomes more and more apparent how many paper hands we have in here every morning by the amount of ‚Äúsell sell sells‚Äù we get at open for a 0.5% dip
Mother of Jack Ma....
Where's the guy who dropped $28k on AMZN calls yesterday after cashing out on AMZN puts on Monday?  Big brain move for real.
Calls at the top on Monday :(
Damn downvote brigade starting early today. Not even 15 minutes in yet
your right i generally buy em spend like 10k on em then sell em when i made atleast 30 cents on em and keep doing it cause they generally move between the same price though out the day . perfect for scalping
Wow REV lmao
Fuck this I‚Äôm just sitting in a car all day and I can‚Äôt even fuck around on here.  Fuck the veterans üò°

Lol lots of salty vets in here.  Sorry y‚Äôall played yourselves.
RIP NIO
PUMP THAT SHREK DILDO DADDY BABA
There seems to be a lot of excitement and denial  about the vaccine this morning in the growth crowd. I smell a nasty bull trap
This. When the topic came up in German Media Deutsche Post was immediately: 'No problem Amigos'. Can't be the only logistics company with rolling fridges.
I have a bad feeling tech is getting trapped
Sell or hold my AAL puts for 11/20?
FB, doesn‚Äôt stop and I already came
Don't worry about NIO. Hold and you'll make money. That a freaking healthy company
Just to aware you guys. XPEV reports ER tomorrow morning, that will most likely have an effect on NIO since it‚Äôs Chinese EV
‚úäüèº
Why? I‚Äôm quite a noob in terms of CHINA. But the reason I bought it is because it is huge and it‚Äôs recent singles day has proved this? I know this thing is serious with the government but how serious? Surely they know they economy is booming with great help from baba ?
Short whales came right in to dump it tho.

They set the algos to only pump one day a week (usually in morning) and apparently the algos are set to suppress for today it looks like.

Edit: hopefully some bulls and general bullishness can overcome these wankers... I'm ready to capitalize on such moves

Should have bought more on that dip to the 160s yesterday knew it was too good
**BABA TENDIE TRAIN TAKING OFF**

I find it interesting people spend more time in this subreddit downloading comments they don't like then actually doing some good due diligence that could actually help them in the future. We have a situation where people feel that downloading somebody actually causes their investments to gain value. It doesn't work like that

I've just been dollar cost averaging on my shares.
We get it MM, you wanna create low buy-in points for your buddies in NIO. Let's just alllllll go up together eh??
so my 50 strike NIO calls have a chance is w hat ur saying
Not even whoosh for this thread
Hold NIO and buy FSR for big profits
HYLN and CRSR saving my account, I'd let Thomas Healy nut in my mouth
Not the most ridiculous thing but markets would also probably respond positively
I will stop wearing band shirts when you stop shoving twinkies down your gullet Mr. 3x

Duluth has been disappointing in quality over the last 3 years for me. Used to be high tier shit, now everything Ive bought falls apart.

LL Bean is the goat for tall shirts in quality and price for me. Like I said, I was specifically looking for instances of brand shirts.
And GRWG... guess I‚Äôll just hold onto it to break even. Shouldn‚Äôt these be going up?
I should have put my money where my mouth was rather than suggesting people here. TWLO and FB calls üò¢üò¢üò¢
QQQ keeps going up but is gonna finish red
the biden bull run has ruined me.  who cares about 20% now?
That's a PHAT Green dildo on GME

I wonder if insiders can preplan a trigger instead of scheduled sale. Can a CEO say that sell 60% of my stocks of they jump up 15% in a day? Or even at a specific price target?
If you did some research you wouldn't even ask this question
RKT CMON
Did SPCE just merge with Amazon? Random moon landing
Exactly, it‚Äôs not the same search coming from their search engine or search optimization features it‚Äôs coming from smart ads.

Cool I can‚Äôt trade today because it‚Äôs a fake bank holiday.  Thanks Obama.
AMD delivers yet again. <3
You‚Äôve got to pump it up!

[deleted]
It‚Äôs a relatively small hedge (30% of previous position). The article doesn‚Äôt provide much details so I wouldn‚Äôt read into it too much. He has a point, the COVID #s are pretty much hitting ATHs lately. People are fatigued and becoming complacent. Not surprising to think there‚Äôll be companies that don‚Äôt survive the shifting biz landscape.

No doubt, plenty of retards will lose money thinking ‚Äúoh shit, time to üåàüêª!‚Äù The bigly brain retards never cease to amaze.

It‚Äôs funny how fraud works (in reference to claims about their upcoming ‚Äúhydrogen breakthrough‚Äù). That said, they do have a nice bankroll so they could probably gets some brains and have a crack at it. Doubtful they‚Äôd hit a breakthrough in less than a year though...

I fuckin love this video and that cat
See man, you‚Äôre like the 5th person to repeat this garbage to me today, and it‚Äôs not even close to true. Some low level district judges have rejected some of his cases, and now the next step in the legal process that literally everyone who doesn‚Äôt take CNN headlines at face value understands is that the losing cases will be appealed to a higher court. 

Besides, none of the important, heavier claims, have been denied by the court yet at all. So, I‚Äôm actually not even sure what your argument is. Do you think all the legal battles are over? Do you think that‚Äôs it? We won‚Äôt be hearing any evidence of voter fraud? King sleepy reigns and thats the end of the story?

You‚Äôve got another thing coming man. Not that I‚Äôm saying Trump is going to reverse the election, but at this point you‚Äôd have to be pretty indoctrinated and or just brain dead to believe there‚Äôs not gonna be any legal battles or further election contesting from here. 

Inform yourself
JD do something ffs! Tired of your weak ass

RKT really the worst investment of all time I stand my ground

nio back to 42 EOD
Sell or hold my nio 11/20 40c IM CRYIN RN üò≠üò≠
Remember those times when we used to dip for 5-10 mins at open and then rocket to the moon? Let's do that today.
Use the 20% to make it back
DDOG down 10%, my weekly puts down 75% lol ok bro
It's amazing they're even listed.
Tech crash over?

All his shit cases were laughed at and thrown out of court due to lack of evidence.
If you were a CEO, would you sell 60% of your stock on the same day the company released the results of a vaccine trial? 
 
Asking for a friend.
I diamond hand that shit and sold right at 416.50
I gonna hold through PLTR earnings. Idgaf if we up rn
Yes die LYFT lmao
Y we always gotta dump at open
NIO is free falling
Incredibly narrow, anxious, and bad logic. The sell off sectors would lead you to believe the vaccine is available tomorrow, that people will immediately flood outdoor activities and travel, and that Christmas and winter is cancelled since retail took a hit too.

Compounding the reaction is the fact that yes, some of these bubbles are due to burst and there‚Äôs a cooling effect after the post election euphoria.
Stock market is closed on weekends and so I can do my work honestly on the weekends. Gotta show my honesty too. üòä
Bear gang, stand back and stand by
Yup. Just don't buy options before January
I've been watching it since like may when they were called the front runners. They will 100% not get to $42 even by the end of the month. They wont even hit $40 because of all the boomers sell it all day long taking their 2 cent per share profit. But again I hope you're right
Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre straight. Gonna load up on 2021‚Äôs they‚Äôre cheap as peanuts. JP Morgan still considers them a buy after the anti bar shit from China
Switch labels for cat and drum and this works

There is no winning in this market right now
No way this is holding. SPY red by top of the hour

This questions is for the skyscrapers in chat. Do any of you that wear tall size shirts have any go-to companies for band shirts? I know its kinda specific, but I've ordered band shirts that are always cut off right below the waist (6'4) no matter what, even going up a size.
all i fuckin read is Nio this, Baba thatüòÇdoes no one trade anything else?!

Four Seasons Total Landscaping?
Your heart is in the right place. However, SCI and CSV rely more heavily on some of the funeral services. The issue there is that a spike in deaths will lose them money on services while urn/casket sales go up. They are unintentionally hedged against a pandemic spike in deaths that limits funeral activities. HI has other stuff, you‚Äôll need to dig to find what percent of their revenue comes from the urn/caskets. Again, I love where your brain and heart are at here. I wish I had better things to post in response.

Looks like we‚Äôre setting up for a bit of a snoozer day. I think I‚Äôll go outside.

Is $PLUG $35c 4/21 good? Or should I call in $SPCE?
Lower volume than normal with it being Veterans day, maybe?
Some days I genuinely think that I‚Äôm not pursuing knowledge enough and instead spending too much time enjoying quick pleasures of the world, and I see comments like this, with no real argument at all, just insults, and it makes me proud that nearly every real debate I get into, I‚Äôm well informed about and have evidence that informs my beliefs.

Good luck out there man, seems like you‚Äôll need it!
Hand on chest, no fear.

Yeah I mean with options, weed stocks are so predictable. Goes up towards ER and drops hard after it‚Äôs released. This year is a little different because of the election lol
I've got NIO 11/27 60. I'm gonna hold because I'm thinking we got a week til earnings. time for it to bump back up. probably taking a breather before another small run up (i hope)

edit: a word of caution on taking my advice. I also played RKT earnings

AAPL dropping so I run and check SPY and it‚Äôs unchanged.  Guh
I realized yesterday that you can buy multiple options at a time on Robin hood to create spreads or whatever you call them. I always wondered how you made spreads on amazon when I could afford buying the first leg
Nio you dumb whore
I came here to shill Sorrento last night for the first time in a while, and now it's up \~10% pre-market thanks to COVI-DROPS.

I don't care if it's a meme stock, it's on SSR day and there's a degree of a short squeeze in effect.  Short interest as of 10/30/20, published yesterday, remained at about 1/3 of the stock.

So, \~45% of the stock is held by insiders and institutions, and \~30% is held short.

It's going to explode again one of these days.

My post yesterday highlighted how they've started recruiting for the clinical trial of hospitalized COVID patients for abivertinib, to which there are not effective drugs available and LLY's antibody EUA is specifically non-hospitalized patients.
PLTR, you're beautiful and I'm proud of you no matter what.

Also, go up now

Damm it knew I should've bought pltr at the dip yesterday. That's the dip gone at this level
there‚Äôs 2 big sell order at 263.5 and 263
5k shares and 6k shares

It ain‚Äôt gonna hit that at open but when someone buys these off it can go up
STOP THE COUNT!
Chinese sources say it is a massive dump!
RKT will go up 4 points in 20 days listen to me

Thats the whole fun of SPWR man. Ya never know
No, its trying to price in future growth just like with TSLA

You do realize the stock market isn't about the present. It is about the future. This means people want to GTFO asap instead of being a bag holder. >\_>
Well atleast you have a score!! Most people in your situation don‚Äôt. I actually still don‚Äôt because I‚Äôve never taken credit and paid student loans and car off in cash üí∞

Looking like a red day, unfortunately
NIO call holders put too much faith in a communist government
Plus their 7-10 dollar per phone extra profit by removing the charger and earbuds.
74 is bottom. This is a good misdirection though
You should see my chart. At no point was I ever even remotely good at this. Just an immediate nosedive. So sort of like a 747 I suppose.
[deleted]
he predicts another crash?
Okay TSLA, I'mma need you to gravitate towards 420 again
I profited, if you don't count the fraudulent, illegal losses.
Anyone looking at BYND
I have 1000 puts for $30 strike for December and 1000 puts for $35 for end of November!  Drill baby drill. The Chinese and big money will dump then buy back. NIO is already above most of their price targets for a 1 year projection in the BEST case.
[deleted]
Stay strong üí™
yea $35 is the 20 MA roughly. it needs to call off for a bit so I could see it sitting below $40 for a week or two
Sure beats -30

Double down. Responsible for 20% of Chinese consumer goods and is now down 20% just because the CCP wants to flex its muscles. It‚Äôll bounce.

NIO holders, I offer you my thoughts and prayers. Hope it bounce hard.

Gonna start building my long position today, looking at 12/18 $340.  Support at $257 "should" hold...

Ease into this one, still showing bearish divergence on the daily charts...
How low is NIO tanking today? My estimate is 35$ , then quick bounce to 38$.

Ahhh I see your point.
NIO, time to start our day

Cut the shit!

oversold imo tho. Still a good buy but manage your risk
vaccine news was not good for the market at all

Eventually these institutional investors will realize the vaccine won't be out until at least next year and decide to go back in tech again. Maybe they''ll change up the algo inputs today

Fuck. Sell NIO 11/20 41 strikes or hold :/
Why wouldn‚Äôt you it‚Äôs free money lol
Oof
Nope. It closed for labor day, will close for Thanksgiving.
Nope, open
You won't be the only one - today's a "non-settlement day" where markets are open but banks are closed. Cash management ftw.
They don't want or won't allow $BABA to get to the size where the management team feels they can criticize the government and get away with it. It's a flex to show the rest of the tech community that they are not the rulers of country, the CCP is. It has been long believed that the CCP will bolster up their firms to directly compete and BABA as the "chosen one". This puts that concept on hold... 

The bigger issue now is, $FB historically has said that Chinese tech giants will eat US tech companies lunch if there's more regulation from the Senate, but with this on the line now, that regulation does not look too bad from the US if China is willing to take the first step. That would include the likes of $AMZN, $FB, $GOOGL, $AAPL
Tickers?
if youre gonna hop into ecommerce just skip the controversy and go into shop or amzn
Do stock holdings affect it?

You'd still be up 1%, it's just that new 1% would be 100 times more in value than your current 1%.  


Technically, yes 100% you would have made one AMZN share of profits with a 1% gain.
Just hold what you got and enjoy the 160 to 200 price tag later on this year

Max almost recertified, covid vaccine. 

Not much negative for ba there
You can buy back the option... so when you sell an option, you are ‚Äúselling to open.‚Äù  At any point before expiration, you are able to buy back the option known as ‚Äúbuy to close.‚Äù  You would do that if you are up big but don‚Äôt have confidence that the option is going to expire worthless. Your max gain will always be letting the contract expire at $0.
This week is literally aids honestly. It can‚Äôt get any worse all it can do is go up I guess.

Quick maths
I know, I had been in here pre-5/15/20 and I'd always sorta wished 5/15 didn't happen and the stock just grew organically.  However, Ji's bullshit did allow the company to fund things they otherwise wouldn't have (i.e. buying ACEA, buying SMARTPHARM, licensing MAYO technology).

The filing for the COVI-DROPS today is also a big step forward.
Gotta work Sundays though.
Baba disappoints me, I was so close to even :(
Math checks out

yeah, how do I increase that? I know utilization fucks it. I gotta pay a school bill soon so I'm about to max it out. It will probably drop below 700 next month.
Saw an article that said all the big funds were mad they missed out on the NIO rally. Should we really be worried about small pullbacks when we know there's people that want to get in, just a lower price?

Battery swapping is dead everywhere outside of China.

Look man, they would have done it already if they could. Some of those Hong Kong millionaires are still under ‚Äúsurveillance‚Äù for speaking up. You just don‚Äôt know where the CCP are keeping them ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but you don‚Äôt know where they currently are at.

Hope you guys managed to contain the losses yesterday (Baba, JD, ...)

women here come to this sub and realize men do have mental breakdowns especially after seeing their weekly calls expire after doubling down on them from monday to wednesday. THen losing hope by Thursday and coming to acceptance on Friday.
Wtf are tenders?
Dude congrats on the tinder looks.
You understand that after 2000 that MSFT and most big tech essentially traded flat for the next 15 years? At a certain valuation growth is priced in and FANG will trade like the boomer stocks.  

The next 10 bangers are hidden in small/mid caps and might not necessarily be tech.
He is talking today for the first time since losing
Bro that's what I'm thinking. It was an 88 fucking point jump from last month
im waiting another day
This is pretty much my interpretation also. It's almost regulatory capture for the existing big players that used these strategies to grow and displace Ebay and Amazon from the Chinese market but disallowing it to be used henceforth, i.e blocking a re-entrance to Chinese market by multi-nationals.
Pathetic market!
y today
Do my homework for me nerd
This is actually an interesting question - I am a masters student in classical economic terminology and it goes a little like this:  


Back in 1769 Thomas Put shorted the first stock ever. He did this by selling contracts to a shipping company he believed hadn't done their DD with maintainence and construction of the ship. The ship crashed, and he cashed in 16,000 euros (the equivalent of one billion dollars today). Having been made wealthy by this newfound maneuver, he decided to CALL his friend on the telephone who lost a lot of money on the ship. That is why we call them CALLS and PUTS now.
Where did you find this? Checked his twitter and it‚Äôs not there.
good choice but dont u think its risky? this entire market stupid trading flat idk if itll correct in a week
If you are looking at credit karma or something those are never really accurate
I imagine a room of expired contracts
QQQJ. The second nasdaq 100. I think it was a great idea for a growth tech ETF. Low IV. It got beat up with the rest of tech after the vaccine news, but I went balls deep in it yesterday for some long term calls which are very cheap given the share price. Feeling really good about this one. And it's not nio.
No u
Then how can people call a 0.04 increase mooning and want to off themselves over a dollar loss. The emotional swings are part of the flavor people here love.
Anyone know what the eff is going on with Purple? Been sliding bigly since Monday. I guess it was a stay at home Covid stock. Idk though. Any input appreciated.

welcome to the NIO discussion thread...
Thinking of quitting my Chick-fill-A job and joining AMC theater chain. Not many people are going to theaters and so I can do my day trading without being bothered by customers about not enough fizz in the soda. üòÇ
Why did i ever listen to that retard‚Äôs DD, $SNE is a piece of shit
Thank you op, for bringing a little cheer into my frantic scramble to repair yesterday's lube-less fucking.
I will if NIO doesnt.
Good point! NIO to the moon!
Walhalla is a little mountain town in SC.
Ameripoor about to start selling this shit off at open, guaranteed

puts on kimberly clark it is, then
Anything over 740 doesn‚Äôt matter. Your $3k credit limit is shit though.
This is the most important day in the history of tech, even more important than 2008. If we keep selling tech, everything tech will correct 20%-50% minimum to eoy. If we can hold these levels tech will go up for the next 400 days.
Check your account ages, reporting agencies tweaked how that‚Äôs reported and longer is better
I know, I could go buy a kids meal at McDonalds!

When tf are they going to release their solar roof?

My bet is never
So you mean he had a situation where he knew exactly when he was going to sell and had a situation that he could manipulate to the exact minute for them to go through the roof? Yeah, solid defense of innocence that you have there.
Sure they can. CCP wields complete power in world's #1-2 economy. The fuck do they care about international recognition.
Hi guys, I have just discovered that NIO stock can go down. Mind blown...

Naturally you must take out the biggest loan you can and YOLO it
Nvidia also like that. When it goings back up everyone gets on board

Okay. Which one of you rtards is buying ACB right now. Let it die! ü§°
I just dropped 3k on a eurorack so hoping to make some of that back today. Looks like a sideways theta crush to kill 11/11 contracts
Wow I can‚Äôt believe GLBS, a shipper is my best play; and shares nonetheless; things don‚Äôt make sense
How about you die?
Buhby NIO
extra depressing
You seem passionate about the company, sounds like you should invest üëçüèª
Literally. I was freaking out but everyone was like "chill its just the natural :) market :)))) CYCLE :)))))))"
Someone told me yesterday that a stock is cheap because it was like 40 usd... so many new people have swarmed this sub, I don't know if I should be happy due to the enrichment and steady supply of retards, or sad due to the average iq going down
‚ÄúAt this point, we do not believe the antitrust guidelines would have any material impact on Alibaba revenues,‚Äù Kessler wrote. ‚ÄúIt could also serve to limit new entrants from aggressively pricing to gain market share, which could be viewed as a positive for [Alibaba].‚Äù

There‚Äôs more retail investors now than ever in history. All that retail money added with fed bailout drove the markets to new highs. All these changes to the market have left old school investors using old index‚Äôs like P/E to believe that the market is in a bubble when they really just need to adjust their formulas for what a healthy market is nowadays.
My finance classes were years ago, but aren‚Äôt debts owed to you (accounts receivable) put under the long term assets column. Hell, technically it‚Äôs a tangible asset

They have been waiting for that patent since 2014!?
why would they do a buyback other than trying to prop up the stock price? Doesn't seem good.
Dude.... CCL calls?....

How the fuck did I just get an 800 FICO score? It was like 710 last month. I never missed a payment but I have legit 2 credit cards and my credit limit is $3000. I never took out a car loan or mortgage or anything. I'm only 27. I thought 800+ was like god tier for guys in their 40's with like millions in the bank or some shit.

It‚Äôs at the bottom anyway. You would have made like $10

At 44 I should have fucking sold and rebought here üò≠üò≠üò≠ Why don't I take profits in this shitty market
It‚Äôs literally a bankrupt company being held up by its lenders. Jumped 28 percent with all the recovery stocks purely based off the Pfizer news, but even if there is a vaccine, it‚Äôs still gonna take a long time to distribute it and for people to take it, as well as the fact that who tf is going back to Dave and Busters after the pandemic?

Look at stonk, it's down a dollar.   


Ya'll gotta buy longer dated calls.
Ouch
I think if you had the real deal vaccine you would hold your shares until the company made billions off selling it. Can my gold price move back up now from Monday‚Äôs sell off please
NIO does this after every run up, look at the chart lol
Let's drill one more time today, so we can all offload puts and go back to buying calls for the rest of the week to hold into the weekend.

No u buy more

Damn, premarket fade...
Why doesn‚Äôt LHX trade in PM?
I don't even know what this means
That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs saying..maybe he meant puts
Gotta love seeing AMC drop when I sold my puts for literally zero profits yesterday
Feel bad for everyone that watches AH calls moon only to have them crash during pre-market and unable to do anything about it.
Everyone crying about a NIO dip with under 5 mil volume lol. This thing trades at like 200 mil. Flood gates open at 9:30 you cucks, get ready for a volume pump
Might be drilling at open. For my brothers and bulls sake, I hope not.
Bout to grab a put
It‚Äôs not going anywhere though
The rest of the world has no say in who becomes the president. A lot of really smart and well informed people have been accumulating evidence of voter fraud.

Nah, it's fine. Not dying is a pretty standard requirement for success. Just don't mind that fine print.
I‚Äôm doing the latter, but if you want a good play, CRM looks like a good one. It broke 200 and 100 day MAs on the 2 hour chart. I‚Äôd end up holding until 270
I'm just going bullish on it. I think they're going to nail it.
Fucking do it
If you're a gay bear maybe....
Damn that CRSR is lookin so tasty, but I'm worried this is a drill after open
9:42
this week has been the most obvious bear trap ever, rest of the week we catapult to Valhalla
No is the time!

Why did it go up over 100% in a month? And 200% in three? That‚Äôs why.

Imagine thinking the implied fraud was the stock sale, and not the vaccine claim
lol it's a CONTRACT I'm pretty sure u cant just bail put. The whole point is that they have a right but not OBLIGATION to do what they want as a buyer, as a seller it's the opposite of that so pre sure ur obligated to wait for their move. If sellers could cancel contracts that woulent make sense no one would buy contracts if people could just sell and leave u hanging. Once u enter ur obligated as a buywe

Did FPRX cured covid or something?
what would be the point of that? so if say i write a put contract, stock goes up and theta, im up $1000 how do I close the contract and just realize those gains? or am i not able to and have ro wait for expiry every time?
Reminds me of when I bought $FANG after hearing all about how good these so-called ‚ÄúFANG‚Äù stocks were
Even Cramer is tweeting about the election being contested, even mentioned a coup. Get your head out of the sand

Yep he did.

Or hiring Ren Shaoqing to lead their autonomous driving division?
There may be some pullbacks but NIO is a long term winner.

Maybe if he just refuses to admit he lost we'll all forget that hes actually a LOSER now.
Why is nio going down?
Yep pltr
I think that was Fakenews too
Just being real with ya Chief
NIO calls 11/20 is free money
Next Friday $3300
Its not the person that you sold the put to. The OCC is the middleman and they will exercise your option and match it with some other person who exercised his long put.

what rumor?
Nah. This is what they get for Jack Ma speaking out against the CCP. Jack Ma is going to have to suck some dicks and apologize for the commies to forgive and maybe let it go. This is why we‚Äôre lucky to live in the US of A.
My weekly HFC $22 call is looking solid!
Go away bears
I‚Äôm out of NIO after ER week
I prefer blue shit over brown tbh
but when they buy a contract they are able to sell it before expiry, im wondering if you write a contract if youre up in money if you can just cancel tje contract?
Well he still timed the news.

NIO is planning to enter global markets later this year. Of course their autonomous tech would be geared toward China, that‚Äôs where they are going after the most of the market share.
Sounds good. üëå

how far out we thinking for expiry?
No. You can buy the same option - from anyone.
Sell before earnings unless I‚Äôm looking for a thrill
I've been making good money in the stock market and a friend of mine, who happens to a wage slave like everyone else, recently asked me for tickers because he wants to live an easier life. Same friend has been burned on options multiple times. Told him no because I'd feel responsible for any loss he incurs.
Haha NIO barely down and all the sad boys who missed out are talking smack.
calls on zm got it

Welp...NIO just wiped half the sub.
We won‚Äôt open green tbh
NIO rumor is looking truer by the day :(
hold on so say I sell a put, stock price goes up and theres theta day, im up theoretically $1000 is there anyway I can simply just get that $1000 or do i have to wait until expiry every time when I write a put/call
Fda approval probably next week. Possibly by Friday
Yes
If we have covid20
buy the dip on baba
Planning on buying yet more BABA shares.
It's the hottest thing in the marker bruh

Anyone have an original idea to share or are you all just piling into NIO until it pops?
The US government {most governments} run a debt. I.e. deficit spending.  We'll be fine. Taxing people or cutting spending too reduce the debt especially during an economically uncertain time is stupid and going to cause a steeper recession.
idek what to do boys, help

People are obviously not listening to the news. They will keep getting punished for Jack Ma speaking out against the CCP. He‚Äôs going to have to apologize and suck some commie dicks before they let it go.
Doubt it. Harder to fake cars than coffee. My biggest concern is just how much future growth is being priced in

Lol stonks only go up
no
Yes, this is true. You can't just undo/void the contract lol. You either buy back at a loss or wait til expiration and if it's ITM then you'll get assigned.
It‚Äôs sad because it‚Äôs true. ü•≤

yee but my question is when I sell an option that expires at a certain date I cant undo it right I just have to wait for it to expire or for the person to sell either at a loss or profit?

Sure, you could have maxed out your Roth and IRA at 75k, but that‚Äôs $25k a year. 1/3 of your salary at 75k, but only 20% at 120k. Big difference if you aren‚Äôt into the whole don‚Äôt spend any money thing.
I doubt Mulan made much rev as well and they just spiked so it seems like a good theory, but Disney guidance and subscription numbers will matter more than what Mulan did.
"Maybe if I just hold it'll go back to green... oh look now its -12%"

I'll buy puts before the earnings in December.
Bought ACB calls last Friday and promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt look until today, oh boy am I excited to see how much they‚Äôve grown after all this good weed news that came out since Friday!
That would be nice

Thanks. I only saw a demo. I‚Äôll have to try it myself once.

Damn BABA really gave me hope for a second
Wasn't the release date also predetermined? Or if not, hey let's just release it the day before I scheduled my sale
ER is pure gamble. I am willing to hold long as long as the current price action is not just a pump and dump and never comes back.
If I only had more money. I‚Äôd make a lot of money.
I don‚Äôt like when people say stuff that goes against my positions
No, it'll be 60 before EOY.
Anything related to data storage or power modification, I buy **in person** (I purchased a "Brand New OEM Apple Charger" back in 2014, and it caught on fire ‚Äî¬†investigated Amazon's "shared bin policy" and realized manufacturer's ~~CANNOT~~ WILL NOT be held accountable).
And lost 6$ in a last minute!
IF DE gets to $260, short that MF to $240
Not one person in that video is wearing a mask properly.
I was promised they only go up!
Ahhh, here it is, farther down in the thread.
I would say no, if you‚Äôre willing to actually HOLD
Yes
OOTL why is BABA crashing? Just ANT IPO?
LEAPS here.  Might buy more calls today because I expect a decent ER/I think they mentioned a share buyback
Not when this ER comes out
I came
GS on the way down: SPY $200.

GS on the way up: SPY $430.
I‚Äôm eagerly awaiting some kind of punchline but I know that I probably won‚Äôt get it until 2 days later.
Never play earnings and IV crush is real.
question, so if i sell a put option and the stock price goes down and the person i sold my option to sells it am I instantly just down money? is there anyway to make people hold until expiry or once you write a call is it basically up to the person you sold it to to make the decision


so if say i write a put contract, stock goes up and theta, im up $1000 how do I close the contract and just realize those gains? or am i not able to and have ro wait for expiry every time

Shares
He was an absolute mad lad that turned 50K into 200. Then he kept rolling the dates on his puts that were tanking. He said QE showed big cracks in the economy and trumps China deal was a political stunt. He was on the losing side then one day chinas trade negotiator left the White House abruptly. the market breaks lower immediately. His 200K turned into a million. Everyone begged him to sell out, but he wanted to have 2 mill so he rolled his puts waiting for China to send someone and have them leave the White House again with no deal. However what actually happened was the greatest day for call holders ever. They signed a deal ü•∞
We are back in red Day Green Day retard territory
i've got 5k in 1/15 90cs and 5k in march 95cs. If we dip more I'll buy more
If NIO stays at this level my puts sells will get exercised. Is it bad holding 200 shares of NIO @ 39$?
Should I hold my NIO 05/21/21 $35 call? Bought in at $5.15
I am. I expect movement this week in fact
Thanks for telling me dude, he sold after the news was realized right
Positions?
BABA  is a odd one. Good fundamental stock but being crushed by Chinese government. Who will win? Def not BABA

I live in a free state that's just rear tag.  When I'm flipping cars front tag is first thing to go.
Just your reminder that Nio has outpaced Tesla in growth. It‚Äôs up 90% for the month alone. It is due for a substantial correction. Don‚Äôt freak out over these last couple days. It‚Äôs healthy and will come back. If you‚Äôre an FD person....well that‚Äôs your own problem.
Never heard of it

When Trump really starts contesting this election hard and some of the truth bombs start flying so fucking many people are going to be caught off guard. Ready yourselves
What I learned this past week is that puts are a bitch to time but boy when you get it right it's like 10 times more fun than calls
pre market and selling off, name a better duo
And what did we learn from this experience?
But it is doing well and it posted 4800% Net income increase YoY
Time for puts them
It‚Äôs not like the stock exactly mooned on vaccine news
God damnit this sub really doesn't understand how stocks work. CLOUD COMPUTING IS A JOKE RIGHT NOW. Its cool but its not going to make any money yet. your tech stock needs to prove that it can generate income first. You want stocks to moon. PROVE they're moonable. That's what Elon did he proved that his stock was moonble. Tech is no better then boomer stocks at the end of the day. sorry to burst your bubble. But something can be innovating and still not worth the money.
Well I mean, sort of all and each of these - you know if manure hits the fan beta goes to 1

The issue is that VIX at 25ish is `so` steep....

If you don‚Äôt buy tech today you don‚Äôt like money
Goldman dropping the sauceeeeeeee SP to 4300?? Yeeeeeeeeeeeet
Your conclusion is correct.

Spread prices are volatile be because they are priced off of the bid of one option and the ask of another.  RH (being retarded) doesnt know how to update prices correctly so the prices of spreads looks super volatile while not actually being volatile (if the midpoint bid/ask of the two options remains relatively constant relative to one another).

I think spreads are generally a good idea for earnings plays because you avoid IV crush (you dont really own IV so its fine).  Really any high volatility options seem to be better traded with spreads imo.  Otherwise, I like bare options because you get SO MUCH value out of increasing volatility.  Volatility spikes are the main reason you see lottery ticket ACB Calls lol

RKT gonna gap up thx jay with the big dick buybacks
Yeah but it's done horrible post-split. I think it made it too easy for day traders to short.
Good sign 
Could mean they are setting up for more buying at open rather than a pump before open and a sell off at open
Or people could be buying tons of houses but using some other less shitty company for their mortgage.

I'd have thought CCL would have dropped more. Hmm
Is it worth trying to play both sides of the SPCE event? I guess playing far OTM calls could be good if the launch is successful. However, if it goes wrong then puts would obviously be the play.
Damnit Tsla is fading fast.

That would be ridicul....wait a minute.
Got the day off and markets are open. üá∫üá∏
Any üåàüêª's seeing this backtest of the broken 2020 trend line on DE???
right now the focus is on an internal coup attempt by the sitting president of the United States. So clearly the play is calls
jesus just how loose is your ass?
Totally in
nothing I think the dip was bought so we wont be down as bigly, I think there singles day report is released at 11 am
FSR 12/18 $25 - Still relatively cheap. 
PLTR 1/15/21 $25 - Earnings should be fun
I sold 11/20 270 PUTS. 

It's barely below my breakeven.

M just mad I sold the puts. I'd  have bought $BABA here for sure.

 By the look of things I might not even get assigned

Amazing
Good morning folks

What is the play for today?

mine HPE BTO 10c Jan
Thanks
i get half
Perfect thank you
RKT makes bulk of its income from refinancing sir
Nothing bad has ever happened selling naked calls you should do it.
triple top is just another word for double bottom
Hoping to break even today
11/17
Pics
Ban
When exactly is earning?
yeah, AAPL has done so well post-split.
Remember guys, when you grab nio HOLD for a while. It will pay off huge in a year. Don‚Äôt get scared from dips it happens for any stock but the fact that it‚Äôs been holding so well when it was expected to dip lower is a very strong sign
How low will ACB go?
If that happens I'm calling for his resignation!
All NIO is moving into HYLN
[deleted]
Sell off starts in 45 mins
Did you moan
its correcting upward
Does this mean spy will keep rockin, and fuck the triple top?
This makes it even more suspect. You know you‚Äôre about to sell when the market opens so you release the results an hour before open after your stock had just took a beating the few days before
Why should I care about that?
Happy Cake Day

This confirms my bias. Take an upvote on your way out.
Swiping right on everyone lowers your score in the algorithm that determines where you get shown on people‚Äôs stack.

Lol, it usually fades slightly before open. That‚Äôs because Europoors know Ameripoors gonna sell the fuck out of it for the first 10 mins the US market open. üòÇüòÇ

Desperation
pump and dump
They say the same thing when they see you
I‚Äôd take it just so I can show the paper to the Karens

The first thing they‚Äôre making is. BEV. UNbelievable. Other than a pinewood derby truck, that‚Äôs gotta be the least inspired thing ever.

So much for that proprietary tech. Doh
‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù
If NIO goes to 6$ after earning. I will sell my kidney to go all in.
Yes they do!  I‚Äôm currently sitting on a $3320 call expiring 12/04 that I‚Äôm not thrilled about.  But I‚Äôm pretty confident it will be green within the next 3.5 weeks.
Like I said, the general public will have the vaccine in 6 months best case scenario

IF it‚Äôs approved and doesn‚Äôt fail in stage 2 or 3 like literally every other vaccine so far
Haha fuck I am new.. didn't realize this was a ban-able offense

Thanks, I appreciate it
ü§°ü§°ü§°
Stop BABA I want to get off the ride
Ain‚Äôt no body listen to techno! now let‚Äôs go!!
The important question is how deep did you slip in by ‚Äúaccident‚Äù? I need to know. Going to buy NIO calls or puts today.
Stock way oversold on a vaccine that will not be available until next summer

Yup
SPY has reached triple top but there's no sign of VXX doing anything. I legit don't get this market rn

Usually VXX starts to creep up when the market has reached the top before correcting.
Well considering it isn't actually 0, no, I'm not talking out of my ass. Negligible does not equal 0.
It‚Äôs recovering. Come on baby! Pump
Can I smell
I've been here for years¬†
I'm rocking my peers¬†

You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.

No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

People spend their whole lives just looking forward.  To the next holiday or vacation or even just the weekend or the next big trade you're making.  Gotta spend some time to live in the moment.
Costco puts?
Mortgage Demand From Homebuyers Dropped to Lowest Level in Six Months-CNBC
If he actually knew TA he probably wouldn't be posting on this sub.
It stopped going up for a bit, just like it‚Äôs been doing after every pump since July.  

Do you assholes not even look at charts?
That means they are selling shares in the market and tank the price even more!
357.15
He spoke out against income inequality or some shit. Basically bad mouthing ccp
Wait what news am I missing?
After their earnings it might be a good play
we retaliate with our own antitrust?
It's a classic cartoon that's been around for ages, have a copy printed at home
Why the fuck is this sub still caught up on rocket??? Shittiest ticker ever
they are killin baba, stop them!
IN
I need spy to hit 360 today
Of course they do... nvda and amd power all the computers we now play and use to work remotely. Once covid goes away (over a year), do you think there still will be a surge of buying?
But Muh puts
It‚Äôll
Depend on ur strike and expiry. The companies fundamentals are great and it‚Äôs not trading on some crazy over valued multiplier. If anything big money would buy this dip as it‚Äôs a strong company and the only weakness is some China controversy. It could be an issue but ccp can be bribed away lol
ok so on tinder i just thro all my likes at the wall and see what sticks , but damn man how come so many trans and single mothers are so attracted to me?
[deleted]
When I wiped my ass this morning I accidentally slipped a finger in. I think this is a bearish sign. Will update soon.
.......selling that vsll is going yo make you like 1-2 ,dollars........whats the point?
Kinda want to buy
So did most hedge funds
They should make like a tree and get outta here
Who‚Äôs buying calls on nio
Lol they will. Anything to say China is ahead of America. Global Times will report ‚ÄúChina is leading the  charge against climate change, EV maker Nio has delivered even more cars than tesla‚Äù
Tech day?
THEY ARE SELLING BABA, Y? also is SE a good snag rn? arent they based in indonesia, and arent they not going to be as affected by the ccp anti trust regulations?
There‚Äôs a bot that already counts the most mentioned tickers just look at the thread eod
wait ... what ... did you just say great long term prospects, Yuge new investors rolling in left and right = NO short squeeze at over 100% net short .... 

RIP your shorts
Doin the lords work
Let‚Äôs see what tesla is gonna do today
How does this affect my psth position?
They may seek emergency approval as early as the end of this month, and first doses to be made available to first responders by end of year. Don't you have a den to go hide in or something?
I think Nio should open at $37
Friday*
So many shorts on Hyliion. Either it squeezes or drags down. Definitely gonna sell before earnings call.
NIO
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Hahhahaha
NIO is retardedly overbought, meanwhile BABA has been getting hammered over the last week. Which one makes more sense to rise?
Nobody would literally tell the world what their bet was... unless they needed idiots (sheep) to do something with.. 

Think about it.
[NIO DD](https://youtu.be/zYwdzYC3uUc)
Sprite Cranberry season has officially started
I know man fuckers
tos etrade etc do they just have to be EXTO eligible
Why did the StoNKs go up this morning?
Was down 8% Hong Kong last night lol
I tried to tell them
there pre market has alot of volume . i been watching all oct. this is alot of volume for them. prob to 42 then bleed to 38
The nio dip! Easiest play ive seem today
RKT stop fucking around and pick green direction!! Get up 10%
what the hell was i thinking buying SPX puts at close?
Don‚Äôt give me hope. I‚Äôm sitting on a weekly that‚Äôs lost 97% of its equity.
I have a ton of $45c/$47c 1/15s from like 2 weeks ago but I want to add sprinkles to it
Buying more of this tech dip! Green dildo incoming! Bullish!
go away nerd we possessed by animal spirits here
would literally save the entire market
ETM is gonna be the next dkng
Probably next week after JD earnings
It went up 60000% and you bought at 43
That is a bad plan
160c 1/23 or 200 for March
he aint
Yes
This whole BABA-ANT IPO manipulation by the CCP is an act of war. And should be treated accordingly.
No they don‚Äôt
That's exactly what I figured. GDit
ü§´ü§´ü§´ you cucks are scaring baba buoy
Which is why BABA tanked yesterday but I didn‚Äôt know they were going after NIO
I keep buying TQQQ shares like crack tho.
I got out the second WSB started spamming it. Kept going for a week more but better than holding too long
RKT IS GOING UP!!!!

*-0.19%*
Calls on sharpies, paint stir sticks, and cardboard. Puts on smooth governmental transitions.
yes. covid was not a problem and soon that problem is taken care off so its a double win for markets
If you think this is going to keep increasing past these levels I have a bridge to sell you
What did Ma do?
Did you not see how flawlessly it was able to run Among Us?  It had no issues with that high graphics demand game!
It sure can.

Can I order one large sell off with a side of fries please?
Lots of specials and emails to get people in the park through Spring 2021. so I say you‚Äôre good to go.
Sideway is a direction too, right?
So what‚Äôs the logic behind USA having indices higher than February‚Äôs values? Have we completely shaken off the negative impact of covid now or
They'll rise like 1% premarket then drop like 2% as it opens and then slowly climb up 1% throughout the day like every single other day of that shitty stocks life.

But I hope you're right
What happened with baba
Wow RKT got a new upgrade! To the moonüöÄ
Let me teach you a little something about the 'WSB Kiss of Death'

20% too high
They better
Pew pew pew

QQQ

Stop, wait a min, I got an erection
Once high school kids start trading options just to buy calls on BABA and NIO, it‚Äôs too late and you should have been sold the news.
It‚Äôs definitely not a scam, it‚Äôs a legitimate company. I lived with a mainland Chinese fellow, and he was talking to me about NIO over year ago. Truth be told I should have bought it back then but hindsight is 20/20.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I need the jolt of being called retarded in the morning, thanks brotha.
They are selling the power train. Any new order or partnership will be extremly positive
Hopefully man. I can't take another sell off right now

There were some big whale bids hitting the books too
WTF is up with Nio!??
You son of a bitch I‚Äôm in
Idk what to make of DIS long term; they‚Äôre trading near ATH after that last gap up, but they still have a ton of room to pop with park reopening eventually. 

DIS 200c 1/23?
Investment banker
10 minutes pump on RKT, dropped right back to red in minutes. Someone really doesn't want this stock to go green
If your account is 2000 dollars I guess
I know right. I need some green.
Well occasionally they have to be right. You just had bad timing
Nice, that‚Äôs enough information for me, have a good day

I have no idea what the hell your last sentence means. I'll sell puts on not Tesla though
I don‚Äôt feel like any season change has occurred since covid.
have too much baba, might get out cuz so many wsb heads are in, already taken massive losses
I knew once I started seeing NIO comments and posts everywhere in here Monday it was time to sell these leaps then buy back after you guys crash it

Last Stop for PLTR 12p 11/20
It‚Äôs good to know that if you find a vaccine for a very scary virus your share price goes up by 2% but if your retail video game company starts using Microsoft teams it goes up by 100%. This world is going to crash and burn.
This is literally what it's like for me rn since I have gold in my portfolio
Yup, 11/20 $30 call holders gonna print
ü§° bought mine at 265 at close lol but for 12/18
It was technically pre determined
Wait until it hits +5%

Are you retarded? Yes calls at open because it‚Äôs DOWN. I swear WSB only buys shit after days and days of green.
Accounts receivable is not debt. Loans receivable are also not debt, both are presented as an asset.
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
Ditched RH a few weeks back when I had some BA puts hit. As price was dropping my 500 became 2k and I desperately tried selling it. The piece of shit fucking loading screens and their shitty UI almost fucked me out of a few hundred. Transferred everything to my main TDA account that day. Fuck Robinhood I‚Äôll gladly pay commission on trades not to deal with a piece of shit broker with zero support. Oh I also like playing 0dte spx options snd RH doesn‚Äôt offer it so double fuck that
ya mon
guh RH is gay
BABA can‚Äôt go lower, load up
If you are on WSB you don't need to worry about Biden's tax plan unless he completely eliminates the 3000 yearly loss writeoff.

even better!
RKT showing a glimmer of hope ü•∫
Will it hit 94 tho
That makes no sense but. If they were dumping they would of done so already. Hong Kong and USA had their chance. Now it‚Äôll either trade flat or btfd
Lol why nflx
Remember kids, buy and buy to make the gay bye bye
I noticed spreads prices are crazy volatile too. Like in the same day, they can double or half their value. But what your saying is, as long as I buy a bull spread and the stock price goes up (above strikes) then I make money?
Y‚Äôall must be rich damn
F to the poor soul out there who bought NIO at the top
No - I am not a smooth brain Lenny
RKT stops giving me hope
There's always a buyer in the rtarded, err autistic, world.
I thought this was the gas station ‚ÄúStripes‚Äù lol

I think it was a pre determined plan to sell these stocks, but I may be wrong, probably am

Definitely am
The only real play is options or long paper hands.
Nio opening at 60 ‚ùåüß¢
PLUG leaps?
Biontech created the vaccine.  
Pfizer is testing and marketing and production.
Don‚Äôt....
Or now about 100% off the current stock price.
My prediction:  Next time NIO is green ittl be green
"Markets rise on hopes market will rise"
Lol bro I would rather be in your position than mine....
It's like the TSLA knuckleheads from this summer.

Insufferable TWATS.

Yes, it's been a great meme stock but Jesus H Christ on a fucking stick STFU and just go trade the god damn stock and earn some fucking tendies.  fuck.
Everyone happy about baba. Most of you bought calls at 270 ü§£
u ameripoors will ruin it again aren‚Äòt you
Baba all has potential
crsr what the hell
they do just not robinhood
They're like TSLA investors that can't afford to trade TSLA.
Netflix is discount.
ok guys question, if i sell a call like ford 10c expiring weekly without owning the 100 stocks could I lose my entire account technically if it goes up to $30
AMZN, NFLX, QQQ
Last week was not the time...says my calls
Yup
40 miles is 64.37 km
65m sales on day 1 of singles day with one more day to go
I think its going up
whats there to be compelled about in this report I thought they weren't really selling anything yet
I sold so many covered calls on Monday that are now 40 miles OTM I feel like an asshole.  Looks like ACB managed to not really profit from Biden being elected at all in the long run, although the new shares should be a temporary speed bump not a road block.

I really feel like tech stocks were overvalued all year, but the hit they took this week won't be a trend, they'll just slow their climb hereafter, something more "normal".
tsla gonna pump ?
Lmfao

Luckin coffee and hertz also had flashes of green. Are they in your portfolio too
what happened
So NIO calls at open or nah?
The COVID-19 Vaccine will be distributed to Army Hospitals to be available for Service Members. It is voluntary, not mandatory.
Nobody wants an F, especially in their portfolio
NIO to 200 eod
NIO green by open
Bet he looked racist
what are the moves based on this premarket action
Load to the teeth on N1O weekly calls? Am I retarded? Theta is screaming no but part of me wants to believe
Different companies LMAO
Something about pennies and steamrollers
Options are cheap but until recently ford doesn't move much. I just bucked down the 800 bucks for 100 shares. I'm going to sell covered calls over the top of it.
GRWG
Hold your nio calls
you have to find a retard to buy it.
You know why NIO is so annoying? Because Nio gang won‚Äôt stop talking about it no matter what it does. Goes up ‚Äúmoooon,‚Äù goes down ‚Äúit‚Äôll be green eod‚Äù, flat ‚Äúit‚Äôs taking a rest before moon mission.‚Äù Just stfu!!!
$ROPE
BABA pissed on CCP. Im not sure any one has done that and remained fine.
If you believe this to be true, start selling Calls
So Baba green Nio still red.  Ok.
Positions or ban
Are you looking at the top from 08-11 for that TA?
Because no one will buy it.

Theres no more new money to keep pumping this market so they just move it around to different sectors
AMEN brother
let the fading begin
Oh it‚Äôs guaranteed because I‚Äôm holding some 11/13 calls.  

But don‚Äôt worry ... the next Monday it will rocket to ATH just to spite me.
[deleted]
no doubt about that
Plz NIO don‚Äôt die now! Use the last of your retard strength to make it to earnings day
Hedging is for hedge funds
For stocks yes, options no
Here‚Äôs the thing about ACB, they are a Canadian company with no foothold in the US. Legalization literally doesn‚Äôt mean anything for them. The absolute worst cannabis stock to play if you‚Äôre playing cannabis stocks
Google Amazon Netflix Nvidia Tesla. Sell weekly far OTM puts/calls. Pray to Jesus there‚Äôs no violent moves in either direction so you don‚Äôt get assigned. I‚Äôd leave 200k in the account in cash too
Sign me up (so far I‚Äôm the only contestantüëÄ)
Who ever is still buying nio is picking Penny's off the ground in front of a bulldozer
You sold them, right?
What‚Äôs yours?
Neither. Positions were closed on Monday. Good luck.
Fuck that, just buy guns and ammo
NIO will deflate after that run up just as cannabis has. Wouldn't buy weekly calls.
Fuck that. I bought a Airbus spread on Monday before the news. Almost didn‚Äôt sell the call option. Instead of being up 10K I‚Äôm up 800 bucks :(
Its weird he wants to bump income tax, capital gains tax, and corp tax
Put leads to rope
Facts. Fuck the MA gov, I am not drilling in holes in my $1000+ front bumper.
What do I do with $9.53 of buying power to offset my NIO calls?
Covid vaccines are great stocks if you want to go with the pump and then dump that shit before it becomes obvious that the vaccine is actual, literal, brown shit.

This is the one I'm listening to right now, but there are tons. I haven't listened to Fisher in a while, but he is really fuking good.
Let‚Äôs pump bynd. There‚Äôs no need for them to crash that hard when we all know they weren‚Äôt that good anyways
Bet you looked like a dumbass too
Is PSTH still a thing?

If NIO actually gets to 37, it‚Äôs gonna go up lol

Was still defending mango man to my colleagues two weeks ago
Thank you. How can I find NIOs call/put ratio?
I only read WSB to determine the overall sentiment for the day.
It's so easy to laugh at how dumb boomers look when they sell the bottom but I'm pretty sure more of us panic sell the bottom then we want to admit.
the difference with options vs spreads is options often trade volatility and price action while spreads only really trade price action.  I wouldnt say they lower risk, you are just trading a different object.
BABA call holders rejoice hallelujah!!
I'll just assume that RKT will dump hard at open, like always.
Lets go BYND!
They can read the back plate. Ohio recently got rid of the front plate. Front plates hurt fuel economy. Now multiple how much it hurts fuel economy by the number of cars registered in MA. 20 US states don‚Äôt require a front plate.
Pussy imagine being American
Still feel like $BABA will dump at open. Good move so far though
What happened with baba that made the dip to get bought?
Netflix $550 eod
anyway, here‚Äôs glory days
I'll give it until the end of the day
Just 10 years ago it was still $10-$20/trade.  Before that $40, and before that a fixed percentage with a cap.
BABA to 240 my puts will print.
JEEZ
How do i make the -sign to +.. pls halp
I believe yesterdays RED day of 0.14% was last one this year. From now onward, it is only green.

Except this is a chinese stock and it‚Äôs gonna be pumped to the moon.
‚ÄúMarkets rise on stimulus hopes‚Äù
God I hope so. Bought 5 calls for 420 yesterday when it hit 402
If ZM could open at 400, that be swell
BAN
Irony is most investors are gonna have to escape this by getting high.
If baba hits 285 today I‚Äôll do a 5k giveaway what‚Äôs this recovery holy shit
Just hedge each share with a corresponding share of nio, while giving me an option on your wife.
[deleted]
By RKT mooning you bunch of Gary‚Äôs mean plays on FPRX, right?  Got it
Oil is up 3% today and 20% in the last week, retard
I know - which is why I‚Äôm saying AMZN is worth much more.  I‚Äôm not suggesting open a call that expires this week but I am suggesting that AMZN will sky rocket as soon as it starts becoming evident that this isn‚Äôt a vaccine coming tomorrow. :-)
Modern problems requires modern solutions,with this said,if u losing money just inverse ur screen/phone and then the charts will go upside! This is the way!!!

That‚Äôs generous. Some people that join the military are like, shocking, horrifyingly stupid and can barely manage to not shoot themselves.

Right?  I think if the AH trend continues it may have a good bull run this morning here is to hoping!
I don‚Äôt think techs quite done dropping so I‚Äôm waiting
Throw your whole account into SPY wheel and quit today

You get .4% a week so 2,800

It can be more but at 20 delta that‚Äôs what you can expect
Sold some 11/13 $85p yesterday like an autist. Hoping it stays above 85 by Friday so I can cash in
I was getting all ready to get pummeled by Chinese Tech stocks but nicely surprised that they're flat or up this morning :)
You can lose it all
Good luck!
My exwife's heart could do the job.
Bought more yesterday and may buy more today
i'd hedge with some puts if i were you, if it goes up you make $, if it goes down, you make back some $
MMM with another solid day on the way
that makes no sense
After reading the op, I have the urge to call him Bryan.
Holy shit I know a lot of big money was in BABA weekly calls but I did not expect this reversal good luck call holders!
I thought you were talking about the one not pictured.
FOR ONCE DON'T FUCKING FADE
It needs to go beyond 300 by this weekend or I'm fucc'd
$RKT lift off!! Better late than never üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Ford aftermarket last night has me excited. I can only get so erect, we going to the moon boys! It's been undervalued for a while, Fords investments are starting to turn into money and the news is positive for the first time in a while. a lot of people saw it as a negative that they narrowed their focus, but I see it as a real positive. I can see them hit 10 before they reinstate the dividend and mooning even high after. A return to 15 is not out of the realm of possibility. $9c strikes are at a really good price, I'm 12/4 expiry
Reverse ur phone then
Good luck man, hope it works out
Do you really think he is going to hold the WH hostage... lmao that‚Äôs a sure fire ticket to prison

Dear diary
I stopped buying baked calls/puts and started buying debit spreads to ‚Äúlower my risk‚Äù and I‚Äôm down 50% in my entire portfolio on the second day. Lol. Would probably be -95% if I had bought naked calls and puts tho so thanks whoever made that debit spread post
Outside of tech, the market has gotten expensive again.

Isn‚Äôt that activity highly illegal by the CEO?
I guess but market relies on news not the actual event
Sorry to break it to you, but the media doesn‚Äôt decide the election results and there are at least 8-10 states where the ballots are being contested with lots of signed affidavits describing (not alleging) voter fraud.  It‚Äôs not over, and Trump is the type to go through this methodically to make sure that he gets every vote that‚Äôs his.

everyone here (me included) expects nio to be the next tesla and we‚Äôre banking on it going up up up up as if it‚Äôs our ticket to wealth. it‚Äôs probably just another dumb company that‚Äôll fluctuate between 35 and 50 for the next 40 years. anyway, here‚Äôs wonderwall.

Mango is taking steps in increasing his staying power. He's firing top military heads in the Pentagon and replacing them with Trump loyalists. If he can somewhat control the military, Trump will deploy them domestically, particularly surrounding the WH. He even fired the Nuclear Security head. Imagine the civil unrest that follows. 

This is a huge volatility event in the making beyond Covid-19. Trump is strengthening a transition fight from all angles and I think people are discounting this.

It's been a painful, retarded retreat but I'm still holding the line. I know you talked about Search trends with no context.

Going to the movies or gym each has a huge social component. I made a media room and gym at my place, but I'll be going to the gym and to movies with friends as soon as I can just as much as I ever did, and I'm fairly introverted. I give it six months after the vaccine until things are back to how they were. Maybe I'm wrong, but those of us in the US just likes things the way they were, and I think that's why lockdowns have been so hard for most Americans to follow.

Fuck you. Also fuck the rest of you. Like, everyone in this sub.
Check Activision (ATVI). It‚Äôs pretty low right now @ $76 and is projected to hover back to $80-$85 with the near launch of Call of Duty (Friday) and World of Warcraft expansion (Nov 24). The expansion already broke a 16 year record of the franchise by having the highest pre-sale order. Definitely one of the top game stocks to own right now especially with Corona hitting us hard this winter.

Good luck man. Hope you make the bank. I got trapped in the overnight tank. Probably going to close at 90% under. Oh well!

BK, no Mickey D‚Äôs for us losers.
Many cities/counties adding restrictions, covid numbers up, hospitalizations up, holiday season approaching - excitement for vaccine is going to wear down. Can‚Äôt fight the short term issues we face regardless of the market thinking 6m ahead. Expect a rally in the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù stocks in the short term - AMZN, TDOC, PTON, SQ to name a few. Def a buyer here!

Are we doing tech today then or what?
Check Activision (ATVI). It‚Äôs pretty low right now @ $76 and is projected to hover back to $80-$85 with the near launch of Call of Duty (Friday) and World of Warcraft expansion (Nov 24). The expansion already broke a 16 year record of the franchise by having the highest pre-sale order. Definitely one of the top game stocks to own right now especially with Corona hitting us hard this winter.
Where do you feel it?
Spy put/call ratio is enormous right now. 2.26 is the highest I‚Äôve seen it in months.
Should I hold or sell my aurora and canopy growth puts at open ?
maybe
Yesterday was the dip to buy
Down 50% really need to just roll it into safe shares and wait this shit out. Oh but nothing is safe you say welp.
Hahahaha, good one
inverse wsb = nio will be -70 after earnings
US knows antitrust means nothing... CCP will not undermine world dominance plan. Best way to do that would be to stifle innovation. This is just internal politics. They don't want people to forget who is in charge

TLDR: BTFD
‚ÄúBig stock market rally comes with no signs of panic buying behavior‚Äù

Lmfaoo. Ok
SNAP keeps dropping while market keeps mooning. Was almost $40 and now back to $39.2. Fuck my calls

just sell calls and collect the premium
No AMC... Not like this... :,(
Still don't see my tickers being mentioned in the daily thread, looks like it's gonna be a good day boys.
i mean aurora has an eps of -26 and people still buy it couse of dumb news lol , bagholders till the ens of their lifes
Still 1.5 ps lower than it closed yesterday. But yes, let us pray together.
They won‚Äôt allow it because cops have cameras on their car that read the license plates to see if the car is stolen.  Wouldn‚Äôt bother wasting your time.
Less shambles than expected

So this man poops on one meme stock and promotes another meme stock. Interesting... I must find his literature.
I may not be doing this for a long time but even I know to expect this NIO pullback. 

Don't know wtf some of you are smoking
Yeah, that's why people that are less retarded than us usually try to grow their stocks faster than the inflation rate.

Gave myself 8,500 to work with. Last time I made most of my profits on long $baba plays I bought around the range it‚Äôs in now. Might do it again honestly.

What if 8 months ago he got lucky? Better inverse that üåàüêª
Yeah I got back into it on Monday after telling myself not to go back in after it ran up in September. It had cooled off and hovered around low 40s to finally kill some of the absurd premium costs so figured it was safe to take a stab. Would like to see a bump leading into earnings so I can sell these calls for at least a small gain.
Sell put is the way to became rich. By 18 teen wsb retard

guys, hypothetically, if amazon has one of those 4% days and calls go up 400%, if i am not in a long call over night when 2% of the movement happens, can i buy like 10 fds in the morn and ride it up? or will i cause a drop lol...deadass everytime i buy it reverses either immediately or very soon after. I really need to time and not miss this recovery well this time to make back my losses.
Because people don't care enough to regularly use it. I don't hear it super often.
Literally every boomer stock is up.
TSLA calls at open?
Trump supporter?
Yeah still seem weird to sell that much thought. But yeah I guess its might have been some kind of bonus thst he had to sell? Also wasn't is compensation kind of sad for a ceo, less than 8 millions for a company worth over 200b. Major shareholder should just have given him a 10m bonuses if he didn't sell.
No one is going to be buying used games from them you weeb.  This is Blockbuster 2.0
He made the decision to sell back in August. How are you autists unaware that CEOs must buy and sell on a schedule?

I‚Äôve been here since May and I‚Äôve seen it happen every single time
Low volume allows big buys to affect 1,5 minute charts apparently. 

I wouldn‚Äôt take it as a great sign. Yesterday in premarket there was an $8 raise spike in buying, and it immediately sold off in the 5 minute. And then it tanked to where it is now. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, hope it runs today. Hope however isn‚Äôt a strategy.

Some broker is missing one share for his trades of the day to align. Im a dumbass too but that was the explanation i got when working for a brokerage this summer.
How are biotech and pharma stocks legit... 90% nosdive within 3 yrs and all they do is pump it and then dillute with further stock offering etc. Why do people play these? Big pharma i get but anything below 10bn is hella sus
Sure same way big tech is "targeted" by Congress here. Money is money. Government officials own stocks (anywhere). They want to make money end of day. But they have to occasionally say a few things to "trick" people into believing they are serious. This is politics 101 in any country.
Yea it kind of reminds of one republican senator who sold all his stock March 18th and people were crying it was insider trading but really he sold everything at the literal bottom and probably lost so much money from being a panicking idiot

Forget BABA it‚Äôs BA time
where do you think the market will be 6 months from now do you think it will be higher by calls do you think it will be lower by puts. The Federal reserve is doing everything you can to prop up this fake economy I believe 6 months from now the market will be higher I believe 12 months from now the market will be higher I believe 24 months the market will be higher That's why I'm buying calls buying shares selling covered calls.
No , it just shows how overvalued techstocks are and people just looking for short time gains while others be lifetime bagholders , zoom is still overvalued to the roof

C) if Pfizer has a vaccine that is ready to go out then I imagine the true value of the stock will only increase going forward

Tesla is basically Uber, Toyota and Solar stock combined. Their growth will be something to behold. Q4 Earnings calls for $500. This bubble is made out of steel.
I‚Äôm 26 too. 3rd time this year being down 8k all time. Highest was +16k and lowest was -13.5k. This one hurts because I went straight self destruction mode and tried to make things happen/caught up in the political noise. I know what it takes to make it back though I just have to be patient.
trying to short CODX with puts and they postponed their earnings for a week and released PR instead, very cool. Insane for a covid testing stock to be trading at 70 p/e when we just got a fucking vaccine

Intraday is net 0 EV. Overnight is where all the average gains are. Of course it can go up intraday too, but the expected move is random whereas it's actually expected to go up overnight. The entire reason is due to Charm (the most important Options Greek which no one knows). MM basically position themselves to offset Charm with the goal of finding the new fair price the next day.

Don‚Äôt think so
Making money off of buying and holding makes you feel wise. Making a months pay in one day feels like a real life cheat code
There is no reason to unless you expect a huge price swing on that day or you plan on owning those shares at that strike. Your options automatically execute if you do not sell the contract - or your broker sells the contract for you if you don't have the funds for it. You need to look up more options basics lol.

yeah but the 8 months of the year when you're flat aren't so fun. and most retards here have $500 accounts so that's not very fun anyway. but some dick on r/stocks just told me i'm envious of their awesome plays after they started trading in May, so wtf do I know.
Man if there wasn't any vaccine news on Monday just think where we are right now.
Paper hand pussy lmao üòÇ
Yeah after it shits the bed at open.
Yeah I actually decided on CROX puts
Bankruptcy is bullish
I use DeGiro. Around 50 cents per transaction on American markets and 2-8 euros on European markets. The price of baba is not made on European markets with that low volume. So I prefer buying it on American market.
You realize at the end of the contract, if it's not exercised it's worthless? Exercising it early is generally pointless but at expiration, ITM options are going to get exercised.
Ya, I'm hoping on this fabled tech rally day but getting nervous. Watch I sell it today just so that it pops off tomorrow. Anyway, thanks
It doesn‚Äôt matter till it does. Insider traders need a narrative for these massive swings.

Do you think that it will hit 55 by 5/21/21? Are you willing to pay the price for the premium? Did you look at the Greeks to see if you‚Äôll get chucked by theta? In my opinion, this will hit $100 by middle of next year.
Fucking hope so. Been watching the run up and finally bought in at 40
Dumb
Not that high but yea. I‚Äôm thinking 43-44. Engines turn on Thursday or Friday

People who sell covered calls and get fucked when the buyer executes and your shares get called away...

Who are these people executing in the money call options? I thought it was always more profitable to just sell the contract to some other guy.
Kinda surprised that RKT is flat / slightly down. They have a 115M float. 1B buyback over 2 years with an average price of 21 equals 47M shares. So the float is going to go down from 115 to 68. That is totally significant.

Dry ice

I know that dry ice packed shipping is pretty common in science and eg food analysis

It's not so much a case of storage but logistics - if you are going to do 100 vaccinations / doctors office / day you need to be able to deliver from a central location with -80 freezers (pretty common in science) to every doctors office in a styrofoam dry-ice box each morning

Not as hard as you would think, so long as it is well planned

BABA weeklies wiping out 2 months worth of exponential gains. If there‚Äôs a lesson here it‚Äôs that taking small profits and getting in and out with a scalpel when trading stock options that are hinging upon the whims of a totalitarian communist Government that gets away with hiding global pandemics, propping up dictators, disappearing people to gulags and frying brains of other visiting countries‚Äô political operatives with radio waves, is probably something something something ...

Bots found the articles. Money managers don‚Äôt care about news like this they‚Äôll say it was planned and not a big deal. I don‚Äôt trust the fda or these companies. I also work in the medial industry and can tell you regulatory bodies are a joke. All medical companies are here to provide the minimum standard of care at the lowest cost, but at the largest price towards the end user. Hence why we outsourced everything because the regulations in China are almost non existent and medical companies can buy their product at face value and skirt the US regulations by loop holes.

Everyone has a 2nd version in a parallel universe. There is another version of you in a different universe buying/holding those calls.
I love this buying NIO pre market at uber 40 and then enjoying the day
The Pfzier Covid-19 vaccine must be kept at -70 degrees Celsius before use. Not sure if these conditions can be met in many developing and even developed nations, as its maintenance is costly.

Long freezer stocks
Jan 15. I know it‚Äôs a long ways but I see the bleed everyday and I think there‚Äôs other better ways to lose money
It looks like I lost the most money possible on a JD trade. Bought 12/20 85c for 4.70, sold 11/6 85c for 1.30, bought back 11/6 for like 6.00, sold 11/20 90c to pay for it, buy back 11/20 for 4.00. 

The original call now worth les than that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That's not what happened yesterday
people made their own media room/gyms meanwhile. even if the traffic goes does 30% most businesses wont survive. add to it the many people moving out of cities and they wont travel to cities. so yeah the world has now changed
Fuck this I‚Äôm going to plumber school
They offer 7 day free trial and can add redzone. You have to sign up with a credit card but they don‚Äôt charge you until the literal minute of the 7th day.

$ZM bull trap for about 15min after open than processed with the controlled burn
Sometimes Fomo works in your favor but most of the time you do get burned. Moral of the story is if you can't afford a loss don't fomo into a stock that's jumped 100% in a month... especially if they're Chinese ü§°

Hey guys im black and gay tooü§ó
What are the chances of the nasdaq going ballistic to 15,000 ?

Good time to buy

why do I buy 1dte spy puts

&#x200B;

why
$260 is a strong support. If it breaks below $260 we could test another 5-10% lower. Trust me, I‚Äôm a retard living in Shanghai. If it goes up it‚Äôs because of the iPhone pro max i bought today on Taobao
üëâüèΩ‚≠ïÔ∏èü§∞üèΩüìà
That kind of play yesterday seemed smart, and now look.

Maybe wait until 250? Not really sure what these greedy fucking MMs are hoping to get this stock to.
I wanna know too
Yes and thanks! My account said i will be available on nov 19
I think it s too late ,wait for pullback
I am a bear but I yoloed zoom call yesterday. I hate zoom but I wouldn't mind a cup of covid today
i barely noticed 130-150
I agree with everything except for your last little bit there.  People have always been stupid and always will be.
How are my ZOOM puts looking?!!
how much is in
Wall Street bets
Like for real how do I make the same bet as the bear in the picture?
If you have sold calls previously sell puts now, and vice versa.
Ew
Idk, theta is fucking you bad rn. NIO has to go up a lot I assume for you to make money. Which is possible but still
Nah I just threw $30 of my last $100 at a far otm call expiring in two days. Gotta at least act like I‚Äôm disappointed

So buying the BABA dip yesterday turned out to be a huge fucking mistake.
you guys will regret not buying DFEN/BA

DFEN up 40.21% for the week, had a +9.58 yesterday and already up +3.15% after hours 

DFEN pump to put the June 1st-June 8th pump to shame

God damn when is spy going to go downsies
This is the most retarded shit I‚Äôve ever seen
If you ever spot euphoria on WSB just close your positions. 2 days ago people were about to leverage down hard on NIO and be "filthy rich". They 100% thought it could not go down. If you ever spot that you should be worried and cash out a little. 

Who cares tho I lost 12000 $ on YOLO's but feel smart now for selling my 500 $ NIO stocks just before the drop lmao what a sad life.
Total newbie

europe mostly uses warrants - google that, and you are correct not every available stock is optionable in europe..
hah wtf
No :/ we‚Äôre stuck with apps like Trading 212 which are ass since they don‚Äôt do calls.
Too obvious gotta inverse it and YOLO $5 calls
Exp?
It's buying poots and then selling poots at earlier exp, say buy dec poots and sell mid nov poots at same strike

NIO 50c 11/27, this is fine
Do you not have robinhood there?
Yes. The Pfizer will be a shitshow in most countries except western ones. Cause they don't have the experience managing that temps. Most vaccines will get mismanaged and neutralized

So FB buys companies. Great. That doesn't make them innovative. The whole reason they bought Instagram and WhatsApp is because they were worried about the competition. FB hasn't innovated in user products in ages. They just copy Spanchat, Tiktok, and whoever else gets hot and starts to steal users from them.

What's the last great product that came out of FB that wasn't an acquisition? GraphQL?
NVDA up, ZM down

Total newbie here. I‚Äôm an EU trader so do I not get calls and puts..? Was looking to invest in NIO (meme stock or whatever) at the dip as everyone says it won‚Äôt stop rising.
Y‚Äôall must‚Äôve forgot what happened when NIO went this low yesterday
Did you make a day trade after you were already PDT flagged? If so, it should be clear you can't.

If you just got a fresh PDT flag for hitting 4 day trades, you should still be able to.
!RemindMe November 28
DFEN?
NIO, BABA and RKT gang in shambles
Just gotta remember to not let go, keep riding a winner till they die, and NEVER take profits.  Just how you play it my man.
Well I guess if he's talking tech stocks he made a good call!
Go on...
I think it‚Äôs the total unknown that‚Äôs pushed people away. Stay diligent, doing your research now and putting it in the market is how the money is made. 

NASDAQ appears to be overpriced if a vaccine is within a few months reach. The economy will take a while to kick into full force.

A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.
And if you actually look at where the revenue comes from, it's still almost entirely search and display advertising. Some cloud too.

Yes
Chart on CRSR looks good
Could it be that PE of >80, vaccine, and every damn household in the country is already a subscriber?  A growth stock with no growth potential
>Pfizer's vaccine needs to be stored frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit), an unusual requirement for vaccines.

Clearly not the regular temperature that can be obtained with dry ice. While the supply chain will 100% be achieved, it is still a challenge and the costs, time, risks are being underplayed  


>Pfizer is already working on a workaround powder-form vaccine to address the current one's biggest limitation: having to be stored at extremely low temperatures.

You day traded while on PDT. You need a new broker.
A chili‚Äôs lol.
IF there is a short squeeze, how long does one have to take profit on calls before it heads back down to normal-ish levels?

And can one rely on a trailing stop to catch it, or will it likely lead you to miss selling even remotely best peak?
Lol I have both. Account toast today. At least I won't have to check it anymore.
Actually no. Google's core business is still search. In fact, massively so. Why do you think they pay Apple $12B/year to be the default search engine.  

Yes they have "data", but the data is largely only valuable for advertising targeting. They are not making billions by doing other stuff with your data. They are doing all kind of wild science and engineering with the data.

That's absurd. Would you have paid $400B for Apple in 2001? I mean, it's worth 5x that much now, right? Does that mean Apple at $400B in 2001 was undervalued?  

The companies you listed didn't even have their main products in 2001. They weren't even working on them. It is completely unpredictable that Apple would create the iPhone or Amazon AWS. No one at those companies even had the ideas for those things yet.
You are retarded

Fucking doubt, everyone is gonna buy that dip. We're still way under many price targets

Also it goes down a few percent every day pre mkt and shoots way the fuck back up every morning
CORN. The 30 cent move yesterday isn't so typical. Expecting either a small pullback for good entries (14c May '21), or continuation on a longer uptrend faster than I thought.
Saying it genuinely, it sounds nice.

Dunno if RH does this, but most brokers (ToS for example) allow you to put in orders during extended trading hours

Have you sold your calls??? Did you make money??
Same thing with donating free western medicine. They‚Äôve been surviving for hundreds of years by having 10 kids and half or more of them dying. Go in and change that to 1-2 per 10 now you‚Äôve got a population boom. 
Without improving infrastructure for food production now you‚Äôve got a famine waiting to happen. 
We donate some food enabling that generation to live but then the cycle continues and they need more and more food donations. 

TLDR: easy to ship food and medicine hard to build sustainable infrastructure to support the population booms
I‚Äôve been out of the loop. What happened to baba?
Maybe the algos will see the drop and step in the pump

Good day sir
Oh you're talking about nio. Should have sold that shit. Maybe you can average down. Idk. I'm literally on the otherside. your call really did not want this sector rotation/pfizer news this week.
Where?
Well if you picked Apple or Tesla or Amazon a few years back you would be set lol.
More red dildos please

Very quiet here

Not many comments

Lol. I own stocks and calls too. Whichever works first (hopefully both) I'll sell. I see a downhill trajectory for spy in near future. If I'm wrong, it was a hedge.
Sold you the call :)
Good morning to all RKT bag holders who once again held through earnings.
what are you invested in and what options are you holding
U fuk.
Nio is retard
Yeah I think the floor is dropping quick, maybe a promising company but once WSB got a hold of it, the meme stock got over valued.
!RemindMe Nov 20
Only NIO calls

Ya don‚Äôt like it to be that way and it ain‚Äôt that way but you do.
Sell what you already own no buying anything new
I don't care if i won and completely destroyed you! (Jkjk!). There's still 10 more days haha and i do believe that gme still has one good spike coming
Yes. You can't day trade them though.
relatable i just put a market order to sell shares lmao
I have never made a single play on BABA (or even paid much attention to it), but I legit just woke up from a dream about having calls for it that were printing. 

WSB is too much in my head lol.
Fuk yea. Love betting on majors
üòÖ gotta go validate that ass

Nio calls
Vaccine needs to be stored at super low temperatures too.  Two doses need to be administered before the vaccine is even effective.

This isn‚Äôt the holy grail bulls were waiting for.
It‚Äôs pretty fucked that boomers got to PiCk oNe sToNK to ride with to retirement and we have to resort to high risk speculation to meet the same financial goals and retirement plans.

Just glad I‚Äôm not the only one here who‚Äôs dumping all their savings into tech and marijuana puts.
that was me for the last couple of weeks. my advice is just to sit it out until we have a clear direction on where the market wants to rally/dump.   


also you can scale you options to just 1 contract rather than multiple to save yourself the grief.
Which means I can't wait to see a shitload of Nio's all over the roads in the U.S.

That‚Äôs the recommended storage temp for RNA based vaccines and can be obtained with dry ice. Supply chains can be built and have been for less important things. 

I don‚Äôt have PFE positions but I like to call out retards.

Yeah OXY would be a good play. Regret not getting Tenaris LEAPs when it occurred to me. What strike and expiry do you like on OXY?
I don‚Äôt think the squeeze is gonna happen in 2020. 

1) we don‚Äôt know the revenue share detailed numbers 
2) I have a feeling management is in cahoots with the shorts. (Gut feeling no evidence). I work in the asset management industry and it‚Äôs bad to fuck over people with squeezes especially since everyone knows everyone and you don‚Äôt want to be THAT GUY. 
3) management said they won‚Äôt do buybacks for 2020.

Yeah. Fuck working for a corporate company for 30-40 years of your life. You'll just be oppressed forever and living off of a paycheck under someone who makes 1000x you do. The beauty with options is that it requires little work to set up as opposed to a startup.   


I don't know why this concept is so hard for my non-finance friends to understand. All they are focused on is getting a job and getting paid on time. Same people I slowly stopped talking to .
gofer them BA calls guise, those shorts gonna get covered after all the beefy gains this week
What are you hoping for nio ?
Pfizer suss. Markets clearly overreacted to a vaccine that needs unreal storing temperatures and has no established supply chain. 

[Pfizer's CEO cashed out 60% of his stock on the same day the company unveiled the results of its COVID-19 vaccine trial](https://www.businessinsider.com/pfizer-ceo-sold-stock-day-covid-19-vaccine-results-unveiled-2020-11)
Very true. I guess the final percentage that actually get sold (obviously the exact figure will be speculative) will be very telling as to what the employees think about the prospects of the future for the company.
the time to put BABA was last week, not today
Depends on volume
Yea but thats a divergence from the spy/dow/russel, eventually everything will go either up or down, my bet is still up a ways before down

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.

Kamala Harris wants to levy a 0.2% extra transaction tax.  So you‚Äôd pay 20 cents on each $100 stonk you buy or sell.  Imagine rebalancing a $1m portfolio and have to pay $2k to liquidate your holdings and then pay another $2k to buy your new stonks.

Tickers to watch today? Anybody got anything interesting?
You only think this because you‚Äôre a WSB retard. GM appears to have a lot of debt, but in actuality it has less than Nio. 80% of GMs debt is from its financial service. This is debt that it has taken on because of its dealerships and customers. When a customer finances a vehicle, GM shows that debt. However GM actually makes money off this debt. Meaning this is actually a profitable good form of debt. Accounts payable vs accounts receivable...

Yup.  Leaks news of a vaccine that you have to take twice, store at obscene temperatures and the data only shows it works for all of seven days as of now.  Then he sells the stock knowing that vaccine is trash and won‚Äôt be the winner.

The flaw in this idea is: bears can get comfortable fast. Let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre comfortable at -10%. You will start buying call options. But if the market still has another 10 or 20% more to flush, you will quickly run out of money. It works until it doesn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôll give it to you, I went to some EB games today and did not see a line up. I asked the employees and they said that a big chunk of their customers order online and pick up their items from the store. Most of the traffic happened in the morning and died down during evening when most wagies like me get off work. 

Store sales have also increased for merchandise aside from games; such as gaming peripherals and figurines. 

Back in 2017, I spoke with a hardcore employee and questioned why they were selling other stuff than games. In 2020, I can see why now with the closure of Toys R us and slow death of over nerdy / hobby stores and Eb games slowly filling that hole in the past few years. 

Fyi EB games is the GameStop‚Äôs operation in Canada.

Using conservative numbers, $499 is the price of the PS5 multiply by 500 stores is roughly $748m in cash on PS5 release date. I don‚Äôt have the numbers for XBOX but I‚Äôm gonna assume $390m to be conservative. 

This is roughly $1.1b cash that they‚Äôll have on their books for November. 

I also did some research on the klarna partnership and this is something that everyone is missing. 

Klarna is a company like PayPal but it‚Äôs much easier to pay with, and much easier to buy in bulk. Apparently it‚Äôs also 3 month of no interest. 

Klarna‚ÄôS institutional backers include sequoia capital and silver lake, which also backed Unity Software. Currently 9million active users and remember even if the economy is bad, people are willing to buy video games on credit. This to me is GameStop trying to change their business model to allow for multiple purchases from their consumers which will increase the dollar value per costumer. Using myself for example, I usually will buy 1 game every few months. But if I see a limited edition nendoroid (cuz funkos are the poor man‚Äôs version) I would snatch it up a long side my game using credit because why the  fuck not? No interest for 3 months. 

Source: I asked GameStop employees and did some light DD on klarna when I was doing DD on unity software.

That happens when you have less than $5 in buying power (cause you're all in) and they charge you $5 for robinhood gold. I saw that last month. Way better than a margin call. But fuck them for being so petty.

For example, last week we have been having nothing but Green Day‚Äôs and there‚Äôs bound to be a sell off. if you start seeing the premarket in the negative territory you should know it‚Äôs gonna be red for the day so you buy puts but don‚Äôt forget to put a limit order on it before you sleep !

Businesses have already realized they can reduce their expenses by maintaining a digital environment. Where originally they knew it, but did not think it would work for them, they just got a crash course on how it works and how to make it profitable. Even if the pandemic ends, we have not see an end to remote work, rather, remote work will likely be the new norm the world over now.

The best case scenario for the markets is that pandemic still goes on in the background without causing major lockdowns. So that monetary stimulus can keep inflating stock prices and we can have a feint economic recovery.

If pandemic ends, all central banks around the globe will pare off monetary stimulus harshly to have a more manageable inflation in the future. And that's where the crisis ends, stock prices will suffer the damages done during the pandemic and markets will tank.

So finding of a vaccine is not bullish at all. It's only bullish for the most severely affected finance, travel, hospitality, energy and defense stocks and oil prices.

what makes you hope for rebound? there wont be rebound with D in charge. even if by miracle R flip it somehow there will be more shutdowns in major D states anyway. 

even vaccine news is not realistic and nowhere to help within 12 months. to begin with half the people wont take it and Pfizer vaccine needs -80 cooling so distribution is gonna be logistical nightmare.

It's an issue. I don't like moving my ass to swap CDs. It's annoying, I just want to fire up my PS & start playing without waiting for the CD to spin out in the drive & crazy noise it makes.

I don't want to have it because it collects the dust on my shelves & carry that garbage through my entire life.

How do physical CDs win it anyday? Because you can trade them for $5 at GameStop? Giving games to your neighbors? Sure, but who does that these days? Sure these are benefits, but when the game is out, everyone buys their own copy. Do you think I am gonna wait when a friend of mine finishes Cyberpunk? No way & I am getting my own copy.

Besides, when the game is available right there on the internet, no need to go to GameStop, spend a fucking hour in the street with 'rona raging in the wild to get a box & it's really a FOMO moment you just buy it right on the spot.

The reason why big boys share profits with GameStop is, in my opinion, because big boys benefit more from that deal more than GameStop. Do you think they would just give a nice cut to GameStop just because they sell their consoles?

Bro. Every single retail store sells consoles and CDs these days. The CD section in particular looks sad, with games wrapped in plastic & not a single kid around those shelves. Big boys will share some profits with GameStop until physical is phased out & then just ditch them.

Enough profit sharing to keep GameStop afloat for another year or two before they inevitably decline into bankruptcy or become a zombie company like Kodak.

Even YoY stats on net sales by GameStop points at significant decline. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/284532/net-sales-of-gamestop-worldwide-2010-2012-by-region/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/284532/net-sales-of-gamestop-worldwide-2010-2012-by-region/)

Yet the new console cycle begins & all retards are jumping on GME after it literally went 150% up.

I have always sold calls on GME & always bought puts. It never disappointed me. I have stopped touching it after it went down to \~$3 and I have been trying to fill 4.5p and 5p expiring next year for a while now, spreads are too wide. I think it's inevitably going back down but even if it doesn't, puts are really cheap because GME sits so high now, so no regrets even if they expire worthless.
BABA this is fine, just take your time. Go up tomorrow if you like. Just don‚Äôt DRILL today.

Possible but also remember this stock is still a cyclical company where home refi and buying in general go down during winter times.

Are we buying puts or calls?

Haven't seen many bears out lately...
There are a few issues that nobody in this sub will acknowledge:

1 - the lack of a dividend calls into question institutional money's participation in this stock.

2 - stock buy backs have stopped and will remain stopped out of necessity.

The unfortunate reality is that Boeing is rapidly approaching a GE like situation.  Institutional money has asset committees that have very strict rules about what companies institutional money is allowed to invest in.  If Boeing starts to trip some of those rules (lack of a dividend, debt ratio exceeding a certain percentage of cash flow, stock float driving the PE ratio above a certain critical threshold, etc. etc. etc.) there *will* be a massive outflow.  Personally, I feel like the cap on stock price is somewhere around $250/share in the absence of a dividend.  Further, I feel that cash flow will be impaired by the amount of debt that has been taken on over the last year and a half and will continue to be impaired by the slowness of the "recovery".  I also feel that Boeing simply hasn't gotten the message about engineering quality.  All of this adds up to a very volatile stock price for at least the next five years.  More immediately, yes, there will be a large bump up in the stock price for two very specific reasons:  1) recert of the max 8 and 2) 1.7 in stimulus getting dumped into the economy on the cusp of a government shutdown (no stimulus for you, but plenty to keep government running).  With that said, I see several points of danger for the stock:

1 - institutional money deciding Boeing has become another GE

2 - a totally fatal max 8 crash happening within six month or recertification

3 -  European sanctions in combination with Europe not rubber stamping the North American recertification

4 - China forbidding the Max 8 from flying in or around their country 

5 - the final FAA recertifciation requiring a stand-alone type certificate for the Max 8 (almost guaranteed at this point)

6 - Boeing's order book becoming permanently impaired (it has already dropped below 30% of what it was going into this debacle) 

7 - dividend remaining eliminated, stock buy backs permanently ceased and float dilution as more debt gets piled on shareholders
He sold the day he announced a half assed result to the press, zero peer review. Based on 94 positive cases, Jesus fuck what a fucking scam
It is a bit odd, but i would say, overall, with vaccine hopes, more certainty about future and even more so, due to new president, more hope for the USA.
Amen

Don‚Äôt buy options unless you know what you‚Äôre doing. If you‚Äôre going to ride a hype stock be sure to watch the news so you don‚Äôt get caught in a pinch. In most cases you can buy 10-20 stock with the same amount of money you‚Äôd buy a monthly option. At that point it‚Äôs not worth buying the option and I‚Äôd rather go less risk for 10-20% of the payout. Time is never your friend.

Let's say the underlying is trading at 100, and the 45 DTE call at 100 is trading at a price of 5. This value of 5 is the amount the market judges is fair to compensate the seller for the risk of the stock being up in 45 days. Such a value is called **extrinsic value**.

Now take the 45 DTE Call at 90, trading at a price of 14. If you buy it, you can exercise it at once, for 10 (100 - 90) per underlying unit. 10 is called the **intrinsic value**. You can also see it as the value of the contract if the underlying does not move until expiration. What's left (4) represents the actual compensation to the seller for the risk of the stock being over 90 in 45 days, that is to say the extrinsic value. The extrinsic value decreases over time when the underlying does not move, which is known as **theta decay**.

As you can see, although the raw price itself if higher for the ITM option, you're actually paying less risk premium to the seller. That is because you yourself are taking the risk of seeing your instrinsic value disappear. You will lose less money through the passage of time (theta decay), but your exposure to the underlying itself (delta) is greater since you will lose more if the underlying decreases.

ATM or OTM options are 100% extrinsic value. 

A call at 0 would be 100% intrinsic value.

Can baba wait till market open to pump so I can buy more shares ty
I see it in a different way. A 100% pump is too scary. Not enough movement to long it and too scary to short it as we always have long terms who simply wont sell, especially with """racional""" stocks not penny stocks.

But when its up 500-600% you have to look. When it teally shoots to the moon, you have less and less risk to short it.

Problem is the entey and margin. I cant buy puts, I just short it outright so I can hold it for months of needed. As to when to enter? I wont even touch it unless it goes parabolic or gaps massively and shows weakness. Also I get out 3-4 times if needed. NIO scared me a few times, but now Im holding until it makes a new high. But Im good for the next 3-5 months to hold. Than on to the next one until and I dont care what it does, let it collapse slowly over time, no drama.

a few things i don't like with this sand nibba's crackpot conspiracy theory - 

1. looking at his dataset, we see that there are many precincts that vote <10% straight republican (i.e. over 90% of straight ballot voters are democrat). However, not a single one of these precincts y value is below 0%. that means that in all precincts that HEAVILY favored democrats, not a SINGLE one of these precincts had individual voters favoring biden over trump. Even if trump is the favored candidate, the chances of this happening are literally (virtually) 0%. are you telling me that these voting machines are literally favoring trump in heavily democratic precincts, mirroring biden being favored in republican precincts.  hmm, smooth brain methinks sand nibba big dumb extra retard. if you don't see what's wrong with this, then you also smooth brain (i'll give you a hint - any advantage given towards biden in republican precincts, is being given back to trump in democratic precincts)
2. if you take the graph of y-x vs x, it will ALWAYS be a downward trend or negative correlation unless y is linearly proportional to x (which will make it horizontal line). he does make this assumption.... however, here's why this is a bullshit assumption that proves i'm smarter than an MIT PhD - the fact that there is such a strong downward trend for the ENTIRE graph for EVERY county means that y is not linearly proportional to x. he tries to draw a horizontal line for some counties over the democratic precincts... but this mofo is clearly on fucking crack to draw those lines. his horizontal lines are more imaginary than the TA i see on this subreddit. WHICH LEADS TO POINT 3 - 
3. you can switch 'trump - republican vs republican' graph to 'biden - democrat vs democrat' ... and guess what? you will get the same trend.... this analysis is pointless
4. this mofo is looking at early voting for some graphs. whomstve are more likely to early vote? responsible, covid-fearing, intellectually superior democrats. whomsteva are more likely to vote on election day? fucking bumbling, thick-skulled, smooth-brained, neanderthal-looking republicans who think we're in a plandemic and are still having birthday parties for their eights kids with measles. 
5. back to point 2. the assumption that y is proportional to x is fucking stupid as fuck. does he consider what the sample sizes are for each? maybe x isn't a good representation of the whole.... maybe all the smooth-brains are actually getting wrinkles and aren't voting straight-party ballots anymore because they realize they should be voting on individual nuanced issues rather than HURR DURR ME VOTE RED VS BLUE HINGADINGA
6. this motherfucker is literally looking at random data, plotting y-x vs x, and saying the downward trend, inherent in any data that is statistically random, is a sign that there is voter fraud. how come he doesn't just plot y vs x? it's because he's fucking afraid to show you the REAL data - y vs x isn't a positive correlation. what are his fucking R values? this man is probably looking at data with R < 0.3. 
7. let's say that his hypothesis is y correlates positively with x. the null hypothesis then is that y does not correlate positively with x. he is literally unable to reject his null hypothesis with LITERALLY every single graph he shows. 

i hate to say it, but this sand nibba is just pulling the wool over trump supporter's eyes because the most stats they've had was figuring the % chance is of flipping heads or tails (it's 50% btw, i don't know if you know this) and they still failed. if democratic precincts had a tendency for individual voters to vote for biden, THEN he would actually have a case because then the graphs would look like an upside down v ("\^") which means voters in both democratic AND republican precincts voted more towards biden, which would be fucking SUS. but guess what. you can't even do a c2v symmetry operation on that fucking graph. it's a fucking Dinfh maybe, if you twist the graph a little and close your eyes.

I thought beyond meat was a sex toy at first
you can use so the drugs you like, in the end shit will catch up to you.

The only real way to fix it is to move away from night shifts.

Most normal humans weren't evolved to live this way.  Speaking from experience, used to work for a year doing 12hrs night shifts on a 3 days on/4 days off to 4 days on/3 days off rotation.
As well as Nikola with their private investors and other debths.
This is the way.
The one thing that cryptocurrency degenerates have on every other retard in the market is that they're desensitized to large downward movements. Makes for better investors.
if you can take on more debt before you die and venmo me the money, I'd appreciate it a lot :)

For some reason I got this funny thought about weimar division of bear gang which is so bearish on governments & central banks that they just buy calls.
BABA???

BABA has never been this disappointing.

Damn, are you ok bud?
Perfect thanks for this. Good luck out there today.
Me too
Majority of companies that reported beat estimates. Yet they dropped after ER.

WSB pumps always fail into ER. WSB missed SNAP, TTD, ROKU, PINS, QCOM

IV crush has won for most other ER.

My take is NIO will do nothing and crush both call and put holders, losses for everyone.
Yeah I bought at almost the top, too.  Thankfully I recently converted to pussyism so its all shares, and I plan to hold longtime.
My thoughts as well, their short term numbers will not be great.

why the hell do you want to buy rolls royce? they dont do cars anymore, thats owned by BMW these days. they only do engines for airplanes and well travel industry is where it is ...
I mean it's the same price as ARKK right now if you're in on that which contains a piece of CRSPR. It's early days of genome editing and yet market already has these guys priced in minimum 100$ a share, ILLUMINA is outrageous already. I do think they will become new tech giants though, the biotech companies.
What till it goes over $50 then Buy.... It'll be cheaper then.
That‚Äôs painful, but Microsoft to even it out
Yes.
rocket mortgage sux, worse rates than traditional routes
A lot of people never saying shit in this sub and just troll. I would check your Greeks, but if theta is high along with high IV I would get out depending if Nio keeps dipping. If not, keep an eye on the first hour of regular trading. The general sentiment is it will dump at earnings, probably even Monday. But for a 50c, you're gonna need sharp upward movement between now and Friday. Who knows though.
At London Stock Exchange I believe this would be 1k, but if you're correct, then the math is even worse as the price should be 50 GBP and not 1.3k...
I bought BABA 2 days before CCP fucked them.
To NIO or not to NIO.
Yep it's called a share.

Totally agree that shares are the best play rn. GME option spreads are wide, illiquid, and terrible. We need steady, organic share accumulation over time to flatten the stock out for awhile, then when call premiums die down, hit it hard with 3-12 month calls and pray for a big news catalyst
Sell. I'll buy NIO again if their earnings are promising and if their forward P/S is not higher than Tesla
Yeah for now but u think they will reach 3,300 $ again?

If you shift to value stocks only when the vaccine is ready, you'll be late. Buy the rumour, sell the news. Market looks forward, etc.
Stay with the facts. Stock market is very honest at the end of the day. NIO has a fantastic potential. It made a run of around 100% and now comes a correction. I won‚Äôt touch NIO this week anymore and took a decent profit. However I will jump back in maybe Friday late or next week. Your call can make it and I would not sell. If still shit EOW next week. You can evaluate again.

VLO is petroleum so they are going to be kind of fucked for a while. IRM is a REIT so they are also going to be down, but IMO will recover faster than oil will

IRM is a buy at $26 if they dip that low. I don't think they will to be honest, they don't really move that fast which is kind of nice actually

That‚Äôs it get more angry!!! MOREEEE
Thanks
Lets see where they open and price action today/tomorrow. I am pretty god damn sure the dip is going to get bought up. I am frothing to buy some shares, I really wish I didn't sell that put yesterday but it lowers my cost basis to like $252 which I am cool with

But if I don't get assigned then I am going to really regret not buying shares under $260
Assess the reason why it dropped. See if the selling stopped and it found some form of support. Buy 10k on margin since my cash position is low. :(

I've often seen BABA recover from -3% PM to EOD. There's still 11+ hours.
Buy leaps instead of shares, if it‚Äôs down - the leaps are up, if it‚Äôs up leaps are up more
BABA ain‚Äôt look good anymore. Should have known better than play with Chinese stocks.

I admire your commitment
Damn i almost wanna buy BABA cuz Jack Ma like fuck china and fuck Xi. Jack Ma for Prez!

Bad for the stock but I think the only chance to open up their economy is powerful people like Ma speaking up.

Bro, your forecast on BABA is super optimistic. To figure out the % gain of a stock it's (final price - Initial price) / initial price. ($300-$266.64)/$266.64 = 0.12, 0.12 x 100% = 12% your expecting to have a 12% return in 3 months? when the index gains 10% in a whole year! you bought a stock just to break even, that's not how investing suppose to work. If you did your research, what I would do is cost average it out. If were to buy 5x your current position at this price, you would be profitable at $272.2 instead of breaking even at $300. Here is the math. Initial position, 1 share of BABA at $300, increase the position by 5 shares at $266.64 = $1,333.20 now add them together to get the average. $300 + $1,333.20 = $1,633.20 (total position), $1.633.20/ 6 shares = $272.20 average price per share. This means that ($272.20-$266.64)/266.64 = 0.02 x 100% = 2%, stocks go up or down 1-3% every day. so you can be even by tomorrow and be profitable in very little time, or exit the position. The only issue is, if you bought 1000 shares of BABA at $300, your going to need to cover the deficit by 5000 shares, that's $1,500,000 a lot of capital up front. You could always borrow the difference, but if your position drops below 20% your going to have to cover or sell. and be even more fucked. for example lets say you need to cover 5% it would be $75,000. If you believe that you made the right decision I would just add to the position to average out the price.

#MARKET ROTATION BITCH
Jack Ma alreadt richer! He runs China!
Now you can triple down

I think NKLA should be up there
GME still hovering after decline. Opened a small position in Corsair before Earnings. Pretty solid, I guess you won the GME vs CRSR battle ;)
I came in the market with my savings (100k‚Ç¨) around 4 months ago. Great timing. Im only buying shares. The idea was to just invest in ETFs and keep 40% cash to buy more ETFs in case there is a crash. Im finding myself having invested 90k with only 14k of it being on broad market ETFs, 20ish k on sector ETFs (split evenly between green energy and big oil) and the rest on AAPL(100), AMD(100), NET(100), BABA(100), MAXR(20). Ive deviated so much from my plan that Im afraid what I might do next. 

Plus Im sitting all day looking at prices and WSB which was certainly not the fucking idea, especially while working.
I‚Äôm literally committed to downvoting everyone who says market rotation. All it it means is I found out about stocks 3 days ago
Stim check number 2? Shit well goodbye forever
SPY 420 is going to be such a special day
My curiosity has peaked. Gimme the down and dirty DD.
wow BABA actually going lower..

most likely will drop to 232
For those interested in China but not interested in reading or thinking: new draft anti-monopoly regs are a huge sell sign. You cannot get bigger or richer than Xi DaDa. Buy calls, but the top is wherever the bottom is...
Shes not coming back bro
Congratulations my friend!

Any company that tolerates yelling and other disrespectful behavior is cultivating a toxic culture. I've never been yelled at but I can imagine how awful that must feel. It's literally my worst nightmare as far as work is concerned. The kicker like you said is that it doesn't even solve anything amd makes everything worse.

how is AI or cloud or other tech gonna produce money? we do have efficiency tools like ms office, but i think we are already at apex. everyone is crying about robotics and automation but the savings it produces are miniscule, like when a robot was made to replace 3 masons. well in end it needed 2 masons + 0,3 service guy paid twice what the masons were paid ...

At some point Baba calls are a no brainer. But when...
It will create downward pressure for them for sure, but long term BABA will go back up. I am betting money on it, probably going in on $275c tomorrow if they flush at any point
Fisker, arriving in 2022... At least NIO and XPEV already make cars.

You're right. The calls that expire this week do not look good. Might add a few more 11/13 calls with even lower strikes to break-even.
I knew I should‚Äôve inverses wsb

Tech sector needs reality. reality are earnings. Google and FB live of advertisements and ads come from real economy. and real economy is burning. when that goes on for several quarters even FANG get hit. i read that non tech companies in S&P 500 are mostly red and only Tech keeps it in green.

who is gonna pay these hyped up tech companies as the end customer? other companies? cloud computing is such a hype term but its like 5+ years if not more and where is the money to come from?

show me the money, not your stock price. show me your actual earnings.

same with the AI. how does it translate to real world. what does AI do IRL applications aside of putting celebrity faces on porn star bodies? how do you make money in real economy from it? because the few government contracts are cute, but not something you can build next facebook of.

i might be not every innovative but i want to know how does tech hype translate to real world earning generation?

I‚Äôm the friend
Poor BABA. Literally keeps getting clapped due to China trade tensions but their earnings are always solid and they are a fucking powerhouse of a company. Stock is undervalued as hell at $260
Im ok now tho
Someone realized that stocks don‚Äôt only go up
I think BA will be back to its regular programming: Gap and fade
Only 0.01% of NIO sharehders are retail
Why is China fucking itself...
Damn, that's unfortunate. I agree though - I was hoping that China stocks would stabilize after Trump was booted but even China themselves is crazy

Can't catch a break - I sold a $260p for 11/20 yesterday at close which was stupid. Would have loved to sell that today.

To be honest they won't stay under $270 for long. IMO this is a decent time to go long on BABA. They are super undervalued now and they are going back up to $300 when things calm down a bit
Nio is a 250 dollar stock waiting to happen people just need to see the opportunity and buy in
I play DVAX and VBIV on the side, and they keep falling and falling. Three and a half months now. lol. u-g-h
oof

They took 250bn..? I heard that there was antiteust news but 250bn?? What do you mean they took 250bn off? You mean based on price decrease or they actually charged them 250bn?
Yes relieve rally then drill to fucking earth core
Very unlucky I sold a $BABA put just before CCP started going crazy. 

I will take assignment at 270 but as soon as I break even am out. 

Kinda tired of this CCP bullshit quite frankly. I'm done with China stocks, even $BABA looks like a penny stock now
And get fucked twice? Why not?

Hello, I am a JD call holder. Ask me about my stage 4 autism and lack of brain cells.
Trying to justify yourself. Nice!
Remember when BABA was at 300 and looking to go higher? That was cool.
Yeah this movement isn‚Äôt convincing
I have a gigantic penis and it chafes in my jeans. Very problematic and irritating.
Calls or stock?
I dont think that, the Chinese do.
Loaded up NVDA too as well. 2021 calls let's go!
HOW THE FUCK IS NETFLIX DOWN SMFH
no
Good company long run. Average down?
Nio will be green by open.
And just have like miraculous 20% recovery in the next 3 sessions? Lol
You know you can roughly estimate the pre market opening by looking at the Hang SENG Stock Exchange whether it rose or fell
I‚Äôm holding BABA. The antitrust took 250b off their valuation, sure whatever. They earnt 50b back already in singles day. Surely this is an overreaction? HOLD
Gayest of bears have been pounding tech stocks and riding the cyclicals because they expected bond yields to go up like a true bear.
For sure you dont take the loss. DCA or hold. At least thats what I tell mysef. I DCA‚Äôd. Now I have 100shares at 274‚Ç¨/share. But they keep falling... down to around 256$ atm.
Red by open
u/vredditdownloader
Calls I am debating if I should sell:

1/15 PFE 35.00 - was up >100% now more like 40%

11/20 HESM 17.50 - at break even

Let's be honest I'm not going to do shit with either and will probably lose everything.

Keep your money, clown. You‚Äôll need it after this NIO drop. 

The stock is up 90% this month alone. Somewhere in your brain you couldn‚Äôt comprehend some pullback and profit taking? 

Best $100 you never spent. Your welcome.
Nope
What ??? Can‚Äôt buy what?
TENCENT is a big shareholder. I'm sure they're taking profits after these autists got caught pants down buying weeklies. It will still keep climbing long term.
Went from last $120 to 1k on some mro calls. Thinking about yoloing that into llnw calls. My dd is I got both the stocks for free on robinhood so they must be good
Don't jynx it. Bought April 2021 calls on Tuesday's red
So you‚Äôve been buying for the last 3 weeks? Dear Lord.

You don‚Äôt know Biden do you? He‚Äôs a cyclical man because he likes the dividends. Holding the wave past Friday might be dangerous, but a few long calls might be fun to play with if you can find them in the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù range.
Keeps falling.
Calm your tits bois. Trading high vol tickers and having paper hands is not the strategy
It had crossed $40 again before dipping back down.
AMD is back BABY!
Can I transfer from Coinbase to Robinhood ?
Up 90% on the month alone. Suuuuper crazy to believe there is some pullback and profit taking, who would‚Äôve thought.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ain‚Äôt that a dude?
Yea that is why I never invest in Chinese companies. The CCP controls all the shit there, they let you exist or not. America at least pretends to be fair lol.
STFU! That's scary DD
‚ÄúAnti trust laws‚Äù in China? The whole point is for big corporations to run wild! Someone put a bullet in Pooh Bears head
Who do you think? Every autistic person here
80 percent of the market is institutional.  They drive the price up.  My guess is profit taking, relax.
I fell for the weed stocks meme :(
I felt so good buying at 265 lmao.
BABA is kill
NIO had support above $40 until yesterday morning and it's still bouncing off of $39. MMs are buying up shares under $40 once paper hand cucks have dumped weeklies early.
Chinese intelligence knows were actually getting 4 more years of mango
These guys thought Nio would keep growing at that rate
Shoulda took yesterday as a sign and got out of NIO üò≠
I plan on selling my zoom puts on Thursday or Friday and readjusting positions the next time it has 3 up days in a row. Good luck on that bag hold... everyone has an online conference call, and google is eating up zoom‚Äôs market.
Chinese dip that keeps on dipping? üò≠
DDOG üí©ing
BABA said aight imma head out
no average down?
BABA and JD need to stop being red by the EOD. Seriously. Not playing
That‚Äôs what happens to gay bears
Who in the right mind is buying ACB right now
Nio drilling? Whyyyy? 100 bucks to the best answer/DD
So... is xpev good?
Buying N!o dip
You did ta on it?
Come on JD don‚Äôt just roll over and die, FIGHT THE BEARS
Apparently not even 261$ was the bottom for BABA. Keeps tanking. Down to 258$ atm.
NIO CALL HOLDERS IN SHAMBELS. PUTTING ADS ON GRINDR TO SELL BLOWJOBS
yeah it says 39 u retard
Why is China fucking itself? Does it miss US tarifs drop so they tank themarket by themself?

Neo you were the chosen one :(
NIO got TAN'd by WSB lol
I‚Äôm willing to bet alot of money TSLA goes to 420 tomorrow
If Nio and xpev go down and fsr goes up that‚Äôs where the moneys going.
I bought BABA at 297 last week, now already down 5k, do i average down or take the loss?
Nio is dead for atleast a week chart is dicked
True. I believe in the future we might see it drop due to the fact that businesses and schools will open up. But, for now I think is a great buy because its still being used worldwide and on top of that earnings are at the end of the month.
It seems that everyone stopped using tech for 2 days and now we‚Äôre back in business, everyone‚Äôs back to buying on Amazon.
MAYBE THESE 800 18.5 NIO CALLS WILL PAY OFFü§î

Uhh wtf happened to NIO
Wow, BABA got fucking killed.

I sold 260p for next Friday but I really don't think they will stay that low until then...
Yes, sir.
Those both sound like things for you.
NIO drilling, great buy opportunity incoming.
Just like pornhub
Should i buy the dip on NIO?
NIO IS GOING TO $60 why not?
https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nio-stock
I think it'll go down under 6. And it'll take time to see that kind of gain again after biden is president

Just think of it this way. They multiply movement in the stock, but they're always decaying, so there needs to be a minimum amount of upward price movement, or they decrease in value, even if the stock is going up, but not fast enough.

When you get huge jumps in the stock, such as this morning, they make huge gains.
NIO is back above $40 let's goooooo
CRS maybe VRS if you can scalp a cheap long position(2yr).
Lol it would be hilarious if they got back and found out they were hella red from their shorts generating an even bigger squeeze.

The only good thing about it is macOS, which you can have on a windows computer. Besides, it‚Äôs just a cult that costs you upwards to $10k for a piece of aluminum.
You will get extreme answers, like Tesla does. Some will say it's still trading at multiples that are way too high. Then there's people like me who say Zoom isn't going anywhere anytime soon, so buy the big dip.
I guarantee that 99% of the retards screeching ‚ÄúBEARS R FUK‚Äù or ‚ÄúBULLS R FUK‚Äù have less than $500 in calls/puts

What‚Äôs that... Nio.... BACK ON RETARD STRENGTH
With Robinhood you have a margin account and you are restricted by pattern day trade. On Webull and other apps that let you use a cash account you can trade all the settled cash in the account that day with no limit on trades. I know the cash is settled next day with options so you can trade the next day with all your cash again
Gotta pay both the lawyers and the accountants at this level! Good thing it is real property. I'm going with a QOZ anyway for other reasons.

how is it -5% in europe when it only trades in the US
Alright homie don‚Äôt buy at the top didn‚Äôt work all summer all I‚Äôm saying
This market is in a total headfake mode. 

Its going to get worse before it gets better and 1 vaccine is not going to be the instant cure-all. 

Everyone "rotating" out of tech are just people fooling themselves that a change in president and the first vaccine to market will be immediate cures for covid. This is the mindgame, wishful thinking and people who don't understand the science behind controlling disease. 

We need multiple widely available vaccines including MRNA and lab made antibody treatments/therapeutics/ and widely available onsite rapid testing before we can really speed back to normal. With only a traditional styled vaccine we are looking at an extremely slow moving process that can possibly take the next 5 to 10 years to eradicate. 

TL;DR 

People are getting too excited and irrational wishful thinking is blinding reality
Imagine imagine...

Lol you‚Äôre working on ticks and playing against ratios and time decay, meanwhile degenerates on here are trading options where 1 ‚Äútick‚Äù would equate to $100+, possibly returning them 1000% earnings overnight with $10 risk. You talk like a currency trader that found a less risky way of losing their house. I can assure you options is better if you have a strategy behind your options. If you don‚Äôt have enough to get across pdt you probably shouldn‚Äôt trade stock or options rapidly and instead plan for specific events.

Not really, you are only referring to yelling during training. When you are not in training which is actually a lot of time, admin time, staff duties, office work etc, you can still have a superior yell at you over every minor shit. Its even worse as you have to just bend over and take it because of rank and chain of command. You can only repeat "yes sir" "sorry sir" over and over again like a bitch.

Might sell my NIO $35C 1/21 at open since those won't be as deep in the red as my weeklies then buy May leaps once we've hit the high $30s again. Have to diamond hand my weeklies though. Gonna open -80%.

Tell me your plays gayboy
Reminder that if daily gains are worthy of a screenshot it‚Äôs time to sell
My $45C is already down ~50%. Based on Euro market it's gonna dump hard but I think it at least closes the week above $42. MMs buying up shares below $40 for long term holds.

yes
If my plays work out this next couple weeks and I don‚Äôt blow up my account I might just have to yolo into that one next with the q4 merger
Might still make it back to $45 by EOW. I think MMs are trying to dump it below $40 to buy up a bunch of shares before ER on Tuesday. Rally Thursday/Friday, maybe a bit on Monday and then it's gonna dump after ER. I'm holding my calls at open since they're gonna be deep red anyway, should be able to at least recover some of it by midday Friday. Long terms calls are still safe and I'd buy leaps after earnings dump.
It's like pennies to a dollar. 1/100th of a call or put.

Its February 24th 2021 and due to the effectiveness of the Covid vacinne SPY just open up at $435. Everyone is tired of online shopping that AMZN dropped %15 of online sales making their stock drop down to $1921. In other good news NIO is now TSLA main competition in the Electric car industry and for this reason NIO stock is now valued at $105.

The shadow of my boner in the morning
yeah man, -10% correction in two days hopefully doesn't spiral this thing downhill. I got in first at 33 and sold at 180% but rolled out immediately, so probably gonna be down like 30% today, but that's alright if it still meets the growth expectations
I may cut my losses depending on where we open at.

I did the same thing. I also bought dominos, costco, nintendo, and tesla 1 stock each. Just holding on with no plans to sell yet unless they drop 10%
Ah so they were down 9% based on us being down yesterday?
Exam is 10am Friday so you better sell your puts by Friday‚Äôs close 

Btw power sucks, I got railed in that yesterday 

Oh ya back to studying brb

Oh oh u know what that‚Äôs means

Because they follow our market duhhhh
Call me a madman but it seems Europe isnt dumping anymore? Big boy tech isnt red atleast.

I don‚Äôt think another 10$ or so in 10 days is too hard to ask for ... especially if it makes me bank. Rather take my chances with this than try and hang on to rkt or nio haha
Look homie. You‚Äôre new to this shit. In the summer the Nasdaq and SP hit a record high every fucking day for 4 months. I‚Äôm not making this up. How do you think TSLA and AAPL and every other tech stock up 50-400% in 4 months

A bunch of calls and puts on two strikes, but the calls' volume and opening days are different than the puts. All four sets individually are losing compared to their openings on the 3rd. If they're all mostly one firm then they're down $1 mil on them unless it was some weird box spread in relation to warrants or shorts or something.

I don't have any special insight, but I think you'll probably be fine.  There might (and ought to be) some consolidation for a while, but my expectation is that the first weeks of each month continue to present sales growth that drives the share price higher.
You really have no clue how this works. Good luck to your calls though. There will be better options for healthcare providers.

See that's the thing, Tradovate pays for the majority of the contract because it is a Future Brokerage, its how they get people to trade on their platform. Most future brokers do. 

I also know how cool it is to get on a run of NQ and it go up $100 because that means 400 ticks at $5 per tick. Profit is $2000. Even then, I was only using NQ as an example for how they reduce the contracts price. I was trying to demonstrate how people could could SI to trade SIL and make a half decent profit while showing them what they could make.

price target has low of 44, avg of like 150, and high of 300 in the next year... so I guess... now we can say undervalued? *shrug*
Huh? You must be thinking of someone else.
Bruh, TD Ameritrade is the best. Got hit with pattern day trading and you just call to get it removed. The guy I talked to said they can remove a pattern day trading flagged account 3 times a year. Can‚Äôt really day trade cause I‚Äôm working but just made a few too many trades in one day lol. I was at $25k on Friday too :(

Cock time
How about this potential EV rotation, that has nothing to do with company value, as Tesla is obviously light years ahead of everyone, but everything to do with human psychology and the market. EVeryone knows about Tesla‚Äôs legendary gains, everyone sees nio and xpev going straight up, EVeryone saw NKLA epic pump and dump, EVeryone is chasing the EV dragon, money gonna rotate out of Tesla Nio and xpev and into FSR cause it‚Äôs the cheapest and everyone wants to get those huge EV gains. The meme potential for FSR is so extreme, it‚Äôs like glaring on my radar, also even though it seems like it‚Äôs up the last couple weeks, it wasn‚Äôt an ipo, it was a reverse merger and it‚Äôs actually still down about fourty percent from the high on the 6m chart, so even after going up 30 percent Monday it‚Äôs still down 40 percent from its ATH. BTFD retards, FSR meme stock no product no revenue just fomo Hype, XPEV doubles from November 2-6. FSR has room to run on pure meme fuel

You guys are so crazy. Take a deep breath and put down the adhd meds for a few weeks
In retrospect were they really overvalued in 2001? Probably not. It just took a while for the market to realize. Basically all the big companies who are still around are trading way higher than they were in 2001. Way, way higher. AMZN was $79 in 1999, and it's now 40X higher. AAPL was $1.17 (adjusted) in 1999 and now it's 100X higher.

It could be argued that the crash was a big, big overreaction for what are ultimately very successful, and at the time, way-undervalued companies.

If gaming consoles were about task performance other than gaming, people would just buy gaming PC and use controllers and still have a keyboard for office type work. It's not like a console with these capabilities is going to provide any sort of portability at this stage (you're not gonna carry a screen around with you even if you carried the console around in the car or something). Gaming consoles are for gaming. Being able to use Netflix, YouTube and such is a bonus.

No. It's two monkeys screaming at each other over two tin cans tied together with a string.

Suppose you need to commit an entry to a cloud-hosted database. Using a secure connection, a company like Microsoft sends the data across the internet. A zookeeper then gets a text message on their circa 1996 Nokia phone. The zookeeper takes an electric cattle prod to Monkey A. Monkey A screams in pain, sending the data across the string to Monkey B. The terror of hearing Monkey A's pain appalls Monkey B, who then develops an indelible memory of Monkey A's pain. This writes the data to long-term storage.

When you need to access the data, simply reverse the process by shocking Monkey B.

That's cloud computing.

This was they way they taught Sailors to jump from ships back in the day(maybe still do).  It's a LONG way down to the sea from the deck of a battleship or carrier.

Consoles should shift more towards multitasking to take on pc market, with current hardwares inside the consoles, people should be able to to use it for both gaming and some office works. Rumors are Xbox Series X will launch a windows mode. I still think a contraction in customer spending on expensive electronic will kick in once the fallout from pandemic hits the globe. I‚Äôm guessing Q3-Q4 next year will be bad, we should get a clearer idea by next summer. That‚Äôs why they should grab market share from other sectors especially with such capable devices
So remember last week? Green dildos on everything. I think this week might be the opposite and we back to Spy 325ish. What is wrong with this market.
good luck

Also did $shop and $w and it didn‚Äôt dip till later in the day which was fine because I was managing Zoom. All these stops trade very similarly usually. Threw in a $Tesla put for good measure too. My $pton puts didn‚Äôt print much with the dip. Sold a couple still holding those
That‚Äôs actually a surprisingly high return under the circumstances.  However, those lines are set based on the money being bet.  The morons that seem to think Trump won and will win are betting that he will win, which affects the line on a Biden win.  Essentially, you are taking free money from delusional Trump supporters.
Tell her you see advice on how to talk to girls on wsb.  When she finds out what wsb is she will be so impressed.
The quality of this sub has been in the shitter for at least the last 1.5 yrs. Memes are still good but any discussion thread or daily threads are bombarded by actual retards, boys, and shills.
Agreed.  My wife buys something from Amzn almost everyday. Music books, reeds, tp, clothes etc.  Her behavior has changed regardless of regular retailers.

Nope. Own stock...gasp

Lol what happened to futures?
Mangos powers are no more. The republican party are slowly trying to ignore or denounce his claims about a second term. World leaders are just waiting for him to be kicked out of the white house to actually do shit at this point.
Bought puts yesterday, Almost timed today perfectly, selling as Zoom zipped down to 265 covering a put almost every $10 drop in price to the bottom and made $8k. Bought some more after the dead cat bounce (this time further OTM) and covered one before close. Will do the same thing again tomorrow, or add a couple if it spikes up after the open which it may
Mid caps have so much more room to run. Still well below pre-covid highs. Could be good for buy and hold if you're in to that
so dramatic
Paypal at around 180 is a steal. Could go back 175 tho but will bounce back.
Someone tell me my $7,000 in ACB calls I went in on yesterday around $8.60 are going to be okay

The concept of death scares the shit out of me. Not only will it probably be excruciatingly painful, I get this feeling that I‚Äôm going to see some demonic/horrifying shit right before I die. Like, the scariest things you can conjure in your head, but you won‚Äôt be able to escape it because you‚Äôre, well, dying. And then maybe that‚Äôs hell? Just living the last few seconds of your life in some inescapable trip that feels like an eternity. An eternity of suffering.

Come to think of it, I almost bought 2 "brand new ORIGINAL" PS4 controllers from eBay a while back. I've mentioned in previous posts that I picked up a LOT of PS4 games recently as there are still titles I haven't had a chance to play. I wanted to buy 2 more controllers so my housemates could have a controller each. Well, they turned out to be fake so I didn't buy them. I couldn't find brand new original ones anywhere that I could trust, so I just didn't end up buying any. This was just a couple of months ago.
AYYYEEEEE. Fuxk da mods
Juul lawsuits will take every dollar Altria has . They acquired a large stake in Juul for 13 billion and that‚Äôs already been devalued to 1 billion. Courts aren‚Äôt playing around right now with children and highly addictive / illegal nicotine products, they‚Äôll make an example out of them. But this is long term put play.
Value-added services.

Do you even capitalism, bro?

Also, walled-garden ecosystem. Economies of scale. Regulatory capture.

For example, all customers have to accept an end-user agreement. This locks them into the MyAsshole app ecosystem. We then enslave many young people Epstein-style. And we pay the police to fuck off anytime someone makes it past the perimeter of our walled garden.

I got burned. I bought a 500c 11/20 on 10/21. Was betting this week to diamond hands and hold through to recoup. Decided it wasn‚Äôt a wise decision to hold. Bought a weekly OTM 345p 11/16. Made money off of that, but it was marginal compared to what I lost. At least I recouped 15% of my contact, as opposed to 7.2%

Waymo Lidar solution is much more expensive than Tesla. I also invested in KCAC for battery tech. Tesla is building an eco (solar, powerwall, auto) that is similar to apple. The battery tech is also useful for power plant scale energy storage that is gonna be huge with renewable energy trend

To think about your losses is to relieve that moment again. Just dust yourself back up and come back bigger. I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but I wish some one had told me this some time ago.
$550 for +1 /NQ or \~$234000 worth of notional? How's that possible when NQ can rip +/-100pts (+/-$2000) in a candle?

These guys who never traded futures would be liquidated just by random-walk movement based on volatility within minutes.

Seems fishy...

edit: OP's talking about $550 intraday margin, initial margin to hold a position through sessions is still $17,600 per +/- /NQ. good way for a beginner to get trapped in a losing position he/she can't cover. (/NQ just ripped down 100 pts then up 100+ pts during this exchange. ...beginner buttholes would be in shambles)

edit: apologies to OP, who seems like a cool guy. traded messages with him.

*"Last week, Canadian Weed provider ACB was a dying company headed towards bankruptcy until they received an unexpected boost from autist investors riding "WEED STONKS GO UP" bus after 4 more states in a different country legalized the use of the devil's lettuce during the 2020 US Presidential Elections. Mary Jane and her rotten crotch are still classified as a schedule 1 drug by the DEA on the federal level in the US, which makes exporting the excess Canadian dope surplus to these newly legal states very difficult.*

*The following week, ACB released their earnings after their stock rocketed, their earnings were a great disappointment. To no one's surprise after halving half their assets and liabilities and operating in the deficit over the past year. However, on receiving such positive news from the share price exploding for literally no fucking reason, ACB submitted plans to offer an additional $125M shares to the public to prop their dying business."*

**Tomorrow's headline:** Defying logic, ACB moons for no fucking reason.

You're pretty correct. Following immunisations the body should have memory cells which allows for rapid ramping up antibody levels, although we have a certain level of antibodies against a lot of things, more is better..

The concerns are two-fold, one is that this does not last long for covid-19, the other that changes in viral genome (resulting in a change of its proteins) means the antibodies do not bind effectively enough.
I dont understand how Tesla fanbois embrace this. Its the most bearish indicator there is, there is only a way down from here.

Going into the military and being yelled at is different. You're being trained to accomplish a mission that could be under conditions that breaking isn't an option. Outside of combat arms, yelling isn't a punishment common in the military. 

Level headed corrections and write ups should be the extent of punishment. Termination if you're that bad of an employee.

Can someone tell me why Tesla is not just a automotive company? FSD (Waymo already has a advanced FSD and google even released robo taxis). Energy (what energy? Solar? Nikola also sells solar lol and bunch of other companies). Battery üîã tech is something interesting as they are innovating in terms of reducing the cost and range. But how much is battery tech worth? Isn‚Äôt anyone else in this world also innovating in batteries? If they do not merge starlink with Tesla, I ain‚Äôt buying this Tesla shares anymore because it has already hit the ceiling
Explain for me too

It will be something's that analysts and retail investors will look at to see msft is getting a good return on the first investment in a very public oriented item. Great console sales will show that management is executing and if they are winning in the console wars then maybe they are winning elsewhere as well.

Investor sentiment has a strong influence on stock price.
Vix down stonks up
I mean BABA just reported record earnings a week ago, and made double what they expected for Singles Day. BABA should be at like $330 now at the least. Someone has their thumb on the scales to keep them down, and they have a reason for doing it
3rd time is the charm.
The $5P 11/20 (closest to $40 you mention) would require the stock to drop to its all time low at a time when debt is literally free. Btw in the scenario that it drops to its ATL by expiry, you get 136% return... not that great for a yolo. 

This is a terrible play.

Edit: I don‚Äôt care enough to look into it for an $8 stock, but if they were rated investment grade in February the fed will literally buy their debt.
More or less just wanted thoughts and discussion really
Indonesia is hella cheap right now this is prob the best time you can go. Month long Airbnb stays are like 60% off. 4 star hotels going for less than $50 a night. Air Asia has a $100 pass for unlimited trips (gotta give them 2 weeks notice for departure date tho).
I mean it was my first ever trade and on top of that I knew what I was doing with tsla except for trying to be a day trader.

The only thing making me not punch a wall after  buying BABA at $290 (11% of my portfolio in shares) is knowing my roommate bought BABA  at $291 and it‚Äôs 58% of his portfolio. At least I‚Äôm not the biggest loser in the apartment!

Decent buy long term, 
if vaccine test go through and we start mass producing, the travel industry will start rolling again and  FLT will have a strong market business and consumer wise due to the likely hood of governments putting heavy ristrictions on air travel and travel in general, which will create complications of booking a holiday or business trip. Making travel alot more annoying, this make travel agents more appealing for hassle free travel. 

I‚Äôd say give it 6-18 months and it‚Äôll be at around $30-40 mark in that scenario. 

Or, vaccine talks die down and it drops to $8-12 range. Which is another buying opportunity imo.

It‚Äôs just so frustrating because I always end up choosing the wrong things and buying not enough of the things that actually moon because I get scared I‚Äôll lose it all.

Sadly, I still haven't figured out how to convince my wife about the radicalness of puka shells, or the martial benefits from fantasies about her sisters.

Shit. So I‚Äôve never played it like this but I‚Äôm thinking about buying deep itm long dated calls and puts maybe a week or so before the er, regardless of news I‚Äôm pretty sure both will spike in Iv and will cash out before er on one leg depending on the vaccine news and let the favorable leg ride the er. What you think?  I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be losing any money because I‚Äôll buy them deep itm exact dates and strikes apart. I just want the Iv gain
yeah I promised to myself I would only trade while on shrooms once I became rich af, which is not in a long time

Yes, definitely that. Also you guys give terrible advice on this sub. Everyone was like amd amd and guess what it tanked lol
stocks have tanked after much better earnings than that
You can still day trade it as it moves in range it won‚Äôt do anything crazy when it finds its range but still money there. Also the good thing about zoom is that if you buy either calls or puts  far out doesn‚Äôt matter if it goes up or down the Iv will make you rich because of the amount of people that have their eyes on it. I might buy some itm long calls and puts and just cash out before er. Only playing them for Iv initially but if Pfizer news is to my liking I‚Äôll sell one and keep the other and ride the er

Calls on the next day arriving
I did too.  So GME could be poised to announce a share buyback and pay for a big chunk of it with options premium from selling puts and limit their risk on the price with calls.  Seems like they would really want to time this to coincide with ER? New console week?  Not sure what their timetable is.  Wonder if there are any hedge funds that really hate each other and they are waiting for max short bet to really screw them over?

This is a great read.

I see. So it limits your upside but is also less risky?
I think your right.  Not a lot of NEW money will come to the table short term.  But a lot of repositioning based on the fact that the very first vaccine that‚Äôs completed phase 2‚Äù3 trials has blown away expectations with 90% efficacy (reportedly).  Basically repositioning for ‚Äúpandemic will end at SOME point‚Äù.  Some will get dumped.

I don't plan to hold through earnings. I got the leap to avoid IV crush
Huh, thanks for looking that up. Learned something new.
[deleted]
This is the correct answer.
I don‚Äôt think it will give us the usual run up that it‚Äôs always displayed that‚Äôs for sure. It‚Äôll be more of flat as more news and shit comes out till then. It will trade in range I‚Äôm assuming so you could still make some plays off of it just day trades tho in and out. Wait till it finds the range. But definitely will be playing the er and I‚Äôm only going to buy depending on the news from Pfizer which comes out earlier. But in this market nothing is that simple, it might come out on the same day or after hours or a day after. Shit tends to be like this way too often lmfao

For sure, qqq needs to hit that 265-260 first. It definitely changes things for zoom as upwork is the largest work marketplace connecting businesses and  talents. Zoom might be here long after the pandemic ü§´ if the vaccine is even legit legit. Imagine when they announce next data and it‚Äôs bullshit. Zoom will fucking literally go to the actual moon this time and it‚Äôll be perfect timing because pfizer announces the next set of data before their er

Until then  I suspect a slow meltdown till vaccine has been confirmed confirmed
Sthu  bought tesla at 42$ pre split then sold it at 50$ exactly 1 day before it jumped 50% so me and my logic said that a company can't have changed 50% in 1 day so I didn't buy again.

Vaccine news will only continue to improve. PFE vax is the real deal ü¶†üî¨‚öóÔ∏èüß™üíâ. Lots of non tech has room to run. 

Tech will bounce. Pricing usually recovers when money flows away only due to sector rotation. 

Stimulus talks will start going well (eventually). At least dems will portray that they are.
Could be.  Since they are accountable to the shareholders they would want to announce the share buyback before exercising as it would drive up the value and could help reduce the cost of the buyback and increase shareholder value. I could see them writing Puts (free premium) and buying calls on their shares.

B. Public Disclosure Requirements
‚Ä¢ No rule of the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) or any national securities
exchange specifically requires a company to
disclose in advance its intention to buy back
shares of its own stock or to write puts or
purchase calls on such stock.5
‚Ä¢ However, a company undertaking a stock
repurchase program does have disclosure
obligations under SEC Rule 10b-5.6
 This is true
whether the stock repurchase program is
executed through open market purchases,
writing puts or a combination of these two
approaches. However, some of these disclosure
requirements can be avoided through the use of
the CBOE‚Äôs ‚ÄúEuropean-style‚Äù7
 Equity FLEX
(‚ÄúE-FLEX‚Äù) options.
‚Ä¢ Writing Puts. A company that writes American-
style listed puts on its stock must not be in posses-
sion of material non-public information at the time
it writes puts, and be prepared at all times to make
full disclosure of material non-public information
that comes into its possession while it maintains a
short position in such puts.8
‚Ä¢ Buying Calls. A company must not be in posses-
sion of material non-public information at the time
it buys calls on its stock. Long calls acquired by a
company, however, may be exercised at any time
regardless of whether, at the time of exercise, the
company is in possession of material non-public
information.9

Whilst 3 was probably possible under previous management, I don't believe it is under this team. Also, they have a LOT of cash. I don't think they need to pay upfront for new consoles and such. Payments are usually made on credit basis for stuff like this. GameStop make the sale, then pay their supplier once they receive the money. Plus they had over $700 million of cash so I don't think this redemption hurt their pockets as such.

That was 2.5 years ago. It was based on them overpaying for LatAm assets which every cannabis co did. How is it a shell when they do 150M revenue per Q and now will be 180M in the next reporting quarter. They lead Canada in market share yet they are a shell?
So gme could already have these call options and are waiting to execute them to automatically own those shares without it affecting the trend?

 GME liquidated inventory last quarter without replenishment, which makes sense ahead of the new console cycle. However, it is clear that they will need to use cash in order to replace inventory with the newer products that are about to release.

So why would they redeem a huge chunk ($125M) so early? It is a crucial time for liquidity.

This only leads me to 3 possible conclusions, and I'd like to know if you think I am missing something.

They decided to redeem $125M in SPITE of the fact that they clearly need to use cash to replenish inventory ahead of the new console cycle.

Therefore, management either 1) knows that that the current 3Q quarter will produce positive FCF, 2) extremely confident about 4Q numbers, or 3) are flaming idiots.

While 3) is possible, I'd like to think 1) or 2) is more reasonable here.

Here‚Äôs an example vid

https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/market-measures/episodes/option-decay-atm-vs-otm-07-29-2020

If you pick 45 days to expire, the large majority of the option‚Äôs value is lost by day 21. So if you don‚Äôt close it out, you‚Äôre essentially waiting another 21 days for 20% of the value when you could‚Äôve closed and resold 45 days out for 80% again during that time period. And you reduce the risk of your shares being called away

perhaps a lot more people are buying puts, which reduces put prices

it could also be the case that the upside is greater than the downside, and so calls are more expensive

I made the first mistake, I hopped in on MRO shares back in March and was selling CC‚Äôs on the way up. Doing it weekly. I can‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, but I picked a contract that was 15% higher, trump tweeted about shooting an Iranian boat, and it broke well through easily and I had 10k shares get assigned away

I lucked out in that 1) it was well above my buy in and 2) the following days gave me a good chance to re-enter without much pain

But after watching the tastytrade stuff there‚Äôs definitely an art to it. I stopped selling options but I‚Äôll have to go back and watch them before I start up again

250 is fukt?
Something about personal risk tolerance
‚ÄúThere are 495 other companies to bet on in the S&P 500. You don‚Äôt have to bet on the same five tech companies.‚Äù

WSB: ‚ÄúBut I only want to bet on these five.‚Äù
They said in the event it can game. Do they mean apple arcade games or actually some decent titles?
Goes to show how shit Intel chips are. This bad boy doubled the battery life of the pro model and this is apples first generation chip.
You‚Äôre already ahead of most traders on this sub by asking that very question.
still above 23/22.. not until vix is below 18-19
FACT CHECK: TRUE
Sir this is Wsb yolo or nothing
really?! WTF I should have never touched that
Goddam a whole 8.98%??! üíéüíé
final countdown on loop
Honestly it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. We find out some chemical in almost all plastic products slowly cause autism and retardation. Or the phones or radiation from nuke tests
Bet ill sell tomorrow or Thursday if I can recoup
Lol dumbass actually believed in Chinese stocks long term
What drugs are top 2?
FSR?
lots of competition here
How did you get in on the ipo?
Maybe
The money you have, how important is it to you? You can make a fuck ton on options gambling, but it is at best just educated gambling and at worse dumbasses buying otm weeklies on wsb hype.

If it's money you can afford to lose, go for it. But don't spend money gambling that you need.
hoping they tank tomorrow for my put tho lmao
What is SPY
Short match now!

I want to hate on you but I actually have had Chicken Express in Austin and it is delicious. Mix that spicy salt into the gravy and damn son.
Sure thing man.  Good luck.
Just like WSB
Honestly your best bet is to just play SPY, its 50/50 and somewhat more predictable than most others. Easily can turn $150-200 into $300-400 in a day and so on.
Im ready to ride the entire fucking pump down
I realized that but I‚Äôm a retard so I thought no one would notice the fuck up

Lol not sure where your getting your info from, this shit is going strait to scotus. Stop listening to cnn
the conversion is HKD to USD and then multiply it by 8 because baba split 8:1 in china in july
Maybe not fair cause I just had it so I got a few months of immunity but I would not want to be the first to take a possibly rushed vaccine
Don't worry, 3AM EST is usually the honorary time that the "Europoors" start dumping. Hopefully we get a SPY and tech dump tmrw just to cool things off!
It's pathetic how he's blatantly trying to copy his dad's physical mannerisms.

Breaking News: Everyone is retarded
Darn. Wish I could‚Äôve gotten into stocks back then. I‚Äôve recently been really enthusiastic to learn and invest. Thanks for your answer.
I saw someone had a overall account with 180 million and a available balance of 10 bucks I‚Äôd simply off myself.
In mid-October, Sanford Bernstein's Max Warburton¬†put forward one explanation: Porsche could be buying cash-settled options on Volkswagen's stock, which ‚Äî as the stock is only owned once the option is settled ‚Äî would allow it to accumulate a large stake without disclosing it to the market.
Something about a new China law is all I know
üåàüêª think they‚Äôre so smart selling tops and buying dips.. WHAT WERE YOU DOING MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER. Besides sucking a big bull dick every morning for 6 months straight. Never forget it. Every put you take out after a pop.. remember. I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER üëª
So if Baba is at $252 in HK...that‚Äôs what, $259 USD? Sorry I forget how to convert
Tech > fund: from a guy who may or may not work at a fund
Then your doing good how much have you lost
I feel like the tech dip is me being baited to sell
I wish I had documented my observations over time from them on Rite Aid. A true cult, one to rival Tesla
They were right tho
No
Have you been living under a rock
If you can buy 30 options 2 weeks away just buy 10 options 3 months away. Stop thinking you can time the market and give your theses a chance.

Or not, I mean I sell you your fd's I'm fine collecting
Lol. Wsb should not play MSFT.
Shit I must have a Master in autism them
It was extremely impressive for a ER I  have absolutely no idea what I‚Äôm doing
Thought about selling today but ultimately held on.  I see no bottom for that shit company esp since it uses every bump in the stock price to fuck their own shareholders (sell shares).

I took it but it always shows that to let me know if i invite a friend snd they invest i can get more free stock

Look at BABA on NYSE and on HK 9988. Compare charts and see the difference. That will be tomorrow's opening point approximately
People in this sub have committed sudoko and others own Lamborghini‚Äôs, if you can live with either of those outcomes, sure.
Isn‚Äôt the stock market closed tomorrow?
Ahh gotcha
Yeah, sure. Not the butt plug.
Its good to take profits gang.

Yeah the RSI is overbought on the 3 month chart at this point. It could keep running though. Negative catalyst that might slow it down is the vaccine but it's not clear when that will roll out entirely. So it the meantime analysts are still rating $COVID a strong buy.
Tech is forever fam dont trip on a oversold dip
yen? What is that in dollarydoos?
Alot of banks are near their precovid historic levels too. JPM, BAC... I guess the next 2 or 3 years are baked into their valuations now.
He meant from earlier today
Lol... idk about NIO (haven‚Äôt researched) but XPeng (so probably the other Chinese EV‚Äôs) is audited by PwC China which isn‚Äôt peer reviewed by its Western counterpart, nor is it subject to PCAOB oversight. PwC China is as real as any other company in China. Luckin coffee, anyone? (auditor = EY China)
Why is no one talking about MINK? Let‚Äôs get this new virus going üöÄ
Story checks out
They don‚Äôt have a case to take to scotus.  Multiple states have already dismissed their cases due to no evidence and Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected their appeal.  They‚Äôre running the risk of becoming liable for frivolous lawsuits at this point.
You are already scared. It‚Äôs your worst fear. And there is nothing you can do about it. Your mental sanity will snap and there will be no return.
I‚Äôm up big on CRSR. It‚Äôs a volatile stock and little scary sometimes but it‚Äôs headed in right direction
That‚Äôs not how the maths work if it doesn‚Äôt reach that 25% it fades away aka theta

my buddy been cash gang since 2010.
I'll use all of tendies to stoke the fire.
Do you think this is the top? Since earnings are on the 18th
Thanks for the explanation! I have seen somewhere when it first started to become a meme that Michael Burry bought in, not sure how that is relevant, assuming he is a godly figure in the industry? Either way cant seem to justify just because of some dude, unless he is able to move the market or have some serious connection to turn it around, right now i feel like it‚Äôs just a dying gaming retail store, like many other retail stores.
Still better doeee

One bad news headline and this thing would flush down the toilet. Its going up cautiously
You're right, you're right. So it would seem to be regarding just their annual 10-K as their fiscal year is the same as calandar. No clue when they'd actually release it, though.
i hope you bought it when MSFT was below 215
Political bs but I was mostly going for quit being a bitch.  Got suspended for 2 weeks in highschool for something similar.
Hardly better
üôèüèΩ I hope!, but we aren‚Äôt down?
This is actually a legitimate reason for why options exist.  Sometimes when information becomes public it will move the price and if you couldn't lock that price you would be stuck paying market prices.. I believe Porsche used options to acquire a bunch of the share of VW.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSTRE49R3I920081028

Porsche's statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world's third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.
This reminds me of the time I went all in on SPY puts when SPY was at 220

Since the beginning of the year, Amazon has risen 70%. This is not its peak though, which was at 86% above the start of the year. Hence we're down from the peak, but still up for the year as a whole.
SNE
No idea, but that seems like a good situation to sell covered calls
It's called mean reversion. Lol.

It's hard to understand how all of these retards didn't understand this.

Sell to triple down
yelling doesnt work. all he/she had to do was say you fucked up. you should of bought calls on Nio.
Yea back to $18 for awhile

I was banned from world news, threatened a ban site wide.  I told the mods I had there moms "insert nasty shit" and I would have to get back to them, in the mean time, "insert additional nasty shit".  I'm still banned from world news.
The right time was 6 months ago my friend
Bro, I've been waiting on the sidelines for like 2 years. I STILL can't find any deals. Hoping the foreclosures hit by next Spring.

Massive EV push is definitely happening

China has to go that way because it imports so much energy that it's economy is fucked if they don't.
Fuck America, I need to follow Jimmy "Warren" Buffett's lead and invest in Japan. So what's the Japanese equivalent of AAPL?
Hoping my MSFT 215 hits tomorrow
Definitely. Pump and dump
but it has nothing to do with IPO. This is an established product.
I believe in all of you and your capabilities of being successful gambling in the stock market

Cliff is full of money. See you on the other side.

Prob won't be making that much major moves imo. Too much shares float and investors are categorizing them as a bank so it basically moves like a bank stock.
LMAO. I used some of my FSLY gains to buy a Nintendo switch and I‚Äôve been loving this game. It‚Äôs a fucking masterpiece.
You really rotated out of value at the right time. I have 200 shares of BABA with covered calls. MSFT gaped me today.
Man fuck theta gang. All my homies hate theta gang.
I‚Äôm not sure SPY calls will print though... I‚Äôm praying for you! I think a JD earnings yolo could work, especially at these depressed prices. But I just lost a lot of RKT calls, so wouldn‚Äôt recommend listening to me
yeah it'll be huge. you can't throw a rock without knocking out some little kid who has stolen their parents' credit card to buy roblox shit. I bet a decent population of this sub plays roblox, tbh.

One of my favorite pastimes is looking at the comment sections for stocks on webull and judging how autistic they are compared to all of us here. 
Conclusion: We know it. They‚Äôre in denial
Oh shit are they actually IPOing???
Like a fun and sexy dance üíÉ
Approx 80k a year starting
Webull is way better , so many charts im only back on robinhood to burn through the day trades lol plus the instant fubds addition helped me move on what I wanted to do webull would have made me wait for funds to fully settle.
He‚Äôs not wrong.
I was told HYLN will moon this week, but my calls are down 50% now. FML
Or just get a sous vide and never have dry chicken again.
[deleted]
No surprise
That's probably gonna happen because of the stock buyback they are doing. Rkt gonna liftoff
I'll take that for the quarterlies but even next week demands some serious cheese on the call side. It's like the options are saying the 10% drop today was a mistake
Rotation from rotation to rotation
Lol they didn‚Äôt stop in 1999

I mean for what it‚Äôs worth ER is up a lot but ofc this market dumps that shit
Not significant but a couple put sells and a small long position 12/4 20c

Bull case - we‚Äôre about to be bombarded daily with vaccine developments and in the middle of all that there will be a stimulus even if its small

Bull case - inflation

The largest margin a recount was ever adjusted was the hanging chad debacle in 2000 and it was like 1200 votes.  Trumps down millions of votes and 10s of thousands in key battleground states.  Please just stop with this fraud shit.

Hey. Lurker here. Someone wanna tell me a bit more what this specifically means?
Wtf is APPL?
Because profits don‚Äôt come with increased notoriety and traction right? Every company just magically starts off profitable? Tesla wasn‚Äôt inches away from bankruptcy? Got it
Got a weird feeling Thursday will be another pump, but that‚Äôs cause my calls expire tomorrow

euhm, nah bro, its quite the opposite, deflation is coming. There's decreasing demand and there's decreasing lending growth lol. Why would they be doing QE if they thought inflation was coming.

Alright boys, listen up. If you aren‚Äôt marinating your chicken at least three hours before cooking, you‚Äôre fuckin up. 

You don‚Äôt want to be the guy at the office who blew it with Big Booty Judy cause your chicken was lookin drier than my wallet after ladies night, so follow these recipes. 

For a simple honey mustard marinade, combine
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup dijon mustard
1/4 cup honey
1/4 cup olive oil

Pop that saucy minx in a bag with some chicken thighs and BOOM, you just bought a one way ticket to poundtown, first class.

Your girl don‚Äôt like sweet shit? That‚Äôs all good, she sweet enough as it is. Just throw some chicken breasts in a bag with some pesto. You won‚Äôt have to worry about what to do for those three hours because just the sight of you not being a fuckin idiot for once is gonna have that sweet girl finger-poppin your asshole quicker than you can find the lube. 

It‚Äôs so easy people, marinate yo shit. Do it for the children
I like your funny words magic man!

How the fuck could u lose money on the shitty green week so far.
Bruh, $PSTH and $APHA.. Frankly, what the fuck is this meme stock $ACB? 

&#x200B;

$APHA has the fundamentals to support the valuation. Fair value is $11. Shits stuck at $5.50. Come on boys, tendie train!!!
3480 is my line in sand signaling 3300 3200 is on the table. 3510 held so far confirming breakout above downward trend line for now. Making new ath is bullish. Long term trend is upward. Just giving counter arguments I thi nk  fundamentally it's worth maybe 1800 to 2300 lol. Shorting up here is good risk to reward ratio but it could keep grinding up
It‚Äôs an easy game, Tesla drops below 420, but calls, it goes over 420, sell. Wait for it to drop below 420 and buy again. Rinse and repeat.
Diamond hands baby

Well. Let‚Äôs take a simple example here. Let‚Äôs say you make $500k/year (top 1% of earners in the USA), that‚Äôs ~$280k net after 401k contribution and with an effective tax rate of 40%. Then you subtract the lifestyle (you live in NYC) that leaves you with ~$20-100k (depends on if you have kids or not). So it‚Äôll take 5-10 years (at that salary!) to save $250k. And you will put all of it in GME. Now you‚Äôre telling me that‚Äôs not a lot of money?

I am so happy this sub has been wiped out and that many of you lost most of your money.

how do I download this
Its going to take him months of real world experience to do it.

Then he will get punched in the dick when he sells a close to the money call and the stock jumps 15% in a day and he sees all those gain he could have got but settled for $72 instead.

He will also sell a call, it will drop to half its value and will not buy it back hoping to squeeze out another 25%.

I could have made those mistakes (but didn't).
thanks for the reminder
That‚Äôs a little too bearish for my liking

This is so stupid. Your entire thesis is based off a made up contract price - never in the history of man would a $1 call for a stock trading at $9 cost $700. As others have said, the drop would actually increase implied volatility and likely give it more extrinsic value than when you sold it so it would be closer to $850 than $700. This whole thing is retarded and basically equates to the same thing as waiting for a lower entry point to buy a stock.
EOW price prediction for NIO?

Should have known RKT would beat earnings, have good forward guidance, announce a buyback

It‚Äôs a fair point. God damn minimum wage is such a cock punch. I‚Äôm really fortunate, I can‚Äôt imagine living off that kind of income.
Yes. You'd probably get more like $100 because the spread for that strike is $100/108, but you could possibly get filled at the mid.
Where?
bleach
No they put their vids on YouTube for free and also on their website. I‚Äôm on mobile but they shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find. Off the top of my head, I think selling calls or puts with 25-30 delta and 30 days out was the best option. Essentially decays to half value the best with the least risk. So you sell 30 days out, when it hits half you buy back and repeat. Also gives ample time to roll. It‚Äôs been a while but it‚Äôs definitely worth trying to find.
Doesn‚Äôt matter mango has no allies in court and even most mango voters agree he doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. Bye dumb dumb mango

Plus, their retail options are way too expensive compared to even premium animal meat. They need to drop their idea of going non-GMO and non-soy. Most Asians don't have GMO or soy allergy or SJWism or Veganism. They need to learn from Uncle roger videos.

Yes, but what you and I are discussing is based on the balance sheet at the end of last quarter (which btw doesn't include the expected leasebacks).

The bullish point is that they decided to redeem $125M *in spite* of the fact that they clearly need to use cash to replenish inventory ahead of the new console cycle. 

Therefore, management either 1) knows that that the current 3Q quarter will produce positive FCF, 2) extremely confident about 4Q numbers, or 3) are flaming idiots. 

While 3) is possible, I'd like to think 1) or 2) is more reasonable here.

Your thoughts going forward to the end of the year? Are we all holding the biggest fking bag for a while? Or do you think this is just a moment of weakness and the stock will bounce back?

For real.
So it'll 99% tank after earnings to 10-12, climb back up a bit, but then I believe the rest of the insider shares are unlocked Sometime around the New Year I believe, and it'll probably tank again. Have to find the exact date for when the rest of their shares are unlocked, but if it's definitive there's an incredibly easy timeline for the next couple months with how to play it with options. This is all barring COVID market fuckery which is sure to happen

NTES bullish for earnings
I still check them every 10 minutes, idk why because it seems like there is zero correlation between futures and the next days trend lol. Except for insane days like Monday.

The dip got bought, the fomo is real (for now)
Stonks go up, bears go down
Agree on the current assets - AR, inventory, etc, although to be fair I didn‚Äôt include current liabilities (other than debt). 

Exactly my point on inventory replenishment - they are going to be using cash to replenish inventory heading into the new console cycle, so there isn‚Äôt quite as large of a cash cushion as ppl think

Stop lying.  You're just a sales man cold calling peoples.  

&#x200B;

YOU AIN'T LOW, WE SEE YOUS.
(1) If you're going to include leases in the debt calculation, you might as well include other current assets (e.g. inventory with a haircut). Otherwise it's somewhat misleading imo

(2) It makes sense for them to decrease inventory ahead of the console cycle. I would expect them to instead deploy the cash to replenish inventory with the newer stuff that's about to be released. Which is why I am somewhat surprised that they decided to redeem $125M so early.

I'm never a perma-bear, I always try to ride the trend, and it sucks, but EVERY time SPY goes on this parabolic gap up for 4 days it always gets retraced before taking off again.

Their subsidiary chain is a little asinine but they check out, based on their secondary offering prospectus.

Sounds weird to us Americans, but China does that when the state offers loans and grants to domestic producers.

Lots of new gamblers it seems - nio p
Yes it is, and when it rains all the equipment needs to be replaced, that's why tech companies are making so much money
i'm doing the same thing, here were my thoughts :

1. corona cases are raising higher then ever, winter was predicted to be worst for the spread, peoples carelessness and the holiday season will jump it more, we will have a spike which sends a scare back into tech, if thats reasonable or not, longer term is irrelavent, there will be a option for a exit point soon in tech if you bought now regardless.
2. vaccine if truly effective and safe is months out, weeks to actually give to people once product is recieved, probably will be preferred if those older more susceptible first, it would be dumb to spread it knowingly when theres a vaccine so the working class/age range will still be requested to quarantine and such until everyone gets the vaccine, at least a few more weeks, figure a month just to give it out after several months of making it. mid spring-early summer at the earliest. anything tech heavy you can get in and probably exit out safe by then.
3. many companies have made remote work arrangements for another year, those arrangements are in place, its too costly to change, and there finding it better for themselves anyway, many of these tech companies will stay in similar working capacity (zoom) they will forever have some use in business, with meetings you always want to tie in people in other locations. little change to those businesses but some.
4. some of the tech sell off stocks are dumb. what no one is going to use facebook after this is over? thats the perfect tool to know where are my friends at tonight i been in for a year time to go out, whos having 1$ pints tonight, wheres a band playing etc. its used just as much as it always has been, pre pandemic (the growth was the amount of growth it was seeing quarter to quarter pre pandemic it seen during the pandemic, for many of these companys same) absolutely no change to social media at least, physical hardware similar, apple definitely this wont effect, in fact a stock like that is peoples image they have to get the new one once they go back out and are seen in public.

im hitting the big red button on tech guys (hits big red button) "BUYBUYBUY"
Big news tonight on production numbers in China for the month of October. I‚Äôm sure there will be a pop before market open and then another slow bleed all day.

Ok Ned.
It'll move in all the right ways to lose you money. I've been buried by another thread, so I'm moving discussion here.
Well thank you! Just hope to help someone getting into options to understand them as fast as possible to minimize mistakes! I ended up buying only 100 shares of WTRH, glad I didn't buy calls! 

An example of just how much and quickly options prices can move, as well as a RARE success for me:

https://imgur.com/a/Mg1x4TZ

Summing up, I bought 4 options at 0.14 each friday DEFINITELY not knowing about vaccine news. They opened and went to 4.10 in seconds on Monday. I literally held for like 10 minutes and the stock went from 43 to 41 by 9:45 or something and the contracts were only worth 2.20 ea.

 If I just sold at the top a few minutes earlier I would've made another grand ü•¥ As you can see, selling at open is often the best idea. You can see I am still holding 1 of those just in case UAL jumps again, but I wish i sold all at open mon. Good luck!

I‚Äôm hella sad I only bought 20 at $175 because I told myself to average in like a smart boy. Now it‚Äôs way too high for me to add more so I guess I‚Äôm just waiting. Sad.

Cvx calls were expensive and did not net x10-20 like XOM calls did. Percentages matter and gang was the best play(something I was in on as well).  My investment strategy is Cramer‚Äôs from 12 years ago. ‚ÄúInvest in the most depressed among strong industries that won‚Äôt go away.‚Äù Oil, and paper manufacturing(because of jobs) were the industries I chose, and I went with XOM, FANG(diamondback), VRS and CRS. Lmk what you think of my charts. Btw plug was another one of my biffs. I lost 50k on $14 puts on that one. I‚Äôll admit I was wrong, but I love betting against Cramer.
I do not know a single person who would put $250k in one single stock with that level of risk (btw I work on Wall St). HFs did their DD and shorted the stock. Why? Perhaps you could enlighten us with your super DD? Let me guess... Are you one of those new day traders who downloaded Robinhood back in April and does not know what a 10k is? Who would bet their family on one single stock hoping it would go 10x up to free them from their misery.
Lmao

yeah, i see your point. they will make a bunch of money from those things happening, but they have already made a shit ton of money from covid and people not being able to go out. So, when people do go out, they will lose that revenue boost that they got from covid, so overall, it's still gonna be in a downtrend

That is correct, they could chose the timing to announce any buybacks. The latest they could delay the announcement would be until their Q3 earnings 10-Q issued in January.

It‚Äôs all a matter of opinion I suppose. That‚Äôs what makes a market. I see it more as a secular trend that isn‚Äôt going to dissipate because COVID is gone. I also think the shift to Warzone and in game monetization will be massively more profitable than just a single COD release every year. Not betting my whole folio on it, but not running away from it either.

I could see a dip back to 2900, 2800 max at some point, but you'll probably be OK. I have March $3000 I'm down on and some other leaps out to 2022.
When NIO went from 20-25 that first time I had like 250 contracts at 22. It costed me 20k to buy those but NIO was the same price for 10 days straight and theta killed my options making them almost worthless. Luckily JP Morgan came through with the price upgrade

China cracking down on big tech.

Look up their most recent anti-trust policies.

For BABA, its ANT IPO was suspended.
A hot girl and she‚Äôs either good or bad
Silly, it's because you need to sell, not excel. Microsoft is not the way.
poots r regular hours only
No shit
Hooooooooowwwwwwwww
10 year mooning ‚úîÔ∏è

covid predicted to be over in next 6 months as per fauci april wide availability ‚úîÔ∏è
tech and all other stocks can move together ‚úîÔ∏è
shut downs occuring ‚úîÔ∏è
Reminder that energy stonks gonna go up at 10:30 am tomorrow
might wanna wait til January to pickup stocks. there's a lot of room for corrections until president is sworn in.  if you wanna just buy stock I'd recommend going all in on MFA, it's cheap and it will collect small dividend, and it should keep moving up from $3.30 to $4.50 a share in the near term.  

high risk like you asked for would be all in on zoom $500 calls expiring january


you kinda need to tell us your cash flow that you want to use.
It isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs currently around 260ish hk (250ish hk is around 250 us after you multiple bh 8 shares).

They‚Äôre also behind, closing yday at 285 not like us
A 35 day ban ? That's the longest I've seen
You are actually retarded. They can become profitable anytime they fucking want, they stop investing money into R&D, stop expansion, stop hiring, increase spending on marketing instead of engineering. Instant profit. Look at what happened to Intel, because this is the recipe Intel followed. As long as their revenue grow year over year, profit is retarded.
Open a Roth at Vanguard or similar and buy ETFs.
Ban.
My man
Lol I tried that bro, she fell asleep
Omg the cars are burning to the ground merry go round safe an sound I might pound lost and found

Nah, big cap tech are real businesses that make real money. Microsoft, Facebook, and Google haven't even seen that much multiple expansion this year.
Not enough to offset my tech losses of the last two days. Lol
TLDR; SPCE January or April 21 OTM Calls

8 out of 9 analysts rate SPCE a buy. It was an unheard of 8 out of 8 until Goldman Sachs decided to rate it neutral, in late October and ruin the party. Odd timing right?

SPCE is the second most shorted stock on the Street (after GME) and shorts are currently paying 9% interest to maintain their positions. 

This is building up to what will invariably be a short squeeze of biblical proportions as SPCE will be making history in literally 10 days! This 3rd successful powered flight will likely seal the deal for their FAA COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE! This will also be the first human space flight in the history of New Mexico!

The 52 week high was 42 dollars! Market cap is still under 5 billion!

P.S. Everyone‚Äôs favorite GILF, Cathie Wood and ARK (TSLA and SQ artists) own nearly 700,000 shares. They‚Äôve been acquiring shares at a prodigious pace! Nearly 200,000 shares since the Goldman Sachs hit piece.

Please do your own due diligence and keep in mind that I have a significant sum invested in SPCE shares. Godspeed!
What makes you say this?

The only thing that changed was you came back with a gay flair.
My dad and I were arguing on if FB or BABA was better for long term growth in the Spring. I bought FB and he bought BABA both at $200. He was kicking my ass for a while but now I"m winning lol. What exactly happened to BABA?
So pissed I keep losing money and yet I keep telling Myself I will stop. So far down 20k....
My $500 underdog bet on Trump winning the election is still ‚Äòpending‚Äô. 

So you‚Äôre sayin there‚Äôs a chance?
He gonna realize that when he is no longer prez he won't be able to get away with this dumb shit and everyone close to him will probably leave
10 year is already priced in seeing the valuation of tech stocks. I would say 20 years from now..lol

Are we having a repeat of early June?
(4/3)œÄr3 allows us to calculate the size of his balls. Using the r as the same variable it allows us to calculate the size of his brain with ((4/3)œÄr3)/4
Looool
You belong here, but don‚Äôt ask this here
Yup your at the roulette table and the ball just spins til 9:30am... but pre market starts at 4 am and more active stocks might have movement then
Something about a dog too or boots
Don't settle for that.  Odds are, if she raised a girl to have low enough standards to date you, she hop on the old mooneaze train herself!  Go for it.

Ok I apologize don‚Äôt know how that happened
They immediately ban all outsiders who question the company.

Dirt roads, jean shorts, beer and blue collard people thinking white collard people are the antichrist
But can you predict what happens after lockup dilution?
How to succeed at anything in life: invest in things that no one is talking about YET.

This place is equivalent to all the wannabe entrepreneurs who start a business doing what the real entrepreneurs were doing a year ago and wonder why they fail. Most people just lack the creativity to be successful.

Eh, the DD seemed decent at first..... but did you know they approved a reverse split that could happen anytime in the next year?

What do they mean by co-created? do they get any money from it?
No she has no social media. She is a supervisor for a medical clinic and that‚Äôs all she ever thinks about
I used to work for BF acquisitions. They then sold it for like 12 million to its current owner some big outfit in Arizona that owns a lot of other franchise chains
Jesus is that doesn't bring back some memories. I feel ya totally. MDMA is my BAE right after weed/hemp. Both have done amazing things for me and also nearly screwed me in my early teens. I remember dancing at WestLake mall in Seattle to protest the rave act back in the day. Met infected mushroom and saw them live during that whole shindig of a weekend. What a time!
how‚Äôd you go from 3k to 67k?
TXRH ?
No actually today.
No one talking about BUD?
Same getting smashed in HK
Lol good point
I got both. And at one point today they both where going up lol
It's more about there being a finite amount of money and the relative value of assets than it is about people thinking we no longer need tech.

Reopen trade is hot, people are selling or trimming their tech stocks to buy battered reopen stocks.
Problem is everything is tech nowadays. Even TGT and WMT which are glorified grocery stores
I‚Äôm convinced there are no longer autists, only retardos.
Can you elaborate?
Meh it's gonna bit 50 last hour of trading Friday after RH forces me to sell my 50c's

Doesn‚Äôt JD.com stand to gain market share from this?
anyone know what happened to the 100k PLTR FD yolo guy?
They had PT upgrades, Beijing agreed a deal to buy government vehicles from them, Chinas new 5 year economic plan details a very aggressive transition to EVs, October vehicle deliveries up nearly 150% from last year, and they unveiled the 100 kwh battery.

Texh is fuk
And she really likes tiktok? I‚Äôm seeing a shift towards older women using it
The ghost pepper chicken sammich an Fries from Wendy‚Äôs were awesome. Why the fuck did they take that off the menu? By far better than any other crap they have.
This is the way.
Bought back my AAPL 122C 11/13 for 80% profit and rolled them over to a 119 strike this morning when we rallied for a bit. Selling weekly OTM calls is the fucking way.
lol, it's not dumb if you look at the history of price point for BABA.  it typically dumps once or twice a year.  this year it broke record highs and kept climbing without any dip since March... yuh dumb dumb
