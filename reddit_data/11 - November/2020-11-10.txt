What’s the context? What happened to Merck?
to everyone who makes this argument: the tech companies haven't gone bankrupt or anything. It's a correction. it was expected. most of them are still up over a 100% this year and many of them are just ridiculously valued still. So, when there's a hint about lives going back to normal, reality hits and people start being reasonable. why would you wanna buy Zoom at 600, Twillio at 350, Wayfair at 350, etc if you know the boomer stocks, now that most of their chances of going bankrupt has diminised massively cause of the vaccine, have massive upside potential and big money to be made there?
Nah fam. I'm not 15 anymore
This may be a retarded question, but do individual stocks continue trading all night, similar to futures?

Specifically, I bought a fuck ton of $4 puts on ACB, and would like to check it every five minutes to see if it is continuing to bomb. Is that possible, or is it just the AH window and Pre-market?

Still got some March call buys but I almost prefer assignment on my put sells still

My wetdream for a short squeeze would be if they did an unannounced buyback first and immediately released news of a partnership agreement with Sony the day before the ps5 launch. That would be a squeeze of epic proportions. One can only dream though.

« It’s only half a mill ». 

Not impossible but putting $250k in one of the most shorted stocks is stupid (i.e. there is a reason why many people short the stock - very high risk) except if he’s worth $100mm+, which I doubt.
Let's say you're at an auction trying to buy a vehicle. Theres a couple Corvettes and a few 1980s station wagons. Obviously you want to buy a Corvette but you're late to the auction. The corvettes started off at 50k. The station wagons were selling for 8k. By the time you get there the corvettes are going for 3 million and the station wagons are going for $100. That's basically where we're at with tech. Obviously its superior but theres a limit. Buy a few station wagons, sell them for a profit, and wait for corvettes price to become reasonable again.
ACB apparently going the homeopathic route with their shares

Today was wild. Tech fucking drilling nonstop the first hour. I can’t believe I sold my NVDA puts right at open. I bought them at 580, but damn, them mfers were worth 5k more EOD. 3 fucking contracts I bought for 0.70.

Dow somehow ended up 1% even after briefly turning red from that drill. Tech can bring down the whole damn market lol.

Something to do with some faulty battery terminals. The timing is turbo horrible
Ok and the expense ratios are pretty small though right? Like for example. The SPDR S&P 500 has gone up 68% in the last 5 years. So if I were to every month invest x amount of dollars into SPY it will grow not 68% because it’s invested over time but somewhere close. Let’s just say 60% growth overall. The expense ratio would take a percent for example I’ve invested 1000, now it’s 1600 but to me because of the expense ratio it’s gonna be like 1550 or 1500 or something?
Respects
It’s still not a good look, combined with the Mango wildcard, and there will likely be some crazy shit going down before Jan 20
Stocks are like “The Bachelor” but for dudes
>The contract holds the tax potential if you are selling 366+ days left there is a premium associated with it

From [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/leap-option-held-more-than-12-months-tax-treatment.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/leap-option-held-more-than-12-months-tax-treatment.asp)

"The seller of the LEAP is taxed at the long-term [capital gain](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) rate if they held the contract for at least a year and a day. If they held the contract for a shorter period, they would be subject to short-term capital gains rates.

Selling a LEAP option contract is not the only way that an investor can incur tax consequences with this instrument. An investor who exercises a LEAP call option and then sells the stock purchased immediately would be subject to short-term capital gains rates even if he or she had held the LEAP contract for more than 12 months. Once a LEAP call option is exercised, the investor must hold the stock purchased for more than 12 months from the exercise date in order to qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rate."

Are you saying the premium for leaps have cheaper price just because  you have the potential to hold it for a year and get tax benefits from it if you do?
They aren't brand new, they've been around since 1990..just because you haven't heard about it, doesn't mean it's new lol.

They are smaller cap, have over 100MM in back orders are the post says.  These kind of companies have the highest upside.

Puts are a bit scary at first. I think that people that already know what they are doing with options play with both most of the time. Maybe they lean more to one side than the other but overall they are just like you. Im more of a bull my self but whenever i see a bunch of indicators telling me to sell i start buying puts.

Lol someone posted about quiznos and it reminded me of baja fresh. Looked up their history and did you know Wendy's lost quite a few tendies on them?

Paid $275M for the chain and sold it for $31M a few years later.

In 2002, Wendy's International purchased Baja Fresh for $275 million.[7] As a wholly owned subsidiary of Wendy's, the 249 restaurant chain[8] saw consistently declining same-store sales.[8] In 2006, Wendy's sold the roughly 300-location Baja Fresh chain for $31 million to BF Acquisition Holdings, a private investor consortium that had operated franchised restaurant units for such chains as Sweet Factory, Cinnabon and Denny's.[9]

If the stock is left alone and GME does fuck all (like they did for years) then your theory is indeed correct. Shorts will exit peacefully. 

But they’re actually doing things and trying to turn things around. If you’ve been a long term short position holder, there’s no way a Microsoft deal is priced into your models. A Sony deal could be priced in at this point because of rumors but the MSFT deal with revenue sharing definitely not. 

While idiots here were jerking off over how huge buying happened over GME installing MSFT office, investors with better news saw revenue sharing as literally free money for GameStop and invested in it. 

Another thing is while itd not be good for the long term, they can always announce a stock buyback.
You're performing a very valuable function. You're adding value to the tech bubble stocks that people are cashing out to buy real world economy stocks with. The more cash you put into them, the more cash will find their way into those other stocks eventually. 

There's always a need for people who feed $$ into the market

100% of this sub is either tech calls or tech puts. Nobody buys any other shit. So when tech is up you got FANG boys talking about green dildos. And when tech is down the bears start saying “obviously I knew this would happen” I wanna take a long 90 second piss on this entire market. Take out calls wait for a pop then sell and immediately buy puts. And repeat. Use this strategy it seems foolproof right now. In the summer this would have got you massacred but now. See a stock rising buy puts immediately

You can make more in short term taxable gains buy moving leap contracts like bro step off and suck dick

My old boss tried to sit me down and grill me for an HR complaint, but when I found out what the issue was I asked "am I getting fired for this?" He said well not it's not quite that severe, so I just kinda tuned him out for the next hour or so.

It's pathetic when adults try to sermonize to one another over minor shit, and it's even more pathetic when people let someone else do that to them, like goddamn be an adult lol

Weekly reminder that Hedging is a waste of money
To the counselors on wsb, I love my gf she does everything for me and is extremely Loyal. We are what you call “opposites attract” but when I try to talk to her about stocks or anything complicated she falls asleep. She can have all the energy but as soon as I start talking she falls asleep. It bothers me so much, what should I do?

I guess it makes sense if you just sit at home doing nothing all day like a NEET. Personally I’m not about to not shower tho

Def not. Changes a way different color than MDMA. Pretty much the only possible reactions were MDMA or MDEA, they produce a very similar reaction. Except MDEA is rarely sold and or cut into shit. Even if it was, it’s effects are pretty similar to MDMA with a similar safety profile

Right. I guess it's good that I only manage a 10 figure portfolio at work, but yes, you're right. 

If you can claim to a hedge fund, you'll bring them 5% monthly, they will sell their left ball sack to get you to manage money for them. But this shit doesn't work, so that's why your claim is irrelevant
well i just moved out my moms house and recently [made a vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VDJ0Y1Uhek) about it but for the first time i am well situated with a well paying job and finally off drugs so i will have to decline your offer for now. find other crack head to break to the bones

Diversification is for _______
Wsb is gonna moon that shit and we're all going to be printing tendies. Literally half the people on wsb are going to be rich as fuck. About 1-5% of those guys are going to do the smart thing and cash out and never play the casino again. About 12-24 months from now half of us are going to be in just as much in debt as we had gained because we're going to double down. Some of us may be dead by this time or severely hooked on cocaine and methamphetamines. Some of them may have held onto a couple of long positions so they can slowly feed their cocaine addiction selling off a couple shares at a time.

This is the first time I've seen anyone talk about this. So you're saying shorts can effectively exit their position slowly and overtime without triggering the squeeze
I’ve been stuck at 30k or so since September. I think BABA calls will change that though.
2 million, you could run the wheel at MSFT at say $200, which is essentially 100 contracts, and probably 20-40k a week in premiums.
And if you get called, you sell covered calls for the premiums for a few weeks then go back to the wheel.
Should be able to make 10-40k a week for awhile with that much capital

I run the wheel on Ford and make about 60 a week in premiums per contract. Got called 1x and still have those shares, selling covered calls on that.
Depends. That is my current job, make about 100k a year. However I want a million. Looks like I am a greedy bastard like everyone else here.

When I take a position it’s generally a dollar or two out of the money and in the direction of a trend on the five and fifteen minute chart and heading toward an obvious point of interest like he VWAP or bouncing off a strong support. Some days I do not make any trades. Most days I make one or two. Generally I trade all at once with a block of 100 contracts. I watch for an hour before I execute, typically. I almost always exit a trade if I’m up 5%. I almost always exit a trade when I’m down 10%. I have very few losers, and a lot of small winners.
I really like you internet stranger. This is a good post (perhaps because it echoes my thoughts).

I used to often call out sick to my old office job that I hated, usually because I was out drinking the night before (most often called out on Fridays).

We technically had unlimited sick days, but the pattern was so obvious that my boss started sending me emails basically saying "I don't believe that you're actually sick, you're irresponsible, you're lazy, your reputation is suffering, you might not get a raise," etc.

Every time I received one of his autistically long rants, I would open it, glance at it, think "damn that's a long email" and I just...wouldn't read any of it.

Depends on firm policy. No idea how they would enforce it too if you aren’t sending your confirmations to your employer
I use daily or two day SPY options as a way to get more leverage trading breakouts or reversals on the index. I have done this with other stocks and ETFs but I like SPY because it’s highly liquid with low bid ask spreads. You have to use a tight  stop and be prepared to exit trades when they don’t go your way.
Only being once means you have not fully fleshed out the joys of said experience and I already know it was fun and hopefully not short lived by any means. Just with this one you are leaving SO SOO MUCH on the table. Jesus try boofing next time if your partner is comfortable with it. Just make sure you only do that and nothing else in conjunction if you go that route. WILD times to be had.
If it can monetize repackaging data, so be it. We shall see
I've got till december for spy to dip below 350, the longer it takes the better, but will be fucked if it takes longer than december opex and i still got a huge cash position to blow on longer dated shorts if we go up, i'm ready to get jacked to the tits

> I'm blown away that's come up in this sub lol. Had a college prof who would rage about third world philanthropy - some guy goes in and gives a bunch of shirts to poor Africans, thinks he's doing a great thing because hey free shirts for Africans. Really he's undercutting the African shirt economy, completing drying it up. Then he peaces out because no more shirts and there's no one left to sell shirts to the Africans. If he really wanted to help he'd help them start a shirt store

Nah that'd mean free trade is bad and protectionism is good. Also relevant: broken window analogy - but in kinda opposite way.

If Africa is flooded with textiles, they don't need textile manufacturers, who could instead do other shit that is necessary.

AFAIK it's also untrue in his specific example that someone "peaces out" -> they have plenty of clothes supply because we don't really have anything to do with our piles of crap. We're constantly producing clothes and throwing away perfectly functional ones.

TL;DR: it's not.

The problem sometimes through, AFAIK, is that various Bad People will steal the charity and use it to be stronger Bad People which is indeed counterproductive.

You don't understand the business model. This isn't the same company moving forward.

It seems that you're hung up on video game sales and that doesn't even matter as much anymore. GME will obviously still have physical inventory sales as an integral part of its revenue, but the true vision is becoming more tech-like within the omnichannel retail business model.

This is the key part you are missing:

Monetizing customer data sales to gaming publishers will become a high margin component of the business. Online advertising revenue and downstream digital revenue sharing with gaming partners will keep GME profitable and healthy. These are the business components that you overlooked, or more likely you didn't even know existed.

Cant forget to mention PC hardware sales, a $40bn/year industry. GME will get a piece of that growing TAM.

I will speculate that GME may get involved in used PC hardware, making PC more affordable to lower income consumers, coupled with their BNPL service recently launched. (high margins on this). They are already accepting trade ins for cell phones.

Wrap this all together with an omnichannel business structure that is 50% e-commerce offering same day delivery and you have a winner considering what it is currently valued at (700m MC). Pure value play here. Should be trading with a price-to-sales multiple of 1 within 2 years, generating 8bn+ in yearly revenue. The share price will be at least $100 if management executes properly.

Business turnarounds are common. BestBuy was struggling massively only 6 years ago before commencing an awesome turnaround. They are now valued at $30bn. GME has the potential to be successful.

eBay stock surged following the March lows. However, its forward P/E ratio stands at only about 13, near its long-term averages.  Nonetheless, analysts project profit increases of 48% this year and 9% in 2021. Its a good bet, IMO.

It earns nothing if you play with $100. If you manage a 6 to 7 figure portfolio you want to limit downside as much as possible. To have near 0% risk and definite possibility of 5-10% profits per month it would be massive profits. On top of this if your betting on large cap stocks a lot would have to happen for it drop over 90%. The same type of stuff you can easily cheaply position yourself against due to the low probability.

Hi

I live for The Office references
UVXY calls?
ok that sounds like a real major - u should definitely study. do the pomodoro method or something
SPY to 358 tomorrow!
You think I can afford that shit?
MSFT tomorrow?
I know! Guh!
Try shitting at $TIF they hide it from the riff raff but you don't have to buy anything
Haha *takes off bull horns* told you fucking idiot bulls these levels weren’t sustainable *deletes comment history*
But who knows. Maybe this world is brutal and it's hard to make money thus I'm staying poor for the rest of my life
$SJM calls
The more trades you make per day or week, the less you make. Less time to consider your decisions, and more opportunities to be wrong

That’s fucking hilarious
Earnings on 12/8
Only 30 Contracts. I am a broke college student :(
It says sell then buy, but the last time I sold an option I was left with no money to buy anything. Imma sit this one out
Started my account with 15k, now at 16.2k. Last NIO puts I sold made about 2.3%. $350 off 14.8k collateral but that’s not common, usually 1% is the target but typically make around 1.5%
I put my limit sell at 36$. Could go higher, but if I get 300% off my shares I’ll leave before greed wins. It could hit 50$, but it’ll never stay there.
How many days since your last put?
Option expiring on same day .. 11/11 option contracts are 0 DTE
niu it is not
What’s your strike price and expiration on NIO btw?
Edit: Nvm u mentioned in another comment.
That’s unfortunate. Highly recommend MDMA with your closest friends. It’ll change your life
Just saying that last rkt earnings it tanked and spy went down 5% the day after, just saying
he is richer than the whole sub combined

Yea you are right, my apologies.
Lol
No it’s a rumor like acid turning you into orange juice.
prolly tmr will be flat.. I think around 265 - 272 level then possibly move upward on Thursday because even though CCP wants to control BABA but they still want to be proud of BABA thus they won't go extremely hard on BABA like how market is brutally doing to BABA

Don’t say it. Don’t ^fuckin say it
Yep. Fuck knows why poeple on here think the 'smart money' is some huge hedge fund when almost all of them have been getting killed. The upwards rip in QQQ was largely retail driven whilst 'smart money' like Einhorn have been getting killed all year. Retail and options flow have a much larger impact on the indexes than people realize.

Check out today’s charts for AAPL, NIO, TESLA. Very similar. More dips tomorrow on all 3. Hopefully the reshuffle will be done by tomorrow EOD.
Eh still possible to lose money in Theta gang just very hard to and rarely do you have to realize a loss if you are patient enough since time isn't against you as much. As long as you don't sell any retarded naked calls or puts you are fine.
Thanks pal! Yeah, "what if" is indeed a worse feeling.

Mormon bible, bro. This 'merica.
APHA has always been undervalued compared to the other LPs. Outperforms on earnings, but the stock is shit and it gets sold off after every move.

APHA's brands are highly reviewed in Canada. They own a European pharma distribution company that will eventually sell EU GMP certified weed SKUs in 12k locations.

They just bought their way into the US without a major equity partner. $30m+ EBITDA accretive deal for $50m stock, $250m debt.

CGC has blown *billions* of STZ's cash and won't see a significant ROI for a few years.

Weekly puts at 20 delta, mostly NIO recently
Barry 😍
I have never bought puts yet cause I'm a fucking noob but I am definately bearish at times. Wasn't sure about rkt but I would have done puts because for some reason all companies tank after earnings in my very very recent memory.
Mm yeah i thought of that right after i posted. Good point.
Life loves watching me get my hopes up.
Yes
Australia has never left a good impression with me ever. Britain is rotten to the core but they have Gordon Ramsay

I’ve withdrawn $4200 since October 1st. Idk about you but I have debt to pay. And I gave my self a deadline of November 31st and what ever I still have in the market by then will be liquidated to be debt free. And after doing this sell for profit & withdraw for a couple months I decided I want to continue it even after I’m debt free. It actually turns this into a 2nd income for me
Right?  Plus every time I buy an ITM call it becomes OTM the next day and loses 60%, so may as well just save everyone on Wall Street dedicated to fucking me the trouble and just buy OTM.

Lmaoo my dude. Once again your losses could also be 100% you just refuse to agree that your exposure isn't 100% of your portfolio. Your exposure is only 10% of your portfolio so your 10% losses are actually 100% losses.
It's like having cash in your bank account and saying it's your portfolio... No it's fucking not.
You’re exactly what I’ve been looking for

Michael Burry bought a ton of it and it got shorted to the point of retardation. Right now it has no right to be as high as it is given covid but looking at historical charts, most console releases it spiked really hard the quarter after console release. They also had a sick deal lined up with Microsoft.

Problem is though that no one buys consoles anymore in stores when amazon/walmart/direct manufacture sites are cheaper. Add in covid and the most autistic short play I've ever seen.

Either its gonna short squeeze to 60 bucks a share or its gonna crash and burn. Michael Burry already dumped Scions portfolio a good chunk of GME so I dumped mine around the 14 dollar mark. I felt something fishy and got paper hands. 

Either its gonna be a long play that might pop 20 or the short squeeze will happen and its gonna moon.

But theres a good chance itll crash and burn and I dont trust GME right now. My hands are too paper thin to hold that shit till March
performance art. Optimism in the face of impending doom.
Ever since joining theta gang on 10/16 I have never lost money and I still buy options sometimes, AMA
Call spreads are one of the better options.
mods restored it
It depends on the stock. Volatility can be really different one stock to the next when it comes to options. In my experience with LEAPs you make slowish but steady gains so long as you did your homework. They're very stress free compared to shorter dated options. My personal sweet spot though is in between. I buy options 3-6 months out with a specific sell price in mind. If it doesn't reach my sell point by six weeks till expiry then I just sell.
Thanks for the explanation! What are you projecting for tomorrow?
This is retarded
aapl opens 100 and msft opens 200 would be grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat
Just as a heads up. Being a financial advisor doesn’t mean your neck deep in markets. So much of the research, theses, etc. comes from a central research department. You’re just respouting what they tell you. Being a financial advisor is like being in sales. So long as you know that going in
2 months.  I'm talking about their potential in 5 years.  And maybe no one cares about the chips but maybe they care about all the money they are likely to be reporting quarter over quarter.  I think this is a sleeper.   But maybe I wrong.  I just want to know if my math makes any sense because if it does that means this company with a 90 bill market cap is likely to be worth 500 bill in 5 to 7 years.  I donno tho I was just playing with numbers cuz I wetoded

They're moving back to phase 1 in Baltimore on Thursday. No chance we go back to full lockdown, but I expect heavy restrictions will come back all over. We've already been through this and figured out plenty of adaptations to allow business to continue at some capacity. The furthest I think it will realistically go is having bars & restaurants close indoor service.

Bought some BABA and ACB weekly calls this morning taking up my entire portfolio. Hoping they are both green by open, feeling slightly confident since I’m seeing so many bears for both companies. Wish me luck

S&p historically trades flatish for 18~ months after a bear market as Earnings catch back up to the P/E expansion. We're likely to see it go a little higher in the short term as non-tech sectors continue to recover but overall the market will be flatish until October/Nov next year. Individual stocks though could rocket.
prolly get all the pussy too
So take five of them? I don’t see your point.
Buy JD call

BABA was totally fucked by chinese government because boss Jack Ma trying to pull some bullshit wall street style financial scam in his new company

JD just down with BABA simply because they are in same sector

That’s the spirit. She walks you out to reception or something to check out? Perfect time if so. 

Worse case she turns you down. The feeling of being turned down is a lot better than the regret of always wondering “what if”.
Yeah it crushed my ability to generate normal amounts of dopamine bc I abused it heavily from 14-18 so I now exercise until exhaustion 6 days a week and hate doing mostly anything besides sex with girls out of my league and golf - yes golf.

You didn’t ask but I felt the need to share being that this thread is beginning to feel like a meeting.
US precedes HK for stock performance. Since down in US today, it will be down similar amount in HK. Then tomorrow is a new day. With futures up and Baba way oversold, good chance we bounce from here. Regardless, this moves back to $300 by end of year.
Retard question but isn’t the market closed tmrw?

Since the NIO bull sentiment has somewhat died down in here, maybe it will run up again. pls.
It went byebye
Baba went down today before 9988 since news came out after HK close yesterday. But 9988 is dumping even more than BABA did today on the NYSE
Maybe. I think I'm looking at a 60-75% loss at open tomorrow. Not sure if it's even worth rolling down/out. 

I might hold on and wait until it recovers a bit before rolling it out. I feel like I'd be selling at the low if I did that tomorrow

People are out of the job and don't have the extra money to spend on the newst games, their target audience is more likely to take up microsoft on their $25 a month offer for the Series S console which does not include a disc drive or profit share for gamestop if not purchased from a gamestop (and who is going to pay $299 upfront when I can pay $25 a month and pay it off quickly to get that $299 rate since there is no APR for like a year)

Gamestop is going to probably have a record low sales compared to previous console generations releases which will likely cause the stock to drop.

So couple things I found interesting.

With SPY at an ath this means a stimulus is priced in and the PFE news as well.

So what would be the catalyst to drive it up further?

Also what are the odds of gridlock on the federal budget? IIRC funding expires in Dec.

I saw Republicans introduced a budget in the Senate this week but do Dems use it as a pain point to try and get their wishlist and as a way to influence the GA runoffs, i.e., take a hard line in an effort to try and paint the message a triple D government is voters best bet at stability?

Not too sure about how the last one will play out because over the summer they came to an agreement pretty quick.

After they finally have to kick him out of the house, he’ll maintain a cult following of weirdos (like if QAnon hit the crack pipe even harder than they already do) that will celebrate him as the true president in exile. They’ll probably do domestic terrorism too in support of some next level batshit beliefs, Trump then gets sent to Guantanamo for desperately encouraging it all
my god no. the numbers are different in HKG and NYSE
At least I don’t get enraged by someone making a joke about his measly Brk.A shares. If you got rich you wouldn’t be so angry all the time. Or don’t be a total cuck boi. That works too

which is 8 shares of BABA is equal to 1 share of 9988?
More tech exec’s on Biden’s team than tech critics. NQ rocketing back to ATH again. The fear that Biden would be death to these big companies just got crushed since he, like any other politician, just sold out.
Bold of you to assume I'm not in poverty already. Look, I'm on WSB
Crazy enough, you can actually have a job and friends. You should try it some time 10/10, would recommend
No this is not true at all. If the graph looked like that then the independent percentages would exactly mirror the republican vote percentages (like 90% for trump and 80% independent for trump). The independent votes will not match up with the republican votes because it's a different political demographic (another way to say this is that you wouldn't expect the democratic voters to 90% vote for trump just because it's a really red county).

The data that's shown looks pretty similar to a graph in which the independent of party vote is split 50/50 each time. [Here](https://imgur.com/47thEyy) is a useful chart someone made showing this (sorry for bad language on the bottom, but the math should show you what I'm talking about). Having a 50/50 split of people who don't want to be either republican or democratic seems very possible if not probable to me, especially with higher than normal numbers of republicans voting against a republican incumbent.

Ya energy sector might be oversold, you’re right, but I’m finding it hard to be bullish right now. 

Market is way overvalued, it’s losing momentum, governments are spending epic fuck tons of money, printing even more, and a party that openly and proudly advocates for socialism just won the house, probably won the presidency, and even has a chance to gain major influence in the senate. 

It’s not quite ready yet, all the signals aren’t quite there, but this baby is coming down and it’s coming down hard.

Apple has a 2 trillion dollar valuation you won't see any sort of significant movement in that stock up or down in a day. It either melts up or down
But at the end of the day your putting money at stake and structured properly you always have a 0% exit available. I understand your stance on exposure, but isn’t that what hedging is all about? If I feel there is a remote chance of a stock suddenly dropping 90% I’m not gonna touch it. That being said I don’t see myself really getting hit as even then the wins would beat the losses because in reality I’d cash out more than $100 and never really lose $100 if any. I of course acknowledge and accept the possibility but worst case scenario while everyone else loses 100% I only lose 10%
I broke my nose last December when I slipped on ice and face planted so at least what happened to you sounds cooler. Pretty sure it was only 5 stitches though.

SPY gaining 20% in a year is considered a solid performance when the economy is doing well .

Lol thanks. When I ran my numbers I predicted a narrow trump win based on several factors like incumbency etc. I wasn't too shocked by the outcome because it was reasonable given the fundamentals of the economy plus sentiment.

Look at the delta. It represents the change in premium based off a $1 move in the underlying. So a .5 delta would make you add or subtract $50 from a contract if the stock moved $1

Depends on which side you take:

Fascist side = gives you three free Robin Hood stocks. However they end up canceling elections and the constitution forever 

Neoliberal normal side = says they will eliminate student debt but never actually does. However this side cancels everything in the culture war but you get to keep the constitution and reserve currency status for the dollar.

Yep.  Cruise lines aren’t even generating any revenue right now - so buying the stock is just retarded.  You are buying the promise that they may be able to sail again, and they may have enough cash and loans to not fully go under.  Even when their business was good they would sometimes only break even on individual voyages. And if you remember the cruise industry didn’t really treat their passengers well when this shit went down in the spring.

Who care what the polls say? If the polls were correct then there would have been a blue wave. Plus, Russia, China (maybe) dicking around in our elections isn't going to lead to confidence in our system. 

The Republicans did (and continue to) do everything possible to make make voting hard for those who are likely to vote against them. 

I'm also not a Democrat. Trump losing is the best possible thing for the Republicans. His unilateral grip on the party has been awful. I'm glad it's over.

FML why did I think it was a good idea to load up on MCD $215 12/4 ITM calls Monday 🤡🤡🤡🤡
But wouldn't that be anthetical to the desired outcome? For example if you wanted all the promises they made like universal health care, gun control, labor etc you would need a solid majority in the house/senate. Having Biden in power but R holding the senate and dems the house is a bad setup because now Biden is the blame guy if the economy worsens etc. So that would lead to a R house take over in 2022 and president in 2024, which would signal an end to their platform.

Like I mentioned earlier if Trump was wildly popular and lost then I'd be skeptical of the results. But this was an outcome that is feasible. A narrow loss in each state he won in 2016.

The key take away I would say if this-- his brand of conservatism plays well to the overall electorate weighted for the electoral college. Polling which showed men/minorities going for him (see miami dade) and him holding his strength in WI (a state polls had him losing by 7 points) tells me his 2016 win wasn't just the product of a fluke or clinton not campaigning there. It's a trend that is something to be aware of.

We have record hospitalized patients and Sorrento's phase 2 trial is now live in both locations.

Not commenting on the specific post you linked, just his feed which I had never seen before
You wouldn't be up $100 post sale if the stock price movement is violent.
Using this, if stock ABC, drops 50% the ITM call can actually drop less that the underlying stock price it's price given IV would go from 30% to 250%. And if it stock price stays low, you could get called, you'll realize a loss on stock sale far wider than the gain on the call you sold.

I'm not missing the point of the play because there's no play. 
Once again, your investment is your exposure level. If you have $1000 invested and only $100 at risk, your portfolio isn't $1000 .... It's $100 and returns are counted against the $100 and if you lose you lose big.
The above paragraph about exposure levels is what's driving your returns ... You're saying you're seeing small returns, yes that's because your portfolio exposure is TINY because you cover most stock price with an option 90% stock price coverage =10% exposure so you could do this 10 times with your portfolio size and lever your exposure... But guess what, one wrong move and it WILL wipe you out. Risks are SIGNIFICANT they aren't amplified due to your low exposure.

To analyze this, do this next time, calculate the premium on the option you sell. if it's a $1call on stock trading @$10 sold for $920, your premium is $20. After the drop, let's say to $9, you will find that the option is trading at $830, so a premium of $30. 
So essentially you have $100 exposure and you're losing $10 trying to earn $20 by buying back the call at higher premium. At this point it actually makes more sense for you to sell the call again (but this isn't allowed unless it's cash covered or your margin is large enough) 


Easier more straightforward strategy: selling covered calls. Buy company ABC stock trading at $10, sell 1week long call @10.5 for 0.20 for a 2% weekly premium. Let it expire and collect premium and repeat, or buy it back after a stock price decrease, and sell another one closer to the money. Rinse and repeat. You get called, you get some upside (premium and slightly out of money), so you buy back the stock again and do it again. I did this on Deutsche Bank for the last 10months and recovered like 80% of the stock value from premiums.

How much innovation has Facebook done lately? Found another spot to cram ads? What about google, their core product is a search engine that really hasn’t changed since it’s introduction almost two decades ago.

Man a couple red days and a vaccine PAMP and motherfuckers think tech is ded and we should invest in cruise lines.

We’re so far out from actually having a vaccine even once it’s approved, that value gonna pump and dump like 4 times before it actually holds.

Shit you buy your rcl leaps and they’ll do a share offering or go bankrupt in like May and your leap dies faster than grandma died of Covid.
I'm going to baghold the fuck out of these because I know the minute I fuckin sell is the minute it skyrockets. I bought all of these for like 5$ each so max loss isn't too bad.

Welcome to the stock market. This is how it is
Bought in at $265 today, it’s at a good support level now so hopefully should see a bounce or at least stabilize rest of this week

For auto investors holding NIO's shares, the good news is that the company will report its third-quarter earnings before the market opens next Tuesday, Nov. 17. That's good news because the report will almost certainly be a good one: NIO set a sales record and hit key milestones in its growth plan in the quarter, and its chief financial officer has hinted that cost-control measures implemented earlier this year are bearing fruit.

Bullish Copypasta
TLDR?
[deleted]
I was ofc kidding my man, you do you.. In the end we all need something to believe in
Most scars are bad and permanent because people don't do what you're doing. Just keep it up and maybe use Mederma or something later on. It won't be invisible but it'll be faded.

Also why are you surfing? That's where sharks live dude.
More like nobody has any excess money and the investment barrier to gaming is very low especially based on entertainment value per dollar, it can't really be beat..

My ToS acct that I put 250 into when I opened it for charts is holding 100 SBE warrants lol. I'm only playing SPAC warrants on this account. Started with 250, bought 100 RMG warrants for 220ish, sold for 375, bought 100 SBE warrants and now I'm at 515ish. Might sell out soon. Looking for the next SPAC warrant to buy, preferably one that hasn't hit the radar yet without a target but close to one. Maybe I'll just sell the warrants and pick up some calls.

Been bag holding VKTX calls since July cuz the analyst targets are much higher than share price and consensus seems to be fairly well received for their drugs. High institutional ownership. Price starting an uptrend. Catalysts for their drug trials on the way. Premiums are HELLA cheap rn. I might say fuck it and put in more for next year expiration.

They’ll still ask for references to verify and want to check on previous payroll records. Today’s age they can easily check through companies like mine which  is Equifax and specifically the workforce solutions division on employment and income verification. Just google the “the work number” which is where I work. I’m not sayin  there isn’t loopholes you can exploit but a good company which has resources to verify through its own hr or third party companies like mine will do its dd..

Lol like you guys wouldn’t be claiming rigging if you lost. I was reading polls about confidence in elections and it pretty much confirmed that whoever loses thinks it’s rigged. Just like last time. Nothing new. I think something like 27% of Democrats thought the election was ‘free and fair’ after 2016.

‘There has been a dramatic decline in Republican voters’ faith in the system. Before the election, in the same Politico/Morning Consult poll, 35% of Republicans thought the vote would not be free and fair.

More Democrats voiced trust in the election, 90% saying they thought the results were “free and fair”, up 52% from the pre-election poll.’

The standard now, sure. In a year, who knows. My company, a ~160000 employee multinational, completely switched to Teams only as of this month. We've had a mix of Zoom and Teams up to this point but I guess since Teams is free (with 360 sub) we are just going with that moving forward.

Plus I think Teams is coming out with a personal version soon? That'll be the beginning of the end for Zoom.

Technically yes but you can’t profit from this with upward movement. You can only make money if the price drops hence bearish. Wouldn’t bullish/bearish be defined on which way your betting? If you enter a position like this your dumb or anticipating making money when the price declines

that's great and all but even the anticipation of a vaccine will weigh down on Zoom simply because it is ridiculously over valued and the closer we get to a vaccine, regardless of how quickly it is produced/distributed, the closer Zoom gets to losing relevancy and future growth.

Just wait until Trump starts the lawsuits that grind this country to it's knees.

Okay serious question: How are you avoiding slippage on illiquid strikes? Volume almost always hovers around the price. You’re talking about purposely setting up at the extreme end of the chain. Curious to hear the ticker if you’re willing.
Jesus 30 million that’s crazy
Sph for earnings obvs
BA for next week news
Yeah but unless im reading it wrong that's out the money, and by around 25% too
What’s the play fucko? Are options even available on that?

And? You can say this with basically any stock
the guy who derived it (professor at mit, he partially invented email) is a lot smarter than both of us so it's safe to say he has considered that possiblity and hence why it would then look like this [graph](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1326314851296112640?s=09), but it doesn't. It's a linear slope.

But wouldn’t the only risk be locking up some capital? And even then only about 10% of the initial investment? 

Of course you screen the options to make sure you can get a premium you’d find acceptable. Couldn’t just do this on any equity that’s for sure.

Also if you hold the shares your inherently prone to risk. This way you can definitely get all your money back. In terms of shares dropping more than premium that would require a 90%+ drop
Why? Any lucky SOB holding any contracs just made a 5400% roi overnight.

Or maybe, just maybe, there were a bunch of a Republicans who just couldn’t stomach voting for Trump ... Which would - wait for it - explain why states where Republican senators and congressmen won, Trump lost. Ask yourself this question: Why is no Republican questioning the results of the Senate election (where the GOP will have a presumed majority) or the house election (where the GOP picked up 5 extra seats)? THEY WERE ON THE SAME BALLOT. Talk about shitty newb hacking, change only the presidential candidate selection, but not the rest of the offices down the ballot that were up for grabs? That’s like stealing a nice purse, but dumping the wallet inside full of cash as well as the car keys on the ground. If you’re gonna steal, steal the whole thing.

So donnie basically just recycling the news from last night on Twitter now?
It's predictable to me that these trumpets can't understand Republicans voted in person (because they were told to) and democrats voted by mail (because they were told to).

Then the Republicans made it where mail ins in many states couldn't even start to open ballots until election day.

Then they're shocked *SHOCKED* when democrats claw back in.

Opening ballots require:

A station to open envelope

A station to verify its in a privacy sleeve

A station to verify signatures and remove the tracking tab

A station to remove the ballot from the privacy sleeve

A station to count

A station to file

Each station with poll watchers from both sides and on cctv.

To the person's comment above. Being a financial advisor is all about being a salesperson and networker. If you can build connections and convince them to trust you with their money, you'll be successful.

And yes, you are paid as a % of the money they have invested for you (with no performance upside or downside). At the end of the day, you are really just helping them with asset allocation (stock, bonds, etc.), quarterly portfolio reviews, planning for certain events (like buying a house), and maybe every once in a while, having some stock idea. But yea, as a financial advisor, you're not telling them to YOLO on options.

Yeah when stocks are volatile and swinging up and down, you can sometimes sell and buy back 2-3 times in one week, taking 50% each time. A little more risky with selling covered calls on a volatile stock though.

What if the defunct game store just tanks like expected and the shorts are right? I get the whole squeeze dream but what if there is just not another catalyst.  Why would there be one?
Yeah I doubt this. The outcome was within the normal bounds.

Fundamentally nothing really changed between 2016 and 2020 in those key states. Trump narrowly won each of them in 2016 and narrowly lost them in 2020. Beyond that you can argue that each party now has a high floor low ceiling on those states.

Add in minority men shifting more R and women going harder D and factor in women make more of the voting pool and that can shift the election by the percent or two to give Biden the win.

But even if you believe this theory about rigged and whatever, it can't square with dems shitting the bed in the house/senate. That alone shows you there was split ticket voting. Trump was too toxic for some people but a generic R was appealing.

Bottom line he was just too much for those swing voters who voted for him in 2016 but went Biden in 2020

Demo on chicks who are eligible for this would be like 16-35, at least an 8, and suck mean dick. So like 1% of the 1%. That’s like 35k women who probably 30% already have one, 30% don’t want one and like 10% are doing well enough to buy their own. So that leaves about 15k bikes sold this holiday season. At a discounted price. To be fair that’s only America. So 🤷‍♂️ still seems weak. Especially with people back in gyms. Bottom line they trade at too high of an eval. Even Tesla came back to earth. We’re watching it happen with zoom right now. Think pton’s on its way down with another 15-30 in share price to go before hard capitulation.

I had some redwings 2233’s, bought diehard moc toes because the red wings were so uncomfortable. The diehards are holding up fine, maybe even better than the red wings (red wings sole is totally fucked after a year, diehard sole is fine after 6 months) are infinitely more comfortable, and about 1/4 the cost. I’m not saying you should cheap out on boots but shit man it worked great for me.

Where the hell did you get the idea that this argument makes any sense?

This is exactly the logic that people who defended slavery used, I.e. “Well what will all the slaves do if we suddenly end slavery? They will have nowhere to go. They’ll all just starve! Slave masters provide a roof over their heads and food for their hungry stomachs. This is a very complex and nuanced situation, you must understand!”
Hope you studied!

I generally swing trade naked calls/puts by doing technical analysis on stocks that I like and understand. I do well, but you can always lose your whole premium. 

This is just exploring ideas. Say you use this strategy and make 10% per month steadily. With 10k starting that’d be 1k a month. After the first month you can start doing riskier plays with profit from the consistent plays.
I’ll bet you all of your money that ur wrong

On investing.com

Nikkei 225 (+1.8%)
ASX 200 (+1.5%)
uh that directly correlates with bond rates and the bond market is far bigger than the stock market and money flows out of bonds and into stocks and vice versa based on those rates

its complex and i dont understand it all, but if u compare the graphs u clearly see some relationship between rates rising and meltups. rates on 10yr are mooning harder than june 8 rn

I guess I can’t speak for everywhere, but I would not say it is end of the world career wise. If you are no longer going to be a patient, I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t be accepted. It depends on management though.

I mentioned that on twitter there was alot of comments under trumps tweets clamoring for a direct check payment and that I thought those people didn't understand that that payment would eventually (either through labor, reduced services etc) have to be paid back. Basically any stimulus isn't really "free" money and literally within seconds i got an instant ban.

Yep, this retard doesn't know what he's doing at all.

By put-call parity he's actually selling insurance against the underlying going down. It's a neutral to slightly bullish bet and not bearish as tard boy claims.

&#x200B;

Related: a reasonable, but not great strategy for a long-term portfolio is to sell 10-20% ITM long-dated calls against SPY or whatever *when VIX is high, but you don't think your ETFs will go down significantly*. It's like selling a cash secured put/insurance, but you collect dividends and are reducing total transactions. You also get leverage by buying more stonks with the premium.
i was fuk and now im not fuk
Fuck Jack and never bet against the Chinese government. There were no shrek dildos last night cause no one knew what China could do next in terms of clamping down on them
I already have positions like this where the premium was 90% of my expense. Opened 4 today. I’m not concerned with missing out I’ve been burned by FOMO plenty. Not making money isn’t the same as losing it. And in terms of the stock recovering you would sell immediately and be up at least $100 (10%), I feel what I wrote was conservative and you seem to agree in your 2nd comment (correct me if wrong didn’t quite understand). In terms of the reverse calendar spread etc I’m not familiar with all that, but I’ll be sure to look into it and how it may compare. 

Anyway I think you missed the point of this play. It wouldn’t be all about making crazy gains. It’d be about not taking any losses. Even if once a month you can come out on top with 10% that’s 120% a year that is seemingly sustainable. You can certainly make more, I’ve seen it, but this is more sure fire and helps in navigating uncertainty and volatility.

Seems like a natural fit for WSB. Everybody is always saying to inverse yourself. So instead of finding a stock you’re bullish on, here you’re picking a stock you’re bearish on. That’s cool, I believe people are born bearish and it’s not a choice so just accept who you are and love yourself. I think the genius is that you’re selling the call instead of buying it. Literally can’t go tits up. If you got bull curious you could always find a stock you’re bullish on and then sell a deep itm put but it’s your choice.
lets talk about the real Market Makers

I didn’t pay much attention to it for a bit, but I actively watch AMZN, SPY, TSLA, & SHOP all day. PM, trading hours, and AH.

Twitter is usually an options burner. If you want to get your feet wet, try out SPY. Much more liquid, more strikes, more dates, bid/ask spread is tighter.

Also, check out StockTwits. Sift through the banter, but you’ll learn things.

Okay. So I get that puts have their place. But if you look at the market from 1929 to 2020, stonks tend to go up more often than not. Why would anyone ever be a permabear? 

In addition, stocks can go up infinity (i.e. you can make infinity money on a $1 call), they can only go down 100%....
Very way
I think it's just playing to the base. As I mentioned eariler I don't think you will see trump chain himself to the oval office desk and refuse to leave.

Dude Nio has offices in London and San Jose, CA. London is their where their Formula E team is based, San Jose is where they do self driving research in Silicon Valley. They are literally a start up that started in like 2014. They're set to expand to Europe early next year, whether that is successful us up to Europeans. But if you want to talk about international relations Germany and Japan, and Italy too since you threw Ferrari in there, were all on the wrong side of WWII and look at the sentiment of their engineering pedigree now. 

You also can't use the "losing X dollars per year" arguement anymore since pretty much every company that starts now is losing money to build a user base to one day become profitable. 

Honsstly it just sounds like you're salty cause you maybe didn't get in in time and you're envious of all the Nio posts on the sub. If you are, leave the negativity behind and look for the next one. A few years ago it was AMD $1.58 to ~$92. Anyone who got into Nio or AMD under $2 took a huge risk cause AMD was dog shit at the time with no future, and Nio was about to be bankrupt.

Go look at historical PE of Microsoft and its peak 00 value vs how long it took to recover. I’m not arguing I just think your logic is flawed.

He said fuck you to China banks. And if you didn’t know they are government run.

Here’s all you need to know. 

The immediate catalyst for the action was at least in part a speech Mr Ma made in October that was critical of Chinese banks and regulators. But in the background, regulators and banks threatened by the rise of nimble new competitors have been lobbying hard to rein the sector in, particularly Ant and its ebullient founder.

“He had become too arrogant,” said the head of Asian economics at one major international bank with close relations with regulators. “They needed to put a leash on the monster that Ant was becoming.”

Over here in America FAANG grew unchecked and they do have substantial influence over people which china could fear alibaba having the same reach could topple their regime.

TLDR; SPCE April 21 OTM Calls

8 out of 9 analysts rate SPCE a buy. It was an unheard of 8 out of 8 until Goldman Sachs decided to rate it neutral, in late October. Odd timing right?

SPCE will be making history in literally 10 days! This 3rd successful powered flight will likely seal the deal for their FAA COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE!

52 week high was 42 dollars! Market cap is still under 5 billion!

You said it yourself not particularly about the .com but some of this tech companies have been relevant since before the dot com get real. Apple, windows, Intel, Amd are not new companies.... and this are just the peak of the iceberg of tech companies.... im not talking about netflix. Im talking about historic tech companies that have done well for most of their history and their history is around 30 years on some of them. Im not telling you to put all your money on ONE of them but there is a reason they have been relevant for the past 4 deacades and is one of the ONLY sectors where major breakthroughs pour to other aspects of society and that keeps them relevant.   


Its not a new era if some of this companies have been around since the 80s man.

Which hour and why sell after losing
You're sweet NEPT's moving averages are bad and they've missed every earnings estimate. Here was the aftermath of the last 3 calls:

Feb 13th: Closed at $1.86, dropped 12% from $2.12 the day before. Red dildos for days, down to $1.69 and eventually $1.21 two weeks later. 

June 10th: Opened at $3.09, closed at $3.00, then $2.88 the next day.

Aug 11: Ended high at $3.11, reported after hours. Next day opened at $2.88 and closed at $2.73.

You're better off selling now and buying the delicious dildo dip.

Yes, theoretically, but there's also been no stimulus voted on and no motivation for anyone to do that either. Welcome to politicians not caring about the wellbeing of citizens. Seriously, I doubt lockdowns will happen before Trump leaves office.

Also, keep in mind that unlike early on in the pandemic, hitting record hospitalizations doesn't mean as much because there's been a lot more time to prepare for it. The system was massively overloaded before because it wasn't expected to be, and ever since then, there's been a lot more preparation. That's why SPY isn't 100 points lower at the moment. The numbers are highest they've ever been but the situation is not nearly as scary as before.

So many things wrong with this idk where to even begin
1) deep in the money call options trade at very low implied volatility so you're selling a cheap call and getting trash premium

2) volatility increases after a drop. Meaning, given your example, even if option price goes down to $700 from $850, implied vol goes up and in normal times that same call would have been worth $500 so you're also overpaying for calls you buy back

3) the risk isn't zero. The risk is of stock price going up significantly and you not getting the upside. This part can't be ignored.

4) more risk is in the stock price never recovering. You buy back the call you just sold, stock price drops another 5%, that's your loss, and guess what, you just levered your loss because your effective exposure was 10% of the stock price so you just lost 50% of your money. Good job

5) if you want to lever it more, why not go for a reverse calendar spread, buy a deep itm short dated call, sell at same strike price longer dated call. In both cases there's call risk and in both cases there's market timing risk.
Can you explain what happened in March?

In case anyone’s wondering, Trump keeps losing lawsuits left and right. His own attorneys are now actively filing appeals and simultaneously dismissing them on their own. No clue if they are simply churning fees or just distracting from something worse.

2019 10-K bottom of page 23:

" As of February 1, 2020, we have $101.3 million remaining under the repurchase authorization. "

They have not done any buybacks yet so far in 2020 so that authorization is still available. There is no expiration date.
PM if you want to bounce some ideas. I like the angle. 

Before the august tech bull run, I was selling covered calls on my $SPCE every time it ran up. It always dropped the following week and I’d buy the call back to close. I did it with chewy, Sony, but I got hosed when NET finally exploded on me. Kept the premium, but had to give up the assets. 

It’s an easy way to collect steady gains with all the volatility. But this is rather lower risk.
if you ask nicely, you can keep the credit at time of sale

The way it seems like you’re using priced in, it is not. 

What occurred Monday was pure emotion trading, again. 

A vaccine is bearish for most overvalued tech in the medium-long term. But bullish for almost everything non-tech medium-long term.

The market isn’t going to immediately recover and go straight to the prices these stocks will be at a year from now post-covid due to the vaccine. 

That’s the way it seems like you’re using priced in.

A vaccine is not priced in. Just like a stimulus is not. 

Otherwise they wouldn’t pump the markets every time.
Wait.. you guys are having sex?

Well I think we all know the democrats are lizard people but what if we spread the truth about them actually being manbearpigs. Al Gore knows the truth
If you look at a chart of the last 3 months, we've basically been rangebound and bouncing between SPY 324 and 358. We bounced off the top again, so the most likely scenario is we head down for a while. And the past two days have confirmed the trend, for now anyway. You are just too stupid to zoom out on your little robinhood chart.

>No just your investment account is in a downtrend cause you’re retarded lmao

Anyone, and I mean anyone, who calls other people poor (or claims they are losing money) as a generic insult, without any information to back up that claim, is looking at a deep red portfolio and grasping at straws to hard cope.

No one making money is so upset that they go online and make wild assumptions about other people's portfolios. I know this because I make a fuckton of money and I've never once had the urge to do this. I couldn't give a single shit about your portfolio. I just like money.

Absolutely. Also correct outstanding shares is 65.16M. Float is estimated to be 48.63M.

Vaccine needs to be stored at -94 degrees from what I have read. Logistically that’s an issue.
Are you retarded? Today we hit highest number of single day hospitalisations AND highest # of new cases, and it’s only the first week of November. Lockdowns are inevitable. That’s how exponential growth works — big numbers lead to REALLY FUCKING BIG NUMBERS. So gotta lockdown to avoid spiralling out of control.

Your statements are baseless. 2001 dot com has entered the chat. 2008 over leveraged financials and exuberant home prices has entered the the chat.  Every time there is a “new era” of thinking there is a harsh reality that follows. I cannot predict the future but you seem to think tech will run from president.

I just don’t like the moves China is making, they’re making some weird crackdowns on tech stocks, and Nio is subsidized (whether directly or indirectly) by China. 

Otherwise I know they will make money in the short and medium term.  They contract manufacture so they don’t have extra fixed costs as they scale up, and they are supply constrained.  So they will make money.  But they arent going to be the tech juggernaut that Tesla will become 

I sold my calls and made my shares free because trump is going to win and the market is going to freak out, especially China.

Lost it all since btw.
I've been thinking the same thing. I bet if you did just calls and never puts you would get bigger gains in the long run.

$1k 11/20 $20c - probably won’t be out too much
Man, if that was it this market is even more retarded than I thought. And I think that was it too...
Still convinced everyone talking about tiny futures moves are bots
Zero. Feel for u.
Imagine thinking this bull run wouldn't continue. Like you'd have to be a mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging, smooth-brained dipshit to think we'd have another leg down for any reason.

That's an excellent hypothesis.   Is there an expiration date on the buyback authorization?  What's the source/ governing document? Would love to dig more into that.
Yes
It’s already been recommended but sell cash secured puts to obtain those stonks.  Not only will you get the stonks at a discount but get paid for doing it.

Look it up.
Future don't matter!!!!


...unless it looks my options are gonna print tomorrow.

Everyone on Wsb
Nndm a straight buy for some long calls
Agree. I invest in weed stocks and I could not believe the ru up that got. I assumed it was a short squeeze until I found it it was into earnings. Which anyone who pays any attention at all knew were going to be shit because gave guidance literally TWO weeks ago. 

You have MSOs growing +100% yoy flirting with cash flow positive earnings while these guys are down YoY lighting money on fire. 

I have no idea how they became the meme.
Can’t believe I though Hershey Crakle was worse than Hersey Peanut.
Can confirm. Can't believe I missed this. Pure gold.
Most likely gonna be out 2k from RKT 11/13 calls. 

How much did you guys put in?
Get it back in blood
Nah if anything Putin wants trump to win
Yes and so are my 25C
The fact this isn't a penny stock by now is laughable
yes you are probably -60% at open. Might as well hold because you have no choice

Maybe if the rest of the market goes up 5% pre market our RKT calls will only lose 75% value by open

Probably a good move.

NASDAQ probably gonna shit the bed again tomorrow.
I agree. But I think Nevada is a unique state. Most of their economy centers around tourism.

The narrow biden win coupled with a narrow clinton win four years before means that D who I believe hold all state offices have to walk that fine line, otherwise the next election isnt going to go there way.

But it probably means they try to diversify their economy by trying to get tech jobs or something else as a hedge
Pretty sure that's Eric Andre 🦜🆙️
100% agree! Personally all my short mid indicators point downward
Nothing of value or anything that could even remotely threaten the election results, or a big nothing-burger that further legitimizes Biden’s win

The risk is the same as holding shares.  You're counting on small drops in value, but if it drops faster you will lose more than your premium.
It isn't my area of expertise, but the good news may have lowered general credit risk across all debt classes, encouraging banks to start lending again, and that tends to cause treasuries to increase. Of course we're talking like a 0.1% increase but it's noticeable all the way down here.

3. Everyone says calls are "free money" and start fomo-ing all over the place.  


4. Then we get random ass drops that wipe out people.  


Then they leave, and new ones come in and the cycle continues. I feel like we are at step 3.

U guys are neglecting the most important variables which are his mass and the impact force on the cross sectional area of his feet, assuming he free fell from roughly 100 feet, honestly looked more like 75-80ft to me, but let’s call it 100 with his apparent weight of what appears to be 200-225lbs (I’m going with 220lbs and I feel like that’s very conservative) we could be looking at an impact force ranging from 20-25KN on a cross section area of less than .03m, so anywhere between 650-835Kpa (96-121psi) of pressure on the widest part of his foot, granted this is also dependent on how far he sank into the water after initial impact

I was hoping they would be able to use up the last $100M buyback authorization before the positive press releases start rolling in. In my mind that is the only reason to delay any positive PR to allow them to get the most shares at the lowest price.

Once that buyback is used, the trap will be fully set and no reason to hold back the good news :)
Yes. Plenty of time... Probably.

I have by far the worst dandruff of anyone I know. It's insane. My gf puts lotion and cream on my head/face every night before bed and it clears it up. But I also shave my head so Idk what to tell you if you have hair.

I miss the fuck out of mango’s daily covid task force press conferences over quarantine. Loved watching the market move on his nonsense and him rage at the mean nasty questions. The market was easy then...simpler times.

I've done it with one girl. The pleasure was from it being tighter, and the fact that she was enjoying something so submissively. I may be overthinking it but I think the turn on was the feeling that she wants to be submitted like that.

No. He is not safe. Look at the after hours performance. It is cratering. The earning were brutal. This was a pump and dump
Yea it’s because retards from this sub look it up after u guys keep shilling it
Take a look at early September. That’s how.
What are shares?
So calls on Nio and snap or calls on Amd ? Wha going to pump next ?

ACB puts? Mind showing position?
GameStop will likely be getting a 25-30% allocation of all new consoles.

I wouldn't be terribly surprised (though, very tendie-rich) if that was their next announcement this week.  Look at how Porsche broke the news about short sellers of VW stock back in their infinity squeeze.  And GME has a higher short float.

My GF asked me how to buy ACB stock on Friday at like 9pm. Told her market is closed and she would be retarded to buy it cause it’s gonna dump. Low and behold. She owes me fellas. Lol real talk she has like 5 shares of Tesla and like 5 of Apple smh
Is there anyone well-versed in 20-30 year treasuries (ie TLT) that can tell me why the yields are increasing and not lowering? 

Is it solely because people are expecting inflation to appear out of thin air?

My uncle bought the dip on ACB today and is feeling good about his positions going forward. He has about $37,000 in calls expiring in December and feels that with Biden being elected it should print. Is he safe ?
he is short the put, both are long positions
in ER with PLTR
Same 5900x and 6800 XT or 3080
Some Galaxy brain actually asked last night if he should buy in. Pretty sure everyone said no
His wife’s a supermodel why does he want my old clunker

Atleast you can buy RKT shares and just sit on them, my nkla puts are hemorrhaging and im sitting here praying the MMs are gonna let it dip enough to break even before expiration. Lesson, never buy options late, early or not at all.
Tomorrow is gonna be a nice RNG dip to buy.
Why are you like this
yes
Same dude. Same.
You are definitely in the right sub.
Hardly ‘up’
NIO futures mooning rn holy shit, did news come out?
if that's the rule then people will be buying in at day 2 to sell to the guys at day 3, given the insane price action we've been seeing things have to move a little faster. 8.58% in 10 non business days on SPY. in 2017 we went straight up all year and got 20% return
Yeah sold mine for 300% profit today
Is this a real question lol

Should be fine. Hype for Q4 ER will hyperinflate the value. When you feel like you’re about to give up and sell it all, hold on a little longer.
GTR is more fun and more reliable. We just bought my little brother one for his first car. The thing is WILD. So mechanical and wild. That Porsche probs drives like my AMG.... muted and “okay”.


If you’re buying I really recommend test driving a Nissan GT-R 🙂
You can it's just not worth as much as the put
Currently holding the most retarded strangle:

Just incredible stuff, pure self delusion. It’s like the same five people talking to themselves. There’s no outside interaction, nobody cares. I was laughing at the option chain activity following the lockup expiration date but now it makes a lot more sense.

They're citing John Hopkins.
At this point,I'm not sure. It might go down(tomorrow) since everybody is selling off tech stocks and going for retail and airlines. It might go up for Thursday/ Friday for the earnings hype
Got wrecked on BJ’s calls I was holding for quite some time yesterday. They started making gains after last weeks run but lost more than gained with the big drop yesterday. I BTFD like a motherfucker. Went in on 40c 11/20 and 45c 12/18 for major discounts. 

Made some pretty good gains yesterday after the dip and even more today. The 40c’s are at +150%. Get in before it’s too late earnings next week ho’s.

Yeah, I find it interesting how everyone is convinced the market is out of the woods now and only going up.

Still a lot more bad shit that can happen until the vaccine is out and everyone has it to the point that everything can re-open and get back to normal.

And then the after math of this economic impact will still need to be dealt with.

Look I was a huge zoom bear as much as the next folk but I ended up conceding because these stocks that are growth but overvalued can reap the benefits of lofty valuation by selling their stock which fuels their growth more / strengthen balance sheet. It also attracts more talented engineers seeking equity for their compensation. So it’s kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. If zoom reveals some new products it’s gunna spike hard.

Recommended play:
Sell puts ZM 400c 11/20 or 12/18. Or call spread 500/600c 1/2021.

Hannity and Orange man. What's the news?
I think the market isn't reacting to the drama re elections because they know that the guy in charge right now doesn't intend on challenging a transfer of power.

Its just a PR campaign to keep his base entertained and enthralled so they don't lose interest between now and his next tv show/book whatever.

I'd be more concerned about the semi lockdowns and OPEC/Iran etc.

I watched online on YouTube TV. There was no new announcement. Go thru comments on my account. I wrote out all the major points
So true, pretty night and day difference between fucking around for 30 minutes and playing for hours with established cash.
Remember that we’re still tied in the senate.  Republicans don’t hold that, tech is fuk.  

🥭 shitting up his tv time tonight does not bode well for the Republican senators in special elections in Dec - Jan
there are people whose small youtube channels i go to daily, just because i want to see them update, because i want to hear them fail and suffer. so there definitely are these parasites in society out there dude. keep struggling and overcoming because it does bother us
SSR tomorrow so good chance of green
you didn't do so well in physics class, did you?
Me too brotha. Coulda.gout out this am for a bit on profit. But you know. Pigs get slaughtered
Right? My employer had already said we all work from home until. Even with a vaccine people will be working from home for a lot longer
Bulls, do the testosterone dance so this keeps pumping

Damn. Loss porn post brewing
Guys you can blame me for the BABA dip. I bought yesterday at close and now it's gone back to prices unseen since August. Only can someone like myself have the power to tank a stock 10% in a single day.
That shit is so fucking rare and we had like 2 weeks of it. May never see wild shit like that again. Or it might happen tomorrow
It’s a pipe dream.. minimal data set for a vaccine suppose to go out to hundred of millions.. should’ve sold the news at open.. all downhill from here
My tie is a clip on! I love when they do the writing jokes for each other they haven't read yet LOL
Im so fucking overlevered please J Pow if u give me a green day tomorrow i swear i’ll never overlever myself again

Go ahead. Set it up.
What do I do with this information. Give me a strike / date anything!!
Previously NKLA has had $0 quarterly revenue so in fact, their yearly revenue \*is\* 30k

Also I did not specify that annual revenue was equal to the avg salary, I just said revenue which implied the revenue for last quarter. Either way it works though because NKLA has yet to make anything besides cardboard cutouts of trucks.

She said 100 yards bozo
I can't see this market making the move to 3650+ after Monday's reaction. Everyone is saying that uncertainty is decreasing, but there's still a ton of shit that could hit the fan before EoY.

I think Monday's vaccine pump set the top. If tech keeps falling, it puts more pressure on cyclicals to keep up the momentum. 

Financials should be okay, but the reopening plays could get fucked by lockdown news (which in turn would give tech a boost).

TL;DR: No fucking clue what's going to happen.
Man being a Bull is like playing on easy mode. Just gimme a fkn day where my puts can print jesus christ man please.

Not sure if you fools realized this or not. But futures are blood green. 

Not sure if you fools realized that means nothing.
If y’all feel that this vaccine news is fading with the difficulty of distribution logistics and want to make a play on a company that is working on a room temperature oral vaccine look at VXRT. If one of you bored, unemployed degenerates wanted to do a DD and make it a meme stock that’d be cool.

Reading is dangerous so I mostly watched videos. Fastly solved a really hard problem (for some reason quickly deleting a specific tagged thing off a cache in under a few milliseconds is hard) and I'm not so sure the legacy cdns can do it without a massive redesign of their systems.

Fastly was built from the ground up to solve that problem, in particular. I think they're now getting more into doing actual compute at the edge. I don't know how much of a differentiator that is. I do know other CDNs have had like 9 years to catch up on instant cache deletes and haven't yet.

Then again I'm way too retarded to really understand it. I actually just like the name. Fastly. Just say it, it's like sex in ur mouth. FASTly.

TL;DR Yes investors can be dumb. The vaccine is also better than most scientists had hoped/expected, so prices have to adjust to be conditioned on "it's apparently a great vaccine" from "we'll get a vaccine eventually, it might be good".

First off, there's definitely a layer of "many investors are sheep". Bubbles happen, prices only reflect value accurately over long timescales, blah blah blah. I don't want to act like this is definitely rational behavior...

...but a big part of the news is not just that "there is a vaccine in existence". It's that it is, by this preliminary look, a really really really good vaccine! The reaction among scientists seems to be surprise at just how good the apparent efficacy is (Fauci refers to the result as "extraordinary" [https://www.today.com/video/dr-fauci-calls-pfizer-vaccine-results-extraordinary-as-coronavirus-cases-soar-95637061708](https://www.today.com/video/dr-fauci-calls-pfizer-vaccine-results-extraordinary-as-coronavirus-cases-soar-95637061708) while UCSF chair of medicine Bob Wachter has a twitter thread here [https://twitter.com/Bob\_Wachter/status/1325833082100834304](https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1325833082100834304) including his note that " 90% efficacy is far better than even most optimistic projections". Other scientists' Twitter reactions have mirrored this happy level of surprise). For comparison, flu vaccines often wander around the 40-60% efficacy range, and efforts to make vaccines against other coronaviruses has been notoriously tough (a review article is available for free at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284272/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7284272/)). 

So there was a very real fear/chance that the Pfizer vaccine wouldn't work well, and by extension many other vaccines would be likely to not work well. Since we have this new look, we need to adjust prices of stocks like Zoom that are most strongly affected by this change in possibilities. We've basically eliminated a big chunk of probability that the vaccine will be garbage, so there is less odds that we get 2-3 more years limping along with shitty vaccine tech and more time for Zoom stock/user base to moon in lockdowns.
Fair point! I stand corrected

Listen up tards- 

APHA for the win.. maybe not tomorrow, but I think it will blow up in the next couple years. everyone is getting excited about them because they bought Sweetwater brewing, and so that means they can /are getting into the cannabis beverage industy... which is awesome, BUT...

In addition to that reason, weed and beer just go together...for real tho, beer helps weed grow.

Growing ganj takes a ton of CO2, in fact all grow facilities have CO2 distribution systems. CO2 is essential to the growing /flowering cycle, and fermentation just so happens to produce a ton of it, so much so that it has been used as a CO2 source in greenhouses for quite some time, because it can be one of the most efficient ways to produce CO2. 

In short, APHA for the win, they will be growing and brewing in the same facilities in the future, mark my words! Damn that would be a sweet job...growing weed and makin beer

True, but you can't predict the past from the future. We have never had a lifestyle oriented manufacturer before, let alone in EV. Have you seen NIO house, or have you seen how confident Bin Li is in his company? Do you know the chinese government has been giving preferential treatment to NIO?

The ONLY negative thing that this stock would have is some accounting fraud. But they are selling cars, there are american families in china who've driven them and used the swap stations, so it's not a scam that's for sure.

I think we agree more than we disagree on this in all but the timeframe of holding making the profit through the insane volatility. 1/3 of the US has decriminalized week, like as of this last election. That’s with the most conservative government, and electorate we’ve had in 50 years. There’s massive support for decriminalizing, and legalizing, and as the individual states fall, the process hastens. I give it another 2-5 years max before we see nation wide decriminalization, and many states, the most populated, democratic ones first which make it the majority of the population, then down the list will legalize recreational use.

Again I agree it’s not a short term bet, and agree ACB may not hold the best growth, but the sector as a whole is on discount for those wanted to be rich in 2-5 years.

Or cook in a skillet. Look up a Gordon Ramsay video of him making crispy salmon with potatoes/succotash as a side. I make the succotash often but he goes through how to make an easy and perfect crispy skin on salmon in the pan.

Too bad stock splits don’t change market cap. Apple needs to give up on growth and focus on the dividend. Apple can’t release a product at this point that can meaningfully move its stock price. Apple can only be compared to amazon and they both have better growth prospects going into the future.

NIO futures slowly creeping up
While I agree with your general assessment, why so than do independent value reviews say otherwise? The concepts you’re addressing are detailed in the value assessments, being the competition with eventual “big crop”, and the lawsuits, which on their face are not a direct threat to the companies overall health. The market share of ACB is primed to claim some stake in the US, that’s universally accepted and why we saw such a rally on US elections even when compared to other cannabis stocks. I feel people are far underestimating the profit yield that the US market will produce when, not if, it opens up. Like beer, there’s room for many competitors, and given the roots ACB has planted (pun intended) even “big crop” won’t be able to touch it for years when the US is open for business.

This isn’t my personal view, but that which I’ve gathered from the half dozen of so independent assessments I’ve read from “professionals”, some being individual boards, others as reviews for the cannabis future as a whole.

So a value stock is typically a stock that has a low P/E, high dividend yields. Yesterday, a shit ton of money was dumped into these types of stocks, the most recorded in the last 20 years. That money had to come from somewhere right? What sector was absolutely anally raped yesterday AND today? The NASDAQ. The money came from there.

Ok. Whatever "Bombshell" Trump is trying to drop tonight must be bullshit or Hannity would have led with it. Probably why we're getting green candles

oh ok, carry on then.

I bet you were
I got burned with holding through previous earnings. Learned my lesson. Fun shit - all topics back then were full of people repeating mantra that it's a super value stock, just buy the dip and hold, it will moon. It was back then when stock was around 25-28, LOL. Now you see same fucking shit repeated. This place never learns. Sometimes you just need to stay the fuck away from cursed stocks like rocket. For the last 3 months every single fucking retard was saying that RKT IS ABOUT TO MOON, when in reality it was stuck in 20-22 channel.
Back testing has shown that if you just buy every single dip you'll never lose money

Imagine getting royally fucked by the CCP suppression
The problem here is that it's assuming that the options aren't mispriced. The 3.50 puts I bought on Nokia earnings went ITM. 2200%. It's but even that it is a bad bet; it's the market assuming something very possible is impossible.

In fact I'm more surprised people sell that stuff. The risk is actually immense if it goes wrong.

Okay, but he specifically said because of the stock price. He said nios stock is in the 40s and fords high was 12 dollars.

Not gonna chase it down? When I started with $1k in my portfolio I’d chase things down buying 0.1 share at a time. Seeing people spend huge amounts at a single price point makes me cry. I probably would have done the same yesterday on BABA though if I had that kinda cash to sling around because it was really looking like there was no way it could go lower
Ahhhhhhhh righhhht. Thanks.
Just like that I made two grand. The other guys looked at me like I'd just discovered fire.

Please don’t torch the rest of that money, you should sell while you can and buy puts

I knew solar was the future, especially under a Biden presidency and his “green new deal”, so I trusted my instincts and put what I had left into TAN, despite my account being down 71% at its peak.

What’s an exit multiple?
270, at end of the day I ended up even since I bought at the bottom of the first morning dip. I usually buy my options at the money or just out of. And it depends on your risk tolerance but I always try for calls 2-2.5 months out minimum, this tech sell off could last a little longer but tbh singles day or really any single day event do little to move individual tech stocks especially ones as big as baba, in the past 15+ years ago sure it might move it but there’s just so much transparency and available news nowadays that it’s probably already priced in
I doubt it. If the options don't reflect it the premiums are low now meaning no one is thinking of it. You buy this plan today with a calendar spread.

Markets are so overbought. News of Biden tripping over a rock will cause panic selling.
I had my finger on the trigger to buy more when it went below $40 to leverage down but just didn’t do it. Kicking myself. Ended up buying AAPL and CCL puts to hedge some of my losses. But shoulda went with NIO calls.
RKT will go to $30 again. But it won’t be for ER. It’ll be some random ass news event that happens after your fds expire worthless.

Lol, inverse the shorts (sell when they pump, buy when they dump) or sell covered calls etc. Do these sorts of moves while we wait for valhalla. I do this with roughly half my holdings and keep expanding them.

Yup. And now the Dow companies have started making recoveries so pretty soon there won’t be obvious plays out there
Only reason why I feel optimistic is because is because my calls are for December but averaged down way too much so now it’s all or nothing.

I will. I held today bc it was already down so much that I’m like “fuck it, what’s another 40% if it hits 0.” But if I get back to being down 30% or (lord willing) break even, I’m poppin bottles tomorrow!

I would sell tomorrow because it will continue to bleed. Their offering wasn't even set at $7.5. Could come in even lower. This was a good pump and now it is dumping. Not worth holding. No reason for a bounce back.

It’s not a proprietary tech. Anyone can do this. Tesla tried this before and stopped it. I was watching a Nio car review the other day, this guy goes for a battery swap. They tell him no fully charged battery is available yet, he had to go spend time in near by shop for an hour to get the swap done. All this hype will come down some day
They will also go up
i bought nio at 45 🤡🤡🤡
AMZN is still insanely undervalued. Imagine thinking people aren't still going to buy fucking everything through them, or that AWS hosting isn't going to be running hotter than the sun for the end of time. AMZN will have the highest market cap inside of 6 months.
im ok with going down as long as we go back up again, but more
for some reason my brother can't either but im not fucking with you. try using desktop or updating the app or something. I didn't go to it btw- it popped up like a message for me and offered me the option of turning it on which I did- it actually interrupted a buy order when it popped up which I found odd. 

&#x200B;

There is also the possibility that theyre testing it on final form degenerates before offering it to the general public
Run away. Fast.

I may be bearish, but you’re a complete fucking retard.
I'll keep that viewpoint in mind while watching it
It's not about a change in the thesis, it's about the change in growth expectations and multiple expansion. Many of these tech stocks aren't seeing more growth, they're just seeing multiple expansion. Becky isn't going to stop using Pinterest, but Becky also isn't going to use it any more than she already does. Becky isn't going to use Zoom any more than she already has.

Covid accelerated growth/usage and now that peaked. It's why Netflix isn't growing at the same rate as it was in April. Now people will rotate out as growth reverts back to normal. Why pay 35 PE for Apple when it's growing at 1% YoY?
so, should i just not look for job and trade wit u guys to become thousandare?
No way

Ok?
Literally can never get blondes to swipe on me
What you need to get yourself is a nice vertical spread of calls and look at yachts your gonna buy
wow we really are mooning tomorrow
Anything is an investment, including betting on red. The reasoning behind your investment and the outcome will determine whether it is a good or bad investment.  It is your job to decide whether a call is worth buying, or if the stock is a more valued position at the time based on volatility. I’ve found a few calls that were .15-.20 over the itm price but were far dated/years out. Basically paid the price of 1 stock to pick up a 2 year call. It certainly paid off considering how much small cap tech has been jumping.
I bet you’re fun at parties.

Haha. Tesla has been in this industry for more than 10 years. They are doing lot of innovations aside from selling cars. New battery tech, FSD, energy. Tesla is valued at 385 billion which is still overvalued. Tesla sold 145k cars in Q3. Are you kidding me?

stupid ass vaccines, stimulus etc messing up the market. we need more election uncertainty and rising deaths now
They did have a great earnings and yet, down 7%.
I would be so pissed if I had calls and market just goes red because it feels like it.

I liked Skyrim and even I thought the Witcher 3 was boring so..... Do with that what you will lol
This should be flaired as DD not storytime
$25 PUT FOR 6/18/21 WILL PRINT SO MUCH YOU WILL RUN OUT OF INK. ITS GETTING EVEN WORSE NOW THAT MSM IS IGNORING ALL THE ELECTION FRAUD AND TRYING TO DOWNPLAY IT AND TWITTER IS STILL GOING RAMBO ON CENSORING EVERYTHING
I have stonks which is unexpired calls 4everrrrr
NIO gonna end the week at 50
Do yourself a favor and look at something other than the 1day chart before you buy.
Is a turkey like a bull or a bear?
😎
can we stop talking about NIO and move on? We got fooked, it’s not going to 50 for all you Friday ppl

Guessing about voter fraud? 

Exciting. 

I'm watching a video from a couple MIT PHD mathematicians showing evidence of voter fraud in Michigan. Really interesting.
Definitely not. It just means you need a smoke break from the stonk market!

Trump: the first POTUS to get a second term leveraging Squatters Rights laws.  XD
Maybe MMs holding prices up to make people feel safe to go in before letting it drop even more.
What was your strike? I’m consider $290 for mid January. Singles day, their Prime Day equivalent, is tomorrow and is HUGE across Asia. I don’t think their bull run is over just yet.
You don't want it bro
I put everything into leaps.... it’s not as fun as options 2 weeks to a month out... almost feels like holding shares like the r/investing tards
Put 1000 on 9$ GE puts
Push it out to Jan of 2022 and thank me in a year ish
Fingers crossed there's a big dip tomorrow for your puts
So help a brother out, is baba gonna continue to tank?
you really are a boomer/my dad
Yea but to charities that know what to do with the money.kinda like training a guy in a trade and providing him tools so he can continue in that trade and make an earning. Help disabled or less fortunate by doing similar. It's still kinda the give a man a fish or teach a man how to fish.
Notice how 3/2/2020 is not in that list

Surface tension isn’t a physical object, like some thin sheet of ice on top of a body of water lol. Surface tension in water is due to the hydrogen bonds between molecules, coulomb/van der waals forces, etc.
you son of a bitch, I clicked that.
Sold for 100% return. Literally sold at the bottom of the peak :/. Bummed out and happy at the same time.
Leading folks down a dangerous path to opening an OnlyFans for the NIO calls
Why do my returns change when markets are closed doesent make sense
Someone just saw the wolf of Wallstreet for the first time.
Yes it did. It was literally THE top of tops. It was only for a split second too. Such a short time Robinhood doesn’t even register it.

This is why I hate RKT lmao

Edit: No you’re right, just checked cost basis is $33.96... but still literally same thing 😔

Shorts have to cover eventually. It started getting shorted at like $150/share. This was just a combination of shorts covering, Biden win pump and retards piling in.

Back to never posting a profit with over 1 billion market cap lol
what news?
Surprised to see so many Texans here, ATX specifically.
Double down?
The only game where the DLC (both of them) are better than most entire AAA games. The amount of thought put into every aspect of the game is just amazing. Make sure to play both DLCs if you are trying the game out
A 3% down day on SPY would really bring me back to life. Fkn mooning yesterday and theta burn today really sucked. 11/30 342p
Put 3500 on GE calls expiring Friday feels good man
It's that Turkey soup Gramma makes after thanksgiving that ends up as the base for EVERY fucking thing you eat until at least March
My guess is Murdoch is tired of having half his anchors arguing biden won and half playing games and invited trump onto hannity one last time to provide evidence before fox across the board calls it for biden and stops airing trumps bullshit.  The little feud between trump and fox is bad for both sides.
ACB fuckedddddddd. Puts printing.
I got some medical issues so my theta is a little higher

Hmm dunno, that'll depend on how much I can salvage at market open.
As long as you got leaps and shares in BABA you'll be completely fine bro. BABA is a long term play, China is a long term play. I got $30k in BABA leaps, took a beating past 2 days, not concerned at all.
Worried about stocks tanking after a bull run? Odds are, trust your gut, stocks will tank again.

I think FB has been becoming a boomer app for a while. I found out a couple months ago most high school kids don’t even have FB now... they just use Insta and shit. Apparently I’m a boomer bc all I have is FB and this...
That would be great, I’m balls deep in a sea of red and that after hours action sucked. Everything you read about this company is bullish and everybody who writes about is long so who the hell is selling? Its not insiders either, they think its undervalued. We must figure out who the retards are that are selling at $20
Really need SPY below 350
RKT crashed the market last time they had earnings. What has been set into motion cannot be undone
Crushed earnings, huge moon inc (if ive learned anything from a wsb dd as good as yours)
I sold a 12.5 11/20 put as well in case it dips to that point and I can just grab shares like a boomer and ride the T-Train for the next few years. Agree on long term potential. Just hate watching my calls die on the table.
I think it hits 150 after earnings
It has PUMPLOSI’s blessing

Anyone else like 0 for 20 on earnings play
So while I sold this week calls for 25, based on the earnings I dont think you should be that concerned. There’s gonna be about 45-55% iv crush but I do believe 25 goes ITM this week.
Seriously I just wanna buy a boat for my dad he deserves one 😩

Nah, it’s stonks.  Posted this in earnings thread.

Biden at the helm will open the gates to the flood of people they will write in the Bible about. These people will need a easy to use app to navigate for homes, enter RKT, already teamed up with realtor.com so that every agent refers clients to our new favorite stock. Buy the dip when it gets to $18-19, all the while securing 7%+ interest.

This is exactly where I fucked up... threw too much in tech calls last week :(
Dont know about RKT but NIO definitely

Need DDOG to tank hard. I was playing earnings runup with idea to cash in last minute and bay calls. POS was dripping red for 3 days. 
My Spidey senses told me to pul out at the loss and buy puts. Maybe I'll be able to salvage my loses tomorrow. Maybe revenge trading works sometimes?
wow ladyboys are so edgy. especially when u put them in old navy kids commercials. take all my moneyyyyy
Are you talking about WSB alone? I think it was just because people were tired of hearing about it. I dont think there are many people who doubt long term prospects on it
When do they expire?
Buy the rumors
tomorrow it is buddy
League of Legends is better
Do you even gain bro
Looking at 300. Good liquidity and was just at this price a few days ago.
Jack Ma sounds like one of those instagram pages that posts deep thought success memes with words overlayed on pictures of dudes in tight ass suits

usually a hedge against markets crashing, but if you dont have calls it doesn't make much sense to me

Long calls $25 and under are pretty much free money IMO
Yep
Frig off ricky
It’s an amazing game but it will take you 200+ hours to complete it and the expansions. Worth it in my opinion but it’s a commitment
Awesome, good stuff man. I have some 34c that I bought on Friday before close. Hoping for the best.
Bro I think those are expired already.
lol

Didn’t get more than 25 minutes into it. Was boring as hell. People swear it’s the best game ever but halo is better
Tomorrow is the day, NIO rises to $46
My positive contracts were purchased a couple weeks ago, the ones that are negative were purchased yesterday and today.
You don't wanna ask me this question. I'm too biased since I'm long a ton of stocks and I have generally more calls than puts too when it comes to options. I'm too biased to answer but I admit I'm biased. 

I do think we will see rotations of sectors (like clearly it was rotate into value, out of growth tech last few days) continuing though. It's about getting the rotation day or days right.
Fastly does some neat stuff other cdns don’t. That’s why they’re growing 40% per year.
Ski bum soup. Ketchup amd water baby
I've been holding 2022 Jan 10c. Might sell a call against it for earnjngs.
So it looks like we failed to get back into yesterday's range.

Something something bullish

Same here.
i was probably gonna dump mine at open, should i hold?
uvxy puts might print
You buy the leap... 20 percent out of the money, and watch theta burn your tendies away.
NIO is overvalued. For selling 12000 cars in Q3 you are valuing this company for 45 billion dollars.
Deepfakes for the WIN!
Baba had earnings sell off, then vaccine news, then China anti trust laws today.
thanks for the info!
Didn’t buy this but wtf? How can it spike like 20% only to crash again?
Yea I’ve made the mistake of holding through earnings before. I did hold Corsair through today tho. Strong believer in Corsair. Apple has had me nervous basically since it split. Maybe it’s time to enter tho
$300 looks to have really good liquidity and seems completely doable considering it was over $300 just a few days ago.

Naw, only a small position in AAPL puts at the moment. Was expecting a sell the news type deal with the event today
Why would his evidence come out tonight? Curious did he say he was speaking or something
This needs a thumbnail.
Yea I agree with you. The great thing is these last two days (especially yesterday), it didn't "trade" like a tech company (it moved up a ton with the other boomer stocks), but it has this added benefit of having tech-like earnings with the streaming, which helps in one off events.
I got them cardi b nipples. The wife runs out of saliva so it feels like sandpaper

In the land of kang, the ware bull-bear is king.
January $260 calls and I'm terrified
I averaged down and sold my earliest puts already, but yeah IV crush on those was fairly bad (bought before earnings, averaged down at open yesterday and sold the ones from before earnings today).

My expiration is friday though, if they pump again I am going to buy more puts because ACB is truly a poorly run company.
then i think you’ll be fine. probably breakeven
This shouldn't be that funny
The Witcher 3 set the standard for what every RPG that comes out in the next 10 years will be measured to
Thanks for the reply! Very informative. I was just about to mention that like today,  some stocks behave on their own like AAPL base don specific demand. Would you say we are in a bear market now? My call spreads pray for a similar day like today, tomorrow.
Anyone here like to get their nipples rubbed? It doesn’t do anything for me
Drill Team 6 being deployed on their earnings. That article botched everything
I can see it happening. It’s move up and down 10-20 dollars a lot lately. Singles day tomorrow maybe it edges 275-278. Then it’s set up for a possible recovery. It’s defiantly oversold imo
[deleted]
When did you buy these?
Everyone here is autistic. We all know that. But I have retards in a discord playing UVXY calls because they “love ETFs” and “can eyeball this one.“ Please confirm my suspicions that they’re stupid.
They don’t.  It’s an outdoor livestock market called “The Stock Market” full of dudes in cowboy hats and sleeveless t-shirts.
Any other retail disruptive tech other than EV’s currently? I can’t think of anything other than shitcoin
I can't tell you how many times I've regretted not getting a shit ton of shares at $90

You’re fucked
I was down 1K today and recovered it for a gain of $1.85. After today's heart attacks, I'll happily take it 😎
I looked up AAL for you. They had an offering in the morning (so this was already known). I can't find anything only for AH, but it could be like more info about the offering became known and there was a bit more of a selloff. I rarely trade these airlines anymore (used to a lot in the summer), but I just have RTX/LUV shares long term. They haven't done that much but at least they moved a bit recently.
why?
The voice overs work great
True that bro, Im super over-leveraged

I don't even care that it was bullish - they are just a shit company. Sales dropped 10% and it was absolutely NOT enough to justify a ridiculous price move when we are still likely to be in a gridlocked senate.

Really stupid that they didn't drop more today honestly
Fuck that. I don’t bet against the mouse but that shit could drop 20 points and it would still seem high.

By end of the week? I picked up March 290 calls near low of the day and I'm not even 100% sure about it.
[deleted]
Agreed, I got in at 144 because It was insane how low it got. Pre-COVID/747MAX it was almost trading at 400 dollars a share and for good reason. The company literally sucks up government money in 5/10 defenses contracts. Super-undervalue. A fair valuation right now is at least 250.

It’s like selling crack
If AMC still hasn’t filed airlines will be fine for a while
You’ve now identified that the time you should have bought calls was when you bought those shares, 90 strike. Congratulations 🎊🎉🎈🍾
Yes, inject as much emotion as possible into your trades.

A kid in my class was talking about how he bought Nikola at $40. He’s a prideful autist who just says “it’s for the long term it will go up I’m not worried.” I now want him to dump his life savings into Nikola. Retards deserve to be broke

Next step up for me would be a gt3rs. But it’s 80k more
no because they won’t have earnings like that in a while, so price go down
Imo, Disney will become the first super hard-hit-by-COVID stock to reach a new ATH. It's got the huge benefit of having a streaming service which will come in handy for earnings. Doubt it moons in earnings but I don't mind selling some naked puts this week for it.

It's always known ahead that they will beat the 11.11 record every year. With all bad news of the past 7 days I wouldn't bet it goes to the moon.
Yea still haunts me. I wasn’t expecting it to shoot up for a whole week the way it did. I bought more calls throughout that week and made more money on them. Ended up being up 110% in the end. Could’ve been much much higher but I’ll take it. Just recently bought more for $22c, $23c, $24c expiring January 15. Got high hopes
Pretty good. Car go fast. Girls like it.
yea I was using dektop and a little popup asked me if I wanted to turn it on or something and it mentioned it was just added as a feature along with something about turning it off in settings anytime
Buy the option.  Stonk goes up...sell.  use tendies for hookers and blow...duh.
I had AAL calls but sold at opening on the day everything mooned like crazy. Been waiting to get back in, just short term play. But yeah, LUV/DAL are the ones I'm looking to buy leaps on.
Wouldn't the correction happen after earnings report?

Helpful question.  Lost about 400k. Happy?  Made it all back, since you’re asking about the whole year. Sorry, I know you only asked for losses.
True story. I went to bed Sun night with Nasdaq futures at 2.7%. I was thrilled and then the massacre began on Monday.

My goal is to sell positions end of friday I was hoping for around an 40-50k gain with these trades so I could put a down payment on a house next year and start renting it out I’m also trying to do this at 18 lol but if I hit it would be life changing already up 10k just need it to ride the green wave to Friday

Anybody playing PLTR FDs on Thursday? Going puts or calls?
I’m expecting  $35-36 tomorrow and who knows after that, it’s just a flip. If it can actually gap up in the morning over the 100 moving average it’s going straight to the 200 day (at $37?) but it’s difficult to make a case on how it would breach that and I expect a bounce off

I bought them because today looked like a bullish pennant. Had a very straight flag pole from Monday and today is was consolidating into a wedge, I bought before it broke up and I’m not holding past tomorrow

I will say the volume these last two days has been incredible. Yesterday was the highest volume on XLE in history and today was double normal volume too

There’s going to be big inventory draws reported for oil tomorrow but after that, I don’t know what the catalyst is for pushing up more

I bought long dated calls on Berkshire so that I always win.

* Majority of its net income comes from its large stake in apple.
* Its boomer value portfolio takes off when vaccines are announced.
* Calls add leverage to offset the "boomer" returns

I actually think it's going bankrupt. If I had to pick a 10+ dollar company that was going bankrupt, it would be my first choice, ahead of CCL and PLAY which I think could make it.

The best trade woulda been to long LUV/short AAL when both went down to the bottom. I think LUV is up like 50% since then and AAL is flat. It was a riskless pairs trade since there was no way AAL could outperform LUV and if both go down, AAL goes down more.

Lost my Job and was 50% invested in Alibaba. And went to a close friends funeral. Hope you guys are having a better week than me.
What is wrong with you?
Idk man, jack ma not giving enough schloppy to the Chinese president
Are you mental?

Yes, got my asshole blown out selling far OTM tech condors this week. No such thing as support this week for high IV tech.  Only thing i won on was tesla and closed out both sides when practically worthless on the swings

Sounds like it’s going to hit $20 EOW.  Doubling down on calls
Tech is rotating into RKT next
4:1 margin is fine if you know options well.  So if you have 30k and borrow 90k (so 120k:30k net) I think that's actually fine as long as you have stop losses and don't put that on short dated options.
Will zoom go up because of earnings at the end of the month?
when did you get them? It just had a run up
Company has balls, i give them that.
Yo man, fuck you. You sold those calls to me. Now we’ll both lose big.
I have a math degree and I'm going to agree that it is for all intents and purposes 0. The only feasible way I can think of to determine air resistance would be if we knew the height he fell from, we would calculate how fast he would hit the ground with 0 air resistance and then back solve based on the discrepancy

Someone likely has calculated air resistance for a human in pencil formation though...might exist in a table somewhere

Baba has been cucked twice now in the last week by the Chinese government.  I am holding calls, fuck me right
There will be no dip. Solar works everywhere all the time now. It's radical and going up everywhere.
So they quadrupled their estimates when they reported last quarter? They will literally not quadruple this quarter. I’m sorry bro but you’ll be bag holding for a long time. You do know everyone rotated out of tech yesterday to value stocks right? It was the most money movement out of a sector in the last 20 years. If this doesn’t indicate the tech bubble pop, idk what does
Source ?
Short squeeze didn't trigger when the stock was 15$

Now it's 11$ and ya'll are scratching your necks talkin bout how a dollar or two share price increase will *definitely* trigger that squeeze

lol
I'm usually around 1-2 days off for the reversal. You know it'll rotate back but getting the exact date is hard. I started accumulating today since I don't wanna miss out but maybe it only reverses end of this week.
Isn’t weed bad for dogs?!
I still feel confident in BABA. Anyone who didn’t already know that the CCP has always been the ones really pulling the puppet strings for any company that wants to operate in Chinas market is out of the loop or lying to themselves. Give it a month or two, they’ll negotiate terms for ant IPO singles day will crush expectations and the fomo buy will begin again.
How many % of margin borrowing is too much
GME has decided to pay off their credit card balance before it was due. This is important because the bears think that GME was gonna have the Repo man knocking at the door, but this proves that's not gonna happen anytime soon and maybe discourages shorts because it makes the "GME is about to go bankrupt" argument lose a bit of steam.
Austish
Where you at SoftBank?  Need to do your thing again
Sometimes failure teaches you more than outright success. I need to be more confident in my positions and stick with my plays. My initial play was spot on, I just didn’t hold it long enough. Timing is the hardest thing when it comes to trading options IMO.
I am holding a memorial for all BABA bagholders if you are interested in coming, you require good suckin’ lips.
finally someone with common sense. zoom is making partnerships left and right. it is most definitely here to stay and will continually grow imo.
Yes, so I can buy in cheap

Ah so it wasn't gold that changed in value, either due to new production coming online or increased demand, but it was that darn fiat currency. Therefore before fiat currency gold didn't shift in value. Oh, right, the crashes.
If you’re on the app just go to “Rooms” and you’ll see them
Markets go up 90% of the time, but markets turn downwards faster than they go up(historically). Therefore, it is usually wise to have some sort of leverage as VIX gets lower. Buying options as leverage against other options can be extremely profitable if you buy the right wedge and time your trades.

You’re going to have to go to a psychiatrist—Adderall is a controlled substance, so it takes some work to get it. Just make an appointment and tell them you think you have ADHD and want to be tested for it. You’re not going to look like a drug seeker if you’re genuinely trying to get treated. 

Like with many psych drugs, what works for one doesn’t work for all. Adderall was great for me for a month or so, then my system adjusted and the side effects started fucking me up. You may have to try a few options before you find the solution.

5 years from now you’ll be working at Wendy’s when it’s LK 2.0.
A stop order will allow you to set a “price” under which you’ll set a stock to sell. 

A trailing stop order will allow your “gap” to move upwards with the stock price and will get triggered when the price drops bellow a set price.

As far as having a stop order being useless in a free fall it is relative. In other words, the order will be executed but may be a few cents bellow the set quote. Personally I never had an issue with this. 

Hope this helps.
I know. Wishful thinking.

It’s not going to rocket like crazy but in the future say next year or so people are going to realize how big this company is. This one will eventually hit 300 to 600 in the coming years but it’s a long term play

Your TA definitely did not predict the announcement of a vaccine.
IV and theta crushed into earth’s core
We’re still all going to be shut in and working from home for the rest of this year and the second half of next year probably. The vaccine hasn’t been mass produced yet. That will take time. Then some people won’t want to get vaccinated because MuH RiGhTs! The vaccine isn’t a magic bullet, it’s just a weak lifeline. Tech should still be the right play for a while, but I could see transferring over to boomer stocks (value stocks) maybe in May/June 2021.
Made a lot of money off of IVR in june. Plan on making a lot more off it by December.
Wow I just realized there’s a bear den and bull pen room on WSB

Yeah, nothing is going on chump.

yea it hit 39 but quickly climbed back up. its hitting 50 by Friday guaranteed

it may hove at 7.00 if bag holders are lucky, maybe it will try to go to 7.50. But no company is going to buy at 7.50 when ACB was sitting at 4.50 and a lawsuit. Load up puts when u can.

Idk what the going rate is but as long as no cum in my mouth, it's healthy, and they don't last for ever, $100. Guess how long they last would be mostly on me.
Travel stocks and bank stocks say otherwise lol. But yea a lot of their money sits in limbo
I broke even with my 25 contracts on GE yesterday. Recouped a $1000 loss lol. 

So now im taking half of that and buying 35 contracts thru jan. Flawless call.
Yeah I was going to mention that but I tend to be conservative with my estimates
Definitely. I like to just wait until the next bump up, let’s say $50 or $60, then everyone wigs out, people cash out and it goes back down a little bit, people talk shit blah blah blah and then it does it’s next bump up to $75 when some dickhead analyst announces it. Then again to $100, then they come out with some new car or battery whatever and it will keep climbing until it really does become the Chinese Tesla. I just let that stock marinate and workout/make money at my day job and let time do it’s thing

$325 is next biggest support.

$460 is a big resistance line too.

Gaps to fill at ranges of  $496 - $445 and $325 - $414.

Zm will hit 325 then head back to $500. Both gaps will be filled.

I am cautious trading zoom because its more fundamental than technical right now with the corona vaccine and tech lagging.
The thing is Covid in two weeks is going to make the past week look like a common cold.

EE in aerospace, defense, oil & gas. Absolutely true that it's not always necessary to calculate if the results have no impact on your end result but in this case it would have some impact, even if negligible. Is negligible 1 m/s? Or 0.01 m/s? Not that it impacts the result that much but it's a non-zero number and I got curious.
I know same.
There’s still money to be made, in this market. Why get out now and miss gains? Just reinvest in another sector or stock(s).

Dumb asshole keeps preaching about unity that’s just going to make the market more rational and predictable.

He needs to start saying crazy shit on twitter like: “ALL WIND will be harnessed by 2023 green new deal wow wow just signed new contract with Palantir to monitor the movements of rogue Nio vehicles that are running over pedestrians and now they’re running the streets in autonomous wild gang-like packs #unity”
I think after this week I should sit on the sidelines until NIO day in January, you are completely right that it needs time to go sideways after all this momentum. The last thing I would want to do is waste money on weeklies.
Why my dumbass blink twice after reading this
The reason this market doesn’t make sense is because most investors are either spooked like horses by anything on the news or a boomer. If you want to make money day trading learn to think like a horse or a boomer. Or you can make big boy long term moves like buying nio.

When Covid-19 cases rise, buy calls

Futures are so gay right now.... I blame myself
BIIB does a lot more than Alzheimer’s treatment drugs. I’d imagine they get tentative approval and the stock goes up significantly.
Keeping the government we have now is only going to worsen the situation... the lack of seriousness toward dealing with the virus is abominable... with trump and this government there will never be a nation wide lockdown which would increase the spread of the virus... without changing the government these policies you’re talking about will not happen at all... distribution of supplies well by then we’ll run out of supplies at the rate we’re at right now... now that’s not good for grandma is it?

Vaccines won’t be approved nor finished testing for months I don’t expect it until February at the earliest... a change of government to change the policies and implement them will ultimately be better for our situation... yes it’ll take time BUT it’s either the policies are going to be here or not and we need them if we want our elders to be more safe
Well, I’m 74 years old, so I’ll be 94 when I print. But, at least my short on Sugandese is killing it in the meantime

I know the feeling, I bought puts when it was at 6.00. Dropped them and bought puts at 9. Then today as my other stocks crashed, I said to myself, Fuck hippies. I bought more puts. More because I hated that it was pumping on a bad earnings, a lawsuit and americans pumping a canadian stock on election.
Well you're right about the latter part anyway
Username checks out
I second this, you're gonna use it for lubrication later on
You're right, its oversold.  265 is a crucial support. It bounced off 265 multiple times in September, and 265 also served as resistance through July and august.  it was tested 3 times today, and bounced each time.  If we get a fairly solid positive day tomorrow and close around 270 or above, I think this is the bottom.  I bought some 300 12/18 calls today.
Fingers crossed there is a tech rally, SE earnings next week too, idk if il ride through that with calls
That’s fine if it doesn’t hit $40! I don’t expect this to blow up overnight. I do think that this could hit $100 by the end of 2021 based off of my DD.

All I learned from this is the market at large is so reactive to news and speculation instead of business fundamentals. Bunch of fickle insecure pussies. 

The swings are so obvious if someone could predict the news, or predict likely future events... we could...

All in Palantir. 😎 Those fuckers are 100% building a “minority report” machine.
I have, but in the short term they have some really good holdings. Im binking off the fact that people will be swarming shopping centers when a vaccine hits. This could easily retrace the low 20s. With ATM options going for pennies its a negligible loss at worst.
Damn, these deep fakes are getting spooky

How do I make money in the stock market??
I posted it like five times already, I saw someone’s account with $1.2 million at the gym, dude was like this is going to $250 in a couple years, he’s a hedge fund manager, if I ever needed a sign it was that. I had sold my NIO calls two days early for like $1200, I literally bought 700 shares that minute.
Position: 781 shares @ 41.47, holding till 2025.

Actually the vast majority of cobalt comes from industrial mines with heavy equipment.

Also Tesla batteries currently are the ones using the less amount of cobalt in their chemistry.

Haha I did the same thing then im like wait, that's covid.
I'm expecting the wsb kiss of death first and once everyone shits on it calling it trash and a pump and dump. Then when no one is looking I expect  it to continue to climb. But fuck it. I'll ride the wave up and buy the incoming dip.
If anything BECKYs will use that stuff more because with eased restrictions, a new wave of “omg feels so good to be out” content is on the horizon.

Every cabinet position would need to be filled and confirmed. Then they all would implement their own policies. This would cause lots of delay in distribution of supplies, vaccines, etc. 

Once again, think about grandma.

Well at least that vaccine news gave a teaser of what’s gonna happen when the vaccine actually comes out officially basically rotation out of tech stonks good to know
Uhhh, don’t you think they’re gonna be a little busy fighting the civil war?
I wrote this comment for a comment asking about Ohio State that got deleted don’t want to go to waste,

I live in Columbus, I graduated from that lovely university. Filled with Top-Notch professors In every field. Thoroughly enjoyed my time and prepared me for the world. Sad to see the virus destroy the service industry which this time of year revolves around football. Before selling and writing mortgages I managed a bar, almost everyone I know either lost their jobs or is making half this season, all my recent grad friends lost their entry level positions as well or were knee-capped. So many grad students lost their funding, my little sister included. Depressing state of affairs for a city on a parabolic rise not long ago. As I muse this from my 10th floor studio apartment I look at all the places down high street that have been torn down to be redeveloped in my time here and wonder how many now won’t be filled or completed. My brand new complex is so deserted there is a 2k referral bonus that goes up 1k for each person you get to move in.
Is this a yoy ocurrence (year over year?) If so, then we should expect to see drops every year around that time, correct @EquivalentSelection?
No I got 11k in collateral when I own shares to = amount of money in my account and I'm not charged interest

You must be new here
Unless it's an isolated event (like say an isolated AAPL earnings or some good Amazon news), the index usually is the first component that factors into each individual stocks price. It's true it's a cause and effect and you can ask which comes first. But the reason the index matters more is notional amount traded on SPX/NDX and SPY/QQQ is huge and most passive funds are only trading the index or ETF. Thus on a day like today, where QQQ is down, most of the big tech names making it up are down (MSFT, FB, AMZN, TSLA, Apple actually did well but followed a similar intraday pattern to QQQ and somewhat SPY). 

It's not that algos/funds decided to sell each individual tech stock which then drives down QQQ but rather MM/algos/institutions/hedge funds/small amount of retail sold SPY/QQQ (or bought a lot of puts on these - causing options MM to delta hedge by selling shares) and then by doing that, ETF MM have to then also sell these tech names individually as a result to keep the portfolio balanced since there's a direct mathematical formula. Like if you were a fund and you wanted to sell tech, it's clearly much cheaper to just sell the index than go through name by name. 

But this breaks for individual names on a lot of days too with individual events. I'm not even saying Tesla is that correlated but it definitely has some correlation. A name like Microsoft would have an even stronger correlation.

I don't know what you are trying to say. But Plug was one of my first stocks. I have since lost my mind.
I particularly like the posts about Oil tendies, because the only reason they printed was the vaccine announcement and there was really no other reason to expect a rally now as opposed to next month, or the month after that. Makes me wonder how many people spontaneously YOLO in hopes of becoming the next lucky winner.

Not talking about the regular margin requirement but the adjusted margin requirement... I believe the adjusted has a later date because they are dropping how much they are allowing people to have on margin.

Idk what you're talking about "collateral" on a put credit spread

Did you mean to say you opened cash secured puts with margin?

Or did you open a put spread where you bought a put and sold one below it? Because in that case the amount of money you're actually using is much smaller, and RH doesn't charge interest on the 1st $1000 of margin.

Wow, the oil one was pretty lucky. Though it wasn't out of the question it could rally by December, what gave it the boost was that vaccine. What XOM had going for it were the very modestly priced XOM $37.5 calls. Calls which I could have sold you here lol. Still haven't lost any $ though since they were covered, but I may. Mostly upset I didn't stock up on more XOM and sell even more puts @ $30, but I am fairly new to selling naked options.

One possibility - they got screwed over by the ECM team’s pricing initially. With asymmetric knowledge on their side, they might see a current floor in their stock prices while projecting much higher growth/prospects in their business. 

TLDR: IB underpriced their IPO, price is as low as it’ll get, RKT management decides to buyback undervalued stock. 

Alternatively: it could be to buy back and provide management with stock options without diluting current shareholders

I had a 700 GM call go tits up from this last week. It didn't go thru due to the retards at RH being retards, and promptly dropped to like 200. Today tho? Got my new short-call back up 650

small timer to you all, but I only put 500 in 7 business days ago as a lark. I've doubled in that time frame
They didn't cancel it yet afaik.  They probably will if/when the GM deal falls through.
Compared to last Tuesday, Covid hospitalizations are up 25%, cases are up 52%, while testing only increased 5%. We hit a record in both hospitalizations and cases.

But please tell me how a vaccine that won't be widely available until April is going to help us.
Pretty sure it’s just you that thinks that
haha stfu retard....wait a minute you might be spittin 😳

I think the market is going to be left in limbo because of this fucking vaccine tech will not surpass ATH because vaccine is only 6 months away and all the stocks that got crushed by Covid are gonna stay flat because the vaccine is only 6 months away

Doesn't the virus have a lower death rate then 1%, wouldn't that be terrible if the vaccine kills a similar number of people? Also it's most likely not an overlapping 1% of people who would've died from the virus, seems bad

Fortunately, we have gotten better at treating it — so death rate won’t be as high as it was, but, it’s still deadly and want too many deaths.

Total hospitalizations are the bigger concern probably, since that will adversely affect other medical needs.

that was my guess, thanks for confirming.  What a fucking black swan for tech positions.  You can't possibly predict that shit which is why having only one way positions as I did was incredibly stupid.  Lesson learned.

The "Limited" is the overall highest package, and the off road is built for off-roading where the TRD sport is the on-road upgrade. Other than that you just have to decide if you want 4 door (double cab), 2 door with back seat (access cab), or standard cab 2 door. The 4 door is available with a long bed(5.5ft) or short bed (4.5ft). I have a 2012 TRD sport double cab short bed, its great.

No, not really. This volatility is much better for options
FUCKKKK I SHOULD HAVE HELD!!!
I heard the vaccines are coming from the mountains, on Facebook news by a friend
Going back to 200 at a minimum
Yo lowkey sick strategy for this month. Claim you have covid at the end of this week and you can skip your shitty family’s/significant other’s thanksgiving and just chill at home. It’s kinda like buying puts.
Listen up guys.  This is some extreme retard DD here.  I’ve been using Vanguard to trade cause I have fun coupons in that account that I can burn.  But today I finally got Robinhood and it was absurdly easy to get options, margin etc.  

Anyways after getting cucked by RKT I logged into Robinhood and got a free stock called OPK.  Now while I don’t know a damn thing about it I feel like it was destiny that i stumbled upon it.  So I’m going to look at it as a godsend and invest $2,000 in long options on this stock.  June 18 2021 7$ call.
Not sure but maybe he thinks that you may have it backwards? If tesla makes up a big chunk of QQQ, isn't it tesla moving QQQ and not the other way around?
Hahaha.  You deserve this
Holding December calls. Currently up 300% and still holding. Fuck it.
Ya- had picked up 10 of those $250s for like 6k and cleared like 15k profit on last earnings so I held these last 2. Rolled that profit and spread it around a bit and now you can see the problem. Thanks for the vote of confidence. LOL- they weren’t that far OTM 2 weeks ago. I got them all about 5 weeks ago.  Its like you said- I’ve got time and diamond hands. To zero I ride.

Do you always buy calls at the top?
One might say last week was a short squeeze of epic proportions.
So guys. On robinhood. I have 10k and bought 100 shares of some stock for 10k. 

With margin active it gives me 10k buying power right ? 

So I open put credit spread and put 5k up in collateral.  Rh doesn't charge me intrest. 


So my question. Do other brokers do it this way too?
What news?
Damn as least he got the education to get a good job lol
It's probably worth being cautious of the potential effects of a novel vaccine type that basically acts as a man made retrovirus.

Yeah, IV is high and the puts are overbought.  I had a 40P with Jan2021 exp back in Sept but got out of it in Oct because it was just flat/theta burning me and also had too much retard strength.  I told myself I would maybe get back in at the end of November, but I don't even know if it's worth it given the current ecosystem.
COVID is death to these funds
Omfg just saw that.. my calls are busting a nut right now.. ouf baby.
The put that I was assigned on was out of the money, as well as the one I was holding.

The put buyer assigned it to me at a technical loss (I was assigned and forced to buy 100 of their shares for $315 each, when at close they were worth $328) but they didn’t wake up Monday with 100 shares worth 1/3rd less.

Had the strikes both been in the money I’d have just taken the actual max loss I signed up for since RH would have automatically exercised them.
So, rotation BACK INTO TECH!
Despite the 9.93% dip today I’m still up 2765% on NIO since March 😎

I am long at the stock.

But is a mix of sadness and joy to se how stupid these guys are.

I should leave the stock picking business and just work collecting the HUGE spreads you pay for calls to market makers.

AYRSF if you want a stable / legit MJ stock.  You’re welcome.
I am not one for conspiracy theories but it sure seemed like last week was manipulation to grow tech stocks so that the vaccine news could be dumped and the money can then be rotated out. There didn't really appear to be a reason we rallied so hard amongst all that uncertainty and no reason that the tech dump was so brutal as well. But meh play the market you are given I guess.

Bullish on NIO and I gotta agree with this guy.  Price target upgrades are what drove this FOMO.  Now that NIO is quite close to the most optimistic target the upcoming earnings report is looking spooky.  If it stays under $41 this week I could see it popping after the earnings report is released.  Regardless, it needs time to consolidate.  

Monthly sales reports will continue to be catalysts and NIO Day is in January.  So long as they make good on the promised manufacturing capacity increases this will continue to go up.  Shares and LEAPS, people.

Buy the dip. Msft, amzn, fb and aapl are not going away. Take advantage of the temporary sale. Buy, hold then buy more on dips.
Real shit guys on COVID/tech stocks dump them if you have profit still hold them if your losses aren’t huge or could potentially be huge. Wait for the virus to mutate/inevitable resurgence of COVID bs then buy again. That’s the move no sarcasm of bs

It’s ridiculous.  Apparently we won’t need technology once the virus is gone. Who knew?
I think Apple’s impact is reflected in current guidance, and it was reflected this last quarter since INTC’s OEM sales are a quarter ahead of AAPL’s. It’s not a huge hit, AAPL is one of many OEM buyers
I still think that's debatable though. Sure if it's a life threatening situation you would include it, but depending on a situation, even if an object has drag, its not important enough to calculate it. 

Changing the window shape on an airplane, absolutely do the calcs, even if the change is minute. But if you changed the ribbing on a flap disc for a lighter product, you're not gonna start calculating the effect of the new ribbing's drag, right?

I mean not on COVID stocks but those will be a fire sale too once they reach their lows at the point where people realize the vaccine is way off and the virus is going to mutate.

Wow the people in this thread are getting dumber and dumber...you are the one talking about wedges too lol. I'm so confused what was so "controversial" about my first statement. All I'm saying is it has a strong correlation to QQQ. So if QQQ goes back up, it has a way better chance at going back up - and vice versa when it goes down.
Yup just like last time, I wonder if its going to pull something similar to last qtr. Sell off for a few weeks and then rally hard again
Agreed

This is accurate. Even without the vaccine, sooner or later Cubes would have to fill those gaps that it left in its leaping run up, this time. 

Everyone, including me, hoped they would keep leaping and we were cut down by the vaccine news. 

If you were stupid, like me, and didn’t sell Cubes and Arks yesterday, now you’re gonna see red for a few weeks, or months, but ultimately you’re gonna be okay and profitable. I agree with the OP that it is gonna be blue sky, except for surprises like anti-trust probes and shit, but there’s 0 chance of that happening before late 21 as the gov’t will have more important things to do, like orchestrating logistics around vaccines, getting the economy up and running. Covid will still be with us for 6 months or more, and it will be worse before it gets better.
hope so

They may get bought by another company. But not at the 7.50 asking price. The company was trading at 4.50 for an extended time before the pump.

Yea it definitely not going back to 300 at least 2 or 3 more years but I can see it go to 220 before it drop back to 180
I've been doing that, save a house I like, next day or two goes to pending to sold.
Lol it literally moves with QQQ most days...it's like one of the top 8 components of it. I'm not sure you understand how correlations work, which is funny since you are talking about some bs TA stuff like wedges.

I lost $2 on calls bought midday right before it went to $77.99. Get out. She’s going to $72.
Sure you do. If you watch Jim Cramer and you bet against everything he tells you to invest in, you could’ve caught zoom, BYND, Microsoft, BABA at the top for ridiculous earnings. Also, I invested in oil after watching him say, “don’t invest in oil.” My calls were +2,000% when I sold them. Watch Cramer and bet against him.

Bears, if you loved “Pandemic Puts”, just wait until you try the latest product from Ursa Major!

Introducing “Coup Puts”! An opportunity once thought  to be impossible now can be yours. No longer will you have to invest in short-term economic downturns for the greatest country on earth. Instead, now you can invest in the fall of the greatest country on earth! You’ll just have to remember to sell them as 1000 baggers before Allied Forces dissolve the market entirely!

“Coup Puts: Rome fell; Washington can, too!”

TA shows it was going sub 400. I predicted 370 about a month ago. I feel dumb for not capitalizing on it.

Still has a gap to fill from earnings but this will go back to $500 soon.

I just saw this on Earning Whisper. Well considering they had a 15% run up this week, and negative earnings, investors able to pull out tomorrow and small growth in comparison to last year, it should tank 10% tomorrow before market, especially if market is down.

If it ain’t made any money by Thu afternoon, and theta hasn’t raped it into worthlessness, I plan to sell that shit before the standard Friday dump fest.

Bro if TSLA retests the 360-380 range, especially the lower 360s (due to market sell off, not actual news) I would definitely without a doubt suggest leaps on that shit. It'll print for free money. I see TSLA being an easy $500 in 2021. So if you are happy with that kind of return and you can get in at that price, go for it.

I think the problem is the big safe stocks like TSLA AMZN NVDA and SPY too they aren't as MEME as your other stocks like NIO GME etc. The returns aren't as wild. But a good way to blow up your account is to go after those Meme stocks  lol. Greed is a crazy thing isnt it.
It’s in the upper left corner above the graph. I was just thinking the same thing earlier today. Kind of annoying .
Everyone calling Tesla a boomer stock is exactly why it will yolo to $500 end of month

Terminal velocity of a human body is 53 m/s or 118mph.
Man, you're so close, but you just keep missing the point. As you well note, the salt is useful in and of itself, which is why it has value and could be used as money. I get what you're saying about it being devalued as a side effect of being replaced by other methods of preservation. The point is not the specific commodity being used as a store of value, which seems to be what you're getting hung up on. The point is that fiat currency in and of itself is not a store of value, and creating more fiat currency does not create more value.
I pray you are right

Are people seriously freaked out about a 1% AH drop in NIO. I've been trading in and out of this for months - NIO would regularly do a 10% intraday move -dumping for no reason and mooning for no reason too. Can't believe I got bored of holding the shares and sold in August for $14. Should have YOLOd my entire portfolio in NIO shares and calls.

Picked up CHGG 1/21 $75 calls and BKNG $1500 Puts because these idiots think covid vaccine will be out soon and trave/l schools will go back to normal.

It's insane how this market is reacting to headlines with not a single thought put into what the headline actually says

To be fair the information control campaign has been virtually entirely in Biden's favor leading up to, and after, the election.

Highly doubt it because this stock never goes the way I want, but my calls and put credit spreads would appreciate it

Just google lmnd earnings and look around. Also on their website they released stuff. Didn't look too bad tbh
Pigs get slaughtered
The one thing you *could* do is if you can somehow make the legal argument RH didn't allow you to actually exercise your long puts, you could have a "case" (in quotes since it would be a long case that probably requires like a civil court rather than an email chain). But I'm gonna guess that RH must have something written in their agreement that says they do allow you to exercise your puts explicitly. 

Anyways tough luck sorry man. However best of luck to you going forward. I'm long tech so I lost what you made 😂
Just to revisit this, Amazon sold 10Bish during Prime days. BABA sold something like 55B in the first few hours of singles day. It’s a riskier Amzn with a substantially bigger, locked in market. I don’t think there is a single 500B+ cap, growth oriented company with a more reasonable valuation
I mean I bought some last week and then sold it two days later and had a good return. But I sold it as soon as it hit $41. Definitely not holding it.

This was all from TAN. One $60 10/16 call bought for $40, one $65 11/20 call purchased for $40, and ten $70 11/20 calls purchased for $350 all on August 5th.
Thats just how the market works now bro I hate it. Its like hypebeasts all wanting the same shit. Crayon lines mean nothing. Resistance levels are starting to mean less.

So can someone explain something to me. When MMs sell a stock they’re technically shorting it since they don’t have a stake in the marketplace. But how can they short it without having already borrowed those shares? Do shorting rules apply differently, or do they only complete a trade (shorting and buying at the same time) when they have a seller on the other side of their bid position?
Yea sure not arguing that; i agree

I'm also sure that fanatical BLMer/Antifa activists running the polling in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Atlanta would do anything they possibly could to remove Trump from office when they saw the election wasn't going Biden's way late Tuesday night 11/3/2020.

MMs keeping the market flat should be ashamed
i mean if she helps you first, then go for it. not the other way around tho bro, dont fall for it
eric cartman, is that you?
So it’s gonna come crashing down after a decent squeeze?
A situation like this requires a deeper analysis, which, I am not going to make here. Because it's fucking WSB and because here it's 1:20 am and I am tired.

Quickly: It's obvious that I am not excited at thinking children having to work, the point is that they and their families are well more than happy to do that, rather than starving or having to deal in black and violent markets for example
Anyone here using black magic to boost their portfolio? I think I set up my piss altar wrong -_-

Meanwhile the waiting line of others trying to launch is a mile long.

Naw just been doing it long enough. It’s not that fucking hard to do the bare minimum this place used to be capable of that. Honestly just trying to help you out to make a bit more.

Well months ago I bought 600 contracts of PSX 11/20 $75c but I lost hope for those. If they end up ITM I’ll cry

Midday today I bought 100 contracts of the XLE 11/13 $34c which already went ITM

I’m still pounding the table for refiners. Phillips 66 is stupidly undervalued and crushed earnings almost breaking even, it should not be down this much even after the big move. I almost bought PSX $60c calls to flip tomorrow but went with XLE

VLO or PSX would be my favorites here following this news

Yeah cause this year interest rates went down so everyone refinanced but now after they are down and everyone did it it won’t grow so much imo that’s also why growth is not priced in cause unless interest rates go lower or smt they can’t keep up this growth lol but yeah the other companies don’t make sense either lol

Matched with a cute college babe on Tinder. To my surprise, she messaged me first! After an hour of small talk, she tells me she’s $70 short for rent and if I could help her. She didn’t say she’d give up the wap but I’m assuming it’s implied. I help her, she helps me. 

Tbh $70 is pretty cheap if you’re paying for prime fresh wap. I’ve known people who sold their wap for a bag of hot cheetos.

Bought JKS calls at open on 9/21. I was confident that it was going to pay very well, but never could've imagined what would happen. My rationale at the time was that Solar was fucking mooning all over the place, but JKS hadn't moved at all and nobody seemed to ever hear of it. Word was their ER was going to crush, so I figured people would be thrilled to get in on a solar stock that hadn't been touched at all, since all the others were getting overbought.

Even with selling some too early I think it was a 20 bagger overall. I don't think I'll get another chance like that. Fuckin sucks though because I was new to options and barely had any money at the time to put into the play.

Paper trading is misleading because you know it's not real money, and your emotional attachment makes a huge difference. It's great that you didn't blow your portfolio. 

The other thing is that we went from a March low to all time highs. Anyone buying stocks made a killing, specially people with no experience. (As compared to us smart-asses that lost with options).
Sir this is a Wendy’s
It’s not expected to make sense🤡also why we dumped eod,  just look at all the others pton, all tech, pypl just know to buy in on shares of when it dips because you will be getting 7%+ interest and with the influx of immigration incoming the dividend will be safe for a while.  The stock will be up in a couple of months buy the dip expect $18-19

From what I understand, NKLA doesn't have a lot of money. They have debt and have committed tons of cash to building their factory in order to make trucks so they can fulfill all the fake orders from fake companies. It doesn't seem like they have an actual way to make any money since they don't really have any of the stuff they claimed.

They can always raise more money by issuing more stock, but that will pretty quickly become self-defeating if they try it.

IMO that was an excellent dip to buy. WFH is here to stay for major companies. Even if it won't be 100% in a post covid world, both employees and employers understand now that it's feasible to tele-work. Advantages and disadvantages but definitely not the death of a company.

I mean, it did go to 30 recently. Just bide your time. Everyone said it would crash into oblivion, and initially and momentarily it did, but them buying a billion back of their shares displays confidence that investors latch onto. Also, you know Pelosi ain’t losin money. I’m holding my 22.5 11/20 calls for at least a few days. Could easily be wrong, but betting on RKT is an extremely risky bet. Shouldn’t bet on em if you can’t afford the loss, unless you’re some kind of a retard or something.

Could be used as a hedge possibly. Or sometimes the person short the contract wants to cover their position before expiration for whatever reason. Or someone has a credit or debit spread and wants to close out before expiration. A contract can’t physically go under .01 but if it could even $100 otm spy calls same day would be worth something. I remember once there was a huge move on Tesla intraday and the otm same day contract went from practically worthless to worth thousands

I'm doubling down on my cloud stocks. Fact is COVID has actually hurt more of them than helped. COVID being out of control is causing IT shops to clamp down on spending.

Sure the pure COVID plays like Five9 or Zoom may be in trouble. But a company like Fastly or DDOG? They'll be fine, and actually even better if COVID backs off. It gets harder and harder to convince a CIO that 3 tenths of a second matter when their budget is cut 15%.

+163.3% Y/Y revenue though:

https://www.benzinga.com/news/earnings/20/11/18309890/rocket-companies-revenue-up-163-in-record-q3

also, PEG of 0.34 indicates the growth doesn't seem to be priced in:

https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=rkt

there are also other companies in the same space that have a higher price, and higher PE ratios:

https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=ind_mortgagefinance

i don't know. looks like it's undervalued somewhat. $28 to $30 seems more accurate, maybe higher. i have 2 measly calls, perhaps i'm biased

at the same time, markets do whatever they want
And ups still hasn’t recovered.........
Depends on the day, but I’d say this year has been above average for price volatility.

Some days were average

REEEEnn by open.
Thought about it but liquidity seemed low
When in doubt, yolo
Yeah definitely the safest plan. Stocks don’t usually expire or go to zero. I was so close to buying AMC and CCL leaps for the past few weeks and looks like I missed out there haha. I’ll definitely go long soon, but until then, I’ll keep 1. using theta strats and 2. being a bear. 

If TSLA retests the 380 range but doesn’t break, I’ll buy a leap or two. Maybe it’ll come back up and make me enough to buy the real shares!
Sold my 162.5 calls yesterday morning for $600 profit. Could have been $30k. Woopsm
Yeah. No way in fuck they announce a 1 billion share buyback, ridiculous guidance, a solid moat, great earnings, and STILL tank.

Of course not. This is a casino
Go download historical data from yahoo finance and you can see for yourself exactly how the market moves when volatility is low
Right there with you. It pisses me off when futures have moved a quarter of a percent and people here act like it’s down 3%
1% was a huge move
limit up and down multiple times a night
It's like you people forget the insane rally that happened a few days ago. Qqq can't go up 3% every day.
no
Sure, just make sure to park that uhaul in front of the house next door, need to throw some cats off my shoulders.

This stock market is completely out of energy. If it doesn't drop then it will stay flat and IV crush you. Either way you are screwed.

Jesus fucking christ shoot me.
I think maybe it already did. Makes sense why it rallied more than expected and then pulled back the last couple days...
Why even be cash game we had such volatility the last two weeks how do you make no plays lol. Some where pretty easy like the fall on Monday...
Yes, because there will always be a shift back to value. And that shift will come from tech.  
  
Wait, shit, what sub am I in?

Do they chum in my mouth
No.  The early release was intended for the Original Holders.  BTW - there's only 5 million shares tied up in early release (see below).  The 30-trading day period doesn't start until Nov 1 (150 days after close of Business Combination).  The Original Holders were restricted to 1 year, but this early release clause allows them to sell on Dec 1.  

The bulk of the 161M shares were restricted based on 180 days - which simply expires Dec 1.

*Approximately 5 million additional shares of our common stock held by the Original Holders may become eligible for sale beginning on or after December 1, 2020 pursuant to the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, depending on the price of our common stock* ***during the 30-trading day period commencing on or after November 1, 2020 at the time***\*.\*

If I'm reading this correctly that only applies to a portion of different groups. It seems there are different restrictions for different groups. There is also a lot of mention of "certain exceptions" in that text, which I do not have the time or motivation to look into. 

You can trust OP did the digging or figure it out yourself. Might be worth looking at.
I can show you the stocks I’ve invested with the receipts. The stocks are real just not my “real” money

You’re absolutely right, however in particular given the past struggles of cannabis, anything that presents as negative sends investors for the hills. The only thing that’ll stabilize the market is the US chilling the hell out and loosening legislation.

brings up a good point - hedging WSB. You can make really good money by trying to predict what the autistic fucks in this sub are doing rather than the market as a whole. Buy a ridiculous position early and all the autists in here will drive up the premiums. Gotta think like a retard to exploit a retard. There's big money in that, did that earlier in the year (which feels like a decade ago since it was pre-corona) with $SPCE.

I have to confess. I can’t keep it inside anymore. 

I’m the reason the stocks have been so shit. 

My first day in the stock market was September 2nd when I bought 2 shares of Tesla, 1 share of Nvidia, and 3 shares of zoom after watching everyone make so much money wishing I was apart of all of that. 

Everytime I have sold we have mooned and everytime I have bought we have dumped. 

I can’t sell my shares until the morning so expect a bloody morning but comes 9:30 I am selling and you should expect to be green EOD and moon for many months to come following my exit of the market.

Hey man, take it from me who is now holding BABA and TSLA after being in profit 2 days ago. Some profit is better than bags or losses.

In regards to the Nasdaq, the downwards movement is definitely not finished yet. There may be a bounce soon and individual stocks may fluctuate but the index as a whole still has more to move. SPY/SNP I think should also be following a similar trend but probably not a big a sell off as Nasdaq.

I think the safer plan if you can get more money together is definitely going stocks or leaps. It's just less stressful and if you can swing trade the ranges you can make some decent money. I mean just look at Aug Sep Oct Nov. If I had just been patient and somehow lucked into timing the markets, I would of made an easy 40k on stocks. Instead im down about 7k from my ATH profits lol. 
I grabbed some Nvidia at 511 today. Earnings next week. Have about 15% cash left for a final buy in as things get lower. Nvidia has decent support at 470-480

Couple of things. One, I never said value investing or anything about it. Two, you have knowledge about financial instruments, statements, etc., YOLO or not. The fact that you know what QE is a prime example of this.

> Because other alternatives like gold were found that operated better as money. 

No, salt was money long after gold was money. And salt was more useful.  If you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna, its market value is determined by what someone within about five miles of you is willing to pay for it. But, if you're standing in Barcelona holding a dead tuna and a kilo of salt, suddenly its market value is determined by what someone anywhere on earth is willing to pay for it. If you can't find a buyer, shove it in the cellar and wait for the market to change, or don't sell it at all and eat it a year from now, when it will have lost little or no of its value. You've turned the transient, local, rapidly-declining value of your fish into permanent, global, stable value instead.

This massively increases its potential value and shows the true value of salt in the pre-modern world: turning locally-tradeable, perishable goods into globally-tradeable, nonperishable goods. This is why salt was able to account for, at various times, 60% of the cargo on the Erie canal, 50% of the French king's income, and the primary state revenue source in Imperial China.

Salt wasn't used anymore because it devalued. So much so that I can throw it away now and not even care. 

Same thing with gold. It devalues. Then it gains value for no particular reason. You can't base an economy on that.

As for your second paragraph, you utterly misunderstand how the money supply works. But that's for another conversation.

You know. I got fucked last year for 30k on Acb. So what do I do? Fomo in. I’m up a little bit and KNEW to buy puts because they would fuck up. Jokes on me, the real fuck up.

Bulls think yesterday was a red day when they bought SPY calls at the top.
BRKB is an investment/holding company. Buybacks of their own stock signal they can’t find anything worth investing in, which is a bearish signal for those kinds of companies. GME doing it signifies they don’t need cash and they are in a strong position.
waiiiiittt, jack ma said xi will fall? r u serious? and i have baba calls?
What do we want? 

Circuit Breakers!

When do we want them?

NOW!
I live in Northern jersey if you're from this area. I go to the one in Hackensack.

I like trading COST options because of low premium and the stock moves too slowly for my liking but holding COST shares is not bad. My bet is they'll pay a special dividend before March 2021. The cash pile is too big.
Bruh. I dropped out of the 8th grade.
Would hazard quite a bit longer than you, since I am not positing asking for advice for what to do with my options on them.

Like I said support was higher than I expected and I mentioned dilution for ACB in the Weekend thread, along with saying that ACB and Canopy needed good earnings to support momentum.  Which is why I sold all my long Canopy positions yesterday.  All of this is in my comment history.  Shit you go far enough back there is a conversation talking about buying the dip off Apha earnings if they missed for the election and canopy earnings after.

Rule #7
What who where
Futures looking like shit
it has been said that bond holders were the big shorts on the equity tryna push the price to zero. forcing a technical default. (not sure about all this)

those are the ones that didn't want to exchange in the first place. so maybe you are right. they will hold. but it's obvious by now that company isn't going bankrupt so i don't know why they'd still hold..
Yeah I have the same setup it does help a lot. I found the bear hybrid mattress to be the best for people that are over 200 lbs I bought and returned over 7 mattresses before I settled for that. I have a tempur topper on top of it. I also have reallly nice shredded memory foam pillows and a weighted blanket. I take my sleep setup very seriously lol
G U H
Ahhh that sweet tingling feeling that tomorrow you will make it big, and then tomorrow comes and disappoints you again 😢
Makes sense haha. I only got 5 days for something about BLM. 

I sold my puts too early, at like 353. We bounced up so I bought some 350P 11/20 that I’m holding. Wish I could have sold at 351, I was up a decent amount but I have no day trades on that account still. Bought a few more EOD to lower my cost basis, hopefully we get some good downward movement tomorrow so I can let them go. 

My mid-long term plan is go long on some stocks and leaps but it’s hard to justify buying in right now, I think we’ll have another correction at some point, and hopefully I can buy then.
You right you right mah bad
Don’t worry you can take regeneron and be as strong as 🥭😂😂😂

Nio is a meme right now, but when the exuberance dies off it will fit that bill. I've got quite a bit of stock (cost avg. 18) and leaps with plans to buy more if it crashes and burns in the next month. 

While Tesla has a head start, battery swapping tech is the way of the future for getting average Joe's to buy into the EV concept.
Yeah that’s the ironic part. They’re always shout communism when someone mentions european style universal healthcare while the US actually spends more tax money per capita on health.

Because other alternatives like gold were found that operated better as money. You've continued to not understand the reasons for sound money, whatever the commodity is that backs it. Salt and gold are just examples of commodities that have operated as money.

Every "recovery" is more printing and artificially lower interest rates. The EU has pushed their rates lower, countries are going into negative interest rates to encourage more spending. We have a completely different worldview, and clearly, no one is going to change their opinion here.

No need to be toxic brother, I'm just trying to put together DD and I gladly welcome any dialogue or criticism.

I think your numbers are wrong. If you look at the latest 10k ending August 30, 2020, the cash and cash equivalent is 12,277. 

Regardless, I don't see the point you're trying to make. Do you think if a company has similar cash and short term AP, then the company is cash poor or something? It's not as simple as that and actually far from the truth. Most of that accounts payable is offset by the merchandise inventory of $12,242.

You should look at the cash flow statements. In 2020, it had $8.8 billion from operating activities and if you net out the outflow from investing and financing, it's still $4 billion positive. 

The cash flow statement is actually the most useful in DD. In 2020, it paid about $1.3 billion in cash dividends. Net Income is 4 billion so it's retaining about 66% of it's earnings. 

I stand by my DD. I'm also a CPA.

Yeah, I got mine for $1.80 when it was rocketing. My research into sell-off on bad earnings from investors as the lock-up period was correct. I think they gonna sell massively, get it below IPO price and then reinvest, that's what I would do if I was a millionaire.

Not sure if it will help, but try softer or harder mattress to see if it will help you feel better. I had some back and neck issues and was in constant pain for over a year until I found a tempur pedic mattress padding that I put on top of extra firm mattress. That real helped a ton with my pain. Try different pillows as well. Experiment, you never know.
It really didn’t need to go that high to begin with. It’s bizarre that the vaccine announcement affected it this much, though.

The problem is a massive portion of their client base is several individual customers. If said customers decide to go with other options that could prop up in the future they are fucked.

Timing was a bit off. I think I got it around 67 ish and it was 2.80 for the put. I think with a potential sell off from investors bc of the lock up period it could very easily go sub 55, if not more

nio squad price prediction for eom and eoy?
No opinion on ride. SPY <300, fuck I trend bear but that’s a stretch. VXX 20c is a toss up, depends on what you initially paid. VXX trends down and occasionally spikes. I played VXX heavy for election and got burnt, not sure if you’re predicting a major catalyst in the next two weeks, I’d exit that. Rkt I’d hold
I know we are retarded but not actually this retarded. Leaps are important for tax breaks leaps are 366 days+. It’s a relatively big difference in the pricing and when to look to scalp.

It feels more like running naked through a corn field, backwards, at midnight.
Was on Delorean stock. Bought 88 shares.
PLTR is nice. I got it at the open. Honestly don’t think it’s worth $14 until next year based on the underlying, but the market doesn’t give two shits about that. I expect it to waver around $12 for about a year with small spikes right before earnings
All in OTM 0DTE
I just priced 12/24 $320c it's $9460. Wouldn't call that free.
Love how Feb 25 27 and 28 are on there - just before the huge retail trading boom. Right before the dip became a flash crash. The days I should’ve cashed out along with Smart Money.

Be honest, are you obese?
vaccine isn't ready either... and the whole reason a lot of these tech stocks that shot up mooned *because* they were unaffected. The delay in return to normalcy is huge, combined with the fact that the thesis for these tech stocks remains intact regardless of what happens with COVID. You think all the BECKYs out there using Pinterest are gonna stop using pinterest just because there is a vaccine? Nah...

BA is a sore spot for me. I bought shares originally at $320 or $330 right before Covid hit. I revenge traded it averaging down with more than i'd like to admit until we hit $90, I averaged out to $145 , but then it popped to like $210 or so and I was able to sell half for profit and now I hold a reasonable 200 shares. I'm holding them long term, but man. it could have been bad.
Only 2% of my portfolio, but I'll take it. Wish I followed through on buying a call too
X  GO NNN  G IVE  IT  T O  Y A !
It’s getting more and more uncontested tbh.

Ah my bad, I misread the initial comment, if anything we are on the same page
Guys please take care of your health. I'm not even 30 yet and I have a connective tissue disorder which makes my back and joints hurt nearly constantly. My digestive tract is fucked. My sleep is trash. I'm tired 99% of the time. I'm going to need an aortic valve replacement before I'm 40 cause of my enlarged aorta. Treasure your health while you have it, mine didn't last very long and now I barely have enough energy to do shit. I've never had a girlfriend because I don't really go outside and meet people because it takes so much energy that it impacts my work. I pretty much work, trade, and watch twitch/tv  and read. Thankfully I can work from home or I'd be even more miserable.

interesting:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Loans

- "Quicken Loans, originally Rock Financial, was founded in 1985 by Dan Gilbert, Lindsay Gross, Gary Gilbert."

- "In January 2018, Quicken Loans became the nation's largest mortgage lender."

- "Quicken Loans has consistently been awarded the highest customer satisfaction rating among primary mortgage originators the U.S. for 10 straight years, as well as being one of top 20 companies to work for and a top pick for overall best mortgage lenders, according to Consumers Advocate."

- "On July 7, 2020, it was announced that Quicken Loans had filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to start the process of taking the company public under the name Rocket Companies."

- "On August 6, 2020, Rocket Companies, Inc. went public under the symbol RKT."
If you held through Monday, you're a beast.
I'm tired of seeing people whining about how the market is acting like *"we will never use tech again"* when you look at tech and Amazon for instance is ***still up 70% for the year***, just down from 86%.

You bought calls on a frothy valuation, eat shit. Learn from your mistake instead of whining about the market being "wrong".

Thermofisher for -80 freezers, logistics like AmerisourceBergen for -80 transit.

I said it in the mega thread and I'll say it here too: don't think that this is a clear winner. The GSK/Oxford trial results are to be released soon, and their vaccine is viable for storage at 5°C. The Pfizer/BioN vaccine data suggests other vaccines targeting the spike protein of the virus are viable, and if those vaccines don't have the logistical and storage nightmare of the PFE one, guess which one will be favoured. You might get a run up on -80 companies, but I would sell out ahead of the GSK/Oxford results release as a precaution
Why are u here, all dd is after the fact

I think the specific example is shoes, in part because of the relative upkeep requirements, general necessity, and shirts become rags. Cheap sandals are quickly and cheaply manufactured while being repairable and well suited to their environment. Shoes wear out, hurt the local cobbler, and generate waste. No one is gone because of an injection of goods, it just isn't very practical and that amount of money is far more useful spent elsewhere on things like infrastructure or hardy tools that you can't make locally. You want to enable growth, not fill a temporary luxury transplanted from the western world. Good charities enable this and work with local groups to figure out key needs.

It's definitely more expensive than meat, but that's only because meat is crazy subsidized. I'd cook with it at home, and try a couple brands. My roommates were on a vegetarian streak for a while, they cooked burgers one night and I honestly didn't even remember that they were using fake meat until I was half way done with it, and I still couldn't tell the difference.
Yes, mostly on vaccine news but also election news. While tech stocks rallied post-covid, many travel, manufacturing and banking related stocks hadn’t recovered yet.

I would suspect that there will be a pull-back before some of these go up again when people realize we’re further away from a widely vaccine than they might think.

And, no, I don’t own any of them. I only buy stocks that lose money.

Any other AAPL leap holders annoyed with AAPL?
All of it.... I lost all of it....
About $3.50 of my money and the rest is someone else’s money who’s dumb enough to let me margin this much.
it took off because these guys keep buying it from each other. Nio as a company will do fine but at a $56B market cap? 34 P/S?? Negative income, negative FCF, negative everything??? It's hilarious how no one in here cares about valuation
Yep on Valero’s quarterly phone call they said the margins they had for producing biodiesel were actually better than normal diesel from crude oil. PSX is also converting a refinery into biodiesel and I believe they’re the ones that have a joint venture for hydrogen stations in Europe... even OXY today announced they’re going net zero in 20 years. Lots of green talk

Either way BP’s “we’re so green now” crap won’t make me forget their Gulf spill. How convenient, crude oil gets whacked and they’re masking job cuts and terrible reserves as “transitioning”. I’ll reevaluate them later when oil fully recovers but until then I’m screaming fake news
What ever amount they let me lose
Same :(
Did you just refer to General Electric a “dying company”?

lmao homie would have a heart attack if he had to hike up a hill to go to war idk bout those comparisons brotha
Real talk, my main one I'm eyeing is $F. I know I know they're not in a super stable place at the moment, but they've restructured a decent amount, they're providing monthly sales data bc the new ceo said he wants to be more open with Wallstreet, heavily trimming under performing models, investing heavily into ev's.

Position: currently only one 6/18/21 9c and it's paid off fairly well so far. Only option that didn't go under today for me. Sorry for poor. Ideally I'd buy slightly otm/atm 2022/2023 leaps because the cost basis is so low, and you can always roll profits into higher strike calls. 

Leaps are CHEAP because boomer stock, but once Ford really gets going with ev's I believe all the retail investors are going to be throwing money at it. If ev's go well for them in the next year I'm expecting Ford 15+ end of 21, 20+ end of 22.

If they hit with ev's they have a massive name behind them, and I could see them popping. I expect volitility along the way though, and I honestly don't know if they've bottomed out this year.

Tldr if you have money stonks, if you're a poor like me atm leaps are fair cheap still, but they are trending up, so get in before they're too expensive.

Duh, but if he says it the masses will believe
It was just a basic market mimic. There hasn't been a single negative report on NIO. The tech sell off basically triggered it. But you know what? Today was actually a good thing. Because the weaker hands got out. A lot of real concrete shareholders bought that dip today. That unbreakable bottom is getting higher each time.

> Datadog beat estimates for Q3 thanks to solid demand for its cloud monitoring software.

> $DDOG dropped 9% after-hours.


> Rocket Companies' Q3 earnings came in better than expected after the bell. The company also announced a $1B share repurchase authorization. 

> $RKT fell 3.5% after-hours. 


> Lyft earnings are still in the dumpster

> $LYFT rose 5% after-hours.

Honestly these offerings aren’t always bad. Nio did the same thing 5 months ago and people said the same.

Also it tells you what a good buy in because if someone is willing to buy millions of shares at a certain price why wouldn’t you buy it for a bit less?

I'm on board.  Mostly a 2 quarter blip.  Intel 10nm has higher transistor density than TSMC 7nm that AMD uses.  Get 10nm fixed in Q1 and all will be rosy.
ARM is the much bigger threat to both intel and AMD.  Getting rid of x86 bloat means faster more power efficient processors for all platforms.
I trust intel diversification into other market segments with their much lager cash flow.  AMD is just starting to follow intel with xilinx acquisition.

He has no case. I went over this with those Tesla short put holders who were assigned that non-inclusion day. Any option can be exercised at any time before 5:30 Friday. Any ITM option is auto-exercised (the norm), but you can exercise an OTM option if you want. Usually you don't want to since it's just losing money to do so, but in this case since BIIB was halted and it was clearly going to open like much lower than 300, you want to exercise OTM puts too. You do so by giving an override of instruction explicitly.

RH isn't liable. The OP u/statusnow didn't exercise his OTM puts. He only got assigned the OTM puts that were exercised by the MM. Its tough luck for him but it's his fault for not knowing the rules. 90% of wsb people have no idea how option expiration even works so this doesn't surprise me there are so many losses.  In order for the OP to actually only get the "max loss (what he thought)," he needed to exercise his long puts. Simple as that.

Also, have a good think before you put all your money in this. The GSK/Oxford vaccine results will be released soon and their vaccine is stable at 5°C. If there vaccine is or is close to as promising as the Pfizer/BioN one, their vaccine will be favoured due to reduced logistic and storage costs.

Every channel wants you to be afraid. When you pick a channel you’re just picking which things you enjoy getting scared about the most. 

Tbh the biz networks have the best news. People there are only afraid of losing money, so they tend to report the actual events of the day in super literal terms and don’t spend time on things that won’t affect life or business.

Also why I love this sub.
Def not the type to admit failure. Lol

I don’t get it, GM is furthest behind but the market loves em.
Yes, I am including Current and LT Leases, because they are fixed payments due much like debt. Here are their current debt (as of 8/1/2020:

$60M ST borrowing

$200M in current portion of LT debt

$215M in LT debt

$220M in current portion of leases

$475M in LT leases

Even taking out leases, total debt is $475M vs. cash of $735M. Not much cushion

You do realize the only reason they are cashflow positive in LTM Aug 1 2020 is because they decrease inventory by $480M without replenishing. Maybe they are doing a better job managing inventory and need less in the future, or at some point they will need to increase inventory again if they want to sell things in-stores / online that isn't digital

I am not trying to scare anyone off this position. I am just saying hoping for them to announce some massive share buyback is wishful thinking

Yeaaaa. I have dec calls. So I'm not worried, i believe this company will gradually go up
Lmfao this.

At this point I’m hoping the vaccine fails smfh
Been there man. Those 1DTE contracts are tricky. It seems every time I sold for a loss they recovered to at least break even and then when I hold them I get destroyed and take a big L like you. 

As lame as it sounds I joined a $60 a month discord room that does algo levels for SPY and it has immensely helped me. Having a general guideline of when to buy those contracts is half the battle
so 200p 2022 then?

Bro idk how many times I have to tell you that I don’t have any money in Pfizer, let alone weeklies. Fauci, like everyone else, said it would be a logistical challenge but it’s not gonna prevent people from getting the vaccine. It’s expected to be available to high risk groups by December and the general public by April. Straight from the horses mouth

So you know how in a normal bull market we're usually green and there's sudden corrections of red every once in a while? 

We've been the opposite of that since September (AKA A BEAR MARKET)-- a market that usually goes down with some rapid corrections up when people get too bearish (like election time when everyone had puts or vix calls).

What makes you think Zoom is worthless?  Curious... because I think that most enterprise businesses are not going to stop using unified collaboration tool.  Zoom was always aimed at enterprises, they just happened to shift to personal because of coronavirus.  Remote Work for businesses are here to stay, its hard to argue that it can't be done anymore so there will be more workers at home and less money in leasing out commercial space.  Lot of businesses do not want to get sucked into Microsoft grips so Slack and Zoom are the way to go.

Wait, so RKT did pump after 2? Dammit, sold calls too early. It felt like it was about to drill.

Which it did, just didn't think it had another pump in it.
Sounds like the same bullshit I used to hear from you cucks, right before I blew right past you and made my first million.
The market has moved into value stocks. You know, the ones you've all been saying are garbage boomer stocks that are dead because p/e doesnt matter anymore? It does. I'm riding the green wave with stocks like EBIX that are up 42% now.

When’s ur expiration on RKT? Because unless it’s 11/13 (and you’re retarded) it might actually break even or better.

what research drove you away from fisker?
I'm fine with the latter. Pay the people!! We can't all just sit at home, we'll die. Someone needs to do the deliveries.
I have AMZN and TSLA put credit spreads expiring next week that are right ATM today. It’s always so tempting to open more when it dips like this... so I did. 

I’ve also got LOW earnings calls, just in case.
actually fellas, just realized that I actually am not all the way broke! I am using parents money -150k ontop of the 40k i originally put in, and ive only lost 25k of it on SHOP, AMZN, W, and BABA longs over these past two days! I thought i lost more because ive had separate accounts before, and I made 25k on a dif account (after tax 20k) which is a bump i forgot about... so i am not down 44k, im down 24k... HUGE, i still got some money to my name, prolly 10k cuz i been spending recently...point is I am less depressed! no one gives a fuck, but im so glad that my journey hasn't ended with you fuckers, I know im boutta hit this big fd recovery on amazon to valhalla
DcShake
Why come tho? I mean i have fds so i am prob fuxked.  am prob fucked. But it is only down like 2%  they didn't beat by too much. The buyback is super bullish imo. I bet it go up to 30s soon, which is around ipo price. And rkt is volatile so good options stock. Sucks it didnt go in the bulls direction but still a good earnings
I can’t imagine that anyone here uses a bloomberg terminal.
Yea, tomorrow should have some nice volume, could be a solid day. This news just shows that GameStop is on a road to a comeback and are making great progress. If I was a short I’d be very scared, but knowing GME shorts, they won’t back down, we will see tomorrow!
Yeah I drink their coffee.
Would it be more believable to say that I'm an actual Chinese person?
Bloomberg terminals are used for smart well trained traders who know what they're doing and probably have fiber connections that are adjacent to the Wall Street data centers so they can sell off shares when you buy calls. 

2k ain't shit if your trading billions of dollars.

I wanted to buy a few shares for fun. Didn’t check it was just like YOLO weed 

Unfortunately I did it on my phone. Trading212 has a pretty high default for me on that stock. So I bought 3000 ACB shares and didn’t see how many before confirming. 

Today I’m still holding it’s been 2 days and -15k

And I still don’t know what to do.

I feel like holding and hoping some miracle will happen and I can break even or close with a smaller loss.

I was up 50k since august and this shit will 100% kill all my gains
Honestly, fucking a bear with a 3" penis is not easy. You're barely even getting past the fur.
Look at Vega of the option legs (how much price will drop per 1% decline in IV) and assume IV is cutting at least in half (I’m assuming you did weekly). This will be extremely conservative. Don’t forget about calculating ur theta too!

TBH its really impossible to say.  Personally, I think the latest it could happen is the Q4 ER (reported in March), since that will be the first quarter of console sales and probably the first quarter where they post a profit in a long time.

We could start running on various news pieces though.  A sony or nintendo deal, though it is pretty likely they have that with one of them now, I'd guess nintendo. They mentioned having revenue sharing agreements in previous quarters, but never specified.  Another stock buyback, or dividend could do it.  An announcement that Cohen is actively involved with the company now.  There are more things than this but its all i can think of atm.  Tons of things could start triggering mini squeezes.  

&#x200B;

Don't try to play short dated stuff though unless you're ok with losing it, best bet is to get april calls and shares until it starts its serious uptrend again.  Stuck in a rut atm

The problem is they did keep buying. The fluctuations on ACB is actually retarded. Atleast TLRY or CGC if it dumps it’s a slow climb up. ACB if it dumps it’ll do a split, moon a bit then do an offering rinse and repeat

Actually, they’re expect to lose 17 cents a share according to most estimates. 

There’s no way to know. Everything is priced in already. The information will be discounted and adjusted after earnings and the final price will settle accordingly. Sun is hot. 

My guess is that NIO priced at a point where a perfect ER is necessary. Even the smallest blip will cause the price to tank. 

I’ve been through several ER like that. I had FB when they had earnings that beat estimates, but tanked hard bc of fewer users or slower projected growth. Happened twice, most recently the last FB earnings.

Ok I made my money and got out of fisker after some research 🧐 what’s the next big play I’m missing ?
XLU $8k swing nov 4-9th all my money I had left 

Didn’t wake up in time and slept through the day

Robin Hood chart showed my profit was +$51k at peak 

I ended up holding through  when it was at $34k and now it’s at $25k and it’s increasing but slowly 

Still up but wowwwwww

Still can’t believe it
AH sigly green
LMND just released earnings apparently but call isn't until tomorrow pre-market. hopefully it starts to fade AH now

Where the fuck are all these stupid fucking cucks that were trying to get people to buy into ACB last week?
Yday puts on M

60k to 90k in 45mins
Opened at 8.7 or something then down to 7.7ish where I sold


Doesn’t fking matter tho cause getting fucked sideways by baba and amzn
“Buy TSLA” 🚀
Entered 12/18 FB calls today and picked up a couple SE calls towards the low of the day. 

CNR beat earnings and there was a lot of option activity that stuck but not reacting much to earnings.  My calls expire in March so perhaps can still hold. 

Also looks like JPow speaks on Thursday??
you spelled bearish wrong
Y’all ever had a girl shit on your dick?
Rip prpl. 😢

Bob tomorrow I will profit tremendously. IV went down after they announced earnings. What's it to you? Did you buy stock in this shit company? Theta isn't a problem neither will IV be when my puts have more intrinsic value than extrinsic. It won't matter. I will make my money many times over. Thank you. Good bye.
Oh god if AMD hit $88 tomorrow I'd die of an OD from all the drugs I consumed

they're only buying at 18 or lower if i read it right
I think the point is that tech is overvalue for the current valuation due to COVID. Hopefully you bought some leap call. Gl
Lol nice diamond handing them for a bigger pop?
I swear, are there any good news sources these days? When you're just regurgitating data it shouldn't be so hard. 

Been a terrible ass week for me though. Need my 12/18 24c that I bought for a dollar to go up so I don't have to tell my wife I lost money this year
Post your positions here or ban. 

ALGN 470C 11/13 for the possible gap up in Nasdaq.

BKNG 11/13 1900P. These bitches are up 200%. 
I need BKNG to shit the bed again.
I encourage it
JWN. Buy $20C or $22.5C April 2021.
I don't understand why somebody would buy that from you. Why do you need a new console on launch day especially when barely any games have been announced for it? What if the first run of xboxs is fucked up like 360s? Maybe they didn't know the difference between the two xboxs.

Everyone who saw the boom and bust of weed stocks tried to warn you guys not to hold past earnings for this very reason. 

Most weed stocks are terribly run with no control on cash flows. The writings were on the wall, heck if I was their management, I would take advantage of the dumb equity lemmings as well

On the other hand, I sold some covered calls on Friday a minute before close for $400. Those are now $5000. 😭

The context for this is much different. GME has a much smaller market cap, which combined with the short interest means that buybacks have a stronger effect compared to BRKB. I'm bullish BRKB, but GME is my play lol

Anyone playing DKNG for earnings?
3M and it pays these things called dividends.
I bought calls at the dip, hanging on for now. Their earning will send it back to 9.50 or up to $20 IMO, because no one knows what they do. If they show they’re expanding and taking on a diverse client group outside of military, I think it’ll bode well.

Xpev is a real company, with manufacturing and product lines, but who knows if the demand is there. There are a lot of chinese EV company's and some are gonna be M&A'd and some will not be viable, it's just picking horses at the moment and Tesla and NIO are the two betting favorites. But the new Polestars and Fiskers and Legacy brands could all gain market share as well. That Tesla can make a car for $30k that competes fairly well with porsches $120k EV is kind of crazy and NIO is in the same boat: high tech, low cost, self driving, battery swapping, the ingredients are all there but can they make the fried rice?

Ouxh
I'm scared this shit is gonna drop to penny stock status after earnings unless they announce some crazy shit like a deal with the WHO for covid tracing.
Yeah, I have been holding off on non-tech, but once vaccine news dropped I piled into non-tech. Everything but bank stocks are up for me.
I feel guilty making this much money the past 2 days on XOM.  Maybe I'll buy some green energy stocks to compensate like those losers buying carbon offsets for their private jets and yachts.

I regretted putting so little into this trade, but then I remembered that it was a random throwaway and I never would’ve guessed the outcome.
It's up almost 30% in two weeks and you're bleeding red?
This is has certainly been a learning experience for me, being a beginner in the trading game. I don’t have a whole lot of skin in the game and I’m glad I was still able to turn around some small gains. But man... that uptick would have been hella nice for me lol.

Rip
why did it go up
Bear fuk during night, bull fuk during light
no1 now
3-4 months if I'm making an aggressive play, otherwise I do LEAPS 1-2 years out.  I occasionally do options 1-2 months out if I'm anticipating a runup on news or some event, but I roll out after any decent gains, and never play a large percentage of my money on monthlies.  You never know when you'll get fucked like I did on Ali Baba.  Chinese regulators double fucked me in 2 weeks and I'm about to lose $25k from my November 20 calls.  I usually never go that hard on a short term play, but I figured between the ANT IPO, Singles Day, and earnings it was a sure thing/golden ticket.  Fuck me.  And my $50k in LEAPS are bleeding out too.  In general weeklies are gambles, and holding through earnings is a true crapshoot.

I came here in hopes to be the wolf of wall street but now I feel like a Chihuahua tied up in front of a 7/11.
My rkt calls are printing a massive $4 profit why do I even listen to what you guys say
EZ GAINZ
Why would we invest in things actually going up though?
this kinda happened last time too, right?  I’m long but not real happy about the fade these past few weeks.
It’s 2020 dude, women can do their own wellness checks...they don’t need us M E N remember? 😤🥴

Keep calm. Nio stock price target is [$550! 😉](https://youtu.be/NyNOiLDz3ak)
Yeah well selling is like a snowball that turns into an avalanche. Microsoft and Facebook down over 2% then the S&P would be down let’s say 3%, but then that would trigger people to keep dumping stocks and that doesn’t stop without a circuit breaker. Wall Street will not let that happen again not so soon at least.
In which case, mink coat
I should have indeed... was averaging down and they were expensive last week (I’ve been averaging down from 50 contracts).
Rolls Royce , thank me later 😉
# GREEN AGAIN? JUST FUCKING DRILL
If they started covering and the report is delayed like you said, I’d be shocked if they didn’t try to get more out prior to console cycle. I’d say they know something we don’t but every piece of news that comes out works against them. Unless they’re just going to hold through the cycle on principle but that comes with it’s own risks.
thats what I think too
Check out BRKB - they did buybacks.
Because you bet on a shit website lmao none of the votes certified. The electoral college declares the president not the media. Thats just facts, like it or not. I dont care who wins

Yea completely. It’s a good stock to hold but I bought some calls and just had to average down from there, don’t really like the 12/18 position but decided to stick with it for aggro returns so I get out early then buy my 400 shares back


Never seen a stock get so unlucky before, horrible timing (tech rise and tech drops the one day it has no bad news and was 305 pre market yday)

I find it hilarious t see people on this sub rooting against the vaccine because they have zoom calls or some shit
RKT: hello investors it was another great quarter, cash rained from the skies, we've been hopped up on hookers and blow so long i forgot my kids names, we're gonna buy back half our float, we're projecting 69% growth in revenue and 420% to our net!

Investors: this gentleman will escort you out
Yea, its not like GM has any EVs already in market or anything.
No, nothing is normal with RKT.
Literally. Not. A. Thing.

What is it?
Puts on Apple and Intel for that shit Macbook Air and marketing plot of the golden i9 on LTT.
I talked to an experienced doctor in Germany. He said, because of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, he would consider investing in Bayer. His main argument was, that they will be around for longer and not go under.

Also, could there be an indirect profit? BioNTech is a German company. Germany payed for the research. I found a German (looks like government) website that said Bayer will help produce vaccines from other companies.  


PS: He said also, no vaccine before Feb - March. He also said, there will be less deaths once a vaccination is here. Most people won't take it, so it will mostly be the risk groups that'll get vaccinated.
Thinking about buying some leaps on oil... do you have any recommendations on tickers to look into?
It’s over the next 2 years. Or one. One of the 2.

STOCKS ONLY GO UP
Yeah coz it’s not doing anything. I think they meant for it to really be fanless but since intel sucks ass, therefore dumb design?
what would you do out of curiosity this thing gotta drop imo but if you wanted to play a straddle
Simple. Just buy good stocks like Nio. Its stock price target is [$550! 😉](https://youtu.be/NyNOiLDz3ak)

You’re missing out on quarterly payments of at least 2 cents per share dude.
Yea usually I never hold through earning way to many bad experiences. But never feared Corsair, picked up more yesterday and should’ve bought the dip today. Was to busy watching Microsoft all day. If you didn’t buy msft calls when it was 210 or 211 all day today I feel bad for you.

Mainly up and down lose their meaning when weightless, but it might just go 'tits rolling along their axis of rotation until acted on by external forces' but I haven't seen Nio's latest quarterly figures.
He’s also stopping Biden from being an effective first day president. Trump doesn’t care if he fucks America he just wants Biden fucked too.

Who worried about their tech calls 😅
Yeah and then the next week they will declare the gov't will do everything it can to support and have a strong growing robust tech economy. See Chairman Xi's remarks in Shenzhen a couple weeks ago. They are really all over the place, but in the end will do whatever it takes to beat the Americans, so the tech companies will have free reign as long as they kowtow just a little to the CCP.
Yass Gaga
They have $900 million in the bank made since going public from dumb fucks like the ones who frequent this sub. They are currently burning through about $120 mil a quarter. 
Before you run out and buy low strike puts, consider that they can continue operating at their current rates for another two years. Longer if they somehow figure out how to generate revenue or raise more money from investors.
As much as I want this company to eat shit, they won’t burn down as fast as we are all hoping.
Well thats exciting, thanks for the info!

Had a college prof who would rage about third world philanthropy - *some guy goes in and gives a bunch of shirts to poor Africans, thinks he's doing a great thing because hey free shirts for Africans. Really he's undercutting the African shirt economy, completing drying it up. Then he peaces out because no more shirts and there's no one left to sell shirts to the Africans. If he really wanted to help he'd help them start a shirt store*

TL;DR - Giving to charity is bad man

Can I ask you one last question?

Why isn't salt money anymore?

Not a trick question. If you can answer that then you can figure out why salt, and gold, doesn't work.
Something else that isn't mentioned enough is that gaming as a whole is growing because of covid and even after covid it will be bigger than it was before... which means that GME can lose market share to a certain point and still increase revenue...

Feeling good about the AMZN puts that I brought at eod
Because its from an influx of mortgages and refinancing from our super low interest rates and is only temporary and major investors know that.
gotta install a fan my brother
ZM calls are gonna make me happy boi this week!!!!
IWM has some mighty gaps to fill on the way down. I’m ready for them
Buy HTZ stock all in
$SHOP moon? Shits been bleeding for a month
Damn, that’s cheap, wish I bought some today
It really isn't too much to ask
hm, other than the very understandable profit-taking, what's going to bring the market down?
Anyone know what the pump with INO today was all about? 35% up on the day and still cheap from what I can see from the chart 🤔
IV was so high they won't be rich lmao
Is anyone else holding 0DTE SPY puts?
Phaggit
On god. If nio goes down, the devil has to come to earth and burn everything to oblivion. I made a bet with him the other day 😐😐😐
Who has time for notifications when I'm busy all day watching a ticker go up and down to nowhere
😳
Crap, I didn't know FUBO was having earnings today. I missed it. This shit better bring up my ROKU though.
HAHA WHO WAS THE IDIOT NOW FUCK YALL
If you got long calls. You shouldn't be worried
Yeah. I feel great about the call. Lots of big money institutions showing interest.
Yeah, Im in the same place.
I’m exploring right now
They will fuck your sweet ass boi, sell
Elon Musk in mourning because his candidate lost
😬 I'll pray for your calls
None, other than I thought I remembered hearing them say it on the earnings call. It was archived on their IR page but I'm not seeing it now. 

I'm long GME, but I wouldn't be holding my breath for them to do buybacks before Jan 30, 2021. Not when there's still a pandemic going on, and not when they still have notes due in March. After Q4 earnings? Likely.
RKT will launch tomorrow, mark my words! Same as space x dragon just a bit of delay
Yeah. That timing was an ass blaster. Shit happens I guess. Just like ACB tonight. 

You can predict that shit. Sorry you lost man. Sucks. We will be back though my friend!! Take care.
D. Fuck you
Sick paperweight....

No fucking idea, i think its got a lot to climb though
Doubt it but fiverr and zoom might have more room to tank
Yeah man.. it might sell off some in the time to come but I aint in it for the bread crumbs. I want the big bread and for that we gotta have patience and let it ride out. They will find their way back up to old levels. All they gotta do is return to normal functioning eventually. 

The good thing about the vaccine is that it strongly mitigates bankruptcy risk and makes lenders more willing to loan these companies money in these dire times.

All of the dark pool share transactions
Exactly what I’m what I’m experiencing. My regret is that I didn’t have any holdings in entertainment in light of vaccine. I need to learn how to better diversify my portfolio.
Nice play bro.
Maybe, ACB should bounce a bit. Shit management team tho fucking over investors by offering shares, could get uglier. The

I told myself that this time would be different, Nio. I really did. I know you're the quintessential Kang gang stock. I know you never hold. I know. But you were doing so well for weeks.
Should have bought calls then xD
Tech might rally because its oversold, but I don't think covid is a concern anymore.  The major question before was if its even possible to make a vaccine, which has been proven.  The market is forward looking so its looking past covid (and has been since before May).

Holy shit. Please let this do something to BA tomorrow. I paper handed a swing trade today that would've netted me a little bit of money, but I bought in another and held through today so I got two calls, one FD for 11/13 and a leap for January, $195c and $220c
Are they?
Thank you. Actual solid advice. I plan to pay off tuition right away, and most likely the money I do decide to invest, but into banks for longterm growth/dividends.

Deutsche Post wants it. But no news on it yet
Make sure u only buy never sell
Yeah get leaps or shares. Or sell puts if you don't want to be that bullish. You can keep rolling them out if you don't want to get assigned. It is going to just keep going up
Facts
Remember when that dude drank his own piss?
Good question: would love an answer to this one
At this point RKT could :

*report 10x profits per Q or a whole year 

*announce dividends 

*jump to 50% market share tomorrow

*acquire the 10 next biggest mortgage/lending companies and basically create a monopoly 

and we’ll still drop fucking 5-10% because why not...

Why, you could do it off my hairy ass for free.

oh yea
sell
Yea doesnt make any sense for a company to Ipo and then share buy back what in the hell
So is RKT a good buy right now? Great earnings, stock buyback, and it goes down. But surely the buyback alone will bet you some cash if you buy now right?

NIO puts but I bought back in with house money.

this thing went from a penny stock to up 2000% in a straight line
Yeah, we were due for a rotation out of tech and into other traditional stocks. Truth be told, tech stocks are overvalued and non-tech is undervalued in a post-Covid economy. I don't think we are actually there yet, but at some point the cash is going to flow accordingly.

Are BABA calls printing tomorrow?
I mean if rkt is flat thats fine ill be able to get out tomorrow lol
No earnings for BABA tomorrow
The 240s would offset some of the theta gains though. With this much money why not just sell naked calls? just to cap downside i guess

So this can't be a debit spread? 

Also; who buys the 75k calls this guy is shorting all at once?
It’s a shit stock
From now till NIO earnings seems pretty predictable. We’ll get a good run up to about 50. Nice little 3-5% tank right after then quick recovery.
NIO had a red day today so obviously tomorrow will be green. This options thing is too easy
Made some pretty bad moves today tbh

Who knows, I'm here for autists to tell me what stocks to buy
Eh as long as you're not in shit like Zoom that was so obviously and hilariously overvalued that there was no way it'd stay there, I think you're fine.

It's not like tech companies don't benefit from COVID ending. They just have less upside than the industries that got reamed. 

And while you're absolutely right that COVID isn't ending and it's likely to get worse in the winter before the vaccine really becomes mass distributed, it's also normal for the market to start pivoting before it happens in anticipation. Though this may be premature....idk.
Yes.
Its the wrong weed stock 💩
why?

Lmao RKT follows no fundamentals, purely autismo power
Sry dude shouldn’t have bought 11/13
The buyback is over 2 years lol and thats a rough plan, barring any economic changes.
Never should have been close to that high in the first place.

Wait so...$1 billion rkt buyback, isnt that a huge % of the float? What am i misunderstanding.

yeah. will hold this week
pray for me i got 287.5 11/13 my balls are literally sweating...
You’re not a failure. I have felt like that too in the past when everything I do is just not working. But you have to be proud of what you’ve done, buy your emotional dip by using this as motivation to pick up something new. Doesn’t have to be anything big, make it a new hobby or a new good habit. Set yourself a *very reachable* goal for next month and take planned steps to achieve it. Don’t make it market related. 

You know how I could tell you’re not a failure even though I don’t know anything about you? Because you recognize you are not happy with yourself. Real failures don’t do that, either because they can’t or don’t want to. You’ve got this bud I believe in you. Incremental, achievable goals!
Ight let’s Fr talk about cannabis tho. How are these companies not printing money out the asshole? They just got that reggie or what?

Dear God clear your notifications, what are you, a boomer?
It'll all be back in tech by the end of the week. That other shit isn't exciting enough for anyone.
Yes thats exactly what i will do..
Why isnt RKT launching to the moon lol
Exactly.. he is accounting the leases which is unfair to consider as normal debt. They have around 275M debt left vs 800M in cash (based on September data). 
They were ebitda negative but generating cash by selling off inventory. New inventory related to new consoles and games clearly sell off super quickly and they still command a 30% market share...
No change in the markets . Stonks go up
So maybe the rally is just short covering then

Baba and amzn this week lmfao 

Fr this is me if it wasn’t for my bearish activity yday I’d be down so much
I'm tempted to buy after open but its RKT.
Dayum i never saw pump and dump that way before
Piss poor time for a share offering...    
I took a bit of a hit too.
Yeah I dig that
offering. fucked. killed it with puts. Under $4 tomorrow.
So the market just got way ahead of itself because business travel (which makes up the majority of travel) is not recovering and we should fade this rally, yeah?
Being investigated for misleading investors

One more note : take a good look at post market movement, its been dumping short volume in our favor consistently. Very sneaky making sure to not do more then 200k (2% +-) each day as not to trigger any SS. Institutional bag holders are scared and trying to hide their actions
What’s the difference between this year and next year? We’re still in a pandemic... If they’re redeeming now it’s obviously good sign that they aren’t forced to wait for positive cash flows next year. We have to remember this is a company that has heavily priced in bankruptcy - expectations are low. A hint at positive cash flows now speaks volumes to GME’s potential next year and onward.

Just put it into QQQJ
This is the type of shit I like to see.

He meant last time lol
ngl thought this was going to be a lot worse
Okay Richie rich....
Looks like the market loves 😴. SPX just hit ATH. Or maybe it likes two presidents 😕
Its not as high as it was but it's still completely beyond anything that could be considered reasonable. The shorts got way, way ahead of themselves and are beginning to see that they fucked up.
it's 6 o clock somewhere in the middle of the atlantic ocean
Why looks like the market failed to move up all afternoon and vix is low as shit

What’s the catalyst for bears getting fucked
Me. I got 12/5 30.5c and sold half my position today for 80%. Letting the rest ride for a bit.
What happened with aurora ?
Indeed we did. Still gonna hold though, dont have much left to loose and new COVID lockdowns does still give us a chance

Same. What positions do you have? Currently holding

- $115c 3/2021 -> down

Either it is anxiety or you won't have to worry about what it is in the very near future.
Buying puts on a boomer stonk cancels out my boomer comment.

I'm assuming the bondholders were obligated to sell them back otherwise this news goes from bullish to bearish
wtf is that your family picture or something
Zm earnings around the same time they release more info about Pfizer vaccine. THIS SHOULD BE FUN 

It’ll probably trade sideways until then to add more to the suspense and fuckery

These bags are prada.
Options should be discontinued on aapl
Pro tip: only buy AAPL leaps when the underlying is below $110. You'll probably get another chance here within a week.
Might wait to buy 100 shares at 74
Lol imagine thinking 🥭 really care about the market and not his reputation which is lost as a great business man😂😂
I watched my portfolio all fucking day and it was flatter than my ex girls ass...puts on my productivity

doesnt matter its 1/50th of market cap. BIIB is purchasing 5 billion, 5x more and their market cap is 50 bil. sooo
The thing is i am not stupid (this one time). I do know how to trade in a disciplined manner, and incorporate proper risk management. However, I went on losing streak and lost 7k. I made an irrational mistake to yolo everything into amazon leaps to recover that 7k, which looking back i could have easily made. Sucks but i guess greed got the best of me. Thank you but if this money goes i go too.

I bought at all time highs.   $11,  $15, $21,  $27, $31.

I don’t think so either but the rhetoric of the party isn’t calming anything down. That said. Even if he’s backed and refuses, I still don’t think they’d be successful, I just see a massive sell off and volatility spike.

Think about what he would want you to do with it, what you would want your own son to do with it and do that.  Please do not yolo into options, you will regret it.  Mutual funds or real estate imo.
Venmo me some and I’ll invest it for you
What's up with the RKT buybacks?  Are they trying to minimize dilution when lockup ends?
Ofc, but it’s not touching 250 rn especially b4 earnings
I'm  currently checking to see if ONI,  ION, and NOI are active tickers, you can't lose.
not sure if you take requests, but a "Deal or Priced In Part II" would rock after this crazy year. The original was one of my favorites.

edit: [https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecwes7/deal\_or\_priced\_in/](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ecwes7/deal_or_priced_in/)
They just gotta trade NIO flat for a day to kill the volatility. Is that what's gonna happen?
Flabbergasted that people actually burned their cash on RKT options when they know what happened last time. They were better of buying a share.. Why the fuck would you buy meme stock options that already failed the sub once
Out of here with your boomer talk!

No different than any other company?

Aww fck. Haha. Saraozate... I think we just took an L
Someone explain the shirt to this tard
Right let’s pump up companies that are most likely to go bankrupt like hertz because no way business travel gets as big as 2019 given that people realize the cost savings of the mobile work environment
Yup
GME
If u would have put it all in GME tho u’d be down like 30% u fuk idiot thays what ur doing wrong
Now we just need it to go straight up.
But a 100% of what amount of money 😂 you know what I meant

Part of me is hungry for more dividends and I’m looking at $KO. Maybe I should try to get assigned on 10/27 and then dump the stock after EX/EFF Date. It is a slow mover so I shouldn’t lose much or make a small gain.

50k deep in baba 280c 11/20... looking for a nice multi day rally gents
[deleted]
I think PLTR will crash after earnings for 3 reasons:
1. too hyped on WSB and too popular in general yet no one has any idea what they do. 
2 already up almost 50% the past couple weeks. 
3. I own shares and thousands in calls bought at the peak today.
and they were too retarded and slow to pop it off at the high, fucking cucks
RKT green by open
And better (for most people)
Yes, because now they have no money for food.
11/17
Boring or not, it looks like you haven’t mastered the game yet.
Yeah, buy after earnings dip
No, I’m not a boomer, and yes, I’m heavily invested in $BA through $DFEN. Just in case y’all thought Boeing was only about commercial aircraft:
“Boeing is a leader in aviation, aerospace and defense technology supporting airlines and U.S. and allied government customers in more than 150 countries. Boeing technology, products and tailored services include commercial and military aircraft, satellites, defense systems, launch systems, advanced information and communication systems, and performance-based logistics and training.”
Upgrade GME while they are at it
I mean, I hope you’re right, I just wouldn’t be so confident. Anyways, I said to hedge. I don’t “load up” on hedges.
Didnt think it was until you said that. Now im not clicking.
I really liked LA (I live in SF now and prefer LA). If you are under 28 years old, get a decent apartment and serviceable car (nothing too fancy), and put your money toward savings, food and short trips through all the areas in LA. If you are 30+, get a nicer apartment and car, and put your money toward savings and sugar babies.
Someone in the Apple subreddit was trying to hype up the Apple laptop and they said for $1,000 it’s almost as good as the iPad Pro..but the IPad Pro is cheaper
Do not touch. Will track straight right. Hell, someone might make it go left.
Give $125k to a wealth manager with a fiduciary duty to you. Blow the other $25k on one week of TSLA fds.
If someone did that it might become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Uhh just taking a guess but it ran up in low liquid after and premarket and you bought at a shit price that others didn't want to pay so it sold off because it got too far from mean price, and day traders dictate intra day price already so in pre and after market expect price to be fuck
Ya me too.  The second one freaked me out enough to go to the hospital. After a bunch of tests they said it was a panic attack not a heart attack.   Very similar symptoms tho

Oof. First off, sorry to hear about your father. In regards to the money ... I’m not sure I would be investing long term right now. If you were to do this, dividend stocks for the time being and just reinvest the payouts. I would also scale in, slowly. You asked so those are my 2 cents. And once again, sorry to hear about your father.
Crystal ball says it’s hitting $400
Your just mad because trump lost, OMG, guess what, get over it!
But buy them next Thursday
Real.. finally, i fucking hate that stock. But glad i only thought about shorting/puts never acted on it because i knew it was "one of **those** stocks".
HAPPY AS A SOB!! Loaded those puts on ACB. I knew this bitch would fall. Fucking over.
I think he is. Whoever opened this is collecting some nice theta. They will probably close by the end of week.

I like AMD in the 70’s - I bought 500 shares today, probably will buy more if it pulls back a little more.
Sold my ACB 7p when it was up 8$ at 3 pm. Gawd.
As long as it closes above 43 on Friday I'll be fine. Next Friday above 44 I'll be fine, and I'll be bankin if it closes above 46.
Robinhood let's you buy 0DTE options starting tomorrow
Not sure where you live, but everything here is 700k min for a house
I hear that's a series of tubes.
Not expecting a huge move on this as it was mostly expected.  But their ability to pull it off and what they said in their filing is bullish as fuck.  Don't buy short dated calls, diamond hands until valhalla.

I thought people were memeing about rkt calls. 
Are you a goldfish? Don't you remember what happened last time rkt had an earning?
DO NOT YOLO YOUR INHERITANCE
I’m tired of bag holding AAPL leaps. Fuck.
Real estate or wait until stimulus actually happens in January/February then enter the market.

Also r/investing this sub will make you lose all your money if you don’t understand how it functions

Sorry for your loss
Made me chuckle sir
They're a legit company not worth $400 per share.
Market gonna pump
Put it all into $TMUS 140c 1/21
Sorry for your loss. Buy some Nio leaps.
Oil and energy on a moon mission tomorrow. What an incredible bullish API report to happen right now, everything smashed expectations

I picked up 100 contracts of XLE 11/13 $34c to hedge 11/13 BP puts I also picked up, both near mid day, and that gain will way more than offset the loss from the puts

Passed up on ACB $10 Puts yesterday because I’ve lost to retard strength too many times. Damn those wouldve been juicy

Please send thoughts and prayers lol
Maybe next year champ
Chinese holiday (not officially recognized by the Chinese government, though) that celebrates singles (bachelors and bachelorettes alike). It sort of turned into a massive buying day, holiday, and party day for singles to go on dates or get hooked up by friends on a blind date. Its a massive spending holiday.
Great plan
I'm secretly hoping BA trades flat tomorrow even though I hold leaps

Can you guess why
You’re not picking the wrong stocks, your just throwing to much in at first, throw some bait. Once it sinks throws some more and wait till the numbers turn green

GME allowed early redemption of 2021 sr notes, valued at $100MM. This means that GME is cash flow positive even before receiving income from their microsoft deals and consoles. It destroys the shorts thesis that GME would default on these notes

Since you are so young you still have lots of time to get all that money back as long you understand why you lose so much money. You play to win and if you don't win you'll have experience and that will give you another chance to fight back so you can win. Life is not always about money.

Might actually hold off tho. Someone in the thread said something very bad happened today that’s why price crashed. I thought just profit taking from long term bag holders but I need to research this first. Said possibly bankruptcy?? 

If it’s not that serious tho that’s the one I’m going for. Probs buy 2 or 3
[removed]
I think 43-44
Have 800 shares since 124 just before it looked like it was going down hill, had a gut feeling to keep them and held , it’s doing pretty good and holding price well.
That’s true. That’s the main reason I didn’t buy them. IV was too high

Hmm I think there was some research on this done on black Monday, but even stock brokers of pretty high floors only for a few seconds of weightlessness.

I’ve been kinda doing the same, dumping money into CCL when it’s cheap and holding until after things go back to normal. Those shares are going to print after they get back up to their yearly average of $35-$40.
Doesnt matter either way.

If you do any of the above, you will be viewed as a legitimate crazy person by your peers and you will lose friends and relationships.

Team rkt look at the bright side it still haven’t broke the low of today😂😂
RKT only dropped ~3% AH today and it's currently climbing back up.  Their earnings numbers were great (again) AND they're issuing a $1 (B)illion stock buyback.  I'm holding RKT for a while.
What in the actual fuck???? +334% AH. Mmmmm organic growth.
Tomorrow is gonna be green as fuck

Were an hour into AH chill🥶
These things used to/are in arcades, like for kids. Really really early on they had quarters, and later tokens if the place used tokens in place of quarters. Like in the video you could get more quarters/tokens with one quarter/token.

Soon after this was basically like gambling cause you were "winning" real money, even after they changed it to tokens. I guess it will depend on where you live now, but I thought most of these machines dispensed tickets in place of quarters/tokens because of the fact they were in arcades and you couldn't have little 8 year old timmy basically winning straight up money.

I hope so makes up for my retarded gambling on lyft.

I think there is no price in ER. Everyone is waiting to see if NIO lives up to the hype. I think they kill earnings easily by beating EPS and have very good guidance. Only thing up in the air is news which is hard to predict. The rest, not too much.
Rkt gaps up tomorrow
don't worry, rkt buying back $1B in shares to support your calls
Why am I holding spy puts overnight again
Spy puts it is
You’re a good person. ❤️
Not to mention y'all could just buy TSLA FD's at open anytime it's over 420, watch it shed 10-15 bucks for the first hour, sell then watch it reset to 410-420 each day like fucking clockwork.  You are making this too difficult on yourselves.

how do you buy AH?
RKT needs a sector rotation into positive territory
I'll just admit defeat and buy RKT shares.

This market is more retarded than I am.
I have vix calls ready
I be de pappy

I’m long tech shares too.  I can’t say for sure, I’m planning on suffering through it. I think there will be more downside until next year. I don’t expect much upside in tech for a while but I’m holding the shares for the very long term
Yes long term this is hugely bullish for shareholders. This basically eliminates the short-medium term possibility of GME going bankrupt due to debt, effectively neutralizing the short (66m as of report today) rational
no u
It’s all good guys. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, but you know what? On the positive side, tomorrow is another day.....for you to lose all of your money
If you bought leaps on RKT any time in the last 3 months you're not even beathing the S&P 500
Can’t they just process all that voter data under PLTR platforms and get this over with while mooning PLTR?

Thanks, buying calls

The only weed call that seems pretty solid imo is IIPR
$20.
Real talk; I think CCL leaps for 2023 are a good idea tomorrow. VXX low, price came down today. 

I WILL buy a few tomorrow 🙏🏾
Bro I think that's "conflict of interest". Imma have to report you to the SEC sorry
You can call it a conspiracy theory but there is evidence that needs to be investigated. Over 50 sworn eyewitness accounts (under penalty of perjury). Statistical anomalies; Bensford Law violations, huge amount of ballots in swing states for Biden with no downballot votes for the Dem house rep. Numerous admitted software errors giving votes to Biden.

This is among many other things I have seen alleged.  

Beyond that; anyone who watched election night live knows how bizarre it was. Around midnight Trump is running away with it up 7:1 on all betting sites. Voting pauses for like 30 minutes while some states announce they are stopping the count for the night. Then the count continues and huge swaths of Biden votes start coming in; literally 100k Biden - 0 Trump. 

I don't even care who wins. A Biden win is better for me personally but I enjoy watching the far left melt down so either way is good but to act like there couldn't POSSIBLY be anything wrong with the election just because you want your candidate to win hypocritical, shortsighted, and retarded. It's like people like being manipulated by Oligarchs, media, and tech
Back to politics for you ya clown this is tendy town
The market has moved *violently* up and down. But yeah, keep pretending this is normal
Baba
It was high last week. Its coming down now..
All of the short interest being drummed up right now plus all of the cautionary investors who were responsibly sitting on cash through the election is setting us up for a huge EOY rally. I don’t think this weeks blow off top was the end.
Are you telling me bears will eat for once?
Earnings call: yeah, we think the current price of RKT is pretty low and therefore the buyback is worth it 

Yeah we gonna moon.

PLTR just had a 40% run up election week. My guess is their software predicted the election with stunning accuracy and the big boys that saw this already bought in. Earnings will be fine but don’t expect much more.
[deleted]
Bruh
Earnings reports are a new-guy trap. The big boys have been reverse robinhooding people with this shit non-stop. They throw a biscuit out every now and again to keep people hungry, but you should always sell before earnings.
Anyone else snag Lyft calls before earnings?
Technically there’s a bearish engulfing printed today, but NIO tends to say fuck TA so it’ll probably be up 20% tomorrow...if NASDAQ doesn’t jump off a cliff here in a half hour

This is fine and all, but, I'm wondering why a bondholder would elect this.  It's not like they're not good for the bonds in 2021.  The right move for those bonds was to take the exchange for the 10% notes, because it's obvious GME isn't going to be bankrupt anytime soon, and those notes will trade well above par for the hefty (and relatively safe) yield.

A "good ER" is 100% not priced in. A bad ER is. They are strictly a growth company at the moment so positive ER is not expected by the non retarded investors. It will have negative EPS and will continue to climb. Then people in here will be like "Dubs Tea Eff!!! Everything beats earnings then tanks and NIO has shit earnings and goes up!!!!

What happened to that guy and bitCONect?
Me, long term calls
God speed retard.
the wiped out a bunch of debt with cash. take that as u will
what is pltr going to do
What is this fuckery that is going on with RKT? Ive already accepted my losses
Just buy the ETF if you want in at this point. RIP your money though.
CVD
I don’t know maybe you’re the idiot
ARKW has better holdings than ARKK but I use ARKK for its higher option volume. Picked up a ton of long dated calls on the dip to 92 today.
I been on this kick for a while and just had my 7.5c 11/20 print hard af yesterday and tbh rebounded all my shit plays for October.
Wars are bullish
$CVID
Purple
Thanks
10, 21, 50, and 200 MA. Macd, ttm squeeze, rsi. Fibs. Bollinger bands sometimes
Stupid boomer companies, PLTR is *TECH*
Rkt melt up will continue for another 2 hours and 42 minutes and end up at $23.27
It’s only up 1% for the day.
that's the one thanks G
lol RKT only down 1% now
Yes yes yes yes
Anyone in QQQJ?
Please not 3 days in a row
Thanks
Wait till ACB finishes its selloff
I got 1/21/23 30c boys. bought when NIO was $20
Guh
I’m using Schwab for shares and short term trades and Saxo for all my leaps. Top notch services and money deposits/withdrawals are processed so quickly.
Not a retard you still had profits at least. You evaluated the risks and the risks to you was not worth it. Move n my friend plenty of other ways to make money.
My baba calls would like this
Hell, even over 28
If they cancel anymore airplane contracts, that just means they can roll out their backlog quicker!
And now you are forever the guy who taught this guy the fine art of the paper hands
bullshit
In brk.b, rtx, and ko. All puts. Gimme a red day tmmrw folks
Of course. Where else you gonna find IV over 80 consistently lol
Positions?
After hours so flat
[deleted]
Thanks for buying my calls retards
Kind of limited on the day trades with only 10k
ACB how low can you go 💦
Yup
Invictus Volatitis
Same bro going turn 80 to 1000 could have turned 4k to 40k
I'm expecting this winter to be weak because of seasonality but with a strong spring quarter it could happen sooner than later. My $25 calls dont expire until September so I guess that is my timeline.
I give you the “you must certainly be a bigger idiot” title
I think they actually turn police away if they're too smart
STOP THE DOWNVOTES!
I’m the retard who sold his ACB puts today. High IV made it difficult to be profitable. Also last 200% ACB run up they only retraced 50% and did a gap up before a slow fade. Figured it wasn’t worth risk to reward to get caught in the gap up and slow theta bleed.
just me or did PRPL report early? anyway i sold 22.5p's so worked out.
Very happy about this

 From the 8-K news release: "**Using cash generated from operations**" (in order to retire the senior notes) 

 GME was able to use cash from operations, during a time when bears thought GME to be at its weakest, the end of 7 year console cycle.  

Why is this important? Well they are most likely cash flow positive NOW and NO console cycle benefits have truly taken place yet.  

GME have not yet generated revenue from monetizing their customer data or from the MSFT downstream digital revenue partnership.  They have only very recently began to generate revenue from PC hardware and online advertising.  

GME is going to be generating a TON of cash within the next few months and they already look to be cash flow positive!

Lots to look forward to here in the coming months.

What does buying back mean?
Gap up overnight?
I’m in the same spot tbh. Was up 100% on my nio and spce calls yesterday and didn’t cash in 😭. Praying to any and every god right now.
This RKT call sounds good actually. They trying to make me an "investor". Pfffft get out of here with that boomer shit. Its called "bag holder".
Should have been playing FUBO and not RKT this whole time
2 years
If you're in ACB, you need to check your brokerage right now..
ACB down another 16% AH 

Teehehe
this means you
[deleted]
not everyone is on fds. if you bought leaps RKT shouldn't even be a concern
In ETSY and W calls. Will know tomorrow if I made the right choice 🥴🥴🥴
It's more that some investors felt money is now better invested in mature, downtrodden companies that are highly profitable rather than rolling the dice with AMD and it's nosebleed valuation after a 3 month run-up.
Anyone notice the boomer viagra commercials on CNBC after we traded sideways for 2 months?
Well this aged like milk
Can the VIX start moving again
same,I just want it to reach 50 eow or at least before my calls expire next week
[deleted]
PLTR gang how we feeling
Peace
I don’t know maybe he’s right
1/21/23 dawg
Sell to close
This^
Take your pick, you'll lose it either way
Regardless how shitty public schools are, children’s parents are an even worse influence, new reports are saying stay at home kids are forgetting how to use fork and knives
STOP THE SELLING!
If nio gaps up tmrw I will suck china.....dry of tendies because I’ll be rich. Wow this fucking sucked
From insecure people.
big F, sorry friend.
If 10K is all you got then just go the boomer route and buy VTI.
It is, but it's also on delay. That released data from today was for Oct 30th
Oh, no. It didn't keep up its ridiculous pace forever. Buy the dip and ride to the moon.
Don’t think Ken will be back on MSNBC ever...
Well this is WSB and I'm in for $34.50avg, planning on riding it hard and going full retard.
 

ACB Dead.

Again i should have loaded up on puts instead of only getting a handful.
Yup
hold shares until you see a play then sell everything and go all in and get hood rich
>the majority of senate republicans

Source on that?
Sorry about BABA looked rough as hell. I’m talking about SPY.
You can’t day trade with 10k unless you get margin or smt
I miss the days when RKT was hitting resistance at $24
Fuck me it went to 24. I missed out on an extra 5.5k

Fuuuuck
RIP my ACB shares
It will be in effect for 2 years
ACB Dead.

Again i should have loaded up on puts instead of only getting a handful.
If RKT moons from here, it might be the best comeback story ever on wsb. Or is something like this happened before?
Like this if you have Lyft/ Uber calls!
Yes that’s part of my concern is that they’ll back him.
Did Lyft moon after earnings? There was a dude who posted here last night cryptically that you should buy calls at open because the earnings report was good. I fucking love insider trading on this sub
IV is like 250% so you won’t see too much
how'd this go for you u/frankly_fresh ?
RKT aint dead yet
Anyone watching for Airbnb IPO? I’m trying to jump on it as soon as I can
You need 25k liquid to day trade.
Indeed. 😁
Bullish
That nio dip was so fucking sexy my god was it necessary. I’m still soaked thinking about it
Oh fuck.. I'm sorry. I had it in my head that people were loading up on calls while it was down huge
Day trading will suck your soul away out through your anus
lol FPRX why did I sell at 18.5.

Missed out on an extra 5k. Fuuuck
Puts $acb 11/20 $6
11/20 $5.5 
11/20 $5
Ticker?
yup
They beat earnings and are buying back 1 billion dollars worth of stock that’s the opposite of dilution, yet we still get a drop. Take advantage and buy more stock during the dip.
this is a true wsb reply not the other sappy shit that people are replying.
Checks out lol
Who do you follow?
Typo
I'm down like 5% after BABA got into sadism and steps on my balls every day.

No daddy BABA, not again!
Prayin for you brotha
Shit Man U fucked
Perhaps acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said he would be ok with the Insurrection act being used and that would allow Trump to enact a coup.
I think it’s underwater
Not surprised, said that days ago.. they are a company bleeding tons of money, knew they were gonna take advantage of bloated share price.
Yeah, but didn't they say in Q2 earnings that there would be no more buybacks for 2020?
yeah offering haha, I knew that shit would happen. I sold that so fast yesterday morning holding it over the weekend
Picked up some super cheap $400 dec calls after seeing how strong support was at $353.  I think we rally into end of year.
Oh duh. Just bought 100 Spy 500c weekly
Iv was huge. Not as good as the gain porn lol
not a good idea rn
fucking china why would they shoot themselves in the foot and cancel ant groups ipo. they are such emotional little bitches.
I think its the low p/e that keeps faking everyone out
What does time have to do with fundamentals?
And you’re gay.

Apha
Does it matter? Most tech stocks are back to what they were 8 days ago. Hardly cause for concern.
someone revive him.
fax idk how people didnt learn their lesson esp after last earnings lol
Makes sense. I’m looking at my Midwest salary like WTF
ETH is also crushing it
get rekt boomer stocks on top
The average American income is almost $240k/year?

Edit: you retards, this is quarterly revenue. 30kx4 quarters in a year = $120k, $120kx2 = $240k
Also in on the RKT train. Would love to not get fucked twice on RKT.
🤮
Thoughts on day trading with 10k or just playing options?
That’s chill, it’s just annoying when people are shocked when the stock doesn’t move how they think it should and then shill about how they’re geniuses but the market is rigged.
Did rkt give Time frame on the 1b in stock buybacks thing?
Stonks don't go up based on lack of interest... Just fyi
Theta gang wins again
It dropped like $1...actually like .50 from open
He actually did. Smh
Ddog call sounds bullish af
I sold early for 45% gain and an ant bet of $340
Are you holding or selling
I want to see 340s for some balance guh
ACB is tanking because they are doing a public offering of more shares. It looks like other cannabis stocks are doing a bit of a sympathy dive though, but not nearly as bad.
Looking to get into some cannabis stocks. Any recommendations?
thats not how it works, if the electors pick him he wins, then its the deal about mail ballots after the 3rd nov
It starts with a gut instinct. Puts or calls, always calls
Do you think the media doesn’t have an agenda? Holy fucking shit. Mama always said stupid is as stupid does.
It would have skyrocketed
I’m dumber for having read this. Well done sir.
Fantastic fundamental analysis. What's your newsletter and how much to subscribe?
A long dated AMZN call is obviously safer with potential vaccine news looming. But AMZN is a powerhouse that never stays at 3000 so the WSB answer is take that quick FD profit asap.
He said email my dude
People must have figured out that 1) It's actually a shitty company and 2) it's Canadian so why would us red-blooded Americans prop that shit up?
I’m in the same contract. Hoping for a bounce to end the week. Was brutal watching it bleed out all day today, but I held.
[removed]
First time?
Hopefully it will recover
DFEN Called it last week before it mooned and missed out on 1k% increase on the call I was looking at. But regardless it’s probably still a good buy, only gonna continue going up
RKT was $30 last earnings and only $21 this earnings. This is no way to run a company!!
yup. Go find the guy on twitter and harass him
Seems like whatever WSB wants,they are usually off by about half. So instead of Nio hitting 60, I bet it settles at 30
Jack ma looks like a fucking alien even for a China man
Yea I'm hoping we get a run up till Friday and then I'll peace out
Don't worry guys. I'm very bullish on Covid. Already 110k new cases and over 1k deaths and the day ain't over. Buy your CALLS now. This shit is goin to the moon.
not much how about you
Yeah well that’s your debt too then. Not only theirs
Shorting the recovery is not a boomer move, it's a sucker's move.  That's why I dared you to put your money where your mouth is.
Unless it’s mob debt
Please let me go back an hour and half and I’ll sell I swear
Your max loss isn't 2k. That's only if both legs get exercised.

They know they're way overpriced and are trying to take advantage lol
Looks like you’re going to work
This sadly does not change the fact that my Friday calls are fucked
Cuckerberg and 🥭 are best friends on paper
[deleted]
If they co-signed on the loans
Massive consolidation going on. You see how red tech is. Alot of other stocks are getting bought to make up for it. Eventually the market as a whole will go up together.
I was down 4k today. 

Saw twitter buzzing about  some biotech stonk. FPRX (up 236% AH)

Decided to buy 1000 shares at 13.4 

Just sold at 18.5 moments ago. Just like that I'm up 1.1k for the day. 

Fuuck the joy I feel rn wow! I'm calling my drug dealer..
[deleted]
I bet you don’t use seasoning
I should have bought ACB puts like I said god fucking damnt, at least GME released news
ACB put holders show me your gain porn
Positions or ban
I should buy TLT puts
Oh no one red day after like 2 weeks of green.
How are you bundles of sticks still memeing on RKT? All they do is burn your money. Oh is next time going to be different?! Oh you think it's going to rally from here?! Jesus Christ it's fucking Stockholm Syndrome in here.
That's where I draw the line
It did just like RKT, but the opposite
I would fuck one, but date? Are you desperate? Sounds like both of you might be. Lol
QQQJ and QQQM
Throughout the day it did, got some nice tendies from the panic sells early on
Folks, he accidentally set a day limit.

He gone. RIP
What a fucking weirdo. Stop drinking. Rethink ur choices.
How much was your 🔮
Offering lol
Yea the bankruptcy thesis is dead..... but there are still 103% of outstanding shares sold short.
PJ traders have all the fun, we just get left with flat ass consolidation during the daytime sessions.
when everybody was piling into tech names, at least FAANG were massive money makers. now the overvalued garbage like DDOG is getting shit on and even AMD and NVDA are falling. and now investors have to put money into money losing trash companies to find "growth." this is legitimately hilarious. the fed has broken everything
Stick it inside of her to pump, then dump
big difference between Jan 1st 2021 and Dec 31st my dude. which side r u leaning

fellow rkt koolaid drinker here
How much are their options worth and do they have a pre nup
My pleasure. I bought in at 19 and have steadily added and hold a 808 share position right now with an avg cost of 24. Will continue to add more on some dips, with a plan to own at least 2000 shares before it hits $100 per share price. I plan on making some decent profits on this one.
Zero, the debt isn't actually that much. Sub 100-200 billion I believe. 

Plus, China can manipulate numbers to make anything disappear
what brand? i hope is the kind that doesn’t work
Rudy guiliani and jack ma are the two weirdest looking dudes on the earth
If you look at the picture I did buy a call 😂.
Only up from here.
"No"

And I'd advise you to stay the fuck away. You have no dignity?
Yeh fuck all that. To the moon 🌙
If nio isn't green by open I'm calling off work and getting my kidney removed to sell on the black market
FD's are retarded with very very low probability of working. People blame MMs because they don't want to admit they're stupid for even trying.
Lol

'lose' the seasoning packet haha that will teach him
Looking at buying SPY puts if it does a head and shoulders or double top
I diagnose you with autism
Crsr went up
How can you get a notification without an app installed?
Move them to December, you won't regret it
Because I bought puts
forreal
And it still plummeted
Down 3% after-hours with the announcement of $1 billion in stock buy backs over the next two years is hardly kill.
Tell me more
Because his real dad is a chang.
when I drink I crave junk over fancy food/
Gunna print
Phony and fabricated voter fraud bullshit news
What happened?
I can't believe jerma985 admitted he used to lurk /biz/ and lost tons of money on BYND puts lmfao
Probably, unless we start a war or something
Yep lol @$7.50 share for 125million
It still hasn’t recovered what it lost today..
I just wanna know what you are buying next🤭so I can follow
You won’t see 30 anytime soon may be when Spy hits 1000
We get it though
Give it time.
Nah got like 10 20p for fun. Anything could happen tomorrow morning but I think I’ll at least break even.
To the person who said they were going to be broke by inheriting their dead relatIves debt, I can’t find the post now. If you’re reading this and you live in America you should know that debt is not legally passed down to next of kin and you are not required to pay it.
Any new growth ETFs out there?
the two options plays ive made this week $ELY and $RXT both smash the fuck out of earnings but still drill premarket.

god.

fucking.

damnit.
Why isn’t rocket drilling more? I mean it should consider my form right now.
What caused RKT to fall? I thought the ER and buyback were positive?
Why ?
I'm in RKT for the long term, definitely gonna hit $30 next year I think. Either way, they wont go broke by earning $1/share every quarter.
Mayhaps. I do have shit stained undies
AMC went like double up on the good news from the vaccine. What do you realistically think is going to happen between now and 12/18 that's going to drastically change that? They had to raise money to not go bankrupt. It's going to take years before they're rolling in the dough again, even if everything changes tomorrow. You're missing the point, we're leaving the Covid market now. There is no more hunting for miracles of the pandemic. AMC was already a crappy company before the pandemic. There's no new plan or anything, just less of a chance of them going bankrupt. That's why it's sliding back now. What you want to buy is good shit that's everyone's been really too scared to buy, like Diamondback Energy, Conoco Philips. Maybe some real estate. That's where the money is. Those have been down in the dumps and they're about to come back.
Why is prpl barcoding?
RKT and CRSR earnings caused dips

that means PLTR earnings will go to the moon
Intraday trading only. Made the mistake holding 4 3300c 11/13 this week. Down 80% and will be diamond handing. 

Good luck.
Tech had vastly outpaced everything. Time to take profits.

Now indices are all near ATH and it's a brawl. 

Place your bets, uppies or downs.
Bro wtf. Can’t wait to see how they look when they’re ripe for picking
Lmao ACB with offering
I can’t stop laughing about the four seasons mix up. Like thats some shit from the office lol
Price predictions for tomorrow? $BABA
:(
I mean they don't really make any money and the only reason they mooned is because of Biden winning the election. People are probably selling off now.
Oh you’re so smart
RKT will always fall no matter how much it beats earnings because it doesn’t have consistent earnings and till it gets consistency it is going to get punished.
Only if they have a senior leadership role in the company
how come there's no repost in this sub
A couple thousand dollars is not going to get anyone’s attention. Even if you throw 200k at it
You deserve it congrats and fuck you
You're probably saving money by not being able to see the market lol
Not good.
alibaGUH
What happened to RXT?
Yea, this is the best summary I have seen. 

Jack Ma is retarded (see Elon interview) 

He is also completely fucked. If he doesn't manage to flee the country he will end up a political prisoner soon. CCP executives will end up owning all his shit
Lmao again?
Why would they be?
Ya im holding they're making a ton of money
[deleted]
date or bang
Polls were accurate. Pubs cheated, just not enuf. /s

(see, conspiracy theories are *easy*)
I'm gonna set limit sell of RKT at $30, uninstall RH, and not look at stock market until I get email notification of transaction processed
You would’ve profited 50% if you bought right before the election and sold right after
You’re suppose to just fuck them
I am very very seriously considering buying ITM leaps on this dip with my portfolio
I bought BA calls today, so I guess it's gonna come crashing down tomorrow, huh?
50-50-90 rule
Market Watch are the cucks I see giving weak wristed handjobs behind the local Waffle House after I finish my shift. ACB is already down to 7.40 after hours and showing no signs of slowing down. It’ll drop like a brick past 6.90.
congrats PRPL gang. Thought ya'll went extinct Hope this bump holds up for you boys
What is this flat ass bullshit?!?
I guess im holding through earnings..  I have 11/13 calls that I really need to hit
Because...? They buying someone?
Huh?
[deleted]
Tree trunk heavily bends to one side
Please explain the drop, then.
Wait this happened?
Shit
Are my spy 355P 11/20 fucked?
Cmon nio u pos
apparently, retards over at MarketWatch posted a misleading article saying RKT missed earnings
Fuck definitely, date absolutely not
How do you cash dailys aferhours?
I know this isn’t r/stocks or r/investing but the rotation from tech to value is pretty obvious and will take a while. But you can still yolo options. GE Jan 15 $10c and shit like that.
How’s square doing? Lmao
ACB offering
How many of y’all got calls for Sony? 

I got 99 SNE 93.35c for 11/20. Kinda wish I did then for December
Well rkt call holders, atleast the stonk didnt pull byndbear earnings call 😂😂
[deleted]
Luckily I don't have it, but why is it tanking in afterhours?
There’s no point. Thing ARKF it’s essentialy just TQQQ
Doubled down on June 18 SPY $450c. Probably add some more tomorrow if we stay flat or drop.
Sounds like way more trouble than it’s worth
Wow, my stop limits on LUV and DAL both hit yesterday and I didn't even realize it. Made a cool grand 😋. Crazy vaccine spike
LUVTOFUKMARRIEDMILFS, is that you?
I buy monthlies and just sit on it. eventually it moons but sucks to sit on it while it bleeds/does nothing

You say that like it’s a bad thing? The last time we had a lockdown we tanked for a couple weeks and then pumped for five months straight to all time highs - there’s no reason to believe this will be any different.  Not to mention all signs are pointing to vaccine availability before he even takes office, widely available by early 2021 and lockdowns will end quickly.
You need to load up on way more shares bud. 

Put those tendies to good use.
They lived to the ripe old age of 25.
my leaps are super cool with that.
ARKK still has an average return of 30% per year, even with all the recent Nasdaq buttfuckery. Cathie Woods for the win.
Yeah that wall above 22/23... Next time we get there, I'm just gonna dump it all. I've sold enough covered call that my cost avg is way down but it's still annoying to hold.

Market is just not pricing this as anything worthwhile so there's lil point to hold unless some major catalyst happens.
Just because a stocks called Rocket it doesn’t mean it will moon CMON MAN you know the inverse rule by now
Oh dank! I hadn’t even checked on that for AH. Trading! Thanks
Good luck
Might've been a case of "the first one's free." See his [27k SHOP call](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jr7jq7/27000_on_1120_950_shop_call_1800/)  


Edit: nvm. This dude has balls of diamond. Might actually turn a profit. We'll just have to wait and find out.

MM having a gang bang with calls and put holders lol
I like your style!

Shits going down in my house if NIO isn’t green tomorrow
Fuck I sold my puts today lol
quality dang post
BYND puts gonna print.
i’m sorry...
The IV was over 200% on most 11/13 contracts leading up to ER. The market seemed to already priced in the expected earning report. This had "fuck premiums" written all over it.
Get out
Lol.. Bezos won't do it. 
He wants $AMZN to be like $BRK.A
Sold most of them for 600% have a few more tho
Your execution is cuter. Money is paper anyways, ain't no currency on the moon.
Dam I got ZM 11/27 300P

If ACB tanks will CGC follow? Cause if so my put will be printing like a MF.

All my homies sold RKT at the EOD pump. All of them
If you look at my last post I told everyone to go all in before two weeks ago before the huge run up. Now I’m telling you to not be a retard
He had a bright idea 💡

RKT is a Theta gang conspiracy
Would you date a married coworker?
Y’all got anymore of that vaccine news?
Nah, I'm too lazy to keep track of multiple threads.
Bought a small position in shares after the ER dip. Looks like they received good news and fell anyway. Am I missing something?
>vegan

ban
So basically hold these RKT shares for a couple more days when everyone loses interest and it hits $25
BRUH MY ALL IN $RKT CALLS ARE CLAPPED 

THE MOB IS GONNA KILL ME HONESTLY
I honestly bought 100 contracts. They are so cheap. Expiry is till next year.
SPY 257, 258, 259, 260 calls 11/16 

Got fuckd on baba calls today
PRPL FUCK YEAH
And she went to her boyfriend
How?

🥭
by, say, 11/13?
When you are to dumb to even get the ticker right..... You are holding calls from 4 months ago arent you? When keeping it long goes wrong
Fuck WSB is about to implode.

People got beat by a fucking mattress and failing rideshare service.

PRPL pulling an AMD to IV fuck everyone
Just make more money
Those guys are full retard though so they were destined for failure

In general if you hold options through ER this season you have an 8/10 chance that it goes down in flames. Shares on margin is the way right now, especially with premiums being fairly high on tech.

And buy the dip after-hours before the PJ traders run shit up like BYND and you miss the chance to average down hard
I mainly do small ER plays for entertainment, unless I have actual DD on something that could pay off huge. To me, it's pure betting fun. The money I care about goes elsewhere.

But yea, people should definitely think about wtf they're doing before YOLOing into something "just because ER"
I bought at 79 this afternoon so im actually feeling pretty chill about it. Too much good stuff going on with AMD to be nervous and it's an easy 1% a week in covered calls if nothing else
it sure did. Any fund with tech stocks is gonna get raped this week. I wonder if ETFs are allowed to go cash gang temporarily to save owners money. Probably not.

anyone here play multiple amazon fd's ever? i know not all can afford, but im wondering, if i yolod everything into amazon fd's during its recovery run, would MM's see and wanna fuck me? i see a lot of comment here saying "manipulation at its finest" when an index moons or dips into close on key expiry dates. im wondering if theres similar manipulation in amazon fd's or if its really just about timing...thanks for reading this long and help me out cuz im obviously retarded, would it be better to try and scalp amazon fd's during the recovery with my entire net worth, or to just buy a long dated call?
RKT bagholders in shambles
Lol was gonna buy ACB puts in case of an offering, decided not too
whats that?
Lol I hope not for Lawrence’s sake. Jets are booty butt cheeks
Shouldn’t feel like, but that’s kind of mind blowing.
Fortunately, this is not me.
Yer
Watch how McDonalds had McDonalds robbed from the McDonald’s brothers and you’ll start to understand.

Keep missing out on the gains, then.

I have my money where my mouth is, show your puts if you're so confident.
270 isn’t even a bad price. I have faith in Zucc. If he can’t buy the next big thing, he’ll just implement their shit in FB and Instagram.
Hahaha I am joking man hope you make it back fast😂 and maybe you can try to listen next time 😂😂😂
I was hoping the recovery trades will keep on going up for a few days but it seems some are fizzling out after one day so not sure how long this will keep going.  Next recovery trade catalyst is when Pfizer vaccine gets EUA approval which Dr Fauci just said is about 1.5 weeks away.  November expiration may or may not be in time.  I will close the November calls tomorrow and keep the March 2021 and Jan 2022.  Maybe even buy some Dec calls in a week.

what was the iv of the puts
PRPL!
Lmaoooo
Oh yeah baby, ACB tanking AH. Hope you're holding puts boys and girls.
Go to March, they’ll have Lawrence by then

Edit: I can’t read
It used to feel like an immortal company that had a nice dividend and would never depreciate in value. Boomers are too attached to let it go. T, DGRO, and SCHD are a better dividend investment.

ACB drilling to the core right now lol
I’ve stated that in the comments. I know it’s best to stay away from earning plays because of IV. I was mainly saying this for anybody who does decide to play earnings.
Snap calls 45/41$ 11/13. Think I'm fucked.
Might be good if far out enough
hi friend
If you have to ask turn around and take the loan right back
Don't worry since we are brother and sister in here I'll catch you!

Biiig bet. Thanks for the dd
I took profits right at the peak EOD. I took the 90 day, day trading ban but I am glad I did. Now I have a good reason to switch to TOS.
I tried to bless the board with the gift of a thousand fortunes, but same as ever, the cucks didn’t want to hear it.

Cheers. Good luck

House tendi not gonna rain no more looks like
So how much are you down overall though?
Ford is laying more and more design staff off from what I hear. I don't expect any good new product to come from them. NIO and Tesla get to start fresh and aren't beholden to backwards boomer management.
Finally, the pump that’ll cause the short squeeze

Theta gang got us all
FD's on PRPL, got it.
I'll rope if I fuckin feel like it loser
Louisana? Yeah. It's a shithole ain't it?
RKT just go straight up or down so one side can win
AMD and SQ too
This is phenomenally true
Puts and calls are both going to be worthless. Learn about IV
Me! 👌
For me its either I win and become a giving, kind old wise man or I lose and go full unabomber.
PRPL +8.4%
Buy up as many AAL calls as you can. Gonna see a spike to close to $20 soon
yah it does that, i think it's value will come up some day. Hence im just chilling selling out of the money calls.
I don’t care that much bc I’m in shares instead of calls but this RKT valuation is pricing in rona causing a repeat of 2008. Also playing earnings and acting like it’s not a lotto is stupid af.
Any PRPL gangers out there still?
[deleted]
MarketWatch posted an article right after RKT earning, wrongfully said they missed earning. They have now just updated the article because the comments were calling them out. I assume a lot of people saw the title without checking for additional info and sold. It’s Activision earning all over again. 

Overall, still bullish on the stock. 3% down AH isn’t a lot with RKT. I have $22.5c for 12/24.
Up 5% after hours.
I just gave them 120 last week so theres some dd
Anyone else starting to think this guy legit might not leave AND that senate + the bureaucracy might back him up? Someone tell me if I’m missing something here. Could be a good time for some ITM VXX January calls to hedge.
it’s not a 50% chance of winning- it never is
Jack ma isn’t the CEO and China won’t sit back and let their stock market collapse just to punish Ma. They have made their point and no one will forget it. The pullback below $270 will build a strong base for growth in the coming months. I didn’t say my calls are expiring this week...
I’m trying damnit but I pick the wrong stocks.
i’m trashing what’s happening, we kinda knew tech had to fall eventually the recovery from march was too rapid, and people are starting realize...AMC 6c 12/18 here i come babyyyy
ZM 11/27 355p
FB 11/20 275c
AAPL 12/18 125c
MSFT 12/11 225c
HD 12/11 285c
ER thrusday right? my anus is bleeding!
I really like ARKF but man it got its fucking anus destroyed this week.
ARK is trash. I make better plays than them tbh
That too. IV will kill anybody who plays earnings.
Fr I did better at Vegas over the weekend than here
If you’re still in RKT after it wiped WSB two times in a row, you literally hate money.
FSR calls???
It’s up like 300% for the year
yoloed 11/13 300p today
Is this a rumor about news or news about rumors breaking?

earnings call right now
Thank you, I’ve blown out my account more times than most of these snowflakes have even executed a sale.
Don't worry bud my average cost basis is >11.50 (but I sold most in the mid 20s). That would be cool if that printed.
Sold my shorts yesterday, bought 1/22/2023 20$ leaps instead
I’m thinking about dumping all my shit any buying arkk and arkg deleting all my apps and moving on
Apparently they don’t even make rockets. 🚀.

Guess I’ll just play that fruit company instead 🍏
You’ll make it back. I lost 10k first week I learned options and took baby steps for a year to get my feet set. I’m up hella now. Good learning experience
Moving to Vanguard so that their shitty UI will prevent me from trading
Even if this is gambling I should have a 50% chance of winning but I just kept losing money 🤬
I’m stuck on that lesson too
I know you were joking, but I think I actually did it.
And AMD, idk why they even pushed up to ATH for no fucking reason - that was super lame.

earnings call right now
As in there’s going to be a huge sell off from employees?
Clicked the song link expecting something like Lynyrd Skynyrd and I'd chuckle real quick, close it, and continue on.

Ended up listening to the damn song cuz whoever that is can play like a motherfucker.
At this juncture the market makers have two choices.
Choice one they pump NIO and I end up a happy man with a loving family.  
Choice two they dump it and I become a poor miserable wretch, a ghost of my former self and probably a racist.  
I know there's not a lot of scrupulous men on wall street but I think they owe it to social justice to help NIO out here. I mean I'm talking really racist here, nobody wants that.
Was theta gang on RKT then switched to straight up bullish. I hope it tanks to 0 now out of pure spite.
Plot twist. All 1.5m people on wsb are actually just cramer on alt accounts
Well there goes my gains from last week... I guess market do better with uncertainty now
I’m confused
Just like seas got fucked on earning but is up to 27 from 20...
Ah.  Canadians.  Explains a lot.
Idk why this sub is always so shocked with earnings reports, you're basically hoping for the 1 in 20 odds that they crush and say everything the algos like enough for it to rocket so you don't get iv crushed.  

Though tbf Idk why i check the daily thread when there's a bunch of people playing the same earnings. 

BUT THEY BEAT WHY GO DOWNNN?

WHENS THE MEME STOCK I BOUGHT THAT WENT UP 90% THIS MONTH GONNA GO UP SUCH A PIECE OF SHIT STOCK reeeeee! Well that's usually said every day. 

More autism, less retardation fellas. For fuck sake.
What's earnings?
Ban this fucking retard
GME going up AH
I warned them like four time on the daily and they downvoted and told me to eat their shorts😂😂😂
Any of you crazy lads live in L.A.? How does anyone afford to live in that city
I can’t ever buy zoom not until its back to being sub $30 where it belongs
Bought tech stocks with all the cash i had left.
GLD showing bullish divergence BTW.  Picked up some $190 calls today.
None.

we’re super intelligent
Someone told fauci about SPY calls
It went up 30% in the last week.
[deleted]
you are we todd did
Lmao, get fucking real man, -4% that's barely a drop considering megacap tech is swinging +-10% in a fucking day the last week
The main one is what I have in my portfolio
You missed the whole point.
We don't do analysis. We just YOLO
PRPL!!!
This a gud one
That I need another $10k
Solid cash position, console launches and retail reopening - all good things. Won't go up overnight but looking great for the next few months.

^(with a parachute.)
Fat dividend and generating lots of cash. You're thinking of Goldman sachs.
When are you fuckers gonna realize the market looks forward.

No one gives a shit that you made 100 bucks yesterday...all they care about is how much you're telling them you're gonna make next week.
Gosh the 5 year old tech company you bought last week that is already up 400% this year is overvalued? No, say it's not so... And it's losing to 80 year old companies that have survived worse that are down 80% YTD, as though they're going bankrupt, even after they all report profits in Q3 in the worst year they've ever had? No.... In what world does that make sense? You would think that fundamentals were real or something talking like that...
Bought $215 MSFT 11/20 early this morning really hope I make some money on that . Also should have pulled the trigger on some Tesla calls when it dipped under 400 but my bitch ass was scared
My $62.5p hope you are correct. There is also 33% of shareholders are able to sell off their shares tomorrow, so could see a double down. If it drops below IPO levels, WOWZERS
Everybody here playing RKT earnings is just entertainment, but my time will come

GE 10c 12/18
traders tuition
They already announced buybacks and have $100mm in reserve to conduct share buybacks this year.
Down 30% instead of selling when I was up 30% 😒
best ark etf?
365 tomorrow?
I’m so happy I’m in shares
Probably algos that are programmed to close EOD if they can’t get it to break
Guess im a Zoom supporter now. Saw it plummet so hard, I came to its aid by purchasing for the first time
Bought 5 puts on $spy 3 puts on Amazon 11/13
Y’all keep getting IV crushed then act like it’s random 🤣🤣🤣. See the light with leaps. Leaps still benefit from you from short term pumps.
You just insulted 65% of Americans.
375 to 600? wtf
RKT is getting smoked!
They usually vote on leadership positions earlier ie the Reps have already re-elected cocaine Mitch majority leader
Short BABA, long JD?
Bruh lmao feels bad for them.
Hey fellow BABA investor. I owned a 1/21 300c. Bought in at 15.50 and am down 45%  I roll my strike down to 285 for an extra $400 today. After watching it looks like 264 is massive support. If hit breaks we should be worried and may see 255-250. I put 20% of my account in this trade if it makes you feel any better. Singles day should cancel most bad news and as long your further out you should be fine.
Nah dawg im going long till December. Lets talk when a new wave of shutdowns hit
In at 116
[deleted]
Usually puts don’t work either in this situation. The real answer is don’t play earnings that wsb is talking about
I have a better return than the VOO
[deleted]
Nope
Theta gang won this one
LMAO 😂 Wish I had time to keep track. Would def be v interesting to see. Someone did it in March. WSB was wrong like 60% of the time I believe
Where’s that Reddit bot? Are you that bot ?
I really don't think they will dip below 270 again

I know this because I missed out on buying calls this morning, so it won't dip now that I am watching it and ready to buy
It’s your funeral
Yeah wtf is happening
thats how i feel
What did ya learn boy?
Anyone who owns XOM is getting scammed. They just exist to pay all of their employees inflated salaries until they go bankrupt.
Bye bye rkt cucks you won’t be missed 😂😂
F
Where my zoom put holders at? 

500x earnings and the end of pandemic 6 months away, competitors popping up from all the big tech.
ARK is trash now that TSLA isn't the greatest meme stock in the history of meme stocks.
What happened to BA
just sell calls against your shares.

No "he" is probably a market maker who has a ton more capital. And they also probably can swap shares with other market making desks at the same firm to reduce risk. That's just one of the big advantages market makers have.
*doubt*
I better see $40
Like 70k liquid capital in my account. It’s all fun money so idc about it.
Yay PRPL beat
It was you wasn’t it

I was nearly going to dump that sucker this morning. There was a good ER and then it just tanked. Luckily I stuck with it and it came back.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing 😂
Just did and found nothing other than an article saying “zoom ceo says we moved too fast”

Doubled down on my 11/20 put credit spread for baba. No idea what I'm doing but if it could finish above 300 I'd just be so so happy
Sounds like Stimmy talks are going well 😌
So RKT destroys earnings and tanks but LYFT fucks warning and is rocketing??? Guess where my puts are and my calls are fml
Could be, still likely fucked for the 11/13 calls I’m deep in rn
You're preaching to the choir here. The modern CCP is way more factionalised. You have loyal cliques more so than self-interested individuals these days.

Gonna start selling CC’s tomorrow.
First exploded bc someone said that their Alzheimer drug for FDA approval. Next day it’s halted from opening until close because FDA rejects their application Jaja

This applies to more than fat chicks tbh
Don’t do it. It’s not worth it

How America turned something as simple as a fucking mask into a debate is beyond all logic and will go down in history as the most selfish fuckups of mankind.
dang that is killing it! i bought a whole bunch hoping for a pop. but it looks like these are now a long term investment lol
Rkt?
The last 2 weeks it's been shooting up but for no good reason. Best case scenario I see it drop to sub 60 tomorrow, if not sub 55
damn it don't wanna moon. They announced stock buybacks and everything...

Haha well I'm still long other tech names that didn't work out. But it's a good long term company so this is only short term. I would never sell call leaps on this. Hopefully tech bounces back.
At least I’m not poor AND fat
ALWAYS inverse WSB when it comes to earnings. Trust me.
I was up 3.5K last week and down 1.5K so far this week.  The WSB way.  Once again I managed to buy into a blow off top.  I did the same fucking shit two months ago.  Maybe I will learn eventually.

Anyone concerned by the bearish divergence of RSI on SPY daily
Its an infuriating stock to hold. You neither lose nor gain money over the course of any period of time. If it dips it will definitely recover, but it will never go above 22-23 it seems
Seems interesting until you see them in person and you realize you could have spent that time losing money with the rest of us virgins
Nio only goes up. But for some strange reason, it didn’t go up today.
IM ALL ABOARD!
Tech stocks also mooned all year so it being down 5% was bound to happen and shouldn’t be a big deal
GOD BLESS VALUE
Yea lost 25% of my portfolio (-$3000) today Bc of NIO. I doubled down and went balls deep.
It's okay RKT. I didn't want to make money anyway.

re-“investing”.
Honestly being homeless isn't even so bad. Free food, free healthcare, no burnout from stressful work. It's the ultimate freedom.  You already said you don't have friends or family, so you have no social pressures keeping you in the rat race.  

Instead of getting a shitty gas station job, why don't you perform a few blowies behind Wendy's, save up the gas money, and drive out west, or east, or whatever you feel like. There used to be a drunk train hopping hobo that could have made a killing on YouTube.  Better yet start streaming on twitch and do stupid shit for tips cause you have nothing to lose.
$LMND puts printing tom? ^(please)
I dont own nio. But your points are kinda useless and were all applicable for tesla at some point.
I had it set to 15% (would have set the trigger like at $38 something) but I sold some shares recently to buy more options and I had to close my trailing stop. Set it again today and it triggered at low $39 :(

They are literally just redeeming notes that are coming due next year. I don't take this as any bullish-sign, because if they didn't redeem now, they would be dealing with it next year. It's not like they have such faith in their business and cash generation that they are redeeming 2023 notes
hmmm a shittier version of tdoc which is already a shit company. no thx
Know the feel. Ive been torn up too many times.
Thats why im slowing down now, taking small positions and not risking after hours.

How about a skull fucking?
You must be new to how options work. Options are shares settled not cash settled. Max loss can be more than your spread width since it's share settled. If you don't exercise the long put part of your leg, you can lose a ton more if it drops more.
This market is so boring right now lmao tech was carrying the shit out of this sub and the market in general there isn’t even a huge drop off either it’s just bleeding to fucking death
yeah but if RKT IV is normally 200%...is it really that high? that's why history and context matter. look at TSLA. They always have IV well above 100% while something like F has an IV of 20%. It's all about what the history of the IV is.
I don’t think it mattered
This way you get to enjoy some turkey before you long ROPE
Good luck bro hope you would make a lot of money👍😎
its definitely both

i dumped half of my leaps today when i should have dumped all.

continued to sold covered calls against the remaining 400 odd shares. next time im just gonna sell ITM/ATM cuz its not going to hit anyways

Jesus Christ this is retarded
But it went above $30 last time

Also it was arguably pulled down by the tech crash
Stimulus probably just got a lot skinnier if this is true “House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy Says Nancy Pelosi Does Not Have the Votes to Remain Speaker”

In honor of our RKT gang, I will hold my PLTR calls through earnings
Fauci left bear gang to join bull gang
Bought a put before close. Hope it will have a little 2-3% correction tomorrow, so i sell the put and buy a call then
I’m holding calls at the same strike. 

Give it some time, we should of closed above $30 today but the market is a lil bitch.
im currently using a qpp called robinhood on a Samsung galaxy note 10 with at&ts  fastest 5g plan...pro shit bro

Bear season is open in southern ontario
"More than 15,000 mink in the **United States** have died  of the coronavirus since August, and authorities are keeping about a  dozen farms under quarantine while they investigate the cases, state  agriculture officials said.

Global health officials are eying the animals as a potential risk for people after **Denmark** embarked on a plan to cull all of its 17 million mink. Amid growing political opposition, the Danish prime minister, **Mette Frederiksen**, admitted the cull she authorised last week was illegal."

Lockdown soon?

glad i switched my 11/13 RKT calls for 11/27 ones
Sounds perfect to me
good good, i sold 21p weeklies to some gay bear
Hi same age as you and in college as well, I would just choose a couple growth stocks from each sector (diversify) and hold long term. Invest monthly but limit yourself and don’t fuck with options.
Buy calls on RKT and lose money immediately, or hold shares and lose money slowly hoping that in a decade I break even. Tough call
I feel personally attacked right now
Where are you located? I am a real estate guy. I flip homes.
if you're serious, please run far far away from this sub. unfortunately this 20 year old gambler managed to go from +15% in long term investments to losing 90% of my portfolio after meeting these autists. do i regret it? no. but my advice would be to run and don't turn back. godspeed, retard

Accidentally loaded up on rxt calls instead of rkt
LOL
pussy
Alright so here is the information you need to make a million. Around Christmas time, Trump is going to begin trying to prosecute members of the Biden administration for fake interference in the election. This will go nowhere but Trump is planning to drum up violence in Democrat led cities and incite murder of government officials. This will cause a temporary period of about three weeks that the market will collapse, just like Trump promised. Buy SPY 200 Puts expiring inauguration week. Buy $15,000 of them on December 15th.
why is the chart so crazy lol what happened
What?
Yeaa homie. Share price still gonna be depressed af until those shorts get burned tho but im long af GME
No, It will hit 20 and trade sideways till next earnings call when idiots like me buy it again.
Tell that to the 11/13 $30 call holders.
Probably a year or 2 before this thing starts getting treated as a fintech stock instead of a housing stock, then we'll hit $50/share
Did the same as you. Feel the same as you now.
im trying to learn this, you recommend and yt vids to start? need a setup for swing trading when a stock is about to break out

Bruh “vaccine talks going well” will only fuel us for so long

Mango going to scorch the earth behind him while Biden is openly saying “dark times are coming get ready to stay indoors folks”
Well, your own call’s value will go down but not as much as the CC you sold
Why is BABA down so much today ? Does anyone know? Is it only because of rotation because of COVID? I dont see any specific news.
Punch the new door greeter in the eye really hard.
LEAPs would be sucking too right now, it’s been hovering around $20 for months. Best thing is if you’ve been selling on RKT
Oh I know, I'm riding this all the way to 27
It’s scot-free you moron
[removed]
Wha????
What the fuck was SPY doing today?! Thank god I decided to take the week off
20-30% ain’t nothing to snear at
Is this a Trump tweet? reads like it.
Feel free to look at the shorter term returns on the fund. And it is safe in that its managed and diversified within the tech sector.
Yes it would. But no way they announce a share buyback.  They are burning EBITDA with sales falling. They are sitting on $1.1B in debt and leases, with only $735M in cash, AND they are at such a low point for inventory ($435M as of Aug 1 vs. $1.1 - $1.2B historically) as they tried to preserve cash during the pandemic.

Buying shares back would solely be to try to manipulate the stock, but would hurt the business viability and operations in the long run...
And you're a100% Trumptard
Tqqq, rotation in boomer shit, my ass
I swear Japan has gotta have like 500 movies called Demon Slayer

If you sold CRSR calls this morning I’m sorry
huh?
At least I'm in good company. I have an asston of those 45c. I'm not gonma tell you guys my basis because frankly it's embarrasing. I'm just accepting Jesus and praying that his plan involves running NIO up 2 or 3 bucks premarket.
Do you think my 18p 11/13 will print?
Well TD finally got back to me today after I requested compensation for them fucking me yesterday for 3hrs. They told me I had a good faith violation. Thanks TD, you’re awesome!
Maybe because it’s already over
Sure thing. And since you began soiling your intellectual pants here, Biden has lost NC, and has fallen back below 270. 

“BiDEn iS MUh PResIdeNT ElECt”

*Biden gets unpresidented*

You are about to get gaped. And you’re a salty one, so I’ll be checking in again to mine your soylent tears.
Agreed. I committed to my current position until May 2022, but thereafter I won't be working in an office unless there is a reason. Hopefully they make the choice to leave us home and avoid paying the 1440/each annual parking bill since it's going smoothly. I like my employer, but I am not permanently wasting 15 hours a week on makeup and driving when there is no reason.
I’m a doctor.

I could help and also show them my -99% Robin Hood account
This is the way.
so what?
Theta gang is gonna get bulls and 🌈 🐻 RKT holders alike
Word, possible

I just saw unusual activity on 247.5p 11/13s. I didn’t play it but I wouldn’t be surprised
wait people bought into RKT earnings even though last time it destroyed earnings and tanked? and they’re gonna get IV crushed so much RIP
I haven’t watched any news all day, is this about some crazy shit 🥭 is tweeting?
RKT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yeah that’s pretty god damn retarded

Covid is horrible right now and the only thing the media is talking about regarding it is the vaccine. Hospitals are overloaded like we've never seen before
Yeah man, why wouldn’t an unprofitable ride share company moon during a pandemic?
Yeah except we don't actually have a vaccine right? We just have 90% positive results. I get that can be a reason but its not like they announced any approvals. Just results. And the market decides to abandon tech and jump on boomer shit. I hate Trump and dibt think he'll pull it off but im also not counting out his dirty ways.

Lol ppl buying nio now are late to the party, there is a reason why puts are expensive
Nah bro, played it day 1. Took profits in the 30’s. It saw its high already and will not be climbing soon with news of a vaccine and these bullshit lawsuits teladoc is pushing. It may get back into low 30s but it’s growth potential isn’t there yet. Sorry I made
Money on it but the way it’s been trending the last 2 weeks is not promising. I will say that IPOs in general have been super profitable plays if you hold for the first 3 weeks and it’s one of the bigger names.

RKT only down fucking 3-4%, that's not even that fucking much
It’s basically the same story we just sat through for the last 3 months. Ofc Mitch wants stimulus but low probability the 2 cock sucking sides will actually agree on something

Oh so u are retarded trading on margin I think. I wish you luck, we will both make money eventually BABA can’t drop more.
I dunno.
Next catalyst is fda approval next week. If that happens Nasdaq going down another 500.
Well, I already made +25% on them today and sold them all for a decent profit of $1350

boomers are truly retarded if they think new consoles make GME viable again
A million reasons. 

1) everyone and their mom is doing that and the market makers aren’t going to let anyone make money off of it

2) China is getting serious about antitrust regulations and will likely break BABA up, could drop below 200
Probably only slightly more amusing than actually being retarded.

Earnings call is sounding GOOD
but what's the short %
I am fucking astonished, I sold my shares and I almost NEVER make the right move
Right. Rocket moves alot at night. I am tired of looking at the weird boners on rkt price movement. If he dies he dies
what news?
If FB has a red day tomorrow, it’s time to go all in.
When your EPS expected was 1 cent,  400% isn’t that spectacular...

I sold my cfds at 22.19. Was pretty sure they gona beat the earnings, but i was also pretty sure its gona tank, so sold for a nice 50% profit.

I have 4:1 margin for shares so it doesn't cost as much as you think. I only get 1:1 for options though so I can't leverage up as much.

He's dead, Jim.
My NIO dip calls are up 25%. Pretty satisfied tbh.
McConnel looks like he wants to break away from Trump though, I expect stimulus will happen but it'll be smaller than we want.
Rkt is the equivalent of lil pumps music. It’s hot shit. You bump to it one time and then to the trash. Managed to squeeze some tendies today from rkt. Good thing I left right in time
Fuck stimmy.  Consensus is Mr Market wants a blue Prez and a red Senate, let’s just give it to him.
\*dialtone\* I think guidance changed their number.
I'm  going to need it to go up about 9 more dollars
i mean in terms of market cap. DDOG and CRWD are still valued 10bn (~60%) higher. with dominant player i mean a difference of 75-100bn compared to its competitors

I mean, the past two days, analysts were focused on the guidance, not just beating expectations. Even if they beat expectations, their guidance must’ve been bad and was the cause of the tank.
loan confirmed how do i triple my tendies
Looks like RKTs new favorite number is 21. This stock will go up 4 dollars a year forever. One dollar a quarter

This made sense to me.
It’s disconcerting how accurate this is to me. Are you spying on me?
FDs not so good. 

27c 11/13 covered calls, just fine.
Companies have to report their financials in a certain way, this is known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. It’s been a year and a half since college so i don’t remember the specifics but this affects things like how cash is accrued and how you can write off expenses and stuff like that. But for a company reporting non-GAAP, they can do shady shit like accrue expense to a different quarter to make it seem like the company did better than it did
tech calls
Rotation back to tech will be happening soon. It always does. It always is just rotations between sectors but the extra noise like elections, vaccines, etc. make it seem like it's something else for CNBC and journalists to bs about.

Hopefully sell my NIO shares. I put in a limit order at 44.10 and of course they plummet to 41.55 today. Instant losses after the order filled at 44.04
That's fair.
Is 224% high? Yes, I think so. They will crush 😭
Loss report. Would make stocks slightly easier but not even really. Since good guidance could propel.
Weird huh.

I mean in relation to RKT pal
At this point it’s like they are incentivized to lose money
What our boomer accountants say it is vrs. Whatever the fuck we say it is.

What’s the point of this sub anymore? No one ever gives me retard plays to buy

Where do you live??! Get a new agent.
I would’ve gotten 100% calls, but u also seem a lot richer than me sooo
I get that. But we've had vaccine pumps in the past and they weren't like this. It's not like that's been approved or anything. Just positive results. China just had negative results with their vaccine research plus this Mink covid surge is going to stop any vaccine progress.
Apes together strong
It’s going to open above 21
can you call it an Earnings report if you only lost money ?
RIP
I'm in this picture and I don't like it.
Buybacks announced at earnings would destroy shorts. Less than $100 million could be used to wipe a tenth of the shares from existence, which would increase the shorts as a percentage of shares...
I spent 20 mins researching before close, ended up not having a pulse in sync with the clock and missed my YOLO.....Someone was looking out for me today
Yup took me a while to learn lol but I stopped holding through ERs
Does no one notice the tech boom is over and will mediate back to where it belongs?

Yes I got fucked

Nah, cause people who have been waiting to get in now feel like it's more affordable because they are retarded
I can only wink out of one eye, and it’s my turd cutter
We should have looked at the RKT chart.  There’s obviously a Peace sign @ 3:45
When do they decide to rotate back into it?

next week?

RKT 0 by morning bc I have calls

google it? that's basic

Naw little boys play just options. Grown men got a long term and option account. Pussy.
This stock crushed earnings then sold off and then like slowly throughout the day you saw everyone remember “wtf are we doing CRSR is there at $25 free money” and it just slowly ticked up all day
so how much IV crush do u think 21P RKT gang going to feel tmr.
I’ll tell him but doubt he’ll listen. Thinks he’s the shit for working there. And I’ll keep that in mind

Yeah I looked at that IV and immediately knew it wasn’t worth any plays
BABA SUX
Poors dont run the market...sorry!
Definitely looks likely now. For a minute there -10% AH looked possible. Oh well I’ll probably grab a steak anyways
Yeah it dropped under 80 and I immediately started buying. Won't drop below 70 for a couple of years.
In 5 years...are you retarded? They are the dominant player right now.
I disagree. Things won't be back to normal until fall of next year at the earliest. Either way, tech was the play before covid and will be the way to go in the future too.
oh god i love this retarded market, never change
Dude, just buy calls. You bought shares so that’s why you are losing.
Step 1. Mine some cobalt.
Step 2. Save your earnings
Step 3. Download the Robinhood app
Step 4. Yolo on some 420 Tesla calls
Step 5.  Freedom 😎👍
Puts on him paying the mortgage
I grabbed a bunch of BABA end of day. 200 shares, 5 Jan 2021 270 calls, and 5 November 20 270-280 call spreads.
Sir, this is a casino.
Lol I got accepted for next year hence future
...until an event happens and they get a bigger than expected group of non-performing loans which they don't get paid for.
Who the fuck secretly changed the game settings to nightmare difficulty?
Apple's M1 chip. $APPL MOON?
yeah IV farther out was decent \~ 80% for my Dec calls. Sold some retard a weekly 27C, should've just made it closer lol
where u see this
small street material lol

Tucking piece of shit, RKT more like FKIT
F
Yes I am ded
Famous last words
Who woulda thunk
We're fucked*

We're in this together
Good day to start positioning long on NET. Surprised they even dipped below $60 to be honest, solid slower growth stock that is going to prove to be fairly resilient as they keep rolling out new products and gaining market share. Very slim loss this quarter and I think they will actually start posting profits next year if this holds up
And my equity!
I have yet to learn this lesson like a retard. If I had I would be up by now since I've had some big wins to offset any losses
Oh. I'm using TDA

Why would I care about December 31st when my options expire this Friday? 🤯
Absolutely nobody going to make money off RKT today
Pretty flat lol
9:30 est
No
Yeah thats what I decided with now. Gonna start with 2k  again and add to it every paycheck. Thank you for the input :)
Theta gang is just gambling addiction enablers 

Change my mind
they destroyed earnings lol
GME up 5% after hours, mad bullish
Ah ok I just think it’s ran out of steam that’s all, not dissing it, I was in from 20 and took profit just tired of hearing about it as are the majority of this thread.
Alabama
Something you don’t see at all
Will crash the US economy and drive us into the worst recession of all time.
Apparently last earnings it mooned after hours and then tank to the next morning so maybe this one will be different and it will move tomorrow morning up bigly
I feel like this market designed to just burn everyone out
GME after hours btw
If you can find a bank stupid enough to accept an asset backed loan where the asset is ass sure
Pretty flat lol
first one ia ddog?
Username checks out
[deleted]
Why is it mooning?????After hours 38.34 +2.29 (6.35%)
It didn’t .....
I was still long other names. But now I got out of all my short positions. I got lucky it was tech that went down since my shorts were in tech. I'm basically 100% long now like you. Got into NVDA and BABA and always had MSFT, AMD, and Amazon (which weren't so good lately but luckily my short term hedge worked).
unless this tanks hard, they are.
RKT gang we still mooning this week. Just like you know later on
Who cares about reddit karma lol
Yea, it happens.  
Not the first time I've lost on great earnings.
Is it just me or should CRSR be at 4-5bn mcap minimum? They reported +60% rev growth and 460m in revenue
I bought 2 min before markets closed. Like a dumbass.
JKS vs RUN vs TAN thoughts? Both individual stocks have done well this year as has TAN. TAN would insulate from big swings a bit, but that works in both directions.
This is a paper hands shake off.  Just wait til all our options expire, then the buying will begin.
Lol rip team rkt but I warned them😂😂
Even though I had no intention of holding RKT through earnings (but did because in a dumbass) I’m glad I went for monthlies. Still can salvage these and won’t get as horrifically fucked by IV
what stocks are these
[removed]
not much how about you

People that come out and give explanations why the stock is up or down after it happened is hilarious 😂
same. more averaging down. fuk, just gonna start checking this POS once a month and either buy/sell some shares
I honestly thought we were fucked for a minute there, just put my phone away and said fuck it. Last I saw it was at 38, and all of my itm debit spreads were fucked. Now, they're still fucked, but they are fucked much less.
yeah we should do it weekly
But if you look on YouTube, the had actual NIO car reviews going back a year or so. And the cars actually looked pretty good
wtf thats retarded
It really do take a lot of talent to be wrong all the time
Yeah, kinda wierd though, the earnings call hasnt even started
Flat for a while and then boom
Meanwhile. PFE stock does nothing.
I forgot that tesla is 100% American made. Lol you sir are fucking retarded.
reporting for duty. gap up tomorrow sir
How do you think it’ll be tomorrow and this week
Lol my LYFT puts vaporized instantly
I’m only able to see the NYSE aggregate info when I’m looking online. They don’t seem to have a search function like Nasdaq. Of course I may have missed it and I’m just blind.
> gme

Paid off 125m in debt using cash. Should be positive tomorrow.
Nobody makes billions and shits themselves better than RKT
We’re in it for rhe long haul papa. 1/15 bought the fatass dip today
People buying calls that are 20% OTM with 3dte and 170% IV on them shocked they can't retire at 19 on a $1000 investment.
[removed]
I saw that too. Is it false?
Guess imgur cut my Pic...

 https://i.imgur.com/zDGFBN2.jpg
And here we have another “investor” who thinks ERs are only about earnings
*screams quietly*
Beating expectations by 400% = down 10%
Missing expectations and losing billions= up 7%

SIMPLE MATH PEOPLE, KEEP UP!
I got my bad time out of the way during regular trading hours today.  AH Earnings are the worst kind.   
Have the **whole** night to think about what your life could have been like if you inversed yourself.   
Get your over leveraged ass some rest tonight.   
The pain will still be there in the morning.
Thank you. I will add this 😂
Maybe it’ll rocket tmr
sold some retard RKT 27C weeklies... sorry :( But in turn I got myself some 25C for dec lol

You're going somewhere fast. The only thing good about this trade is they're IMO options.
What was the guidance
We play options here gtfo
Guys my uncle works at SPY and he said they are about to file for bankruptcy. Do with this what you want
How?
Remember when Trump tweeting that a stimulus wasn't going to happen caused a $9 drop in spy immediately. Now it's starting to feel like we'll never get a stimulus and just nobody cares. People are going to get evicted once the temporary measure runs out on Dec 31st. Shareholders don't give a fuk
Theta gang here, I’m happy with rkt
Rekt by RKT. Willing to trade used power tools for canned food.
I would not put it past RKT to gap up tomorrow with the share buybackS
Where did you see this? I may focus on this
More
At least put holders get fucked too
Bought the dips on AAL, NIO, and MJ, classic meme play, waiting to wake up to a  big green dild up my butt
Why is every news outlet showing LYFT eps at -1.46 while RH shows -.89? Am I missing something here?
Proof or BAN
Sometimes I have a bad day and lose 15 or 20k.  Do I downvote everything?  No..because I'm not an asshole.
NVDA gonna moon after it's earnings I think tho
stonks got that after hours game tho
RKT flat even with drop AH
Try XLK
[deleted]
they’re buying back $1 billion worth of shares

Why is this sinking?

dumped 1.3k into a single 60C for jan 2022. Fk it haha hope this shit goes to like 300 by next year
tech is just dead man.  Gonna have to find some news plays.

How does rkt dump on such great earnings
been pitching LEAPS for a while now
No worries bro at least you didn’t lose money👍it was actually lucky I saw that buy and wrote here I usually don’t look at earning plays
Bruh...just delete this post
This is peak WSB autist forecast
Ok
What the fuck do you do for a living?
Well I got out of my positions up 60% end of day today. I'm just looking at the IV. I'm sure it's a solid long term stock.
The rental market is tough as well.
On it
i aint hear no bell
I'm bull/bear and half cash gang just in case!....I try and ride the market direction.
[deleted]
It’s both ways really, IV was so high that anyone who bought options is fuckeeeedddd
His family tree doesn’t have any branches.
Spy opens at _____ tomorrow.
Too autistic to fail
Imagine watching WSB shill NIO all day and ree about buying a great dip... and then buying RKT FDs

🤡
For real
A startup that’s been making me money lol 😂 will hold strong
He was 23.
Oh I thought I read that as a 95c
I’m not in the earnings call but rocket sub is mentioning google, fintech, AI

Can someone in the call give an update that isn’t just mania
$1 billion share buy back will be around 50 Million shares in a 1.9 Billion Shares Outstanding. Not enough to make a move
Well there goes 100 lmao
Just be careful
Lol r u me

Why is it 'our' parents house and 'our' brother?
lol..zoom out. I remember gyna-USA bullshit when it was around 200. Moved between 180-220 for a while. This CCP thing would also go away: ANT IPO isn't baked into a $266 price anyway.
Bulls name their children Karen
Yea somewhere around there
Ok
Calls is it then
Yeah that’s called a long term investment with long term return averages, not a “safe” and steady 15% every year.

Aaaaand another baghold. This time DDOG. Beating expectations by 400%. Gets dumped 10%
I was a bear, I feel the opposite. We will likely get 2-3 green days for every red moving forward. It sucks watching your money burn for weeks hoping the world ends.
im def a degenerate. was still up 400% on nio calls monday and instead of selling  


# i bought more

Yikes. Rent it out.

RKT is going to do great long term. I'm sorry your FDs might not work out. But nothing I saw is bad. It is phenomenal growth. No other mortgage company is even close
I thought LYFT puts were a sure thing. Jesus, I have no clue what I am doing
Yeah the more I think about it the more I'm like..well there's JD and PDD which are also very big e-commerce platforms, as well as other small ones. don't feel like Alibaba should actually be impacted too much by antitrust as long as the CCP is reasonable. Though betting on that could prove to be a bad idea...I guess we'll see. 

Also short term I'm selling you those calls against my long ones ;)
THEY MENTIONED JASON MOMOA IN THE RKT EARNINGS CALL ::MOON:: ::ROCKETSHIP::

It’s BA red or green tmrw?
yep
I really need to start unwinding some positions.
I guess some bought OTM FDs?
RKT earning call sounds great. Why the fuck did it drop?
I bet there’s one guy on this sub who played Sony calls and is rolling in tendies Rn
They wanted a 20 percent AH moon mission
Someone shocked by their RKT loss downvoting everyone.
well the markets moved sideways today
Hello, BearyAnal! I am afraid I cannot let you get away here! It's spelled **scot-free**, my good Redditor! Have a nice day!
Well, the 100k of weekly calls that traded today are probably worthless.  But I too don't know shit.  Long Dec 23/30 call spread for .70
I live in Charleston, place is booming.
IV gonna eat your steak
everything is cooling off from the looks of it. Except CRSR
ok, interesting pick but maybe too late?  I just did some quick math, it went up 17% this week, that's $5billion market cap increase.  Is it even possible to make $5billion profit distributing vaccines for the entire US, let along if there are multiple distributors?
Very low volume AH. Roku kinda did the same thing. Seen it happen all the time with low volume on things like IRBT and other companies. I mean obviously it could go either way, but most likely that way is up
Diesel truck companies aren’t the place to keep your money for real growth
Boooo
Dropping now after ER
Same. Hope someone will save our Wendy's
Imagine being an rkt holder. You see it’s up 3%, you go and tell your wife and kids that they are rich, you tell your boss you quit, you go and buy a yacht.  

Only to come back and it’s down 3%
fuck lyft
Yeah cause the shit always fades when market opens
why are you guys still buying RKT?
Too retarded to understand, someone explain
Stop buying weekly calls for earnings. Do debit or credit spreads to play earnings. Taking iv crush on the chin is stupid, very rarely do stocks move drastically enough to overcome it. If you have longer term calls that is ok too.
Lyft fucking stop and die
Just a pullback. Back to $50 EOW
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UP!
Whoever didn’t learn 🚀 the first time around then sucks for you lol
Riding to $0
Let me guess, babalicious? Why would you think it’s going up after Jack Ma called out the CCP? You don’t fuck with the commies and think you’ll get away scotch free.
i think so, but it might dump tomorrow morning
i was gonna sell covered calls on rocket but i didnt because i would have had to log in to schwab and see how red my account was to do it
Guys my grandmother works at Enron and she said look out for a 30% crash by early 2021

I bet people sold on the marketwatch headline that said RKT missed earnings
in a sense yes
Flat AAPL has been keeping it for dropping with the rest of tech
WTF are you expecting people to take away from this green squiggly line with zero other info? Usually a line straight up and green is a good thing. Applies to stock market and  election vote counts.

Yeah cube steak
Yeah it’s funny. Everyone loves value plays but BABA gets a fair value of $296 and drops 10% below the fair value. I don’t focus too much on fair value estimates but BABA has other factors (Biden win, strong sales, singles day) that I think legitimately cancel out any downside risk from the increased regulation on Chinas part. China won’t let their stock market collapse to punish baba. The only real question is when will the stock market see the upside and will it do so before my calls expire?
Grindr
Fake news. MMs dont care about getting long on a stock.

It shows they have a lot of cash now. Problem is that RKT hasn't convinced enough people that they can continue to make good money in the future, when the low interest refi boom ends.
I was cucking your dad before you even knew what WSB was, watch your mouth.  And to answer your question, yes.
It's up almost 7% for the week. Markets usually take a year to go up that much, not a week. But its prob gona go up another 7% this week so fuck me
Doesn't matter how many you bought, IV crush still hits the same way
[deleted]
At this point nothing concerns me, last 2 months everything I do, it goes other way! gl
if RKT goes under 20.50 im buying a fk ton of shares. It doesnt deserve this :(
Buy 100 shares and let them sit then...
I do - I had SQ calls and panic sold before earnings - would have made thousands if held.

Show us your boobs
I started yesterday at $2300. Was at $6300 by 9:30, watched it bleed all day to end at $2300. Today started down $700, fought back to end at... $2300. If there's any positive, and assuming this is a bottom, I'm positioned to crush any kind of tech rally. No way this can go tits us.
RKT crew was so loud today I bought a single 19p for $43 thinking I’d buy a steak with profits if it printed. Looks like I might be getting some steak
just silly
I didn’t really know what to buy so I did nothing . I’ll wait for Boeing to come down , don’t really know what else to do. Maybe nio daytrade if we’re green tmrw
I read this and went to see what happened to RKT. -3%. Was expecting -30%.
That’s nothing to shake your hips about
I don't think it's possible to predict. Depending on how mutated it is and what part of the virus the vaccine presents there may or may not be cross-immunity.
😅
Big lines for the PS5
I just got my robinhood account 2-3 weeks ago. Since I have more seniority, I’m gonna say yes.
Its literally 5% of my funds so I dont really care about the offering. Just a fuck my life moment. AAL made me money in the past which is why I picked it
Sweet home , Alabama
I am. 300% this year in this account so I can't bitch at all to be honest but its still a big loss today.
Third time I've sold RKT puts, third time I've bought them back after a day or two for a weak ass 20-30% profit, third time I've felt very smart the very next day.
looking for gme new data pls
Y’all seriously don’t even know what MMs are

STIMULUS TALKS GOING WELL
Rkt to the moon except in this instance its the challenger
ZM, MSFT, BABA
Lmao you got me. Need 5 more % please
PayPal tanked after earnings and mooned the next day. We have hope, RKT gang.
RKT announced $1b share buybacks. So, tomorrow we should start mooning.
That’s because you’re doing what everyone else is doing you must inverse the popular choice.
My dick doesn’t even twitch anymore when GME pumps AH 😔

Never gets old how these companies make billions and billions of dollars of revenue but their webcast/conference calls always sound like they're using technology from 1950s. 

Except AAPL. Apples earning calls are fire
No vaccine could still offer protection it really depends on the mutations
At this point with the way market is you have to be crazy to b e playing ER with calls
theyre dead bro
Hot damn, that's exciting.

RKT bulls in shambles, eating Campbell’s, downvoting everything
LYFT mooning
That’s literally what I’ve been afraid it is, but I’m pretty young for it to have one
Man I've only been doing it for 7 months and I'm tired. Idk how people do this shit for years and years. I'm also prone to hobby hopping and getting bored of trading. I just bought a shit ton of leaps and selling calls against it now because it's the easiest strategy that isn't just buying shares. I'm done with the wild swings and trying to make it big quick. I'd rather just chill
If you a downvoter you probably also a mouth breather
Well, I may be a bit hyperbolic with my use of “huge”
I had some, then I bought at the top, then I bought at the bottom and then I realized it’s about 25% of my portfolio
😂
Cry come? Sounds like the herpes
Increase in Chinese consumerism and rapid expansion of Chinese middle class. I guess there is a possibility it could be someone else instead of BABA, but they certainly have a running start. More ingrained in Chinese culture than Amazon is in ours. BABA keeps China competitive on the world ecomm and cloud stage. P/e is low and financials are robust. All you need to do to see that it’s not priced in is the math.
With high IV. Theta Gang 😝
Now it’s tanking even when it beat estimates
You’re the weird one for understanding alien language
Everyone be really quiet about a vaccine so we don't spook tech any further
Spy calls means theres no Christmas this year tiny tim
Idiot, buy more calls, what are you doing
Yes, but the new short interest is out today, I can't find it anywhere yet though
It has mutated but it’s been fairly well contained
I don’t think I’ve ever had an earnings go right for me smh
I feel like we should have a slideshow of IV crush earnings just from the past 3-5 months for the new autists that visit this sub. We’d probably lose less ppl that way
No
Too many people are playing options, not enough people are going long
This has gotten to the point that even holding shares is vomit inducing.
Maybe yes maybe no
Well he is accelerating almost the entire time in the negative. Even with the shitty outward jump each second of free fall is 9.81 m/s of acceleration towards that hard ass fucking ground. Soooo if we ignore the jump and treat him like a dropped dude, over 2.5 seconds he would have reached a speed of 24.4 m/s

However I’m high as fuck and dropped like 10k today and could be totally wrong
Its on their website

Well at least my 25c for RKT are 11/20

Maybe some godsend analyst will raise their PT. 

Prob not tho 🤡

GME using cash to wipe 125 million in debt. That's why they're spiking AH.
Well, I hope it doesn't. But I'm going to hold it long term. If it tanks, I'll double down and buy more at a lower cost. I mean, I've been doing this for less than a week, that's what your supposed to do right?
34 days?!?! Damn!
I too am on the $62.5p train. I can see this falling lower next few days, with big sell off!

Whaaaat? RKT fell after earnings? Again? No way!
LOL
Post- earnings tech stock dip is so predictable. Same thing happened to CRSR today.

It's done.
Small gamble on DDOG and RKT. Another day, another gay.
Aaaaand we're poor again
I feel like this antitrust thing will be similar to how US manages AMZN, AAPL, or FB. However, I do believe CCP will take a stronger action than the US does. I think most of the rules will be around algorithm for suggesting products to buyers to reduce the monopoly issue, and since Alibaba is  the most popular platform (I assume) people will still use it regardless of the adjusted code. Thus, think it will be back to 300 level.. just matter of how long. And idk why I bought more calls for the next 2 weeks. hope this is not too dumb
Yea their revenue will be huge and they offered ADS which will be used for operation purposes. I don’t think it’ll be that big a loss
Why can’t I listen to the RKT earnings announcement? I AM A FUCKING SHAREHOLDER OF 300 SHARES, I DEMAND ENTRY
it sold off for no reason though
Think I’m just gonna stick to making 2k a day and cashing out. I don’t wanna hold shit with these crazy swings
It does not

This is data as of Oct. 15. Additional increase of short position by 2.49% to 70,340,00 short volume. Prior period had 68,630,000 short volume. 102,270,000 shares outstanding in total. So it seems that 68% of the outstanding shares are reflected in the short volume.

Well you learned the best lesson there is - never try
What salty cuck is downvoting everything? I lost money on RKT too but I would never downvote my fellow bois for no reason smh
Show her you're the one running the show.
All you clowns need to listen up. Stop fucking around with bitch ass stocks like RKT and DDOG. Buy CRSR and PLTR. GO LONG. Do not get fucked by volatility. This market now knows what the fuck is going on.
Spy is touching $330 before November is over
It got pulled by qq imo
Listen to the earning call. They are about to give guidance
It sounds really dumb when people say “I make so many wrong decision, it’s like the MM’s are watching me.” I’ve seen this multiple times on this sub in the last week. 


Yeah, no shit, they ARE watching you.  They see all your orders. It’s literally their job to watch all of us so they can set their spreads and fuck us all in the ass. I know the point of the statement is to suggest that the trader made so many poor trades that they feel there’s a larger conspiracy at work than their own stupidity but like, can’t we come up with a better way to suggest this? 

Proposed replacements:

“I made so many wrong decisions that It’s like I’m 95% of traders and I should just buy boomer ETFs and get a job.” 

“I shouldn’t have joined WSB, and now I’m broke and I have AIDS from being so retarded.” 

I’m open to other suggestions.
Thanks man. Feeling a little beat down that's for sure but I will regroup and move on.
F
What stock buy backs are usually bullish it means less dilution.
Indeed
They installed the rocket upside down. Had the best week of my stock life and blew 80% of profits on RKT. I belong here. May as well mod here. Learning to really take it in the bear hole.
They're paying off debt early to balance their books 

No wonder no one here understands what the fuck this means
They didn't miss though. Puts on MarketWatch.
sad part is it prolly will be

Why is RKT coming back up?
Watching comments like "Rocket turned out to be the Challenger Rocket" and then seeing that it is only -3.5% on the day make me pretty depressed about my tech portfolio rn.
Lmao lyft
I told you bitches to buy puts on RKT. I’ll be on my yacht tmrw

What the fuck is that you queer
rkt earns double it's Market cap in revenue and it goes down lawl
RKT coming back to space
Ur gonna be rich
RKT ER not bad for leaps and shareholders tbh.  Pretty solid report.  If I go shares I would buy it.
no its out of my view because its in an alternate universe right now, will settle on planet mars aka $30
Never hold thru earnings when the stock is expected to beat earnings...... y’all did it to yourself
Volume seems light on RKT wouldn't count it out yet.
RKT beat and has a share buyback program of 1 billion. Some outlets reporting a miss?

Either way, I'll get IV fucked regardless, but unwound for some profit on that 3:30 Pump.
Why its gonna trade sideways till the next ER and dump again
can confirm, am retard.
Was it worth it?
not listening to earnings. What happened?
What if RKT gives poor outlook, tries to drop price so they can buy back cheaper? Or am I just being crazy
Thank you
I guess not in this market. Motherfuckers
heres comes RKT guidance
Yeah its just weird that it took a fat dump this morning then ends up pumping for seemingly no reason
RKT MAKING A COME BACK
That’s what in thinking.. I got March calls.. so I will probably hold this pos. Happy cake day btw

One of these times i will learn to grab puts for an earnings. Its clear i hate money right now tho. Or money hates me
Explains why today felt slow and slightly retarded
What does this mean
That about sums it up
too many...
Looks bullish to me.
Should have put rkt insteaf man
lmao, same.
Dang when i told people to hold after earnings, I did say I was retarded why would you listen to me?
Are you rich now?
Sober day 2, boys
just chill for a few days unless you have 11/13 calls.
dude. leave while youre ahead.
Anyone pick up nio calls 👀
I think your camera needs glasses
ZM, CRM, RH
Remember that this is RKT in peak performance. Once rates start rising and refis slow down they're going to do worse
69%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For sure. It's been a great year, still up big but this one hurt. I'll take my lumps and live to fight another day. That's what we do. We are autists and we are fucking awesome!

its okay brother, we will get it back
Imagine thinking tomorrow won’t be red across the board.
painnnnnn this happens too often where earnings are great and still collapse
Did nothing in your head say that maybe you shouldn't type that out?
Keep in mind much of excess capacity is for things that aren't covid related or covid ready... and that the pfizer vaccine has to be stored at negative 70c (-90F) meaning few placed will actually be able to facilitate it. Anyone know what tickers are good for calls on dry ice?
RIP Retard
They just announced 125m in debt buybacks.  Squeeze is probably a ways off, but I think we start seeing green again sooner rather than later.  Inst have been filing 13Fs showing share accumulation almost daily for two weeks

That picture of Bezos laughing at my broke ass is shattering my fragile ego.
RKT: "We beat earnings and have been doing famtastically in every metric we've got, billions of cash, record performances"
Also RKT: *goes down like a fat kid on a seesaw*
Next week vaccine news is over, more lockdown, nasdaq rally. Mark my words
Only ever got FTCH right. Everything else I played earnings on shit the bed.
are you still up all time? im not :(
Sad that it never even spiked before lol
Good for stonk price but shows they don’t really have anything to do with their cash
Lyft puts are dead. I was up so much too.... always sell before earnings ok
Wow RKT peeps still pushing that stock. Mmmkay
They’re going to be worthless homie sorry 😔
Snap, pins
ooooh I cannot wait to jack off to RKT loss porn tomorrow
Damn. Sorry man. I feel your pain. Been there
The year is 2045, RKT is still trading in the $18 - $23 range
How are those puts treating ya
my $1.50 loss on 20 RKT shares really hurt
EMERGENCY: We have a rogue RKT heading for the bull base. All personnel take cover immediately, although you are most likely a goner anyway.
And awwwaaaayyy we go
Bought qqq puts and uvxy calls eod. Let's see how this goes.
why isn’t rocket taking off? sad face
35 contracts DDOG puts.. $85 strike 💪🏽
I'd be surprised if it opens higher than 250
Just so we are clear I am in no way liable for what may happen. I'm just an idiot with hope
Well now you know why they bought all their shares back.
Oh man this one got me good 🤣
new PT is 46 fam
RKT will drill all day tomorrow. They want to buy back stock... they won't do it at a high price. So, they tank it so they can buy back cheap. Sell RKT tomorrow at open or lose bigly.
Yeah it should raise share price but not instantly
Common theme this week lol
nah was jus gonna say ask for advice on the sub if unsure
Why are those kids not in the cave digging to save my TSLA calls?
Lmfao same. I was up $2000 from the last week. And now only like $700 i want me tech gainz back
Why would they have a huge loss
See that makes sense I was so confused

Rkt aka challenger 2.0
How disrespectful would it be for DKNG to report bad earnings on Friday with the Masters going on?
Pain.
Not yet. Soon.
I’m so excited to buy in to RKT for cheap
[deleted]
What’d he say?
Remember that one company that shot up after earnings? No one does
FUCKING FUCKING FUKKKKKKKKKKK
lmaoo maybe my rkt 16p 11/13 might print lowkey
RKT tanks each time after earnings
Yep, had two bad ones.  They really feel like a heart attack.
Here, hold my beer...
It was. It was a bad trade. Simple as that.
I’ve found my calling as a bear. 
Being a bull is too stress-ful it’s easier to call the top and let it fall. Plus don’t play earning.
We can help you get it to 0k instead.
RKT shitting the bed good or bad for Zillow?

Guess I’ll be carrying these RKT bags longer. The shit has to get back to $25 some time.
DDOG is DDEAD
<3
I grabbed some 11/20 18.5 puts. Definitely inverse when they start going this wild.
Greed will get ya. Was already up over 100% on my RKT calls but wanted to see that 4-5x. Oh well. Hopefully they are worth something tomorrow

Should have seen it coming right? Fuck you
You’re supposed to put the thrusters on the bottom not the top of the rkt
Aren’t stock buy backs bullish for a company??
Which one
What was ur reasoning for buying dow puts?
Crazy to think i scored a 10 bagger on RKT calls when it hit 31 back in early Sept


Only to give it all back on AAPL calls in September
Any guesses as to why CRSR pumped during the last hour and into AH?
My 355 call is -400 $ you lucky
If youre selling RKT right now, I guarantee you're selling someone alot more patient.
yep
I’m seeing .87 on PredictIt

Can't see his shoes
Like I’m confused at the strategy bruh
I'm down about 20k
Crushed earnings and bouncing around +/- .20 after hours.  Bull shit!  Net income +500%, origination +100%.  Come on
Funds and the federal reserve will not allow what’s really supposed to occur in the S&P 500. It’s not some conspiracy either. All of the S&Ps biggest stocks are down considerably. If things functioned normally the S&P 500 would of hit a circuit breaker. The biggest weighted names in it are all down over 2% if it took the blow it should have people would of kept flushing and flushing out their holdings.
Gettem...honestly $BABA will pop back soon. Nothin has changed. Weak hands gettin scared again
good for shorts

RKT selling off again after beating ER. Whats new.
Ya man it feels like you can’t breath, chests tight, senses heightened. Just know your body is pumping adrenaline making you go into fight or flight and your body is not bringing you down into rest and digest. Sympathetic nervous system needs to calm you down. Go work out, breath slow and deep through your diaphragm, stretch, camomile tea, take a walk. Do whatever you got to to just relax and digest. It’ll pass or you’ll just crash from the adrenaline eventually, can last a few days.
Yeah which site? Bovada already paid out if you bet on Biden, is over.
Why puts on Amazon?
I guess FUBO won today
I called RKT almost exactly.
People still trading RKT? On earnings? Sheesh do y’all like losing
No one kill themselves
sorry to hear. you're ok in my book, though :)
Rocket to the middle of the earth lol
Funny how there will be reasons no matter its up or down :)
switch positions into weed cause they opened real down and they had continual gains thru the day
DDOG just yeeted itself off a cliff lmao
Theta gang won
i own shares so i’m fine!
Rkt hasn’t seen a 3% green in months but sees 3% red every other day

It doesn't look that high when he first jumps, but then it just keeps going and going
Biden is 87c on PredictIt
Why?
I've swung that shitty company so many times. Ino sucks but boy is it predictable
I felt like an asshole buying at 31 and then bought many dips along the way. I’m down to 24.96 CPS.
CRSR stock + calls
aaaand she crashed
Man CNBC says it post market smh I feel scammed
Bought them when it popped back up to 99 thought there’s no way it goes green and then it went big green
Thoughts on actual EPS affecting jan puts?
RKT call fucked, too many WSBers on
Sold RKT $21 poots. So, not much.
Do you live underwater?
I dont keep the side boys from her. Thats the least of my worries sir
This comment confirms a good ER is not priced in lol
Yeah it’s nice! But is sucks if you have TP hands because you may just sell at small losses and over time those add up lol

But it’s nice having the freedom of day trades
Whats even more retarded is GOP winning by 60 EV is getting like 8%..
RTK flies about as well as the 737 max.
ok cool thanks for the advice
Yeah but why did they go from $10 to 0.9c
i sure fucking hope i threw my last bit of cash into a 62.5p

Be careful with that. There's no guarantee this isnt the top for all tech. If so, NVDA is going to go down not up. 

Unless you're buying leaps puts that is
Chances are its anxiety
DataDog became DataBitch lol.
Why were people trying to scare NIO holders with fake leaked low earnings the other day? They’re going to report a huge loss. They’re supposed to. Their growth is all that matters.
>$BABA is a guaranteed 4 digit stock a few years down the road

What makes you such a bull on BABA? And why isn't it priced in already?
It will. Just a matter of when. I think we’d both prefer tomorrow...
You’re going to be okay actually I promise<3

Been better. Still waiting for that gme squeeze. If snap can double overnight I have hope for a gme squeeze
Ouch man, didn’t play out
Who just got raw dogged by ddog? How about retcked by RKT? Lifted by lyft?
Need them to release that tonight lmao
And it’s so expensive no company wants to use em, you take their ideas and make your own system that mimmicks the parts of ddog you want and it shows in their numbers
You should’ve just bought every other stock
This can’t be real
I’m drunk and it is because of RKT
did he died?
What does the H stand for?
they wont have money for a legal team at this rate
The hell is wrong with pypl?

Just sell before close. It's not difficult.
wont buy calls ans already have shares.
Lol, I hear ya. But I always imagine that ... Maybe being a security guard or something... Instead of just doing crossword puzzles all the time like TV teaches us, right?
werent you up a  ton today
You got puts ?
Just got a phone call saying the unit of the federal reserve has an atrest warrant for me, I SWEAR JPOW I DONT HAVE PUTS
Is this good or bad?
Titled "Hall of Shambles"
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd
Shit.
neither.  it’ll be flat
oh shit
Heres the call rkt boys. Hope for the best expect the worst. Always more shmekels to be made
I held my RKT calls overnight.  I also thought a $1bn buyback would be good for share price.  I am a retard.
If tech doesn't explode to the upside ill cry
RKT call and put holders in shambles
Shit son I lost £300 this week and feel the heat
$LMND gonna tank tomorrow when they miss earnings. Not usually a gay bear either, but this price is running off fumes rn
Rkt earnings miss equals pump right?
Thursday
I can’t imagine what NIO earnings will be like next week lol
Rkt u dum dum
Fuk you if my calls expire worthless Iam out.
How do you have any home equity? My house is down 30% since 2015.
we hafta nut the fuck up!
You can always check the SPY portfolio to see the holdings bro it’s public info lol
They had a 23-28 spread today in strike difference I would definitely hold that sucker. You have time on your side with that position. 
You could also roll it out and buy something in 2021 and just sit on it if you have the patience
Ikr?! Too bad they don’t have a jpow to keep stocks up up up!
Eat shit, ONEM haters
It’s better to sell options and collect premium
Exactly. I need to step back for a bit... Asses the trades and make a new plan.
Oh man 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Fuck this vaccine, worst thing ever
Jmia drops 20% my puts make 100, baba drops 6% My calls make -500%
the dude who said ivr calls was the play. u sir, have a handy coming your way. just say when
Posted under fundamentals 😂😂😂😂
RKT killed earnings, rev is up, margin is up, they buying back a billy in shares. Let the drilling commence.
I’m a retard for buying RKT right before earnings. But I am a a bit less of one because it was shares this time at least
itll pump itself bro just get in im up like 75% i got in on a call at ~$115
Oh shit DDOG... I’m dead
What can you afford then lol
I’m just here to see half of this sub either wiped out or get rich from RKT.

Good luck.
Guess it's only a Florida thing
This link is not a cock
Maybe eventually but not in the next year. My guess is maybe $45-$50 in the next 12 months. They are doing a lot of acquisitions so my biggest concern is too much debt accrual.
If apple doesn't release apple fitness plus by then you might be okay. There was a huge sell off in pton the moment apple announced fitness subscription in their presentation a couple months ago. I expect the same to happen once it's released
i'm pretty deep in calls and shares.
I would like this to be true

NIO is officially done, JP Morgan price target met now if we could stfu about it and carry on losing money that would be great.
This earnings season yea
HMMMMM why is RKT going the wrong way

I was promised $30

halp
fuk i hope not
He’s dead. GL with that.
Fucked!
All in shares and sold covered calls, so i guess im okayish with the results. RIP to the guys who bought my 11/13 25C's though.
how’s everyone holding up

SPY 375c december leaps
1k in for 11/20 24.50s and 3K in for 12/18 28s, we got thisssss
Why are you scared she is gonna find your side boys?
wait for trend reversal. better to be late than early.
calls are dirt cheap rn. theyre gonna moon after earnings. they are basically partners or they host every big vidya game thats popular with serious gamers/esports. plus theyre launching essentially spotify in china, and theyre expanding to the US. basically everywhere says buy. oh and also they dont follow GAAP since theyre chinese company so they will gaurenteed beat earnings (look at their past earnings reports. I have $90 calls expiring 11/20,11/27 and december
Something for folks that probably shouldn’t be here to begin with
So are we just not going to mention how disassociated spy is from tech? Seems bullish to me...
What on?
Yeah, I bought 100 shares in June for about $7, sold at $14 right before it ran too $22. Using leverage this time :)
Rkt is well known for spooning behind you and sticking it in even if you said no
Sir this is retards r us
Idk, they're both being absurdly hyped on here, but long term though?? WSB has a short attention span for real
RKT down after hours due to the shitty music on earnings call.
Literally just got a 50k loan against my house equity from rocket mortgage. Should I yolo it into Puts on RKT?
RKT ceo dicc picc leaked, fired immediately
I got my puts in this morning after learning about the new stock offering. I am really doing fine.

excellent call. good luck

I used to work for deloitte a few years ago as a junior analyst. Tell your cousin to get out asap. That company is toxic af. They don’t give a fuck about their employees. Esp the offices in 30 rock. You hear me Marc Mills? Fuck you and your ego

Oh and they suck at their predictions. You want good predictions? Pay attention to what deutsche has to say. They know their shit
Here's the pattern that GE has followed for years now:  
1. Some great news happens to the company and it goes up a small amount  
2. An Analyst decides that they like to play god and reminds everyone that GE is dog shit  
3. GE tumbles because the run up was too good to be true in the first place

Step 2 happens without warning. Take your profit, you've been warned.

RKT 🚀 thrusters pointed upside down
For the idiots asking why DDOG is going down with a beat:

They gave shit guidance last quarter... compared to Q1 and Q2 their revenue growth went from 86% to just 61% this quarter. DDOG is one of the most expensive priced ones out there in terms of P/S ratio and that is because the market is anticipating it keeping its growth rate of +80% if not accelerate it. They are one of the few tech stocks that actually had lower revenue growth during the two quarters, which benefited tech stocks the most.

50 P/S ratio and a 30bn mcap isn’t justified for 160m revenue per wuarter and barely positive net income
This is WSB nut up or die

bc the world said "you cant be a degenerate this year"

so naturally, next yr everyone's going to be extra degenerate
Calm before the storm. Getting caught up with the tech sell-off. Going to booom after earnings $60 next Friday.
why are you idiots trading RKT ? you’re all fucking idiots
Wait wait I got it, I'll get "The Human Projector" and you'll get "Master Gaslighter" haha. Alright man, it's been interesting, but I gotta get back to work. Next time you're in the bay area drop me a line and I'll buy you a beer.
The the only calls you will be making is to your wife's boyfriend to pick you up in his car.
someone link the rkt call
gonna hold... i think by early next year it should be back up there around $300 if not more...
I'm holding but I got 12/18
expensive course
Holy shit bro. On what?

Wait until end of the month ;)
Usually bullish but in 2020, who TF knows

But that's the best kindd
That d be life saving for my account honestly
If by up you mean down. Correct
Rkt right now looks like my heart rate monitor whenever i leave my phone unlocked next to my wife i leave the room
Lol
I’m doing Nio calls every week for a year
Yeah, all good. Thanks for asking. Made a big losing bet and then chased a couple bad trades. Time to regroup.

Puts - Right to sell at fixed price (Strike Price). You want the actual price to be lower.  Profit = Strike price - Actual Price. 

&#x200B;

Calls - Right to buy at a fixed price (Strike price). You want the actual price higher. Profit = Actual Price - Strike price. 

&#x200B;

They invert each other. Welcome to the lost money club.
Ok
Fucking ugly man.
Rkt calls and Lyft puts  🥴 addicted to gambling but am truly retarded
how?
Hmmmm who is holding RKT calls? I’m not
I WILL NOT ALLOW IT
usually means it's in a consolidation.
I burn mine as intelligently as I can but I'm mad constantly that day trading is restricted this way. Seems like a great way to fuck up small time traders

Whoa
Sad gang
Thanks man, I regret nothing.  
On to the next YOLO
This is the way
If you look the volume was extremely low during that time.  On market watch they are looking at a price target of 6.90.

Looks like we’re having another purge 😔
Specially not promising ones like rkt😂😂
That FAA announcement on BA really ruined my day fml.. was up 50% ended up 2%..
basically he started the beginnings of a debt crisis similar to 2008 except with personal debt instead of mortgages, and he sold all the junk debt backed securities to the CCP banks. Then in this speech he called all the banks "pawn shops" for loans and basically made fun of the biggest govt backed banks (who he had sold shitty debt securities to). Essentially he offloaded a shit ton of liability from ANT's (like paypal/venmo in china) loans onto the chinese government aka the chinese people.  So now the govt has to deal with all that before it potentially explodes in their faces, and they have to teach jack ma a lesson because he essentially sold them bags of dogshit and then bragged about it publicly while laughing in their faces
sooo.. AMD is not realllly Tech....its more like.. mmmm Hardware, yeah like lumber and nuts and bolts...can it be spared?

So far I’m surviving. I have like 5 incomes so I don’t really trip on losing all my options money on a bad play it just removes a income for a few weeks to a month or so.
What’s happening to RKT rn, is a great intro lesson for new crayon eaters out there.
all you idiots buying options on a fucking mortgage company

No1 knows wtf they are doing, and no1 cares really! I just want my money back!

If you didn’t sell RKT when it moonshot the last hour to get out and didn’t get out when it lost all that momentum... idk what to tell you
Long positions, buying shares on dips.
1billion stock buy back and still tanks 🤷🏻‍♂️
GROW A NUT SACK AND BUY THIS BITCH ASS DIP
Keep telling everyone to avoid RKT no one ever listens till they get consistent revenue stream this stock will remain as pos in eyes of Wall Street.
Hold until $47 tomorrow or Thursday. I'm not gonna risk holding on Friday or over the weekend but ER is next Tuesday so I'll probably buy back in after that.
Buy fun tickets and watch money come into your acc and then watch money leave your acc when they expire worthless
Noway. Its all smoke.
I don't mind grinding it out.  I've reduced my cost basis down to $23 or so from $28 selling calls and the premium I picked up when I sold the CSPs to get assigned these shares in the first place so I'm cool.

Its a solid play all around
nah
i actually will never financially recover from this... have to go work now...
Same here bro. Today was just a minor setback. Diamond hands all the way.
hello sir where should I get started with theta gang
Yessir!  Seeing these almost daily lately.  125 mill in debt buyback today is also pretty freaking hot. Kinda expected us to move up more when that dropped but maybe it will see that movement tomorrow.  Super bullish that they can afford to do that, and that they talked about free cash flow financing it (meaning profitability for the first time in awhile).
same
welp AH says we’re fucked 🤷‍♂️
[deleted]
I sold at the bottom today and it recovered extremely well.
What does it mean if a stock sees a huge jump on massive volume and then settles slightly below the peak and then proceeds to trade sideways on low volume?
STOR > RKT
Level 2 on RKT is pretty bad but for now the bid prices are being held up enough to fuck put holders.  If some of these bigger accounts lower their asks maybe we'll get enough.

/ copium.
Got me today too smh
.01 or bust
Wasn't it today?
Good thing too
I knew holding RKT past earnings was risky, so I made sure to buy March expiry options.
last RKT earnings started a 2 month market freefall
Just another way the pdt rule fucks the little guy
Don’t click the link it’s a cock

The state of Twitter.
They seem like a stock you wanna buy and hold. You chose a good one to start with
Thanks bro
Half of the sub will be gone tmr
Premiums depend on expectations of volatility of the underlying, so in a sense yeah.
True, but I was happy with 50% profit selling when I did. Earnings all year have followed this same trend
NIO trading flat AH, love it
RIP to 🚀 boys , I actually hurt for y’all
Fucked terribly overvalued
They start the loan, collect all the fees that aren't interest over the life of the loan, then sell it to someone who will worry about the interest and making mbs from it etc.
lmao it’s a call not a long term investment, i think you’re braindead
Much success!!  High five!!
I will never financially recover from this
Ddog will recover during the call. Guidance has been increased idk why it is dropping
Same 👌
Fucking right lol, apple would have been perfect for it!

I got marked as PDT trying to save my ass out of a bad play lol, glad I took the restriction though
Flip a coin enough times and that sumbitch is gonna come up heads eventually

Yep. It's a shitty situation. Somewhat political. Definitely a problem nonetheless.
Considering the average age of this sub is probably in the 8-10 years range, I'd say kids are definitely watching.

RKT going horizontal. Theta gang wins this one. I knew I should have opened a free spread when it jumped near close. I could have had a profit on my 11/13 and still kept a spread open in case it jumped up.
I bought some KY lube on the way home today.
5 MINUTES FOR THE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It will recover during call imo
TSLA selling off AH.
Hmmm, deloitte ain't shit
So wait is RKT an actual lender or do they just give your deets to actual lenders?

My man, they gonna print, snapped some cheap otm too
Baba fucked me so hard I
Glad I waited, time to buy calls tomorrow morning xd
Dude forget about NIO for right now unless you’ve got weeklies, then take your profit. I’m reading a lot of doubt on NIO, this stock is going to $200-$250 in the next couple years, this comment will age well. Thank god it pulled back a little today I just bought more. 781 shares @ 41.47, holding until 2024. Hummel from Alcatraz 
....OUT!
I hope it's SPY's turn to be spanked tomorrow. And that tech rebounds, even if just a little bit. I'd really like that, yes sir
Official call
Just buy some long dated plays take a break.
Beat earnings, 1B buyback authorized. Earnings call hasn’t started yet.

Expected price fuckery happening right now, but I expect green tomorrow or by end of call

Saw it on IB and they use Benzinga as news provider. Sort of a mini bloomberg, its always faster than the other websites. Really useful for ER.
What'd you guys think about Industry on HBO?

Exactly!
HELD RKT through earnings last time. IV crush killed my calls.Never again
this hurts me but is prolly right.
The VP of investor relations at RKT sounds like one of those lego looking robot dudes on YouTube.
Only a Millennial stock would be based on Communism

You picked AAL of all airlines
Why can baba move nearly 10% so easily? With such a big market cap. Is it just cuz gyna things?

Every dog has his day
This does not seem like a winning strategy
No. Tech stocks killed it under trump. It’s simply that tech is over bought. Also the EU move against amazon much more likely to happen in the Us as well under Biden.

If Amazon goes below 3000 we’re all cucked
What calls we buying to take advantage of this bear trap?
Big flat.
I sold before close and bought 1 more for shits and giggles to see if it sucks again. Like last earnings
Pavlov multiplayer is straight up crack I’ll fight ya bruh
yeah not the vaccine leading to a short squeeze or anything
fuck im so retarded.

this whole time i couldve just waited for massive beats like snap and pins and just jumped on shares after hours on my 3x margin. id be fucking loaded FUCK!
Ban lol
National level candidates and state/local candidates are not identical when it comes to voting patterns. 

Historically a President will win and his party will lose the Congress in mid-terms. 

So just because Georgia went for Biden do not infer that it will go straight dem. Also about $100M is about to be spent in suburban and rural areas to get out votes for the run offs. 

You’re a retard if you are 100% certain what the outcome is going to be GA.
Holy shit thats a hot take, that'd be fuckin nuts bro..
so many people have been talking, but i think its over for us tbh... china coming down hard on them. i have so much in calls, and all that i had in calls yesterday got halved lol. 30k ->15
Ur girl kinda looks like Jack Ma
We know this, the autists have been screaming it all day but with the hit they took on ANT and todays losses one has to think that the bottom is already in.  If tens of billions of dollars in sales in the span of a couple days doesn’t give it a boost then nothing will.  Cough <Softbank> cough.
RIP rocket cal holders
fat chance
Luckily I have shares not calls so I’m not too fucked. I stopped playing earnings with options once I realized you only get fucked... kinda like this
Rkt ain't rocketing.     Shit, I hope it doesn't tank so I can at least get out alive
AAL is a shitty shitty airline, I’d sell and get a different one.
Might be good honestly. This market swings like crazy
RKT goes up, RKT goes down. Can’t explain that
When will you guys realize that good = bad and bad = bad? Come on boys it’s stocks 101.
Baba puts were the move today 👍
The conference call hasn't even played yet haha. It at least can mitigate the sell off.
Like an official earnings call or someone on YouTube
Good call. We definitely ain’t going back to 5 days a week in the office.

I work in tech and some of us are not expecting to go into the office at all anymore. 

At best, we expect to go in 2-3 days a week. There will be companies who offer 100% remote and this will just crush the boomer firms that require asses in seats.

I will only be working for a company that offers 100% remote.
bought and sold $30c to these retards, for profit.
hopefully a big red cock

I hope :)

Still bums me the fuck out...
I can’t enjoy gains for over one day cause I just get fucked by the market the next day 😐
NIO, our lives for you.
Awesome I remember this lol, I remember the what in the boomer comment, I loved it
You told us
It’s today in China and yeah I’m so fucked still with baba smh
Well.. I lose money
I’ve been holding calls for like a month. They haven’t moved from a 30% gain in a few weeks and I sold them today not knowing earnings was ah 🤡
40 minutes now lads... hope you’re all lubed up laying on your prpl mattresses waitin for the numbers
$47 by midday.
Er beat and buyback. Good guidance and we are to the moon
It's been a wild 8 months.
When both bears and bulls lose.
Nio
Yea that seems to be a lot of Tsla fanboy logic. I love tsla and elon, minus their govt subsidies (but they're fighting in an over-regulated mrkt imo, so I give them a pass on taking subsidies to a degree), but you're right there are advancements that nio is just picking up and making happen. Almost obvious their horizon is high being backed and already the most successful right?
Please. The above 3 sentences put more thought into RKT than you did before buying calls.
VR is still trash but another 5 years like you said, hopefully it will live up to expectations finally.

Is it possible the marketing now pricing in a Trump reversal victory and this is why boomer stocks are rocketing. Believe me I want nothing more than him to lose but something fishy is going on here.
Wait what’s going on with rocket
That's perfectly fine. You'll be alright.
Yes
Btw, RKT numbers already out, but the earnings call to go over the numbers is in a few minutes.

Also, DDOG had good earnings. Calls tomorrow?
I guess you can say my calls are ..... rkt
Slowly death, naah need a space x , have calls buddy
Starvation?! Lets call it "surprise diet" to feel better bout it, mkay?!
Ddog beat earnings but down! okay I see how it is
First one really is always free, this was my first option
I guess its a good thing most people in here are focused on RKT or else BABA would tank

everyone is lol
You were supposed to bring balance to the market, not dump it!

The exact quote you just said is what I’m saying is a bad argument. 

“5 years ago i bought in early and it didn’t print!” Is something I constantly hear about. 

5 years of technological progression has happened. 5 years ago VR was trash. Now we have the Valve Index + AAA quality games. Wireless headsets and a $500 or less price tag are coming

Don’t rope please
NIO CALLS PRINTING TOMORROW BABYYYYYY
Fk I’m so annoyed that I lost track of time and didn’t dump my RKT. I bought in for a quick 30% profit play and now I’m gonna hurt
Trick question, you never had money to begin with.
Lmao who else is watching the RKT earnings live stream
How were they? They’re up bigly today.
Unless you put a ban bet I don’t wanna see this
Fake and gay
I don’t think so. I bought DOCU two days before profit announcement. They broke every kind of record imaginable, it tanked after the announcement. I lost around $200 bucks! 🙃
The market makes no sense, imo.
[deleted]
You buy $25 calls?

You buy $25 calls that essentially means it needs to climb 30% to reach that number?

Oof
Beating expectations by 400% and down 8% more than Lyft and Rkt smh
Lmao rkt gonna stay flat
Cousin claims he is a big shot with Deloitte the consulting firm. Anyway he told me to expect a 30% market correction by early next year... do 
what you want with this information. I’m by the dip.
Got some sources?
Baba can go up 10% and I’d still be down 30% damn
This stock damn near gave me a heart attack.
godspeed
Assuming my ddog puts should be safe at this rate
DDOG beat but down AH :(
Fuvk these retards hold till the end !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
upvote if depressed
That’s good to hear
If only their actual gear was good. Got burned hard by corsair recently. 

Some of their switches are manufactured in China instead of Taiwan. They are a gamble and absolute shit quality
didnt lose as much as I thought I would today cause my shit basically already worthless
tmo
BRRR
My understanding is that they were complaining about options having to trade in 5 cent increments under a certain price, which RH does.
Can someone clarify? One source says that Lyft Q3 EPS -$1.46 Misses -$0.91 Estimate. Another is saying that they beat EPS by $.01?
RKT should drop to 17
$ICY
retard
So many damn RKT mentions. Is this what it was like last week with NIO if you weren’t a holder
ER beat & share buyback.
I sold puts. "safe investment"
something something bigger than amazon
Dua lipa
damn thats a pretty masterful avg down imo, i am prolly gonna eat this loss
Are my spy 355p 11/20 fucjed
Nah tech days are over. Tech is worthless these days who even uses Amazon anymore especially once that vaccine hits. We all know AMZN will never be used again once we can go back to the malls and Walmart’s and toys r us
I have 25k loan what to do to make it go up where to put it
Same dawg
My g Halloween was a few days ago get the clown mask off this is the worst TA in a sea of virgin TA cultist. Your crayons are way off
Do you think cvs can finally stop being cursed and break the 5 year downtrend?
Ehhh could be 50/50 today may have been a dead fish bounce . You really can’t justify the tech evaluations with growth haunted by a possible vaccine . The companies have no more pump left with this news ...
Wow it’s actually flat as fuck
better drop some more or we both screw haha
Got fucked. -4% . RIP

Rip to everyone with acb calls yesterday
There was talks of them partnering with FanDuel.

I told you RKT cucks bulls (mostly) and bears would both lose on a bad outlook with high premiums. Should have entered some iron condors or calendars
RKT not dumping AH is all i needed tbh
BABA or bust
Pton calls fasho been holding up like a champ
I sold RKT calls for like a $100 profit on the fourth and am glad I haven’t touched those options since
I’ve been day trading it. Even the small green candles are like 30 cent moves. Stock is basically free money right now.
Because it was good
Shitholes
time to buy
Just wait until Reddit gets bent over when someone makes the argument that censoring certain content makes them a publisher. That's the day this site dies.

Fuck your RKT, DDOG legit down almost 10%

This is bad for cloud
Yes
i’ve been talking about it for hours
Looks like he was going fast
Talk about anticlimactic
RKT BABY LETS GOOOO

What news
Put $18k on AMZN 1/2021 3100 Calls at close. This tech overreaction and lowered IV seemed too good to pass up so just gonna ride that out for the next few weeks
Arkansas’ coach has it as well
Oh yeah baby.
rip to anyone that bought the baba “dip” yesterday
QCOM last week has the same indicators, and I sold when I was up 50% instead of waiting till after earnings. Won’t make the same mistake again
Is there evidence of this as their model? If so that is definitely big
Yea I did, 25 contracts 25c 11/20 at .23 average. Up 8% so far but today looked like a cheap entry. How bout you?
Find in page "NIO"  
1/1 "opiNIOn"

I’ll do it again bch

If the dow could just go red for like a minute or shit like 20 seconds tomorrow that would be great for what's left of my puts
i’m in the livestream boys. 10 min.
Historically the stock has struggled on 11/11. I hope this year is different but it’s usually not a good time for the stock
We as in us
i swear they already released the report
Buy high sell low
It's going to come out flat.
If you wanted to get roasted that’s at r/roastme. We’re just gonna make fun of you for that $395
should b ok
How the fuck do you sleep at night.
Do you understand why is that happening? There's been good earnings releases and after that many stocks had going down. I just don't get the logical reason for that.
I’ll check back in 20 mins...
Stay of execution for LSU

Whew!
What is a ticker for -80 degrees C freezers?
Fine,  RKT give me the billion dollars and you can buy back my shares.
I just sold my 3350C 11/20 for a 10k loss today (-65% or so) so Godspeed
It did drop a bit, but came right back within 5-10 mins. Which is enough time for 100 idiots to yell about the end of the world and how they knew it was gona happen.
People taking profits. COVID cases drastically increasing. Stimulus and vaccine are still many months away from reaching the public.
looks like I'm gonna take his life tomorrow now! PREPARE TO HAVE A FUCKED UP HUMP DAY!
Love to see it
I don't think the call will help much when the numbers aren't great unless they announce something really big which I don't expect!
Imma explode in his ass next
 These ZM weekly calls I just picked up before close are the easiest 2-3 Xer I'll ever have. Big bounce back tomorrow and possibly Thursday. No way this thing closes the week under $400
People are buying them for 790 on StockX. Personally I’d wait. Supply should be back this month for holidays, and market will be flooded, so even if you miss restock, prices should drop to ~600 resale.
100%. It's going to be sports betting streaming... BDubs gunna eat this shit up.

dude ofc revenue is up, but revenue growth is shrinking from quarter to quarter, growth companies are supposed to keep their growth rate if not expand it.

61% doesnt justify a 60 p/s ratio
Damn! Hope you got some inside info
JACK, THERE BETTER BE A HUGE DICK ATTACHED TO THAT WEIRD FACE
I bought a 100 shares because so many ppl talking about them lmao
Just wait
Wait until 4:30 before you count out RKT
Its good to share the spoils friend
Speak for yourself. I sold some calls and I feel great.
I just jumped on the wagon and bought some calls. Hope i dont regerts it
I am doing $24 expiring in a week or two. Figured I would sell anyway if I hits 24.
>Rocket Companies (NYSE:RKT): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.21 beats by $0.12; GAAP EPS of $0.54 misses by $0.59.

>Revenue of $4.74B (+163.3% Y/Y) beats by $190M.

>Announces $1 billion share repurchase authorization.

This is probably the best outcome for theta gang tbh
Alright I'm done watching RKT until I get back from my bike ride.
Yeah, my theory is that they are doing some favors. Former GM guy now running the show at NKLA. Could be a personal favor - i.e. "hey, if you hold off announcing there is no deal, then my options could be worth 100 million. If you announce it now, they could be worth 1 million. Do me a solid here."
Why is no one talking about $BABA ? its down 8% today, and one of their biggest days of the year is tomorrow. Calls cannot got tits up
I’m here, good sir.

I sold at 30 before earnings. Take profits kids
I remember talking to some retard here who had FUBO shares although he couldn’t really explain why he had them. This is the way
Rocket to buy 1b of its 2b shares?? Yum
Have a feeling there’s gonna be some real bad news that drops soon
Last earnings I sold everything at 30. This earnings were only at 21.
Bought RKT puts and RXT calls to play earnings today. gonna be screwed on both i guess. Rip in pepperoni
I’m with you. We just need to make cash the hard way on this one. Still not mad at it but still cucked

Blah blah blah.. tmus has 100bil debt with a fraction of the revenue and assets that "growth" is a trap. T is actively paying off debt unlike all those other debt machines you named. The divy is the play bro its undervalued on top of the 7% . I dont really care I'm just here for the tendies it's not like I'm holding shares. But if I was to hold shares T would be before all that overvalued mess you named

Rkt you better keep go down
SPY 1DTE put credit spreads are a drug. YOLO like $8 OTM and just pray that bitch dont drop. Decent probability to win, but high amount of risk for for such low profits. This is the way.
I love RKT but that stock exists for the sole purpose of inflating Gilbert's Net Worth
Ohh thanks
Oooh... is that good for covered call sellers???
Damn Algos! Just buy RKT and take it to 50.
RKT earnings are out btw
I'll let you know tomorrow.

Did RKT hire Steven Wright to do the earnings call or wat
Yeah fuck that I am young and if they won’t say that you can’t go to places if you don’t get it I won’t get it either 😂😂

Why do you think he posted it here? Retard bait.
Yeah hopefully. I’m just saying the expectations weren’t met when people were saying these things 5 years ago, usually takes longer than people think. That said, plz go to the moon NIO

Too many shares floating , hence they announced the buy back. Let the sell off run and by end of week it will be up

hey retards with rkt options.

rkt literally has to be 25$ + for you to break even or see green on like any weeklies
"OH FUK ME RKT DED I'M DED"

"Our guidance indicates we are going to sell and fund 320 Trillion in loans next month for Christmas"

"OH NEVER MIND WHOOO REEEEEEE"

hope you didn't pay too much for them...

What is this thread even about?  This boring company released boring results and the stock barely moved.
Sounds like the name of a rooftop Korean
Rocket slowly launching???
Honestly this was the way though. Seems like a long term hold.
Direct quote from article, "On the one hand, it’s clear that bears (like myself) got Nio wrong from the get-go. At first glance, the company seemed similar to many “China stocks,”".. guy's a clown bear hahahah don't sweat him
Helped more clients in q3 2020 in 35 years of history. Flat

we green
So I had to take PDT restriction, but I managed to recover this account from a super fat L to actually making gains. Was holding 50x 11/11 SPY 356c at one point
Except condor gang
Hell ya
RKT climbing back what the fuck is happening I don't understand
1999 civic more reliable lol
Sold all my spy puts at close for -50%. It’s official we will drill in am
Tops will dilute when they need to buy a boat and fuck you.
Oh wow, one of Trumps crooked cronies is backing up Trumps baseless claims. They're going to have to drag that crybaby sore loser out. Not even Fox News is supporting this nonsense. How can you think was he is doing is food for America or democracy? Get over it dude, you lost.
Bro I sold puts on it yesterday. I am done.
Yep
They really should just bring the McAloo Tiki over from India. Limousine liberals have wanted an excuse to eat at McDonald's for the past 15 years and they all love americanized "indian" food. Why bother being vegetarian if people aren't going to even ask you what the hell you're eating? McPlant has no mystique, no prestige.
What the hell is gonna happen to Lyft? Are my puts fucked
The trick is to clench your ass cheeks so the water doesn't shoot up your rectum and crush your guts.
Gg
Mm i guess it make sense lol thanks bro
What’s premium rn?
oof, idgaf if its flat in AH because i can do shit with my options until 830 anyways.
When are CRSR earnings
I remember when I went all in on BYND in 2019. I vowed after that day to avoid pump and dumps like a plague.
AMC calls
Like theta gang won
Nice, didn't think about it that way
Looking at the last 3 months its a pretty good support
I love how the chat floods with RKT bears and bulls every time the price goes up and down 50cents. Tug-of-war
I’m trying to be a bull. I don’t like how it feels.
🚀
RKT options with a IV of 217%. The IV crush alone will take out half this sub.
Yes bro. Literally no bad news on the horizon . Just an ER that will probably beat expectations and have good guidance
RIP Doggo 🐶
Because you’re literally throwing away money by giving up extrinsic value... is this a troll comment
All the bitch ass fake investors sold RKT. Now we only go up. 🚀🚀🚀
Keep waiting for DraftKings to drop a little more... Calls on Friday will print.
Y’all are like mango with rocket, calling shit early lol
it’s funny because my entire portfolio is in RKT
cuz its gonna go down more tomorrow, i have calls too man, i think im just gonna lose all my money and then call it quits
Valve index is pretty fuckin mindblowing tbh man, but yes it’s still niche. In 5 years it won’t be. This is my point. Technology progresses.

Theta gang wins this round
Your timeline is a tad bit ambitious... haha
Poor dog. Was going blind anyway.
You’ve been IV crushed my friend
Not just the men, the women and children too
The new CEO of RKT is Mr. Kang G. Roo
Haven’t they only had 1 earnings ?
I bought lots of calls on it. And JD. Betting hard on em
These are not children. These tiny little toddling fellas are dwarfts in their natural habitate you great ignorant supine protoplasmic invertebrate jello.

Btw they're mining for neodymium and adamantium since no cobalt is needed for eluns powercells.
Wait so you're telling me the totally organic and def not being pushed by bots wsb darling (checks notes) ummm mortgage company from 1985 went down??!?!?
I agree with you but your options are expiring soon...
So you’re saying there’s a chance...
RKT earnings call reminds me of elevator music.  This most certainly going to double
[deleted]
She's clawing her way back
After this quarter any mortgage companies with pen and paper on their desks made money.

This shit ain't staying down for long.
RKT announced $1B share repurchases... if that doesn’t make the stock go up then idk
Looks like RKT is trying to rise back up
Opened a debit spread on RKT. Looks like it’ll be the same price as it closed lmao.
Lmfao seriously
God that's just the story of this year. I almost loathe earnings now
At least I'm still breathing
This hits way too close to home 😂 Or exiting positions last week that moved up 20-40% Monday. Hopefully at least someone’s getting rich 😑
lol, did we check the o-ring? rofl
How many times have we seen this? Rotate out of tech to buy stocks that haven't been doing well during the pandemic. Then rotate back to tech because nobody cares about those non-profitable stocks. Apple ex-dividend date is 11/14 and Microsoft is 11/18. They will be back... unless they don't like free money.
I bought RKT 11/13 21.5c. what's it gonna look like tmw
How dare you
RKT do something please
I'm holding calls, kinda moonshots 11/20 20c - didn't throw too much cash at it since I'm pretty unfamiliar with the company overall, hoping for a profit though
It was at -2%. And it will again
BABA gang hang on to your britches the rest of this week, hope you didn’t get shook out today:

https://m.benzinga.com/article/18300447
RIP in peace
You, cuz now you're stuck holding RKT for another 3 months
not rich enough to do a straddle :-(
They’ve “always” beat? As if they’ve had more than two earnings days?
[deleted]
Holy shit the ER looks very good
How much OTM did you sell? The only reason I didn't sell is because RKT it too volatile and could easily go up to the strike price that would give only decent premiums.
Solid DD
rocket frmo the ashes
Oof and they keeping it flat
RKT coming back up baby!!! Let’s go!!!!
Bought in on BUD on some 11/20 $75 calls. Can anyone point out why it appears to be bucking the trend?
Sorry sir we just found out you have coronavirus
TENCENT is also an investor.
Revenue is up 61% YoY...what more do you want

RIP DDOG.
Rocket debuted in August. Thousands of hours of due diligence by investment banks and access to every bit of information valued it at $18/share. Two months later it's trading 22% above that, and y'all are shocked that it's going to drop after earnings? Come on.
Rip rkt
I would assume green cuz the shorts didn’t want to keep on messing around
Well today turned out a decent day.. almost able to day trade again.. fucking a lol, two times the past week I’ve fallen below 😤
RKT has an expected move of $3.
😂
Press release came out already.
New here?
RKT rising from ashes!
You got this!
RKT options SELLERS won today.
Rkt +5% tmrw easy. Y’all don’t know what this earnings call has in store (;
What’s your play fuckboi
RKT gang explodes on launch 2nd time within a year smh
people with actual money, home sales been booming. though doesnt really translate easy, i went in small with RKT for the hell of it
Flat day, tomorrow deep red
Fubo let’s goo
[deleted]
RKT $12 opening tomorrow
important question pertaining to my recovery plays: ive lost it all before and made it all back and then some...i seem to have lost it all again. I still have borrowed money to make pretty big plays, but im down heavy. Last time i made it back by just getting leaps and having lucky plays where i scalped... but i was wondering, on a day where amazon chooses to rip 150+, if i bought 10 fds during the run up (maybe after amazon has already run 40) do you think MM's would stop the run up to shake me out of my fd's? i never hold fds for longer than a few hours tbh. Also, i lost all this money on massive long call positons in ecommerce this past week...
But, besides everything else, there is no reason to freak out with the situation. 41.87 after such s drop it's not bad at all. Next earnings seems to be great so let's take it easy! This just only going up!
Why are yall saying RKT is tanking?? Lmao it's literally positive
been consistenly buying the top and selling the bottom on AMD
Yeah! whose gonna refinance their mortgages to lower rates during a recession!
DDOG beat earnings and guidance raised, still down
[deleted]
RKT gonna have a P/E of 1 at this rate
They gotta fuel the 🚀 before launch dummies, do you even watch Elon's rockets take off
Well I’m broke I’m just going to go ahead and give you guys my pay pal info
Are you talking about the people who aren't losing money on AMZN?
Saved some money right there. Nice.
RKT is the biggest shitstain in my portfolio. And if you know anything about my pants on my head retarded portfolio, that’s quite an achievement.
Doubt
Nah didn’t fall for it again just still bag holding since last ER

Sold a couple 10Cs 1/15/21 that I got in august and picked up 12Cs 4/16/21 for earnings.
Lol everyone and their mother. The appraisal firm I work for is having their highest revenue year ever and its almost all refi's.
where are Congolese parents?
rocket more like uh 1999 honda civic lol
Rkt flat. Both sides fuk
Rise again rkt
Fubo puts at open?
Hold
why dont you all wait until the call to decide if you want to off yourselves or not. They could give out very good guidance and this ish moons. If they dont, then you can be depressed. Or, be like me and have calls and puts. Then all you have to worry about is a flat day.
Apple really went flat to fuk everyones options 🤡🤡🤡
The cycle continues.
And now it's flat...can't win.
What do you mean "WE"?
$RKT algos finishing warming up
Yeah this crossed my mind but there’s a vaccine looming, but then how fast can they produce and get it out, will there be a scare and dip again before we head up again? It’s pretty tricky
Billion dollar stock buyback was not priced in plus an earnings beat. Weird market.
Why isn't baba going up right now. Kind of scared
AR/VR has been pretty disappointing so far
u/Wakka54 still appears active

Will he comment? Today was a rollercoaster but far from the worst 

I didn’t see a post saying he sold but could have missed it
I bought shares [facepalm]. But hey, at least they are up >40%. Congrats to anyone who bought calls!
Yeah seems like a solid strat. I just picked up a leap and will prob sell some far out calls too.
Best NIO move, go back three months ago and buy leaps
Feel good about RKT shares. My only regret is selling 25C instead of 23C.
Totally. I’ve got 11/20 and 11/27. So hard to tell where the damn floor is
Or maybe not. These low volume shitz
Well well well
How many did you sell and what strike/expiry?
earnings? so not out yet?
Ever spent a whole day losing and gaining massive amounts of money scalping the SPY zoomed in on  the 1 minute chart, and at the end of it all, you look and you're up like $13 and the chart was just flat?

That's enough market for me for a bit
40k on fubo paying off like gangbusters. Getting out tomorrow.
I’m supposed to trust a guy who can’t even link a website properly? NIO 80 EOM
Thanks, I'm pretty bad at using Reddit.

Dude, someone was shilling the fuck out of FUBO yesterday... (up 25% AH)

Should’ve listened 😞
[deleted]
>I'm a McPlant my dick in your ass

Doesn't sound so retarded to me.
What the fuck are you doing? Pick a side
The responsible thing to do is buy mutual funds in a Roth. It's boring as shit, but if you lost money doing that in the last four years you're a fucking idiot. 

But watching your VIGAX go up .07% a day isn't quite the same dopamine rush.
DDOG with shrinking revenue growth from 87.7% to 84% to 68% to 61% now... and that during a pandemic, rest in peace 30bn valuation
hello friends, say hello to IV crush
of course.
RKT could cure cancer and AIDS and the shitty stock will plummet 8%
Who loaded zm and ptob calls at close?
Maybe I just start selling options instead
Wrong sub retard
[deleted]
RKT/RXT... doesn't matter boys! We all going down!
If you hold 50c weeklies, then yeah you might be.
Ya who would of thought a stock with 200% iv was going to tank. Even if it went up a little all you fuckers still losing money haha
Make it a pay per view or just have commercial breaks 🤔
Sounds about right, Lambo or breadline baby
Gonna need $15 or $27 RKT, this flat shit isn't helping anyone
The good thing about buying calls and immediately losing 60% on them is that tomorrow, my account will show a net daily loss of a smaller amount than what I stared at all day today!
but its backed by chinese gov (which btw tesla pretty much is too) so no crater to hell like it deserves. plus its a meme stock with gross volume for whatever reason
bro $rope tmr for you
$395? BAN THIS RETARD!😂
That's very interesting, care to elaborate? Like people looking to buy more vs people already bought and wishing for it to go up? I'm seeing a lot of people still looking to buy more NIO, what are you thoughts on it
Welp, at least i still have my health.
Same
I collected $2k on the calls I sold on RKT damn feels good, might buy a new MacBook
The only ones winning are those who sold RKT calls
So basically everyone lost in rkt
Thats the way she goes RKT...
Earnings call at 5 pm . still got 45 mins
low rkt vol. its okay... :( next time lol
Etsy has a lot of potential long term, I think we are safe if we are patient
This is the way
They we're the first to do it last time too. PUTTTTS
Imo. Everyone blew their load. Its gonna be like Feb before the vaccine comes. Imo, how ppl will get the vaccine. Im 33 I won't. Also, im medical most ppl might not know the vaccine might be a two shot series and nobody knows how long it will be effected in the long term. Might have to keep getting shots.
Always sell before earnings 😎

He said, holding into earnings.
Nah dog food isn't for you
Well when most people make 50% in a day they take profits. I know that is foreign to many people here but I have a feeling that was part of the reason why it slowly trended lower.  We aren’t out of the woods yet either.
[removed]
Fubo winner today. Rkt fgts lose
Lol my friend yoloed into some lyft calls 😂😂😂
but i have puts
It would appear you are in trouble
Bye DDOG
whats your pt
Rkt earnings call isn't for another 15 min... so this is just people moving money around. Chill the fuck out.
I’m sorry RKT gang. I tried to warn you at the close there https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jrsf0h/_/gbv7mby/?context=1
Buy after earnings this always the play for RKT
I tried to warn RKT gang 😔
I think we all knew, deep down, that RKT was going to cuck us.
Rip
Wow, my FUBO sell order filled at 3:58 today. Cool cool. Forgot I even put that in.
I need like 6-7% on my RKT puts.  I'm fucked.  God damnit.
Loss
Serious question, earnings call is Nov. 12 but they haven’t turned a profit yet and are always in the negative. Is our stock gonna tank? Can we still afford the box?
Advice on strikes and how far out exp to sell? Bought at 25 and probably haven't broken even yet
this whole thing is FYI
Penny stocks and FDs for the win

Michael Vick found DDOG
data wonk here - hospital capacity isn't a good measuring mark as most hospital rooms don't have the capacity to care for acute COVID patients, the number to track is ICU beds.

Some hospitals have converted wings/areas in addition to ICU to be suitable for Covid patients, but the number to generally follow is ICU capacity.

lol
>CNN retracted their call

>No they didn't

>Yes they did you "helpless boob"

>Here's proof that they didn't

>You are smooth-brained idiot

I applaud your stupidity.
Fuck I didn’t know fubo had earnings today.
No

I guess I'll be holding RKT shares for a few more months and selling calls again.

Oh well.  

**ItS A lOnG TeRm iNvEsTmEnT**
I'll be shocked if NIO isn't 50 eow. Next week though there is going to be a huge dump after earnings.
Bought my puts right before close 😎
[deleted]
RKT know it had to do it to 'em
Literally everyone. Interest rates are like 2%
Everyone’s so caught up in other matters they’re forgetting about covid
You fell for RKT again!!?!? After what they did to you?
Did RKT not do well? I thought I heard a few REEEEEEEEEs off in the distance.
need a $1-2 move. 2% will eff your premium with IV
Probably would shock the dude back to life.
\-50%
[deleted]
I should consider not investing in the companies by having a nice name! I guess see ya next year for RKT earnings!
[deleted]
So you lost a whole $3?
RKT called, he said all call holders bend over
[deleted]
Bro we lost
So you think there gonna pump this more?
U ded too
Rocket’s down 1% you retards
Someone loop me in to my balls deep RKT position? Am i eating tonight or nah?

RKT RXT both doing the same thing ha
Ddog gettin raw dogged
I guess I’ll buy rkt shares lol 😂 at everyone buying calls
Rkt plays: bought call at 3:15, sold at 3:45 for $12 gain. Bought a $10 17p . About to lose all value overnight. Let's go. Guaranteed 1 dollar profit 😎
Also DDOG will tank
Found the smart guy
big names are looking a little oversold but QQQ is still holding up... needs to dip a little more i'd say
Yo I know this is a trash site but this is the bullshit I’m talking about 

[The idea that Nio can continue going from zero mph to 60 mph and accomplish in a few years what it took Tesla about a decade to pull off seems a bit far-fetched.](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/nio-stock-floor-gas-hit-brakes-it-depends/)

As if that decade didn’t still happen. *The EV industry still had 10 years of progression.* 

It’s like these people don’t fucking account at all for the actual development of technology. Same thing with fucking idiots doubting A.I. or AR/VR. 

It’s a fucking joke. I don’t understand the absolute lack of thinking.
Mooning straight to the core
My bank calls printed tomorrow
It could be much worse... let's wait for guidance.
Lmao put holders y’all better not celebrate either...welcome to the world of IV crush bros!
This is one heck of a wild swinging dick!!
RKT motherfucker, do you own it?
RKT is gonna fucking moon idk what these retards be talking about, Indicators looking bullish
Use white text though.
Rkt puts aren't going to pay.

😂😂😂😂 yeah I get that actually just don’t tell her your user name😂😂
Thanks for coming out, RKT holders
4:30
Those who are waiting for RKT to boom after beating estimates surely were not here during past earnings. They always beat and the stock tank. Hard luck bois.
We’re looking very strongly at my portfolio; it’s gonna be the best portfolio.
Big difference in people wishing to buy and people wishing for it to go up.
Glad I went for the safe play and just sold a bunch of 17.50 rocket puts.
Did i say hold RKT calls? I meant RXT 😅
And today's winner is.... *drum rolls* DDOG

RKT flat... IV/Theta Crush at least no delta crush lol

It's going to just wait a couple minutes
Big tease
This aged well
glad to hear she's doing better man. worth more than any amount of money in the world.
Stage 1: denial
RKT gang was hoodwinked, bamboozled, lead astray, run amuck, and flat out deceived!!!
Same bullshit as last earnings
Oh no RKT what happened?
Imagine telling your friends that you blew your account out on a mortgage company LOOOOL

Only the tip ;)
No shit it's in Georgia and the Dems will win both seats.
i expected nothing from RKT and thats what we got.

fucking 200% IV and its flat like my flaccid dick
Fucking bloody guys
Hey, I talk with dogs, too! A golden retriever manages my portfolio.
pretty good on my put so far. we will see in the morning
You spoke too soon
Massive debt. Huge dividends (the only reason conservative investors still hold this crap). DirectTV is a failure. HBO is bleeding subs and lost the online battle to Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Turner Media's only profitable asset is CNN. Wireless? T-Mobile and Verizon both have much higher growth. AT&T is in the process of selling out all their assets and it doesn't look good.
I’m sorry to all the fucking retards on this thread.
States are starting to add restrictions again.
I never go to the river walk and Austin has probably 5-10x more homeless people that I see.
I only had 80 shares of fubo at $11 10 days ago no biggie
Cool man thanks for the tip if they would announce something it would be big for all the stupid rotation that’s going on
Still up 75% from election day...
Fuck XLE, all my homies hate XLE - iwm is next.
sir, i need you to look again
My RKT puts are actually gonna print? Sorry guys, I tried to make it go up for you.
I hope MM’s don’t shake the tree with NIO again had me nervous for a little
It's just people pulling out because they are scared. Earnings reports havent really even reported yet. Just people being annoying and abusing after hours trading.
F that's why I stopped holding through ERs lol
What do you think AMC will do tomorrow? say moon or ban
F in chat for whoever bought my rocket calls
I only lost 6% of my NV today, and I loaded my portfolio with bargain tech stocks and calls (BABA, SQ, JD, et. al.). And some SPY puts. I think that means I did well.
Fuck me I forgot I put an order in today to sell my calls holy fuck and it filled at 3:58. Fucking idiot
fuck my RKT calls
DG May 2021 $220 calls
Rkt buying back $1b?
Respect
Nice yoyo simulator
Bought yesterday at about noon and somehow only lost like 5% of the premium before close, position was -75% at open today. Averaged down as soon as RH would let me, then a couple more times throughout the day at low points. At close today my contracts were at $0.62 with an average cost of $0.74.

How low can she go?
The pain is immeasurable
RKT coming back up as we speak, shit is giving me heart attacks
rkt living in Spain without the S
It is due to antitrust regulation from CCP. The difference is that there isn’t a system over there where BABA can get the kind of dragged out antirtrust legal battle that our tech companies have had. Whatever happens will be swift and one-sided. Thay said I’m bullish and holding 100-200 shares back up to $320 and selling far OTM calls as I have for about a year on BABA.
Whoever told me to buy FUBO shares. Thank you

Just turn your phone upside down for RKT
Yo this real life?
I'm playing RXT as well, looks like they beat earnings/revenue and guidance was better than expected - fingers crossed for the moon tomorrow!

They’re repurchasing $1b worth of shares

1) that lowers share dilution
2) shows they’re healthy and have plenty of capital
3) shows they believe their price is undervalued
RKT $16 by open
They just shaking out the retarded, 🚀 will 🚀
Wow I really just got caught in another WSB extinction event
Hope it reverses for y’all, ex-team rkt who got wrecked last time
As for Lyft gang I’d say you’re Uber fucked

A lot of people just dumped their RKT bags at $22 and going to miss out on the moon mission

Hot take. Definitely in the minority there. Is the only reason homeless people? SA has those too. I just cant see how SA is better. The river walk is neat but the river is gross. The traffic is just as bad and Austin is way more fun IMO

Only reason I bought so little was because that was all the change left in my account at the time, and I told myself I was just gonna watch the price and wait for the right time to buy. 

Well, ever since then the price has only gone up haha

Glad to hear she's doing better man! Makes this casino seem a lot less important.
RKT tanks after massive earnings beat. CLASSIC
Bought 2/3 of a tesla stock call me waren booffet
What are RKT boys celebrating?

ddog ripping
Lmao I can’t believe anyone would play that. I bought 500 shares and sold it at the pop to 22.50
Waiting for ACB to dip back to $4 so I can buy and hold. God just imagine the tendies that would print if it hit its 2018 and 2019 highs.
:) Calendar spread and did a CSP :) heheheh
Respect. A man of your word but I wasn't even close
And RKT fucked everyone
Will go to the moon tomorrow through the end of the week. They have their big “Black Friday” or “singles day” as they have dubbed it ripping tomorrow. As data pours in that they sold billions we will see some nice spikes. Fear not my friend
If u played rkt with options and not shares I really don’t know what to tell ya
RKT being naughty
is this real?
Glad she’s okay man
[deleted]
Lyft missed EPS - why won't it go down more?
RKT U PIECE OF SHIT
RKT NEVER DISSAPOINTS... oh wait that’s all it does rip for the holders who thought this time would be different lol
Uh oh, you weekly RKT calls are gonna need a bigger pump than that
RKT going flat to fuck both sides over...Theta Gang Gang
Same for San Diego. We fucked but at least I’m teaching online again
How is Rkt fluctuating so fucking much AH? Feel like someone's deliberately keeping it down
They have like a data sheet. X numbers if cases per ppl= lockdown. Not total lockdown. But no gyms, dining in etc.
You mean where we blow up on the way to the moon?
They wanted his head on a silver plate, they wanted him to leave; but leave he did not.

RKT with some good numbers?

You know what that means...😏
[deleted]
My bad I said that because its after hours so we can trade it tomorrow
RKT barely beat - it’s going to tank :( this market requires 50%+ beats
AAA is offering a free rental day with Hertz if I rent at least 4 days. What if they go bankrupt before my rental is up? I'm keeping the car.
Here's what you are forgetting: GE makes products that people buy. Physical products, and lots of them. Once investors realize that they have been duped into buying stock of a company that has revenue (and even profit sometimes) from a broad range of sectors, they will realize their mistake and sell off... fast.
Rip RKT gang. Looks like my 30c wont print
Glad to hear it man, best wishes for her health

Looked into rkt calls then realized it would need to jump an insane amount lmao have fun with IV crush. up a whole $.5 after hours
Glad she’s doing better
RKT beat earnings by 15%, I am afraid this is not going to send us into space :(
Funny thing is I did the same thing with TWTR and made bank.

Wtf am I seriously looking at a $61 loss. Shit like
This deserves insta ban
also, the whole market IS NOT red today. Dow is up 250 points. It's mostly tech that's down and some stocks that went up too high yesterday. I think everything else will go up tomorrow or in the coming days but tech will eirher stay flat or go lowr.
RKT is having seizure
[deleted]
Rkt crew about to file bankruptcy
I can barely sleep with these losses.

Cuz you autistic

This week my portfolio was up over 100%. Last night my mom got rushed to the hospital with covid+pneumonia. Blacked out. Wasn't looking good. I would have gladly given all my money to see her get through it. Today the doctors got her stable. Gave her the same shit they gave trump. And she seems much better as well as higher oxygen levels. I lost 1k today from oversleeping but this is the best I've felt losing money ever. Life's looking better.
Lmaooooooolo RKT crashing
Good news DKNG and U holders, I took the loss today so it will moon tomorrow
Aderrall aside, has anyone found a good technique (book I could read?) about distraction and focus, working on improving career, personal relationships, routine tasks, many different projects... getting organized and developing a routine, and not just staring at my phone all day? Please welcome me to your TED talk.
Save a tree, wank in a sock.
as long as expiry is more than 2 weeks, should be okay
Noobs
RKT is so trash - this shit never holds its gains.
i was gonna sell rkt calls today and then i forgot thank god im retarded
Nope she'll be marked as a pattern day trader if she sells now lmfao

Oh good. So boys, who knows when NKLA is actually shitting the bed? The mountain of cheeeeeap Dec 18 $7.5P I bought are hoping before years end...
rkt needs a 10% move to not get IV crushed? @ 200%?
boomers gonna read the headlines and pump it for a day or two then itl die down, ride the wave

alexa - play "everyone has AIDS" from the musical "lease"
I'm so happy to have a full time job for the first time in years wsb. I had to hold a cat down while he had his balls chopped off today, but it's refreshing to not depend on my apparently terrible gambling instincts to increase my net worth.
Omg rkt!!! 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
this is big.
It’s different this time, no run up to 30+.  Just sideways for last two months
Loan 🦈 you speaking my language.
Great dd homie
Lmao seems legit
Bought RKT at 28 I broke even by selling covered calls. I told you guys it’s POS stock but people still keep buying calls
4:30 est
Yea that was a pretty bearish close. Eventually we'll weed out all of them tho. Good thing I got leaps. My covered calls I sold are probably toast tho.
From one gay ber to another... I hope you've got some $ROPE
Watching the 1min candles on Webull is stressful
Now you guys gotta pray guidance is good lol
🚀 best eps by 13% baby!
ACB down over 20% did weed get cancelled
HOLY F RKT. MASSIVE BEAT AND 1B buyback. 🚀🚀🚀🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🚀🇺🇸
And it begins

Did what it went from 21 to 22 and back to 21 lol
my portfolio sure hopes so. didn't even have time to react yesterday
RIP QQQ and ARKK =/
I sold the peak before earnings. Think that was the play.
Yes
If RKT doesn't move 10%+, your options are fuk. It had 220% IV
Rkt is not a shitbag meme stock no matter how much you try to make it one. They have solid financials. It’s a fucking hold stock. Stop trying to make short term gains!

23.5C 12/11 exp
Salty bitch
You poor RKT dudes gonna get IV crushed
soo did RKT beat earnings or what??
no I'm a bull lmao. I have tech stocks though
Enjoy those IV crushed bags tomorrow
i think it's because its wayy overvalued. It joins the list of over hyped stocks during covid like twillio, wayfair, okta, docu, ddog, fsly, zm,etc they go up big when tech is hyped go down big when future looks less strong for texh. Maybe nvidia is not as much overvalued as these other guys but if i were an investor, i wouldnt be buying nvidia at over 500 dollars per share.
Source i fucking live here. The world is locking back down.
Lol let’s see if it makes that 10% move that is needed.
RKT market orders not even filling
[deleted]
Now we held, now what
The WSB challenger could be happening
RKT EPS $1.21 vs 1.07 exp, $4.63B sales vs 4.55B expected
when is RKT earnings?
both
Just some gay shares. No news for dip, appears to be technical in nature.
Transferred plates from the Lambo after doubling down in April.
My feels since last Tuesday.  FINALLY turned it around today though.  Keep your head up bud!
🎉rkt
All these treatments and therapeutics for COvid-19 and we already over 1K deaths today. Shit we might hit 2K at this rate with 200k cases. It’s almost as if the danger of having hospitalizations at max means something. 

Anyway, SPY 360 11/13.
what’s your positions? You a damn determined retarded.
Fuck your analysis bro! My leaps
Wow is RKT really 🚀 ing?

Omg I’m erect
You guys are going to get iv crushed to hell
Holy crap. $30?!!
75% of the sub does weeklies, typically my monthlies print safely so I try to stick with those. Bi-weekly sometimes ok imo, weeklies are for lotto tickets.
Very fake and very gay
I have a feeling RKT hits $23/24 yet opens at $22 tomorrow and tanks to 19 during day
Not probably. Looks like lsu did
WOoooooOooooOoo
RKT gang 🤡
I've got Jan 15c and 19c.  If it looks like the squeeze won't happen before Christmas, I'm rolling them to April.

&#x200B;

I just saw that they're doing an early redemption on 63% of their 2021 notes.  This makes me feel better about the potential of their balance sheet and their Q3 earnings report next month.
Nah, there like 4 months till vaccine is out.
[deleted]
RKT $1B BUY BACK
Well that's a different topic. If you'd like to discuss reasonable reductions to the money supply, and can provide numbers, that might be a conversation to have. Advocating salt as money is probably not worth doing, however.

I bought 350p expiring tomorrow at peak today and kept averaging down.

I'm down 10.6k with another 17.1k worth of puts expiring tomorrow. Thoughts and prayers?
Lots of signs pointing toward more red. Which is why stonks will moon tomorrow. Rational thought never makes money 📈

What the fuck are you smoking ? It literally landed on April lows, i have never seen a stock do that, i know some industries landed on May lows, but what the heck.

And its literally been trending down past 13 fucking years.
whats happening to RKT
I'm still holding my CCL and RCL. Almost sold yesterday but realized we still have well over a year
First, I was not asking you

Second, fuck off
DDOG earnings today right? Hoping for a solid showing

It really all started with the fuckin stock split. The market's been shit ever since
Daily
Can I make my own portfolio a small hedge fund? I don’t trust anyone else to manage it for me.
Imagine how my 11/20s are lookin
Fuken RKT. I got in a few weeks ago at 21 hoping for it to reach 30 by now. Just gonna sell and get my money back from this pos
guh! rkt keeps jumping back an fforth!
what happened
Yup, they are getting into auto loans. They don't hire agents so they don't pay any commissions. Everything is done through their website/app
$SHOP moon pls
is your dad okay? hope his legs get better 🇹🇷
Nice
I'm a retard don't ask me
Kinda a flat day for me overall. Only lost $150.
The last two days have had the dumbest narratives
It has in the first earnings run up😂😂 but I don’t know why people held them and I still don’t get why they are holding now😂😂😂🤡
November 10th 2020.
i think there's not a real time, just supposed to drop before the 4:30 presentation
No they make rockets. Its in the name dumb ass
Well I think I'll be fine eventually. Feb 21 expiration. Still stings to lose so much.
Late Nov if you’re fast enough with restocks

Rn if you’re willing to pay a premium from reseller
no they steal pokemon or something

dognapping
Nope.
biggggg time
RXT, shit.
All mango had to do was legalize cannabis
Watch RKT pump and dump AH. There's so many bagholders that probably want out
bearlife
I was told by people Covid was a media disease and wouldn’t matter after the election... what else have I been lied to about?
Keep forgetting the daily auto thread doesn't observe daylight savings. Talking to myself on the other thread.
I’ve seen this a couple times, why do you think this will print?
Every GameStop is sold out of series X’s and I’m not gonna lie I get more of a “we barely stocked any” vibe than a “we sold a massive amount of units” vibe
ACB 11/20 8P
Are you their grandpa?
When you guys trade options you buy weekly or biweekly?
They are leaking out the bottom. Buy more to fill it back up.

Eek
Doesn’t matter since revinue never equals big money
Lost 1.38% today. Such a lame feeling when you don't win or lose big
* LYFT
* PRPL
* RXT
* RKT
now
other plays - 2 for 1 BJ’s behind wendy’s.
If I saw the steady up trend it had a day or two after I sold I would’ve held on to it
Reminds me of Extraction
Down 8k thanks to selling Tech puts yesterday EOD.

Not worried too much tbh.. I'll live to see another day
anyone have the GME new short data ?
4:30 PM est
Hahha well neither do I to be honest, I’m pretty retarded
10 bagger would be nice
Holding
RKT earnings call holders will meet the same fate as PRPL earnings call holders in July
Wonder if the RKT dump 10 mins before end was insiders
What did u play?
I think SPY has one more pump in the AM and then it’s down to 340
359, 354, 348
Somehow both legs of my baba call spread are red, that’s just how it be this week
You retards think it’s still March
I said😾 DIAMOND HANDS😼💎👍🏽✋
Not at all
Rotation into boomer stocks.
My link for RKT earnings isn't working

Good or bad?
wow was tracking AMD  missed that CRSR pump at the end. carzy.. All in with my 6 shares!
I bought one share just to feel included
Come over to the rkt support thread incase you die with us
Is BABA gonna recover this month or what? These 12/4 calls are lookin grim :/
The problem is both moves are stupid.
I am, but you've changed my mind because you're so dense as to be completely irrational. Money printer go brrrrr, make the US Zimbabwe!
Our fate is sealed
welcome 🚀
When does RKT report?
Are coups bullish? Pompeo saying smooth transition to 2nd term for 🥭
Alright, do you have call or put on RKT?
Anyone have RKT earnings?!
RKT is fucked right?
I hope so. The regulation thing hit all the China stocks today. I am down now on some March $330's, but bought more and some shares today.

I'm in the same situation with Palo Alto. Bought way to high at $265 and have been bagholding ever since.
Seriously, someone should monetize live earnings calls with active betting instead of holding stock or options.
[deleted]
Nerds, realistically when can I get a ps5? I need to do something more productive than trading
RKT is funding my next option play
Bag holding at 26-_-
Probably not
It’s bullish and he wanted you to sell to him
Godspeed brothur
It’s a breath of fresh air from the normal BUY TECH BUY ANY TECH PRICE DOESNT MATTER shit they were doing for the last 3 months
Lazy ass MMs did nothing all day
Rkt boys, we either heading straight for uranus... or we crashing into the bermuda
So what have we learned?
pls update us the results
Fake news
My bad, what I meant is that is has never closed below IPO price
More like a loan company
They never learn
Ye
N
Scalped TSLA puts at open from 415 to 398.  3 bagger.  Had some fun today.
My account after all the fuckery today is blood flat. -$200 wtf. Makes you wonder why I even opened up the app in the first place. I could’ve spent that time making an OnlyFans and having you gaybois subscribe.
Anybody else having Sleep for dinner?
Has lyft reported yet wtf
🙋‍♂️ Follow the trends, don’t fight it
Exp?
# Wait a minute.... RKT is a mortgage company? :o :o :o :o :o :o)
Is SPY gonna move tomorrow?
[deleted]
Enron was an amazing story though
Now the market is closed...what are we supposed to do with our lives ehn???
Fuck all this RKT bullcrap. CRSR gang WHERE YOU AT?  I'm up bigly on 30c 11/20.
Alright there you go you got your 2 days of rotation now back to TECH TECH TECH don't forget who got us here
Monkey see monkey do.

Bought in RKT 25c before close.
Sir, this is a casino
And I’m betting the exact opposite, rip to one of us
rkt earnings call is at 1:30pt/4:30et
I hope to good
when you say that are you asking if I think that people are mistaken that the console release will make gme moon? if so, yes. Earnings MIGHT do it, but unlikely. Gamestop is just not a store people use anymore. My little cousins are prime video game age and they have legit never been into a gamestop in their lives, and their friends havent either last time I asked.
> I ended up averaging down my 11/20 calls..

same, like, a lot. I now have 75 contracts between my Robinhood and Roth, avg $0.66 per contract, not great but significantly better than $1.50

>  this drop seems way too controlled and managed.

Glad I'm not alone in thinking this. I thought the bounce off $18.50 at 10:30am was sustained and very bullish.

> Would love to see an EOD/AH pump to 20 to confirm suspicions though

Same, heading to AH now. EoD held ok with increased volume. Good luck friend!
Record sales probably shit rallies I am not so sure lol
was that closing trade closing the shorts or someone really bullish?
Circuit breaker tomorow.
That’s why it’s going to tank
Down a casual 44k in 2 days
I just want to make enough to make my wife not hate me. Why does god do this
Numbers aren’t out yet retard
ACB 11/13 9C
Me too. I can’t breathe
And as far as I’m aware it hasn’t printed at all for anyone since it’s IPO lmao
Ehhhh, I’ll get fired. The thought did cross my mind though.
Glad the paper hands are out of RKT
RKT did a nice parabola last 30 minutes to trap all the bulls.
Same
RKT vs NIO
This right here is bear music to my ears.
I think at 430
I unloaded most of my calls at the spike there. Holding my December’s still. If you got short term exp I’d sell in the am
Smart play
I'm at 5k shares at an average of $24 right now...very good day for me. Get back on this rocketship!
You good bro?
Will RKT be ReKT or will it RocKeT? Tune in to the next ER episode.
If today's low is how far down SPY is pulling back, that's a pretty bullish sign... which is exactly what MMs want you to think.
Bought in at 27, sold covered calls for $4 feeling like a genius. Hoping this moons so I feel less like an idiot.
literally this
[deleted]
Got AAPL and TSLA on sale this morning
:(
Can one of you smooth brains explain volume on nio but sideways all fucking day
KaliKhajits- The Human Projectors 📽 first comment. “The hunting subreddits welcome you, friend. Everyone wants organic gmo free no antibiotics lgbtq nonbinary meat, but noone wants to go get it!”

Do you want to talk about your short term memory loss and projection?
Houston... we have a problem
11/20 Tesla calls are down 89%.

So you’re saying there’s a chance 😎
Have you seen the long term graphs of NOK? It’s only gone downhill since the dot com/ telecoms boom.
HYLN>NIO. Downvote me
Shit I meant to dump my RKT calls but got busy at work and lost track of time. Guess I’m along for the ride now 😅
youre like the GTA player who jumps from the car as you watch your friends crash into the gas pumps
Yep tonight it will be covid cases and lockdowns. Cali locking back down.
ive got 51 calls and their almost worthless right now.  imo theres no point in selling them as ive got nothing to lose. now, i dont know how much are worth the 48 calls, but my point is if there is not much to recover from your calls, like mine, its probably better to hold on
Sold RKT calls...hope that wasn’t a retarded move
pajama gang time
All my portfolio in RKT calls let’s take this one home
that’s what it’s all about
it was red the first day of trading. It went to 17.5
It should die, but it won’t
[deleted]
[deleted]
Hoping on record sales and this shit rallies
That’ll give you plenty of warm buttholes.
Fly too close to the sun...and you might just get burned

*Fucking dies*
Can’t wait for all tech to moon tomorrow and be a millionaire (or it all be down 5% be broke and eat boxes of pasta the next month)
Long tqqq?
Just dropped down like a rag doll

Ouch
Why doesn APHA, the largest of the weedstocks, not simply eat the other ones?
when someone posted here a little while ago "selling RKT covered call is free money" .....I bought calls. And they shot up lol. Thanks loser
I used it as an opportunity to get out at 35% loss. If it moons tomorrow I’ll be kicking myself but there’s always other trades
Hope you bought puts.  So cheap at EOD
The clown is playing with BYND, they had a free shot at plant based burger making "tests" and collaborating with BYND but now :  
"Well it's working and we know the product, so we can develop it on our own. Thanks Bynd for letting us test it and fuck off !"
i got puts and calls on RKT. so, sorry but its staying flat.
how have mods still not fixed the timing of this thread
Remember that with last RKT earnings call, the earnings had been released long before the call itself.  We already knew the numbers before the call time.  This is different as new numbers nwill be revealed.  Doesn't mean it won't tank but you can't compare this to the last time.
In a good way 💦💦
probably all got the rona
I think they call them bunkers haha.
Half the sub is in rkt lol
Too bad bad markets are closed tomorrow.
NIO better fucking moon tomorrow or im fucked
Would you have held it to current day? Or sold at $200? hmmmm
House votes on legalizing cannabis. Time to call.
Good luck to us all ...
RKT Flat :( ? we all wrong lol
RKT MAKE ME TENDIES OR IM SERVIN THEM AT WENDYS
thanks
My penis feels like it was used like a tether ball
you were saying??
RKT Gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
buy every dip, lisa is taking us to $200 by 2024
Every AAPL event fucks up the rest of the market. I’ve noticed a pattern of fuckery.
That was a good dip to buy today for sure.  I sold a week ago around $23.50.
At least it wasn’t a boring day
“BZ: Market On Close Imbalance: $1.3B To Buy Side” its 🌈🐻 hunting season tomorrow
It wont settle in time. Better get a quick yolo tomorrow to make it up and go cash gang until close
Yes the homeless and Austin definitely isn’t a fine city lol I have a house in Sa and Austin and sa is way better.
both red today  tho
RKT is such a POS.
Makes sense,right? That's what is scary, the way things have been going.
I do.  Best broker ever

Imagine blaming your trading ineptitude on boomers
Welcome to all the new NIO calls including myself. I’ve got calls, assignments, and my reddit account riding on NIO making bull moves
FML...didn't realise I had already bought same calls earlier in the day :(
The ER was strong and they have clear vision so I hope the uptrend continues. I’ve been holding these calls since last week, they got up to 100% gain and I never sold sadly
Like bulls r fuk
play the recovery, or it will be very hard to make back
lol damn rkt flat?
Today it seems like CNBC guests are really feeding us this re-opening trade heading into a winter of mass death...  like... please "hold these bags" for me
Hope all those boomers are out of tech stocks to sell now. Jesus, who looks at a -10% in two days and thinks this is the time to sell.
Fucking DOW who’s buying these boomer stocks
My ass was all over the place today, time for a joint
dont forget to tip me well daddy
Fuckin GOOD
Same.
[deleted]
When’s RKT ER?
Lsu- Alabama postponed. Hmmmmmm
I feel ya. blue balls at the end. was hoping for a pump to at least -5.2
Yeah, if there were a bunch of very obviously undervalued stocks outside of tech, and tech is at ATHs, and you were a boomer, wouldn’t you move your money into them?
Tomorrow: tech big green, airlines and cruises bigly red.

Yes or no probably.
The good ole inverse
Deposit more so the percent decreases
Alive
Stocks have done this a lot -- but when they beat usually it recovers the following week.

To play earnings it's best not to get expiries for that week, put a 1-2 week cushion on them to account for a post earnings sell off or random market events.
T and CVS made me the most money today. I wish I was joking.
Holy fuck I’m nervous
one of the gayest days ive had in a while
Doing the same thing 😂😂😂
gl fren. i was up 30% at one point today.  holding over night and will try to time a low tomorrow to sell if there is one
I feel bad for you guys. 25 day trades today here 😂
RKT has never been red from IPO price
Lol they would pump GME AH
All I want for Christmas is a $30 RKT ship
Holy RKT earnings
Everyone on RKT chill. IV is so high that whichever way it goes no one is getting rich.
I’m a dirty degen gambler, had to put part of my RKT earnings on a $25c weekly lmfao
There's way too many people in rkt calls for it to go up
Ironically you can make Chicken tendies while working at Wendys, best of both worlds!
Yes
shitty because of the homeless? Or am i missing something? thought austin was a fine city
Baba is the fuckest
I feel ah TSLA gap’n up tomorr... I feel it in me balls
God I hope you bought puts EOD  SO CHEAP.
How do you RKT riders feel ?
Right about when your account turns blood red

Half of my port in weekly tesla calls, going to wake up tomorrow to 💰💰💰💰💰💰
Oh no
APHA casually pumping at close while the rest of weed eats shit
Times like this I wish we were just chillin at the bar. The computers and miles between makes things so weird. We are clearly on entirely different pages. Rather than friendly conversation, youve made multiple comments that were aggressive and rude. Why are you trying to start a fight? Do you want to talk about it?
I’m so glad I saw this post before market close. Bought a shit ton of puts literally a minute before close. This stock is about to shit it’s fucking pants
rocket boys off to a good start for calls.. well see
I guess my RKT Puts won't print

Should’ve = Should have.
Penises down.
Sold my RKT put at close for a 20% profit LFG
So why is tech still falling? Still vaccine?
When shit go up too much it needs to go down a little bit too balance out. Ying n yang my man. Nio will continue to run it up til earnings, after that who knows what
RKT COME ON DONT FAIL ME NOW
I bought calls decently cheap this morning after burning a day trade on SQQQ. Hoping today's movement doesn't fade tomorrow
Puts on your sister's intellect.
This is what happens when you sell a 3D render to the world as an actual car manufacturer.
sometimes it feels like mm hacked the concept of time and made that last minute the market is open be like 20 seconds
I just blindly followed your autism logic of “feels like it’s going to drop” ty for future tendies
We will see tomorrow
It's def selling off in AH the guidance will be bad
Alright crayons down hands up.
With you my man!!!
Lmfao
Ahhh fuck closed 50 dollars under 25k
Good thing im in spy calls then
ACB and APHA merger rumors starting up again? APHA seems the strongest of all the players, so might as well start merging.

Hello....Houston? Yes this is $RKT, we are out of fuel and will be crashing here shortly, the crew’s final wish is to donate our wives and tendies to those holding RKT puts
CRSR wild day
If anything for the last two days. I'm glad I sold SQ at $199 and that ZM is tanking.
Can't agree more.  I bought RKT 25C, Sold RKT 25P.  

Then I came on here just now and market just closed.  I'm screwed
They’re pricing in further lockdowns *next year*, not in the next few months.
Fuck it, couldn't find anything I liked so I bought $75 calls on BUD on an impulse for next week

It sketches me out, cus no one can get gpusbor CPUs right now, so CRSR isn't making nearly asuch revenue as they should. The PC building demand is there though, more than ever!
you sound like: are people gonna stop flying after covid? then why are airlines down.
Please go up

600 shares at $27
Down 12% already
Fuck you apple you are supposed to tank after these shitty events...
🎉🎉
RKT gang, it is time.
STOP THE COUNT!
Black friday
Wanna buy 2k NIO shares.
CRSR going up but my calls already dead from this morning
Let’s ride PRPL gang
Just saying rkt did this last time, and y’all were saying it was “JUST SHAKING OUT THE WEAK HANDS”
Overall you still are a trashy piece of shit HYLN
Lol if you think walmart or grocery stores are going away in your lifetime youre more autistic than I thought.
If AMZN disappeared tomorrow another online retailer would step in and take their place. The world would keep spinning ya cunt. 
Apple has the same cap as AMZN because they make way more 💰. Profit margin, net income, net assets, dwarf AMZN and Cuck Bezos.when things open back up you'll see ppl ordering less on AMZN and going back to their normal routines and you can kiss your tendies goodbye.
I have no more monies :(
Probably the easiest trading day for me today. Up 11k.

Gonna celebrate by helping all the poor bastards here in Austin..god my town is so shitty.
300c 11/13
Except for SQ when I sold covered calls 🤡

Godspeed all RKTmen
Sold my 11/20 calls at HOD. Keeping my 12/18 24C's for ER. /buttclench

Rkt is going to be fun to watch
Sold AAPL to buy more RKT oh shit son
Gonna be up $3 on $7k of options. Noice
This is the way.

And I’m with you.
Lots of indecision here, wouldn't be surprised to see it tho.
Should have bought corsair calls instead of 100 shares an hour ago 😒
Puts for days
Holding all my crsr calls, am I crazy? And i fucked? Stay tuned
idk why people thought it would go up more after a 200% increase like wtf
strangle it
if your everywhere is tech, then sure. i see  plenty of green
What is it?
RKT is gonna close red isn’t it
After that huge run-up, all bears could muster up was a sad -0.1%... hella bullish for tomorrow if this is all they can do.
Stop loss on this volatile stock, broooo
[deleted]
Same, but sold for 30%. Can’t wait to see the loss porn in the morning
I hate this stupid dildo company so much.
Such a big rising wedge on SPY daily
I'll do anything to make that a reality
Yo same bought at the end of October and sold yesterday. Never will I time a stock that well
Ban
I bought RKT puts so you know what to do
RKT dick slapped hard
Until we get to the moon!
grab yo popcorn
QQQ held the 50 day moving average chill
RKT about to make or break some of you hard
I forgot this is WSB.. never miss a chance to lose money!
At what point do people realize the vaccine is still a long way off from being widely distributed
Those are some giant balls
I’m ready for RKT to hurt me again
Nah nah 8)robinhood autistic's debt collector then 9) wsb debt collectors 😆😆 gotta give the correct rankings
i did and its not treating me good
I hope it goes your way. I really hope I’m wrong. I’m not playing it this time
RKT not looking so hot.
He's using a paper account on Etoro. MODS BAN THIS FUCKER!!!!
RKT to the moon.
F
Rkt to 21.48 open tomorrow
everything except my Nov 20 Puts
Godspeed friend-o!
DIE ZM
Man that’s just adorable
I sold covered calls 11/13 $25... they were pretty good premium.  Still have no idea what’s gonna happen AH...
You should bud
Why is mouse unstoppable today while tech still getting shafted?
I have the self-control of a six-year-old
LAST MINUTE FOR LYFT PUTS
I wish
Nothingburger
You shake out them scared lil bitches.. shake all of them out right now!
fetch me those awards little boi
I’ll take a grug over some midwit 110 IQ that will believe anything, any day
Closer to $34
Hop in crsr before it’s too late
Good to hear I’m not the only one
Thank got I couldn't look at my acct during that dip.
"When WSB sell their RKT calls for a loss, pahmp eit to $35 in AH" - MM
Idk about that, just on the 5 minute chart we should be going to 348 if it breaks down
Who is rushing in to amzn lol
Bulls and bears unite to kill the kangaroo!

So thats why AMD is mooning
yeah why?
google Rocket investor relations and find the link to the webcast after you sign up
What’s he buying today? Need some tips.
You sound like someone who keeps getting burned and is butt hurt.

Plenty of examples to prove you wrong.
Anyone buying SE EOD today?
Same idk wtf the deal is
Tomorrow’s gonna be green as fuck
Cuz you want to blow up ur account
What positions are you playing on this one? Why did it dip so hard today?
God damn I have 50% invested in this right now and 2 min left. Thanks!
KO or Abbvi
2020 logic says the opposite will happen of last earnings just bought $30 11/13 calls
Liar don’t see it
Holding 10 $28C and 5 $18P cant go titts up or down
[deleted]
what do u mean no reason? haha. it moves with the overall tech sector and cause we are close to getting the vaccine, tech is not as big of a deal for now, so it shouldn't be overbought. wouldntbe surprised if it went to the low 400s
You should have know it has retard strength
I know what RKT did last time but im retarded
For sure nice play, can’t go broke taking profits
28$ ALL IN
Tomorrow is new day and new hopes.
Can we go downsies please
This was the gayest power hour in the history of power hours
Have you heard of patterns?
This is the way
Yeah, after such a huge plummet, I can't imagine them not recovering from this in a big way
all your positions are gonna tank after hours anon
I’m holding until Fri
23 would be best case scenario in my opinion
Down 66% in two days...with spreads. FML
oh lol, I left room though so as long as it doesn't reach 25 by friday im good.
Well that window to sell my RKT at a decent profit closed up fast.  Guess I’m riding this rocket straight to hell tomorrow
Hey somethings wrong w my brokerage i keep buying GME calls but my account value keeps dropping consistently anyone else has this problem ?
🙏
Lol, look at INO instead. 
You simply are dyslexic.
Lol I got out of that a while ago
lets go CRSR
Dude what it’s been pulled
ZM dumping into close. The time for lotto calls is **now.**
Look, $AAPL, if you were going to drop them let me know ahead of time so I could have sold a call near ATM. Be a pal.
fml
Im team rocket but this did age horrendously
Spy 300 when
just watch RKT gonna be flat
Probably
selling half my contracts right now. Can't take a full on loss in case it tanks after earnings.
Why is AMD giving me whiplash?
how to watch earnings call? i got my 150 shares ready to take off to an alternate universe
Perhaps, but I snagged a decent profit at the top.  Exp 11/13 so everything would absolutely hinge on the ER.  My goal was to profit off the ER runup and that’s what I did.
It was a bumpy ass day, but CRSR pulled through.
A $2 move? Oh no!
E-commerce getting fucked big time lately
🥭 supporter?
RKT just making some room before the inevitable moon mission tomorrow 🚀
Yeah thats on mobile. You can do the same changes
😲 omg really?
Made 18.5 points on ES today and 20 yesterday. Starting the week off good :)
That’s what I’m saying but on the off chance I’m wrong you need to decide if you’re willing to risk it for some tendies. Godspeed.

Tomorrow will determine if I have lost my entire account, or if I live to fight another day.
Deirdra Bosa so hot in the face.
Real ones sold RKT 30 calls on that bump to lock in profit. Now lets see what happens
[deleted]
Is there any better feeling than selling your call and seeing the stock tank 3 minutes later?
I'm not convinced. I'm seeing this through.
fuck it im holding through earnings
Sometimes I wonder if RKT market makers are just selling a shit ton of covered calls and laughing at us.

Can’t tell if I’m going to be buying my Porsche or going homeless from RKT.

It’s either going to be another WSB extinction event OR it’ll be a throwback to WSB unstoppable yolo days where stocks like SPCE and TSLA don’t stop climbing.
Are cyclicals the play for a third day in a row? The June pump lasted 2 days
Yaaaas by investing into penny stock! Woo yeah 😆
It went to $30?
Idk about him but I sold all my shares/calls at 12$ and I bought at 4$ so im feeling pretty good tbh
[deleted]
Yes same here
ClayFaggot just did a video on NIO. RIP to my calls its fucking done boys.
Vaccine is bearish
CRSR MOONING FINALLY LMAO
[deleted]
Soxl fucked you too
I paper hands and sold at 22.20 for 50% gain
Cry
Cuz most stocks are over valued
If you’re playing DDOG 18.4% expected move on earnings. Good luck.
[deleted]
It’s totally gonna go back up, right guys? Totally
Theyre pinning RKT at $21.60 those fucks
I sold for a 30% profit and bought puts with my profits. Let’s see how retarded it is to bet against retards
YOURE RIGHT 😅
I will buy the dip in the morning when it’s sitting at $15.
 Once we break out of this ascending wedge we’re going down

Bought an 18P on RKT at top, I don't give a damn, just go bigly either way
It's my fav buy the dip shares stock
Yea I would rather they starve to death or go into prostitution.
Open interest and IV seem to be spiking again on ACB calls...

Don’t worry I’m making it there on robinhood! Gonna have 1 billion dollars in my trading portfolio

I’m holding. You’re holding.....right?
Man i spent so much time today managing my trades, and im right back where i started, hmmm. Well, baba leaps are lookin mighty tasty, might catch kung flu
So he just said take off your shirt and she did it? He may not be the only one off in that family.
[deleted]
That means your portfolio is like 20% AAPL. That’s pretty much all Berkshire holds these days
Yes hold fucker. Leaps are free money
Guys...if you haven't noticed the trend yet. Literally **every stock** sells off on earnings. Good, bad. Don't matter. Investors looking for a reason to take profits / dump.
Your Fibonacci sequence is accelerating
Yes
How did you lose money these past 4 years when we’ve had the largest bull run? I think you’re doing something wrong.
Hahahahaha child labor bad, starvation better 😳😳🥺
nvda down 15% in 2 days for no fucking reason. ez by the dip here, especially with earnings run up next week.
One word. Corsair gaming
Last 5 minutes until casino is closed. Place your bets for tomorrow. Don’t forget to tip the dealer ;)
sold half of my calls. got partial cost back. hoping get the rest tomorrow.
Thanks for this post- didn't realize ER got moved up. Just sold a bunch of 22.5P
Why tf did I just buy more SPY puts
Absolutely
AMD's new GPUs are "benchmarked" faster and cost less.
Yeah me too
Smaller plays won't get me to BE.
MM stands for market manipulation
This aged well
lets pray
RKT is gonna make or break me lmaoo holy shit. AH gonna be tense
Yikes
4sho
Shhhhh
Lol wut 😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ you gave Obama or he won?
Reason to hold, all the hype and I believe it too. Homes were on the market for the shortest average time ever, but then again who ducking knows
Also AMD, NVDA, ZM, SHOP and some others
[deleted]
Feeling awfully wobbly up here
Scary money doesn't make no money.
Just bought some LYFT 11/20 35p
yup, same mayne, except i lost 10k more :(
Assuming it can, yes.  Obviously risks, delay, spaceship blows up, low consumer interest or perhaps the company can’t scale the business.  

Do your research, and I think you will be impressed.

Key test flight is in 2 weeks that will be a game changer.
So take a loss on my calls I bought today? Rather than bigger loss tomorrow because of IV crush?
Just spitting out hella ipos?
You know how options work.
Trust a guy when he says he aint pulling out for shit.   He means it.
No chill
I held BA from 330 to 100 and averaged down to 145. So imma hold this bitch till death
I heard they lost the recipe for GPUs
report back.
💎👐
Smaller plays bro
Short term Gold at 1800 and silver at 22.5-23
420 EOW
Dont worry my asshole is lubed and ready this time
Hmmmmmm I wonder what retarded positions I’ll open tomorrow after I close everything I bought today for a loss🤔
Retail running out of steam
Get all your paper hands out of RKT. MMs and I have tendies to make

Rkt looking good before close😂😂🤡
RKT pummelled in the AM, RKT pummelled in the PM, doesn't fucking matter what play you make...
Im only looking for 15% return annually.   What are safe bets
just a new Lil Yatchy music would solve that problem
50+ after earnings. 0 DD, just a round number
RKT gonna 🚀🚀🚀
Isnt RKT a boomer stock?? Imma guess they open at $24 tomorrow
today was a red day after a bigly green ass day,nothing weird about this,but,i find it weird that theres no bears saying "bulls r fuc" or "rug pull coming" what did i lost ? why there are no bear comments? hibernation started?? Ah almost forgot,tell me whats going on tomorrow??? green or red??? thanks wsb love yall <3
Idgi
That’s gonna be a big hold and average up/down, chief. $BABA is a guaranteed 4 digit stock a few years down the road. CCP is just tightening the belt. It will pass.
Beuller?
This RKT strangle is the play. Everyone expecting them to moon. Perfect reason for them to drop. Either way, I win off selling premium from volatility.
I don't think so, the fundamentals are strong by many analysts' admission. I think a very red day may just not have produced the desired run up, and vaccine news wouldn't help it
notsureifsrs. literally largest mortgage company there is
Why buy AMZN though?
These 6 min couldn’t be any slower
why are people rushing into amazon???

Right? Imagine screenshotting every time your ticker went up.
Only people with very low IQs believe we live in a racist nation. We’re mostly mixed race and gave Obama 2 terms. GTFO with your dumb shit
It hit $45 today, for like a nano-second.
This is the way.
Exactly. 11/27 20
Make it stop!
lol
[deleted]
Dude I laugh so hard
Do I sell my RKT put rn for a 7 dollar profit hurry guys
Buy the dip, chump. #neverpullout
Sometimes, I wish I could light up a cigar and time automatically passes by so I don’t have to sit and wait for shit to get done. My 3D prints will take another 4 hours plus clean up before I can go home.
My mother in law does our taxes. I want to see her face when she sees how much I lost this year.
SPY GO DOWN
Praying that Lyft dies. I have such a burning hatred for it that I kept buying puts at the top yesterday. Looks really good right now, but I'm half expecting it to moon again
I have long shares at a 498 avg cost lol but I picked up an 11/20 600c today for fun cuz I love losing money
gl bro. needs a 16% move or some shit AH today gods
Wasnt in the First Time. I don't want to miss It this time for sure!
Bring back Trump!  This market blows!
Have we decided if tech is dead yet since the vaccine final boss rug pull is within pricing distance?
why, is the selling over u think?
Yes
buying this amd dip
Dangerous drugs being legal doesn't make you any less of a sinner.
I am still bagholding PANW shares I bought at $265. Gaped down after earnings and hasn't gotten close since. Least shares don't expire.
Holiday pump and dump is just around the corner! Get your calls locked in before we go parabolic!
Saying it now, spy ath tomorrow
Made a killing buying the dip today and already collected my wins. You guys could also win by following this simple model of buying low and selling high.
It’s $52 brother. Who fucking cares.
JUST LIKE BABA
WTF is this RKT action?
[deleted]
Oof sorry about that man
It took me couple of weeks to get some gains back and 2 days to lose it all. This is so fucking depressing.
RKT has actual down syndrome
PLTR
And my calls are still dying
As someone who took a break from options for a month its nice to see so many entry points from today's mega dump
Buncha pussy rkt holders fuck y’all
Any chances SNAP and SQUARE will moon again before EOW?
HTZ
Buying a shit ton of shares. 500+ shares and then I sell once it hits a high like today right as the event started.
Dua lipa
Exactly, will probably buy 1min before close. Let’s make some tendies tomorrow my friend
PAIN
Wait til morning
Shorting market with a long call is actually balancing the risk. They don't need to sell calls. If they sold the calls they would be net short and that requires closing the short.
Those are the only ones I have.
Daaaaad, the MMs stole all my delicious tendies
Blue ball market
Who knows. Hold calls and let the rocket take its course
Lol 🤡
Nah

Last time the ENTIRE SUB was in RKT and shilled it into meme status. This time theres some chatter, but not enough to make me worried about my positions.
ATVI dump is pretty much right on queue dam to easy. My puts will print in the morning again
ATH this week?
It’s just people lost trying to support each other, you can see they aren’t at the best place in life reading through the comments
doubt it. Good luck!
RKT IS FUNNY HAHAHA
[deleted]
How much more can they dump though?
Hey, fuck you.
wtf is this rkt kangaroo shit
Baba is booboo
[removed]
Down 5K for the week oops.
SE a steal at this price? down 17% past 2 days
Dang! Double down and wait till it dips to $34.00 to sell it. You are doing great so far.
Classic rkt lmao
We’ll see, you may be kicking yourself at open

Anastasia shut up and love me
Oh god Lyft I’m cumming please don’t stop and drop harder AH


Fuck baba don’t drill you fuck I said Lyft
*pokes BABA*. Hey you guys wanna see a dead body?

Climber; excellent analogy.  I'm just riding the wave down and selling CC to the hopefuls since IV is high as opposed to selling.
Ok. I bought AMZN puts
Alibaba to $420 end of month.
Just ran a monthly call from 100% to 0% in less than 36 hours AMA.
Good point.
I did a strangle on aapl for event and down on both because of this stagnant ass shit
anyone else feel like a genius lately because every move has been time perfectly?
Call is still tomorrow but numbers come today
Die Lyft
yea,straight into the ground
RIP RKT holders
what a fucking shit show of a last two days.
Because everyone expects her to moon
ALL IN $RKT CALLS REMEMBER ME IN 7 MINUTES
20.5 11/13 puts. Worst case I lose the profit from the call I made
just wait, here comes the massive green dildo to push us up 1% tomorrow.
Why is everything so volatile?!
Why tf do I YOLO with you retards into memes like RKT
RKT Gang. Hold the line 🚀🇺🇸
Good! At a nice discount
Bots fight to breakeven
You about print
You’re reply is actually very ironic, saying “more hunting education” while simultaneously not knowing about hunting education
🐻🌏
Wtf why was REV up almost 100% today
BOGDANOFFS ARE ON LINE 1 THEYRE SAYING DAHMP EET 
AHHHHHHHHHH
If RKT was a Chinese company I would have retired by now.
Fuck you ZM
It says buy NIO 100c exp 11/27/20
Didn’t even realise it was a bleed up 
Would have been a nice day trade
I want a mini and MacBook with 20 hours of battery life 🤷‍♀️
France and Geemany about to fine them. Idk if that’ll move markets much or maybe thats why it fell
CRSR Comeback today has been a lifesaver
If the IV increase also I can make due with that 😪
You won, son
are you BABA bags holder?
Get out of RKT while you can. They’ll beat expectations again but that 200%+ IV  on those calls is for a 10% or greater move.
Back to NIO
Is rkt just a seriously manipulated stock or what?
I don’t have time to watch tv when I’m watching my gains. 😥

Are we thinking tomorrow open is the top or diamond hands till Friday?
Whatever happens to gender equality??? We only have 2 holes and gurls have 3. They earn more!!!

Why is it that your wife is allowed to have a bf? Why can't you have a bf as well???

We want equality. It's 2020.
Lol rkt couldn’t even wait until after earns you drill
It’s lower they covered some, its66.81 shares shorted instead of 70
ahh..there is that apple dump
Any tech put to sell at open, SNE 11/20c
20p me too, sold a call for 50% and turned it back into a p

Doesn’t need to work. Only that people will believe it will. Like Tesla’s full self driving / robotaxi fleet
Wtf is going on with it rn
Why don't we all collectively pitch in to make a super computer for high speed trading
Mmm yes It appears I've made an unfortunate decision yesterday that has cost me a large sum of money today
Except for when they're not.
made 25% off a 15 minute day trade when I saw the tards here spamming it
>shorting your own stocks

Then it won't remain my stock
will you sell for the love of god??? I'm hoping for 10% gain this ain't it
It's okay AMD you can get your rest today

I am too bro
I am getting my SHIT Tossed right now
Oh ur right I just think it would react the same to some similar guidance. They won’t be able to give good guidance cause they know refinancing would go down
It's going down right now but I don't buy it. I'm seeing this through.
I bought BYND at 131 how do I always time the top...
Never forget the good times RKT gang. 11/10 3pm - 11/10 3:50pm
It keeps going down it’s at 95% I’ll sell at 59
RIP to the people who put their savings into NIO

Spy got a pretty big head and shoulders look on the 3 month chart, can anyone confirm for spy puts?
leveraging X5 i guess...it's go hard or go home and i think he's going home if it drops to 10% triggering stop-loss...hopefully not
[deleted]
except for the higher run ups and lower turns down. XPEV was over +1% at some point today.
Honestly the way covid is going up i dont doubt it. Also, rotation has got to stop at some point. Right... RIGHT?!?
FSR sucks don’t listen to the idiots on here. Sell FSR, Buy NIO
Really and what’s that just hold or hedge
You’re on WSB bets. You should damn well know this shit is retarded and doesn’t reflect much of anything, much less the economy.
Marhsall Mathers
OH NO NO NO NO NO NO NO
Man sold off my RKT calls right before this drop.  How the fuck did I actually manage the correct play?
XPEV = Jordan
NIO = Scalabrine
Because it’s easier for analysts to analyze a company who’s sole income is contracts rather than sales
Rocket with the very legal pump and dump within 40 minutes
I would say thats smart
Rkt crash landing, will end red. We gonna see 16$, because I have calls and I never win
I’d guess the average portfolio here is down 30%+ all time but it was up 300% for 20 minutes in July.
or it'll stay right around 21.50 and everyone loses
I've realized that I'm too much of a wimp to handle options so I just picked up stock. Just going to forget I have it for a few years and see where we end up.
so if it's at $115 you're just buying a shit ton of weekly $116 calls and selling once you're ITM?
You better hope it drops like crazy. That IV is insane
Here comes the EOD mm dump
If you want a boomer stock to hold for 2 or 3 days try ARR. Ex dividend day is the 13th so we may see people buying in. You can hold until the dividend payout if you want.
LMAO I hope you didn’t buy $RXT or $RTX
Yes
Zoom is fighting back too much, just shhhh go to sleep
“I’ll just sell my rkt calls right before close”

Said every trader ever today 😂
Does your dick point to the left or to the right from all the jacking off you do?
Yes
DDOG got fucking smoked on ER last time so probably smart
$DOWNS

[deleted]

im still down 60% so don't think i'm so smart either
Hope you tards sold out of RKT above 22

anyone else loading up on puts before close or am I the only idiot?
Apple want moon
Oof this close is not looking good for rkt lol
Earnings outlook looking good. Should run up next week
RKT IS DED
Probably the same or less fucked as mine. Im holding though because I'm emotionally numb now.
We can’t have 2 lame days in a row? Right?
I know bro - it pulled me out of the red single handedly.
I learned from last earnings to take the gains while you have it. Bag holding was tough
No
This market is fucking hilarious, BA posts news of canceled orders = stonk goes up
[deleted]
all in on TSLA
Can you fit some of my clothes in there
as the animal?
I just sold mine then bought more farther OTM!
Yup take at least some profits imo, although I stopped holding anything through ERs
clean her sins
Spy trading sideways over 3 months. I wish I just bought the other shit that moving 100%over that time period.
RKT ran out of fuel
I sold half and am riding the rest out. It's like I got these calls at a 80% discount is how I look at it. Max pain is only 20% of what it would've been on the same number  


I only had 1k even. the balls on you friend. IV crush is going to be legendary if this goes nowhere. I'm praying for you retard
So they have like ten years to load up😂😂

Actually a good idea
How are people making money with AAPL when it's been stuck in its $115 to $120 channel for weeks
What do you mean with "normal correction"? Plus, having in mind that its earnings (nio) are coming next week. Should it go up? I'm just don't get why it has such much level of volatile
GME short interest updated today who has

Cheap stock to hold shares on before close???? Gme/palantir ?

Bro RKT is garbage
Or you could buy puts and post gain
Big bull energy into close for $NIO here we go
RKT movements got me nail biting. It’s like somebody got the report on their desk early, scanned it and is fucking with us.

Ready to lose money on RKT calls :)
If you think about it, their could be a nuclear war and GameStop would still short squeeze Becuase all shorts would cover just in case the world ends
Ever heard of 'two wrongs don't make a right' ?

Also, some people can dish it out but can't take it. Very common on today's society full of keyboard warriors.
Good luck brother
thank u
Yeah given how most ERs have gone recently, it wouldn't surprise me to see a selloff regardless of how good the ER is
Me too!
so buy more baba?
Oh really?
This will not end well. I hope I’m wrong and good luck 👍
Sell
if you are, what strike and stuff? im too scared to
At least Enron had a product for sale.  If you never read about make sure to look it up.  It is very funny what commodity markets they were trying to make.
Noice
I'm up 30% on my 3k worth of 11/13 RKT calls what should I do?

HAHA jk, im gonna hold them like a retard.
I don't know about you guys but I'm playing NIO earnings, fuck it. I ain't pulling out for shit. I'll post my losses/gains whatever but I have enough faith to believe that this is going to take off like no other.

thats different though, annouincing services that will generate income is a big deal. people can talk about it, but obviously it wont be priced in until the service comes out. 

with gamestop, people are banking on the console release to trigger a short squeeze, but those arent exclusive to gamestop (theyre going to be sold literally everywhere else). And gamestop ont get some big gains from them. earnings in december will be make or break
lol wtf chart you looking at
Are we just not moving till EOD..

I thought that there was going to be a minor correction after the massive rally. I got what i needed just the reason for it was extremely different.
I was talking to this one guy on reddit who thinks some random guy he doesn't even know on Facebook accounts for atleast 70 million people. Sad thing is he's to retarded to know how fucking dumb that sounds.

You clearly know nothing about animal agriculture and sustainability. If everyone went out and hunted, or even half the population or a fraction. Most organic would be dead in less than a week. Sustainability, is about optimality and preservation of resources on a large scale I.e. the human race. Animal farming, no matter local or factory, hunting etc. objectively cannot be associated with sustainability.
I sold 23 this morning, would have been nice to wait until now like you did but after last time I had to make the early move
I want to see where this goes
CCL
$29.69
“guh”
i held my calls through last earnings and have been bagholding ever since. I even doubled down when it dropped under 25 and bagheld that too. So praying something lets me get out of this
(.)(.)
Sold half my RKT calls on this runup to AH earnings. you CANT TAKE AWAY THESE TENDIES IV CRUSH
I'm glad I took my 8 dollars and ran rkt men
Those manipulative MM bastards will pry my worthless contracts out of my cold dead hands.

rkt prob has terrible earnings, since its being priced in
I mean at this point just hold
down 7k on 310
$10 -> $20 LETSGOOOO
Will I be able to get mey $1.00 ask on RKT for 11/13 $28 calls!?
Not great, not terrible
Well the good news is that in Austrian economics your post is rational.
Will the sell off continue tomorrow?
I'm hopeful about RKT, but one thing I don't understand is people keep comparing it to "last time." Last time it ran up to 34 and generally had a lot more movement. Nothing about its position now is similar to last time, including IV (on the chain I'm following) being less than half of what it was last time. So it might be a dud, time will tell, but it's silly to compare it to last time.
How many?

Life is better when you watch only the first and last 15 minutes of trading each day.
Yea
:(

Yeah, right. It's getting wrecked, man. IDK what to tell you either. Just watched a ton of money evaporate on this crap. Bezos selling an extra $3bn at $3300 should've been a good sign to get the fuck out.

I don't think this is vaccine news, either. I think this is the Biden presidency repricing, now happening for real.

How is the vaccine a surprise to anyone? I don't get it. Are people going to stop shopping on Amazon because there's a vaccine? Are people looking forward to going back to their supermarkets? Even if the vaccine were approved yesterday, it would take a year or two by the time it got to you and I. How is that different from what we thought would happen?

Was ZOOM priced for a perpetual, until-the-end-of-time pandemic? How does it drop so much on vaccine news alone?

Fuck.  


Edit: AMZN 3420 1/15/2021
I sold puts at 240. safe-ish but Nervous.
You’d get a lot more upvotes if that ? was a !

Guh
Probably shouldn't have played with my tuition money. FUCK
Shit I lost $60 today on NIO lol I’m hoping it comes thru
Why are you chasing a managed hosting provider?
At least it's under $300 which we'll probably see resistance there if price gets back up there. I'd set a sell to get rid of some at break even just in case it gets near 300 and drops back down. That way you'll have money to average down.
feel like puts at 354 is free money, can't even breach it...
You're gonna moon dw

My point was you had two chances to buy the dip, dumbass.

Went down somewhat because of NKLA puts, but somehow broke even playing BYND calls today

I remember seeing this on TikTok and I think the guy’s friend said he broke both his legs or something
I got a RKT call and a LYFT put so I don't get fomo
His update:
[UPDATE]

3:27PM EDT, RKT is up around 2.5% after remaining flat for the most of the day.
I can actually take a profit, but I am of the diamond handed variety.
Anyone else think Uber could hit 55 EOW?
SPY doing its best at murdering both gangs in the last half hour
someone talk me out of this one
Which?
I got pics to prove I already doubled
keep in mind it's still up 32% since last week. Not sure I'd call this a dip
same, but im not wishing for RKT earnings to go to shit. rather have both of us winning
This makes me want to buy puts
RKT needs to go up 20% more for me to profit thanks
You know what I bought...
take profit sir
Usually goes down so....
[deleted]
I warn team rkt one last time. Sell guidance would tank it like last time and tomorrow the calls would be worth less lol
Definitely take profit. If you want to be risky, take profit on half and leave half
[deleted]
Oh it can go a lot lower
Lyft puts or Rocket puts?
BABA was a smart play and you just got fucked by random chance.  Fuck the Chinese regulators.  BABA is a fucking awesome company making shit tons of money and had several great catalysts that all got ruined by regulators flexing.  NIO is a pure story stock at this point, way overvalued.  And even if it does great in say 3-5 years, it's still just a fucking car company.  Bending steal.  Low margins.  Warranties, service, recalls.

Opened RKT Nov13 20/21/23/24 iron condors for today's earnings. 

Breakeven's at 20.27-23.73. I can live with that. 

This, of course, means it's going up 40% tonight.
RKT is gonna do well on earnings today. Just looking at the number of new mortgages being taken out and all of the fucking refinancing in the last 3 months, RKT has literally nothing to lose. Probably going to give solid guidance as well considering holiday season coming up and more people potentially buying. Cant go tits up.

Used to bitch and complain that my job didn't pay me enough and how I was supposed to save money with this type of salary.

Then I found options and now looking at my all-time losses, I can see how much of a retard I am.

😯 no
I told my mom that RKT was pumping up into close right before earnings and somehow she interpreted that as a buy signal from me so she just put all her Robinhood money into it.

I hope RKT gets a good earnings beat so my mom doesnt get disappointed in me.
Oh god RKT gunna cum yuge buckets

RKT
OLLI flying under everyone’s radar right now. Really good price here.
What do we think will happen with AAPL tomorrow? More flatness or post-event downwards move?
Reeeeeeeo
If trump actually somehow comes on top of this we’re gonna have a mini civil war which is kinda bullish

NIO and NVDA killing me.  Bout to average down

Do I hold RKT calls through earnings or take the 60% profit
True. I don't feel great about tomorrow tbh. Guess I'll average down if that happens
Alright boys I'm gonna play this RKT ER with ya'll.

I just figure, hey aerospace engineering has to go be raking in the dough, right? Rockets are fuckin expensive! They HAVE to kill it.
Godspeed, hope they print bigly
Don’t worry guys, cases increase exponentially. Tech will rule once more.

why did i buy so much pcg I 😡 hate 😡 you singular guy that told me to
MMs pinning RKT. It wants to moon. They know something. This shit will 🚀
I been dealing with them since the late 80s-00, kiddo.  I know a few things about the CCP.  It's not complicated at all, just follow the money.

He said something against the party, which is how they all make their living.   That's a no-no.  Don't matter who you are.  You'll be outta here.  The end.

Only way is to buy your way back, but I doubt Ma got that kind of money.  He is more of a mascot than the real deal.

My calls are

Really Bulls? You fucking pussies are going to let Bears have an even tiny victory day? Stocks only go up. Hit the buy button. Very simple.

Getting drunk for RKT earnings was a great idea

WTF BABA
Getting up to ATH while the rest of tech is falling. Good sign right?
But the IV :(
You know a DD post is bad when I could have heard the exact same thing from those assdragging autists at CNBC before it was posted.
how far out?
Then just go for BRKB to act as a value preservation. You don't know if the bears aren't gonna eat you alive in the next 6 months.
Sold the 20 RKT weeklies. Bought some further out shit to have skin in the game.
Dude you have one of those? What did it say?
Buying $LMND puts when it hit $68.30 appears to have been a great move. Stay tuned
What happened to NIO today worried about my 70c
RKT 18P 11/13
RKT to 30 or 20
Am I gonna triple down on NIO, surely not
They’ve bought more commercial space than anyone during one of the busiest times ever for refinances and mortgages, meaning they have the ability to scale in the mortgage market place faster than anyone ever has before. I am assuming they’ve processed a fuckton of loans, sold them off to fannie and freddy and kept the profits. They also retain 76% of customers, so they’ll be the go to for future refinancing of their current customers. This number is around 20% for most banks
Dude NNN
[deleted]
Same reason it did yesterday, vaccine hopes / sector rotation. Probably going to cash out tho
YOLO more into BABA lmao. got more PAYPAL...if they believe in shitcoins and they are right, its gonna blow up
Past behavior has shown that. But his own neice said he would try to "burn everything down" in the event of a loss. She is a psychologist so I would trust her opinion.
My calls theta crushed yet again
🚀
I agree, still a big If on which way the senate falls. I’m no expert, but I think it might be possible to get a republican senate to do fiscal without a corporate tax hike.. just might have to be a smaller package. Will be interesting to see how the cards fall
ouch, i want this to not be true
Witness confirmed. Do you need any more proof?
its ok NIO. I know you're trying your best. Tomorrow its to the moon 🌑🚀🚀
Renting them (or parts of them that is) could be legal in NV depending on their age and willingness ;)
Thanks for nothing
can't sell these calls after hours

so i was hoping for a bigger run-up
It went down after the official earnings call because there was nothing new. We already knew what the earnings, and no one knew what was going to happen in the next quarter. Better luck this time!
What a wasted day man. We need definitive pumps. Tomorrow should be big green in honor of veterans days.
Took 45% on RKT. Skipping earnings now
I’m jerking off rn to my portfolio
Should be good on that date. I’m talking more short term. Expiring Friday would be bad.
It only rebalances daily, it doesn't exactly match the Nasdaq 100 intraday

Today is the day it works 💎✋🏻
Pump or Dump? We can't have 2 sideways days in a row. That's against the 2020 version of the rules.
its all about guidance
Yeah I’m pretty broke now
[removed]
I will hold these BABA calls until they turn to diamonds in my hands MM wont shake me out!
Ugh please be right
I feel violated, well even more violated.
NIO sells 5,000 fucking cars a month.  How much do you think that piece of shit company is worth?  It almost caught up to BYD a far superior company that sells 4 times as many cars.  It's also worth twice what XPeng is worth who is about to catch them in sales.  But NIO is a story stock that has harnessed the strength of a million retards and likely has reached escape velocity.  I would not be surprised to see this POS hit $80 a share within 3 months.
today looks alot like the 6th for NIO, expect another run at 45 tomorrow.
Market news: time to rotate out of tech.

Apple: 100 EOW

MSFT: 190 EOW

**SNAP:** *100 EOW*

Currently holding soooo many puts. Probably gonna average down because I hate money.
gap up tomorrow
Lol didn’t even thought about that 😂 yeah it’s definitely a bad play
Buy rkt 30 2022s before close?
Come on MSFT you wanna go to 300
How can you be so sure?
Anybody holding AAPL puts overnight?

Don't short when it's at support. Too many people blew their accounts up with puts during October right before the elections. If QQQ drops below 275 then close your puts.

Here's the thing with RKT. Most mortgage places give out commissions to their agents. RKT is all online so they take in 100% of the profit. Rkt is about their ease of use online platform.
that's a pretty weak rkt pump
I rolled out into more leaps just in case the retard rotation continues for a while. Stimulus is coming soon anyways should raise all markets. Just make sure your leaps are past March.
Today sucked. Tomorrow’s gonna be a good day

SQ will moon past 200, but only when my calls expire worthless
unless youre down more than 40% on ur call id say cut your losses, if not just hold youll thank me in the morning
I can feel warmth wetness between my my cheeks rn
Last quarter they were down after hours and only up 2% once market opened even though they beat expectations. I would be cautious. I’m debating wether to play or not
It's site actually gets favorable reviews from what I;ve seen. Streamlined and easy to use
There wasn’t a ton of RKT hype this go round in this sub so we should be good. Flying a little under the radar.
if you don’t hold RKT thru ER you ain’t black
Why would I buy RKT in the next 20 min? Inform me.

At the ATH?
Yeah but is tomorrow green is the question. If it’s red, could shed another 70-80
Shoot ur shot. We're rooting for you
And yet these are all reasonable questions.

Maybe if you see reasonable questions as "idiocy" your theory is wrong?

Like your "$20" quote -- I genuinely don't know what "$20" of gold is versus "$20" of anything else. What is "$20?" The correct answer: an arbitrary measure of demand at that moment. Entirely arbitrary.  It has no more meaning to say "$20 of gold" than "$20" of paper.

But with paper you can inject fuel to the money fire, or remove money from the money fire (via bonds) to keep the fire at the same temperature. You can't do that with any fixed commodity. 

And that's why your system was abandoned a hundred years ago -- because it. does. not. work.
IV is 200% on a lot of these options. If you’re long. Sell out on this bounce right now. Tomorrow is going to be IV crush central

I will be. I got burned last ER - although RKT was at a much higher price going into ER, I'm just not feeling the risk right now.
Do i get out of GUSH or ride the stonk to the moon?!?!

Holding RKT calls through earnings that I also held through their last earnings
Ass fucked by the Chinese regulators twice in 2 weeks.  First scuttle the ANT IPO.  But come on, day before Singles Day?!!!??  Chance for BABA to get some momentum and mojo back and they cut its hamstrings.  FUCK!  I've lost about $50k in a week.  I'm bleeding out from my asshole.  I'll never be able to shit right again.
Weekly chart has lots up upside. Buckle up
I bought a few shares at $3,050. If I can flip them for $3,400 or so, that's fine.
why the fuck would you go to vegas when you can just sit at home and get the same amount of drunk and lose the same amount of money
I'm no expert but if it's mooning now that's an indication people are looking to hold shares through earnings. If they make a big announcement like the auto loans rumour and/or smash earnings then it should hold or go further. Anything else and it will go back down to 18-20.
NVDA you better be back up in a week I swear to God
I’m sorry but bears, does the “Triple Top” normally end with a significantly higher low?

Can I buy some calls on MYASS?
We fucking got this boys
No meaning earnings had been released over a week before the earnings call since they were a brand new IPO.

All that the earnings call would have revealed would be guidance.  The quarterly profit was already known before that earnings call date.  This time, it's news to everyone (that aren't insiders) what the past quarter's earnings are.
At least tag it as shitpost you retard. Ban

Hyllion wasn't bailed out by the Chinese fucking government.

Remember PRPL? Pepperidge farm remembers....
Didn’t happen they would never pay this valuation 😂😂🤡
I mean it's just wild when you start to learn the particulars and can see the manipulation happening in front of you.
Probably going to sell my calls pre-earnings after looking at what happened last time. Any reason I shouldn’t?

Is it retarded for me to be annoyed when people say “x% of people aren’t in the stock market only the super rich so here’s why the stock market isn’t economy and why we should fuck over the stock market”. Seems like populist bullshit for broke lazy millennials to bitch about because rich people are easy for them to attack.

Not sure to purchase ZM puts or calls? Cases are going up and some states are implementing curfews. However, vaccine is out now.

Corporate taxation policy becomes a negotiation between the White House and the Senate assuming the Republicans retain control of the Senate. While in that scenario Biden might not get the full 28% corporate tax rate, it's highly probable that he'll increase it to an amount between the current low rate and the 28%. Unless Biden sits around and does no fiscal spending over the next 4 years, he'll have to negotiate some type of tax revenue increase with the Republican Senate, and this is the most probable scenario.
Buy the dip. This is one stock that has a future. Just like Amazon

BABA's RSI is 13, it's in WAY oversold territory.  It will come back a little.  Not back to 320 any time soon, but it will come back.

I'm still skeptical of this "rotation". Companies like CCL and AAL, retail, etc won't be making money or getting out of the Rona hole for a while.
Hope so lol! Only needed to go up 2% to break even thought that should be fine can’t go tits up. Drops 10% the next day 😂🤦‍♂️
Dude what's with the CCL?
Market not rocketing because 🥭 and Pompeo hate democracy
I’m making a conscience decision not to take profits and I’m up 130% on them so far. Join me.
Crushed earnings today and provided good guidance
This will most likely be RKT's best quarter for a long time. And these stocky bois are forward looking, right? Idk man

Good luck to RKT'eers through earnings. :moon:
We are seeing a rotation out of 'Covid' plays due to the vaccine on the horizon and the mkt being fwd looking. $ZM, Carvana, Peloton, etc will continue to be rotated out of and you will see inflows into energy , reits, retail, etc with the expectations of a return to normal in 2021. All the fancy high flying, no earnings having, 500 PE unicorns are being herded up for the slaughter. Get out while you still can.
Bought a couple RKT 18p 11/20. Too many ppl here on the rkt ship expecting a moon mission
Don’t know why RKT is mooning, but I bought it almost 5 min before it started. So whatever the reason let’s keep it going shall we

This is just the RKT warming up. Wait till it takes off
shhhh. I bought a 62.5p on it bc I'm guessing it shits earnings
Hold RKT 12/18 $22 calls overnight? I’m down 34%
Those prices are fantastic we’re not gonna do better than that 💰💰
Nice
Fidelity's bid/ ask is always off on their mobile app. If it's higher on rh, just put in that # for limit order. It'll go thru
Last time it was at 34
no i just sold my calls today for 2% gain 🤡
Theta gunna ✨rape✨
I don't think they'll reach pre-COVID prices ($20+) within the next 12 months given this is a deep value play, but at the highly depressed prices right now, it's probable that they'll see a significant rebound in share prices in the next 12 months. They've significantly deleveraged the company over the past year, and have no short-term debt due in 2021 as they continue practicing capital discipline by removing common distributions while they pay down debt. Wait for the post-COVID earnings recovery to see this stock price rebound.
i think it went lower...
Buckle up boys we’re going up
Yeah kid, heh, I'm that guy. That guy that just made $6 on this rkt scalp 😎

Oh shit I forgot about DDOG earnings today. They’ll smack.
whatcha holding?

i have 400 odd shares left at like 24 and 20c leaps that i bought when i dumped the other 400 shares when it came back to 23+ somehow awhile back.

the smart move would have been to dump all but alas

(or all of it at 30+ but i had to sell 35, 37, and even further OTM shit against the shares only to baghold forever)

Lol guys, what if RKT just climbs to 40 AH and actually holds it until tomorrow morning at Bell? 

That'd be a dream right there..
Hmmm might take this 50%+ on RKT and relax for er
I can go ahead and confirm that. NIO $60 why the hell not?
Yup, TQQQ is definitely my new thing. I’m addicted.
Rkt did same thing last earnings, it’s a trap
Go ahead and moisten the tip of the needle and get ready to pump.

Arbitrageeeee
BABA WEEKLIES ARE THE MOVE
Going to inverse WSB on RKT. Let’s see how it goes.
cut and run, that'll be tree fiddy
I have a bidet because I like how it feels
Congrats you retard
No way, 108 is about right. Nonetheless, lotsa moving parts, with lotsa players. We’ll see. GL!👍
I do
wow someone still playing CORN i thought u guys were dead? lol
Pulling my pants down in preparation for gaping at close...
Rh skims orders like that
alright RKT don't fail me this time! to 25s!!!
My dad is going to rape me again when he finds out I sold 30k in brk.b shares to buy calls in baba
YES SIRRRRRRRERRRR
Wow. This was literally the top lol
Diamond hands, gunna be the GOAT looking back in a few years
Come on give us 355
Noo, fuck you, I have calls because I’m a rkt maan!! Dec 18 35C
Whelp, got cucked again, thanks spy you rag tail bastard...
I'm glad you've cottoned on to this fella's message. Hope is a good thing to have. There's a lot of crazy shit to get into in this world, the world's your fucking oyster. At least you lost your 15k on a YOLO or two. I lost mine on a skinny bitch who wouldn't work and couldn't cook. 

Keep your chin up. I know it probably feels like you're getting dogpiled in these comments, but I hope you can smell tough love and good intentions when they're there. Everyone's pulling for you, they're just too afraid to say it. Keep kicking and you'll get to shore.
I ain't fuckin selling RKT!
Same
It bites me a little, though, because I felt it was a good play. I just couldn't quite get there mentally. On the bright side, it was a target-rich environment in March.
Wdym the volume has been 1/2 what it normally is for the last two weeks
The ask on fidelity is 0.32 and on rh it is 0.41 that makes no sense... anyone??
It happened 🥰
Remember when half the sub was praying for the SP500 to add TSLA? those were the dayzz

This is the OG. He's been trading PRPL well before the pump.
oh, the steal is on.  just by the repugnatards.  they are praying Arizona flips when all the votes are in.  And then they only have to deal with Georgia and Wisconsin which Biden only won by 10,000 and 20,000 votes.  And both state legislatures are republican controlled.  Wisconsin is rabidly Republican and they've gerrymandered that state so bad that they won't be afraid to piss off voters and flip the electors to vote for Trump.  And if Georgia ends up for Trump when all is said and done, that's the only steal they'll have to do.  Otherwise they'll have to steal Georgia too and then it gets harder.  Just pray Arizona and Georgia don't end their recounts and vote totals after all absentee/military/overseas ballots are added in.
still 2 months left autist
Thx bby
Always inverse WSB
Never worked yet
[deleted]
I bought the RKT put because I know what happened last earnings
Was down 49% on RKT CALLS THIS MORNING. NOW IM UP 17% WOOO
[removed]
It worked out!!!
Did RKT pop a PFE viagra or get an ole Musky falcon heavy boost?
Face ripper in 3...2...1
Like $24-25
RKT might space shuttle columbia itself like last earnings remember tards
They're gonna pull a CCL and do capital raises forever

Stonks only go up
Yes, they could, but they don’t.... which means that factory farming is horrible for the environment, which was my original point.
🚀 Engaged
oh shit. I would still hold. Depends on your cash balance and if you're willing to wait. Apple will go up eventually. Tech will get rotated back into.
Shaking off the paper hands
i’ll b checking in with you later
I love messages like this, I’ve only seen it on WSB
Regardless of whether I’m being insulted or not it feels like the sub as a whole speaks to me though your comment
When everyone starts talking about RKT it’s not a good sign
# As a member of RKT gang at last ER when they wrecked earnings and stock fell 50%

Someone doesn't know how the CCP works. The real situation is too complicated for most of the retards on here. Maybe a few savants know.

Deutsche bank is just 1 Robinhood account and everyone got the login
Don’t wanna mess with earnings or run up ?
Only the stonk market
Does anyone know why there is a 7-9 cent difference in call contracts between robinhood and fidelity? This example is for a rkt contract
With MM’s not being able to trade due to Veterans Day?!

Retail is going to FOMO in on the dip. We going green green
Goooooooo!!!!!!!
It wasn't exactly a yolo as it was only about 10% of my account value in calls, but it sure scared the shit out of me when it started tanking.
It’s going to take along time for fsr to lift off
Both pump rn dump after earnings

Someone explain to me how puts on DAL are not free money
What are my moves tomorrow? Seeing as the market will be closed, I guess I'll just slav squat with these giant red dildos in my ass

Edit: I'm retarded and deserved to get downvoted for that one. I thought it would be closed for Veteran's Day.
I would put so much more money into rkt if it wasn't a meme stock because it's genuinely a good investment, but I don't see a meme stock holding ah.
you shut your damn mouth
If you have weekly calls that are way otm, IV is like 225%, if earnings doesnt get you there, iv crush will decimate you
Take profit, or hold overnight? $AMZN 3100p 11/13.
the sexy time party is onnnnn
I’m holding RKT
Doesn’t look too horrible right now, and I sold out this AM 🤡
I sure hope so
No. Unless you're looking for a lotto play
These posts need to receive bans.
Are markets open tomorrow?
Fuck, I sold 11/13 covered calls 25c
Similar day as today
This has aged well thus far
How much you up already lol? I am up 30% and have no day trades..... Sell or receive the ban
holding shares, not calls.
fake RKT pump
Looks like a pump
you mean the 30% they went up last week didnt classify as "taking off"?
Hope so picked up a leap and have my shares so should be fine. That December contract is probably screwed though
CCP party members ain't loyal.  If they think you're a liability, they'll just distance themselves from you.  

Ma is fucked.  Pissed off the wrong people.  His "friends" won't help him.  In fact, I think they may even try silence him.  He knows too much.
next 30 minutes are the best part of the day baby
gluck
All my calls are dead
Damn that’s a good sign for rkt gang, last time it had dumped before earnings
Buy BABA for singles day results
All of these even if it is true, don’t justify the valuation. So any day my friend.. any day.. hope you sleep well
We'll see what happens.
11/13 24 call. I’m gonna hold fuckkkkkk
There's been like 10 rotations out of tech this year

RKT gonna drill so hard at bell 😂
My thoughts too, I just know I've seen a lot of speculation on what could be even a bigger pullback to even out the rapid rise we've. Call ends Friday, hoping to not be SOL.
Grab puts

Threw 100 bucks in 11/20 calls for RKT . Gonna hold in overnight and hope
hurt
At least you only blew 300 bucks. Coulda been so much worse.
Spy up or down tomorrow
What date you selling?
[deleted]
someone knows something about RKTs earning, look at that spike!
Yeah. Everybody decided to pack up and leave us here. IN FUCKING CHINA
I think it's fair to still be bullish on tech, most investment in innovation comes out of some form of crisis. It's what sped up TSLA, FSLY, etc and I think you'll see continued tech investment as Corona settles back into it's shittyness and this Pfizer vaccine hype dies... which it will. If you're in it for short game it's prob fine. I'm in long on tech and innovation, and I worry this is larger bubble that will fuck me down the road where I could buy lower.
Tell that to the 11/13 18P I just grabbed for $19 😤
I’m not a troll lol. I’ve been burned before
can anyone confirm my confirmation bias that NIO had a pullback today before a parabolic ER run up
Bought leaps for ER, will reevaluate after
SPY preparing to moon
DIAMOND HANNNNNDSSSS WHATRE YOU POSTIONS IM 12/18 23c AND IM UP BUT SCARED FOR EARNINGS
Take profit, no one will fault you.
I think I’ll take the 34 percent profit or nah
Do it. Same thing that’s happening now happened 2 weeks ago when Nio dipped to 27 and shot op to 32
> so the homophobic jokes are ok 

Where did I say they were Ok? You have the reading comprehension of a child.
No go till like 2800.
You could’ve picked any other stock but you chose RKT. What a retard
Lol what an Autist...Fisker is a scammy ass hole. You forgot his first car company went bankrupt?
Lol some big boy is betting with u 😂
Load up on puts the real dump begins tomorrow
Quick RKT poll. Hold through earnings???
Odd Amazon goes to 4k by the end of the year.

I bought $62p and feeling good about it. Might wait till $69 and re-enter.

Oh, I am bullish on every other position I have
Bought $95 JD calls for next week
all in for holding on to RKT but I just swapped out my 19.5 11/13 for a 20.5 11/27, just to be safer
Calls or puts on lyft? Uber got killed in earnings yet still went up...
Do it
Shit it went up last ER even with covid. Made no sense
RKT pump or dump
Thanks for coming to it
I don’t know brother I don’t know what to tell you just told you what I saw maybe lock in some of it at least?
I'm DCA-ing into QQQ and BABA. All Jack Ma needs to do is suck some CCP cock, which he's going to do soon enuff, canny businessman that he is. Buy the BABA dip!!
Tsm monthlies at close because I hate money. Inverse me. Free money.
Your supporting evidence?
that's how all tech stock charts look and if you kept buying on the top it kept ripping higher... so why not
what's your thoughts on AMZN?
Imagine imagining

Damn should have stayed on board the RKT
Just close the markets and try again tomorrow.
Bought a 42c expiring Jan next year. Little worried
you got 35 minutes to decide :)
I’ve been holding x6 of these, bought 3 more during the dip, I expect a flip tomorrow morning in anticipation of the earnings call
Woah look what's happening
Like.. being an xray tech?
nio mooning by friday???
How many fuckers in here are dumb enough to close their app when the thread switches because mods can’t even figure out how to fix it 😂😂
Me too. No homo.
that RKT EOD pump tho. hope it doesnt end in tears
Im gonna act like I've been a RKT bull the whole time while I day trade this eod pump and gtfo before earnings
[deleted]
There are a few positive catalysts that will be priced in over the next year.

In the very near term, GLOP signed new long-term charters for 2 of their steam vessels this quarter. These ships were dry docked before that, when they generated no revenue. Therefore, there will be an immediate increase in revenue and earnings next quarter from these two ships, and this hasn't been priced into the stock as the quarterly results were just reported today.

The second catalyst of corporate tax rate increase under Biden will happen next year, when Biden takes office and starts implementing his new tax plan. There'll be some negotiation with the Senate assuming Republicans retain the Senate, but it's highly probable that Biden will raise the US corporate tax rates, which will make MLPs relatively more attractive than c-corps in terms of lower taxation.

COVID catalyst will play out next year as the Pfizer vaccine is distributed, and the global economy re-opens, in particular the shipping industry. Also worth pointing out that another catalyst is Biden's friendly relationship with China will help re-open China to world trade, which will benefit GLOP since two of their new customers are Chinese companies.
Do we buy in?
what are you moves tomorrow?????

the market is still open
Rkt will sell off AH right? Sell my calls 3:58

How come nobody mention LMND
What happened to all the NIO hype? making me feel shitty about my leaps.
Are my calls going to be ok?

Your probably right....  That's why I still have a position in it, but I just realized that I needed to manage my risk better.

Is this our opportunity to ditch RKT before earnings or do we hold to the moon!?

Commenting also interested in feedback
GUH
Carnival is gonna crash along the coast of Namibia tomorrow
hold, we’ll hit 49 by eow
I’m telling u, BABA calls rn
If it goes through amazon is going down the shitter, but the likely hood it happening is low.
RKT is about to sell off hard af, IV is insane, gg to those who held
Who's playing LMND earnings? I'm thinking this run up sells off hard.
I only bought into rkt cuz I’m addicted to the thrill of earnings. Fml 😭
RKT had a ridiculous runup before those earnings though. It's in a pretty modest position now.
ITS HAPPENING!... THE OPPOSITE DUMP
See you on Saturn RKT gang
Kind of works either way now that I look.
Right?  Some of us had to pay good money for such times.
Show your puts then
None of y’all got the balls to short RKT earnings. Including me

Is it a good time to buy SQ? I believe they will hot 200-250bn mcap in 3-5yrs, whats the bear case?
Wtf is good with all those gaps in the monthly charts lmfao
I hope eurobros will hold the line tmrw this time.
Because of this comment I’m going all in on LMND
It hurts bet my still holding till Thursday
nio 42c 10/13 all in
They launched into the 30s last time it was earnings call
I got some 150C 11/20.

Seems like the McPlant news were deceiving. Let's see if the market picks up on it and we correctly bought the dip.
you're goddamn right.
Cmon baby stay flat
I sold half my $17c... we will see what happens the the rest
I just saw a massive block of 40 weeklies above the ask
Another flat day smh
I could lose that so much faster
All in NIO RKT
I have some NIO 11/13 $45 calls to get rid of.
Why isn’t this thread pinned?
Tesla calls
11/27, tomorrow is green as grass
And maybe consider buying shares instead of options. You know... so we can actually get this squeeze going 😏
RKT OKAY
they own a 1/3 of Juul and keep wanting the entire industry, but they can just take it whenever they want. Boomers won't vape in relevant numbers; however, like their parents they'll die. All signs point to vaping keeping nicotine users alive far longer. I feel like MO should be safer than something w/ just huge spikes once a decade.
Okay i bought two call options
Give it a month 🔥

LMAO RKT puts values actually went up after it rose 2% in 5 mins

"anyone else Bull on RKT" bro look around you.
Just wait until tomorrow 🙌
guess ill sell RKT 27.5c

if it hits ill happily give away the fucking gay shares
Investing in Q3 just feels like waiting for one good tech pump while tumbling down every day
PLTR flatlined 🤣
Been fun being a bull, but I like blowing up my account .  

🐻
All it takes to win in this market is to have such a good week (like last week) putting you bigly into profit that you don't puss out on calls, if you just hold you fucking rocket launch back up after red days.
You aren’t alone!
45k in two days *and* about to get assigned weeklies for BABA @ 277, TAN @ 78.... 🤡🤡

You think mods would have fixed the daylight savings time bug with automod.
Can't wait for the guys at nikola to make the list without actually doing anything
It’s not baba, it you. 
You prob bought at market or ask price, which are very often are pretty inflated. I accidentally did that today too, instant -40%. Only use limit orders
fuck it jumping into RKT debit spreads as well! LETS GO RKT!!! blow out earnings!
If tomorrow doesnt open green i think you should sell
RKT for sho
I agree, I think it'll be a good play for you.
That initial run up was for stellar earnings report last week (11/3). A vaccine being announced literally a week later isn't fully priced in...yet.
Username checks out.
Imagine you'd feel right at home
Can’t trust these DOE’s
I picked up a 38c 12/18 on RKT before it launched for .20 lol Whatever happens, happens. Didn't want to miss out on this one

DEATH TO THE RKT BEARS
Excuse me i promised we would close on the lows today. Wtf
If Lyft drops 10% tonight it may cover for my massive baba losses
I just need NIO to go brrr for just one more day fukkk
it’ll tank after earnings 🙂
This is more like when the whistle already blew, and a player picks up the dropped football that was clearly an incomplete pass and pretends it was a fumble, then runs to the opposite endzone. That is to say, the play is already over.
Thoughts on holding 11/20 NIO calls?
Hot girls + high rise skirts $LULU
🚀 🚀 🚀
rkt lets go
Fomo into....?
the last real red day where close to close was red was oct 30 for spy.  We had a day last week that shows red but it was only down by .02%
Anyone else Bull on RKT, Bear on LMND?
I’m holding
I'd feel better about this RKT pump if it was closer to closing, no?
Praise be
i lost $300 today. I hate flat af days
If baba closes above $270 I’d be overjoyed with a -15% day
Stay grounded if you want, I'm going to mars mothafucka
Do I trust this RKT pump or will it just die and take the whole market with it like last time 🤔
You're reaching bud
No bought these beginning of September down 60%
Of course, I don’t know the exact tickers you have.
Tsla 420 eod book it retards
I have/had 20k in Baba. It's all shares and leaps so I'll hold tight.  Feels super bad today.  Wife told me to stop being a pussy and just hold it.
RKT takeoff! It’s happening!!!!
r/smallstreetbets
its up 2%. wtf are you on about
No. The run off they need to win is in Georgia. Conservative Georgia isn’t going to swing on weed legalization. 

The people of Georgia vote for their Senators. Not people in Denver and Seattle. 

You should take a polisci or civics course in your sophomore year of High School.
Anything that isn't WFH reliant, yessir. Solid tech buys are opening up where the index is forcing a selloff due to collapse of WFH shares. I anticipate a snap back on some of these.
I’ll suck your dick for free
They are actually expiring on the 20th
RKT going to break the sound barrier.
ROCKET GANG UNITE
RKT calls... hold or sell eod? My gut tells me to sell, the tingle in my balls tells me to hold.

ITS DIFFERENT THIS TIME OK
What do you think are the chances of bigly red futures tonight
Correct.
I don’t see the stock falling below 3,000 especially with big holidays coming up and winter.
I would say the same, if it wasnt for that god damn loch mess monster
Yes.
RKT to the moon and then center of the earth after the report. Except last time it was at like $37 or so not $22
Probably wouldn’t hold overnight man, does it seem like people want to sell right now in your honest opinion?
RKT keep going up you son of a bitch 🚀
As someone who just delt with Microsoft support I have a theory...
Sold RKT at $21.50 like a simp smh
any strategy is better than no strategy.
Bears looking at SPY: would you shut up, man?
None stop of mini pump and  dumps its maddening
RKT living up to its name rn
CALL MY NAME AND SAVE ME FROM THE SECTOR ROTATION
Tell me rkters are going to sell before earnibgs

RKT Puuuuuump
Just wait for it to go up nearly 100% over the course of 2 weeks then buy 

I guess someone always has to buy the top and hold bags
Some1 is pumping RKT!!! Go go! Just hit 25, so I can unload my bags!
Prayer works! praise the Lord he understands our tendie needs

UPVOTING ALL MY RKT RIDERS 🚀🚀🚀
must be the meeting about the next meeting
RKT 😍 🚀 😊
RKT shook off the unbelievers
RKT doing the opposite of what it did last earnings lmao
Because all the ~~pussies~~ paper hands are out and there is no bad news on the horizon for NIO, only an ER that we already know has beaten delivery expectations and gained more money to run operations through their ADS offering. I’d like to know why it wouldn’t rally
you mean pump
Hippity hoppity bags are my property
Fuk i got in at 3220 55k in calls. I hope to good this shits moves 3.5 by the end of the month
A fellow retard. I loaded 20 more PLTR 22c 11/20 and 10 more 22c 2/19/21. Also 5 more SNE 100 12/18

LETS GET FUCKED OR STAY PRINTING
The company is expanding, showing plans for even more outward expansions, and creating disruptive tech. Tell me how that will make a stock drop by 50%.
RKT. Were all gonna make it
Tesla back to 420 tomorro?
what the actual fuck is AAPL's price movement today. I hate that it's driving the indices
DO IT THEN BETCH
This is the wrong ship sir
Uh huuuuuuuh
Why the huge difference in XOM and CVX today?
no idea if i want to hold NIO calls overnight or not
RKT classic divergence with the volume and that giant leap. Im not brave enough to hold through tonight
this stock moves rapidly, and I think considering the huge sell off today and then recovery you might as well hold.
Sure. Support @ 107.16 & likely headed there. For a shot at anything meaningful long side, 125.40. TBH, that’s about it, lots wiggle room, nothing definitive in between those levels. Getting walloped lately, but nearing 2 standard deviations down on a still upward 3 month trend channel.
RKT is doing the thing?!
Same fate as the Challenger mission in 86
Rocket rocketing now but I would prefer if it stayed flat and rocketed ah. Now I’m afraid it will dump
NIO, NET, CRSR
RKT's drinking that jet fuel a little early..

RKT prayer circle worked🤣
Obviously not but it's overvalued

You bought the top like  me. I’m getting fucked by NIO too. It’s a love and hate relationship

I understand that all tech is getting hit, but how in the world is MSFT getting hit harder than other companies in the sector that saw much bigger gains from COVID?
Ccl fucked me. Should have known those clowns were up to no good
Who the fuck is RSI? You tell that asshole his days are numbered.
Totally an abusive relationship, but I am in it for life
And the 🚀 is taking off
Let me be very clear:Spy pump eod plz👉👈🥺
I read those reports too but it's not Pfizer's decision to make, it's the U.S govt and CDC's decision. And they've contracted McKesson to do the logistics and supply chain; similarly to how they contracted 100 million doses from Pfizer. Pfizer has to produce the vaccine, McKesson has to make sure it gets to the destinations. 

Maybe Pfizer can bid for logistics in other countries, but within the U.S, McKesson has the contract.
ARR for quick high yield dividend play for boomer accounts. It also may spike ex dividend day

Not sure but puts are on fucking discount! Get in while you can
It’s better to lose part of your capital on more realistic puts than all of your capital on autist puts.
So salty over a joke you dig through post history. Lmao
Well it’s either going to $6 or $600. Possibly both?  But which first 🤔
No need to buy them and all their bullshit. Amazon can beat them at this game.
If we all knew, then we’d be rich and wouldn’t need to be on this forum!

I’m hoping Lower cuz I have puts.  I think it might cuz tech has apparently been shit this week so that’s my guess but I’m retarded so it’ll probably be higher
Look to the charts my boy
Small cap value has been killing it both days, think we're seeing a change finally out of large growth
Dude this is the wrong ship
NIO calls dated for 11/20. Im hoping to come out of this with BIG gains.

I'm buying back in acb around 5-6
Interesting take. So what time frame do you see this share price increasing in? An increase as the vaccine is slowly implemented, or an increase after covid restrictions are mostly lifted and the vaccine is widely used? And maybe a harder question, do you see it reaching pre-covid share prices in that same time frame? In any case, thanks for the DD

RKT bears better off flushing the cash down the toilet. Chance it might clog and you get it back.
Apple is a buy at 110, MSFT near 200, Paypal around 180. Amd is good at 75ish. Intel is just random trash.

Most accurate DD of the past few weeks
How we close today is going to set the tone for the rest of the week. Gonna be interesting.
calls on dow transport, XPO logistics, CH robinson, basically any trucking company except YRC for obvious political reasons.  From December Through July they expect to transport hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines which require cold storage.  High end freight carriers are going through the roof and I don't think its too late if you pick decent names  XPO jan 15 110C, 	CHRW Jan 15 '21 $100 C

Can you give us like a week's notice before getting into AMD so we can plan accordingly?

Also, it had two events and earnings in october, did you expect it to keep running up after those were done?
Unless...
So I bought a 11/11 spy 340p yesterday EOD. Literally 3 seconds later they doubled in value....too bad I held to this morning and sold for 10% profit...
So does anyone have any plays like that for time right now?

Me too
If you want to sell shovel/pickaxe while everyone is prospecting for gold, get calls on $MCK now!!!

They have a partnership with the CDC and U.S. government to be the main distributor of COVID vaccines throughout the U.S. That, in itself is massive. But since the vaccine has to be transported and monitored at -77° F, I can see other European countries, along with Australia, Canada, contracting them for the same service. 

Get in now while IV is still low before it spikes

Nothing has changed. We all knew Trump was never going to concede if he lost, he said it himself, and the only people backing him up are the three people (Pompeo, Barr, McConnell) who have worked in lockstep with him for the entirety of this administration.

None of this is a surprise

I had 12/18 190 calls in July and sold at a loss when I got spooked. Worth 1k then, 3.6k now. I keep it on my watch list as a constant reminder of failure
wsb is too bullish on RKT, i'm out. Someone fill my 23C 11/13 at 1.02
but today isnt over....

Probably but we’ll see on Friday

E: not to belittle you but as I have the same positions you’re probably retarded
Looking through the earnings call again, it looks like they're *announcing* the AVOD service early December and then launching Q1 2021.

Good looking out!
wut happened
Mods
:F:
Not bearish engulfing. Today’s high didn’t beat yesterday’s highs
SNAP about to get smoked!?
IT is not about WARM. IT is about TIGHT
whats your position?
Yeah I might have bought the dip too early today
Hey Rajeev, good to see you around WSB
I don’t think they know how
I was tryna throw 20k in it when it was less than .39 now it’s going towards .45 I’m sick
Thoughts on NIO breaking back past $45 this week, or should I take these half losses, and just get out now?
Seeing every bet on RKT calls here makes me want to buy RKT puts
11/11 will make 9/2 look like child's play
glad i sold my RKT call, although it's mainly stayed flat.
300% =/= 1000%+ retard

Thank you to the guy in r/wallstreetbets (can not remember the name unfortunately), who yesterday suggested, after the drop in BYND, to get May leaps. GG. 

This community has quite a few great people!

what do we think on BA puts?
I'm still up. Don't make me buy more weeklies.
I thought I went full regard.. damn dude
When is NIO earnings?
Want to buy BABA, doubted decision 10 times, still not comfortable hitting buy
Put $1k into RKT earnings because I saw someone else do it on WSB in true autist fashion.
Yeah true. So where do you think it finishes today then?
tomorrow is VA day, MM's are on holiday so probably green
Come on board, we only have few spots left.

The annual event, also known as Singles Day, was forecast to generate around $45 billion in total sales, a near 20% increase from last year's record of $38 billion, as shoppers in key Asia-based economies splurge on tech and consumer goods following months of lockdowns linked to the global coronavirus pandemic.

Early updates from Alibaba's website, however, suggest the first 30 minutes have generated gross merchandise value of 372 billion Chinese yuan, or around $56.2 billion, a staggering total that dwarfs the record $10.4 billion spent during Amazon Inc.'s
Yeah its pretty fuckked

Glad I sold my QQQ positions yesterday when it started dipping.  Not sure what positions to take now though.  I feel like recovery stocks ballooned up in a day.  Don’t know if they keep going
Fucking hell ikr; let’s cry together?

But he was in political office for 47 years!
You mess with the RKT, you're gonna get burned.  


Calls or Puts, just stay away.
This fight for AAPL is so wild.
Yea most of the fags just come here to suck dick then go back to their wives boyfriends.
I have 40% in Baba. I feel the pain.
God these past two weeks honestly just prove that all of this is rigged.
Is BABA dead?  Bought January calls without seeing the news about Gyna.... Thought the dip was related to the vaccine
Looks like MOD lose all the money for the day and want to close market.
Fixed.

im down 200 today . I wasn't able to execute my order yesterday when I was up 150 😔 idk why it went down so bad. I hope it goes to 46 before Friday
Today was about as sideways and gay as you can get.
The first to do it gets the rewards and the glory; everyone else who replicates will probably be successful, but not on same scale.  We have second place for a reason.  I'm guessing you meant "EOY" but I hope you didn't blow your load on Dec $100c...
Are they going to keep climbing?
The tech bull is an endangered animal. Only a handful left in this planet. Tech bulls life matter!😂😂

Super easy! Just prograde thrust when you are at perigee once your apogee is at the interception angle. Accelerate until you raise your apogee to just barely over the moon. If your launch window had some excess inclination, a wee mid course correction burn radial opposite to that inclination, then just accelerate retrograde once you are at lunar periapsis until you have a nice round orbit.

I guess from the point of view of the travelers it's just short bursts of forward acceleration and long periods of weightlessness. And I'm long on weightlessness, can't go tits up!
Look at the stock pattern. It’s just that simple sometimes.
Imagine me setting that baba buy limit at 285 yesterday
I sleep
Yea I have a feeling it’ll pop. I’m tryna get out today around breakeven

I believe the rideshare companies burn a ton a of cash in payroll alone and advertising. The only thing saving Uber is Uber Eats. Shorting Lyft doesn't sound like too crazy of an idea makes sense. It is 2020 though.

I got banned there for making negative comments about Nikola, in *this* sub.
Downvote all you want but I am having TSLA Battery Day/ER PTSD seeing all those "NIO up bigly after ER" comments.
I’m sorry dude, worst yet is that amd only has good news
Me: BABA can’t go lower than this


BABA: you silly bitch
Once they get the key people though the rate and deadliness should drop off pretty quickly.

Shit I won't recommend to anyone ever: MSFT, AAPL, INTC, AMD.
CRY

what's with Veterans Day?
The bot, like all of us, is pretending today didn’t exist.
You are probably right, what I meant is that we can’t know when the correction will happen, it might be in one year... It might be slow, it might not
Basically
[removed]
I shorted them...It's hard to imagine they don't tank earnings (add to that, the recent run up), but you never know.
TSLA and NIO with the near identical 1D charts
no
Joe and Kam making the market Moon! Keep buying. NIO, ACB, HYLN all good investments, lots of calls.
Putin is basically a Manchurian candidate that Russia has probably groomed from extremely early on. Came out of what was essentially the Russian CIA to lead Russia to get back to its former glory type thing.

Man bombed his own people to ass rape Chechnya. 

His whole life is that Churchill quote about Russia a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in an enigma.

Edit-- Minus the fact that the Manchurian was an infiltrator.
how's the casino going?
That was after earnings had already been released
I call this poem "RKT Gonna"

So the consensus is RKT calls for earnings? Am I ready to get burned again? Or am I ready to buy puts and still get burned but feel twice as dumb?
When should we sell?
I just made like 4k on GE over the past two weeks.... But! I also have 300 share of TQQQ that I sell FDs on.
Yay
Bot is drunk
Mods plz. It's been 9 days since the end of daylight savings.
Retard mods still haven’t fixed the daily
I know there's a lot of you that are glad that NIOs fucked but I may have to commit sudoku tomorrow.
The stock market in general has been very forward looking. No one thinks that people will be flocking back to the theme parks for another year, but it's pricing in that. It's still below last year's high, pre-covid. So the expectation is that at the price now, it's still going to take time to get revenue back to the levels as the expectations back last year, despite the vaccine news \*and\* the implementations on the Disney+ side.
lol, and just like that the sub flips on PLTR
I'm down 150 bucks just on PLTR shares today, what a shit fest.  Whatever.  Sell another weekly.

Fucking $88 calls expiring friday, fml
i'll definitely need a rum and something
Held all day for just 20% profit, finally sold. Just have a leap on the off chance it moons, but I was very sad
Not necessarily. Options buying causes MM’s to buy underlying stock to hedge. More options traders means more hedging with buying which means bigger movement both directions. This can be the start of a new kind of market.
Holding RKT until I cum in my pants from No Nut November
CVS has only been going up the last week.

Get 2021 calls, and enjoy the gains.
Ok just bought the 3100c

Why

Buyden is the president elect. 🥭 is just delusional and unable to be an adult.
I’m in puts just in case y’all were wondering why bears r fuk
Buy GE calls I guess er something
Surely a coup cannot be bullish. Take off your retard helmet SPY and bend the knee to your bear overlords.
how far out you getting pooots? very tempted...
I have this really nice grill mix that has some herbs and spices in it too and it even made my shoes taste decent
Uhhhhh.... Someone sold too early.
Everyone thinks its gonna dump. Buying those .2 cent SPY calls when it blows past resistance
Lmao u think RKT premiums r cheap? Ur dumb
>I got a wine playdate with the big tatty, Muslim chick tonight. Than tomorrow I got this fat ass ass. I love how everyone just poly in cali.

Try an English teach next holy fuk
Sure. But again, AAPL is such a big percentage of SPY/QQQ/DOW they cannot let it go. It will tank everything. So it’s a matter of whatever happens or how crappy new products are or can’t find enough chips for phones, etc. The FED & institutional firms cannot let it die.
You were asleep for 2 days?

there was also a bottle of teslaquila in an old solar home picture as noted in this tweet ( [https://twitter.com/teslaownerssv/status/1325862050401153025?s=20](https://twitter.com/teslaownerssv/status/1325862050401153025?s=20)) 

Here is a tweet from 8/20/20 which i think may have some clues in it. s&p inclusion seems fairly obvious but it didnt happen right away. any big brain niggaz in here see anything at all?

NIO I’ve been patient with you please pump
It's 783K USD retard. So yeah, 78.3M pennies to be exact
https://youtu.be/4LfJnj66HVQ
Hmm didn't even consider that.  The socialized health care package will be very good for all the medical companies so that's probably a safe play.

SO: RXT & TXR = UP; RKT = DOWN
Amd amd amd
aapl still green.. bruh baba down 8%, amzn and msft 3.5% . stop playing aapl and fall
honestly wanna get puts haha
I sold half of my positions. Too risky
thats where the tech money is going
Damn these rocket premiums are dirt cheap. Do I buy puts or calls tho 🤔
I'm giving APPS one more day.  Probably selling out around an 80% loss tmr at close.  Oh well, better than selling out for zero.
im sure some retards fomo'ed into NIO weeklies yesterday too
This stock isn't moving any way but straight right. Could veer a little left, but you have to be either Jesus or retarded to think it's falling.
Up .88% baby. Free Arizona ice teas on me
Exactly!
Warehousing and bulk sales. Imagine skipping the last mile in distribution whilst selling higher quantity per head. The way the shelving etc. work means that they need relatively few personnel. 

I’m pretty frugal and calculated all my prices per on for every sort of grocery in the area. For staples, Costco is the cheapest with no comparison. They mix those with premium items at decent prices so you come in just to buy the cheap stuff, but you come out with a shit ton of premium shit. 

Their return/warranty policy is also fucking amazing. I will eat a premium for certain stuff I know I could return if the it craps out in an unreasonably short amount of time. You don’t have to deal with all that RMA bullshit.
BABA calls seem safe
snip-snap, snip-snap, snip-snap. Do you have any idea the mental toll 3 vasectomies has on a man!
Yes. Red tomorrow. Green Thursday.
Could you tell me what was going on in your mind when you decided to buy near all time highs?

Bought AMD calls when it dipped a little this morning. Went up 15% then went down 25% fml
My first big loss was on rkt last earnings. I have not learned anything and am here again for round 2. Sket it.
I know, but if you look where they were at this morning and where the IV and stock is heading into earnings, I want to buy cheap puts because I assume it is going to miss earnings.

Am I retarded? YES! Will tendies print, highly unikely! I might go all in here

Congrats on your win man. My buy signal would've been yesterday at break down below 573 which is right where I have my trendline and a resistance, but I was watching SPY yesterday. Ended up not even buying in at my buy signal at the break down below 361. It hit 600%ish at the low today...

I keep telling myself to buy in with a stop loss when the signals are there but after a loooong series of YOLO losses, I'm having trouble pulling the trigger even though I'm actually following my TA now lol
Is this *THE BIG RED?*

Big dip but 38.60 defended, recovered back above 40 gives a solid base for the bounce.  Should see continued trajectory along the trend line.

Yeah, who knows?  Maybe they'll announce that the vaccine is actually 100% effective, and it's actually ready right now, and "Look under your seat..!"

Massive BA dump coming within the next few days. You retards buying calls after 25% move in 4 sessions are retarded.
You gonna make it bruddah
Only some lottos in either direction. I wouldn’t put big money of this thing
What's the specific bear case?
Great wall of 36K shares to be sold if RKT goes to 21.76. that's not very bullish 🤔
Wait til you see the bull spam tomorrow
The 20 year chart is even wilder. It literally did nothing for like a decade
I AM DOWN BIGLY.  MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT.  SAD.
Sheesh SE just can’t catch a break. What do these insiders know?
Can we all donate $1 to get u/GovSchwarzenegger to say POWA HOWRA
Consolidating above the 352 level is best case Ontario for bulls
Simply this. Consumer discretionary stonks can’t go up if everyone is all in tech. It’s a scale that has been overweight tech. Tech is still great, the scale must come back into balance. Don’t try to fight it.
I’ve been waiting for a trend upward again. And there just isn’t one lol
Yup all of them
Sold 18 rockets puts that expire this Friday smart or dumb?

Knee oh
Everyone talking about rkt, thank god we are over nio.
Shall I buy an AMZN call?
The nastiest pump of all time is coming
RKT🚀
Mmm. I don't see any reason why the stock should go up to be honest. In fact, I'm worried that there are more reasons it should go down. High covid case reporting, increased deaths, threat of another lockdown, President won't leave the office -- all bad reasons.
I bought CF calls

Look at AAPL if you want to see some coiling
Hi skellington.
Or red candles just to tease you AH 

None of these FD’s are green too AH
Used a day trade on pretty much nothing. At least I don’t have to deal with theta. This market sucks and I hope it craters soon so we can get some real action.
you gotta fall down to get back up
Free money
INTC to call or put?

DD: LMND not fake meat
i've never held through earnings but my position is so small, fuck it
Play the theta. This company insures homes. We didn't see many homes get destroyed this year. It's pretty much expected to be a decent earning, so no price in.
We’re going to dump aren’t we 🤡
Boycott europe they are fuking with my amazon calls !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm with you man.
Interesting baba down today also. Both of them will go back up to normal range just depends on when lol.

nice whipper
The 5 year chart on MSFT is just wild.  Slow gainer and then in March until now it starts trading like a penny stock on a week to week basis.
I mean PTON had a catalyst and was trending in America on Twitter so...
I didn't stop answering questions, all you did was start making stupid statements. They're not arguments, so I'm not going to treat them like one. 

Yes, that's what it was. The dollars were redeemable for gold, and there are examples in that video I sent you. They didn't say "$20 note", they said "note redeemable for $20" and were issued by private banks. JP Morgan would have a central vault with a pile of gold that could be redeemed. The accounting between banks was in ledgers, and they would exchange gold as needed. Some of this transaction was still happening in international trade, where at one point the federal govt banned the export of gold to foreign treasuries. 

The mid-1970s wasn't on a gold standard (and hadn't been for decades), and the entire economy tanked into a recession with stagflation.

Once again, you're not reading or taking the time to attempt to understand what I'm telling you. The printing of money, and the increase in the money supply does not come with a commensurate increase in generated value. So just printing money doesn't create value - something must be produced for value creation to happen, which is why paying someone for non-value-added work is a net loss to the economy. Yes, it moves cash through hands, and the govt will tax it, but it didn't generate a productivity increase or a new product or service. 

The reason a commodity as money is valuable is because the item itself has value and is otherwise useful as something else. It also just happens to be an accepted mode of exchange. Money wasn't created by governments; historically, it's like a language - people agree over time that a specific good (or goods) are accepted in exchange because they're widely desired and accepted.

RKT earnings
what’s tonight’s ah market gonna look like?
The last rkt earnings was a classic pump and dump. Everyone sold 15 minutes before close. Not saying that will happen, but be careful.
lmao fuk eurpe. I am officially boycotting europe
12/18 21s checking in
buying puts is shorting too. You probably mean short selling, which is just another way of shorting like selling calls, buying puts or using CFDs to short
[deleted]
NIO or PLTR
Rkt is probably gona beat earnings, proceed to tank 10-15% then rally next week.
AAPL didnt plummet after their event.. yea imma hold RKT calls till after earnings
Wait till Thursday. Tomorrow is gonna be red.

• A startup that had to issue a nationwide recall of 20% of their 2019 products because the cars batteries spontaneously combust.

• A startup that is caught in the middle of a geopolitical trade war between two global super powers that hate each other.

• A startup that is losing 10 billion per year on 500 million of revenue.

• A startup that is currently valued to be worth more than Ford, GM, Hyundai, Ferrari, etc.

Dang, that's a brutal hit you took from AMD calls.  
In that case I hope you can recover from it tonight.

I like the fact that we're below average volume and flat after the open dip.

I remember buying 6c 7/17 calls on IVR back on June 8th and watched them sit in my account for over a month being worthless at 0.01 and that feeling of seeing them gone finally felt better than money.

Dunno, it's still at lows from Covid. Might go back to slow creep up. Maybe one more pump today.
5 minutes. Here we go boys and maybe 2 girls that waste their time in the discussion thread
Rallied 17%+ on “vaccine news”. Sure it already gave back 3% but still coming from somebody who lives in Florida people aren’t rushing to go to the parks even with Food and Wine Fest going on and the revenue from Disney+ won’t make up for that lost park revenue. Granted yes earnings run-up on the 12th makes sense so you’re definitely right on that account.

You mean a massively overvalued company saw a slight price decline while companies with P/Es a fraction of AMZN with larger revenue, margins, net income have a slight price increase?

Yes that actually does make sense.
Why not get a closer to strike price call option.... this makes no sense
Also there's been a lot of talk that people might not want to go back to the old ways. A substantial amount of workers want to continue working remotely or at least partly remote. Some survey also discovered people don't want to go back to their old travel routines even if a vaccine is discovered.

Mac long term future is great if Apple Silicon is really that fast.
Yes, but you can say “that was idiotic” in today’s society without backlash, but saying “that was retarded” won’t fly in a lot of places.

I’m thinking it’s more because the word retard has been used medically not too long ago so the sensitivity is still there.

Hold until earnings. I’ve got 2 NIO 50c 11/27 and 4 NIO 37p 11/13 that I sold last Friday. On Friday I’ll probably take profit on one call and gamble the other. Buy out my NIO puts and resell @ 20 delta for 11/20 to get that thick ER premium. Sell my call after ER and hope it spikes because I’m getting banned if NIO closes red 11/18. Then not touch NIO for a while if ER is a huge moon and let it settle down
I spent months being a broke bear. I ain’t goin back to that life, ya hear me!!

The meaning behind idiot, moron, and imbecile hasn’t changed? It still means something or someone being dumb right? Yet we as a society view those words as way less harsh than saying retard. 

It’s more the word being a recently castaway medical term than anything imo; I think in due time society might open up to it, or it will remain the powerhouse of the word it is today because these days we aren’t using one word to describe mentally impaired people and instead are using larger phrases that mean the same thing, but just don’t have that kick of one word like retard (saying mentally impaired).
If not, maybe the quadruple topnwipl be the one

Y’all think Baba will go up with the Singles Day Sales ?
Just got spy puts its going to moon now yw
Yeah that literally means nothing for the fact that most people were going to get an iPhone 12 anyhow and that’s just a stock color that people ended up liking more than the others. Not to mention they all cost the exact same and there’s not really much of a difference to compare in terms of design.. Nobody is going to pay extra for a collab design especially since majority of people end up going with black or white regardless. I still remember the rose gold hype, and it turns out later down the line rose gold ended up being one of the least picked up colors..
I know man.  I am really struggling being a bull but I'm up like 1000% since I decided to inverse myself.  Be willing to be open to always being wrong its cathartic.
Today?

haha!
That stock is so volatile. Bought it early this year right before lock downs at $94 and sold at $124. I couldn’t stand the uncertainty. They would delay financial reporting and you just didn’t know wtf. Until they just reported and wasn’t even close to expectations. I don’t know who eats the fake meat but see it all over in the stores. I guess they can feed it to the fishes
holy shit bulls and bears really battling it out here
algos arent psychoanalysts yo

It’s gonna run to 40-45 range.
Are you really that desperate to perceive this as bullish?

I think women would be really turned on by my risk tolerance if they understood just how retarded some of my trades are.
So you are expecting the stock to gap up tomorrow after ER.  That is a bold fucking position.  God speed and please put on your helmet.

I asked my mcdonalds cashier this morning if he knew when they were getting mcplant and he dead ass thought I was making fun of him.
Hey I got all these today, including ACB. If it’s 25% down then it must be a good thing to gamble on 😁🤣🤪
We are not dumping today.
That's why I keep YOLOing duh.
Yessir
software will dump hard, AAPL is safe until next results
I’m a little fucked. Mine expires 11/13
If you take a look at IWM, banks, airlines all these “value” covid rebound names aren’t that far from ATH honestly. Everytime these rotations happens and tech dips, tech just inevitably rallies even harder later on. As it rightfully should.

Im never buying a put in my life again, thats what got me here in the first place
Nomura analysis-- Historically, after a multi-standard deviation drop in momentum stocks (yesterday), markets tend to go down in a choppy manner over the short to intermediate term (the kang gang bullshit market we had today is going to end down and we will probably keep going down like this for a while)
Stay hedged
Lyft puts 33 11/20 if you like money
Can all this happen b4 my Nov 20th expiration please
the three day trend on nasdaq is down, is this a buy?
I'm with you on this one 15 contracts 11/20 $31 strike, .2 per so about $325 gamble after fees. Hope it prints, majority of tech stocks have been getting wrecked lately, rkt up slightly today, see what happens at 430!!
Lets get that bread. Gonna sprinkle a little on RKT earnings too.  Not much tho
JPow/LFink can’t allow it. I will tank the whole market.
Of course man.  Its hurting right now, but its been painful before on the way up from $4.  Serious turnaround story - they're making consistent improvements to their website and order volume is pretty substantial (as seen by order number changes between orders placed a few minutes/days apart).  Console season makes this basically like a christmas tree lot in november, but where this year for the first time, all sales of one type of christmas tree will pay you monthly dividends (MSFT) for years to come.

Estimates are that in console sales alone (not peripherals or games etc.) they will do 1.1 billion in console sales by the end of january.  Thats almost 1/4th of their 2019 total year's sales.

&#x200B;

I'd love to see an epic short squeeze, but I'm playing this for its long term potential, not for the squeeze.  Most of my money at this stage is in jan/april calls and shares

BABA calls or suck my balls

Sub 350 by close
actually probably not.
Time Decay. Think of them as a bomb. Time is the fuse.
Volatility. More people trade during that time. It will increase again towards the end of the day.
The IV will not increase if the stock rises. The IV is high due to the binary event; would also increase on a big drop

It has exceeded 230, it was purchased by a fkton of ethical vegans on the sole basis that it was vegan, and it dropped when they lost a contract with Carl's Jr franchise locations but said contract was promptly replaced with larger ones with MCD and YUM/pizza hut.
Why
👐
Step 1.) Vaccine news is announced

Step 2.) Tech tumbles from vaccines news since it no longer needs to be the safe spot to store your money during the pandemic **<---we are here**

Step 3.) Vaccine news fades from memory, record COVID headlines appear again

Step 4.) Tech skyrockets again
AAPL what in the absolute fuck are you on right now?
Die nio
Do you even jelq bro?

What have been your wildest swing? Going from super negative to positive or vice versa.
lets not start sucking each others dicks yet with the vaccine news, nothing will happen in 6 months, wfh will dominate and then maybe, only maybe with the facts supporting the hype that vaccines indeed work and population getting vaccinated quick enough - we will see a new trend starting in energy and maybe even airlines and cruises and the rest if they will be still there
Yes.
What is?
What’s a buy rn
For what stock
$15K invested at $294.... Thought... like amazon this should go up right?
So is war with Iran back on the table?
Fuck me
No doubt about it. But the IV on Pfizer is pretty relative in terms of movement.
AH
I’m like damn ashy Larry from the Chappelle show.
Reeeee
That should have been all you needed to know
A lot of Y’all really don’t understand trends, TA, or other markets. So many people in this thread saying “why are we down?” Or “what caused the dip?”. 

I’ve been telling people to hedge, or take profits, or better yet buy puts. Because what’s happening right now makes sense to me. Credit market is falling, millions of foreclosures/mortgage defaults looming, QE gives banks reserve cash to lend against but they aren’t lending thus drying up liquidity, the dollar is going to experience deflation until we get more stimulus, interest rates at all time lows. Not to mention that the current equity market is showing all the hallmarks of a bubble. I mean fuck I even anticipated that we would rise after the election, that still fit within my outlook. And I’m not typing this to make it seem like I know exactly how the market will move because I don’t, but long term trends are relatively easy to predict when you look into all the available information. 

We will likely retest 320 before December. Whether we keep going lower or bounce up I don’t know. But please stop chasing 3-day trends and then freakout when a predictable reversal happens.
Cause that’s mangos legacy, a weak stock market
Down 64k ytd. I give zero fucks about bidens tax plan :)

That's why the media called it a "rotation" else it would have been "tumble under uncertainty"
I'm bag holding TQQQ shares but I'm pretty confident we'll retest the high again. QQQ bouncing off the 50 daily moving average.

My first ever options play was RLT's first ER last quarter and we all got fucked. GL mate, I won't be touching that one with a 10 foot pole
and I think that's the most important thing to realize that there is zero consistency there's zero direction there's zero people know what's going on everything is up in the air the market does not like uncertainty we have far too many zombie companies that have so much market capitalization with zero profit     can't live forever like that

You idiots downvoted me on monday when I told everyone to buy ACB puts
Do you retards playing RKT realize that IV is so high that to even make a double up it would have to open up ~11.5% higher
Uncertain. Chinese government is extremely powerful in modulating the economy and until they make it clear what they're going to do I'm out of BABA.
Who’s holding Disney through earnings?
with 90 minutes left MSFT reached its daily volume... big guys are exiting / trimming big tech
Sour hour
i can use some of that organic massive growth right about now
Its oversold as fuck. Not sure why, but I don't care. All I know is that singles day numbers will send it to the fucking moon in the next week or two
BYND straight printed today. Glad I got out when I did though.
I made 800% on Nkla before losing it all on SPCE
I’m holding.  It’s either going to 25+ or 18.
Nice, thanks for the link dude 👍
Fingers cross for you two, really hoping these earning get my 22c into tendy land
To be honest I hope its a pump but I feel like you are right.
I love that my iPhone screentime counts Robinhood as “Productivity and Finance” it really makes me feel better about it
Did those affect NIO?
Tesla is so fucked
My gay bear ass gonna take its usual pounding here ain’t it, just can’t wait today
if Visa keeps this up I will be a very very very happy man
tesla is doing that thing again
The direction you’re going
I hope it tanks after earnings so I can buy cheap leaps. But good luck to those of you playing earnings---you have balls much bigger than mine. Godspeed!
Was literally down to my last $50. Here you go. 

Tendies https://imgur.com/gallery/2ffq14X

It's at 1,700% now
Maybe buy and hold shares but there are certainly better uses for your money.
I know Pfizer never moves but when FDA clears this and countries starts with their hundreds of millions of orders it will move to atleast $45. Pipe dream is like $60+ which isnt out of the realm of possibilities
Isn't it selloff hour?
But Robinhood type trades? Lol 😬🤣
This feels like the opposite of a dump about to happen....   a reverse dump?
Yeah same, this flat movement is killing my calls. What position you holding?
I think it might be smart this time bc there was no Pre-earnings run up.
Bought puts on the mouse because I hate money
They don't put them in front of the camera anymore
Nice play man!  The worst is holding on and losing all the gains + some
Loaded up on 270 1/15/21 calls. Hope you're right!
VIX is still low, this is fake and gay, the rally resumes tomorrow
So thankful I jumped off that ship this afternoon at break even. I don’t even care if it moons.
So I still have a chance between market open and market close?
No one, because this isn't a dip
Man just my luck, sold SNAP 37p at a loss yesterday because I thought that the downwards trend would definitely not continue - would have made a gain if I'd held on for one more day. That's just the way of the road I guess
[deleted]
There’s plenty of evidence, you’re biased and consume msm talking points. It’s okay I get it, please just don’t be a savage and burn your local business when this gets overturned
Dude it’s python, why don’t you just use “*import profit*”
🙋‍♂️
yeee I'll keep an eye on this as well, might even get earlier just so its cheaper but for 100, def a safe bet its VERY VERY likely we either get stimulus or vaccine news pump before then
Racist
Whoooo RKT GANG ALL 2021
Wanted to buy calls on $BABA but they were too expensive, so I just bought double the amount of calls on $BA.  Worked out much better.
12/18 $50c bitches
Roger that Narrow Cup
So you bet all the money that you have on a damn near impossible long shot?
I’m getting the feeling we’re ab to get lynched
Black sheep have you any wool
I get you, but I'm just gonna go with fundamentals, this can't go tits up. But with this rigged ass market, you never know
I did, u?
the event never fucking matters. stock historically always falls on selling the news. everyone knew today was apple silicon.
Explain I’ve only seen live cats
I have no clue where to turn to atm
I remember the days when a nice normal doggy style between two unrelated individuals that were roughly the same age would deliver excellent highs. That world doesn't exist anymore, the sooner you accept it the better.
Bruh what a bunch of retards
Maybe he posted it in r/smallstreetbets
Who’s holding rkt thru earnings?
who bought the BABA dip?
Power hour better not be gay
No one posts that kind of valuable DD anymore!
TSLA LOOKIN LIKE GOIN 420

BUT WHEN
If the legistlation China is preparing passes Alibaba is gonna get fucked way harder than any of our portfolios
There is no conspiracy. The markets are being retarded because they always have and because people with more money than you are fucking you every day between market close and market open.

Wow BYND 126 resistance so damn strong
This isn’t a Robinhood chart >:0
What’s wrong with BABA?
Why is HEAR a banned ticker?
ban
😳
How ironic lol I can’t understand a word you just wrote
It's one of my best ticker in last 6 months. Try not to buy in at the top, then the news will hurt you less. It just acts accordingly to the impact of news imo.
God speed.

The people Shilling RKT are the same ones that has been bagholding since Sept 2nd trying to offload them onto you. Play earnings at your own risk
Very convincing.
[deleted]
Man fuck this stock market; covid vaccine gets announced and all my gains go poof. Looks like I'm gonna be bagholding tsla, logi, se, and qqqj for years. Nvda put spread 460/450 might expire itm

I will add one more thing. The only reason I see dipping is just purely market appetite. 50% or more of this market is ran emotionally in some way or form.

Grug no cry. Grug be okay. Grug have many friend in same hut.
you can use risk profile but it doesn't factor in IV crush
They wanna tank the markets so trumps gains are erased
average down man. I'm at 700 shares at a cost of $1.83 after buying some at like $8
Do it.
Possiblt
I was thinking the same thing, but Guidance for RKT is supposedly really good, and thats all the market cares about this go around for earnings, also supposedly are going to tripple expectations
I had to make sure my dad was okay with it
Printer go brrrr?
what are some 'guaranteed' long term calls? say mid 2021.

I'll see you on the moon son.
Depends
I sold them and got into more 12/18 40c and 42c. Still made a profit on them, but miffed that I didn't sell when they were a 100% gain, instead got like a 60 or 70% gain out of them. The IV crush is real.
I thought we're drilling some more :/
Im doing the exact same with Baba 300 12/18
that's normal
yep, last time I sold on the run up before earnings but no run up this time so i’ll jus hold and hope. They gonna have a big beat but this market been stupid.
JPow/LFink need it, so...yes.
I miss those days.
Alright RKT, let’s go to $22 😎
The fuck is this price action, lol

These index chart straight retarded today
Its gonna happen this time though. I am honestly expecting around an 8-10% jump. Nothing TOO crazy but theyll beat and offer decent guidance
If it makes you feel any better I bought at 39 today so at least one of us is doing well

all my brothers holding RKT through earnings, we’re starting a frat

I feel like we are either consolidating on the spy chart for a large dump or pump in the last hour....can't figure out which we we will go....
NIO pushing boundaries 🤡
BABA calls
Kind of. I pay attention to charts and support levels and stuff like that but never lines. Like I’m not tracking the moving day average and shit like that
bideno talking is so strange to hear conhernet sinences
I got 2k I'm gonna all in OTM where to?
Die Snap Die
Strangle RKT for earnings
honestly bro, i think you should take your money and run from AZN. All the vaccine experts are all stoked on PFE since it has a 90 percent success rate at immunity.   


Considering we are going to have a massive titty fucking in death in the upcoming weeks it looks like we will be rollin in the Pfizer play.
We’re changing the senate.. bullish
EOD dump for sure
Holy shit your 6 year old is killing it.
Ba dip is sexy
[removed]
Spy 359 eod?
[removed]
Shares smarter play
Why is BABA getting clapped so hard today??  
I figure they would hold $280 at a minimum after Biden won...
Just bad timing. 

Still holding?
APPL Puts? What is that?
IVR of new isn’t the IVR of old. Feel you there. Lost a lot on that one.
Definitely not the nations worse pandemic lol wth
aapl is the only green on my watchlist. makes no sense
[deleted]
🤣😆🤣😆🤣🤣🤣
I’ll give u my “lucky” touch
I’m getting out of RKT by EOD.  This sub’s too bullish which is a bad sign
Cmon man, that’s like constantly bringing up someone’s dead parents
Fuckyeahpumpit.meme
I've been holding that bag for years now.... Only need another $6 or so to break even. 😞
y'all holding your NIO/PLTR weeklies or nah
Anyone else in BLUE or BIIB?
I won on BA calls overnight.
$BYND 130c
always
Well guys, i just yolo’d my entire account into 11/13 RKT 28c. Its been a fun run since March, but this is it.
I just want some action
All in on RKT earnings💎
AAPL trying so hard to stay green. Everyone knows its going to dump by EOD
Look at the premiums. You cant get shit for 130.
One of JPow's signature pumps right now would hit the spot.
Diamond hands here.   Just came from NJ county test site.   at least 100 people in line with me -- they probably tested 1000 today so far.   High school and grammar school just closed this week.   We are back in it.  Tech calls.  No one is shopping in a mall this christmas.  Kids are stuck in with their playstations, xbox.
is tesla trading paused?
RKT 24C
upvote RKT while you're at it, we need it
theta gang always wins
They could and they should if they really give a shit about our environment lasting.
To Valhalla brother
Apple ruining and saving the market every 60 seconds
All of these look just awesome, and you’ll be collecting 1000% shortly
I need a 10 bagger play tomorrow ready go?
I highly doubt it will dip below IPO. All fundamentals say it’s impossible. The profit They make per share and the market cap are just laughable for how valuable this company actually is. IMO
Thanks man, I’m in.
This is the play with 265 holding
BABA calls
Wait for the dead cat bounce bruv slight early
I kinda wanna get RKT puts and inverse all of you because thats how this seems to work.
Even better idea, how about I charge you $500 for looking at this DD porn.

SPY's chart is AIDS
That’s so crazy to me
Yea. Lost basically my entire call on those fucks AAL. While Boeing shoots for the stars FML
Timbo got hoes
since  your spamming this shit in here i think its time to buy calls
Are you holding?
I tried that yesterday and lost my shirt
That's cool and all, now stop buying zoom so my puts can print.
Pumppppppp it
Someone gave me a successful overnight play yesterday. Let’s see if we can do it again. What ya got?
I bought monthlies
How long should i hold these aapl puts
Pick a fucking direction.
Lol but you do believe in lines

I suggest a testosterone booster shot
Lawsuit dismissed, still hasn't reach pre-Covid numbers so lots of room to get back up. Probably gonna creep up eventually.
How is it not a big pointer? That's literally what their business is built for. For WA or not. They run 17 years in secret with government so it safe to assume they run on government money through contracts. The fact that Thiel is trump supporter and biden won didn't change the price of pltr give me the idea this shit gonna moon after earning

But then again I'm a retard. With that said, a retard bet 22C 11/20 and 2/19/21. Got me a retard yolo and a safe call.
god damn it nio
Paper hands
CARR??
That means you feel ALIVE
Airline plays will be juicy at christmas, gotta play the long game on them if it dies this week.
I agree with this sentiment. In fact I’ll bet $50 against all of the circlejerk calls
going to buy 11/13 $20 calls, like 4
Yes anti-trust stuff today. I’ve been in it on and off since May and it seems to always have some headwinds: delisting talk multiple times, Ant IPO suspension, now anti-trust
I like to upvote people with BABA calls. I feel like it will somehow pump up the stock. I’m retarded aren’t I?
RKT earnings LEggo! lol

It’s for people who can claim to travel but they’re just gluttonous fatties pigging out on institutional buffet garbage food for a week and lay around a tiny room
No, they believe in dividends and growth. This is options.
NIO wtf
Buy the Dip !!! F@g90t !!!!
IV is so high that it would have to go up roughly ~11% after hours to make 100%
lol same
Thoughts on APHA? Pulling out of ACB soon as I can.

Looks like spy gonna close at 0% move.

Yolo everything way out of the money, diamond hands, and show us that loss porn. Getting stiff just thinking about the possibility of someone being that legendarily retarded
This is the way
That's what I was thinking man, this market is too manipulated to make reasonable decisions, but will it fall below it's IPO?

Yes sir, yes sir, 3 heavy bags for this fool.

i feel like everyone saw it coming from at least 6 months in advance and its a nothingburger
[removed]
Has anyone done the DD? Honest question... cause I’m curious to know if pltr execs and internals are allowed to sell more of their shares yet ...

And to think, just cause it’s gained popularity for shares to increase... doesn’t mean they’ll finally make profit after over 10+ years of not being able to.

Edit: holding shares while selling CC’s to you guys 🤷🏻‍♂️
lol and I thought my gambling addiction was bad
They will be back 🐂
I’m so deep in RKT I could throw up rn
This is a pretty stressful flat day
Puts are LITERALLY FREE MONEY RIGHT NOW LOLOLOLOLOL
Really glad they pulled the BioNtech CEO for this, dude couldn't make out what he wanted to say anyways. Kept stumbling on the questions, like damn get him off the air. Helicopter Joe coming on

Told them weeks ago to buy RTX. Too much hype for NIO and AAPL.
Pump baba PUMP
wow that's like going back to June 1st
Should be a massive blowout. Stocks way undervalued. Then again this markets the weirdest market In History.
Down $2900 on the week if that makes you feel better lol
It's best
Fuck this I'm gonna diamond hand tech. 

Rona spiking everywhere and it's not even proper winter yet. And you think ZM is done.
If you’re worried about your tech calls just remember some retards on the dark pool are buying up millions worth of shares
God I am such a pussy, I can't bring myself to buy calls right now because I think we are going to stay flat through end of the week...

So I sold a $260p Nov 20 on BABA because if it hits I am fine holding 100 shares for a while...
It was big in this sub months ago, let a lot of folks down. Now is not months ago. Pick it up.
[deleted]
remember when ppl were trading based on where a gecko shit or ate something or not in its tank
huge liquidation by big players, look at MSFT
Holding that shit. It'll hurt if you jump off now but I think the sell off was a little harder than deserved. Calls expire 12/4 so I'm in it for at least another week or so

bois what are you looking at for the inevitable recovery?

I was poor for a few month and that I have disposable income again are industrial ETFs seem fully recovered
VSTM is up 11% today

I posted yesterday that it was good and I hoped y'all went in

I think it is gonna pop soon, at least go to $2.
NIO drop has nothing to do with the stock. Look at TSLA. Just market noise.
Yeah man. First last minute IPO suspension, now this.

I'm really mulling selling $BABA. At this point I feel like the fact that the CCP is erratic will always affect $BABA's valuation. 

They did crazy sales already on this 3 day singles day, but the market doesn't seem to care. Some people just wanna dip out. 

Oh!well..let's hope this is the botton
People quickly forget
He’s literally the stonk master wizard 🧙‍♂️you on the other hand are a stonk novice. So now, bow down to your superior.
Has the rug pull begun yet or is that gonna happen in after hours, futures, AND pre market?
In my own experience I have realized you lose 95% of options you think are really a 50/50 you need to make sure the position your taking is gonna be 80% right at the least before you yolo it’s recommend to be 90% positive maybe even 95% never play the 50/50s
It worked tho
sooooo is the literal coup announcement going to send us bigly red this week? FD puts on the menu
My puts printed. So house money calls? Yes indeed.

Is it just because I’ve had positions or is BABA especially prone to bad news?

Is there any way to run “what if’s” on options TD Ameritrade? Like put in a price and see what the option will be worth factoring in IV
it could be another red day and green on Thrusday.

however, I do hope it's green for Tech tmr. my calls are bleeding hard
oh dear
No new reasons for anyone to budge on previous positions (you know, aside from helping the American people). Democrats are still hoping they take the white house and Senate, Republicans still hoping they hold the white house and Senate, also there's a chance Pelosi loses her speakership, so I think unless job reports etc come out looking REALLY nasty and people are screaming for politicians to do something, they're just going to sit on it until this clusterfuck of an election is over.

SPY gonna end UP .5% by close
I WAS PROMISED BIG VOLUME ACTION POST ELECTION

sorry caps lock
anyone else notice the three double bottoms on spy since the start of the rally? each one gets continually bigger and we are at the end of the third one today. I'm thinkin we're gonna trade sideways a few days then rally again
Oh no, only 5 months! It cant possibly go up then
A dude in the comments just found a video of the location and it seems to be 35 m high (115 ft)
Feeling ril apocalyptic right now
Low volume day for AAPL. AH might be lit then.
Wtf is this price action. AMD is swinging 1% on a 1 minute candle
I don't even know you, and I hate ya guts. I hope all the bad things in life happen to you, and nobody else but you.

Good point, don’t know why it doesn’t say
I've seen penny stocks with more stability than SPY
All I know is that my 200 contracts of $6 for 3/19/21 is up 70% and I’ll see y’all in Valhalla. In all seriousness, small time play. It was a cheap option @$10K equity a while back and it’s going to end well.
Get that energy outtta here
Ikr the swings are incredible

China regulatory pressure seems to overshadow the huge gain of BABA from 'Singles Day' event. For now China is still drafting the paper but what do you think abt BABA for the next 2 weeks?

Uber puts. No DD. But either way I feel like Lyft earnings make it go down. Lyft bad numbers = people think Uber also is sucking. Lyft goes up = people think more people choosing Lyft over Uber. Idk I just made those last two sentences up as I was typing micheal Scott improverization style.
Volatility is insane.
Complete hearsay. Fight for 116.33. But that pump from 12:22 to 12:25 MT is so obscene. Here’s another one. 👍

They absolutely cannot let it go. Whole market will follow.

Fuckit. I made a lot of money (for me) selling some calls at the high yesterday, and buying back at the exact position today when they were back lower. 

Threw in all my gains. Let's hope you're right.

I know that is what they offered you but it’s high interest and a lot of risk. Why won’t you save up what was supposed to be your monthly payments and play with money you can lose with no interest?
Tell me what to invest in and ill pay you a 10% commission on profits.
Literally no point
Me: Throws in 20 quarters and gets 3 in return.

This guy: Puts in one quarter gets 4 in return.

Can someone please help me understand why tech would drop on positive vaccine news? I get why Stocks like ZM and PTON would, but the whole sector? Come onnn man!
It's not like people are gonna stop using tech. Hell, they'll buy even more when they all get their jobs back. It's not a zero-sum game where you can have tech *or* consumables, but not both.
What is the play NVDA calls and INTC puts? 

If NVDA data service revenue don't fall, then INTC is fuck right?
TA: SPY is in an ascending edge pattern. 70% chance of a downside breakout, target is 348.

Kind of an odd spike and sell off the last 5 minutes. Who said something? McConnell?
If there is one thing I can promise you, is that BABA won’t stay down long.
Singles Day is tomorrow
Same. I've become numb to the pain.

Can any retard explain why NIO took off this year? To me it just looks like another overvalued electric car company. Is there something special about them that happened this year or is this just part of the larger tech bubble?
TECH is done guys, stop wasting money on buying calls, there is lot of money to be made outside of TECH
Buy Amazon or wait?
There's a ton of shit here already, figured some others could learn from this as well

Should have sold my NIO 11/13 42c when it hit 42.5. The drop afterward started to fuck the IV up. Could have sold to be positive on the day, but now I'm sitting at 15% down today. Annoying.
God damn every time SPY starts climbing it just nosedives down $1 in 30 seconds.
NIO 73c 11/13
100% L E G A L
so puts?
The market is not the economy though, so I wouldn’t make predictions
SPY and DHI

If your looking to go to the moon I recommend Virgin Galactic, SPCE.

Both literally and figuratively.   They have a very important test flight on November 23rd that should result in full FAA certification for flying passengers to space.   Next they will fly Richard Branson to Space as well.
Every single inch of what they do is monetised and advertised, kinda tiring and lame, I think it will fizzle out
Vaccine + higher interest rates makes value, financials, bonds more attractive. Money moved out of expensive tech for that reason.
How is that a put when they get rev sharing
if onlyfans existed back then itd be just as popular then as it is now
I knew this kid in high school, completely fucking retarded and in trouble with the law, good thing his dad was a judge so now he's a lawyer and makes 6 figures.

Arrest these fucking MMs
Shrek cock instantly devoured by satan cock
doctor pls tell me again, i dont understand why my feet are broken and why aapl isn't at 130 points even though they released a new computer.
If I’ve learned anything in this sub it’s that earnings is always a dip regardless.

Poor earnings report? Stock goes down.

Good earnings reports? Was priced in, nobody was impressed by expected good results; stock goes down.

Just gotta wait long term.

That being said, I’d you buy Puts expecting earnings to make you money, it’ll go up instead like some sort of Schrodingers stock.

Close to bailing out on these rkt C FD's.  Can't make up my mind.  Feel like it might fly since everyone is loading up on P's
Look, I think you're kind of missing what people are saying, or we're missing you.  You seem to have a bone to pick with BYND.  That's fine,  I'm not buying.  I think the OG guy saying it'll be a 1000+ stock someday is a bit loony. 

But do I think that BYND's existence is a net good for the environment? Yes. I think it's very easy to argue that by increasing the variety of protein options and doing a bunch of R&D,  BYND is currently lowering the barrier to vegetarianism(if only for price indiscriminate folks), which is a net good. I think trying to enforce purism on emissions is not conducive to convincing people to eat less meat.

You'll post your loss porn, right?

I wish you luck, but you're superfucked.
Yes. Hopefully you are.
I mean - yeah - mock me. But the insane volume shows shorts covering (and no one is selling). So if you don’t have an answer or guess, not sure what the point of you commenting is.
Tech ain’t ever going away man.
Good luck
How is this even legal LMAO
Why wont MM let my stonk go up

Positions
I’ve got 6x 20C 12/18 and 75 shares. So probably buy Puts
All tech has supply chain issues. RELAX unless you buying shares for long term hold.
That kinda jump is never sustainable, especially based on news alone. I'm a believer in BA but I sold at the pump and not touching it for a while
big gainers bound to have a pullback soon? i think nio
200 eow
AMZN is currently nuking my account so that’s fun. Leave it to AMZN to have a new controversy each week and screw over call holders and share holders
Seems like a good DD, but sorry bud i just don’t like the vibe intc got at the moment with the way they are going. Good luck to you anyway.
Its piling into wallstreet as short sales.

"01:32 PM EST, 11/10/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) shares are surging nearly 28% in afternoon trading. The biotech firm is riding high after it reported earnings Monday that showed it swung to a profit in Q3 with EPS of $0.12, compared with the consensus forecast of a loss of $0.19 a share, according to Capital IQ.

The company also received a boost from Roth Capital, which upgraded the stock to a neutral from a sell."

how does EXPI make any sense?
This was a blatant shake out for the ER run. Yesterday JPMorgan upgraded it again and rallied. It was inflated yesterday and people cashed out today. Now the real bulls are in and ER rally starts tomorrow
Telling ya, AAPL 116.33 gotta hold or 📉
Up $300 today doing options trading.  Calling it a day.  If I could do this every day for 150 days I’d make $45k/year.  Very reasonable to think.  🧠
Idk man I think I already had a little too much fun with AMD calls... that I bought at 86...so let's try to have fun either way
I swear, i am just gonna collect poopcoins!
No, the CPU performance-per-watt is higher than a comparable Intel LV spec CPU.

Which means that a 60wh battery will last longer with their A5 because it is architecture is closer to a big.little arrangement compared to "full fat" cores like in traditional computers

If that happens, that would be wild, hoping for an announcement before end of year

TQQQ sub 130 is prime
Lol I did it
Yeah I doubled down. Wish I did so at -10%
We’ve seen companies smash earnings and have their stock decline. I’m hoping a earnings smash + announcement of auto loans. That alone increases market cap and should see price rise but unfortunately I am in fact retarded
I dumped 20% of my equity on nio. Fucking love it
Apple is making some of the best products for people right now with their own chips. Surprisingly a lot of it is affordable.  I can only see an upside to all this.

It really doesn't mean anything, there are no defined price levels to know if the stock is valued "fairly", or over/under valued which means its pure speculation at this point.

The gap below is quite large and at some point it will need to fill it, or establish a price level which really only happens over time. Holding at this point you better be in it for the long haul
If you have enough to sell covered calls on it; the IV for 11/20 is stupid-high from 11/17 earnings.  I want out so I'm setting the mark $1 more than I paid for it just to offload.
good P/E ratio, crushed earnings, and we are going into black friday/cyber monday, as well as gaming getting a huge boost with next gen. Everyone I know is just piling into building gaming PCs since consoles are sold out.

405 11/13 and averaged down on 500c 11/20s

Got up to 300% gains with the 11/13 but can’t day trade and the higher strike was only gonna give me 150% profit and I got greedy lol

Hoping for a pump tomorrow

I got assigned Friday at 11PM and my put expired. According to RH they have to submit assignment info by end of trading day.

Never would have had a chance to.
meh. my $47c are rekt
Oh is there where Apple drops? Didn’t see that coming
Guess I'm holding these BABA shares for more than 5 days.
Sell baba already fools
Actually did, immediately lost..
Thank you so much for your input. After reading everything I have decided to go against the loan and instead start small again and keep adding to my account. I'll get back to 25k pretty soon. I am also in the process of doing what you said about buying a rental property. Getting my license as we speak :)

today crazy

What are your retarded ideas on this play I’ve been eyeing 

AAL $20 July 16 call.. I’ve been waiting for each contract to be 1.00 then I’m striking.. airlines gotta come back by then

Really that easy to convince you of something? Just listen to whatever retards have the most eccentric story and go with that eh?

Jk, you’re in WSB. At least we should’ve expected this from u
Oh Rupert Murdoch is still running fox? You have some research to do.

If you're too lazy to read the article, here's the important part. "The race has already been called in the state by two news outlets, Fox News and The Associated Press."

I'm noticing a lack of CNN calling it, which was your original point.
I got in at 55 with some 1/21 65 calls and shares now just being greedy lol
Y’all really think AAPL was going to dump? Head fake. This shit will be at 118 EOD.
sell so it can open green and I can have some tendies
takes a solid 30-40 min to go up to a certain level and gets wiped by 2 candles in 2 mins.

nice nice

Here comes the BYND FOMO
WHYWYWHY
Repost.
You're smoking some straight up dry-wall if you think people holding AAPL will lose long-term lmao.
so what is interesting is that last week everyone missed the monster rally mostly done AH, so now everyone is going to buy this afternoon dump thinking the AH is going to skyrocket like last week. So will it skyrocket? Haha, we'll see
Whys it dipping
I'm skeptical.  This screenshot doesn't show a position or profit/loss.  That's just the standard price screen from Robinhood.
Alright man I’ll throw something at it what expiration
Username checks out
I tried so hard and got so far but in the end GUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
hold
BYND ripping
I’m in your position. 50c 11/27. I’m holding, ER run up this week
FSR on the verge of dumping hard
Amazon, paypal, lulu shares all down 7% for the month 😊💪🏻
Puts on your manhood
Holy fuck bynd
Well yes and no. But taking out a loan to put it in the market with is a very risky move especially given the high risk that equities and economy are at right now not to mention covid ramping up again. Way too much room for error imo
Literally everyone thinks this - it wont work
APPLE GREEN DILDOS LOL
BABA puts for sure
Cap, what strike?
🙏Yes Please
I made £1 profit off of Nasdaq and as soon as I retreat it shits itself, it’s gone berserk that I won wtf
pltr 20c 11/13, rkt 27c 11/13, i’m going to sell rkt at close if this pos stock doesn’t do anything what y’all think
Was big red, got out barely green so could be worse
Please don’t say this this time
That’s... all this is. But not really. RKT earnings will be strong and Callaway is going to get a ton of media exposure during the biggest golf tournament of the year. You asked, I told.
Well AMC puts at EOD??? Or hold until tomorrow?
I didn't buy any calls yet, was just looking at some strikes wondering what is good to get. I guess 275 more realistic.
Repost.

And yes, it's bad, because it attracts people who repost.
If this shit been in cahoots with government agencies for 17 years. I don't see why its earning is lower than expectations. Especially they just have a talk with UK to use their tech for covid trace or some shit like that
Sold off SLB for a 20% profit. CATM is up 1.5% since yesterday. BLUE is down 0.89% overall. Bought BIIB today and that’s down roughly $1.90 per share.
Haha
Sell everything and go all in on pltr and hold for 2-5 years and become a 10+ millionaire. Not a joke or trolling I’m serious about this idea.
Probably not, especially not if shares imo
"Beyond Disappointment" Bloomberg savage af lol
Fuck thank god! Nice play what was the final % return?
Apple underwhelming
Stuck bagholding after yesterday. People hoping for optimism due to heavy sell off.
The volume on those massive demon dicks is a thing of beauty
I have a bunch of Jan/Apr calls and shares. Not too worried about that. I think the biggest take away is the lack of inventory Microsoft had.
Dumbass just buy when everyone sells.
Soooo MM’s are gonna keep SPY red today huh?
Agreed. I got some 70c 12/24 when it was at 60. So made i didn't get in on it. Easy to look back on though. CVS hasn't been doing anything in years
No. It’s a red day. Get the fuck in here were ripping tomorrow
DAMN SON these AAPL bag holders never learn, get fucked
I'm not sure how someone with PDT limits is supposed to try and trade the market today.

Lol, we can no longer rise on vaccine or electron hope. 

Now when will stimulus talks begin? 🤔🤔
i assume all of u guys are retards, dont take offence
Damn tech’s actually dumping jesus christ
Ayy I hope you bought that Nordstrom and then stayed in until now, it’s been blowing up the the last couple of days. That’s what I did, I jumped in a while ago and just waited until now, I’ll probably sell soon, maybe not, but it’s doing good now
Where's the guy who was all cocky Tim 🍎 wasn't going to dump like it does after every event?
Spy dumps immediately when its about to turn green...very cool..very legal
ZM calls
What color?
GRWG, earnings tomorrow after close. They are the Lowe's/HD of weed growing. The selloff today was a gift.
me sad
Sell before you lose all your money
This is the way
Wish I held my XLE etf a bit longer for this pump.
Up 10% - I sleep.

Down 40% - REAL SHIT.
This shit is gonna get dumped so hard after earnings and im gonna cry coz im not selling any calls to these MM fucks wjo have been calling PLTR overvalued while they buy up shares fuck tnem every time i read an analyst say “oVeRVluEd” i bought another call
Today is annoying, I was just about to break even for the day and then it reverted back and cleared out all of the progress
I know, I’ve always been bullish on them and buying the dips has always been easy money until the last 2 months or so. Then I’ve gotten fucked.
Where are you getting that information? I've seen a lot of institutional people saying buy and hold RKT, and I know a good amount of the outstanding stock is owned by institutional investors.
If you’re not buying baba calls for dirt cheap now, you don’t like lambos
Not dumb for long term
I'm ready to fucking die buying SPY calls on this 2pm dump.

Wish me luck boys.
Pick a direction  AAPL so I can FOMO last mintute
Boys let’s hope Nio stays above $41.63 in the next 15 min
For reals
Buying into the market at this Fucking prices is legit like asking the MMs who bought at lows to take ur money stop donating to them

BEAR GANG REPRESENT
Welcome to Theta Tuesday
It only cost me $49 strike and they expire in January. I’ll hold for a 50% loss if they dump and move on
Usually you gotta inverse wsb and everyone is bullish on them so I’m worried you know?
25c. Most are 11/13 but I also have a 12/18 25c i bought when rkt was 18
aaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Wut gaim
Did it yesterday but it’s still dipping 🤡
RKT needs to go to 30 NOW
good on you sir
I hear the logic but too many ppl think they’ll tank post earnings for me to make that move.
Yeah I’m with ya. It’s like fucking magic; a person will say “I’ll take out a loan to invest” alone in a room, and somewhere out in the world a truck just started and it wants to crush your spine on the street out front.
I’m up 200% from my prediction so who’s bitter lol? Says something about you my friend
bought NIO 60c 11/20 a minute ago
So your gambling

Everything will be alright. Just hang in there... Oh wait a minute

Does anyone else find it ironic that the Association for Retarded Citizens is at the forefront of shaming people for saying it?  Either way, I agree; I'm surprised that cancel culture hasn't caught up to WSB.
What about Apollo 13?
Fuck it, I bought BYND, its a covid recovery stock now

Bro. You're on marketwatch.

NOK is literally ass
Keep giggling whilst reading rando’s predictions about the future. And buying calls. All day.
I guess people realized they had and have Netflix, vaccine or not
Fhck it im in
Figured out I'm not cut out for FDs. Had the right instinct buying CCL puts yesterday, but was thrilled to get out of them for 10% gain. 

Could have profited bigly.🧻✋
I'm almost pleasantly surprised to be bounding around even. Just need a tech rally by the end of week.
[deleted]
Yea man thats just too harsh. Sounds like you are into this stuff, have a base now - consider some real property (house/condo) and get some rent, bang that in against the principle, or live in it if thats the right gig and let it go. My house was a 4 bagger for me, actually just principle, I also collected rent for 17 years, so added a few more bags.
But one caveat (two really), I did that in Canada, where real estate is less volatile I think - and times they are in some ways different, but actually not. Look at NYC in the 70s, broke, crime ridden, places for sale for $10 (lol not that cheap but way knocked down) and by the 90s they were worth, wooo who knows - but tons more.
Something to think about anyway...interesting times dead ahead (like 2020 hasn't been already)
Good luck whichever way.....
[removed]
I diversify my portfolio by only buying Tesla, Nvidia, Apple and Amazon
It’s falling now
I sold the assigned shares today for a $30K loss today. Good thing you made your loss back! 

Did you try to exercise your long puts Friday after close?
This market is so confusing
So much vaccine news. Why PFE not moon
COST is amazing if you’re planning on never selling. Their business model is perfect for withstanding e-commerce.
AAPL dipping right when I got out of my puts, you're welcome everyone.
Nah I'm a retard and they are weeklies.

I already sold the earliest calls, holding half overnight
thats a big red dick
Duct tape
Do anybody knows tomorrow is BABAs singles day? other than hangseng ofcourse.
Buy puts on baba pls
Unless u buy long dated options, consider just scalping with daytrades. I lose big everytime i hold onto options. Scalping and I make 1-2K a week.
Handjibber
AAPL selloff incoming?!
Rollercoaster..
I wouldn’t pick up puts now, no. I bought calls on both this morning, holding RKT through earnings and ELY through the Masters tournament.
Yes sir
Dumb to buy in on NIO at $41?
yeah that didn't look like consolidation...

Nah wait for after earnings. No reason paying for extra IV when positive earnings has already been priced in.
Rkt earning thought?
No way PLTR doesn’t drop on earnings release. I’ll be selling a covered call on them.
Yah, hoping it’s good but honestly have no clue what is going to happen
Two hours til we find out if RKT is Apollo 11 or The Challenger
Buying BYND and BABA right now.
Wow that dump fuck
There's the apple dump I wanted
Always look on the bright side of life 🎶
Why $baba red
fucking finally aapl falling...
imagine gaming on a mac
Meh
Let me suck it
There are still 3 days left this week. No need to be so bitter.
I feel silly for not levering up even more on BYND but whatever gains are gains that I can proceed to dump into GME
SPY forming an ascending wedge... Breakout to the downside is likely if we keep going
AAPL is penny stock. They should it make a 1:100000 split.
Are..... are you serious?
I feel bad for people who can’t day trade aapl rn
hold them if theyre far off. if  not take those gains

man fuck that candle just now lol

Buy a put, stock moons. 
Buy a call, stock tanks to earths core.
This is life.
I'm all cash so I personally have nothing to lose lol good luck
Fuck this shit I literally sent the order for puts 0.01 seconds before the drop fuck me
I hope-I have 30 LEAPS JAN ‘21 at $135

How many of you bought AAPL puts today?
Market cap unfortunately.
GME $10 put Nov 27
Honestly I think if they try to stick around due to some technicality, DC will burn to the ground. You'll have moms driving in from the suburbs with molotov cocktails.

Dipped like 12% before Noon.

Currently only down 4% on the day.

NIO could hit 50 with a good ER

Two weeks ago I was at 13k now I am at 6k with unrealised losses on leaps expiring June, what should I do you experts
Growth in the summer value in the winter, a tested and proven strategy.
Dude...Stock price is based on the value that the market determines as the sum of all future cash flows. If a company is young and growing, it may very well lose money for a while, but it's, as they say, "priced in". The question is what was the expectation against that $3 loss. If they expected a $4 loss, that's great. If they expected a profit, that's terrible.
haha bagholders get upset easy brother. Just hoping they do another shit offering. Wouldn't be surprised if they did.
More tendies for us
Agreed. That was a good dip to buy into but now we going moon baby.

Not strong enough for desktop.
That’s earnings per share. Technically it should be worth less than 0 but hey, this is a casino.
NIO to 50 is more probable
Amen. Tabernacle

I think the price of SPY is too high
What kind of stupid fcking whale is holding the market. Like wtf are you holding it for ?
Ya that's about my account bal. I wheel AMD, AAPL, RKT and shit like that
Yeah so far I have found that they claim to be a software engineer, part time consultant, in the bay area with. If you had an algo like that and it was successful you would essentially sell it to a major firm or license and make absolute bank, not just use it for yourself.

I have come across this before where someone is using reddit to live out this fantasy life. They said a lot of things where it wasn't really plausible and the more you read their comments the more you realize its all just some crazy sad person. I really hope they get some mental help. Maybe they are an engineer or whatever but more than likely they are just a sad sad person who really needs actual help. I reported them to the mods though because they cross the line with the alt accounts and trying to get people to follow their financial advice. Its one thing to argue and say 'here is my position'. Its another thing to try and get people to actively listen to your trades.

These RH “here’s what investing $1k in XYZ when your mom fucked your uncle would be worth now” news are more annoying then the app choking the whole day
Listening my friend
I did it’s worth it
Nothing fancy, but bought some chwy calls on their morning dip yesterday then sold higher strike calls while it climbed to lock in my profits. Was able to get out of them all today and then rebought when it dipped this morning and just did the same thing again selling higher priced strikes.
I did. Wondering if I should have bought further out than next week though.
Investor? I 'ardly know 'er!
I mean it’s not retail like normal people shorting it. It’s big money that shorts it.

$AMD total shithole...
Agreed. I need to verify the authenticity of this meme. Link to original source of screenshot is needed.
NVAX was at $90 yesterday. EPS was about -3$. Shoudnt that give a new stock price of roughly $87? 3 dollars lost per share? Why did it fall all the way down to $78? What happend to the   missing 9 dollars? Did algos steal it?
It might after this thread lmao
Holding through earnings for RKT is going to reverse Thanos snap everyone and bring over half the sub BACK from the dead.

There's an EV bubble for sure. However, bubbles can last a really long time. Wish you the best of luck. I'm not touching it personally tho
BABA calls only play I bought at low today and DD just now
I usually only sell but buying puts on ACB, selling them today, then buying the NIO dip got me feeling like a Chad day trader. I’m gonna tell text my boss and say I quit
I’d say that Hope isn’t a strategy, and yet I’m hoping.

I’m gonna buy it and return it if it’s a POS
Sold my JOE calls for break even yesterday.  :(
Lmao
Excuse me you misspeleld stonks
Why
What?
I’d buy mostly 21-21 then 24-25 for a lotto because no one will buy OTM after earnings this late in the week
$315 put, so took an $8k bath. Email hasn’t really gone anywhere either. Made a good chunk of it back on QQQ puts yesterday but still not happy about it.
Okay youre right. Except ill just start with a higher monthly. I already have a long term investment portfolio plus a ROTH ira. I think it would be dumb to add debt when I have none
Awhile back, I bought 1000 of ACB and APHA. Both yanked hard but I sold ACB and kept APHA in case of a recovery.

IMO you should give a try if you have the confidence but do NOT take a loan. Just grind out a job to get the 25k. You're gonna be fuk if you fail with a 10% interest loan.
Damn this apple movement is seriously depressing
Looking at puts expiring in feb, at that point I’d expect if all goes well with the vaccine, zm should be headed down to a more realistic valuation. Would you wait onyx’s next Green Day to jump in?
I would hold with Singles Day coming tomorrow.  Give it until Friday.  Its nearing oversold on the daily
Lol SPY. That’s why I stop playing SPY. Shit is retarded. Crazy how high SPY was yesterday.

No. Ps5 is sold out everywhere too. It’s just the usual when a new console comes out
not a chance
mods!!!!
Feel like BABA singles day is gonna be like Prime day

Spoiler alert the stock didn’t move
Put the $650 into a brokerage account that is approved for margin, monthly. Buy mutual funds/ETFs. Use margin buying power against those to make limited loss purchases so any margin interest is limited only to the value of the amount put towards the short term play, not on $30k. Worst case scenario: you blow it up on an emotionally charged trade and end up with $0 when they force liquidate your other holdings.

Your loan idea’s worst case scenario: you blow it up on an emotionally charged trade or two, then you have an unexpected cost in another part of your life. Your debt load already being too high, you can’t take on more loans so you go into bankruptcy.

Time to buy SPCE now?
Bad news it seems.
I just sold my 12/18 $20 calls that I bought a couple of weeks ago for a 50% profit. I cant hold through another earnings. I got railed on earnings from ETSY, UPS, and Zynga and CRSR is still up in the air for me so I decided to just take my profits and not risk it. 

All of these to the moon posts are sketching me out too. I'm sure they'll report good earnings but this is a very fragile time in the market and this stock is still so young. Plus their website looks like shit. 

Good luck everybody and buy puts on TWTR. Rolled my gains into 1/15/21 $30 puts.

hahah yah right. Still have open puts on this trash. This shit aint' recovering. It's done for.

You idiots realized it dropped 15% last earnings

Wednesday-Friday I was just surfing SPY for contracts under 50. More or less just the prices they were at and with the news of who the next US president would be coming out within the next couple weeks, I didn’t anticipate it being called on Saturday though and I’m sure that helped a lot for that insane market open Monday.
Yeah my 2015 has a searate graphics card
Profitless, likely will go down unless they can make a profit for earning release
I think I'm paper handing my shit if we fall at this 265-267 level. Held up well on the September dip at this level.. diamond hands until then.
Im not surprised Baba isnt pumping anymore. It dumped like 5 times in two weeks.

Dear ppl wondering why AAPL isn't red:

Just because you don't understand the value of the tech, doesn't make the event bad
Posted this in another thread:

It's trading at the same price before it's big pre-ER runup in August. The last ER was priced in, do we really think that this one is as well?

I'm in for 11/20 21C, 12/16 24C
define shit load, it will define my stark erection
I believe in you!
Same, holding strong though after seeing their sales today
Rotating back into Tech tomorrow right?
I'm still waiting for death of the GM deal. They are finally starting to communicate how bad it would be for them.  And then that drops them to $12/share, since there would be no more speculation about a commercial EV truck popping up in 2021 driving up the price.
honestly i should be smart and bail on these RKT 20c leaps before ER. only -5% on them.

would sell weeklies against them but these are in a boomer IRA
Nah its still going to be around for a year
if it drops back down to $19 again, i'll buy back in.  but it's highly unlikely
Anybody got their hand on the mew xbox??? Is it bullish if xbox is sold out everywhere. Holding 1k msft shares rn, buying 10k a day...

The end of NIO Stonks!!!!
Investors are liking that AAPL event. This is the first event that did not tank, meaning this will be mooning by Friday. Buy calls on AAPL now and thank me later.
Long AAPL, wait for the market to price in their new mac series + M1 chips + fanless laptops
lol it really did drill again. Bruh these puts printed.
Lolwhat? Shorting is dangerous as fuck. Do people on this sub just not understand what a short is?
todays bottom, years bottom or cycle/company bottom lol.
PE about 500, NAZ average about 20ish.....and what, about 100x ttm revenue...so one might make a macro argument that it could see a 90% drop from peak, but way too many variable to say with certainty.
It was in the 220s in August - hmmm
That event sucked giga ass and AAPL up

[Is that true?](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/heres-what-tesla-will-put-in-its-new-batteries/)

"Tesla currently uses an NCA chemistry (that’s  lithium-nickel-cobalt-aluminum), while lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt  (NMC) chemistries are common across the rest of the EV industry. Cobalt  is the most expensive of these elements, and most of it is sourced from  mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where unsafe working  conditions and child labor are serious problems. As a result, the  industry has been trying to reduce cobalt usage."

To be fair they say the market looks forward 6-12 months. By that point the vaccine will likely be at your local Walgreens for under 20 bucks
Been doing it for 8 years. Last 2 years wwre highest volume. Used the money to get rid of all debt. I could start again with 5k but I would prefer to be over the 25k minimum for day trading.

Got 100 shares at 268. Gonna sell some CCs
This is an amazing entry point for BABA.  It bounced off 265 back on September 25, and this level served as resistance a few times before that. RSI is just about oversold on 4H, and Stochastic RSI is turning bullish.  They have Singles Day coming up tomorrow, and will shatter their sales record.  BABA 300c 12/18

Why is Apple not tanking after that shit event?

Why buy BABA anymore after Jack Ma essentially fked them

I’ll be honest, anytime anything serious happens a stock dies then pumps back harder. This is super serious so I’m all in. 😎

you retards are talking about buying BYND calls

i'm the one that is holding from before earnings
Do these charts take into account moon cycles?
upwards of $20 if it surpasses expectations
But the SETTLEMENT TIME.

Oh, and holding some jan/march 85/90 calls that are also gonna print
Wheel retard
I'm going to save this so I can learn what these words mean.
Why the fuck would you write calls on a day that tech is down hard?? You sell calls on green days when you aren't expecting the stock to continue going up...

Selling puts today would have been smarter. Specifically BABA 260p is free money, they should close above 260 on Friday
Imagine not picking up ACB puts yesterday.
8 years. Last 2 years were highest volume. Made enough money to clear student loans. Its not the longest record but I have gone through blowing up my account and some bad situations already. I think I have a shot.

Don’t trade AAPL, hold it.
Thats fair. I have blown up an account already. Been trading for 8 years. Last 2 years I made enough to make myself debt free. I could just start again from a smaller amount. I just would prefer to be over the 25k minimum to begin with
Put it all on HYLN bitch
You shoulda bought a couple of calls to hedge that.
I did earlier, backed that truck up. Gonna sit on it until it hits mid 300’s

Theoretically goes down but it usually doesn’t imo
so this shit was the biggest pump and dump scam ever! fml
I am offended.
The highlight of AAPL is the Indian chick
Dick pics? LMFAO! 

And yeah thats another huge issue i have with their story. If they were so outrageously independently wealthy and made this insane computer algorithm no way in hell would they be working, and if so definitely not as some ordinary engineer or even a project lead. Person would either be in early retirement or if they really wanted to work with their time they’d definitely be an executive or C level at some company with talents like that.
Spy is gonna either go up or down from here. You are welcome.
Yeah the only for sure drop came today.  There had to be a pullback at some point which happened, where we go from here is a totally different question.  

All of them found support at higher levels than I expected today but US legalization is now on the table and the sector is overdue for mergers and acquisitions.

That would give me a Boner, Champ.....
I did!
I’m not too worried about it
Taking a loan is risky as fuck, but if what you're saying is true it's not a ridiculous move... Just feels like it would be better without the loan. If you're making 70k without any debt and no rent, you could probably scrape together the 25k in a year.
Either way, good luck
No one else has said it but congrats - hopefully you had a 18+ sign you up because they'll eventually audit accounts for legal age like another user posted on here. Robinhood seems to have disliked the 17 year old having an account. However that same user did say options were still allowed for them but shares were not. Odd...

dilemma of the day
Yea, why don't you start with 5k and see what happens before you make a decision that will end up making you hate yourself for years. Everyone who trades and I mean EVERYONE blows out an account at least once in their lives. I personally lost almost 30k in a single day a few years back. Never thought it could happen to me. I was too smart/safe/etc... It was so fucking terrible. I can't imagine what would have happened if I owed that money too. I probably wouldn't be here.
🤡
Apple going to 113 1000% guaranteed bet my whole account
Whoopsie, thanks.
Cannot decide 😬
Don't know. Could be that Covid is the worst its ever been, vaccine doesn't actually come out until next year, contesting mango.
Yeah
YOLO baba 305c 11/13?
Good on you, I sold like a bitch for $650 loss end of day

You think I’m safe with 23c 11/13?

Lmao bezinga: “buying $1,000 worth of AAPL the day that Trump sold his shares would be worth $7358 today”
11/13 18p
We expect too much. I also sold 5 weekly 18 calls today to hedge my mistakes lul. Im refuse to lose. So I bought a 17 dollar lotto ticket that will be worth .01 tomorrow while you're all rich. Or ill come back here at 630 and laugh at your misfortune.
No shit Sherlock
And the price?
That's apple. Includes some new feature that's already included in all of their competitor's products, and act like they are 1st to do it.
Go watch some Auschwitz movies and you'll feel better.

Welcome to the big wide world we don't give participation trophies for showing up.

Read the sidebar about gain porn.
AMD is pissing me off fr. Their new CPUs are best on the market easily and sold out instantly, their new GPUs will sell instantly as well. I literally don't know what they could have done better.
RKT men holding through earnings, I salute you brave sirs
Why think so small? Go 100k at 20% apr.

Both can get you to -99% so just flip a coin

Fake meat not so fake after all

Yes buying GRWG for earnings tomorrow
Yup. My OTM puts that terrifyingly became very ITM yesterday afterhours are now once again OTM and I expect they will expire worthless and I will not own 1000 shares of BYND
Agreed. Nothing is gonna happen to BABA, this is an overreaction
need lotto call play, ideas? ZM? jmia?
From 6 inches to 16 is a big surgery
You’re more than fine

10.2% interest?? Wtf is that normal? Treasury yields are like under 1% and it cut costs you 10%? Seems like loan shark territory.

Anyways, all you need to do is load up on NIO and you'll get your money paid off in no time
Did your parents co-sign your account?

I bought yesterday at 38.90. Regardless of whether there is a further jump, PFE is a good company that pays a 3.9% dividend. It’s worth a long term hold.

who got pumped and dumped with REV?
> my capabilities

What if they turn out to be retarded though?
I grew up learning to put different disk drives as master and slave drives. Everyone knew what this meant. It's succinct, it worked, it was a standard. Now everyone and their mother has tried to come up with new terms and there's no standard. But we can't call them master and slave drives anymore. That's racist.

We also used these terms to describe the switches in things like ram. We used to have master and slave flip flops controlling ram, but at some point it became racist to call a collection of nand gates master or slave. So the entire cs-ce-ee world needs to change the vocabulary that describes the relationship because someone was offended that a hdd or some gates in their computer have a master-slave relationship

It's all very retarded

Now this is a fun trading day
Hmm I had my resistance at 572 and it blew past that lol It went higher and you diamond handed these through rest of Friday and held through the morning pop yesterday?  lol you sir are a true 💎✋'er. Wish I was that confident about my trading hahaha
Dude you would have gone all in on calls if you understood the tech they just unveiled.
Calls on PRPL
Lol, that .77 per quarter divi is really getting everybody excited.
Man for your sake I hope you dont regret it
don't think your call will print just because u say good things about it
I wish this Toyota Corolla virus never happened. This year has been miserable.
Incredible, inverse WSB works every time.
inverse wsb
Been trading for almost 8 years now. Last 2 years have been highest volume. Used the money to pay off every other debt I had (student loans, etc). So currently debt free. I have some left over, but it would take a while to get to the 25k+ mark and bypass day trading.
Yes.
Unironically. My grandpa bought 200k of AMD on the last dip to hedge his 200k of intel
For next time. Buy AAPL Puts, then event dumps, sell AAPL Puts 1 buck less  than you bought at the same price you bought your puts at. 

Bam free SPY hedge.
I was told AAPL would tank
Do it. If you have a job paying 10x the monthly payment, doesn't sound too bad of a risk
dont be a HERO buying TECH, big gains are outside of TECH
True, but if it mooned like tsla last year around this time, anything is possible hah. All it took was jp morgan to give the “ok” stamp in october
Baldur’s Gate 3 running on integrated graphics is legitimately impressive
what's your strike/exp?
that's integrated graphics retard
Yeah honestly the stuff they announced at this event were pretty tight, I'm still surprised it's not tanking tho
Is this Apple thing actually revolutionary like they say
Lol I love that when I search SPY in Google to check the price two of the three articles in the 'Top Stories' section are 'SPY could drop 8% in a contested election' from a week ago. What a load of crap.
Hard week? It’s only tuesday!
My asshole is leaking droplets of purple goo. I think I'll be okay though. Thanks.
If you're doing it today then yes lol. If you did it Friday then you might be okay.
It’s been pretty flat today so hopefully we get some good movement

Baba 300 eow would be nice
What happens to stocks on dividend payout days?
I made this move as well, just couldn’t see the RKT hype, still holding onto PLTR positions and SPCE positions
This.
No u
buy end of the month puts, without the senate dems won't do shit
Stonks only go up, amirite?!
why don't people understand that most individuals, together with institutions, have long positions on appl alongside whatever they may move around on the regular? do you even vape bro?
Where’s all the people that told me my Apple wins no matter what idea was the worst idea they ever heard?
WTF that's literally the exact opposite, can only lose 100% on a put. Do you know what a short is?
As long as it's less than 10K ppl will buy it
What do you guys think about PLUG as a semi long term play? Few months
They didn't even get into the sex toy business smh, wasting the potential of a name like iCum
BTFD on CARR. Got a positive long term outlook and fantastic price action since IPO earlier this year.
you talking about nkla? nio's been producing and delivering
You wouldn't even have done that great doing this, you basically just missed the entire rally last week and paid slightly more than you sold them for.
Really stupid.
Hopefully power hour gives us some tendies.

I can't do another drill. Might throw up.
Yea but TDOC broke 180. 

DOCU and TDOC move fairly similarly and TDOC broke the bottom of its range so...

What makes you feel confident in your abilities? How long you been trading?
Yeah sure just fuck up my shit
You’re only replying to me dude, I’m just as in the dark about taxes as you. 

Go up to petes comment above in the thread and reply to his.
As do I.  Still have PTSD from last earnings dump but I’m holding strong with about 1/2 the position you have.
FSLY gearing up for one of those 40% in 3 days runs?
LMAO APPLE 🐻S IN SHAMBLES.
Start saving your checks dude. Don't leverage yourself (loan) to leverage yourself more (options). Sounds like an easy way to get yourself fuq'd bigly
The Smith's can't go to Vail or Cancun this year, so money spent on mac products and other fun consumer goods.
Probably, they got sued for anti-trust in Europe
okay AAPL M1 looks good

but does anyone know the pricing?
10% is fcking ridiculous, robbery - money is free to those fcks and that is the rate they charge. screw that, wait as urban centres have their crisis and pick up some prime RE that you can live in/rent and flip later.  the mortgage rate has to be waaaaay lower so easier upside (remember location location location) and a hedge in these times...ok thats my thought. 10% WTF
Oooooo he mad. 🧸
no
GUSH makes no sense, ever...
I'm waiting until tomorrow at least on the same.
If you have to ask...

Well I don't believe its a gamble though. Isn't it similar to if I took out a loan to start a business? Like a McDonald's franchise or something. Only difference here is that its a bet on myself.
I bought some calls at the dip, doing well for me
normally i'd make fun of this but this guy is literally me with my qqq calls

Sold puts at the bottom. 

Very productive day.
Probably not
Coding without an F row is just making shit way more difficult for absolutely no reason.
Srsly though, you can't blame stupid people for thinking Silicon Valley is full of space lizards.
sure. that's exactly what i meant.
Wait TSLA actually might pop off
It will be lucky to not crater.
Still holding the shares i bought years back. Pump this week is nice, finally broke past the cursed $60-65 range it kept dumping from. 

Not really buying calls on it though.

What's a decent overnight hold here? I'm beginning to think it's Theta gang week after the Kangs ate yesterday. And unless im selling KODK or cheap weed options, lets just say my uhhh account isn't exactly setup to be theta gang.

What makes you say this
Every time I bet apple moons after an event they tank.  Now they stay flat or even go up when I bet the opposite way.  Is the event over yet?
NIO +25% overnight. Because I’m an asshole and need it.
Yessss
the next new innovative thing from apple will be glasses and that's years away.

puts on acb and all weed stocks easy money
I said I wouldn't but peer pressure sucked me in. Im bought a few. Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me 3 times, Well I must be a retard.

Every time I have bought them they tank and I loose money. Sorry y'all but RKT boosters are going to go bust
If NIO closes above 42 that’s just so nicely healthy and bullish. People took profit, bought back in, selling pressure seems low now, comfortable correction from the run by having this down day + last Friday’s down day.
Who here thinks palantir earnings would be good ?
Big no...if you lose it your life will be miserable for 5 yrs

56 Billion! in 30 minutes
Ahh, te bañaste
ACB go back to $4 where you deserve to be
I can understand 1 or 2 bad weeks. But this has been bat shit crazy for 2 months. Amazon +/- 10% every week. All tech. JPM +20% UAL +%20 in 1 day. I must be dreaming. This stuff doesn’t seem real, these numbers are unheard of
Man you really like apple huh.

What a cuck.
What are these price swings on Apple man lmao
10.2%? Did you just go through bankruptcy?
Good luck dude, this is a big play! The IV on RKT is crazy right now so you'll need a big pop, here's hoping for 28 post earnings.
Party here at 5pm?
I’m in!
You guys sound like shills.
Never ever take out debt to gamble. Only use what you can afford to lose. We may be retards here but were retarded with our own money. Dont lose money you dont have

Whelp, time to submit an IT request for a new macbook. 

Gotta fuel up my 12/18 aapl calls somehow cause this event ain't doing shitt
I cant but that battery life on the new macbook is insane
and yet.... baba still in a down trend
I would but who's giving you this loan?

10.2% must be a secured loan.
Lmfaoooo holy shit that top NIO comment was me
Of course AAPL goes up since everyone thought it would dump
Touche. Schadenfreude, mostly. And to keep up with reactional market sentiment (but not always follow along).
Don't do it. Do it as a side hobby. Show some strong consistent gains for at least a couple years, then consider it. Even then, theres a 95% you're gonna fail.
I hope not, I need 45 tomorrow

Ok I feel better about my 7k in rkt now.

Is this the bottom on the stay at home stocks? We all know they gonna pop off again when everyone realizes covid is not going away anytime soon.
Yawn. The last time Apple truly introduced an interesting new product was when they introduced AirPods. Change my mind
Good luck man, rooting for you. I believe in NIO tho 🙏
Any of you guys use betonline? I have $2k I want to withdraw - have to wait until the 19th for deposit to clear smh - and wanted to see if any of you had any trouble withdrawing
Earnings. Weren't as bad as ppl thought. Therefore now it is recovering from the dump that happened recently.
wtf is Funko FNKO
Probably would be flat😂😂
They only own it for the dividends you clown.
avoid memes (ROKU, W, TDOC, PTON) they will go down another 20-25%... vaccine is real
We’re about to hit triple top of day
If tech isn’t green tomorrow I will be in danger *nervous chuckle*

how about now
AMD is now boomer stock
Is it really that bad of an idea? It's like if I were to take out a loan to start a small business. Except here I'm investing in my capabilities.
Anyone playing AMAT earnings this week?

Just did. I'm in pain.
As long as you are prepared to live with the worst case scenario just do it. Don't trade on margin though

I'm considering a 30K loan for 5 yrs at 10.2% interest to trade stocks and other derivatives. The monthly payments would be at around $650 with no prepayment fee so I can funnel my profits into the loan and decrease the principal. 

I currently have no other debt and no bills. I figure instead of paying "rent" I can pay the $650 but also have a shot at gaining equity. Its an investment on myself. I am confident in my abilities. 

Note: if things went south, I would have no issues making the monthly payments. 

Any thoughts friends?
Apple fucking blows for anyone that knows how to use a computer and wants to actually have control of it. Apple is perfect for drooling Beckys that just want it all to be "easy & thoughtless"

I'll never buy one, but holy shit ain't that America? Calls.
To you as well. Once WarpSpeed is over, I expect PLTR to fall.

Happens to a lot of big businesses, they cant take as many risks. Every product cant flop, its the same reason why activision releases the same call of duty game yearly, its a sure seller.
Same with the move on MSFT. Bought it at the top as well. Good shit bro.

feeling good right now :D
I am about even the last two days. Makes be feel like I’m actually kinda diversified.
The only stock in my portfolio that I am confident will double within the next six months is NKORF, it is a junior miner totally under the radar, every single drill hole over the past six months has been fantastic, they've discovered an at-surface Tier 1 palladium ore body that will be cheap to mine, and once they announce the updated NI-43101 at the end of their 2020 drill program, their inferred resource base will jump 500-600%.  The market cap is currently $18m and this will rise to $36-48m market cap when the NI-43101 is updated.  Its an easy 2-3x from here!  GLTA
AAPL events never bullish anymore

That being said I’m not buying puts here. Prob will have some BS reason to go up

This is giving me flashbacks of the blizzard Diablo Immortal unveiling

But can it run Crysis?
Did they update the 16 inch MacBook Pro?
Considered selling your calls maybe?
well from experience. Auto companies are generally valuated at a P/S of 1.7 on average. That means for instance that in order to be valued at 100 bil they should makes sales of 50 bil per year. Drive trains are 40k a piece. Thats a lot of them. Even when talking about selling trucks, it's still alot. Look at other auto companies how long it took them to scale production that high. I'd say definitly 10 years for that. Great ROI though if it happens
Umm hi yea, I was told tech was the future
What do you think? of course its bullshit. FEARS he will...Fears? yeah that's bullshit.

they're dope but you should basically treat them as fish you can hold sometimes. just make sure you get a nice enclosure for them, get some nice substrate, put in at least a couple of hides for them to sleep under, and you'll need a temperature-controlled reptile heating pad to put underneath the enclosure to keep them at the correct temperature. also make sure to spray water in the enclosure to keep it humid enough which will help them shed properly.

oh, and avoid getting any spider morphs as well, as they're known to have a genetic defect called spider wobble where they have trouble stabilizing themselves.

Yeah they did the same for me - they sent me a random pic of one of their trades and then talked about how they have hundreds of followers. I think it is a scam this person is running to try and get you to pay them to join a discord server to 'learn their secrets. I bet he/she told you not to link other accounts to them b/c they got too many dick pics lol.

I mean yeah 10K to 20K is doable but as you look into the profiles all of them comment the same way and have the same story. This person claims to be a highschool graduate at 15, made 80K, is a genius engineer, comes from a family worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and has created an algorithm that predicts the market so well they have made millions of dollars off of it.
yesterday they got a vax for the corolla virus

Idk about intel stock price and history but recently is not doing that good compared to amd. Amd new cpus are faster and better than Intel cpus and won't be able to compete with amd for at least 1 or 2 years. Intel cpu still in 14nm compared to amd 7nm and Intel new cpu supposedly coming out in 2021 still uses the 14nm process.. idk what that has to do with the stock price correlation but im just letting you know there's no good new for Intel recently. 

Although! They do have a line of GPUs apparently coming out which should compete with Nvidia and AMDs GPUs so that may be good news.
What the fuck
cheers, thanks!
Fuck I need Joe or Kammy to pump weed now!
Why is tech so low today!!!
Pompeo will most likely run in Kansas at some point, so I get he needs Mango’s base in the future. But he’s the fucking Secretary of State and fueling instability

# DAQ LIVES MATTER
Mobile gaming is 70% of the gaming industry revenue now and this will do that better than anything

We are seeing the start of a convergence between mobile, laptop, and desktop architecture
buy spreads for amazon?
Not even going to front 20 hours of battery life is insane for a small laptop.
Few days late bud. If today was Friday, right on the money.
Which is basically a tech stock.  But yeah, same.
That's just what happened today with NIO
Rip all gay Apple 🐻S.
Glad I’m holding apple

I might be wrong tbh but thats what i remember last time

You're literally explaining why you should buy BABA
Apple now has the best gaming laptop you can buy.  Lawlers
Highlight of the event was the cute Indian girl

This is why I bought S&P ETFs in March. Up 20+%

gotta increase your leverage, get that peak higher
Apple making their own CPU chips is very bullish to me. Tim really knows how to grow a company. Semi's are a booming industry
and to read wsb?
Unless your medical condition is so bad that you cant continue doing the contracting job, I would stick with it. I would absolutely LOVE to make 3k/week. I think you might be very disappointed if you step down to working at target making $15/hour. What would you next step be after target? Please keep the long term in mind before making this decision.
$300 yolo pls need money
Geys should I get a ball python? I’ve heard they are good little pets and can be handled like 3x week? Not getting an albino python though they are not healthy snakes, or so I’ve heard
I’m 20, and yeah $300 a day is really good, you’ve already got a career.  If you aren’t happy doing it then don’t stress yourself too much but many people would kill to get paid that much
I know it's fake but anyone think that room is a big waste of space?
Y'all deadass can't take a -.3% day? Where have you been for the past couple of weeks?
No volume on AMC. Prime for the PAHMP.
I know bro what did they release except from the Mac anything special?
Buying ACB at all 🤡.
Yeah I feel you, so you’re trying to decide whether to do the contractor job for more money, but it’s only available for a couple months, or stick with a lower paying stable job.

Shit I’d honestly go for the contractor job cause you’ll be miserable at the other one, and you can pick up some boring ass job literally anywhere when you get done
Girls don't use the internet, and all users here are gay

potential coup very bullish for WFH stocks

Most likely. But with AAPL presentation, it might not make it to EOD. 🤦‍♂️
Don’t look at them that far away dude
Spy going up at this moment 🙃
Now it’s gonna go up
There’s like 18B APPL shares out there bro. Most people already have some AAPL or exposure to them through pensions/ETFs etc
Everything i have read points to them being at higher production and deliveries than expected. I dont think anyone expects them to be profitable immediately. People are talking about nio as if its trading at 130 dollars a share right now.
I’d be able to still day trade 😪
Calls on the cute girl to give her a rise. The other actors were garbage.
Battery for 20hrs seems really good. Will it burn your thighs though?
It’s gonna continue the dip trmw, on Thursday it’s leaping, calling it rn
Damn 20 hours battery life is kinda cool
Gay.
Yea I've gone down 200 today. Hopefully it goes my way before my contract expires on Friday
17 hours on mbp battery ??? Wtf
Is this the NIO dip to buy?
0.5 is enough to wipe half of us tho
[deleted]
Same down 30%
Take my upvote
Apple should do the same with the iPhone. Just make one fucking design and upgrade the hardware.
pretty bullish reversal with a higher low and higher high
I have $18c for 11/20. We’ll see what happens
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you don't even believe this even though you said it. Certain games just don't run and Macs are much harder to upgrade when new tech comes out (and certain things can't even be upgraded by the user because of how they construct their pcs).
AAPL event
Then yolo your whole port into $300 leaps or something crazy lol.
Might be right
December 4th Zoom calls are easy 4-5 bagger material
Note to Apple: as soon as they put the hottie on, stock starts rising
I wish I was a big sir
That reminds me. Gotta DL
lol, i didnt avg down like a simp.. told myself I would
Holy fuck double the battery life on mbp
Banks, oil, airlines the worst performing sectors get a 20% pop. And how are they doing today? This whole market is a pump and dump scam.

All their revenue is from subscriptions. They dont really need innovation so long as they trail current technology. Look at the new iPhone for example: no 120hz, big ass notch, processor behind snapdragon, but their preorder still surpassed the S20 ultra

Why is NKLA down when they crushed earnings so hard that earnings were begging to be placed at the bottom of a hill with a Badger placed at the top of the hill, and using the HTML 5 supercomputer and multi directional satellite nav, locate earnings and put it out of its misery.
Hands down.
PLTR looks halted it’s moving so slow
17 hours, bruh.
Why do you need any more?

If you can't live a fulfilling and content life making $155k/yr for doing nothing, along with a $5MM chunk to fall back on, I have to wonder what makes you happy. 

Don't mean to preach, it just strikes me as astounding. Best of luck.

Yes. You just gotta ease into it. Start off with a finger and gradually work your way up. In no time, you'll be able to take a baseball bat.

I got burned by that asshole for all of October. Bled my January $90c from $7 to $2.50 a share. Fuck playing AMD anymore, none of the earnings, gpu announcements, console releases or anything else seem to make the stock go up at all. It just goes up whenever the MMs feel like making it go up

Lol I don’t give a shot about aapl 😂😂😂
What are you talking about? Macs have plenty of performance already. Prior to this. For years they’ve made very capable computers to game on. PCs have much more capable builds than this. It’ll be years before apple secures anything major in terms of a large library of available games to play.

You forgot to buy the dip
Went from NIO to AAPL gripes real fast in here.
I'm scared.
Thanks for the write up man. But yeah I work hospital supply chain and we’re gearing up for a rough winter so these rally’s really have me questioning everything. It’s about as bad as it was in early March in regards to backorders

Well, MY pfe is red and not moving. I'd say GTFO if you're green.
Okay bozo a 30% day is still a 30%, didn’t think I would have to spell that one out for you
Why is MSFT taking a fat shit?
Interesting lmfao.

I will say they did send me pics of one of their trades but tbh I have no way of knowing it's actually their trade or that they didn't just inspect element smaller trades they had. Either way their story still smells of bullshit and I don't really buy it dw.

That said I still do find it believable that a Highschooler can leave school with 10-20k, my brother left highschool with a little over 10k this year although that was mainly thanks to him getting the covid unemployment boost after he lost his job from covid. He probably would have left with about 5k otherwise. Still is possible though esp in higher income rich areas. 

80k-100k made solely by a highschooler is just incredibly rare and complete bullshit though lol. If they made that much no way in shit that they'd be here.
Mac mini? Damn that's so 2001.

New MacBook Air looking pretty good compared to previous model. Guess AAPL will be red today

I bought that dip randomly because I saw they had big price action loss after low deliveries. NEVER heard of them before that. But was intrigued so placed a big bet 🚀🚀🚀

So apple puts?
So you went from $5 to $15. Cool
open up an opposite leg if you want to lock in gains. e.g. if you are long calls, short calls of the same date higher strike. You create a spread and lock in SOME gains. Not a 1:1.
I have CS background

I would recommend you to become an angel investor and with only one win you could get your money into 1000x, if you only do fine your money would at least do 10x.

What? You bought the iphone 12 and would go back to android??
I guess you're completely unaware of how many idiots bought the new phone cuz of the new blue color
Sell now. Going down to 20 after earnings or lower
They keep threatening us with massive rotations into value. We've had a couple fakeouts already and of course you can find any number of articles written today saying that tech is fucked and it's value time. Idk.. I'm not buyin it yet. Vaccine news is nice and all, but I really don't think we're close enough yet for this rotation to have legs.

Is it just a scheme because tech keeps getting overvalued? Make up some stories, tank tech, scare the soft hands out, fakeout to "value", retail FOMOs in, dump value, buy back tech cheap. Rinse and repeat
Plays for tmrw?
Apple Event "One More Thing from the title" is we are going down! xD

Gaming on a Mac Book Air lol good one. What kind of crack is being smoked by the script writers
I know..... I said it "should" moon.
I got the new iphone 12 Pro... don't get the hype... think I will stick with android.
I think all the positive earnings from REITs are great, but I think you may have missed the rocket on this one. Needed to get in last week. Who knows - they've all jumped a ton today. I don't know how safe I'd feel jumping in this high with the way they've trended. Does look like some rotating in from dumping tech.

Why the fuck are y’all like the angry audience throwing rotten veggies at the stage? Give this shit some time, this is AAPL’s best event of the year, they are unveiling some wicked tech.
Is AAPL pulling SPY down or SPY pulling AAPL down?

>The House will “vote on the MORE Act to decriminalize cannabis and expunge convictions for non-violent cannabis offenses that have prevented many Americans from getting jobs, applying for credit and loans, and accessing opportunities that make it possible to get ahead in our economy,” Hoyer said in a Dear Colleague letter to House members.  
>  
>**The MORE Act would federally deschedule cannabis**, expunge the records of those with prior marijuana convictions and impose a federal five percent tax on sales, revenue from which would be reinvested in communities most impacted by the drug war.

Biden staffs slam Facebook. Good luck Facebook holders to the next 4 years.
It’s flubbing again!
I think next year NIO will be low 60’s
When was the last time an AAPL event didn’t shit the bed?
I also own shares but I figured that would be too vanilla for this crew lol
Ever since Apple split they have been more worried about showing their chest hair than muscle.
I only just checked the market why is pfe fucking my ass so hard? The vaccine is still bullish no matter what Donald Dump says. No press release from pfe.
Feels so good bro.

AAPL

Aapl is gonna fuking tank isnt it...
Baba going up right?
Apple lol
LOL Intel bye bye
Yeah just broke through and crashed back down. It always rises beginning of the day and fades after lunch. Still not selling but pretty sure were giving some back for the rest of the day.

I get people freaking out about the Chinese government stepping in but in the grand scheme of things China is going to do what is good for China. Alibaba is good for China. If Jack Ma is China's problem then Jack Ma is the one who is in trouble.
If you’re retarded
Whoever told me to buy baba, fuck you
You had me up until you said "synergy".
imagine buying BA when they sell negative planes 😂😂
stocks aside. Tim Cook is running Apple into the ground. They are worth 2T. If they aren't innovating and brining the next generation of tech they are failing.
It’s so easy to get puts for almost every event and every time a company announces earnings but I could never seem to pull the trigger smh
Definitely won't reach $20 again, maybe mid-30s
Up 25% on my RKT 11/13 23C ... hold this till close?
Really AAPL? Had to crash the whole market?

Market just waiting for Apple to fuck up their event to sell off more 😂
Jesus. 🤣🤣🤣
This is the same as last event lol 

Calls on the run up 

Puts before the event lol

Too bad I fucked my account and can’t day trade again until I make back some money because it woulda been the perfect day trade 😤
You can't fix stupid brother.
Unless it kills COVID and both presidential candidates I don’t think it will matter.
Yep. Hedging my losses with puts on AAPL and CCL. Hoping for some serious rebound by NIO before the end of the week.
Aapl has no innovation they just make everything better
I hate algos they legit trade on correlation and fucking tank markets on a heavy day trading company like Apple
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

what if it doesnt go to past 6k
If they don’t bring out a Stevie Jobs hologram doing The Griddy dance then this event is a major flop

AAPL about to crash the whole market again
WHAT THE FUCK! ALL THAT FOR THE SAME MODEL
Get out of NIO calls?!
I love how AAPL sucks so everything else sells off.  AAPL should be delisted and I have like 5000 shares.
Typically, institutional traders dont want to hold onto a big position heading into a holiday. This is because they just want to get time off and dont want to worry about their positions.

Additionally, a lot of institutions (i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, etc) typically buy big name or popular stocks at year end to make up their portfolio because at year end, they need to tell their investors how the year went and what currently makes up their portfolio holdings. So there’s a small boost to strong blue chip or big tech company stock prices at year end.

Other than that, it’s going to be a shit show. It will be repeat of “drug company releasing positive COVID vaccine results”, followed by states and cities shutting down due to the inevitable second wave, which will drive money back into Stay at Home stocks, and the process will repeat.

Remember, positive vaccine news is temporary. Even if a company like Pfizer gets FDA approval by year end, they need to manufacture them to have it available for all of US and other countries. Manufacturing process will take time (similar to the constraint that companies had in producing antibacterial wipes and etc). Getting significant majority of US population vaccinated will also take time. So, in short term, its not going to change much
The thing has hella weight
I appreciate your inclusion of the hard working Congolese children. May their exploited labor not be in vain 🙏🏾

This apple event has been so shit so far that I am mad that I didnt load up harder on puts when it was green

WUBDUBDUBDUB
Looks like all the other Mac airs lmao
I was fortunate enough to buy NIO last year in a dip at $1.52 (sold at 4 something). Went in again hard at a average buy price of $3.14.  Best play of my trading life. Next was in NFLX at $49 in 2013 (adjusted for splits) and Zoom last year at $79 (should have sold at $588!)
Bears fucked as always
Apple 80 EOD
Institutional shorts that can’t be squeezed by retail you mean
I bought five months ago. Then I sold a month later when it tanked and I thought I’d made a mistake :|

What would he have done differently?
Thank you.. but kind of feeling nervous now😂
Never say goodbye. There is an investment strategy for any condition.
I'm so dumb fuck why didn't I go short
[We finally learned they use algo on our pages, and try to fuck us all (not confirmed)](https://ibb.co/nrD94tv)
Buy limit at 95 for Apple shares. Gonna go take a nap.
Apple really just gunna take the whole thing down, wow
BABA to me BABA to me BABA to me
Thx for labeling "bear", I was starting to get confused at the end there. Nice save!
I'm genuinely curious about what most of you believe NIO will be by 2022?

Let me get this straight. The company is being bought at $3 per share. You have $5 calls. You expect this shit to almost double with a bidding war in a time of depressed travel lol
Some dude above (below?) Said TGT gonna moon, I check and said its only 2%, that ain't mooning. Get down voted because "I didn't say it is currently mooning"
From the Jobs days. He was such a driver, though. Made sure that shit was tiight. He’s gone, BTW. 🤷‍♂️
All my homies drive gas guzzling SUVs.

F them EVs
Oh, I know that. I was already waiting for a comment to which to reply "r/wallstreetbets - full of people who know what they are doing".

But I did do some reading on these out of interest.
Apple going with proprietary chip will be their down fall. They use to get third party development by using standardized architecture. Now vendors will either need to have apple develop drivers and whatnot to support their products or drop the product all together. That will diminish Apple's synergy with third parties. While it may look good on paper. In practice, they will fail..
That's painful
I use Robinhood charts exclusively. And yes I’m down 40k in 2 months
Puts on me for watching this Apple event
Niceeeee
What do you think he would have done differently?
meanwhile in the year 2050 RKT hits 21.62

AAPL has lost its innovation. That’s why ARK doesn’t bother with AAPL
RKT short sellers keep trying to turn us negative every morning and then we bite back by close. Rinse and repeat. I wonder when they'll get the hint? 😂
I also have a good question, why isn’t AAPL 125 yet
Wow it’s back to where it was like 3 trading days ago
Buying that shit at $36.75 yesterday felt so good
Same lmao. I usually am very cautious but said screw that this week and got absolutely wrecked on aapl weeklies
They’re not gonna change the exterior? :(
That’s when I sold on RH. That sucks man. Sketchy ass apps haha.

BABA daily chart is wild
I bought shares of FOXF for earnings today. Bicycle sales have been huge.  
Options have horrible bid/ask and no volume so they are untradeable to me.
That's fancy ramen. I can't afford that.
No, AAPL always targets autists
Feel your pain brotha. Had 2,000 shares since 2018 and 2 months before the jump to $20 a share i sold 1500 shares at $8-10 per share.
Puts on this event. And puts on APPL. And puts on a their stupid iPhone computer chip.
Lmao I'm just holding shares and I'm with you, fuck the apple stock and M1 is dogshit
I saw this with my own eyes and yall can too is all im sayin
Tf is “revinue”??
Switch to puts its so easy
PTON puts are very juicy
Get back to NIO 🐈s
LMAO this is great.
So much cringe....I miss Steve Jobs 😭
Why dont they let the hot chick speak
We play games a lot to avoid the depression 😔
Dang, the dream
No u
Thanks.  It's going to moon
Puts on apples marketing team.

Steve Jobs is literally gonna be so irritated he will rise from the grave and haunt their HQ until they go out of business.
Before you cash advance from credit card to throw in another round :) (I hope not!)

Wtf is this shit apple. Why you gotta do me like this
Great that all the major etfs are overleveraged so much on apple that it tanks the fucking entire market so hard that even boomer stocks panic sell
anyone play acb puts? :( IV still nuts lol
269, DAMN SHE FINE
Actually a lot of PCs already had this features
Anyone else use Yahoo Finance charts for trading?
I was expecting more from AAPL, these $125 calls are garbage lol
I hope so! They had INSANE earnings last time and dropped so it's not fool proof, but I feel they SHOULD moon it's just whether they will...
Apple has basically recession-proofed it’s business with this shit. Leaps for days
😂
I do agree
Shame or Same?😒
Is this free? Like, can I use this? Incredible
HE SAID ZOOOOOOM CALLS ON ZOOOOOM
Are MM’s gonna pull a Lebron on Dan Gilbert and RKT this afternoon?
I managed to make some tendies form rkt , last time I trade that shit stock
Nah you know he dumped all those quarters back in and lost it all after turning off the camera
Like I said this event was entirely to kill the Greeks on my puts
Apple and cringe ads - name a more iconic duo
ROTATE. ZOOM.
my dad works for stonks and he said apple is going to go to the moon
Reasons:
Biden reversal? = fuk Chyna

Tank stocks until Trump out of office?

Dump before earnings?

Most likely reason:
You jinxed it and now you fucked me. I hate you.
My entire account balance would be much higher if I just held all my PLUG leaps
So NIO 69c? Got it
New York city going on lockdown would be the rug pull the bears need. Mayor is threatening lockdown if people don't get their shit together. Spoiler: they won't.
Man fuck aapl
Apple needs to ditch the shit airhead music they use in their events
Y'all think this is really it for them? Like obviously they're overvalued as a motherfucker but I'm sure a vaccine wouldn't be ready for rollout for like a year yet. Plenty of time for a lockdown between then and now
I think about buying one from cmp regularly but never end up doing it.  Ever shot one?
YUPPPPP
Apple is the fruitiest company ever
this video is retarded as fuck.
Now. That 90 percent vaccine efficacy is bs.

Will arkw continue its descent
boring event KEKW
The bulls don’t just fuck the wives my friend.
Picked up some $39 calls myself for next week. Although I see it can run back up to at least 42-44, possible new highs.
Please stop showing game performance.
DD: 4/16/21 ALSK 5c

Small about of capital on these calls. Company being bought out for ~$3 per share, management intends to shop around. Purchase multiple very low comped to precedent transactions. Market currently pricing in ~10% chance of a bidding war, seems low to me. 10-1 risk/reward.

[further reading](https://yetanothervalueblog.com/2020/11/quickie-idea-update-alaska-communications-alsk.html)
Why is the structured like an infomercial?
wow I have never been so depressed by a chart.
"Yes, son, and probably a lot more than you."
Apple paying actors to pretend to be SWE to tell everyone how great it is to have to do more work just to get their existing shit to work on a new processor.
Sooo much faster.  Smooth. Soo so fast guys. Fucking dump it
I went from 4.7k to 35k back down to 4k
I don’t know that was so stupid
CRSR is trading for what i bought it for like 3 weeks ago. I sure hope it gains some momentum after that earnings, but so far, not much can be done against the fat sell off today

Apple going to cause the market to bleed further...

Thanks Tim Bear
It must be nice to have a $100 million to play with.
More like 106-108 and possibly lower

Never too much for a yolo. Put entire portfolio in pussy

Going to sell my apple shares at the next peak, graphics are fucking dogshit on the M1

Damn apple, this shit sucks ass

Why?! Im pretty sure it will moon
Hyln you low volume piece of shit

Can this dip chill? Jeez
I got a 37c for jan 2022
Here's hoping
Baaaaaan him!!!!!
True - I play as wizard, boomer af
OK so apple makes their computers/phones and their processors. And they make the OS and own the store that sells all the software for their products.


They are basically begging the EU to fine the absolute fuck out of them.
Mango was right, AAPL screens are too small
Lmao what a lame event...
Tech is fraudulent
cringe cringe cringe...and I am an engineer..
What isnt dope is transitioning customers who don't know shit about architecture to a new architecture.
Accurate
i made bank on LOW $115 calls two ER's ago...shouldve fucking held lol now its at $156 and probably way overvalued at this price
Apple dumping the whole fucking market lmao.
> You can still afford plane tickets?

It's now cheaper to fly out from Denver than it is to go through the tolls to get to the Denver airport.
Don’t fuck with the mouse
i'm in
Wrong
What are you talking about? The public float is 198 million.
honestly max out your credit cards, its basically free money
Yes it went down today but look at the recovery already.

Smarter people than me are predicting great things for NIO and I believe them. I believe this stock could hit 400. The current price is inflated, sure, but also justified, considering where this stock is headed in the next few years.

So yeah, buy more if you're holding long term. If you want short term gains, I don't know what to tell you, because that shit is glorified gambling (like this whole sub lol).

Red days are always a good time to buy.
Why does apple insist on doing all these fucking events, never goes well
Very nice. That play can't go wrong.
This was predictable..
Implied move of + or -10% on DKNG for earnings as of yesterday’s close.  Will refuckulate that number Thursday afternoon.

This AAPL event is a nothing burger. Cool, I can run all these programs at once. When in reality no ones runs all those programs at once. They’re doing homework or making a shit video on final cut
Priced in, the home improvement frenzy is over now
Lmao a lot of people don’t even now what Apple is talking about.
This is even more uncomfortable to watch than battery day
Cant fucking walk away for 5 minutes
THIS is what apple has been working on????? LMAO wtf have the engineers of the computer division been doing
It's already priced in lol.
PUT YOUR Shirt BUTTONZ on
I don’t know how to take this :(
I'm liking NVDA. Wish I had money to play it. Got quite a bit in NIO leaps right now
Now, Literally any negative news what so ever will plunge that bitch back into the darkness.

anyone have positions in EBAY?
among us on mac? try steam idiot
Normally, not too low, cuz it'll sell off overnight. I do believe it has a good 6 points or more to give before it inevitably bounces back.
How does Apple turn every event into a flop...they should've just combined all three recent events into one. Steve Jobs wouldn't have let this BS pass

If AAPL M1 is so great why is the stock not mooning ?
[removed]
Had a very good couple of days playing ZM. Ready to lose everything on NVDA
Why would you sell them puts lmao it’s gonna dump after the event hard
But he stated a fact....that option was not liquid at all. Doesnt mean it can't get become more liquid with higher volume if/when price starts moving.
Invest right before Thanksgiving for max ROI
Still pissed I went with F. When GM moons F only creeps.
SPAC’s been good to me too mong. Shut up fam no wonder I’m bag holding bro I’m hardly even down I copped at 280$ pussio

Blown away by this new tech AAPL is unveiling.  AAPL to 200 sometime in 2021.
More money on the short term calls, but also a lot more risk
I'm in on this too I feel retarded.
There’s no source referenced.
AAPL always targets artists. Why not gamers Tim Apple?
I think about m1 finance
Alibaba's fabricated sales numbers break previous record for fabricated sales numbers
Sony go 📉📉 then it’ll go 📈📈 in 2 days to 105
NTES consistent growth and earning coming up get ur calls while it dips

I’m holding. Market has been up 10% one week and down 10% the next for the last 4 weeks. Could go either way but this stock crushed earnings and next quarter will be even better.  Even without covid, connected fitness is a new trend that is developing.  Vaccine timing just fucked this play...
We gonna close on the lows today
I laughed so hard with BABAnkrupt! xD
I still dont understand how nios market cap is twice that of Ford.

Its a fucking meme stock that doesnt even make anything
Lol
/doubt
Wow literally began dropping the minute I sold my puts WHAT THE FUK
Aww yiss, this is what i need, just a two bagger, 3 would be nice but ill take 2 for now, mmmk?
It's going to crash like it does after every other apple event
What ever happened to Portnoy, is that retard still losing money on the market?
Tell me he ACUTALLY SAID THAT.  PLEASE
Anyone playing RXT earnings tonight?!?? That bomb ass DD was posted late last night at the perfect time before todays dip buying opportunity!!!!
LMAO thanks to all the AAPL bag holders, yall obvious are amateurs thinking apple stock can go up beacuse of an event
[deleted]
AAPL sliding. How low it will go EOD?
They should hire a comfortable public speaker like a Ryan Seacrest type. These speakers are super cringe.

Weed has consistently been my top performer over the last 18 months. 

It’s ThetaGang’s wet dream - the volatility is through the roof but it doesn’t actually go anywhere.
Exactly, and if you advance too much you aren’t retarded anymore
99% of people I know have one or the other. I have both bc im an audio engineer. That’s it. Mac had a nice UI. Outside of what I use it for, all these specs are useless.
AAPL PUTS NOW!
GG
Rkt boys either in lambo or rope tonight
Yo that dude definitely fucks his MacBook
Hold it though... that’s what retards do.
Haha
I want to drink umbrella rum drinks with this guy in Aruba.
Can someone explain what will make more money on a run up today like NIO.. if I had bought 40$ calls expiring this Friday OR January?
No
INTRODUCING... Apple Mac SuperMega Pro
Even the game displayed was lagging
Thanks for the info, OP!

Fake dump on apple!! BEAR TRAP! Don’t fall for it. Apple 120 eod
Never
I only ask cause I started last fall and nobody told me late summer/early fall are usually the dead months.
So you’re the cunt who jinxed it. Go fuck yourself
Why did he open the MacBook like that?

AMZN calls for ez 10k tmrw but I'm broke so I bought shares
Don't. Wish I never got into RKT.
God dammit Apple about to make nasdaq tank even more can just feel it
Why did that game look so laggy
Yes but they didnt continue to use those words medically like retard until 2010 when [Rosa law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa%27s_Law) passed.

And you’re right. It’s just a step under which isn’t any better. Imagine being black and having a disability in the early 1900s, completely fucked. Just cause they didn’t teach you it in school since the population is smaller doesn’t mean it happened. People with disabilities were abandoned, killed or taken away from their families. [source](https://sites.google.com/site/changesintheviewsofdisability/treatment-of-disabled-people-throughout-history). Also the people with disabilities act didn’t pass until 1990 so they could actively be discriminated against until then.

yeah it should like when it’s used in this subreddit it’s funny af but all I was tryna say is it’s still used against them.
Lol that game looked like 15fps
I agree but problem is nothing seems correct in this retard market. Hopefully PLTR breaks this earnings chain curse
lol that game was laggy KEK
Yeah I’m stoked for mine
Went from discussing crushes on big titty bitches to discussing crushes on implied volatility, momma we made it 😎
Idk what the fuck you just wrote but if you’re asking if you should take a position or go cash then why are you even here?
Has been for a long while. Boomer equipment. Simplistic to a fault.
💦🍆
This would just be a horizonal line in a real portfolio
Wants you to know he doesn’t even own a tie
This sell off after the event is gonna be glorious. This event is wank so far
Should I get out of my 11/20 CRSR 35c?

Chest hairs are in brah
Next year
Last time ER was sort of priced in, with early release.
Logic suggests that we should shoot back up to 30+ range AH.
But this is RKT we’re talking about.
This AAPL guy didn't button his top three shirt button to set the mood.
I’m not able to watch the event, is it just on apple silicon and new Mac books?
No way that’s 4.5 seconds free fall (99m jump), world record cliff jump is 58m ~ 3.5 sec fall. Watching the video seems closer to 3 sec fall
[removed]
just got done fucking your mom
For me it would be great. I sometimes sell weekly covered calls OTM. 

Also, the market is heated a bit. Nothing wrong with catching a breather.

This fucker Craig needs to button his shirt, did he just get head from Tim apple or something?
The biggest question for today is rocket RKT heading to the 🚀🌕or to the earth's core?
Damn this event is boring
I’m up 160% but I’ve been in the position since their earnings so tailor this to your needs. Or just full autist and follow blindly, your call.
#BEARS GOT FUCKED
Craig!!!
Oof. This did not age well.
Bruh I wish I could've done that. I tried selling when it peaked the 2nd time but robhinhood didn't let me. Hopefully it peaks tomorrow or Thursday

You buying today too?
You’re completely right but the support for $353 is looking to be strong...hopefully tomorrow won’t fuck me.
It’s poised to beat earnings. I’m balls deep in OTM calls
Good thing about tutes is that part of them bought in higher than current SP so we’re unlikely to tank hard.
This is a discussion thread for people looking for stock tips. You could have used any other term eg. Dudes, Bros, fellas, and still made your point. 

Consider this a stock tip, to help you stay out of the red. If you were to use that term in any other setting, you might not get the guidance im providing you. 

My next tip, proof read your comments before posting, and when engaging someone with a disagreement, address their ideas, rather than insulting the person.
Watching AAPL event on my PC like 🥘👄🥘
Already locking out intel users.   Yeah, puts short term, long term leaps
Anyone’s back ever locked up on them? Dead srs tell me what you did to get better I can’t fucking move. I had to shit earlier and I couldn’t even get my hand around my back
M1 better bring some games to mac. Gaming so shit in a mac

Solar and Weed are SO 24 hrs ago. Jk, but seriously long term bullish, short term I think people get worried when some of these stocks double and triple in value in 3 days. Just ride the waves.
RKT gonna be at 21.60 for all of eternity at this rate
No fear
I don’t disagree with long term at all. Eventually games will be available for mac. Not sure what the hold up has been for years though. Anyway, short term call holders fucked.
AAPL doing work
Doot
Deserve it pigs get slaughtered, big hulk dick coming to diccc you down
M1 baby
if you wanna long weed apha is your best bet(lps), acb is trash. but i'd avoid pot stocks in general

Money not found.
It depends. Last year, there wasn’t a sell off at year end. In 2018, there was a huge sell off towards the year end
This is exactly why it's not mooning. "fastest integrated graphics" doesn't mean shit.

Last time it ran to fuckin 34 AH before dumping down. Shits stuck 21.60 now

Omg spy is finally going to help me get some money back

Oh cool the new MacBooks have powerful integrated graphics.

Now I can play all those games that Mac doesn't fucking have.

Let’s say if it’s over 30 tomorrow you get the tat? Is that moon enough for ya?
[deleted]
Obviously earnings are going to be amazing. Convincing myself it’ll be up 20% or more after earnings and will double soon... institutional ownership is at almost 37%. Why do institutions purchase stocks? If RKT does manage to use tech to get 25% or the mortgage market I think the big banks want a part of that. With growth in market share, this could be up bigly
that stupid FAA news making the algos flip
Been wondering the same, think it’s more to do with EA underperforming so bad the last few months and just being closer to support than anything.
No
I guess I need to get burned a couple of times to learn my lesson.
There’s still hope.
Intel is immediately in shambles lol
M1 is gonna rip this shit UP
this happens every time LOL
Apple guy showed a chart for their cpu shit from 2012 to 2020 and the line is basically linear...

No way this shit is better than AMD
We've always been #1 in SoC's, since A4.
hmm yeah i dont think itd be too worth it to hold, might just be better to realize gains nio is a stock that trades flat for a week then moons and considering it already has yesterday it has a low chance of mooning again, there will be an earnings run up but i cant guarantee itll be before friday
Not sure if it matters but the new CoD is getting tons of hate and it should. 8 maps on release and the movement feels like they went back 5 years.
So the AAPL event is about a chip? How much did AAPL tank?
Don’t you have some cocks to suck you fucking neo cuck
Long term this company is an absolute buy.  ARM is the future.
Everybody talking bout rkt blasting so ima put my puts in right now so you guys can benefit
Is it time to buy amazon? Or do you guys think itll decrease more? Is amazon overvalued? Are they really that dependent on quarantine?

Lol I took my $23 gain today on my 1 call to avoid this 😂
M1 > Intel > AMD
I just went long on QQQ with no day trades I think I'm an idiot
when can I play call of duty on a mac dammit
That’s what I thought for the last RKT earnings and got badly burned, but here I am again, I just feel like this thing is waiting to pop
God. If only. Then I could cash out the puts and calls I sold at an early profit.
This guy sounds smart
What good is all this performance on the MacBook if their target market for it is pretty small? Gamers use pc. Their largest market is video editors.
Thank you. Makes me miss  @ midnight /w Chris Hardwick.

There wasn’t a ton of hype or run up for AAPL event so I don’t see it tanking. At least not as hard as other events

Why buy a car when you can buy all the parts individually and build it yourself? Because most people don’t want to do that shit, Apple is targeting a completely different demographic

ALL IN ON APPLE PUTS LETS GOOOOOO

Mine was doing some weird shit earlier.
Corn gang making bank
Yes
nvidia come back my calls got till friday. 565 calls
[removed]
Thankfully, I actually bought during this dip, not at the bottom but at like $42 I think. Bought at $32, then $34 now some more at $42. Pretty crazy I had some at $16 and $19 (and many others here at $2 or less) but still, trying to make sure I get some modest gains from stocks while I try to use some options to make more risky plays. 

Wish I would've sold my 6 bagger ACB call yesterday...
Do we hold this hot garbage or cut our losses?
I think it'll touch 260 again sometime this week. If you're talking about leap then yes maybe

But did they make it pretty?
Cool

Why did AMD lose a weeks worth of gains?!

I’m a bit late to this post but could anyone help me out? I went to the doctor a few months ago have 158 AST levels and 45 ALT. Bilirubin levels are 1.5 so slightly elevated. She called me and said that points to alcoholic hepatitis. I read a study that was conducted saying the levels I have are consistent with acute alcoholic hepatitis, but haven’t been officially diagnosed so I’m not sure. 

I’ve been a heavy drinker for years. Functioning and working but drinking every night. I am having an enormously difficult time quitting. I’ve cut back but haven’t yet been able to kick the habit. 

I’m a bit scared. No jaundice yet, but I am experiencing abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and sometimes hand shakes. 

Does anyone have any information on if what I’m reading is accurate, and if Im on my way to death? 

I don’t know if my numbers are something to be terrified of or if it’s something that at this point is reversible. 

Or any way to get involved in the trials you were talking about? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Lol the type of people that buy Apple products don't care about a computer chip

Heard that before. If people only did that
Im not playing AAPL anymore lost so much last month! Its gonna dump after event again!!
so looks like getting rid of covid is not good for the market and economy.
Spot bloody on!
Dump after
Hmm M1 actually sounds sick
You're right that "Investors" will be skeptical short term.
  
But I think the key message that the CCP is sending is "we won't let our markets fill up with risky Chinese shit just because we can dümp it on foreigners"
  
And I think that message is a positive one even if it implies that the current market is already full of shit. Then again everyone knows the current market is very risky...
I second this
in 10 years going to ARM will be seen as the moment AAPL turned rotten.
Ready to get fucked by RKT again.
It shouldn’t happen. Like it shouldn’t have happened last time. 
But it will, lol. This is the way...
What is an opportunity cost?
lol amd why u doing me dirty
NO USER ADDITIONS.  Can't add ram.  SHORT IT
You’re the man just figured it out thank you I was already over this bullshit lol
“Ohhhh XERXES SCISSOR ME TIMBERS”

Imagine Tim apple saying that haha
That M1 is crazy. Apple leaps NOW. TSMC too, if they're building it.
Lololol this sub in a nut shell
Theta gang would be fine
M1 !
Cuz most people are interested in building their own computer
Anyone ever heard of RESN? Or know anything about them?
You’re logic is too early. Wait til interest rates go back up in 2022-2023.
Nice little dip right after I said that.
I feel like I’m watching a fucking video game intro in campaign mode this fucking Apple event.
How is SNOw still pinned at $240? Smh
BABA calls at EOD?
Now if PLTR could turn on the jets I can be happy
I feel you on the JD.. im hopeing it goes up 6$ atleast before earnings

Earnings season has been such a shit show im scared for rkt honestly.
MM today did a BIG fucking shake out so they could pick up the juicy stock (NIO, CRSR, PLTR) for super cheap before mooning them again. Scary how much power the big boys have this game is fucking rigged
Share price is too high.
Well, they're about to fuck up nasdaq again after this gay event so it's only fitting
Hahaha probably otherwise we’d see 50 DD’s “THIS IS THE NEXT TESLA (of sweaters)”

LEAPS has been my play with some of these WSB hype, but also a legit stock types.

IMO, this is not investing advice, I dunno wtf I'm talking about, I didn't know this was a lord of the rings sub

Yolo $AMD because Apple will use them
Imagine buying a Mac when you can build a much better computer with nvidia, AMD and Corsair parts
Your post history is concerning dude. It seems like you've lost a few hundred - few thousand although hard to be 100% sure based on your posts. Take a step back, get out of the market for a while. Stop taking on so much risk. Do some boring investing and keep only a small % of your portfolio in your gambling account. You got this!
Who cares Tim crook show us the goods
mmmmm
This is representative of overpopulation (especially in impoverished areas) more than anything imo.

Hey friend, I just want to tell you that you can do it. Spreads are a great way to claw your way back (try to target 0.25 to 0.3 entries, so you get a 4x to 3x gain out of them).

damn, opposite for me
Who the actual fuck would buy anything other than puts  AFTER seeing that first chart?

The following flowchart is brought to you by Kang Gang
      
Are you gay?

Yes-->Buy Puts

No-->Sell everything and run
Risking 40k to make 2k every 2 days on SPY $8 OTM put credit spreads  seems perfectly reasonable yeah? One wrong move and you're out sure, but only need to be right 20x in a row to net 100%. Given each trade is a 50% probability of being right just for thought, that's a whopping 9.5367431640625 × 10\^-7 probability of getting all 20 right. I dont see anything that can go wrong :)

I was pretty pumped when I woke up and saw CCL at 20.25 this morning
These guys are truly retarded. They could have at least dumped the positions onto a shell companies books and booked a profit on their own, instead of bag holding. Corporate finance 101
More or less yes.  But the other 99% of the time stocks aren't moving 20% or more in a day, theta is money.

Well, I did ask for someone to change my mind. I still don't see large upside even for the holidays. Most have already made their purchases by now and will by eom. Just wait and see, if I'm right ill remind you.

What the hell is this
Guys this isnt funny. Every single tech chart look exactly the same, shits super rigged.
what is 22B MC?
No this shit goes in cycles.  It has nothing to do with the word itself, but the meaning behind it.  If you make up a new word that means mentally disabled(which is already out of favor btw) then that one becomes an insult, so then you make another ect.  Even the "N" word wasn't nearly the insult it's become.  It was derived from the spanish word "negro"(pronounced neh-grow) and just means black.  The bad version is Americans' butchered attempt to say it.  Over time, it of course became an insult because the people being called that, were not respected, and were specifically not respected *because* they were black.
Long in the tooth, closing in on 2 standard deviations, for this rally on the downward channel. Nonetheless, if it can get above 34.88, algos will either confirm 📈or deny📉Til then, look out for 32.05 & good luck!

OP, did it work for you?
I've been bag holding hundreds of share of SPR (Spirit Aerosystems), they're a major component supplier to Boeing. Closed Friday at $21.71. Currently trading at $30.53. 52-week high is $92.81.
You can even go back to forums when the original iPod or iPhone launched. People acted like they were the stupidest shit to have ever been invented.
CHINA RICH PUMP THAT SHIT
Rocken some pretty 🏳️‍🌈 positions right now
Rip my NIO calls. well, some gains still, still up like 15% on my $40 1/15/2021 but down like 7% on my 2/19/21 $50c. I have faith since I bought LEAPs (not sure if 3 months is considered a leap)
FUCK STFU TIM SHOW US THE MAC
don't turn into a pickle!
I swear if apple doesn’t dump on this event I’m gonna be pissed lmao
I’m playing as well. Have been adding since <10 and this dip was much too tempting lol

Nope, December 3rd
If it costs the company money they won’t do it. New hires aren’t performing well in a WFH environment. Team projects are of lower quality. People who WFH are experiencing higher workloads and longer hours. The primary positive of WFH is that it’s allowed work to continue during covid.
so everyone is very quiet about PLTR. right time to buy those leaps I guess

Can you suggest things I should learn to get to the path of being useful in the field?

Theory time. Next week SPY reaches 380  after a few Trump announcements
> A true gold standard is redeemable for gold, vs a fractional reserve system where someone can print more money than they have in reserves

So in a "true" gold standard the branches always have that amount of gold? What if someone spends money elsewhere, or moves a billion dollars to a new city? And the bank never prints "too much" money for an area?

> Long term, gold has been stable

Here's what the crash in gold looked like in the mid-1970s… The gold price fell by almost half. And it wasn't short-lived, as it lasted for a year and eight months.  What are people supposed to do when their money is worth half as much for a year and eight months? I notice you stopped answering questions. Worse, what are people supposed to do when their money value *doubles* in a year or two? Pay people half as much when businesses will still charge the same prices for food?

> But since you're attempting to pull money from the value-added activity 

This contradicts... you. You already said that people print money willy-nilly, so no money is taken from a value-added activity necessarily.

Yes, I would like to hear you define what you consider an "irrational" act is. Give an example of someone committing an irrational act, please.
Tim Apple doesn’t sound good in this event - either sick or just old as fuck.

Just so I understand “theta gang”.....anyone selling puts on Zoom this past week lost thousands trying to make hundreds, correct?
CVS broke $70 and is lingering, past the sell orders. Get in before it keeps climbing.
BABA maybe there is hope? they've already broken their record for singles day, although historically its never done much for their stock price. But hey, nothing makes sense anymore?

Idk I'd normally buy apple puts for their shitty disappointment events but I feel like they could report how many new iPhones they sold. How much pre-order demand there was, how many accessories people bought with it etc. I'm not bothering with the risk rn.
Yea that could happen but I really do think NIO beats expectations. EPS beat and guidance are pretty much guaranteed this ER and I’m not sure if other people are aware
Just checked only bonds are closed.

Lots of info in the FAQ or at r/options

You understand what happens if you get assigned those puts?  That would be my first research topic.
Tim Appleeeeeeee our boy
Any ITM a month out is an easy double by tomorrow
That’s a little early to be calling him out lol
11/27/2020 BUD $65P

Look at the 6 month chart. I mean, I guess it could continue climbing at this rate (or just park itself at $65-67 for 3 weeks), but I doubt it. If it gets to $60.00 at expiry, that's a 270% gain.
Who what when where
ARM architecture will allow the intro of lower priced, high performance and low power consumption SKUs --> address wider market and new leg of growth --> load up on puts i have no idea
Why is REV exploding today
Please no more shitty presentations. Save my calls
The old me would’ve sold my failing calls at open but the new me diamond hands until they recover 😏
Prpl gang ded tho
I picked these up mid day on Friday, I picked them up bc it had just hit its resistance and had a history of nose diving after doing so.
JD calls
This sounds a whole lot like you buying shares.
It never hit 46, I was praying it would. I sold mine yesterday at the peak $45.
I know AAPL typically dumps after these, but I’m feeling a pump today. These laptops have been widely anticipated—I think Apple is going to impress.
Right I sold my CCL puts this AM for only 20% gains could’ve been 100%+
China EV industry is booming, everyone knows how polluted the air is and people will eventually learn that the govt is pushing clean energy/ vehicles by 2025. They bail out their own companies over foreign companies, and govt will always favor chinese companies over foreign companies.

More people have huewei over apple,
And more people will have a nio,xpeng,li over a tesla. 

DD for all those that think china EV is luckin coffee lol
Puts
buy **BA**, it is going to $300, why? 1) any one holding is not going to sell 2) MAX approval imminent and 3) short covering
Around this time yesterday I was super nervous about my puts printing 
Today I’m a fucking cucumber waiting to double my profits.
Fuck, gonna inverse with calls brb
Holy shit was that a rainbow?
Bud shut the fuck up with this type of commentary. You explain it to us why AMZN is going to be at 2500. You don't say "pay attention to something" without any possible information.

Going to spend like $2,500 on Amazon this Christmas.

B2B, Amazon Music, Twitch growth with Podcasts streaming there, AWS, the logistics side with Prime. Literally shut up.

You think they are hiring another 100k workers for funsies?

Lol yeah you got fucked. If it makes you feel any better I bought baba leaps yesterday and down 40% in a single day
You’re expecting it not to? Have you seen any other event?

what, you mean you don't think NIO is going to 2000 EOW?
AAPL is gonna sell off after the event and fuck over the entire tech sector again isnt it
We print it digitally 😎
there may still be hope. baba has already broken their singles day record a couple hours in. historically its done nothing for their stock price, but hey, nothing makes sense anymore
Nkla discloses sec investigation. Barely dumps. People still buying even lol. Man consumer vehicle not even a sure thing lol. This all makes sense.
Just fucking buy a peloton bike at this point if you’re that obsessed with them

Welp I have 1 stock already, where do i sell.
What holiday?
Sold:
Sold off COP yesterday for a nice 20% gain. Sold SLB today for another nice 20% gain. 

Bought: 
I bought CATM yesterday @ $21.45 (currently up 2.63%).
I bought BIIB today @ $239.95 (currently roughly even).

Holds:
I am still holding onto BLUE bought @ $46.85 (currently down 0.64%).
Imagine having meme calls and lottery 0dte and winning tons
If AAPL tanks after this fucking event I swear to fucking god......
Other things too, including yield curve steepening. Curve flattened drastically from 11/2 to 11/4 and is steepening again with changing economic recovery expectations.   


This hurts growth companies and favors value. I'm banking on an overreaction, yet again, and that if big money leaves China tech it will go into US tech. Been long US tech for many years and selling the leaders and buying the laggers for pops since March.

My logic is that the market will implode sometime before that unless the feds keep manipulating it, which they probably will so I only bought cheap puts as far out enough for me not to care about price but still within a logical strike range based on the last crash
This dude has been spamming the thread non stop with nio price targets lol

Man, you are doing a really good job losing here, and it's clear you're getting desperate.

A true gold standard is redeemable for gold, vs a fractional reserve system where someone can print more money than they have in reserves. Strawman.

Long term, gold has been stable, but as I had previously noted, money is based on a commodity, so if there's a sudden influx in the volume of the commodity, the price would drop. We've already covered this, you're still losing.

Wheelchair... strawman again...

Opportunity cost is when choosing between two value-added activities that would generate a return, and the allocation of resources into one activity keeps you from doing another. But since you're attempting to pull money from the value-added activity and put it into a non-value-added activity, you're just at a loss.

Money needs to buy goods. If nothing is produced, there are no goods to buy. So the money goes nowhere, and if you print more money, there's higher money supply with fewer goods to purchase - hyper inflation. 

It sure is. You're in a cult. Run, my friend.

Somewhere between 45-50, don't think it goes higher (won't complain if it does tho lol)
They beat ER big time but price slowly went down (didn’t tank) and was mostly flat so calls and puts both got wiped
buy **BA**, it is going to $300, why? 1) any one holding is not going to sell 2) MAX approval imminent and 3) short covering
Sure why not
When it gets to $300. Seems like it stops there to pick up fuel then continues its trek upward
Dude, did you miss the productivity boom that happened and all the managers concerns about WFH getting settled through forced implementation? WFH in conjunction with the office is absolutely here. Pure WFH no, but a far more blended roll absolutely. Which means continued doubling up on equipment purchases and an increased need for cyber security implementation.

The fact that your counter is so wrong makes me feel better about mine.

AMD has a path forward with their advanced GPU technology. They will be hitting a wall with their CPUs soon just like Intel. 

Apple likely won’t sell their CPUs outside their ecosystem, but may be able to use their CPUs to expand their ecosystem.  

ARM/NVIDIA will continue to dominate the rest of the market.

Yeah I guess I forgot about the recent arm acquisition. Maybe it's plausible in the case of Nvidia but I don't see Apple joining the race at all. For the last decades they have been concentrating making products for their own eco. And AMD has been playing all the right cards since Lisa Su became CEO. If anything I agree with you is the part where Intel becomes less and less relevant.
You bought a put at the bottom?
thank you, sire
LOL no
Wtf is apple gonna do

Sounds pretty straightforward. Just don’t hold onto your ITM options thru expiry.

Had the same idea before, however, TQQQ could theoretically be halted and eliminated at any time if the market ever crash crashes. It's built on derivatives, like call options, so there's always natural time decay and fees. Not shitting on the idea, just actively monitor it and know your exposure.

You watched the Big Short too many times.

Buying a put on an index is not a bet against the American economy. A credit default swap was because mortgages formed the backbone of the economy.. and those retarded douches leveraged that shit 20 times over and held as it was failing.

very excited to see nio 55 eom, 100+ eoy, and 300+ by jan 2022
Are you actually retarded? I guess you were not scarred enough by previous earnings when they were trading around 30, beat the fuck out of estimates and dropped almost every single day afterwards
I very rarely cry, but I was actually brought to tears today at how much of a failure I’ve become. Just feel like younger me would be so disappointed
Lol, that would be a crazy buy in point

I guess you’ve already heard it. When they do go down to an IPO, it’s gonna be all snowflaky
Just insert more coins and you’d be fine :)
Charger sold separately
Don't buy it
Worried about RKT tanking after earnings, only meme stock I have shares of. Too scared to buy options and loss money faster.
Don’t time shares if you’re trying to hold. Just buy the shit if you think it’s going to heaven. Waiting and gambling on buying 800 worth of shares at a 5 dollar discount ain’t worth risking losing current price. Hop on the rocket now. Open your fkin app this instant and throw down king
I’m down 50% I can’t device if I should sell Apple ten minutes and grab puts or hold
IVR crushed earnings. They are slowly pumping
Lost it at "Might do this full time" lmao
no im still up 26% fuck NIO

You can...once.

Just sell a call at a higher strike than your position to lock in some gains
If you didn’t buy the NIO dip, you ain’t black

Got I fucking wish I could call my co workers retards in my email 😡
I’ve already profited decently. Greeks are for retards
Too bad it’s pay to win
"Let your losers run."
I’m at -$28 today, balls deep in NIO and wondering whether I should be happy or not. Only thing saving me are my ZM puts. 

ZM 100 EOW (ZM 300 11/13)
NIO 50 EOD ( NIO 50 11/13)

Fight me
No that’s why I’m asking you guys
Spy is disassociating from tech bullish
Check the news
This time it’s different
when a company thats been private for a long ass time and never turned a profit randomly goes public i will always assume their goal is to fuck the shit out of braindead retail 

but thats just me, i am also one of the braindeads, i cannot be trusted
upvote if you're retarded
it will increase as earnings approach, but if you get strikes around $90 they're guaranteed to print. I havent had any trouble getting my call orders filled
I buy tech stocks based on how much people at r/cscareerquestions freak out over getting interviews with that company. Found it to be excellent strategy thus far
OK boomer
You will be worked like a dog and be 100% consumed by work. It’s a living nightmare. Pay is good though! 5/10

Ur supposed to hold till they are worthless
Over reaction. Great buying opportunity imo. Loaded up on 270 1/15/21 calls

It’s was for a meme post awhile back I said I would but 120 of them and I have actually managed to sell like 80 idk how
I averaged down on APPS yesterday and QQQ.  Turns out I was a day early.  FML.  At least I didn't do anything stupid today and I'm just riding these calls till expiry at this point.  Don't have to trade everyday, gotta keep reminding myself that.  If there's nothing there and shit is unsettled with no clear movement just wait.
You sure about that?
Calls on tesla?
Amd calls cheap rn

[deleted]
There’s not always as clear of a channel like Amzn... I think people have always been unsure how to value Amzn because of their crazy growth and extreme profit reinvestment so they’ve just collectively kind of put it on a track and let it go. 

The Apple chart isn’t nearly as clean, so I think it is driven more by real-world numbers, than just like, inertia of mass psychology. 

I also fully admit I have no idea what I’m talking about
bro same here lol. too bad I was already all in or I woulda never listened

Aurora cannabis just dropped over 20%
USA has the greatest economy in the world, and there are scrubs here who think it is a good idea to bet against it 🇺🇸

What can we expect from Becton Dickinson Stock from the news of the vaccine. I believe they produce the most syringes in the world and probably have the capacity to help contain the virus but would this dramatically increase their stock. High demand for needles and their appears to be a shortage so it looks great but I’m no expert

As I said, it's an alternative food for vegans, it's not a meat substitute for meat eaters. The people I was responding to kept arguing it's a replacement for meat, by citing how it's got a lower carbon footprint than meat. But the people who like it and keep eating it aren't people switching from meat to eat it. It's people who are already on vegan/vegetarian diets. So the carbon footprint should be compared to the carbon footprint of less processed, natural plant protein meals. 

Personally, I'd love to see McDonald's have more bean and other plant protein products. But that would require that they make it super tasty with spices and sauces, and Americans aren't used to that. 

Once people realize that this product appeals to vegans and not to meat eaters who would voluntarily pay a high price for a dismal beef substitute, then it becomes more obvious how limited BM's market penetration is and why its stock shouldn't be going through the roof. Beyond Meat would be more successful, IMO, if their burgers were half the price (or 2-for-1) of beef burgers, which they should be

Yeah I've been looking into videos on options but I keep feeling like ik going to fuck up ha
You forgot to mention they have 200M outstanding shares, but only 35M public float. Alot of authorized shares to dump on all these autists. This is not a good play.
False. They sell over 50% of all CPUs already. 

NVIDIA actually just acquired ARM. ARM produces over 50% of all CPUs. Just not desktop or laptop. 

Apple was the original founder of ARM. They created their own ARM based processor. They cut IBM and now Intel. They are using their own processors in their phones, watches, and tablets already. Now they are going to use their processors in their laptops and desktops. 

Look up the fall off IBM, that shit is happening again with Intel. ARM > i86 > PowerPC. Mobile devices first, then consumer hardware, and finally servers will be replaced.
When does that end again

In this market? Very likely. I expect a eod pump
\-85% loss with some time to recover a few extra $$$

Why would I be upset I accepted this risk when I made the trade 🤷
Check out FLDM. Solid day trade entry point. Excellent chart.
not retarded just hold through the red days or double down
Here is why I am bullish and willing to hold long term.

**Monetization of customer data** \- possible 600M EBITDA if leveraged correctly. Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.

**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the "beat AMZN' part of the business model.

**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)

**Online ad revenue.** From website + App

**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.

Massive **reduction in SG&A.**

**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.

'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.

Gaming industry TAM is growing YoY.

Competent management team. Finally.

Bigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.

&#x200B;

This is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11

I think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)

When it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.
it was the Dow jones news wire market watch update at 10:56 about beyonce that just ignited the stock. crazy.

PTON is up.  Shall I sell 11/20 120 call?
Any earnings today?
OPK is mooning pretty much my only green stock
I mean, so were idiot, imbecile, and moron right? 

Also, we don’t have an extensive history or taking retards from the continent of retardica and forcing them as slaves to build our society and then fucking them with inequalities. That comparison is pretty shit. 

Also also, almost anyone can become retarded by damaging their brain. I personally think it should be a universal word we use like idiot and imbecile, but I also understand how the word can be sensitive sometimes. Still think the way to go is the former though.

By the time grand kids are around 364 will be long forgotten lol.
Hasn’t really moved in anticipation of earnings so I don’t think it would plummet AH? But who knows...I took a $22c
>thinking bulls lose

BVLLS keep fucking your GF for like 10 years and then bears get like 3 months of being hot shit. You had your time in Feb-Apr.
So much this
I trust nio 10x more
It feels liberating.

Actually that is kind of retarded. You are doing that all for $0.06/share?
Who knew you had to buy the Tupperware dip
Bulls hold the line. Don’t fall for this obvious bear Trap

Oh never mind. I thought you were shorting the stock, not writing covered calls.

First of all, I don't really like him. Definitely not as a person. But what I don't like even more is the current state of politics. I want it to change. Joe Biden is a political puppet. He's been making deals for so long, who knows who he owes what to. He certainly owes his party. Besides that, he's probably just a bad on a personal level as Trump, just not in the same way. I think Trump has done more good than he'll ever get credit for. Both parties are basically against him as well as the media and especially social media but he still makes deals for the country that are good for the country and gets out of ones that are bad. That's the way I see it. 

And as far as the election goes, I just wish there were a way to actually know the truth. I don't doubt that the ballots have been manipulated but I don't really believe either side. From my perspective, the democrats positioned themselves to be able to manipulate the results and Trump saw it coming. Now he's throwing a fit about it but there's not much he'll be able to do. Unfortunately we're all just going on our faith of whichever side we believe in to decide what we think is the truth.

I really try to stay away from politics online and I'm not a great writer so sorry for the long read but it feels good to try to put my feelings about it into words.

The history books will use this triple top and weekly head and shoulder pattern for years to come. And some of you can tell your grandkids that you bought spy at 364 🥴
Are you actually retarded?
I didn't mean that GM was going to lose anything. I meant that GM would publicly keep hope alive for a deal between the two companies to keep the NKLA stock price up. Then after NKLA employees are able to dump their stock (I believe next month) GM announces that the deal has fallen through.

So I'm not saying that GM is going to lose anything or that it's a bad deal for them. I'm engaging in wild speculation since it doesn't seem like NKLA actually possesses anything of value for GM. Someone else brought up NKLA's tax credits. That would be something of value. But is it possible that those won't even be good? If the SEC and FBI investigations find that those credits were awarded to them based on lies about their company, I assume the credits would go away.

So again, I'm not saying GM is making a bad deal. I'm saying that GM might be timing the announcement that there is no deal at all.

I'm just in awe at this point that the company is still worth something, let alone 7B.

Hey op, I think you really are on to something. I've been in a hospital for the past few days with HGTV and the other discovery channels on and every 5 minutes or so, there is a pop up on the TV that shows all the discovery group channels. They also show a ton ads for shows on the other discovery channels. It's like they're getting us ready mentally for a discovery group product.

I think it's obvious they"ll start their own discovery VOD service. They have a ton of 'brands' and 'influencers' that they own the rights to and I think have enough following that people would actually sub to the service. 

I'll type more later

RE: Penalty


> Now comes another challenge to the ACA, brought by Texas, other GOP-dominated states and most significant of all, the Trump administration. They assert that because the penalty has been zeroed out, it raises no revenue, is no longer a tax and thus is unconstitutional.

Yeah but he has calls prob expiring this week. You’re in it for the long run he’s in it short term. Playing Earnings are notoriously a bad move. I think he should Take profits.

Does this answer your question. Chinese EV's for the win. Xpeng undervalued. Nio is still too IMO. Get on the train before it leaves you in the dust. Can't find much in the way of fundamentals for it. Would be good bed time reading if any of you fellow autism find a good link? 

&#x200B;

Saying that if I hadn't 'diversified' my portfolio by moving from Tesla to Nio, part of Nio to Xpeng. I would 'diversify' further... Gold, silver and tech crush has fucked me a little... But it isn't a loss until realised mutha truckas!
Not sure people realized how big the acquisition would effect AMDs stock in the short term. It’s a feat they’ve been hovering 80. Fucked short term but it’s great for mid term/calls a few months out

**RH bought the fear on every dip since the March crash except the dip leading up to the elections.** This was a great opportunity to spook and flush them weak hands, but Pfizer had other ideas.

We went up on big vaccine news so it will be interesting to see if there is another spike in searches on a green day NOT red. Those three spikes happened in the March crash, Jpow speech crash in June and the September downtrend. All three were bought. RH users come in droves during crashes not green days.

or they just gonna keep it flat for that sweet sweet premium
Possibly. I'm leaning that way, however, at this point tech has mostly given up its vast lead over everything else.

Basically, whole market is about to start moving at this inflection point.
Why do I feel like aapl puts today are the wrong move, even though it does the same shit every time

I know I’m gonna get fucked over somehow

Man we dip down and im barely got my neck above water. Cmon bitch
Is it good time to buy or wait for crash to happen
nio to 60 by eom and 100eoy 300+ by end of 2021
This is all based on how I feel. I didn't throw a lot at it but it seems to bounce off its ATH alot and send itself back down to 206-208 fairly frequently. I just wanted to buy some cheap puts and cash out tomorrow on a nice little gain. This is one of the stocks i look at alot but not on any technical analysis. have done pretty good on it with my combined plays on it netting me an overall avg of 60% return for the year (march drop off fuckin killed me on it)

EDIT: Honestly I just think its a prime candidate for an AH dump

Yeah.. wish I got out of my 11 and 12c sooner... oh well. I bought more puts in this pump, confident that this squeeze is just an over correction in response to the dump
But they're in downward trajectory and losing market, and have been for a while

This could be a completely retarded question but what makes SPY move up or down? Is it more the companies in the ETF (Apple, MFST, AMZN) or the buyers & sellers of SPY. Like if everyone who owned SPY shares sold on the same day but Apple, MFST, AMZN, etc were booming, which way would SPY go?

BTFD NVDA?
I’m confident long term and can hold through a dip. Short term is just volatility and broader market reaction. Growing margin and growing revenue are still in the 40-60% . I don’t see that slowing and neither does purple or they wouldn’t be maxing out the second factory by the end of 2021.

COST recovering from that dip, back to 385 EOW?
About to Statue of Liberty?

That’s why I switched to etrade but etrade is not trading friendly from my perspective. it takes so long to enter price, shares, then submit order. Sometimes I missed $1-2 dollar price gap due to delay, which could cost hundred. 

RH is just a swipe. but yea filling price sucks too sometimes

Now im back to RH
NIO GO BACK TO 45
It is. But it’s not passed yet, it’s just a draft. We’re right to be cautious about it.

This is dumb
Rip in peace bro
I hope you're good man, but you need to get a grip on life now. You should have much smarter with the capital you had, instead of wasting it on same week expiry calls. Don't blame WSB for your failure for putting you in the position you're in now, you got carried away with the idea that you were going to quadruple your portfolio without having a plan in place. If it was that easy, then everyone would be doing it. I get that you're in a dark place, and I empathize with you, but you need to understand that it is solely your fault for burning away the 15k, and you shouldn't blame WSB for your mismanagement

The best thing now for you to do is to get a job and make income from there. Relatively speaking, your debt doesn't seem as heavy, so you should pay it off in good time. If college is still an option, then go for it. Work your ass off and get your degree. I know that it'll be tough for you cuz of your depression, but try to motivate yourself. Take it personally like you're MJ, and work your way to success in either college or your new job. Once you've gotten a good amount of capital, educate yourself before you back to investing. Give up reading this sub, because it won't help you if you want actual tips. Realize that you aren't going to double or triple your portfolio so easily, and invest steadily. Invest when you're ready, and hopefully you're going to be back to normal.  

I can't really help you too much since I've never really been in this position myself.  If you can, then try to find some help from support groups and other free therapy-related shit like that. Hopefully you'll learn from your mistakes and find yourself in a better place.

Now, GTFO out of this sub.

Got a feeling tech will open red tomorrow....
> "We have gold backing" but then print money, which is what was done when there were runs on the banks and when the Fed inflated the money supply.

Whoa! You mean that gold backing has no inherent meaning or quantification to the units of the paper money and that banks might print too much, or gold value may go down PLUS we get deflation? Tell me more about how good this is!

> Where banks had a dollar that was actually redeemable for gold (walk into the bank and get gold), it was very stable.

Stable until gold itself crashes due to new discoveries, as has happened, you mean. Or if the bank prints too much. Or if the bank doesn't have that much gold in that particular area or branch so has to ship it, and then has a run. And so forth. 

> Velocity of money as an economic metric is BS.

Ooooooh, this is your area of expertise is it?

> Think about this - real economic value is created when something is produced that can be used.

But not when labor is expended to help an invalid in a wheelchair but no good is produced. Okay, got it.

> No. That means it's a loss to the economy, because that money could have otherwise been spent in a value-creating role. 

That's called "opportunity cost" and isn't an actual loss, just fyi. McDonald's isn't losing money because it doesn't sell off all of its real estate for more profit.

> Can you see where that breaks down and nothing is produced to be consumed?

No, explain it a little more. Where do these people spend their money?

> The heroin user is making a choice for their heroin.

One of the characteristics of cults is redefining words.

Let’s say I have a friend who bought spy 360 calls last week and sold yesterday morning and wants to buy stocks with the money he gained and not piss it away. What’s the most oversold stock from the last two days
Ok look. 

This isn’t killing you. 

The alternative could have been me, being up 80% yesterday, normally taking profits above 20% and building my account back up from 80% down in 2 months ... holding for greed as some of my positions trading ranges in a days span could have given 300% ... and then the bottom dropped out and I’m down 72% total across my account. In one day. Unforeseen catalysts. 

So taking profits keeps you out of trouble. Those are huge percentage profits you realized. Everything else isn’t real.
I am once again asking for more tendies

New generation of computing starts now.

Bye AMD and Intel
Doubling down on calls. Yolo
Nay
Who tried to warn me about my $290 1/15/21 BABA calls this morning??🤑
eod nio graph gonna look like bears mothers tail pipe after me and the rest of bull gang had our turn. gaping, cratered and ready for more tomorrow
you forgot - ph4ggot
You mean 240
Don't worry, they have 7 months of inventory
Uhhh if you bought your calls beginning last week it’s up 30%. If you bought after the 50% jump in 2 days, then you’re a retard and welcome home.
Will 11/27 50c NIO print 🥺🥺
Just give me a real dip to buy, none of this flimsy stuff. Damn.
but why, help!
Tesla and Nio WAKE UP
I'm sorry I can't hear you over my INTC Puts printing. (Actually they're not rn lol)

Also I really like how you just added a purple line going up on the graph, very persuasive.
Baba is dead = 30% growth Ight. Shut up pussio
Why is the name McGee just funny sounding to me
I now only check my stocks every hour. Constantly checking on it is deteriorating my mental health haha
hyln to 50 eoy
Oh boy. GL
About 4.5 seconds of free fall. This dude was almost going 100mph when he hit the water 300ft down. Still doesn’t fall as fast as my call underlyings

Edit: lots of different opinions on the fall time. All this proves is none of us knows how to count. Goodspeed
[removed]
I think its NIO
What stock
Don’t know what OVV is but sure are a lot of calls being bought up for 12/18 expiry
3% is a large figure for Intel
This feeling exactly like 2019. Spend the first half of the year recovering from a big sell off, then a few dips from volatility, then an end of year melt up as people pile back into equities. Maybe there will be another crises next year but for now its gonna feel good to stay long.
Like FD or monthly? Either way RH filling rate is terrible but I just deal with it.
We've had it in Canada for a while now, it's decent
Eh
How much are you up right now?
Bankrupt.
BTFD on $CRSR
Gonna fuck my gf on a money full of bed Wolf of Wall Street style once I cash these Nio calls.
I’m holding. Bought 12k more shares about an hour ago.
Retard is a derogatory word for people with disabilities/special needs and was used a lot more frequently in a demeaning way for them than the others. It’s on the same level as the n word for them which is why it’s taboo outside this subreddit

DOES ANYONE HAVE JEFF BEZOS PHONE NUMBER I AM A NEW SHARE HOLDER AND NEED TO SPEAK WITH HIM
ye had a nice dip to $40 free money now we good

i know profit is profit but these paper hands are killing me. closed NVDA put today at 160% profit to see it go upto 2000% profit. Closed another INO call at 80% profit and see it go upto 200%.
I remember buying NIO calls when that shit was like $20 lol
First hour: drops 5.5%



Second hour: V shaped rally
Looks like a penis.

What does everyone think about DDOG'S earnings announcement today?
fake news.. i seen your bear ass around here before, not shaking out of these until expiration
Is that why it bounced up?
Coming from a guy who let his profits slip away down 3k because of diamond hands, it’s all relative. But yeah today you should have
by playing options why do people even ask these questions
I had some calls on them. Apparently rly bought towards the top. Haven’t played since.
Down 1400 to up 1300 what a day
If NDAQ goes green I’m gonna open a Wendy’s

Spy Gonna close green...to those who held thru🥂
In the sense that they’re both cheap, yes, but the 7.5s are double the 10s.
Random mooning is random
It’s hell. You will work 80 hours a week. Find a way to start your own company or do what you love. I like the work but holy shit these companies will drain every last piece out of you then throw you to the curb.
It's probably worth buying at the new bottom. Many of these work from home positions are sticking around.
Evidently not, dipshit, or you wouldn't have everyone correcting you.
We have the best fundamentals in the industry. Just ask the guy who is cooking the books
Spy pump pump
Thank you for your contribution. Welcome to the NIO gang where we get fucking rich.
that's the obvious, so this time it will pump probably
I bought another 2 at the bottom.

Even if it doesn’t wake up this week, I can’t imagine that it won’t outpace the market during the covid holiday season
I wouldn't say astronomically. It also depends on how good/lucky of a trader you are.
Good cause I got assigned a while back and I’d like to make some money

It's trading at the same price before it's big pre-ER runup in August. The last ER was priced in, do we really think that this one is as well?

Alright, I bought the dip.

I bought short term puts yesterday up a good amount, I’m rolling those into longer dated further OTM puts. Literally up 2000% idk wtf you guys are thinking buying it right now. Sure EV is cool but not ignore all fundamentals cool.

Was she a horse girl?
C’mon McConell, say some dumb shit about the stimulus
Percents > dollars, trade > invest but:

1. Because people can buy for as low as they want as long as theres a seller, and premarket has few sellers increasing your odds at a larger swing in either direction.

2. You can prevent some of the loss with proper management or hedging with puts

3.  A stop limit order would trigger a market order at open, youd be screwed harder than you thought but hopefully not as hard as everyone else.

Hope it helps.
This is the way..
U probably right but still it’s not like the DOJ it’s the ccp 😂

Spy puts as day trade ? We really going to keep climbing after turning green?
What are your positions?
AMD go back to the 80s baby
Hey smooth brain! Credit call spreads have heavy directional bias and you can take on as much risk as you want depending on your strikes. It's really the same thing as a put debit spread. Not thetagang, and srsly go back to your retarded subreddit

Nah apple event, not using their chips anymore
Yea t+2. I use schwab but they show a "settled funds" balance to show how much you can use.

My nio DD was watching u kids make tendies and fomo-ing into it yesterday.

Since then I’ve done further dd by reading a thousand nerds cry “buy the dip” and have done so.
BABA gets a gift wrapped dip every other week, sometimes twice on Sundays
[removed]
VISA just feels like it's going to drop to 208-206 AH and BM tomorrow. OTM puts are cheap at 200 strike for next week expiry. loaded up on some and hopefully cashing out on ATH value stock.   


Waiting like a kindergartner for the first day of school with my RKT call weeklies right now. AH hopefully going to be bigly green
GameStop is the worst.
RKT if your ballsy
ouch
It means big ER and maybe an announcement of a partnership maybe.

this dumps into close. don't get trapped.
MM taking this up slowly to green EOD to keep people antsy about more drops so others dont buy in and they keep the tendie for themselves
I’m praying
Yeah I grabbed some 290C weeklies at under 100 a contract that I'm going to try and day trade. Up 20 percent or so.

What’s the play on BABA? I have OTM call spread monthlies. I’m thinking way OTM leaps might be better though.
5/21/21 55c checking in 🤙
BNTX
EZ mode confirmed.
CVS keeps knocking down that wall of $70 sell orders.
Thanks so much for the clear explanation.  

So to bring it back for a moment, would you consider a stock like AMZN that has huge success but never plans to pay a dividend an overpriced asset?  i.e. if a company shows no intention to pay dividends to it's shareholds, isn't that automatically make it a greater fools buy?
Feels like BABA wants to run but that pin is strong
So...when are we giving mods to Son and this guy on the subreddit here?
I was just thinking the same thing. Was gonna sell some MCD & swap with BABA
Tesla $420 meme calls at the bottom are doing well right now
They’ve grasped the buy low sell high concept that many here have not.
Gyna just giftwrapped you the most beautiful BABA dip you are probably going to see in the next 1-2 years.

Question is are you man enough to SCOOP?

Or you gonna play the wait & see game like a little bitch and watch it gape up 10%?

The gym part is shit DD tho
I hope so.
Honestly surprised WSB hasn’t been yolo’ing this left and right. Anyway, ultimate vaccine rebound story:

~35% revenue from aviation with most of the money made via maintenance contracts.

~35% revenue from power and renewables. May bode well with EU’s infrastructure plan and potential US stimulus.

~20% revenue from Healthcare, should bode well if elective procedures pick back up.

Remainder is GE Capital, which is honestly a dumpster fire, but other businesses should do quite well. There’s also been two years of deleveraging with underperforming businesses being sold off. Larry Culp, from Danaher fame, has been killing it as CEO. 

Long shares, also 12/18/20 $8 Calls purchased months ago.
I’m up 83% on 362 expiring tomorrow. Said f it and bought 5 for 60 bucks (remaining buying power, rest is in positions)
Just don't use all your cash. If it goes down a little more tomorrow then you can buy more.
How many people actually die of the Wuflu?

I agree, but I am retarded,  the vaccine will take around a year to even start if it is indeed successful and even then the selloff seems extreme to me.

Consider the people taking their money into an airline now for example, they'll put it right back when they realise there's no change (but down) in the next few weeks and fomo the so called covid bubble stonks.

Exactly. That’s why she was genius. What do Mattis and Kissinger know about the science of blood testing? They brought huge credibility to the company with absolutely no valuable input.

Yes, and its not worth it unless your doing LEAPS
It’s not like previous year tho, it’s worst. Store aren’t selling out cause of high demand, they are selling out cause of low inventory.
You sir are retarded
 GME Inst are loading up on those dips.  Weak hands will lose their ass on this.  Buy shares or long calls and sit on big drops.  Already back to break even today after that shakeout

I actually had to do some googling about this. In sociolinguistics there is no "third" language, but there is a distinction between second and a foreign language. For example for me English would be considered a second language, but for a Chinese it would be a foreign language.

Rackspace (RXT) is reporting earnings this afternoon and is going to crush it.  They are cohosting a seminar later this week with Amazon Web Service and I think we get some more info on the earnings call about a potential partnership, that was rumored a few months ago.  That is all my DD, but I can confidently say it will moon (i.e. please everyone help pump this stock for me so I can sell some covered calls)

Who else has had uncontrollable brain fog lately? The days are really just blending together fast rn
It's got a nice rally going into the event, but it's dropping to at least 110 by 1:30 and dragging SPY down with it.
Probably not a bad idea, but you’re not gonna double or even 1.5x unless NIO hits 60 which I think is highly improbable but who knows these days. You’ll probably be able to catch around a 10-20% run up ideally.

Damn missed the drop do I sell my SPY 355 11/11s I’m up 100% on now or will this drop again today?
What are you guys doing here? Go out there spread the rona. Do your part so we can have tech moon again

DAMMIT I just want TENDIES AND A XBOX X and I can't have either...
almost 42
BABA is down 7% and down from 300 since a week ago and y’all are not jumping on the dip...?
Lol so unlimited day trades on tos but they take one to two business days to settle the funds after you sell? Is this correct?
Idk I have 11/20 I picked up at close yesterday or close to it. Looking to sell at even. I’m down $30 currently. Should happen

buy MSFT at 200
You know this is exactly how we test it?
Have you considered concentrating on a few? I think I max out at around 5 or 6 different plays before it gets too overwhelming. Then again, I only use the wheel strategy.
I had $10 dec calls which I bought in July for $1.25 a piece. There were 10% swings almost every other day so I sold for $1.39. Each call is worth $10 now a 1000% increase.. All I had to do was put in my life savings and not do anything.. Would have been in the same place as your uncles friend smh

Oh man I didn't think it was possible for me to miss any of his shit but I'm actually gonna miss the annual "DOW 25k" celebratory tweets.
Are you just tryna play the run up to earnings or holding after as well? They smashed earnings the last two times around, so we may have already had the “run up” especially given the hype around EV stocks in the past two weeks anyways, but who knows. I don’t think it’ll soar again but I hope you prove me wrong!
what if life was but a dream...
Okay to the great zoom short is starting? I don’t think so, I think this sell off is just vaccine news but we have some bad things to come for covid that will bring zoom back up.. but now we know it can drop 100 points in 2 days
Die for my puts spy so I can call it a day
Congrats if you bought the Zoom dip
It wanted to let more people buy calls

For a beautiful second spy was green lmao
Any thoughts on BABA outlook? Thinking of loading up on January long calls
Sold my SPY calls for a profit, what is the play now guys?
I swear to god the market just barely trips my stop losses just to fuck with me.
I would think so. Going long after the week we had and the red only began... Not safe, IMO.
So I actually made 240 from that lulu play I was botching about, but like a true 🤡 I bought spy FDs that are getting destroyed. Oh well.
nah there wont be any honking
I hope so I bought 11/13 120c after flipping spy puts yesterday, trying to pull off the parlay.

If tesla goes green I will no longer be a dull boy
11/20 465 Netflix calls at the bottom.. pure random yolo
Fair play to you. I did some also but only on the dummy account. But think i understand it now, just think i need to work out the graphs when you buy the call/put as the values are different to the stock price. 

Do you always buy a put/call if you think the value is going either way?
[deleted]
probably not but the point is it's not a huge deduction, only 2500 (assuming they paid that much interest rather than merely incurring it)


also I was mixed up, thought I was commenting on a thread with a guy who was up over 100k
Everyone thinks this is free money until it's not.
See you say this, but I’m down 60% in my portfolio because of my YOLOs. I need Apple to get to $125 by 1/15 and $135 by 3/21. Will I get there? Prob not but hoping I can scrape up some of the loss.
You retards convinced me to get in on PLTR and look where that got me
Bought pton puts at the bottom I think I’m done for good now bye guys
Never got why it’s a taboo word, maybe because it’s a recent word? We can call people idiots, imbeciles, and morons, but not retards.
F going parabolic
Bought baba dip this morning. 2700 up. But that fisker sank me 4k in just stocks
Of course my ACB puts didn't fill yesterday.  Fuck me.
Guessing investors are concerned that they won't repeat the feat if people are able to return to work.

They've done worse than I expected today though
What if today's AAPL event actually causes it to rally...
Wait for the multi day stock halts when the shorts finally decide to close out. Patience. Look at nio. Shit took awhile to play out and gme is the most shorted stock in history.
Take your pick from FAANG, but my money is on $SHOP, $MELI or, a bit more of a boring duo: $DOCU and $ADBE
I have so many calls that I have to sift through all of them to find out which one is leaking. Does anyone else have that problem?

How long until they get that approval? And then how long to get them distributed? And then how long between first dose and second dose? And then how long until they've vaccinated enough people to make a serious dent? 

Weeks for each. It's going to be a long winter. Everything takes longer than people think when it comes to Covid.

I don't know that the market will actually drop, but things are starting to get pretty bad all over the US, but especially the Midwest.

NO FUCKING TAKE BACKS
When the market goes full retard, you can only go with it. If you start going against it, if you start going half retard, you’re fucking done for.
1/14/22 maybe.  Something is funky with it, didn’t move near the same magnitude the rest of the sector did.

Where did u see people calling that out? I was on the discussion page all day yesterday and didn’t see that at all
I work in the education department at a science museum. Covid messed up my hours so I’m putting in 40 hours a week at a second job waitressing. About 60- 70 hours a week between the two. Trading is mostly a hobby.
SPY is actually autistic
Sector rotation into retail it looks like
AAPL one more thing intro: Fuck you 🥭.  Show ends after that
which tech stock is on sale?
Oh trust me we’ve had plenty of vaccines here
My guess: Chinese gov crashed Ant's IPO; made their future regulations for big tech/online retail public; sector rotation out of NASDAQ.
Not until next year at least.
i lost all this money on leaps lol
Oh shit right today is singles day!
Buy the nio dip
Because it’s in my portfolio
I want to know the latest short interest. I might get back in if i like what I see.
Just lol if you think singles day isn't priced in, there's a huge triple top, head and shoulder on the entire market and you can't even see that? Huhh?
I can’t see it dropping any lower than it already was.

So yea it’s gonna drop.
whose excited to fly around apple park and watch their calls drop thousands of dollars that they have been bag holding for months?

BABA is dead... Jack MA is on the shitlist.
started off in the red, down 18% by 7:45, now at +1%. it's been 2.5 fucking hours.
Most likely true, and has been called for a while since Tesla hired Jim Keller (former AMD and Apple guy). He's probably pushing the switch since AMD has stepped up their game in the past 12 months
Qe injecting straight into bears ass
what sub do you think this is, r/investing?
I got in at the drop under 2. I'm fine. But I do really believe its gonna jump. They just need income. Which they have been working to get.
That’s the problem though, innit? Regulators gotta step in.
You should be thankful baba has lowered itself for us to jump in

I think so, my guess is after AAPL event, dumping recommences
They didn’t make it it’s revenue
Should have sell my NIO shares and buy 2023 leaps and sell weekly calls instead.
Hey hey hey. My calls are only 81% down now and not 90% down. Stoked!

I know man. I should have but it’s a goddamn clown show out here. Didn’t know if it was going to go so down that it would ruin me. Fuck it.
Plan beginning in Dec:  
1. Deposit 40k. 

  
2. YOLO Monthly put Credit spreads on SPY or some tech stonk like AMD. These will be $1-wide put credit spreads like super far OTM (ex: $20 OTM for SPY ). 

  
3. Each play would next me 3-4k each month (less if I take profits early and not at max profit) 

  
4. Reinvest profits back.

I just want to live on a commune with escorts as far as the eye can see and have green spy days. Is that so much to ask for?
A memo went out saying that China was drafting ideas to rein in their e-com and other sectors that are doing monopolistic behaviors, to help bring them more under control of the government. 

This has shaken investors out of BABA in the last 24 hours significantly. However they’re doing their “Black Friday” sales event today and are expected to destroy expectations and numbers.
Referring to people who bought the morning dip; also some other tech stocks are green— wayfair was

The spy’s gone green!!!
well not now bro
At this point I buy tech dips mostly out of spite. I can keep doing this all day, economy (I can’t).
If inversing yourself is a decision made by you, are you really inversing yourself? You’re just doomed to decide to “inverse yourself” at the wrong moment.

Im shorting cineplex today. They have their earnings call coming soon and I feel like it won’t be good news
100% sell it all
thanks
TSLA’s chart is fucking with my emotions rn. Looks like a staircase. I bought 440 calls at the bottom and Theta gang is fucking with my profits
He bought puts at the bottom 😂
SPCE calls are printing.🔥
Just entered a position into BABA, anybody else jumping onboard today? Looking at a longer term play
I didn’t read the article but I read the headline and boy am I pissed. 2 trillion pumped in and I’m down 49k in two days
Um hes still the president and all of this is happening under him lmao
wym in tech? it’s just aapl
I have been flipping so my cost basis is pretty high, but the premium is so expensive so I sold Jan Calls... Definitely a crazy start to the day. Still on the train though.

load up on apple calls for a day trade?
What's going on with CURI?
Today is once again proving that Apple is the entire stock market
This is the way.
this is true
You and I both. Long term bullish on BABA
Thanks to all those who called $RTX as being easy money 🚫🧢
Yea, I’ll take profits
A contested election and the potential of blatant corruption to steal long-term scares me more for our market than the pandemic did.
1 EST
Everyone panicking but these prices seem just about right? If we could just go flat for a while that would be great
lol if you think today was the bottom you have to be delusional
If the Japanese management at Softbank still had any honor left they would hari-kari a samurai sword into their guts.
Yep. Thankfully lots more wins than losses but this one hurts. Gotta be willing to lose it all on weeklys.
Too much profit? Lambos soon, bro!
Stamps. DOCU is early next month IIRC.
Whoever is operating Baba today is a genius. It’s just gonna stay there and IV bleed me all day.
Yeah I see it’s sinking
Greed and not smaller taking profits, will literally clean a large chunk of us left out I think.
Yeah I’ll sit it out. Good call.
lol you gnus bagholders are a fucking cult
Do you think I should get in now
BABA calls anyone?
There was no run-up so nothing to sell
This is one of the most wsb looking charts I have ever seen
Bro roll them out. Give yourself time
1/15/21 270$ calls. Then forget about them for a month
I’m okay with one red day this week to shake the fake bulls out of their position.
was it ever a solid stock pick? lol
it was my fault. I just bought a call debit spread.
Buy the dip. China-Amazon going to rule the world. But seriously, I think you can get it at a steeper discount. That Ant cancellation was a warning shot of serious regulation that will bone Baba
we are still in an uptrend
Lmao why not sell on the massive dip earlier wyd about to re enter puts again here
What happened to Nio? 🙄
if yall retards losing money on NIO you dont know how to trade it, just buy  LEAPs on a red day (now) and chill

If you want to give your money to theta gang go ahead. No reason for the stock to make a big move in either direction. Start going long on Apple in December
A person.
Anyone else think AAPL will pull a fast one on us and actually go up during this event?
Where is the AAPL hype?
They're going to inverse your inverse
Only 140% today
Why puts on PSTH?
What’s the play today coach? Seeing anything with strong value?

Now that you said it watch it moon for some reason
SWEET ASSSS. I love me some boomer reitz
What animal do I need to sacrifice to have my RKT and CRSR yolos hit bigly?
Issued at $8 April 1st then sat at $12 April 7
That's my point
Please I need this to happen.  My 85c were finally ITM at one point
First they came for $AMZN, and I laughed for I did not own any. Then they came for $ROKU, and I turned my head, because I sold at $240. Then they came for $AAPL, and I wept for there was no one left to buy from me.
They won the presidency they are going to downplay covid just like trump did it’s not that complicated
Sorry about your retarded son and his inability to be helpful.

Ant Financial is a sign that China government is cracking down on the power of their largest corporations.  It definitely is a strong signal for JD to not go into the "consumer financial" arena which is where BABA is getting 50%+ of its earnings growth.
Waiting for apple event to load up on puts 🤡
Lol wtf is going on there
I should’ve sold when Biden took the lead but I got greedy. I don’t like how it moves.
Did you take... any profit?
Last time I had "insider knowledge" it was already priced in and it tanked. I don't mean apple just in general.
Was gonna ask why is BABA and what is the play?

Nice play baller!  My little 2k shares suddenly seems measly.  I pocketed 8k yesterday, probably buy back in tomorrow.  Maybe today if it steadies a bit.  Wouldn't mind a little dip back to 11s to load up on some March 12.5 calls.

I think it’ll flip tomorrow morning in anticipation of earnings
How much liquidity do SoftBank really have, that even after all these recent losses, they're able to just yolo a billion dollars on tech calls!!
It’s much more subtle and complex than that. Xi and his gov has an absolute power over the countries policies, including busienss and banking. The government literally dead-stopping the *Biggest IPO of ALL TIME* with just one meeting is a bit more than meaningless noise brotha. 

It just goes to reiterate how in complete control that government is.

BABA does not completely =  China ...  but China  might decide it does. In that case hold on to your puts.

BABA weeklies. 295c
Cost cutting. Bullish. Calls on your bank account, puts on your digestive system though.

Might buy AAPL puts to hedge these leaps after it dumps post event, like usual
Raise your hand if you bought NIO calls at the top or puts at the bottom
Im not in PTON, so no horse in the game

But like... -7% to +7% in an hour is not healthy. That stock is fucked.
probably because it was down like 14% earlier
Another bullish article will send it up
They aren’t doing a very good job if that’s the case

Market on Legendary All Skulls On difficulty
Here's a video with explanations of different gold standards: https://youtu.be/CscG1x6-QUk

Where banks had a dollar that was actually redeemable for gold (walk into the bank and get gold), it was very stable. What you're describing, and where I keep telling you that runs and failures happen, is when they nominally say "We have gold backing" but then print money, which is what was done when there were runs on the banks and when the Fed inflated the money supply. 

Re: non-value-added activity. You need to think about this critically. An economy is not just the movement of money. Velocity of money as an economic metric is BS. Think about this - real economic value is created when something is produced that can be used. If you are stranded on an island, you need food and shelter. Digging a ditch and filling it back in doesn't create new food or shelter, it just wastes time and labor. To produce something of value, you'd need to spend your time catching fish, cutting branches, building, etc. Maybe you make a net that gets you 3 fish per day in 2 hours vs. a previous 1 fish per day in 4 hours. That's an increase in real productivity.
The economy is NOT about just shuffling dollars around, which is when the govt taxes value-producing entities and pays someone to dig and then fill ditches. After the ditches have been filled, has any value been created? No. That means it's a loss to the economy, because that money could have otherwise been spent in a value-creating role. By your logic, the govt could hire every person to just sit around all day, and we'd have full employment and all be wealthy. Can you see where that breaks down and nothing is produced to be consumed?

Re: Heroin addicts being rational - yes, they have a time preference to enjoy their heroin, so they choose it over having a career, family, etc. Economics doesn't make moral judgments. The heroin user is making a choice for their heroin.
You realize that MMs are computer and are able to switch positions based off the trends in the market right? Oh you don’t

put all those tickers on a dart board, put a blindfold on, and yolo what you hit. This is a casino, stop overthinking it and looking for advice. It's like asking the poker player next to you if you should call or fold.

Sitting at their desks and laughing
Earnings soon. And they added alot of stuff and have alot of deals. This or the next earnings will rocket the stock up.
Made bank on ANGI calls today, and by bank I mean $25
You never know when the CCP is fucking you in the ass
Do it all the cool kids are doing it
You should buy RKT FDs
It’s been on expert mode for a while now.
Tell me you made a fortune...
I think they’re sold out everywhere unless you wanna spend an extra $300 to buy off the assholes who loaded up on them to resell them lol
Unfortunately :/
sell
this shit bout to reverse again
if you didn't hold through the dip, you ain't black.
Shares or options? If options, with the current IV you need it to skip moon and go straight to Jupiter for your contracts to print.
go look in a dumpster
I can confirm the name ;)
Yea that’s what is confusing me. Oh well, time to buy the dip lol
I pray
Same thing with DIS I guess
The real sell off begins right at noon, hope you all bought your puts!!!!!!!!
Market rigged and gay

But not as gay as me
Doubt it. Maybe intel but probably people have known these chips were coming for months. Unless apple silicon sucks you off while you browse Twitter I doubt it will have much of an effect on amd or intel.

Very wet ass pussy?
Wait so are we getting another tech crash after the Apple event in 1hr?
Absolutely..
Sell if its not a day trade and wait for another dip
No it didn’t they cycle out in 12 hour. Mods commented on the post agreeing look up
Keep doing what you’re doing like buying calls and also do the the wheel strategy to hedge. I do both and when I lose, I win a bit on the other. Anyways, best of luck bro! Get them damn gains. You win we all win
Wow what a bull trap
What positions you get? I’m thinking about jumping in.
DKNG too!
Alright bet. I locked in about $270~ profit off a small short position from yesterday, rolled that into a call spread and then used the initial capital to buy this put. Guess I’m just risking half my profit
I appreciate that! Definitely makes it easier holding
[deleted]
Are markets opened tomorrow?
They told me to follow the trend. I did with NIO, bought calls before closing yesterday.Then again with Zoom puts earlier at 8.
-Spy close to the ATH set yesterday currently down .2%

-WSB: WORLDS ENDING MY CALLS R FUK I CAN TIME THE BOTTOM AND TOP IN THE WRONG WAY HELPPPP
Too late. Buy the anticipation sell the news. Isn’t that the saying?

I think the big guys already have this sewn up.
That 1% SPY drop really gave my FDs hope. Only needed another 3% 🤡
Just yolod my entire RH account in to nio weeklies. Cmon let’s get there
Zoom. It’s dumped yesterday
Buying tech leaps at the end of the day (or maybe week) seems like a good play
NIO you hold $41 you son of a bitch
I bought in at 216 today bro... fuck
Market is on expert mode btw so maybe cash gang is the move
They’re short dated calls. Sell.
Damn man you’re bullish af. Kinda makes me want to get out of all positions and get more 11/13 22.5c like a moron
lol wat
You can pop them? I kind of want that to happen. Once they pop they gone? I fucking hate them things

Helios calls bro (HYLN). So beaten, so juicy.

I own enough shares since I averaged down from $40 on every dip that they let me rename the company.

How bad of an idea is holding RKT through earnings
This moon is bait, inc rug pull @ 3:45
Healing crystals and essential oils
RKT gonna do what RKT gonna do
Actually with Europe heading back into lockdowns im feeling confident that AMZN will be back up in no time. Bought one $3300 call for 11/13 and one $3500c 11/20 just one because I’m not a huge risk taker
"Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation" doesn't sound dodgy at all
👍 good luck
All the uncertainty is over? Huh, news to me
Intangible coins.
Y’all lay out why I’m a retard for the RKT calls. Just finish the sentence. 

Your a dumbass for buying RKT when everyone knows ...
The range of emotions today!!! From “holy shit the COVID stock decimation continues” to “holy shit we comin back, we comin back!!!”  🚀🚀🚀🚀

Only to then find out tomorrow the rug pull continues....
Lol, oops.
Nio is no ordinary retard, it is our king
I posted about going all in on CCL puts expiring this week. I made stacks.
Broke back mountain
Yeah you know it
Damn bought some January $PLTR calls on the dip and am dealing great about it. First good feeling about a buy in a long time lmfao.
Market back up after realizing Pfizer's vaccine is dogshit and no one has the freezers to store it outside of hospitals, who probably still don't.

Mr. Bear and Mr. Bull live in the same forest, but they don't like each other.

One day, they come across a golden frog who offers them three wishes each.

Mr. Bear wishes that all the other bears in the forest were female. Mr. Bull wishes for a crash helmet.

Mr. Bear's second wish is that all the bears in the neighboring forests were female as well. Mr. Bull wishes for a motorcycle.

Mr. Bear's final wish is that all the other bears in the world were female, leaving him the only male bear in the world.

Mr. Bull revs the engine of his motorcycle and says, "I wish that Mr. Bear was gay!" and rides off.
So many are doing that rn 😂
Pretty sure they are able to do this shit now with the easing of the Volcker rule.

Yikes, didn’t someone made a post yesterday saying they were going all in on CCL calls expiring this week. Umm ouch.

i believe that would be called "buying the dip"
Shares. I was really tempted to buy call. Didn't need the stress, stuck to shares
NIO straight line to 50 EOD
Why is amazon down? Why is google down? These are staples people
Everything wants to turn green.
Don't use stop losses...MM is happy to trigger your stop losses then come in and buy up all the shares for cheap.
If any of you panic sold nio...
Well fauci has genuinely been wrong on this the whole time and has switched his position every single way so I’m not sure he’s a good one to follow
Is it me or is it when Euros close we suddenly started pumping
PTON volume is getting nuts
nio is the new retard pump stock

Oh yeah learnt my lesson on earnings, between MSFT and CRSR earnings I’ve joined wsb for real with an awesome red skin on RH permanently
Revenge trading right now and its working
So PFE fucks up everyone's day yesterday day and then can't even come close to holding 40
December 7-11 will be the week of reckoning. 🌈🐻 will prevail!!!!!!!!!
What was the issue in your case? 

Mine is negative buying power due to a short SPY call being assigned but it was covered by exercising my long SPY call. 

It usually gets fixed before the start of the trading day but weirdly enough, not today.
ATVI takin' off!
why do bulls always say this on red days, lol

find a healthier way to cope
fuck u biden

why exactly are tech stocks so low these couple of days?
That's tight af. And a bitch slap to trump. But tbf the arguments afaik were kinda just super lazy and cheap, like they lowered the fine to $0 so it was some technicality to toss it out right? Like if I was a letter of the law judge like those guys claim to be i would think it was a hella lazy argument. Like c'mon, put some effort in and make it a curbing 10th amendment fir states to choose etc whatever.
FSLY is a stock I totally don't understand, start the day with -5%, then suddenly moon to +2% within an hour. 

Absolutely no news.

Yeah I wonder if it will keep dropping all week..
Hate flat days, I wanna make a bunch of money or lose everything, not go even, this is a casino after all
People selling BABA below 275 is hurting my head.
We always said this will be an epic battle. Many put and call corpses already lay on the clearing. Don’t get flanked by these institutional putiots, keep the line and weather them down slowly and steadily with diamand call encrusted hand weaponry

Why glad you avoided amzn? That shit is bouncing😁
Yes had them on my watchlist since 230ish, always looked expensive when looking at the chart which is like a straight line up but glad that finally dipped my toe into the water some weeks ago (already nicely up)
Hell yeah!
If we do I'll coom. These 11/13s would be a 3x gain.
that was 20 hours ago. Today isn't yesterday lmao

What do you mean Moderna? Ours (Pfizer) is with biontech) and Moderna is shit compared to ours
I bought 50 more NIO shares after it dropped to 40. NIO to the moon 😍🚀
Went balls deep in this dip and loving it
Market gave you a heads up how its going to react to the vaccine. Whenever FDA approves this next week or the week after expect even bigger rotations out of tech and into all the sectors taking the biggest hits. And this time those movements will be there to stay. Travel, retail, and oil are just a few of them.

Oh, and Corning and dry ice stocks too cuz of how pfizer will distribute...LIN, YARIY, GLW
Idk I think a lot of us are pretty blessed considering our history. This pandemic is nothing compared to most historical events and were already 20 years into the century.
Shit moves sideways.

I bought my 10 RKT 11/13 30c lottos for 100 bucks. Its so retarded it might work

ZM goin green. BUY BUY BUY
I actually went from my last $800 back to 9k over the last few days. Don’t give up hope!

Alright I ain’t taking crap until those 2 years pass
I'm pretty heavy on tech and gold. Took a big hit this week... :(
I would argue you don’t even need it to be warm.
Half right, its when you take out a percentage to minimize the impact of a reversal if you believe theres still room for growth.

Bearish plays would be more if you wanted to hedge your initial entry.  I only ever go long tho, risk is for the birds.  Feel free to DM if you have any questions down the line.

Are we holding for V recovery? Just lost other half my acct to crsr, NIO calls was the other half.

Peloton today
Paypal actually green what the fuck.
dkng
$350 nov 27th
Same here
taking the most painful shit of my life rn

puts on my asshole’s tightness
The usual run up to earnings plays have been mean a miss or nonexistent. Practically zero run up in big tech, and even good earnings crashed.

Not hopeful on the usual Lowe’s, hd earnings runs.
That took some major balls, depending on how much $25K is to you. Congrats and fuck you
You would think we’re used to these v-shaped recoveries by now
AVO go buy it if you like avocados
Has anyone ever gotten a message from someone claiming to be a 'millionare trader' with hundreds of followers. Almost as sketchy as that guy talking about how you can get free money at one point
well if I reach a profit I'm okay with I would sell and buy more leaps and shares, be careful though the IPO lockup expires in Dec so the insiders would maybe sell
Gains are gains. Sell
Sell!  The way robinhood is acting it could take all day to get your order through.
Same
At least it's common shares. Fucked myself with amd calls 🤡
If NFLX is still a leading indicator SPY going to end green

You heard it here first
My entire account is Tesla and NIO
We’re going green cause now trump is gonna get re-elected. What a crazy ride
Spy go downsies please
You are me
Wont recoup my losses today , but eventually
Wars are now fought by proxy countries and "peacekeeping forces"  why fight yourself when you can get 2 shitty countries to duke it out, then corrupt the leader of the winner.
Really nice trade man 👌
Why did I not dump everything into pton at 94
u sir fuck
Sell
Woke up to literally all of my stop losses being triggered, except for one. What a shitty day
always buy puts at the bottom and sell at peak, calls vice versa. otherwise go into another sub
Kind of remarkable that I rode baba calls last week for 100% gains - $13 premiums sold - bought back at 10 day later now they’re worth 2/3.....
i’m currently holding a 11/13 19.5c, keep?
I hope you 🌈🐻s sold your puts.

Fastest V ever.

Had I just woke up I would have never known I was down 10k at one point this morning
yeah ER crushed it, but just a better buy at that level lol
We don’t know yet!
Can't tell if I'm in tears from laughter or because the pain of reality is too much.
Keep us posted all your trades
from -%50 on my PTON calls I bought yesterday to +27% NEVER EVER TRUST ALGOS PUSSIES
ez money
That’s what I thought but the autists have been telling me all morning historically it dumps on Singles Day.  However, with today’s antitrust dump already priced in, you gotta believe it could rally tomorrow on huge sales numbers
Nani koreee
are you done panicking?
The tards here are my news.
It came out that COVID was made by bill gates to chip us all and stuff
chinese
I bought the dip like a good little bull and am being been handsomely rewarded (CRWD, FVRR, NIO, BA (after it dropped to like 188)). Glad I avoided AMZN though
why not both?
Why is it when stocks like SPOT range trade I always run out of options?
Tomorrow same time?
CCL fucking rigged
Looks like it all depends on AAPL
Fuck that was close! Margin call at near £4500 down on Peloton, just cashed out at £1500 up! It will no doubt now go to 130, but I’m 😃
my worst today was -5.86% currently at 3.74%... today is not fun
A super volatile day will hopefully come within the next few days that gives everyone a big hope boner. Wait till then and then sell, even if it's for a small profit or breaking even.
Seems like it might be waking up
spy going coo coo today
BOUGHT THE BABA DIP LETS GO CHYNA!!!!
Super V?!?   N-N-N-N-NANI?!?

It’s a weekly and they spiked massively...

Nah they feel sorry for us retards

AAPL event at 1PM, heard big things coming out
i basically called the bottom, but too much of a pussy to btd

Its going to be e commerce projections that makes this stock BOOM. Its moved from 120 range to 145 currently on walmart+ and when the numbers get reported its going to gap up, this along with Tik Tok. This stock has always been appreciated as brick and mortar but now that its having a heavy presence in online sales it will start to get treated as Amazon in terms of PE and MKT Cap
Fuck it, I’m just gonna keep buying amazon
On hold.
My Boomer divvy stocks are up 10% for the year, my Meme momentum stocks are up 7%, todays pullback fucked them badly, i don't even know anymore.
Good plan, I switched to Jan calls. Numbers don’t lie so it’ll get there eventually. Just bad timing with merger and earnings.
youll find a way to end the day red
Still bagholding brother. There's dozens of us
Wishful thinking. They have 100,000,000 doses of vaccine ready to go. They just need FDA approval to start administering it

Incoming triggered cucks
NVDA the next "super V" in formation?!?!

oh Nio bears - when will you learn
Bought just before so if you could all bring it back to 44 for me, appreciate it.
I’m ready for my overlord AAPL to show off the latest device 🚀 🚀
shorts % is high and Burry sold to under 5% so he doesn't have to report
W T F happened today!!
Just want to let you retards know that yall saved ass from becoming homeless
I'm doing that with COST
Sold everything for profit this morning and bought the dip back up 

ITS TOO EASY BOYS
PLTR calls or go fuck ur mother
Hmm that might explain it...
Fake pump. Load puts now
Big waa all. GL! 👍
Everyone has been saying this is priced in, or that's priced in, but in reality, everything good for the market, including things that havent happened yet that people are betting will happen, are priced in.  it leaves no room for gains because any positive events causing potential gains have already been priced in.  I think people are beginning to see that.
Such a fucky ass day I knew I should have just done NOTHING
Okay NIO, calm down
This is really gonna be trade sideways today
We’ll see. Earnings next week is gonna be key. If they report good numbers that thing will be 50 by dec
Big spender over here
mmm 6% in a few minutes...wow
W Jan 25 280c. Already up 50% for me. Hold? 🤔🤔🤔

Bullish if entered under $16, too much global uncertainty if higher

Yeah damn, Stamps is sitting wayyyy down from Thursday’s close. Guess DOCU could be worse lol.

Edit: They reported earnings on Thursday and did well actually. Just bad timing.
Sold puts on margin?
If NIO closes green I’m becoming a communist
That’s a straight line up on spy
Bby, we ending 44-45

nicee bought TONS of nio on that first drop to $40, made a nice 2% instantly for free, can easily see nio heading towards 50 eow and 75+ eom
puts on my mental health
Boeing needs to stop acting like a bitch
So who bought the Nio dip?
You’re wagering it all on a bet that people stop smoking weed? Good luck with that
Ah well, I wasn’t asking about selling off. I was worried about buying in. It’s fine, as long as you made a profit :)
Your student fund is basically r/wallstreetbets
i have SPY and Mcd calls
Robinhood bought QQQ calls when it was in my pocket now I’m up 20 bucks lmfao
Depends on expiration date. IMO next week Pfizer/BioNTech will submit for EUA and moon, and then in about a month they will ship the first dose and moon again.
They had 6 billion yuan in order in the first minute
 Amazon yes
So it’s true then?
Yeah but the longer time to expiration the higher the price is. 

So like a spy 350 call that expires Friday is like $300 but a spy 350 call that expires in a year is like $3000
miss the good ol' days of 2009 - 2019 when for a decade everything consistently and steadily climbed. Reliable, consistent, long-term bullish trend that didn't give you PTSD. 

RIP
Tech is gonna lull for a bit while folks rebalance into consumer cyclical and shit. If you're confident in your positions just ride the volatility out and if your investments are sound you'll be ok.
Down 5k over the past 2 days, you know, just gay retard things
What the fuck is wrong w BABA

I'm not 100% confident in NIO, so I wanted to bring down my average quicker

Its going back up
then he books profit. can't lose money with covered calls when underlying goes up :)
look at realclearpolitics
Yeah I have 11/27 I’m sure I’ll get most back if not all by next week
BABA has done over $900 million in less than a minute for Singles day. Crazy
Definitely
I AM ONE WITH OUR CHINESE COMRADES BABA CAN NOT DIE
Absolutely. Let’s wait for some big event to be publicized by mainstream media and then we follow on by buying deep OTM calls.
Cramer name his little fucking dog “nvidia” I wouldn’t listen to him about tech unless you do your own DD
💦
Its midnight in China now, Singles Day starting the BABA printers.
Damn! I sold my AMZN weeklies too soon! Potential gains of $3k lost!!!!! 😓😓😓😓
QQQ green by EOD
Yeah that is fair. Whatever I have mostly shares so I’ll add on and wait
Supply chain was maxed out after march last year. They since added a bit more capacity but, smartly i would say, did not over do adding more capability. In short, they got a record max gain, realize its a temporary one, took the profits with a smile and will keep carrying on with the longterm plans of growing sales at non pandemic pace. In short, overvalued still at this point. I am short at the 200 mark and long at the 170 mark
Perhaps. I’m betting my money that it isn’t.
I think Ma tried to reason with the CCP instead of giving them tendies to settle the issues

Now we are fucked and myself a proud bag holder of BABA
flip a coin
LOL SPY is literally glitched its supposed to be dying right now
Unfriend
Little miffed at myself I didn't secure NIO profits at the top, but because I sold at around 40 and bought back in at 38, and shifted my 11/20 to 11/13 instead, I'm already back from 30% down to just 3% down. If NIO ends the day at around 42.5 or higher I'll actually have turned a profit. I'll sell those 11/13s and shift it into longer calls to protect my gains.
Always was going to be.
The market is down

That's why I only used half my buying power yesterday to buy tech... just in case it fell more, which I knew was a possibility. I think we'll be OK bro these two companies are solid
I’m in way to deep for these RKT earnings. Pray for me. Also dfen keeping me solvent these last few days. Love that shit.
Beyonće, dragging PTON out of the depths. Who new that talentless hack would be our saviour?
Buying ZM calls or writing puts was the play today. In true wsb fashion it's the opposite of the advice here
That PTON daily. Wow.

Bro, time to man the FUCK UP, take responsibility for your actions. This is the real world, nobody will feel sorry for you, stop counting on a random WSB Millionarie to sponsor you. We've all been there done that. I came to US from a East Euro Country, Spent 6 years working in Asbestos wearing a Tyvex Suit + Mask in winters removing nasty shit while getting part-time BA in Econ. Graduated, got multiple jobs, (hedge funds, consulting). About to graduate with an MBA in December from Top 10 school, and I educated myself  make money in the market.  Stop being a fucking pussy and take this as a lesson learned.
Wait are you serious? That’s a massive fucking pump

People on my Facebook keep sharing that cnn took away PA from Biden back to too close to call and that trump is gonna win lol wtf

Hope yall are enjoying the ride on this, and dipped into MFA, TWO and NRZ

rug will be pulled. See: price action BYND yesterday.

PTON train. Get in.

NIO V shaped recovery
RKT red to green movement very soon. Extremely bullish
No problem. Let me know if you have any other questions on options. A bunch of places are too vague or too technical with shit that doesn't matter. Same problem I had when I started learning.
Was telling people to buy puts this morning and got downvoted 😂

Either way, with potential ANT group catalyst (whether it makes sense or not) + singles day + potentially unwarranted haircut due to news article I'm still rolling the dice.  Boomer style though with June 2021 320c.
Novavax down 20% from yesterday like wtf
Oh when you plan on selling those? I also have leaps. Do u plan on exercising or just selling
Yea I had really strong hopes for it, had a good forecast. Shame it opened red and is still bleeding
RKT is giving me headaches
Why not sell weeklies?
💎🤞
Yeah I can see that. I wouldn’t go all in right now. Just spreading out my purchases.
Hold NIO 41 calls through Friday?!
Fuck you Beyonce my PTON puts we’re printing
GOOGL seems pretty underrated now
And in October, I completely agree
Unloading the portfolio into puts on aurora and canopy growth, if these don’t print it’s over.
Are you me. Bought at 40.50 too
I have no clue lol. I sold my puts and am trying to decide wether or not I buy a cheap AMZN call for Friday. $3300c looks pretty nice to me but I don’t see it getting that high this week.  I don’t think this is going to be a huge crash everyone is talking about. Just a pull back from the ATH
good time to jump in. could see another potential spike up if/when vaccine is approved
Lol what’d you lose it on?
MOON
the market is down a *half percent*. chill
Yeah thats the one. Good shit.
PTON being bought the f up
It’s $300 just hold
Time for the random rally. Buy this, sell that. But they’re correlated? Huh, idk... I guess. 😐Sell this, buy that!...OHNO...              Panic much?
BABA has singles day (11/11) in just a couple of hours. Might be a promising dip to buy
True
No brakes on this rape train 🚂
Pandemic is not over- it will take months to finish trial results/analysis, and in the event it’s extremely positive, it will take months to scale up manufacturing and distribution. Govt will take time to hammer out policies (COVID passports?) I say it takes another year

Anyone buying that boomer HD dip?
Held on and bought more NIO on the dip. This stock will never go down.
industrials and manufacturing

idk about tech, the fed just said pfizer vaccine is going to start being distributed late Nov. Donny Pump is still here
Sort of funny that PFE, the catalyst for all this rotation is red

DD: Cramer said it would recover
Buy the nio dip?
youre fine, hold til thursday.
Yeah this tech sell off still has room to go. PayPal itself will be fine it’s not a stay at home corona stock. That’s why the inflow into PayPal is actually looking strong. But you got high theta. Good news is PayPal is looking strong today.
I'm calling it and I've said it before. Apple was the final deciding catalyst in September when the market went down. It will do it again today.
Smokin on that baba pack
10% in two weeks thats near risk free? Lol find me something better.
Wtf I lose 180 dollars every time SPY swings .05% what is this shit r/antstreetbets
Holy fuck what happened to BABA
What if China shook off tp hands from American retailers so they can rebuy nio baba zm and more at a discount
Yeah it feels like a ponzi scheme thats gone too far snd now they are trying to figure out how they can actually design and manufacture something lol. Every photo and render I see is something different
Added a fat stack of NIO at the bottom of that sexy channel. Lmao some of y’all really expect a stock to go up 160% in 3 months and shake in your boots at a -10% day. Embarrassing

it seems I BOUGHT AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR ONCE
Buy calls at top?
Damn
Inversing chart junkies is what WSB already does.. and we're supposed to inverse WSB. So who do we inverse?
YOU FORGOT THE PART THAT IM BROKE
Sssssh don’t let em kill it
My wife's boyfriend loaded up on NIO calls through the dip so I'm gonna follow suit.
I'm right there with you!
SNAP continuing to trend down expecting strong support at 35, if it dips below that would be a good buy
Looking like I properly timed a dip for once in my life, hope this holds
Ivr ttwo
Why not both?
Are we supposed to buy at the dip or the peak? I keep forgetting.
Someone give me a status report on NIO I refuse to open RH

pumpin or dumpin
Overreaction into industrials, MMs cucking all those on the sidelines who bought the tech dip yesterday
GME if you want to be a billionare.
genius
I'm already bent over. I'm just going to stay put and hope we make a baby.
China buying the nio dip, strongest of strong commi support at 39.00. Long live the peoples republic 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
Think this won't rebound tomorrow? Better to wait after earnings? Thinking of buying stocks to hold long
Straddle?
Sameeeee
I make a mental note to do that the next day every afternoon and promptly forget the next morning.  Ah well won’t have RKT tomorrow morning so it’s a moot point
Yes please
Market is offering discounts. Don’t miss out.
$41 buy in was looking a little hairy there for a moment
Market wont crash till next year bitches
Nope
Will you shut up, man
Youre fucking gay
Duuuuuuude, you don't even know man.

Procter&Gamble. Pretty covid-resilient too
How are your calls doing pud 😂😂😂
If you think that's a "dip" I don't really know what to say to you
I hate when I lose $60k in less than a day, you know what I mean?
did u just buy puts at the bottom
I bought halfway down😪
How many auties are buying Apple 120s
we pumping now - algos couldn't fake out diamond hands
Gorsuch and Kavanaugh not feeling the arguments.
Why does SoftBank hire these clowns? They could pay me double of what this guy was making and they would actually make money.
Damn. It’s all gonna be green by the EOD.

3K to make 300 in 2 weeks? Seems like 3K could be better used somewhere else

BIIB, the FDA can still approve or approve with requirements for additional testing.  Alzheimer's is a multi-billion dollar opportunity.  Long term drug usage, hugely expensive, high profit margins.  Even if it gets rejected, rotation out of tech into low PE value stocks should help this 7 PE company.  1K shares.
Biden has said he won't do another lockdown. That would be extremely unpopular. They'll just do mask mandates and partial bans on indoor dining.
Hedge it ah next time
The move is to inverse chart junkies.
No. Everything Dan Gilbert touches turns to stone
People cant handle the truth lol
Who in the fuck actually likes using Zoom? This shits going to die out faster than Dane Cooks career...
That BYND sell off was so exaggerated yesterday. Buy leaps today and thank me in 6 months
If we end green today we will drop bigly Wednesday or Thursday.
s&p and nasdaq down but dow up...time of the reits?
Probably a long con but would be fucking hilarious to see Chaddaq finish green for an extra fuck your to these bears
Who bought the top of this dip? 🤡 i did
Sector rotation into DKNG
samesies
Ual $35 eow
Tdameritrade.
Thank u idk why i got downvoted so much lol
How long ago did you buy these? Either you bought deep OTM or way too close to expiry. Either way, you're a fucking retard.
Go buy a playstation and a nice dinner imo
Ok Mr tough guy
I just want fat check 

only fat check is ok
Hm so i had covid drank muellin leaf extract 3 times a day could breathe like a champ quit vaping too and finally had some decent plays so I guess I went from Chad to Todd thanks Rona'
BABA BOYS BTFO
Youre holding options thru earnings??
Doubt someone in Med school is making over $70k this year. But then again if he accepted a credit card for your wife’s bf’s penis enhancement surgery it’s possible he’d have to report it...
Let’s get it NIO .. 50 EOD
Ah yes. Sold 620c when it was like 580, not even a month ago. Sheesh. Nice job.

I’m down 80% on it so probably let it ride and hope a cure for aids is found in the next 48 hours.

NOK is one that tends to trend up long-term (others tend to go down, if you look at Ford, GE, etc).   So if you want one stock to sit on boomer-style I'd go with Nokia.  If you want short term gains though probably any of them for the next week.
What the hell is “Le Grille”!?!

Yeah I went heavy into it in my Roth for long term.
I think it's finally over. We can plan our trips back to tendie town now. I bought so many tickets
If your name is Great Opportunity, pull out that dick because apparently I'd love to blow you.
I survived....managed to make 1-2k in the end and it was absolutely not worth the 2 weeks of absolute fuckery and sleepless nights.
Just a small piece of things returning to normalcy in the US.
Congrats to those that bought NIO at the very bottom. Good job.
just checked in and wow that V shaped recovery on GME
Guys, the GRWG dip is a gift. Earnings after close tomorrow.
If you didn’t buy NIO dip I don’t really know what to say already up 100%
Hop in crsr
🤡
*-6%*
By averaging out do you mean selling some bullish positions and taking bearish ones?

Thanks man. Yeah this feels bad but I'm not quite retarded enough to gamble my actual savings which my boomer dad helped me to put into index funds.

Imagine thinking XLE was going to keep going up 😂
RKT earnings gonna be good or nah?

Lockdown + covid restrictions = more stimulus. So I shit you not, nowadays it seems like the market understands that’s also a bull case.
Ah when you put it like that..  in my case I’m a native speaker of 2 languages (born in a state which has the first language different from my mother tongue), and then 2 others that are commonly used everyday but not exactly a native language for me. One could label them first, second, third, etc.. but when you speak so many, it’s hard to gauge which one you’re most comfortable with, then the next one, etc
Bruh what if you just put in pennies and got out w bunch of quarters this game looks dumb asf

PTON -esque recovery inbound for BABA
Sir, you have a gambling addiction like i do and many of us here. I am seeking help for it because I can’t stand losing money that I work hard for. Good luck
PTON gonna go back down?
Thoughts on liquidating my account and going all in on NIO shares? Small account maybe 12k but it’s my 12k, please give me some good advice, never done something this retarded but I feel like I’m ready to either 1.5/2x or lose half and cut my losses

Recovering. Everything green by EOD (except BABA)
FSLY is the best buy in tech rn
If I did that I wouldn't have ended my comment letting you know I suck at trading
50p 2022?
From my retard analysis, people still have money and are bored at home more often. More autists than ever are flocking the stock market and it will only grow due to the easy accessibility and growing popularity among the youth.
My NIO LEAPs and I chilling rn
This week is just when things start to kick off.
Days like this make me feel lost.

Not just gonna Yolo puts
i had sum put credit spreads i tried to sell this morning that had nice profits but rh wouldn’t let me sell and now i’m down, can i be credited for it?
Market overreacting + shorts taking advantage of the overreaction
LETSGO BABA yuansss
shitload of volume in NIO   
we need more buyers than sellers
Yeah  my day started out looking real nice. Stopped paying attention for the day and came back later to somehow being down on the day. WTF?
I honestly think it is just buggy code flagging their risk
So if this is how getting closer to the Covid end looks like, I will now get out and fuck as much weird animals as possible that I can find in order to start the next pandemic. Would appreciate if you could make a go fund me page or something. All for the team 😎🦇💰
So glad I sold my rkt calls at open and then bought back in on the dip 🤗
Just a dash of kuh caine in the coffee is ❤️

Thank you for your contribution NIO brother
TSLA boys $ROPE yet?
The time was 9:40 and/or 11:40 - if you're playing intraday you might want some puts at the moment

^(This is all hypothetical and I have no idea what ticker you're trading only a fool would take my advice)
Pltr on sale.
Sold puts and got assigned so I guess I have more gme shares lel
The volume of this buy in on ATVI is nutty. Shits going to moon 👀

If u want a cheap lotto play...FE puts. Some corruption news that is expected to be announced soon
Just mentally prepare for a huge guh so you can’t lose
I looked into this and they are actually kind of expensive
nio should bounce back, at which point i suggest you try to sell close to breakeven. if it 
trades sideways up until earnings, your calls will continue to bleed out slowly
Yes
AMZN weekly call holders. Are you’ll holding? Or dumping now 🤔🤔🤔
what?
Paper hands
Byd meat leaps free money. YW
Lol - ur conveniently forgetting the ones that have worked tho - dummy.
I didn't sell on the March dip. I added and flipped to a gay bear for a few then I went back to being a strong bull. I'm gonna make money both ways. So far I'm up 78% on the year. I'm not a genius but I'm far from autist. Good luck. Hope you guys and girls make some $ .
Quois????? Damn that's huge news. Except it doesn't really effect stocks just means that Healthcare won't skyrocket lol
Looks pretty strong especially after that big of a sell off
Rkt $22 ba $195 baba $270 eod plz
You can always roll it, but that has risks of its own. You can also add credit spreads (in either direction) to offset your losses,  but there’s additional risk there as well. In this case, I’m probably just going to wait for a bounce and close the position.
I'm buying puts. If it worked, I would've come back in time to stop myself.
It was so nice to finally make money off of ZM puts... Third times the charm!
[removed]
Here’s my thing. They approved me for a couple thousand of dollars. I used about 600 of that my position is down, but you were ready to lose more than 600 on me. Give me a fucking break. I even reduced it by selling calls so actually I’m only using 465 now. Fucking relax.
Great PLTR dip.. yumyum sauce all over my portfolio
No I wasn’t paying good enough attention unfortunately.
NIU up almost 4%.  Strange....
Lmao
Afternoon pump coming. Buy the diply.
Yeah. I wanted to try options trading for extra cash (95% of my money is not being gambled like this). Clearly I have some things to learn.
Is Amazon still have a $3000 valuation with pandemic over?
maybe up and maybe down. probably stay at 420.69
Depends who you ask.
MCU call back news just came today.
Man we on this dude.
Okay FSLY you do you
No
As is tradition.
Sold my airline and cruise puts for 150% this morning.

Just bought some apple zm and amd

Lets play this fucking game
sold nio at 39.2 haha. why god

UPWK dips have been free money yesterday and today.
They BAWT UP PLTR
Those calls would have been just fine if you diamond hand them lol. I'm back up on the day. Not sure what I'm doing tomorrow though cause that was super stressful to watch.
Pump running out of steam. Prepare for low volume dump rest of day.
Sold my SPY put when it hit 351 this morning for a solid 100% gain in a day ($50 not a big deal), not losing any money on my NEM calls, and my Karma is up 11.4% today.  

Thinking I have a real chance of turning this into a full time job (posting on WSB not trading, I fucking suck at trading)
But it shows more more loss in my app so  I think that's correct
And here just this morning i was going to bitch about FSLY.
Jack Ma thinking he was bigger than the CCP
I tried to tell y’all that the Polaris sell off yesterday was overkill but naaaaah
did you really buy a zm put today?
Spy?  I'll be you platinum that doesn't happen
Sold my INO 10c for MCD 240c yesterday after the BYND spike up (before the spike down). [L O fucking L](https://imgur.com/t/not_a_shark/gidvsVM). What am I fucking doing dude holy shit.
Ohh I didn't check that 🙂

Edit mine more itm only have a .1 spread
No
Literally do my DD, chart, look at financials, etc. plan the trades out, then panic in the morning and proceed to buy calls/puts on whims and end up chasing.

YOOOOOO, ACA is actually going to stand. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh not feeling this shit. What stonks to buy?

Wooo been banned for a week I gotta stop calling people the F word
What's your portfolio comprised of? Please tell me that it isn't 100% options.
Turns out people were just taking their tendies from yesterday and now they're buying back in
I bought the nio dip 😌

Edit: Shares not calls bc I’m a pussy
From ATH to here. Around 5%
That was fun
Bought a G worth of weekly puts
near support lvls only tits up from now
My portfolio says it another way: “help me PLTR! You’re my only hope!”
It's never not amusing to actually be gay on this sub.
Bought PTON puts at open, it was a fun hour
Can I finally comment
I don’t think so he was big on uvxy last week. I know because there wasn’t many of us.
😎
I don't usually do this, but this comment is so overly-confident and retarded that I have to tag it to come mock you at 4pm
Will BABA recover?
My orders didn’t fill when nio fell to 38. F
Can we just shut the fuck up about this until it goes back to green damn you all lol
Softbank?
Bulls are glorified cows. Bears are marauding killing machines. Choose your side.
RKT usually gets poppin around 12
where is the tech big dick energy??
Still holding those FD's up almost 300 %
I dunno.. Handjees have been keeping the bills paid the last few months, and I don’t even cry any more..
Sold my puts! Let’s go nio!!
Every kiss begins with Kay.
These dips are perfect for intraday scalpling
All you retards thinks aapl will dip are full of shit. You don't know shit and nor do I. Go buy puts on aapl pussy and I do have calls.
I’m holding the hoe, she’ll go up again
I will always buy the dip on Ñio but today sure did pucker my butthole just a smidge
watch RKT smash earnings and proceed to tank
Kodak earnings tonight 👀
 I’m a girl so I do pee while sitting down
It's not even accurate either, its just the bid-ask is so wide, that its looks artificially inflating the value of the contract.
you belong here
Is the election over ?
Somebody in here said RKT would be green by noon - got anything else in that Crystal ball?
Whats your plan now.  I'm stuck with my 1/21 and down 45% and just don't want to sell. This bad news sucks.
oh ok
DONT HOLD A GRUDGE HOMIE, HOLD NIO

Buy the China dip? (talking shares)
This is the way
Vaccine late Nov distrrrr
yeah - saw that before buying the leap - the regulation proposed is not really going to move the needle much. Long run BABA definitely has more upside from where it is today.
my portfolio hopes you're right

I have seen my account go from -7k to +1.2k this morning because of fucking PTON. RIP anyone who panic sold at 93
You may rely on it
ZM put and then it shoots up $17

After getting bamboozled the last two weeks, Theta Gang is smiling again
I wish I doubled down on NIO at -13% today 😓
I lost that in last 5 minutes
Finally bought some calls today and holy shit I feel pretty masculine right now.
I agree that anything in china is sketchy, but this is just silly
Who killed my baba?
Lol we ending 2% green today, this is so easy
Just want to trap a few more male cows for a steak feast the likes of which has never been seen.
Well, all I gotta say is I am happy with the numbers, disappointed with the reaction, and very happy I sold covered calls @40, though I wish I sold them all yesterday instead of 80% of them today at open.
Good analogy

If you didn’t buy QQQ on that morning dip you’re not into money I guess 

🥺
I look back at the last couple weeks. On days that I took profit in the middle of the day I was up huge. Should have stopped and waited and let my other positions do their thing. Did I?  Nope, I jumped right back into the “next” thing. Next days were red days.

During a week like this, don't be giving people ideas lmao
They smashed earnings as I was assuming but still down a few bucks over the last few days. I got lucky and sold my $30 C’s at 1.70, but they should recover nicely once this volatility shitshow ends
I did, and just in time. Thanks for the little push I needed homie.

Do real
I have spent the last 2 days recovering what I lost on each market open dammit
Do those things work?
Rally on a bullshit event that everyone already knows
What a wild ride, I literally came back this week. I’m seeing both sides within 48hrs of trading again.
Day traders play the swings not whether a stock will go up or not
Make my baba weeklies great again!
Relax it’s just money. You’ll be okay. Take it as a hard earned lesson
Of course, this is risky money for sure. However the reason why people are taking risks like this is because brokers are making it super easy and policy is making it hard to get profit anywhere else. 

So, yes, I get why the brokers are like this. On the other hand, they are asking for it
Yep, supposed to be good,  but red day here...
I knew I should have dumped more in to spg😩😩
**the 1st rule of PLTR is you don’t talk about PLTR** 😤
EOD
Bezos just slit a cat's throat and threw it at the ground to see if it'd bounce
PTON up 10% in less than an hour
I dont want to get hard when I order
It is not going to drop. Even if there is another lock down people have a different confidence now. There would have to be something new and uniquely frightening that happens for large drops to happen again. The bear case is a fools errand for now.
So many other surer bets on sale
I fucking hope not
I feel so bad I bought my calls too early 😢
You dumb mother fucker

Stop gambling with shit you can't afford to lose
They r weeklies lol
V shaped recovery for NIO
imagine not rotating out of tech lul

boomers will make it

BA/DFEN 🚀🚀🚀
Exactly. They need to balance between letting competition run free or regulating them ... But this is very over the top
OK
Kate Rooney just so beautiful 😻
Baba is going red to fucking green
Yugeee green dildos
I'm all about Apple's move to ARM, but this is buy the hype, sell the news.  Easy scalp right here.
Is that a gap fill on qqq?
Lexus ls, are you a real estate agent by any chance?
Actually I love these 🌈🐻 rallies honestly.
I spent 10k this morning on ZM, PTON, DocuSign, FVRR, and SHOP.

I do all my buying on days like this.

Already up since the bottom
Maybe he will start calling the lows, like "look what Biden did, he tanked my beautiful DOW to 25k" - then you load up on calls.
shhh let it sleep for max gains
IM BROKE AFTER NIO FUCKED ME 4 MONTHS AGO
Had a dream that Covid was going to be hyped by the media again. Bull r fuk.
Well you're from WSB so I'm guessing they're $10 FDs that you picked up for $0.05. Since they were cheap I'm guessing you also slammed $20k into the position.
buying this fucking dip
It's all good. I also learned it the hard way.
Multiple NIO upgrades from banks. Already beat Q3 delivery expectations. Already sold more ADS to fund operations. Non-GAAP reporting to make up big numbers if they fail. Government ready to bail NIO out of any real trouble.

🇨🇳 **HAVE FAITH** 🇨🇳
What?! I thought it was like a fucking regulation. Fuck!!!!!
Jesus christ, my NIO 62c 12/18 gained so much value from that recovery.
Why does ToS show 0 day trades left when my account is over 25k? I'm safe to execute another day trade right?
FUCK YES!!!!! I was sooo scared I’d never be able to buy NIO under $41 again. Just bought 15% more at $40.75😂😎
preach on... made 6 small trades today, 0/6.     timing all wrong.
Except for regulations. Oh wait....
So what happens after a triple top?
SPY about to be green and bears in shambles again. I hope you morons bought the bottom lol, thx for the dip
NIO is going to be all right. Everyone's jumping on the dip. 44 11/13 is no issue.
Same here.
Just wanna that it’s gonna be fine guys... we’ll be fine
yeah for sure, after a very healthy pullback it usually trades flat, however buyers couldnt push it lower than 39 kept being bought up at resistance so itll push through new aths as it has consistently over the past month
Waiting for some good news maybe?
My point exactly. You can keep fear mongering to try to suppress the share price but for each negative GME post I have a positive one ready. Did you know for example that there is always one 10k check hidden in a used game for sale in a store somewhere.
RKT is officially green, now I rest
eow
Sell off over. AAPL green
Truly autistic
They’ll probably ramp up the news but most people with a brain have realized life will go on. I doubt we’ll see another March level panic dip.
You can still buy nio on a 6% dip, time running out
Are you not concerned about IV killing you?
I thought Joey Bumps was supposed to be good for the China stocks
NIO has been parabolic lately and is starting to crack. It's likely going to visit the 20MA sometime soon
Here comes AMD. Lets go
A cherry 80 or 90s Mercedes convertible
I just want enough money to pay off my car and house, is that too much to ask?
Lol broke my own rule, sold RKT right before this spike
haha look at this retarded robinhood user. every other broker gives unlimited day trades
I bet the nio ceo just tweeted something crazy in Chinese and we’re back on track now
tdoc please keep going up. just want my money back
The reports of NIO's death have been greatly exaggerated!
U rlly gonna blow up ur account being on wsb dont do it
Vz, WMT, COKE, UPS maybe.
😂
Too late now but dont gamble shit you cant lose. Go boring with like 95% shares and shit gamble 5% if you can't afford to lose it all.
2023 calls today
If you would’ve bought at 38 you would’ve been in a much better position
I bought 40p yesterday and flopped into 44c at ~39....

don't worry, still going down.  Apparently CNBC says Millenials saved it today.

Ye, red as fuck here. Sucks ass...
Just buy some SS numbers off the deep net and make a new acc pussy
A true profit
And just like that, FSLY saves my bank account
Yeah, 100%. China sees what happened in the US, where Tech companies are more powerful than government. They're going to do everything in power to cut that off at the knees before it even comes close.
Even more so now that joe is in

My friend, same.
Bruh... that's fucked up. Smh
Panic stage? What's that?
Looks like snap and nio are in cahoots w their charts rn
$400 stock sooner or later. no way of stopping it really

in terms of support I would place the hardcore support around 235. doubt it will get tested unless shit really goes south tho.
I've shifted to more boomer stocks. The past 6 months have been a good run, but the tech sector in general is due for a correction.
TRAIN IS LEAVING THE STATION
ALL OF THEM
Preach brother
Did the Chinese government execute Jack Ma? Wtf is going on with BABA
I think the problem is that if you are hanging out here... on WSB.... you are probably a HUGE liability to any broker.

I wouldn't lend any of you knuckleheads a fucking penny without $400 of cash motherfucking collateral.
Fingers crossed
not sure, after a 14% correction i dont see it dipping more though, its being bought up at 39-40 sellers cant push it down with heavy volume, im very confident in 48 this week though
i have a 55c 11/20 god speed🚀
anyone going in on Lyft puts for earnings?

they don’t have a delivery biz like Uber to help and only in the US. with covid rising outlook sucks for them despite vaccine news
Please help me guys. BABA calls? Any one?
Someone said the move is TSLA 420 puts or calls weekly and you'll be set. I think they were right
NIOOOOOOO
Flip a coin pussy. Heads buy calls. Tails double down and buy more calls
Bring Rona back 🚀
News flash those are weeklies too
It’s just a Hallmark Holiday
He already made 200 on less than 1% of his trade .
Looking to gamble today. Thinking RKT moon on general WSB meme potential into earnings. Prolly will just do shares, because I sure hate being on the wrong side of theta. Others will say coward, but i'll still be posting here next year too.
Oooooh the VIX and VXX are touching me in all the inappropriate places right now!!!! Keep it coming baby!!!!!
They will never understand that. Tech also benefits everyone, even other countries. They cant treat it like a factory/industrial manufacturer.

My portfolio? Yes. Him? Don’t think so!
When you lose $15k on tech calls in 3 days trust me it is
I have said it before and I'll say it again... BEAR R FUK
Sorry brother. It sucks but this too shall pass.
This is a pretty big step forward tho but yeah, need the rotation BACK into tech pronto
I liiiiiiive
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
[deleted]
Shut up 🍊 fuck boy
BABA has very strong support around 269ish. Its already broken though. Its also its 100day moving average. 

Say what you want, maybe AMZN, AAPL and others are overpriced, but I think BABA is still ridiculously underpriced
Someone give me their log in so I can fucking make some day trades
Father,

Forgive us for we know not what we do. Greed, our deadly sin has led astray from you and your holy words. Our lives are falling apart as we suffer the consequences of our temptations. Please forgive us for our actions, and help us recover financially and mentally by making tech stocks shoot up before the EOM and be above the price we bought in. One last chance is all we ask for and we promise to lead in your path.

My tech brothers will continue the prayer now. Please join us fellow tech bulls in our prayer.
*Squidward, if this is your secret account please blink twice*
These posts have to be fake lol
If it happens again and you tell yourself "it wont be like last time i can feel it", try averaging out to secure some profits.  Good outlook mate, losses can be hard mentally.  Sounds like you got a true trader mentality, best of luck.
RALLY HARDER! YOU CAN DO IT SPY!!! SI SE PUEDE
It will, give it time. Hopefully you bought this dip and have strong hands

literally same
Lol pton is hilarious. Just like last time it dropped after earnings and bought right back up.
CAT is a safe bet. I'm basically treating it as a savings account. I've seen decent gains, pays good dividends, and it's pretty stable in this wild market.
Ahhhh yeah when i hit 69% down i took it as a sign. I pretty much stay cash and use my day trades on options. Ill grab some shares during dips. Its been working out well actually

You're fine if you can hold for a bit. They aren't going anywhere, and China is pushing to become more important in the world's economy. I think it looks like a good investment long term.
Sharp as a WSB autist sharp.
Yeah I’m playing the earnings

I’m surprised how many people survived past few weeks in this sub
webear?
This comment is criminally underrated. My Only play for today is to do NOTHING. Just hold, focus on literally anything else and forget about it for right now. I'm sitting on a ZM 12/18 and a NIO 60c 12/18. I have time. Just need to be patient and let them ride. Every time I sold at a loss they ended up recovering eventually so fuck that. Holding strong.
Ooh so kool
That can't be true

It’s now 2040, fellow WSB retards are still waiting on that “epic GameStop short squeeze” 🤣💀

I can argue right back "the Pfizer trial was on non-previously infected people" meaning they didn't have any existing antibodies. 90% is fucking huge for this stage in the trial, Pfizer estimated ~75% as the max range before this stage of the trial.

Learn to not use your existing bias
 

China has released new draft antimonopoly rules for its online platforms, signaling an increased appetite by Beijing authorities to rein in its dominant technology companies.

China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it would seek feedback on rules covering a host of potential anti-monopolistic practices on the country’s digital platforms, including offering different prices to different consumers for the same product.

The release of the new draft rules, the timing of which came as a surprise to some in the market, follows on regulators’ abrupt intervention last week to [halt the initial public offering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-group-ipo-postponed-by-shanghai-stock-exchange-11604409597?mod=article_inline) of Ant Group Co.

Still down ytd. Good job!
Today is just try to relatively evaluate non tech over tech. Which is probably a bit true if we went back to exactly before covid, but thats not how it is going to play out.
Kicking myself. Yesterday afternoon one of you said give me one good reason why I shouldn’t load up on ACB puts? And I thought. Yeah! Why shouldn’t we? And then I did something else and forgot. Glad for you tho whoever you are.

Thanks for the downvote lol
It’s sad it was just at these numbers like a week and a half ago lol
Tripled down when PINS hit 52.75 and have now exited my position.
A higher low above 352 forming.

Hope y'all bought the dip on Big Dick Energy aka gamestop.
Anyways, um... I bought a whole bunch of shungite rocks, do you know what shungite is? Anybody know what shungite is? No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison. I'm talkin' shungite. Anyways, it's a two billion year-old like, rock stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. That's my story, I bought a whole bunch of stuff. Put 'em around the la casa. Little pyramids, stuff like that.
I have no clue so just make sure you have a plan if it goes down just in case. It could very likely have a relief bounce, but I think the downside is greater than the upside
Really 2$ per contract? I have never seen Spy contract that cheap

almost broke, gambling with 150k my parents have saaved up ontop of the 40k i have as a working college student, and today i officiallly lost all of my money. Only have 2k of the 40k i had...literally sweating. cannot lose my rents money. they have been poor for ever
Gonna need a lot of viagra for that
How can the price drop by almost $100.00 overnight? I was thinking of focusing on 1 stock  but I imagine if you'd invested in ZOOM, even if you were up to date with the news, you probably won't have the chance to sell at the top considering this dramatic change. How does this happen and is there a way to prevent this massive loss ? (excluding diversifying). Will a stop loss work even if its after market?
[deleted]

Boomers rotating out of tech into value stocks just as America enters “the darkest phase of the COVID-19 pandemic” (per Scott Gottlieb) 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I hope that as news of the lines outside GME (and other retailers) for people who want the new consoles circulates a bit we will see a swing in the momentum. Consoles by themselves i dont think are going to trigger the squeeze. Will be interested to see short interest later today.

Na dude. This is what they call a bull trap. A little bounce to get you thinking it's over so you put more money in before it crashes again.
I think this is a good opportunity to double down on NIO
Part of it is that the dollar index got 50c stronger yesterday and probably has some room to run
Stonks are stonkpid =/

Nio is safe
[deleted]
Just got a NIO 42c for 11/13. My luck it continues to freefall heading into tomorrow with everything else.
I didn’t use even 50% of my allowed margin. My broker: 🗣 margin call your position is down. I’m like alright I’ll sell a covered call take off some of my margin balance with that. Broker: 🗣 margin call your position is down! I’m like alright chill I only had it for an hour here I’ll sell another covered call reduce my balance and my inverse ETF shares are up my account is fine. Broker:🗣 margin call your position is down! Damn it my fucking account is up stop worrying about the one fucking position I used a couple hundred dollars for.
When I zig, the market zags. I'm definitely an investor and not just gambling 😎

nah thats tech. ROTATE OUT OF TECH ARE YOU STUPID
The earnings were awesome....way better than I expected. I'd look at this as an opportunity to grab more shares and leaps.
I'd give you a play but I'm at a loss right now.

I have $10k in my hands and idk where to put it.

I might just... buy... shares.... *puke*

Ah, yes, common sense. I have very little.

I think they need to do some serious innovation
Uhh excuse me NIO. I didn’t say stop.
What about tomorrow morning? Up or down what do you think?
The hardest thing for me is to do nothing. I have this need/urge to actively manage my investments even when there is nothing to do. Often time, this results in me cutting loose from a position just because it’s down a bit when I had intended on staying long. Every time I get impatient and make a move I lose. 

I need to remember this. I need to just sit tight. My positions have time.

Why baba why
same... how much $$$ you have in AMZN?
Idk why y’all are saying tech bull trap when amazon is at low of day
More earning potential = More money to put into the market. I was putting chump change in working $15 an hour, but with $70K starting salary as an ultrasound tech I'll be able to throw a lot more money at it. I'll just watch my current investments grow till then. Gotta play the long game sometimes.
Let’s go NIO you can come back, you dirty slut!
you just need to hit big on that one time you guess correct and the 9 wrong ones wont matter. 

OR

you can be a retard like the rest of us and somehow manage to guess wrongly 11 times out of 10.
RIP
How much more growth do you want? It’s up 2000% for the year. That’s what asset bubbles do. Don’t be stuck holding the bag when it goes back to sub 20s man.
With that amount of money you could easily trade 1-5% daily
So it’s pumping? I’m not looking at RH til EOD

Take your gains before earnings.. last earnings RKT was in the $30-$35 range and look at where it is today.

I bought the tech dip. SQ, BABA, JD, TDOC, SE and more. Am I gonna die now
even the non software companies rely on software companies that provide them with the software and infrastructure cloud etc etc

there is no economy without tech people really need to understand that
Just joking about how their earnings releases have been when the market is at all time highs and teetering on a correction.
You can't. Just close the app and give up on this stock stuff, you too much of a bitch to be fuckin with this.
[deleted]
Ok you know what. I have an EPP where each month, part of my salary goes to buy my company’s stock

2 shares bought = 1 free share.

Each month I get to buy a few. 

Company stock has been solid and is definitely excellent long term investment.

Maybe I should do the boomer thing and stop buying hype stock, and instead focus on getting promotions and salary increases.
Wait, some people here still think Apple goes up from its events???

PLTR calls is free money. PLTR has been rallying like crazy since listed on the market and it poised to destroy earnings.

INO ... strange movement on a day like today
Biden is going to ignore the stock market and maybe raise the capital gains tax. Which doesn't matter to me because I either 1. expire OTM make 0$. 2. Make gains which I immediately reinvest. I don't take any money out so there's nothing to tax.
Some of them yes
same here
Both!  You nailed me like NIO nailed me at open 💩
So how much are you really Down
Can’t wait until everyone realizes jack ma is China.
Thoughts on paypal its RSI is around 11. and down big. Could be on sale.
plz let nio close at 45 today
buy a call at 40, then sell a call at 44.
RKT gonna crush earnings today
Fukin*
What explains the dip in BABA? Surely not the small top line miss in the latest earnings or the ANT failed IPO. That was already priced in last week from 320. It's definitely a macro trend of phasing out of tech to other industries, hence the bloodbath in tech for the past two trading sessions.
retards say stop listening to fiNaNCiAl AdViSOr
Thanks, I grabbed the 25c.
Scared because you have puts?
NIO finding out who the real ones are today. And then blessing us with a fat ER 😩
Fucking hell, market recovering but AMZN keeps drilling.
PayPals option is looking like it’s heading to zero. PayPal itself is looking bullish it’s looking like a buy the dip scenario, but it’s not getting close to 205 in two weeks. Twitter is good too, but depends how much you paid for it.
yep
[removed]
It really do be like that
I said fuck it and bought 10 shares today. If it tanks I probably lose a hundred bucks or so, but last time I had a feeling about this it was Tesla and I bitched out. I would have made thousands, this was when it was at like 190 before the stock split.
I’ll fix your life if you listen.

If you can get a socket wrench, remove the passenger and back bench seat of your car for way more living space. You said you don’t have any friends or family that talk to you so those seats are just going to waste. Find a goodwill and pick up some warm clothes and a sleeping bag with your last $40 and start looking for temporary job or homeless shelters. You need to eat.

Stop trying to start a business when you have no runway, that’s a pipe dream. Most people have to earn it, you are one of those people so get to it. 

If you aren’t broken physically, the military sounds like a good place for you, it helped me a lot financially when I was your age and it literally solves housing/food/healthcare/etc. go into something useful civilian side and light on physical labor and don’t let the meat heads who snicker because your not out there ruining your back bother you. 

After one 4 year contract, you should have a marketable skill and some savings. If you don’t like the military life, get out and apply for work in your field. It’s best to go into the Army Reserve at this point to keep your health insurance (it’ll change to Tricare reserve select which is an astoundingly good deal) and some income. 

If you stay in the reserves for 16 years after your active duty time you will qualify for a lot of benefits down the road (retirement, cheap heath insurance, etc) If you stay active duty for 20 you’ll get more and sooner. A 20 year stint in just the reserves equals about $750,000 in benefits and savings from my calculations.

Source: Lived in my car for a while when I was a wanderer after getting back from Iraq where I was a meathead who snickered at pogues. Current reservist who puts away bank from my day to day job because my healthcare is cheap af.
Are you holding through earnings? Bought a lotto ticket yesterday just in case it pops
Added to my BABA leaps - guess who'll be selling you autists BABA OTM calls when this thing starts trending up!

Nice call!

Wondering if there is any reason this wouldn’t go back down to single digits over the coming weeks. What do you think about 7-8 stick puts expiring in January?
Buy more nio
Ba puts shit always dumps on a run
:D I'm in the same boat, and it's still going down  
:DDDDDDDD
I'm buying SHOP and GME right now. SHOP should be up twenty percent in a couple weeks and GME is going to go to 1000 ofc.

Also I still made money on those weed stock shorts even though all the analyst retards said that flat revenue is somehow a "revenue beat" and pumped the Aurora 20% because POT STOCKS ALWAYS SELL OFF. Stick to your guns when you short them.
Lol and some retard was telling me to play it :( the other day for 10x
Depends on the market. The mood isn't good for tech right now
My financial advisor said I should stop listening to the retards on here :/

ppl didnt give a shit about congress yelling at jeff bezos but theyre scared of the CCP.. sigh. these are the same fucking retards that decided the best reaction to a train crashing was to lie about... everything. they are not the brightest bunch.

either way - it doesnt matter. BABA = china. china = bullish bigly growth blah blah. people will buy the dip. no matter what. so long as joe is playing nice.

I literally cashed out and sent 15k to bank.  For once I'm not losing my money and being a retard

It could potentially fill a really huge gap towards the downside. Set a tight stop loss
Just buy vaccine stocks
Yes the company that sells 5000 cars that’s worth more than Ford and GM is the safest bet. Godspeed.
NIO earning positions?
That was thorough easy to interoperate and summarized. Thank you so much I had just watched a video on you tube that was an hour long. 30 mins in I’m thinking there’s no way it’s this complicated. Thank you again!
eod might be pushing it
So I guess AMC will just continue getting shorted down to zero? The virus news was one thing, but the short squeeze hasn't even been close to happening yet... Diamond handing these calls for months, but it's starting to get annoying as fuck. I'm still over 200% profit, but fuck the low volume massive fucking sell-off...
No
🧠 or 💩
Donald dump tweeted yesterday about market
I should've realized this is the new norm for earnings.

CRSR earnings smashed expectations, stock plummets.
Glad I didn’t hold through earnings cos knowing me I’d end up not selling market open
What have you bought. Just got into TDOC and CRWD
Yes
Is a 90 bagger really too much to ask for
nio 🚀
No
Made all the right plays yesterday so of course I gotta make all the wrong ones today 🤡
How you feel about PLTR?  Have some calls on it 11/20 but looks iffy
I think it does. This was the natural pull back everyone was waiting for. That’s why I hate short dated calls.  I see it 48-50$ for next week. Could  run up after earnings now bc dipped before it.

Feels weird that the market is so red because of a vaccine. I get the rotation from tech but everything should be booming really. Election is still over, still should be getting some stimulus, and now we'll have a better economic recovery so less uncertainty about the future. This dump feels fake and gay.

From my understanding it’s basically on general market conditions mainly. Overall market right now is bearish so beating earnings doesn’t do much. If it beat earnings last week it would’ve probably popped

Tech is going to win long term, the whole every company is a software company, just some know that and others don't. That said everyone is try to dump profits to rotate into what ever ia going to bump after vax. Just buy tech on the way down and win.
Fucking Europoors don't have enough on their plate already  with the rona and the lockdowns and the terrorism, no they come after amazon

You deserve to be smited motherfuckers
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚
I'm dog shit on technicals but why not look for a trend reversal before buying? To me this has a lot of good indicators for the start of a fade trade but considering the market is down as a whole you might be catching the falling knife and any stop limit orders you set have a high chance of being hit. Personally I would wait for  the price to close upward between 1st and 2nd BBand to confirm the reversal.
I just bought Zoom. Is this retarded?
Yeah, AMZN calls are probably free money. It's not like people are going to stop shopping at Amazon.
Disagree, you are 2/3 the way there. Buying on Fomo after big gap when everyone is watching (check). Found a call in the YOLO range - cheap for now due to unlikelihood of profitability (check). Third thing, what you missed, is finding a way to beat COVID or disregard it. You went straight at it with cruise ships as your weapon and got figgity fucked.
So we just ignoring the virus or....?
Ironic post, retard
Damn today is a day trader's dream lol
I would prefer a nice egg instead.
How CLX is making money is not clear to me, because the product has not been on shelf since march.

You must be kicking yourself
When will Nautilus go back up again?
BA Oct deliveries = -13 planes
Could not turn down BABA under 270.
his bullshit is causing this, so fuck off with him.
Wasnt the one that posted it but definitely the one thats been tryina push people towards it and away from NIO/TSLA

Edit: Congrats bro sweet gains
I actually meant the post more focussed on the fact FT used a meme in one of their articles
Yeah it's way oversold. ARK invest keeps adding as well, which may be a good sign. 

Remember this company has LVGO merger now, so I think just based on that it is undervalued.
Make RKT meme again!
Baba red to green starting now. SIKE

The only thing going down is your wife on my cock

No bears don't gloat as much, from what I've seen. It's just the nature of feeling bad about negativity while making money.
So when is that gme short report coming out. After hours?
LOL good game bro
GO BECKY GO
covid-20 coming soon dont worry
Calls?
It’s official.... I’m retarded
You sound like a doctor
Any IVR niggas?
A standard correction and profit taking
yup.   qqq new ath on thursday is my bet
You
Honestly if you buy GME. You’re retarded and know nothing about business, stocks and gaming. Enjoy losing your money
Here we go!!!
Acb is not cheap right now. It's still expensive as fuck.
I thought spooky season was over
I lose money both ways to balance it out 🤓
Memes aside this was a huge lesson learned. I got greedy after feeling like I had a big dick from the wild ride up last week and I probably didn't deserve any of the gains I saw on Monday. If I had even a modicum of common sense I'd have sold everything Monday morning and waited a bit to see what the market sentiment was, and then I'd be sitting on 11k of buying power instead of this.

Don't be greedy, it will catch up with you. I'm down another $600 from when this picture was taken.
Buy high sell low, that’s the name of the game
It has the fundamentals, just horrible timing.
To someone with 420.69 IQ, what’s the best earnings play for NIO
Yeah, this ain't the dip to buy
Lol ..just saw it ..recovered 6%
YES
You bitch you
It wasn't me daddy, I promise!! I bought puts at the top too :D
We already dipped 5% lol
Just sold my puts, cash gang and nio calls now
IPOs are expensive...
Apple to announce 1 trillion stimulus
Big whale move into QQQ calls, so I think yes
You sure though?
SoftBank doubling down Lol
🙏🏼 We eating
Tweeto Cheeto is never fully priced in
Damn, wish HOG would come back down \~34 so I could grab more
What cause the drop anyone knows?
I feel personally attacked
I'd hold, due to possibility of a lock down. If they are shares, definitely hold. If soon expired options, I'd sell end of week of end of today due to high volitility.
Volume low looks more like sellers are exhausted. I think we dump more but when? Who knows.
I don’t disagree, but politics is a cesspool
There's a new anti-trust policy that'd primarily affect giant ecommerce company like BABA that was launched today. Right before 11/11 mega sale.
Baba 275 eod
Did you buy the dip?  Why not dumbass?
Look, I've seen a lot of fake pumps in my day but this one is very real.

If you haven’t sold now... RIP.
So when dat 1.1 Patch coming in to fix these bugs? Its unplayable rn.
The social security money that would have gone to seniors over 65 who died from covid should be redistributed as the stimulus payment.  I think that's something everyone can agree on.

Wait, you bought Amzn puts and made 5 million ?

I’m guessing you chose NIO
Lots of tech stocks rely on advertising to turn profits and idk, looking sketchy compared to what is expected for most of them.

Stuff like AMD, sure.
I played Puts 

Trade Update:

SPY Puts

Market opened down a bit today.  If the market pumps over 355.5 I am going to close the rest of the puts.  I think its possible that previous ATH's get tested again 358 from the downside and this would be another trade.  I am not gonna give this trade a lot of upside room because as we have seen things can really get moving quickly. If the market breaks below 353.22 (1 hour 21 ) that would be ideal.  For now though it looks like spy is finding support above the 1 hour 21.   I have a lot of people messaging me if I am in or out of plays so I will try to post updates as much as possibe.  For now if 355.50 breaks I am out on the rest of the puts.  

Even as I am typing this the market is starting to sell down more.  Watch this hourly close too see if price action closes above or below 1 hour 21. 

Chart: https://www.tradingview.com/x/Kv18gMIa/

Trade Update

SPY Puts

The puts are now in the money so I am moving my stop loss closer.  The 1 hour 21 on SPY is at 353 right now which is now my SL.  A hourly close over that area and I will be taking a profit.  I recommend taking some profit here as this has already been a pretty good play.. dont get greedy with any plays.  I have my finger on the sell button incase there are any pumps. 

Looking like this will easily be a 5k+ profit play

Trade Close

Exited spy puts as it looks like the market is finding support in the 350-351 area.  Almost 6K profit on the trade.
Mines 284... unfortunately
Sounds nice. I never have time for that anymore.
Balls deep in AZN and I can’t for the life of me figure out why it’s up

The logistics to distribute the vaccine will be horrible. I followed a report on it this morning and they estimate a 2-3 years gap between release and actual worldwide capillar distribution. 

You need two shots at a 2 week distance to be vaccinated, so 14 billion doses will be needed to vaccinate the whole world. around 4 billion people don't even have access to a reliable logistics network (underdeveloped countries), so it will be 2-3 years before rich countries will be ok, probably more for those poor bastards in africa/asia/south america etc.

Vaccines also need to be kept at a stable, cool temperature, so that's another hassle. It will be a long and painful process before covid-19 will be archieved and routinely dealt with like we already do with seasonal flus etc
Thank you whoever bought puts at the bottom. We would still be drilling if it weren't for you
When you sell a spread to get paid if it doesn't get breached. $ABC is trading at 100 and you think it won't go below $90. You sell the $90 and buy a further one (e.g. $80) to limit your loss if it goes against you. You get paid say $166 and as long as it doesn't get breached, you keep the money. It's a theta play.

If it tanks after earnings I might just have to buy $5k worth of more shares

Honestly even before tariff man you should never hold Chinese stocks long term. They always pull some type of shit

May never use a computer again!
No way SPY will be as low as 330 by 11/30 right, all major negative catalysts are priced in at this point (election, no stimmy, vaccine months away)

Yeah; I think this is a $30 stock but people keep buying it and I just kept watching free money fly by; figured might as well be me making some of it.  Adding, "don't do anything in the first 15 minutes of market open" to my rules that I'll try not to break...

It's okay NIO. You go when you feel like it buddy I'll still be here. Watching. Waiting. Jelqing.
I got out with a small gain. The vaccine news pushed them too far too fast, but I wasn't confident in a bigger correction than this.
Drill Team 6 get back to work!
Welcome to the club.  Start by reading the sidebar, specifically the part about loss porn values.
News dump: 

1. Jack Ma apparently ran afoul of Chinese PRC officials by being a bit cavalier in the run up to Ant IPO. So they pulled him in a last minute meeting and said that Ant was about to be subjected to new scrutiny, yet to be decided or specified...

So they pulled the IPO until they knew what that meant (not sure if they do yet). 

2. Before Singles Day apparently talk circles around trying to regulate e-com companies, in general and anti monopoly policies. Some have been drafted (perfect timing from the PRC) and they aren’t passed, but it’s got the market spooked, likely moreso given the Ant IPO being put on hold.
It's down 7.5%.....
Lmao ur a retard sell them ASAP on a bounce
Are we the same person
Just wanted to let you guys know I made 20k on nio puts

You have no idea what you are talking about. "Modern product line" seriously my G? They legit have the worst infotainment system out of any of their competitors as they always use the previous generation Mercedes infotainment system. On top of that they have virtually no really exciting cars in their line up. The DBX is a blatant cash grab that wants to imitate the success of the Urus, which will never happen. On top of that the only exciting prospect, the Valkyrie, has been at best halted in development and production and if things come bad it might even be axed. 

  
Their current line up is bland and boring no one is buying their cars over the competition. Also good luck with all that debt they have.
If I held anything rn I would have probably $Rope by now.
I’m overall very pessimistic about the market in short term

That being said I hope RKT PLTR CL AAPL CNR IVR all moon right NOW

At least it sounds like you didn’t take out that SBA loan as well to gamble with from 4 months ago.

Just realize you’re not going to get rich fast gambling. You need a career/job- that’s the only way you’re going to dig yourself out of this mess. This recession is going to sting for new graduates, just as it did for those of us who graduated in 2008. I used that recession as an excuse for a couple years to not do anything to better myself. Please don’t be like me.

Does that include tech giants? AAPL, BABA? AMD? Thought that a lot of AMD gains were not covid based to be honest. 

Also when these stocks (besides aapl) get their valuations adjusted upwards, are these valuations considering that we will have covid for the next 5 years..?
...didn’t that already happen I swear half the comments here said NIO yesterday
bought some calls yesterday.... calls fucked.

bought some puts today.... puts getn fucked.

fuck this shit
Hope yall bought that nio dip
But CHGG calls today out to next year. It's not reliant on a vaccine but was still effective by the news. I'm convinced on the upside.
$44.9477; beat you.  I ignored all the TA, the sky-high RSI, the screaming-green MACD, and FOMO'd trying to make a quick couple bucks on a day-trade since this stock is retarded.  Guess I'm wheeling now ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
If it is it's a pretty gentle one.
Okay. Apparently since a vaccine maybe coming out later next year, people will stop using technology and throw their smartphones away. Got it
Some of you really feel like you have to make plays everyday don’t you ? Lol
Nsdq bulls shaking out dumdumbs. Everyone thought yields are getting better, definitely not so where do they go? Stonks
Nah I’ll be good
I rode ACB puts from the top and kept adding all the way down to yesterday and somehow I am still basically break even. The IV is too high it’s impossible to make money on. I’m getting out. Even if it gaps down tmrw, somehow I’d get IV crushed further. Risk to reward isn’t there anymore imo.

Idk, volume is weaker on this uptrend
Bought AMD, AMZN dip
I keep buying weekly SQQQ puts. I think I hate money
Fuck Robinhood all my homies hate robinhood.

Let me tell you something NIO hasn’t even begun to peak, and when it peaks you’ll know. Because it’s gonna peak so hard everyone in r/wallstreetbets is gonna feel it.
Up
Thanks for the advice but I already understand this concept and I have learned from it but even with that knowledge I still think I should not sell yet. Maybe ill kick myself over it in the future but scared money don’t make money.
Who cares you're an old geezer
Did I actually time a dip right for once ?
Got in on another 1k shares
Also not a bad play
How did you get this picture of me? That is a violation of my privacy.
modern problems require boomer solutions
Consolidated 3 calls into one strong position on that NIO dip, hoping this eV shape recovery holds up
Lmao 150s I’m in, green tomorrow?
Good news you’re already there
Why the fuck did I buy yesterday?
I‘m down 50%, nice
What expire date
It’s pumping from all the retards who put money into Nikola. They desperately want to get some money back, but Nikola has no unique technology so they are destined to fail.
Alright boomers the day is yours.. but our rebound is imminent old farts.
yes
Gap filled. Now we moon 🚀
Yes I am very optimistic
Red head was kinda cute
[deleted]
This didnt age as well as it should have
SPG ☄️
I was wrong, and I just can't reeeeeeee without you
If I have to buy the dip one more time I’ll be out of cash
ban
Super fake pump
Look nio is doing it again.
Adamantium hands engaged.
Okay folks I finally gave in and bought puts on QQQ. So that should be the bottom.  Go ahead and inverse me
Thermo Fisher is slept on. Great company.
This is definitely gonna get me to give it up for good
ccp has puts on their own big tech companies
Offyikes is the word of the day
What happens to a spring when u stretch it out and let it go?
Nio reversal 😄
Thank you for your sacrifice fam
Back to the moon boys
Gonna have to wait it out even if I’m waiting weeks. Not taking an L on this
Time to check how my BABA calls from yesterday are doing
Then you ain't black.
It was pretty good.
and im a gold member, feel neglected especially with their limited customer service
Hey now nobody likes a sore loser
Aight, I swapped into calls at 39... Wheeeee!!!
Just went into 11/20 CRSR 40c. Bout to blow my brain tomorrow
just bought more NIO all in bb
Or just sell when you see Mango tweeting about the market being high lol
🤣

Truth be told, pretty good at losing money so far...
What time is Trump speaking at the AAPL event about AMZN?
I think I'll play with a small bit of money. Any suggested positions?
I’m not screaming manipulation, but Wall Street is shady as fuck
Guess who’s back, back again, NIOs back, tell a friend
Goddamn you SPG. Paper handed my 85c this morning when it looked like it was dumping. Immediately turns around and rallies to $85 lmao
FOMO cucks with paper hands sold off and let the MMs buy it up under $40 again. Here we go to $50 EOW.
I am, I believe the saying is, taking a licking today.
😏
fake pump gonna sell sell sell all the bags
I thought buying more calls today was a big brain play
NIO said Ight I’ll steal my own rocket fuel 📈
[removed]
Are you all fearful... because I'm feeling greedy. Hope I don't die
Yeah, but he won’t be bragging about the Biden economy right before it tanks. We will still get the mental illness and humor but we may lose the insider info he drops.
Get manipulated bro
My thought was that he’s on WSB, so he probably has some earlier losses to offset.
I’m in the same boat with pot stocks
Fully in meme stock calls and my wife's boyfriend made me sleep on the couch last night
Rumors of more Chinese internet regulation
[deleted]
If I wanna laugh at detached morons, I just browse r/politics
That’s exactly why he should have bought calls. Always inverse WSB. Problem is that if he started this week, he literally bought the top yesterday
Buy high sell low. Welcome to Wall Street bets.
NIO GREEN EOD🚀
Are we v shaping?
Autist reflection
if you panic sold your nio go take a long look at yourself in the mirror
350.79 - 361 gap has been filled. Resuming moon mission now.
And a 6ft Christmas Tree. Suddenly buying in at $43 isn’t so bad
Imagine if NIO closes green.
Yours would be too if you saw these gainz
SELL IT BRUH 😭 i lost so much from baba
Hold, jesus, people see a little bit of red and they panic
Better hurry. Im already 200$ up
Shit we’re poor again
Bought a 349 Spy Put 11/18.  Spy should go up now
I'm very happy
Woe to anyone who doubted NIO.

You guys are so fucking ignorant. For the next year, every time there’s a major opportunity, there will be a rotation out of tech. Once reality sets in, the trend will reverse. This isn’t madness, it’s pretty predictable aside from the specific catalysts. Make your plays accordingly and you’ll make money.
TQQQ calls?
I’m here
you can tell its boomer season when AMD is red and intel is green

IBM and INTC.   Boomer stocks saving me today.
I’m out of puts. Time for calls??? Google  1760C 11/13. 🤔🤔🤔 I should’ve bought 10 mins ago.
Im down 1500
If baba falls so does the entire country of China. I like my chances...especially now that they have control of the US in a few months
Imagine buying amd calls back in 2012 and making your school filthy rich in the process so they can finally upgrade their Workstation PCs wirh the newest Fx6300 in 2020 for just 5000$

No one’s said that in two months
Fake pump. SELL SELL SELL
No manipulation. Healthy market my man
I'm good. Thanks, just playing around and lost one.

Nasdaq is at least going down to the bottom line. After that we’ll see https://i.imgur.com/BuMPwsY.png

Intel has no business being green. Fuckin boomers, killing my tendies... 
I should've known tho, day 2 is always the bigger dip.
Ok I’m done gambling. Doubled down. NIO 50c 11/27 @ 42.20 and 40.50. Shutting off RH
I’m poor bro.  Only FDs for me
I’m squaring up w anyone buying a BYND burger
The best part is he’d be up over 50% in a less than two hours had he done this
I bought at $45
Buy high sell low my favorite strategy
Cant make it up. I sell my puts and reverse etfs yeaterday morning. Then market starts bleeding.
I may be down, but I'm not out although that may be my last yolo. Bad joo joo.
Welcome!
Legit question but why is li auto so low when they are the only Chinese EV profiting?
Just made $300 on spy you looser
NIO never hurt me again baby.

Stop trading on emotions.
Oof
Trump would need to overturn over 230K votes in 4-5 states. It’s not gonna happen. Maybe gets some votes tossed in PA, NV, and AZ, but it won’t be enough to change the election. Biden will end up winning GA.
Those market mother fuckers
good advice
Since when did we allow /r/stocks to invade us?
STNG at full sail... TANKER GANG!!!
When is earnings?
Oh so you’re the guy that panic sold me those calls I’m up 50% on
Note to yourself, dont sell when a stock is already down 9%
You also sold calls way too early?
This comment sums up reddit outside of this sub
Etsy skyrocketed 90-100% in a month on earnings expectations. Everyone thought they'd be making bank on the face mask craze. Earnings showed that they did profit but it was definitely lukewarm. Wouldnt be surprised if everyone's taking profit now that the market is extrememly bearish.
Fuckin aal smacked me in the dick with that offering, had to grind AMD on the 15m chart to make it back. That was stressful.
Nio has absolute retard strength and if I didn’t have a computer graphics lab right now to not see the bottom and reversal I would have killed my self holy shit
It dumps even more apparently
Cashed out my spy put hedges. Hoping for a reversal soon to save my other calls :/
Where is the AAPL hype?
Congrats 🌈🐻s you get your quarterly retard party today.

Enjoy getting your teeth kicked in the next 90 days
[deleted]
I bought on the way down, first at 178, then around 170. Hoping virus fears can pump this shit higher
Grow up.

You have no case because: "it was scary" isn't damages.
how else do you think he makes money
I just know some cucks bought NIO puts as soon as it broke $40 lmfao
Did BABA sell fake meats or what? I thought that was BYND
TA bounce/longer squeeze was my expectation. I was wrong.
>RKT 

just buy stocl
Get in NIO before ya miss it 🚀
Who missed the NIO boat???up 40%

If it moons I will never forget you and will pour some tendies out for the homies we lost along the way
oof size bigly
Msft buying oppo
I mentioned T because they found massive vote switching in MI machines auto switching from T to B, and 450K ballots that were only filled in for B and no other offices.  Weird to say the least.  Not a partisan issue
They beat earnings last time to and barely moved bc market was fucked.
Oh I am but I still find it sort of ridiculous
Lol wtf he's Pakistani not Indian and I got the idea he set out to defraud because he was convicted of Fraud.
Overall sell off... too close to the top I think
I’m in AMD 11/20 87 and holy shit this sucks lol
I want to, but I don't want to sell my positions to do so. I know its stupid, I even have a WeBull account with a few positions in it already. This may be the last straw though
Please please please be the bottom jesus
I’m trying to figure out their actual market value.  I know it doesn’t matter for short term calls/puts but this seems like the stock to do a leap on as it dives down with escalating Chinese tension due to the state dept.  That’s why it’s diving right?
Looks like you’re going to be traveling like Fred Flintstone, Yabba Dabba Doo! 🤣
I think they issued more stock so yeah, you unfortunately got extra unlucky here.
I’m truly sorry to anyone holding NIO or PLTR calls at open that had the robinhood error, but that GUH must have been incredible
SCHWAB WTF?
SPY break 351 and then bulls are fuk
Every retard in wsb says "backed by the CCP"
It's literally only backed by a tier 2 city local government. CCP doesn't give a shit if it's NIO, they can support whatever brand as long as it's ev.

yall are living and dying on 0.5% movements.


Feels decent actually being in STONKS right now. 2-3% red day, no sweat. I would be $ROPE if balls deep in options.

Also i saw NIO down 13% intraday. better load up
if you squat and pee then a BYND burger is for you
Yeah I am still new to all this but I can see why people say fuck RH. I am switching as well once I get out of my positions.

How about next time you feel panic, don’t sell
I think you aren’t familiar with their target audience

Will see.
OOF

Not even true, people who buy green lambos are not car guys. Red ferrari, okay, but still. If any schmuck wins the lotto the first thing they buy is a green or orange lambo or red ferrari because it screams 'I have money'. Same with rich oil sheikhs, YouTubers, or young people who are new money somehow. Real car people buy other brands, some include Aston, lots buy porsche, Mclaren, konenigsegg, list goes on. Green lambos = swinging dicks. Grey Aston or a 911 = actual gentlemen who get motorsport

New knuckle tats: HATE ALGO
Holy fuck what the fuck did BABA do to deserve this
Pepperidge Farm remembers
I actually laughed out loud
Anyone else sell NIO towards the bottom? Still profit, but damn it feels bad. So I moved deeper ITM when it really cratered. 🤷‍♂️
Getting crushed right now wow thanks trump
At what price?

If you bought at ~11 or less, you should have sold at ~15, and if you bought at anything over 12.50 you're a maroon.

I have no belief in GME as a company until they make a change. This new CEO everyone is fawning over has yet to actually announce or enact any significant change, and the brief growth of GME can be attributed to new CEO hype, new consoles, and the holidays.
He hasn’t officially won yet! MSM fake newds! - /r/conservative
Dollar values don’t fucking matter, you’re up 400% whether that’s with $2 or $200000. It’s still a huge profit and you should probably realize some of it
BTFD

With the money you save by living in a hybrid you can get your life back with NIO calls.

Ya we are fine brother. This is just a healthy pullback. BABA isn't a scam company. Sure it's China but we have a President coming in who is pro China and there's very little time for melon to fuck this up more. It'll bounce back. 320 end of year is my prediction
Sucks balls to be me today.
You know that it’s time to buy when stocks like Thermo Fisher or Microsoft fall 3% in 10 minutes and >10% in two days without any specific company related reason
Bruh
Of course. 🤔
Good entry for CRSR here
Damn, the AMZN 3100/3140c 11/13 debit spread I just bought 30 minutes ago was probably an awful idea

Did it help?
So i was up so much today and today I’m down so much 🥺🥺
Going balls deep in GLD leaps and not looking at my account until January. See you all tomorrow.
;]
Hold
It looks to be stabilizing a bit. I think it was a natural pullback until people who FOMO'd in yesterday started panic selling. It's back above the $40 support. My shares sold off and my Jan calls took a small hit but my 11/13 might still have a chance if we close above $42 today.
No the first one..
"Honey, did you hear? Vaccine is out! Wait why are you crying? What's wrong?"

My solar leaps are getting the dickins right now god damn
What the shite happened to BABA? Can't find news on it...
Missed this one. Still way up on the year. Looks like I'm not YOLO material.
When is the expiry date?
Bears wipe back to front
With you on that...   This market is wheels-off nuts right now!
Save my portfolio Joe!
Oh yeah man it’s a lot. This is anecdotal so take with as you will, but I know more people using ONLY Corsair peripherals and hardware than any other brand. They have a great brand image and they are well established. I think they’re worth buying shares and holding for the long haul
Are you Italian?
Took my NIO gains and bought 12/18 200 PYPL calls
RH being extra dumb right now. I bought a position, it says the position filled and is open, but it also says I have the buying power I used to get it and the movement in the position isn’t showing in my lines. Idk if I should just sell the thing to not have to worry
Are y'all buying more zoom?
Not nice assuming he set out to defraud just because he's indian

^zoom ^out ^on ^charts ^ohhh
Yes I was trembling with excitement that they were one sale
Nope.  If they followed Jim Cramers advice they would have had a “barbell portfolio” anyway

We all knew the vaccine was coming eventually
Imagine not buying the NIO dip
My initial investment was only like 400$ anyway, wish it was more though lol
Fall one more time NIO so I know this support is real
There is so much that can go right besides that...  Moderna is making a Pfizer type announcement next week, gonna moon this.  Any stimmy announcement will moon this.  Short interest will cause a squeeze and this will moon...  Good luck!
Jpow,.jpow. hurry up and print more bank reserves! It will help tech stocks go back up because...because, umm, uhhh,....it just does.

They are gonna have to sell that school building
Lol you’re an idiot
Yeah and then based on the time you bought you can get back a large part of your initial investment if you don't like the choice for the merger. 

Also if you do and it ends up being a few that have been speculated 22-23 is a steal for now and will only shoot up when the announcement is made....sooooo buy while its cheap...with little downside to losing a large amount of money...

Need XPEV spike up for their earnings tomorrow. Carry NIO with it
great dd
Sold at open fkkkkk
I wouldn’t buy weeklies unless you are playing earnings today. But this is a pretty healthy pullback, very bullish on this pullback more than any this year so far.
Ok SPY. Time to go Super Saiyan
Overfucked
That was one massive dump. Things are going up it seems.
Wait, some stocks go down when the market dumps?  I thought only ETFs could go down
Up 30 % on NIO calls bought just 5 mins back
I'm glad you have retained the services of a licensed professional, [never ever listen to this place](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqynwj/120_to_13920_in_one_weekend_thanks_biden/gbu5so1/) about taxes

Taking everything in my power to not short the market
Sell at the moments notice is the only way for now.

TD wouldn't let me get NIO 42 puts this morning. Was obvious as hell they were lagging the China sector. Retarded

Deck re-shuffle . New hand

NIO has the retard strength of SPCE in its heyday if you aren’t getting in on this then you must hate money
Well my BABA 300 calls that I bought in August are officially dead. Could have sold them for decent gain 2 weeks ago, but I have now been cucked by the little pee pee Xi. I am going to get drunk and watch Red Dawn tonight

It was meant to be a joke... Maybe it would be better said:  Not only is English my only language, it is my only second language.

Do it, could have the place to yourself.

You can rent a private screening and see if you could bring a PS5 or something.
Must ... buy ... dip ... 

O shit this ones a cliff, fuckkkk
RH cancelled wsb
Remember when you told me to sell NIO yesterday and I did? I love you.
It’s a close the App type of day.
Sucks! You win some you lose some. Still up 90% on the year so I can take the ass blasting.
[deleted]
Airborne Autism is doing its job today i see.
So u think its a rotation from tech to spy.  But then u see spy selling off.  And then you realize its a rotation of money back to europe, no need to invest in overpriced American stocks when there's underpriced recovery plays at home.
Brookdale Senior Living mooned today, calls on old people
oooo NIO support at $40. Should see $45 EOD.

When Biden gets covid we have another chance to buy puts now

Should I trust this bounce?
This has to be trading fraud. I demand a recount of every single trade placed today. 

Republicans were not allowed to observe the trades!!!
finally, i can avg into nio leaps, this will be the next tesla
LET’S HAVE A MARKET RALLY 1 2 3 LETS GO GO GO
NVDA calls for the earnings run up after this nice sell off
Good idea or bad idea to go HEAVY into PTON right now.
I need a BABA gif set to "Baby Come Back," a song by the American rock band Player. It was released in late 1977 as the lead single from their 1977 self-titled debut album, and was the breakthrough single for the band, gaining them mainstream success, hitting number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number ten on the R&B charts in 1978. Their biggest hit single, the song was written and performed by Peter Beckett and J.C. Crowley, the founders of Player.

Two versions of the song exist. The album version ends with a guitar solo fade out, while the single version has a shorter opening and ends with the chorus being repeated on a fade out. 

The BABA gif could be set to the shorter single in order to have a better chance of success with this audience.
We are your only family now! 🦹‍♂️🦹‍♀️🙊

I know what your thinking, is it still too late to train to be a doctor.
NIO climbing out the depths of hell, all the way to heaven.
Ok I warned you though

Go back to your basement Biden!
Pretty much every headline right now is saying the economy is fucked. It’s gonna take one shutdown to really tip over the market here.
It does look pretty interactive to be honest

Did feel kind of like a game

Still in this so I can only get closer to my goal from here

Y’all got anymore of that V shaped recovery?
Beating under the table, eh?
I would if I could trade on RH now
Its called FOMO.
I told some guy yesterday to sell his NIO leaps first thing today. Wait for the momentum to die and earnings to see how they’re positioned, then hop back on. I feel pretty good about it. Hope he got out in time. He had about 5 mins lol
It’s honestly hilarious to watch, glad I dumped those bags
It's climbing back up now. You're good
I know, right? I’m going to miss this guy for that reason. Hope Biden continues the tradition.
Well at least they’re a little longer out so the hit isn’t as brutal as it could be. I’ll admit I didn’t expect NIO to crater as hard and fast as it did but maybe I should have 🤷🏼‍♂️

The second you sold it’s gonna moon 10%.. so can someone take one for the team and sell their BABA calls?
Lol when did u buy these?
Pull back today. I held at $9 and I am going to hold at $13, $12, and $11 or lower if need be.
You boys really do love catching falling knives huh?
How do people look at the massive overextension yesterday during one of the biggest market openings in history and not expect an immediate pullback the next day.

Jesus dude just checked your posts , was that 15k a fucking loan ?? Holy shit I wish I had balls as big as yours can I suck them ?
ngl CRSR got me good with that pump & dump
TSLA just sold $10M worth of tequila. These guys couldn't even sell $5 worth of dildos to the most retarded group of investors of all time.
Honestly, feel like likelihood of spy going green for a second is fairly decent
Can I interest you in some SPY calls?

the selling on pressure on BABA is insane
[deleted]
The only place you can drive a nio is to the middle of the earth.
Omfg BABA -8%?! BABAnkrupcy
How’s ARKK for a buy right now? There will be further rotation into retail but I think the overall trend will be positive for tech for the next 3-6 months.
Yep smart money. Apple could have bought 10% of the S&P companies with their cash on hand but hasn't because they know it's too expensive. They also didn't increase their buybacks because they know their stock is too expensive.
it really is. I already transferred out all my gains but, so tempted to put them back in
I know what if you retards bought NIO at open
What rumor?
BABA Master Race
Is this support? I was fucked last time
Howd it go
Fuck ino
Retards usually don't get what's happening. welcome to the club.
Yeah I was off DKNG for a while but I figured the price was right to move into some 50c 11/20s that may not get ITM but should pop come earnings on Friday.

Today is a rough 'ya wrong, bitch!' outcome for buying calls EOD.
Were all broke buddy
Because in the capital markets, contrary to popular belief, STONKS go both UP and also DOWN. Normal market dynamics my friend
Will Boeing fade the rest of the day because I just bought calls
Finally listened to you 🤡 and bought nio right into the dip
nio it was nice knowing you, now back to proper us boomer stocks like BA!
Which one
The way some of those you tubers relentlessly advertise to kids, I’d say they still got some play in the market of the damned
Damn you got me.

This kangaroo only hops UP hill. The kangaroo has landed and is preparing for his next move- I wouldn't be buying puts right now.
Anybody know the real catalyst for this huge drop everywhere?  Uncertainty due to T challenge or what?
Zoom goin down the pooper
Dude so NIO? Cause I really can't I believe NIO when I nio. So tell NIO is NIO the way? Anyways..NiO you later
Maybe because it was up almost 100% in a month lol
damn, the prophecy fulfills again
NIO volume huge.  Slow melt up once volume calms down?
It’s trueee
but muh bond movies
Bruh, that was because I sold my puts lol. Google had retard strength and I said fuck it.
nio has no support. fake meme jina stonk.
SPY Green incoming
Looks like the NIO rumor might actually be true...
I think the correct title would be

It's amazing how I can consistently buy the top.

INTC is the shelter you need in these volatile times
I am really regretting those NIO $36 and $38 puts that I wrote earlier today. Guess I can baghold at those prices if I get assigned. JFC
[removed]
Its doing the uppity up thing whaaaa
Boeing drops 4 dollars and my puts are up like 10% can’t win with this stock man..
Earnings play for today?
why's CRSR down? bad guidance?
Yeah, people/algos are off loading anything that has a profit and moving into stocks that were undervalued. 

T has gone up like 8% over the last two days. Is their debt no longer a problem? Does the Vax make people watch more HBO Max?
China thanks you for funding Tesla's competitor.  Capitalists will sell you the rope used to hang them.
Tried to place an order, but good ol’ RH said that ain’t happening. Guess I’ll take the day off.

Macro.....risk is on the table bro....covid is surging and pfe vaccine isn’t confirmed fully yet plus it won’t be used at minimum till end of year fam. Means we still going to have to shut down in nov ASAP to open for Christmas

Told my dad to buy. This pump is very real
I understand, but is their stuff good enough to make a difference and have a loyal base etc? Have you seen how many brands sell PC peripherals?
Great to see tech take a beating. Overvalued POS
Trump and Elon tweets control the market confirmed
Fuck man gl lol
or when the risk reward is not anymore attractive enough. I guess risk reward changes when price changes
!remind me 1 day
Ok
Feeling bad for this guy after today’s correction. 😢
Bought GOOG calls and it instantly fell off a cliff
Game theory if there is value in it and they can then they are and we’re manipulating their markets too
Stock up 75% in 1 month - "Organic growth 😎"

Stocks down 25% in 48 hours - "Oh my God fuck those cuck MM's 😤"
As much as the GUH's and the losses hurt, I absolutely love this.
I don't know shit...but hear me out....all we've heard is tech is overvalued for i don't know how long. Could it be that the vaccine news pumped everything outside of tech making people afraid that everything is overvalued now. 

S&P, Dow, Russell nasdaq all at or just about ATH is a recipe for fear imo. But my option isn't worth shit.
Someone on wallstreet ask your boss why they dumped
Nio about to sell off 11% and then finish the day up 6%

Bought 16.5k worth of BYND $140 puts when I heard about McPlant. Was taking the browns to the pool when atom notified me BYND skyrocketed. Immediately lost $10k. Doubled down with 25k of same put when I realized earnings were going to be released. BYND=DASANI is the logic used for the DD. I sold immediately this morning.
You don’t have to, I just did. You don’t want to buy it be my guest lol.
F to anyone that bought NIO calls this morning
I will suck your nuts up through your dick if you’re right.

Posting about NIO to piss off the people who get pissed off when they see NIO.

Wow those tech dips were bought up
It hasn’t closed under 200 since 6/29. Have made a killing on selling 195 puts 3x since July. If it does, it’s either feast or famine.
I will (maybe) buy back in sub $16. CCL is too fuckin risky. That’s why I stopped playing them in April.
Holy shit OPK is up bigly.
Rotation out of tech into dow. Buying exhaustion. Buy the dip... time and time again has proven to work

Too many people are expecting SPY at 400 by January and are max leveraged long. Thats why we dump.

STAY DOWN TSLA!
wait patiently for your kinda trade and bet an amount that you can confidently hold while thinking what proves your trade thesis wrong and exit the moment your proven wrong.
no way. just a sell off after the massive pump from last week
I knew I should have sold nio yesterday
Most likely, as I’m holding calls for aapl.
Why is NIO down
Thanks for the crash Sleepy
Rest in Peace, fam. I soon will follow you
Exited my RKT position 🚀 That means ER should moon. Thank me later boys
People don’t talk about this enough lol. Every time he tweets about the market it crashes the next day or a few days later

Very likely we are rangebound for the next few days but I still think we drop another 5-7%...all my puts expire 2 weeks out so I’m just gonna chill. Good luck boys.
NIO will end green book it
Are we stabilizing ?
yes. pos software

How’s NIO for you guys today?

WHAT IS CAUSING THIS SELL OFF
Nikola is having a better day than NIO that tells you everything you need to kNIOw
Here’s your opportunity to buy a fat dip.
The person that made those graphs should be hanged.
Biden crashed the market
It was before it went up 30% in two days
If you panic sold nio then leave this sub
g@y

ban
Everything is drilling, how is dow 29k? What is propping dow up
The vaccine was the worst thing to happen to the market, I refuse to believe otherwise
I'm just yoloing NIO. Whatever man.
Always have been
Working fine for me
this is fake news, the market cheated.... im going to challenge the results of the calls i bought this morning
Buying AMD at the dip
Why does cash gang even keep money in the market
Nasdaq green eod
Go
Unless this is the beginning of the end.
if you have long calls, just dont look. go do something else that's not market related. trust me. im a retard.
Thank you both
defense stocks are roaring... are people really thinking a war is coming?
Everyone’s taking profits today. Absolute massacre. The rally after will be insane though 🚀
Buy NIO dip
To be fair much of that shit is still way overvalued and the market will dump it back to a marginal price gain before the years end. Travel is a long and painful recovery, and industries don’t expect full recovery until 2022 or 2023 even with a vaccine.

Expedia is at its highest price since 2019. 

Great opportunity to sell short or buy puts.
GME fuck you i hate you fuck you
Thanks a lot
Can someone explain to me why you like NIO? Their financials are terrible
Nio is still a good buy, it was simply way too fucking overbought. The volume on it was always crazy
Nio puts printing 💴
Buy the DKNG dip
Buy the AMDip
Yep, RH wouldn't update any of my cannabis options nor let me sell them
i think it was NVDA and NIO that murdered someone
[deleted]
Welp bought a baba call with the last $200 I have
Yes, Vanguard was a joke
$ARRY hello, we meet again.
Same I bought at the  very top
Thank you.
NIO did me dirty with that 42.20 dead cat tbh
It’s possible. No matter how much people harp about it being over, betting places still have him at 12%. If somehow it gets to the Supreme Court it could be chaos
Holding shares of both Nio and pltr so not worried long term but seeing that I lost $7000 today so far sucks.
fake tech pump
NIO has a long way to go down.
my boomer father in law warned me about them...i should have listened
No you should be averaging down right now.
Vaccine crashed the market loool
That's the secret, play both sides smartly and dont go chasing waterfalls/dildos if its already moved by 2-3%. The options are probably 80% set in price at that point and there's not much margin to profit from there.  

I'm up 190% from just the past two days heh
B
Yum brands.
You’re right. Hope you got all the puts and it’s made you rich.
whenever WSB says buy, you know it’s a good time to poot
cash out 😎
Ok but what's the actual reason it's dumping:

1) donnie's tweets

2) market forgetting about boiden and soiling panties realizing covid still exists

3) softdickbank part 2

4) 2020 grand finale rug pull ™
[deleted]
I been buying since $6. Aint the first -10% day just more idiots who bought at the high bitching than ever. It’ll bounce just buy the dip and stop being a pussy
The one time I don't sell on a spike aaaand it's gone.  Epic!
.... Is AAPL gonna drag this market down even more after the event.

Poor SQ may need a direct injection of the covid if so.
I guess, but seems X-treme to me when it could still go wrong
Remember, in two hours Tim Apple is gonna come on stage and say: "*One more thing..* 🖕 *your calls.*"
BEAR trap set. Stove pipe anuses by EOD.
Suits are gonna have to shake a little harder than -10% I ain’t fucking selling. 🖕🏻
Those'll print
Market rotation:(
I dunno about 50 but it's feeling a little oversold. Bought some 12/18 40C when it hit 39.
Do we still have faith in RKT
90 minutes in and ROBBINHANDS still not loading. These fucks have been active on twitter the past few minutes yet NO UPDATE, NO ReSPONSE. And their system status only showing "working" fucking scam ass platform
Fuck today
Yeah think you’re right
PK always gains. I have watched it since it dipped into the 9's, I started a long position at 9.30 with PK. SVC is another REIT, but caters to truck stops. Even with the eventual switch off of fuel still a money maker with land it owns.
I remember when they said that everyday back in March

F
I agree and I also hold leaps
🐻🌈

It's our turn to post eod gains
I bought in today at $41 lololol I just got WSB’d
Tech stocks shit the bed, but Intel is green somehow. I've never laughed so hard
This is exactly what happened at the end of August early September. Prices are even the same almost
save us softbank, load up on more calls!
I’m buying every time it drops
I announce new nio price target at 5 $
Spy, why have you forsaken me?
Atleast pull out your initial investment so you don’t cry when it drops to 0
I was shocked yesterday morning. The election thing seemed kind of important
Is nio done selling off now or should I continue to shit my pants?
why didnt u warn us
No fking clue
why does this happen im so confused
CRSR is retarded
Pot stock bubble 2 electric boogaloo about to pop
APT Calls?
Robinhood acting stupid af
Cash gang
When I actually get the vaccine all I will be thinking about is how much money it lost me PTSD. 😭😭😭
Which one of you cucks said PLTR was a buy
all in NIO shares
V shaped recovery by lunch time right fellas?? 😅
Puts on this guy
I thought I liked it rough but I wish we made a safe word at this point.
Nio volume going up
True. Tell me something I don’t know.
I’m crying
Are the Trump legal challenges spooking markets? What the heck is this drill
JFC the one hour I actually go do some work at work I come back and the market dies.  WTF happened?
Me too, holding
\-10% with nio babyyyyy
Honestly, i think that vaccine news overcooked the market really hard yesterday
tech stock today: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox-lfowevqA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox-lfowevqA)
I am down 15% in 2 days 😭
I declare BANKRUPTCY!!
This is what we get for trusting China how could they do this to us! Everyone grab your pitchforks
Don't worry boys, I am gonna buy some $10 headphone on Single's Day and save $BABA.
⚠️ NIO certified as a pump and dump scheme ⚠️
asking myself the same question. this is why smart money doesnt leave the trading to monkey brains and has algorithms doing all the work
Does your wife love her boyfriend? Or is it more of a FWB situation?
I’m so thankful for this dip. I’m 100% long, but in it for the long haul. I love buying at discounted prices and realizing some gains in covered calls.
The market as a whole shit the bed due to vaccine news. My DD said big earnings beat and they did, along with enough backlogged orders to crush next quarter by even further.
Be more careful by buying puts. Shit is obviously a scam
Netflix is a penny stock now 🤣🔫
Haven’t been clapped yet. But getting close to being assigned on my 37p
Looks like my nio shorts are going to make it
All in!
Sell naked puts on companies you want to buy
Robinhoos is glitched and wont load my shit. Fantastico
I think casino puts still have juice in the tank
Today I’m trying something where I make my decision on what I want to do, then I do the opposite. Still red.
I hope your right! I’m very scared rn
Same
JMIA puts
I’m so fucking happy NIO is down, only because the people shilling the stock can shut the fuck up about it, and say this as someone who has LEAPs
Come on bounce you fucking 🤡 market
[deleted]
NIO short squeeze on the menu
[deleted]
up?
Baba imo
you're wanting to learn about "price to earnings ratio"


.... which is very basic stuff, don't play around if you're that uninformed (or else you'll end up like the other people here, broke and sexually compromised)
I know it burns
i dont know why... but i believe you
Lol if y dare to keep it though earning
Puts or hang out, we ain't done crashing yet.
NIO is being moody cuz I called it a bitch last night
I am so fuckin bullish right now. Spy 420 eoy
There s no dip. Only abyss.  Every day 10 % drill🤨
Yup
Get a finance degree and quit asking this sub.

More answers - less questions
You have no idea what China will do to it
Hard to say really. My hope is that we are pulling back and will climb higher again after the event. My calls are bleeding rn
SHOP LEAPS 1000C
macro'd...just a bad day to have earnings. thats about it. NExt week it will prob be 29 when we rotate back into tech.
Dig a hole.
Lock in profits on those puts. Tesla trades between $400-$450. We are at the bottom.
this aged like fine wine.
Realty income corporation 
Bp* British petroleum 
ATT
Citibank
Grats and fuck you
NIO massacre the day after i buy in
Red panties smell better than green panties
Reasonable Palantir prices rn I guess? Perhaps cop that for earnings and gamble
Am poor so just the one
Market is down bring up Covid, Market is up bring up Vaccine news. Nice moves!
'Sector rotation out of tech'. Gee where have I seen this before?
If I held my amd puts from yesterday I wouldve made 5k...im a fucking 🤡
Take this crap humour to the r/teenagers sub, nothing wrong with a market joke but that comment ain’t really gonna fly in here.
This is literally the most insane week I’ve ever personally experienced in the market. None of this makes any fucking sense but everything will go back up for the most part don’t panic. Today is a fire sale, make it an opportunity not a loss
INTC Green. You can tell its a boomer move. based on nothing. I bought AMD.
it is a pullback
AMZN april calls. Down 25K

Lets pray brother
Iv been bleeding out averaging down on my calls...
What are good buys on this dip?
If I remember correctly, the cousin alleged that he didn't just hit on her, he told her to take off her shirt and he started massaging her bare back. It's some straight up porn shit. At their grandfather's funeral.
lol NIO clapping this entire sub
Don't buy calls....keep printing..when did u buy....I bgt yesterday...fuck dint move much
Alright, AMD did not deserve this. Up we go
Investors have diamond hands. They're not looking at daily performance.
It belongs there lol
nio 50 by end of week for sure, beautiful 14% pullback and great time to get in
So glad i took my gains yesterday and bought NIO calls not
Spy about to get that V recovery
Donnie dump baybee
Show me. Edit: I'm not saying your claims are propaganda, although I'm like 90% sure they are. It's the front page of the site you cited that is full of propaganda.
Did NVDA murder someone and get sentenced to death or something?
Everything up but AAl lmao
Jackpot Joe's Casino. House always wins.
It was a matter of time. I’m glad you making some money off it, bro. I was in the same boat
Look at what happens every single time Tesla drops. I know it's not a guarantee but if I were in your shoes I would switch
Bruh first time I buy into it too 😭
Got 43k on the sideline, what do?

Holy fuck my calls lol
Le arbitrage
That damn Trump tweet yesterday about ATH... he always calls the top.
NNNOOOOO TSLA GO BAK TO 396!
Yes
Nah man. I know people who work here. It's about as undervalued as it gets now. Just holding long.
Pfizer fell off a cliff
I'm getting greedy.  Better sell
[deleted]
NIO welp 😢
Aight copped PLTR, time for TSLA calls for when it inevitably goes back to 420
🤡🤡🤡
DKNG WTF
Wrong song dumbass bot
Perfect day for me would be SPY to 360 and RKT beats earnings and gives good guidance
Yeah or NIO
You would be a rich motherfucker if you just placed all the contrarian trades to my trades
Contested election
FSR FSR FSR
It smell like bitch in here. 

🌈🐻
Doesn’t help that all those banks have been pumping the fuck out of it
Why not just tqqq
Once again, I dipped into the guac too early. Should have saved some cash for today
yeah the time to buy was yesterday or at open. Everything is down so much at this point you’d have to be lucky to make profit on some puts
the FOMO is real when smart money's got algos trading on steroids ripping the rug from right under our feet
[deleted]
So BYND sells off yesterday and MCD sells off today?
Time for some calls boys
yeah it’s not like it’s real money

This one brightened my day. Thank you good sir
I just sold all my shares to wait for a bit of stability, lost 15% of my portfolio in this one hour, it was going to happen
Likely

Just bought 100 share
NIOOOOOOOOOOOconnect

NIO has a Gap at $30 that needs to be filled. Once structure is fixed it will rocket to ATH
facebook ad just reccomended me a rug... idk men if this isnt a sign nothing is. 

Solidest DD right here.
I think u have this confused with CRISPR  or whatever the fuck its called

common error 

CRSR is a gaming stock they make keyboards and mice
I suppose its only normal we have a retraction after breaking ATH
how?
Dragged down together with the market.
Yeah next month but many thought based on console release we'd see some increase even if just for today
SNAP puts printing FINALLY

lol. bye bye 10k.

just lost all my acb gains and more, back to where i started last week

clown lifeee
Ok, they wiped out all the stops on NIO and can snag all the shares again.  Stop driving it down and let the market work now.
Sold my NIO calls at the top and bought the dip now I can't day trade them. Fuck my life.
Yea i lost it all too. Beat revs by 40% with another $75M in backlogged orders... if the market didn’t have vaccine news come out this week triggering a wide selloff then the stock would be up nicely
NIO boys be like PLUG ME BACK IN
No ...
Buy the dip bitches
If my 200 18.5 NIO puts go up in value today I will coom
Is that fun?
Question is. What happens tomorrow
NIO gonna be a buy once it settles.
Zoom gonna drill to the middle of the earth
[deleted]
Fuck SoftBank bunch of cunts
Is dec long?
Damnit I should have dumped TDOC when I had the chance.
Am I gonna get assigned on my NIO 37p, holy shit it’s tanking
Very happy I moved most of my money into BABA and JD before the election. Feeling very, very good right now.
🙏
BABA leaps make sense here.  Could also go for FDs and hope for crazy #s after singles day.

You’re probably the smartest person here. I’d suggest not even looking.
U mean keep going in reverse ...then yes
No
Down 5K, all dated December and beyond. No fear
APPL do you think will go down again after the event, even this time as well?
I’m pretty bad at this game
Alright, what spooked the market?
But no sex with men...

Unless you 🐻🏳️‍🌈
This NIO dump is elite, not a buyer in sight
Hahahah. Long on SQQQ. You have a floor. I have the moon.
NIO you better have a comeback
Buying opportunity. So much has been dumped over the vaccine news. As if Covid is done for. 

I mean all these tech stocks were valued on future values—- did the market really price in a near permanent Covid?  

Streaming, Video games, social media, devices enterprise software, home workouts, all that shit is going NOWHERE.  The outlook post Covid is actually better because more new customers were acquired.
[deleted]
FB always crashes after big gains
yeah, like what the fuck lmao
Well guys. Trump did it again. He tweeted stocks ath and tanked the market.
It was up... now it’s down hahahahaha
Um. NIO. You blew past correction territory. Turn away from the light.
Ah, NIO. I knew u could do it. Good, Doggy.
-67% all time but we aren’t gonna talk about that
NIO put holders be like rn
no way nio drops 14%?
Who is this fucking amateur? 

We've bought all the stonks we could when they were green. We're reaping the rewards now.
Feel like I’m too late for puts but not buying any dips, guess I’ll just sit here fml
[deleted]
Hey Timmy 🍎🍆🍎
Because some people were just playing it short while they were mooning. Stoll not a bad long play imo
Alexa play I prevail - gasoline
NIO buddies we ok?
I blame Hoe Budden for this...
[deleted]
Shit day for buyers yo - I don't like any of these dips
NIO retards should be gone now at least
Is there an obvious reason for nio to go down?
Today is fucking me so hard it hurts
SOFTBANK STRIKES AGAIN
loading up on NIO after this dip
I’m already up
I wonder if the vaccine expectation was pretty big for the market stability. Now it's come and gone and the fundamentals aren't as pretty as expected. 

This along with fundamentals play shitting on tech can seriously pull the rug a bit on the market. I can see a downturn coming even if it's not expected now. I'm vary.
Can’t believe the vxx is barely above 20 with what’s going on this week

Rest of market killing it. I hold
Options is like drug dealing, you think too big you might get clapped
spy should well here
Just bought at $41 and it drops to $39 feels good
Spy puts
pass him the mercy vaseline
The drop is as insane as the rally. V shaped recovery incoming.
Want to load up on NIO calls, but still scared from the last time a bear touched me. So I'll go with call debit spreads.
nio puts printing

Puts on NIO were a good idea. Fuck china
Bought puts! Spy and apple about to go green
The cages joe. Who built the cages joe
NVIDIA AM I RIGHT
RKT don't fail me now

NIOuch
Nio gang.  Where you at.  100 eom
Im ruined
And that gentleman, is what a parabolic move upward eventually does - go down just as fast
Can Tesla go back up please?
Only silver lining. Snap is finally dying too.
I like how even Pfizer is down
F is one of the few things in my account that’s green lol
Bro sell.
Just bought WMT January calls. Gonna try my best to not look and hold on tight

They keep hurting me but I always come back for more :(
oh please that sector probably should see uptrend from vaccine news, but these are bank stocks you're talking about. some were up bigly yesterday, ofc they will cool off today. others like WFC are just always shit. banking sector isn't going to do amazing under biden or trump anyway. probably worse under biden.
I don't understand CRSR

Please enlighten me

I can see its low market cap, IPO'd recently. I know the brand, they release good stuff ok.

PC components market is oversaturated though, is it really worth investing in them? Its only 2b market cap which is tempting, but I am not sure if they will be worth buying options a year out on.

Please show me the goods
[deleted]
Shit ...Tesla dint move much when I held puts yesterday
I’ve got $11c 12/18. I’m still fine
The same black line that was drawn on you, was drawn on me. And now it’s drawn me in
How much are you up now?
So many obvious NIO pumpers have been spamming the discussion threads for a week or so now.

You guys really gotta be more careful of that shit.
NVDA $600 to $500 in 24hrs, wtf, buy the dip.
Tesla giving me anxiety. My puts are printing  SO hard. Everything in my being is telling me to switch to calls but it just keeps dropping. Any insight?
[removed]
[deleted]
nah no way nio dips 13% today
Lmao still up 60%
Alright *now* this is bad
[deleted]
Play dead, dont touch anything. This is how you survive a bear attack.
Fuck you CGC piece of shit go down. Your weed is trash anyways
I don't even want to check my portfolio based on the comments from this thread
anyone buying nio calls end of day or think it will dump more?
Alright kids, how you doing? How you feeling? Everything going well? Enjoy !
Despite shit tanking, SPY hasnt dropped much. SPY 400 is coming
[removed]
I know it’s a bit rough today.  

 so if you need a good belly laugh go read the bulls on parade from last Sunday PM.  🌈
a pullback
Yea but my portfolio is this 30% US lmao
Damn it! I love this sub 

Now do me a favor and use that money and buy back in. I’ll sell here in a little so it’ll moon guaranteed
[deleted]
Christ NIO
Analysts have this at 46+ and you expect people to listen to some scared retard from reddit?

Nah get fucked
My NIO trailing stop triggered. It's over, boys 😭
Story time. Was loaded with calls AM. 7:30am, I get a sharp stabbing pain in my back. 7:45am, I’m in the fetal position. 8am, I’m in the ER. 8:10am, immediate morphine drip and told I have a kidney stone. 8:30am (market open-I’m central time), morphine on full blast, unload all calls, switch to SPY puts. Moral of the story.... trade on morphine.
🤣
ohhhhh man
Lol lucky you missed out... general selloff has them down 15%
😭
I always got the idea that Sunny Balwani groomed Elizabeth Holmes to defraud people he met her while she was still in highschool and he was still married, although supposedly she was at least 18 when he did they lied about a lot tho so who knows how old she really was.

I love watching DKNG bleed my portfolio, it's so fun!! Yay!
Trump tanking ?? donnie pump is no more
+167% rn

I’m gonna find a way to fuck this up though rest assured
Idk, but I do know if Donnie applies for a job at the Wendy's, then doesn't get it, he's going to burn that mother down.
I’m 150% on NIO puts maybe I’m not retarded after all... not selling
we're sure NIO isn't a penny stock, right? ......right?
There isn’t a rotation right now, that’s what yesterday looked like. This seems like wonkiness from options trading again.
NIO giveth and NIO taketh away
Nio dip I’ve been waiting for, loading up on 40C
The only thing thats actually green is GM
What's O, B, T ,C ??
A stranger cries, screams out loud
stonks are just the biggest game of hot potato ever.
Trump called it guys, he tweeted yesterday that we are at ATH because of him. That dude can really call the top.
My GameStop calls I dropped $2k on are worth... $5 lol
Hopefully this is the bottom 😭
Please bring flowers to my grave once a year.
FUCK YOU BEARS

MY CALLS WILL RISE AGAIN
Imagine when they write the history books about the tech COVID bubble and have to write how it was popped by the mother fucking vaccine
Bought yesterday at close, fuck me
congrats but fuck you,im getting my ass kicked right now
gap filled 

can we go up now?
Fun fact: nasdaq is down almost 1000 points since sunday fucking night
It isn't even bouncing. Lol.
Crsr R.I.P. 😡😢
Europe still holding, though. This sell-off is US only.
Those NIO puts are the only warm spot on my portfolio right now. Thank you.
Y'all see red stocks, I see discounted stocks

Stonk only go up. Stonk only go up. Stonk only
Sirens ring, the shots ring out
RKT gang, hold after earnings?.I feel it s dead 😣
Easiest buy ever man
Massive shit every stock is taking

Great vid. A time in life...that has passed.
Dollar was just to low man.....they had to pull offf
I think this is the single funniest post I've ever seen on this sub


it won't get that many votes though, much too clever for these people
I mean it went to like 326 after hitting 350 lol
👊🏻

Edit: I'm glad I listened to myself too lol. Wish I held my 220 msft puts a little longer though than open.
I feel you
Why not?
why is NIO dying? glad I closed position yesterday
Yes. Until stimulus is agreed upon we are in for a lot of red and sideways trading. Boomer stocks will fall once investors realize how far away we are from deploying the vaccine.
Wow my nio puts are finally back to break even 💖
poor paypal
Be GreEdY whEn OthErs aRe FeaRFuL

That shit has me down another 20%. I should have been a scared ass lil bitch. At least I’d have some money.
Honestly...I still have this stupid feeling it might lol.
We? I am short on qqq ;)
The fuck? I know all tech is down, but $AMZN, $SHOP, $BABA and $MELI? 

The OG Amazon, the Maple-syrup Amazon, the Chinese knock-off and the Amazon of the Amazon?? Are investors really pivoting into banks because people are going to start borrowing... to shop at fucking Macy’s now?
Alright bitch stfu and get outta here
Debating cutting losses on my Feb NIO calls and buying back in a lower price. This is a bloodbath
Lol exaggerate much?  Testing 200?  Not even down 10% but calling for 20%?  Chill man this shit happens. I have 1/15/21 270$ calls that are way down now but not even worried about it. This shit will be back over 300 way before it test 200
The volume on that sell off was pretty loose butthole. Watch AAPL start the next leg down with an event 🤣🤣🤣
Crash so we can get this over with
The only bill that’s due is the one for the backdoor pounding I gave your mother.
I wonder why, did news come out?
Remember bulls, during a crash the real damage is done during the rallies
Sell PayPal?
well isn’t this super fun
-20% today
Are u guys just tech stocks? 😂
Yeah, think I’m going to sit out today and reevaluate tomorrow morning.
SPCE puts printing rn
Nah I’ll wait
Solid DD. Old money big. Life savings on Royal.
LITERALLY the day I go into NIO it crashes to oblivion. I will have 200 shares @ 39 on friday.

EDIT: Oh and I got 2 48 calls, down 90%.
How far is nio gonna drop?

Starting a business is basically gambling as well given the failure rates.  Finish that degree and jet a job, you’ll be out of debt in no time with income left over to gamble, fund your business, whatever.  The hole you’re in is about an inch deep.

I think I’m holding RKT through earnings
Nah they livelife
Alexa play how low by ludacris
I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO KEEP AVERAGING DOWN
Well, this is what you get when you buy into a stupidly pumped stock like NIO. Senseless monkeys, NIO tO 50 eOw! 😏😏😏
Robinhood with the dimond hands feature today 🤡
Is it even worth buying puts? This kangaroo market is so fucked. I’m sure the majority of us have been getting boned since September.
Lol
Closing that level of call position quickly is not easy.
Nio bois in shambles
No they were good MMs just feel like cucking option players
This is why we buy leaps
NIO in free fall 🤡
This is panic rotation out of every stock that had made money over the last 6 months into those that were lagging.
The downside catalysts in BABA’s case are likely to fade. Regulation is very risky, but usually they fail to have teeth beyond soothing political egos.
naw bra load it up
Should I sell ZM 315’s expiring this Friday? Bought them yesterday at open and well they are up.
Fuck this shit
Don’t think I’ve ever lost this much money with a red vix

Nah, time to load up on calls
I’m wanting bulls to answer that question for themselves :)
It’s called fraud when you are a publicly traded company
Gonna make a lot of money when it goes back up if you don’t paper hand them
gonna be homeless from NIO
You suck, also congrats
Yeah, I'm going to sell my calls sometime between now and the end of the year. Likely will buy puts after NYE.
Yes
Lost over 25k since The Sept drop 🤡,almost out of funds, confidence in any picks was snatched away
Lol who fomod into nio get fucked
Somebody call bro make sure he’s good
I just made money on NIO puts, ask me anything

Now you sit back and enjoy the magic show of money disappearing 😢
Yes nio yes, get cheaper so I can reenter on top of my May 40C calls
Can confirm
Made money on 11/13 UBER 49c, first time buying calls. Got lucky as shit when it hit 49.36 earlier.
Sell the news on MAX approval in a week or so...
Boys notice how this is not a pump like the previous b.s "vaccines" were....BTFD is all I'm saying. Totally normal sell off.
Are you all out of your wife's boyfriend's money? No more to buy meme stocks with?

nah, AMD is priced to be the heavy weight in CPUs and GPUs. anything bad for AMD isn't priced in.
This isn't a tech rotation. This a boomer rotation. Weed and EVs also killed

Bought the dip twice on NIO this morning
This is absolutely disgusting.
still laughing!
So CRSR crushes earnings and then tanks...
TSLA puts at open hit me with three bagger.
Jan 15 200c
I can’t really offer much advise in that realm. What I can tell you is to be careful if you’re buying calls on companies that have already seen massive growth. Look at past earnings trends etc. if a company that has hardly moved the past 3 months beats expected earnings, it will move most of the time unless there are other external factors. It’s all about surprise and perceived value. You aren’t really trading on a company’s value, you’re trading on how other people value it (TSLA is unprofitable and *extremely* overvalued, but people are trading it based on future growth etc)
Dan Gilbert you must take us to $23 upon tonight’s earnings

Edit: RKT $25c 11/20
I’m buying hundreds of shares on this dip to hold over the next couple years. This is a $500+ stock easy
Why are we crashing? Are u fucking joking? 😂 wow
Just incase anyone wants to feel better about themselves, I still have SPY puts I bought on Oct. 30 at 3 pm. The actual bottom of this bull run.
[removed]
17.08
violent reversal in CRSR which was green earlier. 

was a certain racial slur used on the earnings call?
What's going on everything is red but dow is green
How can $ADBE be down if Adobe photoshop makes up 99% of $NKLA’s 18billion market cap?
Word. 46 minimum.
Too late to buy puts? 🦘
MSFT touches 200 ignore everything and buy I swear. Don’t think about any other play I’m doing you a favor. It’s probably the most undervalued big boy.
Buy NIO $44 calls now while they're on discount
Aight, starting to cop some PLTR
China wants to have its own Silicon Valley, will be a bad look to prospective talents and investors if a giant like BABA falls.
Can you explain?
KO, O, AXP, STOR, SU, BP, BAC, RDS.B, T, C, PSX
Can't panic sell if you want tendies
Stupid GME doing a reverse squeeze
Why didn’t I sell everything yesterday ???!!!!
We all knew a NIO correction was coming and here it is. Don’t buy weeklies if you wanna be safe. 11/27 or more
Memefolio is my  new favorite word. And yeah, we r fuk
Nah, it's still above support levels
its a good vaccine/stimy play. Any time good news is coming with in 2 weeks buy some longs.
Anyone thinking we start buying NVDA into earnings?  We are approaching the 500 level where it has received support.  We chip away it today or should we wait until tomorrow?

Earnings on the 18th.
true, very true
pro tip robinhood still lets you buy AMD calls even when it's down (not even joking)

“Biden unveils China trade proposal” would be an amazing headline right about now

lmao, two stocks that typically have no IV and I can make some beer money off of are going to get called away on Friday. FFS, PFE & ABBV.
Absolutely unequivocally the time to buy

Imo of course
Ok i did.  Now what?
Oh look we're almost back to Friday's close on SPY before the vaccine pump and dump
Hmm might sell off some of my PSTH gains to buy this dip
[deleted]
Avocados still green ;)
Went up like 7 grand just a few days ago, couldn't get out due to PDT and now I'm getting my guts torn out.

2020 markets are fun 🤡
I did the same yesterday. Sold at 6.4 they closed at 12.
I will on the next dead cat bounce 👍🏻
Maybe by diversifying your portfolio they didn’t mean throwing all money in a single sector. Who woulda thought? 😭
[deleted]
This is quite extreme
Well we filled the gap
No one hates money more than RKT.
Nio dead
[deleted]
A lot of people are now, some are waiting till after earnings.
FUCK CHINA
Should have waited for it dip after that really at least. I got calls at $42 lol
I’m out of the market 

I love this
Thanks for booking limit down services -we hope you are enjoying your ride
Don’t see to many here that actually plan things out like that. You will probably get downvoted and people will make fun of your MaGiC LiNeS but this is a good post. Good luck 👍
NIO is going to rebound by EOD and all of you will be salty for selling. Quality stonks only go up. Look at this comment EOD, +5% day incoming.
damn that sucks NVDA. Good luck tho

thank god i didn’t buy those nio calls
Told you all. WBA to the moon!
+275 to -12 in 8mins lmao i quit
Fuck my fucking life
If you start buying puts now you are gonna get fucked
LOL, now Dow is being sold off

🌈🐻s out in full force
Thanks. You did me a solid. Massive sell off
man I'm with you except my losses are few times greater. I thought BABA was a sure thing but this macro shift is fucking everything up.
So the investigative reporter that destroyed Theranos has a book called Bad Blood that is a fantastic read. That company was such an incredible shitshow its amazing they were able to fool anyone at all. The Edison never worked so they had to take the blood samples and water them down with saline to run them through a Siemens machine which of course totally fucked up the results. Everyone that came in and had tests done with the Edison would come back with terminally bad numbers and diseases they didn't actually have.
Same... annoying af
For reference, after Trump was elected in 2016 the initial pump lasted about 6 weeks straight.
this is increasingly looking like a market that THINKS a tech bubble is going to pop. 

eventually it will find support and rebound violently
Well he got in a long time ago. Me...not so much haha

NIO floor engaged. Up we go
Triple tops a bitch 🤷‍♀️
Please **STOP** I want to buy the calls not sell them
just buy the dip
SPY and QQQ puts are still coming in in large volumes....
lmao i sold when it was 265, got back in at 270 and am riding back down lol
Getting LKNCY x NKLA vibes
I don’t think it’s because of the dip, but it’s jumped up nearly $50 in two days. Correction likely, what news has made them be valued at pre corona levels?
I thought that at 42.20 lol
Our shit is so fuckedddd
Wow that CRSR dump
CCL straddle bought yesterday eod worked 👌🏼
wow PLTR..
You ever get that shitty feeling when you sell your puts on the pump locking profits but then buy into BABA calls thinking it's a big brain move? Could've been up thousands, now I'm  down 800 lol I belong here forever

And there goes my trailers. WTF did I wake up to
fuck robinhood
Damn bought baba shares at the 3rd dip thinking I won the game. I was wrong
WHERE IS THE REVERSAL????
I feel personally attacked
Yes
AMD calls right now for ez gains
I was laughed at for buying puts on TSLA yesterday 🤬🤬

Don’t worry. I only made $1k cuz I paper handed them right at open. Had I held on I would have made $5.3k 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
And GM can draw concept calls all day so i don’t think this deal is going anywhere but the dumpster.
The thing of being a bear is that you win 1/100 of the times but it feels 1000x better

its like the only stocks these guys watch are NVDA and MSFT. 

HD, MCD, DG are all stable. 

CVS is even up. 

And some tech stocks like FISV are VERY up (yesterday), just down from being so high.

/u/PM_YOUR_PEPERONI youre retarded
Stay strong brothers
Considering you probably live in section 8 if we listened to you we would probably never buy anything nice.
Bear trap!
OH NO NIO HASNT BEEN THIS LOW SINCE... since yesterday
Use a tampon then
Nope. SPY isn't even -1% yet. Meanwhile my portfolio is -7%
So MSFT is now only 13% above it’s pre-COVID high 

Really trying to double/triple down on my January calls, but can’t help but feel that this might drop the rest of the week
[deleted]
copied from previous comment (all eu btw):

santander bank (shares) +24%

rds.b (shares) +9.55%

ing €6 june 2022 (options) +108%

ing €8 dec 2021 (options) +4%

rds.a €14 dec 2022 (options) +49%
That’s not a bull case though. I could easily say ACB has traded north of $100. That means nothing
Predefined your risk!
So double negative,  meaning you're 5% up a man today
“I am a man of fortune, and I am losing my fortune.”
Worst day ever for me. Fuck.
Yes :(
Lol 1400 in debt. For one that’s nothing to this sub. I myself am a holder of almost 30gs. I’ve got no job, just helped my disabled mom get her own place, and a baby on the way. 1400 is nothing. 15k can easily be regained. Go be a car salesman or something. You’ll bounce back. Ps I also don’t have my degree and I’ve owned two businesses and almost a third one but I got into a car crash so that stunted me going for my third .Get a tent and live rent free for a few months. It’ll be like nothing ever happened
It appears the market has bi-polar disorder.
😭😭
Remember, republicans allowed this to happen.
If baba doesn’t rally I’m going to pick out some rope

Deadass srs
I should have bought qqq puts instead of spy puts.

Sell puts, same number of contracts and expiration, one strike lower to “lock in” gains
I just had my first 20% day for my account in months. Couple more of these and I’ll be back to what I have invested.
This run up gonna last another 5-7 days...  don't focus on the last 5-7 minutes.
Why did I sell my 345 p at open
You and me both. FZROX looking better and better
I'm only risking a grand since it's a naked call and not capable of creating a spread right now, so that the max risk I willing to take in case it Gap down tomorrow
As far intra day 50% by then it clear she broke support and is in a new downtrend
It's priced in
Could go up though
Yeah I bought 20 shares of baba last Friday. Sold them today at a loss. Am I doing this right?
Yup the BYND ceo mentioned this on their earnings call. He basically said it was McDonalds news to spill and he couldn’t give anything way. It may be that they are helping them produce and still branding it as McDonalds - but BYND makes contract money
Nice, I'm so proud of you. Try not to get butthurt next time someone makes a joke.
Call them... oh wait
Yes, yes you do, you are barely starting but welcome
fucking banks are tech stocks now?

Holy shit CRSR dropping like a bucket of shit
umm hello Nio? 😑
I'm so fucking lame. I wanted to buy spy puts at open yesterday but didnt pull the trigger. Then this morning i randomly decide to buy lulu falling knife. Lulu just wrecked me like a month ago. I am a 🤡
Bruh.. this is broooo tallll
[deleted]
Bouncing off 351
i'd recommend transferring to another platform once they actually let us sell. They haven't given us any updates, and their system status says all operational. what bullshit
Nice play retard
What is yrs
Yeah I should have done the same!
Heh....69.
NIO at support. Now is the time to buy if you want in and are still bullish.
Ugh so horny this morning
PLTR and NIO boys in shambles
I should’ve listened I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
I was supposed to go there for 2 weeks this winter to snowboard 😞
I'm not sure but I'm curious as to why anyone cares? Hes going to be a little shit until he leaves so if we all collectively ignore him he wont be able to do as much damage. Someone needs to start an unfollow trump on twitter so he gets the message no one cares.
Buy as many shares of $FSR and hold
IS THIS BLOOD LEAKING OUT OF MY ASS!?
Election not over yet
Did they print?
_I thought I had it all together_ 🎶
My spy puts are already up 69% from this morning and I can’t sell lol
Might need to fuck around & hold RKT bags thru earnings
I have 44C Jan, 50C Mar. OTM Mar, Jun calls still look cheap IMO.
losing an umcomfortable amount of money...
Holy shit dude can you literally not tell I am being sarcastic. Holy shit both you need to pull your heads out of your asses lol. JFC due anyone on this board who hasn't posted proof is a wanna be millionare lol. Seriously work on that insecurity sheesh.
Poots?
Not a loss until you sell
Lmao I know people on the sub are retarded so I thought you were being genuine lmfao
Right there with you buddy, wanna hold hands?
Trump tweeting
EV as in "EVerything" dump
Happy cake day!!!
Well I'm fucked. Feels bad man.
Ditto
Not late with pfe ! Get in now
FB back to election levels 😐😐😐
nio fcked me 🤡
Yes things are bad but ask yourself, could it get much worse?

The answer is yes, much worse
Back up NIO
I’m so tired of winning. Are you guys?
This is the way
v o l a t i l i t y
I'm sad that I paper handed some jd weekly 82p that I owned for .1.
Mega cap tech has been arrogant in its price action this summer and must now rug pull to atone for its sins
Felt bad all day yesterday about selling NIO on friday. Feel better today even if I just lost 11k on BABA.
Holy shit are you trying to say buy low sell high? Thats cray
Holy shit nio freefalling
I'm such an idiot I paper handed and sold my SPY 358 puts at open left a grand on the table
Welp looks like today is the day I finally reach zero.  Been a long time coming.  Should have just put the money in my fucking index funds
This rotation is brutal
Is the world ending? What the fuck is happening
ALL IN on BABA FUCK IT
yeah it's good today
What happened? Why is it crashing?
I think Trevor's next level will be to move on ponzi schemes. He need to make over 64.8bil to pass Madoff but Trevors is realy good at scamming.
All my gains from last week are gone 🤡
I’m straight up not having a good time
I see so many people here and other places online hyping up SPG.  How do people actually think investing in malls a good idea?  They were dying before COVID and I imagine they are bleeding rent money through the year.  The only sign of hope I can see for large malls/retail properties is leasing/selling their property to amazon for warehouses
Should I cut losses with NIO
Triple top theory looking to be right. We got ourselves another September 3rd/ June 11 style face ripper
bulls in shambles
I really bought into NIO 5 minutes before it tanked. Lmao
Sold my spy puts at open 🤡
MUHAHAHHA MUHAHHA NIO MUHAHAHA
Oh shit bro. Didn’t realise i was talking to a natural born killer
Yea, I just think it’s a pretty major setback in the short term. Investors will be very skeptical of how these new regulations play out
i have too much in em, lost like 13k td or somn
VEEV 😭😭
Revenge of the Bears
BUT WHY IS EVERYTHING RED
Not a pleasant smell
The whole market is deep red
Good lord
this shit must be on ez mode once you’ve amounted 25k
What are odds Mango concedes or Stim talks hit news before EOD Friday? 

As that’s the only catalysts I see stopping us from having a serious dump
Just entered Tesla calls yeeeaaaaa
we did it pop
Before ER on Tuesday.
How about now!
Not at all your post is just retarded.  All I owned coming into today was 353 puts that are up 250% right now

Blaming biden who is being illegally denied even beginning his transition is mental retard shit
fed warns assets could take big hit, spy 400 eoy confirmed?
NIO yes, ZM though.... you're finna get hurt my boy
I’ll ask him when he gets back from your mom’s house
Buy some puts please, my leaps will thank you
Market love vaccine
It's at support rn, will have to see how it performs
[deleted]
Anyone down more than 40%😅😂 counting -2K loss here
Never gay bear boys in for a rough week. 🙏
Mango called the top yesterday 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
if it gets to the day he is set to sit in the chair - look out, then you will see terrible...
Robinhood hasn't worked once all day. 🤡😢
so hard not to panic sell oof
Fck u joe biden
Tech bulls, these kind of rotations can last multiple years...

NIO LOL, "guys it's just a pullback"

You would imagine WSB jerks them off for going 0 to 30k in 3 months.
Rug pull :(
How is Japan doing? I’m thinking of going on a 2 week trip if my account goes up 1k
Zm puts I skipped on midday yesterday are 20 baggers, pain

Get some PTON puts. Moves pretty identical to ZM
Imagine buying calls on spy at 360+
yea im down $1,100 today
lmao, I was just joking too but looking at my comment, it looks like I'm angry. Whoops
AMD yes..bought shares
Dem Bers at it again!!!
This feels like Battery Day all over again 🤮 My PTSD flashbacks are flaring up

What are u in ?
Hmm once this pfizer pump dies down, tech gonna look good again. Pandemic not over until all people are immune to the virus. I’m averaging down the dips though
it broken
NKLA
That’s true, but it kind of seems China is too scared of having corporations larger than the government like in the US. This seems like it would take away some competitive edge
lol rip
NIO pls :(
😓
Of course RKT has earnings again on a day the market tanks. I’m never going to get rid of these bags.
[deleted]
Fuck you
naked puts means I sold puts. I kind of want to sell some more today. Zoom is crashing, in a different sense.
Excuse me NIO
I look at particular news for main stonks I follow, don’t really follow Chinese stocks that much just noticed baba was down big. Chill man
No bad news came out for NIO right? Can’t find anything. Seems like a massive paper hand dump before earnings
I'm just gonna close my app for today,  nothing good will come of looking today
Does anyone else smell a circuit breaker coming ?
I swear anytime spy hits 360 the next day it just tanks 🤡
[deleted]

100 p/e
baba broke lol... if i lost 30k this week on tech longs, if i roll them into shorter expiry, and get more, could i hit these baggers back? do mm's fuck large weekly option positions?
yeeeesh what’s it printing
Time to get delete broker so I don’t sell. Diamond hands through this
Amd?! Look at NVDA!!! Jesus fucking christ.
We’re alive
thx you reversed it for all of us
It will bounce back, I did the same shit though, fucking sucks
To the drain
These people need to be kicked
A lot of the people who posted 100k, 300k, 500k+ gains in the summer are broke now.  Their strategy was luckily suited to the time, but they didn't adjust. They're not going to post a followup to tell you they lost it all though.
[deleted]
Lmao this thread is fucking hilarious
[deleted]
[deleted]
Beautiful. Anyone else still holding puts fro  yesterday?
Fake as fuck NIO dump. Check out Level II.
Yeah but i don’t think you’re hearing me 

_what the fuqqq_
My puts are printing
I have bit of cash, i ll throw all into Nvidia Leaps
Baba
decided to stop messing with weekly and just went long, bought on the drop at 41 and bled some but diamond handing.
Suits are bitches I bet baba can’t hit -15%
Anyone else Yolo on BABA calls?
Once again, the leading bear indicator - The Trump Tweet bragging about how high the stock market is- wins. I keep telling myself to buy puts whenever he does it, but never can follow through....
DOWN GOES FRAZIER. DOWN GOES FRAZIER.
Hahahahaha nio bulls so fukkkkk
The autists are good with numbers. I'm sorry to be the one to diagnose this, but.. your boyfriend is retarded.
remember when kodak hit 40, earnings are coming back around
This isnt your normal mode of operating?
Cya at $50 in a week
BA
So CRSR beats earning by 100% of eps, tanks. SNAP beat eps by 6% and doubles in price. I clearly have no idea what’s right and am 🤡🤡🤡
RIP to us both. Just bought calls on $ROPE
im switching out of it once they actually let me sell.

And no updates from them whatsoever. All their update status says 'operational' what fucking bullshit
Yeah... but on the bright side I made a fuck ton of money
So why I EV dumping
GG airlines
He will fucking do it to

When do you think it’ll hit 50?
TDOC keeps selling off like it is ZM but it was flat for 3 months -_-

There is simply no better predictor of the market top than Mango. Fucking uncanny.
DROP DROP DROP DROP DROP!

I’ve got shares, holding till it hits 45 baby
No but not literally all last week's gains gone in 2 days. I bought the dip today and am still getting fucked
Lol circuit breaker on AMD? What a buying opportunity
Fauci was expecting only 50-60% and said this was great news. But yeah, I'll take the word of a rando internet comment instead.
Made 70% on ford Jan 15 calls. Don't ask how far down on my overall.
Rip
What did I miss lol
Buy the dip
That County is El Paso County btw. Blue city desperate for work, red state to give them leeway.

They already announced their plans for a distribution center here. But we are wrecked by covid atm with a 10th morgue on wheels on the way.
Give some of your favourite examples
You should long some MU $90 C, a strangle
Oooof
Tesla ...heading for a big big red day
Are weedstocks the safe haven? What the fuck!
Why aren’t my Nikola puts making me money! This company stinks
Buy again. They'll be up eventually. You're probably looking at holding for a while. Their next earnings will probably be insane.
Surprised pikachu gif

FUUUUUCK
Blasphemy!
Wow, you seem very upset.
I hate this market
can't lie almost bought CHWY calls yesterday
Here it goes.
Damn that really was a bull trap huh
This is looking pretty ugly today
BA FLYING TO THE OCEAN
Nio, what is you doin baby?
Honestly a positive net worth at your age is actually impressive.
Lol keep falling for the pump and dumps. If the market cared about any of that we would be sitting around SPY 220 right now. Yesterday was “Biden is great for the market. SPY 400c here we come.”
MSFT or Amazon or tesla
10k plays if poverty level like the rest of WSB, you are one of us... the 99% of WSB want to be a millionaire someday.
Gme..... what the fuck.... short have to be over 200% now.
Also just some advice - work on that insecurity. Both of you lol. "You can make money with other plays". Man what stellar words of wisdom lol.
Recovery stocks will go up tomorrow
Hahaha
now THIS
Ok, now some of the boomer stocks are beginning to fall as well...
Look out below NIO
say what? The ducking vaccine causing this dump?
I still don't see it dropping much more than it has the past few weeks. Buy leaps and let them ride for a few months
How fucking low are we going NIO? JFC
My 125 Jan please do something apple! Been getting cucked the last two months.. oh well averaging down once again I guess
What the F happened to Tesla!!
MY BUTTCHEEKS!
I had to sell and realize -8k loss. No end in sight lol

AAAAHHHH....crap
Why NIO falling so much?
[deleted]
Once these nio calls expire worthless on Friday my account will be nothing and I'll finally be free. Sweet relief.
Just happened...
The NIO puts I sold to someone are up 322% Jesus. Ain’t getting to 37 this week though
How much longer before my NIO puts are making me what my calls are losing?
BABA... bro?
Nikola is the Theranos of EV’s.
[deleted]
VXX on a screamer
can someone explain tesla?
Just because something has traded at 300 doesn’t guarantee they will get there again
Wells Fargo has a target of 77$ on bynd and JP morgan have 104$.

So they ramp on the way up and stick the knife in on the way down. Classy.
Jesus fucking Christ
I was wondering the same thing tbh, but it fixed.
Ever heard of a correction after a massive rally? This happens all the time. People take their profits and sell. Quit paper handing and crying about it

Honestly considering buying some January debit spreads.
Don’t be mad bro, I’m still down $30 on these FD’s

What’s wrong
i'm starting to think going all-in on tech wasnt a smart move
My portfolio up 2%!
Does anyone have extra $ROPE?
Fair enough. At what point would you cut the loss if it isn’t playing out?
And down we go

Too big to fail. It's in their best interest BABA succeeds, having a giant like BABA for international presence.
It’s okay, I didn’t want any of those gains anyway
YA WTF
what is going on with schwab? anyone else having trouble? i get no option quotes atm, and every ticker i click on - a huge green dildo appears, even though i am playing puts or shorts on them...but the account balance is up
same. sometimes its good to be broke so you cant afford shit like BABA calls and actually become broke again
jesus christ, it's like no one in here ever reads any news except what they see in WSB comments. GYNA ANTITRUST LAW, MAN.
Robinhood please man
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a nice pullback this week but a strong bull week next week. I'd say there's still some hope
It’s a joke bro I know who warren fucking bull lord buffet is
Okay what the fuck
148% IV. Have fun with that.
Fuck is going on with NVDA
Really appreciate all of your terrible ideas retards.
For puts. I agree.
If it helps you play on, sure. just woke up. I bought early yesterday. I had no idea how much worse it could get. Man I am sorry. Wow BABA, wow JD. Wow SQ. I still need to look at the stocks I follow. What is going on...
What did he say?
AAPL with the RKO
guess i signed up too late, EDD gone too
Yeah this red day is Biden’s fault!  It’s not like the market took a fucking nosedive during McConnell’s speech on the senate floor yesterday and now trump is firing the only senate confirmed cabinet officials he has and starting a bunch of shit!  No way!  Fuck biden!
Green EOD! Green EOD! Green EOD!
Add more stocks to your watchlist. Plenty of stuff on my watchlist solid green. Your watchlist is not diversified enough.

Lol y’all are true retards. “Biden kill markets wahhh”.

This has nothing to do with Biden or Trump.
BABA going down due to CCP smacking Jack ma quit asking why it's going down.
All time high Covid cases in the USA, uncertain presidential dispute, possible lockdown, and the vaccine isn't confirmed to be logistically possible.

Show your positions or GTFO.

it feels like its just the retail favourites getting hit.
what gonna happen with kodk earnings
[removed]
what a bunch of ameriturds
Holy fuck. Everything is falling
dude are you dumb, vaccine is possibly bad for tech and there is a rotation into russel 2k type stocks from nasdaq type stocks. 

fucking morons on here, seriously you're an idiot
Thanks it’s just my shitty Internet
#🚨🆘🚨
If you were looking for a buying opportunity this is it
Wow
So fucking happy I bought 10x SPG calls friday I’m making too much money.
My GES stock is up 3.5%, what you guys know about high fashion
Snip snap snip snap
It smells like wet bitch in here .
wonder if the growth tech bubble is finally popping because of that vaccine news, ZM down 25% in two days
Not participating in last weeks rally but being all in since friday...
It’s like some people in here haven’t seen an ev pump and dump before
Coca Cola is bottling for Pfizer, thats why its pumping
we’ll get shamed eventually. it’s been too good for too long
Take profits now before the revenge of the bulls
SPY 350 expiring Friday is free money. I know fuck TA voodoo bullshit, but every time we are overextended on the SPY daily we fill the gap. Let it cool down for a few days then I'm sure we'll go back to ATH before long.
also the world's richest investor, but let us just focus on his negative.
SQQQ literally trying to hold up the earth for me
lol not to get too political, but in the pol sub they were like MARKETS HAVE SPOKEN, THEY LOVE BIDEN and im thinking smh... if u only knew wtf was happening these last few months.  market loves fucking nobody hahaha
Buy high sell low I like it
If you like losing money
[removed]
So, is it possible we are actually going to tank off of vaccine news? The market realizing a world without covid:

1. Doesn't give sufficient headwind to overbloated tech stocks

1. Still leaves small caps economically damaged

The schadenfreude would be delicious
hang in there
🧠
Cuz it’s 2020 and stonks only go up
I’m not taking Pfizer vaccine cause of what they did to tech
I want to thank DKNG for being absolutely useless
Cause I usually buy  in on red days, also I tend to take into account red days for the contract duration as well as where the price action is mostly traded at.
It’s proven to easily trade north of 300. The upside is medium risk high reward
I think were looking at nothing until next week then it'll be really spicy
Why is tech dumping so much? We were just pumping last week
Uh oh lol
This is nothing for NIO lol
'Market rotation' but where. Like everything is dropping
For a reason cause they’ll print
No it’s just people whine like a bitch and say the sky is falling and to load up on puts when in reality 9/10 times there’s a dip from 10:30-11:30
Like someone else said, get a fuckin job. You might even get a gf to cry too,I hear the bitches are ez that work fastfood
Robinhood actually fucked me. I am a retard for using it.
Was up 20% on my DOCU call this morning, but it looked like it was about to tank again. Went to sell, but wobinhood made a wittle oopsie! Had some twouble with high twaffic :(

 -60% isn't too bad! Accidents happen 🤷‍♂️
NVDA down $90 in like 48 hours. Real cool guys, real cool!
Never knew I could be this greedy, it can get to anyone. NIO calls loading up time.

FVRR stupidly oversold right now

wtf is this correction? I mean is there any reason like mango tweet or smth?
Yeah, fuck those commies. Just let the market do it’s thing
Watching my ZM calls going from -$7.5k to -$9k. 

This is okay 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
If you ask me, they're sending a signal that they're in control, and that the chinese markets will not be wild-west exchanges where ridiculous companies dealing in hundreds of billions of dollars of sketchy debts/loans. The five year plan did include "quality" as a key theme. I think once Ant/Baba remove these parts of the business from the offering they still look good and it should be encouraging that the chinese regulators are actively trying to build credibility.
Was gonna buy puts on DDOG for earnings but now that they’ve been getting hammered? 🤔
What does it mean lol.
well i sold my ZM puts a little too early. but profit is profit i guess

I’m alive but I’m dead
>Bear in mind that Nikola is a pre-revenue company, thereby rendering its top-line and bottom-line growth metrics mostly inconsequential.

>For the three months that ended on the 30th of September, Nikola earned $0 in revenue. Last quarter, the company had earned $30,000 in revenue.

>Last quarter’s revenue was primarily earned through the company’s solar business.
E*TRADE wouldn’t let me sell mine lmao, now down 😔
Major green all week. Did you guys really think this was going to last?
This whole fucking thing is a scam.. oh the election so bad for markets... face ripping non stop rally spy having 3+ days.. 2 days later boom flip it back now everyone’s bullish

I seem to be really good at timing credit  all spreads. Easy, really. Buying puts, not so much. Just sold my PTON puts yesterday which I bought at the wrong time for a small loss. Should have held 

It's hard to be a bear and make money buying puts because corrections r so fast.
FB looking nasty
Open think or swim, look at rsi. Guess from there, and check news for it. Market looks down today, I'd probably just hold for today but I have no idea on RKT
If you turn off your brokerage app it's like you stop losing money 🌝
Hey at least we are all dying together
$OPK
Wish I could dump these RKT calls
i sold at the top cause the election spy500 said it was sell time and this week is buy time
Thanks man. 💎🙏
I remember.  I bought early on that day.  I'm still bag holding as a result.
I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING
Not too late.  Can still buy reopening stocks at discounted prices.

Well let’s see, insane amount of profit for used games and consoles— everyone downloads. Small % profit off new games but oh wait you still need Internet and have to download updates before playing... so why need a cd then? GameStop is a losers buy

Sell out of PLTR options down 60% or wait and hope for tomorrow to hopefully get out at a 40% loss
Like someone said before, I think its the initial sell off after the bounce. Give it time.

Anybody with enough money for a supercar buys a green lambo, if they're more sophisticated they buy a red Ferrari. No one is buying an Aston anymore, they're grey and boring and don't have the crazy looks or excitement of the other manufacturers.
Kangaroo Island, Australia.
By the way, before you buy BABA remember that tomorrow is “singles day” in China where unmarried people buy gifts for themselves. Although it seems bullish, historically they’ve dipped on every previous 11/11. So maybe 11/12 or 11/13 would be a better buying opportunity
AMD why you always do this when I buy calls
I SMELL BITCH IN HERE
I actually think technicals are helpful and this isn’t a terrible idea but the entire sector is getting crushed rn. Why not wait for tech to show some strength before you buy?

Personally I'd wait to see if it continues falling to about $76 or so, but yeah playing AMD's consolidation pattern right now is pretty fucking easy if you're remotely patient.
And?
Calls it is.  Take a look at the WHO data and tell me where you see 3k deaths per day in July?  I see it in April when Gov Homo in NY was killing off his old people with his executive order but otherwise we're pretty much tracking lower since then.  

https://covid19.who.int/region/amro/country/us

Deaths do lag, but we've got the elderly locked down pretty hard and so death rates aren't what they were.  Deaths due to covid are less about case numbers and more about what age group/population group is within that case number.    

Can you please explain to me why when we got back to 60k cases a day the death rate was so much lower the second time around?  We've been back above 60k since about the second week of october... yet the death rate stays low.
 
I feel like I'm on an episode of explain things to a five year old.

I placed a sell order in a panic. Immediately cancelled it but it gave me an error saying it couldn’t happen. Order status said unconfirmed.

Alright Zoom you didn’t have to do me dirty like that
I'm really watching this rotation out of tech this time.  FANNG is running 35x EPS...  that's 1999-2000 dotbomb multipliers.  that vaccine comes out...  and the 'stay at home' tech money (ZM, PTON) is going to wash out back to the oil patch imho. it might only be for a quarter for the next crisis / world dilemna / greta whatshernuts / snowflake virtue signalling...  oil is dependable and the boomers are still the ones making the big money decisions. here's something ppl don't know...  airlines and cruise lines are big buyers of oil futures, especially when prices are washed out... it locks in their cost.  also, if they buy more than they need... they sell at a profit.
Got calls at 42.20ish 11/27 though
What bike you got?

From earlier in the year, if the crowd has given up on NVAX, it’s best to be careful...
Maybe just a little since it is at discount price.  But I noticed when this subreddit is talking a lot about a stock, it tends to become more volatile in the coming weeks.  I think it should keep the same trend of going up.  There will just be a bumpy road ahead.
My January calls are holding strong so far. Set a trailing stop loss on my shares just in case and I'm diamond handing these 11/13 calls I bought at the dip. Hope I don't get burned.

It’s already up 67% since it’s IPO. These earnings were most likely already priced in. Happens all the time to tech stocks. stocks rise prior to earnings because everyone expects them to exceed expected earnings. Then when they actually do exceed it, there’s no movement. And in some cases, some companies will blow earnings out of the water but the stock tanks because it wasn’t enough to justify the massive growth prior to earnings. Hope that helps

I'm so tempted to buy since I missed the last couple dips on waiting it out, but damn it's hard to gauge what's going on.

Everything seems to be in some sort of correction territory. The market is trying to price is polar opposite situations. The elections, Covid still raging, vaccines. Basically 2020.

Need money, food, clothes, a place to sleep. go into survival mode and secure that. I've had 3 thousand in debt for like 5 years from an accident when I was 23, it's fine there's scarier things out there than debt.

90% effectiveness is good, but it's not great for something that spreads and kills at a much higher rate than the flu.  Like all vaccines its effectiveness is probably much lower in seniors, so they are still fucked.  Maybe moreso because nobody will be wearing masks anymore.

Hi, my names retard and I went all in on Amazon shares at 3200

I can't wait for biden to get on TV and start saying "solar and wind power" oh boy. THat is going to be great. I guess I can start loading up on some more cheap calls in the meantime.

certainly should have sold at open yesterday though.

I agree.

Yesterday was interesting as fuck. I was banned so I couldn’t talk shit lol. But what the fuck was that? That shit was scary how Vix also ended up 3% yesterday. That euphoria was insane and shit sold off all day.
TWTR
Yk it😉
You don't think people live with their parents until 26?
From 70% up to 60%,  shambles sure
QQQ ripping my asshole
U bought one share BAN

Can't go tits up
Lol, technical analysis.
How come you think that? Convince me and I’ll throw more in.
I realized you just gotta play almost inverse of everything mentioned in here.
“Options” “investing”
That MasterCard dividend really do be slapping when you’re -50% on tech calls and havnt eaten for a week.
Everytime that fat fucking retard tweets about stocks the market crashes. *Every* time.

eh its clear now that vaccine news is a damper on stocks that got a pandemic boost
I did it guys. I finally killed NIO. Apologies for my 12/11 50c
Outstanding
Retarded
Right, completely forgot about that. Even more reason that this makes no sense.
Wtf boomer af stocks is making the market as green? Fuck the Dow, all my homies hate the Dow.
Stop buying the dip on Canadian weed stocks you jagoffs!  Let those overbought bitches die a horrible death.  ACB, CGC, TLRY, and APHA don't benefit from a Biden Presidency or any other US election news.
TSLA loves stopping right above 400, go to 300 so I can buy more shares ffs
Oooo pray for good earnings
Now is a great time to buy even more. I bought 8k yesterday and 500 today.
Well I guess we can take the $ROPE’s off the bears necks and put them on ourselves now. (Big dicked bulls)
Fr wtf is happening to NVDA
Do I exit my NIO 50c 11/27? Down bigly today
NIO selling off hard. Not sure this a healthy pullback.
It's because we bought in the highs
Just calm down.
Honestly best advice right now is stay out of the market today. Today is such fucking bullshit it’ll correct itself by the end of the week. Don’t make any plays no one can tell what’s going on right now this is difficulty level 11/10 right now.
I'm balls deep in tech this month, just give it 2-3 weeks.
This thing broke the technical chart it's good back to 35

TECH losers
yes you do, because you didnt take your money and run when you had the upside of that much.
Time to move out man
Buying puts.

Edit: you do you
You're down 6%. Come back when you're down 85%.
You make me feel better about holding these puts I bought yesterday.
dam i was enjoying the back and forth. sold 75% last week hedged with puts this week.

Run up to $45 is coming tho. Once this hits bottoms out at $31-$32 all in calls again to make 1000%.
Buy 0DTE on Friday for cheap and play the massive pumps or dumps. Just gotta pick the direction.
Yea man I just have 1k in there and letting that ride for me. Too much stress. Where you from. Check ur dm messages from me. Easier to chat
Thanks
Whats the most oversold stock you are eyeing? 

I got my eyes on TDOC.  You?
People have been locked in their houses salivating at the chance to buy a new car. Chad's and Becky's don't want to go over 30k miles because they need a new image to drive around.

Someone tell me NIO is going to recover
Way to leave out 90% of the sub
fuck.. BABA ded
So if you're actually bullish on Nio this is probably the time. Buy when it bounces off 40, no way this doesn't pop after earnings.
Wtf is up with stmp?
I have a feeling that as soon as I push through with the sell order, this BS reverses by end of day. Fuck that, holding my december calls on ZM and NIO.

Only reason AAPL isn’t following TSLA is the event, once the event is done, down goes the fruit stand
Almost through the morning dump. Diamond hands, NIO gang.
Good luck boi don't fuggitup
NIO goes up multiple 5-8% up days for the last two weeks and one 5% down day has everyone running around like chickens with their heads cut off. You guys are ridiculous.

Imma let y’all finish but Trump’s “markets great!” tweet indicator is the best indicator of all time! All time!

Would have been my first 100% play if I didn’t sell my TSLA puts at open. Potential gains lost: $4k 🥴🥴🥴
My portfolio needs a vaccine
Yah doesn’t make sense. Only vehicles that make sense are off road and travel vehicles because people are dying to get out. RVs are sky rocketing
Puts on this guy's business
How tf are markets green?

Isn't the used car market exploding? Might hurt new sales.

Tell me why I'm wrong. Amazon and baba getting hit with anti trust stuff. All in on JUMIA?
It can be nerve racking but its been my most successful day trade play by far this year. Just buy one at open and sell within the first 30 min of trading.
Still amazed that DIA is still green with the other two indices shitting the bed
Should not have sold a PTON put this morning...
So when do I buy this $shop dip
If I have 45k saved up on my 26th bday. Is that ight? I have my own car and motorcycle (fully paid) but live with my parents
I wouldn't put it on either of those 3
Yesterday was a weeks worth of momentum all ah lmao
TWTR has not been so nice since the earnings dump =\[
I would expect it to given its earnings are on 17th
It is all so red. Thanks President Buyden
You're about a week late on those

Wtf is up with auto stocks? All the established companies are back to their Feb highs, except now there is an extra half trillion in market cap from EV manufacturers like NIO and TSLA.

It was already an industry that was dying, how is it better off overall now with covid? Miles driven have to be down 50% this year too, that just pushes back the time until people by a new car.
Exiting the 4th trade would flag you. You can place a trade you just can’t make a round trip.
Bad day for NIO
Pump the brakes on my butthole stock market.
BUY THE DIP
Looks more like a correction based on the spike on the 6th.  That being said, I'm in.

Looks like they fucked you. But anyways, double down.
Y'all saying NIO is gone. Like shut the fuck up. One red day is all it needed to blast off to $50+. Stay mad you guys didn't get in earlier
I'm. Not. Selling.

Already did. BKNG puts up 100% Lmfaoo. Bruh that stock rose by 20% yesterday. Travel isn’t coming back anytime soon even with the vaccine news. That jump yesterday was way too much euphoria.
Ok so now when tech is gay what r u chads going to do?😂😂😂😂🤡
Oof, just saw it tanked again. Idk, man. I can't sell today anymore so I have no choice but I just lost most of yesterday's gains. Gonna go back to bed and hope it rallies so I can sell at open tomorrow. This volatility is stressful so I might just go cash this week and wait until after ER.

It bottomed on Friday. Yesterday was a fomo fluke. Corrected itself by EOD. We’re still not totally off the bottom yet, but probably by tomorrow it will start to take off. If it dies more we are fuk though.
Shorting is safer than selling naked options maybe, but in either case you need to manage your risk.
I thought it would be rotating to value, but I think people are just rotating into cash.
And once again we’re witnessing the revolving door of bulls who are wiped out by one red day. They live longer, but are essentially the same person as the bears who were wiped out late last week holding bags full of puts. 

Long SLV leaps. We ARE in a recession, and it’s not going away for a long time, look at SLV prices a year after the last recession started.

Why is AMD shitting itself so bad
Seize this one for re-education. Enjoy your Uighyr cell mate
BABA is such a shit stock lol

Yeah OP is a fucking 'tard for this, but no other brokerage seems to have shafted their clientele by not exercising a long leg in this scenario. I wonder why?

Anyone else in CRSR? $30 soon?

Having fun, bro?
How have oil stocks not gone down a lot since Biden wants to phase out of fossil fuels
But those where penny stonks Dad!
Eh it’ll be fine just hold for a bit, it’s a long term buy
CRSR big green dicks
Is he that shrewd though? He poured money into Wework when they know the CEO was basically a glorified con man...
As soon as I saw that early rally I knew I had to get out before the dip. Lost most of the profits I had made on my January calls but was able to lock in the 11/13 and was able to buy even more than I originally had cause the premium dropped. Still thinking $45+ EOW, _maybe_ $50
Is NIO hype train over? Puts?
Thanks for the dip nio
The 💉 only helps boomer stonks. Tech was already immune for rona.
how many retards sold CRSR this morning, pls stand up so we can laugh
You wish they were that cool

I wrote one a long ass time ago, but the current presidents green deal, renewable energy focus, targeting the meat factories, things have changed in my mindset. I think long term this is a good stock.

There’s a lot of restaurants adopting veggie burgers and making an entrance there. BYND has a good head start and their burgers are pretty good.
Laggy doesn't begin to explain it... I'm done with RH
The market environment isn't going to back it up. People just aren't buying enough of these.
Instead of trading at work I’m playing old school RuneScape at work. Strategic Robinhood downtime, gotta let the MMs get in before anyone else.

No shit, asshat. Juicy J to be exact.

Anyone playing LYFT earnings?

Obvs Prop22 was good news, but it hasn't corrected at all since then.

Lasts.. everyone will come crawling back into growth
I'm holding my shares and just bought a $30 call in case investors come to their senses in the next two weeks.

PC gaming was gaining mainstream popularity before coronavirus and won't go away when people can go outside again. Not to mention I believe WFH is here to stay and will almost certainly increase.

Turns out the markets were rational after all...
New antitrust rules
Why are all the rere stocks up today? Intc, xom, t
A lot of people don’t realize how wily COST is. Beastly of late, boomer or not. Although, just closed out my short positions yesterday & glad to be out. It’ll wack ya!
Seriously wtf
Yikes... Let me get in on some maybe it'll rebound
-100%. Let that shit expire. I am too proud to pull out that last $100 after losing 10grand.
Oh... I'm still laughing XD
Will snap drill 20% god I hope so
Holy shit GM not slowing down

Oofff.  How's them feels?
it can't go down more, right? :)
TSLA gonna close this week at 375
bullshit they will, their contact is just as shit.
If BYND closes above 130, I will stop eating meat for the rest of the month. Because I will finally be able to afford their products.
I hear you man. Maybe the markets can give you enough to make up for the potential money lose. The extra free time will be worth it too.
I love watching my one week chart on RH in real time. I just went from deep red and down $5k to green and up $12.71 for the past week.  All because another five minutes had passed. It’s almost like that $5k loss never happened. 

I guess it’s all about perspective, right?
I got u fam
Ban
So we still gonna see NIO 50?
Lol who said that? Shorting = unlimited losses, puts = fixed loss
😬 honestly, not being a dick. Hope you sold.

Lol right. Like sometimes stonks go down

Ugly high market correcting...I’m losing $$ but my universal sense of justice is validated so it’s a net gain emotionally

I’ve gone up and down up and down up and down to the exact same level since SoftBank pulled the rug
im selling all my shares and options when RH starts working again and transferring out to another platform.
E*TRADE is good. Physical offices and phone support.  Ameritrade and Fidelity also good.

Why is wsb hyping this dog shit company? They don't do any AI or machine learning, they just package data available everywhere and make them look nice.

It’s down 3.5% after gaining like 47% relax lmao
Im here everyday :(
 You’re weird.
I'll repeat what I said 20 minutes ago, when CVS was hovering around 69.

While everyone's wondering what's going to up or down, CVS is just going up. Hop on, but now it's more expensive. Stop thinking and make money with the rest of us.

70c/75c 1/15/21.
How can the DOW be up and the NASDAQ down? I demand a revote.

They wont be open by then
Was talking to a coworker about stock. Says he has been buying on Robinhood for awhile. Shows me his phone, the only two stocks he has is oil stocks and Nikola 😂😂😂 maybe Cramer is right.
Of course it is.  Where are people going to shop for Christmas when every single store is closed?

Just people taking profit to buy Dow stocks. It will go back. Every 3 months or so, people dump Nasdaq and put their money into Dow and then they realize that Tech is the way to go and come back
The market really punishes you for chasing losses.

Don’t worry I did the same with spy weeklies and down 2k

SE is. Juggernaut
Quit being a victim and feeling sorry for yourself. This is a tiny setback. You’ll face and overcome much bigger issues. Get off your ass and get out there and get it all back.
Should of loaded up on boomer calls.. T 3/19 $30c take me to the moon with you old timers!

He’s just a capitalist in a communist country. It’s unlucky for him, that’s all.
Sell puts then

Buying right before earnings is typically a bad idea unless you have inside info in which case let me know
nope tried to start a business
The amount of money I’ve lost on Nvda alone is staggering
Guys if there's a vaxx we have to go back to our jobs 😥
Ok Mr Market calm tf down Chinese Antitrust not even being unveiled until June 2021 at the earliest.  Unbelievable that just a mention of online retailers could tank BABA this much.
About the enron one is it based on a book of the same name? :p

I have one lying arnd somewhere
I switched to Fidelity in March after all the fuckery back then. Best decision, I have probably spent $500 on commissions, but worth it.
I’m tired of my amd calls and INTC puts both going down
BLDP great entry
Anyone who bought the actual stock at $500 deserves to lose money
Chill you cuck. It’s green EOD

Another even better vignette on Netflix is love death and robots. Each one of those stories hits hard except the first.

Tech calls free money
Its only down 5% lmao. Anybody crying FOMO'd in yesterday with weeklies like a dipshit.
Forget election irregularities, my erection irregularities is what concerns me. That and my TSLA calls are reverse printing.
Buy tech calls EOD, record US Covid cases tonight. Look how many cases we reported yesterday with weekend reporting. Tech is gonna pump again. Coming from a bear.
Not to mention this is Aston Martin we're talking about. I've seen 20 lambos in my life and literally 1 Aston, and that's in the richest and fanciest parts of all the places I've been to.

Her ETF isn’t gonna be an indicator of her losses today. She got Zoom at 530, Fsly at 98, sold some of her Tesla to buy BABA and PYPL dips which have just dipped way more.
Bought this amd dip. Let’s see if I’m dumb or not
PLTR Options
PE ratios already died this year as an indicator of value
Nio stop eating my calls and go up already
It had its valuations pushed pretty high here, so in that sense sure.
Tesla hit my stop loss at $406.50 :(   I guess Im done for the day.
pretty much
Yeah right, tell that to my vxx calls
I’ll take the 1m - 2m bucket but yeah
buying APPS
well, this time it's his own fault for being too high profile and talking shit about things he shouldn't be talking about. can't remember the full speech but he did say something about how "banks are too conservative to give loans to start-ups, require start-up to give everything in order to get the loan, but with ant financial, this wont happen"
Did you just have all tech stocks/stocks that benefit from covid? You'll probably be fine when everything crashes again....
RKT if you dare

home value has risen 5% per year for the last 4 years.  6% this year

edit: housing lasts on average 10 days on market
Hoping zoom crashes to the ground so my boomer professor portfolio gets fucked
By starting something new you mean gambling? Cause thats what options are make no mistake about it.
Its a cloud garbage company
BYND wtf.
Just because you have Tofu with Pudding keycaps doesn't mean you can eat your keyboard

Talking heads man. They want to make people feel good about what they are doing so that they continue to watch — ratings and all. Don’t even get me started on the ponytail’s “unusual options activity”. I shit you not i do exactly the opposite of what they say and it works most 8 out of 10 times. If i had a national platform I’d pump my positions too.
wish i could relate :(
Hmm...anyone else eyeing Zoom calls? This huge sell-off from past 2 days had to bounce back imo...

Don't do this. This is autistic. Do you really think enough people are purchasing sports cars right now? Most people were getting them on credit before. Now, the only people who can buy them are people who don't need them.

I just called China to let them know I got in. Resuming pump in 12min
if you want to lose money
Why would you dump after all these time holding them for a recovery
Lyft only goes up, should have loaded up at open

What are your thoughts buying AMC deep calls, say $4 June 21?
After that split run up Apple has been stagnant

I made the switch to fidelity when my RH account hit $3.72. I have real stocks there so i don't get the PDT restriction

I can’t even get in.

Fuck it I just went all in BABA leaps
Buy baba dip?
Yeah no kidding. Tried to let people know about the life raft that is CCL puts, but some people just want to go down with the ship. Buying CCL puts is like buying the life boat tickets then reselling them for a profit the further the ship gets underwater. Part of me feels bad, but then I’m like mmmm tendies.
Wtf SQ?!???
Zoom is on its deathbed
Depends. Did you buy at the end of the day or beginning of the day yesterday?

Wow so I guess inversing WSB IS the way. Sorry for your loss btw
We don't need it anymore, we're all going to the woods now
BA puts ?
Huh? Why. She’s only down 3% today and up 2% for the week.
Whelp I just bought the PLTR dip. Bigly. Waited till now to get into it. Hope it doesn't let me down.

Same.
Never FOMO and 9/10 always inverse WSB. If it was easy, everyone would be rich, so when everyone here thinks a certain thing, do the opposite. Thats how ive made most of my money lol

AMZN sell off might be overblown. Still a lot of shit to be purchased online in the next 6+ months + holidays. I expect an inevitable inflow back in to tech. I also think AMZN is a sticky service. I don't think everyone will suddenly flock back in to stores + more businesses will want to use their cloud services in general now as a result of seeing what happened during the pandemic. 

Plus PFE trial isn't done yet. Of course I hope it is safe as well as effective, but we don't know yet.

Man, you’re just 21. And while 15k is a huge loss, for someone who’s had the grit and discipline to save up so much money at such a young age, you’ll definitely be okay. Whether you make money in the stock market or somewhere else, you’ll do great. Wsb doesn’t make you homeless. You following the hype here without thinking about your personal risk tolerance did. So when you try to build it all back up, be more cautious with the risk you’re taking on, cut your losses before it’s too much. Only way things will turn around is if you get off your butt and get to work, so go go go.
I’ve been following a company i know and it’s been doing well rather than being a multi ticker guy on 😂😁

Pfizer Vaccine has over 90% efficacy (a good number is like 60%).

Vaccine = No Covid = RIP Covid stocks (Tech).

Granted, we don't have the vaccine yet and it'll be several months before reality affects these tech companies.

But also there are a ton of companies that gain a lot, so you are seeing huge sector rotation as well.

Not only is there good reason to pull money out of tech but there's an equally strong reason to put it elsewhere.
C'mon sector shift
Called at 90, sold 120. Not looking back.

The fuck you short the bottom for bro. Buy low sell high is for bulls
my friend your problems run deeper than this sub, and this offered to you what you thought was a quick and easy way out of all the troubles. but there is no such thing. financially and emotionally volatile people will lose 100% of the times (not 99% like the rest of the tards here). you have to make a concise effort to plough through college and find some kind of work and take care of yourself. your life can and will be better, keep your head down for a little while and take care of the real problems with a professional.

Don’t trade options if you don’t understand them. It’s called IV crush, you bought a contract at an inflated premium price because people expected the underlying to move drastically as a result of earnings. Your 35 calls are now worthless because there’s no chance for it to ever reach that target without any catalysts before expiration. Always look at your break even % and ask yourself if you’re willing to take that risk. If you’re asking why the underlying didn’t move 33% due to decent earnings, then there’s a whole other reason for that (hint: look at the past 3 months)
Ummm, you bought what is it, 4 months out and you're worried about selling?

NIO never fails to print 💰💰

That’s the funniest thing I’ve heard this morning
Whats news on BABA?
Holy F'n squeeze... $250 EOW?

Do you think trump will have to get a job with us at Wendy’s? I’ll move to Burger King.
Man fuck Robinhood. All the bros in my hood are blue jays
fuck you boeing you have no reason to green dildo you piece of shit
I hate myself for selling BA to early
Vaccine news ain’t a vaccine bud it’s going back to 150-160 so

[removed]
Bought 2.5k of puts at the bottom sick
Kodak earnings play???
im so sad lol. lost 30k in may, just dropped another 3 bands into NIO expiring this friday and NIO is tanking. why man. why lol
What do you mean by "only 90% effective \[...\]"? 90%  is a really high percentage for vaccines.
What problems are y'all having with Robinhood? In my case, buying power is all messed up and negative.
Nio, you’re going the wrong way, th- the moon, it’s that way!
How this works? Where I can start learn about options/contacts
I'm trying to cancel my order for a spread on robinhood and I cant do that either
China is so communist lmao
AMZN puts at open are literally free money...can't wait to buys call for when it pumps back up to 3500 in like two weeks
UBER: No, we‘re not a tech company anymore, we‘re travel
That co2 figure is heavily dependant on what the local power station is. It's why elon did solar too, the idea is you charge your car with the panels and never emit co2.
How’s that zoom dip goin
11/11 SPY 340p reporting in, your welcome to all 401ks and call holders for the sacrafice.
Lol almost got shaken out of these BA calls 👀 wowza would have longed $roped.
 FUCK. MY.  ASS.  BABA.
i see everyone saying to get in on NIO but no one ever gives a reason. What if its another Nikola?
Tech selling is relentless jfc
NIO is just too easy 🥴
I feel you brother
FOMO....
Well, 1.3$ billion of a $100B fund...
This SPY pump is pathetic. Let it come home MMs
Would you guys rather have the vaccine be for real and cause tech to crash or the vaccine to be fake and cause tech to moon?
You too are a man of the sea 🍻
I got calls at the bottom and I have no daytrades. See you retards tomorrow
Why on earth did you buy AMD calls yesterday when it rejected the $86 resistance multiple times?

Anyone using Robinhood that can actually trade?
A few months ago this sub was beautiful. Now it’s feeling like stocktwits. Just a bunch of bag holders saying “YOU NEED TO BUY XXX STOCK RIGHT NOW” in hopes that they can convince other retards to buy the stock so they lose less money
Why are we buying PLTR?

Why should I buy?

**YEET, NIO 50c 11/27 @ 42.20ish**
Jokes on MMs I ALREADY lost all my money
**NIO GANG CHECKING IN**

Guess you could call that Theta - decay
Bought at $3.77, sold at $11.20 😎
I am mad, that I bought into the whole China bandwagon, had my chance way back when I paper handed a call for $10 as It spiked to 17.
AAPL bulls fuckkked
Bag holding stock giving me Stockholm syndrome
Does anyone eat BYND patties at Thanksgiving dinner?

Welcome to rest of the world outside of USA and China
Too late, don't
Yes buy that dip it’s about to moon
it dropped 22% already
Bad bad BAD BAD BAAAAAD day for Tech :(
should swap over to NIO calls.
I'm sorry fellow bulls, I think I have committed heresy, but God damn! don't those ZM puts jumping up 40% in 20 minutes feel good or what
Yeah you must be new here
General tech sell off + ANT IPO concerns + Jack Ma pissed off CCP + Meaningful Competitors.

If your time horizon is 1+ years, this is probably a good buying opportunity. I think most of this will get resolved within a year, but it's hard to say. They are not a work from home tech stock and china has been mostly out of lockdown so if anything they should be more resistant to other tech. 

Who knows though, this market is insane.
I agree.
I bought the top 🤧
Have patience fellow
Fair enough, im probably being retarded af right now
I guess SPCE is a tech stock for today and gets to eat shit.
Sources for all three please

We were at 3K/day in July, dumbass. That was with 60K cases a day, now we're at 140K and climbing. Deaths lag cases by 2-3 weeks. 5K easy by January. Buy puts, you fucking cuck.

Nio 21 million in volume over the last three red dildos.
Fuck it's not like we will stop remote working if covid ends. buy the zoom dip
Ye
NIO 60c 1/15/21 on sale.

The whispers are getting louder, this shit gonna run up into NIO day. 

Still only bought 1 contract there because I made too much off my SQQQ call this morning not to be spooked.
Baba will be state owned soon.
If you bought ACB $5>, you deserve to lose all your money.
Apparently a vaccine means people don’t play games on their phones anymore
Dumb to get puts right now right ?
#UNCONFIRMED ORDER STATUS ON SALES OF OPTIONS. wtf is this shit robinhood?
Fvck Pfizer!!!!!! 🔥 In hell
Zoom and ACB puts printing 😈 and NIO calls well rebound...eventually

Lol RKT never rips it's the same .50c move up then proceeds to shit itself for the rest of the day.
wtf GME give me tendies
Robinhood working fine for me
U shape recovery on BA or wassup????
Man I bought weeklies for the Apple event and I got my ass beat. Idk if I should hold till the event starts or get out now :/
nah no bags …. up a fair amount on my position but its just no fun anymore
FSR!
NIO Looking bullish here
Yeah, I'm guessing they should bounce back up with people buying the dip the next few days. I'd be worried if only Nio was in this state, but it's the whole market, and since I'm not doing options I can just wait it out
So glad I never FOMOd into JMIA.
[deleted]
Feeling good that I own a bunch of BA shares
Shits on clearance
NIO is about the do the thing
Nice to see Jd with a candle up while baba acts like a baby

You’ll never guess how much I bought this Apple 150c 1/21 for, it’s truly horrific
Fuck you China!  What kind of shitty commie country goes after it’s most profitable e-commerce biz kills their IPO and then tanks their stock with antitrust the day before their biggest sales event of the year during a fucking pandemic when economy needs recovery??  Fuck this I’m out.  OUT.
I thought I timed the bottom at $415. Heck.

AAPL get off your knees and stop sucking satans dick
Kill your portfolio Tuesday is going strong rn!
take out 50-80%
The fate of my girlfriends christmas present now lies in the hands of Netflix
These last two days wiped out my gains from the last week. Hopefully the fact that I have calls with a little time on them can save it.
You’re in it
F
Lmaooo all these companies investing so much into battery / electric. Let me break something down for yall

1.  Tesla's profits have been solely due to green subsidies. The government creates artificial demand  for "green" products that the market does not even want yet. With out tax dollars funding these companies they wouldnt exist. 

2. Lifetime output of CO2 from tesla (from production to death) is the same as a the output from a gas vehicle

3. Only tangible advantage of electric is cheaper electricity vs gas, which will be offset once batteries dominate the market as increased demand for coal powered electricity will increase prices.

So no environmental benefits and not much financial benefits- maybe lower maintenance cost will one day be the only selling point. The end point here is that people believe theres all this demand and hype for EV when it is just artificial demand created through government subsidies. There really isnt much incentive to go EV unless youre just a fan of electric lol.

$F thinks this last minute ditch into EV will save them. Lol. Puts
My portfolio is fucking $4k I’m so depressed
SE, BABA, AMZN
[deleted]
Is there a small craft advisory? Because damn it’s choppy out there today
It’s going back up what did I say... 💰
Yall got any more of them ev pumps?
The fact that spy is sitting above 350 right now is nothing short of bullshit
Say the post as well, and the call has been carrying my portfolio to the moon rn.
Backing up the truck and buying the hell out of this FVRR dip

Its the trump's tweet from yesterday that is tanking the market
We’re at Nasdaqs biggest support, better hope
it holds or hello 11k
Reading comments in here after going almost entirely cash yesterday really changes things. I'm sitting out of this market for a bit (sold cash cover puts expiring in March and going to buy bonds with the cash for an extra 1%). Its crazy watching this sub when you don't have a dog in the race.
woa look at that monster red - oh now green dild on zm.....someone is fighting back,,what for who knows, did not sell enough yet?
vaccine
Bazooka knew. Selling a few $B worth of AMZN shares last week. That snake. Love it.

GME gonna pump for console launch in 2 days
I’m coming to the conclusion earnings mean jack shit at the moment
I was planning on holding til EOW then dumping but I'm not sure now
Maybe but first shits gotts relax a bit. Honestly I would consider ZM only after vaccine is already out.
[deleted]
Bags?
Dick fell off.
If only I was able to pullout yesterday

For all the "Is it too late to buy NIO?" crowd...now is a good time to buy.
New TSLA. But FSR!  Only came on nasdaq Oct 30th. Trading around $14.50-$15!  Calls. Should double easy.  We are moooonning today
TSLA is one big gay ass piece of shit … stock split was the worst fucking thing that they could have done
HYLN go fuckyourself
It dumps every day lol.
i have the same idea, the drug is not even approved yet, even sector rotation should not be that bad, yet the market act differently, free fall to abyss like tech going bankrupt
SPY 360 by 12 pm
Somebody knows something about tech or Apple, explains this sell off. Loaded puts
I feel like NIO 50 EOW is in play now after this good dip people are gonna pile back in.

What happened to my boy BABA?
Well I'm done with short term trading. Fucking AMZN triggered my stop loss and I could have made 13k instead of like 4k. Beyond tilted so I'm just playing only leaps now cause anything shorter term than that is fucking brain aids. Probably won't be using this sub very much anymore, been fun boys.

Bought puts for apple announcement today
BYND is my play for the day
I would be very interested in meeting a person who has more than one second language. 🤔
Wow, yup. I can’t sell rn.
I made money on the V and DIS run up. now inversing the V position. this is the top for it. 200P 11/20 V  


Edit: Obviously not holding that position to fruition just waiting on a $5.00 Before Market or AH dump and I'll unload it the next day. should happen between now and then
I’m in that bet with you. I’ll buy stock if it dips.
Good now go fuck yourself
BABA you chinese slut i'm in
Same here... oui...
Is it too late to buy in? I need tendies to support my step dads cocaine and stripper habits!
Coronavirus stimulus goes poof
Try 20% 😭
China stocks gonna zoom with biden
No, Amazon is just overvalued.
Stop counting mail-in bids and asks! FRAUD SAD
If it wasn't a falling knife at the moment, I think it would be a good long for earnings. Chances are more free members will have turned into paid, most paid members will have kept their accounts, and in general it continues to be a part of everyday vernacular so it's not going to go away suddenly. They pretty well own that space still.
[deleted]
its called rotation, you trim it to buy the value stocks, or you just simply short it
Someone linked an article about China cracking down on monopolies for e commerce.

Imagine buying more puts on NIO after a 5% dip lol
🤡
VIX is still fucking red. Spidey sense making me think this is a big ol' bear trap.
I know some shit bruh
NVDA moving like a penny stock
Are my 90C Jan 21 AMD calls fuk?
Today not the day for weak Reggie bro
It's a snowball effect of swing traders ditching it once it starts to dip. Initial sell that triggers this is by big money taking profits. Big money probably also has shorts/puts so they are going to profit on this downward movement as well.
Apple is in its own world

Me yesterday: The market is rigged!

Me today: The market is rigged!
Now. Just kidding. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Okay now.
I'm a smart investor so I bought 11/13 365. We have to be reasonable.
Ahh my favourite part of the day, the NIO dip, where I can load up some more. 🥂
[deleted]
Yesterday it was a great day thanks to Buyden, and today is he also guilty of this bleeding or not?
But Cramer said  BABA to the moon?
Robinhood cost me $2000.
Was thinking acb but damn cgc worth 10 billion? Thats over bloated as hell, sure they have maybe 2b in assets/cash but they make only 100m per quarter and they burn 2-3 times that
Fuck me, congrats.
Ummmmm da phuck spy? Hope you lay down a take a nice nap for a while
rip tech
I love instantly being down 10% after entering a position
[deleted]
From where? And when’s the announcement?
Buy high sell low. 

this is the way
This is my fault. I bought yesterday at $44. Tried warning you guys in my post
[deleted]
Pflizer really shouldn't be allowed to annouce this shit before its ready to ship

watch it not even work ... holy shit imagine
Hey SPY do the thing again
Lol the SPY never gives up more then 1%, it literally never happens. It either is flat slightly up or moons. We will be green in about 10 minutes
The secret company that's never released earnings or guidance that's been traded for 2 months? Good DD.
YOU ARE THE PROFIT
Bynd big oof
vaccine bullish everything but tech bro
Freezing on everyone likely.
Good shit man. I Sold mine too for 45% return. I’m holding my TYLR puts though. I have a good strike price of 9. I think I can hold them for a few days.
#🇨🇳
intraday is designed for shaking down options holders. buy at close, sell at open. change my mind
Lollllll
Now
Holy Overreaction
Well happy I sold my 11/20 pltr calls yesterday and rolled them into Dec
buy the dip, ******
Now
Fuck it puts on WFC

That’s a weird looking bear.
if you think you fucked up today, i went all in on BABA calls yesterday at 3:55 pm thinking it would never be that low again. Woke up this morning to -85% and debating whether i should ever open robinhood again.
We all knew NIO was overbought, this is fine
Somehow i only managed to lose $200 with amazon call holy shit
DIE Zoom DIE
Oh fuck
How does one actually look at a stock like BABA and just sell for a loss, cause they panic. How does someone with those kinda paper hands even pick up their morning coffee. I will never understand it.
Bag holding NIO 44c 11/20 and 50c 11/20, fuck your puts and your gains
When it rains, it pours
Nah we would be super green if they did
Lmao this type of wholesomeness ain't allowed here bro
[deleted]
its primarily because of antitrust stuff china ahs implemented
[deleted]
BYND bouncing back!! just bought $130 calls
I’ve been jacked to the tits with FSR/SPAQ for a while I still have a good mix of contracts and shares
No because of Chinese antitrust rules
if you are not buying this dip you aint black
RIP NIO can’t believe you’re only up over 90% the past month
China dropped some anti-trust monopoly bullshit, is the reason
737 Max certification coming
Yeah, mango needs to quit being a whiny little spoiled bitch.
Uh oh
Fuken hell nio on a culling mission, stay safe boys jump out while you can
When do we close our puts and switch to calls?
Dude that's not cool. Mental illness is nothing to joke about. Show some compassion. Also yes, that is the only possible explanation for how so many people lost so much money yesterday.
[deleted]
Good shut BA but im not holding long term 😂
Sell everything and put it into Boeing now you retards, the MAX is BACK
I can't tell if Robinhood is right or broken
Thx
Yeah done using Robinhood what a trash app
China antitrust
Netflix calls are free cash
[deleted]
PLTR dump because of upcoming earnings?  If it goes down to low $13 it seems like a good buy
Bought a baba call at open and still somehow made money
Idk bro but TLRY and APHA leaps are the ones that’s gonna print if you just buy leaps
What a trash week
Dude. Do you realize that bonds real yield is negative? You would be better off holding cash. Anything speculativ (not treasuries) aren’t properly compensating you for the risk. And safe (treasuries) have negative real yields as the fed tries to push us up the risk curve.
You’d be better off in cash, gold, the asset class were not allowed to name, equities, real estate, literally any other asset.

GM and NIO these past few weeks.
Wow. Fuck.
I was so glad I stumbled upon this film, I enjoyed every story, got super dark with the puppet boy, but otherwise bravo
damn RH was lagging like crazy. accidently bought more puts on apple... i was trying to sell it
Sure am glad I bought the “dip”
While everyone's trying to figure out what's going to go up or down, CVS doesn't give a shit the last two weeks and just goes up. Hop on.
How tf
So apparantly Amazon will go bankrupt, because everybody ist already cured and lockdowns are a silly thing of the past. 
Its over NOW and not in a year I guess..
You are bold playing NKLA still lol
Full speed ahead
Are you for real?
360 in no time
Nio bros, is this the correction before resuming rocket to Mars? 

Or where all the bears right and we are headed back to the 20s.
A vaccine pump that doesn't last more than 1 day. Very bearish
I was born with my autism though
Bouta sell my nio puts and roll the ITM longs
So apparently AAPL will not be $118 by Friday 🤣
a 1 dollar decrease after +50% in a week is not tits up
Holy fk ZM in the 300's
Wait til a green candle to buy calls boys so you don’t get burned
Sir, this is a Wendy’s
PTON  break below 100 was my first trade in weeks.

Is the market back on easy mode?
I got no tears left man
Plays?
What’s it doing
That bounce off of 520 for NVDA was insane lol
Not everyone has that luxury. Some places are expensive. Some folks have to work in the city and live in the suburbs and it’s a 1/hr+ each way death sentence no matter how you slice or. Or give up having a family and rent a 1 bedroom in the city for 3x the price and not even have a parking spot. /Boston feels
we not buying dips?
Of course they did, anytime half these fucks touch something it goes to shit
[removed]
Sure
If the market was rational  you would be correct.
BUY ACB
Whoever said NIO can only go up until earnings. Your mama is a hoe. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Fool me thrice, I’m gonna find where your mama lives and fuck her.
I guess better luck tomorrow for us bulls. TOMORROW WE RIDE
It can't and won't. Have a little patience man.
Went from +37% to -30% on poorly timed ZM puts two days in a row. Can't do this anymore
GTEC Running

Small sell off to realize yesterday's gains by paper handed bitches. Stay the course, boys.

Up 99 cents on my RKT call. I get lunch today!!
Damn commies!
RKT has no bottom, stay away
Hope you know that Biden didn’t win and the truth will come out soon. 4 more years!
Anyone following China antitrust law - 1) is this the first time the CCP’s done something like this? And 2) should a long-term shareholder be concerned?
Nah, didn't even know they had a sub. I just thought they were a good company based on my experience with them.
ironic thing is PLTR has probably been given a contract to analyze election data to find anomalies and pinpoint areas in which they occurred.
Flu vaccine needs to be kept at 2 to 8 degrees celcius. Not minus 80 celcius you absolute cunt.

I just had to google "flu vaccine temperature".

Edit : MMR vaccine is -15 celcius or above
Most vaccines is 2C to -8C.

You are a fucking idiot.
you misspelt gambling
damn what did they do to my BABA
To whoever is downvoting everything- it’s not going to save you’re portfolio. Why not do something more productive with your time 🤡

Just sold my ATVI puts and switched to calls. Shit is getting massacred into a strong holiday season for it
[deleted]
Priced in
I couldn’t sell crsr fast enough
Ooof 😂
Lmao
And BABA is falling why?

Because thanks to the vaccine everybody is going to catch a plane on green stonks to go to Asia and pick our stuff in person.

Let's not be F\*king ridiculous algos.
My Nikola puts are doing very nicely
 1 out of 5 COVID patients are diagnosed with mental illness

Then I guess everyone on this sub has caught COVID at least 5 times

You sure hoss? Not a bear by any means btw
Up 138% for the month and gonna be cash gang for mostly today, no good entry point for anything

Lol docu is fucked
JD also taking a shit
nio should realistically be 45 today and 50 by end of week, very nice dip glad to buy it all up after stocks been up 90% in past month
Nio calls aren’t dropping in value. Lol
How could you buy a NVDA put contract with 200.
Is was told PLTR ‘literally could not go tits up’
Just buy boeing.
Fck knows, I'm done with options trading after this one lol.
Have been dealing with issues with various brokers since March. At this point I don’t know who to go with. Anyone have experience with Schwab or Fidelity?

Bro. Either its going the way of lk or its not. Get some 11/20p 10p and below or get calls
I can promise one thing. Spy will not break 352 today. Stay away bears
NIO dirt cheap, probably gonna pick up 1 call just for fun
How come whenever the market opens its so devastating in its percentage and power of destruction
Yeah I definitely expected this, at least BABA gave everyone a little bit of time to get out this morning.
People thought Hitler was a nice guy too 🤷🏽‍♂️
Ok thanks. My portfolio is fuuuuuuuuucked
I'm holding you personally accountable if it doesn't
StOnKs On SaLe

Wow definitely buying this ACB dip
Bought SPY puts so it should start moonin' soon
what dips to buy?
Saw something about a data loss from one of its Indian subsidiaries yesterday.  That's probably not helping!
[deleted]
you bitch i buy and it drops $2
Scat gang.. they’re divesting from YUM! (Taco Bell) Into the new king of the throne
Yeah bro. For reals. I was happy until I realized I have to go back into the office after this shit. May quit my job and find a remote one srs. I’d take a large pay cut tbh. Probably is take even as much as 30-40k less honestly. The commute is NOT worth it.
Why hold it when you can sell it and buy something else in the mean time? But if Time decay ain’t that bad then just hold it. Stay at home stocks are getting destroyed.
I dont wanna get too greedy waiting for nio to dip more knowing how fast this stock rockets upwards
I have made 10 million off of Chinese stocks - again you do you
Absolute rape
Even including the ant ipo delay it was oversold last week.
Went cash gang this morning 🖕😑🖕
Have fun losing 💰
Fuck my hands have never looked so beautiful 💎🙌🏽
markets overreacting imo
Worlds still ending I guess
Did someone declare war?

Is the market gonna take a shit or something what’s going on?
PDD, BABA too

Anything e-com

have you seen the chain effect it had on almost every US listed chinese stock? ...
Puts on Robinhood 11/10
Nio is gonna go back to to 45
I hope you're right lmao
Lmao ACB does it again
If you swapped over to NIO after all these green days instead of waiting for a pullback on NIO (such as today) lol you deserve it. The tendie gods award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul

Is BABA safe now?
what are they doing to my boy NIO? did you fuckers ruin it?
something went wrong please try again
Oh so China is more communist than I ever would have thought. Interesting how that works.
But I got tons of free internet points. Can doctors do that?

Are we yoloing with our lucky gains from yesterday?
Rip the 82.50 secured put i sold on amd lmao
[deleted]
Also new anti-trust issues in China, hitting baba and tencent
Interestingly, that's also when I developed my gambling addiction. Maybe the crushing weight of losing 30k on options is what killed my sex drive. Who knows.
Bought 12/24 calls on PM and PYPL, PM is already poppin
Seems like big funds are taking profits/repositioning because all tech stocks look very similar with a straight line down at open. Won’t be surprised if money starts coming back in and Stonks go back up
If it's just natural market cycle it should be ok. People will buy the dip and it will all be allright in the world
looks like robinhood is taking the ole' robinshit
Thanks nio... or do I buy moar
PLTR $16 by EOD
Lol SE, PINS, and JD all getting FUCKED the last two days. Holy shit.
I sold my shit for 45% return. The spread is huge on mine so I had to sell at the bid which was way lower than advertised
Just gonna hold, it'll recover
Puts on boeing
What you buy ? One share head ass boy lol

Oh wow I hope you didn't buy into their sub hype. Its straight Retarded in there.
Fuck this shit man I’ll go masturbate
Maybe short term but I wouldn't bet on it when more vaccine pumps are coming soon
Looks like a mini apple pump before the event, should dump this afternoon. Might double down.
imma need NIO to reverse now
BA is acting like May/June.
Then who is pumping it
Pulled everything out, fuck this.
🤡
news about new China regulations for anti monopolistic practices. affects alibaba and tencent, etc

Norwegian cruise really deserving of this sustained jump? Crazy to see
im not fucking selling
To Valhalla and beyond

you should cry, i heard it helps relieve stress
You guys wanted a pullback on NIO right? Here is the opportunity, next stop is $50
Haven’t closed the position yet. Going to see if there’s a bounce this afternoon. Already close to max loss so screw it
I’m getting boned because I thought it would go lower...
My account is back from the dead. Remember how I had no money left? Well I managed to go from $200 yesterday to 6K today. No lie. NVDA puts printed. I sold at open which I’m regretting because those are now deeply ITM. Also I bought a MELI 11/13 1250 put yesterday and MELI dropped 20% in the last two days. I sold that one too early because that guy is ITM now. Cash gang currently. It’s just nice to finally have fucking money again in account. I’m sure I’m gonna lose it all again in a week. Taking half profits though.
we are at an all time high in cases, zm will stillbe used next semester despite vaccine announcement
Buy the Aurora cannabis dip and thank me later you dipshits
And that was the  NIO bottom
Exited weeklies on NIO rolled out to Christmas Calls and they’re printing already lmao

That’s so cool acb has refused to let me sell my puts the past couple days so I guess I’m just stuck with this bs till it expires

Yup I'm just gonna close the app and play some fallout and hope my calls come back up from the depths of hell while I'm not looking
NIO will be back to $45 by lunch LOL.
Good man. Pigs get rich. Hogs get slaughtered. My $360 11/20 short call is looking okay. My $130 VTWO 11/20 less so. That and the $65 11/20 RTX call I sold I wish I could have back.

EDIT: just rolled the RTX $65 out to a $70 January for a $.60 credit.
jOe bIDeN
You were warned.
It had gone up 30 points on Friday and usually when that happens with roku, it goes down a bit the next market day. How much it went down was the big surprise

2 months of fucking red. Then 5 days of green and this bitch again decides to dump. WTF man why the fuck is this shit happening this is fucking bullshit.
Rip PLTR?
bad environment today, just tough luck really. Hopefully some analyst will up the price target and give it a little boost into the green later on today.
RH is working just fine for me because I'm in the LEVEL 3 Options club
try -30 in one day buddy   


calls on ROPE
Well it depends if you are short on FSR or not. Personally I would not sell calls on meme stonks.
As of recent, this has to be the hardest year to trade anything.
Because I always lose money being rational. I think that this shit is about to dump, so it will probably moon

Fuck, you could be right.
This shit is so predictable yet most of you keep falling for the tricks. Pump and dumps have been happening forever yet most will never learn. Someone yesterday was arguing how 01/21 400c SPY was free money

Lol all the people crying on a Nio dip. It’s up over 90% in a month. What did you think would happen? This is part of the process on your way to the moon.
BABA dudes... Diamond hands 💎 

Holding $290 1/15/21 
And $300 2/19/21
Down 20k in under 2 days. Needless to say we are fuked...

I didn’t know what to buy this morning, so i decided to trade on the first ticker I saw on WSB; so I bought puts in TLRY because of you. It’s not what you really call smart informed investing....
BA is taking all of the strength away from BABA
Might buy a put to make the market turn around
Think it’s a buy rn?
I'm holding 12/18 35c and 4/16 37.5c.  Made some fantastic money yesterday and sold the 12/18s and bought back in this morning.
Thank GOD I didnt FOMO yesterday
CRSR beat earnings now let’s fly
I just did the same thing, am i retarded now?
YOU AINT SELLING!!! -RH App
Lmao what did KNDI do?
Really glad I watched those NVDA puts that the unusual whales bot called out yesterday go from .18 each to over 3.00 each over night 🙂. It was certainly worth opening a small position
[deleted]
Im so done with robinhood
That rally was faker than my moms tits.

Relax, NIO was pumping a lot the last days. Give it a break. Don't get impatient.
Glad I panic sold at market close lol
I hope Biden and Harris will cut taxes massively
Hey man! First time losses are the absolute worst. I still remember when I felt like killing myself losing a lot of money (here we refer to it jokingly as long $ROPE). 

I just want to tell you that it is JUST money. Don't ever let yourself down the crazy road of going long on ROPE. 

Life is incredibly precious. Money comes and goes. 

You have retards and autists like us to give you company losing money! 

P.S Learn from this incident for next time!
What if we all held our positions and stopped pumping it on here??
Oh yeah bro my zm acb and jmia puts remind me how fun it is to buy puts😂🤑🤑
Especially when the announcement was made outside of a peer reviewed publication.
Lacking weight and density in your scrote
Sir*
Probably be closer to 37
So you cash ganged election but bought in when the election became disputed?
Square bond offering good or bad???

YUP RIP
Oh no here’s the best part, I put 100% of my buying power towards it 🤡
Can I put my nuts on ya chin
wtf is going on with BABA
There are many ways to reach the end goal. 

You should be proud of what you have achieved, regardless of how you got there.
We see a 1700 point jump in the market and we wonder why were dropping......?
Beautiful
>China has released a draft antitrust guideline to rein in internet-based monopolies
, signalling policymakers’ heightened concerns over the growing power, influence and risks of digital platforms and their market practices in the economy. The move immediately erased about US$102 billion of market value from Alibaba Group Holding, Tencent Holdings and Meituan.
Welp
Looking to Jump back into NVDA maybe EOD, or is it going to bleed more tmrw? 

ER is 11/18, might run back up a bit?
Good luck with that when insiders lockup expires. Freeing up 136-166M shares to sell
why the hard drop, overbought?
why is it falling like this tho?
FUCK FUCK FUCK


NVM TECH STILL BULLISH
[deleted]

Will BABA ever recover from these antitrust laws? Lmao
CNK saving my ass yet again

In the end, a great thing for humanity is for investors to continue buying NIO
Fuck this
Pull the rug a little more plz.
I’m going to keep holding the calls tbh they’ve already gone down a lot and today is just a shit day overall it seems. But at least since Corsair did so well it’s not tanking LMAO.
I think we all got scammed on to PLTR for some reason so fucktards can make a short squeeze leaving us in the shit hole to eat our way out
[removed]
I really need to start proof reading my one-liners more closely.

English is my only second language.
Boy BABA sure fucked me up

Someone who is losing a fuck ton of money is downvoting awwww so sad
BABA has been getting hit with bad news for a bit now, Singles Day would have the cure for covid on sale in order to save it at this point..
everyone was like "its a lock to go beyond 300".  I sat this one out.
Lol this sub. It’s empty because mods just randomly ban you. But anyways I’m back bitches. I don’t even know what i was banned for.

Nope
SNAP finally dropping?
5am press release of China threatening new anti-trust laws. BABA not directly named, but who knows.
I was literally just telling people to take profits on their gains, not tryna seem like a hero. Anyone with half a brain knows that ACB is a dumpster fire and if you make money you should get out as quick as possible
holy shit

I put a huge amount of shares into a meme stock for the first time - FSR

I hope this euphoria isn't a bear trap

Should I sell a covered call on it or nah?
Aurora Borealis (ACB) is no more 😆

What did amd do to deserve such a fate?
lmk if I can return the favor for you sometime
Going to sleep
Ba keeping me alive
[removed]
RKT does this every single day. Give it an hour.
Pton just announced a partnership with Beyoncé ? Why isn’t the stock mooning
How is it possible, that any time I buy a call, the stock drills, and anytime I buy a put, the motha fucka rally’s.
It’s like clockwork
In 5 years will we be using more or less energy? Buy accordingly.

That is fucking hilarious.
AAL Is tearing me a new one
Wtf happened to Baba?
How people aren’t buying the dip is beyond me
Is pypal going bankrupt?? What the living shit is this
So gratifying to see ZM trading in the 300s again. I just wish I'd been able to time it. Got burned so many times trying short that fucking stock...
Good earnings, multiple upgrades, Tesla chip sale rumours, and this bitch fucking craters. Lmao kill me

I can’t sell. Is robinhood broken 😡
My advise for the day.  Keep your hands in your pants until the market closes.
They are arguing if parts of it are unconstitutional the whole thing is unconstitutional so yes the whole ACA.
portfolio down 14% already fml.
Wow I woke up on the wrong side of the bed to be seeing red this morning

Yo I’m lowkey not having fun right now
Or is it....

Rip nio fuck boys
My thoughts exactly, my dood. Still watching my NIO shares and getting a little nervous though
Shit yes PUTS
Yes, people who will come up with any excuse to work from home will all of the sudden be clamoring to get back to work.  And they will want to wait in long lines in stores too rather than getting free delivery from Amazon.
First time buying options 11/13 UBER 49c, idk what I’m doing but I’m losing money
SNE you're making me sad. It's console release week and you're acting like a shy child hiding behind big tech's skirts while they angrily yell at the manager.

Most energy stocks are at 1/2 of their Jan/Feb 2020 peaks.  They spiked yesterday, but XON, COP, etc. are still half, or less than half of prior.  I like the play for TOT due to their investment in green.  

Even though energy has been in the shitter for 7 months, think it's time to revisit?
Cash gang reporting. Much more down to go.

not a doctor yet...almost there but this is very significant news... hopefully no more adverse events are reported but the end of corona is in sight. Even if we do get full approval the biggest issues will then shift to production/distribution which is a whole other beast onto itself. also took a big L to my tech profits, not fun seeing a huge green to a huge red day
McPossible better
Okay time to buy more NIO when it drops below 40 lol

Holy shit, you were right 

Gimme another prediction for tomorrow sensei
GUH NIO and BABA
TSLA 11/13 $420c ?
nah, i'm not worried about that, its just looking at daily pattern. It dumps pretty regularly for the first hour, and then does a slow climb for the rest of the day. Excellent time to buy. Volume shows that people believe in it.
NIO baby what is you doing
fuck I didn't even realize im closing in on a lot of my January expirations which are at big losses
Not me an my small portfolio. I’m new but I deff leaped in an bought 600 dollars worth of stock when it crashed during covid I’m up 2 grand on food industry an housing stocks
TDOC $210c  1/15/21

I should have went for the $200, but eh.

Also [MSI](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16224/msi-confirms-fire-at-pcb-factory-in-baoan-china) has had an incident.

Its dropping because of mcdonalds releasing their own burger
Was able to close my terrible DOCU fds i bought yesterday this morning thank god...
Always has 😉
no - tech is dumping because it was in a bubble of epic proportions and it looks like (maybe not)  that it is now bursting, and if so then its every one for themselves as you rush to the exit to sell and preserve capital...good luck
lmao apple the god being the only green one. But we all know its going to sell off after the event.. LMAO. but there's 1 % chance it wont and just go up... Im going to be a clown and hold.
Me too!
rip to whoever I saw buy 28k shares of ACB at $14 yesterday

Classic RKT plummet to earths core at open 

😭 🔫
Wtf happened to baba?
Same here. I think it's actually a good company though. I hope it tanks some more after earnings today so I can pick up some cheap leaps.
When is it safe to buy tech?
This is the exact reason I prefer buying months out options because I have trust issues
Please don't. ACB is trash. Also, forget weed for a while, Trump is still president and it will take a while for Biden to do something.
[deleted]
I had some SNAP 37Ps that I sold yesterday for a loss, because I thought that they wouldn't drop below $40, damn these paperhands bc I would have made a gain off of them 😢

So tech is dumping because everyone suddenly thinks that a vaccine, which is still months away from full rollout (let alone showing any tangible effect in community transmission) will immediately stop everyone working from home 😂

Have I got that right?
How's that Biden dump coming along? Still waiting huh?

Im up over $12,000 since last Wednesday on my investments.
Tried to save fucking $5 on NIO puts and missed out on $500 smh

We are sitting on a sky-high short interest and any good news are going to set this one off. It most probably won't happen this week, if at all, but selling naked calls on GME is begging to get your portfolio raped
Up 10k so I took out 1 off the 500 contracts play and gonna let the rest ride this week

Sold one put at open and another when it looked like it wasn't going to break 354 again... oops 😬

Got 31 more days on them
Was somehow able to salvage some at open. Yep we dead. Lesson learned, best way to approach this
that's why they call it a bloodbath
Exactly as I suspected. You all got here in March/April and have only seen tech go up. Nevermind that the vaccine is here and tech is already priced for perfection. It went uppies before there it will always go up!
god i wish i could smoke weed
Wtf happened. How does crushing earnings result in a decrease in price when similar companies such as Logitech saw the opposite happen.
Die NVDA DIE!
Anybody know why BABA is falling off of a cliff?
If that is the case then you could sell TQQQ Credit call spreads over and over again if "tech is going down" as you say.

When you sell Credit call spreads, you make money when the stock price does not go above the strike you sell.

ThetaGang.
So much volume in NIO
Fuck... i sold
Meh. Win some lose some. Not my biggest loss. It was close.
haha
don't touch this shite
I don't know where that big green dong for AAPL came from.. but the ability to grab some 116p for cheap is appreciated.. I think. We'll know eod.

What happened to baba?
Biden already said he will bring back Obama care plus the mandate. Its also clear that the Supreme Court will be packed and plenty of Rino's like mitt Romney will sign off on Biden agenda. I don't see this have any effect on the market.

We holding or selling these ACB puts?
NIO 4 lyfe
I dunno guys. 150k cases per day or more by end of week with the trend exponential. People in Europe getting oxygen in their cars because there’s no room in hospitals. Great news on the vaccine efficacy from the company report, but it’s not all good - it requires two doses, with no news at all yet on how long it’s effective for. Assuming it’s longer than a month, it then needs national (and global) rollout including constant storage at -75c along the entire supply chain. That’s a specialist lab freezer. Your Westinghouse does -18c (0F). This is all assuming that people are actually going to take it. We aren’t out of the woods on this by a fucking long shot.
[deleted]
RIP BABA call holders. Big ouch
Time to grab ACB?
yeah i’m just gonna get in the shower, so annoying. it won’t update options or let me sell

It's funny ya'll make fun of technical analysts but you all are essentially going with your gut. "Hmm I think the price should be $400".  TA is better than the delusional fever dreams of a broke degenerate
$2.7bn market cap for a company projecting $1.6bn in revenue for the year. I guess it's priced in if the market thinks their sales are going to tank next year and never recover...
I love how you retards just take. Random stab at guessing and are so wrong so often

No retard. 

The session is debating parts of the ACA NOT the ACA itself dumbass. Read more.
I was trading JKS and CSIQ for years.  I got out of JKS bc it wasn’t really moving and made a bunch of money on CSIQ a few months ago and have been sticking with that one.  But JKS ran up faster and now it’s so high I wouldn’t touch it until after it crashed.  I like CSIQ out of all the solars because it has the lowest PE I’ve seen so room for growth.  Chinese companies seem to do a lot better maybe it’s because of government subsides that American companies don’t get maybe bc China is doing shady stuff I’m not sure.   The run up in Sunrun (US) lately was crazy though but that was partly to do with merging with another company.  First solar was the biggest American company for years and it didn’t do much of anything.

I kind of got out of trading for several years and jumped back in this year so I’m not fully up to date.  Germany was going crazy buying solars several years ago but the US has the biggest economy so would be huge if we got big into green energy. I think it’s the energy of future but we are moving so slow for stupid reasons. 

TAN is going to grow but slower I think, so I’ve been focused on individual companies but there’s more risk that way too.
Shit unity couldn't stay up a little more? After yesterday's dump? F
Yep.

Virus is over. 

Going off the last two days, nobody will ever order from Amazon, play video games, or binge Netflix again.
So PFE did nothing in this whole matter? whelp, stonks

Good ol morning rkt dump
1p EST.
First earnings after IPO, had doubled since that IPO so I'm just guessing that the market re-evaluated the company with the additional info. they thought RKT was better than it really was. That's all I can think of
DIE CRUISELINES DIE
Hmmm. TOS has BABA options frozen. 
This may blow up my account boys. 
Today’s going to be an interesting day.
SPY just gonna pump to green in 5 minutes. Aite.
Crsr killed earnings wtf happened
ACB OOPS
Me too man...
Fax
AMC, seriously, stop blowing your load pre-market if you're just going to wallow at $4 all day...

I’m a simple man, NIO goes does i still get excited as I can buy more
NTES CALLS PRINTING
Tech dip has limited downside because people treat AMZN, AAPL, and MSFT like gold. Unless people suddenly change their minds on how valuable these companies are, usually a weak ER, they’re not dropping bigly.

That being said, they’re already valued so highly, they’re having trouble going higher.
RH is down
Gonna hold CCL because y'all are fucking retarded and I've never made money listening to this sub
Congrats
Where were you when CCL was kil
CRSR really fucking my ass rn

Lost potential gains of $800 😓😓
Stop selling BABA he is already dead
I literally don't know how options work, who the greeks are, if I'm a thetasexual, or what qualifies as a Gay Bear. Started following this sub after buying TESLA on its 30% dip when it missed the S&P, and my whopping 4k in "tendies" made this game seem to be a good idea.
It's probably paid for by the Hedge Funds who mine this place for information.
This is why the rich get richer haha

Didn’t they just do one earlier this year, is it rare for a company to do it more than once in a year? But yea given the run up it makes sense..
RKT earnings today boys, Truthers RISE

After trying to decipher this, I envy you.
CRSR best earnings by a lot but volume seems low, $27 resistance. I hope we can break that and see ATH by end of week
HOW WILL NIO EXPAND TO US? WILL US LET NIO BUILD THEIR HUGE GARAGE EVERYWHERE TO CHANGE THEIR CARS BATTERY?

FYI, I am seeing some unusual Charter Spectrum internet outages in Los Angeles and now NYC this morning.

Could be DNS related and cause / be caused by other carriers or mean issues at other services.

Have seen odd ones like Instagram and even Uber having issues this morning, which, is really rare.

Keep it in mind / have trade exit plans ready for stuff like that.
FSR sell or hold?
How do I buy a contract that’s .01 on webull? Limit order are in increments of 5.

Lol the antitrust news that just came out ??
Man I may just buy some NIO shares at this rate
0% chance spy will go below 352 today. Market too strong and joe biden is our president
Yeah now they gotta search for a "real job" now just to stay afloat. Shits depressing.
Cloudflare crashed in the morning, essentially every brokerage app was down

yeah, but NIO is still printing
Really?
Not the same
well it did pump to 50 and then dumped.... Pump and dump operations are still illegal so my guess is they just wanted to save of us all of some legal issues.
Today Red or green?
hope so it pumped all the way fucking back to where it ended yesterday after being down 14$ AH

Anyone buying JETS puts?
Buy puts or calls and make money
Based off prior performance, they will not remain in the sky long.
I own 10 shares of this shit company at 33.70 a share. I almost went full retard and put thousands into them. 

I just want one bounce so I can get my money back but I should probably just salvage what I can at this point.
didn't they just announce another stock offering?
He is the source
In morgan freeman voice: "It didn't"
looool that's rough
Whoever said the TSLA game on puts and calls around the 420 is a fucking genius.

Cannot go tits up

Imaging if he put in 10,000 quarters. He’d be a BILLIONAIRE !!!!
Lol, this is the perfect time to do it. Dropping bags on morons.

However probably a good time to buy when it bottoms in a month or two.
Jacked to the tits with CCL puts let's go babyyyyy

ETSY has enough up-side long-term that buying the stock should be enough. Calls are hit/miss because it’s so volatile.

they really now how to fuck retail fomo chasers

Buy calls at Bottom
Everyone go buy BABA so I can finally get out of this pos stock
The Bible of option trading right here
He is just copy pasting bloomberg terminal
Man CRSR and BABA about to bleed me dry
Because its 1.5% to buy and if you are not retarded you are buying and holding stocks in your TFSA. Selling the stocks within a year can be audited for day trading and then you pay tax which defeats the purpose of using a TFSA. If you hold long enough, maybe wealthsimple will allow USD balances.

Wealthsimple doesnt even have options.
Cuz it's in our heads that we can't touch our IRA's until we retire, so why bother checking now when we still have 150 years left until we can retire.
I dont know why the people who been making money dont talk on here much
AAL and CCL be like “look at all these retards wanting to buy our shares, lets give them more!!!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
NIO bears very triggered rn
I think early Q1 2021
Hell no, just reaching the levels that it always magically gets bought up at.
And this guy constantly posts his tweets like they're press releases.

Honestly hope it reverses for ya man
The stock market
Thanks, this makes a lot of sense. Based on your analysis do you think that international/Chinese companies should outperform in the short term due to uncertainty around the US senate race? And what are your top companies - or do you just play TAN?
Hello darkness my old friend
Absolutely retarded IV bru
I highly doubt you’ll lose on those
NIO
I assume you listened to a stranger on the internets and made the move on [DHI](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/d.r.-horton-dhi-q4-earnings-and-revenues-top-estimates-2020-11-10%3famp)?
Why is RKT such a pos?!?
again - you do you boo boo. I'm here to just make money
It’s winter and world wide lock down
Got damn those are expensive ass calls. I’d buy more
Same for me. I intentionally will not enable options on that account so it stays in my play money account
Probs retail
Here’s my take. They actually don’t want inflation. They want to be able to say they need more inflation and therefore keep the monetary spigots on. If they actually got it, they’d be screwed because that’s how this bubble ends. 

I agree they are going to get it, but that will trap them in a box they created themselves. 

Fight inflation and crash the stock market or let inflation run and crash the dollar.  My guess is they crash the dollar and tell everyone it’s for their own good.

FSR 11/20 17.5C
I'm just slowly adding to my NOK position and it feels so good
It’s an arcade machine, it’s exactly what it looks like, it had a bunch of quarters laying flat inside the machine on the lower shelf, you place a quarter in and depending on where your quarter lands it might have enough leverage to push other quarters off the shelf for you to collect by the constantly moving wall behind it.

Google “arcade quarter pusher game” and you can get more detail and probably a better explanation that that
Idk maybe you wait 7 more mins to find out
Remember to stick to the plan today:  When your options are up, hold out for bigger gains.   Once you're down about 70%, sell at the bottom right before the reversal.
Nïo will rip forever
47 by open lmao
This rotation shift is so short sighted.  Lockdown numero dos will happen on January 21st then it’ll be back to tech stocks.

Someone definitely knew about the ULTA news yesterday. Crazy

By the way, what did you do for that 34 day ban?

Let me guess, you are gonna hold until it tanks
Have a link or more information on this talk?

GANG GANG!

You hate money if you didnt buy NIO
Nobody is buying from AMZN anymore doofus.  We shop at the stores now
This is easily the best post this year
What would you ask for an weekly itm dollar spread? .8 is what I feel okay with. I won't hold them to expiry.
I know most of us gamble here but does anyone routinely invest as well? Do you have any stocks that you build over time? If so what are they?
Why is BABA such a POS? I bought at $285 and thinking about selling.
Anyone have some real degen plays today?
Good luck
I was thinking of a bull trap at open but damn ok i'll take it. today might be bad for vxx calls but if the downtrend continues tomorrow then vix is popping tonight during futures.
nio????
Fair enough I was too pussy but glad I was.. was gonna go all in on Trump 🤡
BYND's chart yesterday is the biggest WTF 1-day chart I think I have ever seen.
Was down big premarket. We usually bull trap back to the lows so I’m hopeful
yeah this would suck big time, market wouldn't care much, though. senate being decided by GA is the only thing that matters, if dems win senate in GA, tech will be taxed to death and green energy will be blocked from existence.
You mean the exact same thing they did before the pandemic when they were ~$40? By your logic this isnt a dip its a correction
I bought Google after ER and it dropped and went into Calls. I got $1710 calls cheap before last week and sold too early

Thanks for that
All my gambling funds are tied up so I was feeling bad about not playing CRSR earnings but seems like that saved me.
I bought zoom and peloton yesterday after getting out of NIO.  Value stocks haven’t outperformed since before the Great Recession.  A one day dip that large in a world dominated by tech is what we call a layup.
Welcome to the market, where earnings don’t matter and PTON is revolutionary
same here, I feel like I'm going crazy
I'm in ACB covered calls.   Already averaged down to just about $4.00 a share, stupid good premium the moment it goes up.  


Buy to close a day or so after. Rinse repeat.
[deleted]
Did some quick TA during coffee break, SPY should close above 365.
Did NIO stop?
Probably QCOM calls
COTY best 💄
I don't think that the % symbol should be in the power, but what do I know?

BABA struggling
[deleted]
imma need to see that tech rotation again
Sell small caps or your IWM calls and switch over to QQQ calls today ppl!!!!
Bought BABA at 297, at what price would you recommend that I average down?
I remember in the past lots of EDM artists used to complain a lot about airline companies being horrible, which ones they were talking about?
Pretty much.  You can get lucky OTM but it happens very rarely and most often you will lose those bets.
Bears are out in full force today, I’m closing Reddit till it’s bigly green.
GRWG earnings?
buying BABA here. no brainer
Will you pussys stop selling CRSR every time it goes up
fucking cruise liners! they were and always will be horse shit! 

The only thing they have going is they are never registered in America / Europe so can tread their staff like slaves, so thats something possitive.
ZM about to be +10%. Oversold
Why do you hate me so much Apple, just go to 125 for a day.

You selling these? Mind selling a few more for $0.05? I'll buy 50

Everyone...you should be panicking
A lot of comments this morning saying we’re rotating out of tech, the bubble has finally burst, correction is here etc etc. What are you actually buying then - short term and long term? Not being facetious, I’m legit curious of your positions.

Should have dumped my CCL and NCLH shares yesterday rather than selling CCs on them 🙄🙄🙄
Very true. I just didn't want to miss the first leg of the movment. The premium will shoot tf up once AMZN crosses 3150. Thats a good expiry in my opinion as well.
Same here, and that prediction is just me talking out of my ass
Because WSB shorted it thinking it'd drop below 400 lmao
Sitting on puts on America ready to sell most and sit cash. No feel yet where this dip goes
PLTR on behalf of Pfizer, leveraging Tiberius.

Nah, in the long term weed will be legal. It’s just when. Make take a few years.🙂
Nice.
The Solar run-up was due to predictions that democrats would win the presidency, senate, and house and there being a huge green energy and infrastructure jobs package to help the economy and get back to work as well as removing the tax breaks that have been given to fossil fuel companies making it a significantly better market to be in green energy.  All the polls were saying something like 70% chances of this happening.  Democrats won 2 out of the 3.  The polls were off pretty big so senate didn’t happen.  

It’s doubtful that a republican led senate is going to want to enact green energy jobs as they deny that climate change is a real problem because they receive so much money from coal, oil, and gas companies to hold that position. The republicans leaders also bashed the green new deal to death by saying democrats want to ban meat and planes.  Which was a joke someone put out but it was a good way to distort the plan and demonize the other political party so republicans jumped on it and now that’s what their voters believe whether it’s true or not.  

While Biden put forth a climate change plan I’m unsure how much that a democratic President can do through executive orders without a democrat controlled senate to pass laws and make money available for these plans.  There is a small chance that the two parties can negotiate something between them but it’s doubtful as republican media operation has demonized working with the democrats as being weak for years.  There is a even smaller chance that democrats take control of the senate in January if they win both the 2 senate seats up for election in Georgia but historically democrat voters don’t vote in elections other then presidential election so that would be a low probability chance in my opinion.  

The Solar energy industry has become more cost effective over the years due to [reduction in cost](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a34372005/solar-cheapest-energy-ever/) to make solar so it can make it on its own without law changes in a climate energy platform the issue is that it requires a big upfront investment to install it and the benefits take years to see on the backend.  They have financing available to do it where you pay it back in payments like your power bill or a mortgage but it’s more economical in places that get more sun and or having batteries installed to store power for use later which is still in it’s infancy.  Several US CEO’s and democratic controlled cities and states have come out and said they are moving companies and areas into greener technologies but it’s moving in small steps without a national plan. 

Most of the rest of the developed world on the other hand doesn’t have the anti science/ climate change philosophy of the United States so other developed countries are enacting climate change plans leading to significant growth overseas.


TLDR - the run-up in green energy was due to assumptions that democrats would control the government.  It didn’t happen so it maybe in for a pullback or maybe solar can keep going without law changes due to democratic led presidency or the rest of the world picking up the US slack. I wouldn’t expect a huge continuous run-up anymore though. Although I’ve been trading solar for years and it seems to be very volatile with huge ups and downs so hard to say.

Nope. Everything is context. The incentive is there to save these companies now as a "fix" is seen as being around the corner; as the summer showed, there will be enormous pent up demand in the coming months. A lot of superb value out there even after yesterday. Just compare summer prices -> now on a lot of these travel stocks. They have a lot of room.
There will be blood!
Nah he thinks he can tie the process up like everything else with lawsuits. They are going to throw him out like that bitch on hoarders.

This happens every month.  Any rally in boomer stocks, CNBC and the /r/investing crowd try to get bag holders to come in for them.  Real talk: those stocks haven’t beaten tech since before the Great Recession.  They won’t come out of this one flying high.

If a tech company ever buys a boomer company I would reconsider.

I need nio to carry my portfolio today

Oh fuck, we're going limparkets flatlining all week!
Looks like green by open lol
Yessssss thank god. He is answering my prayers
Patience.
Bro I'm just as confused as you. Beat earnings by 100% and it goes down. 

SMDH
That's a general guideline and if you're not from a socioeconomically disadvantaged household then you should be above it. For example, if your family didn't have money to send you to college and you had to work in high school, then it probably takes you longer to earn 50k. Most people in their late 20s still have student loan and probably a car loan that's outside of their budget. 

Now let's talk about me. I am 29 and I had about $50k saved up that I yolo'd in May and lost it all. I tricked my dad into putting money into his IRA for the past 5 years and I invested the shit out of those in absolutely out of the ballpark YOLO plays and now I'm at 350k. If you ain't doing this kind of shit then you doing it wrong. This is the way and I have spoken
I am holding a bunch but fuck this shit might turn positive
No, BYND had a shit earnings call. McDonald’s isn’t the only reason
Just let them get called away
He has been real quiet the whole term. Almost like he is embarrassed...

Tell the truth, do you understand what you just said?
TD is a Canadian company.  Being from Canada I know 3 things about Canadian companies:

1.	The service or product they provide will be overpriced.
2.	The quality of the service or product will be subpar.
3.	To avoid them whenever possible.

And everyday for the past 7 months.  Predicting something else would be refreshing.
We are self aware retards.  People tend to appreciate retards who know their limitations, but try anyways.
me i doubled down on amazon lol
Lemon juice
Get your wife’s boyfriend to spit on it.
You should have seen what happened to covid stocks yesterday. I think I lost 10 years of lifespan.

Wrong size.

Wrong bet.
Try not wiping your ass with your bear hands then rubbing it in your eyes.

vix ded
35ish. I've got a good job and im paying it off quickly as is but 20 grand would've been a nice fast forward.
🤣🤣🤣 Thanks for the laugh man. Sorry about the bootypipe
You know it is
Tech puts to hedge “value” longs was such an obvious play.

Now I’m having both going my way. Too easy
It's not a bad stock to bag hold if you have to.
I’d say take profits
Greedy this is the way
Haha bears cucked
Who else made some stupid calls at the end of the day?
Baba set to rip my asshole open
McPlant is BYND (or probably will be); McD doesn't make any of the underlying, just sells the finished product.
Did Etsy also announce Beyonce collab?
You can't fucking script this shit. 

This has got to be some sick jock. Let's wait and see what happens at the OB.
Ok hear me out Beyoncé and Elon should get married
TDAMERITRADE had “sell nothing for 3 hours while you lose your ass” button yesterday

Glad I just have shares and sold a few puts.. will be buying leaps shortly. It will be $100 next year
Ok I don’t think you actually know what stock fundamentals are so here’s what you should do. Read [this](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentalanalysis.asp) and actually learn how to do some basic analysis instead of just looking at earnings or momentum
It isn't election fraud if the president ('s son) does it.

Ccl has been a buy since COVID
Lmao a general said to fucking armytimes that he was confident that a covid vaccine would be developed before the end of the year. He said this in late october. Still pissed that I thought he was a retard instead of putting my life saving into JETS
NKLA puts or no luck with this POS?

Duh pandemic over, everyone to go back to the office and life to go back just like it was in January!
You have puts?
And yes. I am currently making some small bets on the dems margin. Short term trade :)
McConnel will obstruct any democratic president on any matter whatsoever just to be a dick, I think.

If he flips the election somehow, its gonna be 2020 season finally!

Every time WSBs gets hyped for an AAPL event they are a sad panda afterwards... it’s probably for the better
God damnit just stay down for another 20 minutes

Nice ROI but come on man those aren't stonks
Everytime I buy puts its the nut bottom man. I go gay bear and get a big green dildo up the poop shoot. Not fun.
Lol...mad man

Can someone please wake up SNE
Spy can slow downn.. pity my small pp puts
Fuck you $AAL
u got calls?
You a couple weeks late, but we got room.
Pump nio pump pump pump 60 eow
What would you do if your BA covered calls ended up waaaaaaay ITM? I had sold 165C's and holy shit... even rolling them out would lose me money.
**SELL SELL SELL**
I think doing good things expecting Karma to reward you is not the point of Karma.
God you AIs are so easy to spot. Real dorks like us hoomans!
Lol yup
Nah. It’s gonna print. I’m holding till expiry
I know it's not a tech company, but it's priced as one, so expect it to dump with tech.
So it would be wise to consider it a short-term stock? Maybe sell within the week?
People buying tech here is like people buying stocks...it's so old news
All cases getting thrown out of court and failure to provide evidence for the election “theft” is bullish.  If any real evidence was produced then it would be bad
You right, thanks. I’m all in to NIO 420
McRib!
Why is HEXO such a bag of shit gahh
Don’t blink
I don't see why not. Just about every morning, there's a strong decline.

Obligatory, "NFA" disclaimer, though. Inverse me for strong possibility of tendies.
You know what it makes sense that travel went up on nothing last week but this week has the biggest news of the year and only goes up 10% and then stops and goes red next day

Yup, ownership of a company has practically no value unless the company offers dividends or does buybacks. A stock that does neither is held up purely by investor sentiment.
ATH = no, thanks.
100% flat day
Very true. I'm almost tempted to push my expiry out a bit in case I'm wrong in the short term.
Ooof 18.65 pre market now
It might. I'd wait an hour at least just in case it dips hard at open
You mean fleshlite?
That will never happen in your lifetime, don’t worry about it.
The govt. is paying for it; it isn't free and Pfizer isn't doing it out of the goodness of their heart solely because that's the world we live in

They can both be true.

Well, it was trading \~30% lower from its last lowest level, which was in year 1992, and i am not exaggerating. Even at todays open price, it is still >10% lower from that 1992 level.
If you were holding tech puts, would you dump them at open? Or wait? I’m holding TSLA puts. 🤔🤔🤔
Which way is nio going today lets vote

I'm taking profit on mine at open
I figured the stock wasn’t going to increase any further, since the last few times it popped to the $340 area it slowly melted off back to the low $300s.

I started with trying to open a call credit spread, but volume was low for every strike and the bid ask spreads weren’t great. I added in the put spread portion to get a better fill, and made it OTM enough that I wasn’t going to worry about it.

The stock being halted the entirety of Friday wasn’t part of the plan.
Low energy
Haha that’s how I’ve been doing it so far too.. but I feel like longterm that might not go well

You’ll only be able to sell open positions today.

I just sell options on the companies that would not go bankrupt, not meme shit like GME, BYND, and HYLN.
the people that sat out during the elections would have the opportunity to buy now
Soon to be former small business owner here. My restaurant is getting wiped out by this and it sucks but I totally agree about money being wasted. It would have been much cheaper for the government and better for my employees and myself to have shut down months ago. Spinning my wheels since getting PPP and all that has made little sense but that was the only real option.
Honestly I have faith in BYND long term and this seems too good to pass up

Oh that wasn’t me buddy, I was just chiming in to share how difficult it is to get it at retail. 

Again the difference between the rolex and a high end jeep is that the jeep probably does not have a 1-2 year waitlist or an insane instant arbitrage you can realise on the spot.
Why not? They all smashed earnings by miles.

u can sell only
Fundamentals don’t support tech evaluations that’s the problem dummy
Everybody wants a recovery. So just do it!!!
Yeah definitely. I messed up not selling a call I bought on zoom at yesterday’s low, just watched it go to 60% and didn’t want to use a day trade and now I’m down 60%, likely 80% at open. I’m thinking about cashing them all out at open and rolling them out to a lower strike. Don’t want to be bag holding my yolo haha.

Thanks for the advice man, hope we crash big.
Got 8 24.5c do I sell or buckle up for the moon?

Why is tech down?

*checks symptoms*

“Pfizer’s COVID vaccine side-effects include the inability to use the internet” - Harvard or some shit

Makes sense
The market can’t deny fundamentals forever, tech should be +10% from where it is and this vaccine bear news won’t last long.
Pretty sure you just can’t day trade anymore but u can buy and sell so long as it’s not dts.

You can day trade again in 90 days.

Yes

Big if true
LOL. Market opens up in 30 mins.

It got dragged down with nasdaq yesterday but should gap up today. Let's see.
Y’all fuckers really did the whole verse!! Person after person!! 😂😂😂
This guy knows what he's talking about.
I hope not because I have FD’s but I guess it eez what it eez
Yep I think so too.
It's because PFE is a massive company that does and makes like 50 billion things, so their vaccine division getting a massive win will have a smaller % effect on their revenue


Use ur head dummy
NTES calls are de way
Woah I’m actually 100% agreeing with Cramer lol

TLDR: moves yesterday were exaggerating and tech isn’t going anywhere
JETS $15P Jan 21? 🤔
If you have tech leaps, just sit out today
It’s headed down over the next couple weeks but not that fast
Are you saying you have far more or far less?
Travel going red!
Governments can then blow off this whole lockdown bullshit without losing face. That's the real kicker.
But they can’t. That’s the whole reason this company is mocked as a big scam. And to the embarrassment of GM, they got conned for a pretty nice penny.
So you made money for once?

Take gains dude.  Don't over leverage.  Make smaller plays and make gains.  You'll be able to sleep at night.  No you're not making 3 K in a day, but making consistent $300 plays adds up.  Kangaroo market is wiping everyone out right now.  Bulls and bears.
The volatility is retarded high right now, you’re probably gonna get fucked.

Yes, and then at some point it will go up.

He’s correct

Seriously, even toddlers know how to navigate on an iPad to get a movie to play. Tech is ingrained and pervasive.

it's resting up before the mOoN MiSsIoN
Spy dump today too? All in on puts and kinda nervous
Again, I appreciate the broader approach you have to other products, but OP was specifically referring to Rolexes. 

Most people who are disagreeing with you right now are probably in the market for one and are perfectly aware of the conditions.

Agreed. I have a bunch of call calendar spreads open and the short legs completely wiped out all my gains. I have 20+ positions open and finished the day almost exactly flat. Completely missed the pump of the year fuck me.
Wait for opening sell off and dump it if you can’t afford to lose it all. Otherwise hang around and pray for a crash
Sounds like a good old case of overwhelming hubris

Vaccine is also only 90% effective compared to control 7 days after the second dose in the context of wearing masks and social distancing.    Distribution aside, even with the vaccine I'm doubtful things are going to go back to "normal" within the next year or two.

It's not necessarily proven to be 90% effective in the context of I was directly exposed to the virus and now I only have a 10% chance of getting covid.  This is only inferred by limited data.  It's also unclear how long the protection will last.  This result is only 7 days after getting the final dose and only account for less than 100 people getting covid out of the approximately 50k involved.

Another distribution issue I read is that this has to be stored at minus 80C which is a special type of freezer which makes mass production and storage harder compared to something that can just be put in a normal freezer or kept refrigerated.

Because the vaccine is still months away from being fda approved. Not gonna have nearly enough vaccines available and then the whole convincing Americans to take it. We’re not opening up any time soon tech is the way.
Wondering the same thing myself....I hope so!

Legit considering doubleing down on a losing position
Fox made 🥭, anyone thinking that relationship was anything other is well  a fool. They read the tea leaves and understand they have to reposition after the fact. The reality is they value the status quo as much as anyone.
Reminder NIO opened 42.5 yesterday and around 31 a week prior. 

50+ next Monday.
Back then the Dollar was backed by gold, not by 43 aircraft carriers.
I mean... I just called on nio myself. Yeah everything seems fishy but there really isn't any reason why the stock won't keep climbing. Plus its 400 bucks. Who cares?
If 10 minutes before the bell u are super happy from the results, just sell
Thanks. I guess I'm just struggling to see what advantage it has over it's competition even with another year of WFH. 500 seemed high even when the end of the pandemic wasn't in sight. Now it's just feels like the only way is down. Some calls as a short term hedge might be a good idea though I bet IV is crazy rn
Hey congrats, you doubled my loss. Now you just gotta go to loss section and find people worse off to make yourself feel better
I can see it. 

Plus, I can afford those options at the moment haha.
GBP?

Gay Bear Points? 

What is this nonsense
1/15 165c
3/19 165c
3/19 170c
It’s the amount of shares that are freely traded on the open market. Smaller the float, easier it is for the stock to move up. CRSR has a float of around 17 million, which is very small compared to others in the field.
1/15 165c
3/19 165c

I mean they are a biotech firm with the full support of the United States federal government behind them and the first proven COVID vaccine so I say sell.

This is specifically a Rolex thing. They discourage negotiations, but you can at places like breitling. However, yes, it does depend on the model and current demand. If my dealership had the only specific color dodge demon in Ohio, you were definitely paying up to 40k over sticker.

In every bigger city. Search for a shop which sells pre owned watches and ask for Rolexes with papers. Do your research (store needs reputation) before to not get ripped off. Really, be carefull. There is no such thing as "good deal" for Rolexes.
Put your positions in the post.  2 minutes.
Tell them about NIO and BABA and watch them doubt a foreign country
I can tell her for you
Not dead. I'm still making plenty off covered calls and puts while waiting for potential squeeze.

Next opportunity for squeeze is probably ER in early December.

The main reason this hasn't squeezed yet is the size of the shorts. They have had no trouble dumping price when desired. And there's clearly no desire to blow this up yet from the big longs for a lot of reasons.

It's been very profitable for me so far because of the short interest and relative predictability of the price action week to week.
PLUG. If you’re into EVs there’s no reason not to buy into PLUG, I think they blow past $45 next year, been in since $5.50 and sitting on $7 1/21 calls
Buy SNE for PS5 hype now on this dip and hold for earnings blowout?
Just dropping in to say thank you! Outstanding call, much profits!
they actually hold their value, and in a lot of cases appreciate in value, so not really pissing money away ;)
Why is this sub still so insanely bullish on tech? Honest question.

Got automodded so re-re-replying just in case 

My big plays rn, $BEEM (bought when it was EVSI @$11 still a lot of play); M O G O ($1.8 currently going HAM rn); K L R (Euro $TWLO clone @ $6.8 not really sure how this will play but looks like a good takeover candidate. Google a client as well as others); and just yesterday bought P R T S (rebranded earlier this year to car parts.com. good SEO move imo. $500M market cap, $300M in sales, 25% short interest. Has markings of going POP soon imo).  I invest my entire family's accounts and have put close to $100k into each of the ideas I wrote above. 

I'll let you know other plays I have brewing. One thesis I had that I'm kind of mad I didn't play was $TIF at the beginning of the when fight with $LVMH. It was like $105 or so when the takeover price was $135. Could've scalped $15-$20 per share with close to 100% certainty IMO. LV had no argument. 

Anyway man, if you would like to become will farrell to my john C reilly and become step Bros/new best friends, I would gladly make bunk beds with you.

We started an investment fund run by students in college, but our bylaws were pretty strict. Could only buy shares, had to be traded on American exchange, minimum market cap, below certain level of leverage, two faculty had to approve each trade, etc. This was around 2010 so everyone was still feeling the 2008-2009 crash. We obliterated the University's endowment fund returns every year. Which wasn't saying a ton, since it was managed by the incompetent boobs at TIAA-cref.  

Had a lot of fun and learned a lot. Definitely recommend joining a student fund for anyone who has the opportunity.

Jesus. Suck shit with these ridiculous fucking posts. Go back to DnD or whatever sub you came from.
Holdn't not
Well, I don't know your situation. But in such a highly volatile market, profit taking to some extent is wise. Maybe take out some %? Like cash out 25-50% or have a cash out plan that's not all at 200%.

I'm loaded up on puts. I'm selling some at open regardless. I'll carry some to see what happens today because I still think tech has room to fall, but 4% in a day or two is a lot.
Meaning?
I think I’m going to do ~22.50 which is close to a 5% run. Thanks for confirmation.
Just buy at 3000 and sell at 3200.
I bought the dip yesterday. I know, I know. I'm a genius.

Options don't show the right values until 9:30 even more losses :D  around -82% on my PFE calls I bought at open.
March 330 here. Feels pretty dead inside

Never. 120 if you're brave.
and you’re not jealous of that?? imagine being that old and just yolo and follow algos
Just common stock shares at 290, holding long term. I don’t trust calls atm but I do see significant growth between their attempts to corner the luxury market, and the eventual ANT IPO

Inversing your inverse may the best man win
You should've bought puts for the ones you bought calls for and calls for the ones you bought puts for.


Buy my ebook
Yes, for most people who wants subs and GMTs they have no other choice to pay resell. I mean you can get a Date Just or Day Date and probably not wait, however, you’re not going to sell it for a profit.
September was ATH for tech, its only going to be down from here.

On the plus side you can cash out on dead cat bounces along the way
Hey co-workers, Anyone else ready to watch some lines?

Big facts
A friend of mine wanted to be that when he got a real job, and was asking me for a 100 here and there for him to "manage" and turn over several times around.  

He bought Kroger calls with it right before earnings lol

Fair point.

Thoughts on RXT earnings play today?
No I bought puts when it was 362 and sold them at EOD for almost 100% gains. Those would be around 300% this morning. Bought calls at last second EOD.

I’m not saying it wasn’t stupid, and especially since I’ve been bearish and this is the first time I’ve done it. But this clown market has done it before so it’s not unreasonable
Is RKT tech or bank? I’m buying that
dont give me hope
Yes thank you. I trade for this reason. I get it all of 2019-2020 we seen prices go parabolic and that’s cool. Eventually you hit a point though where everything is priced in and big funds pullout. It’s been happening with Apple since September. I’ve watched large block orders come from one trade in the millions to the sell side for months. Apples been barely affected which it can’t be because it’s 1/30th of the whole market. Insiders are selling though funds are selling this sub is gonna be left holding those bags.
But but but they have virtual classes that offer encouragement!
this is why I lurk
BABA 290 heading into singles day is a steal, this has been at 300 + and beat earnings.

Yeeeeeah that's not how that works.
this runup has been so weak, there will probably be a small pop after earnings

but don't expect much
Really fat right tail in PLTR. The $15/25 spread for Feb/Mar/Nov21 are all looking really solid. Nov21 is $2.40 risk for a max gain $10
Interesting
Nobody knows the future, but I guess, BABA may add another $100. But nearest year can be highly volatile.

Yeah, so just buy used. I’d recommend paying resell on a Sub or a GMT if getting a Rolex. The only way to get a round a waiting list for a Sub or GMT is to buy more watches from that store showing that you’re a serious enthusiast.

WSB avg volume always down after tech pulls back .5%
Lol just facts bro. The calls had strike prices of 650-700
Rolexes are very high in demand and they produce less than they could. They call it the waiting list but it's just the polite way to tell the customer to gtfo. To get a desirable model you need to buy  other shit from the store which you don't want or alot of luck. Grey Market sells above list price but in the end it can be cheaper. Or don't buy one at all.

Shouldn’t it theoretically lose all the gains it got from the lockdown ?
Isn’t IV kinda high on those
I just checked. Only up 70% of that 5k now. Which is great but my spreads were all still screwed. Still a little ways off of what I lost from the last green week.

Any advice?

It was on 12% for a few minutes but anyways, im good as long is it doesn't drop in price today. I'm long on CRSR with shares so i dont need/expect it to double by next week, it just sucks that we KNOW that if Pfizer didn't release that bs vaccine pump then tech stocks would have soared and CRSR would pump twice as hard. 

But anyways, as long as the earnings report is good, i can sleep in peace. The stock will go up, even if it takes time.
Well im down 89% since yesterday so i rather hope for a runup
I need to see 🩸
Hi uncle it’s me

It is dividends. That's the main answer. The reality is than even high P/E stock prices can be justified by future growth increasing dividends. Shareholders may accept to forego dividends in case they believe the company has high return investments at their disposal. So if the company has projects with a higher IRR than the implicit "cost of equity", shareholders will want the company to not distribute dividends and instead use the money to finance such project (the alternative to shareholders would be to get the dividends and reinvest).

This is the fundamentalist approach.

The alternative is treating stocks as assets whose price go up. If you have this mentality then you accept the greater fool explanation.

The reality is that stocks DO pay dividends, and per example, if they distribute all their net income as dividends, and they have a 15x P/E, this means their dividend yield should be 6.67%.

If you have a stock that pays 0.05% dividends, the price can only be justified through growth (you can calculate the implicit growth on the stock price). If the growth does not make sense... Then you found and over priced stock, or symptoms of a bubble.

Never use P/E or div yield as your only guide for investing, but there's logic behind them and they shouldn't be ignored.
Nope
All of tech is getting blasted right now

lmao they can hold these Ls
After it already peaked yesterday?
Very little cause i only started investing mid August. Before that I was just saving money for 3 years that Ive been working (around 100k€) but never invested before. So a little after I started buying, there was the September correction and then these past two months have been quite difficult. Plus I bought AAPL near its top (130$) and only DCA’d to around 122$.
They are 2023, so by then something good HAS to happen

Why is GM still stringing them along? Are they trying to do a favor for someone?

Is it possible they are waiting until the holds on Milton's (and other employee's) options are gone so he and his employees can cash out before the rug is pulled out and the company goes under?

I've seen some of the Nikola fan boys say "GM is just a contractor producing their awesome technology" while ignoring the Hindenburg report - one of the main points of which was that Nikola doesn't actually have any technology. It's all made up.

I can't believe this isn't a penny stock yet.

Depends what model.  Any new sport model you’re paying MSRP or higher.  Precious metal or diamond you might be able to negotiate something.  Rolex margin is 37% on most models, just FYI.  Problem is there’s a major demand and major shortage though so most aren’t negotiating.

You think it’s just up forever on BA? I bought calls at the peak yesterday and it hurts

Edit: turns out this (and selling half my Tesla) was the only smart thing I did yesterday
Ice to buy puts

Water to buy calls

Pre-pandemic it was at 100 and valued for growth. So I'd say maybe 100.
I never liked Aesop Rock but for some reason always like Del.. which is strange cause it’s essentially the exact same shit.
More importantly defund those that use it as a prime index “tHe DoW wEnT uP 2000 pOiNtS tOdAy”
Is today the day to get back in to tech, or wait longer?
lol you also don't pump the VIX like that.  You do it by spreading your legs wider
Fuck you Pfizer
when people realize the shit in there is actually way worse for you and the environment than just eating fucking cow

This how you get the big bucks boi. Ride it down then load up on calls between 2950-3000.
I had a big pile of AMC fd's that expired on Friday.  It hurt my soul to see what happened to them yesterday.
You could say that and be wrong.
Correction, flaccid cock.
Yeah I like making (losing) money but no way am I buying shit like GE, F, or KO

Could’ve just jumped on short term plays and made money even if you believe this.

Portafolio? As in portapotty? 🚽
Sold my 1/15/21 GE $10c yesterday for 116% profit. My $12s are still in the red though.
Trap and WSB was not really something I expected to intersect but, I am also unsurprised due to both circles having a drug affinity overlap
I’ve got a jan22 SPG call that’s up $342 thanks to yesterday’s bump. Wondering if malls are really going to be dead soon and I should get out of SPG while I have a chance.
Could always do spreads.. buy 10% otm call sell 5% otm call
Because it sucks

caught the BYND falling knife yday after ER and bought 200 shares at 121 just to see it fall as low as 106. sold premarket at 123.50. good lord!
Right ? Holding $305c for 1/15
Look at the 10 day chart and you see it moving between 280 and 300+ in a matter of a day.
Why
Calls on DKNG into earnings????
For the first time ever i ordered something and it was in my hand within 18 hours of ordering it, insane
My brother in law sits in my basement all day doing nothing and he's never made me a penny
Rkt could go over 22 before earnings. As far as after ? Who the fuck knows
😂
SPHD is pretty dope tbh. 

Might throw $60k in to get decent yolo income

Sold off at end of day yesterday.

losing 7800 bux doesnt seem so bad now... thanks man!
Look at the 10 day chart. Judge for yourself. I’m not sure it’s going to whack back past 300 but it’s been swinging between the 280 to 300 range now for a week. If it breaks out and goes lower than that, it’s going to hurt my portfolio, but I’m not selling at open, as it’s so volatile, it can jump ten plus points in a day.

Looks at portafolio, all long calls and short puts in tech...

Do you even dow bro
I mean it’s definitely true it just depends on if it can be pulled off
And futures were down last night. But you still gonna get fuk
Lol
Thanks for your sacrifice
Puts on regional banks because they went up like 10,000% yesterday
nah but its not a sexy pick for short term calls, so its not gonna gain traction here.
Is that rap slang or something?
Maybe because it went up 8% yesterday and there are people holding since before the upgrade
Nice!

They really need to stop these medical companies from announcing potential vaccines. Either you have it or you don't. These announcements are no different than pump and dump schemes. BioNTech had their earnings today and did not do well.. but because they made this announcement, they hyped up their stock right before their earnings report and now it is up.
I was the same and then I began to secure profits no matter what at a certain amount, Some gain is better than waiting for all your gains to disappear

PTON to the dirt.  Vaccine means gyms are going to open and now everyone has a $2000 clothes hanger.  Have fun with your future penny stock.
JUMIA UPDATE: I’m holding my puts for the next couple of days at least. Expecting sector rotation out of tech to continue, which is very good for puts because last earnings they didn’t coincide with tech selloff. This dump could be sharper for those reasons.

Plus, put volume is higher than last time, which means the longer they are held, the lower the stock goes because market makers have to hedge the puts they sell by shorting the stock (they aren’t subject to any short sale regulations)

So, I have had 100 shares of BYND at 118.50, for 7 months now. I didn't even fucking sell when it was 170, jesus fucking christ I am retarded. Literally 7 months of capitol gone in the shitter. I am so pissed.
BABA black sheep have you any gains?

No sir, no sir, just empty bags
100%
i need rkt to take me to the moon
Anyone else thinking of piling into BYND?
Agreed, but set your SLs so as not to catch a falling knife.
All in on zoom bc no valid reason for a drop. We have 6-12 more months of quarantine...most people aren’t going to take the vac anyway and remain working from home. Employee choice in most cases. I know what my answer is..thus zoom $600 soon
I think we woke it up.
Lets not pretend like NIO ain't gonna pump another 6% today like it has every single day. Don't sell, pussies
On one hand my AMD call is dead but on the other my NVDA put is printing so I guess I take that?

Narrator: "But RKT remained a lil bitch"
Puts on that bitch
 

Iv'e had puts on BYND  meat for a while now but I'm no averse to kicking a dog company while  its on the mat and down 20+% with more to go. 70$ by next week  hopefully!!! 

BYND Meat short thesis summary:

The company is in a low margin industry with competition from much   larger players rapidly increasing. The product sector is over saturated   with similar offerings all competing for the same consumer. This is one   reason why their margins are decreasing - see SEC quarterly report.  The  company has little prospect of larger deals now as McDonalds is now   selling the McPlant independently - see recent news articles. If you   read my previous posts you will see that I said that this is exactly   what they would do - develop their own product without the need to pay   BYND.

Beyond Meat is losing money ( has negative  income ) and is also  increasingly cash flow negative (it is losing money  in its everyday  operations at a incerasing rate). It's revenue growth -  the only hope  that supporters have - is clearly slowing down quarter on  quarter - see  recent quarterly reports. This is nothing short of a  complete disaster  for a company that share price has 'priced-in'  accelerating and not  decelerating revenue growth. Remember that the  company is not  sustainable in terms of its operating income at current  low revenues -  it likely can't make a consistent profit if revenues do  not  dramatically increase to achieve higher net margins and economies of   scale.

Its debt is slowly increasing and has cash  of around $215m as of its  most recent filing. In order to remain  competitive it will need to  invest in factories (to reach sustainable  economies of scale) and 215$  million is not nearly enough to do so. It  will be forced to do a  capital raise at some point  and dilute  shareholders further - it can't  invest in revenue growth and production  capacity without doing so . At  the same time it will need to continue to  burn cash in cost of goods  sold - namely advertising and marketing  expenses. Look at the reports -  the hype the product has costs a lot of  money to maintain. Some argue  the product hype around the Beyond Burger  is the only advantage the  product has. 

I could go  on and say that the impossible burger is more favoured in  taste by  consumers and has better financing behind it in terms of  investors like  Bill Gates and so on. Or I could mention that Lab Meat  is a serious long  term threat to beyond as it actually tastes like meat  (it basically is  synthetic meat) and Lab based meat companies have  just listed on the  stock exchange (an Israeli company) and they a  combination of Plant and  Lab based meat will likely be the future of  real meat alternatives  anyway. But honestly if you have read up to here  and you are still  considering holding BYND meat after today's awful  news then I seriously  doubt you are thinking clearly and nothing will  convince you not to buy  this horrible company. You probably bought  Nikola and are still hoping  to get your money back on that. For your  own sake stop being so naive.
I was promised stocks would go up 200% every year

Hold it upside down then it will look better

This market makes me physically sick. I just cannot win no matter what I do. Every move is wrong. I can be up bigly then look away for an hour and somehow be red. If you’re making money here, ngl, I hate you

How about giving us some actual evidence where valuations matter? Trends and momentum trading works. Don't confuse that with the degenerative option trading here, but if you want to talk about TA and make less than VOO returns then go to r/investing

fam dafuq is wrong with tech fr
Yes. Have you been to a Macy’s or Nordstrom? They sometimes have ulta inside their stores.
It’s not that they’re bad it’s that the phone is fucking gigantic and the camera improvements are entirely hype, and that’s the part that annoys me. This release lineup seemed really weird to me with the exception of the mini. Like they had nothing to add but new colors, “medical grade steel” edges and camera mumbo jumbo that 99% of users don’t care about. And to top it all off the fucking thing doesn’t even come with a proper charger and it’s being touted as a feature. I think apples best days are most definitely behind them. Don’t get me wrong the camera and processor work is a modern marvel of engineering but I think their phones have entered the territory where they’re just dicing up and rearranging the same features

> in bush v gore, florida had a margin of only 530 votes

Also it came down to one state and these 530 votes deciding the election. The popular vote difference was just half a million as well.

Even flipping Pennsivenia and Georiga isn't enough to get 270 votes for this 🤡, he'd still need another state on top. Predict it odds are 15% so apparently 15% put down money on a coup and seriously believe we'll have an American dictator next year.

Got caught being greedy yesterday, and wound up down 25% from my top of the day. Probably will now be 50% down at open on BABAy weeklies and HD earnings Nov 20c’s 

But in good news, I left an expensive piece of tech equipment sitting at a job, and thankfully no one stole it, picked it up yesterday evening with no issues. So maybe things are turning around today.

Because media outlets are there to make money, and they're also protected even if they spread false or misleading news. In an effort to get news out the quickest OR to attract a specific demographic to their site/channels, they will publish results that align with their target audience.

I'm not political either way, but Fox sensed a shift, and in order to try to reclaim "credibility" under what they saw was going to be a very left heavy administration, they've been aligning more left wing. The debates and their electoral predictions were very anti-trump which is surprising given how blindly they follow him.

That being said, it's all about the money and if something is not technically illegal, then it's on the table.
RKT MOONING TODAY
For today? Well weed puts are easy money but I called that yesterday. Idk if it’s a good buy today but the weed sector is going to eat shit as usual without the Biden hype. All earnings reports so far were shit as usual. Check my NIO post if you want something you can still make a play on

I'm 2k FD calls in from yesterday.
Can someone that isnt retarded take a look at SVC earnings and tell me if they are a good boomer stock to buy leaps? 

They seem to be holding strong, abd its trading for 1/3 of its pre-covid value
> Pfizer news came without any warning.

That's not true I think they publicly came out before the election and said the results will be there after election. However many vaccine studies had incidents so the results could have been disastrous as well.
Never seen it before so consistently
drop back until next earnings
11/13  15$ and 16$ calls
sounds like u got AIDS
Cash secured puts is the smartest play right now.

**LETS FUCKING GOOOO**
Does buying NIO offset all the other bad decisions I made yesterday? Asking for a friend
offset by your spce puts
I'm guessing it's cause people staying home quarantining up's the demand for MSFT products so now that "covid is over woohoo" it hurt them

But then again I'm 75% sure I'm just looking for rationale where there shouldn't be fucking any
NIO just don't stop.
Was hoping for a LOGI type move
I have been on the NIO rocket ship for 8 months. Every day is practically a new ATH unless one of my other bad picks drags it down hard
The 2000 election hinged on Florida and 1000 votes, not four states in which one candidate is down by more than 10,000 votes in all of them
You take that back
I have a 12/18 35c! This should easily surpass $30 today if not more, they had a great EA
Chipotle chicken is fucking rubbery garbage. Disgustang
how do u decide how much to sell a put for. thinkin about sellin some cash secured puts.
So you're saying... When JP Morgan issues the above statement (yesterday) along with an UPGRADE it's the top? 

LMAO !!! 

NIO $100+ EOW.
Wait so someone got an serious adverse reaction from a vaccine in Brazil and they won't say what it was? That means they died...

I’d like ARM to work but I bought (and returned) a Surface Pro X because it was incompatible with everything and didn’t offer much beyond slightly better battery life.
NIO to $47 today
I’m talking about long term yields (aka steepening of yield curve) which shifts mostly due to inflationary expectations not the fed funds rate. Fed could keep buying bonds and try to artificially prop it up but they’ll run out of ammo, plus they’re gonna slow down after stimulus anyways —> they want inflation and they’re gonna get it
usually stocks goes 10%+ with such news, and the volume is just pathetic.
probably 1 year before you start having a solid suite of software, then after it's like it's always been ARM-platform.

Pfizer to announce "severe adverse affect" to covid vaccine. - source: my tech calls
PTON merged with Beyonce🎂 
Upgraded PTs.
Bullish.
It's determined by the actual results when each state certifies a result and the electors do an official vote.   Instead of waiting for months for all that bureaucracy to occur, the media does a projection to let everyone know the likely result and everything else is done behind the scenes.

My only regret is buying 500 shares and not 1k
AAPL up 78% on the year

MSFT up 48% on the year

AMD up 127% on the year

NVDA up 157% on the year

All of those after a monster crash in March. Still, that kind of return on investment would’ve been enough to make your boomer grandfather leave your grandmother, for good this time.

This is an insane bubble. Still might get another decade out of it though 🙃

Bullish. Calls.
RKT really needs to kill earnings. short volume picked up yesterday. 32.6 short volume ratio. need a nice little squeeze to make me some tendies.
I’ve got 50 and they’re all from my DD + ban bet posts. They have a lot of trust in me but I’m a simple retard
Bout to snag one of these ARM macs that they are releasing today.  Apple is gonna talk initially but this is the start of Apple killing it.  ARM architecture is the new standard.
I’d argue tech mega caps don’t have much room to run, and likely need to pull back some more. Air travel, hotels, etc are all still at pretty depressed prices. But I know fuck all. 

That said, all I have is NIO and PLUG. Fuck diversifying.

The funny thing is here I bet half the people pumping NIO in here don’t remember the last time it was pumped in here incredibly hard. Before it theta fucked everyone because they bought weeklies expecting it to go up forever.

We’re at that stage right now.

because the Founding Fathers didn't actually believe in the common man to choose the President.
Wow didn’t think tech would get massacred like this. We all knew the vaccine was coming but this Pfizer news came without any warning. I just rotated into energy and transportation. And I bought some Pfizer too. I’ve been strictly tech all summer, reopening stocks lost 50% in value and tech gained like 1000%. I understand the correction. I didn’t see it coming this fast, especially after last week

Officially, the next president will be determined by a vote of the Electoral College. The state votes choose electors for a specific candidate.
guessing covid cases exploding
i bougt yesterday at a apparentlyt shitty price with leverage, bought more at the lowest this morning, pls moon
I’ll keep buying and holding till then. Just before earnings I will sell
Oversold in the near term. I'd be surprised if it doesn't flirt with 500 again soon. Long term outlook is obviously still bleak with a vaccine on the horizon, but the reality is we're looking at probably another year of primarily work and school from home scenarios.

I bought a few calls as a hedge if things flip back over the next couple weeks. Vaccine news is great but we still don't have one available to the masses yet, and won't be for a little while after we have it.
Everyone’s hyping NIO up too much. Just like SLV was hyped to be $50 EOY, AAPL was hyped to be 200 EOY, RKT $50 EOY, and TSLA hitting $1000 again
Apple broke down below 115 smh

He would’ve been fired months ago. President Trumps advisors advised it would be poor optics during an election season. It would show turmoil more in the administration President Trump was not satisfied the Sec Dec wouldn’t use military force to cull riots in cities and be used as law enforcement as the Sec Dec reported that that type of force by the military should only be used as an absolute last resort.

Trump needs to put on his big boy pant suit and concede. The longer this drags on the more the market is going to get spooked and end up unwinding.
cuz ur ghey
I don’t see the market moving this direction right now tbh. Everyone’s kind of confused with vaccines and presidency, oil going up for some reason.

Too easy. Don’t do it. Doesn’t pay. 

Better off with calls until it caps. Remember, the first thing stim will do is boost airlines and cruises. More “stim talks going well” news will be here soon and will drive these farther up. 

That said, I do think cruises will hit ATL with the coming rona tidal wave. Won’t be enuf vax supply until Q3 2021.

Mumble rap bullshit. I'm so fucking mystified that this shit is popular.

Then someone was like, let's auto tune everything, make it dumber and completely unintelligible and do it for another 5 years or so.

The real play today, regardless of direction, is options on tech to take advantage of the ridiculously low IV on TSLA, APPL, SQ and UBER. There are probably more but that’s what I found.
And after very good vaccine news as well.

Don't know the exact reason, but it has to do with something about making it fair between the different states and the different population each have.

I think it's an ass-covering event since their last event was lackluster. Probably decided to risk an 'in-development' feature and pretend they were just being mysterious.  As much as I hate AAPL, they're probably going to unveil something pretty cool (for AAPL). Honestly, I hope they take more risk, their current direction would make Jobs mad enough to fire everyone.
why is it even down so much ?

No, condors centered around 420, you donut
I know that, they were saying distribution to the majority wouldn’t happen until mid June. 

Once you start manufacturing it, and actually seeing cases go down, then I can understand but these travel stocks moving this much is irrational. I’m  in tech and logically, none of this shit is gonna go away and people are still gonna be using the heavy hitters Microsoft and Apple.

Good question.
And that’s probably enough to fill the gas tank of their wife’s bf’s used Benz from 2003. Selling naked calls uses a ton of margin and their accounts don’t have tens of thousands of shares as underlying collateral to sell against.

Fuck Nio and EV stocks.  So overvalued.  You think the big boys like GM, Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai etc. are all gonna let these little POS mosquitoes eat away their share of the market?  lol.  Toyota's EVs will be on the market in 2025.  GM actually has a very good EV and autonomous driving division.  Nio market cap is worth more than GM now even though GM actually sells millions of more cars and has way more revenue.  Even accounting for GM's debt and pension obligations, its book value is worth way more than Nio.  I can't wait until all of these BS EV stocks get ground into dust by the big automakers.

Weird, my proprietary valuation shows $3.50.
The expected EPS on RKT is 1.07, isn’t that a little bit low considering they crushed last earnings? Am I missing something?
Still up over 80% last 365. Their growth was directly attributable to WFH sales. Understandable that vaccine news would negatively affect them.
Puts on cruises or will we get a short squeeze (so calls)?
Boomers can’t wait to buy their old stonks back. This will end in blood:

1. PFE vaccine news was written by lawyers, not scientists. 

2. The immunity reaction was witnessed in 90% of participants but the N was not adequate to establish actual rates. 

3. Immunity duration? 7 days. 7.

4. US now has the most rona cases (proportionately) in the world and they are increasing exponentially. 

5. PFE vaccine requires two doses, minimum, will take months to manufacture volume, and requires -100 f storage.

6. There will be talk of shutdowns and then shutdowns implemented, likely starting in the next weeks. 

The vaccine will not prevent the next wave from happening, it’s already here.

No clue, looked like a textbook short around $40, then went to $120 on COVID. Then AMZN announcement that it was building essentially the same product for a fraction of the price with a mount for your own device and it kept climbing. This thing is a fucking bear feast waiting to happen.
Sir, this is not an intelligent investment.  This was a penny call hail marry inspired by gamestop
No you’re not you just withdrew it fuck you

Looking at 12/18 200C’s for TDOC with the case count increasing, PFE sluts can suck a fat dong

I’ve run NIO through my proprietary valuation model and its fair value is 150 ...  so much more room to run guys
Did you know about the vaccine at that point when you went in on Tech?
depends on how you split it
Can we set every stock price to $0 and start over?

Me but I will sell before ER. If I can make a profit today will sell today instead.
Yeah no shit
This could be a copy/paste from the year 2000

Youre not wrong, but that doesn't mean this stuff isn't overbought to shit.
I guess
Who figured this out? And what other things did they put in their butt before finding something effective?
NIO BA BAC.. I luh you
Germany, munich
That's awesome--well done.
Going into the day with vxx calls and sbux puts
Somebody give me  boomer stock to buy calls on
This is one of the best markets to FD in. 

The move into energy yesterday? Who the fuck knows what'll happen today. Hedge something with low gamma (deep OTM) and play the lottery.

Here's an example: $V puts after it gapped up yesterday. 12-4 190P is $0.5 right now.
Should have held the Jumia FD puts I had oh well sold for a profit yesterday. My shares are Fuk tho lol
Wonder how this week would be going without any vaccine news
Looking like a flat af day
Oh fuk dem NIO tendies are in the oven
The BA positive test results were already known, it doesn't all of a sudden rescind all their canceled orders
I do, on occasion.
Did you lose $11k in one day? That’s sad, my condolences.

Anyone playing XPEV to earnings this week?

Knee oh
Agreed.  This was not one of those 990 times, thankfully.

same, got fucked hard by schwab's glitches yesterday. at one point, they said i OWED $265k, which is impossible, because I trade on cash only and had no naked options.

Bro pump that stock broo
Eh, the difference this time is earnings showed the lockdown/stay-at-home didn’t help tech as much as people hoped/expected, so I’m not sure about a rush back in
Full loaded.. can't go tits uppp
I don't think I would have used $1200 in this way.  It was a pretty nihilistic move tbh
What you guys think is going to be the biggest growing stock in the next 5 years? 

I think DKNG
Everything but banks being red is fucking hysterical.
They're trying to reach the older demographics
Haven’t done any big plays in about a month. Almost feel like i need to lose 20-30% to remind myself that losing 1.2% on my tech shares isn’t bad LOL
If NIO wasn’t Chinese everyone would be cumming over it. Think about that.
I'm not imprezzed by your putsformance.
You forget where you're at? Most of these tards seriously convinced themselves the whole market shifted and valuations would never matter again, tech only go up.
A Buyden presidency is good for oil prices, FYI.

That's a myth hoss
People here knew that tech would be big F once a vaccine was ready right? 

Not that a vaccine is starting to be distributed or anything yet, so Tech will probably rebound for a bit, but betting on Tech then would be silly.

Tech isn’t going away but at these valuations there will certainly be less incentive for people to buy.

ETSY down 17%, PTON 20%, DOCU 14.7%

Wish I had kept an eye on that so I could have gotten some cheap calls.

Its been at least 3 weeks since I've pissed away money on options..
Shh they might ban you for modest gains a
Airplanes and rockets only go up. BA to Mars confirmed. BA $420 by 2023. ✈️🚀🐂📈
This year will come full circle at that point.
That's what the little nieces and nephews call an "ouchie".
Only if you can afford them contacts
meh.  it could trade sideways due to push/pull from rotation out of tech.  individual targets are better at the moment.
we die at 20?
Fuk i am praying to god
For everyone saying NIO is risky because SEC violations, you really think China is going to commit fraud on NIO after its gotten so much attention? It’s they’re golden EV child and the Americans are finally funding it by purchasing ADS. NIO is getting investment revenue from America and China government. And if they are fudging the numbers they will make it untraceable and silence anyone who tries to leak it. There is a lot more riding on this stock than Luckin Coffee

Costs to much 🤷‍♂️
You see it as expensive and overpriced. I see it as just the beginning of how companies do business from this point on. Even if we had a vaccine, do you think companies will now want to fly their employees to one location, book them in hotels, rent them cars, and rent out conference centers to have a meeting, while their competitors use technology to have meetings remotely, saving significant amounts of operating expenses. This was eye-opening to many traditional businesses that needed to use technology to adapt. A pandemic was a threat to their business. They won't go back to a vulnerable state.

Most of us are too young to remember but late 90s early 00s the oil companies convinced the world that we were "running out" and drove the price to 120 a barrel.

Sure? Lol no but the last time it rallied it climbed up to 60+. Earnings doesn’t appear to be priced in and I think it will beat significantly... play at your own risk
Its a questionable buy in my book depending on how long you want to hold it. I think it could be a good buy for the dip once people get the memo that Covid19 isn't cancelled yet but I would look to exit with a profit rather than hold long as I think it's way overpriced once things normalise.
You’re fine. Max you’ll lose is what you paid. Future advice, something that took me months to learn, options are mostly day trade vehicles. Don’t sit on a contract for days as the Theta will eat away at your contract. Swing trades are your friend. Buy a contract toward the end of the day and sell the next morning.
So how long before Value rotates back into Tech?

Don't think it will recover to it's highs until the shit re; Ant gets sorted out.

Easy, that stock was hyper inflated because retard meme strength plus most of its gains were based on covid keeping everyone at home for the foreseeable future. Now that we have good vaccine news people will definitely be hitting the gyms not too long from now and don’t need super expensive exercise bikes. 

See also: Zoom. Most of those covid stocks are taking it up the poop chute right now.
It’ll drop back to 150$ soon no foreign travel, no major orders to fulfill, guidance is weak til air traffic picks up. This year Winter travel will be at its lowest in years

Don't sleep on China EV and their renewable energy sector. Their still growing middle class is larger than our entire population so they'll be consuming their own tech at a scale never before seen without having to rely on external markets. They're also the most ambitious nation in renewable energy initiatives cause strategically they don't want to be energy dependent on other nations, and they want to reverse poor health endemic due to their unprecedented industrial/economic growth that caused immense pollution these last couple decades. 

China is the new overlord. The sooner you stop fighting the inevitable and get with the program, the sooner you can stop being poor and lead a life of luxury. Ride the wave instead of swimming against it.

I was pretty confident about ACB about 2 years ago and managed to secure 400% gains when it rushed to an ATH of 14 CAD back then.
Now I'd never touch them ever again. If you wanna step in in CA I'd probably go with Aphria right now.
However I did change my priorities last year and have most my money invested in MSO's right now.
Hope with Dems back on the throne they'll push some efforts in legal Marijuana near term.

Sunflowers are incredible sources of folic acid. 100 g of kernels contains 227 µg of folic acid, which is about 37% of recommended daily intake. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis. When given in anticipant mothers during the peri-conceptional period, it may prevent neural tube defects in the baby.

If you want actual DD, they smashed earnings then oversold with ZM on vaccine news yesterday. Bounced hard off high 90s twice yesterday and in pre market and tested 109 twice 108-110 is the resistance level before mirroring the ATH breakout so 

As long as this rally is strong enough to stop out some shorts and puts and we get through easy upside of 120 this week
17% wasn't enough for you ETSY? hmm? gotta go more? bitch.

I don’t see how it can run up more on earnings when it’s been straight up already haha
Alright I will try to break even. Otherwise might have to exit a 40% loss. Ouh well happens I guess. The market has been kind lately so it is what it is
I’m only kidding around. But buying at 0.001 when it constantly increases to 0.002 might be a decent way to double money 😂

You're a bro
You dont have to believe, today is absolutly another drill.
I told you guys trump and his administration were creating the greatest pump and dump in history. We all got grifter lol
Eh, I'm holding until next earnings at least. These changes mean nothing. I can easily see it pushing $40 eventually.

Hell, it's a $125 stock if it gets to the same market cap as logitech.
Yeah!  😃
I need to know what you know. Or at least go to the same school lmao

This pfiser vaccine has a few issues though.

- you need to be given two doses for it to actually work
- it needs to be kept at -80 celcius which is problematic for distribution.

It will be fine for medical workers etc but the general pop is not getting vaccined anytime soon.
Oklahoma has beautiful beaches
Tek is in the weeds right now, but it will always come out king in the end. Every year our reliance on tech as a society gets stronger and stronger. As a tech bull, I am bleeding today, but I am not changing my long term strategy. If covid restrictions are lifted, then we will go to bars...to state at our phones and go to cruises to to spend the whole time taking and posting selfies. Covid has absolutely destroyed mall shopping- the mall is just where you go to return shit you bought online. Tech will continue to invade every area of your life.
What's the bullish case for ZM?

Good call. May buy some stock and sell before earnings in case it dumps
Tru that’s what we don’t care when we make it right 🙃
Oo-oo aa-aa 🐵 

No one knows shit right now about short-term plays. Even these “hurr durr tech is over-valued” dopes.
Most likely will trade flat cause I have calls ;)
I agree with you and that makes me right and now I'm rich goodbye I'm off in my Lambo to drive across the ocean to a private island with champagne.

You don’t think I know that dipshit? I’m saying the pullback was bigger and faster than expected.

Premarket price isn't stable tho. Going from +5% to +12% every few mins and rotating in that area..
It’s down almost 1% PM, it should be mooning by now

Did you do it? It was looking juicy then dicey now real juicy unbelievably so. I even missed the eod run up ugh.  What you do?
NIO just shrugs it off
Well I should have bought more, too. But it was already around 9% of my whole portfolio 2 weeks ago. Couldn't bring myself to dca down more.

12,50 - 13,00 is still cheap though
Just because I have QQQ puts doesn't mean I want NVDA to lead the drill again. Come on man. And if SPY could kindly up again that would be nice.
Canadian stock, meh on taxes.... no there will not be a "decision", anytime soon. That said, I would atleast hold till break even.

China was pumping all of these companies, and now they are dumping them.
In my view, there is still a lot more uncertainty about how traditional sectors (e.g., retail, cruises, airlines, movies) are going to do in the future even with the vaccine, than stay at home stocks.  Those types of sectors are going to be hard hit for a long time.  Even if people take the vaccine, I don't think anyone's rushing to jump on a cruise anytime soon.
Down 1% is a lot, I have 11/20 70c

NIO has a high floor with the China market and some innovative new ideas for products and services such as BaaS (Battery as a Service), NIOHouse, and their vehicle support/warranty. Electric vehicle sales in China have been steadily on the rise in China while NIO has exceeded on delivery expectations every quarter this year. Their quarterly revenue nearly doubled in July and they increased production at the end of the third quarter.

There will likely be an initial spike when people are able to travel on holiday again, however a lot of businesses are now much more remote capable. This will mean business travel will still be much lower for the long run and that's where the money is.

At some point you have to understand that Tesla sells cheap cars that are not competitive as a car. The technology hype might be cool, but not for years.

Look into how Tesla glues together its cells and how this might affect them if someone comes up with a better design for recycling. All these modules will be a big laibility. Obviously Tesla tells you otherwise.

Also, regarding AMD. It's technology leap is truely exciting, but they need to sell units. The same is true for NVidia. Consumer spending affects AMD/Nvidia more than Intel.

Apple will also shift from "We offer the best phone" to "We are doing services now". They spin their narrative and buy back shares with debt. Just lookup ttheir past buyback programs.

Zoom is hype. No more.

The only stck not oin your list is Amazon, which dwarfs everything with AWS alone.  
They are the only stock I would buy and accumulate at any pullback.

Tech will rotate away after all these "stay at home" narratives.

I’m getting a feeling that clean energy is gonna be sell/flat the news for awhile. Think I’m going to sell my leaps and buy back I’m in January before Biden gets in office.
Yesterday on QQQ was just a rejection of ATH plus vaccine news which in the short term will hurt it a little
It looks like we’re going to make a higher low with a higher high already and then next pump will test ATH again and most likely break through if there is no retard shit dragging it down like yesterday
Spy puts
You are absolutely correct and I’m still learning how the market moves in momentum, I guess it takes a lot of watching.

Hmm I’ll have to look into contango then. And damn, i originally got some thinking trump would throw a fit and maybe lockdowns announced again but doesn’t seem like much volatility is hitting the market.

Predictit still gives Trump a 15% chance to stage a coup and go full dictator. But plug puts is still stupid with all the euphoria. And if Trump puts any shenanigans that would work there isnt only a constitutional crisis, markets would dump across the board.

And yes, 230 calls? You are fucked.
Guys, once you sell and realize a gain, what do you do with your money? Obviously I ain’t buying anything at this levels.. am I supposed to just wait for some sort of crash?

I wish I was hy-on-potenuse.
Amazon are undervalued
Super mink corona already spreads and the current vaccines are worthless against it. Will take a while to catch on and will take a while until people take it more seriously.
Most likely, buy the dip and day trade it around noon.
Jerking off helps
Let's Roll !!!
Not to mention, the media's next angle is going to focus on how an overwhelming number of people won't take vaccine. 

60 minutes on Sunday said  a recent survey of 2,000 *medical professionals —* such as doctors and nurses  — revealed that only 60 percent of doctors would take vaccine; nurses came in at 40 percent. 

If the medical community is that unwilling to take a vaccine, you think the general population will embrace it with open arms? The road ahead is going to be very long. Tech stonks will go up.
No and you’ll lose way more than 20k by the time this is all said and done now that you’re hooked. First ones free. Good luck brother. Get a high paying job to support this.

Edit: Why tf is it not doing the thing anymore
in RH, it has a link under earnings
Is this eu amazon thing old news or amazon take another dump today
Idk, haven’t looked at numbers much. TSLA numbers probably better rn. Here’s what I’m basing it on.

1) Government backing
2) Swappable battery technology and innovation
3) Leader in EV in largest country in the world that is also actively try to cut emissions 
4) Expanding into Europe

If China isn’t fudging the numbers, this thing is a beast. Guaranteed high production due to government backing. Guaranteed market demand due to carbon emission reduction efforts. Only company working on swappable batteries and adding multiple charging ports in China (as far as I know). Plans to expand into other markets.
The banning will continue until morale improves

Had a nice solid one felt pretty good
Sometimes, not always. European indexes have taken out yesterday's highs while Dow is over 800 points off the highs.

I think lots of momentum traders have gone to nio for their earnings play but they’ll be back
that was definitely the case when trump was president hoping to rush a vaccine before the election. Now with no political advantage to be gained and an honest man in the WH come January, the vaccine should be acceptable to many more people.
Now that you feel better you can start drinking again.
Anyone here know how to assign shares of stock to specific tax lots?

I have 141 shares of apple at 127.90 but Apple keeps doing this thing where it dips to 108 and then goes to 120 and then back down. I’ve missed this twice because my low side wasn’t enough to average out to where I could sell 200 shares for an average of 120.

Does anyone know if I buy another 100 shares at 107 if I can tell Think or Swim / TDA to sell my 107 block?

Yeah but as stretched as the big tech valuations are and as crowded as that trade is, a correction can quickly accelerate into a crash. Not a prediction given we had an 8% rise in the Nasdaq in the previous four sessions

Tech is done with Biden won’t see ATH’s for years
Mmh yeah some stay at home stocks like PTON or ZM are definitely overpriced but this doesn’t mean that the whole tech sector is a bubble

... and you know I get the feeling when it hit $388 a lot of fuckers didn't. I noticed there wasn't a chorus of bulls rejoicing yesterday, but $451 was my number so I was as happy as a lark.

Edit: *TSLA bulls rejoicing
CRSR earnings out yet?
Remind me in 3 hrs
No, the whole market has agreed to pull their money out of one sector this week.  Not to hold it but to dump it in something else that we determined we should all pool into.
Hell Fuk Naw.
Triple top = Triple bottom
In fact, you just described the hedge fund industry
Im just mad I closed my puts 2 weeks ago.

Made a killing on that first big selloff, but I could've made a double-killing, apparently.
Hope it joins airlines and plunge
Tonight.
ye short it
We bag holding for a bit babe
Ferda
AAL has been in an even shittier situation than other airlines debt wise so lol
I’m in.
I didn't say it, but I thought it.

I was wrong.

Bye Rona bike.

RKT earnings when?
They will not use their gym membership instead of not using their pton membership once the vaccine is out
Watch OUT... I knew that BS Vaccine PUMP was a SETUP. AAL TANKING HARD PM as they Announced a Stock Offering after the 15% Runup yesterday. It was all manufactured for Travel Stocks.

NIO $100+ EOW.
Selling stonks thereby diluting stonk price.
Oh that bubble? Yeah I almost had loss porn to post on my TQQQ a couple weeks ago. As soon as that shit turned around I was out for only like 5% gain. 

Im out of tech. Im not even buying into the S&P for a while, monthly deposits in my non-degenerate account are going into mid-cap and financial/travel/retail sector ETFs.
I miss Donald PUMP. Fuck Low Bi-dump
NASDAQ blood red

Sector rotation in full swing my dudes
On back to back days? Fuck yeah, it is.
Found pence
> Unless the stock runs flat for a week

I don't plan on that happening especially with vix anytime soon (at the very least until Trump acknowledges Biden as pres and doesn't try to fuck up the markets even more/ also who knows what's going on with covid and the vaccine). Shit I might even sell it today for a quick profit and find another opportunity depends how it moves.
Someone said i was a moron for thinking ill get PTON back below 100. Hell im going to buy it at 75..this week!
We thinking CCL can hold 20?
Depends on the timing of the cough. Did she cough and fart at the same time? Or did she fart then cough after to make it look like she coughed twice in a row? If the second one, dump her for bad timing which isnt a good look for you when playing stocks

itll sell off later this week
I sold out of my stagnant Apple position and out it into DKNG 50c 11/20, ZM 430c 11/20, and DIS 135p 11/20.
What's your positions ok draft king calls
Lets break into Pfizer and burn the research
Invaluable answer nobody will care about.

Not with that attitude you can't
Scroll through my comment history you’ll find whatever I’m in

You’re clearly new here- positions or ban means posting a link with a screenshot. Also- don’t care, we’re not talking about a specific stock here. Happens with all of them.

She should break up with you for not matching her fart.

If it drops back in the 3s everyone and they mama gettin in
Sell the contracts. Don’t wait....

What crash?  It's nearly the same as last Friday.
That's true gambling.  The only options are bankruptcy or a random billion dollar gift, and only the insiders know for sure.
because it was and still is overpriced. they would be way behind without covid.
Time to buy more AMD lol once again
will baba shit itself at open?
Don’t hate the sound of this
Well I don’t want to support the claim that there is a difference, but we can’t really figure out long-term effects in advance.       
      
Maybe lab-grown meat will be exactly what the world needs. Maybe it’ll be incredibly poisonous at the 100lb mark, and we won’t know until people start showing up to hospitals with confusing symptoms.
Smell her asshole to see if she’s a suitable mate
Nice meme, but absolutely nobody is gonna buy it especially for the fact that even if it comes with some cool design you’re just going to put a case over it anyhow..
Rotation is just, dude I literally think people just male shit up now
Ya
Yeah, in the beginning you feel confident that shit will rebound. But then... now I’m starting to feel not so confident..
So...what should we buy instead of tech. Any particular suggestions?
What’s your tp for shop?
You better fucking believe it
No dont do that! Stocks only go up! This is the new economy people dont work or have to do anything ties to the physical world! Just buy stocks and everyone can get rich!!!
Is it maybe because their sky high valuations were tied to the assumption that we will be indoors for the next 376373 years?
Be a gentleman, offer to eat her fart next time.
Corsair only up 6% rn ah 

If this doesn’t hold is IV fucked?
Dow and BA. Need to carry today
Wait longer to buy the tech dip
Of the year*
Not ATH
Sir, This is a Wendy’s.
Heh, oil may be the play right now.
Anybody playing AFL? They did well earnings a few weeks ago but didn’t pump as hugely yesterday. As things open up they’ll be back to crazy high growth and everyone will want more insurance now right? 

I’m playing 2023 $40 leaps now selling calls against them. But debating switching to something more short term
Bidump confirmed
Finally blew a small play account for my part.
This is the end of my gambling hopefully
Nio ath today???
NIO will hit 50 before years end
God bless his soul.
Spoiler: you can’t
There is no vaccine.vtheyre killing 17million mink where I live because of covid mutation in them
Lets break into Pfizer and steal burn the research.
It's ok DHI you go when your ready
>Dan\_inKuwait

Very interesting technology also with the "need" and looks towards renewable energy they could be big soon, if government pushes them with contracts etc, they could be involved in a way bigger scale = BIG MONEY   


Also I just posted in discussion thread as this post was removed from its original post section :)
They have agreed to keep costs minimal since they already received a ton of funding to work on the vaccine.  It's not going to sell for $1000/dose or even $100.  It's going to be a tiny portion of sales for a giant company.  Think of it like Apple making their own wipe for their phone screen.
I will be very impressed if they can compete with the big 2. They’ve proven themselves in the mobile chip game. Let’s see if they can run with the big ones and really shake things up. 

Amd has been killing it lately, but they still don’t have the massive contracts that intel does for system integrators. 

Apple may be boned if they can’t expand outside of just their products with their chips. 

Honestly that’s why I’m surprised that nvidia is going for ARM instead of apple.
I'm not trying to diversify man. I'm trying to just swing trade something.
Fuck a healthy tech company, all in on the bail out dependent airlines!!
My last big winner was in June back before I blew up my account
My Gf farted and tried to cover it up by coughing. Should I break up with her?
Holy fuck I wanna try but I don’t think I can do it
Idk maybe. Depends what strike
Actual decent answer
It's a rotation, not a crash. Take profits on tech and put them into small caps.
It's amazing how retarded people are and dont understand how bad the macro economics are and how big of a bubble we are still in
bruh i hv similar positions will u hold till friday?
think still worth getting puts on it?
And I bet he isn’t paying taxes either!!
Lmao retarded boomers think we won’t buy the tech dip
$AMD calls free $ with Apple’s event at 1 PM
Ive been losing money for so long i forget what picking a winner feels like. Anybody got any ideas i can inverse
I definitely think it will bounce by then so I wouldn't get rid of jan calls. Shorts are gonna be out in full force today so just be rdy.

Dip the nuggets!
Eating it right
Remember the morons rushing into Hertz around bankruptcy? That same crowd will see the AAL dip as an entry point.
Oh no see the thing is I don’t care about you lol... It’s still a worthless idea regardless, and ANYONE would rather just buy a case instead of wasting extra money on something so trivial. It’s not really a good business idea to be honest.
Out there wandering around while Delta fucked straight up America's crotch.
I think you’re underestimating the meme factor

Are those.... Shares?
tech is dead, don't need those fancy shmancy computers or clouds anymore. this economy runs on airlines and malls now.
I bought at 45. 212 auto sold my positions yesterday after the dip fucked me. I’m going to hold this shit for as long as possible 😅
But I have Apple puts printing xd

With the election over and a vaccine on the horizon, money is moving to stocks that seem artificially undervalued right now.  Tech stocks going down is just a byproduct of that movement.

I really have to pay attention to fundamentals.. got to learn..
I already did on Friday and yesterday. It is being front run and earnings will be sell the news event - is my thesis. It is already 4th largest car manufacturer in the world by market cap, closing in on 3rd, which is volkswagen (Toyota and Tesla being other 2), who currentlty sells about 250! times as many cars as NIO per year. I know these numbers do not mean much in this market, but with vaccine, sector rotation etc, it seems that some sense and reasonable fair valuation is coming hopefully back to markets, and for stocks like NIO, that means puff.
Because tech stocks went down
Do people really believe Nasdaq can crash and not take the rest of market with it? I don’t think so.
If you are up a lot on NIO sell that shit retard. It’s gone up in a straight line for 6 months. How are you people this autistic.
You can find the good grass fed beef here... but no one I know likes the taste... they all say it’s “gamey”. The regular shit just tastes like sugar water or something though, it’s awful.
Just use reddit with all sub themes off, thumbnails off, and old reddit. Its streamlined

It still wouldn't be available for months even if they announced it 3 weeks ago... And it still won't be available to anyone outside healthcare workers or vulnerable seniors even longer.
Two words.

Right but you had to buy the option from someone right? Until they buy it back they are losing any money you gain from IV swings.
Hope it holds!
Ah, hittin’ them with that Late Night Tip.
Me too, picked some up yesterday. I'm going to average down and enjoy the ride.
Dow  up for the headlines. makes the boomers feel good about their tech stocks they won't bother checking.
I mean, tech is no more for the now.
sector rotation time
nice! I figured fuck it I'll put like 80 bucks down on a weed stock with Biden coming in. I thought maybe there'd be hype into it, so I got an 8c for March in APHA. Would be happy just to break even tbh, but curious to see how the market reacts in the months to come
LOL, Hi son. I missed you!
Can someone please make a WSB brokerage where the bars are actual green and red dildos
Were gonna rip at open still got a lot of cash gang to buy the dip
I’m just gonna say it. New banner sucks
You sound like a 🌈🐻acting like fundamentals mater in this market

I feel bad for you missing in this 50% run since March lows. Stop buying puts
Looks like NQ bottomed. This dip is probably gonna get bought up. People remember last time Amazon hit 3k with the massive reversals.
I think we are going green again today bois.
Yeah but he lost 'other peoples money' and he keeps his last 10 years of bonuses. He didnt lose out.
How is this fucked up?  When did you buy your calls

Remember, a few days ago JP Morgan said tech is done. 

And that people should switch to cyclicals, travel/leisure/industrials.

Looks like they weren't lying this time 😪
737 could be ungrounded by next week! $BA is the boomer stock of the year! $BA 200* eow
Fucking fuck. This proves even having enough money to squeeze the market doesnt buy you IQ.
Looking forward to hat shit aswell. Currently 2.3k in the red, but owning almost only stocks now and adding about 1k per month, so hopefully green soon.
Dumb part is I don’t know shit about these teams and I’m set to make 170 bucks with 10 dollars 😭😭
Lots of oversea markets just don't get the usa's pe

Ok not all of it but didnt help. put call ratio went down like a mofo yesterday. enormous amount of calls bought at open
Huh?

all Im saying is y not take 5k and do crazy shit so instead of 1 trade at 25k you could do 5 trades, if your going to treat it like gambling (like were on here to do pretty much) still might as well play the odds better
I’ve been trying to warn you guys of this exact outcome for a while now (sector rotation out of tech). Time to say I told ya so.
Its now down over 16%.

Meh, leaps do have their place to be honest. For example yesterday buying leaps on the vix dip would be pretty smart to cover your ass in the future but I agree if you buy leaps when a stock has already run up so much (nio) then good luck retard.
He’s done. He has no incentive to pump
Thanks. This is where I struggle with trading. I tend to dump at open when in profit. 

I need a better strategy and have yet to come up with one. I realize its all about risk tolerance/risk management but I have left tons of money on the table by selling too soon.
ReCaptcha's you to check.
I’m so close to just quit all my calls for JAN/FEB/MARCH and just cucking yolo everything away, just to get it over with. This is so f up.
I think they will end the day up
I’ve been silent for a bit. I’m not a popular user, I sometimes make haha funny jokes

I’ve been more or less kangarooing spy like an idiot for a short while. Spy goes down, I do a call calendar or regular long call. Spy goes up I do puts

I did a put calendar and call credit spreads and spy has punished me for it

If spy is below 350 in the next week you may see me again green, otherwise I’ll just buy fucking spy shares and day trade those instead of whatever the fuck stupid self has done

It’s all about vaccine at this point, if we have vaccine, bad for tech
Whenever i order the "rebel" as Burger King calls it in Scandinavia, it always takes forever for them to make it and they always look a little annoyed when I place the order.

I wish more people would try it. There's no reason to buy the animal product now. It's not meat, but it is damn close in every aspect.

There are many awful products that attempt to create vegetable meat, so my guess is that a lot of people are not going to give it a second or third try. 

Also, the rebel is way more expensive as the double meal offer does not apply to the rebel. 

Maybe BK just wanted it to fail as animal meat is more profitable?

It’s not satisfying enough to be a replacement for meat for someone who is a meat eater. It’s a meat-flavored/textured vegan food that is being used as a substitute for other vegan foods. It’s not reducing the consumption of beef burgers, but the consumption of whatever other vegetarian food was available as an alternative. So the proper carbon footprint impact is assessed when comparing it to other vegan foods that it substitutes for.

Edit: For BM to be a substitute for meat, the product would have to be much cheaper, to appeal to thrifty customers. But if the processed food vendors who deal in ground beef wanted to allow cheaper menu items, they would offer inexpensive plant based protein menu items already. The sales they CAN attract with BM type products are when they attract new customers who are vegans who don’t currently eat at places like Burger King because of lack of protein options

But i already do, held through the pain of 2020, now looking brighter.
AAPL is a great stock. But, people have unrealistic expectations thanks to 2020. After the PE expansion AAPL is not going to double in one year again. 

AAPL PE went from literally 10 in 2016 to 35 today. Explains how they grew EPS 50% yet price grew about 400%.

AAPL PE is not going to go from 35 to 70 and it will take at least 5 years at their current growth rate to double EPS unless black magic happens.

AAPL won't rocket, it's going to be climbing the stairs. You're better off with the mid-caps for rocket potential, or get lucky with 0DTE.
Aye aye!
its a clock company
Gonna be a weird stay. Keep your powder dry
I hate it here
Hahahaha AAL offering shares
With some Nio calls he could retire this year
Of course it doesnt just give them billions. Pfizer is billions of dollars in the hole right now. Difference is it would just take a junior app developer to enable contact tracing.

So basicly, the value of my stocks will rise after the aquision as the total capital of the firm is gonna worth more? Won't they be affected by the xilin shareholders whose shares will transform in AMD shares?

Which made the biggest move up this week? I want to buy puts on that (not NIO though lol)
Damn it bears. Show me a good rug pull. I missed out on the March one and want to see what I can buy on sale.

You are not worried it'll be a limp biscuit for the coming week or 2? There are some days big tech moves 3-4% and AMD is stuck at 1.5-2%
So buy tech not today but soon.

AMZN sub-3000 is the signal. Another 2-3% or so.

I sold all my DFEN to buy PLTR leaps and shares yesterday. Not feeling intelligent right about now
id imagine so
Don't even get my started w the $30 calls and how all over the place they were yesterday. I do not hold calls on stocks I own through earnings so I sold yesterday, but I managed to buy them at $1.9 during the AM surge only to have them fall to $1.20 and then back up to $2. I sold for a loss in commission bc I sold in batches some for $2 and enough at $1.6 to erase the .10c gains. Anyway, my puts I sold yesterday during the dip should make up for it at least...I have 40% of my account in CRSR and am probably sailing this ship on a circumnavigation of the Globe to tendie town even if it takes a little bit. They crush these earnings we are $ but realistically, I expect it to take longer to see margin improvement and solid evidence that new gaming product lines can be expected to produce solid, continuous results.
I was heavily leaning towards BA yesterday at 180, at 185 I question how much pump it's got left. The vaccine is still months away.
Right?? Can SPY stop being a bitch and follow

Star Walls: Revenge of the Bear
Ok boys, only enough spare cash in my account to buy 1 good dip. What'll recover the best?

AAPL

AMD
NVDA
AMZN

I actually bought TSLA last dip and that face ripping rally last week did fking nothing for it, it humped 420 on a  Nasdaq 4% day wtf? NVDA was the play that week. Leaning towards NVDA again. Sub 500 entry.

AMD seems limp dick

AMZN seems limp dick too with the vaccine announcement. Will probably slow its bounce back.

AAPL safe, could have potential if it hits 108 again.

I think you’re right in terms of an eventual change maybe decades down the line but the quality of weed your average amateur grower would produce, and the quality the company/dispensary being supplied parts produces is of much higher quality

That doesn’t take into account the growing period, issues with mold etc etc.

I think overwhelmingly there will be some very strong weed stocks in the future. I just don’t know out of this batch of companies right now which that will be

Iv'e had puts on BYND meat for a while now but I'm no averse to kicking a dog company while its on the mat and down 20+% with more to go. 70$ by next week hopefully!!! 

BYND Meat short thesis summary:

The company is in a low margin industry with competition from much  larger players rapidly increasing. The product sector is over saturated  with similar offerings all competing for the same consumer. This is one  reason why their margins are decreasing - see SEC quarterly report. The  company has little prospect of larger deals now as McDonalds is now  selling the McPlant independently - see recent news articles. If you  read my previous posts you will see that I said that this is exactly  what they would do - develop their own product without the need to pay  BYND.

Beyond Meat is losing money ( has negative  income ) and is also increasingly cash flow negative (it is losing money  in its everyday operations at a incerasing rate). It's revenue growth -  the only hope that supporters have - is clearly slowing down quarter on  quarter - see recent quarterly reports. This is nothing short of a  complete disaster for a company that share price has 'priced-in'  accelerating and not decelerating revenue growth. Remember that the  company is not sustainable in terms of its operating income at current  low revenues - it likely can't make a consistent profit if revenues do  not dramatically increase to achieve higher net margins and economies of  scale.

Its debt is slowly increasing and has cash  of around $215m as of its most recent filing. In order to remain  competitive it will need to invest in factories (to reach sustainable  economies of scale) and 215$ million is not nearly enough to do so. It  will be forced to do a capital raise at some point  and dilute  shareholders further - it can't invest in revenue growth and production  capacity without doing so . At the same time it will need to continue to  burn cash in cost of goods sold - namely advertising and marketing  expenses. Look at the reports - the hype the product has costs a lot of  money to maintain. Some argue the product hype around the Beyond Burger  is the only advantage the product has. 

I could go  on and say that the impossible burger is more favoured in taste by  consumers and has better financing behind it in terms of investors like  Bill Gates and so on. Or I could mention that Lab Meat is a serious long  term threat to beyond as it actually tastes like meat (it basically is  synthetic meat) and Lab based meat companies have just listed on the  stock exchange (an Israeli company) and they a combination of Plant and  Lab based meat will likely be the future of real meat alternatives  anyway. But honestly if you have read up to here and you are still  considering holding BYND meat after today's awful news then I seriously  doubt you are thinking clearly and nothing will convince you not to buy  this horrible company. You probably bought Nikola and are still hoping  to get your money back on that. For your own sake stop being so naive.
I've said it once if I've said it a million times.

Apple's fair price right now is $97.

When it touches $100, you know the tech pain is over.

Until then, tread carefully.

I'd wait til prices stabilize end of week.
Buy even more with loans and borrowed cash from my wife's boyfriend
It'll depend on the broad market. Looks like profit taking, this sell off could last for weeks like the last time we hit the double top. The only way Baba gets back to 305 if is Nasdaq gets back to 12000. Which is unlikely. Why sell off 3% only to buy everything back again? lol. This sell off / flatness could last a bit before we test the ATH's again.
>If Pfizer results translates into other companies' vaccines then why has no other company worldwide published results anywhere near this good so far? 

No one in the world has published ANY Phase 3 data mate.

This is the first Phase 3 results we've seen for COVID in history.

Not very complicated answer lol.

Step right up to the casino.. you can either buy overpriced tech stocks with good earnings that are dropping.. or you can have bankrupt value companies bleeding money that are rising.. pick your poison.
You do realize we are going to have vaccine news every week now, don´t you? I'm fine if you don't buy calls, but don't buy puts. Why fight such big tailwinds? Perfect recipe to lose money

Good move. It always tanks after a big green day, unless when it doesn't.

Pray for this AMZN bull
... no I want to know what the result of holding an option two weeks before expiry that's in the money and if the price continues to rise if it's worth to hold until then or cash out and back in now

I made a mint on NIO and you probably already know that. My confirmation bias is in my bank account cuck

For those wondering I'm long on the stock, at $23 and have 36c 11/20 and 36c 01/15
This market is getting really volatile, especially for a normal  investor. Most people don't want to invest in cruise ships in a  pandemic. Yet, here goes all the cash out of regular companies into crap  stonks.

Luckily I unwound out of it a good amount yesterday morning, but fuck this fucking stock.
Nobody in Europe would want to buy a shitty Chinese racing car.

You can buy an electric Porsche, BMW or TSLA if you insist in having video games on your console. Nobody is waiting for NIO.
Vixx is a hedge not a long hold lmao
BA is insane, congrats to anyone who was holding.
That’s very sweet
Eventually.
Apha pumps and dumps every couple months. I think I figured i was going to buy calls starting in dec for January. We'll see if she stay around 4-5 $ 
Made bank with calls then puts last spike
Boys I'm getting kind of sweaty with PLTR. 

I know everyone memes about it being worth 100 by end of next year but after all the gains this month I legit feel like its gonna drill hard for a few weeks. 

Should I cash out before earnings or try and make a play on earnings?
Why tho
My biggest regret is that I’m holding more NIO calls than my BA, BAC, and AAL calls 🤦‍♂️
As if theres anything to sell left...
I am loaded on puts on QQQ, BYND, PTON and a bunch of MJ. As a bull, I couldn’t be happier rn being a bear lol

The op was talking about monthly covered calls so 1 month. I used a real life example with the current premium at the time for Apple stock to get 12k. 

You can use any broker you prefer. Robinhood has no fees on option trading so thats one. Some people dont like it since their customer service is subpar compared to other brokers (i.e cant call them) But I dont have any issues with them.
Be patient and find a good entry point on a sharp down movement

Based off premarket I would assume it’s gonna be a very sideways day.
Yeah I also sold at 19.60 cuz I'm also expecting it to dip but who knows, maybe investors are looking for different places to park their money now. I hope the tech run isn't over though

Because you're essentially buying volatility. If the stock does not exceed the sum of the call and put options, you'd make a loss. 

Basically the option loses value over time and if the stock does not move much, you'd be obliterated by r/thetagang

newbie here. quick question, since the worst case you lose 100% of your money but the potential gains are like so much more than your capital(I have no idea how options work but this is what i gathered from the posts here), why not just buy both calls and puts with the same amount of money that expire on the same date?
Nice

This is only a problem if you’re all in and can’t limit down. Lots of these tickers are coming up to or bouncing off resistance; and if you look at recent charts, it’s a normal dump, and they will pump again. 

However a concern is an additional catalyst breaks through and we free fall ... and well then it’s a full on Bear orgy and I’m out.

I think so as well
Position?
Well FAANG is fucked dude, idk what to tell you bro
Well if I read ur original post I do think that the big investors know the nuances. I’m pretty sure Logitech discloses what percentage of their revenue comes from gaming, office equipment etc. And looking at the pre market now CRSR seem to open 12% which might be an earning drive most likely, since tech futures aren’t doing that hot, so a tech bounce isn’t likely. But at the same time I haven’t looked into the statements or companies themselves. This is pure what I know from my personal experience from the time I was being active in tech retail sales and from gamers experience. So I don’t know how Logitech’s portfolio is exactly divided to make correct statements related to why remote working might be the reason why it’s getting fucked.
I doubt that but I could see PFE 48$ and also BNTX at $200

Best case scenario Pfizer can APPLY for expedited FDA approval.in 6 weeks.  Then it's actually got to get approved, be mass produced, distributed and population needs to trust enough to get it.  Most people I talk to want to wait for others to test it first given the likely rush through normal safety timelines.  It's RNA, that can have serious consequences if done wrong.   Bottom line travel wont be reopening for thanksgiving, probably not christmas or new years either.  You think MMs are holding airlines and cruises until.Jan? No, this will be a 3 day pump and dump, and back into tech.

Mount Sinai retrospective surveillance study just came out and is estimating that 1.7 million New Yorkers already have had virus. The study utilized serum samples from non-Covid visits way back from early February. Lockdowns are out of the question, talks of it is just to alleviate public fear. 

TLDR - Rona has been around for much longer than we’d like to accept. Vaccines are around the corner, given 😴 ☕️ holds onto office, WW3 doesn’t begin and 🐘 s hold onto senate I don’t see how you can’t be long on this market after January

DIS looks too high given all the way still to go to solve this thing. Some other travel stocks (AAL - for example) still significantly behind post-covid highs. Agree lockdowns may still happen (narrative could be "save lives before vaccine arrives" on promise of later-normality). Easier to justify lockdowns to save lives in short term if permanent fix is around corner.

The data is shit poor for analyzing, wish they had published everything in the Lancet or other decent journal. I guess they just wanted to give the easy to understand points, so they can ask for it to be rolled out. More data will surely follow though.

As for wearing a mask, it's not very arduous, and I might keep wearing one until general vaccine uptake is high enough (partially to avoid infection, but also to avoid others slacking off with their precautions (they might not wear their mask when they should, if they think others are not)). I would probably check in with colleagues in public health and infectious disease as well, to inform my choice

you realize the options are "cheap" because of the dividends right? Since MM will own the stock to hedge the calls, they will get the dividends on the owned share and thus partially offseting the premium they charge you.

Its depend how long is your "Long-term" let's say if the pullback is real because of vaccine then 2-5 years shouldn't be a problem for Amazon to get back to what it was last week. I actually think the pullback is short-term only I'll say max this week and then slowly back to "Tech normal" again. Probably not all Tech will get back go normal but Amazon is a big company and it's good in covid-19 and outside covid-19.

Don't forget that Jeff just sold like 3B worth of amazon stock last week too.
so do i just sell all my calls and restart. or do i just hold and cry along the way

Absolutely, CRSR generally sells high end gamer equipment for streamers while LOGI sells a range of products from cheap to expensive office quality stuff.  You can also see LOGI is scared a bit by CRSR cause LOGI put big money into streamers like Shroud to try and protect that "gaming market".  I just think sometimes we give the "big investor" too much credit for knowing the nuances of companies.  Long term CRSR will be great, but as a trade after earning sometimes those differences don't matter.
No one here actually knows. Trust your gut, thats all ya got.
Just woke up and checked CRSR. Looking good. Looking good. Just shatter earnings please and go up to a $100? Maybe $200? Heck, make it $1000, I won’t complain.

No one knows the answer to that in the short term. I will tell you this - if Pfizer didn't announce its vaccine yesterday, AMZN would probably had hit 3400 today or already yesterday. Nothing changed about the company so nothing should change in the way you look about it. This "sector shift" is a huge overreaction (in my humble opinion at least) and all these cruise lines spiking 40% up will drop again very quickly when the market realises we aren't actually done with Covid. 

Tech giants like amazon and apple are here to stay, and as long as your'e not playing contracts with an expiration date - you should be just fine.
Sorry, people realized they can eat vegan for free and have their lawn mown at the same time.
Preying we can get another 5-10% squeeze out of em
How is this not being discussed already. People have been mentioning contact tracing so much that when Pfizer vaccine news came out, this stock tanked for no reason.

Tiberius is the software powered by PLTR to orchestrate the entire delivery operation. 

Can you even imagine what this company is going to be involved in long term, big-data related?

Think logistics, manufacturing, operations, etc etc etc.
This move from consultancy to tech company is real and will have a huge impact.

Their consultancy phase served as a period of acquiring as much knowledge from big tech firms in order to set the groundwork for what's to come.

Yes, fundamentals. However they are anticipating a 1bil revenue for 2020, and the outlook for next few years is insane, if this is what's going to be used by SpaceX for managing the Mars operation.
Sorry but I need to see blood tomorrow

I think once this current surge in travel stocks and whatnot dies down they are going to be really safe to buy puts on.

My SPY puts could be happy a second day in a row. But I miss my QQQ puts. What did I do :-/
I am going to add something else to your post which by the way I find quite compelling thematically, we could have quite the debate about why PFE and BioNTech are or aren't good investment.

As you have somewhat pointed out, in the short term not much money is going to be made. That is a well understood phenomenon in biotech. A tangential example would be the scarce development of new antibiotics. New compounds are really expensive to develop and once one is found governments regulate the shit out of them because of how absolutely fucking important they become.

Now, what is at play here, something truly transformational is the technology behind this (and several competing) vaccines. PFE/BioNTech [BNT162](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNT162) is an mRNA vaccine. Instead of injecting some "weakened" form of the pathogen and hoping for the body to be like "oh heck you shouldn't be here" and mount an immune response without killing you in the process, an mRNA vaccine consists on isolating some part of the genetic material of the virus, stabilizing it and then injecting it in your body. Inside your cells the genetic material is converted into the corresponding protein, and if effective, an immune response is obtained. PFE/BioNTech HAVE JUST SHOWN THAT THIS FUCKING IDEA WORKS!! Yeah, everybody was expecting for it to work, but they actually did. That means they have a bunch of data and expertise to guess what?.?.?.? DEVELOP many more vaccines!!! Not only against microbes, but also for practically any agent. Cancer? Sure, just look for the mutational signatures most likely to enhance an immune response. Dementia? Sure, just go through the dozens of genetic markers associated with protein aggregation in the nervous system. Aging? Hell yeah, a lot has been uncovered about the biology of senescent cells which can be targeted and treated.

As you mentioned this is a pivotal moment for the human race. Do you think this is all bullshit speculation? Fair enough, there are many challenges ahead and a lot of charlatans will emerge. Will only these two companies emerge victorious?  Absolutely no. You shall all be very excited. THIS IS NOT INVESTING ADVICE!!

3. "Assembly line" my dude, it's a fucking farm, the butcher sources his meat from the farm and he cuts it up. There is no "assembly line" it's not a fucking macbook or your shitty tofu. NO factory is involved, otherwise I'd have bought stock in that factory already considering i'm probably their biggest client if they even existed. I eat meat every fckn day and won't apologize for it to some low-life disinformation-spreading hippie.

I'm no market guru so don't depend on me lol but I think AMZN is good long-term at least? It still has areas where it will keep growing, like SaaS, and its grip on consumer purchasing isn't weakening any time soon. And also, it hasn't gone up in months, and analysts give it nice price targets (I rely a lot on analysts and believe they do guide the market to some degree).
Its going to be a red day strictly based off how bad that new banner is holy shit
Holding AMZN shares @ 3244, what should I do?

Perhaps, the problem is that we’re not actually experiencing inflation right now if not in asset prices and forex. The fed is out of ammo and stimulus ain’t getting passed. All new money is literally debt anyway, so we need more (commercial) lending but nobody is doing that right now.
So potentially volatile/'bearish' scenarios still to play out:

\- Vaccine cleared, but covid levels so high lockdowns are needed to bring under control pre-vaccine.

\- Vaccine effective for 'mild' sufferers; less effective for the elderly/vulnerable who actually are at risk.

\- No stimulus / Fed curtail support

What is missing?

In the mean time BABA/AMZN on discount.
Not always, but fair. 

I guess the problem in these situations is that the put premiums are so high that it's not as profitable as one might think. I'm out of the position, but curious to see what the 10p price closes at this week.

Looks like it's possible this Airline Rally has some legs, but I have thought this before. How long do I hold my BA Call $165 06/18/21 and AAL Call $12? Picked them up otm on the end of October dip.

On one hand, I feel like the pump could last months, slowly going up each day with steady hands Biden lowering the Vix. On the other hand, Since March I have seen Airlines tumble after a day or two of extreme pump about 20 times.

Currently thinking Diamond hands, it's also 1/5th of my portfolio, so I won't be in shambles if it fails. FAA Approval/Stimmy/Bailout/Vaccine/Holiday Travel all pros to consider vs the one big con they aren't profitable right now and might not be for years. I am thinking peak hope vs despair is right around the first week of January.
Please tell me no one bought calls after a near 100% runup in a week
Agree 100%.

Nice. Thanks. Good luck.

I see ur point but remember that Logitech has a wider exposure and a big part of their exposure comes from office peripherals. While CRSR is mainly focused on the gamers segment. So Logitech is getting dicked by the fact that remote working will be less needed therefore people need less office equipment.

the call I bought yesterday takes a hit, but I'll buy more. I personally like calls that are a few months away and at a reasonable price target, so, Jan, Feb, Mar, with $290-310 target for me. And I might play a weekly for some short gains; that one is risky though, will require keeping an eye on price movement at all times

ESRT and a bunch of small to mid cap hotel stocks which have mooned bigly since I sold them at open yesterday. Guh.

The problem is what is major correction % wise?  The market drops .5% and this place already gets the "buy the dip memes" out.  Do I think we could have a 5% pull back, absolutely.  I think we are going to have a relatively weak Christmas.  People have burned through their "safety cash".

I'm pretty confident they they're not cutting the important corners. They're still doing multiple rounds of trials before mass-production. There's always a tiny chance of other side effects, but even these are usually very minor, especially compared to the disease which the vaccine is for. If thousands of other people experienced none or very minor side effects, over a period of many months (realistically more than a year by the time you get the vaccine), I feel it's safe, and certainly *far* safer than taking your chances with a face mask and hand sanitiser. Though I"ll probably continue to do the latter.

Just to add to this, in the UK (and many other parts of the world) a mortgage with a fixed rate for the lifetime of the loan is pretty unusual. You'll get a fixed rate for two to five years, and after that you move to something linked to the lender's "standard variable rate" which ultimately is whatever that lender feels like at the time (although they are competing with pther lenders, so it's usually not crazy high compared the UK base rate), or you go out and find a new mortgage deal with a new fixed rate for another few years.
Normally, I would be 100% on CRSR earnings because they are gonna perform well and they recently picked up some key companies to transition into a more robust company for the long term.  However seeing what the market did to Logitech yesterday (CRSR remained relatively untouched), now CRSR looks overvalued by apples to apples comparison.

Yes, I totally agree about the side effects of getting COVID. What if the first round of vaccine could give you other side effects that aren’t unknown yet? I mask up daily, even for a 5 minutes walk. I consider myself very cautious by sanitize every two minutes. Even I get vaccinated I would still put my mask on for others health. Unless the whole trump’s cabinet get vaccinated, I’m not touching the first round of vaccine
Dr, so while I might be youngish, others around me are not, and I don't want to unwittingly be an asymptomatic carrier, infecting the vulnerable.

Generally I suggest everyone who can to get vaccinated, assuming there is no great shortage.
oh shit,,

Buffet is foaming at the mouth first time Dow is up over tech
So look realistically. Short run, yes. Airlines, movie theatres, cruise stocks are gonna do ok. Next week FDA approval. Then it’ll tank cuz of cases on the rise and full on lockdowns in more left leaning states. I’d wait for the full on dip in covid stocks next week if I had 10k
Momentum looks like it stopped. NASDAQ dragging whole market down
is etsy part of tech?
So I bought $1000 worth of Pfizer calls am I a retard for doing it after today’s pump or y’all think it’s gonna go up for the rest of 2020?
Looking forward to buying the tech dip
Why you reposting that shit with different account?
Yeah I suspect this is the move.
Seems pretty unlikely that QQQ is going to make further losses past today if dow stays in rally mode. One or the other has to give.

We're probably a year away from even this vaccine getting into general circulation, assuming no issues. That's a long time before said companies *begin* to recover. Personally, I'm chalking yesterday's move to a knee-jerk. Once people realise this doesn't mean covid disappears tomorrow, we'll be back to status quo. Traditional sectors have a long, slow road to recovery.

Then again, the stock market appears driven entirely on speculation now, so yolo 4:20 bitches.

Conscious. Isn’t as appropriate as the others. The order type is also influenced by your investment approach. Make sure it’s worthwhile when placing.
You bought in yesterday, or just held through? To be fair, it looked like DKNG was on a short term trend reversal on the daily, but I think the vaccine news cucked that shit.

Absolutely. Have you seen images of lungs post covid? Even healthy, young people are reporting months of issues which may be permanent. Lots of men reporting issues having erections. If you're an average Redditor who rarely leaves the house, you're fucked if you catch covid. You probably won't die, but life is about to suck a lot more.

You are making ThetaGang look bad my friend..

Why would you sell options on shit stocks?

Have you never tried to just Sell Apple Puts, Boeing Puts or even Amazon Puts for God's sake, do you understand you want to just sell puts on good stocks and that's it?

About one year, could get ugly here in the next 90 days if the vaccine isn’t as effective as we thought, and if corona gets worse but I’m taking that gamble. 
If it goes right I’ll make 100%

Agree and enjoyed reading your support for Beyond long term because it is "more than burgers", and also believe that the future generation - with us now in their twenties / teens - have less tunnel vision and appreciation of the wider implications. 

You have probably read this, but apparently it is in collaboration with Beyond:

You're essentially saying if you're trying to make it a low carbon, you have to be a complete purist, which doesn't really make sense.  The costs of processing and transport  are relatively insignificant compared to actually producing food.  Even with copious processing it'll beat any meat based meal by a long shot.  

Hard to tell veggies they aren't allowed to spend extra emissions gluing together their pea protein when most people are still eating so much meat.
You actually just gave me an idea. I could print it digitally. Maybe finding a third party printer that would print and ship for me is the answer.

What finances?
Move more, eat less. Try to always have healthy food at home? Some snacks with litle energy to fill your stomach. 

Figure out 5 healthy and easy recipes that you come back to if you dont come up with something better?

Replace something like ice cream with yoghurt. Candy with fruits. you get the idea. 

I would argue more fibre & protein and less carbs, sugar & fat. 

eat proper breakfast and eat more often in smaller portions to keep your energy levels reasonable and avoid eating too much unhealthy stuff when hungry.

Bro you can rotate out of tech all you want, but why is Costco going down.....
He doesn’t care about the broad finances. When it’s not to his own advantage Trump has no interest in it. I expect him to do everything possible to get a advantage when he is out of office.
Frankly i m not happy with Biden rally. I mean all co with strong fundamentals tanking while forgotten ones , casino,cruises, scam and hype companies pumping like crazy.wtf🙄
pricing in for the greatest recovery america has ever seen.
Perhaps
 where is the fucking fat check
Cause yields tank hard lol tech has that weird negative correction with 10 yrs
The media is gaslighting people by using the phrase "widespread". Yes there is no evidence of that we agree but that isn't what we're saying happened. 

We are saying there was \_targeted\_ election fraud. All you need to do is perform fraud in key democrat run cities in swing states and you can win the entire state. 

This is what Trump will expose. It will ruin the democrats for a generation.
everything happens during premarket or afterhours can't really catch any plays then holding anything overnight is just a gamble
weed completely shits up everything. its not that important. i was always able to get weed for the same price people pay now for legal. i was arrested with it several times and cops didnt care
Weird how the market itself recently became immune to vaccine pumps but suddenly yesterday it cared again. Not necessarily doubting PFE but yesterday's rally was one of the shakiest I've seen since the March dead cats.

Gonna play it safe and speculate and scalp weed stock instead today🤡
It should be a crime for what they’re doing to the VIX

Make volatility great again!!!

As it stands, we know the bears are hiding in tech, and  you can be assured that us bulls will be coming for you ⚔️ 🐻 🩸
Wtf you talking about. There was no stimmy in October. Msft is trading below august highs.
We still get a shitty q4 2020 and shitty q1 q2 2021 which the market hasn't priced in. 


Its to euphoric at the moment.
💯
It’s a tech company. They have a website, don’t they?
Fair but as I mentioned individual companies could remain flat but very doubtful for industry as a whole. Biggest risk is we see new companies come in and take market share

An Iphone of course. Man if only this country wasnt so lazy we too could make our youngins learn the value of hard work so they can make me American Iphones instead. I'd pay the American child labor tax.

Okay but NIO
these futures are boring af.
love the low iv on all these boomer stocks, we getting rich boys sorry tech bagholders
guys.. i hate to say it but tech is probably going downtrend for a while. we haven’t corrected much since august highs and the stimulus gave a fake pump in october. apple and msft are pretty bloated rn i’d say aapl could go down to fill the gap at 90s before we trend upwards. but idk my bet is on aapl puts after the event today
Good news for Plug

Do you really think that tech is going to crash and never recover? Tech is the future.. if anything is going to crash in a few years it would be brick and mortar stores.

“Shit business” has de facto product for lucrative government contracts. “Losing money” but expected to turn its first profit this quarter, they went public at this time for a reason - could be a great earnings report. “Tech company” they are not valued using a tech multiple, you are right. They are currently valued using a consulting multiple. Why this price is so attractive is because if they are able to efficiently roll out their enterprise software in the future they can operate as a tech company. Then they would get a higher multiple and have a possibility of becoming a 10-bagger. Get your autistic illiterate ass away from my pump machine.
Oh they did - some things never change

If you don't like direction, you can always trade magnitude, or trade deep in your niche where the macro market doesn't matter so much

Don't worry, it'll only be a sprinkle by the time it hits shore.  Even if it goes in the direction you think it will, it still probably won't hit.
Walk more, eat less than last time

That news was out early in the day though.
Missing eps by over 500% tends to do that.  Even the McDonald's news couldn't help
You should post some DD on NIO too
How dare you
Eat less
Haha can’t penetrate the overlords
Buy SPXU or UPRO
Good

Stonks aside, Amazon needs to be put in check. Way too monopolistic and exploitative of tax and labor laws.

And the accusations in regards to their treatment of third party sellers is very real. They legitimately bring sellers on, then steal their data, customers, and even products in many cases and put them out of business. It's fucked.
Best tip to lose weight?
Silver is wild. The options pricing has simply failed to handicap risk at all this while year. Amazing for options traders being handed >1+ sigma moves every other week. Probably a nightmare for anyone obligated to provide the market.

What happened to BYND after hours? Time to buy the dip in the morning I guess
SoftBank sat on $4bn in unrealized gains and didn't take profit? They were looking to diamond hand. Rajeev and Masa are definitely one of us.
It's awful but to be fair I tried and couldn't come up with anything more appealing.
Didn’t know I needed this
Brave money tends to lose money though
Wow, crazy drop after hours. Feeling great though lol, because I sold at the peak. Looks like another opportunity to buy the dip though
sorry dont use robinhood. did you sell or are you holding?

I’ll prob buy Russell 2000 on next dip.

Worked as a contractor back in 2017.  An amazon deal fell through. There was chatter that there would be lay offs, upper management said they wouldn’t be any layoffs. The next weekend,200 people got fucked. I  graduated that summer and had a full time job lined up, so I didn’t care, but fuck em. Hope they tank  
  
Here’s more dd:  while I was there, rack was so desperate for cash, they rented out there “event” spaces to make some money. This place is the size of a small town mall, so you can imagine they barely made their monthlies. And after the cycles of firing they hired fresh babies out of devry and hall mark university for sub $17.  
  
I just googled rac to see what’s up with them, they’ve been firing people on the clock every year like donkey Kong on drums. That’s 500+ in 3 years.     
  
Tl;dr: 25c eoy
Yeah covered puts which would turn into wheels centered around $17-$18 until the situation develops. Just started it this week with $10,000 allocated for the play with a goal of 25% over two months which by then the opportunity is probably exhausted and it's time to move it elsewhere. Not sure how it'll develop. Nio was amazing and I got about 33% but I stopped at $22 because I couldn't quantitatively justify it, much to my dismay lol
You gotta pay interest on business loans and they secure the loan against your personal assets so it doesn’t make much sense to me since I’m more of a digital nomad than a homeowner

I'm here to make you feel good man, don't worry.

I'm a europoor. The biggest Airbus bull you can imagine. At the recent 60e dip I pressed all my friends to get in, made some nice cash on calls.
Then I thought, oh it's a little high, maybe some puts will be good now. Next day vaccine news. Loving the pain.
What do you trade?
You’re an idiot if you think they were sitting on it. The announcement date was planned well beforehand. The winner of the election didn’t change the day that they would announce it.
This made me want to buy Beyond Meat
That sounds like a solid reason to get rid of it tomorrow.
You could’ve shorted the Nikkei from 1970-1989 and been 100% right but also lost all of your money over and over because the bubble remains bubbly longer than you remain bankably.

And threat number two is that the dollar shits itself, so even though TSLA is worth two Klondike bars in 2021, it’s still $420 a share
Well we got two months so
Maybe the rest of the trading day will be the same
Lol! You're too cute for your username
This time I'll secure my fucking profits before it turns to shit again. Hopefully it will turn green even.
why do people even trade metals anymore, shit has been dead for months
please tell me more sweet little lies...
It's funny because the day made me realize that for the first time ever. I believe Trump.

I do think they were sitting on the vaccine announcement for a week. He got played because he was a shitty person. Lesson being. Be a good person

But if that's true that would mean the vaccine got priced in last week....

Election cheating and rigging has been going on in this country for a very long time. It’s out there, but proving it on a large scale will be difficult. I view the massive mail in voting this year the same way I view working from home....Americans have been working from home since March now, and half the time we are either drunk or fucking around. I would bet The same kind of crap has been surrounding the mail in voting, drive-through voting and any other COVID style voting that took place this year.

Very interesting take. Yea I agree it feels much lower risk to be in a sub $30 stock. More room to grow. How have you been making your 5% premium? Covered calls?
The problem is that is illegal for Americans to hold stock in Chinese companies.

So, NIO is a holding company. You're not *really* buying shares in the company.

If you trust putting your money into a holding company for a Chinese company, then you do you. I say fuck that, personally.
I will as well

It’s not high carbon you fucking moron. It uses up 99% less land water and resources than its equivalent meat counterpart. Do I need to explain it you like a baby?

Electric Car Sales More Than Double In World's Biggest EV Market, But Tesla Lags

> It’s easier to convince people to eat fake chicken and fake meat, foods that they were BORN eating, then telling them to eat beans and potatoes,

So you finally admit that the whole point of creating high carbon footprint vegan food is for inflexible people who can’t or don’t want to figure out how to put something other than meat in their mouths.
Daily reminder that Trump is going to win after exposing targeted election fraud. 

Also, what do I get? I have 33K in cash to spend.
I'm fascinated with RIDE, the smallcap that the Diamondpeak SPAC claimed. They requisitioned a GM plant in Cleveland and converted it into an EV pickup truck plant that runs on electric motors directly housed in the wheels. Did my DD and they're gonna make it, but why I like it is because I can collect some massive premium in this sub-$30 chop until they convert from engineering revision to mass production.  It's a free 5%/wk in my optimistic opinion. Once it hits $30 the situation changes and I'll play with XPEV and Li or Nio depending on how earnings go.

This PFE vaccine news complicates things. I'm not sure if I trust the sector rotation into value stonks yet, but I also don't want to miss out. Nothing feels safe.

Therefore I might have to be gay for a little while until things become more clear. If I make any moves tomorrow it will probably be puts on something that feels top heavy at open tomorrow.

Laws in the UK prevent them from saying anything until regulators have made a definitive statement of its effectiveness and have reviewed phase 3 trials - hence no AstraZeneca news as they’re just wrapping up P3. They’re all grinning their tits off though.

So do I hold or sell? I bought it far out to avoid IV crush.

Vega is .44. I figured theta being low it wouldn’t move so fast
Mmmmmmm sweet italian
They tend to do this at open
You are way too impatient my friend
When a stock opens up 4% the IV is thru the fucken roof people expect it to keep gapping up and if it doesn’t you get fucked
Looking good for the morning. Surprising.
yeah I probably should. Even if the price climbs, the drop in IV would probably cancel out the climb, so yeah, I think I'll sell mine before the earnings. We did already hear how many they sold this last quarter (or was it month?) so I don't think there's much earnings beat that will be beyond what we expect, so I think selling and getting back in after earnings with lower IV is a good idea. I'm gonna try to keep track of what the IV is before and after earnings too.
I dunno
This is the way.

I said Christian communism. With monarchist tendencies. The state would be abolished in technical terms, but a monarch would govern.   

Of course “exploitation” in a literal sense would continue, but will Christians freely exercise their faith and rightfully impose it on others? Yes.   

Listen, SoyBitch. I’m not talkin’ about your boring old communism. I’m talking about revolutionary Jesus.

Buddy. Those pigs need to be processed. Local doesn’t mean shit. Just because something is in your proximity doesn’t change its micro nutritional value on a cellular level. Animals need to be processed. Go to his fucking farm and watch the process. They’re probably gassed or tased then bolted, then have them washed, disinfected, tossed on the assembly line and removed of puss and any other intrusions. Just because meat is “unprocessed” doesn’t remove the environmental impact or the impact on your health
Ok sheep

Always a good sign when companies IPO with fuck tons of debt. Wonder what mismanagement practices couldve possibly led to that happening. At least the big hogs see value in them, doing better than RKT - therefore cannot go tits up.

My opinion they offer a lot more coverage and insight. The 24-Hour Live Media Stream is a Bonus. If you follow Futures or Foreign equities its a layup.
Up or down, the answer is always the same: hedge fund manipulation

It's the only explanation for a huge volume spike in futures, unless there is some huge news even or something.

Yeah well I buy an actual piece of meat, not processed shit. And I buy it from my local butcher who buys his whole pigs from local farmers. My butcher won an award the past 4 years for best butcher in Flanders and I'll be damned if it is processed any more than just cutting the right piece from the animal.   
It's on you if you choose to eat processed shit, real or fake meat, processed is pretty shit.

vaccine must be stored at very low temperatures, so distribution will be very tricky

50% of people wont take because why. Gates himself said in interview he doesnt want older people to be vaccinated because of side effects appearing in much higher numbers in them. and why should young people then take it when in us way too many of young people do not live with family members?

if people dont spend money, the industries you talk about are dead. like 100% dead. aside of utility bill and groceries i spent between march and november 60 bucks. sure i am an extreme but there are people who spent in past all they made and now they dont go to cinema, to sport arenas and so on and they are flush with money and dont spend it. if that kind of "spending" is now new normal, and boy people learn fast to switch their new routine and not spend, when all the industries reopen people will probably just dont go in there. when people got comfortable in their home gym/media room they made for pandemic, you think they will want to go out again? maybe few times, but then they start preferring their home

also nearly anyone who lives and visits his elderly parents family members regularly, stops going to cinemas/gyms and so on and even if 40% of young people do it, you can close many small shops permanently
How can you regret that? Wtf

I agree that beyond burgers in a way are non essential, the same way slim Jim’s or Oreos are non essential, nobody fucking needs them in their diet. But they’re an alternative to the meat heavy western world of mostly meat for every meal, and arguably one of the most popular cuisine and culture branded in our modern society, “the burger” . Beyond from the get go is advertised for omnivores, not vegans, it’s advertised as a plant based alternative to meat. Not a vegan burger for vegans. Calling food plant based food tech a waste of technology capital etc is ignorant as fuck considering it’s helping shape the future of Earth. Food tech (fake meat) isn’t just for burgers, they’re cultivating REAL meat from cells made from animals, literally real chicken meat, grown from a cell. These are vital processes and tools to help shift the masses perspective on food. This “highly engineered food” has many applications, including healthier and more sustainable food for pets. It’s easier to convince people to eat fake chicken and fake meat, foods that they were BORN eating, then telling them to eat beans and potatoes, do I need to tell you that too? Do some fucking research so I don’t have to explain this fundamental shit to you. Stop being anti science.

Hmmm I have a feeling it might rally some gains but sell off after event.
11/4 -> 11/9 saw a ~20% increase. I don't think a run up back to $15 is unreasonable with consoles coming this week.
Latest earnings report has AAL cashflows -> cash down to 253 (290 if you include short term/restricted) from 310. That's 9 mo ending Sept 30.

Probably got what, 2 years left self-sustained with no change and more w/ BRRRRRRRR.

Its not pretty but they shouldnt be going bankrupt.

The model airplane folks at the European control are forecasting \~75-80% of 2019 air traffic back by 2022, with a 2021/2022 vaccine which'll slow down the incineration of AAL tendies a bit.

Yes/no to kelly criterion. The philosophy of proportional allocation is a crucial takeaway, but that only works if you have a margin for error (long portfolio) and assumes way more rationality than this current market is capable of offering.

Today was an excellent learning moment at the open... Dont paper hand trades in the first Half Hour. Many got their "Limit" trades accepted but not executed in a reasonable amount of time. This gave MMs the opportunity to front run Executions and pocket the spreads making HUGE BANK. If you tried to rescind or adjust your Limit order, you were denied.

Well I go back/forth and I’m sure many others do to...
Because whoever bought the contracts would be able to buy SPY shares at $363, instead of the market value of $365 (which is how much SPY was when he sold).



So that person could then either hold his SPY shares after getting a slightly better entry point, OR sell his shares at the market value of $365, thus making a profit of $2 per share.
I'm a bear. Did well yesterday. I hedge with shares and some calls
So it’ll win eventually ?
I don’t have as big of a trading volume as you appear to, so I havent even bothered trying yet.

i’m smelling a gmc announcement by Christmas day, my nuts are tingling and the hairs are protruding through the fabric of my boxers as we speak. $40c 12/24

That’s seems a tad aggressive. Tbh I still don’t know when the console cycle rally is supposed to start (if it even does). 

It feels a little late right now.
Meh. What I'm really excited about is I'm going to eat my first McRib in a decade December. Unless I die by gunshot or car crash first
must I settle just for imagining it 😖
Yes it sucks.
Making technically engineered veggie burgers for vegetarians is frivolous use of industrial processes, energy and capital. If you can’t handle giving up burgers, you shouldn’t lecture people about food. Just eat your fucking beans and rice bowl and stop pretending that an industry for highly engineered food, so that some vegan tards can pretend in their legumes are cool, is responsible climate mitigation, junk food boy

they’re prob just too far OTM and improperly timed
Yeah so that's my point, lol. NY post is literally a right wing propaganda tabloid.

You can't push a conspiracy theory manufactured by the right wing media, then accuse anyone of disputing it as being "leftist." That's insane.

Yeah I got fucked today. My first time really holding a leap. Something like a 230c 1/15 or 21 I forgot and don’t want to open the app to check lmao. I honestly still have faith, would be a good time to average down but I don’t want to deposit any more money. Just going to hold until earnings and see how that goes. Lot of WFH stocks suffered from vaccine news. I think they’ll bounce back strong.

Edit: I bought at 218.

Yeh I think so. Interview with their exec, he basically praised Pfizer and said well done. I don’t think he’d be praising a competitor unless they were going to release positive results soon. NHS preparing to receive in December suggests positive news this month also. I’ve got a lot of shares yesterday and some Jan calls.
His buying power suggests he exited all positions. I truly hope he doesn't yolo $500K

Yes, I understand what you’re spitting yung king.  But what I’m saying is there’s a correct way to gamble. 

The strategy part involves gaining options exposure with small accounts but w/o losing intense sleep. 

When you get a good read on a stonk that you’ve been tracking the ranges of, then by all means make some bigger moves. But knowing how to win properly is a skill that most average motherfuckers won’t understand.

The vaccine is just hype news though. Take the companies that popped, and buy puts for their next earnings. They will still bomb them. The vaccine won't be out, and its 90% effective, but 80-90% of people don't even have symptoms so the vaccine is really only minimally effective.

This question makes no sense so I cannot answer.
Index, vix, overall p/c ratio is pretty neutral right now as in not too biased to either side, HOWEVER, equity p/c ratio is pretty biased to the bullish side and I’m guessing this is heavily weighed by tech calls, therefore I’m assuming tech will not uptrend this week and at best trade sideways while selective names may continue to trend down to find near support levels > guess my point is...u need to read its charts and be selective about which tickers u trade in which direction (on a side note I do like 🍏itm/ntm calls this week amongst techs and possibly on Thursday buying the dip on the most overly sold tech/stay at home stonk)
Been a wild year.  At the very least, most people here can say they traded it and I think that is good for the market.
Can't argue against either of those. I had the privilege of using a Herman Millar. You won't regret it. Not used the Haworth Fern but it looks similar, and similar price point, to our Stealcase office chairs and they are effortlessly comfortable.

Are you trying to explain that the world needs a high carbon footprint veggie burger? Frivolous use of technology for recreation, entertainment and pleasure industries should be the first place to look for climate change cuts. Beyond meat is beyond non-essential

Yes. I’m glad you are thinking about it now on how to not lose $10,000. 

I would strongly recommend meeting with an advisor at Fidelity, buying low cost mutual funds for the rest of your life. It will be the greatest choice you’ve ever made.

You traded a debit spread on a biotech stock in the most volatile sector in the market. An iron condor is literally the worst possible play here. You swung at the strike 3 in the dirt with a golf club for a bat.

And even if it were accurate and Taiwanese people were freaking out, how on earth would some Taiwanese people having political opinions affect the semiconductor industry?

Anyway most cross-straight relations academics agree that Trump is bad for Taiwan, as constantly antagonizing China increases the likelihood of aggression on Taiwan. Some people in Taiwan are just misinformed and buying into pro-trump CCP propaganda.

I can make $100 a day with $200, but every time I try to go big it fucks with my strategy. The best plays I’ve made this year (including catching ACB for election) have been the result of absolute zero effort or DD. 

That’s just how the market is currently. If it changes back to thetafuck mode a la 2018, I’ve done this long enough to adapt. Could leg into credit spreads, for example.
Red tomorrow is still crazy up. Don’t buy into the WSB dipshittery. The market is only green this week. Expect a slight pullback next week and then an explosion during the thanksgiving week with a slight sell off right before December. A massive run from dec 1-19 then a drop by Jan 1. Could be stagnant from Jan 1-13 then a pump before Biden takes office.

Don't go cheap. You'll regret it and have to buy again. You don't need to spend 2k but you do need to spend 500-ish, not sure how this translates to dollars as I'm a europoor and bought in euros. 

The more adjustments it has the better. I got a mesh pan, it is great for keeping cool and keeping that swamp ass nice and dry, but it isn't as comfortable as a standard pan.

My office has Steelcase and Humanscale chairs, about €1500 a pop, my home one is not quite as comfortable but it was half the price.

I don't think it's about Biden looking good, per se, but we always hypothesized that covid might magically disappear if Biden won, and it seems that is exactly what's happening.  To be clear I am NOT saying it was fake, but they saw it as the best way to get rid of Trump, so they made it seem like airborne AIDS, then when Biden wins we get a vaccine.

Console release this week. GME pump?
Smell my thumb
Impossible is arguably better sure. I’ve had every brand of mockmeat under the sun including different mock meats from mom & pop shops or independent diners etc. while the smell mostly and the taste, are somewhat questionable, but the way it cooks on a cellular level, it’s texture pre and post cooking are the most similar to burgers on the market. I ate meat for over 20 years of my life, burgers were one of my favorite foods.  this is the closest widespread market permitting commercial product. Same with the sausage. This shit is literally in depth engineered in a lab with equipment and machinery to mimic real meat as close as possible. At the end of the day, different strokes for different folks. I respect your opinion

Yes regardless of what the strikes are, if you take a total loss on a condor.

You get assigned then they exercise it to cover the difference.

The only way you take a greater than max loss is when the stock is exercised and assigned and the price fluctuate between the strikes.

It can happen with very poor management
Last week they were bear for the election but it bull to ath lol

tech getting cucked yet again
Alot of the Tech stocks took a beating because its not realistic for them to sustain the numbers they are doing once things get back to normal. And the mass isnt going to be working from home as much anymore, if the vaccine is rolled out. Aka they were valued high under the assumption that people are going to be working from home for the foreseeable future. Since vaccine could mean “return to normalcy”, alot of the the tech stocks are retracting.
Imagine thinking we will be red tomorrow 😂
So true. I can’t even run ms teams properly on my work computer. I use a personal laptop so it will actually load. 🤦🏻‍♂️

I don’t know if we hold past tomorrow, but we shall feast on the tendies of those who keep buying calls in shitty overvalued tech companies before hibernating once more
Ok, I’m thinking about it now. My spread was from $310 to $315. BIIB closed at ~$328.

BIIB $328
$310 Sell - $7.35
$315 Buy - $6.48

Now that I think about it, both of these should have expired worthless, since the price was $328.

I guess whoever owned them EoD exercised them at a loss to avoid a greater loss?

Robinhood failed to exercise the other half automatically and let it expire instead

You must have been able to buy at your leisure in a non-competitive market.

If you tried doing that in, for example, the San Francisco Bay Area - you would either never be able to afford anything that comes close to your criteria, or homes would constantly be bought out from under your nose while you were fussing over the details.

Affordability is the primary decider in commute distance for a great many people. A given family size, space requirements and budget will often dictate how far out from a city center someone can afford.

Yeah, I was playing those, switched to December after I cashed in my 11/20 puts today (I had no idea what to do after cashing on 11/20 puts and believing it was over. Do I chance the strike target up or down? I decided to move the expiry further away). Chances are very good of an overall decline till then. If it goes up it will be like a major sports upset
Say positions or ban and ping a mod or two if you'd like to challenge an OP. I could make a bot to execute OPs who don't answer a challenge of some kind if you'd like.

SPCE April or January OTM calls
My thoughts, AstraZeneca are going to be next pharma to announce positive vaccine results. They are ramping manufacturing, NHS have prepared to receive dose in December, and trial results have all been positive. They were leading the race until a halt in trials due to health issue that was subsequently shown to be unrelated to vaccine.
We have dropped after the past two events. I don’t think this will be any different
That one ticker that is gonna send a retard to space
OP is fucking retarded. I hate this sub. Robinhood either assigned him the shares and then (didn’t?!?!?) exercise the 310P and it went just missing or something.

The max loss on this trade is 5-1.7. You don’t just get assigned on a bear call spread without exercise and assignment.

Being assigned a short put and getting ass raped would be hilarious. Imagine giving someone 30,000 to let them figure it out independently.

Yea, it's probably going to end up being speculative about whether there's a broader push to reduce operating costs by encouraging part time or full time work from home. If nothing else, the lock downs have proven that for computer driven jobs its possible to cut rent expenses, flip side of that being that the long term support needed would be on the tech and cloud side of things. Techs always been ramping, its just been given it's time to shine, and I dont think any of the companies in tech have hit market cap with the amount of growth just from RnD that's left. Bit of a ramble but i think this largely whats been behind the tech drive and what will continue to support it.

Conversely commodities are driven by consumer demand and have less long term growth opportunity unless its a new disrupter coming into the market. Still lots of room/growth to go to get back to pre-covid demand, but more of a cieling than with tech in the long term imo.

^^^^vvvvv None of these retards understand that FoodTech/Plant based science for (mainly) environmental reasons (also nutrition, ethicality)  growing consciousness and awareness are objectively the future of human sustainability and that we don’t want to fucking go extinct just to farm cows pigs chickens etc by slowly running out of oxygen or a plethora of other environmental disasters (due to global warming) there’s dead zones the size of countries in our seas due to animal poop being washed into the ocean where no life can live, our bees our dying , our coral are dying, we’re over fishing (understatement) we’re down to a handful of species and we’ve wiped out like 78% of biodiversity on our planet effectively causing extinction to thousands of different species of animals, half of the worlds surface area is fucking stupid soy and grain to feed to these animals kept in captivity, most of the “garbage” in the ocean is actually fishing equipment (over 70% to be exact) and all we can say is “burgers doe”. In relation to Food Tech, BYND, and the stock market. BYND is leading the race in this sector as is Tesla leading the race EV. It is indeed over valued, they’re losing money etc. But on a 10-40 year timeline they’re going to be worth thousands per share.

Bud did you actually realize a 10k loss? There’s no technical way unless you closed out independently. At expiry, max loss is max loss.

XYZ $100

$105 Sell

$110 Buy

I don’t give a fuck if the stock is at 1,000 at expiry. You can’t lose more on assignment.
This can be you. Do it!

Looking at the last day of SPY chart looks like a drunk that jumped up the stairs and then fell backwards back down them, hitting his head on every step on the way down. It hurts to look at and I’m ashamed to still be looking at it, and I’m scared to try and help it back up.
I can only tell everyone that PLTR is a solid company and theres no justification for betting against Peter Thiel at this time. 

If you want to day trade then go ahead but if you want a long term stock then add PLTR to your portfolio and enjoy the profits.

SPY to 500 by the end of the week.
I don’t disagree with that, but it’s more nuanced in practice. Try to limit yourself to stocks that are heavily oversold on the 100 dma

Here’s why I like PFE btw: dividend yield is more attractive than any of the other vaccine producers. I don’t know why anyone would get rid of it other than to take profits.
This numbers to low , my balls will go bigger exactly to my gains and shitty losses.

For just a moment I want you to imagine you’re a thirteen year old boy. You live alone with your mother. You’ve hit puberty. All these hormones rushing around inside you, so much, tension. You’ve never had much luck with girls, always in the “friend zone”. You think you’ve found a girl you really like and she likes you back. This was not true, she rejects you. You wonder why? You lose this friend. There is no one to talk to. Rejection after rejection. One girl even says you smell. This morphs you. You begin to enjoy being made a fool of by the unattainable creatures you so adore. You discover different genres of pornography. It starts with feet, then femdom, the hardcore Bdsm, Cucking. These genres of pornography influence you so to the point a normal relationship doesn’t even seem appealing anymore. Now years have past, constantly getting off to these fantasy’s. You’ve listened to hours of sissy hypno, dunked your head into your piss filled toilet while masturbating, put on make up, and sent thousands of dollars to random women online because they tell you to and that’s the only way you can get off other than role playing with gay dudes online and you don’t even know if you’re gay or not. Imagine that lol
PUMP ET
In the short term looks like calls. Long term get puts until a vaccine is confirmed.
Bruh I’m saying tho
It’s about to meme harder than ever.

Is there anything you bought today? I felt like tech got pumped up 10-20% last couple days so at 5% off you’re still buying high
That comment of someone winning $500,000 off of a scratch ticket made me realize my 23 year old retarded ass would 100% no doubt lose it in 10 minutes from yoloing a 0DTE call at the top and watch it drop and be like “these ain’t no paper hands” and watch my call and myself expire worthless the next day
What to buy? Puts or calls?

I mean they are, unless they literally stage a coup wtf are they gonna do? And if we ever got to that point; how the fuck would you price that in, you’d have to sell off to infinity.
Do you remember there was this dude on here about a month or so ago that went from 1k to 800k twice and then bet everything on slack earnings? Well he said to buy calls 2 months out on stocks that drop more than 20%

I’ve been a perms bull since before the March crash, I sold all my calls today.
>  if it tastes the same as meat and costs the same

Which it doesn't and it doesn't.

And even if it did, it's still already priced at half the value of the second largest meat producer in the country. Where is the upside?
I’m holding a 137 P it’s LIT. I’m hoping for a sell of in. The morning and dumps more

All my test results came back today -- 32 year STD-free streak remains unbroken!  I was pretty scared tbh.

He seemed fairly convinced I'd given it to him.

ya i bought thursday morning, sold friday morning for 350% return

almost a 10 bagger but i don't have 50k to yeet on spy options like half the people here
Even red blooded bulls took profits today. I was shopping for SPY 400c and I took some profits. There’s no reason to be surprised it let off a little steam.
UVXY is a constantly decaying product due to something called contango which I must admit I don’t fully understand but it has to do with how the vix is priced based on IV of two consecutive months of SPY options. In fact, they have to reverse split uvxy every few years just because it has decayed 99.9% since its inception like 13 years ago or some shit like that. If you look at the chart you can see it spikes violently with crazy news but then decays. You only see spikes, it never stays high for long because that’s not how it works. So if you buy calls today and wait a few weeks hoping for a spike in vol by the time the spike finally happens it has already decayed way below your strike price.

Honestly I feel like people often want to play uvxy as a way to bet shit is gonna to wild in the market. But honestly SPXY or spy puts are prob better hedges that actually inversely correlate with the market. Uvxy has the decay issue and also the fact that it doesn’t necessarily always go up when the market goes down and vice versa.

Real talk i made back all the money i had previously lost. I'm now looking to either get leaps or buy stonks (yes i know gay) with roughly 80% of my portfolio and still gamble with the remaining 20%.

Because, fuck. bears.

Over how? We all will get it. I had it, I literally shoved shop towels in my nose and between by buttcheeks and slept a week. It's not fun, but just protect the old and sick, also your leather chairs. On a serious note, given the speed of the spread; vaccines, treatments, and herd immunity will probably knock this out before your leaps expire.

But its free, so the company will force employees to use it.

This is one of my favorite stocks because of the way it moves tbh. Very predictable.
Given their ER yesterday BYND doesn't deserve it's multiple quite frankly. It's growth is like that of a boomer stonk

It dipped to 103 yesterday. Scalped 100 shares for a quick 1.2k gain.

As far as calls I'd wait until open to see If the algos buy or dump it.

My PT for BYND is $80
What’s the rest look like?
So the military will distro the vaccination via “operation warp speed.” The military is also getting our asses handed to us by covid so we are using MS Teams non-stop and only using it more. Current contract is thru Dec and that shit needs to be renewed soon...but basically every soldier boy and girl will have to have an account  so msft be making pretty pennies. 
Also, they continue to ban Zoom at most installations.

Anyone else thinking COVID-19 practically over by march-april 2021?
You’re misunderstanding. 94 patients that received the vaccine got covid. About 940 patients that received placebo got covid or whatever equivalent as I don’t know the ratio of treatment to placebo group. If a large swath of the population was vaccinated with that level of protection it would largely wipe out the disease.
No thanks. People need facts.
Young and dumb ones are caught up in things like status etc. Except, of course, they probably don't have any real status, so tearing down other people will make up for it.

It's the estrogenic side of a controlling dude that smacks his girls around.

Have they got a new deal with McDonald’s?
I’ve been bagholding for a call on DIS ever since I bought it two days before the September crash. I’ve been telling myself if it ever got to 80% I’d sell, and today it shot up to 130% (from 20%). Sold the sucker and missed out on another 45% of growth.

Still, I think I made the right decision to follow my rule, as much as I wish I had those gains. Just happy to have my money back lol
Is your name soy referring to the spanish translation of “I am”? Or is it referring to Soy as in the substance used for food? Because it could mean “I am gone” or “the soy is gone”, I think the latter is a false statement. You are made purely of soy. Can I send you a bag of hairy feces through USPS?
Imagine being dumb enough to buy calls after a vaccine announcement sends the market up 5%

Polarizing the country, and pulling us out of the Paris climate agreement with no replacement. I could say a lot more on what he didn't do, like not dumping money into education. Not reforming welfare systems. Not attacking big pharma. And many more.

Hippy drama is the worst drama
Biden didn’t even win Kamala did. They’re going to sacrifice Biden. A coven of witches that consists of Hillary Clinton, Kamala, AOC, Polosi, and that Muslim senator are going to ritualistically sacrifice Biden’s old decrepit corpse in the Oval Office. They will then proceed to get naked and bathe in his blood and begin the orgy. And it will be so super inspiring to women and young girls. Stunning and brave

According to the philosopher Plato we are all prisoners trapped in a cave tied to a wall. There is a fire behind us, people are walking and talking but all we see are shadows projected onto a wall. All our lives we believe this is the only one true reality there is. We believe those shadows are actual people and the sounds are coming from those shadows.

When we are set free and look behind us at the fire and see the people we refuse to believe they're real. We leave the cave and see actual things, but instead we choose to return to the cave preferring to see the shadows.

Emergency use authorization to use a medication doesn’t mean FDA approval. Emergency use authorization is done similarly to a clinical trial (hospital needs IRB approval eventually, etc.). It’s just a faster way to get a non-FDA approved drug to a patient who needs it on a case-by-case basis. We use compassionate use drugs such as this when there is no commercially available alternative to treat the current patient case at hand.

Again, not an FDA approval meaning that it has not been FULLY reviewed for efficacy or safety. Not FDA approved means this is provided for free to the patient/no monetary gains.

Yesterday was an insane overreaction due to:

*No approval yet for the vaccine

*Still a small sample size, although great news

*Distribution will be a nightmare due to logistics and amounts needed to distribute

*Mass immunity is still a long while away even if approved by year end

*COVID spiking worldwide and lockdowns re-occuring and a vaccine being 6-18 months out doesn't help all these travel companies that popped yesterday

*Unemployment is still crazy

*Real-estate still being held up by forbearance

On the other hand, who the hell knows. We'll probably be green by open.

This is true fyi, all my friends and I bought it when it hit the market out of curiosity and after trying it we said yeah not bad guess it kinda tastes like meat and then never bought it again lol
I’m in leaps down 20% lol

maybe ge?
Hold eet!
SPCE calls any OTM January/April

The point I'm trying to get across is you're expecting a market to buy cars. I'd assume you know friends in middle class--do any of them have a tesla? It's the same logic here. Just because the product is there, doesn't mean there's buyers.   
5x the population of US will definitely increase the chance of buyers, but they're not printing cars to the middle class.   
Monthly payment for a 5 year purchase of a new Toyota "high end" car was 40k for me. A telsa would've been doubling my payment monthly at least.
Im really sad about the massive damage Etsy and Fiverr have received. Shit could have wiped me out.

If you’re already down 70% might as well hold tbh. Banks and airlines will not stay green the whole week

My take: Buy more now, wait for more drop, buy further more. Wait till Biden starts sucking Chinese and Europeans again and BYND's expansions are going to pay off. 

TLDR: Buy in noobs, tendies are going to rain

I'm in Canada too, weird. For me on betway it was those odds I mentioned.
Why
You'd have 10 in intrinsic value, so yes.
it opened up 7.5% higher yesterday. if u sold ur calls at open u would have made tendies. whats wrong with that?
Sucks for those retards that should it at $15

This is pretty much every vaccine btw, there are a few outliers but cold chain logistics have been around forever and one of the first things factored into vaccine releases. I wouldn't bother with fridges personally, because the infrastructure \*should\* already be there.

Closed out 128 contracts of NIO $32 two weeks ago on Tuesday for $2400. Two days later worth 25k.
Was like 1 click away from buying $10K worth of SPY puts expiring 11/20....was at a spot price of 360 and were at the money puts priced at around $5 each. Shit will probably be worth $40K before expiration and I blew it
why did they give the sausages foreskins?
You right, I’m only 19 so I think I could sell a kidney and day trade without being flagged
we keepin RKT through earnings or nah?
Dude. I owned nio shares at 1.5 and sold at 3ish. It happens. Satisfy with your profits. From that day onwards instead of selling the call I am selling a lower price call and making it a spread. At least I can gain money if the spread is ITM at exp.
My calls approve. Except SNAP, 41.5p would appreciate that shit to tank. 💰

No not that.
Last question so if it opens red do I take the 5k or more loss straight off the bat or should I hold them for another few weeks and let it ride

You have more than a whole year. Sit tight, even if it dips after earnings read the report. If they had good earnings and good guidance you’re fine. It’ll recover, fill the gaps and go on to new highs. You’re invested in NIO now whether you like it or not buying leaps.

I dont know if this makes you feel better, had NIO $32 calls which I sold for 2500, were worth $20k the next day. Later sold CGC 20.5 calls for 130, were worth 2k the next day. On Friday, sold SPY$355 calls for $1250, were worth over 10K today.

Thing about NIO, I have done DD, multiple times... and laughed every time it went up after like $28... I moved on from this primitive logic... bought in, and have been flipping 100-200%'s every week... for awhile now.

It doesnt make sense, but it goes up... move on from thinking it wont, and you will be a much happier trader.. It will fall eventually, but unless you have leaps close to the money, you probably wont catch it, and if you do, you probably wont profit much..
What do we play when NIO hype is done?
Plz run it up I get some 30c need some loving
They have dumped in the last 2 weeks bruh
DOCU. Anyone getting in on the dip?
Immigrants can be divided into many groups. The h1b is where I’d challenge the “bad-ness of immigration”. I don’t really understand the hate for Mexican immigration, but maybe I’m missing something. 
    
    H1-b immigration is intended to recruit from skilled labor pools that the US lacks in resourcing for lack of better word (very prevelant in tech). The program has been completely abused with low skilled foreign workers whose roles can easily be filled by college students (think operations and support). 

To make matters worse, In many cases these h1b contract workers have very little power and employees can grab and toss them at will. This makes them more attractive then US based citizens despite the cost premium in many cases

Lastly and this one is more from personal experience, I’ve seen many ppl promote h1b hires for no reason other than to support their home country. This has a domino effect
I sold my 11/13 11.5c Palantir calls for a measly 80% gain last Tuesday.
I mean everything tech got entirely dumped today. Safe to say once people realize they aren’t getting a vaccine when they wake up tomorrow things will shift back to tech. 3 weeks out calls ...might be safe enough. Don’t listen to me though I’m retarded.

90% effectiveness, Fauci was shooting for 70%. Chances are there will be different strains, but it will likely get approved. Different strains and sheer quantity demanded keeps the door open to all other manufacturers though.
Well, probably won’t happen tomorrow 😂
NIO this china stock broke the technical chart and it doesn't even move any more after 5% pumps every day for 2 weeks. This shit will come down and will be limp like TESLA for a few years for how much it got pumped up just like JKS

That's true. I feel a lot of that is overstated though... I live in the UK and there have been Muslims in the UK since the 70s when they first started arriving. Most politicizes and radicalised Muslims are not to be those first generation Muslims who don't speak a word of English, but young Muslims born in the west. At the same time you also see a lot of them becoming liberals and westernised with their own meshed culture. What is obvious to me though is they've turned their backs on their original culture - which is harmless (though less integrable) but morphed it into something new in the West for better and worse.

Super annoying if you’re away from your phone too. The premium is well worth the zero ads.
good, if you already have them.  But no sense in shortdating them tbh, just 3 weeks/month at least, baghold, and sell when they are up, which they likely will be at some point at least.

VXX is permahedge more than anything tbh.
id say yes sell if theyre green because theres (much) better ways to play energy. Look at the OAS distressed debt or buy longer dated calls on better oil/gas companies

Because it’s an ADR of shares that trade in Tokyo. The ADR tracks the underlying asset (Nintendo stock) but only trades during US hours. So depending on what Nintendo does on the Tokyo exchange - jumps at open
Pzifer’s 90% vaccine isn’t the reason the market is exploding.

Shit doesn’t get approved unless it’s 99.9% reason being the amount of death from a .1% error is more than the current covid death count in the US. 

Market is soaring due to republicans abandoning  gay bear mango.

Vaccine is nothing. Get off the fake hype train and ride the real shit. Biden = futures up.

The idea that covid will be over next year is laughable. We’re 1/3 the way there

Who was awake at open this morning? I hope chucky schwab steps on legos fucking cocksucker I had accounts open at vangaurd and TD by noon
Cash on the sidelines doesn’t equal trading liquidity. If anything, the fact that they’re still waiting to buy in means that they’re anticipating something large to happen
There are 1.4M people in the US with net worth over 10M, but Ferrari still only sells a few thousand per year in the US.

Sometimes I don't want to do "Insert task here". If I want an American to do it, they want health insurance and a 401k. If I grab some undocumented labor from the Maralago, I can pay less but it is still better money than that employee would receive for a similar task in their home country. They can send money home, at a VERY good exchange rate. Their kids eat, I get to browse reddit. I like undocumented immigrants as much as I like undocumented guns, a lot. Try to unpack this statement.

I would have waited until after ER. They're gonna run up to $50 this week and probably dump back to low $40s after 11/17. Sell before the weekend and then buy back in after that. Maybe hold onto 1 or 2 so you don't have FOMO if it moons.

OK, perhaps government bonds with a return over 30 years that is greater than the interest rate would work out.

But what other products could one be "investing" (I think government bonds stretch the concept of investment already) in? Also, many (if not all) government bonds in the EU are already negative. So, perhaps that still only works with USD denominated debt.

FUD. Of course vaccines take time that’s why FDA has multi year approval process that we bypassed. The trials are by the books, if there is even the slightest side effect, the solution is non viable. Having said that this disease still has a fraction of a fraction of a percent death rate so i won’t be springing to go get the vaccine

I do agree that space tourism it is not necessary but neither is buying a luxury car, yet there is a demand for them. The same will be for space tourism. Also, affordable depends on the person, I can't afford either. However, there are over 1.4 Million people in the United States alone who have a net worth of over 10 Million USD. Even if only a small percentage have the liquidity and interest to pay a 250k space ride ticket, that means there is demand and affordability.

No one knows who invented it. There’s a finite amount of it to be “mined” via complicated data encryption that requires a lot of processing power. I think I saw an estimate that in 100 years or so there will be none left to “mine”. Big banks and companies are starting to buy in and it’s been on a tear recently, it’s coming close to reaching its previous peak in 2017 when people rushed in and then it dumped hard

You can get leverage by buying highly levered companies.

E.g. AMC either blasts back up to 5x current (half pre-March) or goes to zero. The same is true of most high debt to earnings/equity companies.

Before March, highly levered companies way out-performed S&P500 over the previous 10 years.

it wasn't just the vax. stimulus details came out.  look at the headlines.

"Markets soar to record highs after upbeat vaccine data, Biden victory"

you had news and details on the stimulus today also. a great day for America. 

For bulls it couldn't have been a more perfect day. until you realize that two of the biggest catalysts bulls had been banking on blew their loads on the same day.

Same with FSLY. I bought some at $55, then more at $75, then more at $80 and held it all the way to $130. My greedy ass said no, I could use more profit.

Oh, and same with PTON. Shares at $70 and decided that I wanted to hold it longer. But have confidence in them unlike FSLY which is the worst stock in history.

FML both some of my largest positions too. I have like 400 shares of FSLY.

There will always be more opportunity, and no one ever went broke taking profits while they were still around.
What is "your"?
VIX is not actual volatility. it's tracking SPX options. since options for a future event it's for the expectation of future volatility. but it's not just based off of news.

SPX got forced into a narrow channel. that reduced potential movement and thus suppressed volatility.

VIX is below actual SPX volatility.

Yeah, I think you're really getting into the meat of the issue here. 

I think that there is pent up demand once reopening happens and there will be a snapback post-vaccination; maybe not to previous highs but faster recovery than people expect (2024 for air travel recovery just seems wayyyyyyy off to me-- ppl wanna get out and vacay after quarantine, plus business travel will resume). Obviously, theres still risk with the stocks, but markets price in future expectations which are only going to be improving. Regardless, there will still be more economic activity than there is right now, so inflation. The supply destruction will be the major driver of oil price rallies specifically. 

Agree on banks; but also important to consider they have the best liens on assets and as a result have ended up owning a lot of distressed assets through ch 11 that will recover now -- JPM already hiring energy execs to run some of these businesses

Not saying theres gonna be a hard flip in tech (though there could be) but in the short term i do expect maybe a few rotations from growth to value that savvy traders can take advantage of; i dont see what pushes tech valuations up like the vaccine did with cyclicals so its momo or bust

Haha we would've probably been great friends if we lived near by since we seem to think a like :) I don't have a house yet but sounds like you already bought yours (probably a good one too). If it isn't too much trouble can you give me some tips to avoid paying big closing fees?

Nah.
Holy shit. Well I guess she deserves it? She has made so many important contributions to the human species.
so we faded eod because vax pump was just another pump and there wasnt any peer reviewed data, I'm thinking these futures are just trying to create a dip to buy cheap, tech will rebound covid proof
You need to be selling options during earnings.  That's wsb101 right there.  Also that's only 100%  you need to have 110% at least.

No, because your L’s in the word all are lowercase. Creep.

If you're serious my only advice is stay the fuck away from 2-3 star hotels on the Strip. 3 stars are basically a gang zone. 4 stars have the same riffraff that 2-3 stars typically have, and even 5 stars have a lot of Holiday Inn barely-middle-class scum.
This hurts to see imagine if you did the opposite of what you think is right like your supposed to and bought puts you would be a millionaire retard

Why are you assuming oil/gas/flights are going to suddenly drive back up?

Flights are still at 50% capacity and even with a vaccine arn't projected to get back to pre-covid highs pre-2024. There may be some short term speculative tendies but demand is still suppressed and will be for the next while.

Throw on-top of that decreasing saturation with gas-fueled vehicles, regulation hurdles, and it's not hard to understand why the BP CEO said that they think we might've already seen peak oil consumption.

Banks will survive, they're just a bit less profitable while interest rates are low, and given the current debt bubble and the Feds commitment to low interest rates and its not hard to see why they wont be screaming back in the next 2 months - granted they are more appealing now then they were before. And this is from someone who's got \~20% of the YOLO in dumbass long holds with them.

Growth stocks may be muted, the run up needs consolidation, but i dont see a short term hard flip happening.
It’s funny that many of us are self aware when it comes to this phenomenon, yet here we are anyways. Half of people are broke and pissed off, then the rest are overpaid and still pissed off because after taxes they only have a measly $60,000 a year income. The human species is full of retards, top to bottom. Someone’s salary or car doesn’t at all dictate whether they are a tribalistic chest thumping idiot, even though we wish the system actually rewarded people for critically thinking. Fuck it right, I pray for nuclear war everyday. Let’s just get this shit over with.
If it’s at $150 in 5 years, you’ve still almost quadrupled your investment in a short amount of time... I’ve had 300 shares since $25 and just letting them ride. Probably sell
100 shares soon just to secure the bag.

Willy? Is that you?
On earnings or other uncertain events, sure. But it usually takes a week or more for IV to really crush a position, especially if it has made large moves recently.
That or maybe some extra spices for the ramen we'll have each night
that's tech bro, with news on vaccines, it was expected to go down. if anything, it should go much lower. everything tech is extremely overvalued still except a few like microsoft, facebook, amd, etc All the retard stocks like docu, zoom, okta, twillio, roku, wayfair, etc etc they should sell off some more, but the industrials and energy and other oversold stocks have nowhere else to go but up with this optimisitic outlook
Why Aren’t You Getting Along? I’ve Been Getting Along Just Fine.
Really dont know. I am still holding puts (might sell at open depending on what futures do).

There's way too much going on with the election and the vaccine to really make a confident prediction. Just gonna play it by ear and scalp tomorrow.

Probably not unless they're rehiring in other locations. Unlikely because they have a reputation for hiring top tech talent and Bay Area is the place to do that. CEO is vehemently anti remote work which suggests it's downsizing.

You need to account for IV, extrinsic, and intrinsic value. Google options profit calculator and play around with it and tweak the numbers, its the best way to learn before you blow all your money

Because they can be exercised to buy the underlying stock for less than the current price for the rest of the day.

If you have an option that lets you buy at $50 and the stock is at $55, then the option is worth at least $5. Plus they have time value since the stock could keep going up while you're holding it.

SLV January calls, 25. You’re welcome son.
Less than that, Canada pre-ordered 10 million of them.

Vaccines will take 2 doses to be "effective", estimated coverage for 13% of our population when only 0.7% of our population has been infected by it.

It's going to take a few years for the vaccine to be wide spread enough that it's not an issue. That's provided that its not something like the flu-shot that required annually - restrictions arn't going to suddenly lift.  


Nor are interest rates going to get raised given they JUST finished covering a bunch of mediocre debt.

It'll go back up.  Be up over 120 within a week.

Yeah but I believe in MUSKY. He has been again and again pulling through at the last minute and blowing people's mind. I really think it's just that the majority of the population can't see his vision but he has one and he'll figure things out.

With NIO I don't know who is captaining the ship to have such blind faith. Thanks for your explanation! :)

Also TSLA really pulled my account up when I needed it the most.

Haha not sure if true, but someone recently claimed to have bought snap on tools (SNA) thinking it was snap. But fortunately for their calls, jt rallied that day.

To be clear, though, Im not saying we are just gonna shoot down to SPY 280 in a straight line or anything.

Right now we are in this sort of "gray window" where the vaccine has shown effectiveness, but no distribution plans have been announced or anything. I don't think people generally feel like COVID is "over," yet. 

I think this process could take a while, so be careful with FDs.

If you got shares, though, I think there's a good chance you called the top. Nicely done.

Don't know yet what SNAP may do tomorrow to make that judgement also it depends on how comfortable you are with that kind of risk, I cannot determine that for you 😉
Addiction is like stray cat. If you feed it every day it comes around and scratches your door and meows loud to wake you up. But if you cut it off and never feed it again it will eventually stop coming around and leave you alone. If you feed it sometime even way way later down the road it will be right back at your door meowing and bugging you. The only chance you have of quitting anything you are addicted to and not reverting is cold turkey. Cannot drink even once in a while if you ever used to be an alcoholic. Cannot enjoy the occasional cigar if you used to smoke cigarettes.
Which is incredibly lame. America def not #1. More like America #1am

No because that's only 0.1% what the company does. They started to produce software to track and trace Covid because the demands for it. If UK had to desperately ask an America software company to analyze their own people data, do you think how powerful their products are.

I started playing civ 6 again after reading the book but I think III and V are the peak games of the series. Really just clean mechanical games all around. The book was great talking about all the fumbles he made on the way to perfecting a fun product that you could play for 6000 hours. He hated the cheat menu in civ 2 but talks about how he was wrong - giving the player access to the parameters of the game allows them to have their own fun. It opened up the path for modding. But he couldn't see it at first.

Yeah dog after losing 10k of pure profit from the Apple and Tesla crash I have been withdrawing every single winning options bet since. I withdraw the entire amount of the contract. The losers I sell and put into another call later. I’m bag holding value stocks starting 3 months ago because I don’t want to squander away my hard earned money anymore. The value stocks give me the buying power I need to sustain daily options trading and withdrawing. If you don’t know what value investing is, read The Little Book of Value Investing. My value stocks get crazy sector rotation love like today. My biggest stock position today went up %10 and I bought those shares at a STEAL.

O bro, chasing losses. I had some serious issues back in July August trying to get big profits, holding and not taking profits. I was down 35k at one stage simply by not taking my profits. Imagine being up a few grand and just diamond handing that shit until your red. Actually you don't need to imagine you did the same shit lol. Diamond hands is both a blessing and a curse I guess.

Sounds like you printing man. You just need an exit plan. Sometimes being in the money can be just as burdensome because it's hard to know when to GTFO.

I've got an idea bulls, you tell us when stonks are going to go up, we will tell you when they are going to go down and we'll both lose money together, deal?
40x cash means there's not much of a margin for error. Compare to to TSLA which is like 30x cash and they're generating free cash flow. It's a momentum stock, so it'll keep chugging higher until one day when the bottom falls out.

Thank you I've had that sitting there for like 2 months and never bothered to redraw. In that mid September area I thought it was breaking out, had the volume, but just lost traction bumping up against the 50 day (I think at that time) and PSX got absolutely liquidated. In one day today it smashed through the 10/30/50 day like swiss cheese
I just read Sid Meier's memoir and the dude is an absolute autist. He designed one of the first addictive games by accident with Civilization.  He had zero business sense and just wanted to focus on the games. His cofounder was a genius hustler who figured out how to make money off Sid's autism. It was a perfect match. Each game was just some childhood jerkoff fantasy that he got to sperg out on for years at a time. Guy loved trains. That's the basis for half the book is "yeah I like trains" or "pirates are cool" and now the guy just counts money.

Uh.. how'd that go?
My bear case theory is that market rallied and did everything everyone thought it would do a month from now but in a week. They’ve sucked us in enough and now it’s time to drop the ultimate drill.

Hopefully not because, listen closely Linda, I. Will. Never. Financially. Recover. From. This.
What expiry?
wouldn't be surprised...actually would be a little surprised since we're running out of pump juice, but we've made much bigger comebacks so I've got pretty low expectations
5900X sold out in less than 1 minute last week. Amd is coming for their lunch money.
To all the bear survivors. My portfolio may have died but if y’all can make bank then I’m happy knowing these retard bulls are fuk

Alexa play Come Down By Anderson .Paak
To put it simply, OP option expiry means “Organic Profit Option Expiry”. It means that he will make organic profit, ie. at least double his initial investment by the time his option expires. It’s a lucrative position to be in and he secured it at the precise moment for max gains. You too, can take part on these gains also but at a smaller scale. I recommend buying one-day contracts for PLTR at a strike price of around 50 dollars; keep in mind that you’ll need to GAL and spend at lease 5k in order to unlock the profit mechanism. FYI, GAL in financial terms means go all out. 

Good luck!

I've been shorting the market(in my e*trade) after we hear of vaccine news. Pretty well everytime it ends up just being BS and we get a dump afterward. The call this morning was just lucky. Slightly expected another up move to capitulate more bears.
If you asked me a couple months ago I was some hot shit. Holy shit I swear my penis was like 3 inches longer in august, but now if i see green at all it’s a good day. My friends are calling me retarded (except the funny thing is they’re all retards) and i don’t know what to do. What really gets me is when people who don’t even know how this works call me stupid. Don’t get me wrong some of the shit I do is dumb as hell and I deserve to be down here. I always seem to make the wrong decision but in actuality it’s probably me just lying to myself just like the rest of you idiots. But now my last coupe hundred dollars are on some NIO puts. So i swear everybody in this god damn bitch better make that shit red before friday or I am going to off myself.

Sure but Chinese are cheap/value buyers too. They won't buy EV cars to stop the pollution and TSLA already built it's factory there.
Autist are used to losing money.
Currently? Long on $ROPE. 

Biggest losers was a couple of calls that were *right before* the whole Iran thing. Made a little back off of earning calls for various companies. Slow trickle down as I held Oil, hoping (like an idiot) Oil would go back up once restrictions loosened, but that didn’t happen. Nail in the coffin was SPY puts immediately before the election thinking there would be unrest and uncertainty. 

Joking about $ROPE of course, it hurts but the good news is Robinhood is literally just my gambling account, so wasn’t anything I wasn’t prepared to lose. But I am going to uninstall after this lol. 

Basically I’m a fucking retard.

Look at all these desperate 🐻 crawling back in here reeeeing about -0.5 pretending the last week didn’t just happen.

Serious question. Does anyone else in here feel like they have a serious gambling problem with options? Like I legit feel sick about the amount of money I’ve lost in the past 6 months. I get that euphoric feeling when I do high risk options play, only to deflate when my money evaporates.  I was planning to buy my girl an engagement ring and pay off my student loans by the end of the year, but now it’s impossible.

Bruh you know what I just realized?

The only people still spamming “spy 400” etc are not really bulls. Real bulls know when to take profit, and didn’t miss out on the recent rally. 

The people spamming retarded takes are the retards that missed out on the rally, which means they were cash gang or something else. Aka they weren’t bulls in the first place. 

So stfu and stop crying you missed out on the rally lol. Spy is not going to 400 anytime soon.

I still have ptsd of buying rkt 30c 9/18 right before earnings and losing everything
I lost so much on the original ACB hype. Fuck that piece of shit company.
Just remember the first one is always free and I would be careful with nio around earnings
[deleted]
Wtf, do you work for Pfizer ???

SEC, this guy
But can I buy calls on those???
I wonder if any would make a good buffalo dip
Broku is the most irritating stock to trade imo
Can I get a news story one day that says stocks will be down over covid concerns or stocks will be up because of promising vaccine news. I’d really just like them to say it beforehand one time.
If I buy a PTON will I meet lots of hotties?
Friendly reminder to bundle of stick bers that we are green by open
Aaaand the post’s gone. So much for DD, guess our messiah here don’t wanna waste his time on non-believers.

Dude I'm a hardcore meat eater and I fucking loved the taste of beyond meat burgers. I wanted to eat that shit raw
Same 348s lmfao
Oof
It would be a pretty lame blowoff

Same words mumbled endlessly in casinos across the world.

You need help.
Ah. I sold put spreads before earnings, and then on the pump while still green I switched over to call spreads. Yeah it’s been in that range bound for some time now. Sadly I sold CCs last week at 460 and on the bounce I got scared and took a 2k loss, would have easily expired worthless. 

Yeah it sucked, I was doing good and then got greedy, chased losses, and diamond handed my SPY 200 P until the end lol. I bought 11/20 360P. So definitely in the money, just need the trend to continue. Should be making $1000 per point down soon :). Not to mention, my 355/360 and 361/363 spreads I sold on spy will come back down and hopefully expire worthless!
It's not a real estate company. It's real. Like Santa  Clause.
I would also shove rods down this guys dick
I would proudly accept that flair

8 out of 9 analysts rate SPCE a buy. It was an unheard of 8 out of 8 until Goldman Sachs decided to rate it neutral, in late October. Odd timing right?

SPCE will be making history in under 2 weeks. This 3rd successful powered flight will likely seal the deal for their FAA COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE!

Heh, you ain't wrong. But in my defense.

\- My lady wanted to live closer to her parents.

\- I live in a pretty congested urban area where there are no good options for commutes, unless you live right in the heart of downtown. You can cut your commute time by living closer to downtown, but that means dealing with more crowded trains/subways and standing all the way. I'd rather increase my commute time by 30 minutes but be able to sit and take a nap, study, read, or whatever.

\- I refuse to drive for commute, for the reason mentioned above.

So in and all, it wasn't a bad choice.
who you got
Dude, how many doses do you think they can produce by mid 2021? A few 100 million? That wouldn't even cover 5% of the population. That's assuming that it's safe and there are no further bumps along the road. To say that we're a year away from seeing some semblance of normal is probably optimistic.
15-20% otm, and weeklies. The covered calls I sell are weeklies and about 30% otm. 

Basically if it spikes I lose the shares (but still make some decent cash) and get a big boost from the calls. If It doesn’t spike I hold onto the shares at no extra cost

Realistically, a company that gets into this space needs to have a ton of money behind it. I'm not sure that companies that are solely making fake meat will ever get the job done. I think at the end of the day, it'll be a huge established food company that ventures into the space with a lot of money specifically to work out the taste issue because they see how lucrative it could be to do.

Bro I made 7k for each aswell the difference is my dumbass cashed out and bought 10k worth of BP calls
Either:

🅰️: RH sells the Iron Condors automatically 90 mins before close because of their “rIsK sYStEm”. Resulting in losing money

🅱️: It becomes 4x worth its value and will also lead to money loss

🆎: It drills/moons my preferred direction and I profit (Has yet to happen during days like today)
Or if it’s price can compete with meat.

EDIT: I do think PLTR and some of these others are great long-term plays. That said bots will pump them to get you to YOLO on calls. Think critically and have a realistic expiration date. It’s very unlikely that a co that’s up 40% in 5 trading days will go up another 40% in the next 5.

Luckily SPX only reached 3645.99, meaning there's 20.01 additional points until the all time highs before a major top at 3666 is put in.   


The 2009 low was 666.

Last sentence is wildly incorrect. Chargepoint's Enterprise Value is currently approx. $3B. The SP@K itself is trading for less, but don't look at that number - read the docs.

Might still be a good investment, but that dealmaker wanted their premium EV multiple up front.

I can't talk too much shit on Burry.

I went through all the name fund people in early March to see which bets they had seen get their faces eaten off by tigers. I bought heavily into CLF as a long-term dividend play, and that shit has paid off nicely.

I also played the hell out of the TLRD rollercoaster. That was a fun ride. Didn't quite stick the landing, but I made money nonetheless. End up holding a little when they filed for bankruptcy. Sold that shit for a bag of balls.

Kinda wish i had gone after GME, but my standing rule is to not buy companies I hate IRL. I thought Burry's thesis on GME was right, though.

Funny whenever the market goes up before a republican takes office or down before a democrat does there's always screams about how it's the market pricing it in.  Hell, if the market goes down even months before the election there's always whispers that it's the market "fearing a dem could take office."
