Pump that shit up. 2 years of data, go 300 data points (if you are adding them manually, just add however many you can, try for 100), if it's over .8 that's still a halfway decent correlation, technically not statistically significant in most fields, but it is enough to show at least a light correlation.

Im not hating it so far but my standards arent high for AHS
What the hell why so specific.  üò≥ anyways relax im just trying to learn. From what I have learned in the 1hour  I've been searching and watching videos and from here. The most ill lose from buying puts is the amount I invest. So if I do a put option of 200 that's all ill lose. Or thats what investopedia said. Im super cheap so I don't see myself doing options unless there is a limit to my loss. So if a contract will only cost me 200 eh I can deal with that. I make 300 a week on regular trade so I ain't fussing. At least thats what investopedia said about put options
What kinda progress are you looking at?
Technically making a few dollars is making money!
Sure, increased iv helps obviously. Depending on your strike and expiration less so if it's otm and a day from expiring

Options are great for small accounts. Nobody should really give a fuck making 10% a year if they got 5k.

That‚Äôs probably a good thing....  the more I learn about NIU, the more I think it‚Äôs future is just massive. And unlike NIO, they are already distributing outside of China.

GL bro, rooting for you.
If you want to play safe then, keep playing shares. 

If you can get your portfolio to 3k you can start selling calls on RKT or CRSR and use the premium to play options.

NIO $60 Call 11/20
RemindMe! December 19th, 2020
wow that first 20 minutes of the globex session was so fake and \_. 

 all the stonk market has become is a place for top level execs to get paid out the ass via inflated stock options. instead of outrageous comp packages like they had in 2008 they have just circumvented the laws via these stock options. 

im sorry but you may be making some money off your calls, which i hope some of you are because i love the small guys trading on here, but this  sum money is not enough to make up for the outrageous wealth inequality that is happening in america right now. 

i hope you guys are all trading well and yes i am a little salty tonight.

Yes. Whenever SpaceX has a launch I try and buy a small set of spce calls ahead of time. They always print. I won't put a lot of money on trying to profit on people being fucking retarded but it always goes up the next day.

I got spce calls now but that is actually for their launch. SpaceX is a nice bonus
Why are my all matches 6 foot 240 Alabama recruits. I know some women had ancestors who were vikings but they weren‚Äôt build like The Hamburglar.
Saw that at the end of the day on Friday that the unusual actively tracker showed sooo many calls were bought and figured they know something I don‚Äôt. Here we are, chillin on Lamborghini.com picking out colors for my wife‚Äôs bf.
True and the psychology is different plus I kinda know what happened. Still seems interesting.
If you only had $100 left to trade would you throw it in Pltr or Spce calls this week
Test flight will probably get delayed while SpaceX sends humans to Uranus and back in time for lunch.

Watching AMD, NET, BABA, and NVDA this week very closely.

AMD and NET I think I am going to start buying every dip, becasue I think they are going to break higher to the upside.

NVDA watching for earnings obviously, holding about 25 shares and might size up a touch on shares. Trying to stay away from options earnings plays, too risky right now and I don't think NVDA will break $600 even with a good quarter, the stock is so expensive right now.

You‚Äôre stuck in a narrative. Ignore the news. Look at price. Where does it want to go? It goes where it very well damn pleases. Forces MUCH bigger are in play. Slushes and slushes of money want to move somewhere with yield. Equity has yield. Ride the wave and stop philosophizing the stock market.

A lot of people think this, including me. But market go up. I still think the market is due to get nuked soon, but nobody knows when. Everyone is so greedy that it's too hard to sit on the sidelines, especially with nowhere else to put your money to work. People probably think they'll see it coming and have time to escape with their tendies intact. Too bad it doesn't work that way

Just FYI for the people who actually have 0 idea, Palantir is basically a tech consulting company who happened to built softwares that act similar to Snowflake but for focus on non-tech industries. Even though Palantir is technically just a tech "consulting" company, Palantir has a strong edge due to focusing on impactful problems (clients from non profit, government, military, etc.), which is actually pretty hard to execute well on.

PLTR stock
So no one thinks its unsustainable that spy usually goes up 7% a year but is up 20% this year while the economy is in absolute shambles and will probably still be a year from now?

It needs to show its balls but not too hard. Sitting on $25 poor mans covered calls that expire Friday and I don‚Äôt want them to be exercised
I‚Äôve been hearing that for months. I heard 140% today from somebody else. I heard 170% a month ago. Are there any parallels with what happened with VW/Porsche?

Everybody loses money to begin with.  Them you turn it round and start winning.  (Or get so sick of losing you quit)
Why is nobody talking about F saying they're interested in EV? Given the hard-on this sub has for EVs, you'd think it'd be talked about more. They're a boomer stock, sure. They move dreadfully slow for the most part, sure. But they're gaining momentum and approaching their 1Y high. A familiar brand that boomers can get behind and the meme potential of EV just seems like a perfect storm. Plus, Cramer should get at least one thing right per year, let's give him that.

the importance and ubiquitous nature of tech has only recently been fully realised due to lockdowns and all the work from home crap. The tech dependency our economy was gonna have a decade from now, that's no longer a decade in the future, in fact, it's now. Tech permeates all walks of lives and should be appropriately valued to reflect that fact. Now, on top of that, add the recovery of all the other beat down sectors, the market growth will probably be the highest this year than any other year in the 2020s.
Perfectly sideways
Im not happy i lost money i happy because i have more than one thing going well for me in my life. The market will always be there and im gonna educate myself jump back in when i have the oppurtunity i learned my lesson. I have time to build a financially comfotable future. And i learned my lesson.

Okay so I guess first of all Tesla will be worth 4k split adjusted in the next 1-2 years. That‚Äôs because Tesla isn‚Äôt just a car maker. But secondly no. I don‚Äôt see Nio hitting 4k. I think it‚Äôs more likely that Xpeng will be the winner long term in China being the more accessible brand. So. Thirdly. Yes. Split adjusted the winning EV company in China could easily be worth 4k a share in 15-30 years.
Untimely, sudden death can be hilarious.
5k worth of 100c 11/20 and 130c 1/15/21 over the weekend. Let's fuckin gooooooo!!!
You know i already have. Moon time.
Probably move up to 265. Then a big gap up Tuesday. Was way over sold.
Owned this since the low 30s not much to say other than it goes up. Had the highest projected revenue growth for a company it‚Äôs size when i bought it.

Yeah, Elon probably has COVID, but he's rich as shit and has sounded fine/normal. Also, the SpaceX launch went well and got hella news coverage, much of which connects Elon back to Tesla - plus the cars got some play with the fun license plates.

Will it stick? Probably not for the whole week. But tomorrow TSLA should be super green at least for a few hours.

Market cratered because it looked like we were heading to a worst case scenario. Then it stabilized, and stimulus, etc. Now we're trending back towards a near-worst case outcome.

But I wouldn't be surprised if there are a million dead Americans and SP500 is still 20% up from today because fuck it, why not?
That's a terrible idea dude. They're damn near touching the 200 day MA. They're not gonna keep dropping.

i know. something with data. or something
You don't think it dropped enough?
If I‚Äôve learned anything in this circus market it‚Äôs this. 

You can‚Äôt time shit and thus can‚Äôt day trade. Instead of buying puts, buy calls when shit dips.
go for consistent layups. not half court shots. got it.
Its like spy gadgets? Laser watches and the like?

Judging by the graph youve been retarded for at least 3 months
You'll be surprised bro. 

Sure it might seem like we are all just degenerates YOLOing to buy Lambos but I'm willing to bet that most people here are just people that know how badly the decks are stacked against them.

Wages have been flat for a generation while costs of housing, healthcare, education and childcare are at all time highs. 

Social mobility at a 45 year low. Most people here are wage slaves and know it and want to break out of the cycle.

They have no realistic way to pay for retirement or to save for a house so they YOLO the 500 a month they are told to put in a index fund to save for retirement on far OTM options hoping to leverage and cash out hard.

Save and buy a house? Pay off student loans? How? With COL so high it isn't going to happen. 

The economy is skewed in a way that makes social mobility a pipe dream, so here they all come. YOLO or go broke. 

It's a sign of the times, my dude.
That was the best day of my life. Sold everything in Jan as soon as I heard rumors from China. Then all in on that day.

It's alright man. Everything happens for a reason. Head up, King!
which games to play though?
Meant a put. No way the OP exercised the option. Nobody is that dumb.
No they aren't. I'm a professional software developer which is less strenuous than video rendering etc. They easily get bogged down and battery life is like 1hr when I'm actively developing. I'm pissed my work laptop upgrade cycle is 2 years away. Probably take IT that long to get all their spam compatible with the new architecture though.

How is that futures hit a certain point and just hang out there pretty much flat for hours at a time.  Barely any movement for literally 8 solid hours until open.

Almost makes you think that futures aren't the end all be all of predicting the next day.

Hi, JD gang member here
Yesterday, I went to target got a hair trimming machine thing for 20 bucks. I did the sides myself, pretty easy and I asked my gf to trim the back and give some finishing touches. all in all, done in 30-40 mins. And the haircut looks decent, not that different from my usual 30 bucks haircut.
Why though
I see that LKNCY stock, rip my autistic comrade.
If you got the money sure but realize it can still go down more. Would wait a day or two to see where the momentum swings.
Because they are more profitable at selling options than you? Nice.

I did earnimgs few months ago. It was bad. Stay away
Yeah, the plan was to get in a little cheap and just roll weekly calls to gain some cash. Buy more stock to make more contracts. That's going to be slow moving at 50-80 a week. Margin freaks me out.
That's how you're supposed to do it
Is this a PYPL pump?
They will for sure man
Dunno. TSLA is the obv candidate but there has to be other smaller, publicly traded companies that are also vying for a piece of the market. A REIT of some sort would be awesome.

Shut the world out long enough for me to work on shit in therapy. Took a few years but I am finally off them. Forced the "give a shit" switch to the off position. Therapy was largely about when that switch needs to be on or off.

hard to say exactly. you cant attribute your success to one thing. getting rid of my degenerate behaviors caused most of my success. but i was on paxil for a few years. over a decade later i don't really get depressed very often anymore. i have few vices. caffeine and a double shot of rum on the weekend, thats about it.

side note, niacin on empty stomach (instant release 1000mg) is very intense and uncomfortable, but has antidepressant like effects. its just vitamin b3

Bro it legit feels out of a movie but if you think about it, China can't win a military battle with western powers (US). The part of the conspiracy that always made sense to me was the fact that they could completely fuck the rest of the world while they made advancements, using tech they stole from and then advanced upon from the western world. I think lots more died in China than they let off, but again, "China-first"
Imagine we're measuring your wife's boyfriends penis (no homo).

In January we used a 12 inch rule and he filled it up.

In November, we're using a 48 inch ruler that has been shrunk to be only 12 inches long.  He fills it up.

Now is his penis actually 48 inches long all of a sudden, or are we just using a bad ruler on what is fundamentally a 12 inch penis?

Well as someone who does play video games this game to me seems like it won‚Äôt meet people‚Äôs expectations. Simply because people are expecting the literal best game to have been released in all of history of mankind. It could be a pretty good or very good game and it probably won‚Äôt meet the hype. Now what really matters if there is enough to keep people interested to play 2 hours, because after 2 hours the game is non refundable on steam. This is kinda like NKLA level expectations, but I will say this game is not priced in at all.

If you want you can try it (obviously), I mean the conversion has come up before and I still think it's a terrible idea. You think you're going to be able to "feel the markets" and shit like that when in reality you're not going to give a flying fuck about trading options when you're actually tripping. If you do, y‚Å∑ou'll likely perform terribly. You need to be sharp and sober, save the acid for after hours.

Sometime in August when PSX was $64 ish? The second leg down for the energy sector should not have happened, this shit shouldn‚Äôt have been sitting at March lows and some companies were even lower than March. PSX absolutely crushed EPS last quarter, something like -0.70 expected and -.01 actual. Almost breaking even in the worst of the crisis.

I have no idea what happened to energy. RCL had negative revenue on the quarter and outperformed anything in the sector. A company with literal negative *revenue*. It was crazy, I kept holding and hoping that it was temporary but it never went back up. Couldn‚Äôt break the 10 day moving average and just kept getting liquidated.

The oil market is much better, a ton of the excess has already been worked off. Gasoline is back to normal levels and diesel/distillate has been worked off like crazy over the last month. It really should be higher

It worries me that you keep saying "bets" (yes I know the name of this sub).

If you want to be long an option, then you don't have to own any of the underlying in order to do so. In theory, you also don't have to own any stock if you want to be short an option (usually called writing a call/put). Having said that, it's not recommended from a risk management perspective (most trading apps won't even let you write uncovered contracts unless you have a certain amount of money in your account). 

I gave a very simplified ELI5 answer on how options values are derived and skipped over some stuff such as premiums.

For example, a person that sells an option (let's say they sell a call), will get a relatively small amount of money called a "premium". Sometimes the premium is worth a couple cents per share and sometimes it's worth a couple dollars or more. That's the profit they make and consider it the fee they take in exchange for the risk they are now exposed to. As long as the call option expires before the stock goes above the strike price, they get to keep all that premium. 

> Because if i have the puts at 100 but they are at 88 then the guy who buys them will pay me 88 not 100 so only the guy that buys will make money or is there a step i missed

I think you are confusing strike price, price of the underlying and option price. I'll try to rewrite your sentence in a way that shows the difference. 

>If I am holding puts with a STRIKE PRICE of $100 and the market PRICE of the UNDERLYING stock is $88, the person who buys those puts off of me will likely be paying an OPTION PRICE of somewhere around $12 (once again, I'm assuming a very simple example that ignores a bunch of stuff). If I had paid a premium of $2 when I originally bought the puts, then I will make a profit of $10.

yah, this is something I'm learning now and it's so frustrating (patience).  Seeing wacky shit going on in the market and staying back.  Sucks when you see 2%-3% gaps over night though, but again, there's NO way to see those coming...

The CCP wants to increase their global soft power. They're not gonna kill their biggest tech company over an elon-musk-tier gaffe. The whole world is watching, lots of US funds have heavy BABA positions. If the CCP actually kills BABA over this, they're pushing out foreign investment for the next 5 years.

The more likely scenario is that they don't want another Luckin. Alipay had a bunch of young people taking out loans. The CCP doesn't want the world to watch ANT implode. If anything, they've done this to protect investors and consumers.

This about it this way. If everyone is long, there's no one left to go long. Stonk not go up much more and maybe increased chance to gap down.

Edit: it's just one signal though but if you combine a low put to call ratio with other bearish signals then maybe a good time to put on some hedges just in case

$11,576.48 != $21,930.73

Dude it's a scam. 

They get ridden hard with impossible targets and so to keep up, many of them end up taking meth. 

The worst is when they rent to own thier trucks and are on the hook for all repair costs while also having to make a monthly payment. 

However, they then are put into what are essentially bidding wars against others just like themselves creating a crab bucket situation. 

It would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.  The only way truckers will ever make money again is if they unionize and drive up freight rates. 

Trucking died with Regan. Back before he showed up and declared war on them, a guy with a high school education could join up at the local Teamsters union and make the equivalent of 100k a year after 5 years. 

Now they are lucky to crack 40k and they're still on the hook for their own health insurance. 

Better to get a job with UPS as a driver. Your knees will die out in 15 years but you'll make 60k and get a decent pension.
CEOs are usually careful when making forward looking statements. Then there's tech.

Solid criticism for my DD. But you have to remember, NKLA have had no products to show for, whereas, PLTR has already proven itself in some spaces(defence, oil, fraud detection etc) and is rapidly moving into other spaces.

So, I think it‚Äôs a solid company in the long run and in the short run the rush by institutional investors would help it.

If it starts to enter into all the various ETFs, that alone would be enough for a move to the upside in a big scale.

So I‚Äôve been making a good amount of comments about the market melting up, but I want to keep posting them so as many people as possible in this sub will see it. We‚Äôre about to melt up past SPY 380. There‚Äôs no reason for it except technicals and indicators, which in a bubble are the only things that matter. The only stocks to play in this final melt up are hyped up stocks like PLTR and NIO. If you‚Äôve bought leaps on a stock at or near it‚Äôs ATH, sell those. Best bet is to scrape some profits from this melt up before we crash and enter an actual recession. When we crash next, there won‚Äôt be a v-shaped recovery. SPY 380c 12/18

Yeah so a $1 move in the share price is 1.88 B added to the market cap. So the share price can‚Äôt move as high, and that‚Äôs how you, the investor, make money.

Toyota has made the same number of cars for years and they have almost zero room for growth. Even if they release a new car that everyone likes, it doesn't add much value. If you buy 1000 shares now, it'll grow a little over a few years. Great.


Tesla is still growing. They can apply new technologies, make more cars, come up with new batteries, etc. There's room for growth.


And NIO...they only sell cars in China and only trade in the US. If you buy 1000 shares now, you'll get huge returns in the next few years because they'll start selling in SE Asia, Europe, etc. People are investing in potential value, not so much current value.
Who‚Äôs the hottest Asian porn star?

Market will get propped up for anticipation of MRNA news. Lockdowns might just be noise at this point, but could definitely bring us down a bit in the weeks to come. Watch SPY and see if it can hold 358 or so.

Shitty. But at least my puts are for 12/18. Oh besides a weekly 355p I bought
Guys I flipped my phone upside down. Much better now
Yeah so the market cap increases greatly with even small movements in the share price aka the price won‚Äôt move as high as people think
Im not sad because my SPY 355p is worthless now. The other option I was going for is BABA 270c. So either way my account would have been gone tmrw so there it is.
is TSLA just going to hang out at a little over $400 forever?

Fair, but you also can't file bk and get rid of them. Your bookie could die
yo chill ü§´
it does if you knew the full positions of the option holders. but you dont so it doesn't. SPX puts are used alot for hedging for example. Which means they are net long but is technically a bearish read on the ratio.
Hasn't hit the news yet, but Palantir, like SpaceX, is vital to national security. Failure is not an option, and it will never be allowed. TLDR: You are correct.
it was a bad snap
Intuitions never said they are going long.  Retard. Yes, as an institution I would look for new stocks that can grow fast and dump. In this case, if I were an institution  I would replace some of my defense stocks with PLTR.  It isn't going to be a "millionaire" maker stock.

I‚Äôm on mobile but I have a serious question: where do the rights to Spider-Man fit in with this? 

Matt from Film Theory made a few videos last year explaining Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man and was considering shopping it around because it may (for lack of a better word) expire unless another film comes out? I don‚Äôt think Disney is in a position to buy Spider-Man right now. Disney may wait to see Sony violate its contract to hold the IP (coronavirus is a significant factor here). 

I‚Äôm asking because IIRC the IP issue ran through 2020/2021. I haven‚Äôt kept up with this issue lately but it had a considerable speculative value (billions). Sony gets some amount of kickback for letting Disney use Spider-Man in the marvel movies through some agreement. But Spider-Man is also a PlayStation hit/tie-in.
What would number of shares matter? What matters is market cap (share price times shares) and the voting rights of the shares

It‚Äôs pretty impossible. Every 401k is slightly different but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to roll it over while still employed unless you had a-non hardship withdrawal option which is especially unlikely if you‚Äôre not over 59.5 years old (even if you are that old it‚Äôs still mostly unlikely).

Once vaccine gets deployed and virus is old news, the market will go back to moving 0.2% per day, especially when Trump leaves the office and Biden won't give a shit about pumping stonks.

Volatility should drop to nothing after February.
can someone smarter interpret what happened on 11/09?

[http://shortvolumes.com/?t=spy](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=spy)

my guess is puts were on discount and everyone took it as a buying opp. But that jump is crazy graphically.
PLTR has 1.88 BILLION shares. Does that not concern people?
NIO to reach 5000% gain by the end of the year
People are sleeping on energy, very quietly absolutely crushed it all last week. Super volatile too. Refiners posted like a 25-30% gain on Monday alone, and finished even higher on the week. Even had like a down 7% day on Thursday out of no where and then roared right back on Friday. Feels like it was a consolidation spring coiling and it‚Äôs taking off again this week

Many of them were at or below March levels, they will also be mooning with the vaccine
leeheeeps
LFG. I‚Äôm buying 300c this week. Not sure exp. yet.
Stonks only go up
Im reading investopedia and its super complicated. Yours makes more sense. 

So from investopedia it makes it seem that the inly thing u lose is the money you place on the bet or puts and calls. Not the actually money in the stocks.

One thing that keeps bothering me is do i have to own the stocks or canni place these bets on the stocks without buying them?

So from your explanation i get that 5he only person who makes the money is the guy who buys your puts so basically i dont make money. Or do i nake money as well. Because if i have the puts at 100 but they are at 88 then the guy who buys them will pay me 88 not 100 so only the guy that buys will make money or is there a step i missed

my PLTR input 

Here‚Äôs the deal. I lost like a lot on Friday from the expectations. I researched a shit ton.

This company was started by the CIA with thiel. That means it has govt connection and contracts. They are a MIC company, BUT they are working other govts. As long as cyber warfare, espionage, all that fuckery is going on in the world... this company is going to thrive. At the earnings conference they announced they were going to go commercial. All I‚Äôm saying is just buy shares now. This is a long term stock. They went public in September. Buy LEAPs whatever but like I don‚Äôt think this company is gonna be a short term money maker because they are working with military contracts, which could make the stock HUGE
Any brother know a way (other than to quit) to transfer funds from a 401k account set up by a current employer with T Rowe Price to a less restrictive broker? My employee 401k has five shitty fund choices to choose from and restricts buying back within a 30 day period. I guess it‚Äôs their way to keep a brother in the rat race.

NIO $35 after earnings up 150% on puts. 

Like that?
A very simple explanation is that a call or put gives the person the right to buy (call) or sell(put) a stock at a given price. If he's holding a $100 put and the price is at $88 on the day that the put expires, he makes a $12 profit because a put holder would be able to buy the stock in the market at $88 and immediately sell it for $100. Therefore the value of the put in that example is $12.

Things get more complicated when you have to account for things such as time left til expiration and other things (what if there are still 6 months left vs 1 week left) or if the stock price is very volatile and even how far away the stock price is currently from the strike price. 

If you go to https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/, you can play around and generate profit/loss tables for any option for any stock for every combination of price point and day.

What happened?
The companies that killed the electric car, can sure as hell lobby washington to come out on top.
So a company that loses billions and barely sells any cars is worth more than most profitable major EU car companies bc it has a battery. Makes sense
pltr is like a meme stock that hasnt pumped yet. im tryin to think of a similar example where we were meming the shit out of a stock and it actually mooned. i think dkng and spce were 2 examples but my memory is pretty vague.
Thinking of investing in pltr, NIO, spce, and unty stocks like a good boomer.  What do you guys think
Lol buy low sell lower
I just made chipotle bowls for me and gf. Cooked with habanero first time and chopped up 5 into our bowls, just completely fucked our shit up, she‚Äôs on the ground doing breathing exercises i‚Äôm sucking on ice cubes
Dude that will never be ITM lmao
Chipotle on the way via doordash. Whiskey half gone. Can't wait til open.
Keep in touch bro. I like talking to people about the markets who are serious lol. 

But with the big moves we‚Äôve seen, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we break 3500, we test 3300 after to fill the gaps. That said, I‚Äôm mostly long and will start buying cheap OTM puts to hedge. I think we‚Äôre going higher first. Also trump essentially conceded. Which is more clarity in the market.

Also, while unlikely, stimulus is still possible. Maybe trump does one last hoorah before he leaves. He did tweet about the stimulus the other day
I'm only semi-serious/being facetious. But yeah.. that's probably what September was.. shit i can't even remember why we dipped in Sept now, underwhelming ER, election fear? Those probably contributed as well.

Because our government thinks controlling that stops people from killing themselves behind the wheel. Parents in America are far too uptight about alcohol which leaves kids to rebel and drink and drive too often. In Europe, the atmosphere surrounding drinking is much more relaxed in most households and kids don‚Äôt feel the need to be so rebellious. It works much better that way.

I see BABA fucked till Jack Ma retires. He tried to fight with the CCP and they show him now who is boss. The CCP has no qualms killing their golden goose if they can show Baidu or JD what happens when you do not toe the line.

The best thing Ma could do for the company now is step down and name some servile successor.

he said this two weeks ago:

>If you are a bull close your app until December, if a bear go on margin because the next 2 weeks is what you have been waiting since 2008 for.

If the market goes up this week, it will be the value stocks leading the way. More specifically Boeing. I am not saying Boeing is worth staying in long term but this week could be huge if your looking for a trade. 737 max recertification expected to be announced Wednesday. Moderna vaccine news I assume will be either tomorrow or Tuesday. If all goes well. BA will retest $230, and possibly try out $250 before coming back down to earth. They went from $150 to $230 in June on almost a straight line and it could be happening again! My $205 calls are feeling very confident.
Buy both
1. Most of them are held by the very public co-founders. In total, 12 person have almost all of that ownership. They have almost nothing to gain and only their reputation to lose if they want to unload those stocks. So it is unlikely that they will do it. They are likely to keep on holding it until the company becomes much more larger.

2. The downside risk is in the options held by employees which expire after a time and they would be continued to be exercised just like it happens with other tech companies.

3. If they suddenly decide to unload in huge volumes,  there would be too many shares in the open market resulting in downward risk.

I don‚Äôt like asset backed securities because they won‚Äôt protect against deflation. I like 80% cash so you have backup cash in case market goes stagnant and you‚Äôre trying to build a new strategy(it works until it doesn‚Äôt and I know my wedge strategy will not work in a normal market environment). Going 80% cash is also useful for when you want to exercise an option aftermarket to sell at 4:30 am et in order to take advantage of premarket/China pump trading.

No diminishing returns? How would a competing vaccine add another 7%? The first pump was because we had a path to a return to normal within 12 months because of a vaccine. What would a second vaccine add?

Also, even if we assume MRNA gives us 7%, where does the other 8% come from? Come on, dude.

500 cars? Do you literally just make up numbers? They‚Äôre shipping 100,000 cars next year and already ship 500 cars every 3 days

So yes it‚Äôs confirmed that you don‚Äôt know basic math. I guess this is why I make so much money selling puts to you.

As for 2030, the point is that once you declare everything is switching from gas then the shift begins in earnest and investor sentiment changes since there is a predictable path towards scale for EVs. That‚Äôs why EVs have been so big this year as the UK isn‚Äôt the first country to do something like this with a target date of 2030, if you weren‚Äôt paying attention.

But sure keep lying about the number of cars shipped and calling random people you‚Äôve never met retards like it makes you cool. Sorry being wrong isn‚Äôt cool even if you pat yourself on the back

You thought they‚Äôd shipped 500 cars ü§°

Not realized losses (at least not yet) - they increased reserves in anticipation of future benefit payments. That‚Äôs why their earnings took a hit in 2018. 

This reserve increase requested by the Maine dept of insurance should be the last time they need to adjust reserves given how big it is (50% of the reserves they already have for this line of business)

Buprenorphine is not stronger (and definitely not 3x stronger) than morphine. It's also not super effective for nerve pain and over the long term can make your pain worse. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, or venlafaxine are all going to be better for nerve pain in the long term. Just something to consider.
Companies that rely on government contracts can't get monopoly sized big because the government would spread out the contracts to other companies, even if they have a worse product. They will be competing with Microsoft, Goolge, and Amazon, along with other smaller companies that lobby Congress.

Welp, tomorrow isn't going to be a great day for my 3/19 IWM $150p's. I paid $4.09 per contract for them.

I'll write some 12/18 $150p's tmrw as spreads, and will hopefully collect $0.80 per contract.

Then, if 12/18 rolls around and IWM has pumped 5% from here up to $182, my 3/19's should still be worth $1.98 (present value of the 2/19 $141p).

By writing a monthly calendar spread, I should contain my max losses to 32%, even in the "worst case" scenario that IWM pumps 5% before 12/18.

Wish me luck, autists.

Election uncertainty and straight up recovery instead of a slower paced climb like we‚Äôre seeing now.
Squeeze soon(ish)
Another play is, assuming there is a run up until the 12/4, wait until near close of market on the 3rd and buy 2week deep otm put (not sure what price.. $350p or lower?), which should be super cheap given that the price has presumably run up in the meantime. 

In the case tsla stays out of S&p those puts should return multiples.

The only issue is that this is a one directional bet.

I'm not sure there is a way to take advantage of an inclusion in the same cheap way, considering there will be a run up of the sp by the 4th. Buying shares on the morning after is a way to make some money but doesn't compare with buying calls for cents on the dollar that turn out to be worth a few dollars.
Is there a value table that would show how much money would be made. Im sure it has to be against the amount of stocks he holds but not sure how the value of the made money would be.  But i think i get the jist. So the beat part would be to sell as soon as the contract hits my desired limit.  Thanks man
cause him and a bunch of other people bought calls last week and are tired of getting theta shrekt

Sell it then. I sold a NIO put at the drop on Friday and plan to roll it for more credit tomorrow. Use that IV crush to your advantage and put it in your pocket. Then when you get a better idea of the direction NIO wants to go after earnings, buy puts or calls at a discount.

Edit: nvm you don‚Äôt have enough left in your account to sell lol
I‚Äôm just going to put this out there. I‚Äôm an attorney, my firm was contacted by NKLA to create a 401k plan, we told them the cost was between 10-15k and they didn‚Äôt bat a eye. I have no idea if they actually have a product or not, but I have yet to have a company request to create a 401k plan because they didn‚Äôt anticipate business success.

dude tell me about it. i walked into work friday up 100% on these calls. but patients kept coming in like a bunch of noobs. so now i'm stuck diamond handing the weekend. i woke up today thinking it was monday...................
since june ive been holding shares and selling on spikes. Up about 50k total, including the huge fucking slide recently. This slide flamed about half my overall earnings for the year. I sold when it hit 23 but bought back too early around 18/19.

If BABA really goes down another 5% tomorrow, I am going to sell half of my position and buy into BABA. I am poor, so that would be under 15k but hey it's 50%
I definitely want to try and time a short but don‚Äôt want to get burned. Might do a small short position.

I bought Tesla back at like $60 or something figuring I wanted a chunk of the company because they looked promising. I had no idea what the fuck was happening for the next 6 months. I think I sold the last of it at the tippy top because it just looked insane at that point.

My timing is usually retarded. I just had dumb luck on Tesla. I didn't even know it had become a meme stock until I found WSB, AFTER I sold it. May NIO be your Tesla.

That is not true, it does not always follow our market. On Wednesday it gapped down even though the market was up. This was because it dropped down further in HK. 

Look where BABA closes on Tuesday and where it opens on Wednesday. Now look at Nasdaq index on Tuesday afternoon and Nasdaq open on Wednesday.
Trying to trade at work is too stressful
Puts?!?!?.?
If you are new, shut the fuck up and start doing some research. Noone needs to spoon feed you.

Im confused about the value of the contract. Can you explain using the 100 to 88 lose i used.

From what you said im confused cuz if the value goes down to 88 then he doesnt make any money he loses mo ey so im lost of the part where the money is made üòÇ .
Im not trying to be difficult im actually trying real hard to understand honest

I doagree with HK following our trends on that stock for the most part in the last 3 weeks.

Well see and I will BITCH DOWN all the bears who replied negatively to me.

So you don't like SPCE but you think Gamestop is a good buy for the future? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
I take it back, you ain't sane, what future do you see for that company when Microsft is clearing putting all its focus on cloud gaming, they didn't even care about beating PS5, just focused on xCloud. 
Gamestop doesn't trade at a high multiple because they burn cash and the only thing that keeps them afloat is their used games sales, which will be hurt the most when people switch to cloud gaming.
At 11 GME is undervalued? Man you more insane than us SPCE bulls.

It probably is time to buy, although you risk it trading sideways and getting killed on Theta. The price is decent though.
Isn‚Äôt it fishy to anyone else that NIO is being pumped to the moon by retail investors? I didn‚Äôt really see this when NIO was mooning earlier. The pumpers are out in full force after a big red day. I feel like the bubble is about to pop.
Why why why!!! I threw in 15k at 294... and it literally jumps off a cliff

Don't worry, hold. It's literally the definition of can't fail. Think of it like holding AMZN except it's not massively overvalued and actually is more important to daily life in China.
Yeah and all these newbies have no idea what‚Äôs coming for them. I‚Äôm glad that they‚Äôre winning, I just hope they aren‚Äôt stupid enough to hold thru earnings. my recent iv crush was from rkt last week and it only dropped 50% and i sold for a loss the next day.

BABA's price on the HK exchange seems to be $10 lower than what it is on the US exchange. So I guess add $10 to whatever price you're seeing on the HK exchange and calm down?

It hit 246 last week and the ATH was 309 on the HK exchange, $10 lower than in the US which hit 319.

Yeah I haven‚Äôt been around long enough to know how much the options game has changed over time, but these guys definitely have the ability to set the traps, sell you the options, and push the price up or down to cuck you out of a position. Especially on lower volume stocks. I imagine the only way out of it is longer options but people hate those for the same reason they hate shares. Less chances of huge upside and they cost more.

It‚Äôs not literally a bet it‚Äôs a contract but I just tried to keep it simple. It can get pretty complicated. You are purchasing a contract to sell the underlying shares at a certain price and the value of that contract changes depending on the price movement of the stock. The contract also has an expiration date. You can close out the contract any time before expiration to convert it to cash at the current value.

Depends on the put.

If his put expired when it went to 120 he lost everything invested. If he sold calls his ass is grass.

If the price was below the put price at expatriation or he sold it when it dropped to 88 he made money.
Don‚Äôt forget to save half for Uncle Sam!
Well investing like that is great just pick safer bets and hold long. WSB will coax you into short plays.

It's just money. Dont do anything drastic like harm yourself or others. Failure (and especially on this level) is one of the most difficult things to move on from. Try and take it day by day. 

90% of retail traders lose over time trading derivatives. The market is so manipulated it is nearly impossible to make money in the long run as retail. Next time just stick your money in an index ETF and if you must trade options, only mess with covered calls. 

It's easy to tell most people in this thread are college age students or extremely young. People fuck up all the time. Your failure isnt unique or uncommon. People blow up accounts regardless of the amount of money. It happens.

Vaccine out in 2 months to high risk and doctors. Normal folk like us are a year out bub. Not to mention this shit needs to be transported at sub zero Temps and intravenous infusion. Logistics are gonna be a nightmare. And 2 months is IF everything goes to plan. Plus side affects are basically covid no death. Bad aches and pains. Headache. Basically feels like death. And u need more than 1 dose. Now with that said, I'm looking at investing in cold storage and cold transport. I can see USA shutting down for a short period or circuit breaker lock downs to reduce amount of virus in population so that a vaccine would be more effective with less people with the virus around. Im bullish as the next but this shit is so out of touch with reality. I do have calls on some things but I'm buying puts to hedge for a possible big red leg down.

The thing is that is also currently happening in the US, we just hide it/manipulate it better and make it look like only other countries are doing it.

Maybe I'm just bitter after losing a lot on SPCE back in Feb. but I think this company is trash. They haven't had a test flight in a year and a half. Branson was supposed to go up this past summer. He sold stock in SPCE to prop up his other failing businesses. Also he's a billionaire with a private virgin island so.... let your imagination run wild.

Sigh it's actually fked. While the people here may be right BABA is a good company and long term it'll be fine. China can fk with u and BABA could trade sideways for 3 years before it goes back up. In which case you were better off putting your money in something else

Nah bro just multiply by 1.04 you'll get the USD figure. It's still ass though because it's not recovering. Which means we could get another sell off tonight too as situations are not easing in China

You probably don't unless you're lucky and have a ton of free time. I got in SOLO at 3.75 which was after a run up. But my logic was that volume was 2x average that day, so if high volume continued (along with other mooning EVs), I'd probably make something.

What are the rules. Those the lose value have to remain off or it doesnt matter

Example 
The stock is at 100 he say itll lose value and it does and goes to 88 but 2 days later it goes up to 120 does he lose his "put" or is the put discarded after it goes into play?

Also what are the risk if it doesnt. Do i lose all my mo ey or is there like a fee i pay to put in my "bets" i guess. What are the odds and what do you win. Sorry for asking so much. But ive been at stocks for a while but i only do the basic buy and hold for 3 days or until it goes up and sell. Om a short term investor. I make my money getting crumbs its very safe. I usually make 300 a week just trading safe. I figured making a risky bet ones a month wont kill me eh
I'm high and this gave me scared chills
It‚Äôs the top trending ticker with SPCE on stocktwits. 5x volume compared to previous day on Friday. My calls are up over 100% in two days since they added the option chain. It‚Äôs ready

Thinking the hype train is just getting started. Once the institutions start piling it it's gonna be hulk dicks all round. Only concern is the 80% of shares coming out of lock up either in December this year or May next year, depending on who you believe. Some early investors/employees will cash out but I really think this one is a long hold.
I need money to buy more PLTR. Feel free to send me some.
Maek this post.

Baba will be up tomorrow more than it closes Friday.

You guys are panicking over the market lag.

Will it hit our call price I dont know. But save the post, up 260 at the least.
thanks for this, very concise explanation.
Listen up you fockers! SPCE is not SpaceX! I repeat! SPCE is not SpaceX!
Yup asset bubble is on the way. So many people rely on their money to make more money. Too big to fail
That is retarded. I bet NIO grazes 35 before the rocket takes off again. Earnings come Nov. 17 and the shit fest is only going to last Monday and maybeee on earnings day.

Uhh he bought a call which gave him the right to buy the stock at a strike price. If it was in the money and he is auto assigned at expiration if he held.. he bought 100 shares at the strike of his call. So he may not be retarded, what are you saying?

Sorry, my post wasn't really clear. The short term catalyst is institutional buying and the momentum of the stock.

Institutions know(which is my guess), even if some fresh shares come up it won't be as cheap as it is now. Probably this is why the stock went from around 1% institutional ownership for sometime(because of direct listing) and then suddenly started to pop.

Have a plan before you buy. Have a target price to buy at, a long term date for expiration so that if things get rocky you can wait it out, and a calculated price you want to sell at.
I'd rather make money than cry about markets not doing what I think they should.
did you click your heels after?
I'm sorry but why wouldn't you buy shares on NIO? No expiry = infinite gains when NIO reaches 42,069.

The concept of what they do isn't what's hard for me to understand (being a paranoid fuck that I am). What I don't quite understand is why are they hailed as the top company in the space. Do they have first mover advantage? Is their AI better than others? Is it the cool Lord of the Ring reference?

I did this before the election and lost 14.5k, 70% of my portfolio. Although the market is fucked up, it's too hard to time the crash. I think it's better to trade as a bull from day-to-day and have a bearish hedge position that's going to print bigly if the market does tank. Am considering buying some slightly OTM UVXY calls expiring Jan 2022. There are probably more elegant ways to do it, but I'm retarted enough to have lost 14.5k on election puts.
yessir, it was above 5T a couple weeks ago but ~0.5T flowed back in...only.

Lmfao. You are not thinking like an investor. The entire world has undergone some level of lockdown since January yet the market marches to ATH due to unprecedented liquidity by the FED. Additionally, money needs to go somewhere and bonds are and will continue to be complete shit, thus the monetary inflows into equities. Until the fed stops supporting the market and bond yields rise the environment remains risk on. You've got some small brain, short term thinking going on...

You need to look at what currently exists. GM got bailed out, Ford almost went bankrupt. These are institutions in this country and they almost went under. There are more of their vehicles on the road than anyone.

The vehicle market is already established with price points. Vehicles are not new, there isn't some giant unknown market for them. It is a very well known market.

EV market is projected to reach $1T in like 10 years. And $60bln is overvalued? üòÇüòÇ
Yeah the HK market generally follows the NYSE from the previous day. Being down has no technical or legitimately accurate indication of what it will do in the NYSE
Off the market for their EV division. Not good for trading.
Time to invest in time machines
Baba tencent and bidu are facing new regulations from the chinese gov due to monopolizing the market, personally I want to see how bidu reacts tomorrow will it pull a baba
All these peeps holding BABA and I'm over here drooling at my JD üëÖ

I see your 3500 and I call you 3800
OP: sorry boys...my mom will be down tomorrow. Down to fuck all wsb autists who buy Nio calls
[deleted]
No 9988 reacts to BABA. look at how 9988 is touching new lows the same way BABA did on friday. Compare them monday night and youll see

They deactivate them even if the restaurant fucks up?
how the fuck are they going to get a 342 B valuation??? 
99% of defense contractors are under 150 B valuation.

How do you know that $5T hasn‚Äôt been put in yet?

lowest baba will go is 240 right
Guys I got a new ticker coming out. It's like if TSLA and AMD fucked, and NIO and PLTR fucked, and both them had babies and they met up and fucked.... Stay tuned.
The market will eventually hit 0. Just gotta time it right
Maybe it will only go up 1% instead of 2%
this stock sucks fat dick
Citron just wanted to make the stock lower because he missed out on the tendies.
If you have feb calls you will be fine, I think jan should be ok too if you got strike under $300.
Nope. NIO 100 PT.

Hold pltr and go fuck yourself.
whaaaaaaat
If you're being serious do not use this sub for gathering advice.

My advise to you would not to invest in NIO. It's pretty risky right now, and your safest and most reliable choice would be to invest in a company that's been around for a good while that has rising stocks and is going to be around for another 20 years. Microsoft is a good example. If you had put $3k into Microsoft 5 years ago, your 3k is now 12k and that's if you let it just sit there and not put anymore money into it. 

I would say if you are dead set on putting money into NIO, don't put all of that 3k into it. Put 2k into reliable stocks and 1k into NIO but wait for it to dip in a few weeks. Nothing can go up this fast and stay at that price forever.
Until Wednesday at 12:01am then outdoors only
Is there some news I‚Äôm not seeing, it‚Äôs down like .26%?
Baba will once again be a steal at $230.

Apologizes queen. Preschool through grade 8 still open, outdoor gatherings of 25 or less, public transit, funerals, professional sports, retail and mfg all still open. So I ask how is that shutting down? Lol

I just need BABA to hit $312 by Friday so I can break even

Positions?
Someday they open green and we open red. There's a few instance they were up 2.5% and we down 1%. It doesn't really mean anything except to make me nervous of my calls.
Yeah I lost 7k Friday on nio because I didn‚Äôt realize my stop loss wasn‚Äôt in place. Would have pulled a 4K gain early Friday morning if it had been ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A fellow schwaby!
I hope NIO pops tomorrow so I buy some puts. A lot of bag holders here. Anything above $45 is a good short!
Yes and no

Trading speculative financial instruments could be considered business income. And believe me, if you have 1 million in your TFSA, the CRA will audit you.
Michigan ain‚Äôt locking down lol. Governor Whitmer just announced that bars and restaurants can‚Äôt service indoors BUT still outdoors. You can still go to gyms and get a haircut. Jesus quit taking things and twisting them.

Lots of BABA, and lots of SPY puts, and 60% other stuff. Yeah I'm stressed watching this. Best just wait till morning
I think he could drive this rift with China to never seen before levels tbh.
Dow good

I still have faith it will come back. I am somewhat hoping it trades sideways or slowly for a bit though, I have more cash landing that I want to blow on BABA leaps.
There are still many unknowns. Vaccine, the election, rona cases worldwide, lock downs. I hear many places in US are flirting with more lock downs so this can cause another panic. If the President gets reelected then you can expect riots from the opposition. If the vaccines don't get approval you can see despair.

I‚Äôm holding a call
Why am I sketch of this post?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT AHHHHHHHHH
Chyna stonks keep playing hard-to-get. Janko made me rich then took it back. Same w NIO. Same w Baba. Fuckers are sitting on Scrooge McDuck piles of cash laughing at how easy it was to play me.
Imagine waking up to a -4% thrown at ur face u woke up.

Cut my puts into pieces

This is my last resort
Well that‚Äôs just rude.
Hopefully green
I think this will print. 
I‚Äôm trying to get a call too.
Yes. They take the loss and then deactivate the driver if too many orders they've delivered get comped. If you say you never got the order then the driver just gets deactivated flat out if they are new or if they have more than 1 "undelivered" report.
It was 2.6 bucks a few weeks ago.
Every EV maker could be Tesla 2.0, but there's only one Tesla, just like there's only one Amazon. Maybe 1 other can rival them eventually, but that's a fools chase.
Baba boys compare BABA and 9988 and see that 9988 is following BABA for the.most part.  This is the reaction to our friday print.
Talks going poorly again. Probs good time to build a position for 2-3 months out
I felt targeted
BYD is not NIO.
aint i tell u fucks, us 500 surpasses tech100 in 3...2...1...

Nah. Everyone‚Äôs selling TSLA so they can buy NASA now
Lmao why is baba going down

I don‚Äôt even own any and I think their dump is way oversold
Im doin shares more than calls; markets too irrational. I expect those to print within the next 3 years, but whotf knows when

for anyone curious, i am holding both $70 and $45 C 11/20 bought at 43 so i feel a lot better knowing im in the same boat as a lot of you. just wish there was a super convenient way to talk with people of similar calls live and all plan on a price to pull out at and enjoy team wins. now that would be really cool
Yes!! I bought BABA Nov 20th $260 calls last friday at the bottom of the daily chart expanding wedge pattern, huge upside potential here on the 1 week to 3 month time frame. 

BABA rebounding to $280-300 in 1 week would not surprise me!
Damn feel bad for BABA bulls...looks like they're actually fuk in all this green
fuck no, it's a god damned cesspool
Recovery gonna take a commanding lead Monday and Tuesday, then have a trash Wednesday and Thursday and finish off the week with a strong Friday

I'm guessing nio will have a solid -25% this week. Fingers crossed
OP: Sorry boys AMD will be down big. intel is down and intel is way bigger than AMD
The pump is all fake, DJT will win in court and tech will tank the market when that happens.

Warrant is like an option. Gives you the right to buy at a certain price up to a certain date. For this stock the strike price is $11.50 and the date is May of 2026. You'll never find an option that far out, and if you did the premium would be MUCH larger.   


Currently the warrants are about $2. So $13.5 break even price. Current price is $10.4. So needs 30% gain within the next 5.5 years. Seems pretty safe actually. And if it rockets up you could make a killing.

I'm about to go say dumb stuff here but that Pension fund that just bought NIO. China stock is already a bad investment because of book cooking and sudo capitalism - payouts and dividends not likely to happen - etc. Perhaps their buy in was for the recognition of the buy in, stock price reacts to "they know something", and then they sell. It's obvious from many of these comments that there is mania going on, and twitter wallstreetbois are completely manic. Actual payout from NIO in the event of its success is long-term, absolute, and non of these fuqs are gonna stay in that long. Worth a look to check the ratio of small to large investors, if its a bunch of smaller types then come January or whenever the Corona virus stimpack ends would be when everyone needs to make rent.

Your put might be too early. Look at NKLA, while after the hype it took about a month before it began approaching pre-mania levels. Then again its peak wasn't as high. GG.
Let me here everyone‚Äôs predictions for babas open tomorrow???
I think another one of the things that make the market so difficult is that on green days basically ALL of your positions have to go green. Or if you're short they ALL have to plummet for you to have a chance. If even a couple of them go against the market your gains will be severely crushed and you won't make enough paper gains on the day. Not making enough is maybe the biggest problem because you have to make up for your future mistakes.

So not only do you have to get the market direction right, but your positions have to cooperate with your viewpoint. Or eventually you'll just get frustrated, screw diversification, and yolo it all on one play like NIO calls/puts.

Hate to be bearer of bad news but it's on the way down in HK.

It's unclear if this is a decent indicator yet. On friday it was up 4% on HK and went down on NYSE before closing down ~0.7%.

So perhaps HK follows NYSE? Guess we will find out via further observation.

All the influence and power lies with these two guys. Nobody trusts gyna & its little dictator so US is always safe. US will keep on brrrring digitally and everyone pretends its no big deal. 

What about  the inflation? We already seeing it in housing price, stonks and big money stuff. 

Where things are heading? Wealth gap will become wider but as long as food and entertainment is there, who cares. 

Is it sustainable? Absolutely. Chaos is a ladder as we seen with Covid. Everybody is better off than before. Everything is bullish.

net positive is what you pay gains on. for my example. I had roughly 20k in losses for 3 years 17,18,19.

This year I'm up some absurd number like 130k.
I called my accountant and asked:

 'hey bro, so i know i been realizing those 3k capital losses for a few years, but i got a 10bagger this year and alls good. what can i do to reduce my tax bill'

and he explained that the carry-over losses are applied fully to wash out any capital gains. and then after, you can apply 3k to your regular income if losses were greater, or you just pay capital gains tax on the remaining gains.

So yea. also here's some gains from the other month before the NIO shenanigans.

Obviously theres heaps of exemptions and unusual situations, but generaly soeaking when you sell a stock or an option for a profit, thats just added to your income ans you owe tax at the top personal tax rate youre subject to.

Whaddya think the whole cgt argument on housing was about?  Its mainly about stocka getting hit with taxes but capital gains on housing being exempt and creating an imbalance.

Seriously, get an accountant....if youve made large gains you needa cover your ass stat.

Oh haha, gotcha
With blind certainty you just said earnings were already priced in. How would you know that? It's not affirmation I'm looking for I'm just giving my opinion. I believe NIO's ER reaction will likely correlate w/ recent events (LI, XPEV earnings).

definitely agree with the gaps being filled.  as far as 3500 being changed to support, i dont think its very strong.  the volume is higher than it was last time it was crossed, but i think a pullback from 3600+ (if it happens this week) would carry enough momentum to break back underneath, as the prospect for gains diminishes
Been on NIO since 3/share still holding strong. They said the same thing about Tesla.
Do you use emojis because you lack the ability to actually communicate in written form and have to resort to techno-hyroglyphics?  Or are you just so soft that words on a screen hurt your feelings?

Also, you literally were just saying people are broke if they closed their NIO positions in Friday.  Seems like you can give it but can't take it.

He‚Äôs going to push the Chinese ADRs off the market. At the moment, there is no way to audit these companies.  Not doing it to punish these companies. Doing it to protect US investors from fraud. 

For example, NIO could just decide to close their doors and keep all the investors money.  In the PRC, it‚Äôs not illegal to defraud foreign entities.  Not saying that NIO intends to defraud their investors...but there‚Äôs absolutely no consequence if they do.

What he said ‚àÜ
Actually fuck it. Not selling GM 12/18 calls. It sounds like there is an EV press conference this week. 

I bought in because there was heavy OTM call buying so I tagged along. Up 45% already but think I‚Äôll let it ride.
lockdowns in washington confirmed for at least 4 weeks. so probably more like 3-4 months.

270 C 11/20
Yeah the UK announcing that they‚Äôre pushing all cars to be electric and the new projection of 100,000 vehicles shipped isn‚Äôt gonna help the stock at all
It‚Äôll be 50 before market opens

Whenever you need the money.
If it jumps 10% in a day, then buy puts and wait for the daily sell off. Or buy calls and sell when it has jumped. You can make money if a stock goes up, down or sideways. When it‚Äôs volatile you can make even more money. Try doing that with Ford and see how far it‚Äôs gets you
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm buying at open of it shows it‚Äôs bottomed
Lol ok? I still make good profit
Your an idiot if you think this news has any effect on Nio at all lol

12/18 is probably too soon. At the moment it doesn't look like the dip is being bought in Hong Kong. BABA down 1.56% in pre market rn.
Lol
In the same boat. 45c bought at $42. Easy $$$$$$
Good thing you still make money on that, and that‚Äôs less than once a week this year
I honestly can‚Äôt believe citron has the balls to short another EV stock based on valuation after getting T bagged by $TSLA. Any shorts that piled in NIO on Friday are going to get fleeced hard.
So how many times a day does everyone jack off? Do you do it at work?
Big mouth
Live in FL, can confirm
Both NIO bears and bulls have shit cases. Bulls will probably win just because stocks only go up.
Our grandparents were asked to go to war for country and liberty hung in the balance.

Good work America. You really doing your legacy proud.
^ this. At $270 strike it would have been a surer bet but at $280 I would be trying to close those at a profit ASAP as there is still a lot of risk in BABA falling and then taking until next year to recover.
bite your tongue
ZM thoughts this week?
Where my ‚Äúbuy the dip on BABA‚Äù retards at?

Trump not conceding hasn't had any impact on the economy so I doubt that him conceding would have a positive impact.

30K in one stock? Wow, I wish I was you, Mr. Gates.
seems bullish to me
Aha, yeah, you're right. I'm playing OTM on these hoping for a quick spike and will close out.  I also get more contracts this way. The risk of a downdraft wiping out this position is real, which is why I wish to derisk and sell the weekly CCs.  That said, this is a very small position for me.  I probably have 60 individual Silver plays with more Capital than this one.  If I were putting in 'real money', I would want 90 days minimum.  This would also be a great time to load up on $270-$280 LEAPS.

I used to work for vg. They are heavy into their philosophy which to their credit works very well and was created by them, which is to invest in mutual funds and have a long term low cost outlook. They are pretty against day trading and probably don‚Äôt make option trading as easy or as cheap as their competition due to this.
Suggest you develop investment maturity before you lose more. Write down each trade you lost and trying to understand the cause.

Don‚Äôt be fooled my friends, they are playing us till the last second.
It's clear why the sub is being scraped for data.  Investing at the moment is about momentum moreso than valuation in many cases these days.  Those who are trading momentum plays are likely winning, until at some point the market inevitably goes back to thinking about valuation.   Not really a matter of if but when...

‚ÄúThe path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.‚Äù

500 loss for options is nothing

LOL, sounds about right!!!
Ah ok i also trade options since October but thankfully I doubled my portfolio I never bought options that expire so soon why would you do that, just to get more options for your money?  also why none of your options made you money so far half my options made me 200-300% and the other half are pretty much worthless now with few weeks to go
Could have been NIO or Elon or üåàüêª

They're very useful. Tx and Ca could both use a network but there's no way the public approves funding to build a large scale system right now and big airlines and oil are going to spend as much as they can.

There are so many reasons to be bearish  


* Testing ATH
* Triple peak
* 185k+ infections a day
* Vaccine not available until April
* Lower earnings across the board despite ATH for every company  


And only one reason to be bullish

* Moderna vaccine hopes

If you do your research you will understand Virgin Galactic is the real deal.  And when Tom Hanks is uploading his pics on Instagram in the spring you will wish you jumped on this bandwagon.  

But beyond that the company has plans to go global with a entire fleet of spaceships that are currently in development.  Scaling the business will be critical and the company is working towards that as well.

Certainly, weeklies or briefer periods are evaluated on a time span that can ignore basic capital excess supply situation. That's why you hear the good advice to buy monthlies on every and all dips. 

You may have seen that rules post earlier today. The guy said 80% or more in cash when playing options, because the upside is always in buying the bottom of dips, which in volatile markets are fairly predictable for rebound, again due to money supply.
It‚Äôs red now

The expansion point is def a real concern.   


Also a ton of the most driven people were just waiting to go public, be able to sell their shares, bail, and do their own thing. i.e. talent will leave  


Ergo, PLTR could still print money as a tech company, but the talent won't be as much of the reason going forward.

So without the earnings run ups the only bet is whether the market likes the report or not regardless of good or bad. Cause apparently good is also bad. Ugh.
This is wild, some people are saying SPY 370 some are saying SPY 330 üòÇ
God damn I hate the news. I go on google news and you literally have to scroll for 5 minutes until you get to the Science section to see any mention of the Space X/NASA launch. We're too obsessed with shitty politics.
Fucked out my betting positions üò•
Thanks for the write up, I may give it a shot. How do you expect price movement to go on the way to 30s? Sudden moves or small increments over time?
You‚Äôre only getting fucked if you‚Äôre carrying a wash sale position into the next year. Or if you trade back into a wash sale within 30 days of the new year.

I wasn‚Äôt shorting spy the entire time that was only when I shot up and ranked within a week. After that I was just messing around with weeklies and got burnt on pretty much all of them. I made some good money on Tesla back in August but held too long and got burnt again. Weeklies killed me though.
Oh I bet. Are you in at a decent cost average? Cause yeah, if you were in at $20 and sold a $50c you‚Äôd come out with 60% plus like $600-$700 in premium, then some one would of probably exercised you and made a lot. Then bought right back in when it dropped $10 haha

Nice, rock on. for me it's financial case studies that have made me live like an "addict" looking fuq and stressing out but hopefully all over Wednesday once 25% more of grade is in. Funny how you actually start learning shit in college i n the final year, such a "game" and scam.
Personally I just think it was people taking profits cause we saw an 8% gain on that week alone. And if you‚Äôre into technicals, it‚Äôs old resistance was used as support (350). So can the market get a bit extended at times? Sure, but I won‚Äôt be surprised if we continue to push higher from here.

The only thing I don‚Äôt like is all the gaps below us. They tend to get filled. Don‚Äôt have to, but they could. But vix falling is keeping me bullish. I will keep an eye on that.

Go look up the actual source he put in his video description: it was written nearly a year and a half ago and was for es8's not es6's.

Only when VIX is lowest can the inverse delta hedging effect caused by flash put buying be strongest.

The move does need to be quick though.

I guess what I'm saying is if I buy the puts with enough time on them, and I can bank on a VIX spike, I will be able to get out of them at a profit as long as I see a 5% pullback, which seems fairly likely with the move the market has made in the last week.

Correct, but you could still be in a position to where you can't claim it for that calendar year.

So even if you're negative, you'll still owe taxes for the year if the wash sale rule applies. It was a very unexpected surprise for me one year when I thought I could deduct 3K that year for my losses, but I ended up having to pay taxes on a 5 figure 'gain'

To be on this sub you need to be intelligent enough to know the market exists, know about options trading, and have an interest in some level of quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis. You also have to be foolish or brave enough to take major risks.

What you said proves my point .  Commercial airlines run thousands of flights a day without accidents.  

Virgin Galactics spaceship is the only one, I repeat the only spaceship that flies horizontally with wings.  It‚Äôs not a rocket that goes up vertically.  There have been numerous studies to show how safe it is and how serious the company takes it.  The risks in a horizontal take off system is less than a rocket taking off vertically .

Your misguided on how risky it is.  While I certainly will not say it is risk free it is as safe as a any commercial jet leaving a airport if not safer and there are numerous studies to prove that.

I concur but I mean we all know the market is volatile precisely because hot money as well as excess money is accumulating. I'm just saying that the longer volatility lasts, the harder and more sustained the subsequent bull market as that accumulating money is increasingly needed to be deployed.

It's actually true, just leverage index funds up to your personal risk tolerance; no losses so far, but uppies big time.

You‚Äôre not thinking like an investor. More lockdowns are going to spook investors. Why would they take the risk of investing in a climate such as this when other investors are pulling their money out.
Is puts at open, sell at close. Calls at close, sell at open almost a 90% win rate the last 10 months?
Major oof
So fucking proud of SpaceX

And Elon but SpaceX specifically is the fucking future. Wish I could buy stock, I would buy like 100k and never sell
I dont buy poots bitch
It's called the ev bubble
I actually just had talenti ice cream and hot coffee.
Incredibly overvalued too early. Will be $200 by 2030, but not now. They have high valuation bc growth numbers compared to peer Chinese EV firms. Tesla competition is about to absolutely smite that growth with a better car prices $12,000 less only made and sold in China

NIO is absolutely boned short term by the model Y‚Äôs Jan 2021 China release

I'm not referring to the duration of the long call: I'm referring to the delta of the long call.
I usually use DITM calls to write shorter-dated calls against. Here youre using a low-delta call. Isnt it dangerous in that it will collapse pretty fiercely in the event of a downdraft?
I don't think robinhood is the problem here...

These "Stocks gain as Vaccine eases peoples corona fears" headlines are so lame. As if we're not already in a bubble even with a vaccine next month. Earnings have been down across the board and we're testing all time highs for the 3rd time in a couple months
It‚Äôs definitely possible to beat the market consistently, but I‚Äôve had more success holding for 1-3 months. You actually have some major advantages as a retail investor. You can sell at good prices without influencing the stock. You also don‚Äôt have to deal with clients and you can do whatever you want since it‚Äôs your money. Luck plays a part, but like with anything else you can learn and get better. The game is open to everyone

Yeah kinda glad I work M-F 8-4 bc when I take a day off "to do hw" I literally tell myself on every hour that I'm going to start then. Then I say "I'm going  to go hard af at 4" and  proceed to watch after hours until about 6:30 while minimally doing shit.

Nope you are pretty stupid
It‚Äôs a great company for long term calls. No doubt post pandemic 

But with potential closings that hurts their revenue. 

They lost 1.2 billion in sales, store closures and limited sales channel. Operating hours decreased. 

They also opened 480 new stores world wide, which could get effected by said closures.

Don't the customers credit ratings come into play as well? Mixing junk credit with good credit to make it look like an easy, low-risk $35 profit?
Yikes guys. Y‚Äôall are missing the point. I have no positions with NIO and don‚Äôt want anybody‚Äôs calls to be fucked. It‚Äôs just the blind certainty with a little bit of intuition sprinkled in. Keep searching for affirmation, it‚Äôs all over this sub.

Scottish mortgage trust already have a stake in spacex if want to get into it. 30% if their holdings are unlisted firms like spacex, Airbnb, pltr before etc. They're UK's Best performing Trust fund and on the ftse100
If I understand your question correctly, with a shorter dated call (sub 2 months), I will happily cash out with a 40%-50% gain - and often less.  The strike price I'm willing to sell covered calls for is 'generally' the price I'd be happy for the stock to get taken.  At $280 this coming Friday, I would probably be up 50%+ on my overall play.  I've have also done similar this year with $280 LEAPS. Tldr - I will 'gamble on 6-18 month plays' but I want to take singles/doubles on anything shorter term.

I remember this. Two days after (18th) was Donald Trumps national address where he told a bunch of CEOs to talk about how they're going to do testing and help with the pandemic. Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and Target shot up 10% due to their testing news.

Same day I made the decision to be bullish in a bear world by buying into Slack and ESTC as well as SWBI (AOBC at the time). Those calls single handedly saved my fucked portfolio. 

Crazy to think that QE did so much, and if I could go back in time I would have bought into Square, Zillow, Apple, and I would not have sold my MSFT calls for break even prices.

Look at sjm puts if we down trend bidu also they had a bit of negative news over the weekend
Calls on park place and boardwalk
It works sometimes. I YOLO'd into NET when they made their big announcement back in Oct and mooned. Opened at 50 and closed at 55 that day. The other time people made bank was when CRSR mooned when LOGI reported Q3 earnings. CRSR was up huge before open, but kept going up the next 3 days or something.

This strategy fails a fuckton, but sometimes you can catch it right. Usually it seems to work out when its a stock that hasn't moved much and has been undervalued, then gets a big catalyst that causes it to just keep running.

Lmao. This is an incredibly subjective question with a subjective answer. It varies. Is it a high growth business? Easy to grow to new areas? Revenue is easier. Have all the customers in the market? Start cutting costs. Easier to boost income.

All eyes on WMT and TGT this week. Only reason I didn‚Äôt invest in WMT is bc the stores make me feel disgusting. TGT been diversifying their inventory and the inclusion of ULTA into the stores will def boost future growth.   I bought the $160 12/18 calls last week

Some people have forgotten that Tencent has invested half a billion dollars into NIO. I don't think Tencent or the Chinese government are going to allow NIO to fail.

I don't think NIO will climb back to $50 for a while. But Andrew's $24 price target is ridiculous.
\> If you are a bull close your app until December, if a bear go on margin  because the next 2 weeks is what you have been waiting since 2008 for.

Yes the cash on the sidelines remains a major factor. But just like September pullback, people will still sell if they think the bubble is popping

It can‚Äôt go on forever but I think we still have ways to go. Also, that fact that we are making higher highs and higher lows is extremely bullish. Plus the vix keeps falling now, meaning investors are expecting less downside. There is still about $4T of money sitting on the sidelines and always remember, the fed is still your friend and is keeping interest low. Also, earnings are still pretty good. In fact, many earnings are beating expectations because people were so bearish. Those who really need the stimulus are poor people and it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs still not done. White collar Americans are more likely able to work from home.
Fuck yeah
I've got 1/20/23 15 and 20s

I think LI is going to tank very hard. Kinda praying it moons at open so I can get puts.
Anyone have a link about cruises that supposedly someone posted in here about 2021
When will we expect their meeting results?
The catalyst doesn‚Äôt exist if the current business model is actually dead. Like even if they do turn the business around they aren‚Äôt changing their entire business model overnight and suddenly change the entire market‚Äôs opinion to cause a short squeeze. It‚Äôs going to take a while for GME to get where it needs to be which is going to give shorts plenty of time to cover as they slowly turn the business around (assuming they do turn it around).
I will be willing 5000 NIO 30 puts. Please buy.
Bought 100 AAPL shares down at 114. So happy about that. Gonna sell covered calls for about 50 bucks a month and sit on those puppies for a decade.

Pensions bought Nikola, NIO, and Zoom? the fuck is this shit

It *is* paid.  Cameo is a service where you can hire like A-to-D list celebrities to record a little video message. Some dude paid her to say that. She personally doesn't give a fuck about the stock one way or the other.

Although Andrew's Peloton report needlessly made fun of the Peloton Girl character by calling her a "confused and anxious Peloton wife."
I will sell everything of value that I can sell and put it in SpaceX once they IPO.

So it was GME two weeks ago, we haven‚Äôt even gotten over NIO and y‚Äôall obsessing over PLTR? Guess NIO gang gonna get Thanos clapped on Tuesday üòèüòè
Yeah I know its premature but got to thinking about it as I watch the spacex launch tonight.
I love the adrenaline. but that might just be the cocaine
Are you chewing gum? I said no gum
That's a sure thing. I mean, who else besides the reigning champ and our lord and saviour.
Monday non-leap plays:

GE 1/21/22 $12c $0.98 ask

CCL 12/18 $17.5c $1.20 ask

SNE 12/16 $95c $1.20 ask

WMT 1/15/21 $170c $0.94 ask 

All are somewhere short-term non-leap ER plays. Except WMT which is (ER on 11/17 pre-market) playing earnings nearly right away. Expected is $1.18, but I think they‚Äôre gonna blow it out of the water. If you‚Äôd want to seriously play WMT with a leap, look at the 1/21/22 $200c for a $350 ask. 

If you have any input, lemme know. Always happy to tweak.
You know the rules, if it doesn‚Äôt happen you have to drink pee in your moms basement
There was a 50-50 shot of it succeeding or failing. Good job.

NIO up 35% in Iraq Market
But... we are in the middle of the fourth quarter.
And if 1 flight in a thousand kills everyone on board?

I wouldn't go up for $10,000 or even $1,000. Not till I've seen tens of thousands of safe flights without a single death. 

Airlines do 176,000 flights per day during non-covid times. EVERY DAY. And we now go years without an airliner going down. I remember when you'd expect a major crash in the USA every year or two that kills most or all aboard, and that was normal. On average there are now 5.5 million commercial flights between fatalities. 

Virgin Galactic will almost certainly kill at a rate thousands of times higher than airlines, yet people are still scared of flying.
doesn't this look like one giant dick? the capsule sure looks so much like a dick-head
Yea...sure
I am newbie. Do you guys talk about ticker mooning on the basis of futures or is there some information about prices of stocks before premarket?

Fuck yea, My type of job, worked FedEx in the busiest warehouse in America for 2 years, manual labor > any other labor, get paid to burn calories. Where abouts are you located?
Well to be fair, there's like 1.5 month left. Andrew could still be right!
Yes pls
Will it still be ATH in two years? Probably not, so stfu and buy
Pewts are enticing

yes sir
what was the FSR news?
[deleted]
is this your entire net worth?
This is why I hate being pure cash gang over the weekend. Assuming we do see a lot of green tomorrow, a lot of its going to happen before open. If you want in on calls you'll have to FOMO into something that's already up and hope that it keeps going up all day. I guess you could look for something that hasn't moved much, but that you think will catch fire later in the day or for a fakeout that you can buy puts on. I hate all of these plans cuz it's mad easy to get burned. Safest thing could be to make your moves toward EOD

Price prediction for NIO & FSR at open tomorrow?
A little confused right now are we bullish cause of vaccine then why is tech up or are we bullish on lockdown then why is the DOW up
Here we go with the coulda woulda shoulda shit.
What technicals do you use aside from fibs?  What are those highlighted red numbers to the right?
Look and see why they posted a loss.
Why do you think I have this flair
Facts
Lowkey a good investment potentially. They were funded by the CIA for a while as a startup, and are winning DoD contracts like candy. Plus branching into other government sectors like Healthcare.
Russell Wilson fucking my parlay

if these futures hold Idk what to do tomorrow now. I was gonna try a strangle until now. any suggestions?
Same for anyone who's primary accomplishment is "being rich" or who has a value system that exalts "being rich" as its own end.

Money is irrelevant after you reach 2m invested (maybe even less is needed in some areas, not sure), that's about how much you need to be free and financially secure/not need to work to live comfortably -- and this is the primary value of money -- freedom. After that threshold is hit, it's 100% about the people in your life, the work you do, and achieving your personal goals.

Anyone who says otherwise is a low quality person and doesn't deserve respect, let alone admiration.

Less than 30 min
Sounds like you belong with the coastal elites. You might be too smart for your state
I see it tough to assume money can keep piling in at the rate it has been.  Investors are already likely running out of capital.  Total market cap to GDP ratio is at all time high, recently surpassing record set before dot com bubble burst.  Can't go on forever.
20 minutes
Oh the 2 19C 5/21/21 is for IPOB
Why dont retard realize NIO earning is priced in 3 month of relentless stock price increase. NIO just like Tesla tanks during every earning.
My opinion is that betting against the economy can give u an enormous return. You can easily 4x your returns with a good bet

i am here for the bear cope
Pretty sure bear should be a little concerned at this point
Yep, so about to get lock downed.

That's the risk with the stock, it seemed like the US just wasn't going to care and retail would stay open.

Conflicting news on what's actually going to happen and with the case numbers, seems even Republican areas might need to do it.

Logically their retail network in smaller cities without lockdowns should do them well.

But we are so far beyond that meaning anything.
Sell at open
I heard DMT
well it is, sometimes in the next 10 years lol.
Why?
lol somebody watches Stock Dweebs. they the GOAT

Yup Wednesday first, then Thursday as well. Wondering if I‚Äôm an idiot and they were hedges since they‚Äôre relatively high compared to underlying but not far off the ATH pre-covid (which is why I bought).
Pretty much every fundamental, news (exception being vaccine, but betting high on that now is too forward-looking given a likely long ass rollout), TA looking bearish across the board, plus common sense of where tf is all the money entering the market coming from when people are broke af and begging for a stimulus thats up in the air
Where do you guys go to see futures?
got tsla shares on Friday before the launch today. looking good so far.

You cannot buy a short put. It doesn't matter if its a weekly or not. The fact that you said this means you don't know shit. You can ONLY sell short puts by definition
You must be retarded if you think this sub has more than 0.0001% of its shares

The sub is a bunch of gambling addicts.  If anything skews high iq though not all.  I feel bad for those who don‚Äôt have their gambling under control.  

basically the people who are dollar cost averaging and buying ETFs are probably doing the right thing. 

Wsb are degenerates and know it. 

R/investing seems the most sad to me as they carefully try to do fundamental analysis on like large cap US and act like this is important.  If they enjoy it as a hobby fine but most of them aren‚Äôt going to have a risk adjusted return about passive.  

Not adjusting risk adjustment is pretty common.
people that bought NIO premarket on friday got fucked so good luck
What is that from on left?
I read that they are having troubles with refrigeration of the vaccine for transportation and delivery. Im not sure what that means but people might be holding out until they can have a guaranteed date of release where distribution is certain
Fellow autist posted about it a few posts down w a link
any idea what they charge you to short the shares? interest rate?
We could open +2% at this rate
So pltr is expected to run like nio eventually ?
Go ahead and bail, we didn't want you on the yacht anyways. <3
So, buy calls?
Customers and demand is not a issue.  The company and numerous analysts did studies on that.  In fact there is so much demand that they cannot build spaceships fast enough to build it and no one company or even multiple companies can meet the demand.

It will be a supply limited business for the next few years.  

The real question is: Can they scale the business?  Can the operate a fleet of spaceships operating worldwide from multiple different spaceports?  Can they scale the business and bring down the cost so now going to space is like going to Cuba?  

On July 15th, the company took on a new CEO.  Micheal Coliglazier from Disney who was president of Disney Parks international.   They hired him so they can scale the business.  

Now they are just one test flight away from full FAA licence to fly passengers to space with Richard Branson being the first one to go followed by numerous Hollywood actors.  The business is there, they just have to execute.

You do realize you posted on Wall Street bets that you probably lost your money gambling with options and now want to claim you are in good company with many smart people who probably also lost their money? Who posts such shit? What did you want to get out of it? A pat on the back? Good job kid?

Think about it for a moment. Your post is 100% pussy. Grade A.
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many inconsistencies. Scientists are saying December and the chief is saying April. Two very different endpoints. Shouldn‚Äôt be pushing the market up.

Same reason I had bought shares of PLUG and also AMD when it was in the low 20s, even more so with the IV on PLTR and general volatility in the market. When I see something I think can multiple in value several times I'd rather just have the shares and wait it out.

PLTR calls seem like an easy play, but the IV is insane and it's had some wild movements. Too hard for me to know what the ideal time is to buy a call and what the exp should be.
How about a nice pair of shoes?
Well yeah? I‚Äôm confused, are you implying I should buy more calls? Lmfao
What is vagina?
Should I dump some cash money in PLTR tomorrow?
I doubt it. But then again the market right now is so volatile that i wouldnt be surprise if it jumped to 1000.

Unless they have some amazing news and some new tech it wont go up
Yes, they‚Äôll all stream the only bit of news happening at that moment.. this‚Äôll mean nothing for the market
I mean it really depends. Early September was a clear bear setup. This week a clear bull one
I can finally nut hard tomorrow and break nut november.

I feel like the scenario of there being a potential pandemic developing was way more fitting news for a market crash, though... 

Also, companies are still making money? Why should Wall Street worry and sell when there‚Äôs still money to be made? Inducing doom, writing puts, selling off to support, and then rocketing a week later to burn those puts is a pretty lucrative business model... especially with the leverage of what‚Äôs going on with politics.

Only PLTR is more legit.

Don't hold through earnings bro ull more than likely get iv crushed

PLTR gang, we're eating W's tomorrow.
Vaccine RESULTS were released, not the vaccine itself. Two completely different things. The cases of Covid are still going up per day with cities being put on advisory lock down. Just because the vaccine has good results, it‚Äôs still not physically present. There‚Äôs no solid ETA as to when the vaccines will be distributed and given to the general public.

There‚Äôs money the Fed have to the banks that isn‚Äôt in the real economy, causing stocks to separate from the economy. A bit more complex than that, but that‚Äôs the main point: more money and low rates mean higher prices for assets even if the companies aren‚Äôt doing as well as before.

As you enter the casino a man with an armful of cash approaches you. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck buddy! There‚Äôs a table that always comes up black! You‚Äôre gonna be so damn rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.
You get to the roulette table. The attendant has a nametag that reads ‚ÄòBig Jay‚Äô. ‚ÄúThis is your lucky day.‚Äù he whispers to you as he leans in close. ‚ÄúFor a short time I‚Äôve rigged this table to always come up black. Just lay your cash down on black and you‚Äôll be rich!‚Äù You smile and nod.
‚ÄúRed‚Äù you say with a wink as you lay your cash down and load up on puts again.
You see the confused expression on Big Jay‚Äôs face as he spins the wheel. ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù he calls with a sigh.

That is pretty bad pay. In the Bay Area where they were located that is pretty much what everyone gets paid. The other places are underweighted because they take into account other locations outside the Bay.

Lol calling me a retard but you don't even understand what short puts are. You cannot buy short puts, the literal definition of a short of that you sell the contract. It does not mean short term put. He literally said he tried every strategy but theta gang which would be covered short calls and cash secured short puts.

I think you‚Äôre safe dude
You are running a lemonade stand. Your lemonade costs $1. You offer your customers the ability to pay for the lemonade over the course of five months, at $0.20/month. This increases your accounts receivable balance.

Since you are a cash junkie, you need your money now. You take your $100 accounts receivable balance and sell it to someone for $65 right now, and that counterparty can now collect the $100 from your customers and pocket the $35 difference over the course of the next five months.

It all works great until all of those people stop paying their bills.

Bought a put on amazon - praying they drop below $3100 lol
This reminds me of last December when trade war ended with a "phase 1" deal, SPY rallied to $300 and bears said this is the top and all good news is priced in. Then within the next month, we jumped to $339.

If it wasn't for the virus, SPY would have been at $400 already by now and it will get there soon enough. Good news is never priced in.

We crashed when there was a risk of a large scale credit crash. Major companies weren't sure if they were gonna be able to maintain enough cash to keep operations running. Then the FED stepped in and removed the threat, thus the rapid rally afterwards.

Reminder to everyone, historical performance doesn't guarantee future performance in the stock market. Just because it crashed in march when we locked down doesn't mean we will crash again. 

&#x200B;

That being said, just because the stock market didn't care about the 2nd wave in the summer doesn't mean it'll ignore this wave. There are a lot of uncertainties in the market right now; how new lockdowns will impact the economy, how the lack of stimulus will impact things. Don't just blindly jump into only 1 position, size your positions.
You know what, I can't argue this, seen it pump so many times only to sell off
Dude, to the market you are a poor person with only 12k.

Buy in companies you believe will be around in 20 years (example: Microsoft) that will continue to grow. Don't get into day trading.
Consider that if you put $14k into Microsoft 5 years ago and never touched it since you'd now have 70k at this point. Assuming a tax rate of 30% at most for you, you'd now have made a profit of $39k.

Yeah .. its had a few nice plump days but living dangerously w/ news horizon. If lockdown/covid fears are reason would expect to see whole mrkt red given high levels. Just a bit odd. Whole week is a huge risk both sides of covid/noncovid stocks until more is known on FDA timeline.

Yet I can't seem to make any money on these "rotations". It's like one day the market will decide it wants to buy the shit out of retail and boomer stocks and tank tech. Then the next day there's a bunch of red in boomer land and people buying back into tech. Wtf to do
Because I have shares. And 20>>>13
The [big red wave](https://imgur.com/a/RRCQ1zs) Donald Pump was talking about. SPY $300 P 11/30.
Meh I just need a VIX spike which is inevitable with what is currently going. Just like in June. Just like in September.

The economic data has been turning for months now and its only a matter of time before the holdouts like me get laid off and those jobless claims go up.

And the layoffs aren't going to be construction worker Joe. They're going to be people like me that companies have been keeping onboard because they don't want to blow up their knowledgebase (the thing that drives their entire company's value and ability to get work) and figured with numbers improving over the summer, that the economy would have improved much more by now, but it hasn't, and things are about to get a whole lot worse.

If I had 400k to blow on stonks I would give that 400k to a professional and tell them to do their thing so I can retire 10 years earlier.
Yes, gambling our money comes with great risk but doing fuck all until 80 and not risking money in a 0.001% interest account might be considered a bigger risk.

Boys, take these risks now and 4-5 years from today we good. Chartering private jets, club tables, hella pussy, drugs, festivals, Michelin star restaurants. Keep this vision in mind. It‚Äôs very real and worth the risk for sure.
Very green futures YES

But for BABA holders....expect it red/flat tomorrow
The US is great at exporting crisis. A major liquidation crash in the US would cause a dollar squeeze in the Eurodollar market and drag the world into hell. Even ‚Äústrong‚Äù EM‚Äôs like Russia would be crushed under the weight of a global depression (side effect of being so dependent on commodity values).

Don't think u can. I asked this last week here and and got down voted to oblivion. Deleted my comment in embarrassment in the end
covid cases going up is not the only thing happening right now. there are mulitple factors are at play, and the variables with more weight drive the market.

Stock's been sideways since '93. Shit the bed from 2017 until now even before COVID. Look for stuff that was growing before COVID, this stock was already slowly dying. Not to mention life insurance companies are really easy to value, you don't think there are 1000s of actuaries in the finance industry looking at this stock? If it's cheap, it's bc it stinks

Your portfolio is extremely diversified, if one ticker that is larger than the others drops substantially it wipes any other gains you may have made firm other tickers. Try focusing on only a few companies and do deep analysis on them

Look at Washington‚Äôs new restrictions and tell me that isn‚Äôt a lockdown.
I turned a bunch of 365c into 365/366c on Friday because I'm apparently a little bitch
Not sure about that. One thing I don't get is that company's left and right are posting record sales. From cars, real estate, retail, tech. It seems the most fucked ppl never contributed to the big corps bottom line.

I love the company, but it might be late to add more options this week. Honestly, selling strangles or broken butterflies might be the way.

Edit: Might sound boomerish, but shares/covered calls might also be the way.

Nio already mooned, it went back to earth thanks to Mr citrusfuck to refuel, now we going to mars
3 weeks at a time is their standard extension length. If you recall from March - June it was always "lockdowns extended for 3 weeks". Just long enough to feel close but also just long enough to re-evaluate and extend again
Also thanks to global warming large untapped resources

You won‚Äôt see any gains spread this thin. Put your big boy pants on and throw some real money at 3-4 stocks you believe in

TECH PUMPING! PLTR TO 100 TOMORROW!

lol paper hands
Shhhhh, ya hear that? Thats the sound of my puts being murdered
Where can you see individual stocks for futures?
Google is a weird fucking company. Also in retrospect their competitors in the cloud business likely wouldn't be supporting them by buying up these TPUs. They would likely just make their own specialty hardware. AWS already has this with inferential or whatever the fuck it is, but that's just for inference. Point is, if google can do it then it's likely Amazon and Microsoft could also end up doing it.
Lmao imagine going short
But it‚Äôs not a pump and dump, it‚Äôs a pump and pump
Limiting Olive Garden to 25% capacity and closing at 10 instead of 11 isn‚Äôt a lockdown.

WTF is this shiet. Can I get a crash tomorrow so I can buy the dip?
i mean its already ripped so hard bro, the upside is in the reopening plays g
What‚Äôs it like being an autistic prodigy
Yup
Shrek dick on the menu
ufff looking good (thanks for sharing)
Buying poots at open if this stays up until then. Ez money
This guy didn't buy calls
its up the highest percent
it also means big business makes less sales which means they lay people off rather than hire more, and then shit starts going down the shitter, which is why the fed / gov is scared shitless of a recession right now with debt at ATH, it can spiral down very fast and we saw that in march

this is also why im buying stocks / RE during these times, the fed / gov have no choice but to pump stocks to build consumer confidence
Well, time to get the Dow 30,000 hat back out.
Just saying... Michigan is starting lockdown mesures... no indoor dining, schools closing for 3 weeks...

Wait till they all start doing it and more
Can't wait to dump my shares on some schmuck that's going to FOMO tomorrow morning after buying puts last week.
All in on PLTR

Anyone feel like the US is in an inevitable decline? I mean imagine living in a place where even information itself is politicized and each half of the nation and their political parties essentially live in alternate universes of reality.

How the fuck can such a place maintain its position as the world superpower in terms of economy and technology?
Go PLTR GO!
I noticed this is the second time Boris Johnson was exposed to COVID and the futures went up. Happened a few months ago too. Might be something there.
No! Short dated calls!! Lolol
Whole foods is not that great. Too overpriced and niche. I think they realize this expanding their whole 365 brand but it will never be a one stop shop
Literally everything is bullish at this point. Market has been consolidating for months, we have a vaccine and more big news to come, covid is priced in , only way is up from here
Yea don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll be much higher come morning
Anyone know any good bars in the Orlando area
China stonks fuckin ripping this week.
Cuz COVID is good for the market. We‚Äôve been saying this for awhile now.

Were you under a rock last Friday when the corona task force announced this in a press conference.

>Roughly 20 million people could be vaccinated against the coronavirus in December, Moncef Slaoui, co-lead of Operation Warp Speed Friday. He added Americans can expect that about 25 to 30 million people could be vaccinated each month afterward.

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/13/trump-covid-vaccine-december-436481
You got butthurt enough by my truthful comments to go through my history? üòÇ
Time to FOMO my last bit of dry powder
testing support at 325. I would buy leaps and sell when the next vaccine news vaccine comes out and makes the stock drop another 15%.
Not even 30 mins into future opening and people counting their gains..
Learning how to copy a dumb monkey on how to lose money with options just causes you to be a dumb monkey. Just knowing a few things about stocks and options is like saying you know a few things about addition and subtraction and that makes you quite wise about math.

Do you not remember the market mooning when we were lockdown a few months ago?
whatever is happening is good for the NIO puts I sold EOD Friday
I go both ways and I did not think it would be this rippin.
Yeah, apparently the 'more' part is 'stonks only go up'

Check out AWML. Sold off 18% on Friday. Another telemedicine company. Could be due for a huge comeback this week

You really think pltr has that much potential to go to the moon?
Lots of smart people have gambling addictions. You get my point. Retarted!=dumb

Wow I feel so much better about my 60k loss now lol award given

Why?
Futures too low imo. We have stimmy and multiple vaccines coming.
if they are trades take profits, but if its long term holds, y u asking
Buying zoom puts bc it ruined his life
[deleted]
If these numbers hold, the Dow will open at an all-time high tomorrow. Nothing to see here. Move along.
I feel like moderna will be at best the same as the pfizer vaccine. If it were going to be a huge success I'd expect trump to have at least alluded to it on his Friday presser he's so desperate for good news right now
Already down -28%
how have you autists not realized that chaos, cases spiking, grim shit, etc. = stonks go up?
If we are up a good bit at open yea I expect profit taking
368 bro lol!
Even resident bears were bullish on the technicals and everything else going into this weekend. If you went short you done fucked up

NIO $100 tomorrow
The problem is if the moderna results aren't like "105% effective, everyone can receive it by next week" market will fall off a cliff.

You‚Äôre clearly the dumbest motherfucker on here. Please tell me you don‚Äôt trade actual money. 

$10 fairly valued (I got called out at $10 with options)

$15 overvalued (50% gain in six weeks is a little nuts)

Anyway you‚Äôre a fucking retard.
Investing.com, or the app
Uhh how the FUCK are futures up with several states reinstating lockdowns
That‚Äôs definitely your prerogative....but you‚Äôre missing out big time
Please let PLTR and TDOC be very green tomorrow so I can pyramid more puts

I would laugh myself silly if the only red stock on Nasdaq tomorrow is NIO. That will make my TSLA gains that much sweeter.

Michigan bros, we are getting cucked
I could have one if I wanted, but I can only talk about so much. I don‚Äôt recommend anything to my mom anymore cuz she doesn‚Äôt listen.  I recommended she doesn‚Äôt visit my brother twice a week because he doesn‚Äôt take the corona seriously.  It‚Äôs recommended to not have gatherings of 10 people or more.  So my brother thinks it‚Äôs safe to hang out with 9 of his buddies at a time without wearing a mask. He does this on a daily basis. First, he is an idiot that thinks he is safe for not gathering as a group of 10 or more. Second, he is an moron cuz he doesn‚Äôt realize he makes the 10th person.  He is basically the corona version of WSB.  A true autist of yoloing the virus.
Godspeed retard
I been holding AMAT stock since $15 and its over $70 now.

Sometimes I sell shit early but there's definitely times people hold through a pump.
Futures spooky green
$HON looks like it's poised to drop. 

$ACN had some unusual options activity last week with some autist making a single $700k order on puts expiring on this upcoming friday. The technicals line up and it also looks like it's poised to drop. 

$ADI looks like it's technically poised to drop as well. 

$ADM is in the top range of a descending triangle.
Finally someone with some sense these bulls are fucking retarded, not sure how hey haven‚Äôt lost it all already. Triple top on spy = 320 by eom

Every Monday rips for the past two months. PPT kick it into high gear on Sunday evening‚Äôs to pump futures. Market is manipulated, but you might as well make money off of it.
Moderna pump tomorrow morning probably.
Omg this pump is beyond what I imagined, I really needed this after last week

Bears brought puts to a printer fight
Like, I just wish I could gamble on an event and not on how the market would react to it.

Bulls when they said in May 'cases are going down, we'll be fine' - wrong

Bulls when they said in September 'cases are just going up because of testing, hospitalizations and deaths are fine' - wrong

Bulls when they said last week 'oh its getting worse, but nobody will be willing to lock down' - wrong

But they just chose up anyways so they are the ones that make the money
bullish
Way too much euphoria around here
and NIO
Could go up, could also go down
This just means we‚Äôre opening red. üò±

Russia little to no national debt they can pay of the national debt any day they want

They hoard tones of gold and precious metals if they choose to they can go to a gold standard and would be ultra stable.

Last 10 years they have bought tons of precious metals

They don‚Äôt have a shadow government you know who is in charge and they are stable government 

Population of Russia has low civilian debt compared to USA 

I think the Socialist have won the Cold War the general populous just does not know

Rosetta should help in most cases. Some dev stuff is a little more unpredictable though (Docker for Mac)

So AAPL 120 or 119.99 at open?
Late to the party, but exactly this. It is infeasible to raise interest rates with this much debt to service (pay interest on) without raising taxes, which wouldn't fly in a depression. 25% of gov't budgets to service debt is just insane.

That means it will have about a 1 billion market cap. So 1/5th the size of SPCE which has much less justification for its cap. If you like SPCE, SRAC or SRACW are a no-brainer. That's after 5 minutes to looking up stuff for me.
reality: 1/3rd of small business on verge of collapse, unemployment about to skyrocket, no stimulus, etc.

No. Many are dumb. The majority. Losing your money is not smart. A smart person would be smart enough to avoid losing it all because they realize they are dumb about this type of trading/investing. A smart person would research more on the odds of it actually working out in a positive manner.

Bought 3 packs because Costco was already cleared out. Home Depot had a bunch still

Why?
Lol really?
Lmao good luck
I suppose so but we‚Äôre pretty much exponential at this point with covid cases so I‚Äôm stumped
Dude you are actually way too diversified. Your gains will be minimal because you own so little shares of so many different stocks. What you would be better off doing is having fewer positions with more shares. Along with that choosing positions in the shorter term will offer you a decent return. At max with about $2k 5-6 positions. I also know nothing but too many positions. Like imagine your 10 shares of plug you could have doubled your positions for bigger gains instead of half your portfolio being red.

Try it again at -99%+ your credibility will shoot through the roof
What? I made so much money on the crash and rebound. So many of us did that there is articles about idiots making fortunes on this shit.

Thank you, Howard Cosell.
GO TECH GO!
On average VIX jumps above 50 at least once every 2-3 years and quickly drops back to 10s. Basically one winning trade is to short VIX every time it jumps above 40 and close your short when it drops back down to teens. Then you can go long with leaps until the next spike. Rinse and repeat.
Here‚Äôs a good video summing it up https://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0
Gamecocks are supposed to be small.  Like your account.

You should have been thanking him instead of giving him a hard time you self admitted paper hands bitch.

He is literally doing gods work, onboarding more retail onto Robinhood, grassroots Organic growth. He's built different.  Why do you think TSLA is what it was after covid lockdowns?  For awhile retail literally led the market instead of being the usual slaughter.  

This salesman is doing more for our community than your paper hands ever will and all you could do was bust his balls with Greeks?  If used car salesman doesn't work out try applying for polishing lazy left eye Andrew's pole
It‚Äôll happen when it‚Äôs least expected. VW short squeeze was an unexpected announcement by Porsche on Sunday afternoon.

The inevitable fading of futures
Why does some guy keep popping up on my YouTube feed for the past 6 months preaching that housing and stock markets are in a bubble and the great crash is coming. Dude has 200,000 subscribers.

Sometimes I read the comments and his whole subscriber base seems obsessed with the world global bubble. Oddly enough, most of them seem to say something like ‚Äúwhen will the crash come so I can afford a house‚Äù. Or ‚Äúthis market is fkt I can‚Äôt wait for it to crash so I can get a house‚Äù. 

Pessimists attract pessimists. No way the governments letting this housing bubble pop so ima just sit in my house and be glad I saved up and got one - rather than posting on YouTube vids about bubbles while spending all my wages on alcohol, hookers and takeaways.
All that celebrating for half a point with 15 hours to go? Jesus.

FUTURES GREEN, BEARS A FUK AGAIN
Need it to drop to 19 for muh puts. But it did break out of my expected downtward trend line Friday and has been rising in after hours. COVID raging, some state closures, and a bunch of people got COVID on a cruise this weekend. Honestly don't see why it's still rising.
Lmao all these shills. 65¬¢ a contract is nothing for faster fills. I moved to TOS right away for option trading

For those of you degenerates that actually have enough in your account to day-trade and make bigger options/stocks plays, what website or app are you using? 

Friday, Robinhood lost me a ton of money selling my calls on NIO because it froze and didn‚Äôt update the price for the first 5-10 minutes of the day.  

Additionally, RH has a lack of diversity of  penny stocks available and would prefer to start using my computer to start trading as opposed to staring at my phone the whole day.
It has a little cover that slides over it when it‚Äôs not spraying. Seems to be pretty clean. 
Lol the water pressure is insane though at full spray it shoots out of the toilet and onto the wall if no ones sitting on it
Guess I'll stick to wealthsimple. Paying 1.5% when buying US stocks is irritating though. Wish there was a cheaper subscription offer.

I don‚Äôt think any are as attractive as this opportunity. I considered oil and gas for a while - but sentiment is against that sector. I also thought about T - but the opportunity for capital gains is lower there even though the dividend is good. 

I would consider other options but I have strong conviction in this play for the long term and I‚Äôm paid a big return for waiting with the leveraged dividend

Bloodbath in 3 min

Yeah, I believe the news that MS and other console manufacturers want it to survive.

They need that retail presence around the US.

I don't know how they go about saving it if it shits the bird though (maybe the MS deal could keep them afloat).

Without figures it's all a bunch of what ifs.

The other part is that the entire PS4 and Xbox One backwards compatible disc library is in play.

So their sales of used games should increase dramatically from that fact.
why would that surprise you
Depends , if you have a non shit broker they will try to sell your contract. If they can't, or you have a limit price set, they send a "DO NOT EXERCISE" command to options clearing house and it expires worthless. That's why you should sell before market close

Honestly do what I did and do what my mentor did get your real estate license learn how to sell homes for every 3 to 4 homes that you sell buy one for yourself fix it up cheap and rent it out put it on a 30 year fixed mortgage and forget about it and then go do it again and again and again once you get to 10 homes then you should have you know depending on the value of the home you should have a good amount of equity in your 10 homes then you can go to a local bank get a line of credit for half a million or $1 million and then keep selling homes and buying homes and then before you know you‚Äôll get to 20 homes then you can pull out 1 million out of the first 10 homes and  1 million from the second 10 now you got you know 20 homes you‚Äôre probably cash flowing about 10,000 a month and then you‚Äôve got $2 million and then just keep going and doing it again to 30 homes then 40 and so on.

Your intro takes 15 seconds.

That doesn't count for growth.
Besides the revenue sharing the rise was also about Cohen having input and offering to help push the company into an ECOM competitive with amazon. Following this path GameStop would eventually push out of just video games and gaming merch. Chewy didn‚Äôt just sell dog food. It sold lots of niche exotic pet stuff, horse saddles, and had great customer service. 

I‚Äôm in as long as he‚Äôs in and institutional consistently scooping up shares who weren‚Äôt previously involved makes it seem like somethings going to happen. 

The stock is definitely suppressed by the brick and mortar = bad mentality the volume is extremely low. Not even sure if shutdowns would move it one way or another it‚Äôs so disconnected from the market. Lags behind the Russell. 

It‚Äôs a fun speculative but there‚Äôs not much price action so I understand why it‚Äôs not WSB caliber anymore.

I sold my 11/13 48p for 200% when it could have been 700% because of the constant reversal Friday. Bought back in to 11/20 44.5p and XPEV 11/20 40p. 

My reasoning is the company has run up way too far recently and earnings report will not justify current evaluation, and should drag other EV with it. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong and out 900. Maybe I‚Äôm right and collect 200% again.
Hope it works out for you I blew up my acc with them last week üòÇ

Gamestop made the technically-not-great-for-security but very fortuitous for stock traders choice to make their order numbers sequential. If you submit two orders on Gamestop.com an hour apart, the difference in order numbers will be (roughly, because it probably includes cancelled orders) the number of orders submitted in that period. A number of people are tracking this, like uberkikz on Stocktwits.

They are a data warehouse.

Basically, they are a large database that allows you to centralize data collection. Think e-commerce, or large hotel chains, or the government.

Then they allow you to access that data in all different ways. Compile reports like which hotels are busiest at what time of the year, or how many people between the age of 18 and 20 entered New York From Austria on November 20th.

And when you offshore data, it means you are getting more and more of it every year which means their customers end up paying more and more forever.

TL;DR - it can't go tits up

I mean sure it wouldn't hurt, but then you have twice the capital contributed to your position. Ask yourself how much exposure you want, how much money you want to tie up in the position and how much delta/gamma you want at any given moment. Shares are 1 delta. Short puts are usually .30-.40 for the same capital but that much less risk. Calls are usually low delta but significantly less capital. It's up to you what exposure you want.
Fuck yeah

Pfizer is only saying 50 million doses this year (which covers your olds, but leaves a lot of first line responders uncovered). Plus, that vaccine has to be stored at -70C. 

Getting back to normal is contingent on vaccines being widely available. COVID hasn‚Äôt really hit the stock market yet (yes, I remember March). We haven‚Äôt really seen the effects of mass long term unemployment (which is primarily affecting the low echelon workers). 

I think within the next year we are going have a serious reckoning. Sorry, but recessions don‚Äôt last a month.

To answer your question if you should buy into PLTR: Yes.
Jesus, how do you walk with balls that big?
being in IT I would say yes. A lot of people in my field are starting to post on LinkedIn "i just completed this course on udemy"
Both France and Germany left schools open, I‚Äôm going to venture that others did as well
He's running out of time and good lawyers for that kind of battle. Also many trillions of dollars being blown-up along the way mean that it'd get stopped way before the SCOTUS.

Besides, it probably wouldn't even make it to an appeals court. Trump would say "blah blah sanctions" and the trade attorney would say "actually, nah" because wall street, chamber of commerce, etc. would swat that shit like Shaq. Mango can release scathing intel but he's already tried all the hurtful tariffs he could during the trade war.

I timed it right with that MS online revenue sharing news. Was +15% in two days.

I'm out completely with lockdown news, even though I can buy back in where I got shook out.

Well, I'm all in on tesla calls, leaps, and shares right now.

If there is a run up to 12/4, that scenario is sell everything on the pump.  Which is +$.

If it plummets, you buy the dip.
If it happens and skyrockets, you buy back in.  SP should continue to go up past the first 5 minutes of Monday so you'll lose the gap up but still get gains.

If there is no run up and no IV spike, convert a couple shares or calls into a ton of deep otm weeklies.  If it doesn't happen, not much loss of value on those deep otm weeklies since there's no IV crush happening and you just held over the weekend.  Small loss on that in exchange for possible exponential gains.
I get it, it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt 1400% return on weekly FD‚Äôs. Shoulda known better then posting gains on shares

They go in, learn about an organization's needs and challenges and then set up their software, customized to the organization's specific situation, to take all the data that  organization has and organize it and analyze it with the end goal of making it far easier for a human being to find patterns that would otherwise be inaccessible.
I would probably want to see how they are doing as a company, I think it's a really low overhead business model overall

I see the potential for a double dip recession around Feb 1st. EU has shown that very strict lockdowns including longer school closing are quickly needed. Also, almost nationwide testing of the whole population (or larger areas).  


Is the U.S. ready for hard lockdowns? Will there soon be a large stimulus package? Will the Fed intervene heavily? Will there be a sudden new medication?  


The vaccination is too late in spring to be distributed on a large scale.  


Probably it will be similar to March, dip of the markets and tech staying strong.

Same story here.

So when NIO started to initially sell-off I was like here we go again I'm not letting a pullback get me this time but it was actually some cockblocking bullshit that clipped NIOs wings. I recouped some back on the downside but the damage was done.

Wtf is PLTR. I read the description and it still doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Explain it like your talkin to a 3 year old
It‚Äôs a hypothetical change. However volume is so low, it‚Äôs not going to be a big change. That time isn‚Äôt going to effect you tho. If it wanted to move big up or down and the big boys weren‚Äôt allowed to trade at that time, we would just see the change during pre market.
so would you recommend selling cash secured monthlies on my long positions?
Alot of people are questioning the validity of test results. When these rapid tests are reporting false positives it is not as if they go back and adjust the counts. Additionally when you hear about how reporting any death in a hospital as a covid death benefits a hospital financially it just leaves too much room for doubts. Clearly it is not a hoax but if you feel that way stuff like this is ammo for your argument

It's like learning how to ride a bike when you're very young.  

Crashing on the ground when you are small isn't really that bad because you're already close to the ground and you don't have enough mass/muscle to go very fast so you're not going to lose a lot of skin.  You can get back up from a wipeout.

When you get bigger/older, the consequences of crashing are much greater.  You're higher off the ground, able to move much faster, and have more mass (e.g. more capital, more income, more liabilities).  More damage done and much harder to recover.  Not so easy to get back up from a wipeout.  Remember, when you are older - at some point, you will no longer be capable of working for money so you have to save up.  Having a wipeout late in your life usually means that you spend your retirement years living miserably.  Can't afford any pleasures in life and can't work for them either.

Get up, dust yourself off and get back on the bike.  There are a lot of advantages that come with knowing how to ride a bike.  It's definitely faster than walking.  Just know that if you try to strap on rocket engines to go faster, your risk of crashing is greatly increased.  

For every trade that you put on, you need to know the maximum you can gain and the maximum you can lose.  You should also know the probability of winning vs. losing.  If you're not okay with the loss, don't make the trade.

Yolo into PLTR 1/22 30c. It's $100 cheaper per contract and there's a high chance it'll be trading WAYYY higher than $30 given all of the industries they're involved in.

Although I would wait for it to dip to around $13 before considering this.

I love selling puts, but selling 2023 is basically pawning your cash collateral for two years for a small two year loan. Like if you have any debt, you have to subtract the interest you're paying on the highest interest debt you're currently holding to truly calculate the profit you'd get from them.

Yep. MAGA is basically the Republican answer for Dems and BLM and all the LGBT nonsense. Fringe people who didn't vote in the past, but now with thin margins it makes sense to get them out to vote.

They've done many schemes like this in the past, the results are always mediocre at best. Namely because the express purpose is to flush out competition, and the members compete with each other for dominance. In the US when companies do this they get fined for anti-trust violations, but since China is communist it's ok as long as the men doing it have party connections.

Also, you assume this will make all the speculators start buying any Chinese company for being Chinese. That's wrong, as there's no telling when or how the market will react to this.

How does your strategy of using a relatively low-delta call to write near-dated calls against compare to using DITM calls of similar expiration, to do the same thing?

Your calls currently have a delta of .36 while DITM calls would be over .8.

NIO $60 Call 11/20
been in on this since day 1. currently holding 300 shares. made money both selling puts and covered calls.

the stock price moves around seemingly at random because the float is so low and the spreads are shit. prone to bouncing whole percentage points in a single order. seems more or less range-bound between $30-40 at the moment. it did pump for a bit when the CEO was on one of the talking head channels a few weeks ago but returned to its normal levels within a couple days.

i'm not anticipating significant movement until Q3/Q4 late next year, when they're expected to report their first full batch of data, but it is possible that preliminary results presented at a conference moves the needle some. their earnings call (somewhat surprisingly to me) didn't move the price much at all but showed that they have enough cash on hand to take them to 2023 and that the pandemic hasn't fully derailed their ongoing work, though it did delay it a bit.

Because he's realizing he has a mindless group of followers and he ain't done with politics. People are celebrating like they got rid of Trump and racism and misinformation; this shit is only beginning.
 He'll try to make it politically untenable for the Biden administration to change course as China acts aggressively from India to Hong Kong to Taiwan, and the pandemic triggers a second global wave of shutdowns.

* Watch for National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe to publicly describe in granular detail intelligence about China's nefarious actions inside the U.S.

**Details:** Trump officials plan to sanction or restrict trade with more Chinese companies, government¬†entities and officials for alleged complicity in human rights violations in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, or threatening U.S. national security.

* The administration also will crack down on China for its labor practices beyond Xinjiang forced labor camps.

 **National Security Council spokesperson John Ullyot told Axios,** "Unless Beijing reverses course and becomes a responsible player on the global stage, future U.S. presidents will find¬†it politically suicidal to reverse President Trump‚Äôs historic actions."

this really hits home for me, I suffered with addiction 2005 - 2014.  I had 5 years sober going into covid 19.  March 17th when I was laid off I had \~$70k between 401k, checking/savings, brokerage account.

March 17th was the same day I called my dealer again and I've been high on meth and heroin since then.

Going into covid 19 I had 3500 shares of NIO at 2.16 cost and 401k with $45000 in cash.  I didn't think it was a good time to invest the last few years and I was willing to wait for the right opportunity.

Here is was, I bought another 8000 shares NIO at 2.96 and 600 shares of RCL at 23.  And told myself I would just wait.

Well the thing about meth, you can't fucking be content sitting still or waiting.

I've lost nearly everything + money borrowed, unemployment, credit cards, etc.  Year to date losses are to the sum of $160k

Some caveats to Chinese markets:

1. Cost cutting is king. Their cars are as cheap and expendable as everything else.

2. Most people can't afford cars, and you have to apply for a permit to buy one.

3. Success is just as often dictated by party connections as profitability.

4. Their stock market is full of autists like us, making them extremely volatile.

5. While a number of Chinese companies have soared, crushing competition in a few short years, on an aggregate level China's company's growth is mediocre. Most of China's market cap growth is from thousands of microcap and small cap penny stocks entering the market rather than Alibaba's and NIO's house of cards growth.
Never forget that Covid is and has been great for the market, even if it's terrible for the actual economy.
Trump will probably hit China with more tariffs but they can easily be canceled on January 20th.

The market has decided they aren't going to believe any turnaround before the cash flow hits the books. So calls before Q3 or even Q4 earnings will probably eat shit.

The good news is the online order flow is insane, games and consoles are selling out the moment they come in stock, and Jim Bell thinks cashflow is sufficient to start paying down debt early.

Still long, but shares or longer dated calls will perform better.

Well it is a question of what you're trying to buy and what price. I mean if you just want exposure at any price with a specific leverage you can calculate that and just enter that as your limit price and be done with it for your target date. If you want entry you'll pay the spread but it looks like the Nov 20 is only a spread of 2 points so it's not wide on the 44. I don't know what your plot is though in the long-run and the answer changes based on that.

I would disagree with your suggestions. 

The 4/12 date (or days around it) seems like a reasonable guess, so we'll work with that.

Assuming you have some cash on the side and own TSLA shares (or calls for after 4/12) I think the best play is to buy puts at the time to protect your downside if it doesn't get included. Then if it plummets you buy the dip and ride the bounce for some profit. Should it get included it will rocket so you will lose out on the put but the shares and calls you got should greatly outweigh that loss - obviously you gotta close losing positions at the first second the market opens to limit losses.

If you don't own anything I'd just buy some calls around 4/12 with a 2-3w expiry. Again buy shares if it dips.

How does that sound?
Another week... another...
Just based on the likely market for Berotralstat based on HAE and ignoring potential COVID applications, a lot of folks seem to have it at or more than $8. Positive Galidesivir news could boost that and negative news could drop it.

I think it goes up to $6 leading up to Bert. approval December 3 and then either climbs closer to 8 or falls a bit based on the whims of MMs. That's I bought calls that were ATM when I went in.  Will be holding on to my 3/2021 calls into next year hoping for more positive catalysts unless this thing moons after Bert. approval. Think my approach is pretty conservative and that I'll quite possibly regret not having a more aggressive position, especially with this recent news, but am waiting to see if the market reacts to it at all next week.

As I said before "There's more reasons to stay at war rather then just benefiting the military industrial complex".

Oh, just an FYI, I'm not saying it's right. Just trying to explain the situation. This is the new world order that America has created (NO, I'm not talking about NWO conspiracy theory). But if it makes you feel any better, the order is changing.
What is happening in 42mins?
True. But for every one they get right over there, they get 9 others wrong. There‚Äôs so many pumpers on there that write really nice write ups on so many companies with fancy research, stats, graphs, etc., that it‚Äôs hard to determine which ones are legit and have a real shot at blowing up and which are scam companies. 

That being said, when I originally read about NIO I highly considered investing in it and did my own research and just decided against it for certain reasons, and that belief that it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù

No, earnings will be fine because they are calculated on its actual sales forecast, not its share price.

The ER will likely be fine and beat expectations. What you need to worry yourself is:

1. Iv crush(short term) 
2. Heavy shorting by funds(short/mid-term) 
3. Any negative announcement by the Chinese gov(long term)

Otherwise the Chinese evs are sheltered from the fuck up going on in usa because, well, the Chinese Market is just fine and ain't locking down.

Sounds legit and plausible. They also took the UK NHS contract and created Palantir-Foundry for developing their Covid tracking/hospital data for a very small fee, a suspiciously small fee. There had to be another reason for why they wanted access to all of that data.

Go itm with a strike ending in 0 or 5. 

If the stock is 50 and you think it's going up. Buy like a 50 strike. Dont buy 52.5 or some weird price like that


Also do a limit order. If you dont enter a limit price you will buy the ask and immediately lose moey

With all the Chinese EV hype...what about BYDDF?
That's my point. If all stocks rose significantly including the indices the alpha of any given stock is not necessarily well understood. For instance Tesla went up immensely but at the same time so did SPY and all of tech so is the alpha in Tesla, the tech sector, or is it just systematic?

Thats true for all ADRs. The  idea is that you can participate in an over seas stock where you otherwise wouldnt be able to.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adr.asp

ADRs offer U.S. investors a way to purchase stock in overseas companies that would not be available otherwise. Foreign firms also benefit, as ADRs enable them to attract American investors and capital without the hassle and expense of listing on U.S. stock exchanges.

I agree China probably doesn‚Äôt care about NIO the company, but my real point is this graph is pretty 1 dimensional and doesn‚Äôt apply to anything until it does. Make sense?
[deleted]
I picked up a ton of 11/20 debits for cheeeeap Friday and have 12/18 calls that held up pretty well since they have time still but unless they explode through earnings and hold up Wednesday they‚Äôd get destroyed so I‚Äôm selling everything before earnings. I might pick up credit spreads but it‚Äôs risky as fuck. So I‚Äôm leaning towards picking up 25% puts eod Tuesday and just holding 75% cash into Wednesday to add to that position and/or start a different one. It‚Äôs gonna be a shit show after Tuesday so I‚Äôm gonna have to see that before confidently putting too much money into it.
There are other variables. Such as infrastructure, availability of recharging at home, etc.

Also, I don't have to be a consumer to play it. I don't eat BYND or go to GME but I can still make money off of it.

I doubt any of them ever heard of Citron either.
It was never $100. They did a reverse split, I think 1:20 when they became a penny stock the first time. They likely do it again.
this is incorrect
I think those could easily print. shit's up 100%+ in the last month and everyone is calling it the "chinese tesla". reminds me of the $IQ spike in 2018. All the hype was in FAANG and people were raving "chinese netflix! chinese netflix!" and pumping the shit out of IQ. It went up 100%+ in a month and then down like a rock for the next 6 months to ATL.

If NIO has another big pump this week I promise I‚Äôm only trading SPY from now on.
I think there is huge confirmation bias with these NIO call holders. Not saying it cant moon but this is what happens when you know you entered the game late and are afraid like hell that you might lose big.
And thats how pump and dumps work
It‚Äôs a wrap!
Yes. China doesn't give a shit about any individual company. And Elon made Tesla what it is. Without any backing from the U.S.
I jumped all over the place a lot if it was weekly spy plays that really boned me. Also Tesla calls killed me

im not playing NIO
I think NIO = Chinese Tesla in terms of brand (high end, aspirational). But not everyone will buy a NIO. Maybe mid-tier buyers will choose Xpeng, and budget conscious will buy Li. Then there's Niu with EV scooters - the #1 choice for getting around in population-dense Asia.
I always have a hard time processing this news because my large tech positions are NVDA, AMD, and U. And I was in on U on day 1 so I'm way up, still growing but takes hits like the sector as a whole. 

I want to be long NVDA but not sure I want to wait a year for it to hit 600+

Good news is there won't be many people left to take the vaccine so that makes distribution super easy

Nio is not the Chinese version of Tesla.  Xpeng is.  Nio is not vertically integrated like Tesla.  Nio don't even make their own cars and rather use subcontract company.  And Nio is wasting time with stupid battery swapping and don't have Supercharger network.


Xpeng has brand new factory, Supercharger network, and has cheaper cars that can compete with Tesla.  Xpeng is also backed by the Chinese government.
or it's a staircase
i thought they were awesome but then i tried to do a spread and they don‚Äôt support it. Like wtf? That can‚Äôt be a risk management thing cause you can short stocks.

Why you spamming with link ?
I see 4 players in EV that actually have working shit. Li Auto, Tesla, NIO, and Xpeng. Tesla is set, they got Elon Musk, but I think the brand superiority of NIO will win at the end of the day in the chinese markets because they are following the Apple way of customer service ahead of everything else. The other companies can do it but they are probably behind NIO and Tesla.

Fauci said next week but probably a couple weeks away.
By that logic you‚Äôre saying China the authoritarian government can‚Äôt keep this train going for NIO but Elon Musk the individual is what keeps his going? Is that correct?

Because unlike most people here, I don‚Äôt expect a 10,000% gain. I have a set % gain of profit that I take before it has a chance to tank. And yeah, I should‚Äôve held out a lot longer, I agree, but when I make 20-30% profit I pull.
Think of it as investing in your education. You made mistakes and got owned. Happens to everyone, you just did a really bad job with your investments. Knowing that, make changes and do better next time. Diversify, pick longer windows, etc. That said most of this sub are idiots, so you probably are too and won't learn a thing.
70% gainz is barely a profit??

Don't forget the credit market seized to the point where only the very most liquid securities still had a market. It was kind of a chicken and egg thing, but the credit side probably won't happen again with everyone's eyes on it.
Now only 1,591,982 dicks to suck
20 maybe this week.
We gone be riding SOLO and throwing out tendies tomorrow boys!

Now that all my puts have expired this will be the week SPY goes -10%. I guarantee it.
i just wanna break even on my SOLO calls
Only thing certain. Wsb getting halved every 1 month

Pandemic going parabolic, Trump starting a coup...

So markets definitely going up tomorrow.
Bitch I have my whole net worth in Options
You titled it like RH is the problem here
VIX to 45 by 6:01
I doubt it‚Äôll die, but I don‚Äôt know much either. It usually pops, goes back down right after, then trades sideways until the cycle repeats from what I‚Äôve seen the past 6 months
It is, I bought these last week I had $30 calls

We have about 40 million people who are 65 or older. As long as those can get vaccinated in the next couple months, the rest of the population can hang on and death rates would come down significantly.

>People also saw how stocks performed really well and they won't want to sell as quickly.

Due to unprecedented fed printing and government spending

Where the hell did this idea come from that recessions are good for stocks? It's literally just the fed pumping in money at batshit insane levels to keep it propped up.

Reality is, Q3 earnings were terrible and do not even remotely justify these stock prices.

What should be scaring people is what happens when the printing stops?
Mods
Stay strong. In my opinion there's going to be a dip or two among this week's gains, just can't tell if friday's closing price is going to be the lowest it'll go
There's 12k people on wsb right now.  5 mins a bj  (I believe in you) that's 1000 hrs or basically a fulltime job for 6 months. Also 2400 pints. Good luck!

Back then I had only been trading stonks for 4 months

Lost like 11 percent in a single day and lost about a fifth of my money in that one month.

Not much but it still hurt
u barely made a profit on that, why would u sell an ITM call that's got over a year left in an industry that's the future?
I know this exactly.

Hope you‚Äôre waiting to buy those puts, or set aside a bunch of bp to avg into them tomorrow and Tuesday. And maybe even Wednesday.

Fuck all you motherfucking retards. Been bagholding Palantir since list date and you fuckers told me I was a retard for holding, when really I wan an autist. This POS company is gonna feed data to daddy gov for the next 20 years and there‚Äôs nothing anyone of you mentally handicapped Wendy‚Äôs employees can fucking do ‚Äòbout it. In 2012-2014 this company was literally hotter than FB, making bigger moves, better contracts with CIA than amazon, eating up better engineers than Apple. If you‚Äôre tired of sucking on dick to fund your weekly calls, then try going all in on Palantir and sucking on these Fat Tendies, you helmet wearing, juice box drinking cum sock.

Rationally, lockdown fears should win out. There simply isn‚Äôt enough vaccine doses to go around even if they‚Äôre cleared. And I say this as someone who has SPX calls going into this week.
Fuck
When do futures open? And when does Hong Kong open?
You could wait for a consolidation. It hasn‚Äôt broken and held $16 yet, so it might be choppy for a bit
Going for another 100 shares on Monday then
Because why not, that‚Äôs why

My ARKK hasn‚Äôt moved much in the past couple of weeks. Cathie Woods better moon me

I had 5k at the end of Feb. Up 91k on this day from SPY puts. If I wasn't a retard, I would've did some leaps like some suggested but instead bled out most of it because "SeCoNd LeG dOwN cOmInG sOoN". 

The only leg that went down was my third leg. Fuck.

Exactly, if people actually are comparing this to the March crash then they're literally retarded
its gonna go up, down, or sideways
Nio 48-50 at open is my bet
Mods
maybe that'll change soon
It‚Äôs the same people reassuring each other. Anyone who‚Äôs survived at least one WSB meme knows how this ends.

i mean tech just faced their own version on monday...
About 35 and damp by me today, winds 30 mph steady, gusting higher.  All three joints in my lil downtown had their tents packed at noon.
PSA: if PLTR reaches $100 within 365 days from today, I will personally suck each and everyone‚Äôs dick *TO COMPLETION* here on WSB
This is true but its been doing this real slow for quite some time now.
And.......back then, Bernie was the leading Dem candidate.
Tesla is around a 7 PE based on 2022 numbers. I‚Äôm not a financial analyst but I read that for super growth companies they used a 2 year model? NIO was around an 8 and XPEV/LI was around a 6. But IMO PE doesn‚Äôt mean shit for these companies rn. So why the fuck are we even talking about this?

What stocks did you look on!?
solo cars; where you are the crumple zone
futures predictions:

&#x200B;

Small caps moon

&#x200B;

Tech, down
It obviously fell, right?

WSB putting the downs in lockdowns since 3/17
I thought GM Bolts was bad enough
Shoot, totally responded to the wrong person. No, totally agree with what you said.
And volatility will be shooting up into 11/30 earnings.
-95% 1 tax credit plz mr govment
how you think im gonna pay for that? NIO to the moon for my own sake
The real question is, which were the green squares?
The echo chamber here for NIO is getting to unsafe levels, was thinking about trying to get back in at a decent entry point but not after reading this thread for 5 mins. 

Had a NIO 1/21/22 $20c bought in Aug for $880, sold for $1345 when it hit my typical % pull out.
I‚Äôm seeing that RSI was around 85 at the high in early September as opposed to 64 on last Monday. You definitely could be right, though. I haven‚Äôt take a major short position
The market could go either way and it'd make sense
No worries OP is incel
That‚Äôs smart if spy makes a big move up you make out good cause it‚Äôs only 2 dollars a contract
Next big play is IPOB. Entered at 15.50 with a few thousand shares and lots of warrants and calls. Really hoping for big things with this one
What else is new? Lol
Id wait. RKT is showing bullish signals expect a 8% run this week
Lol pretty sure if you bought SOLO car, you wife is going to divorce you the second she saw you
You‚Äôre fucking retarded. Enjoy losing out on this one as well. Get rekt. Enjoy wendey‚Äôs.
dude u always call for 15% down lmfao
Absolutely beautiful.
Just fucking crash so the bulls can make a killing all over again and the now-wiser bears can too and then the bulls can still always say *Yeah well I did it twice bitch* in typical bull fashion
!RemindMe 2 weeks
I mever played that one, but i love those bridge xonstructor games then a truck drives over it and crashes your shotty bridge to the ravine below
Aes is also a multinational power generation company but it was like under $10 just a few months ago. This is a legit company but its hella expensive as is
Yeah you bet....üí©
5% is rookie numbers
19, never selling im not gonna have to be worried for a while I think.
Dont care if it drops to 25 even
The number on top of the line is a lot bigger than the number below the line.

You did this strictly stocks and no options? What did you buy that would be long term and still return 700%?
Oh shit, you‚Äôre the real deal. Followed.
scared money dont make money. big nutz play here
Gonna dump all of my RKT shares at a 5% loss and put it all in PLTR. Can I make a comeback?
This
The actual number will be much higher than 38%. This is just the ones willing to admit it.
It's not too late. Especially for Li this upcoming month
Sorry for your loss bro
It can move quite a bit - when vaccine news came out it went up 16% that day. Daily movement of ~5% in either direction isn‚Äôt too uncommon
I see. Never mind then I was thinking in terms of 2-4 week expirations. That's intense! I like the occasional Tuesday or Thursday 1DTE to play with a little while most of my stuff is in weekly short puts. I don't yet have the stomach to have $4-500 just evaporate in a few minutes.
What was it like getting pussy in the 80s?  Was it mostly bush or shaved?
Priced in
Feel like PTON will hit $110 again by the end of the upcoming week. Still a strong brand and gyms won‚Äôt open up any time soon with lockdowns and restrictions looming.
March 17th was the first city lockdowns leading into March 19th the first state-wide lockdown, which was Cali

SPY on March 19 was at 240

Any bears want to volunteer to tell the class what happened to the market the following months?
Optimism always win
$370
Zoom calls BA puts this is the way
Can you explain that slower
Still have to pay for flights, but you get a $4000 voucher.
I‚Äôll be cashing out my pton and baba calls and switching nio puts to calls
Nice V shape recovery
AAPL has 200 Billion cash on hand.  They could enter any industry with that and do really well.
Sugar mama when?
Looks like we going to lockdown again!! Lets go sell sell sell
Sleeping on the Dolphins
NIO is taking the whole EV market to the moon
Just amazing, this seems like the least likely option for absurd growth.
You're selling Nio puts? What strike?
It‚Äôs steady here now but when we pump Monday and Tuesday for earnings it‚Äôll be overextended like Friday morning and drop again. Some of the big money that doubled down Friday will take profit, bears will come back in and then paper hands will panic sell. So smart retail will take profit knowing this is bound to happen and also help with the price coming back down, and then we‚Äôll get back in at a lower price again. The lower it goes the better for bulls. Especially with nio day coming up in Jan. We have 3 big catalysts in the next 3 months. I‚Äôm trading nio through February üòÇ
these treads getting bigger than nfl ones
Bro you just hit me with an ad? FUCK YOU

Where TL;DR
Won‚Äôt that pump BABA too? If anyone can expand outside, its BABA
LI calls too then, yah?
Flair checks out
what the fuck is covid 19
yeah if it goes down it goes fast but we filled last sunday‚Äôs gap and bounced, tested 3550 many times and it‚Äôs been acting as support now. youll always see RSI divergence after a gap up and consolidation, what matters is we made a new high on higher daily RSI from early sept to last monday.
if you look below; thats exactly what im doing. I feel like theres a lot of possibility for some negative headwinds related to the 3rd wave to destroy the euphoria of the last 2 weeks, but long term, theres SO SO SO much positive vaccine news and herd immunity news to come in the next 6-12 months.
They don‚Äôt. Too personal but he‚Äôs a repeat John so she makes exceptions 500 is 500 is 500
NIO holders - what do you think - LI and XPEV moves with NIO into earnings? or does it now take a break and go in the opposite direction
My favorite quote is:

An nfl game is 22 well excercised men watched by 70000 people who never go to the gym.

Let's see which one wins this week.

Don‚Äôt tell them
I always liked hanging out at bars of nice restaurants. I like being around older people I guess. Young people are such cunts. Not you guys you degenerates are cool
Did the announcement today ever happen?
Most people on this sub do not even have 25k capital
We open green, remember back in march people were screaming about a second wave.

Well looks like the second wave is here, and it may be priced in since we all have been talking about it for 6 months.
Citron put their ‚Äúresearch‚Äù out THIS close to earnings for a reason.

This is the last chance they could reasonably convince enough traders to panic sell.

Also the last chance for long term stock holders.
ZM mooning this week! If it goes to $500 by Friday, I'm buying a Porsche and posting pics/gains

Always. With a combination of shares in undervalued companies that have the potential to rise in the short-mid term. All about risk tolerance and position sizing for me at this point

-Bears call it rigged and say that futures don't mean shit.

-Futures go even greener. 

-Bears get quiet.

Good time to buy some cheap calls for Moderna news
I agree it‚Äôs exhausting and I put way more effort into than my full-time job (usually up till 4am doing research) and I get fucking burnt staring at charts all day. I take a lot of ‚Äúsick‚Äù days off work to trade too. Are you full-time trading?

Would hurt the shit posting
Aint going to try to time it with puts.

But ill be DCAing into LEAPS on my favorite value stocks, because after the next season of "stocks pull back on covid fears", we'll have a slam blast of "Pfizer vaccine given emergency use authorization"->"first 50 million people vaccinated"->"covid cases declining, show evidence of herd immunity"->"increase in airtravel, states relax mask mandates due to herd immunity"->"we're seeing recovery faster than normal"  all big headlines in 2021 that are going to make the pfizer vaccine pump last monday look like kiddie stuff.
I‚Äôll give it a try thanks
Mine would go off the screen

The problem with this sub and why there is such epic loss porn is that they treat risk management as being a pussy. You can make some badass trades but all that can be lost WAY EASIER. You should know if you got this sub. Easier to have a GUH moment than a big short moment.

‚ÄúI am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing. The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN‚Äôs leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,‚Äù

Apart from the 10 ASEAN members, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc. RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.

Holy motherfucker. shorts who think NIO/XPEV/LI are worth less than $60 billion are insane.
Stop. I can‚Äôt only get so erect.

Yeah it's pretty difficult to break the habit of taking the profits in front of you while letting your losers "develop" into winners. I think we're trained to have that mindset from other facets of life.

This is youre one free win bro, stop doubting yourself. Everytime you believe you will do bad it bring negative energy into your life, stop bringing yourself down, if you‚Äôre that shitty at trading you need to pick up a different hobby
I am glad we understand each other .   If your trying to make back your losses I would recommend buying stock or call option on NIO or SPCE.  

SPCE you can probably make some easy money as they have a very important test flight in a few week for FAA certification.
Only thing that matters is MRNA phase 3 results. Over 95% efficacy and we moon.

Hey, insurance guy here. Make sure to check if unum exercised its reinsurance policies. Travelers did it to show a massive cash balance to make their balance sheet look good. Any more problems for a sustained amount of time could be trouble. That being said travelers is mostly property and casualty and the dynamic on unum must be a lot different. Just something you might want to check out on their q3 report though.

Slightly otm, take your profits, and start a new position on a dip day. Also you can set some profits aside, don't have to bet it all, each time. Id reccomend a stop loss when you got profits, I made that mistake too many times.
Not enough to quit and actually trade reliably. I‚Äôm gonna break it down for you chief. Your best option for trading full time is selling options. You most likely aren‚Äôt going to make it buying options and swing trading the TQQQ. Maybe you‚Äôre part of the 10% who will make it, but I‚Äôm going based on pure stats right now. Save up 400k and then you can quit your job and sell options, until then, it‚Äôs unlikely.

OR

Take out a loan for 100k, match your 200k with margin, 400k. Now you‚Äôre ready to ride. Uber or something to make enough money to pay off interest and margin calls. Welcome to the good life

Who trades between the hours of 11-3? I mean what are the types of traders who are moving the market after the first hour and before the last hour? I figure the index managers would reshuffle during set times and hedge funds aren't actively daytrading all the time except for maybe a touch of delta-hedging. I guess retail trades wherever they can sneak in s bathroom break and the algos never sleep. So who's making up the majority of the volume? If it really is the MM's and and the algo's eternally trying to pinch pennies off each other, creating the volume, that's too ridiculous to be true, so who's really producing the lunchtime volume?
Never left
There‚Äôs no way you achieve 40-50% a year to sustain a modest lifestyle. If you could, you‚Äôd be Warren buffet by 40. Nobody can achieve those gains consistently year in, year out. Unless you‚Äôre Warren buffet, or a handful of other traders who reached billionaire status. 

Now then - if you had $1 million - then making 5% a year is 10x easier.

Addressed in the DD - analysts have been concerned about the closed LTC block. They increased reserves by $593m in 2018 (hence the reduction in earnings that year) and they entered the agreement with Maine state regulators earlier this year to further increase reserves over a 7 year period.

Stonks only go up
Just simple pricing model. I will share it if I can find it on my work laptop ( yeah, did it on office laptop, on working hours, lol). But here's a basic idea I used: SPY was at around $230 (bottom was roughly $220), and Fiscal Policies were just getting started. Saw that monetary policies weren't going to cut. I made scenarios on, 1T, 2T,... Upto 10T stimulus directly going to SPY companies (and nothing to small businesses). SPY is roughly $300B Stonk (if you want to call it that). 

Top 5 companies on SPY makes up about 20% of the index. It's a Marker Cap weighted index. If free Pow money was to go to these 5 companies, how much would it pull for  he index up? It was an easy algebra. Plus, those 5were Covid Stonks anyways, so after stimulus, they had to hardly catch up (less than 20% from top to catch up). So, I estimated SPY to reach $340 (precovid ATH) by middle of September. But, to give myself a huge safety net, I yoloed into December 2022 leaps on SPY with a Price Target of $430 by then. Daily and monthly returns on SPY didn't make sense without stimulus on any of my simulation. But with stimulus packages, they were within reach.

But, I'd say, timing was a pure luck. And I claim no expertise(probably no one can) in timing.
But then I would lose other friends in the process. Also every friend has value for instance this guy is a great cook. He has no problem cooking for us every time, especially when we get a beach house every summer.

Yeah but Portland is worse
Might finally be time for CSIQ to moon, though I feel this is really high risk. The stock has been trading a lot more like a value stock than the rest of the sector in terms of PE and PS. Market cap is a pitiful 2.3 billion.

Main problems imo have been that revenue growth has been shit and a lot of operations are heavily based in China. CSIQ has been raising money and planning to spin off part of operations to IPO in the Chinese market, which would help them attain a better valuation. Improving sentiment toward China should be helpful as well.

The missing piece is the revenue though. They have had modest revenue surprises of about 5% in the last 2 ERs, which has not been enough. If we see a significant revenue beat this shit could seriously start running up to $60. Was tempted to YOLO, but I feel it's too risky.

Pos: 11/27 calls @ 40

ER is before open on 11/19. I went to 11/27 because if things line up this could very well see multiple green days.
That doesn't sound quite right.
I'm going to sit back and be trigger shy. I expect the market to pull back tomorrow due to the growing number of covid cases and some states entering into another round of lockdowns. Not to mention the continuous turmoil of the election.

NAH

We in the bear trap area.
Thanks for the advice. I will more than likely start with 1/1 just to get an idea of how it plays out live. My risk tolerance is high key low and I‚Äôve been doing really well with taking profits (was in on nio this month multiple times and recovered a huge chunk of my all time loses by taking profits daily instead of holding). No one suggested the strangle to me particularly I just was running different scenarios on spy in the calculator and was shocked to see there‚Äôs a way to win if the price moves up or down even by 1%.
Don't do it bro.
Smart
I mean, the drawback is missing gap ups/downs in your favor. However, for me, I still can‚Äôt break the cycle of holding losers too long and cutting winners too soon because I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want to lose more.‚Äù So, cash gang, and day trading momentum work for right now even if I‚Äôm capping potential gains and do set myself back about one day each week. Overall the profits have more than made up for the small loss that one time a week. 

I also sleep a lot better and feel the need to drink/smoke to relax 100x less. Which to me, is worth way more than the potential profits missed.

To each their own though!
Oh yeah, on page 121 it says they work with the largest american auto manufacturer. I'm thinking the elongated muskrat.

My account is horrible right now. But with thst said, 2 weeks to a month options is the move.

Still have to play it right obviously, but have more room for error and still nice gainz

People buying Tesla‚Äôs are in the top 1% of the 1% in the UK. The government incentives and the complete lack of infrastructure is a massive barrier for most
Guys please stop listening to gay ass bears. You don‚Äôt listen to them on this sub, so why would you on Wall Street. Understand this, Nio is the Chinese version of Tesla, do you really think a company backed by CHINA will ever fail? No they need this thing to be competitive to Tesla. Look, I‚Äôm not gonna sit here like a smart ass and pretend like I know what I‚Äôm talking, but I do know one thing. Even if Nio flops this earnings report it will recover in a week or so because China is pushing for green pure natural energy. So, buy stocks, leaps, calls (and puts if you want to lose money) far out on NIO. You missed Tesla,  so why the fuck would you miss your second chance.

I‚Äôd try one contract at first (you have three days a week to do this anyway) and see how it plays out for you. You can always go ham the next time and you‚Äôre lowering your risk. 

I honestly only do the strangle at the beginning of the day, then drop the losing leg pretty quickly. Then I‚Äôll take profit, maybe leave one contract going and just work on shorting from each of the peaks during the day. Taking profit and getting out in time/not getting greedy is the hardest.

1-3 dte works better in the sense that theta doesn‚Äôt fuck you as quickly and you‚Äôre not strictly relying on gamma at that point. However, those contracts are more expensive and I have a rather small account, so I do prefer 0dte on particularly volatile days.

Flat days though, you‚Äôll get murdered. So, my ‚ÄúI started in March and am still an idiot‚Äù advice is to just take it slowly and see how it plays out before you dump your entire account into something some stranger suggested.

This might be a little üåà but hope in some way it brings some brightness into your day OP. Once I heard that pain and losses are like carvings on a tree, the carving will always remain the same but the tree will keep growing and being more things, more branches. Much like our losses, the pain will never be any less part of who we are, it‚Äôll just become smaller part of who we are. You‚Äôll keep growing and being more things! We love you too, you absolute beautiful retard. Now positions or ban you üåàüêª.
Basically a lot less yolo‚Äôs. Keep about half the money in cash. When I make plays I buy them 4-5 months out and when I see about a 40% gain I sell. Used to do 1 week to a month and try to go for 200-300% increases. Just take the small wins. That‚Äôs what I did with NIO, LI, and XPEV and missed the dump last week, cause I took the money I already made. If I want to play a quick 3 day SPY call or put I only do 2-3k and sell the next day no matter what, even if I‚Äôm down 50%. Basically, don‚Äôt get greedy. Getting a 40% gain in a day is honestly huge, WSB just desensitizes you to that and makes you feel like a bitch if you sell at only 40%. Compare that to normal stocks that get around 7% a year. You made in a day what people make in over 4 years. Take the small wins.
You had to find the ones that hadn't crashed as much and basically assume that it's coming down like it's counterparts. I think my best ones were F, HPQ, LL and ELY. Basically ended bein up $500, even after losing a bunch in my stock values.

I wish I had known more about debit spreads back then, probably could have made more with less.

How easy/quick is it to exit this position if it starts trading sideways. I‚Äôd be willing to take a slight loss to see what happens but if I have to commit to the entire days activity I would be kinda salty. Is that the stip of 0dte tho? Waiting until eod for it to sell?

What's the best way to build up equity to eventually place a yolo bet? Buying a $500 option that expires in a year just to make 200% is fucking aids. And there's obviously no guarantee you're going to even make that much.

At the same time I obviously don't want to lose $500 a week on FDs either. Need to find a decent balance somewhere in between FDs and leaps.

Cause of money kiddo, you don‚Äôt seem to understand what I‚Äôm trying to present to you.. covid is something that spreads thru the air and anyone can get it...anyone, cigarettes deaths are something the user has to go out of their way to buy and use... not something that is being uncontrollably spread, if we as a world didn‚Äôt adopt these precautions deaths would be much higher 

I get were you are coming from but this isn‚Äôt the early 1900 when everyone and their kids were smoking cigarettes. With your logic the same can be said about alcohol but guess what? It‚Äôs the same logic; money there and people go out of there way to use that substance

That was my thought last weekend with the election uncertainty. Didnt expect the vaccine pump. If it goes up like it did monday morning, chalk the puts up for a loss but the calls will by far compensate. You can close out of the strangle as a whole or sell each side individually. Overall I had $2000 in calls and $2000 in puts and at market open the calls were worth like $16k and puts were like $100
Or ban
sorry for your loss,man. Hope you can recover from these speed bump in your life
Something to note about tmus (not sure how it plays out) but they seem to be offering their OTT service free for new people who come over and sub to their 4/$160 plan. I wonder how this will reflect in their earnings. You would think they could pull away some T and Vzn customers who are legacy by giving them a tv package for free. 

Nothing earth shattering but something to watch in future earnings calls to see if they have penetration.

Also their home internet when fully launched should probably cause some movement in T, comcrap, centurylink etc.
It means people are betting company will grow exponentially for years that means beating already high expectations every quarter

I'm not even that üåàüêª  on Nio and think it's more likely to trade flat in the nearish-term than go down to Citron's number. Definitely not buying puts on it. I just want to see one compelling argument for why they (or XPENG, or LI) are likely to capture a large enough share of China's EV market to justify their current valuation and don't think battery swap, comparisons to Tesla, or these misleading statements that they have the support of the CCP are it.

I know how you feel. My dog passed the day after Christmas 3 years ago due to old age. He was the first dog I ever had, I remember taking my parents to the shelter and I was able to pick him out. He was my best friend growing up all the way until I was 21. The one thing I regret the most, (even though it was out of my control) was that I was not able to spend the last 6 months of his life with him. I had just came home from marine corps bootcamp, and he passed 2 weeks later. I always think about it. I first received information about his sickness while in bootcamp through letters. And what hurt the most was that I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. It was devastating. I‚Äôm just happy that he is no longer ill or suffering. He brought me and my family true happiness.

Nope, unemployment is out of funds.
Sucks bro, I would put a yolo in his honor, if it makes some gains I‚Äôd donate some to a rescue shelter in his honor
Nah, man. I'm long some short dated call options in anticipation of continued upside momentum. I'm not arguing for or against a position in NKLA. The EV space is a total gamble at this point and the landscape will look very, very different in 3 years. I think the smart way to play EV is in the infrastructure. 

Who is building out the charging stations?
I‚Äôd lock in profits. Ran up so much this year, and IV crush gives you the chance you rebuy for cheap if they dip after earnings.
Tomorrow there will be a $10 stock with the ticker of SOLO
It doesn‚Äôt take an investment banker to understand that tesla was only going up back in august on battery and s&p hype, what i mean is every once in a while an opportunity like this arises that doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out
Puts on CHWY in honor of this guy's dog.  But seriously sorry for your loss.
Bringing parachutes just costs money that could be invested in more calls.

Different types of insurance. The lockdowns had a huge beneficial impact on health insurers (Anthem, UnitedHeathcare) and I suspect the lockdowns helped commercial insurers as well. Health insurers also got the benefit of the election results (any blue wave would have put them in jeopardy). COVID had more of a give and take impact on UNM‚Äôs lines (mentioned in the DD).

Management thought the stock was undervalued when it was at $38 when they initiated the huge buy back. I am assuming they will reinstate the buy back once the COVID lockdowns end and the vaccinations start

Bullish
ZM has big short potential if it gets pumped up this week. Just buy some puts a year out and forget about it
Is this a screenshot of what you typed up in Word? Lol
Zm is going to run up into earnings, when it will start is anyones guess. They are expected to beat bigly.  If anything it will dump hard in a couple weeks
Mcdonalds puts (corona)

Dude if I play $1800 on the scenario I plugged in I stand to make $1200 with just a 1% move in either direction. I was planning on playing with like 5k.
What's crazy is this guy probably has a MFA and/or MBA from a top university and makes 6 figures.... counting cars.
Tell me about SOLO going to $10 tomorrow
Approved!
thank you. $25k in assets or $25k liquid cash? if it's the latter, I can understand why people don't just want a large sum of money sitting there.

As for day trading when young, I wondered why more people don't just buy big name stocks and resell them for higher. For example, $AAPL when it's red and then sell it when it inevitably goes green right before announcements or earnings. Even if it doesn't, you can hold it for a while and it should go up after a few months to a year.
Lol bitch, talk that shit Tuesday
This is the way
Idk, they have 1.5b of stock to sell at $17 based on their news announcement. The only thing that will make it gap is bond rates being increased, at which point I will wait for it to drop again from some panic story about covid getting worse before buying in. Buying points/timing the market makes a huge difference in profit percentage.
It‚Äôs my birthday today and I need y‚Äôall show some love to me
A weird version of loss porn. But here, have my upvote. Cherish the moments you shared together. It gets easier but never goes away. And that's for the better.
$FSR 11/20 20C. You have been put on notice.
Pure luck. Did math on which leaps to buy with a simple spreadsheet model. But, timing was pure luck.
It's ok he's only got it in one nostril
I will be loading up on PLTR when it drops below $12 again and not a moment before.

What if you are wrong?
I dont think anyone has argued this lol, and if they have they get hazed into submission
See?  Covid already going for our tendies
Yes...I am hoping for a drop but then since everyone is‚ÄîI doubt it will come. Buy now before everything skyrockets.
I‚Äôm ready for the next crash they cause too

Can't go wrong with the long Johnson.
Trust funds usually have limitations for that reason. Sounds like the parents were the trustees and just controlled the kids' money.
It's all about appearances anyways. By the time a vaccine is widely available, we probably won't even need it anymore.
Cool, good luck. 

Good move but stop spamming dude. We get it.
Hey.
How is this literally not free money on days we can expect a lot of movement? Also, how do the gains on the calls cancel out the losses on the puts when the price goes up? Also, when I sell, do they all sell collectively or do I need to sell the calls/puts individually when I want to close?
I SMELL TENDIES
Sounds like a good job. Pays well? I might like counting cars.
Just my opinion but I think it‚Äôs priced as though it can and will be China‚Äôs equivalent of Tesla. The sheer amount of people in China means that the volume of EVs sold in Asia will skyrocket over the next decade. That‚Äôs why they all went up last week, not just NIO. US EV market share doesn‚Äôt matter here IMHO.

Ah puts, the implied money burners

I‚Äôm selling calls Tuesday on run up for a ton of money and then will decide the next move Wednesday after whatever happens on earnings. My shares I‚Äôm holding til something fundamentally negative happens to the company and will be adding aggressively if we dip into the 30-35 range post earnings-pre nio day

Just for some context on what we're going up against:

Guy working at a small investment bank shared his day to day. The bank pays for satellite images that update every few hours (versus days/months like the rest of us), and his entire job is to look at a series of factories around the world and track how busy their parking lots are. Allows the bank take long/short positions based on predicted output before earnings are reported.

Anyone who thinks they found a system, or a strategy, or a niche that investment banks are not aware of, you are absolutely wrong. The best we can hope to do is ride their wake.
Nio will moon here‚Äôs my dd:

I don‚Äôt see how zoom can go up any more. The majority of their users will go back to in person school within the next year. The biggest portion of zoom users are students and when any positive vaccine news comes out I think zoom will drill like how it did the last time good vaccine news came out.

Made it from 1400 to 42k during that on pure spy put plays. Pulled out a little but got burned by tsla during it's first ramp up. Then made 30k on tsla calls a month later and lost it cause of course, I'm gambling not investing, fuck that. Then I made all my gains back again on Tesla and nvda, and lost it all again. Still up like 5k for year. Been a wild year. Prob should stop going all in 90% of the time trying to 3-4x 30k into 6 figures. But no real loss so no harm, no foul.
You've got people like Dalio and Cathie Wood buying heavily, and a likely earnings beat as well as extremely bright forecasting for 2021, and of course the CCP saying 20% EV by 2025. This could be Tesla 2.0.

I was talking to my buddy who works in PR for a large healthcare company. Said the vaccine won‚Äôt be widely available to Americans until the end of 2021. The rest of the world? Who knows, especially less developed nations maybe 2022.

They mostly sell basic life / supplemental life / short-term disability / long-term disability policies. These are pretty standard / bare bone level of coverage employers offer employees.

Separately they sell individual life insurance policies and those sales are declined during COVID. But their group business is strong - and I‚Äôm skeptical there would be any interest from the administration in reducing employee benefits. These are generally low cost perks the company can offer. 

Like all companies they will be impacted by any change to corporate rates (and potentially changes to share buybacks if that happens) but their core business will be unaffected

No; covid introduced zoom to the world. Remember in the Facebook movie when people started saying ‚ÄúFacebook me?‚Äù Zoom is now the ubiquitous term for video chatting. They have recently paired with upwork as a long term partner for what will be a great rehiring tool throughout the recovery.
‚ÄúPalantir even sued the US Army in 2016 to force it to consider using its intelligence software after the Army chose to go with its own. Palantir won the suit, and then it won an $800 million contract.‚Äù

You want to get in and out fast. They lose a lot of money especially if they‚Äôre OTM as the day goes on. One small move in the other direction can fuck your profits bigly. However, I‚Äôve made a shit ton playing them on momentum day trades following the spikes and dips. Also, I try to drop my losing leg right away too.

Ya the business prospects for zm are going to be great when the vast majority of its users won‚Äôt be using it in the very near future. It‚Äôs not worth it‚Äôs valuation and the only thing propping it up is there is no vaccine yet. So ya short term sure u might think it won‚Äôt drill because of lockdowns but just like last week any positive news for a vaccine and zoom will drill.

Dude you obviously bought PUT options on the company and are losing money bad.  

If you researched the company before you bought the puts you would know that.  But your laziness in that is just the same in your laziness in this post.  

Good luck cut your losses and buy call options on NIO.
NIO is old news. PLTR is new and hot.

It is structured in Tiers at IB. First $100k in margin is 1.59% per year. As you add more margin the higher tiers charge a lower interest rate.
Bro but im holding puts..
If you are planning to hold a stock long term, this is not a terrible thing, mind you it is 100% and should get you beat up on the play ground, plus you still collect the dividends
Is this a word document?

Yes, but they can find another contractor to do the work. They aren't tired PLTR. Plenty of other guys do what they do. 

Those guys are restricted likely to the non-defense related contracts like Airbus, legacy automotive, etc. Not their bread and butter.

I like Unum.  Have traded it a few times the past few months when it got down to the high 16's.  The last time I thought I might hold it but it moved from $16.70 to $19.50 in about 3 trading days so I took the profit.  

Options are monthly so you're not going to get a lot of love here.  But for folks that want to bank some of their tendies for long term while they continue to play the WSB casino, it's a good stock that should make a decent grind higher for those with patience. 

Good luck with your position.

The time I had my first ever panic attack and mental breakdown and lost nearly everything.  Thanks for the memories! üëç
Fair enough but I think there was a healthy skepticism even before corona. The fed cut rates in 2019, there was a run up in Dec- Jan and debt bubbles were setting up for a traditional crash. I figured it would happen around September-october 2020 because I figured by then sanders would be a clear favorite to win and the markets would panic. The march crash wasn't on anyone's radar and even then you had to be careful because buying the dip for those first two weeks was like trying to catch a falling knife.

Converting to a spread on an underlying you‚Äôre still bullish on is a fantastic way of minimizing losses while keeping skin in the game if the stock trades sideways for a little
Not a bad idea but I was deleveraging this week. Cases rising makes me want to have some leverage on the sidelines. If it falls back to the $12 dollar range, I may sell something to jump back in.
God I wish I could relive Feb. 20-28

I don't think it will crash as hard.  Coronavirus isn't as unknown anymore which removes some of the fear; and even if we do a shutdown, it looks like vaccines are less than six months out which is why those stocks that crashed the deepest have just recently been rallying on the vaccine news.

Oh yeah, the government owns it, but they almost never have the means to maintain it on their own. If they don't renew a contact, they'll typically have to find another company to take it over. It's not uncommon for companies to lose contracts.

It is structured in tiers at Interactive Brokers but it is really low (main reason I am with IB). On the first $100k the rate is 1.59% and it goes down from there as you go into higher tiers.

So the dividend on the margined shares more than covers the cost

State by state is really important, if say, California, New York, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Illinois shut down, that is 70 million people, and about 39% of the U.S. GDP on lockdown.
That would be a catastrophe for the market.

POOP
People always harp on and theorize analyst groups and banks downgrade stocks so they can get them for cheaper. On the surface it seems to make sense, are there any protections against this?  Like a 1 month moratorium on buying a stock ticker if you downgrade it?
IV Crush?
Lol nice spread of misinformation there. Read up the context of the situation and why it was being called racist (not that I agree that it was but it was fishy) At the time China had only 100 cases a day or so, they were past the point of fighting it and had it somewhat contained while Italy had 100k+ cases a day and was only placed on 'travel advisory' while China was outright banned even though they had less total and daily cases. See why it was bullshit? Plus he placed that ban way too late lmao, he just wanted to swing the government's big dick around and make himself feel important.
I sold puts around $41
If you want a toothless blowjob just put out a Craigslist ad ya damn freak
PLUM
First thought is: If stocks recovered quickly from March, why panic sell now? Answer: To keep your gains and buy back in at the bottom. 

People who follow specific stocks know their range of value. So it wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúpanic selling‚Äù but selling to ‚Äúbuy the dip, make a grip.‚Äù
Who is your broker? If it is an actual company and not Robbinghood, then just call to make a trade
Bonus: nyse put the ssr (short sale rule) on nio and xpev in after hours, have fun bag holding puts this week

Bad news = stonks go up ofc
Sorry for being retarded but if I'm confident a stock is going up in the relative short term (2-8 weeks), it's smarter to convert a naked call bought during weakness to a debit spread than it is to just open the vertical spread when buying the call?

If the stock runs up while holding the naked call and then I convert it to a spread, I'm essentially saving a bit extra on the short leg and then limiting my losses.
I think if BABA doesn‚Äôt rebound tomorrow but JD crushes earnings, BABA will sell off a bit more as investors continue rotating into JD and PDD

I mean I literally have an aerospace engineering degree that I never use. But if you went through first year engineering physics in college and passed there is no math you haven't already learned required to prove how far behind they are on strictly a kinetic energy (0.5*m*v^2) basis. Having a functional proprietary rocket engine IS something, but I can assume its design criteria is significantly less demanding than a rocket that needs to work for longer (I assume) than VG's rocket engine (70 seconds). Space Shuttle SRBs burnt for just over 2 minutes for reference.

Haha maybe but you have to be some ultimate retard to mess up that much. At some point just pay someone smarter than you to take care of the money.
What will happen:
At 24.50$ I will sell half my shares. Since I have been hurt so many times.
Price will skyrocket to 30+
Fearing to lose some other gains, I will not sell other shares.
Price will then pummel to 26ish for another 2-3 years.

This way I would have sold far from the high and I could not buy again without losing money

It is obviously a generalization, one can't make a blanketed statement in absolute. Of course there are brilliant engineers everywhere and plenty stupid ones too. I know some very smart engineers in defense and they are frustrated their projects don't go their way because they don't have the talent/skill, they want. 

PLTR suffers from the clearance requirement issues. It blocks foreigners, anyone who can't get a clearance, high debt holders, pot heads, anyone with a  criminal record, etc. 

PLTR still targets all the slow to adopt industries (defense/government/non ev-automotive, and aerospace).  I suspect this is because it is in their wheel house due to all the restricted coding and documentation from their defense/government origins. 

That is typical of all defense contractors these days. They offer a platform then support to continue to build off of it. If you actually know about these contracts, the government owns the platform and other companies can come in and work on it for them. They are not tied to the specific company. The government owns rights to said source code. This surprised me.

I understand what you are saying.  But I agree and disagree.  To a lot of people, it‚Äôs more than just some random Redditor.

Some of these posts move stock prices.  Yes you can look up largest pension fund investment on SEC.  But when a big name like Barron‚Äôs writes an article on it, it means more to people in my opinion.

I have some $400 mid december expiry SPY calls that I've been holding. Should've sold when there was a surge in September, but I held. I have a good feeling about there being another surge since election worries are out of the window. I think people with bands were holding, and now they have the market confidence so things will go back up. SPY $400 mid december is only $0.15 and I think it will get to around $0.45 at least.

Case numbers are growing because testing is growing. These are people testing without symptoms who want to jerk off at home for two weeks. 

Even though the cases are rising above the first wave the amount of hospitalizations and deaths are lower since hospitals are better equipped and have more knowledge on how to deal with it. 

There will be no national shutdowns on the scale of the initial crisis. State by state sure. Depends on how big a pussy your governor is. 

The markets will not react with the same level of panic even if there is a national shutdown.

Trump has clearly changed tact.  His senior aides must have convinced him he has lost and he accepted it.  Now he is going to focus on avenging the loss in 2024 by just pushing lawsuit and conspiracy talk far enough to not require him to produce real proof.  Time will conveniently run out before he can prove it openly.  Then he will spend 4 years about how he was cheated to try and win in 2024.  Nothing else will happen and the clock will run out on 2020.

Creepto seems to be positively correlated with stocks. 

Not a great weekend for fakebuxx digital currency. 

TLDR: Dog Dick Red Futures.
There is usually a drop first though. Tesla dropped almost 40% before returning to 20% below ATH. And tesla has the potential to dominate far more than nio. They have energy in all of its forms, the self driving and ride sharing markets amongst other things. 

Tesla also ran up much less than nio, and nio has had many massive stock offerings, idk how much the market cap has increased this year but its more than the 35x stock price.

Nio may not lose meme status till it goes flat, but if it starts the process now, its probably got a long ways yet to fall.

That said, idk if it will. I hope it resumes course but im far too scared to put serious money into this right now

Exactly, their inverse correlation with my portfolio last week reinforced that. Fuck china. Entered my first short position on a company, versus buying calls elsewhere, because of that. But this movement is too much. 

CCP self driving cars will never be allowed on US highways. It's priced as if they have a chunk of the US EV market share, and making tons of money.
Yeah they‚Äôre covered. I might consider writing CSP on a really red day

What are you arguing exactly? Even if the other party was happy to give you the money to hedge their position, that doesn't make it any less true that your gain was money they lost. 

In fact, here's a nice quote for you, jackass:  "Options and futures trading is the closest practical example to a zero-sum game scenario"
JD gonna kill it! Gyna trade deal today, crazy singles day numbers (stole about 8% of BABA market share on that...no those numbers aren't included in Q3) JD Health IPO coming soon. I'm guessing close to 120 by the end of the week after the upgrades and new price targets.

Biden won‚Äôt commit to national lockdown, Trump kinda conceded and so far no major state lockdowns some restrictions.
Yeah youre probably right
Just be careful. And do stocks that have weeklies, if you sell a CSP and the stocks tanks, you really can‚Äôt roll out that much for credit if it‚Äôs a monthly. Weeklies have more opportunity to roll as opposed to a monthly where ur collateral is tied up for a long time. Had a shit experience with HYLN.
That‚Äôs dumb because I have been subscribed to ArK trade notifications. They were buying lot of Doyu for past month, they saw it not moving up, from past few days they are keep selling it. They bought lot of Fastly when it dipped from 130 to 90, now it is around 75, it even dropped to 65$. I work in the same space as Fastly, I don‚Äôt think they are any special. Fastly initial sales increased because of Tik Tok. Fastly have many competitors such as Cloudfalre , Akamai, Imperva etc. Ark was dumb in buying the dip there. ARK also bought Alibaba when it dipped from 320 to 290 without actually understanding the political situation in China. Jack Ma is now an enemy to Winnie the Pooh, he will make sure Alibaba won‚Äôt get the recognition it deserves. The conclusion is don‚Äôt blindly trust anyone. Do your due deligence

Pre-COVID level SP was $30ish not $38! 
We understand that it fell from $30 due to COVID induced panic sell but why it kept falling from it's January 2018 price of $58 while other insurance stocks such as state farm, metlife, allstate, progressive, travelers, national general, Anthem, United Healthcare are doing so well?

Are we wearing blindfolds tonight, lads?
i have it too. you have to be prompted/invited to use it and allow the setting to be turned on. I agree though that it makes it worthless since you cant trade the last hour and fifteen min. It's been available for 2 weeks and since then all the swings and movements have been in the last hour so you essentially get fucked and if you're right, they'll force sell your position at 2:55pm when they do end of day sweeps on options "at risk"
Lockdowns to come, same thing happened in March. Our governor is too big of a pussy to do it all at once
Depends on the option, if it‚Äôs a weekly and you held over the weekend but the price stayed the same I‚Äôd say like 10-20%
I believe it will touch into the 20s if hype continues before crashing back to around $12-$14 when the lockup expires.
I have puts ready for Monday and Tuesday. See you then. LI and XPEV will follow.
How much margin u using?

I have to say i wasnt rly fucking w this play until i found this out
Should I hold my NIO shared this week or sell at a loss
Yeah they aren‚Äôt restricting movement but it‚Äôs pretty heavy restriction. Movie theaters, gyms, museums all closed completely. That‚Äôs as close of the original lockdowns that has been announced so far.

Guys, I‚Äòve been holding NET since april with a cost basis of 21.40, Cloudflare was very long lagging behind with a P/S of about 28-30 while its peers were at 45-50 (CRWD, ZS, DDOG, FSLY), now the table has turned and NET is valued the most expensive at 50 P/S while others are at 38-45 P/S level.

I don‚Äòt know what I should do, I‚Äòm a big believer in this company however I dont get why they are valued this rich. I‚Äòve planned to stay in for atleast 5 years, but don‚Äòt know if i should lower my stake as it grew this quick. Is there anyway to justify their enourmous valuation?

Dems prevented breaks to cruise industry last stim package. Repubs have aid on the agenda bc of their constituents and bc cruise industry got hit so hard. Good lobbyists get shit done. Could just be talk of loans or tax-based aid. Either way it will affect the market during negotiations.
Add all the losses and gainz from this year and put it up. It would be nice to see how many milions were burned in the stock market.

This agreement has essentially no bearing on NIO business for years until they begin export in reasonable numbers to APAC countries.

Similar for JD which doesn't do business in other APAC countries yet (though some of it's investments do)

The biggest Chinese stocks to be materially impacted by this change are BABA which owns many of the market places in other countries and does much import/export with other APAC members, TCEHY which operates it's gaming properties in multiple APAC countries and tons of non-tech/non-growth stocks.

For a non-chinese name that should get a big boost is SE which owns Shopee and other platforms.
Without a doubt. If this was a large amount for this guy, he'd have at least stopped touching anything by the halfway point
Feel like tomorrow is going to be a repeat of last Monday. Pump bigly overnight because Biden officially won AZ and GA over the weekend, then tech crashes before open because Moderna releases positive vaccine news

SSRIs plus Adderall is fairly common. You‚Äôll find a lot of bros here who are down on SSRIs, but I‚Äôve been on them over a decade and they‚Äôve saved my life, so I‚Äôm a fan. Adderall, though, really wasn‚Äôt for me. Too many side effects, and it made me hyper-fixate on things to the point I‚Äôd forget to eat and sleep. It works wonders for some, but you‚Äôve got to approach with caution. 

Ultimately, everyone‚Äôs brain chemistry is different, and you‚Äôre not going to know what any drug combo will do until you try it. Pay attention to how you‚Äôre feeling, keep communicating with your doctor, and trust your gut if something doesn‚Äôt seem right.
All those trades are becoming the new upper class white-collar while your average degree expires worthless and you become a member of the peasantry.

It might feel that way, but this hasn‚Äôt happened before; The death rate of new cases is above 5%, this is quite literally the worst the virus has been at, while the market closed 2 days ago at an all time high. Futures open in a few hours, that will be the test of my thesis, I strongly suspect deep red due to virus and lockdown fears.

Gov. Whitmer is expected to announce Michigan restrictions for this next wave of COVID including but not limited to:

- Must WFH unless impossible to do so.
- High Schools must be remote learning
- No Dine-In at restaurants/bars
- Indoor construction projects will be limited to number of workers

Probably not going to impact anything in terms of moves to make, but worth noting that we should expect other states to do similar things.

Jesus you‚Äôre slow. I‚Äôm saying that I have FOMO about not selling at $15. However, I don‚Äôt chase trades. The valuation is crazy. It can get crazier in the short term as stocks trade on emotion and not logic in the short term. I may gamble with options knowing it‚Äôs a toss up but I can‚Äôt buy shares at this price.

don't force it. don't tell yourself that you have to stop completely right now

it's about noticing the emotions you feel right before you're about to hit pornhub

write them down, physically, with a pen and paper

then, notice what you were doing right before the emotions kicked in

write that down

do this several times

this brings your unconscious into the conscious, and raises your self-awareness levels

you'll realize that you're free to make a decision before you start doing what will lead you to go on a porn bender

that's when you can change your actions to do something else instead, and develop new habits

over time, perhaps 2-3 months, depending on how addicted you are, you should be free of it

being free means you can decide when, or if you want to watch porn. it could mean you never watch it again, or it could mean you only watch it once a week for 20 minutes, or whatever

point is, the dependency is gone, and you're in control
TSLA and so many other companies were over-valued as well, and they still are. Tesla for example only sold 368,000 vehicles in 2019 compared to around 5 million sold by Ford or 11 million by Volkswagen. 

It's only going to go up because of future potential and yearly increases in amount sold; their prospects in the Chinese market and future European market; backed by the CCP; their battery swapping station monopoly, etc. etc.

i hoenstly think its just the fact that for most of america the last few weeks we have had our first real cold snaps and snow storms. this is the typical fall period where people get sick with the season change. my guess is covid is just jumping onto the cold/flu train that rolls through our country every fall and spring when the seasons shift.

Where do you see this information? Do you have any source
Ummmm not what this sub is about
If you‚Äôre confident you could‚Äôve sold at 15, there‚Äôs no reason why you sold at 10. See you when you get fomo at 20
Thx! Danm this is sad
Brokerages like robinhood don't allow prolonged day trading (you can do it a few times a week) unless you have 25k in your account. Aside from those reasons, it goes against the wisdom of a lot of the greats, like warren buffett who says the "best time to sell a stock is never", meaning invest in good companies and just let it sit there, as opposed to trying to guess immediate market movement

And to clarify, if you're a billionaire, his method is amazing. But if you're a thousandaire and wanna come up, swing trading / day trading with intelligence and a good chunk of luck is your way, if you're young

Its another Sketchy politician filling his bags. I dont like either sides, im just significantly more anti dem than a proud republican. I believe this will end at the supreme court. Theres a reason this bet pays 5x so im not surprised if i lose. I know that even if the smallest margin of votes gets thrown out in ga or az i can win one of those. There was a lot of shady stuff on election night im hoping even some can get overturned, but like you said they never do it. I think it sets a scary precedent if they dont atleast turn over ga or az
Lmao I wish bro, maybe someday üòÇ
$BJ is either going to make or break me this week.

Losing 30% or more in a month straight off a market peak is I believe unprecedented, so perhaps not. Then again, corrections and bear markets have been unfolding at a record pace recently (the February 2018 correction, the late 2018 bear market, and the 2020 bear market), so we just might.
It would probably be decent, good volatility.
So?
The average age of COVID death is older than the average US lifespan??
It will care about lockdowns, and i'm sure that you can speculate what happens with rising cases.

For me, I just can‚Äôt invest in Chinese owned companies. It doesn‚Äôt feel right to be rooting for them.

Thats right,  it's Robinhood fault...
you can offset capital losses of previous years against any amount of capital gains in future years. 3k/year is for regular income deduction.

calls on a jan 21 lockdown
I have a feeling I‚Äôm going to get fucked.
During deflation the only thing that goes up is inverse stock or vix(sometimes vix will even drop during deflation). Have you checked out the decay on inverse or leveraged inverse stock? I will wait until I am sure we‚Äôve hit a peak again. I‚Äôve been pretty good about calling out peaks the past 2 times we‚Äôve hit them.
I do it. I‚Äôm making bank

Buyden said no to lockdown
March 23 was not the bottom for many stocks, and in particular I think tech stocks (?) didn't drop much more after March 16. More precisely, after March 16 the downward momentum slowed markedly.

Please don‚Äôt start with the plumber shit again lol
Nah, the blue states haven‚Äôt got any bail out from the government, they‚Äôre all running on deficits. Besides super spreader business are a small part of the economy, they‚Äôve already limited thou, outside dining and take out. Let‚Äôs be practical here, they don‚Äôt want to ruin their own states economy, plus we‚Äôve learned that a blunt force shutdown isn‚Äôt the best solution, it‚Äôs better to attack the virus using tactical closures.
Joined theta gang last week on this stock.
That typing random media outlets means just as much as Reddit advice. They are speculation and write both sides each time. So I guess my point is what is the point you are trying to make?
Same, I appreciate drawing my attention to this stock and will do my own DD from here. I wish we had more of these posts. I don't mean boomer stocks, I mean any investment opportunity.
Wtf how did he become a dragon?
Holy shit I just looked it up and the term originated on 4chan like virtually every meme in existence. Fucking crazy that that shit-hole still produces 90% of actual funny things on the internet.
one of two things happens imo. 1. a massive sell off and we have march all over again with a massive spike afterwards when a stimmy and all that gets approved during locksdowns.  basically a clone of the spring. 2. most go red, but not terribly, and stock that benefit from stay at home skyrocket. amazon, zoom, all those guys. 

if you put a gun to my head, id say it'll be a massive sell off tomorrow and it'll be scenario #1.
Hospitals make stupid decisions all the time.
Yeah cruise companies are getting nothing from the US government. Maybe Liberia will pass a stimulus for their companies to help.

I know it can hurt a lot when you lose someone you love - but what's important to take away when they're no longer in our lives are the lessons they taught us and try to move forward.

lol please start this again
Excellent move! Congratulations.
Why would use robinhood to trade when you have 400k
this makes me rly sad :(
The sentiment has significantly changed up in here. 

But the premium on these SPXS bags I‚Äôve been holding since pre election has not.
No, they bought it to sell calls to you suckers, which will eventually bring their cost basis to $0.  Then they can short, buy back with more,  rinse and repeat. Why you think they make billions?
Amazing to have witnessed it in real time.
Any man with 2.7 billion has gorgeous fuccing eyes lol
Will market care about Washington shutting down??
Even blue states are not looking down.

Yeah I've started buying into the hype that Target is going to be a major player for holiday shopping. Seems to be a candidate to 'randomly' pop like 25%. It's down almost 10% from the highs last month.

No national lockdown, but the blue states are going to shut it down while the hill billy red states get a crushing influx of people until their ICUs are no longer functional.

Success? You decide.

None of lockdowns are really as severe as saw in Mar-Jun you do know schools are even open in other countries.
Because stock went brr
sir, this is a casino
Very true
Fuck all the weak nature is doing the inedible

next time it gonna be something way stronger than Covid 

Humans will need to adapt the hard way
with Li autos earnings being above expected, but still not good, i betting people will think nio will follow a same line. my guess is a mass sell off at open and a drop down to 35-40 by close. hype train has left the building and crashed on friday. repairs arnt looking like they will be ready till 2021-2022.

Just gonna leave this here for the morons who still don't get it....

Official CDC mortality (IFR) estimates for Covid-19:

 0-19 years: 0.00003  
20-49 years: 0.0002  
50-69 years: 0.005  
70+ years: 0.054

The market does not care about cases rising, and it shouldn't. It may care about lockdowns.
It isn't unlikely that this earnings underperforms as it contains no console stuff. Guidance might moon it though. Its probably going to have its best quarter ever in q4.
The guy who calls himself caezar-salad is big mad that I don‚Äôt give a fuck about his type 2 diabetes.

wasn't it like in the 70s that day?
Was thinking very least could sell calls to the tards here
Washington‚Äôs lockdown announced today was pretty impactful. Movie theaters, gyms, bowling alleys and such completely closed. No indoor dining and outdoor seating limited to 5 or less.

This is the way
FDs on Uber? I‚Äôm in.
$38 would be a return to pre-COVID levels. Their earnings and revenue were barely impacted and they are actually getting a benefit from surging cases due to the impact on their closed block. It would also be the level that returns the dividend yield to the historical level (around 3.5% annual yield range)

I personally don't listen to Wall Street analysts
Ohh damn futures are going to Moon, Biden‚Äôs team just announced that they have no plans for a national lockdown. RIP bears, also RIP Nio call holders, competition for cash is going to be the nail in the coffin. The reopening trade is back on!!
If yo u started with 50k, you have like the exact same graph as me lol. I'm hovering around 150 rn as well with nio from 16k to 110k lol. Congrats on the gains!

My bet is NIO soft up-and-down for a few sessions before meteoric rise. Jan 70c once it stabilizes. Might get a shot as low as $38, anything under $45 is a good buy imo.
They are inviting people to go all in in nio so they fucking sell and the price Will drop a lot on tuesday. Mark my words

No I respect your point of view, and I‚Äôm not saying you should YOLO your entire account every trade, but if you are young and have 10k saved up doing nothing, I don‚Äôt see a problem with trading and trying to make something out of it rather than having it sit around and do nothing for you. Of course that‚Äôs only if you don‚Äôt need the money

Where did you get the price target of $38 from? 

I am getting median price target of $19-20, high price target of $21-30 and low price target of $15-18 from analysts research report from Fidelity, cnn money, nasdaq dot com. 

You said your price target! Who are you?
I‚Äôve got the same. Feeling pretty nervous lol. Largest 0dte position yet
counter counterpoint, alternative chips and specialized chips are being designed by everyone and their grandmother.  "monopoly" on one type of chip.  just like pepsi has a monopoly on "triangle shaped cheese dusted chips" because they own doritos.  And again, the PE and valuation show the expectation that Nvidia will grow the data center business tremendously.  So they better put out some amazing earnings or they'll drop.  And Intel's data center revenue is still about 3.5 times Nvidias.  So NVDA would still have to grow data center revenue 50% a year for 3 years straight would still take in less than Intel.  Nvidia's main hype comes not from the chip sales, which by comparison to Intel, shows they're wildly overvalued, but on the promise/speculation that they'll be the big winner of the AI explosion in the next decade just as we just saw the cloud explosion last decade.  And not from chip sales, but from software and other solutions they sell with recurring revenue.
Bull or bear, this week is going to undoubtably be important for the momentum going forward.

We‚Äôll see green at open, likely a retest of $353-$356, pump will kick in on Tuesday and then it depends if profit taking will actually happen or if we‚Äôll break out of the 33+ year trend line and melt up.

I personally don‚Äôt see any unknown news that would cause a sell off, everything that is bad is known and at this point the market needs to get to a point that will make up for what it didn‚Äôt make this year. 

We might see some seriously high numbers if this week is able to hold above $360

Somehow people got the idea that capitalism is responsible for all the problems of the world, no realizing that the world is a cold uncaring place and most things that improve on that are thanks to capitalism and people putting work into making and building shit.
Why do people care?

Regardless of whether you think the stock is going up or down, great time to enter options positions on SPCE as IVR is like 13%. Puts or calls, they're cheap. May as well make some bets with the prices low. See you all at the roulette table.
Easy to make a case how the MM‚Äôs are luring Boomers into a false sense of security before the Big Dump. A VP at M Stanley that handles some of my money is telling me this market is headed straight up 25% over today‚Äôs level. He says all his clients are holding, no one is dumping. Bonkers.

My thesis on the market now: wall street thinks throwing enough money at an idea is all it takes to make it happen.  This combined with the abundance of credit provided by the Fed is the reason we are seeing the speculative rallies we have now.  

It's a lot harder to turn good ideas into reality though, and it's even harder to pick who the winners will be.

Idk what the fuck NIO does other than gave me some gainz
Not me. Started my work life making very ordinary money and saved a bit. But that put me on a healthy path of saving and investing that‚Äôs translated to a big portfolio that I don‚Äôt need to yolo to have large returns as my income has gone up. I wouldn‚Äôt want to feel like I was always starting from scratch hoping to hit it big. That‚Äôs like poors playing the lottery and keeping themselves poor.

New Mexico is the 1st state to reintroduce its most strict measures in the form of a 2 week lockdown, from experience it'll probably be longer..
That‚Äôs a solid point, and perhaps will require further scrutiny from the regulators. Again, these were merely drafts; possible solutions to disrupt monopolization. I am not sure how the new rules will come into effect, but at the same time, I think CCP‚Äôs best interest is also increasing China‚Äôs GDP without companies like BABA spiralling out of control. It was a sign of strong arm for these companies to acknowledge that the CCP exists. US does this too with the Big4‚Äôs antitrust talks, it‚Äôs just that the CCP has more power than the US government. But at the end of the day, neither parties want their giants to fail.
Yes. This is why I wish I could invest in SpaceX. They could start mining asteroids in a few years if they made it their main goal instead of putting people on Mars. But if they can put people on Mars, bringing a small asteroid back to Earth wouldn't be any harder. Virgin Galactic wouldn't even have an orbital vehicle yet unless they just bought one from SpaceX or ULA.
Yep hard

They buy these  and sell then they double or maybe 3x in 3-5 years.

I‚Äôve done this a few times and I‚Äôm still profitable. Start saving and stop doing the dumb shit that these retards who make no money tell you to do. 

Here‚Äôs an easy play for you. Buy 100 shares of a company you like (preferably a large cap with limited downside risk). Write covered calls weekly. Take the income and save it. Then take that income plus your continued savings and get enough to buy another hundred shares of another company (in a different sector). Then repeat. Keep doing that until you have an actual portfolio.

I see plenty of cash on the sidelines, that is the big picture that bears are avoiding. We live in a tech enabled world in which the ultra, mega, and normal rich attract abundant new capital which they are essentially forced to put into the equity market in a there is no alternative (TINA) dynamic.

I am looking at the market through the perspective of how much new capital is sitting on the sidelines because that has shown to be, imo, the reason why risk assets / markets are seemingly inflated without fundamental reason.

Accordingly, until the tax environment changes, we should expect net upside in risk assets. That is why stonks always go up lately, there is so much upper class capital flowing in.
Depends on what the market does. If daily deaths suddenly doubles and businesses shut down but the market goes up anyway, then it'll likely go up too. If the market tanks, it'll go down with it. Don't forget, it was at $170 just 8 months ago but it was also 319 just 3 weeks ago.

Wait but I feel as if this would stifle the emergence of new startups, solidifying the oligopoly status of the e-commerce giants as if all the big brands already had exclusivity agreements with an e-commerce giant then Alibaba, JD.com etc couldn‚Äôt really be threatened by new companies emerging. I feel like right now there‚Äôs more competition between the e-commerce giants because they have to compete with each other on their pricing or commission as they sell the same products whereas if the regulators implemented such a policy they could just carve up the map and allocate themselves ‚Äòturf‚Äô, as in who gets to sell which companies‚Äô products, kinda like what the mafia did. If that happens then wouldn‚Äôt the e-commerce giants then have even more pricing power than they currently do as if you really wanted say a pair of Nike trainers and Alibaba were the only ones who sold them then you‚Äôd have to either accept the price they demanded or go to a store?

Serious question:

If a lot of ppl on this sub are currently shitting on Nio saying it‚Äôs going to pop eventually and it‚Äôs not worth as much as it‚Äôs being propped up as then why do so many analysts have it‚Äôs stock valuation projected to be in the $150-$250 range within the next year? All bullshit? I know it‚Äôs speculative but it seems pretty damn high for an EV company that is apparently currently overvalued and will be for the foreseeable future
I like the idea of actually making an investment unlike 98% of this sub, however, look at the long term performance of the stock. In 2017 it fell off a cliff and had been on a serious decline even before the crash in March brought it down to officially bargain levels (2008 prices). Don't just buy in for a dividend, there's better companies for that than this. If you see an upside outside of the decline from 2017-present then kudos and best of luck.

Honestly Microsoft would probably hold up better in a crash than a lot of this stuff. Smaller cloud software firms would see their multiples cut in half easily 

I don‚Äôt care about whether the prevailing mortgage rate is 3% or 6%, it likely makes sense to pay it off if you think there is a large downside risk in the market relative to the upside 

I mean or you could yolo it on Puts in that case but this is not a casino...

Negatory ghost rider, that was a bull trap based on pie in the sky vaccine news IMO.

But the wealth won't be spread equally which could hold spy back. As I mentioned a while back handing someone who has a nw of $10M an extra $10M isn't going to stimulate per se. One person only needs so much food, healthcare etc. So what happens when companies like APPL, wmt etc start to report lower eps in the next decade. Fundamentally economics operates in a closed loop with minimal relief values. It can function with some internal pressure (inequality) but massive amounts of it means that the paper situations don't come to fruition. Then factor stuff like strife and civil unrest and it's ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I mean stifle the emergence of new startups because if all the big brands already had exclusivity agreements with an e-commerce giant then Alibaba, JD.com etc couldn‚Äôt really be threatened by new companies emerging. I feel like right now there‚Äôs more competition between the e-commerce giants because they have to compete with each other on their pricing or commission as they sell the same products whereas if the regulators implemented such a policy they could just carve up the map and allocate themselves ‚Äòturf‚Äô, as in who gets to sell which companies‚Äô products, kinda like what the mafia did
But dude, the short squeeze is coming!!!!!.... retards
solid boomer stonk DD.
I honestly don't know what gamestop could possibly do to turnaround a funamentally dead position. Apple showed the world the benefit of having a walled garden to distribute through, the 30% apple fee for all apps generates insane returns. Windows tried to replicate this with the windows store but hasn't really gained traction. Plus you have steam, epic, the ea one, android, sony, xbox, nintendo and google stadia all providing a "platform" to distribute games online and take their pound of flesh. The question is, besides as a physical retailer, what value proposition does gamestop offer these companies? There's no leverage in this relationship, and huge vested interest in the game makers to own the distribution channel.
They'll definitely make money though.   Most DOD contractors try to stay under the radar for a reason
Translation: your summation is correct. If the dips keep coming then buy more
Actually this thinking will kill you if you are really trading and not doing dumb yolo bets.

The market has been at an aggressive, unsustainable pace. That‚Äôs independent of any of the headlines. The Fed is implementing strategies that have never been used before. It‚Äôs a fragile system. No one can time a drop or a crash but it‚Äôs reckless to be all-in on options right now without significant hedges.
More bullish on the Airbnb IPO because they‚Äôve actually been profitable on and off whereas DoorDash operates at a loss in hopes they‚Äôll be more efficient in the future

Still seems like it‚Äôll probably pop though
Yes we all knew this is going to blow up get in on Monday or miss out
Fair point but if I'm not mistaken the prevailing mortgage interest was double or higher than it is today, so the trade off decision is a little different.

Also, there are lessons to learn from the Ballmer Microsoft years that might be transferrable to today, which would out you in a different stonk.

Also, we've normalized extreme quantitative intervention that we can all see is artificially boosting risk asset prices. I want in on that parabolic move, especially given that stonks are taking share away from smaller firms in main street economy.

Was on SSRIs for years and it will take an involuntary commitment for me to take them again. NOT saying that nobody should take them, just saying that for ME, they are not the answer. I needed to, and will need to in the future, work through my shit in a different way. SSRIs did turn me into a zombie, made it impossible to bust a nut (could fuck for hours but could never finish) and the weight gain was no fun. The positive was that it was easier for me to "not give a shit" so stuff that might have thrown me into a full blown funk were mere inconveniences and temporary bullshit when I was on SSRIs. Took years of therapy to get to the point where I had the tools I needed to navigate the ups and downs of life without the safety net but I am there and will always need to go back into more intensive therapy for a tune up every now and again. 

Currently take Ritalin. Have no idea how I managed life without it.
No, they did not mention breaking up the company. The possible breaking up of the company that you might hear of could have been due to Jack Ma stepping on CCP‚Äôs feet, but I highly doubt anything will transpire from this. The CCP made BABA but at the same time, BABA is bringing so much money and attention to the Chinese markets. Their relationship is almost symbiotic. I think BABA is here to stay; Jack Ma? Maybe not.
A long long time ago
Good luck to both of us

You should definitely also get ahold of some good cbd strains and the anti inflammatory potency  of those is really good in conjunction with everything of the detox process and overall. Cbd takes a bit longer during decarb to activate like 90 minutes instead of 44ish for normal flower. I like a group out in organ that rhymes with bettlebarns.

That's a question. On one hand we have unprecedented backstopping and a government that atleast in it face willing to pump in as much money as possible. On the other hand the economic situation has never been this dire and there doesn't seem to be any relief there. 

I would say all the signs point to this being a short term pump and then a long period of flatness after dumping hard.

But like I mentioned above we are in uncharted water. It could just keep going up and up if people realize that they don't have the traditional paths to wealth anymore (work a job, save and open a CD and let compound interest do it works) so why not continue to pump in cash? Will labor finally give up and accept their fate? Are unions and private pensions on their last leg?

Even looking at data it's hard to parse it. Take me for example. As someone in their thirties you could expect me to spend like a wild man and not give a shit. Instead I'm even more reclacitrant and tripling down on my cost cutting. I had plans to take a vacations and get a new car last year but I think that's not going to happen for years. Now if a few hundred thousand people think this way next year and beyond it won't matter how much the feds pump and congress floods. If the people who need to spend become like the people after the great depression spy is going to like 200

Do you think this cycle has a longer run in it or are we seeing the beginning of the end?
I went all in on like the first and second day of the crash with QQQ and SPYG shares (I didn't know enough about options then) I got destroyed in the next few weeks, but I still thought markets would recover. 2 weeks later I was a little more spooked, so I started buying a share of NOBL every day instead QQQ or SPYG, as I figured it was a safer investment long term to go with dividend growth. Then I also bought some shares of Boeing cause I figured they're too big to fail. Made out pretty decently. Wish I knew what I know about options now back then. But the best thing I did was to never sell. Only gay bears sell. Fuck all that.

Jeff Bezos sold billions in shares when the stocks peaked in March just before the lockdosn and the crash happened. He then sold billions a day or 2 before the pfizer vaccine was announced and stocks rose across the board for just about every company APART from Amazon. Amazons share price dropped. How lucky ay?

If this class is simply on financial fundamentals - you can write a pretty easy bull case for intel - it‚Äôs trading at x2 annual revenue, ~9 PE, 30% profit margin, pretty okay cash flow and current ratio. 3x asset to liability. If you also need to write a bear case for the company as well - you could write about growing competitors in the field, the CEO, declining quality of product, stagnating YOY growth, etc.

I dont. Its so easy to get upvotes, all you have to do it pump a meme stock and say stocks only go up.  I never understood downvoting someone that has  a different opinion on here, just read and keep it moving ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I forget this the first time for a bunch of you.  It gets easier after you have been through it a few times.
For real though, I‚Äôm so scared my dad is on this sub. Dude man needs to be playing safe being so close to retirement. If he told me he YOLO‚Äôd 200k on KODK, I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do.

Gotta watch that one. As a bigger guy, im really interested in styles like Hearns or Foreman how they use contact to frame punches and control their opponent. His breakdowns of Lomachenko are awesome. That guy took it next level by blending the footwork with contact based techniques.

Do people realize how much harder it is to reach orbit than pop into space for 5 minutes? Like at least 10x harder

The energy required to get to orbital altitude is 7% of the energy needed to get there AND actually orbit. 

And that doesn't even account for the much higher danger of needing to go 17,500 mph instead of terminal velocity for re-entry. 

Hypersonic human flight is a retarded idea.

If you built up enough in your brokerage/options fun account to pay off your mortgage, would you do it or just let it ride on boomer stocks? Keeping it in the market is mathematically the better move more than likely, but that psychological freedom of no mortgage is tempting.
Nah I understand this. It's kind of like being in shock when in a car accident. Eventually it'll hit but the short term you're pretty chill or in disbelief

I think Trump will lose every single challenge.  My understanding is also that Trump and party would have to foot the bill for the cost of any recounts. They are asking for donations but most of the money won't even go to the recounts. It is Trump just trying to cover his debts from the campaign.  Shady F*cker.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.politico.com/amp/news/2020/11/12/trump-fraud-claims-fundraising-436188

Rather, 60 percent of a donation up to that amount for Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúOfficial Election Defense Fund‚Äù is routed to a new PAC started this week by the president that can pay for a wide range of activities ‚Äî but is likely legally barred from spending on recounts, lawyers say. The remaining 40 percent goes to the Republican National Committee, which is allowed ‚Äî but not required to ‚Äî spend on the recount. Prior to Tuesday, the majority of a donation went to helping Trump‚Äôs campaign cover its debt.

OP's other comments:

> Not fake dear fellow trader.. I wish it was paper money. I have been devastated and went through a depression like phase for months due to continuous losses. I was chasing losses but could never really recover and the core strategy was to buy short term puts. Retrospectively, the worst strategy in the biggest bull and bubble market of all times.

and:

> Absolutely not rich parents. They are lower middle class. All of these was my hard earned money over 10 plus years. Retard and impulsive decisions.. Like a gambling addiction. Took me a long time to realize what I was getting myself into. Too late to little.

and:

> No inherentance but all of that was my hard earned money that I earned and saved over 10 years. I'm fking retarded to lose it all. Will take a lifetime to recover but I'll post when I do recover.

My thinking is that when they first announced that their test flight was going to take place "later this fall" and said the window for that opens on Oct 23rd, it was a pretty vague announcement and while initially the stock went up as BoA and and other insitutions raised the price targets and said some good things about the company, nothing much happened in October, so the hype was going down, and during earnings they finally set the nov19-23 date for the flight. Also, there were some reports/articles speculating that Richard Branson needed cash for one of his other companies so there could be dilution( which didn't happen). Apart from that, nothing significant happened to SPCE for it to drop like it did.

Whoever bought it at $10 congrats but that was a big risk too. 

Please do your research (even for a full Saas company) very few trade over 20x revenue.

Probably great growing up rich in some ways, but you cant put a value on seeing the world from the bottom up. You look at a guy like Elon, hyper brilliant, yet his lack of real world experience makes him seem like a teenager at times. Most rich people have a soft, doughy look about them, even when theyre super fit. Living your life on easy mode from birth makes you weak in certain respects. If I get rich at this point in my life I would feel grateful for my hard, shitty past as it would give me insight and make me strong and really appreciate the money.
Robinhood is RIGGED! If you only count my good trades my portfolio WON big! By allowing illiquid assets to be traded on its platform they RIGGED the market against US! My portfolio will be green in the end. I CONCEDE NO losses!

That's not what I said. Alibaba revenue comes from Chinese buyers. China's economy thrives on exports which fuels their middle classes paychecks.

Over the last decade americans have spent a fortune on goods (mostly on credit but w/e) and china benefits because most of those goods are made there. So every dollar that america spends or doesn't spend impacts their gdp.
Ya I was wondering how many tax brackets I jump
Definitely PRPL or GME....they'll definitely be around in 100 years
That‚Äôs exactly what they are doing. Funds are tracking WSB, Robinhood, etc to front run retail trades, then more retail traders fomo into the stock and it balloons. It‚Äôs why PLUG, NIO etc have gone parabolic
E2Open has that network capability and sits on top of the SAP/Blue Yonder/ Oracle supply chain platforms that companies use and uses its network and integration tools to synchronize the data and roll it up into a comprehensive front-end dashboard that has encompasses your entire supply chain from upstream to downsteram

At the end of the day man it is just money. A steady job and a good wife and kids is really all that matters when you think about it.

We know who holds puts now ü§£
Yeah but that didnt double up in an hour either
Not that I‚Äôve found. Yeah it usually happens on a cross divergence, but can happen significantly earlier. Options prices are based around the bid/ask spread of the stock. If there are no bids then the call will be more expensive, and if there are no sell orders the puts will be more expensive.

SAP kinda does the same thing but not really. And the reason SAP got clapped is for a number of company-specific things. First, sap noted that they‚Äôre seeing increased demand for their cloud conversions, even within their core on-premise customer base. This was viewed negatively bc SAP had previously though their legacy/maintenance customers would continue their buying behavior while ether saw cloud growth in other products like Concur‚Äîbc of this increase in shift to cloud conversions, this implies a mid-single digit decline rate in their existing maintenance customer base which suggests that fy21 and fy22 will likely see no revenue growth (possibly declines) as they go through the license to subscription transition. Also, because of this expedited timeline, SAP‚Äôs cloud business which usually runs at a ~70% gross margin will now take a hit bc of increased R&D spend to push delivery and maintain feature function parity with the move to cloud to meet the new timeline its customer demand has laid out. The second is that SAP has had a lot of C-level turnover which has caused it to struggle to message the story to the street‚Äîtheir longtime CEO bill mcdermott left last October and was replaced with Co-CEO‚Äôs, but one of the dual CEO‚Äôs left abruptly in April leaving just on CEO. The third thing is the concur product‚Äîconcur is basically their cloud crown jewel product, it‚Äôs basically an expense platform and tho it‚Äôs cloud based it took a hit bc of less business travel and less things being expensed so it saw a worse than guided rebound. Given that this was propped up as their flagship cloud venture and it saw underwhelming growth, it was a big blight on the Cloud story SAP had been putting out

Yes that‚Äôs the article I‚Äôve also seen, but that news in there about Sun Art and Baba is from 10/18, so who knows right now.
Baba has upside but their fate is tied to the Chinese economy which relies heavily on exports. If americans don't have money to spend on their goods then how will their middle class have money to spend on alibaba.

They don't have a jerome powell over there raining credit  down like he's oprah.
I made my money on that piece of shit trash. No complaints here man. Cool set the reminder. I give no fucks. I will make my money here as well and dip out. Might not hold it‚Äôs gains but I am making the cash.

I didn‚Äôt know anything about it outside it was American EV that was real cheap unfortunately and all my money was tied up in PLTR and MU.
Will I still get IV crushed after NVDA ER if I buy a call debit spread tomorrow buy 560c and sell 600c for 01/21?
And MSFT is not one of them
Heartily agree with most, although my personal risk level is much higher than yours. What on earth do you mean by "

You can say whatever you want if you just want to be unhelpful. But the accepted industry standard has been around $100 million in revenue for at least 30 years

Literally google ‚Äúrevenue to ipo‚Äù and every article mentions $100 million as the rule of thumb for more acceptance by investors and of course says it could vary

Doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt be successful with less but it‚Äôs a very small percentage of IPOs because the fees and compliance requirements work against you without scale to absorb them

The time frame is more of the new news people have been thinking it would be a short delay, just wanted to clarify it might be way longer .and id you're trying to play BABA based on the ipo get much further out calls
its retarded tho, people on here dont fucking know anything about options, only buying calls and puts and crazy FD's and the new retards think that is how. options work, and it cant be further from the truth. Options well give you alot of options on how to invest and trade your money, people are ignorant and dont give a fuck about educating themselves about trading options and then simply claim its a gamble. if you started or invested into business of any kind without any fucking knowlage about certain field you would lose money even quicker.

Trading is my main source of income just because it is outperforming my regular day job. I spend all day and all week analyzing and watching the market because one small piece of news can cause a world of hurt. Saturdays are my days off mentally, but I still watch different analysts to get multiple perspectives on the market to possibly provide insight into something I overlooked(nobody is perfect and I am constantly trying to learn).      

If I wasn‚Äôt able to actively trade, I would try to work on building swing trades based around the 2-4pm et to 9:30am et swing trades. They can be highly profitable with maybe a couple hours of work a day(15 minutes to trade in 3 different segments with a 1 hour overstudy of how the day went/going over how you timed the market using indicators.

i hope youre right, but i dont think being enviromentally conscious is enough for most people to pay a premium for a car that does less... only reason tesla and nio are popping is because they are legit cars that have better services and growth than a traditional ford or gm that has been sustained for years...

Yeah I‚Äôm gonna throw the rest of my cash on it tomorrow.  Most of my funds are tied up so I was only able to get a small position on it originally (500 shares at IPO).  Also have a few Palantir calls that are pretty heavily in the green might sell some of those for more shares.  I‚Äôve been high on it for a while but everything I‚Äôve seen is only strengthening my confidence in this company.
Percentage wise, what value of Tesla‚Äôs stock price is assumed to include the success of SpaceX? I ask cause the stock price was impacted greatly by the last successful launch for Crew Dragon and it‚Äôs postponement. That coupled with EVs performance in general seeming to be closely following each other, I‚Äôm wondering how significant of a move TSLA could make overnight into open.

My concern is more of a general concern rather than NVDA. If MRNA or another vaccine company reports something unexpected vaccine wise does that trigger another sell off of anything tech related.

Speaking from a phycological stand point, wouldn't it make sense that as COVID cases rise and lockdowns go into effect and toilet paper runs out, that people will remember last time (since it was only 8 months ago) and this will trigger people wanting to sell at the top and not go through another crash? Thus, causing a crash? So, like, massive circuit breaker tomorrow?

I‚Äôve doubled down my GME positions as it‚Äôs obvious from all of the names sneaking in that something‚Äôs going to happen. Being able to guess it with options is a different monster and not very WSB friendly anymore. Options activity is insane this week but it could be the shorts finally trying to cover. 

This is probably a rebranding/ECOM pivot/turnaround story at this point. Share buyback or taking the company private. (Will destroy the shorts) Hard to pick a catalyst range. I‚Äôm in as long as Cohen is in. The guy was able to compete with amazon in short order and sees something in the gaming/accessory segment.
only one man? shoulda swept that strike
Yeah thats my biggest concern.  This is more of a ride the wave into earnings then jump ship play.  Maybe hop on a put or two before market close Thursday
How do we know this isn‚Äôt photoshopped?

I'll probably sell the 11/20's before earnings and hold the longer ones.
Never said we were, but the landscape changed. They did lose to music streaming. If it were up to the music industry they‚Äôd still have complete control and charge $20 for 12-15 songs and sign artists to record labels, write songs for them, and market them as a product. It‚Äôs not the same anymore. Now they sell packages of music to Walmart so they can play it in the background while you shop.

Normally nvda doesn't move much after ER, +- 3% in either direction I've ver seen. But as stated before me, NVDA still has to trample those already high expectations AND raise future guidance by a decent amount. They normally always beat, but lower the bar for the future(which mostly always leads to selling off.). Im a huge NVDA bull, but there's this voice inside me saying there's less risk with puts than calls and would probably be better off just hedging my long shares. HOWEVER, I am currently holding:

530c 11/20
555c 11/20
580c 1/15
720c 3/19
As well as a handful of shares.

Only a very small percentage in F and G at the beginning of the LF, more and more over time.  It's like having cash in you - portfolio to buy stocks when the market goes down.  The daily rebalance is the advantage of the LF - basically constantly buying low and selling high. Your method is decent and I used to do that prior to the LF funds - but I would re-balance monthly. - the older LF have an average annual return of 12%
LF 2065 current holding percentage.

I‚Äôm holding some 7.5 leaps that I‚Äôll take a small loss on. I‚Äôm scared for my 11/20 5.5c, I‚Äôll probably sell those first and then wait. I actually believe this company could be worth money or at the very least piggyback other successful Ev companies and their momentum
My nihilist thoughts exactly, gonna double my position on it tomorrow at open because it was literally created by thiel and funded by In-Q-Tel aka the CIA, the governments not just gonna let this go they‚Äôre already bought in.

Looks like all that was really pointed at BABA and Jack Ma. JD is gonna crush earnings and get plenty of upgrades this week. They also have the JD Health IPO coming up soon. Holding 100c 11/20 and 130c 1/15/21.

BILI is expected to lose EPS but gain revs. Betting on a surprise beat. 60c 1/15/21.
Whats wrong with that?

It's all a zero sum game, even if your gains are not only one person's losses. It's all money, it doesn't just materialize in your trading account.
CALPERS is also the fund that removed their hedges right before the February crash this year. They would have been due about a $1B payday.
It‚Äôs easy to just keep it all in because it‚Äôs easier to grow the more you have. But that‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre winning. 

That‚Äôs where I failed, I went from 20k to 60k in less than 3 months. Since it‚Äôs not linear I woulda probably made close to a million dollars if I kept the same amount of risk for the proceeding 9 months. But winning that often for that long would be like winning a raffle contest at a large event. Not impossible but unlikely.

You‚Äôre already ahead of the game, you don‚Äôt seem greedy.

Right now they have 3 businesses

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Game: their cash cow right now, but they're reaching their ceiling. No new products/distribution deals recently. But being backed by tencent, I'd say the gaming business is very stable at least.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†E-commerce (shopee): it's growing rapidly at this moment with >100% YoY every quarter. The group CEO said that it can become profitable anytime if they decide to cut down marketing cost (but they won't). Very bullish on this business.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†SEA money: honestly this is the smallest business at the moment but people seem to have high hope for this. Just a wallet integrated to the Shopee App and Airpay under some regions. If they can compete for e-banking license (which is put on hold due to covid-19) in Singapore, i expect the business to boom as they'll be allowed to give out loan to their huge customers base.

A side note is that despite it's called a Singapore company, the company is barely active in Singapore market since it's so small, so you'll often heard negative opinion about the company from Singaporean
I know they‚Äôre ugly af but they do have great use commercially, congested countries and cities, etc so I think they will sell plenty of units

Absolutely.  I bought in Friday mostly because of where the technicals are at.  If it doesn't run up, I'll hold through earnings and hope for a pop.  Its consistently been one of the strongest companies during the pandemic, so I'm confident it'll do well.  And having an extra two weeks in case shit goes wrong this week gives me a little comfort

Buy high expire worthless.
Volatility is better for options traders that play on wedges and like to make money off of movement and head fakes. Essentially trading upon support/resistance lines with a chance of breaking trend both ways.       

Volatility is bad for long traders and options sellers as the volatility means they will likely have to roll down at an inopportune time leading to horrific losses.

Market tendencies are a study thing.       

News sources: Bloomberg and CNBC but I bet against both of their advice and look for one specific options analyst on the options insider run at 3:15et because his options have been printing when he is on tv, but everyone has been a flop. Dont trade their butterflies or wedges as they are usually the most volatile and are trying to sell positions instead of boosting their own positions. The guy I like only recommends buying puts and calls naked, and he has hit 100%.
Not hard left. Not retarded either.
let us know before you trade so we can inverse

And just a couple weeks before, everyone was memeing MSFT 200c, AMD 60c, and SPCE 30c. I remember I was losing bigly on my puts and sold too early during the dead cat bounce (right before the OPEC news/weekend), which mostly wiped out my account. The Monday after was circuit breakers. Managed to climb my way back up almost and then lost almost all of it again on SPY 180p. I trusted you, Separate-Variation üò≠
Do you hold till expiry? or sell/buy one of the legs at certain points?
Yea man it can eat you up if you wallow in it. *I should‚Äôve done this, or that and my life woulda been so different right now.*

It‚Äôs like the age old question would you rather spend 10 years in heaven then spend eternity in hell or just go straight to eternity in hell. Your 400k was a portion of your life that you got to enjoy OP. Look back at it as a happy memory not a painful one you lost.

Just being a bit facetious. I appreciate the long post and I saved it to think about.

Is trading your primary source of income? How much time do you spend thinking/analyzing/watching in a week?

Where would you advise someone with a full 9-5 job to focus their limited time. Other than glancing at stocks during the day and putting in an order I don‚Äôt have time to watch closely.

What would you
This is actually a fucking horrible mindset. Cutting losers and taking profits when you have them is how you make consistent gains. "Diamond hands" is a fun meme but it's fucking terrible advice that loses so many people on this subreddit an insane amount of money. This is not why you are such a fucking failure.

It sounds nice. Trying to capture something happening and making sense of it is very human. But I personally think that pretending things are ever going to be as they once were going forward is a dream.

Remember Napster? Remember the music industry being unable to accept the reality of Napster? Look at music today. Robinhood is a sign of things coming... it‚Äôs probably too late to stop whatever that thing is that‚Äôs coming.

I have 1% hedged, but even hedging can be a killer if the volatility decreases.

Nobody is a rockstar at trading day 1, so it‚Äôs probably best to learn HOW to trade before you go nuts deep. Go ahead and tell me more about hedging when your portfolio is more valuable than mine.

For sure in the longer-term, even though there won't be opportunities for meteoric short-term growth. Because I YOLOed myself into such a deep hole, I'm looking for shorter-term gains and CBAK is the best I've got right now, but I'm hoping for more along the same lines.

Just a little tip. Use your tfsa for safe index investing. You have nothing to gain from investing in risky stocks. You either lose contribution room forever and can't write your loses off your taxes, or you make a lot of money and get audited by the CRA and most likely end up paying taxes + penalties on your gains. It is basically a lose lose situation.
You might be right. I think it's going higher based on guidance and has a lot of room to go from there--way more room for short and medium-term growth than I think NIO does at this point--but I'm not going to tell other people I'm certain of it based on my measly 3k of shares.

I only buy things for myself on my trades. Just like I have a price target to sell, I have a plan on where the money is going. 1/3rd for taxes, 1/3rd I keep to grow the portfolio. 1/3rd I treat myself on one item/experience. Each trade has a designated item tied to it based on how much the profit will be. The item is usually under the profit I make so I just leave it in my bank for a future use.

Do you think bears will lose more money on spy puts at the bottom back in March or at this triple top that they think is forming?
You citron scum
I want to right away say thank you for writing something worth reading. In my case any advice is appreciated because I cant yet value one person's opinion more then another's on here yet. 

I was a little confused. Do I use "Stop Price" as well as Limit Price or just straight up use Limit Price to set at 6 or where I feel comfortable? If I do use Stop Price I would need a quick tip what to set it to.

Honestly I'm not worried by NIO itself so much as it is the amount of money. You pretty much said it perfect about winning some compared to losing a lot.

By averaging down (for the 45) do you mean pulling out as soon as I'm safe?
If you got rid of puts, why don't you think the market will rise to my strikes? You think it will just trade straight?

I agree about the 70C. It was a really bad spur of the money decision because of some loses on another move. This is something that has confused me since day 1;. Even though the strike price is 70 will someone really still buy it even if its only lets say just $50-60?
yea wtf is he doing here
But also it seems like a play to get in and hold for a week or 2
But how do I trade on Robinhood if the powers out

yea fr, i used to think it takes big money to win big money until i lost like 35k cause of greed, now i feel happy when i make like $100 on a quick scalp lmao
Completely agreed.  
Options trading is much worse.

The most I've ever been able to bet on a single hand of blackjack was 30K (only allowed 3 hands per person, 10K max).

With options, you can literally bet the entire farm one on play as there's no cap. I also get a much higher dopamine hit from playing options.  
The rush and anxiety from betting larger amounts and the value you get from one play (you can derive at least 24 hours of fun if you buy a 1DTE FD play at market open).

You'll get the rush from the entire market day, after hours, futures, pre-market and then market open.   
I haven't been back to the casino since, the only reason I can think of going back is because the weekends are boring!

Imagine that, going the casino to take a break from options trading.

I think it could go either way. Up or down that's my prediction.

also fellas, if you want an obscure not hyped yet field to invest in that will def reap huge growth in 2-3 yrs is cyber security. crowdstrike is alright, but its got a lot of hype from the pandemic trade... a company like rapid 7 with stellar financials will triple its stock price in 1-3 yrs. cannot go tits up

Hope you're not right--I added an edit which hopefully clarifies that I'm meaning this to stimulate discussion about other under-the-radar plays rather than specifically push CBAK.

When I started on here I only daytraded weeklies. Then once I fell below 25k and couldn't pull out at will I dropped down to about 5k or 6k.. now I've switched to leaps that I can just hold until they are profitable and it's crazy seeing my portfolio actually going up over time. I never hold my leaps longer than a few days usually but it's nice not having to worry about a drop in price day to day. Back up to about 23k

You need better shoes. Shin splints shouldn't really be caused from just running. Either that or you need the proper orthotics.

Also don't keep running on them if you've developed bad splints. Take advil daily, try to find time to ice, and let them heal up. If you don't it can develop into stress fractures.

Not at all. I‚Äôm a huge advocate for Amazon I got in at 984 in 2017 and I‚Äôm still holding. Amazon is such a dominating force and always will be unless they get broken up. But why not get into the only company that has a shot to compete with them? No matter who wins you win. 

Amazon and Walmart are huge winners during this pandemic, even though WMT stock wise might not show it yet.

I opened in august. Jumped into an options trading group not knowing what I was doing lost 1500 off of my first 2 options trades. 

Made half of it back then lost a bunch more after the tech sell off. Just started regularly trading made some money then got greedy hopped back into options then lost all of my gains lol.
Ahh I see.  Well the company either way will still have a test flight.   There might be a dip on Monday, but There is still a lot of people waiting to buy in on any dip.
First, im not the one to ask for this but I can try.. This might pump again before ER. Set limit sell orders for the 45C at 6.00 or whatever you feel comfortable going higher at. 

It seems to me like you are realizing you bet more than you were willing to lose so it's better to lose $20 and miss out on a couple hundred than lose most of $600 chasing a few hundred. You can set a stop loss conditional order on robinhood. 

Again, I dont think you were trying to yolo and probably were disturbed by how unsafe this play felt after buying it (I know that feel). So get out and live to die another day. You may miss out on doubling your money but thats rhe max I can possibly see. 12.00 would have a breakeven of 57, with IVs at 200% and controversial ER, not smooth sailing. It says theta is -.45 but I imagine that changes constantly the OI going into tomorrow is enormous. 

If this is a yolo, just average down should nio drop below 40 again Monday.i sold most of my puts i wanted to hold post er because of how volatile this stock is. 

The 70C needs to be dropped, someone else will probably buy it 1.60 but that's not one to diamond hand even if you wake up with enormous confidence
Lockdowns and COVID numbers are bullish you fool

I like catching falling knives, not buying at the peak and selling in panic tyvm. Aapl taught me that lesson(bought the ‚Äúdip‚Äù at 129 and 126). I‚Äôll go ahead and wait till stuff tanks and I can pick it up with more confidence like HSBC, CRS, VRS when I bought them.

There's confusion around this date. I first read 180 days from direct listing, but then started seeing some people say January. The best answer I found was on page 72 of their prospectus filing to the SEC. Its worded weird, but my takeaway was mid February. It basically says insiders can sell remaining shares 3 days after earnings for year ending 12/31/20 are made public. So I'm assuming that means 3 days after their Q4 earnings report. Q3 was last week so 3 months from there roughly?

The party involving new companies is mostly over, since as you mentioned the production capability on companies like Fisker is too far out. 

The next opportunity will be correctly guessing which legacy automaker will have the best EVs as the fight for market share takes hold. It will be less about innovation as the tech peaks and more about execution, design, and driving dynamics.

Don‚Äôt think you understand how ark buys. They are not looking for short term gains. Their time line is more like 8-10 yrs. They look at patterns that can disrupt industries in that timeline. It just so happened that a lot of these stocks made an insane growth run due to COVID creating that positive feedback loop. Sure they might pick up a couple of duds in that timeline, but since inception cathies funds have outperformed most funds and not because it‚Äôs a bubble

I‚Äôd rather buy cyclicals through options as it is cheaper than buying stock based on the durations I would be interested in, and I am really only invested in spacs and vix stock due to the cost of buying long options. I made triple digit profit percentages from fri-mon last week and I made 8% from mon-Friday. In short, with 17k invested I would‚Äôve turned that into 40k within 1 week on returns. Different strategies help different people. My strategy may not work for you and your strategy may not work for me. We r all trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.

To be honest I‚Äôve never traded options, I only buy or sell a stock straight on.. so I couldn‚Äôt tell you.. what I can tell you is that I have absolutely NO idea where this stock is at in 2022... the maximum I dear to talk about is 3months from now..
Don‚Äôt even see the advantage with options.. wouldn‚Äôt buy a stock if I wasent sure of the speculation

Could be. I'm not familiar with the players in the space beside Musk, etc.

That said, i think the cash creates a floor to price, ie dont buy 5$ or less puts.
Who is more ballsy.  Bulls long SPY despite new ATH and parabolic COVID cases, or Bears going short after the vaccine announcement.

Both sides definitely have merit.
Or next
Sounds like timely and relevent intelligence to me

I feel about the same way. I'm a much smaller fish, all I could afford was $2k on a 6/21/21 300C, when spot was \~265.

I feel pretty confident about just holding on to this thing straight into February (unless we gap up a hundred dollars, but I doubt that). What I'm wondering about is whether I should plan to ride it a little further and try to net A. earnings from Chinese New Year and B. Possibly a re-filing for ANT IPO. But then I'd be in the speedy 120-day theta decay curve. if we gap down on bad news it would be much harder to recover.

I think it's undervalued right now, and will see a jump from people FOMOing back in at some point, but I also expect a general appreciation in price because, well, it's a good company (assuming they're not lying on those unaudited financials I got from the SEC). $400 by March is very, very optimistic, but I don't think it's insane.

Yep I feel you hahaha I too got burned on Tesla calls lol. Honestly the game of options is super stressful. I found that when I wanted to check how the stock was doing but I was worried about seeing the price of my options I would just view the stock price either on google or on the ‚Äústocks‚Äù app (IOS). Robinhood really likes to plaster your account value right on the front page and can really make you feel shitty about yourself if you keep looking at it.
Nice.

How much revenue for a company to go public
Explain plz
I also had 1000 at $7 cost basis. It went to $11 and then ER was so shitty it lost like 30% in one day. I listened to the call and it was super cringy as well with some Chinese dudes that couldn't answer any questions because they knew like 3 English words. But that was before it plummeted to $1.50 as well, kinda felt validated because I went out at a small loss long before that. So you would have needed some kind of devine insight to buy a stock that just plummeted the first year non-stop. I think NIO was also mentioned here quite often shortly after its IPO but people lost interest after it went to -80% IPO price.

NIO is the one ER I plan to hold through. The upside potential is far greater than the downside at this point and the perceived good ER is bound to make this skyrocket.

Until you get a good grasp on trading just take the small/medium wins when possible and don‚Äôt throw all your money in at once. 

If you make a solid buy and are up a good bit sell a portion. Use this as a buffer incase things start going south.

Remember to hedge on risky plays. (You should probably almost always hedge tho).
Sounds fucking great to me
They sold out because there is little amount produced for now.

It's easy to counter them with little bit of extra supply, but since they are in race with amd they had to run head first before amd steals noticeable market share.

tbh i feel like i said it wrong so im gonna say it really stupid cause i actually do appreciate any advice. so one is $45 Strike Price and i bought it for $600 expiring the 20. the other call is $70 S.P for $160 expiring also 20. really appreciate anything helpful you might have to say

Yep, it's absolutely viable  Its fluid though, dynamic; once a technical setup works too often, it often then fails. 

One important lesson I've learned about TA is failed follow thru from a reliable setup is often the most powerful market signal.

Anyone further left than the alt-right won't win in those places regardless. Being a moderate isn't something that those people would want, sk there's no reason to try to appeal to them. The only success you'll have is appealing to the people that don't vote because they don't like the previous options.
80% cash? Just how retarded are you. Shameful!!

The fact is... that most of us only are able to read emoji.
I have 16k in stocks and 1.2k in options. No cash at the moment because I used it to buy the september to now dips. 

I‚Äôm fine holding this portfolio and selling covered calls. I‚Äôm up 2.5k in 2 1/2 months. 

Holding that much cash is fine - obviously. Can‚Äôt lose money you don‚Äôt invest but you also won‚Äôt get any of the jumps a vaccine or stimulus provides. We are in a wild timeline where investments can have multi year returns in months. It‚Äôs silly not to invest in blue chips or speculative rebounds (Cinemark, cruise lines and airlines) right now. 

For example I bought 200 shares of Cinemark at 8.28 which are now upwards of 13.65 with plenty of room to run to pre-Covid levels of 27-40.

Go on a 10k road trip.
Wmt been making big plays all year to go after Amazon with driverless cars, drone delivery, pet care, pharmacy.  Earnings with wmt+ subscriber numbers could pop it up above $160 easily. Recent polls have shown 11-17% of Americans have already subscribed to Walmart plus but then again we all know polls are BS. Little downside except they did take a loss on the sale of the South American business, now limiting store capacity and Tiktok acquisition sounds iffy. The Company‚Äôs P/E ratio is higher than its peers but praying people forget about that when they see all the Walmart + subscribers. 


That said I got 200 of the 11/20 c$160, 100 of the 12/18 c$160, 50 of the 1/15 c$165 and 50 of the 11/20 p$145

Yep lost all that $ from buying SPY puts when the market started its V shaped recovery. I started transferring more of my savings into here and it just went all downhillüòÖ also the government gave some nice unemployment checks for a little while and I put some of that into the account. I‚Äôve saved most of it bc I lost 20k in the market but that unemployment helped fuel my autism.
Literally any five people at VP level or above from any company that actually produces cars would be equally impressive.

The big pile of capital just means more downside risk.

There is just no rational thesis for this company. It is 100% pure retarded meme stock yoloing.

Doubling down on NIO calls at open or am I retart?
Ya it's a bit interesting, in the past ten years, more and more pension fund managers  have started to take riskier positions, some of them because of what happened in 08. It's as though some of them want to play catch up for the losses that happened around that time.  Some of the defined benefit plans, which are mostly public servant pension funds these days , are underfunded or have a hard time hitting the returns they need to support the funds and payouts to pensioners. Anyhow, hopefully it works out, sometimes I wonder who is advising these fund managers, the other ones I can understand but Nikola after all the things that happened, should have been a hard no...

There is some legit loss porn in the posts today, serious question, how do people lose that final percent to get to 100% losses?
Um that‚Äôs comparing holding cash vs holding assets for a long period of time. The cash is my insurance towards building new strategies. Your Dd is correct, but we are in different time. Dollar inflation is sky high and the dollar is weak. We have never had a stock market this strong with an economy this weak. Go ahead and yolo your money if you‚Äôre not in my family and lmk how that goes.
Yep but I also can‚Äôt read so it‚Äôs nbd
ROP is indeed a holding company but extremely active in their managed companies but as stated they will fire the CEO and move on. The part about CEOs not lasting long is dependent on which company, some have the same CEO for 10+ years.

Tomorrow is going to be bad. Not this level of bad obviously, but I fully expect a -3% day for the S&P.

My strategy is essentially to catch falling knives. I am confident that I will be able to time the market pretty accurately. Before I adopted this strategy I was consistently losing money then gapping back up to profitability or break even. Now I‚Äôm consistently making money daily. The 80% cash is for when the market turns and I have to develop a new strategy. If everything went stagnant like a normal market does I would lose all my money within 2 months implementing my strategy. It‚Äôs my insurance to evolve my trading strategy based on the times. I still keep logs of my strategies as if it worked once, it will likely work again in the future if circumstances are similar.

I can say what we shouldn't do. We shouldn't go around telling people it is nothing to worry about or take options off the table. You may very well learn in the next few years that you had it, were asymptomatic, and now your lungs permanently function at a lower level than before but you didn't even notice as you are young. You may end up in your 60s on constant O2 supplementation for the rest of your life. 
You aren't going in to get imaging done if you feel fine are you? 
You may be totally fine as well, perhaps even better as you could fend off the next one. Let's just stop pretending we know as we aren't even a year in.
Good on ya. You can also look at it as insurance.  It will give you and her some peace of mind and also allow you to not have to keep such a close eye/ear on news for that stock.

Roper is a holding company, isn't it? They own several technology companies like Spacelabs, etc. From what I know, they have CEO's running each company and mostly the CEOs don't last very long... 

But, I could be wrong and confused with another Roper. Just woke up, and the coffee hasn't reached my brain yet.

Bottomline, the CEO of Vertafore gets fired during/after the investigation.

Betting against the #1 news source for 18 years when they‚Äôre being handed free publicity? The break up with Trump will benefit them IMO. Think of all of the resources and connections and info they have on politicians in general. Some rinky dink Newsmax style outlet would get crushed by Fox. Not only that, they are a staple in cable packages and have local news as well. No way they dont monetize the shit out of this.

I'm a valuation bear. I think there's very little excess return at current levels on a 3-5 year horizon. That said, the MACD positive cross at the zero boundary on the NDX (and SPX) is incredibly bullish.

I had a dream last night that neuralink came out and everyone who got it became these super genius'. They'd all talk to each other without speaking. Share all their thoughts together so they could get smarter. And almost instantly became a giant hivemind. Then quickly came to the conclusion information is the ultimate currency so they started herding everyone who didn't want it into cages so they could force us to get it because they knew once we got it we'd be thankful. After that it was just a long dream of trying to avoid a multi-million person hivemind. I won't be getting neuralink but I'm all in on calls when they release their ipo
Good luck! You‚Äôve got this!

You‚Äôve restated the first half of my point, BOTH of those claims irresponsibly use non-causal metrics to make claims that are worth verifying. They fail to answer legitimate questions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we should stop looking at those questions, it means that we should try to use *relevant* measures *responsibly* and actually try to get to the bottom of whether or not trump or Biden voters contribute more to the economy. And why there‚Äôs so much more crime in heavily democratic areas. Applying the scientific method to social issues is a good thing! We should try to get better at it, which is exactly why I advocate for PLTR leaps!

Where I live, there has been a flurry of people buying homes/new mortgages because of the drop in interest rates since corona. Both buying new places and second housings for rental/investment. I gotta think that this trend will start to reverse when rates increase.

I have SPY puts locked and loaded at cash open.  Expecting Trump lawyer Sidney Powell on election, "I will release the Kraken!".
Yes a vote for Biden is a vote for America to fall.
Friday was a green day. SPY ended at $358. Selling a weekly for 11/20 $365c would net you about a hundred dollars which is about a 0.3% return. If you could do that once a week you could make $5k a year on your $36k investment plus ~$500 in dividends.
This is justice. You entered the arena and it found you wanting.
Nah, you don‚Äôt know shit. I hope you don‚Äôt mind living in a box
Exactly because of that. Most people don‚Äôt even know any company apart from ACB, what happens is when they read or hear any news regarding cannabis legalization, they just FOMO buy the most known cannabis company. Then they get fucked because more experienced traders know this and sell when they made good gains. That‚Äôs what happened with solar companies. SunRun, which is the most overpriced stock, went up way more than its better counterparts like Canadian Solar, just because it‚Äôs the most known

Lots of edgelords want to expose people to the virus but that's not how they do it really. They just get a bunch of people and compare how many cases show up in the vaccine group vs the placebo group. That ends up being a more realistic scenario. Most people aren't getting viruses injected into them in real life.

Kind of.  Ideally they expire 'barely' worthless. If just above $280, he can buy them back Friday PM at par, then sell the following weeks calls at a higher price (or combo higher price plus higher strike), which would leave him even more upside on his Feb calls. The point of my original idea was to spark an idea for OP, so that he could derisk and lock in a killer short-term profit.
One of the easiest chance to make green in March, I means like 80% of stocks go green.

The serious damage from Corona is the result of the body's immune response to the pathogen, not from the pathogen itself. Your folks are probably fine just on a stats basis, but the bad stuff would appear 1 or 2 weeks from initial infection.

There is also the remote possibility of the "extended corona" experience, where mild symptoms last for months.

You're probably fine though.

then how does that ensure the results are accurate? People live in different conditions and some may be higher risk to get the virus depending on where they live, their age and what their job is. Couldn't the safety measures adopted like wearing masks and social distancing artificially inflate the effectiveness of the vaccine in a pure numbers way since less people would get the virus?

Here's the dynamic - say you are manager of Fidelity Select Technology mutual fund.  Your mandate is to invest in technology companies. Right now, IPOB is a SPAC - a shell entity that holds $400MM cash. It is not a technology company (yet). 

Once IPOB combines with Opendoor, it becomes a technology company and trades as such, therefore folks like Fidelity can buy. Note there are a ton of mutual funds focused on innovation, technology, and high growth names, in which Opendoor would fit. 

Many funds like Fidelity will either participate in the PIPE offering or post combination - rarely if ever do they buy SPACs pre-combo because they do not have SPAC mandated mutual funds.

how do vaccine trials work? After injecting a volunteer with a placebo/vaccine do they just tell them to go about their normal lives and just observe the participants if they get sick? Or is it more like they expose them directly to the virus and check if they get sick?
RNA based vaccines cannot be produced at scale, let alone distributed at scale. 

Only Pfizer or Astra Zeneca's approach can actually be manufactured in the millions / billions of units needed.

Not saying the market cares about that, but travel is already up into a range where I don't feel comfortable going long.

Yes but Nio has planned to expand to Europe by next year, this just makes the future of EVs seem brighter.

Margin buys all in one basket could bring you to nothing since you'll owe. An example is if you have $1000 and the margin buy is also $1000, youd get to put up 2k into a stock. If the stock drops say 30% like like the example buy green and sell red, so basically it dropped 35% ($1300 left), you sold. It rose 40%, you bought and then dropped 23% (roughly $1000 left). Penny stocks do this, btw. High gains and losses and very unpredictable if you're not patient. With 1k left, margin requires you to sell off, which means youd be at zero.

I've been hearing this same story since the 28s.
Puts will probly print, but it looks like uptrend for right now and it closed out friday nicely. My calls are weeklies now and down about 60%  plz halp. But, with any positive vaccine news, sbux to ath for sure
Not smart so just asking, what's the rough loss if it trades sideways past 12/4?

Edit: Asking bc might make this my first option bought lol

Idk. I thought about grabbing some calls too. But everyone is expecting them to have great earnings. Unless they just absolutely blow everyone out of the water I think last weeks big run up is pricing in the earnings.

Let‚Äôs see a screenshot big guy.
why though
You're argument is like holding an apple over the ground and then letting go.  But before it stops you say "but has it hit the ground yet??"   No it hasn't hit the ground yet, and obviously the electoral college hasn't put in its decision.  But gravity will continue, and the votes are already in to drive it.
Yeah that's why you oftentimes can't catch companies before they moon.. you have to wait until they moon, buy, then wait for them to go parabolic. Trying to buy bio's before their run-ups is a fools errand, or any stock for that matter but alot of people try to spread their chips between like 10 bio's hoping one will have an insane run, and what do you know? All 10 could be duds.. meanwhile all the time and risk waiting for them to run up could have been earning 10-20% on a high beta blue chip.. usually more but that's conservative.
So what technical does a Benz or BMW surpass Tesla in?

Safety? No.

Reliability? No.

Well you see, you take the IV of the overall indices and when you print out the mantabulator conformation you get a formulaic reciprocity of the entirety of the marketable shares and individual stocks but on a geolocatable basis involving high numbers of quantumly entangled pairs or bi-pairs (sometimes even tri-pairs / hexagonals) that sufficiently produce the desired unmarketable positions and plays involved in artificially intelligent dominant systems.

It's just common sense.

Yes but loose correlations and poorly told stories still provide jumping off points for actual research that has meaning. Your were right, but that still doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not worth looking into the overall claim more and carrying on the conversation, which is relevant. Like all problems though, we will print our way out of it. SLV leaps.

There's a bigger pandemic killing people worldwide everyday.  It claims 3700 lives and is completely preventable -- Automobile accidents.  Let's ban all travel.


Most people who die of COVID are above 70 and have a comorbidity.  99.9%+ of others recover.  Take ya Chinese Plague and you're communist bullshit over to WeChat or whatever tencent is doing nowadays.
Just some good calls in big company could have saved his ass... Dude is an example of a very firm bear. You should have taken a step back and rethink what you were doing.

XOM would disagree, looking pretty bullish as far as momentum goes.
As they said, with the right strike prices/expiration dates it can do well. A clear hole in the strat is if the underlying trades sideways long enough for you to loose a good chunk of premium to theta you might not ever get a decisive enough move in either direction to influence the price of your options.

Um you can live your life AND still wear a mask? And after you recover from COVID, which I did, you can be less strict with the mask, assuming you have no symptoms of Covid/flu, as you can no longer spread it to others as per the CDC. 

Me shouting herd immunity as well is looking at this from a realist approach. The government sent people to die in wars for decades but somehow the idea of letting people die from this virus to achieve herd immunity and save more in the long run is laughable?

You and I relying on each other to combat this is a joke. Especially at this stage. People keep talking about what we could have done in March. March is OVER. This is all we can do now.

Wow. This is a rare bear to LOSE money during the March crash.

I‚Äôd be too worried about being wrong and getting killed if they continue to surge and I don‚Äôt want to own these and sell them covered.

It‚Äôs all Robinhood‚Äôs fault! Otherwise you would be a millionaire by now.
I'm definitely doing okay, I've been fortunate to continue working my day job during the pandemic. I supose the main reason I'm not too bothered by my slight losses is that I have a fairly inconsequential amount of money in the market. About 500USD. While that's a tiny amount here, it's about a quarter of my liquid cash. And also the fact that I'm still up about 18% for the year. I'm really quite new to the market, and I'm enjoying the fact that I'm green for the moment! But even if I lose everything, I'm only 21, there's plenty of time to make it back!

People are so blind to capitalism. You would think the ultra rich don't have enough money to fairly pay their hard working employees while the owner never has to lift a finger the rest of his life but can somehow justify making billions a year. Fairness to the side, how about being decent? What happened to someone working in a factory and being able to have a parent stay at home and own a house and have 2 kids. Now 2 people working in a factory can hardly support 1 child and probably no house, maybe apartment. Oh yea we are headed in the right direction for the goodness of all /s

Common misconception. IV crush happens whenever you buy an option during high times of volatility and then it trades at a lesser volatility. ER results are notorious for IV crush but IV crush isn‚Äôt exclusive to ER results bro.

Astonishing how far the "Big Bad Media" line goes.  My man.  The states have all made public their tallies, Biden is 5,000,000 popular votes ahead.  Put a fork in this one dude.  The media is literally only villainized when anything is negative towards ü•≠.

OP, can we hear more about you and your situation? You clearly posted this for one of two reason, 1) you k ow our degenerate gambling will lead us all down this path and you want to help us, or 2) you just love loss porn, even if it‚Äôs your own. Either way, knowing stuff like age, income level, etc. let‚Äôs me better understand how fucked you are - thanks!
Anyone got shares of CBAT? I loaded up last week. Seems like a good long term investment with EVs becoming so relevant, especially in China.
It's a Trump tweet sentiment tracker.
It‚Äôs not gonna IV crush before earnings, afterwards probably.
So, where do you start? How do you realize, " ok, NIO is going to fucking rise so I should buy calls on this." How do you know when to stop? You could have stopped when NIO touched $30, but you probably kept going.

ExxonMobil stopped in October.
I know having single digit Iq is difficult, but he‚Äôs saying it the same way as ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt go back to alcohol‚Äù.

You know, everyone knows it‚Äôs not the alcohols fault, it‚Äôs the addicts fault, but he‚Äôs just saying he wants to stay away from it because he realized it‚Äôs hurting him.
Yes, Robinhood is definitely the one to blame for you losing $400k in 12 months...
Anyone can use numbers to tell any story they want. That‚Äôs the beauty of them. This 70% is going around a lot today is someone trying to frame a narrative that while factually correct is also extremely misleading. Then sheep like OP spread it.

It‚Äôs similar to gender wage gap. Sure maybe there are differences but when you compare a lawyer salary and a teacher and then tell us their is a gap, you are telling us nothing and possibly sabotaging your own point.

You don‚Äôt think this stock has surged on retail buying too? Or are you saying the two are trying to corner the stock? I personally don‚Äôt subscribe to the idea that anything $ARK buys is a good investment. A bubble will always produce charlatans who look like geniuses on the way up. In fact the indiscriminate buying by ARK of anything going up seems like a positive feedback loop to those stocks and the people who are already bullish than anything fundamental about the stock itself
Or even better. Don't buy fucking options.

No. Im not saying the Dems will fix this bullshit either, but Trump and the GOP had a chance to do any of those things during 2016-2018, but instead they jerked each other off over tax breaks and called it a day lol.

Buy back the calls he sold, then sell new ones for the following week.  In theory, he would lose the upside from the stocks move from $280 up to where the price is on Friday.  However, if he is fortunate for the stock to be at $280+, it would probably make sense to cash a ~one week gain of $40K.
Yes. Until it hits $420.69.
Likely selling to get into different positions in companies that don't rely on a stock buyback for a rally.
Might sound like a broken record here but NIO calls are still the way.

But, nobody has a single electoral college vote yet, do they??

So technically, joe has only won in the eyes of the media!

Cool. Well yes the argument that OP wasn‚Äôt made very well, doesn‚Äôt mean the overall claim they‚Äôre trying to make isn‚Äôt correct.  I was just adding to the conversation that we do see some evidence for his claim, when we look at other figures as well.
google it first before replying. thanks. we may all be audits, but lets at least be adults here and be a little self sufficient.
Wish I bought the dip. Was too busy with other stocks and very limited capital however :(
Theta slows down a ton when your call goes ITM, more so the deeper ITM you are.

If you allow your option to exercise then yeah, you get to buy 100 shares at the strike and will pocket the difference between that and the mark.

You can still lose money on that because you paid a premium to buy the option in the first place. The break even price on RH is actually a useful tool to see that number, and letting you see how silly IV can be with some of those break evens.
Straight up only have less than $1k to play with this week and hope I can get some kind of return out of it for some lunch money. Any "safer" short term calls I can play this week? I was thinking about Walmart, CVS, or PLTR but not really sure!
No there is not other than not holding over night or weekends. Its part of the reason I think trading is so hard, you can always go futures then you have a lot less gaps but make sure you understand it first and start out only trading micros like mini spy or mini russel.
Need some advice on my interviews tmo. Hopefully it goes well

Take a breath dude. As you grow older you‚Äôll realize most people are good and just trying to live there life. The hate is strong with you. Maybe those areas are rural, have low cost of living, big companies don‚Äôt concentrate their businesses there, and the people are happy with a simple life.

Still doesn‚Äôt tell you anything. Geography doesn‚Äôt mean shit cause there is still tons of red and blue people in those places that do contribute to gdp. Why don‚Äôt you look at how workers voted?

No he wouldn‚Äôt pay the tax. The loss would carryover to the next tax year. So if in year 1 he lost $400k, and in each of years 2-5 he had $100k capital gains (or qualified dividends), he would not pay cap gains tax. After he‚Äôs exhausted the $400k carryover amount he would owe capital gains tax again.

What do you think SOLO will be at by the end of the week?
They've been losing money every Q/year for their 17-year history as a company, and yet they continue to exist and expand and win more contracts in more diverse fields. 

Companies like that don't just "exist" for so long without having a good fucking reason they do so. 'Existing' is winning in evolution, surviving is thriving.
You can sell calls against your long call at any point. Ideally, you sell covered calls on up days, but often the market won't cooperate with weekly timing.  For example, the BABA calls I sold for 76 cents last week, expired worthless.  I aim to sell 280s Monday AM and the pricing would obviously be much better if the stock is big ups at open.

I want to believe but I think they‚Äôve gone totally the wrong direction with them. If I were sick, I would trust literally any urgent care place over something called a ‚Äúhealth hub‚Äù that looks like a cell phone store staffed by a single nurse practicioner next to the chips section in a CVS. Even the name sounds like a place where they recommend vitamins to you, not where you go when you‚Äôre sick. 

If they had gone all in and called it ‚Äúcvs urgent care‚Äù or something and broke it off from the retail part of the store with separate door even, I would have hopes for it.

You‚Äôre slowly catching on. WSB is for BETS, Theta Gang is for slow steady income. On a long term scale, Theta Gang will always win. MMs are literally on our side. 

Everything that sucks for you is good for us. Insanely high IV that will crush your profits? Lol, theta gang just made a shit load selling that. Theta ruining the price of your option? Hey, the option is getting cheaper so I can buy it back if I want and still profit bigly. Delta is 20 on your FD? That‚Äôs an 80% chance it‚Äôll be worthless.

Theta Gang and MMs are bros
So you mean they still have money

I've played both JD and BABA since last Summer.  For instance, JD Jan 2022 $110 LEAPS are currently $13ish.  You CAN sell a Nov 20th $100 call for $2.30ish right now.  If the stock goes above $100, you can buy back the weekly call, then sell another call for the following week.  The same premise would apply to purchasing BABA $300+ LEAPS and selling weekly 280s, 285s, 290s.

Why noone talking about Twitter? This is the most undervalued tech company of our time. Great user growth recently and bigger upside potential than any other social media today, by far. Twitter is used by professionals and the primary social media source of many celebrities and highly respected people (it's not just Trump, but yes, our president) and becoming more and more relevant by the day. Twitter is a totally unique social media and people use Twitter for more than just interacting with their friends, it's a source for news, politics, sports, interests and even community. As everything moves more and more online, Twitter has the business model of the future, it is a source for pretty much everything, like Facebook, only 23x less the valuation (as of now).

SNAP and PINS which have a similar mkt cap are up over 200% the past 12 months off relatively minor increased guidance. Meanwhile, Twitter has barely moved outside of its typical range of volatility, though it is on the verge of a breakout which I think will be similar to what we saw with Snap and Pinterest. Aside from user growth, which is bound to explode any time, once they figure out how to optimize their advertising (which is just a mess right now), their revenue will increase exponentially and so will the stock price.

TLDR: YOLOing $500k into TWTR $90-100c 1/2022 leaps because there is very little downside and ridiculous upside in plain sight

Yea but NIO
Lmao all that DD and it closes by saying all the things everyone thinks it is but doesn‚Äôt actually say what it is other than comparing it to people‚Äôs misunderstanding of Tesla which in no way bears resemblance to a bubble stock. I don‚Äôt actually think anyone knows wtf they do they‚Äôre just buying because it‚Äôs a new IPO founded by Peter Thiel so it must go up because so many other stocks have 5x‚Äôd in the past year. That‚Äôs the definition of a bubble and why I‚Äôm so convinced this entire growth trade is about to crash and burn
Whether it‚Äôs Tesla, Nio, Xpeng or any other EV manufacturer, they all announce deliveries the first few days after the quarter ends. What‚Äôs important about ERs is they show profitability, and reflect operational efficiency through cost reductions. Additionally these companies tend to give forward looking guidance towards next year and set new goals.

The potential market for biodegradeable plastic is huge. Go into your supermarket and look how many items you can buy that are NOT in a plastic packaging. Look at the last 10 things you bought and look how many of them are 100% steel/ceramic/wood... I bet 0 of them.

With fossil fuels on the decline the price per barrel of oil goes up and thus the price of plastic. In an utopian future we'll have stopped using this environment polluting shit in 10 years.

Institutional ownership of TSLA is 45%. In PLTR they couldn't buy stocks because it was a direct listing. So they'll have to buy from retail investors because employees can't sell again either until the end of December. So we are sitting on 8% ownership now. An uptick to 20% which is very conservative in the short term will mean a lot to the stock price.

A good suggestion might be Royal Dutch Shell ( AMS:RDSA). Its down 60%, currently trading at ‚Ç¨13.15, coming from a low of ‚Ç¨10.07 (28th of Oct). It turned a profit last quarter and raised its dividend (4%). It had a record loss of $18 billion, in the second quarter but turned a profit of $489 million in the third ( much higher than the $146 million analysts were counting on). Its trying to reduce its overall losses of $77,8 billion to $65 billion. If successful, Shell will pay out 20% to 30% of its operation cashflow to its shareholders. Furthermore, Shell is doubling down on its investments in Green energy from 11% to 25% of its total investment budget. In conclusion, its one for the long haul, but worth a look! Good luck

Just because the mortality rate is higher doesn't mean the long-term effects are also worse, although it might seem logical. All of the long-term effects you mentioned are also long-term effects of the flu, there is 0 evidence to suggest the long-term effects from this virus are any worse.

These are in obvious bubble territory only question is when does the crash come? I was on here last weekend saying we hit euphoric levels the previous Friday and then they crashed Monday. But to me that surge in the week is a bear market rally and there‚Äôs a lot more pain ahead for this entire trade so a solid setup for short/put entry.

Does his shares get sold and he gets the difference between strike price and higher price? I'm confused because some options calculators show losses even though at expiry share price is above strike price...

Lemme go find the model number samsung  I just got. Maybe you would like it. 65 inch samsung model UN65RU8000FXZA. Check that one out massively better refresh rate compared to 2020 model in the TU range and it has far better colors and color optimization hardware then the newer model. This is a 65 inch tv just FYI. 

The wife takes me to find the best tv for under 900 and I landed on this one finally after about 2 months of researching. It's replacing a TCL 65 inch roku that had it's led backlight  array die after 11 months. Our previous samsung 40 inch from YEARS ago is still running strong in our game room after about 4 years which is why I opted for samsung instead of a lg or don't model. Hope this helps.

Stocks are a different beast.

Nio was hot last week, I was seeing crazy call volume before it went up.
It would be dumb for brokers to counter that.

This kind of stuff happens for less known stocks, forex, commodities.

If you are holding stocks long term at least over 3 month then most probably stocks will go up eventually. But your money is tied to those stocks.
Just buy shares like the rest of the plebs
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for but also hoping for a break out some time soon if not might sell and reposition for more time.
In the long term mkts do/will go up, but atp I think mkts need a technical correction before making more significant gains
It's unlikely this virus causes more serious long-term damage than the flu.
Can we start the final round yet, I don‚Äôt care about Goldie Hawn
Because the only real corrections we've had have been really small dips (when you look at the bigger picture) that didn't last longer than a day, and yeah Nio is taking China by storm but  1) they're not selling enough cars yet 2) haven't yet expanded from its native market 3) they dont yet have many affordable options compared to Tesla. All of these things will come to fruition long term but for now no

Try picking up gardening. Building a garden from scratch with your own hands is hard work, but some of the most satisfying and fulfilling work you could ever do. Being able to see the fruits of your labor everyday and to improve upon it is rewarding.

Additionally, pick a couple of days a week where you go do volunteering work. You will be helping people, meeting great friends, and can be proud of how you are spending your time. 

Since you don't have to worry about money, use that rare freedom to enjoy the simpler things in life. Visit the National Parks.

I can appreciate the optimism, but if you lived in Rochester and knew the condition of Kodak's fixed assets infrastructure, you would not have made this bet.  Granted the assets have been nearly 100% written off, which avoids future impairment expenses, but they are in no condition to be repurposed for clean room / good manufacturing practice purposes. It would take hundreds of millions to make Kodak's film business produce again, let a lone pharmaceuticals.

Moreover, Eastman Chemical, a business that Kodak spin off years and years ago, is in Tennessee. They would have a chance at doing pharma chemistry, but Kodak Rochester does not.

Good luck.

It is very hard to do most of the one I know were already worth a few millions when they turned 18. Also their parents limited the way they could interact with their account.

However, its unhealthy for a stock to rise this much with little to no consolidation. I feel like even if the earnings are amazing it still wont justify their sudden spike in stock value.

I personally am also looking to go long on baba, on many of the same reasons as you mentioned, however i am thinking there will be another leg down in the coming weeks and then i can get even better entry. 

Good luck OP!
Glad to hear that

That's factually incorrect
Wow... I had like a year of deference, and I was paying $115 usd a month on a 18k loan. I refinanced it at 3.5% and my payments then became $85 a month. I took a long time paying it off since it was better to use the money in other ways. There are a lot of programs, but you have to look for them. I remember back in like 2006 someone called and asked me if I wanted to refinance with a private loan for "only" 6%.. I said, I'm paying 4%... She said it was a great deal she was offering... I laughed and hung up.... Some people don't know how to count..
Yeah Aurora fucked me, I could've had 20k or so but I decided to hold like a dumbass, hoping some miracle happens where I'll go positive.

This is true and believing what worked before will work again. It doesn't work that way in the market. 

Also believing your losses will eventually turn green is one I'm guilty of as well. Sometimes you have to take a lose and just be ok with it. Even if it moons after you sold at a loss.
Yeah on WSB i think 10m must have been the most I saw. I think really wealthy people don't use robinhood with a high percentage of their net worth haha

I could not agree more...hence my recommendation for long dated, very close to money call contracts. After all, options is legalized gambling. May as well increase your odds knowing that Chinese stocks (sans 2-3 Chinese meme stocks) generally don't move up like crazy and is rather a very gradual climb.

On their call they mentioned battery shortage that would prevent immediate scaling. The question is really, are they going to do it in house or is their another company that the others will buy from including XPEV.

Given the Chinese government mandate to move to EVs, I think it‚Äôs going to happen much sooner than we all think.

I'm going to get some BABA calls monday as well.

To me, this puts the antitrust action in perspective; they weren't doing it to fuck over Ma, they were doing it to create the appearance of due diligence of regulating their own monopolies to finish the RCEP negotiations. At least that's my read on the situation and it makes more sense than the PRC destroying one of their own most profitable companies because of a grudge.

Too many gaps below us, on top of probable pending lockdowns looming.  Makes perfect sense we go back to the bottom of this channel/wedge were in, filling the gaps along the way.
You give good advice but then go 80% cash to try and time the market, which historically has proven to be a really bad idea in general.  Don't you think this is at odds with your own advice?

So I read the citron report. Citron said the cap can never be justified. Mercedes sells 1 million cars a month while nio sells 6k a month with 2/3s the market cap. Honestly very bullish, says it‚Äôs only worth anything cuz traders like to see it move up and down.

Yah, I think investors know now what we‚Äôre getting into and won‚Äôt panic so much as to cause a market crash.  BUT the air gaps sitting below us from the election run up are sure to be filled.
This is the worry for me. The market will go straight up until Biden *mentions* locking down, then I'm gonna lose all my gains if I'm not out already

Keep dreaming, you autistic maggot. The Supreme Court didn‚Äôt rule on the 2000 election shenanigans in Florida until December.

It will be some weeks before you see those kind of headlines. So go long on popcorn king Reddinbacher because we‚Äôll be watching this shitshow for a while.

1. So many logical fallacies. 2. I'm gonna ignore the political bs you're spinning and jump to where you actually address my question. 

Masks HAVE def been proven to reduce the spread of covid...literally go to the WHO website and see for yourself. 

>If masks were 100% effective why would we need lockdowns? If lockdowns were effective, why the vaccines?

I don't even know where to start on this lol. Masks aren't 100% effective but they do help reduce the spread. Again check WHO. Lockdowns are effective at reducing the spread...idk what you're on dude, but ill explain it in simple terms. If people are interacting with each other less, then there are less chances to spread the disease. Lmk if that makes sense. Neither of these 2 things in tandem can get rid of covid...that's where vaccines can HELP. I'll also explain that vaccines aren't cures. Just because we have a vaccine for smallpox doesn't mean smallpox doesn't exist somewhere in the world. The vaccine will help us build up herd immunity to the point where people that can't get the vaccine (due to adverse reactions along with the few sad misinformed antivaxxers) will be further protected from catching it. Lmk if I need to elaborate on any of these points.

Still takes years to scale up and make battery factories to lower costs etc. they still ten years away from Tesla. They have to rely on other manufacturers to make their product.

Lifecycle funds fucking suck. They put your money in the F and G fund because the morons running that shit show have to include them. The F fund is garbage and the G fund keeps up with inflation.

Well firstly if you want to "risk" your life going to a Trump BLM rally or some shit that's your choice. Less people (millions) would also die if the government banned tobacco, alcohol, driving over 30 mph, guns, so should they? Secondly the masks don't 100% prevent the transmission of COVID, the science has never suggested that it does, there are some estimates of reduced risk of transmission but that's all. If masks were 100% effective why would we need lockdowns? If lockdowns were effective, why the vaccines?
I wonder what kind of real estate they own? With a lot of people working from home you can move the company HQ to an out of business we work and turn the cool ok‚Äôd buildings into lofts and apartments.

That legalese is standard for any political contribution. I believe the show is over for Trump and he knows that deep inside but his poor character will not allow him to acquiesce, do what‚Äôs best for the nation, and go quietly. He will find a way to eff something up on the way out to make the transition difficult for Biden. And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that whatever he does to challenge the election or ‚Äúmake a last stand‚Äù adds significant uncertainty to the markets and down we go. That also coupled with shutdowns due to Covid make this a precarious time to think that the rally we saw last week on the market reflects reality. I hope you have cash (to take advantage of the opportunities that are coming after) and are not trading on margin. After 3 months on margin in finally off due to last week‚Äôs pump.

Exactly this. Sure, use stop loss orders if you‚Äôre OK paying capital gains tax every time the stock rises then dips. Just buy it, hold it, and rake in the dividends later in life; sell when you think the stock is overvalued or you have much better alternative investment.

I didn‚Äôt say they were profitable. But it‚Äôs clear based on their earnings it‚Äôs heading in the right direction fast. The difference I think people miss about comparing Tesla and the other EV companies is Tesla spent a lot of time in R&D.

The advantages that the new EV manufactures have is they have access to Tesla‚Äôs patents which they don‚Äôt need to spend much time in R&D for a viable product.

IMO anyways

If you manage to stay on at least for ups I know that their part time benefits are on par with most people's full time benefits if not better.

Combine that with them used to being up at 3 am and working hard till 7 to 9. One of the few jobs I realized that old farts had a real racket going. I miss that coverage.

Totally agree - it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúhidden‚Äù commission. If you‚Äôve tried trading spreads on both RH and TD, you‚Äôll know the difference. You can usually put in the mid price of the bid/ask spread and will typically get filled on TD. RH? Not likely.

There is definitely some merit to the idea that short attacks like Citron‚Äôs should be illegal. Unless a company is completely fraudulent (Nikola), then i can get behind it. But making a debatable claim about a company‚Äôs value to boost your position is pure manipulation. The same can be said about banks upgrading stocks, but this has the effect of building and spreading wealth since longs usually outnumber shorts. Upgrades also usually cause a smaller change, allowing shorts to exit without incurring huge losses. The short attacks, on the other hand, rely on fear to induce panic selling to extract wealth from the majority.

Man pennystonks is bogus
So uvxy holds super short term vix contracts with 1.5x leverage (ie if the vix spikes uvxy really spikes)

So the best time to buy uvxy calls is when you think 2 things are true: 1 the market will have a quick pull back and 2 most people don‚Äôt expect it. The second part is key because if the vix is already elevated equally over the next few weeks (bc people are worried about a drop) then uvxy won‚Äôt really spike

The opposite is true of puts. If you think everyone expects a huge drop but it won‚Äôt be as bad you buy puts because as soon as the event everyone feared passes the avg contract value in the next 3 weeks will plummet. This is what happened after the election when we didn‚Äôt dissolve into civil war

TLDR buy uvxy leaps or shares at the peak of a bull market and then sell calls against them whenever it spikes cuz it won‚Äôt stay up for long

not being able to walk or stand more than an hour a day means you will have to get a sitting job since most, if not all, standing/walking jobs last longer than an hour. maybe consider a driving job of some sort where you interact with people a lot, but you still can sit in your vehicle and drive most the day. something like a driver for a limo company, or a delivery service of some sort. lots of driving jobs out there if you get your CDL and they would fit all your requirements.

How do you lose money on long legs? The calls that you sell are closer ITM than the calls you purchase, yielding a net credit. The only "long leg" that we have here is the shares.

I think that you think that sounded smart and I think that you should rethink that.
IPOB - the SPAC - has 4 employees, which is typical. A SPAC is set up as a shell company to go buy another company and take it public, and typically takes a team of 3-4 to make that happen. Opendoor (the target company) has thousands of employees.

Manipulation is Real with this one. Doesnt trade 1:1 with Spot VIX price movements.

Meant as a short-term hedge for institutional traders. Meant to be held for a day or two at the most.
There are many different factors at play here for RKT - here is how I see it.

Vaccine/COVID getting better = bad for RKT
1) interest rates will start to go up = less people thinking about buying a house and getting a new mortgage (this is the big one) 
2) trend toward digital starts to revert a bit

Vaccine/COVID getting better = good for RKT
1) financial health improving = more mortgages (yes but to a lesser extent probably than interest rates)
2) higher interest rates = RKT makes more money on existing mortgages

Not sure which bucket outweighs the other...but given the massive cash the company is making now, I would lean towards vaccine being more on the bad side

I am also invested in RKT fwiw

Because it is a pre-merger SPAC - it is not yet "Opendoor" but will be when the combination is complete in December most likely

Yes. You limit your losses but you also limit your gains.

Amen.
Says in the caption he bought hundreds of different put options and lost it all lol. He just shotgun blasted his money into random shit.
Thanks for the heads up. Very reasonable.
No, but wearing a mask has been proven to reduce the spread. IK ppl have reasons, but I'm saying they aren't rational at all. If anything they are selfish. "Only .02% death rate, I'm young and healthy I'll be fine, it's hard to breathe, my glasses fog up" etc...and a lot of ppl will believe in conspiracy theories about how it isn't real which I'm not even gonna comment on. 

I don't get off to wearing a mask. It sucks, but if everyone did it and listened to the vast majority of scientists all over the world, less ppl would die and we wouldn't be getting another wave of lockdowns

Morning, fellas. Rumor has it Illinois will get the ol‚Äô lockdown by Tuesday. 2nd 3rd and 4th waves may be priced in but if states starts falling down over the week, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be so bigly green.
Right? Lol this is a new one...
 ÿ£ŸÑŸÖÿ≥ ŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿä ŸäŸàŸÖŸäÿß
Ah you‚Äôre right, no idea then
This is just bragging. Fuck off.
Just a heads up, a TON of Mormon churches across the united states and world are approved to use Zoom to broadcast their religious services on Sundays. This is going to be a big increase to zooms traffic. mormons are a pretty sizeable chunk of people. not to mention all the other churches besides mormons who are using zoom. basically what im saying is buy zoom before it runs away into the 500-600-700 territory by mid-late winter. their revenue and numbers for Q4 are going to be astounding.
Most (real) brokerages will execute orders outside of normal trading hours but you have to check.

1.6% tax is probably on your net worth regardless of gains or loss. That‚Äôs how it could be worse if I have to guess.
Lol you bought a short dated call on a fairly low liquidity stock that is overvalued with a 1yr price target of 43. Word, son.
It was trading at 48 the day prior to the news drop... Do you really think a 7 dollar pump premarket and then an equal drop after the news is coincidence?

Hedge funds disclosed their 13f‚Äôs on friday bc that was the SEC deadline. If you read the 13F, it just shows the position they held as of that date and its value- it would seem many hedge funds have bought in positions earlier than the most recent run up to $40.

That word, I do not think you know what it means.

I think you meant to say "this reads like someone's opinion".
On the information page it says:

["There is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its stated investment objective."] (https://www.direxion.com/product/moonshot-innovators-etf)
Correct. Have to use limit orders. And options simply don't trade at all. All you can do is set a virtual stop by monitoring the price constantly and if it drops to that put in a limit order at the bid price or slightly less so you know it will execute.
It does seem like a pretty complex process. To be honest I don't know if the battery switch would work massively. Maybe it'll remain a niche service in only a few locations? Otherwise just charge the vehicles like any other ev?
At what point can you notice additional comfort?  I drove my car for 36 hours straight, was comfortable the entire time.  There's this belief that BMW / Merc are great cars -- they aren't that wonderful, especially past a certain mileage.  A better "trim" or a fancy clock in your car adds zero to comfort, and adds nothing to the gym experience.  I drove an m5 for a few years, id take the equivalent years model s everyday of the week.  

Then again,most people who post about the Euro car makers vs Tesla haven't owned both.

Its pretty hard to predict vxx or uvxy. They are designed to bleed value. But vxx is a derivative of spy options. It is equal to the move implied by the calls/puts bought on spy. So if vxx is 20, traders expect a 20% move either direction. Powerfully unpredictable shit but i guess it does have support levels and if u have calls at the right time, u rich. I lost bout 6k playing vxx tho. Im out

Sell action was unwarranted as info used in the hit piece was cherry-picked to further Andy's agenda for the day. He played on noobs involvement with the stock and their anxiety for price swings especially those in 0dte calls. If you go back in the messages on the forum you'll see a dramatic uptick in Bear posts for NIO on Thursday. No mention of XPEV or LI which are smaller players that ran exponentially more. Coincidence? Doubt it. Why short before ER when if his thesis is correct would Net him more Downside profits by letting it run further Friday and Monday? He had a sizeable position in 0dte Puts for 11/13. I dont doubt he went Long for ER now. 

My thesis is EVs are the new Tech Revolution with Deadlines already in place by China and 1st World countries for emission control. This runs Hard from here on out.

NIO $200 EOM.

https://texasweedsyndicate.com/edibles-recipes/cannabis-lollipops/. This is the recipe I used to start making edibles. Yeah it's sugar but if your stopping the alcohol it helps plus depending on the mold you use(https://www.hobbylobby.com/Party-Baking/Baking-Supplies/Candy-Making/Hexagons-Break-Apart-Candy-Mold/p/46364) this is the mold I used to mine. The small size ment I could take a pack of ten with me and eat them throughout the day to help with the withdrawal symptoms and never get too fucked up. I made my extractions using shake and ran 3.5grams of product per batch. If your using the alcohol quick wash method for thc extraction you can get 3 runs out of each batch with each run being slightly less strong then the previous. I used to use a coffee warmer to cook off the alcohol but have found that in the fridge for a few days does the same thing without having to expose the tincture to excess heat which can turn your precious thc molecules into thc-a making it more sedative. Takes some working with and experimenting but I bet you can get it down. Best wishes homie.

One of them but this is the easiest one.

Imagine you have a coin for up and down spx for today. You clearly have an opinion on the direction which is mostly true. So you can tape one side (the opposite youre want to bet on) of the coin and flip it 100 times. Then make an average and bet on the result.

You do that all the time and apply the double strategy. But on the free market you have the option to also double your leverage so you will have a huge numbers of tries which makes its impossible to hit on the wrong side.

So Germany might have restrictions for 4-5 months says Economy Minister. That must put pressure on Dax. People will have less to put in stocks and are in more need of cash. So, bullish I guess.

Who still remembers all the Stimulus doom and gloom in CNBC by people like Cramer? I am surprised no one has called them out on the that. We almost had Q without it and no one of their predictions came true. 

Can we accept the fact that consumer spending & savings increased not because of first stimulus bill but because people aren‚Äôt traveling for work and aren‚Äôt going on vacations. Couple that people savings thanks to refinancing due to lower rates and people taking advantage of rent deferral (yes bad for landlords but that‚Äôs different story). One of reasons to be bullish on economy as long as we don‚Äôt have lockdowns.

It‚Äôs about viral load. Mask reduces spread and protects you too. You‚Äôll interact with the virus but so long as it‚Äôs minimal quantity, people will survive. If you come in contact with large quantity of it, you will get wrecked. 

Also, hospitals over flowing is a real issue. We have some of the best hospital in the world so we can treat people. But once we are over capacity, deaths will sky rocket.

Jesus fuck man benzos to help the withdrawal. I mean I know they do this in medical setting but both or harsh. My self cute for cutting alcohol just over a year ago was to burn through about a half ounce of weed a week to stabilize and slow down any alcohol withdrawal systems cause I was over 1liter of booze a day. Then I switched to edibles to deal with working times snd after a couple months I kicked the edibles and weed habit and went clean. Watch out for the sugar cravings cause they come on HARD from the sugar alcohol's. Best of luck chief.

Yeah man its true. A guy wanted to trade in about 15 games and the manager offered him like $25 for all of them. There were some fairly new games in the pile too. I offered the guy $40. The manager got mad and told me if you want to make a deal go outside we dont do that here.

The guy was upset so he didnt take the offer. I went back and talked with the manager and he explained why he was upset. How they lowball trade-ins cause they need the mark up to make money, and they get a performance score every month or quarter.

He told me they have no margin on New games, consoles, accessories. All of Gamestops profit is in used/trade-ins, toys and stuff like that.

As an ex car salesman I know this profit margin stuff is true  cause we sold brand new Tahoes, and Camaros for MSRP and made a "mini"(Minimum commission of $100) on every new vehicle. All your money is in used cars, unless you can sell a shit ton new cars and get a payout from the manufacturer for good performance.

I had TD and RH both for a while and the order changing process on RH drove me insane. So slow and not transparent. on TD all your opening or closing orders not filled are sitting there in front of you.. you can see the b/a in real time and adjust your order in like less than a second. The interface takes getting used to but the learning is very quick. 

Is the UI as good as RH? No. Is the overall experience better if you want to trade, in my opinion yes.

Fundamental analysis on the same price basis is just funny. Chinese companies will always be discounted based on the geopolitical risk factors perceived by international investors.
Why do we need more men in nursing?
Their earnings was double the loss. Their revenue was higher. Big difference. Considering it still took TSLA like 6 years to finally be profitable and they had gigafactory to reduce battery costs and other vertical integration things that NIO has none of, this is not going to be the case.

NIO... Citron sold NIO Early back at $7 then watched it run all the way to $54. He thought LI would flub ER, ride EVs down on sympathy and get LONG NIO at a lower price. LI rocked higher and he had to save his position so he dropped the Hit piece. He did this in the past to TSLA as well.

Sleezy salty dude wanted in NIO before ER at lower prices. This was made obvious as he only went after NIO days before ER which makes no sense. If he felt strongly against NIO why not wait till they give you more ammo on the ER CC and have ALL the facts in HAND? Welcome to Wall ST Sleezeball shit.

If a person who buys at bottom would hold out on everything, he would be bankrupt 10 times over.

That is a lesson you learn in that market, i have been plus $6000 and then minus $4000 in span of 3 minutes. Take the fucking win and run.

One out of thousands of companies having a huge run is not a metric for anything, you gotta go for strategy that earns you money with those 1000 companies together, not with the one that run 2400% and only after that the whole wsb bought it or started playing it and cried last week when they lost thousands of $ on pullback.

Not to talk about that almost nobody has those thousands of companies on radar, they only become interesting for mainstream after they run up hugely, nobody here is showing any interest in thousands of companies that will run up in future, thousands of companies that will go bankrupt and get delisted.
You can recover from that. You still have at least 30 years to make that back with $5 an hour at local McDonalds.

Looks like the inverse of NIO lmao
With this amount of money I would have just bought a ton of stocks instead, what a waste.
One thing I'd like to add: the reason why I said October $265 calls is because look at BABA all time chart. It doesn't move like AMZN or other FAANG stocks. P/E is 28-ish which is ridiculously low for a tech stock like BABA. People are saying it's criminal and that eventually the P/E will rise considerably. I don't agree with that only because at the end of the day, it's a Chinese stock and will therefore always be discounted. I've seen one year price targets for BABA between $450-700. This is **highly** unlikely. The business will continue to grow massively but I don't think the stock price follows as fast. If the stock price drops to $250 next week, buy calls far out as close to the current price as possible. Even if the contracts are expensive, you're very likely to hit on them even if you have to wait until expiration. BABA should be back to $300 in a year, but I think the max is $350. I just don't see it higher than that. So why take the risk of buying a $300 call option (breakeven of $326.90) for $2,690 when you can buy the $265 call option for $4,140 (with a breakeven of $307.11), you know?

Dude you want to know what's crazy, back when phones first started having camera's on them en-mass, people would freak the fuck out from you taking pictures at a party on it. Like get in fights and destroy your phone level shit. Everyone was afraid of something getting posted online that ties them to a negative stigma or out getting drunk or looking high. 
Now people willingly and freely post about that like it's a badge of honor and share even the stupidest shit for everyone to see. It's kinda wild how far we have come. That fear you feel those was palpitable back in the day. Just remember that post 9/11 and the patriot act, the big alphabet groups are always listening.

Should have saved your game more often
10 yards is 9.14 meters
It was her boyfriend's setup. He made a good trade, once, except It went in the wrong direction too. Since then he's had a bad run. 

Your $160...

$30 tip to CJ. Strippers always overtip. He's an Uber driver, allegedly,, but mostly runs errands for strippers and sells $40 bags of meth, Xanax, DMT, and coke for the day shift girls.  They are pre-packaged in waffle house napkins with  10 yards of scotch tape around each one. He delivers obviously and has OCD (which explains the tape He puts your initials on the napkin before taping it. Every time. On the upside, he'll pick up anything else you need on the way. A cat with no name lives in his car.

$CJ gets all but $20 of the $160. Boyfriend got $40 of meth, but she doesn't know about that. He'll 3 card monte it away between the $15 for the half Gallon of Taaka vodka, $12 for two packs of American Spirits, $4 for butane, $8 for a 12 pack of Mountain Dew (CVS is pricey on the Dew), $5 for five cans of Pedigree (the dog was out with the boyfriend, who was meeting CJ in the parking lot while he smoked the last American Spirit and had to duck under the stars because a fat kid on a 3-year-old knock off electric Razr scooter sounds like the leasing office golf cart, and there have been issues. I forgot what else was on the CVS list. Some hair gel maybe, Can of pistachios. unshelled/ Listerine. 18 pack of Condoms - the assorted pack., self-tanner - the mist not the lotion.

Anyway, with $20 leftover and $10 he still had from that morning, he's got $27 to trade on ($3 to load the Vanilla Visa. They don't use the other cards because they heard the feds now run them. Also Metro PCS and Cricket. Or the Bush Family. Or Bob Saget. Somebody anyway). He bought 11/20 GM puts. They won't print, of course

It's a grind, but she's still got two or three regulars she sees twice a month for $400 per, and one gay she's been seeing for a decade, every third Tuesday, for $1k. Doesn't even do anything weird, He pushes a two-tone early 2000's Buick with Elks Lodge and VFW stickers all over the back window. That's what paid for the flat screen. 

Boyfriend is using TradingView now but he jumps around PC platforms because somebody always has a 3-month trial deal. The two of them have enough runway in front of them to have more good days than bad. They've bounced back from zero a hundred times before. A hard zero. Getting out of the county with shorts and a yellowed T that's been in a paper bag for three months zero. In November. With a broken flip flop,.

'Course that's mostly speculation.  Just ask any 48-year-old GenX autist. There were lots of them in 1999.

Happy Sunday!!!!!

BABA 300 EOW
Corbion

biodegradeable plastic is the future
China approved and announced 3 days ago üá®üá≥
Honestly? I think BABA opens green pretty sizably on Monday because of this deal...but because of regulations and CCP bullshit it will continue to fall until that's resolved (i.e. the rest of the week it probably tanks). If you're holding short dated calls on BABA, I'd take profits on Monday if there are any. I think the whole week it will be a bloodbath for BABA (unfortunately). This is coming from someone who holds 120 shares at around $265. I plan on selling if there's a big green open and re-entering if it dips below $250. I also bought a few long dated contracts and will load up on those later in the week. If you want to be safe? Buy the October 15 2021 $265 calls.
I think you are a really really sad and lonely person.
That‚Äôs just where the gap is man. I‚Äôd imagine i‚Äôll start buying in the low 30‚Äôs if it gets there. Maybe a small starter at $32

We'll have futures tonight, the premarket and the morning rush, and by then the prices will be updated to the current situation, so unless the situation worsens more than what we're expecting by 10am, the damage will be done and we'll be more likely to start rising again as people stop exiting and reenter. It's bad if you have existing positions but great if you need an entry

Short term it should really help BABA. Long term? I think BABA is so big that they'll still benefit from this but this deal will also bring more foreign competition. That doesn't mean BABA will fall; just means less market share **long term**. How I translate it? BABA will go up short term very much (barring insane regulations that specifically hurt BABA...unlikely)...long term BABA will continue to outperform but revenue and profits won't increase as much as they could have before this deal. Will still be up because of free trade with other nations but other companies will enter as well.

Reminds me of a chapter in Reminiscences of a Stock Operator where Livermore talks about traders trying to make enough money in the market to buy a coat. No one ever got enough to buy it. I think the lesson was that they were too focused on trying to gain a certain amount of money that they lost sight of when to sell, or if a trade was good or not. Read it, it‚Äôs a good book and you‚Äôll probably see some of yourself in it.
Someone is specifically running up the Dow futures to spook me out of my puts at open, not falling for this, I saw circuit breakers set in and freeze the price for 6 hours last night.  In my opinion this pump is fake and MMs want to try to pull a fast one, hold steady for the real circuit breakers.

With 400k you can already live by capital gains without taking much risk, it makes absolutely no sense to take a lot of risk if you already got that much capital. Completely unnecessary.
But you could invest in something else that in not tied to the spx. It makes no sense to sit on the usd while mr pow is printing dollars.

I have about $600k in cash and about $200k in a few stock accounts and I put away $5,000 per month into QQQ and other tech names.  I‚Äôm hoping I can grow that to $5-7M as well 

If things go well we should have about $20M at retirement 

I should inherit approx $8m in stocks and real estate from my parents and my wife should inherit $8-10M from her parents in stocks and real estate.

Yeah I guess that is true. I'm interested in meat replacements because I am concerned about long term environmental impact of continued beef farming. But I grew up in Australia so beef is a big part of my diet...

I think long term these meat replacements will definitely have legs it's just hard to predict when it's going to take off.

Sure it sounds extreme but there are so many layers to this problem. 

What's her mother doing in an elderly home? Why bring her out of the elderly home now of all times?

Considering how the elderly are the most vulnerable to the disease, I would gather that just visiting them in the nursing home exposes them to disproportionate risks, not just to her mother but the other old folks there too. It seems draconian but who should be liable if the other nursing home folks get COVID? 

it'll just spiral into a sob story about how she wanted to see her mom and she didn't think it would be so serious.

In seriousness, DO NOT trade with money you can't lose. Just check loss posts in this sub, people losing hundred grands and more is common here, if you cant risk your money, don't come to trading. You will panic sell anyway once it goes red and that is a loss.

The SL is already at it's bottom, I bought in right before the 8% drop expecting their 11/11 earning would boost them up. Shit happens, I averaged it out a bit but I'm not ready to lose it all cuz my next 3 month's rent is in there. Again, cuz I tried to averaged it out before it cliffed. Average positions are now 280.

Come again say what
As old mate said, you can only lose your premium if you BUY options. Suggest jumping in with some small shit, you could get a cheap stock (under $50) option a month out for like a hundred bucks just to see how it works. You can read all about Greeks and shit, but watching how an option's price change as the underlying, time and IV all move around is a great  way to learn.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about Navy Seal copypastas, you little newfag? I‚Äôll have you know Navy Seal copypastas are ranked top out of all the comments on the Internet, and they have been translated in numerous contexts on 4chan, and have over 300 confirmed variants. Navy Seal copypastas are trained in memetic warfare and are the top copypasta in the entire circlejerk arsenel. You are nothing to them but just another target. They will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this subreddit, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit about Navy Seal copypastas over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak this copypasta is contacting it's secret network of /b/tards across the USA and your IP is being doxxed right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. Navy Seal copypastas can be anywhere, anytime, and they can confuse you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with mad-lib permutations. Not only are they extensively trained in trolling, but they have access to the entire arsenal of Anonymous and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Internet, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. This copypasta will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

I think a lot of these EV stocks are skyrocketing because Toyota doesn‚Äôt even have any plans for a public EV as soon as they realize it‚Äôs a need for their business they will buy out stocks with their brand cuz who honestly wants to drive with a lordstown brand truck.

Edit that was meant for the gen thread but whatevs
Based on my statistics of the replies, wsb thinks its gonna moon. I have December calls.
that "Don't repeat past mistakes" feels a lot like "stop hitting yourself" admonishments I received as a younger brother.
While this is good for BABA (and all Chinese stocks, but especially trade heavy ecommerce ones) it's unlikely to materially affect the price of BABA immediately due to continuing bad sentiment for now.

TLDR: trade agreement good, BABA go up but not until people forget bad month

$240 is possible, it's worst case scenario pretty much but entirely possible. I would probably cancel your SL and hold, any drop will be short lived so as long as you don't need that money for the next few months it will come back.
I‚Äôll give 2 cents as someone in a senior role at a large company in charge of making decisions about data analytics enterprise software. 

Palantir is the shit. Their model deals with a problem that most B2B companies aren‚Äôt willing to deal with - the fact that data frameworks don‚Äôt seamlessly transition between products and industries, making out of box solutions require expensive and slow retooling to fit your company‚Äôs needs. Palantir‚Äôs services are 80% out of box, with the last 20% finished by ‚Äúforward deployed experts‚Äù that spend time onsite with the client to make sure the analytics they provide are actually usable for the client‚Äôs use case. They‚Äôve gotten really good at this and I‚Äôm super bullish that they can take a big chunk of their 150 billion analytics SaaS market in the next few years. Not to mention they‚Äôve developed expertise working with the Department of Defense, CIA and others so their people tend to know what they‚Äôre doing. 

I have about 4000 shares.
From youtube and I know a guy lol
Been all in on Niu since stock price was about 16. I have wondered why they are not getting more traction (don‚Äôt get me wrong, almost doubled my money by holding shares in 4 month‚Äôs) but these guys are absolutely brilliant. Their scooters are starting to pop up all over Europe with these sharing services, and on the 23rd they are going to slam their earnings. Current price is 30 ish, but market cap can definitely grow another 2-4 times in the short term. Get aboard fast though, because we are on the launchpad ready to be blasted into orbit.

I call my neighbours dog thot. It's a female though, so no homo.
Problem is. Yes, scientifically masks block covid but it only works if you wear it 24x7. Media tells people to wear the mask when they "go outside" which it doesn't exactly spread in the air outdoors. drrr. You'd have to wear the mask indoors 24x7, which ain't gonna happen. That's why it spreads, people take them off indoors. So, it's pointless. Study from CDC showed 70% of the infected people "always" wore their mask. Problem is wearing a mask don't protect you. It's only the sick people who need masks to block covid. The whole point is it will never work cause people ain't wearing it 24x7 on the off chance they have covid and might spread it.
Lol no they don't. There's countless thousands of repatriated Chinese nationals they don't go after because it would take more resources than its worth. They are just trying to build the same psychology the CIA did back in the day. "an agent in every city, contact in every alley" octopus type shit when the reality is there is no agency with global omniscience.
sorry, I'm just frustrated because I'm an American and our response has been piss-poor for what is supposedly a highly developed country. 

Also reading people reference the high survival rate is also very frustrating. You can survive a stroke, or even heart disease, but is that something you really want? would you want others to suffer when you can potentially prevent such outcomes by practicing mask usage and distancing? 

We can make educated guesses as to the long term complications for a variety of reasons. Other SARS viruses have been known to have lung and heart involvement for example. Also observing cardiac inflammation in otherwise young and healthy people is completely abnormal, particularly when we begin seeing it across large numbers of people. 

stuff like this should really scare people but I still see a lot of people being incredibly cavalier about COVID in general.

Basically means that all of the countries listed within it have agreed to trade together with minimal tariffs - hence boosting trade between all of them. It's bullish for asian countries like Australia, NZ, China, Korea etc. Basically brings them all in-line as if they were their own EU bloc.

Will be bullish for them, bearish for US/Europe. As these asian countries will now prefer to deal with themselves on Exports/Imports, and face less tariffs - cheaper business.

In hindsight, it will probably push Biden to become part of it or miss out. Same with EU/UK.
It was looking weak on Friday. I would normally buy puts there but I've lost enough money listening to myself so I bought calls.
the only way
I have SPY straddle. Covid cases, we're right at that triple peak spot again. I feel like we are either gonna rocket past this week, or limit down. Am cool with either! If you want a cheap one, play one that has gapped up last week, i.e. Nordstrom. You can buy 2 weeks out, 1$ OTM, Each direction costs $100, $16/put, $18 call. It made almost two dollar jump just Friday, I feel like the odds that one leg would pay out at minimum 3fold is HIGHLY probable.

I'm sorry bro. I know its tough. I'm 20 and a Junior on college and I'm really happy I'm not 22. Can't imagine trying to get a job in this landscape. But it will get better.

A lot of the boomers really fuck us in a lot of ways, but it will be our time to shine soon, and we can save the planet and live good lives. This year is just shit for everyone. But the virus will eventually go away, or at the very least it will just become another flu that nobody thinks about other than once a year for a shot.

100k over 30 years with an annual interest rate of 7% is 761,225$ and with an annual interest rate of 8% it's 1,006,265$

But you also need to know about SOR.

SOR will install some hard lessons on  how much you need to cover that stake, when the SOR tries to liquidate everyone that is trading the same patterns/dips/indicators.

You have to be willing to go, where the SOR doesn't want to go.But not too much that you give up too much % of your bankroll.

You also have to be willing to wait out position for at least 2 weeks, while the SOR is trying to gauge whether its more benefecial for the price to go up or down in price.

You also have to be flexible in your profit taking. Your stake has to be lower than the other side, as the SOR is programmed to make the most profit.

i.e $100/500 - $600 stake  vs $5000 stake

SOR Algo will take the $5k every time

Parliament is a shit show, the formation of a government and trying to get a majority of the seats in the commons leads to government coalitions between party‚Äôs that voters disagree with, but they must make to reach that majority.

Small cap manufacturing, and they both have cash which will let them make money from short term interest from the bank and pay their dividends. I like VRS simply because they have 33m in buybacks due and that is $10 in share price based on a 1 day t2 chart. When it goes to $13-14 I‚Äôll consider selling out of my position(vrs). CRS is a manufacturing/construction company that I originally bought 2 days after exdiv when it dropped and held onto the position because it was 1/4 of the price and significantly underperformed its peers(both vrs and Crs have been laggards). Buying laggards has been something that pays off for me as I consider it a low risk high reward. As long as the companies don‚Äôt go bankrupt and have large amounts of cash I feel confident in them.

Honestly out of all of that I haven‚Äôt even found that as the biggest roadblock to dating. It‚Äôs little stupid shit that comes from communicating over a phone rather than face to face. Our brain subconsciously pick up on so many little things when talking to someone like body language, tone, context of our surroundings, etc. But all of that disappears over text. You can send someone something and while you both see the same exact words, those words can be interpreted so differently it‚Äôs insane. Constant connection with everyone that has a rectangle with a screen in their pocket is not a good thing and I think we are going to see that very clearly in the next 10-20 years

Okay, sure but look at the post of this guy loosing 400k+. People are bashing OP and calling him every name that's practically available. Maybe somehow it helps getting it off the chest?

‚Äúüé∂ oh it‚Äôs such a perfect day, I‚Äôm glad I spent it with you üé∂‚Äù - me after spending the whole day on WSB
Thx retard
Nice award, here‚Äôs an award
MRNA $70p 12/4 is free money
yeah wtf is wrong with these people. Shocked these cheap hookers even let that happen.
With that kind of money, he can be both.
This is the most legit actual trading advice I've seen on WSB. Great read and reminder. Thanks OP! Sweet post.
Congratulations on your 5 seconds of post fame.
You're probably right to feel this way. I turned 18 in 1997. If cellphone videos and social media had been around when I was that age, I definitely would be in some deep shit now. The ability to make dumb teenager mistakes relatively free of consequences is an advantage that has been lost to a lot of people in today's younger generations.
You lost over 400k in a year... that‚Äôs not a long time. Even if it was 2k losing all of it is nothing to be proud of but I guess it‚Äôs good to look at the glass half full or whatever..

I‚Äôm not against baba at all, They‚Äôre a sound investment and I even think this will print. But OP decided to put a lot of words, adds a good amount of screenshots = ‚Äúsolid dd‚Äù
Seriously, this is true nonsense.
Actually you‚Äôre right. The only reason I pointed out the left is because it was originally towards the right and now the left is basically doing everything that song criticizes too. But the right also hasn‚Äôt quit on that either. I guess everything‚Äôs just getting generally shittier and shittier
Y'all need ETFs and Jesus
Holy shit that sounds like an amazing movie from the '90s.
Clearly the man is not as stupid as y‚Äôall think he is cause he some how got a couple hundred racks to be throwing around
Yes

Ok retard.

Sure, whatever is on the L2 right now may change on Monday. But still it was worth to point out that not only technicals look bearish but also L2 confirms the bias to the downside (as of now). If you play earnings, obviously it can go either way, however the way the stock looks heading into earnings gives you heads up & telegraphs in advance what is likely to happen to your position. Godspeed.
Yeah in March where we actually see the xbox and ps5 earnings.
Didnt he get caught sending dick pics to another chick and that‚Äôs why his wife left him?
You gotta evaluate a bit more to open a discussion. 

My take is yes, but it‚Äôs not limited to the left. It‚Äôs probably more prevalent within the right, not the conservative right, they‚Äôve sadly died out but the newsmax sort of right. 

I hope centrism makes a strong comeback soon. Politics is more fake and staged than wrestling at this point.
Buy puts against your instincts; if you think it‚Äôs going up buy puts and if you think it‚Äôs going down buy calls
You need to recover !
Same difference and ending.

I'm not touching any of the Chinese stocks, I know I'm missing out on some free money but there are other options out there to make easy money.
Bots didn't even scalp that much, and also going by the fact that they were sold out in literally first second i would guess not enough is understatement
Man what are puts and calls ? -_- if you started this two years ago I want to be making moves like you in two years

No. Just you.

First. Your sentence is incoherent.

Second. A question ends with a question mark.

Nothing about that year in particular. I‚Äôve just grown up in the age of the internet and the fear of being canceled for some shit I said when I was 15 since what‚Äôs okay to say and what‚Äôs not to always changing is always present when thinking about my career. When thinking about how I‚Äôd explain that to someone pre social media it seems like a pretty fuckin stupid concept. 

Also the thought of being able to go out and just fuck around with your buddies (never harm or do anything appropriate to anyone else obviously, honestly the fact that I feel the need to say that displays my ridiculous but also reasonable fears) and not have to worry about someone pulling out their phone and videoing you then putting it on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram sounds fucking awesome. 

Like 90% of my anxiety stems from some shit happening to me through some means of the technology introduced by smartphones and it‚Äôs only going to get worse. If modern advancements in technology is going to create some fuckin utopia or some shit eventually then why has this year been the worst we‚Äôve seen in a fat minute with no end in sight. I just hope I‚Äôm not wearing a mask in 2 years cause it and social distancing is taking away our humanity. I‚Äôd rather just get Covid, and absolutely worst case scenario is everyone gets it, the weakest .5% die.

Bet you didn‚Äôt realize you were opening Pandora‚Äôs box with that comment, but basically, things are shitty and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre getting better for a long time
Yes, you retard.

With condor you lose money by buying long legs, with naked ATM puts you simply put more money in your pocket. It's far simpler strategy with the only risk of assignment in case if the thing falls below your breakeven.
There's only one number people need to know and it's 90c.

There‚Äôs also large swaths of the population who probably wouldn‚Äôt die but don‚Äôt want to find out.

Have you ever thought about checking out IdB leaderboards for possible advice? I‚Äôd rather buy their sell ratings than their buy ratings unless you are trading at 4:30 et after reading their publishings. I‚Äôd recommend getting away from hype stock because there are a lot of companies other people are overlooking. Although, if it goes down Monday and Tuesday I am likely to buy into it, but only if it consolidates Monday and drops tuesday.

Sure but what are you doing to rectify this situation? Are you holding yourself responsible and accountable for the retarded shit you did? Do you acknowledge what you did was stupid? Will you try to learn from it? What can you do now to earn money?

Yooo no no no I honestly don't think your doing this right.  I mean YouTube has many free videos with many experienced people to teach you more. I think you need to put in more time researching your picks before you start trading.  Good luck!
You dumb fucks are missing the bigger picture. Between Nov 18 and Feb this stock is going to be at 80-100. Massive earnings result will ramp it up over Dec and then when they launch the sedan on NIO day, this thing is going rocket. Watch and see. Don't listen to the Bears, they seriously have no idea.

My second point, no shame in admitting you need help. Trading isn't for everyone, I like to think my years and years of poker/roulette trained me for options. It prepared my stomach for the severe extreme gains and losses. I would like to say you can learn from this, but sometimes the lesson is you are not built for trading. I don't know you however, maybe you come back and build your account no problem. Either way, the important thing is to learn something.

I agree with what /u/the13thrabbit said. March $300s even better. However, if you have the cash for it and just to be safe? I'd play the Jun 18th $270C for $30.65 a piece. Even though China is usually a lot quicker on rules and regulations than the US, I think this will take a few months to play out (not just regulations but the ANT IPO as well). This should net you anywhere between -20% and +120%. You're limiting your upside but also your downside. Also, no chance BABA doesn't make it back to $300. It's just a matter of when.
*responsibly retarded lol
I use to go to the casino 3 times a week before Covid closed my casino. Obviously I switched my Casino addiction for options. Went back to the casino for the first time tonight tho after 10 months. I gotta say, it's nothing compared to options. You can't gain or lose as fast at the casino as you can on options, even the roulette wheel takes to long to spin. Anyway my point, options trading can be worse than your normal gambling addiction.
Fuck yes. First stop $WMT earnings tuesday.
So u saved it in ten years but need a lifetime to recover. You truly are retarded

I did have 500K plus gains between Robinhood, Schwab and Fidelity between Nov 2019-Dec 2019 but lost all. I haven't posted those losses here. I have added and withdrawn several times on Robinhood and it make it difficult to track accurately. 
When I was 500K plus, I originally had only about 50K invested. But have added more as I lost more. 
So yes, If I had held on to all the gains, it wouod have been 800K plus between all 3 of my accounts.

Interesting article. It‚Äôs interesting to learn that there is such a technique that a group of people just sell their stock below the national best bid in order to drive the price down. But how does this technique actually work? How many people should cooperate on this together to achieve the goal crushing the price of a stock?

Not fake dear fellow trader.. I wish it was paper money. I have been devastated and went through a depression like phase for months due to continuous losses. I was chasing losses but could never really recover and the core strategy was to buy short term  puts. Retrospectively, the worst strategy in the biggest bull and bubble market of all times.

Here is the best 4 tips after 7 years trading that I learned, took me a while to get it:

1. Cut your losses, literally learn that its better to leave with 50% of your money than nothing or negative.
2. You never lose if you take a profit, for exampleI was up 3,500% on a mining stock and greedy me just pulled the initial investment like 500 , instead of taking 7k enteded up with 1200.
3. Dont fall in love for a company/ position, the whole point is to get $$ not seeing the fucker green in your account. Cash is kaang to buy new positions.
4.  Dont YOLO everything in one trade, spread it in thousands( 1k,2k, to 5k) in different companies and no more than 5k positions unless you really want to get lucky and risk losing everything (hence you for example)
What did you yolo?
You mean #]^[}g-13xi?

It‚Äôll take 5 years of labor after tax for him to get that back. 5 years of the one life you get. Fuck.
I can't believe this needs to be explained, but not everyone with a underlying condition lives alone. They might live with other family members who are healthy. With what you're proposing, the healthy family members would not be eligible to stay home and collect stimulus, so that means they need to go out and work. And when they go out and work, there's a good possibility they will bring it back home

I still simply can not believe people play options with actual savings. I have never thrown down more that I could afford to throw down at a black jack table. Jesus Christ man. God speed to you.
Bots are made by the scalpers. The reason they are active is because scalpers know they can buy all the GPUs available and deliver a profit. Take for example NVDA produces an arbitrary number of additional GPUs. Demand for GPUs stays the same but supply increases. There's 2 things that happen in this scenario:

1. Bots continue to buy all GPUs available, their profit margins reduce (possibly to zero or below) because demand stays the same but supply drastically increases. They suddenly have an insanely large quantity of graphics cards and demand cannot support their profit. They stop the bots from buying.

2. If bots don't stop buying all the additional GPUs available, scalpers have to increase the price to compensate for the loss of profit. At a point, people will look for complimentary complimentary goods. Then, scalpers stop bots from buying all NVDA supply.


I'm glad they're fixing the bot issue but this is why supply was the fundamental issue with NVDA. Definitely dug themselves a hole.
Didn't even hit the 21 days EMA line. You should sell and buy again at 35. Next week doesn't look good for NIO buddy.

Reinforces the point that ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt make money when you sell, you make money when you buy‚Äù.
Yeah pretty much any stock that ends up mooning will have buzz around it for a long time before that, BUT so many other stocks that never run up like that will get the exact same buzz so it still becomes a crapshoot if you go off of hype solely like that.
How is PLTR going to moon? Just curious

Looks like a fun bet, hate that it didn't work out for you. 

Never gamble what you can laugh at losing and move on with no change to your lifestyle. This isn't r/investing or r/smartmoneymoves, this is fun money gambling.

Scuttle sideways baby

He didnt lose.   His money was transferred to a different account.
It happened
The initial steady part was all stock trading where I went nowhere. Then I went all retard in weeklies

Then I bought Tesla and Bausch call options that exploded after Q32019 ER. Also made big on Shopify puts (yes puts) and Roku calls and puts by pure luck. Was close to 475K on Nov 13 2019. 

Then Walmart calls fcuked me bad as I had 1600 $125 strike calls and I knew ER was going to be good as Walmart had invested big in e-commerce then. WMT opened up the next morning and I crossed 500K transiently but then it rapidly collapsed  to below $120 and I lost like 90-100K in a day. Then I started chasing my losses (biggest mistake).  

Being a long term Tesla bull, I quickly realized it was going in bubble territory when it crossed $420 and I started buying puts and boy I was so WRONG! It was a relentless pump and all my puts would expire worthless. I bought puts during each ER thinking now it would come down to earth or at least pull back a bit. BUT No. The bubble keeps getting bigger.

Shopify and Apple puts also killed me a lot. I wouid only buy put on those after they had a long bull runs and those pigs would still go up. 

I was extremely unfortunate to have iron condors on various positions in Feb when market collapsed and I actually lost money instead of making a fortune despite being a gay bear. I also bought calls on good companies like NVDA, MSFT, Google, AMD, Regeneron, EW, Ulta, etc but ny timing was so fkued up that I barely made any money. 

I bought and sold 1000s of puts and 100s of calls but kept losing every week until June end. 

In short nothing worked for me.. absolutely nothing. 

Key lessons:
1) Never chase losses
2) Manage positions really well
3) Don't short a cult stock irrespective of valuation 
4) take a break if nothing is going your way
5) Don't be a gay bear. Bulls are always rewarded better than a bear even if they might be right 50% of the times
6) Don't buy weeklies. Those almost always lose. 

I actually discovered WSB quote late (in March) and autists here helped me in slowing down my losses...Otherwise, I would have been out long time ago..
Nah I expect single digit roi and I hope for quadruple digit daily returns. I don‚Äôt know about those companies and I would need 2 days of Dd to give you an honest opinion. I‚Äôm sorry for being unable to help. Personally I am 90% cash 5% stock and 5%options because I‚Äôm nervous about the market. I am assuming CCL is capped at $17 and AAL at $13 due to their 1.5b each in stock sales. Since they both run on etfs either that is their cap or a lot of people are about to overpay for stock if bond yields go up. A decent wedge would be CCL puts with UAL or DAL calls, but that‚Äôs expensive(not CCL puts which makes me think it is gonna drop). I like CRS and VRS long, as they will jump if bond yields rise significantly(been in on both since 7.50vrs and 17.50 CRS). As people panic sell in December I plan on buying in and selling out the day after inauguration. My theory is that cyclicals have to go up and even out before markets will tank.
You did a quicksave at some point with F5, right?

That‚Äô tweets source: trust me bro. I just don‚Äôt get how that 6% statistic is wrong. Explain to me
He literally said it‚Äôs ‚Äúup and down‚Äù but okay guy I can‚Äôt deal with a person like you today or any time in the future. Enjoy.
Was reading a Bloomberg article the other day that was mentioning that Wall Street will be looking at the efficacy of the vaccine compared Pfizer‚Äôs baseline, which is 90%. If it doesn‚Äôt hit that then you‚Äôll probably see a drop. If it‚Äôs better then you‚Äôll see it jump up.

The amount of risk you want to dedicate to the play is up to your own tolerance my friend.

Lol too long not reading it, total snooze fest. Stonks only go up Nio $150c 11/20
They‚Äôre shares. Who cares. It‚Äôll go to 35 after earnings. You can buy more. And it‚Äôll be $200 by 2030
ccp isn‚Äôt gonna let nio dip that far
I think that the left is just so fucking bad at explaining their thoughts and when they get questioned they spazz out and cancel someone.
You‚Äôre definitely right but essentially boils down to their rate of burning calories. Which can be tested and measured. There is literally no way around the burn more calories than you eat and you lose weight, eat more calories than you burn and you gain weight. At its most basic level it boils down to the law of conservation of mass
Baba stock is great for sure but not sure about your play on the option. After all its not the fundamentals dragging the price down but the polictics with CCP
There's a reason the CEO sold a shit ton of shares the next day. And to the people who say it was "planned" ahead of time for him to sell. You're not wrong but you a retarded because they decided the sell date in August, presumably knowing the results, and what op mentioned.

Decent long term DD. Horrible for the average WSB‚Äôer making monthly plays.

Pretty inaccurate claims though. America easily has competitors beyond Elon, and the notion that only 25% of China will be EV in 2025 is understating it.

Wow. It looks like you made the wrong move every time.

"Those saying ‚Äòonly 6% die from COVID-19 alone,‚Äô or some derivation thereof, don‚Äôt understand how infectious diseases work,‚Äù Ryan McNamara, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a virologist who studies HIV, wrote in¬†a Twitter post."

It answers your own question...
There's no evidence his condition is getting worse, idiot
It's like this anytime the market is stagnant. When we have a larger move, people will flood back. It also happens when people are culled after following a stock blindly aka NIO.

What I want to know is how so many people got covid so quickly. Were they thinking ‚Äúim vaccinated now bitch, YEET‚Äù without realizing they could have had the placebo?

Also, not sure why you are convinced the efficacy will quickly drop.
You realize you just made the case for puts... Elon has 2 favorites in China selling 2x more cars than NIO. And the cars are nicer, better brand, and oh, $11,000 cheaper come Jan 2021.

Oh. You‚Äôre talking 2025/2030. Sure. Your shares (whatever those are) will be super valuable in a decade. No doubt. Thought this was WSB tho 

It‚Äôs going to 35 after earnings tho. Set a reminder.

It's a sat night, literally the only day we shouldn't be thinking about stocks but here we degens are. I think for some, this is the only community we have.

Read my other comment she said she didn‚Äôt wanna sell it previously
Was that wsbgod? I remember that account did something similar, but it turned out to be a fake account made by an ex mod trying to get new people into thr sub so they could sell their garbage to a bigger audience

So why put such a huge burden on the rest of society? Why not force those with contributing conditions to quarantine and have the stimulus go to them while the rest of us work?

$35 at earnings :/ but good luck
Wtf
I gotta ask, is this a life changing loss or is this just chump change for you? Deciding how aroused I should be.
Long term $200 brother. After earnings it‚Äôs going to 35 tho

I'm in.
That‚Äôs cool. My only point is a lot of people are long even if only on individual tickers.
So OTM yolo PLTR or RKT? I don't understand...

<edit> also, sounds like you shoot for high single digit ROI. Is this weekly or monthly?
I see a lot of BUYING...
Do you ever sell options?

Might look into it.

How do you not already know this? Everything you're stating is already common knowledge. Yes, those who are healthy has a very good survival rate, and those with underlying conditions is where it's practically a death sentence
Anytime you get the urge to trust idiot pundits on CNBC remember this line at the beginning of April. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to retest March lows.‚Äù

That one line, much repeated, cost investors billions.
Thanks, I hope we hear an update on Monday.  
What's your strike btw?
[deleted]
HAHAHAHAHAHA ^(oh you‚Äôre serious)
Yesssss but Covid was a catalyst.

A more dramatic example: someone has some sort of auto immune disease but  they are shot and murdered. While they were probably going to die from the disease, that‚Äôs still a murder statistic. 

But I do see the point you‚Äôre making, definitely makes COVID seem more deadly
I don't know why but I always read PTON as Pee a ton.
Did we just become best friends?

6% of covid deaths are just from covid. Only covid. The remaining 94% had contributing conditions

In general yes, this is assuming a stable metabolic rate. Some individuals have metabolic rates that change as they limit intake. This can cause people who are limiting food intake and exercising to maintain their weight because their BMR drops.

I think they are incredibly smart and absolutely think things through.
well i'm about to blow your mind

everyone you know and care for will die one day, some just a little bit more painful
Welcome brother
This is retarded analysis. It initially drops probability of infection by 90%. That‚Äôs a dramatic impact. Longitudinal studies will show how long that effect lasts, but these findings so far are very positive.
Yes, it is when you sell cash secured puts.
If the stock price goes below the strike, then the shares are put on you.

Once this occurs, you sell covered calls.
If the stock price goes above the strike, then you are assigned (shares taken away and you're paid as per the strike).

This completes the wheel.
Then use cash from being assigned, to sell cash secured puts again and repeat...

And the day before the election was like July 1st. Time's all fucked up these days.

Point being?

Double that amount and another 100k, now compress those deaths into 8 months. Does that sound low to you?

I believe there were rumours that they had just put an application through for some form of testing approval on their vaccine and they would be releasing positive news in the next 2-3 weeks, could likely pump this 10-15%.
Damn, what positions did you have?

You‚Äôll seem very mysterious and edgy when you have to ‚Äústep out‚Äù for a smoke break. Makes you seem like you‚Äôve got a lot going on and need a break, tinder girls will love it
They crave simp attention now more than ever because COVID interferes eith it in reality.

Not all girls are attention whereas, but a lot are, just like not all guys are pigs but a lot are. The trick is to pay no attention to the girls that are attention whores and to pursue the ones that aren't (and there are a lot of decent girls out there).
80% gain? I hold to 300% or expire worthless p much every time.

Maybe I should take notes... up 150% on NIO puts... holding for the 1000%...

So what is going with NIO on Monday???
Idk I think it‚Äôs hilariously ironic that Elon got covid now after saying it would be gone by the end of April. Love the guy but his political/covid stance this year has been insufferable. Stick to cars and rockets and stop being an ass

its like a different forum. this week in particular. i guess they had another round of bans?
Some rich oil princes probably already saw this
Bear credit spreads. I agree with the position but I also believe TSLA has real potential to crash. You could sell a greater quantity of options as well without risk of ruin.

So why is WSB bullish on PLTR again? It's not like they just started getting government contracts. They have been doing that for 17 years and they never made a profit.

I also wanna say don't think finding a girl is on a time limit. Take your time and find the right fit. A lot of people jump in without understanding the long term of it.

I feel you. 

Was down a good bit over the summer. 

Pulled my head out of my ass, figured out where I was fucking up, now up 100% in the last month (still down 40%) this year, but have some plays going that will fix all that.
Ha!
It's a sub for people who got picked on their entire life lol any article posted there gets flooded with nonsense right left middle doesn't matter
Hedge funds were net sellers last month. They reduced their exposure by 250k shares. Just because half of their stock was bought up by big banks and trading firms at much much lower prices, doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre adding more, in fact, like I said, they‚Äòve been net sellers. You poor summer child.
Dude they bought it at 9.50 and not the 15$. Who cares when it became public knowledge. Their DD and decision to purchase was on a much lower multiple. 

I own shares so why don‚Äôt you buy high further increase the price
You right I thought that said buying puts üòÇ
It‚Äôs what social media does. Gotta get those clicks so they push outrageous stuff that they know people will click on, spirals out of control.

if you had the cash would you pay upfront for a house or mortgage it and put it in stonks, i feel like the latter is a way better choice if you just put it in some safe plays, you'll have more than enough returns for the mortgage payments
Yeah at your age I spent about 50% on my bar tab. Sounds like you actually care about your future. As exciting as 100%sounds they don't talk about the potential loss. Well they do but we don't listen we jerk off to it.  You should probably head to /r/investing

In America the benefit of remote learning is that people can't shoot up a school via zoom. On the other hand it sucks cause students lose out on a very important social experience. I feel bad for students in college that can't be on campus or high schoolers who are missing out on good times. 2020 is a shitty year man it really is. Depressing but we'll get through it

That a good point. But also, fitness is so much more simple than people make it out to be. Move around a lot and eat healthy. Move around a little more and more over time. Burn more calories than you eat, you lose weight. Eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight.

I agree, my original investment was $1400 and I haven‚Äôt put in anything else. Been to $3900 to $88. Opened last week at $2300 and now at $860. The was I see it, money has so much more intrinsic value to me and it ever will again. So if I get really lucky, I put myself in a position to be able to save pretty much 90% of my paycheck for a while, if it doesn‚Äôt work out, I lose an amount of money that would suck sure, but isn‚Äôt worth losing sleep over
Clearly Robinhood was the issue

Well, CCL 25c 6/19‚Äôs ended up being 20 baggers for the retard rally. 0.13 bought, 2.83 sold. 

Thinking about trying for another one. CCL 25c 12/18‚Äôs closed at 0.17 at 95 IV & 10k OI, ER on 12/18. 

If CCL hits 20 by 12/1 at same IV it‚Äôs +100%, if it hits 21 by 12/1 it‚Äôs +200%, and if it hits 22 it‚Äôs ~+350%.

I bought 3,000 shares at $3.50, basically for me it was betting the farm as it was $12,000 which was my total account. Im still holding today and it was about $145,000 on Thursday. I'll tell you, I dumped it all on NIO because I just *knew* they were going to explode. I liked the technology they were implementing such as the battery swap, the little AI thing on the dash, the quality of the vehicles themselves (its a luxury vehicle, more expensive than Teslas) but most importantly the Chinese EV market was set to rocket with millions of potential buyers. For me, I play stocks for the ups and downs but when it comes to betting the farm you have to believe in the company top to bottom. If you dont then you will lose it all.
Unless you got some money givers who truely believe in the company.

Yes I think it‚Äôs fair to say I‚Äôm retarded but I also think you‚Äôre missing my point. these fuckers reselling on eBay for triple the retail price wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it so easily if bots weren‚Äôt able to suck up a huge chunk of the supply before regular customers can even get their orders for a single one, thus forcing them to buy from the cucks on eBay. The bots are tremendously exacerbating the problem, even if they are not necessarily the complete root of it, if you can‚Äôt see that then maybe you are in fact the retard. Also fuck you.

Once again, your lack of coherence shows itself. You're acting like the market is incredibly stable with only mild inflation on fiat, when we both know it's not.

Ant groups micro lending has been over leveraging with banks money for years and they wanted to IPO as a tech company instead of a bank, which bypasses regulations as an financial institution.

That‚Äôs why it was shut down.

I am a data scientist so I know a lot about what Palantir is trying to deliver, prob have better insight on teh technical and business end of it than most. That's why I'm so hot on these guys, they are coming at this from the complete opposite end of traditional expectations and will thrive. Government contracts are consistent but capped and consumer markets are hte real money maker where they are breaking through and will continue too.

Ya that's kinda my play, and what I did. Set a limit order at 14 and if it dips again 12.50. I've been very patient this week and got in at 14 which seems below the floor fluctuations so far... but do I buy in slow or just fucking throw 40% of my portfolio on them at 1 point and walk away. This market is volatile as fuck, sure it may not amtter in years but I don't wanna buy at the top now even.

No trust me these guys are worth at least 50 bucks possibly 100 by end of 2021.

If you close and lost money then they weren't winning trades. If you bought where you closed and rode it up, that's a winning trade. Most of your trades were losing trades, hence why you lost.

Oof, theta gonna play with your bunghole for 3 days
Dude you haven't missed your opportunity.

Palantir is turning a business model on its head (government contracting) and their total addressable market is gigantic.

Just be careful Monday morning, it will be easy to buy the top of a wild swing and you'll be bagholding for days or weeks if you time it wrong.

Put in a limit buy order for 15 and let it fill. Don't touch the shares for a few years, I bet you'll 10x your money or better.

Average down on the off chance it dips lower than your entry point.
The JAN 2022 $10c are still $8.50. Sure that's .70 delta instead of the 1 delta you could have gotten back when it was $8.50 by buying shares, but it's still not a bad multiplier for being late.
If you were born with a penis, you are a man. That is the end of the story.

Ok a plane crash got it. Just tell me was I in a Boeing?
Universities would have no reason to modernize. The crush would be continued decline in the relevance of youth entering the professional marketplace, having spent their time and energy on education without ever making a balanced decision regarding its utility and payoff likelihood.
Any measurement of the 245k deaths against previous years death rate in a year? Is there a spite in death rate this year
 ,o
Dude 40k to 350k in a few days is still fucking great. Perspective
Honestly I got no clue and neither does anyone else. It could go up because prices often run up till earnings, short sellers getting squeezed, or hell maybe some institutions using this chance to get some NIO in their portfolio. Or it could go down if the market goes down, people continue to sell for profit taking because they don't want to take that risk on such a risky stock, or maybe the POTUS (is his name still bannable by mentioning it here?) decides to tweet against China again. I'm personally sitting out for now until things are less iffy.

I think part of the problem was that Trump kept talking about fast tracking approval without adequate testing. We have an FDA and these processes to ensure the cure isn‚Äôt worse than the disease, saying you want to bypass them for the sake of good PR doesn‚Äôt increase trust.
I do think PLTR can touch 35 in 6 mo.
Yes, pinning literally any post with DD flair was a great idea
Forsure, appreciate that honesty though. I buy and hold for a while just learn metrics and thinking, I'm not a dumbass like most of the people here who are new or just dgaf. Did a lot of homework before deciding to step into this. PLTR were my boys though dam, I locked in at 14 for way too little money and those shares won't be sold for a very long time I would guess...

With 40k you sell covered calls and gamble your way to thousandaire status!
@ theta gang. You guys ever considered managing a hedge fund with boomer‚Äôs money but all you do is run the wheel on SPY? It‚Äôd be so easy and I have a finance degree so the boomers would eat it up and think that matters
Stonks only go up anyways
With the symptom lag time every person you expose yourself to is also exposing you to everyone they've had contact with in the past few days, and potentially the people those have had contact with.

I'm not super scared of covid, but I'd prefer to wait a year before I get infected just to let everyone else beta test it first, and let the doctors get a bit of experience dealing with it and understanding the potential risks first.

It's a bit annoying because if everyone had avoided contact as much as I did during the initial wave this shit would be gone by now. But instead they were going out and/or not wearing masks and kept the circular spread going.
How TF?!?!?!?!
Nothing surprises me I guess: the guy made sure we dumped billions on vaccine R&D and yet anti-vaxxers are somehow heeding his call and construing his message as anti-vaccine?

He is actually the retard whisperer.
Give me the courage to throw down though, admittedly risk averse and only have maybe 15k to play with but needed the strength to just say fuck it and go in heavy on my gut there even though my gut counts for almost nothing since i have little experience...

This China nonsense is happening and has been happening for a while.

This speculation is what happens when you give so much stimulus but not focus on the underlying issue.

Take a look at all risk assets over the last several years. It's a massive bubble.

NVDA does not have enough GPUs for everyone. If they did, then everyone that wants one would get one. People buy many NVDA GPUs because they know a lot of people need them so they know they can resell them at higher prices. If NVDA made a lot more GPUs then people could buy from NVDA instead. People that bought several GPUs would not make enough money buying and reselling more GPUs than there is demand for.

They most certainly did not produce enough GPUs in preparation for the release. Do with these statistics what you will, but they are a business that can do whatever they want. If they want to make them hard to get in order to make them seem worth more like Nintendo has done with various items, such as certain Amiibo models in certain countries for example, they will do exactly that, whether intentional or not. To say they would not fail a launch because they have money is very incorrect.
I went to Kroger and I could hardly move without bumping into someone

YETI coolers are where it's at. Side by side from regular coolers you can make a YETI last twice as long. Thermos is a dime a dozen, double vac seal and boom cold for 12 hours. But coolers are not all the same ( I use them for week long festivals) and the difference can be stark. Not that its a reason to buy or go public but they actually have a good product.

Holy shit bro you were risking 400K on Robinhood?
I don't think you can read anything about it. It's a gamble just like throwing money at any Vegas table. I doubt you will find any 0dte trading strategy because it involves losing all of your money in a matter of hours. This is why you are here.
You mean your portfolio down to 2.5% left
how was your day
it's all bullshit though

at the end of the day, it's always a guess. the only way to get an edge is insider info, which is just connections and has nothing to do with analytical skills

all of it is to create this sophistication around what is essentially gambling, to justify to clients that they did all the calculations but they lost $20 million because no one knows what the markets will do
I have a feeling this could be true but at this point holding puts over the weekend Is a bad idea

Finally, APHA confirmation bias.
Their brand/name is pretty strong with a solid line of products, but as more and more entrepreneurs have lower barriers of entry to private label - there'll be competitors taking stabs at them. Factories wanna make money too, and their technology isn't anything super godly. They just do the core things right, but they'll have to fend off a lot of competitors over the next few years. Imho

Goodluck doeeee~

i was talking about people in government (fed is a quasi gov entity) that would be able to provide good financial advice, whether or not they have tsp. Those people are the ones i listed and include people who work at the FED.  A lot of people in the fed, weather they have tsp or not (it isn't relevant), would know how to provide good advice and have knowledge of banking laws and tax law. They actually regulate the financial sector in many ways. I am as smart as i think i am, thank you.
that's actually truer than most people think. Performance doesn't even matter that much, all they need is to get their fee and make it seem like they know what they're doing

Sell your winners, keep your losers; always a fine strategy.
Especially considering:

> Among them was one regulating online microlending. With Mr. Xi‚Äôs blessing, the central bank and the banking regulator made the draft rule even tougher than previously conceived, according to the Chinese officials familiar with the decision-making. The new rule had a requirement that didn‚Äôt exist in previous drafts: Firms such as Ant would need to fund at least 30% of each loan it makes in conjunction with banks.


> The China Securities Regulatory Commission, which previously signed off on the listings, now says it was a ‚Äúresponsible move‚Äù to protect investors and markets, as the regulation, once implemented, would severely limit Ant‚Äôs business scope and profitability.

> Ant could try again to go public. Market participants believe it will reorganize its business units, rethink its business model and inform investors of additional risks. All this likely will mean that Ant‚Äôs lofty valuation will be cut when it tries to list again, and the company may not be able to raise as much money as it aimed for this round, analysts say.

My partner in my business is more than willing to pick up the slack after the amount of time I've put into our business over the past year. When my friend called him and let him know of the situation, he immediately told me he wouldn't let me come into work and that he will cover for my shifts. 

I agree with everything you said tho. I am genuinely in a terrible mental state and if my friend didn't mean a lot to me, I would not have gone to this.
People went from $200 to 80k just riding puts and TVIX. It was insanity

Ah, gotcha. In September I went in on a shitload of weed stock calls for after the election. Biden/Harris supporting decriminalization of sticky icky, plus four states were voting on legalization in some form or another. Shit is literally up over 400% since then. Playing long term might even work out; its not a quick buck, but it'll make money.
Actually you could use the iPhone measuring app for the shits, I never thought about that. Most of my shits look like a nightmare though, and would be tough to measure in linear terms
Yes. Big funds just sell stonks to buy other stonks. They have to do it to collect 2% management fee, and impression that they‚Äôre doing something complicated

In real life, 95% of funds underperform the index

The funny thing is there isn't much "value" left to begin with. You have boomer companies like Coca Cola, PG, Costco with P/Es like 35 as if they are tech companies.

man I would make up an excuse, no way I would go. Seeing people super happy would just worsen my depression. There's a reason why people doing not well on a personal level tend to isolate
Yo no offense but I wouldn't put so much money on the line. I know this is WSB and it's part of the culture here to yolo money but since you seem unfamiliar with how a lot of this stuff works I'm worried you might not fully realize how risky it is. Regardless I'll try to explain the relevant stuff. 

* **IV crush** \- Essentially it's loss of demand, but it's easier to think about it using an example. Say there's a $100 stock called WSB. It's a new company so earnings results are a mystery, but if results are good, people are expecting the price to jump high. Say you **already have an option for $120c strike expiring that week.** Let's compare the situation before and after earnings. Before earnings, you see **people willing to pay you $200 dollars for that option**. After all, it could jump that high, who knows what mystery product or revenue beats they could announce which could make their stock skyrocket. **After earnings**, let's say earnings was okay, what people expected, and the stock price stays around $100-105. Now earnings are over and price didn't jump very much, are there as many people who want to buy your $120c option? No, because earnings have finished, price didn't jump much, and there's now very little chance the stock price will reach $120 by the end of the week when your contract expires. Now how much are people willing to pay for it? Let's say $20 at best. Your option was worth $200 dollars, now it's worth only $20 dollars, and by the end of the week, worthless with a complete loss of $200. This is IV crush. However it's difficult to estimate the amount of IV crush, because it's also dependent on how much the stock price moves after earnings. If the stock price does manage to rocket past $120, you won't be worried about IV crush because it's already ITM and actually worth money now up till expiry. This is what people who play earnings are hoping for.

Its a tech company
Does this mean i should buy big tobacco?
You really think a company with as large of a pocket book as NVDA would fail to anticipate the demand for their revolutionary product and not produce enough of it? 

It‚Äôs not that there not enough GPUs to go around  fairly to their customers (ie a traditional shortage) but bots are scalping them because they were literally able to order dozens/hundreds at a time because there was no safeguards on the website against it, thus creating an artificial shortage, kind of similar to all the panic buying of toilet paper/paper towels in March. 

NVDA has since fixed this problem and is only allowing 1 per customer and I hope they‚Äôre also in the midsts of taking other precautions to prevent bots as well like with recaptcha or something of the sorts.

They bring up the stock market, about how it is ripping higher and higher. One of them mentions that he just bought 60 shares of AMC. Other one says he bought a few shares of Starbucks, "they're doing really well right now."

The top is in.

Don't worry too much. Your options may be part of someone's spread and they could be happy too! When I sell covered calls, I'm happy for both of us if they get assigned because that's the risk I signed up for.

If you start with 20k you could make it with just 2 x 10 baggers if you live very fruggaly (and keep this money in stocks). 3x10 bagger I feel would be enough.

 Since march I have been averaging like 3 times my work income just trading while working from home. Kind of feel like I messed up buying boring etfs for the last 5 years because I had too much distraction at work to keep tab on my trading. 

I am honestly thinking about just doing this full time when I should be supposed to go back to the office. But I am only in my early 30s and don't have fuck you money yet.

How much space a single car battery swap station takes up, the robotics in the swap station need to be really precise and the car has to be in exactly the right position. But my biggest concern is this. Where are you going to put the battery swap stations especially for multiple cars? The good thing about supercharging stations is they don‚Äôt take up a lot of space and hypothetically you could put one at every street parking spot on the sidewalks next to the parking meter as long as you had a source of electricity

"850K losses in ~ 7.5 months!
I can share my story with you. I had almost 400K gains in my regular trading and another 100K gains in my Roth account by Nov 2019. Then, I made the mistake of buying puts on several high flyers trying to predict the top. Those include Tesla, Shopify, Apple and SPY/ QQQ from April onwards!

Used to double down on puts when they went in red. THIS EXACT STRATEGY MADE ME MONEY BEFORE. So I wasn't being stupid. But back then these stocks moved both ways. Then these Mfukers went on a crazy bull run with NO pullbacks or very short pullbacks that were immediately bought back. Had continuous losses from Nov 13th until June 30th. NOT A SINGLE WEEK WHEN I DIDN'T LOSE MONEY. Even with the March crash, I had iron condors that made me lose money. Tried numerous strategies except Theta Gang and still lost.. I lost all 500K gains plus another 350K or so.. Only then I realized how fucked the entire market was and acknowledged several of my mistakes and I stopped betting big."

No. Look at commercial reitz and airlines, still plenty of room to grow, with 5-15% dividend yeilds that can be found easily.

When shits dropping, you ever feel like you're financing someone else's margin call when they have to sell LEAP's to cover the drop in market value? Idk for me as soon as I started thinking of options in that manner (because i've been on that side before, the one having to sell super long dated LEAP's to meet margin call...) trading the markets became easier. You just think of shit like "someone else is getting fucked in the ass on this position, and i have cash to buy the opportunity from them for pennies on the dollar", think of the market completely objectively as what it is, not some conspiracy where hedgies and MM's are out to get you and make you lose money.. that kind of thinking is why so many of you won't be profitable.

So does anyone think the more solid tech stocks continue to be relatively flat, the more speculative ones continue to unwind, while the value stocks continue to quietly rally?

I wouldn't doubt a short term reversal on the trend as we're starting to push pretty deep into technicals, but I'm expecting the trend to continue at least over the medium term without something like bad news from Moderna's side or something more extreme.

PLTR isn‚Äôt Chinese and yet it‚Äôs somehow worse.
Taking 5 minutes out of your day for a battery swap once every 1 month is amazing. And like I stated earlier. Thr average Chinese citizen does not have a garage. Where do you suppose they are going to plug it in?
Nice

Yeah good luck timing the market me and everyone else did that with SPY puts 4/17 and shit kept pumping.

Yes hold thru like hold thru earnings. Although I‚Äôm not even sure that there will be the momentum you‚Äôre seeking going into earnings now after Friday‚Äôs price action across all three of the big Chinese EVs that you‚Äôre looking for. Think run ups into earnings as happening weeks before, not days before. Much more unpredictability in the final days before the actual event. You may have missed the boat on this one and I wouldn‚Äôt encourage one of your first options plays to be this one. But good luck if you do go for it! Citron researches hit piece last week is going to and has added some more uncertainty to the equation as well.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying though. A battery swapping system is dumb when you don‚Äôt need to get a quick charge.

What makes you think the federal gov will designate one company, rather than allow anyone willing to pay the licensing fees and taxes to enter the market?  Although medical is legal in more places than recreational, I suspect recreational will be the future. I don't see cannabis becoming a serious pharmaceutical product faster than it becomes a fun gummy/brownie/drink that people consume to let loose. Aphria has aligned itself with an insufferable heady jamband festival throwing beer manufacturer, not a pharmacy chain in anticipation of this. But it remains to be seen.

Alcohol is federally regulated through the TTB and then each state has a regulatory agency. I could see a situation where cannabis is federally decriminalized/legalized, and left to states to decide beyond that. Interstate distribution would be legitimized. There would be all sorts of different rules from state to state (as we see with cannabis and alcohol laws already), and you would have multiple competing groups: APHA/sweetwater, AB/Tilray, etc. APHA is banking on "craft" branding and reputation when they will be up against competitors with 100x the resources. I'm rooting for them but coming from the beer industry I can see where bigger money might just totally dominate them.

My main point is just when we talk about "companies without morals" that don't give a shit and will go after literally any contract those exist in abundance already in the DC area (many of them have already been doing this for decades), and all these "legacy" government consulting and contracting companies are absolutely increasing their capacity for analytics and data science. The idea that no one can step in and fill the niche Palantir is currently filling is just not realistic especially if we're focusing on long term. Palantir knows this because their business model is to get these agencies and other organizations entrenched in their "ecosystem" of products so it will be difficult to migrate later. However, that's an old trick that people will catch on to once they realize they're not offering things that can't be done with other solutions. As the government gets more savvy with this (will admittedly take much longer than industry), that desire to be stuck with Palantir will wane, and again,  administration change will change the dynamics of their growth as well.

You're retarded if you think your economy continues thriving when your healthcare system is overwhelmed. See El Paso where inmates are carrying out dead bodies for the medical examiner.
Be careful. You're basically long $20,000 of stock going into earnings with coverage of about $0.80/share if it drops. This isn't a problem if you wanted to be long anyway, but if this was supposed to be a one week play, it's priced to move nearly 20% up or down this week. Expect to gain or lose around $4,000 with your position size.

I think that's not quite accurate, especially looking forward at all. If you look at what they are doing, Nvidia is positioning itself as THE provider of the platform (hardware and software) on which AI and ML compute will be done during this phase change in computer science. Yes, there is a hardware component with their GPUs, there is also the software, such as CUDA which I have mentioned earlier as well as their many AI frameworks, training models, etc. I think you're missing their mid to long-term software and platform strategy due to it being overshadowed by hardware profits and leadership in the short term. I would highly encourage you to watch all the videos from GTC earlier this year and re-evaluate your stance on their revenue starting at 0 every year

You may know this, but of all your retirement accounts to go risk on with, the Roth is the best choice because the gains aren't taxed and withdrawal isn't taxed in retirement.
That said, if you were smart you'd cash out at least part and go to index funds with your fat win.

What kinda work you do?
True. I fought to basically get every possible trading permission Worldwide.  It's super helpful.  More importantly, by having this permission, it has no 'negative impact' on my buying power.

Price targets for technology shouldn‚Äôt go past 2 years just bc of how short the lifecycle for most tech is and just in general anything after 3 years is bullshit bc it is near impossible to calculate earnings more than 3 years out accurately

Thank you for the reply. I'm really sorry for being slow and asking the beginner-level questions. I hope I can give back to the community once I gain experience.

Since the 3k max gain is not correct, does that mean I would earn way more?

What I know based off the IV crush is that if I supposedly still had those contracts when the market closes on Tuesday, things will turn out very bad. So my plan was to buy the call contracts first thing Monday morning, say a prayer, and get rid of them by early Tuesday morning at the latest.

Thank you again for taking the time to reply to a clueless retard like me.

Price gouging, while ethically questionable regarding certain goods, maximizes the efficiency of the market by drawing high prices on high demand goods and signals for more production. You took the risk in the event they didn't go for above retail. If someone is willing to pay double for the PS5, it would be stupid for someone not to sell it to them. Well done in my opinion.

Spread ya cheeks and see
Very much emphasis on that. I'll catch up to you guys eventually, but for now I have to ask the stupid questions unfortunately. In my head I thought I'd come out to waaaaaay more so I'm super confused why me risking 8k would only lead to a gain of 3k.
You‚Äôre gonna be rich
Could be!

Look at the timeline, though. I intend to write some 12/18 $150p this week if we see a significant red day. This will cover 25% of my invested capital. 

As the theta decay on the 12/18's burn, and LONG before any stimulus or vaccine is out, we may well see the drop. 

Even if we hit $150 before 12/18, I just buy back the short leg, and then sell the long leg. That way, I get theta benefits from the 12/18, as well as delta and vega gains from my 3/19's. 

Even if this blows up in my face and I recognize that I'm wrong on 12/18, I've locked in 25% from the puts I wrote, and will likely only be down a maximum of 60% on my long leg. 

Max losses of 35% don't sound so bad...
It blew up

Do you follow these closely? I saw some giant prints that were shared on here including VGIT and DUST. In some cases you can confirm options buys or sells but all these big moves could be selling the top as easily as buying at resistance.
Not trying to be funny. Indians are very cheap. And in curious as to why
Mega yikes
I hate the fucking calculator
Read alot of comments on this thread. The issue is the few that hold on until 60 or whatever have the capital to lose their initial investment. Taking gains is function of your financial health. If you're a millionaire and sunk $50k into Nio at a $1 why not hold on? Either for gains or tax benefits. If you're putting $50k and have a nw of $70k then it's okay to take gains when it runs up even 20 percent.
Mega yikes

I'm not trying to be a dummy, but isn't that how naked put collateral is calculated? Isn't it basically as you are describing, albeit with the equivalent collateral to be long that particular stock at the brokers' special requirements?
If you play options, it's abundantly clear.  What the 2 'Questioners' don't understand is A. Option Pricing & B. Selling covered calls beneath the strike price of a longer dated option.  In fact, I would wager that 90% of this site is unaware of such a thing.  **I updated my comment to state 'OPs calls and not 'these' calls.**
Is there any public company not reporting their earnings using GAAP???

what rumor? no troll pls
Br the last time spy was at $300 was back in june and it never looked back besides thats ~19% drop. I‚Äôll take my chances we go up 1% on monday
What are you guys buying tomorrow?
If you had been paying attention to NIO sales, deliveries, plans to double production, xpeng earnings, Li earnings then I do believe most would be inclined to think that NIO will smash earnings and the stock will moon 30%. I do think the case against the valuation makes more logical sense however I think general market sentiment will prove otherwise. 

In other words, almost every stock is over valued and therefore almost none of them are. I believe that to be the case here. Extremely high potential for growth and capitalization and monopolization of large markets. With an opportunity to get in on the fifth floor I don't think people should miss out here. That sentiment alone will be shared by many who watched Tesla fomo. I believe that sentiment alone will be a massive driver in the price trending upward. 

Tesla had its IPO ten years ago. I bet it takes NIO half the time to reach Tesla's current valuation. And I believe Tesla will be much higher by then as well.

There *will* be a crash. And that's when we buy the dip Bois. But until then I'm a raging bull.
Ass to ass !

I had 100 shares and was selling weekly $2 calls on them when it was at $1.50 or so for $2-4/week and it jumped past $2 so I sold at $2 I guess. Still doesn't make up for the fact that I bought on the first day when they were like $9/share and I would've bought puts last week but like...IV
I don‚Äôt trade on margin so I‚Äôm never gonna owe the broker anything. And if it ends up being a falling knife that‚Äôll hurt for sure. But I‚Äôll eat the loss and come back fighting. I‚Äôm highly confident that nio will surge back like it has been before earnings. And I‚Äôll make an absolute killing being able to avg down if and when it does. The upside far outweighs the downside.
Thank you for making me feel better about life. I lost a measly 20k last week and it bugs the crap out me everytime I think about it.
Nice. Now like I tell myself don't get on meth and me and you will be fine in 40 years hahaha
> These short attacks are so fucking absurd though. I remember being in a rage when one of them went after Enphase and tanked like 25% of its value in one day. Seriously took over 3 weeks for ENPH to recover its value even though the whole thing was BS.

This one wasn't BS - it wasn't complicated, but it's solid logic that if Tesla is selling way below the level DB thinks is dangerous for NIO that has a good chance of screwing NIOs order book and wrecking the stock price since it's already twice as overvalued as Tesla.

I get that the bulls hate that narrative, but there's nothing inherently absurd or flimsy about it - it's a decent thesis.

The current price of his calls are $12.95. A $9 to $11 move in the option price would put his Feb $290's at $22 to $24.  I said $20 as a minimum.  I thank you for confirming. For real.

In any event I wasn't really doing much exercise in the 6 months before I got covid because of lockdown, so I don't think they're related. I was more just saying I wasn't obese or having other exacerbating symptoms.

WTF were you doing with MSFT?
Oh ok. Makes sense now. I have some bitch shares so I‚Äôm not worried
Also slight counterpoint: the valuation from my understanding has been exploding not because of their chips but because of their data center revenue and mellanox, both of which have been revising and increasing guidance. There is a data storage race going on (look at burry positions with Google, and other plays with snowflake, AWS adjacent services) and NVDA is seen as one of the key, front of the pack players.

The WSB Gods said you shouldn‚Äôt have mocked them and you should have invested $69,000. They say it‚Äôs not too late to make it a flat $69,000 before yoloing it on a wedge of CVX 6/21 Puts, and XOM 6/21 calls. Try to time the sell off and don‚Äôt panic if you lose a little bit of money in the short term. My favorite way of trading a wedge is going for 110%+ total cost before selling out one way and hoping the market goes the other direction. Invest in head fakes and volatility while only pulling money when it is profitable.

I never did before your post. Based on my findings, I see no reason to ever do it again
I agree. We are seeing a quasi squeeze as new money pours in from bonds. But that needs economic support so idk.

More lending means there needs to be more economic activity and more wealth poloraiztion. With calls for more social equity something has to give. Either you cut down on the money supply or risk a total collapse worse than 1929

Enough weight to drop it from 55 to under 42. What is more scary though, is that it pushed it down enough that it looked like it might lose its meme status on wsb. Comments went from all bull to mostly bear so fast. If it loses meme status it has much further to fall. It hasn't yet, but damn that looked close. I have a leap and 100 shares but this thing terrifies me

They know
> So many articles came out on so many different blogs about Citron being a notorious short seller just as NIO stock price began to fall. It felt super sketchy and looked like some pretty obvious manipulation.

Just China hitting back trying to protect their stock without having to put a huge amount of money on the line to protect nio's prestige as a "chinese tesla" stock. If they have to pay to stabilize the price it will cost them huge, it's insanely overvalued right now.
Stonk went down
Yeah this feels VERY similar to February when everyone just kept thinking that it would magically go away. I'm inclined to believe we won't resort to FULL shutdowns nearly as easily, but things are already worse than they were back then and if cases keep skyrocketing even with partial restrictions in place they're going to have to do something. Lost 14k on spy puts around election day, don't know if I have the heart to keep betting on it but I don't see how this could possibly keep up.

>NIO's share price was ***artificially*** driven down by short sellers on Friday through the tactic of unrelentingly selling at lower and lower bids

I mean I get that you're blindly bullish on NIO because you're holding it, but don't be salty about short selling working as intended. Short sellers sell into the bid of an overvalued equity, driving the price down until the ratio of sellers to buyers equalizes. This is the market finding the appropriate price.

Yes, there is an uptick rule that goes into play for a day after a hard drop, it's meant to prevent a death spiral on stocks that are being sold off, but it doesn't prevent continued short selling, it just means the short sellers form a wall of asks that the bulls have to buy into to drive the price up.

It's basically the regulators kneecapping short sellers after a bad day on a stock to give it a fighting chance, but unless there's a lot of demand the short selling will continue and they can resume selling into the bid and send the price down to an appropriate level.
You sir, are retarded.

Agreed on this as a big area of growth. But at some point you start to reach saturation in the data center market. The problem here is they are a hardware company. Not like Netflix or a cloud company with a growing subscription base. Which means every FY they start revenue at $0

Much appreciated!
Not saying Covid was planned but if it was it worked out perfectly. Chinas economy officially larger than America's now according to the IMF. America and Europe currently in shambles
why would the market crash? 

where else will people put their money? this is nothing like march, lockdowns just mean stimulus is on its way. And theres a couple vaccines around the corner.

big funds are pouring more money into the markets, even dix/gex support the rally lol

Go in NIO calls, whatever strike and sell before ER. It‚Äôs the easiest tendies in the market right now. And in this game, the tendies come hard
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs looking like. No matter what time frame you look at the candle sticks there are some big gaps. Albeit - this could be confirmation bias but usually looking at the charts is key.

Long term I think this stock is great. Short term I think still there is room for correction. That‚Äôs just my opinion though and I‚Äôm nowhere near a pro haha

The one by my house has nothing in the shelves. Not sure if they sold out or haven‚Äôt restocked...
Pretty sure I had it in January. Super tired all day. Just wanted to sleep all day. Had a pretty nasty cough. Think my dad had it in March met up for a vacation and I actually thought he was dieing.
Not satire. So i share a desk in a 24hour Security Ops Center...co-worker(we share the same desk/keyboard) on the last shift just tested positive..and no one ever cleans...how fucked am I? Any tips..my wife prego and due in 1 week also...

Yessir, and every single one is a 10 bagger. Unless you buy puts, then u get sent to hell
Based on the option you chose, this looks like a revenge trade. You're trying to get back a lot of your losses in a short amount of time. This is gambling.

The market spends a lot more time going up than it does going down. Probably better to wait for the drop to buy calls. If you're going to buy puts, at least buy a closer strike or give yourself plenty of time.
Going to blow your fucking mind rn... Disney VHS tapes go for $500+ on fleabay.
Go buy SPY 12/18 374/375c debit spreads monday
It's gonna be healthy for my puts lmao
Lolololol
For the love of god please pump.
Looking at its chart, it hit its week low and bounced off pretty hard. Bullish af

The other guys sucks. I have played him multiple times and never lost

Exit opp: OnlyFans

You're comparing apples to **trees.**
>also not buying tops

So, taking it to the extreme inverse and buying the bankruptcy and scandal.   Works for me.
As in the stock will go down a bit more?
If I only did thetagang this whole time I'd be up 8k but I'm down 10k due to tesla and nio shitting itself out of no where.
Exactly what I was thinking smh

I appreciate the words bro that‚Äôs a great way to view the situation. I actually opened a ROTH earlier this week and I‚Äôve already got those reoccurring deposits on deckü§ë
I think we might be in gambling addict‚Äôs heaven and aren‚Äôt aware we already died.
I got in. $630 calls 11/20. Already up 22%
Nice
Ass to ass!
Looking at the chart NIO has a lot of gaps to fill. Not a healthy look for the short term.
I got it around a month ago and it‚Äôs been pretty bad for my lungs. I had mild symptoms for a couple days and thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal until I started running again. I used to run at a 7 minute pace and now I die at a 9-10 minute pace.
Losses don't matter as long as revenues grow triple digits as profits will come in time just like amazon
has a floor of $10, limited downside risk until merger in 2021. buy now for spacex launch in december, sell before EOY if you change your mind
I will say on Vale - the price is pretty constant since the pump and you got a solid dividend payment if you owned the stock. That has macro-economic / secular trends of global infrastructure stimulus on the horizon

This. This is a utility. Why is WSB talking about a utility?
this is why GEICO stock doesn‚Äôt exist
So like tesla in 2013 pretty much
The price of the options will increase by the delta of the option multiplied by the increase in the underlying. A lot of options that are close to itm or near itm are around .45 to .55 delta which means a price move in the underlying of $20 moves the price of the option around $9 to $11.
Haha someone prob said this like 4 months ago and is looking back on it like FUCK.
I love Elon. Not Kamala‚Äôs laugh ü§Æ
I just Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna dip like that
Yay capital losses you can carry forward for tax purposes!!!
Just record lots of tracks of people talking and then play them back at the same time. He will be jealous of your party.

Well my weeklies only last ya know, a week. Fucking mouth breather.
isn't the target like 40 now?
I fell into the covid bad deathtrap
That's a good feel.
Are you thinking what I‚Äôm thinking?
No I actually sold the puts at a good time but then the money printer started up and I (along with a lot of others on this sub), thought it was a dead cat bounce so I used pretty much all of my capital on puts and you can probably guess how that went...
Absolutely baited
I snort mine, do not ask me why but I do.
Side effects may also include: suicidal thoughts or actions, nausea, heartburn, trouble sleeping, bankruptcy, and SEVERE autism + depression
, PERIODT.

So WBS is the most bullish on MSFT and ZM right now, did I read that correctly?

I have no idea what any of this says
slight counterpoint - Nvidia still owns a complete monopoly on datacenter GPUs due to CUDA and I think that is going to be a fantastic driver of long-term growth. But I think the gaming GPU competition from AMD, combined with supply shortages for the 3000 series should cause some short-term pain IMO

Do you think theres options trading in heaven?
Wish you all the best bud
Might as well wait for the premium to drop after earnings when it trades sideways for a week
What's the point of margin if you can't sell puts on it. I understand there's go-to-zero risk but the limit would mean the margin would be used as collateral. Like if I have 14k margin I should be able to make a 12k collat put.

Good work man, that proves you will be back. But hopefully with a ROTH IRA before you go trading options in this retarded market. Market is never fair bu always be hedged with long to the dong investments. Have a good night and keep to the grind !!!

Yea
It sounded like you meant next Friday‚Äôs 280 calls would be $20 , like I said in the first place. Why are you writing so much?
