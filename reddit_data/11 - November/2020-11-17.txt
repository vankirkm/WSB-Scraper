Oh man I remember when I was obsessed with the stock SSTI, it’s a very fun stock
Depending how many options you have and what your percent gain is you could dump 50% of your profits and or exercise some of the rest to keep shares and then let the house money ride. Lets say you had 4 contracts at 200% profit meaning 3x you could dump 1 keep 1 exercise one?
This happened in 2017 same time of year too
Was considering going all in before it mooned at all as well but was too hesitant due to 80% of shares being outstanding to dump on retail again. Buying after a huge run up is ballsy. Hope it works out for you man and you get to 7 figures here.

Uvxy is not a company.

The key problem here is that since UVXY is holding these futures contract which are heavily exposed to convergence, it is consistently losing money. For example, as we have already discussed, a strong 72% of all months see losses – and the odds of losses just increase with holding duration.

We have already had 4 major spikes this year.  You really think we are going to have another?

I think VIX will continue to decrease and Uvxy with it
Not that it should matter- they sold 12000 cars and that makes them worth more than Ford.
Yeah, it's not a lot, lmao the percentage is just a personal record for me. I know many other made much more off the drop in terms of dollar value.
Except when it went from 100 to 200 in a couple months 🤷

Calisthenics can only get so you far. Muscle needs resistance. If you want to look somewhat muscular but not like a bodybuilder then full body workout are good enough. 

I never deadlift or squat. I just find them too taxing and intense. I train like a bodybuilder, I’d rather isolate my muscle with machines since I just care about aesthetics and not strength or functionality carrying over to the real world.

So is NIO trading somewhere else in the world right now?
Some dude was asking about working out and I told him all you really need to do is. Bench, overhead press, squat, rows, and cardio. Hits all the muscle groups and you’ll still look good (not bodybuilder style but still). Then this fruitcake came in and said you should substitute the bench for pushups. He also suggested deadlifts which I told him not everyone can do, even with good form. And he said then you can’t do squats if you can’t deadlift. Who’s right in your opinion. Bench or pushups? And no deadlift = no squat?

Irrelevant and current price isn't going to reflect past data and it never will, it'll adjust to the current trend that's the cold truth and exactly what you're seeing. If yall believe it'll continue its uptrend, diamond hand it you have a fair amount of time and if it does continue going up by 20 you should turn a profit eventually.

Wonder who it could be 🤔
I don’t mind bagholding, though I would like to know if you think opening with a covered put first or simply buying the shares is better.
It'll tank at open
Do warrants not have decay or am I retarded
Are options chains the same across brokers?  
I tried to see how much I would get for selling covered calls on Robinhood for $4.5 1/15 for TRVN, this shitty penny stock that hasn't done anything and it was giving me $675 which is a fucking lot for me.

But my shares are in WellsFargo (wellstrade). I go over there to try to sell the exact same calls and it's giving me like $40 or some shit.
I live for it tbh
You are correct sir
Gonna start fomoing into bitchcoin like I should have in fucking June
The thing.
Lies!
Hi
May I introduce you to a Chinese company called XPEV

Basically you put down a bunch of bullshit to promote one stock. It's a bunch of 1/2 truths or 1/2 understanding, hard to tell which. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if you're a paid pumper based on the construction of the post.
Y not just get spy puts instead
Can you tell me how bad my NIO puts will do tmr?
Their earnings are coming up and the CEO just announced that he's hetero af, so it's a good time to get in.
Risky af
Nah he tried to one up shithead from Citron. Nice try mutha fucker
Upvote if you’re excited for market open tomorrow

Well looks like the general consensus around here is RIOT calls at open. Fuck it I’m in
Will probably pull back a tad tomorrow... but it’s not out the realm of possibility 

Fuck it... YOLO
Anybody playing Boeing calls?
They’ll be here full swing tomorrow for the NIO IV.
So palantir still gonna soar even though soros headline?
Wtf is going on with shitcoin? Feeling serious FOMO rn
I got some IVR lotto tickets. It's been going up slowly since earnings
Come to find out this place has a surprising amount of intelligent informative posters pretending to be retarded.
I simply cannot
If I count the 30% I've still got I'm back to even overall. I guess I should just be happy for the free entertainment.

Bough 5 calls before close

YES. PLTR. Plenty lots to rake.
So wouldnt tsla automatically go up cause the owners of spy have to buy a shit ton of shares
I hate astrology, but I like the dopamine rush reading the word moon.
I’m 70% sure I’m going to jump on it
I don't think anyone expected the sudden rush. I think I'll start adding some lottos to the farms
Too late.  How do I get it out?
DKNG calls. Seriously.
I went into r/unemployment and it’s pretty dire. I’m here bitching about why my 25k come up on NIO should be more and they’re struggling to buy toilet paper.
Is theta gang here?
Yep
Spy puts.  Thinking of buying at open
God damn people are stupid.
*RIOT
Haha and marathon. I imagine any chain stock if this rally continues.
Why gamble against the odds?
Suck a DUCK 😘
What are y’all buying at market open? Just sold solo and wanna hop onto something
at this rate, shitcoin is the best bet
Yep.
I did start of today, slow bastards you lot are
When do the funds start buying the shares?
No Soros fucked us
Covid 19 cases, investors moving into emerging markets and no additional stimulus till further notices

PLTR calls
If you’re contract is a $30 call and the stock price is $40 on the day of expiration at market close you will be paid $10 x 100 shares per contract. That’s what an options contract is. That’s why is has any value at all
Its called automation
Ellos no saben
It's not as lucrative but yes, that would theoretically work and net you some $$.

Gotta be prepared to baghold if the stock drops though.
I struggled with this too. But if your investing circa 1k you don’t even account for a drop in the bucket. “But what are we if not a bucket of drops” - Cloud Atlas. Ok I know, I’m a POS

Will get it in PM if 💩coin keeps pumping when I wake up, also dont forget there are gonna be 1 million of autistic retards thinking the same, so what ever you dont be last when music stops!
To be honest you should take that money and invest in index fund, I wouldn’t risk it in options unless you can absolutely afford to lose the money and even then no more than 5-10-% of your assets.
Shrek is love shrek is lifeeee

How did you get to the point where you had $90,000 to spare? I’m young dumb and broke. Help.
This is not a thing. Are you guys serious?  Read up about how options work. If you’re in the money you don’t need a buyer. Whoever sold the option to open has to exercise the option for you.
You’re nuts. Good luck!

This 'why' is key.
The Coverdell educational IRA is an incredible tool for tax free gains to pay for college.  If you can day trade it enough to pay tuition and not reduce the principal you’re golden.  Granted you can’t play options and it’s a cash account but you can do this.

Yeah cheap calls and options I buy even if the stock isn’t traveling in that direction atm.
I think it'll still test 461 again soon and may break out or get rejected
don't give up yet, as much as I hope its the ev trios for my short positions, we wont know until tomorrow, but it can be big, they have been advertise this one since last week, it was supposed to drop on monday got postponed
Letssss goooooooooopooooop
Hard to say, people might have DRIP on and the stock might actually go up
I made it a rule of mine.

Sell puts or covered call, collect the premiums.

Then only use the premiums to buy options. That way, only house money is used and it prevents being too overinvested. Any profits from these are used to buy stock.

Repeat the cycle.

It's almost like a wheel, but has the premiums gained to buy options.
If you don’t put excess O’s at the end of “lmao”, I don’t like you lol
Both Mara and Riot are high atm, but if poopcoin keeps pumping Tommorow, those 2 are easy swing!

OSTK.
I want to see those massive gains ASAP! I also want to see BA go to 325+ before May 2021.
Also means no more extra high tech valuations. The economy doesn't just add back all of the airlines and industrial capacity without shifting away from tech, even if not to the extent it was before

The MM make you think nothing can go wrong until the pull the rug under you for a month straight. Have you forgotten September and October ?
After careful analysis of bear comments, NIO is supposed to drop tomorrow because... it’s overbought. We beat EPS and had a nice CC. Yes, you will get IV crushed tomorrow if you bought options this week. But I’m feeling a 15% day tomorrow and that should offset it. Right before market close NIO went into an uptrend. I listened to the CC afterwards and no questions stumped them. I assume this trend carries into tomorrow. Sell tomorrow, Thursday and Friday are unpredictable. But tomorrow is 🟢🟢🟢

Now it's one of those stocks I just don't play because I feel I've missed out, but good luck man judging by today you have about a 50% chance of that happening.

$20 is the floor, if no target is found it gets returned to the shareholders. Huge investors are already in for up to like $400M w/ a total of 4B+ . Bill Ackman is very well known/respected in the space. I'm in with a massive position in calls because I see it as somewhat low risk.
*Winning*
Haha we still out here. What happened to TrenAndOptions? Had a better ring to it
important question how long do we hold pltr
Fake news. I saw santa partying in assless chaps in south beach.
Yeah it’s great lol
Lol why do y’all always catch on to the moves too late? RIOT was the move in the 3 range not now that it’s at 6
I can’t wait for nio to crash tomorrow.
That’s not a fucking leap that’s less than 2 months away

how high is it?
It was already a meme stock. Where were you bro lol
Is this actually gonna drive the price down ? Kinda does hurt the brand a little bit.
It's likely due to Covid and everyone and their grandmamas being forced to eat at home on the West Coast because all the restaurants are barely open, if at all. Safeway stores used to be so much better in many ways, before the merger with Albertson's. Now Safeway has $5.99 boxes of cereal.

It is 1/5 of my down payment funds. I YOLO'd a chunk in NIO as well.
PLTR had a direct public offering, doesn’t have all the big advertising and underwriter hype up of an ipo
Papa Elon tweeted to buy it
I saw bears getting fuk by Santa Claus underneath the mistletoe last night
FCEL really kept strong today, wondering if there's gonna be a breakout tomorrow 🤔
I don't think people play the high spread with day trading, I think that's more an algo thing.

When I'm day trading I'm watching patterns for runners that look like they'll go 10% or more and usually scalp on the momentum.

We're already limited to 3 day trades in 5 rolling days, unless you mean something else?
I'd buy a SOLO aint nobody got those around LA yet
Hold. It's hard for me to see major downside, and there are so many events that can push it up. I regret selling my LUV leaps for the same type of gain because there was so much more room to run on travel.

Both the knowledge of personal finance and the knowledge of yoloing all the money I acquired on personal finance towards something stupid (though I feel like the latter can be learned through browsing this sub)
Only lesson you'll be learning is how gay you are
I feel like BABA is luring call holders in one last time. I hope not though. Just seems extra fuckitty, snake-in-the-grass like. I also was so close to getting a 300c leap. So I'm just salty. Watch it rip

No but close
But is a cuck for snowflake?
Damn, all those option contracts got clapped that day.. I dont know exactly what happened but it could be that insane 3 day insane runup prior that made contracts increase 3x in value from 11/3-11/9 -- but in terms of something quantifiable, im not exactly sure.
omg why did AMZN fuck us so hard
In addition to March PLTR calls I guess I'll get a few RIOT lottery calls to appease you guys
I mean god damn that sounds like exactly what will happen

Just personally not fucking with this anymore until the it breaks out of the consolidation
RIOT
Not as bad as how the Trump 2020 re election went so in reality this is doing just fine with my profits and low quality memes!  More to come because haters are like Tesla short players.  GAY BEAR bois party!

WHAT? I thought he was selling, the fck is this? What is this even a statement he would make?
Upvoted because at least this helps me sleep better tonight
Can’t open up a robinhood account till your 18 though
Genuinely curious why people here have so much faith in PLTR, what is so “fail proof” about it?
There was literally someone here a few weeks ago that had an option that was so far in the money he was having a hard time selling it

And $10 ITM when the underlying is $40 is not that unrealistic

I did that with SOLO yesterday. I knew they were EV and was just swing trading off hype but then I actually went and looked at the vehicle and sold everything at open today lol
Yeah airline/cruise line have been diluted like hell and they have a worst balance sheet than CNK but they have the same YTD performance (-60%). Make no sense. AMC drag us down, people need to understand that CNK is not AMC.

[This earnings report](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/17/2128703/0/en/NIO-Inc-Reports-Unaudited-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html) has details. Granted I can't read so it's all scribbles to me but someone out there does understand these markings and made after-hours financial moves based on 'em. If there's any silver lining it's the fact NIO didn't completely tank so I guess whatever those scribbles say isn't **THAT** bad. I predict it'll be kinda flat tomorrow.
So buy thermafreeze got it!
LMFAOOO yeah ok and NIO is gonna be $60 tomorrow

Yeah, those are the facts, but you probably made OP feel even worse.
I got some advice that some family members are too old and don’t have enough money to really benefit. My parents have the target date fund set but my dad has tripled his salary in the last three years so he’s come by a lot of extra money to invest that I use to spice up a retirement portfolio because he’s still <50
He is the chosen one!

This comment is underrated. My man speaking gospel - minority/majority rule

🖕🏻 the suits
What you learn here is not to be too uptight about money, or too uptight about a lot of things for that matter. Seriously, that's been huge for me. This sub's attitude is legit inspiring. Part of that process has been doing stupid shit based on what I saw here + my own retardation, being bummed out afterward, then getting over it, learning good object lessons, and moving on to the next play. And I think you can absorb a lot just being part of the conversation, throwing out stupid ideas and getting called on your bullshit, then having to defend your actually good ideas and refining your own approach when people shit on it, which they will.

In fairness, I'm spending money I don't need in order to get by on a day-to-day basis. I'm not dipping into margin, YOLOing my 401k, or putting student loans in my Robinhood account. It's like alcohol; it's a lot of fun, you can get pumped up by it, and sometimes there's a nasty hangover, but some people just can't use it without totally wrecking their lives.
If one of the EV trio combo gets attacked the other two will drop as well, so plz dont be BABA..

In Portugal I was cardiologist
Odd. I thought I read somewhere immunity was limited.
My experience is that when a trade goes bad you're more incentivized to hold it if you don't have any day trades or settled cash left, so now you're bag holding shares that could go back into the market for liquidity. And, if you're able to make more trades you'll be adding more liquidity overall. So in my opinion it would raise liquidity.
Who is your broker? I would assume that Australian indexes also have futures. But if you can trade US equities and indexes you should also be able to trade the ES

Bears: They're already beyond what they're actually worth at the moment. That doesn't mean they shouldn't be worth $50+ a share in the future, just not now. So it could possibly go down to 25 or 30 in the next week or so. 


Bulls: NIO is definitely gonna be worth a fuckton within a year or two. Buy now while it's still cheap. 


Realistically, it probably just trade flat for awhile. Maybe until they start selling in Europe in 2021.
Don’t be a greedy little bastard, take your tendies and get out.

I have 600 of the OI on the PSX 11/20 $75c that I've effectively lost $100k on unless there's a miracle. Bought them 3 months ago

Also have 110 of the OI on the PSX 12/18 $65c that I'm hoping will cover that loss, I bought them pretty cheap 2 days ago on the morning dip (at like $59?) and they're up 250% but I'm holding until $75 or more

There's different pieces in the oil sector, I hate that they're grouped together. These guys are refiners, which means they don't make money on crude oil. They make money on the crack spread. They are the ones who consume crude oil. They make MORE profit when oil is cheaper

End of the month OPEC has a meeting and will announce more cuts, also covid vaccine news pumps there the most. VLO went up 30% last Monday, PSX was up 25% or something. Both are up like 45% or some shit in 7 trading days. PSX just crossed it's 200 day moving average today

Kroger has a market cap of $8,981,818.18 per store.

Albertson's has a market cap of $3,277,087.03 per store.

Hmm.
PLTR has really high IV right now I’d imagine, you could probably make a good profit selling weeklies. But if it blows way past your strike you might be sad that you capped your gains.

Not just taxes. The FTC is going to fuck them up. 36% of all economic profit is going to the top 1% of companies (AMZN, GOOG, FB, etc.). A new regulatory agency will be created to regulate Big Tech antitrust abuses.

Mine rules are to only sell cash covered 30-delta ~45DTE puts on high volume index funds, the total of which not to exceed my cash buying power. Sell to close order at 50% premium. Stick to the plan. Make respectable gains.

Then... at 15:30 the same day, panic at the massive (5-10% unrealized, my god,  the horror) loss on my open puts, hastily close them all at a loss. Go full angry retard in quick retrospect at that decision and decide that the only  way left to regain my loss is to YOLO 50-75% of my portfolio on waaaay OTM < 3DTE weeklies, manage to miss the closing bell for whatever reason to take it all back, refresh futures and surf stocktwits until early morn hoping for a miracle.
Based on their 2020 score card, it's dumping back to 12k tomorrow.

Tsla always beats and sells off after earnings without fail. Nio beat, it was expecting a big beat.  I knew itd beat. It would be “YHUUGE” but investors would still make it sell off. Now i believe that the dip was bought but it didnt seem too bad because AH has almost no volume. Which can move the price one way or another. Now heres what i think will happen tomorrow morning itll moon ppl think think itll keep going off but bears will come in and drive it down. Plus technicals show its way too over extended. All that and i wAnt to buy back in😂

Right with you, Jan calls have been bleeding an inordinate amount, losing more to IV falling than anything it seems. That feels like a great time to average down though, probably going to roll them out a bit as well. We aren’t catching this knife right now
How fucked are my TSLA 465c 11/20 :/
You can tell we still have more to climb because there’s still a good portion of Bears here that think puts is free money. At the real top all the bears will be wiped out long before then.

It's a double edged sword.  On one hand you will make decisions with the marlet and generally won't do something that will lose you tons of money.  Bad side is you probably won't do anything that will make you a ton of money, either.  The most profitable trades are the ones that the least people see.
Feels good
Nope she got clapped today. Something about not being able to properly fuck puts
So is PLTR the new TSLA? Can we all agree to put 100% of our portfolio in it and have it at $500 within a month or two?

Because NIO ded

Chinese shills just rotating through the ghyna stocks.  This is Reddit after all
Remember when you couldn't buy toilet paper in March/April?

Imagine if you could buy a contract for a roll of toilet paper.  If you hold this contract, exercising the contract at the market guarantees you a roll of toilet paper for $1. 

 Pre-COVID, nobody would want to buy these contracts because the price of a roll of toilet paper is expected to stay at $1 - and nobody expects it to be any more or less.  The price to buy a $1 call might have been $1.01.  $1 intrinsic value and $0.01 premium.

Fast forward - COVID hits.  There's a lot of anxiety and toilet paper seems to be what everyone is worried about.  It's still trading for $1 per roll, but the sense of panic has people willing to pay $5 for a contract that guarantees a roll of toilet paper for $1. $1 intrinsic value and $4 of premium. 

The media starts to cover the toilet paper hysteria.  More people are drawn into it.  More people want to buy contracts to protect their asses (pun intended).  The cost to buy a $1 call is now going for $20. $1 intrinsic value and $19 premium. They buy it because they think the price of toilet paper at the market \*could\* jump up to $1000 per role.

(I know it's not the best analogy, but stay with me).

You spend $20 to buy one of these contracts with the intent to sell it for more money.  Time passes and the hype starts to fade away.  The market is now selling rolls for $2, but the sense of panic/FOMO is completely gone.  You can't get more than $2.01 for your contract (which you paid $20 for).  The market price of toilet paper went up, but you lost $18.  What happened?

IV Crush.

The fear of the unknown drove up the premiums.  The amount of panic determined the cost of the premiums.  Panic can be fear of losing money, or FOMO - fear of missing out on gains.  IV is used to characterize the forecasted movement.  High IV means big movement is forecasted.  Low IV means low movement is forecasted.

IV gets really high around binary events (i.e. earnings release).  Something good is about to be announced, or something bad is going to be announced.  Everyone wants to buy options - so the premiums go up.  After the announcement, the interest in options drops significantly - so if you were holding one, good luck trying to find someone to buy it off you for the price you paid...now that panic is gone.

 A Bear walks into a casino.

On his way to the roulette table he passes a Bull. The Bull has so many chips he can barely carry them all. The Bull says to the Bear “Psst, the roulette tables rigged. It always lands on Black.”

The Bear nods and makes his way to the roulette table.

Sitting at the table is another Bull. The bear can hardly see the Bull who is buried behind a fat stack of chips. The Bull says to the Bear, “Psst, this table is rigged. It’ll land on black every time.”

The Bear gives a thumbs up and exchanges cash with the dealer for some chips.

The dealer says to the Bear, “Welcome to the table, my name is Jerome. It’s your lucky night, because I’ve rigged the table for everyone and it absolutely ALWAYS lands on black.”

With a sly wink and a smile, Jerome says “So, Mr Bear, where should I place your chips?”

The Bear winks back knowingly and says, “Red”.

It lands on black.

The Bear bets on red again, "THIS IS FUCKING RIGGED!"

Why do people keep commenting about shitcoin when 99% of those commenting can’t afford it
you know it mooned from $1 to $5 right?
Weeklys r for day trading
Your position is off by .01% to be the correct diversification....

Your main position should always be 69.420%
soros is the anti christ
!remindme 11/20
Yes
He prolly doubles his money and then withdrew 99.999% of his initial investment. Robinhood is buggy and there’s no way he got over 2 million percent return
And then you out 90k in it. This is the way
My 1/2022 calls can attest
I would guess so right?

Not sure the exact trade volume percentage for it but I imagine people do tend to trade on the wider spread and volatile stocks.
This is the correct response
Haha damn I’ve only been here since august but where have you been? It’s been like at least a month since I’ve seen you post
I did too an avgd down on my leaps
Yup. I find Facebook to be far more of a concern to democracy in the USA than Palantir.
It shot up from almost 2% down
Unaudited quarterly reports are normal. Tesla quarterly reports were unaudited.

Think after positive earnings with bought up sell offs the 3 days prior. All with higher lows. We could see a retest of that high. Like if I’m big money I’m looking to get out before retail is smart enough to take profit at a meaningful scale so 52 or so probably? Or I guess they could let it pump even past ath and get retail to become euphoric again. Get to like 58-60 and then rug pull hard as fuck 😂

Yes, the buying for the S&P needs about 10-12% or so of the current float, and it's likely they'll ease out of the companies being moved to the Midcap 400 and ease into the new Tesla position over time, probably over the course of several days to maybe even a week or two. There will be buying pressure but it probably won't be some huge spike because of the more gradual balancing.

Not a NIO bear, but shit sells off sometimes bro. Even things that moon don't always go up in a straight line. Doesn't even need to be some concrete reason or analysis, just depends on sentiment and what the money starts to do
Live cattle been on a ripper the past month. Strong support @ 110
Position or ban
This is a good point. I had MSFT 180c expiring in 2022. Getting fills that far down and that far away is harder. I sold and rolled it up to 220c 2022.
HBO is a tiny tiny piece of T.
Kid doesn’t drink often or do any real drugs, more “stable” than me in that regard. But yeah don’t underestimate platinum-grade hash rosin. Or do, this is WSB, fuck around and find out...

You think getting rid of PDT would kill liquidity?
I'm not. It's funny tho. Lol.
haha poopydoodoo
Just checked my crystal ball and no man no dip incoming, sorry for your lost
I play them two ways. When a long term stock goes up fast, and I think I can’t believe it’s so high, I sell calls to lock in gains (kinda). 

Or when a stock is more volatile than I would typically want to hold but I see a juicy dip, I’ll buy shares and sell ATM calls knowing it’s likely my shares get called away at expiration. I’m satisfied with the premium as profit.
Like turning in fellow Jews to Nazis.

That’s like saying hey guys remember when Infinity War came out?
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway could be scooping up shares of a certain company secretly. Its quarterly 13F regulatory filing released Monday evening had a line that stated "confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report." The last time the conglomerate used this confidential provision was in 2015 when it bought Phillip 66.

You have a better chance renting them your used underwear.
I was scared as well, but it was announced  during trading hours, priced in. Big nothing burger.
They don’t have any logic they are just hoping because they bought puts.
The newest one is PLTR. It's a triple digit stock for $17🚀🚀🚀
Get a mole trap place it by your fruits and wait
and said coin will continue to go up due to jpow's printer for the foreseeable future
Calls or shares?
You forgot TSLA
Agreed. All the good news is fixed in & dry now.
The other retards. Can’t believe they don’t mask the dogs! What a shame! Those dogs should be thrown in jail like they did the hoomans. Unless the retards think dogs have more rights than hoomans?
Both mostly puts
It’s nothing serious I was just making a jokey joke about pumping up Robinhood IPO and a bunch of people saw the post apparently and were upvoting it and they warned me that it is gonna get removed
I posted about it but the comment was removed by auto mod. Lancadia will become golden nugget online gaming by the end of the month, ticker symbol will be the first letter of those four words. For now it's trading as Lima Charlie Alpha, there are also warrants. It's legit and I'm not entirely clear why auto mod is blocking it. Ninety percent revenue growth with their online gaming business in New Jersey, which will expand to Michigan at the start of 2021. How this sub can post non-stop about nkla or sketchy Chinese companies or weed stocks, but not this, is beyond me.
Lmfaoooooo bro
I actually won't say because I'm a good wage slave.
You’ve become the very thing you swore to destroy.
The real question is what kind of house are you buying if the down payment is 90k?

Godspeed autist.

take $1000 to the casino, make 10%, leave, come back the next day, make 10% of $1100, leave, repeat daily, seems easier than options

When’s the last time he posted?
What happened to posting positions or ban, right?
Open him an account on a real brokerage and sell naked calls
It was just speculation. I am not 100% certain that was the reason (I don't think anyone is), but if you compare tech vs value stocks, the techs all dipped on Nov 9 when PFE's vaccine news was released. 

You can probably make educated guesses as to why this was the case. $BABA, like $AMZN, is a COVID stock. It performs well under COVID and this was evident during their earnings releases - so per speculation, I believe this was why $BABA dropped from 299 -> 290. 

$MRNA also released their vaccine results yesterday and tech did another dip yet again, but quickly recovered. But should tech be frightened due to COVID vaccines? Well PFE's vaccine news was pretty unexpected and value stocks had massive surges, but sector rotation ended rather quickly which I think the investors caught on. Tech came back and value stocks dropped. People are starting to realize that vaccine, even though it's great news for society and value stocks, we are not certain when we will actually be able to get back to status quo. Until then, techs will continue to dominate. As such, the good news of vaccines will have lesser and lesser impact on the stock market. Come vaccine news and its resounding efficacy brings other foreseen, yet unaccounted problems like, distribution and logistics, people fearing the authenticity of vaccines results, approval and timeline and most importantly, resulting business recovery.

The $MRNA's news on Monday could have partially impacted $BABA's stock performance, but I think the main culprit is still clear as $BABA is continuing to depreciate post vaccine release: the CCP. CCP can crush any Chinese businesses at any given time and people are fearful of what Xi might do to $BABA after what Jack Ma had said. 

My personal opinion is that $BABA is still here to stay. $BABA increases China's annual GDP by 4.8% and attracts so many foreign customers and investors alike. It also helps them find other Chinese stocks like NIO, GSX, LI, XPEV, etc. Further, it helps fight US e-commerce giants like $AMZN and $EBAY. $BABA is here to stay, but still, people are fearful. Give it time, and fear will disappear. CCP will not let $BABA fall, but they just wanted to show Jack Ma who's actually in charge here so that he can take better precautions and not snub the Chinese government going forward.

What are you talking about?  If you don’t like money that’s up to you man.
went long at 3602.75 stopped out at 3602.25. im done trading tonight. i told myself not to trade this bullshit low volume session and i traded anyways. disappointed in my discipline.
Great timing
Stocks go up more than they go down. If you buy a ton of calls every week you'll be right more than you are wrong. Especially lately
Yes. Ask.
This corn is insane.
You are probably not wrong

I want them to buy my NIO calls now
Ah, gotcha
Look here you little fucker. Don’t be sharing our secrets
Minutely NIO confirmation bias
I just checked mango's twitter for the first time in ages. Did he really say that the stock market is close to 30,000? Does he know there are literally 30 stonks in the dow? That's hilarious
it can go down a bit before December i set an alert at 400 so I can buy 😐🤔
I sold a strangle. Can’t wait for the loss porn to start pouring in. Fuck NIO.

I sold mine in the great fuckening right before the election. Rebought after the election and I'm up 125% on them after today but had I just held and not been a beta I woulda been up like 8k instead of 800

So, the CEO of UVXY decided that my kids don't eat this week...
Why does that matter? She probably has never known what a Fortnite skin is at any point in her life.
Spy calls
What fucking lesson? We have a generation of dumbass boomers who believe Jesus answers their prayers if the share the right jpeg on facebook. Nobody is learning some deep moral code from public policy. The government isn't in the job of "teaching lessons", it's there to make sure too many folks aren't starving in the streets. 

We convinced a bunch of kids that college education was the necessity of a good life and then mandated it with astronomical costs paid for by loans their tiny little dorm room fucking and coors lights obsessed brains couldn't even begin to comprehend. 

Wipe that shit away and nobody will be worse off for it except for some loan sharks. Congrats on repaying yours, good work, well done, but you going through it doesn't mandate anyone else has to either. Their benefit is not your loss.
What is more retarded?

Bro. No one cares
Nio 70c 3/19/2021. Seems lofty but I think they'll print regarding the constant uptrend, positive earnings today, as well as huge announcements for NIO in the future. 150 kWh battery will be integrated into the nio line and the expected 900km range for the battery will crush all Chinese competition. With that, the increasing number of NIO houses, battery swap stations, as well as stores in Europe opening I think we're going to the moon. With that, nio is expected to do 34% more production in Q4.  Citron fucks don't stand a chance, NIO has resistance at 40, and we WILL break 52 by the end of the week. Hopefully, the pre-market money printer will go brrrrr tomorrow and we can make some sweet tendies.

When people ask if I've made a profit trading options, it's really a tricky question. If we're talking strictly $USD, then no, I've lost it all. But if we're talking life lessons, gambling addiction, an unhealthy porn and drug/alcohol habit to deal with the stress, and constant latent anxiety about my finances, then yes, I've made a pretty substantial profit.

He also moved the company out of silicon valley and into Denver to get away from the Big Tech groupthink.

TV volume is high.



He just kinda slurres his words, I think.
What does it matter though? I’ve said all along, since 2008, They put their hands in the cookie jar and now they can’t take it out. 

And if they ‘have’ to take it out eventually, the entire world monetary system will be fucked so stonk prices will be the least of our worries lol. This is only going two ways in the long run....Up (with dips) or Fucked beyond repair.
I have a December put that I’m holding on to because why not at this point. Either I’m losing the remaining 40% or it’s going to pop off. Resigned to fate at this point.

I don’t disagree with you on the fact that this won’t be a good long term play. I do think though that this can definitely be a good short term play because PFE is about to announce EUA any day now and that’ll drive the stock price over 70 in my opinion. Clearly the market is extremely bullish on any vaccine news, so CVS calls may be a good vaccine play.
Glad you enjoyed! Still up but dozing off. Oof you’re more ballsy than me with the meat. I aim for a solid medium.

Let’s go bro. Will suck ur dick if ur calls print
My recent strategy is extremely risky so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without a sizable principal and time. It's basically understanding the intraday support/resistance levels to start a position. Average down at every support and sell at first resistance for profit. When translating the sup/res levels to the option pricing, some times they're literally by the spread. That's what I meant by scalping.

It's very common to bounce between -10, -6, -1% so your stomach will hurt depending on how much capital is involved. I'm not the type to hold&pray for FDs overnight, so this worked for me.

Damn that sucks that EV dip fucked me up too I lost 30k on hylion and I’m down for the year
Yeah itll probably cruise up more but it doesn't seem like it's the big boys consolidating. Seems like this is smaller fish picking up the scraps and when the big boys decide to really sell we will all feel it.
How do you pick the strike price you are comfortable with

Try 30k to 1.3 first. You'll fuck it up and still have 9 more attempts at it. If all goes to plan and you pull it off repeatedly you can fuck my wife
It’s a white kid lmao. Family of muts
Fundamentals? Who knows. I guess gigantic ongoing government deficit spending is good for a company that thrives on government contracts.

Their loss, which is huge, is driven entirely by absurd levels of stock based compensation which aren't that unusual in companies around IPO time. But Palantir is one of the worst I've ever seen.

Their voting structure for shares is fucking toxic.

But, it's got the early momentum on its side which is often all that matters in these big nonsensical run-ups.
I got the 40c Feb,21. I think CRSR products are gonna be flying off the digital shelves when holiday shopping ramps up and that’ll be reflected in Q4 earnings.

I might have dumped tsla too soon, idk, i thought it would moon more and it didn’t so I dumped it.

I regret closing my nio puts but I thought it would tank hard after earnings. I’d sold 11/20 40p last week and was way down on it till Monday so I was just happy to get out alive.

Didn’t expect Nio to stay pretty much flat. You’re probably good with the 45p

Dear mRNA vaccine companies:

this is less of a vaccine than a potion to make your own cells into a vaccine factory, and there’s no long term data, and covid has low mortality rate, and i wear N95 in public, and for that reason Im out... but i will prob be forced into taking it at work :(
I wish they would just kill it out of mercy at this point. 

Rick and Morty could have ended after season 2. I would have wanted more but that was a good stopping point. Almost think they should have done that. So far they have managed to keep it good though. But always err on ending too soon and not selling out.

Care to explain?
Hope you took profits
Depends on your long term analysis on it. If you think this is going to the fking moon, 200 @ 13 is going to net more profit than exercising that option on Friday. If you can't wait that long or dont want too, than exercise. Keep in mind that you are not going to YOLO this stock on shares unless you have a large volume (1000+) and you either got in early (like the retards with NIO did at single digits) or the stock price is a rocketship to the fking moon.
Fun fact, he sold you his calls

My point is more about his comment "market is market", making it sound like it is simple and based on some foundation. If that were the case today, we would be trading on fundamentals and p/e ratios. There is a lot of shit that goes on behind the scenes also. That is all I'm saying.

Your generation blamed your parents for messing up the world. It’s an endless cycle. Clearly you are upset from making some poor decisions in the market. It’s not like it used to be and never will. Adapt, or die.
Except it sort of is. You walk into a Walmart or Target and they already know what you are going to buy. They know everything
This one was triggered by shorts covering but my big long term picture is as the other issues rise the upcoming pull back will cause a drop In riot I plan to add to my longs at that point. Factoring in hyper inflation the other issues could go full on parabolic. Pushing riot higher I expect riot to peak sept of next year

Look at it's last earnings (the one 3 months ago) It just sank for weeks and months.  Yes it just has a good run but new competition is now priced in.  Amazon is gonna wreck rx medication sales.  What's easier, sending in the antibiotic to be mailed same day by Amazon?  Or sitting in some shitty drive through at CVS.

Sure they can't deliver pain killers etc, but the majority of prescriptions aren't controlled substances.

Finally, new vaccine may pump income for a while but long term this booomer stonk is dead.

I use Trade Ideas Pro for my scanner. And if you have a smaller account something awesome to do to sell contracts is something called a spread. It’s like an insurance policy on your selling so that you don’t necessarily have to have the 100 shares to cover or the cash on hand

That's a stretch. I'll be happy with $270 by next week.
Absolutely, and I can’t stress this enough, never ever question anything WSB says to do
Think about the intrinsic value and the potential value
I agree Tesla is headed to 500, my only question is when to get back into options. If it hits 400 again, 500c for March if a no brainer
how much for the 3080

I'm always amazed when China is actually green. Dumping is like tradition over there.
It's not TA tho, it's just sentiment and trends. Normally people will put buy and sell orders in at notable levels.

Also TA sorta becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy since algos use it.

except there is no loss porn. Earnings report = Nio doing great, closing on Tesla, which is what everyone expected. The Chinese EV stocks have all the time in the world

Tesla is going down. Even [a US automaker (GM) is outselling it in China](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-cars-china-sales-double-october-2020-tesla-trails/). TSLA sold 12K cars in China in October. NIO sold 5K and its production is still accelerating.
Not a whisper about BA calls, mine are safe for now
Don't buy into obvious pump and dumps and short them instead. MMs aren't forcing you to buy at strikes that are likely to get pinned, do your research. Don't see how Softbank is taking money from you by buying a shit ton of calls, follow the trend.

You are free to make the same plays the big boys are making. The tiny percentage Robinhood scalps off your orders only matters for HFT or extremely active day traders.

the scientists create mRNA that codes for the virus’s spike protein.  they take that mRNA and coat it in oily shit so it will get into the cells, in the cells the mRNA directs the production and display on the cell surface of something resembling the virus’s spike protein.  The immune system sees this foreign protein and declares war on it.  The person feels hungover and sick and feverish as the immune system is amped up.  They give two shots to really get this process going.  After the initial battles against this protein, antibodies are created which circulate in the blood, so when you get exposed to Rona, the antibodies bind to the Rona inactivating its infectivity or something.  How long the antibodies last or your body remembers how to make them is unknown.  But one week after the second dose like 10x less people caught Cerveza sickness than the ones that got fake shot.  Questions for me are what happens if your body has other proteins that get targeted by your immune system so you get some autoimmune disease or cancer or for real autistic or something. Also, does this process kill the cells that take up mRNA and cause problems.  How long do the cells with mRNA have the mRNA and what else can it do?  Conspiracy theorists also believe an undisclosed microchip will be in the shot.  etc etc etc

JKS been going the wrong way since 10/23; tomorrow will be no exception (sorry).  They have ER pre-open 11/20 (options are hella cheap right now) but also not likely to survive at whatever spike to close based on every other ER lately.  Just my guess.

🍉=🍑=👨‍❤️‍👨
No, absolutely not. Basically you almost never exercise your calls, for many reasons. You sell them before expiration, hopefully for a profit. Also you don't just buy "the cheapest one possible" but one that makes sense, to you at least. There's a reason why they are cheap.
Easiest thing for you to do is just get your feet wet, find one priced at something you could afford to lose, expiring in at least 30 days, and see what happens. Try to sell it for a profit.

Basically the intrinsic value of an option is $1 for every $0.01 the underlying moves from the strike price.
Guess you’re gonna have to pay out of pocket using your escort money lol

“We are very close to submitting for an emergency use authorization,” Bourla said during the STAT Summit, which this year is a virtual event. Bourla sidestepped the question of whether Pfizer’s filing would be made this week.
“Let us not create expectations,” he said in conversation with STAT’s Matthew Herper. “We will announce it as soon as we are doing it.”

Soon could still be a week and next Thursday is Thanksgiving which will probably slow it down at least a day or two. Approval will take at least 2 to 4 weeks. Lilly didn't receive Emergency approval for over a month.

Unity. I honestly think at some point big studios like Bethesda will realize they can’t make an engine and a game and they’ll decide to use a third party engine like unity. Think about fallout 76 and imagine a world in which Bethesda put all their effort into the story and dialogue and just outsourced a non buggy engine. That’s the future I’m envisioning 

Plus buggy engines are one of the biggest issues ruining large studios reputations right now, being able to blame another company is easy PR. It would definitely require a giant dynamic switch, but over the course of years as one studio then another makes the switch.
Thats strange. It's pretty common in this sub

no shit, buy when the market opens
But Pfizer's report on Monday -- that it's vaccine was more than 90% effective -- was preliminary data. It wasn't the information the company needs to send to the FDA to seek an EUA.
The FDA has said it wants companies to wait for two weeks after about half their volunteers have received a second dose of vaccine before they apply for that emergency authorization -- and the doctors running the clinical trials will have needed to tally about 100 more validated cases of coronavirus infection to meet the company's goals for showing the vaccine actually works.

Corey pointed out that it took more than four weeks for the FDA to consider an application by Eli Lilly and Co., for its monoclonal antibody therapy. Lilly applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization on October 7 and received it on November 9.
Let is settle after the dilution fam. You might get a better entry this week. Or next if the market unwinds after OpEx.

Someone posted a screenshot of the yahoo NIO forums this week... Was pretty nostalgic for me from back when I was playing with penny sticks in college before I learned about IHub
If your scared go to church
This episode is from 2001. But It’s not great— you can tell from watching this clip that it’s from the era where the jokes started to get stale and predictable.
mods just censored me for calling Soros what he is
And cartoons on clothing as gangsters
Awesome! Good to hear and well that definitely makes me want to give the game a shot!
PLTR EOY Price Targets?
Definitely start making safer trades. Maybe switch to monthlies from fds ;)

I **really** don't want to get married. I feel like it's a complete burden to your life, even having a gf. Maybe because I haven't found anyone special yet but for real, It's easy AF to get tired of someone, even when you don't see them everyday.
Might have to throw some on that
You're wrong in assuming we can afford to invest

Go to YouTube and watch a college lecture on options. This is all they talk about. Look up black Scholes options pricing. 

Understand the basics then come here to unlearn all of that and make money

If you had $2k to YOLO on one call and these were your options which would you choose:

PLTR/PSTH/VALE/AMD/VFF/LTHM/ICLN/RKT
Don't fuck with the mouse
KNOWLEDGE
To be fair that stereotype did start with them. Gen Z seems to be flying under the rader like their Gen X parents.
Its PLTR my dude.. too much hype for major loss right now
I think he still does. I never watched his show but back then a few people I knew followed his plays. I've seen recent clips and it's basically the same. 

He had elizabeth holmes on once.
Market is closed.......or is it????
[deleted]
It's pretty much the first thing they go over
Change your username. With that said I converted a lot of my calls I didn't close to spreads.
Gimme yer best nio eow predictions. Good looking gentlemen only
Lil pump just released a song called Lil pimp lol

Ever since that big bounce at 10am ish
Tesla has five times as many shares as it used to, and it's already run up many times since.

Eventually these stocks are going to have as many shares out there as a company like Pfizer, which can't really moon much even though it invented the first vaccine to take on a global pandemic. It's all an issue of scale.
Pltr
I wish it was political that got me banned. Commented "mods" on one of those "will do X if ticker hits $Y" and that did it. When I come to think of, they were probably trying to scrub the sub a little, dunno.

Are you trying to get banned again
What’s up with JD?

Oh god I hope so
Buy a bunch of shares and get into theta gang shit if you’re up a legit amount of money
Or just buy a bunch of shares like a normal person

Who doesn't have autism these days. Everyone wants something to make them feel special
I feel like we're all going to lose money on pltr calls. The last time I got into a stock that WSB talked this much about it was a disaster.
Ok boomer
No. Theta is time and volatility. 

If stock is $20. A $15C and $25C are not the same. 25C has less probability of being profitable by expiration so that gets priced into theta along with time decay more than an itm 15C
Keep goin and retire young
You are very wrong. There is always someone on other side of trade.
And the show owners didn't know when to quit.

I buy apple and amd calls, market fucking chops, Back to theta gang I go
The shredder, just not sure which yet.
Basically the earnings report gives you the raw numbers, and the earnings calls talks about them, tells you why they are what they are, what went wrong or right, etc.
Come on old man you are letting that moron swagbag6969 beat you on the thetagang sub.

The child calls it Apple stocks like a moron and you can’t even take him down... 

If you need help, I will go put him in his place for you... wouldn’t want you to break a hip
Why
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/12/health/covid-vaccine-timeline-slower/index.html

They won't submit before end of November and it will take several weeks for approval. So mid to end of December for approval.

Even emergency approvals take some time.  The studies aren't even done.  Those were preliminary results.
Put a portion into boomer stocks and scale it back on options

Why am I even wasting my time with futures. Shits not moving
Jordan Belfort
Market heavily manipulated rn
i’m golden baby
if you had to buy calls vs shares, what would you do for PLTR. For shares your long term play on this to hit the moon is when its at least 50+ no? That realistically only happens when a vaccine gets approved globally.
>everyone was confused.

>Moon tomorrow

It’s classic because of the early episodes, first 9 seasons or so.
This is the way
I honestly don’t know what to do tomorrow. 

Sold my tsla today, and closed my cash covered nio puts too soon most likely.

Might wait for a good tech dip and sell tqqq puts, or tsla 400p if it dips, but I been so caught up on tsla and nio I don’t really know what to play next
Good luck penisface
Made money on both. Lost it on ZM

You made money off that discord?

Reddit or sub?
I made more money this year than ever in my life, by a lot. It’s not because I’m smart, I’m just lucky. So how do I dial shit back now that it feels like easy mode? That never lasts.
Jack Ma was last seen being whipped in the middle of Shanghai mall. Baba puts

So what assets do you hold to protect against the scenario you are describing?
Bath water sold out

I found a `BOMBARDIER INC. 5.5% CUM RED` security; anything with "CUM RED" in it should generally be avoided.
Cool man, that sounds like the life. I’m not desperate either, just traveling, but possibly forever because I don’t have anything going on
Sounds like it’s about to pop but not in the direction that you’re implying

I have $36p calendar spreads, I won’t lose much because of theta, but I’d be happy for a pull back to $36-40 by Friday. TGT diagonal call spreads too.

Out of 1000+ moves, I couldn’t hit one right. And if I did, I didn’t buy enough. Market is rigged or I suck at this
PLTR 15% a day til next earnings
WMT ass fucked me, too.
the liquidity of options got FUCKD by the spinoff.
Can you say more on why you think $PFE’s announcement was a factor and whether or not you think $MRNA is having the same effect?
I.P.O. Friday's 😂

They definitely predicted 2020
Alr man you beat the game now be safe play it cool relax and...SIIIIIKE! Put it all into PLTR calls!

Why do I always make all the wrong moves :(
Yeah he but he bought at 9.50 and they IPOd at about 8
Yeah this is definitely a possibility, either way, it’s good news I would say. December has a lot of unusual OI on some ITM puts as well. 

I saw the OI on the $20 strike spike up to around 7000 a few days ago, with the other ITM strikes having nowhere near as much.
Plugs the shit but mayhaps wait to see if anyone cares about share dilution first
Bingo. 69 name gang knows how to trade.
Thanks, I’ve heard of those, but I don’t necessarily want to wipe chemicals on my halls, and I’m vaguely recalling a Reddit story about a guy who was using some wipe that was recalled and it fucked his balls up. Thanks though pal
VIX likely up due to futures contract expiration tomorrow.
I sold my CCL calls today and am still holding my puts in anticipation of hopefully one big move until mid December
They had a public stock offering, doesn’t that mean the price went down because of dilution, not selling action?
Should I buy calls for palantir

So what's different in the earnings call. Care to provide a tldr?
Yes 75c 12/18
Do you know what will happen short term? Next week it’s emergency vaccine approval for Pifzer then Moderna... it will pop on the news. In 2 weeks it’s already December, so we will have another news that they will start vaccinate... pop again. Good luck trying to time a dip!
You could definitely rent an e girl for 1/10 of that

I remember John Stewart going after Cramer shortly after. He’s a shady fuck and most people don’t know it lol. I shouldn’t say that. I think he just had a big mouth.
You have to factor in the stock price too retard.  Could hold 4000 shares for same price as 100 tsla.  Sell 40 cc pltr or 1 tsla

Well since you offered no tickers to research or anything else to help offer you some guidance, the simplest answer is that deep In The Money options generally have less volatility since they’re...SHOCKER...IN THE MONEY

Gonna probably sell my CCL 1/15/21 $17.5c tomorrow up 16% and, no it’s not a huge gain, but it’s a gain nonetheless. Probably buy back in at a better/lower entry.

Very cool! Do you do personalized investments for each family member/account or just separate accounts but about the same positions?
Yeah fuck that bullshit. Has cost me lots of money last week
Could be, is it a vice stock?
Performance is very revelant, otm calls are essentially just time value and volatility premium. So qqq barely able to move 1% a day will be reflected in the option price. If qqq were to have continued making 3-5% moves with the same volume it was trading pre 11/9 the option could've returned to the value he bought it at unfortunately that's not the case.
Rap in general is wack nowadays
Gonna bleed until WSB moves on, then wait about 3 business days then moon
Most of the outstanding shares of any company are held in the street name. Cede and co is the nominee that basically owns all the shares.

So when you fat finger a share of apple on RH the share doesn't really move from the seller's broker to yours instantly. Instead the ownership gets updated iirc with cede and co in terms of who holds what. (Broker not person).

Unlike most of us she’s in the black.
I have some calls expiring this Friday. A little bit nervous
More intrinsic value. Higher probability to expire profitable so less volatility with ITM which lowers theta
You missed it.

11/13?  Sure.  Now, you're just chasing sloppy-seconds.  80+ RSI, huge separation between MACD-value and MACD-avg.  By the time you get in everyone who bought $2/share ago will be cashing out leaving you bag-holding.

My plan today was to get in TSLA FDs in the morning after a dip. Well, I did that, but it never really bounced like I expected. Was able to reduce my position a bit when it got over 445, but this shit better hit 460 tomorrow.
No, but at least I won't be as embarrassed or sleep deprived.

Boought 5K of shares at 1.10 in January. Timed that Govt would help, as it always gives them corporate welfare. Shares bounced to 1.25 next day. Then bought 5K more. Shares tanked to 0.50, 2 months later when I sold after they announced more bad news at earnings.

I hear ya, knowing your psychology is important.

I bought a 300c in July and got about a 280% return before I sold it for the JMIA run up. Jumped out of JMIA at 16, and went back into FDX and UPS a week before the big drop. So I’m 1k away from break even on UPS 170c 1/21 and in the green on FDX 280c 1/22. 

In between thinking it will go up leading up to earnings, but also positive vaccine news might cause another pullback as more people pile into reopening plays such as retail and restaurants, like last time.

Buy ITM 30-45 days out. cut losses after 20%, and ride winners to +30-40% but actually take profits. If IV is crazy high then sell cash secured puts for 1-2 weeks out. Buy them back if you are +30-40% and do it again further out. It’s an easy game when you don’t let your emotions get to you. Good luck

I can see it hitting $100 by end of next year maybe, but I think the pump today based on that is really silly.

It was getting PT bumps through it's run up Sept/Oct and it stalled out and sold off heavily anyway. This is a shot in the arm hype buy up. It isn't stable.

I think DKNG will run up past 50 and stick around there come January, when NBA comes back and NFL playoffs are in full swing. I figure the stock will dip in the 40 range again which is when I'll buy 50/55c for January.

Unless you're averaging down at key support levels and your strike is at least near the money, it's often tough to do due to theta. Underlying price could go up to where you originally bought and you could still be in the red. Usually better to cut losses and maybe rebuy lower especially with shorter dated expirations.
so I guess most of the people here think this lady, being 1 person on a 7 member board, will somehow achieve some kind of mass mutiny or monetary revolution of sorts and become authoritarian dictator of the federal reserve board of governors? one could hope, but I dont think I sniff enough glue to actually buy this
Smart people have sold both and waiting for theta gang to shred before reentering.

I wish I knew at this point, but my bookmap software resets the average when I sell one of the scalps or when the new session resets at 5pm. I’m net positive which considering I was holding 3 contracts short from 3559 ain’t terrible. I’ve been pretty confident this entire time though which is why I never fully exited, though I did come close.
What we thinkin for NIO tomorrow? 

Super Mega Bull Pump or Blood Red Ultra Drill?
In asf to ban fools posting “to the moon 🚀” and see “you in Valhalla” ... also..  I bought 300 stocks in PLTR and NIO today

Shouldve waited till nov 19 like proper “sauvagee” french accent
I'm legit retarded I have no idea why there is this implied 0.

Edit: I thought extra hard about it and think maybe it's because adding a zero is a way to add a digit without increasing the value of the number.
What’s the scoop haha
My mom is 60 :(
NIO got that 5 minutes option pricing delay so you guys won't be able to sell right at open.

Well, here a detail that I'm unclear of the role it plays: yesterday I got a message from Amazon with a request to change password token that I didn't initiate. Customer support was no help.

This is correct
From what I understand.
They spend a lot of money on R&D but still manage a high margin on gross profit. 
Their earnings were awesome this qtr.  the trading volume was low today (half the day was under a mil) yet they still were up 7%
Their competitor, Logitech stock trades 4x more than their sales while Corsair trades 1.5x their sales. 

This is all I know 

Also, 
I don’t know what I’m doing so I’m honestly not the guy to be giving any advice.

I had a 15% dividend stock that was amazing until the pandemic hit and then it wasn't. Some of these dividend stocks put $0 away and just give all their profits away, total house of cards. Like buying in to a slumlord's complex.
There’s not enough ROI on judging poor/middle class people for wanting to make money off those who have it

I could make an argument that shorts and puts are unethical or the two party system in America sucks, but it’s not worth the chase when there are easier paths forward

Yup, you are definitely retarded. 👏🏽
Give it a shot! 90% of the struggle is honestly just getting to know your own psychology and working with it. Also knowing when to take profits and just sit on your hands for the rest of the day after you’ve hit your target so that you don’t give it all right back. At least that’s been my experience so far.
2/11? Lol it'll be $20 by 11am
This video spent 99% of time explaining the definition of IV crush but zero percent time discussing why exercising the option would result in a loss.
Being dyslexic I bought puts OF RTLP instead of calls of PLTR...best move I ever made.

You're an autist in a sea of retards.
It seems like what happened was that OP used a google generated password for his RH account but then also decided to sign up for a membership to a small obscure gay porn site that caters to the most extreme of tastes. Due to the content of the site, OP decided to use the most secure password he could think of, which was the google generated RH password. OP then proceeded to copy and paste the RH password from his Chrome passwords list into the “choose a password” form on the gay porn site. The gay porn site was actually a front for Russian hackers who then proceeded to use the password to drain his RH account  after selling a massive amount of naked NIO puts.
If this was true it would be called the Shares Market not the stock market

Honestly, cvs. They finally got going this week and then got crushed by the amazon news. Probably worth a trade if you are into the boomer shit
I had my mans and them custom build a lambo with that NIO money. Here’s the link!

https://youtu.be/idfJS9b_Mts
So you blew up your account on NIO or TSLA today?

Buy high, and sell low? Feeling like your world is crashing in? It’s not. You’ll be ok. Your risk tolerance is wild enough for you to be here. You will get through this. Take a break and come back fresh. Don’t chase your losses. 

Hang in there. Money is replaceable, you are not.

The exact wrong approach is to guarantee loans.

We got into this mess because the us government backstopped every loan on existence. They basically told the schools to raise tuition as much as they possibly can and guaranteed the payoff.

Stop guaranteeing student loans for everyone. A kid with no money shouldn't be taking out 150000 dollars or more without a real plan to get it paid off.

No idea on the TSLA question, but the premiums have definitely dropped a lot since ICLN has been trapped between $20-22 for weeks now. I like the idea of it mooning again after Biden gets in and starts saying “renewables this, renewables that.”

1: two charts open max

2: $TICK, price action and volume only. no other indicators. 

3: no news feed. stock chosen previous evening

4: 0-3 trades per session, 1-2% risk. no more.

5: no trades between 12-2pm est. there is no volume. 

5: First half day: play with trend. Second half: play against trend

on entry:

a what is the evidence? 
b who is on the other side of this trade?
c where’s my stop?
d where’s my exit?

6: once play is made, stop is set, whatever I think about the price movement doesn’t matter and has no bearing on anything. the play was made for a reason, and the risk has been applied.

7. at exit, 50% out on strong volume, stop moved up. if volume weak, 100% profit taking

8. stop may be moved up to reduce risk, it may never be moved down to make room for trade going bad

If it's guaranteed to go up, calls will always give you a better return than your strategy. However nothing is guaranteed in life, so your strategy should be safer unless you pick an absolute junk stock to run it on. Best of luck, and don't get distracted by people talking about 10 baggers (remember, for every ten bagger, there are ten people who lose everything).

New rules - 
- Sell before the last 2 to 3 weeks before Expir
- Sell if down 40%, you can always reset position later
- Don't go all in on a position until you are sure of the trend. DCA works on options also.
Does that work on sub $5 stocks?

I am fucking regretting selling my $50 calls and buying one (1) $60 to appease the FOMO.
as long as it makes you happy lmao
It's definitely been a ride.  I sold a shit ton of puts on its ride up to the recent high at 29x.  Had a call I sold too on the way up, so I did well on that.  After the drop I sold more puts and it's been really good.

Keeping a close eye on it and knowing COVID isn't going anywhere I'm gonna ride up with the 3 calls I have a little higher, opened 2 Jan $210 and 1 $260 call last weekish.  They're doing very well and have plenty of time to bounce around.

I plan to sell the 260 once it goes up another couple bucks.  Since the 210s are up so much and they have tons left before theta starts to bite I'm either gonna ride them to near the ath or just before earnings.  I'm bullish on it (within reason), I think it has a little more headroom so I'm gonna risk a little bit of gains for potentially a lot more.

Sorry for the confusion i meant qqq itself, the volatility of the underlying asset matters too and that delta is pretty shit and has been shit. Plus qqq has been performing like shit ever since that day.

It's absolutely not the place to LEARN how to stonks, but it definitely helps. If you're legitimately trying to get into it without any sort of memery, take everything here with huge helpings of salt. OCCASIONALLY WSB calls it right and the hype train is real and everyone gets paid, like TSLA/NIO, but usually it's just "hey guys I'm gonna yolo everything on this stock because it has a goofy abbreviation like "PNIS" or they throw everything into options on $SPY and it flops. Don't forget the market is a fickle little shit and even if something's been riding the good life for a few weeks it could flop out of nowhere because people think "ok I've got my money time to quit while I'm ahead" and the stonks tank.
100 shares of NOK? got it.
Good luck bro!
Gonna be honest, long bios like that make a lot of women vomit. It sounds like you’re trying way too hard
That hurt me emotionally. Especially after revealing groundbreaking technology unaltered in like a century and the market was like nah none of this

If he thought it was going down he would just sell and not say shit, but he knows it’s going to $30 EOY so he says he can’t own it cause of moral issues... so when it goes up after he sells he can say he was being virtuous and it’s not cause he is a shitty asset manager :/

I feel your pain, I'm down 80k with acb. Tried to make a quick buck and got kicked out of my account and by the time I logged in again I was down 50k. Sold some for 40k loss and am sitting on current 80k down praying for the rebound.  Newly married so might be divorced by tax season 🤔.

They saved my portfolio in March and now every time I tried to throw a little at puts i got slapped fast lol. I'm just mad I missed the correction. If it hits 5 hundo again I'm not fucking around, buying $250 leaps for 50% of my portfolio and walking away

[deleted]
Yeah that was my kind of the point i was trying to make. In the scene he is selling the best case scenario and leaving out the part where they will most likely lose all their money. When I see post like this it's cool for about a minute then I think about how much people lose trying to make plays like this.
One of the things that Cramer will say consistently if you listen is he does not trust the Chinese government and for that matter Chinese stocks that are not held to the same standards as US companies as far as earnings and financials. The only Chinese company he recommends is usually BABA because he thinks they have financials like an American company. If you cannot see that NIO is speculation then you just don’t want to see it. Nothing wrong with speculating just know that you are taking additional risk
For every 19y old yoloing 2k into 132k, there are a hundred losing that 2k. It's a little thing called sampling bias.

Yes! wsb has been absolutely amazing. Sometimes you got the lads who spammed to buy calls on a stock that's already up 5% for 3 days, sometimes you got the lads who constantly commented "I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD GO UP" after a stock has been -69% but its an educational place. Every night, we offer the free karma farming by saying "Europoors are back at it again" and "Green by open!". Around 3am you hear prostitute experience stories. 10/10 recommend

Hey where's your super convincing arguments for PLTR? Havnt seen a single one from you, bro? Why? Or sorry was your argument for a $35b market cap that they protect, kill, and track people? Wow thats so good and specific, you totally did your research, and ill totally fomo in.

No it's not complicated, don't back up what goes against your morals or beliefs , it's a simple voting system, and even if the "voting" is rigged , it doesn't matter , don't contributed into a marketplace that goes against your principals, even if your vote doesn't change things. It's exactly your way of thinking why most people don't change their behaviour, because they think one small vote doesn't change things

I hope so
Holding until shitcoin goes to 20k. Yes I believe it can return mid 10s range shorter term higher long term. They've done a lot of share dilutions and crapcoin has halved a couple times since then. 

Good thing is leaps give me a longer time to decide and doing CCs on the shares at $9 can yield me  around 3-5%  a week on 1-2DTE. That's around 1-2k/week

Already in with most of my money.  Riding a lot of FDX and W calls.  W are down 20% from last week, so hoping for a slow recovery.  

If W nose dives at open how it has been I might drop a call in and close it immediately once it levels out at +0% again.  It's been tanking at open the past several days then recovers or is up by close.

On CNBC, Cramer called NIO a speculative stock meant for younger people. I think NIO is overbought but I wouldn’t call it a speculative stock after tonight’s earnings.

PLUG situation sucks. But this is pretty standard for hypergrowth companies selling common stocks. SHOP done it last year offering new shares at $317 while trending at $350, now it's around $900. So if you're still holding on PLUG, HOLD! Buy more to lower avg costs. But ffs HOLD. H2 is going to boom during Biden presidency as demands for H2 to fuel commerical industry grow.

48% gain today in RIOT, a nasdaq listed tit coin mining company. 70% this week, and much more if tit coin goes for a hard bull run.

Any decent explanation on why the market went down today? fear of corona again? have we not been through this sht?
I think you are right long term, but I think it is premature.  I think the market is going to get shook again by covid numbers/any negative news.  I see it dropping one more time before real recovery in Q1.  There are no real movies going out in the next couple months.

FYI: A company with the ticker symbol of RIOT (not allowed to say their company name) is a good option for exposure to tit coin. They mine tit coin and are listed on the NASDAQ. They’re in competition for the biggest tit coin mining company in the US, and are the biggest mining company listed on a public exchange. 48% gain today and 70% this week. RIOT magnifies the changes in price movement of tit coin. I imagine Riot will continue an uptrend as tit coin appreciates.

I try to be disciplined and set a target gain before placing every trade. Depending on many factors that can vary from stock to stock. I have missed some amazing up moves by taking a 60% gain but have avoided some unforeseen reversals taking that same 60% (think BABA or PLUG or AMD) which dropped absolute bombs on shareholders

I'm assuming people are bullish on government contracts coming out more from Biden, that combined with talks of providing contact tracing internationally there is a lot of things to expect out of it in the future. 

This is pricing in on some deals in the future. It will probably dip hard soon and then swing back to around where it is if those deals go through.


I bought pltr stock when it was $10, will probably sell 75% of it tomorrow and buy it back if it dips again. This is a lot of growth in too little of a time without any deals actually being made.

Thanks for catching my error. I corrected it.
Seeing how the market is reacting to NIO post earnings report, call holders WILL get fucked over by IV crush in the morning. Maybe on the low end IV drops by 30% (and I'm being VERY generous here), your 20NOV2020 50C just lost \~0.50 per contract (Vega is currently sitting at \~0.016). Now if I'm not being generous and IV drops 100% (from its current 233.39% for that call), you know what happens next - If you know how to multiply that is. Good luck on your trip to "tendie town".
The losses are from stock compensation. It's actually going to be a great buy it comes back down to earth.
I'm a few many drinks in after a day of PLTR wins. Excuse my reading skills. 🐍🎷
The -60% is a function of time decay and a lower price, not sure what the delta was but the current price sounds about right to me. There was probably some iv crush as well because volatility spiked a bit that day. My guess is he got in at exactly the wrong time.

The people FOMO'ing into this aren't making earnings plays, they're trying to buy the next TSLA.  The approach of today's earnings report was bearish because it potentially catalyzes a sell-off.  Tomorrow, the coast will be clear.  Any dip will be treated like a buying opportunity.

This is actually bullish if you look into it. Plus he bought 8 fuckin years ago
You know I did the same shit 8 months ago. I used to tell people when strikes would happen. I used to nail it, but it would have no effect on the market. I was constantly trying to use events like that to play oil and defense companies, but ugh it was such a waste!
If you understand or relate to anything I’ve said, just remember it doesn’t get easier at any point ever in the future, and gets worse and more difficult as time goes on.  Good luck.

Yes, if you have the money available for 100 shares at the strike price. If your option is in something like TSLA, that would require something around $40,000 per contract (100 shares x $400 strike price), which is usually not possible for individuals

As retail investors who here has ever made money on an IPO in the last year? They come out 3-4x overpriced and then start to fall. Look at snowflake. PLTR was the last sleeper IPO but still had to wait months to get options that paid out after it traded between 9 and 10 bucks for a month

Israel sneaks in attacks more than anyone but is very aware of the threat hezbelloah is having over 100k estimated rockets/missiles pointed at them from Lebanon, which is effectively an Iranian controlled kill switch,

Good point, I've been holding 5000 shares @ ~$150 buying in batches since March 🙃 I've been certainly reaping the rewards since Nov 1 but it's been a painful journey. 

I certainly believe it will form a bottom around this price with a good pop in the price, this isn't an earnings call but unlocking 450 built planes sitting around tieing up capital. As BA slowly returns to profit throughout the year it will creep up. 

I know this isn't options but I lurk on here for loss porn to keep me humble 😂

Best advice I can give to a beginner is take it slow. Don’t trade in the first 30 minutes of market open, and selling options is boring but way more consistent. Oh and getting a killer scanner helps too

Yeah up to you. If you are planning on holding onto it for long term, then no cause you could lose all ur shares. If you want a quick profit and think it won't drop too much, then it's a good idea
Anybody think CVS Walgreens will lobby DOJ to file antitrust against AMZN?
I second this notion. For the price of 1 itm call exp 3/21 you can buy 50 shares. I’d rather not fight theta on something like VXX even if it does have decay. Just use the position as leverage against your other positions.
It’s moving a lot this week. A intraday play could be good on momentum

Hello friends. If you want SIMPLE strategy to make money somewhat passively using options just do what I've been doing for the last couple years (including covid crash!)

Create a portfolio of debit spreads. Small positions, variation of time length, on companies that you think have dipped artificially. 

Example: a 12/31 or later BABA at the money call debit spread. Basically you just need it to be higher than what it is now by then. Seems like a solid enough play no? 

Never go over 10% of your balance on any one play and try to beta diversify as much as you can. 

Right now I'm holding Baba, spot, wba, DKNG, nvda for December expiry or later. Most of them are already in the money so theta is now on my side on these.

 If the companies you hold keep dropping, then you can average in. This is the flexibility you get with small position size :) Feel free to ask any questions!
That sounds kinda gay tho
All stores do that, even ecommerce sites like Amazon
When the fuck is this roblox ipo expected
Assistant principal
I think you may be wrong this time.  OSTK has been getting killed lately and is trending up last week+.  Their ER was positive. The big downtrend was Vaccine last Monday. I think the market is realizing there is a ways to go before it really makes a difference.  It dipped a tiny bit on Moderna news yesterday and then had a strong day today.. I see it going up again tomorrow and Friday.

>They input their own vols and thus set prices...which then can change due to supply and demand.

so... yes prices are set by supply and demand. sure you can have a best guess at what IV will be but ultimately IV is determined by supply/demand and therefore price. using the opening example, you see spreads become super wide at open because you are watching price discovery create the "efficient" market price in real time

Its not a huge deal yet, Israel does this frequently and this was , imo, likely in response to them detonating explosives in the golan heights earlier today.

Obviously any situation could blow up big , but this isnt worrisome yet for a large scale conflict.

Probably Israel just stirring the pot because of US troop withdrawls in Afghanistan so they need to drum up some support of keeping the US in the Middle East
I think a lot of people were waiting for the actual call before making their decisions.

Halo 3 when you were in middle school? Jesus we got little kids in this sub
You answer this question. The next day (say tomorrow) when NIO opens, before there's any trades (before any supply and demand), how do MM determine what price to open up the options at? Obviously the IV will go down and all prices will be lower, but how do they determine that?

They input their own vols and thus set prices...which then can change due to supply and demand. Like this is literally what SIG (Susquehanna) does when they set their prices...I've seen it live.

Is PLTR a good bet? I’m thinking of getting calls tomorrow
You should talk to your faculties and explain this to them, most of them will be nice and get you in anyway

im closing my laptop now and going with this. thanks for the confidence boost, if nothing else it'll help me sleep better.

Thanks.  It’s tough when you have plenty of time left on expiry...  but we all know it could’ve gone the other way just as easily.


Just need GME to turn back around now.

Actually I was in my college parking lot watching the drop live, circuit breakers and all thinking to myself “oh fuck this shit is awesome”

Biden with a Democratic Senate was likely going to push major tax policy to increase cap gains taxes, trading taxes, and wealth transfer taxes. 

Democrats winning the Senate is probably the most bearish possible outcome now, aside from COVID armageddon, because the filibuster is gone. Lots of eyes will be on Georgia
It’s crazy to think that this artist made like nothing for this absolute banger of a track and now 40 years later has 24 million views on YouTube and has went absolutely viral
Nothing but spam about IV crush today, huh. IV crush is real but it's not like your risk-reward ratio is lower you dumbasses. A big move is priced in so there's more of a reason to hold options. If you're too scared of losing out on your premium then buy shares like the bitch you are.

NIO has and will continue to have very high IV. One earnings report isn't changing shit. Most of the earnings is already priced in because of delivery reports and the market knows this. There will still be a relatively small IV crush. But nothing like Tesla's battery day or anything.
Look how fucked we are......NOT

Better off stuffing a quarter mil under your matress.
the TSLA 500 call CAN be worth more than the 490, but it doesn't happen because algos are able to arbitrage that shit nearly instantly. you will see shit like that happen on low volume tickers though. 

plus, it's literally impossible to calculate IV. price comes first, then the model. there's not some all knowing entity setting the price of options that you must buy at
You know what, you’re actually on to something. No way in fuck the requirements aren’t 50/25 for RH. Watch them be extremely overvalued and people buy them anyway.

Short sellers vs. NIO will last a while. Just yesterday the short volume was [41.55%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/nio). Would not recommend entering any option positions and if you didn't close your call contracts at/near the top that's on you for being blindly optimistic. I don't think there will be a short squeeze anytime soon as this will be a violent consolidation period for NIO.
Super duper bankruptcy 😂

I hope it’s a Tesla flame thrower
I fuck around with pretty much my entire account every day, and I close everything eod. Don’t do it unless you have a shit ton of money and a firm grasp on your own psychology. I made around 4% yesterday and 9% today. I average profitable in that range right now 3/5 days with two cancelling each other out. This is after doing this every fucking day since March and nuking half of my account once. 

I’m only doing this because my industry is fucked right now and I’m at a physical disadvantage currently to pick up factory work or anything else that would pay more than this stressful bullshit.

Start by paper trading or with small amounts. Find a strategy that works for you and don’t fucking mess with it if it’s profitable. It’s getting too ballsy and over leveraging or breaking your rules that’ll wipe out an entire chunk of gains. 

But really, don’t do it unless you truly know what the fuck you’re doing. My acid reflux is insane these days. Hit up r/daytrading to talk to more educated folks than me. I’m just some lucky newbie that still doesn’t know jack shit.
All that hype for nio just to trade flat smh. I bought puts and would have preferred a green dildo over this gay shit.

For anyone keeping score. That’s 3 times in the last 3 days it’s fallen hard only to be bought right back up. 40.5, 41, and now 42.5. Bottom line keeps moving up with resistances keep breaking when it’s going up. Bullish consolidation is looking really hot for a pop sometime this week 😉
I got a six shooter and a horse named trigger 🤠
You can talk to your broker and see if they can allocate you shares.
You could have bought PLTR at $11 lol
On the 12th, one minute before close. I bought a Boeing $180C for $425 which expires this Friday.

I sold it on the 13th at open for $510.
Two consecutive 15% days and the stock is above $60 and you're printing money!  Act now, it's a time limited offer!
Save it and send it back when NIO is 1,000,000 a share.

ok yeah i generally agree then but I think you're splitting hairs. prices of options are set by what people are willing to buy/sell them for and IV just reflects that price. IV undeniably drops after earnings though

no dude, if I'm an MM and I see someone willing to buy $1 billion worth of 1 cent FDs I will charge him 2 cents because I know he's willing to pay it. Black scholes goes out the window when there's outsized demand for contracts, IV is just a reflection of how much you're overpaying for the contract. if prices are set by models and not supply and demand, why do some options contracts have 50 cent wide bid/asks? if everyone knew the right price for options at any given time the market would be perfectly efficient

Sell when it's green.
Your book that you are reading also probably assumes completely flat vol surfaces (since that's what Black Scholes assumes) but empirically vol surfaces are skews or smiles. You are reading a theoretical book. Of course if you are given a price, you can back out a volatility. But that price is also determined by an input, namely volatility and skew.
666 shares @$13.25 here. Number seemed appropriate given the product. These are in my "buy and don't look at for 10-15 years" portfolio so we'll see where we are then, I suspect this one may be funding a good portion of my retirement though.

Step one. Check profits calculator. 
Step two. Spend extra money and buy farther expiry date contracts and less FD’s/or super crazy otm shit, unless you specifically cross a cost-profit ratio that favors you aka super value. 
Step three. ???
Step three again. There are a few companies that rise up after earnings. Do some historical research. Typically, play the earnings ahead by buying early and far expiry post earnings. 
Step four. Remember, you’re a retard. So don’t listen to any of this bs and keep doing what you’re doing.
let’s all hire pltr to tell us when the market crash is coming

I hope you closed you positions before the earnings call. Seeing how the market is currently reacting to the report - you're in for a rude awakening tomorrow when IV gets crushed and Vega comes to fuck you.

Interesting choice, Jeffrey.
Be cool if it ran past 50 by Friday
DEW THE DEW
They releasing some published data next week? Buy any calls at that point, just pick one
Honestly the most important ones: 

Don't throw more than 25% of your acc value on a single play

Don't throw more than 10% of your acc value on FD's. 

Don't panic, stress, greed or FOMO into something or out of something.

If the framework for your assesment of the options changes dramatically, don't be afraid to sell for a loss.

Yeah, you'll miss out on the 2000%+ gains generally, but most of the time people just lose everything when playing FD's or short termed shit. Pick the stuff you believe in with decent IV and option prices and make plays 2+ months out.
What do you mean?
Only if you are trading shares. If you are trading options, each individual option doesn't trade on their own. It is partially determined by supply and demand, but it isn't the only factor. 

Think about it like this. When it's really close to expiration (say Friday 3:55), a way OTM option is like 1 cent. Even if someone were to put a billion dollars and buy that option over and over again for 1 cent, it'll stay 1 cent and then expire worthless OTM. Supply and demand played no role there.

The other way to think about it is the price of a put and call of the same strike are directly related. Even if people only bought the calls and not the puts, the price of the puts are affected too.
Anyone here trade in their Roth IRA or y’all just set it and forget it?

Patience
You might be fine but I wouldn’t count on it, I would expect 125 or so then run up to 130+ before ER late jan
If it rockets I'm selling. I haven't been in long enough to develop diamond hands.
Lot of people here saying do it, I think short term gains will be minimal. If you buy, hold
Since it hit $500 early September it has been pretty horizontal, there are a lot of people looking to pull some earnings out but want a good spike to do it.  It’s gonna struggle all the way to $500, it will hit it by end of year and push $550 by 1st quarter earnings.
not at all, get in as early as u can tmr morning
This is why I’m currently teaching myself options in high school. My whole paycheck is disposable income, so I save half and put half into stocks to mess around, see what I can learn.

But I dumped everything at 17.92 today, thinking the euphoria is too good to be true, and Soros is a catalyst to turn it around.

Their subscriptions prices aren’t that competitive and their service isn’t that much better. The only cool thing is being able to steam multiple things at once but I bet most of America’s shit Internet can’t handle that.

ok but pltr calls isnt a bad thing lol
PLTR made up my losses from last month 🙌🏻
anyone can make a million dollars on stocks with enough capital and a propensity to gamble. just take any winning trade you have ever made, and pretend that you had instead consider that you had bet your entire margin on it. 

the only true measure is, did you in fact gamble your entire margin on that trade, and if you did, how long have you protected those gains?
Until the next paycheck gets deposited at least haha

I got to break even first before thinking big like that
After a 90 minute call, my head is swimming after trying to impterpret and understand very strong 'Chinglish' accents. Their voices seemed lilting and happy tho. There's that. 

Just checked ticker, $46.12 an hour post call.  Not great, but not awful either, considering how sharply TSLA dropped after battery day, and WMT today after a good earnings call. Go figure.

Yes, but it’s called selling a call. Some brokers will let you package buying a 100 shares and selling 1 call at the same time but in Robinhood you have to do them separately. So if you already have a 100 shares, you would sell 1 call. Robinhood won’t let you sell naked calls so you can’t accidentally sell one.

Wise words
What news?
IV determines the price, not the other way around for options. Otherwise put-call parity would break. If every option traded on their own rather than in a connected chain linked by vols, there would be arbitrage everywhere. When MM set the prices of options, their input is volatility and that will spit back out a price. Sure you can then use the price to back out the vol, but it's the vol parameter they change to then change price. It's related to put-call parity, the most important formula in options.

Thx, I appreciate the info. So far my strategy has been to find options that are < $0.25 and expire more than 120 days on underlying that will recover in lockstep with  the US economy. I'm hoping to ride the current positions  up to 12-15k. I've also been making small change on smaller swing trades.
same average cost is 261 rn and feeling good
? IV contraction is literally IV crush. earnings is an event that causes uncertainty relating to an option's fair price

IV is also fake. it's just whatever is unaccounted for in the pricing model. it's based on supply and demand. less demand for your 20% OTM FDs after earnings because there's no longer an event to make that shit spike
No stocks under $5

I'll say it again, **IV crush isn't real**; price adjustment happens, then it's reflected in the IV.

To all of you know-it-all motherfuckers who talked some smackeroony at me on the daily thread, learn some shit:

> In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of option contracts on a particular stock or future. It is represented as a percentage that indicates the annualized expected one [standard deviation](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/standard-deviation) range for the stock based on the option prices 

Here's the part that is likely where the mythology comes from, but parse the shit, not the shape:

>When the uncertainty related to a stock increases *and the option prices are traded to higher prices, IV will increase*. This is sometimes referred to as an “**IV expansion**.”  
  
>  
>On the opposite side of IV expansion is “**IV contraction**.” This occurs when the fear and uncertainty related to a stock diminishes. *As this happens, the stock’s options decrease in price which results in a decrease in IV*. 

See: [https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/implied-volatility)

Price first! Price first! Price first! Price first! Weeeeee!

Likely they’ll just reduce share size across the board to make room for Tesla in the portfolio and when the next company falls over for whatever reason it not be replace. 

There has been a lot of talk how they’d have trouble picking up enough shares($40 billion worth) in one go to add Tesla. So they may have to break it up over a period of time and by then some company will probably die.

I just looked at the chart, and I think this is the perfect stock to pull a long wedge on. It is right against resistance, it is building towards a good consolidation going up, and it doesn’t lack for volatility. Have you thought about stringing in longer puts as leverage instead of shorties?

There are other markets closing at various times of the night, and they often sell off if they don’t want to bag hold through what they anticipate will be an American red day. Futures traders often read these trends, get spooked, and close positions, causing futures to dip on American markets.

Every day before a pig gets slaughtered, it gets fed. If it used inductive reasoning, it would naturally assume on the day it got slaughtered that it would be fed and not slaughtered.

Worth noting that I've yet to turn a profit, so maybe only buy calls Friday mornings?
You new? It's semi always been like this. It's been particularly like this since about March crash. I stay for the cinememes and fomo.  
  
And shit like QuAD WitChiNg HoUr

Thank you for your service
So is it established that nio is overvalued ?
boomer stocks are weird man.
Logic doesn’t work with his base. 

Rudy was in court today in PA and got utterly humiliated on the record.
when you sell the same thing you bought (or buy the same thing you sold) they cancel each other out and disappear just like magic.

this is the 'clearing house' function of the exchange, and your broker will always automatically arrange for them to do it for you.
Idc about unethical that much really, I don't want to support companies that are unethical and hope they get wrecked, but trading has really little to do with supporting the company, so thats that. And considering theres dozens of post every day claiming how superior PLTR is, but nobody knowing or being able to even remotely articulate "why" (or the arguments being retarded even by WSB standards), it's just ameme pump. And like said I wont short shit, I'm not that stupid, just because a company is ridiculously overvalued it's not clever to short it. 

Everyone knew NKLA was retardedly overvalued when it was $40 before it went to $80, $ZM was retarded shit when it was $200, and yet everone would have lost their shirt and pants shorting those shits. PLTR is the same. Doesn't make it a great company, even tho people made a fortune riding the meme wave. Not saying PLTR is the same level as NKLA, but you get the idea.
This is stupid
i bought baba 7 trading days ago ..
Same pretty much, I sell when I reach those percentages and buy the in the money calls that are around 2+ months
they definitely consider public sentiment and there’s no way that doesn’t include meme stocks and how to leverage against them
Maybe end of 2021
IMO
I'm in danger!

BA? ETSY?
They're changing the name to the S&P 501.
Yeah you need more fiber
I wonder if we get an actual drill tomorrow or just another bear trap followed by moon mission. Probably the latter
What call should I buy for PLTR???
Fertile Dame
Thanks for actually being realistic about it. I was expecting people to say like $40 or some stupid shit like that
u rode a stock over 100 %, and you're still complaining that its not running even more?
Bud you know we all don’t have college degrees because it all went to this
I love getting hurt by BABA
That was just your uncle Randy.

Smart man. Congrats in advance.
I was so confused on why buying F calls would equate to pirating... I spent too much time thinking about this comment. thanks for wasting my life dick.

Whatever gets me that car
Will government mandated TSLA calls be included in next stimmy?
Don't know but hope not. I have nothing to add after the call.
Yes, yes, no, everything *after* the attack but nothing before I changed the Google pw.

They compromised my Gmail, added two email filters to the settings so that everything relevant to the RH hack would automatically mark as read and go to trash, changed the pin to my RH debit card, sold my stock, then locked me out of my RH account (probably by changing the accounts attached email). It is also possible they set up an IMAP on Gmail as that was enabled but I didn't check before disabling it. POP was already disabled but I have used IMAP in the past so can't confirm one way or the other if they did.

Before I was locked out of RH I was able to go in and change the debit to locked but it's probably just as likely the hacker switched that back afterwards.

If this law goes into effect, any chinese company that doesnt allow/use U.S approved auditors to audit their books, they will be delisted. Earliest it can go into effect is 2022 well after Trump administration. Biden could stop it before it goes into effect

still have some mid december and january dated calls, some shares. i’m down on them but there’s no point in selling them for pennies

What everyman said.  IV was in the 200's today on short DTE 50's, pre-E R, and will almost certainly plummet before open.  Don't you love it when your calls drop in price while the stock is soaring?
I did read that as anus-tart. Well done.
It’s got what plants crave
Oh man if that gets in the money I’ll be fucking rich
Definitely not
I mean it’s a meme stock, now and you can justify it fundamentally however you want by saying the run up is cause shorts were covering or whatever....

I think of the run up in part can be attributed to it being mysterious, low price per share, meme... 

However I think another part is people are trying to figure out the multiple it should trade at... I think originally it was looked at as a gov contract stock low multiple lower stock price, but as they have shown to get higher margin “software snowflake” kind of customers the multiple/valuation increased moving the stock price higher

Also this morning someone bought 18.5 million shares that’s what kick started it today not soros that news came out 3 days ago
Can I still break even on my AAPL call? It has to hit 129 by Jan
I would say theres a lot more time with the new 100$ price target. And no, my position has nothing to do with that.
Everyone is talking about it on here, I don’t know much but that strike and exp seem logical.  Idk how to take the soros news though.
Trade like we will, but don't shoot for the moon; buy stock maybe and a few leaps; but don't all in the risk isn't worth it

$PLTR float is really high
I’ve been doing well, could also just be luck ,but by buying slightly in or out of the money calls for 6 months expire or longer, and selling for 25-75% profit when happy. If stock goes down, you can wait because of long expiration or buy dips.
PLTR is going to be the next WSB casualty
If you ever figure out how to make decisions like this, please let me know.

The real WSB move would be to have $75,000 in OTM calls on PLTR. But still, respect.
easy, because it’s a million times easier to commit voter fraud from within the country than from beyond. The logic is rather simple if you think about it

To get through $500 level and open up sky beyond that, Tesla will need to successfully breach with considerable volume $452 level. It didn’t happen and might not happen in November. We might test $410 critical level and breach $390 level in next 6-7 trading sessions. Also, funds will not rebalance in November. They will start process in December. Also, expect stock price manipulation in the overall process. My conservative PT is $575. As per Elliot wave theory, PT is $635.

It's not senate rules. I mean it is, but it comes from most standard parliamentary rules of order. Typically after a vote, there can be a motion to reconsider. According to Roberts rules of order, only those wishing to switch their vote may make the motion to reconsider. 

If you ever watch house and senate procedure, typically after a vote, the person acting as chairman will say something like "the motion to reconsider is laid on the table" which means we are getting rid of the option to reconsider (unless someone immediately objects to it). In this case, they didn't pay the motion to reconsider on the table, which means a motion to reconsider is still an option.

Just like the only states with fraud are the swing states he lost
Half the world 

Instagram, Whatsapp are huge
F calls we pirate everything. 

Firestick = free tv
Thanks man, good to know
That one month investment timeframe is the pinnacle of patience.
I hope not
I bought calls at the top and lost $600
He fires ANYONE who conflicts with his thoughts / feelings.  He only keeps people who are 1) universally liked by everyone 2) fall in line and do what he says.   

He has been like this for his entire presidential tenure.   I see nothing different or special about this one.   Nor do I see this causing any changes in the outcome of the election.

He could be buying FNKO
doesn't make any sense that you'd post that in this thread tbh
First put the percentage sign after the number then go from there.
Call it whatever you want i made 2000% idc

You're a really good son.  I'm getting teary eyed.

Oh, no, you're just a degenerate.  Puts on your family!
Year left mean it ain’t expired
Damn I thought I was retarded
NIO bulls just when everyone has forgotten about us, we strike, and we strike it big! NIO 55+
Yea I’m down 1500 the past week. Will hold though earnings I suppose unless I can regain that shit.
Don't they trigger randomly and fuk u up?
It was more red yesterday, and became green by open.
Oh umm well Ritalin is better than bad drugs.
Trueee
My dad brought 15,000 shares of $NIO at 8$

Calls on my inheritance
Well he did submit a [13D filing to the SEC today](http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/a123d57a-c9de-4d0b-9667-3d10bd31656a), which is required whenever an entity wishes to purchase more than 5% of a company’s equity. It could be happening.

Yolo on IRBT
Withdraw your initial investment, then if it all goes tits up it is pretty much just a video game
Volkswagen or BMW. UBS too

Hope ur right brother
Coupe Deville?
You don’t want that, it’ll make you an emotionless blob. But yeah, I feel ya. It’s been over 5 years and I still haven’t gotten over someone completely. I haven’t seen or spoken to them in about 4 years but I still think about them every day and know if I saw them I’d fall all over again.
Thank you. I have the cash for the 500 shares at my call and think I should buy them for the long(er) hold.  

The confusion comes in when you look at the profit from the calls today and trying to crystal ball the future. I'm too stupid for this shit.

Why you being a narc? are you here to monitor and report to the mm’s or hedge funds?

Who’s still using it?
what part of the us is warm all year round ? over 70 degrees preferably. hate this cold ass weather in ny fk all that.
The money is already gone (pumped into the economy) and the damage is done. Hell if they've dropped out that's freed up space for someone who actually wants to be there, that's worth rewarding. 

Write it off and forget about it, maybe they'll buy a new TV or more heroin or something who gives a shit.
I like to cash out $100 and watch thousands upon thousands that I could have made go to a nice home.
Most likely issue is deep ITM: If you check any stock options even a couple years forward, the deep ITM ones are strictly priced for execution at the given day, so they got absolutely zero extrinsic value. Just intrinsic. $38 to $50 shouldn't be that deep ITM that it has no intrinsic value, but possibly low volume is another major issue. Often low volume options won't even offer execution benefit prices.

&#x200B;

Edit: For example, for deep ITM calls check any major Stock (AAPL, FB, anything), option prices for 2022, they have no extrinsic value.

Edit2: Low volume options wont offer execution prices because they know nobody executes really, and they want theta / swings to eat more of the option price.
Like my shorts.   If cruises aren’t another catastrophe waiting to happen then I’ll happy pay my dues.
Yeah you are so right on that, I had shares of BA that were like -5% for months then sold my entire position and bought calls for Jun 21 in hopes that vaccine pump would make me lucky
That guy acting like he hasn’t seen someone flamethrowin’ someone else before
I really wanted an AR-10 to go with the 15’s
But I bought an M1 national match instead.

Honestly my favorite gun I own. Recoil is NOTHING. If i make a little more on the stock market this week I was looking at a standard MFG 1911 so I can do a premium GI load out.
Anyways, goodluck
What is {x}?
PLTR volume is off the charts. Looking at another comfy 15% day tomorrow
this and the government always super over pays for everything...I worked for the government and remember ordering regular ass boxes of pens and seeing them marked at like 20 bucks a box on the charge sheet

Welcome.
2 steps to become a multi millionaire-
1. Invest half of your net worth in iRobot
2. Buy SE puts with your second half
Don't use stop losses with Robinhood. Your outstanding order will be targeted.  Just set a limit price to sell that you're happy with and leave it.
Im hoping retail tanks a bit after the massive gains today so i can pick up some cheap calls
This is the way. Tomorrow is the day of reckoning. How it moves will tell you everything you need to know. Bang or bust.
God dammit
Makes me wanna jump out of my bed and actually do something. It's basically like coffee but stronger and with a much more pronounced effect. Be glad that u can get it with prescription.
How u gonna afford your wednesday lambo if you get stopped out
after tomorrow, nobody will be able to.
SEC more like suck me
What's up with $FB

Seems so undervalued and no love from the market
That’s when you know you made the right decision
I recovered your password it is gaybear42069
This is the way
Dude we’re on a bubble that’s about to drop 5-6% in the next week. If you buy now you’re going to break even. Just play swing trades. Find reasons why a stock might go up or down and track them.
Dude is gonna make so much more than $35mil being Netflix's next Tiger King.
I feel exposed. Been lurking a few days. Just bought some shares and thought about buying a monthly today.
what are some good boomer euro stocks?

Why is hinge like almost all fatties
Found a new spac to buy into tomorrow. Will post ticker once I take a position.
Lol Big Brain
Forgot to mention earlier, rug pull is tomorrow btw
Were you using gmail, and did you have 2fa enabled on your google account? Was your email password shared with any other accounts that might have been compromised? (check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ ). If using gmail, what shows up when you check the show recent account activity link at the bottom of the page. Sorry for asking even more questions, but I've been investigating these robinhood hacks the last couple of weeks.
Yeah 50000 shares not $50k. Read the post again retard
Yeah so [Ryan Cohen submitted a 13D SEC filing](http://news.gamestop.com/static-files/a123d57a-c9de-4d0b-9667-3d10bd31656a). This is required when an entity wishes to purchase more than 5% of a company’s equity. He’s gonna fucking buy Gamestop. Short squeeze could be imminent
Yup I am still trying to get over a girl who I convinced myself was the one and she was definitely not
I wouldn’t hold through earnings. If you do make sure you’re over leveraged on 25% OTM strangles.
No problem
I was a bit worried about that.
Nobody want me man 😭
Damn thats what I shouldve done with my shares.
NKLA *breathing intensifies*
Tsla already increased$ from last Q when they we’re supposed to be in s&p
Suddenly he has morals???
It will take awhile mate, don’t hurt your self just get up and stretch if you have to
So this is like a long 10 year stock, probly just buy shares and hold? That all sounds reasonable to me. I would prefer to try calls but if it has to be years I would rather buy shares.
I don’t have access to a time machine. Is that how you sell something that is expired and also has a year left.
Don't act like you could afford it
At least a third of it.
😇😴
Yeah, I was thinking the same. It’s been red for like 7 days now. The 3-day rule has been past lol. How many more sellers can there be.
THESE ARE THE MOST RIGGED FUTURES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! SINCE WHEN DOES THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA (Investing.com) DECIDE THE INDICES FUTURES? THE NASDAQ IS GREEN, BY A LOT!
If draft kings arent in your plans tmrw think again lol
Sounds like a hoax from the global elites, possibly to get us into some sort of quasi-Muslim facial coverings on the road to full blown Sharia Law. Bullish for tech
turn up the radio
It’s not about living in lockdown. It’s truly an us vs them thing between the right and the left and that’s just how the virus broke.
SBE
To add to that, if he wants to hold he could buy the calls back and then roll out to a later date and a higher price and re-sell. I just did that with my 100 shares I have... It was only $35 bucks, but seems like if you're planning to hold long term it can work pretty well
Great for escaping too!
I haven’t bought puts in a long time but I bought them for FUBO because who the fuck is paying for that bullshit. Anyways you should probably inverse me it’s gonna moon tomorrow
Mazda thinks it’s so good they say it twice ;)
He’s just morally against it, still a great investment buying the dips
Bro same I had this chick come out of no where in my life and I caught feelings for absolutely no reason and now I’m bag holding this shit until I’m Over her
Seriously; can I cast my shares votes to him?
I hope NIO opens fucking flat
They would send him right back here for zero portfolio diversity, I guess he is stuck in limbo.
Made 25% in NETE.
Whoah dude, save some pussy for the rest of us
UVXY
50k stock purchased when it was $0.03

1.66m stock x $3 = $5mil
Early entry into the AI/Government space pretty much solidifies them as Facebook. Their advantage is their insane amount of data from previous DoD contracts. 1000 other companies are at an immediate disadvantage.

It's a bit worse than that but thanks for the kind words!
BABA getting cucked again in HK, what's new?
reasons for why he just fired that guy can only be malicious I feel..
"I wanna be clear, I do not respect the SEC, I do not respect them"
NIO bulls. Hold strong. Winter is coming
lets face doesn't matter what they do if people aren't willing to play ball
[deleted]
Should’ve re worded it. A worthless contract**
Technically it shouldn't change the price, because even though there are more shares, they gain cash from the sale to counteract the difference.

It's all about how people perceive the sale. For NCLH it signals to investors that they need more cash to survive, which isn't a good thing.

TSLA went up when they did a share offering earlier this year, since people perceived it as them wanting more cash to accelerate their growth.
RKT
Vroom has a good business model but it’s not suited for the future. With Biden leading, ev sales are expected to go up but since there aren’t many used ev vehicles in the market, I don’t see vroom being a go-to place for car buyers. Instead, they would simply place an order from the original website hassle free.
[deleted]
What do you think it would take to get LYFT at $30 by Friday? I just need like 30% off
use earnings to buy puts and keep the money printing
Wait until this dude learns about the hogwarts magic of trailing stop losses. 

Minds will be blown.
The more time I spend on this sub, the more I believe a new form of mathematics, which I cannot comprehended cause obv I’m retarted, has been invented.
Was gonna ask how a poor fuck like you was buying basically ATM TSLA calls until I realized you bought them way OTM before the S&P news. Gambling at it's finest.
There were more air strikes during Obama's term than under George W. Bush. Don't underestimate dems.
Lmao. Wtf meng. Im still diamon handing the majority. In fact I plan to exercise  a few. The ultimate diamond hand. But noooo wsb hate shares

You shut your mouth
☝️perfect explanation.
Not happening. Lol
It's sterile and I like the taste
You'd be lucky to get 5
What calls to buy?
futures down .2% and people calling for circuit breakers...thats how you know its a bull market
As much as I'd like to heckle you as a boomer theta ganger, I'm thinking of taking this route soon. I'm not as old as you, but far from the age of the youngins here.

Keep on rocking. You probably sleep soundly not having weekly/monthly options to stress about.
They use a name from lord of the rings and one of their projects is named after the batman universe. How they fuck are they not getting copyright lawsuits left and right?

I work in supply chain for XPO logistics and Albertsons has been our fastest growing program apparently for the last 5 months on the west coast
I exited today with a $17 profit lol 

After their 750m offering it's done for, no longer a meme
If I don't get the Marlin I'll just bring my AR-10, but I don't wanna risk one of my competition guns so I might go for the marlin.
Congrats on retirement bro. Don’t spend it all on a yacht.
Considering it... wish options were available
Going to add more tomorrow. It’s looking stable around here. Says 2.9 days to cover the shorts. Will probably explode to ATH once the regulatory stuff clears.
Is whining on twitter until he steps down considered a “coupe”? Because that’s all I see lol
No but you still will
Circuit breaker tomorrow
The party is only starting. It could easily double by EOY.
"I hope plunging means up and 75 means 200" literally me with AMZN last week 🤣 RIP
I'm sorry you lost your 3 free stocks, but at least your parents both showed you their support by signing up!
There's no reason to touch it imo. The valuation went to the moon and the XLNX deal killed any remaining momentum it had. I think a lot of people also want to see what the next ER is going to look like, how the financials are stacking up, and what guidance is gonna be moving forward.
EOSE after hours makes me feel good 🙂

light skin Asian? lol I thought it was just tanned Asian or Asian but I guess there are three shades of Asian
eli5: gamble on options and if you make anything put it in etfs
OMFG I was just thinking of this. Same mannerisms, similar face...it's fucking freaky dude. They are clones for sure.
The competency of their engineers and data scientists over the last decade is just through the roof. When you work in tech you start to notice trends on resumes, the top 1 percent of talent tend to move strictly from companies like google, apple, Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn/Microsoft. 

I’ve been a tech recruiter at an agency for the past 7 years and when I manage to get a former Palantir engineer to respond back to outreach messages I get giddy inside because I know anyone of my startup clients would kill to employ them if given the opportunity. And Palantir has fleets of these people.

This type of talent is usually reserved for extremely dominant tech giants who bring in massive profits. Since Palantir is not yet there, but has been in process for 17 years I have to imagine that they’re gonna be fucking massive when all things are said and done. They already have separated themselves as strictly just government oriented and half their business is now in the enterprise sector (which is highly scalable). 

I think Palantir will help lead us out of this COVID vaccine tracing problem and I also believe Palantir will rise to the top as a responsible, USA friendly tech company while places like Twitter and Facebook get their data tools turned upside down and regulated.
Unfair of you to assume this retard has taken the SATs
Soros is out on PLTR? WHO THE FOOK IS THIS GUY 🐻 🌈
My plan is remain in the fetal position until Baba finally goes green.
I have one that’s Jan22 42c for $16.25 and one (that’s not a leap) for Jan21 43c for $9.20.

I have 2 more that are less than ideal, a 1/22 $75c that I bought for $12.15 that I wanted to dump for easy profit and one that’s a 11/20 $30c that I bought for $15.30 and am probably dumping first thing tomorrow

As you can probably tell I have no clue what I’m doing
Math mother fucker, do you understand it?

I sold Tesla $600 2022 calls I bought in March lows because I thought (as before this insane rally) Tesla was back to hovering at 300 level for another few years and I don't want dead cash. Haha, classic "I would have had 2 million in 4 months story"
Found the pee guy
Yeah I wanted to see an all out war in the final movie, Woody Harrelson with rocket launchers, Phillip Seymour Hoffman with a bazooka. 

Instead we got a movie about feelings. They didn't lean into it at all.

But was it a TSLA flamethrower though? Important questions!
This is how I lost my Windforce.
Maybe you should all in on it
which stonk/spac to all in shares?
Both. Plus PLUG
By issuing shares to people who will buy them lol
AMD has been good to me
Road flares and pistols are good for wolves, I saw a black bear about a week ago though. Haven't seen any grizzlies but I know they're up here.
In that span of tesla running from 200-2200, market makers lost hundreds of millions of dollars selling retail those call options. I’m tryna recreate something similar boys
It definitely exists
tesla is printing puts $$$$
Speak for yourself.  NIO back to 40 basically confirmed, 🌈🐻 climax incoming.
Or held a couple hundred shares
I literally just found out there was a stop loss button and hold for 90 days trade option on robinhood.

I don't have to constantly refresh all day????
so all in PLTR calls. got it.
Pretty sure that cat has a home now whether you accept it or not.
Couldn’t be me
Ah, the land of freedom and opportunity
Advanced Money Destroyer. Never again. But it’s like that toxic ex you keep going back to cuz her pussy fire.
Dipping sauce for tendies
You obviously don’t watch futures very often. This is actually pretty normal. Get back to me when we’re more than -2% so I can buy more calls on a wedge.
Tesla gonna be red tomorrow ain’t it
Two thoughts:

Is it Roman numeral for 70? Or was someone searching for the movie XXX and missed a letter?
I invested in ev and now they are flatter than a pancake. Thanks wsb. Easy 500 buck loss again
anyone believe in bill spacman?
If you don't know the past of the 8 years of administration before Trump and aren't betting on RTN and LMT now. I don't know how to help you
[deleted]
It would be covered calls in your case since you already have the shares. Basically you are picking a price point above the current price you would be ok to let the shares go. Since you have 4300 shares, you can sell 43 covered calls. If the price does not reach that target by expiration you get to keep the shares and the premium. If the price goes up to and past your target price then you have to sell your shares at the target price but you still keep the premium. Basically you are collecting money while you wait. 

I just checked the December 24th 2020 expiration. The 25 strike is selling for 1.05$, multiply that by 43 and you are looking at over 4300$ in premium. Even the 25$ strike for next week is paying .25$ meaning you can sell 43 of them and collect over 1k.

So it just depends if you want to hold on to your shares long term or if you are ok letting them go.
so nobody wanna talk about how orange is methodically going about a coupe
Can get like a solid 7 hours sleep. Plenty
Pltr has been here for like 20 years. They work with the gov. This isnt the next google. Buy and hold dont trade
I missed the train on upwk and I’m pissed about it. Sold my 22.5c’s 2 days before their earnings and compleeetely missed out on it
He told me to sell them actually
Honestly. Follow unusual option activity. Get in and out on meme stocks. Be quick.
Dumb boomers

How the fuck do you get $5m from 50000 * $3
You should watch eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
Did she have tiddys tho? Asians with tiddies are the real MVP
What the hell? I thought they went out of business? All the Albertsons around here closed up shop years ago
Concentration of funds builds wealth. Diversification of funds preserves it.
It being a new TSLA would be okay with me.
I’ll definitely pick up some then. Probably the $300c I don’t mind the premium over the higher strikes for safety
Yeah. Now it will finally moon like VALE

Your dad has been staying down there to make room for your moms boyfriend. Be prepared to bunk it.
Think it twice as she has been right on several measures that the Fed should have taken or took later ... She is right on many things.. JPow is just a lawyer, this woman has been on several debates around monetary policy since ever and she has an economics degree... Man .. things don't look good for the printer.
Thanks for the good advice future me!  The only thing is by "poor man" I mean I won't be buying the shares.  Just using a long-dated call as "collateral" against the weekly calls I sell.  Honestly not even sure RH allows such shenanigans.  But I might still try bc I like trying out new ways to not make money lol
Looks like nio 7p 11/20 will pay out after all. I wish I was retarded enough to buy it.
[deleted]
Welp I guess since WSB can't explain this company it's time to short dis bitch! You'd have had a better argument saying they were unethical. This is all you need to know about them, they build software that is used to protect, kill, and track people. Whatever value you put on that is up to you. They also build out solutions to help optimize human performance in the work place but who cares about that.
Both just getting started.
[deleted]
Over it lol. Jumped into SOLO and PLTR
Nice work cock sucka!
Ditto. I have 100 shares and I have 3 options. They expire on 11/20, so I’ll sell tomorrow. Have some PLTR options and shares. Gonna see how the market changes after tomorrow before I do calls or puts on NIO. Would rather call, but it’s so up and down. Doing both puts and calls and making money is great lol.
Order has been restored.
Straight to FDs is the way.
MTG
I watched mine go from plus 30% to down 35% in about two hours. Had to hop out of them. They’ll obviously start printing tomorrow for you now.
puts printing $$$$$$$
BABA reminds me of when I thought boeing was going to 0 in march
Me: this time, as I deposit cash, I'll only focus on one or two plays at a time. 

Also me 14min later: *18, 19, okay 20 plays currently, maybe I should close one*
Dead cat bounce is synonymous with "fuck it, I'm buying".
I’m still up 120k from march crash, I got in at the right time but I sure as hell could have gotten out a lot faster without seeing this stupid graph 600 times a day
Wtf, go back to r/investing. He didn't even have any crazy positions and you know nothing about his situation, how can you be a fiduciary?
I know everybody has been screwed by AMD for the past couple months but the thing has been consolidating for quite awhile. Anybody playing AMD with these NVDA earnings coming up??
I don't. Which is probably why I lost all my money this year.
ccl to 20 eow
Count me in I’ll be the guinea pig
All they gotta do is float
They've got to beat WORK. One time I was tracking it it was like 2 weeks straight red.
Congrats on the gains bro
Have you seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?
No kidding. The finale ruined the whole series for me as well.
So if I want a surprise party all I need to do is commit securities fraud?
ATT to $200
I agree. I expect a small green tomorrow then the INEVITABLE downfall.
I lost like 12k last time I fucked with PRPL, but I think I’m ready to do it again. 

I got 10k to blow on this thing.

So, debit spreads again? Look like I missed today bounce up. 

Should I wait for the next red day and go in? I haven’t been watching this thing since I got ramrodded last time. 

Im not seeing anything as usual on their next earning date. Any idea of when that’s popping off? 

We aiming for 4/2021 or 1/2022?
That app makes you want to spend. I have a second account with td I rarely touch it or buy stocks with it even if I have a fuck loads of money. But with RH idk why I just can’t control myself from buying more and more till at 0
AMC didn’t have these retard post-vaccine spikes....but holding out hope
Go back to r/investing. Wtf are shares anyways?
If we can do a few more we can do some WSB caroling...


Tesla calls, Tesla calls, Tesla all the way

Oh what fun it is to buy a zero day FD, hey!

Nio calls, Nio calls, Nio all the way

Oh what a run it is to buy one more SPY FD, yay!
just all in PLTR
This due diligence is brought to you by the DEW!

Don’t just do the diligence, DEW the Diligence!
Just saw the HOTEST light skin Asian chick at the gym ... would SIMP so hard for that ass
Just smoke weed
Especially when beating means only losing $135 million instead of $200
I am a 100% PLUG fanboy and I would say take a few weeks off. With the pricing of the shares they just issued and the dilution of SP and the option for more to be purchased for another couple weeks logically SP should stay near the secondary offering price. That being said logic means nothing in this market
Or maybe it crashes 15% and dude buys tons of stuff, then it spends the next 12 months dropping another 30%. Dude then sells everything.
Ya, saw a comment earlier from someone saying that this a really stupid move on NCLH'S part, since they're floundering as is with uncertain times ahead. NCLH could go the route of HTZ and WSB could try buying a cruise charter this time around
It's possible there are large spreads if it's a low volume stock, but almost all the time it's not a good idea. Look it up with some prices and you will see. I'll be surprised if you can find a single one where exercising is better.
Damn you are not even human, you're just a bull with internet.
Rule#3 violation.
Wait, some of you fuckers actually sell expired leaps when there’s like a year left on them?
Oh no...I called a put instead 😖
Yea at open then sold at the top.
This is such a good idea for some great premiums. Too bad OP doesn't understand. Literally free couple grand
The fact that you got downvoted for this is really the embodiment of wsb
$400 before $500. You’ve been warned.
Link?
ok SPY 11/20 370c at noon
How I felt in 13’ with WRES after Marketwatch recommended them as a long term buy. First day after I bought +40%, but bankruptcy the next day. The good old days
To be fair, that pos has already gotten 50k in tax payer money when he received the student loans. Biden wants to write it off.
Those blue graphs look a lot nicer and a lot more level than the panic button graphs I’ve been staring at... hmmm
Begone
That’s me
Bull shit
I just have some shares but I am in at $45 and $53. I was watching it climb today and was going to dump it all at $50 to break even then buy it all back when it dropped back down to like $45.

Cats are most active at dawn and dusk.
She was highly critical of the fed keeping interest rates low after 2008 and providing liquidity. Her argument is that more liquidity and low rates enables reckless borrowing that is unsustainable and eventually falls apart. 

So applying her theory (which I've said over the last few years pre corona that alot of the easy credit but weak economics vis a vis labor demand and inequality between the top and bottom) is that there should be less injections and higher rates which would help stabalize and protect against massive crashes 

So if you raised the funds rate to idk say 6 percent that would basically restrict large purchases to only those who could afford it. Now if there was responsible policy in place before hand people could live with 6 percent rates but right now any increase in rates with the downwards economic pressure isn't going to work out. And continuing to average down and provide more liquidity and stimulus won't work either unless the labor side gives up and takes much less (last sentence is my words)

Bottom line is do you think that we can dig out selves out of this whole with everyone intact financially? Probably not. But if the fed in 2009 was more judicious with the policy the damage to the economy from corona might have been limited.
Cash gang after today. Looking to reenter tesla tomorrow or Thursday.
I'm already long NVDA shares and I'll be selling naked -5-10% OTM NVDA puts tomorrow for earnings. Maybe I'll throw in a small ATM call spread for fun.
Can you imagine trying to explain what the fuck Palantir does to your uncle at thanksgiving and why your options(fun explaining that too!) blew up in your face and why you need to borrow $5k?

Lol Trump is just a schemer and conman. His dad set most of the groundwork up long ago and Trump rode on and made use of his personality to get over on people. Iirc, if Trump just dumped everything in the S&P from the getgo he would be worth significantly more than he is now. (whatever the real number is)

Its another meme stock propped up by WSB, the next NIO. Target- $40 to sell
drinking your pee won't kill you. It's actually quite healthy.
Palantir for the long term imo
Well my Baba call is already fucked, so I would be ok because my Nio Put would print hard.
damn too cute. no homo.
I mean, it’s a shame he didn’t get away with it. Unfortunately WSB is the only place he’s getting the respect he deserves.
Because their positions are bleeding money.

WSB got wrecked on NIO unless you sold strangles.
Ooo if you dont own a marlin, id go with the gun. You’ll be happy

What do you think we should buy?
Don’t listen to him. Lies.
Gov needs software to compete and stay relevant.  So they have to find someone.... but their are some issues.

- They need a software company that doesn’t have foreign control, but must be large enough to handle big contracts

- Government contracts always have a ton of hoops to jump through and you must stay in compliance year over year as laws change.

- Government contracts are usually really big with low margin

Now what software company actually wants that business or can comply. Most big ones have some level of foreign interest influencing their company.  Also they are not set up to deal with government contracts and all the loopholes.  Also no software company wants a 10% margin client. So Palantir is king... 

So now this is known so why would Palantir grow ... well Palantir’s growth is based on its ability to take its product to private sector companies.  Can they do it? Maybe... hopefully... and that is what people are betting on....

But I think they will succeed because if you are any company in any industry and you hope to get a portion of your revenue from the government and you have a choice between two software companies (PLTR and other) assuming all else is equal you will go with PLTR cause they can open up connections for you in the government contracts.  They are a familiar name.  

So now Palantir bagging these other higher margin clients grow.  Also I feel like not only will government spending increase in 10 years with higher taxes etc, but I think government spending on software/data analytics will increase dramatically. 

We will see though just my thoughts

1000 shares at $10.07 and some random options

NIO or Palantir?
I’m gonna sleep well knowing there’s a 0% chance I get assigned on these NIO puts
So, definitely wait until expiration even if you plan on purchasing the shares it sounds like. Also, if the stock is doing well and far ITM, theta won't be as big of a factor, correct? Kinda? Because the delta will offset the theta?

12/31 - $15 call - 5 times
Momentum
Where do you start your research and what dartboard are you throwing at?
If the stock is less than $30 he losses. Doesn't need to go to $0.

Also, there will be 1000s of data analytic companies between now and then. You sure these guys are Facebook instead of myspace or friendster?

Is investing.com a little misleading?
That's just short run though. If this was really econ (which we know the market doesn't really follow long term), the demand curve will also adjust to compensate. And demand for that stock is dependent on if it survives COVID or not. So it's gonna be one of those stocks that will probably 2x in price if things get back to normal or goes to 0 if it bankrupts. That's really too technical since we all know trading is randomly flipping coins 😂
I feel like BABA is like WMT and they are both annoying as shit to watch but great long term.

I know this is basically a joke sub and you are getting the advice that is expected, but the answer to your question is an emphatic yes. Save yourself now, you're not going to make money trading, very few people do long term.

Theta decay is just the decay in the value of the time left in an option, so if you intend on buying shares upon expiration anyways, theta really shouldn’t matter to you. If you, for example, had a $9.5C in PLTR expiring tomorrow, that option should be worth about $8.35 (closing price pltr - strike price). Now, let’s say you think this is the next Amazon and want shares for the long haul. You could pocket the $8.5 profit and then reinvest @ the current price, which is $17.85. Or, if you have the cash, you can exercise your option and have a cost basis of $9.5. Just depends on your strategy and how badly you want to own the underlying.
PLTR we continue rally ?

Lol if you would have waited to cover you would have been fine.
A healthy correction would drop it sub 300. Not happening. Even a 10% drop it to about 324/325 and even that ain’t happening.  Back to 350 would be like when you trip on carpet when walking and then just keep going.

Yes it’s called a call calendar spread. The real genius though is you just buy back the call and sell the following week, every Friday. Or let it expire but the point is if you buy 1 call a year from now you should be making 51 calls worth of premium on that one call, too. All it really is is just theta arbitrage... and you should absolutely be doing it too
At open or ban
Where did you see that? I don’t like Biden but I swear mfs just make these numbers up out of thin air.
I would never do this because the SEC would send me to federal pound me in the ass prison, but if you want to do that buy shares instead of calls

Haha I personally don’t play with options much. Just have 2 calls for pltr and solo for like next year. 1 call for solo for the end of this week which I am going to loose money was my first option it was way OTM.  I think you getting upvoted:
1- there’s zero diversification so r/investing will def shun you for
2- pltr is currently a hype stocks so if you yolo it the subs love that
Pltr is 27% of my RH portfolio stocks . So I hope this is going up
Ah I didn't realize
Thanks!
They caught osama bin laden, and that was 10 years ago
Been thinking this since SPY hit the double top around Oct 11th or so. But shit keeps goin up

One thing tho is that just because FANG and shit isn't mooning doesn't automatically mean this is fake and gay. Growth to Value to Growth rotations happen and there was no way people were gonna keep dumping everytime into overbought tech when there were so many other sectors and small caps that had been beaten into the dust.

These fucking idiots. If you want the stock sell the call and buy stock. Don’t exercise bc you’ll lose a shit load of extrinsic value. If you want more upside, roll your calls into higher strike calls with lower delta. Higher risk, higher reward. But do not exercise.
DKNG is back baby
There’s a reason why the dividend yield is so high. 

Generally a company paying a dividend is basically saying we can’t do anything better with your money than you can take some back. REITs are a different story as the only reason to own it is for the dividend. But historic yields look good because folks know the cash flow is going to dry up in a lot of these sectors and the share price is down.
I am staying away from puts in general cause I can't win with them, but I am already 3k into nio options. I was thinking about buying more nio instead of getting into PLTR but idk I might wait for some more news atm on both.

These CCL puts have done more damage to my health than COVID ever has. Who is buying this shit?
I noticed $FB Dating puts the hottest girls at the top and the more you swipe, the sadder it gets
yessirski!! sold 💸
BABA is fine man. Massive well known company. Damn near every fund in the US has some BABA in it.

Jack Ma was running his mouth recently so the CCP punished him. The dip will be bought. The ANT ipo will still happen. BABA will continue to be a money printer.

Low liquidity issues.
Check the OTM puts of the same strike...ITM calls have such a wide spread it's going to be hard to actually put on the trade at those prices you listed. You probably have to pay like 20-30 more cents of spread.
Yikes. Good luck. I want to grab some longer dated 500c's
Oh lord that sounds awful. Good luck!
They are gonna have to pry these calls from my cold, dead hands

OP. Wait, buy ITM, and then sell OTM calls at 1month2e against your ITM calls. Poor mans covered calls and you can reduce your cost basis to counter Theta decay.
Good. Only ~1k away from my ATH. Looking to exit options soon. Hopefully 🥭 doesn’t cuck me.
Christ is there anything in there to help my PFE calls which have been totally killed by this spin off?
Positions?
Pretty sure that’s not as big an advantage as you think. They said in their call that their customer base is growing and enjoying the product and service. And NIO cars look pretty nice as well
You're not wrong, but we're only weeks away from a new cycle of "Markets rise on stimulus talks between Biden administration and McConnell".

Honestly, just embrace the bubble until it pops.

Waste of money. If you like that space, tesla and nio is the way to go. Everything else is mostly just a distraction

What’s the Max bid? You need to know that options run by the bid/ask spread and not the average. An option that reads 2.50 might be worth .05 or 4.85+ depending on the bid/ ask spread and how bullish/bearish the sellers are.
-5%!!
They had an auction of oil leases in the New Mexico part of the Permian a few months ago, a far more lucrative oil area.  No bids.  Companies aren't looking for new acreage.
With a potential $5 mil sitting there I'd go to a fucking securities lawyer.
EVs are the way and the chinese govt will back it for sure
Somebody call Ja and see what he has to say about this
They aggregate the data sources a customer gives them. The government already has all of the data, palantir just makes it actionable.

The Fed’s aggressive liquidity injections are showing up as asset bubbles in sophisticated global financial markets even as domestic consumer price indices show only modest increases; this two-tier effect favors “whales” who can wager millions on exotic credit instruments while stiffing modest savers with negative real returns.

Agree, TA is bullshit. But this is not about TA, it is about the most bullish set of circumstances for TSLA (rising SPY, vaccine news, S&P inclusion, robust earnings, exploding deliveries). And TSLA failing to get anywhere close to $500. Papa Musk delivered but no one cared. Where are the index funds, where are the hedge funds?

Could it be that Tesla will cut a side deal for a secondary offering to ETFs? That would be substantially dilutive.
Yeah, if you want to fuck up his life use Robbin Hood. There’s a fucking reason why it’s called that. They take your money. Don’t be fucking retarded dude
Lots
This guy probably nuts more than my net worth
Reason why i sold a few calls today I was up on. One was 200% and the other was 50%. It’s so up and down it’s just crazy. Still gonna dump money into it, but I don’t want to be a fucking idiot.
There is a slight advantage for Tesla and that’s the same like Apple. It’s made in the west. That’s all there is. But market share wise, I don’t think Apple has the bigger pie in China vs other guys.

It seemed cheap at the time and they are touting their future in green energy, lots of restructuring, cutting dead weight and access to some of the best oil and natural gas fields. I'm selling at 25, hoping to get there before April of next year, if it doesn't I'll hold it longterm, they pay dividends. Hope they scoop up a bunch of solar/wind generation. I would imagine that they will also get in on the small nuclear reactor game. If they truly want to go green, refining is dead and generation is the game. At some point I'll look at small renewable generators that are primed for acquisition.
That’s exactly what I’m doing actually. It’s bound to pull back a bit. I’ll make a couple bucks and close those positions and open up calls with higher strike prices for 2023. I’m actually already up an ok amount on my puts. I have 12/4 $18 puts. Gonna close these tomorrow most likely

An option's price is made up of two components - time value and stock value. Time value lowers as the date approaches expiration, and is 0 at expiration time.

Exercising gives you 0 for the remaining time value, and is a worse deal than closing and buying the stock pretty much always.

Look in your closet
It went 48% today and has weekly options. Don’t see the issue here. NIO was just as trash pretty recently.
Y'all know RobinHood makes their money selling your trades microseconds before executing them?
Outta the way you
The current setup is eerily similar to January when everyone was balls deep in calls in SPCE, LK, any shit meme stock that was going up, which hit a fever pitch after tech stocks went vertical for two months. I think it’s actually more retarded now than it was then. I don’t see how we don’t get a massive correction or crash in the next 1-2 months especially with the QQQs not able to make a new high or come close. The stocks that were making new highs every day in August are now merely able to tread water. Feel like the market is completely news driven now and waiting for a reason to fall

Well I’m unemployed and living at my parents house rn. My plan is to be a bum and stay with the family until March, when I intend to backpack the Pacific Crest Trail which will take me about 5-6 months. So I might be willing to sell shortly after that. But If there’s still growth to be had and I enjoyed the backpacking experience I might just visit the family for the holidays again and then do the same thing again the following year, except I’d like to hit up the Appalachian Trail. 

My end game is to be able to buy a house in full though. And it needs to either be in the greater Bay Area, greater Sacramento area or the greater Portland metro area. Doesn’t need to be a great house but I realllllllly need to own property so my mind can finally start to relax.

My biggest return ever would have been the ride on RUN from 8 to 80. I sold at 18 where it had settled many times before dropping back to 12. About three days later they announced the Vivint deal and crushed my dreams. Cost me about 40k in gains. I feel you bro.
He's really rich and evil  I hear he hires hackers to track all criticism to its source.  Probably just a rumor.
Earnings are meaningless . The only thing that matters is if it was unexpected. Up or down
They are pretty much the only ones writing innovative software right now that solves extremely complex problems. Not pumping out crappy iterations of the same product or a “cloud” version and try to sell it to anybody
Pfft, fuck you with your money!

No doubt Nokia has to change their business model (just like Cisco) in order to survive. I’m sure they’ll still sell hardware, especially legacy products and services, but Telcos are looking to squeeze out proprietary hardware and software vendors (see my reply on O-RAN under the deleted reply). Unless Nokia can come up with a compelling product or service telcos are willing to pay a premium for, 5G isn’t going to be a cash cow for them. Remember when they made the most popular cell phone in the world and then they got squeezed out of the cell-phone market? Same thing is going to happen unless the come up with something compelling.
The "discussions" there make this place look like a gathering of geniuses.

When? What r u holding?
I'm looking into buying some IEP for that phat dividend in my "safe" portfolio (don't judge me, 15.3% return is better than most of the retarded plays on here) and in research one red flag was that they owned Trump Entertainment Resorts. This led me to the Wikipedia page to read up and holy shit. Just fucking how can a business be run this incompetently..

"The company filed for bankruptcy in 2004, 2009 and 2014. It has been a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises since 2016. Trump Entertainment Resorts currently owns one property, Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, which is currently shuttered and vacant."

Artificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for machines to learn from experience, adjust to new inputs and perform human-like tasks. Most AI examples that you hear about today – from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars – rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.

Just take a glance at this sticky. Half the sub is still balls deep in meme calls.
I mean in the morning and evening, but also kind of random sometimes too if she's hungry.
What if the stock goes to $30 a share and I can buy/exercise 500 shares at $17.50 break even price? 

If the profit from selling the call wouldn't cover purchasing the shares, wouldn't buying the shares at the low break even price make more sense? 

I'm not saying you're wrong, just trying to learn real quick before the mods see and ban me for breaking the autist rules of WSB.

Hell yeah, to the 🌝

You have to atleast credit her for not being a liquidty monster. For real there is going to be massive pain when the position start to unwind. Someone's going to lose massively in terms of $$$ or labor.
Don’t feel bad, SPY is hovering around 360. Not like in free-fall.
I also feel like I don't have much idea of what I am doing either. But my profit YTD just crossed $441K. 

Plan after crossing 450K is to do tax loss harvesting to keep gains under $450K

I've only been trading in my 401k since May
SPY would need a month like theCoin just had
Yes but I have no idea so
Aviation companies going up due to vaccine
Buy PLTR dip
Well I expected NIO to beat earnings and here we are
I dont know which is worse...the fact I didnt know albertsons even had a ticker OR the fact this dude yolos on a shitty grocery store
Chart it b4 hand so you have an idea where it’s going, wait until candle closes above resistance to take a position
The strong will survive
Are all the big guys in suits quietly lurking on this sub?

Berkshire dumps airlines. Buys Barrick Gold and sells after 3 months. Dumps most of his banks, goes balls deep into vaccines.

Burry holds onto Boeing for a quarter.

Oaktree and Appaloosa buys BABA in Q2 and sells in Q3.

What happened to "Our favorite holding period is forever"?
you belong in r/investing
Nope, red necks would rather die than live in lockdown
Congrats bro! How much did you drink previously, if you dont mind me asking?
Slight beat
Honestly i can see it going the other way, great ER, people will want to hold

Who the fuck knows
If it wasn’t for the ccp baba would be in the thousands per share
Become them, don’t fight them
Tesla 500 when?
PRPL, TSLA always meme,
You also spent 4 months breaking even. 

If we include that from May. 

You’ve made 33% in ~ half a year. It’s good; but not WSB good. 

r/investing this way
If you wanna go that route with network equipment ERIC is the much safer play tho has less upside. ERIC has been phasing out their legacy business and renegotiated contracts with existing customers to UG them to 5g equipment. They have delivered upside surprises last 2 quarters and continue to gain new accounts and streamline their business. Full disclosure I bought into ERIC when it was at like 6 bucks and followed it day in day out. It was my first 5g pick along with CCI which is a company that owns and operates cell towers.
I will hold 300c 2022 until expy, at some point they’re gonna figure this shit out
Going to put your opinion about the ladies to the side given your flair.
SPY calls, VXX puts, yeah it’s bull gang time
[removed]
Yeah, she's a bengal. Well done.
Fr tho electric cars are PLUNDERING market cap rn. Still minority, but 40% yoy growth
Albertsons? The grocery store that doubles their prices shortly before having a “sale”? Lol
The Dec 31 one has no volume and a wide bid-ask (10.5-14). This doesn't help.
It will.  The after hours drop was before the earnings call and chinese markets closed right before the call, so the stock hasn't moved since.  I expect it to rally like crazy tomorrow.
Hope you held into today. Sold my 10 and 12.5 11/20s I bought during Friday dip at open today for nice gains. Kicking myself for not holding through the massive run up an hour later but hey, 500% gains in two days don’t suck.
All the neighbors are kind of young families. Do older folks not really live in dr Phillips? Feel like they might have made a mistake buying here
No idgaf about this stock really, wouldn't have touched it at $10 (didn't even tho i looked at it), wont touch it now, it might aswell be a new TSLA, not going to bet against ist just because it's shit. Even if it hits $50 i wont regret it tbh. Just drunk ranting. I will never bet against meme stocks, thats the most suicidal thing you can do.
FUCK GEORGE SORROS
Guess who sold BA on the dip today and switched to TSLA 🤡🤡🤡
Brb while I yolo two garden sheds worth of dough on some shit I read about from a retard on the internet... yeet
Looks like a job for pltr
lol yep, fear of global shutdown didnt even kill it as much as a "trade war" lol
Dont get caught holding nothing or worse holding puts when the vaccine approval gets approved
Christmas 🎄
We sell weekly
Lmfao where is that guy that YOLO’d on Kodak? How much is he up?
I bought 5 20c Jan 2022 LEAPS yesterday and sold today for 1k profit easiest money ever. I bought more on the dip because I want to hold longer but I couldn’t resist taking the 1k because i made it so quick.
Seriously though, Battlestar Galactica started out so good and it turned into absolute hot flaming garbage by the end of the third season
This guy also fucks 👇🏻
Sir soros just said na and sold
it's good because in future it can answer retarded writing prompts by itself and you won't have to ask on a degenerate gambling thread
Been averaging down on WBA April calls. Otherwise started BABA 2/19 290 calls today at the low of the day. 

Wish I grabbed some CRM 12/18 calls tho

Thanks 👇🏻
My 401k has a “self directed” option where I can buy things like NIO, UPRO, TQQQ, PLTR, etc. 

Not good.
NIO
One more spy +3% day this month and I can finally do coke off of something other than a homeless cat's butthole
Yea it was hard to hear some stuff but as far as product idk but service for sure, they’re adding a ton of chargeable battery stations around China and I believe you can swap batteries there to get an extended drive time. If that’s true, that’s a massive advantage
I fuck with that
Look to this past summer (july and aug) if you want to understand how the market reacts to this news

Considering I’ve been only trading shorts since last Monday it’s been a struggle. Having to scalp against the position to remain somewhat net flat, waiting for the rug pull coming.
Welcome to the team
Yep, it’s basically Japanification for the whole developed world. It would hurt too many people to cut back on spending (social security is the main liability). We’ve backed ourselves into a wall and unless we can unlock some kind of economic miracle (Mars colonization or something), this won’t end well.
my move tomorrow is to not do what i did today and fomo into tsla, buy at open, wait for a pop that never materialized and only cut loss a minute before close.

it's SPY time tmrrw and that's it. f all this other crap. TSLA had me breaking all the rules only to get rekt as i deserved.

What strike & exp? Expect to see NIO drop or trade sideways..not great news for call holders.
I don't buy at the top. Therefore algos are fake and gay and retarded

This makes no sense, just because your account was hacked doesn't mean your money is gone.  I haven't used robinhood, but are you saying the hackers liquidated all your holdings, linked their bank account, and transferred all the funds out all without Robinhood notifying you?  Shouldn't a social security number from a linked bank account have to match your robinhood account from when you set it up?

Got some lotto spy 375 for next Monday better then buying actually lotto tickets.
I would agree since China is their home country. It probably cost 70% more to own a Tesla there .
The bike actually cost $2100. Your gym membership is $125+(12*20)+(12*25)= $665 Thats about 12 years to pay off with Pelton subscription not 40.

I think your missing the demographic on who's ordering these bikes.
They don't care about cost once one wife, sister, cousin, BEST FRIEND, gets one all the girls need it. They love the leader board. Its like how boys love video games, this is theirs. Pelton is a MMORPG Fitness game. No one cares that their ass hurts from the seat and orders a $30 gel cover to help ease the pain. Its all about the leaderboard and your "output #". Plus the instructors' are really really good at motivation, and for just working out in general. Hell sometimes people play it just to get motivation for zoom meetings. Can't confirm

You are doing it right
yeah, man. Next time I up, I'm selling some.
In robinhood they have what is called a sell to close ratio of 10:1. In other words, you’ll need to sell 10 call contracts in order to close your 1 contract. You’ll even be rewarded with a premium for such an action since you’ll be creating more contracts for the market. Don’t listen to the retard telling you not to listen to wsb. I’m trying to help.

That said, historically, when faced with high inflation, the printer has been tapped again and again to try to reduce the debt (more money = debt is worth less). Inflation is a form of tax: instead of enacting wealth tax, you can print and make the wealth worth less.

tbh, most of the tech companies were meme stocks before they reached to today's level. yes, this also applies to Tesla, tesla is not that over valued if you see it 1-2 years out of the horizon, with the current price and estimated eps, their pe is basically 100 in 2021. Amazon was also once a "meme" stock. Amd is a meme stock too when its trading at lows . 

The point i am trying to make here is that, meme stocks doesn't mean the company is a joke or overvalued, it just imply the fact that this particular stock has been getting  alot of attention from the general market to the point that it became a so called “meme stock”.

Options can be used in non risky ways.  Maybe try theta plays when you're ready.
I had a few calls that i bought over the summer, but whenever BA went below 160 i'd add some more and when it went below 150, i was like, fuck it, ive had enough of this shit and I said FUCK YOUU and sold all my other leaps and went all in BA.

That being said, we need some people on the Fed board to counter the groupthink that we can print our problems away. You can’t beat economics no matter how much they try to with MMT.

Extreme confidence of not only US approval for Berotralstat but also Japan coming before EOY as well as UK in first quarter of 2021.

PDUFA (approval for Berotralstat to treat hereditary angiodema) is 11 trading days away. Company has extreme confidence of US approval. Only current treatment comes from takeda and theirs is IV and NOT a pill. $500K/year treatment. They’re ready to roll day 1 by hiring many of Takedas sales team. Also, galidesivir has news for treatment of Covid-19 comes before EOY, which is already showing promise. Don’t let me forget either about update on Factor D, aka “Pipeline in a molecule”, already has shown promise and the potential is INSANE. Can’t really put a dollar amount on it!

These are not buy and hold plays, these are pump and dumps boomer.
Don't buy stocks you know are overvalued hoping somebody else gets left holding the bag.

Nah, I’m in GMe for the high risk extremely high reward. I’m not gonna get a better possible return on any stock besides GameStop
I just have 200 shares @ 16.00 and I'm gonna load up on another 800 tomorrow when I see any dip. Then it's selling $1000 a week in covered calls (plus whatever stock appreciation I get) until the end of time with this one. This is my kingmaker/quit you are job!!! stock and I feel like I can see exactly what's going to happen in the next few months presciently.
Such a FUCKING meme company, 700m revenue and a 34B market cap... LMAO. I cant express how much I despise this shit. Good fucking luck, they got no moat or anything else. Senseless pump into crash. I mean, I'm happy for you guys for your gains, but this is a pile of shit.
Came here to say green by open
Synthetic options?! I’m gonna come
NOK will hurt you
lol stocks can go down more at 11.
First one's free.
NIO barely red... I think it has a chance to go green tmrw. But FDs probably rip.
They call me Jonny Tsunami because every time I buy puts a fukin tsunami hits me and leaves me with nothing. I had to buy puts on BA today fml
Are there people lining up for this?   I know ours seemed obvious and I did them.   Can’t imagine this melting up all week but who knows.  Maybe it’s an electric cruise ship now.

Lol. Im not chasing ill wait.
yea but those are expensive as fuckkkkk
Isn't PLTR a legit company though? Maybe the run-up has been too fast, but they are a strong long term stock, are they not?
Yup. I am several hours ahead of the US.

Positions or ban.

Fuck you
Yes, but they didn't last very long for me.  Be careful on cold turkey without a doc if you've been a heavy drinker, I ran into seizures after a few days.  Strongly suggest looking into vivitrol if your insurance will cover it, saved my life.  

Keep at it!  You can do this!
I ran out of money buying the dip on NIO and I’m still in the negative lol
I agree, let it tank first 😂
Tbh I feel NIO would moon so much more if they had just gotten a better mic
Feel so bad for BABA call holders, so much positive news yet that stock refuses to pump. Your day has to be coming any time now
They’re pretty niche but their products are top of the line.

If you’re planning on holding for a bit absolutely not, best time could be right now.
Not a big enough market cap
Wait... you are trading responsibly‽
I mean, sure you can give this advice...but does it really matter to the people that made millions over the past few months with NIO? We're not boomers that's holding stocks. We go in and out almost weekly. We already made our money.
No, the CEO is shady for sure. I guarantee that.
I had the same thought about Pfizer, based on incredible news for them, over 10 years ago.  The price is the same.  Do with this information what you will.

BTW I overestimated the gain on my spread. The spread profit was 57% but it tied up $6000 in collateral to make $1200 so more like 20% ROI over a month.

That 80-90% is largely zombie money, boomers piling money into their 401ks and pensions. Retail is more random and erratic, when we set our minds on a meme stock we definitely rock the boat. I think the effect wsb has in individual stocks is probably very large.

Just a word of advice from a 20+ year trader to newbies trading for the first time.

If you are balls deep in meme stocks like NIO, PLTR, etc., get out while you still can. These fucking retarded valuations will not last. This is what veteran traders call retail "euphoria."

Especially be wary of Chinese stocks. So many are total frauds, based on fraudulent data, and traders have been getting burned on them for years.

I just learned about IV Crush and someone can explain it better probably. But here I go.

The IV means that people believe that the stock price will go up significantly in a short period. After the IV lowers (in this case caused by the ER), then people are less likely to be interested in your option. That means the price goes down substantially, because people are less likely to think it’ll go up or down much. 

Sorry if not explained well, I’m retarded
Now you've got the hang of it!
I've been speaking English for over 30 years and I can't figure out what the fuck you just said.

Seriously, like any investors actually care about ethics
Yeah see that’s the problem right there...”betting” learn what a stop loss is buddy
Eh not really that rare. But not all of these meme stocks work out and a lot of the time when they blow up on this sub they're already nearly nearing their highs.

The MMs selling the calls would be bankrupt so the gov will have to use the money to bail them out plus collateral damage so net negative ?

Zing!

I was all in on PLTR long calls until I sold today, and now I’m all in on Monthly PLTR puts. But I’ll be back on those calls babe, don’t you worry.
Also curious
Every time I move I get so emotional. Now I’m thinking about missing the beach w little Remy every day playing fetch and people living him. Still have the condo just won’t be there that often
Happens every month. Last one was big as NIO was PRPL

I had thought that might come this week after last nights news, and it still could. I’m mainly thinking that Becuase of the massive OI on the 25c 20c and 15c expiring Friday, also, someone wrote 6.5k 20p’s expiring Friday. It’s looking unlikely, but who knows

Nah stocks get memes here pretty often there will be another NIO in no time. This sub has very short memory
I mean once every month or two. NIO was a big one, PLTR is normal meme stock level. There’s always some meme stock or another, regardless of if it even prints lol.

Retail investors are developing market destabilizing power. I crunched the number a while back and found it kinda concerning especially when you factor in our kind, we’re also gaining in numbers and capital so strength will increase. Hedge funds are more disciplined and sophisticated, I’d be concerned that they will astroturf and try to engineer pump and dumps using wsb.
Its always on to the next best thing. Pumps and FOMO will be here everyday.
Now is the time to buy The Volcano
IV crush didn't you see that in the 846 other comments about it?
So, what's the update?
Why, trading is about using indicators and proper risk management. What does that have to do with drinking?
You mean today*? And after hours yesterday*? 😂 high how are you?
If PLTR hits 20 tomorrow I’ll sell for profit and hop on the tsla rocket
[deleted]
Agreed. There’s no reason they should have popped off like they did today other than to crush my puts lol.
Should have sold my FSLY and DDOG calls today 🙄🙄🙄
Now you got the mark of shame
How do I get IV crushed on SLV calls smh
yes
That one dude yesterday posted a 16M loss so at least OP isn’t him
I havent opened any new positions and dont plan on. Just managing the ones I was in previously.
Market reactions and trends, as all stock goes through. Tesla has too much expectations that even a slight disappointment, ex Battery Day, can cause a steady drop.

Now imagine it was Friday and you saw it go up to $54...
It means i was down 3000 dollars but made back 2800 so i ended up short 200 instead of 3000.

Why da profanity do. I thought we was friends 😔
Tomorrow will be a stark reminder to NIO call holders “IV crush is real”. 
I am not here to poop your party but I have been burned several times hoping that the actual dollar rise will defeat the IV crush but it rarely happens.

What this guy said ^
Dude is off his rocker
You just lost most of your money on that call
I think it’s just going to gyrate 430-460s up into inclusion. Maybe a slight uptick a few days before but because it’s year end there’s gonna be a lot of profit taking in a lot of big winners like tsla too. So funds that need to buy have 30 days and there’s a lot of sellers going into end of year.

Fair, I appreciate the link. As per the article, I'm actually glad to hear they're stomping out fraudulent ballots. It even said that they received them in previous years as well, and were able to catch, and invalidate said votes. 7 of them, in the past 10 years. More than I would like, but definitely encouraging that they were all caught and un-counted.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately for Trump supporters, one dead voter vote  (that slipped past both Democratic and Republican election judges in the initial count) per 230,000 people (the number of people in the county where that one was found) doesn't make up for a 6 million vote lead for Biden. Doesn't quite help him close the gap.

&#x200B;

Personally, I hope they do a thorough job and find all cases of dead voters voting, and any other type of fraudulent activity that went on. I hope both Republican and Democratic voters are present in equal numbers to validate the recount, and that the truth comes out for everyone to see.

&#x200B;

I'm interested to see what kind of excuses Trump tries to spin to whine his way into a win then, once it's all said and done. Remember back when he told his voter base they should  "vote twice if they could!"? That's how you vote twice, mailing in a ballot that came to your house for a dead relative. I'd bet my literally never in the red Robinhood account on the fact that some of those dead voters were Republican votes, on dead relatives ballots, voting twice like their benevolent leader commanded.

&#x200B;

Pro tip #1:  Don't sell puts on a company that has been on a constant decline since pre-COVID.  There's usually a good reason for why it's trading down in the dumps.

Pro tip #2: Don't waste your time with stocks that have fallen below $10.  There's usually a good reason for why it's trading down in the dumps.

Pro tip #3: Don't sell puts in a company when there are recent shareholder alerts about class action lawsuits against them.

nope, chickened out of every single call after the Ulta news and cashed out my money after I fucked up buying puts at bottom the same day, thankfully they were out to December 18, so even though I panic sold I only lost 380 from the puts. In the end I bought some TGT shares at 163.45 today. May not be printing like many with calls tomorrow, but I hope to have some sort of victory. If I could’ve bought calls I would have.

1. You need more capital than that to sell covered calls on PLUG. That was enough back in the summer, not anymore.
2. Selling covered calls on PLUG is a little dangerous right now. Even though they announced a share offering, the stock has been extremely strong since the US election.
3. Don't sell covered calls on PLUG the week of the election and pending earnings report.
4. Definitely do not sell covered calls the week of the election and pending earnings report.

Yup. That's where the leverage of options comes in. Op was able to spend 4000 to reap similar gains as buying about 330,000 worth of shares (800 times a little over 400 whatever it was). But obviously took major risk to do so.

The stock market continues to rally, but the dissociation between the real economy is overwhelming. Feds have been looking to where inflation is, well it’s the stock market where all the money has gone into.

Selling puts means you will buy that amount of shares at that price so if It is below by then you will need to buy 100 shares at a expensive price

For every 1 share of Pfizer you owned you got .124 shares of viatris. Funnily enough mylan got 1-1 (it was a conversion of course) even with only 42% of the new company. I guess if you had options on Pfizer you’re gonna have fractional options too?
How’d you know? 😩 and what price per share are you looking for to sell at?
Don’t sell covered calls on them right now. The stock is mad volatile, jumping up because of insane WSB overexuberance.

Fren, no one in their right mind will throw 100K to a 17 y/o company who hasn’t reported earnings yet. Don’t beat yourself to it. If it breaks $20, load the hell up on leaps as further as you can go no matter how expensive they are.

I have a handful of shares and bought some more warrants today. I'm curious what you all think about the warrants currently going for around $2. I think they have a 5 year expiration date, so as long as this all goes through and get's above $13.50 a share, should be comparable to a super long option for free money? Any thoughts? What am I missing here?

Anyone else loading up warrants? And if you are what's your ratio between actual shares and warrants?
Oblivion or Valhalla, brother.
Lets go I'm broke and need it
IV crush doesn’t really apply to leaps(especially itm) depending on what expiry you have. You talkin about may it might be a little. You talkin about Jan 2023 it’s not gonna affect that shit at all

You answered well. Reliability in the sense that it will always sell no matter what
Best I can do is 0
A stop loss will guarantee a fill. Of course it will also lock in losses if it gaps down and rallies back up 

Lately I’ve been favoring stop limits. They don’t guarantee any fill but will tap you out for the run of the mill use case where the stock peters out and you want to get out cause it’s weak. For the gaps down, you monitor the position. You might lose a little more, but if you can’t swing that, the position size is too big anyway

Hmm, not a fan of that DXY open
any BA news?
Nice
I’ll give my boyfriend extra head tomorrow if that happens
Bro, just tell people it's EV so people smash that BUY button
Damn no amberlamps either? Whats next? You gonna tell me the election was a fraud?
Anyone who doesn’t think Mango baby won’t burn it all down because he didn’t get his way, doesn’t know him. He’s on a mission, setting the fuse tonight, tomorrow gasoline, next week he opens the gas valves,...packs some combustibles around the gas meter,...and one day drops a match. Prepare your buttholez.
BABA going parabolic tomorrow?

Then I would just be out of work again in 2 months
PLTR over $13 is robbery, hope your mind is changed.

No analysts rated it over $15. There’s a reason why

Knew it. Rode PLTR up and the market is going to cuck it. Market collapse this week cuz fucking rona. Fuckkkkkk
whats ur position
I legit wead this just as you typed it
Must be new to these parts of the town. NIO and PLTR  autist have been running naked on the streets for a month now.
GME wringing the soul out of their employees to squeeze extra dollars out of consumers. BULLISH. that extra money is more honey in the pot and a broken employee will use less benefits because of depression and a lack of will to live . and worst case scenario , their life insurance policy is exercised (kinda like an option except the strike date is a mystery) . im getting a ps5 with my tenderloins 🤠
NIO will open at $60 and PLTR at $20.

Fomoing Into tesla at 450 was top 5 worse trades I have made
That’s a long term etf. Shit isn’t gonna boom up like a Tesla or moderna
I mean if you are up that much couldn't you just excercise it?
Every stock that wasn't a meme would be flat AF until some users decide to meme it
Contact the companies investor department
The amount of optimism for pltr on wsb is making me very uncomfortable about my position
Dead. Imagine the average WSBer has any significant money.
Would you like a job in the Trump administration?
No
That sucks. I’m pretty sure I don’t pay any fees to trade common stock with Fidelity.

Hell yeah, Murica!
Can't believe people actually fall for this narrative.
We're at that elevator scene in the shining.

Perhaps a sense that the Chinese govt has their boot on BABA’s neck, deciding what to do with it/ Jack Ma.
Didn’t do much last earnings, but yes this time will be different.
Ok
The 2000 dot-com lesson was to watch financials and make sure whatever you're investing in can actually make money.

The 2009 lesson was to buy the fucking dip or you'll miss free money.

I swear the street forgot the 2000 lesson and supercharged it with the 2009 lesson. Who knows when it will pop but when it does, this bubble is gonna go supernova.

Appropriately, TSLA 500c, 550c 11/27🤡🤡🤡
Futures bruh
Everthing would crash?
0% actually
yea my expiry is friday
He must really like the Presidential Bunker. Who knew?
Yea I think both charts look great and have a ways to go, just been trying to be more disciplined about not buying high lately 

Course in a climate like this it’s hard to see some major dips anytime soon
Yo mama's joke lossed opportunity, retard
I just been waiting for new Uzi. Some songs are bangers but yea this is mid
Dude what?

All of his lawsuit have been dismissed in hilarious fashions.

The one in PA suing about "We didn't have observers in the room" (when it was literally livestreamed on national TV) - 

The judge asked the lawyer "I'm asking you as a member of the bar of this court" (aka, lie and your license is at stake) "were there representatives of the Trump Campaign in the room observing"

The lawyer responded "Yes."

The judge then scoffed "Then what is your problem?" Before dismissing the case.

The "legal defense fund" Trump raised for these sham lawsuits has T&C specifying that it could be used to cover campaign debts....

He's just getting one last grift off on suckers and then moving to Russia.
So sell before December 31, then buy the dip?
ICLN needs to hit some coke
Take the sugar high from kandi and start a riot. Next meme is here.
Yea I guess no one can drive themselves anymore it’s just all ambulances. I’m surprised you could ever type this I’d think you’d just hear sirens all day
My hands became more paper-like because I was able to sell whenever I wanted. Sometimes it was for the better, sometimes I missed out on major money
I came here for losses, not wins.

What do you think the markets would look like if for one day only WSB users were allowed to trade. No MMs, hedge funds, retail investors, etc.

Sorry I’m retarded
1 million more and maybe PYPL will got back to 210
im probably not going to jump on it, if i did, it would only be 1 call
Stock price didn’t react to it much. If the expiry is a week out+, I don’t see a reason to be upset about it. $20 per share is a big milestone IMO. If I have to guess, it’s gonna pull back 2-3 percent and pickup where it left Thursday.
Better chance of beating all you than the MM
Life gave you two great opportunities to buy the dip. Why do you deserve a third

I doubt I'm holding the short calls past ER, the long call I will tho. Bought it pretty cheap
Lol I thought that was pretty dumb too. Would basically start wwiii

Hey does anybody know what Nio’s cash position is? Just curious if they need to do another raise
This is pathetic
Do I need cash to write covered calls? Or are the shares enough?
They got in some hot water with the CEO making negative comments about the Chinese government, and they have faced anti-trust legislation from them as a result.
Ok

if nio hits 50 sell my calls and buy some amazon

Similar, except I do my dd as well and I've been making +50% a month on regular buys (not options).
Did you really just try comparing a penny stock to a large cap established company like tesla
Did you do better after you unlocked unlimited day trades?
Thoughts on BABA? I don't understand entirely why it is down so much over the past month with great earnings.
i bet he regrets alot of shit.

Ok makes sense. The way you worded it made it sound like after their first earnings report, which was last week. Thanks for the post.
What is hype in the deeper sense
Lmao wtf is this shit?
Pretty sure he might have tried last week

Oh no the calls I sold! Wait it’s barely up you little stinker
We would have to spend all our tendies on cocaine just to stay awake to trade
It's not an evil company, it is portrayed in that way by the hardcore leftists in the U.S because it works with the American Government and mostly because it helps the US customs and border agency to deport illegal immigrants. This image could  make some institutional investors that want to appeal to the masses reconsider investing in the company, but I believe that as long as PLTR continues to grow and make more money, the smart portfolio managers will definitely want the stock in their portfolio.

Need to go back in time and fix this
Oxy, It's only cheap because people think oil is going to crash again.  It's not going to crash again production is way down.  Oxy has gone up 50% in the last two weeks.  I think it's a 15 by end of the week.  Mid 20's by february.
The NIO opportunity is very alive. The fact that it held its own through an earnings release after a crazy run up speaks volumes. If it doesn’t get crushed during market hours tomorrow I’d say it’s very bullish moving forward.

So your historical data points are saying the stock goes up after earnings both times, but what you're saying is it's going to drill? and the data points showing it goes up support your case that it's going to drill? Are you an actual autist or do you just play one on TV?

Some of them are too high net worth for my accounting/tax knowledge. I pay college housemate/friend to handle it. With their earnings I pooled a bunch of various family member’s money to buy some houses and gave my old landlord $15,000 to finish a construction project so I wouldn’t know how the fug to calculate taxes on that

I just made a similar comeback from  $32k to $8,600 and now at $28k. NIO calls probably saved my life. So meme stocks would be your best bet

Well sure, two very different things. Anyone selling those puts have to buy those shares after closing Friday. Unless something causes shares to shoot past $20 by Friday.

Or they can buy them back at a loss
Just say you’re a bear and move on

All I want is a big red day (-5%) so that I can load the truck with some leaps and delete Robinhood for the next 6 months.
If WSB talks about it all the time... we ain’t in the smart money phase.

But if you’re a nobody how did you have an audience for them to use you for publicity?
No MM means that people placing market orders and sells would get shit prices and complain to brokers. Brokers would rather not deal with the flood of calls, so trading ends to save people from themselves.
There are legal stonks and illegal stonks. I won big if we only count the legal stonks. But they are trying to steal my tendies with the illegal stonks. Sad.

Hey, why don't I just go eat some hay, make things out of clay, lay by the bay? I just may! What'd ya say?
IV is gonna crush like you have never seen before and all puts and calls will be down minimum 30-40%
The lag on RH putting in orders makes me think they are doing even more shady ass shit.  Never use market orders on RH.  Go to Webull or something and look at the spreads before you bid.
How is it that the numbers came out already? Does the earnings come out the same time in China?
Got anymore of them stock splits?
Option sellers made a killing off NIO, price move is in the pennies.  IV was crazy high for this earnings
Is there a prenup involved if we marry Tswift?

Who's on this SDC ride with me? Need some upgrades tomorrow to push this fucker back up to 13-14.
If you click on the option and click on the bid-ask it should bring up the stats that show IV and the Greeks.
Palantir calls. I’m extremely bullish. $40 EOY
PLTR leaps on the dip tomorrow.
Commie girls stay with their commie friends. Hard to break into their commie wall 😢
Cool, I’ll do that!
it's almost as if the markets are trying to selloff without you noticing.

TSLA going to the s&p? Oh hey guys we gotta selloff to make room. so just buy the dip ya'll

Maybe poopy
Fuck I really want that guide
Not enough words.  
You must be wrong.
You just place calls or puts how much do you usually make
That’s a lot of words, TSLA weeklies it is!
Crazy to think 3 weeks ago we were about to test SPY 320, over stimulus talks. Now we’re at almost ATH over no stimulus talks
I know they have a translator there but it still all sounds like Chinese
Bilibili will blow ur mind
It’s options talk, basically a bet on a stock but a bit more complicated (not much). I will check it out perhaps.
Ask PLTR, they probably have a computer that knows exactly what they are thinking rn.
Hospitals in big cities are clearing out cold storage to hold vaccines for front line workers. Seriously wouldn’t be surprised if we see a push for this going out mid December.
Fuck dude i wish you the best.

I dunno. Look at expe and other travel bookers. They all sit around the valuation Airbnb is supposed to come out at- I think it will tank after open and slide sideways for a long time then slowly go up with the sector.
Although the 0.2% move says otherwise my confirmation bias says you’re right
Don't worry guys, I'll buy a put tomorrow, that will guarantee it won't go down, all my options tank.
Nobody stays on robinhood long enough to figure out how to use it bc it's garbage. The bigger problem that you'll notice once you open another account is that your "commission free" robinhood account is about 5% higher than options on a paid broker and take waaaaayv longer to close.

This is the only real advice on this sub.
Why poopy?
NIO gap up to 50 over night
If u swing trade it will count as income 

If u sell and hold for a year

Robinhood wanted some off the top before selling it for you.
Just got married in July, unfortunately my love came in with some significant (60k) student loans. My dream would be to first be able to hand her the cash to pay that off. It might take me awhile but hoping to play smart and grow to that.

You should join the PLTR discord.  Good real time discussion and moral support. It’s linked in a post in the palantir investors sub. I forget the url but you can search it. 

I don’t know what a 11/20 or 1/21 call means. I will have to research. 😬
That sounds like a very very poor idea
Doesn't show he sold them, probably held on all day and now he's back to 0.

I’m just going to warn you Best Buy fucked me in the ass on their last earnings(Had 5 $118 calls exp 2 weeks after their earnings, the stock was at $117 when I bought) I get up the next morning and hear in their conference they had an EPS beat of over 56% and revenue beat of ~1.2%.

Most EV charging is done at home.

Ev charging on the road is not very profitable because demand charges are extremely expensive, and most companies either subsidize it or they charge a huge amount that EV owners will rarely play for.

So PLTR is at the first arrow and NIO is the second arrow right?
I really doubt the Chinese govt would want that to happen, they would probably bring the hammer down on NIO in such a case. It is better if they are technically competing, even if NIO is luxury and XPENG is for middle class consumers.

You definitely could be right, but I think there needs to be a negative catalyst. Plus, the usual indicators like bollinger bands and RSI aren’t crazy overextended yet on the daily. 

I’m thinking this week might finish out positive around $365-$368 and then a down turn. I’ve taken small short positions though already.
Someone shill HIMX so I can feel confident about these calls I bought

As someone who has always made their payments on time - I agree. It's horseshit and I really hope these loan forgiveness plans fail. If someone signs some student loan docs they better be damn sure it's a solid investment, have a plan, and be ready to take full responsibility for whatever happens down the road. Anything short of that is irresponsible.

Luckily, I still have 20k in student loans outstanding and plan on making minimum payments in January, just in case.

Correlation
If you’re making a profit....

As long as you don’t owe more than $1000 in income taxes then you have nothing to worry about. However, if it is over $1000, then it’ll be in your best interest to pay estimated quarterly taxes by January 15 or if you file your taxes by some date in February.

How to calculate this? Pop it into an online calculator. Reason I’m not explaining the hand calculation is because it’s a pain to explain and give examples.

Nice. You are ahead of the curve. I’m just messing with options but I double up on a PLTR call  today and threw my profits into a 11/20 call so hoping that does something for me. Maybe should of held my 1/21 calls but oh well I hate the waiting game cause I’m impatient. After this week I’ll see where I stand and maybe try for one big move instead of these little ones i have spread everywhere.  Anyways good fortunes to you

This was a result of me getting married and her parents deciding not to help her with student loans and going into social work...so I think your rephrase should be "I wish I had a vagina so I can make just any amount of money while still having a clutch vs a man whose whole self worth may be a result of the money he makes"

No.  The Implied Volatility is for that specific company.  What I assume you’re thinking of are behemoth companies that can affect industries, like UPS proving the shipping industry is crushing it and FedEx rising as a result - in a nutshell of course.  Full disclosure: I voted to remove; no positions.

OK, sounds like you've done at least some research. Most retards here (myself included) are too lazy and would prefer to just put your effort towards our tendies. I've heard these guys are the dark side of the force. Therefore I held back a couple of weeks ago when my degenerate instincts told me to dive in. So in your opinion is PLTR good, evil or neither??

In theory, owning a stock legally entitles you to appoint a board of directors, who could then decide to send all the business' profits to shareholders as a dividend, or liquidate all assets and pay out that sum to shareholders. This is what gives stocks their value. However, the vast majority of investors aren't investing on the basis of the book value of a company or what profits they could harvest from it over some number of years by doing a hostile takeover. That's why some stocks have sustainably traded at 30x p/e for decades.

The actual value of the underlying asset is irrelevant to everyone except the largest stakeholders who might have the voting power necessary to access that value. If a company is doing well, you wouldn't want to liquidate it or raid it for profits anyway, so in effect, the entire value you derive from the stock of a company that is performing well is the expectation of the value of that stock being bid up by other investors. This is how you get insane p/e ratios in companies that are doing well and have huge growth potential such that a high level of future performance is almost predictable. As long as people think someone else will buy their stock, they will invest.

So basically, if a stock is expected to continue growing its revenues and eventually its profits, its value can go up indefinitely. These stocks have become untethered from their "actual" value, because their value equation for an investor no longer factors in profits or book value, just the possible increase in the price of the stock in the future. And if a stock rockets to a 900 p/e ratio, as long as it keeps posting good quarters and clearly showing enormous growth potential, this is sustainable.

This is also why stocks that perform poorly for a long time tend to see their p/e ratios deflate disproportionately rather than hold. They are becoming increasingly tethered to their "actual" value because the ability to buy and flip the stock for a profit isn't there for investors.

So yes, this is sustainable. As long as there is more money flowing into the overall market than there is leaving it (which there always will be, thanks JPOW), we can keep this up forever. 

# As long as the companies perform well.
Tesla 500🙏
Fuck yes
Shit.  What are we going to do?
Yeah man. I was down like 90% on my position for awhile. If I timed my buys better I could've had a 1000% return or more but oh well. I made out well in the end despite my poor timing. Rip my fallen PRTY comrade! You will be remembered.

Shouldn't have sold it all. I did the same but with half my shares, but im a round-eyed fuckin American so I hedged into some 11C's very early on.

Sold 500 shares around 14.5 for profits, will exercise those 11C's. Have about 25 other options with various strikes as well. 

I think this is easily 100 bucks in less than 2 years. 1000 shares is a nice number for me, and i will be selling my other calls around expiry.
Now I'm embarassed. I'll send u my wife now
If you're throwing in money, take care and avoid playing weeklies. It could trade sideways for a while before starting over (it's called IV crush for a reason).
It might not be avoidable but we can prolong it especially if you live in the middle of nowhere with some land

S-1 is out dude. They are printing money and were profitable pre covid
The disease is really, the hype behind it is fake
Bought several shares in CVGI in August for $2.65. Said "fuck it, you did well little train" when it hit $4. It's $7.31 now. My retarded ass did worse trading that money than if I had just left it. Same with FOSL, had several shares in at $5, sold at $7.50 because I thought I could fund a better investment. It's at $10.71 now. Should've stayed my ass in the room. Time in the market really is worth more than timing the market, but fuck if I don't keep failing that lesson.
Too cute to die
The hype is fake. The covid is terrible.
Yes
Wait until you realize working out decreases coochie gains. It literally makes you more autistic, that’s why it’s great

Fucking crazy how my flair fits me so good. I went balls deep on TSLA calls today. FUCKKK MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. I always get terrified of my wife looking at my RH account. 😢
My girlfriend is an artist, a good one at that with a ton of awards but hasn’t been able to focus on it because of work. COVID wrecked her career trajectory worse than BABA did to call last week.  I’d like to be able to support us both, and let her focus on her dream and what she’s good at. 

Additionally, if I could help my parents out and take them on trips or help pay off their houses, I’d do that. 

Used to do this to buy myself fun shit but recently realized there’s more to life and helping people out feels just as rewarding. Not to say I wouldn’t buy something nice with my money, but it isn’t the priority anymore.
I just do that with a good chunk of my money and gamble with a smaller amount.
Yes 🥭 the market needs some more uncertainty

It’s too complicated of an issue to simplify it to “you’re a good person if you don’t buy deep state stocks,” considering the stock market is one of middle class America’s major opportunities to build wealth and pay off categorically evil things like atrocious interest rates. Ethical concerns are more applicable once you’ve gathered enough wealth that you can choose to make a difference in other peoples’ lives IMO

Lol
NIO calls it is!
To find my father
Yo went to their webpage once.
Long calls (when you buy to open) are bullish. Short calls (when you sell to open) are bearish.

Long puts (buy to open) are bearish. Short puts (sell to open) are bullish.

If you think a stonk is going up (and obviously stonks only go up), then you want to buy to open a long call position or sell to open a short put position. After you've done that, you YOLO any gains you get on a Chinese EV maker. Doesn't matter which one, as long as it's Chinese and it's an electric car stonk. Then you bathe in the tendies.

idgaf who the fucking president is, if stonk go up im happy
Just sell covered calls
Nah man, they pretty fucked from COVID...they admit it themselves. Im gonna wait for the drill like PLTR did when it first came to market.
You don’t think going up 100%+ is a little excessive? Also, according to the federal government, our inflation rate is damn near zero. You don’t overpay people for doing an unskilled job. Flipping burgers, at McDonald, shouldn’t pay more than that skill is worth and it is nowhere worth $15 a hour.
Math is rational, investors aren't.
hope you're right man. the report and outlook look good and clear
Thank you.

there are people who actually do not understand how massive our economy is and how much it is based on debt and growth at all possibility. the gold standard cannot sustain this and would collapse our economy.

Yeah honestly I was hoping I could get in a bit lower, but it's going to be tough unless there's a downtrend in the market as a whole. Probably will buy some now
The gains were too good and expected a bigger dip after earnings. Also, I am using an european trading platofrom and PLTR options are still unavailable.

A lot of good stuff gets talked about but you need to spot it before it blows up. Plenty of people posting in new while 99% of the sub focused on NIO or PLTR. When you first look at it nothing cool is happening, which is kinda the point right? If you need every single step of dd spoonfed to you then you’re probably not going to spot the next 10 or 20 bagger on your own

Sell to close sells the contract at your ask price. You usually want to do that instead of exercising at the strike and holding shares
Ouch

Should I sell TSLA 460c 11/27 that I bought for 1,195 today like an idiot at open?
👏👏👏
Hey buddy. Chin up. The new administration looks like it'll keep the wars going. That should help :)

They are just resetting to floor values then go back up even higher
#STONKS ONLY GO UP
if i had internet at the time i would’ve sold sooner but by the time i checked it it had gone back down. happy with it either way
You should have about 60k now

Their full size pizza is like $8. That pizza has been feeding me dinner the past 3 nights. Honestly, worth it. Then again, I’m also testing out other pizzas besides Red Barron.
Yes because youre not Elon Musk.
Simple. Buy NIO calls, buy some leaps, FDs, or NIO shares so you DiVeRsifY your loses
I wouldn’t make them do masks. I’ll probably get tested right before and make the call that way. We already aren’t going there for Christmas, need to do our own thing with our dogs in a new place.
DD: $PLTR

The company is pronounced like “Palantir” which rhymes kind of with  “Palan Queer”. Pretty much... queer is like a term for gay I think ?? Anyways... that’s like “gay bear” the one thing people say on here. Anyways... gay bear is like when you buy puts. ALL IN PLTR PUTS!!
And a note to that- you’re break even at $13ish ?! That’s pretty good odds.

Hi noob question what does corsair gaming do that makes them so special?

Bad bot. That's uncalled for. He could be a she.
That’s cute that he feels bad for making literally millions of dollars
The article about Soros selling PLTR came out during market hours, if it was going to dump because of that it would have already happened. 

If you invested just because of Soros you shouldn’t have bought positions in the first place.

Because we make money
I mean randomly firing the cyber security lead because he doesn’t cooperate with your lies scares people that more firings are coming
No no you want to sell to open, it will cancel out your call and you get the sweet tendies.
I do the same exact thing lol. I buy it for like a week and sell
bought calls two weeks ago, but i sold it yesterday. I am expecting it to hit 21 and going back down to the 15-18 range

Well goddamn
SPY randomly went up like 2% in the last 5 minutes yesterday just so it could go up today but still be a "red day"
You can buy a Jan 2022 $10/$20 spread for about $3.30 (give or take). Buy a batch of those! That’s still a triple bagger if it hits $20 in 14 months.  You can even leave some of them uncovered (maybe half) for a more “yolo” feel.  That’s what I did.

> AKA, what stops the following situation: lets say I control Chase bank, what stops me from loaning 3 billion to myself, then deposit 3 billion in Chase bank, then loan 3 billion to myself again. keep going, until my account has a balance in the trillions, then I write a 2 trillion dollar check to purchase market cap of Apple. 

"Risk Management Guidelines".

You can't margin yourself to the point of instant collapse so if you had margin greater than your value then you have broken all the rules. You also wouldn't get far lending to yourself at zero because even if you were just "printing money" with no intention to pay yourself back you can only pass around the same dollar so many times before it degrades in value even at zero simply because of your own books drowning in debt (even if to yourself).
What kind of retard "truly believes in a company" but sells their entire position for a profit, especially without hedging some long dated call options? 

Get back in tomorrow after people sell off because theyre busy sucking George soros's cock. Don't sell again if you're going to be a pussy about it

He’s selling they’ve even disclosed that they are selling and what they’ve sold so far. He just can’t dump it all at once there is laws he has to obey.

Shit like TDOC was overbought, but it ain't goin anywhere. Doctors are absolutely loving this and a lot of patients are too. It's also going to be very strong even after COVID is gone, because it's a great way to cut costs and politicians will back this as a way to try to put the clamps on mooning healthcare costs.

Idk where the buy point should be, but if it happens to drill lower, I gotta figure it's a solid long hold
Don’t panic NIO gang stocks usually drop after ER but then they go up to new high points in the following days
Absolutely.  On open.
Shhhh NIO is our little secret
It's funny because everyone just assumes that all LV bags are fake so it was a waste of money. Shoulda just bought more calls dumb dumb

The suggestions here are good, but keep in mind that recruiters aren't working for either side - they're working for themselves.   So they'll push someone underqualified to land the contract, and you could end up in a bad situation.   If you are building your career and your network, do some research on the company and the roles and be cautious.   If you're just looking for a good salary for less than a year, get as much as you can.

What I’ve read people look at NIO as something that can rival TSLA . A lot of pressure on NIO rather than LI . NIO leads the EV charge in China, but could easily disappoint. And more importantly , Cheaper calls on LI lmao . What do you think ?

10 bagger if you bought 2 weeks ago
Definitely not consensus by most including the large analysts are this is just starter to grow. I’m seeing the big guys set price targets in the 60s. I think breaking 50 should be near future. Long term 3-5 years I see it breaking 100. Think about the potential. This gonnna be the luxury Amazon, these brands will never let themselves be sold on actual Amazon. China entry is just beginning and gonna be HUGE.
I think you have to look at PLTR as a long hold.  I get the feeling mid 20s by Jan, and way up over the next year or two.  They're agile, and established... just in facets that are tough to explain outside of a SCIF (*hint).
Lord, PDD is pounding me hard. I should have sold after second pop on earnings. Now it's getting the BABA treatment. FML.
you cool with losing 60k?
I was gonna buy puts EOD to take advantage of the next-day-selloff after a big gain day, but then I thought 'yeah, I don't wanna get fucked over again like I have other times', so I bought calls. Now after-hours is looking redder than a girl's first period.

That's what I'm saying. It inflates the value because it's "supposed" to move big in one direction, but it never does. And when it does move bigly, it's always unexpected. INTC for example, the IV was nothing going into earnings but then they went and tanked 10% anyway
acting as though the republican party will 100% oppose EVs instead of getting rich as fuck from investing in them then allowing regulation to pass

I inherited 300 shares of walgreens that my grandma bought in the 70s. I've owned them for 10 years. There are companies like this.
This is why the market will only go up. Gay bears getting fucked by retards all year.
Yesterday I decided to commit to PLTR with some long positions.  I needed to liquidate mutual fund positions to buy in, but was 100% committed.  I bought all I could in taxable yesterday (55 shares lol) and sold 1 CCP in Rothysauce.  Then had about $8k ready to run some combo of long calls and cash covered puts today once the mutual fund liquidation cleared.  Then it went ballistic at open (and before market open) and I'm sitting here with $8k cash wishing I would've pulled the trigger when it was up 5% at open.

Congrats to everyone who was already in and to my 55 shares and 1 CCP that is now way OTM lol.
They do auto loans
Why do you think Chinese stonks are audited? You dumb ass
Well that's the sensible thing to do honestly, they've just posted good earnings so that should mean growth in the stock price. If you have shares then just hold them safe in the knowledge that you have nothing to worry about. This is the kind of news that you want to see when deciding to buy or hold a stock.

Boeing calls might’ve been the easiest play of my life if this holds. Information was public on 737 return for past week , just wish I would’ve played run up more
Airline stocks will benefit. What people don't realize is that flights are expensive to pull off on all fronts so you can reduce staff, reduce fuel, reduce planes and inventory costs and then further reduce the need for these ridiculous loss-leading frequent-flyer programs as well.

You basically make a lot more money because you can shirk off these shackled contracts with large corporations that, over time, rot with the promise of upfront cash to help pay for operations but in the long-run just burn you. 

Good riddens.
Damn looks like that NIO short seller was on to something

Since I've been listening to ERs and watching charts during it, I don't understand this.    Like, half the time I see a red candle after like 8 words are spoken into the call.   I don't even think it's coincidence, because it's happened multiple times over the past few calls I've listened in on.

You are a fucking grade A retard if you thought they were gonna moon, literally a fucking monkey with autism could have told you not to hold calls for earnings. IV was 200%, they ran up like 1500% in a year, just the past 2 weeks they have increased their market cap to almost double of Ford.

Yeah because HUYA went SO well.
logically doesn't make a whole lot of sense anyway. Many employees probably would sell *some* of their shares to capture some profit, sure. But as employee's, you'd assume they have faith in the company (having faith in, yknow, themselves) and would expect the share price to continue to rise. So they would be stupid to sell while continuing to work there lol.

It's covids birthday today. First case was reported in China November 17th, 2019

do u have a large enough sample size to make this claim
Selling my 400 PLTR shares tomorrow therefore it’s going to moon 

You’re welcome
Let us ride or die, brother!
Mouth shut
I want to get where you are.  

So I trust you.
You are very smart playing er :)
Looks like RIDE. It's probably already done most of its mooning for the immediate time, which means its ripe for people to FOMO into at the top and wonder why their calls aren't printing

I don't know, the run up the past few days for Boeing is in line with Airbus, and Airbus doesn't have this news.

I wouldn't go near BA regardless, but there's some reason to think the recent run-up was independent of this.

Guys for fucks sake use a brokerage that has a working phone number. It’s _IMPORTANT_
Any thoughts on how high BA can go? Cause like.. i'm sensible.. so i converted both my RTX and BA positions to net credit spreads.. limited upside to 75 on RTX and 225 on BA but i feel like i could have made 250K on my positions instead of "only" 100K cause this shit's probably got retard strength and BA's gonna head to 250-300 before any meaningful pullback.. but on the upside the net credit from converting BA today gives me like 29K to do whatever with.. opinions?

I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think NIO and Li and XPEV are going up through Friday and actually are gonna moon a day or two after earnings. I f'n hate these stocks. THey're like drugs.
Maybe. EOW more likely.
they had an operating profit last quarter and 52% revenue growth...
It helps that i have a lot of PLTR, that shits singlehandedly propping up my portfolio rn

I just keep selling calls to cover losses anyway idgaf what it does in the short term. If it doesnt go up, passive money. If it goes up, cool i can buy more nio now

It is overbought at the moment + new shares are going to be available in third week of decemebr - there might be a case for bull run.
TSLA I can understand. They were first to market, have all the patents, have their own battery factory to reduce prices. They’ve done everything right. NIO doesn’t make a profit... and they have bunch of free patents to use from TSLA, and still can’t make money. It makes no sense
If you buy shares based on the amount of up or down votes they have then you’re in the right place

OK genius, sure, it could eventually reach 1 trillion for all we know.

But in one year and a few months from now?

This might come as a shock to you, but a share price is not actually arbitrary. It represents market capitalisation based on share quantity * price, which means how much a company is worth.

If PLTR reaches one trillion valuation in 1 year and 2 months, I will suck your dad off.
Move onto the next prospect. It's like when you buy a call and it immediately drills. You dust yourself off and start getting ready to dive into the next retarded play.
Holy fuck, that video came out at the end of February. Beargang was just getting started
It needs to be as far OTM as possible as well as on margin and you basically created new shareholder value which will increase the stock price as well as your balance and your margin.

You probably paid a high premium for your 51c which the IV was probably over 200%. Tomorrow the IV will drop down to 80% range making your contracts worth shit. The only way to recover and this is a maybe... is to average down on your cost basis to get close enough to the current contract price. And sell on any bounce to come out ahead or hold.

look for things you like and do (well) at them. the right one will come along if you do activities, work etc. Dont actively look for it too much.
Meh
Yea, not that I am a fan of our debt based monetary system, but the cure for our deflationary forces is not to peg the dollar to a hard currency while over 24 trillion dollars in debt. (Or 27, not sure where the current level is).

That is kind of a good way to blow up everything all over the world.

You will make it unpleasant for them already by forcing them to use masks while eating turkey so you might as well tell them no thanksgiving or Christmas since that’s what you’ll do anyways
+/- 20% expected move, thetagang is already celebrating: https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/jw363a/thank_you_nio/
Stop worrying about whether girls are into you. You should be trying to get into them 😉
Yikes
Well thats obviously normal behavior
Good talk kiddo. Keep up with the studies.
It was not indeed my friend...😩

Im still long tho
How do NIO's results affect RKT?
u make a bet that the stock will be a certain range or higher by the expiration date . the closer the expiration the cheaper it is and more volitile . if it is not within the range your position expires to zero. aka high risk, high reward , high chance of losing lots and lots if you arent careful
i think she said ..... NIO GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

So whose problem is it if you owe yourself trillions?
You can talk about wanting a bigger opportunity and that you're ready for it, see how it goes. No need to lie or fake it, that only gets you into trouble down the road.

Quit spamming this shit. You didn't call anything and all you do is post pseudo-DD's because you're stuck in your own shitty positions.

You just go around spamming your stock pick of the day in comments. If your DD was really that good then you wouldn't need to run around spamming it.

**The more a singular person screams about a stock the more suspicious and shitty it probably is.**

TL;DR : You just want people to bail you out of your crap positions.
Lit’rally said it right there in my comment
You must hate money if you playing with options and don't know what IV crush is.  it only takes one 10 minute youtube video to learn.

My view is that a Palantir rising is inevitable, always was after 9/11 and the way the US attitude to secrecy changed. 

You picked Tesla as your example but how about Nestle or all these "woke" investors piling into Altria for the weed exposure conveniently forgetting something like 90%+ of their dividend is coming from cancer sticks.
Just listen for the word Stonks, it’s the same in both languages.
Pray for nio stonk
how do you pronounce PLTR in your head?

"platter", "plitter", or "plutter"? What does PLTR even stand for?

lmao fuck
I know that Nokia has in it's vision that networks will become service's instead of products. Nokia got 11% of it's sales from software last quarter. When talking about software I THINK Qualcomm focuses more on products and Nokia on service's. Nokia focuses on networks and Qualcomm seems to target devices. Nokia will try to turn hardware normally sold into complete package's with software and maintenance. That could be a-lot more profitable then just selling equipment.

Cohen is too stupid to run a company like this. It would rapidly go to zero. He doesn't understand how important it is that GME stays B&M because that is how the swapshop works.

Super Tesla bull here. No it’s not. Historically hype gains on news and sell off while S&P buys big numbers of shares from institutions to benefit the big money players. The only runs Tesla is going on from now to eoy is on a short squeeze(which we woulda say today) or news coming out from Elon about something this week.

Also lizard-brain logic to help myself sleep: Since the Diamond Princess, the news has been all about the risk of flying during COVID. We aren't reading anything about cruising during COVID. For obvious reasons, but again, what is logic these days lol.

Nio was there begging for it's life, and I said, suck my big black Dingus and I won't kill you.
With all the talk about IV crush. Would it not be better to buy the day afterwards if you know it'll go up?
Is it too late or could you buy NIO on market open tmr?
This is the way!
This is bullish as fuck, Soros a pussy bitch.
"Non-GAAP" is the Mandarin to "to the moon!"
Putting all of the investment into their vehicles over mics, bullish

According to my calculations bulls r fuk
He bought? DAMP IT!
All these posts make me think that it's about time for nio to crash, us, retards, can't be making money is all im trying to say
doesnt matter what happens it will be be trading 2-3x its current value in a year or two
The stock is too cheap IMO. This feels like a 500b market cap company eventually to me. Maybe even a big T one day.
They take everyone’s data and help the company use it more efficiently for whatever specific purpose that company wants. And they do this miles better than any other company.
Soros found out he can’t receive voting rights no matter how many billions he invests.
That’s the spirit
Yes.
Fuck it I am going into QQQJ tomorrow. Would have beaten QQQ on every time frame upto 5 years. Also, have too much FANG exposure already, this one has none
Thinking that too but it’s Target, who doesn’t shop there. They do have that Ulta deal they just signed too. I was on the fence but went with a March 170 call spread. We’ll see, I’ll probably be saying effff
NIO doing the conference call on a burner phone so the feds don’t get them

Can confirm.
Lol i was making calls and puts during that time managed to make 100 into 700 byt lost it all on mrna calls it was fun tbh
This was already priced in today. Made no fucking move.
NIO earnings out. Sold 500 cars and beat the expectations of selling 200 cars. Bullish!
IWM calls, relationship with Nasdaq over
Those days are long gone man.   Quality posts went out the window as soon as the sub population exploded.

Anyone only semi-retarded should be fine is my point. The fear was that NIO was way overpriced. This earnings proves that NIO is priced about right. Moon mission continues it looks like.
Wow you must hate money.

Citron's argument is simple and compelling: tsla has the scale and pricing to crush nio in china. The only way nio can exist is through commie party intervention.
If it seems logical to get puts, get calls. But anyone would think of that, always inverse logic, right? Well that’s still too logical to inverse the inverse. Get calls pussy
This is some Illuminati shit. Definitely a buy signal for both.

Pretty lucky. Bought 11/20 EV calls at the top, and they were almost worthless until recently. Still down bigly overall
What is happening to BABA
NIO holders: Non-audited, non-GAAP? That's totally legit, right?


Yeah, man. Totally.
E6 the goat model
listening to this call . If this is how i lose it all , so be it lol .
S and p inclusion is gonna be amazing mark this post
It’s like free money but in reality. Everyone made cash until now at least.
Max flying again
ZM calls. PLTR calls. GME puts. SPY calls.
The ethics argument is very dumb. Yes Palentir might be evil. But why are people saying Tesla is a great company with great ethics? Do people realize how the resources for the batteries are obtained? Hypocrits lmfao
Suck my pp nio
This is bearish, but somehow entertaining DD.
Go to your contract and find the details on it, it will show you what theta is for your specific contract.  You can then calculate how much theta will cost you.  It depends on expiration date. If they're 2+weeks out you dont have to worry about theta.
If they unmuted the phones on the NIO call you’d hear about 3500 mouth breathing degenerates with Naruto episodes blasting in the background right now
I love this sub

Post earnings, as time goes on theta will eat away at them, but that won't matter if the shares keep going up. 

Might see a short spike and drop off after the next quarter earnings
I guess some of us just has all the tisms. 💁‍♂️
robocall
Eh
Yeh i bought a bunch of shares when it dipped at like 41.

Seems like pump to 50 is inevitable so i'd like to keep some shares and just keep selling calls for free money. Virus + crazy president might give us a friday market dip
K
I mean they’re not gonna hit 30 by January that’s for sure.
Tomorrow I think PLTR up above 7% again

This is kind of what I’m banking on: the traveling FOMO that’ll ensue once the pandemic is “officially over” (whatever the fuck that’ll mean according to the media outlets). But I believe other oppos like airlines might recover quicker than cruise lines and their expenses for maintaining cleanliness may not be as high therefore not weigh the revenues down as much.
I didn’t say I wanted it

You think PLTR is evil? Wait until you learn how they make Nutella and MCD chicken nuggets.
Saruman owns one of them and Sauron has another. They let them see each other and talk across Middle Earth like some kind of super inconvenient cell phone
Getting the sense Soro’s doesn’t liked to be followed.  We should troll him

Wait is this BA movement because of the 737 max ungrounding? Shits gonna crash again within the first 50 flights, January puts

I think so, but I can’t figure out if it will take 1 month or two years.
Your calls expire in January. Why are you worried about a percent change...
In the lord of the rings lore they aren’t actually evil. The palantiri were artifacts created by the elves that enabled communication over distance. The reason they’re seen as evil I guess is because at the end of the lord of the rings saruman had one and communicated to sauron through it. It’s actually just a not well secured long distance communication device. The not secured part is where everyone thinks it’s evil.
Those are rookie numbers, you gotta diversify even less.
Fucking based!

$TSLA now in $SPY? Will it stabilize in price from now on? Or will it cause the next $SPY drag down? Who the fuck knows?
You’re probably right he said he enjoys it perhaps im in the wrong here and should be more encouraging
what’s so special about this stock even after it’s already doubled ?
that's a helluva margin call
is my tsla 11/20 420p fuk or is it fuk
The China boys don’t have auditing regulations like USA. Numbers will most likely be cooked and thus very good lol
Bro that's around 100% increase from current price 👍🏼
Evil is the whole reason I invested in them. No one is more openly evil than Palantir, I love that aspect of the company.
I’ve now spent like 5 minutes of my life staring at this picture because I don’t see a ticker anywhere 😂
Can’t they take your shares now?
Yet it doesn’t seem like you do
My strategy was always going after what I called “the red headed step child’s” stocks that no one wanted or companies that were severely punished. Reason being, I’m an optimist in nature and I figured same time next year things would look differently. Also most of the companies in the retail sector still had their infrastructure, inventory, human capital and customer base. Nordstrom caters to the upscale professional millennial women/men so their customer were largely unscathed by this pandemic. That and of course the fed propping up the market and injecting 3T in fiscal and monetary policy. So my thesis was, where did all money go? In time we learned that it went to car sales, retail, home improvement and consumer electronics. There was only one sector in that list that wasn’t heavily inflated already in their valuations(thanks to that Cramer bitch and his ‘stay at home play’) anyway. I asked around some millennial friends of mine about Nordstrom and they said that Nordstrom Rack had a cult following and they were already excited to for their stores to open back up. Long story short, I went all in on the best retail brand I could think of.
Meanwhile I’m trading on DD and logic and analysis but can’t make a dime. FUCK YOU MATE
I’m calling it now. We are ten years away from our first Jetpack involved robbery. I’m looking at *you* LAX Jetpack guy.

XPEV’s IPO was at $23.10, NIO’s IPO was at $6.  That sort of makes a difference.  

Both XPEV and LI outperformed NIO over the last 30 days.  Most of NIO’s growth this year was from before XPEV even went public.

This is the first stock on this site besides pltr I will look into
If I make money from PLTR it's literally thanks to WSB. Cuz I don't know who owns the company or what they do

On one hand I think you should sell, on the other you’re on this sub so you’re retarded and it’d be funny if you lost all your money.

Covered calls and cash covered puts.  Weekly.   If you pick the correct stock is a nice smooth ride up.   If the market crash on Sept 8 or June 10.  Just keep going.   I rarely actually buy a call or put.   Yes I am 51 years and working with more money than most.   But I cannot afford to yolo.

In addition, certain record holders of Palantir’s common stock and stock options that are subject to market standoff agreements with Palantir have not signed Palantir’s lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period, which is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir’s financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period"). If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, as of September 24, 2020, up to an additional 27.9 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period, subject to certain exceptions.

Why do Chinese companies love classical music for their earnings calls??
Ba to 230 tomorrow.
*laughs in IV crush*
But that IV crush dudebro
Jealous and poor
I pussed out on buying PLTR calls two weeks ago so I’m staying out of it. 
I don’t deserve those gains.
this is the realest post on this sub
!RemindMe in one week
I uttered “Voldemort”

The name which can’t be spoken
What’s up with BA? :)
Someone on here needs to get on a game show and say that they’re going to yolo all their winnings into FD’s
[deleted]
You’re tying it up in the underlying regardless
Thx! Happy cake day
Crush is actually nutty ngl
Not OP but it tanked because they had to reschedule the launch because of New Mexico state Covid restrictions. Could moon when new date announced in the future.
*Chef_Boyardee1!* for sure.
Buy on robinhood, sell on investing EZ MONEY
You’re riding it to the moon but you’re posting an article that is trying to make a bearish statement? Weird strategy bro
Describe it
Lol you have no idea what’s in my account or my gainz yet you’re raging. This is cute.
hell no yolo that shit and get rich
Acquire Calls for (L)NIO
He’s only selling because we talk shit about him and buy the same stock.
AAPL holders unite
It's like KMart
Same for any meme stock. SPCE was like this and still made bank and then bailed
the fact he used to write for Jacobin before running the evil corporation will never not be funny
[https://imgur.com/gallery/zl6ly](https://imgur.com/gallery/zl6ly)
So what you're saying is Tesla's pricing is going to eat Nio's lunch, like DB said before China forced them to re-write their report when Citron used it to tank the stock.
Because it’s made up

Is buying OTM leaps (2023) for cruise lines (CCL, NCLH, etc) moronic or too obvious of a play? I was thinking about sinking a few grand into late 2022 and 2023 OTM calls for strikes that are close to pre-covid. Thoughts? I’m genuinely trying to understand the bull and bear cases here.
And mara
Someone bought a winning lotto ticket for $26 million a half of a mile from my house. Hopefully PLTR is my winning lotto ticket 🔮🔮
Yikes
fuck yeah, SPY 400 EOY guaranteed. we know how good those retards are at predicting stuff.
who cares, let him do what he do. maybe he's interested in plumbing and not interested in mortgages? i work a job im not interested in that i took for the money and i hate every second of it
NKLA 30C
Dude you work at a mortgage company. Your opinion doesn’t mean shit about anything in life (including mortgages) and your little brother already knows this.

Plumbers are the shit and that’s wassup
He said he’s learning to shadow someone “getting his foot in the door” I got nothing wrong with plumbing but I feel like they’re taking advantage of him
Imagine retiring and spending your days in this thread.
but what if you put 100k into NIO and it prompty lost 60% of its value
Next time you can refresh and usually it has changed so you can give the dude his upvote.
[deleted]
Agreed, selling for political reasons. Weak.
Maybe NIO can just list all the Tesla tech it has stolen. Bullish.
HOLD THE LINE
This is the way. I sold that call this morning for .63. I’m up 40%.
Well I'm just saying this because I'm trying to make OP feel better relating illiteracy.
there's gotta be 1 retard in this thread who somehow speaks mandarin chinese and can translate the call for us
By oh boy
\+100
The IV crush will happen regardless of what share price is, what you are hoping is that share price outpaces it (it probably won't lol)
Bought PLTR after cashing out my 60% gains from SOLO I got i ln the past 2 weeks. PLTR is a solid hold for as long as you care to hold. Bought 100 shares at $15.52. Had a friend telling me about it when it was below $10, shoulda bought then...
dw i’ll buy your nio calls at half off at open
Nah
BA at 145 was a steal. Still didn't buy it
u ok?
SPCE
9 minutes?
Puts on NIO choice of music
So you pretty much bought the TOP after 1 month of us talking about it. Good job retard.
Is it too laye to get in?
Should have sold high, you retard
Is this some kinda weird poetry
Mango lost
the slow bleed off of PLTR is irksome. can't be too mad though. hell of a day for them.
Read article again. He already sold, he's now bitter.
Stock buyback plz

ALEX KARP HAS A PHD IN PHILOSOPHY BTW

im pretty sure the guy knows more about ethics then us degens
This was already priced in, we’ve know they were going to beat expectations for a while. The concern I have with NIO is how easily this stock will drop on bad news.
Who do you think films it?
why does my investing.com app say pltr is at 17.85 and rh says its at 17.58???
I bought some 11/27 $20p  so it’s definitely going to the moon.
Plumbers make more than 10.50 an hour tho.. charge 150 to show up and just look at your massive turd that is jammed up.  50k tho what you need I already wfh and like money
Oh god 😶
I’m ready to be done with NIO. This shit is ridiculous.
Is that why it can't get any traction?  Fucking cunt.
My  NIO 45/55C exp 02/21 looks safe. Any thoughts?
Google and Facebook are good
Softbank Ceo is expecting market crash, dumped $80b in assets to prepare. Somehow, bullish.
When I finally make money, then I gotta pay taxes
NIO bout to greener than marijuana
she probably tried to take his tendies
Wat if u put 100k in 1 stock and it goes up like nio or tsla this year? I would retire and live here on wsb
Is that the same company that faked the commercial with the Truck?
Sales doubled. That’s not bad.
Too big to fail , how many times are you going tk learn lol

Mango lost
Hence the "you don't know when to cash in". Nio went UP UP UP UP UP UP for so long, plenty of time to hop on the bandwagon then leave when you got some $. Just because it EVENTUALLY dropped at bit doesn't mean shit. It was hyped up, and it went up.  And if you consider what i posted an "attack" you probably don't have the heart to be doing trading.

Nice
Call us when you buy NIO
Im so happy for you
Encourage me. I’m weak to jump on it
Do you want that in a percentage form?

0%
close your eyes. point your finger to a stock. it will probably go up in this market.
Evidence that they are continuing to increase sales, production and margins. Consecutive reduction to operating costs indicates that they’re improving their efficiency each quarter. 

They are in a healthy spot.  The market believes that they are a $50b company. They’re sitting on   $2.8b of cash. That’s enough to keep them afloat for 5 years; longer if they continue to increase sales, margins and reduce operating expenses. 

They’re spending $0.5b in selling expenses. This is where it would be nice to have an auditor check things out. Is this advertising or cash kickbacks to the buyers? (i.e you buy the car for $42k and the government will give you $7k back for buying an electric vehicle. Here’s another voucher worth $20k. Buyer signs NDA to not talk about it or risk being thrown in jail. You never hear such a thing ever mentioned.).  Auditors uncover this stuff by sifting through their financial data - something that the PRC prohibits.  But why should anyone worry?  I’m sure they’re completely honest.  People with money and power are rarely corrupt - especially in a communist country.  It’s also ironic that the CEOs of both NIO and LI have their own “autotrader” like companies. Autohome and Bitauto.  I’m sure the auditor will be able to confirm the reported sales numbers if they were to examine the sales being reported by these independent car sales websites that they also own. It’s not like they would be colluding to lie to an auditor. That stuff never happens in real life. 

If I owned my own car company and an autotrader-like company - you better believe that you would be able to buy my cars on it. Strangely enough - you can’t actually buy their cars on their ”independent” sales platform, nor are they even advertised on their platforms.

What about the Yelp reviews?  Surely there’s positive things to be said from the 12k new EV owners!  Oh, wait - a recent law was passed in China that prohibits people from making negative statements public. Only positivity is allowed in China (cue the COVID joke). There’s lots of positive comments, right?  Right guys?  It’s just in a different language so it’s hard for us to find. Yeah - that’s probably it.  I don’t need to look it up. This all just seems so legit. 100 $50 call Nov’20.
Who's traveling for Thanksgiving?
I’d like to say I’ve learned something and that’s why I’ve had a great last few weeks with options, but like any true degenerate I know I’m just on a heater and I’ll cool off soon
I can confirm this I took micro
Did anyone see RIOT today up 50%
Bought 600 shares at 10.2, sold at 16.7.Feel bad about not holding.
This might be the best comment I've read on reddit lmao
Bro first off who cares what this loser thinks. Second, he invested back in 2012 pre-IPO. He’s selling for liquidity and because he’s up probably 10,000%. Read the article for me one time

And you'll be there to tell them all about it.
The support is looking pretty good after hours, I believe this is still a great growth stock for the next 2-3 years, just like TSLA is.
The way to correct them would be using your votes to influence company decisions, not avoid them and leave that power to someone else.

Insane the price on weeklies right now. Same strike feb call is less than 3x the price

I have itm calls
Oh no.....
Sir, this is wsb. It is tournament poker.
So how's TSLA, NIO and PLTR gang doing? I've been working all day.
Should've made the last sentence the tldr!
Yeah FIT and WORK? What are these guys even doing
My favorite

That’s how it works
I bought back in at the bottom of the Start of a V shape recovery. Currently 24% gains with my shares ( too much of a pussy to do options)
Straight up dude
Who cares, already sold so his loss. Plus he done it for political reasons. Sounds like a moron to me.
The time to do that was today. Iv was over 200%
Fuck it pirates man. I remember watchinft it in a dorm full of people. If you want to make porn mainstream...this is the way. I am the greatest pirate gunter in the world, agggghhhh.

Or wait till Feb, I don't know the specific date, but that's when original share holders can sell shares which may mean dilution and lower prices, but I don't see it lower than 17 by then. I see more contracts with government agencies both domestic and foreign. Just my thoughts 300 shares and 10 20c 3/21 10 17c 12/20 just rolled my 15c over to the other two.

Oh noes! Palantir is evil.

I think puts are fine lmao.
Pretty confident we’ll drop back to test 352 this week
That’s the only way to be
No but thought this was the start of a leg down
What's your end goal? Do you have a dollar amount where you will exit and retire in style?
I really believe NIO will be 50+ at open and all iv crush on my calls will be gone
Exactly. Which is why I’m not even gonna entertain the guy above you.
MNPR
Cuck
That’s awesome, may I ask how long this took you and what stocks helped you achieve 1mil?
I bought some ASAN, saw some activity on it and decided to dip my toe in. I don't really love the company but stock was getting beat up and seems to be getting interest in the past few days

before you buy nio look at absolute retards in the $NIO hashtag feed on twitter. these are the people you'll be holding with.

Its been better since I blocked a few of the shittier posters last summer. All caps people, the guys that seem to live on here trying to be "wsb personalities", and anyone else that are essentially spammy/annoying. Just a few clicks for a week or two, and it's been a much better experience.

I live in a large city and the malls in-and-around the city and suburbs have been losing tenants for years even before covid. Sure, there are a couple of psuedo-pedestrian-outdoor-mall-like spaces but they're small in comparison to those big hulking monoliths of the 80s/90s, and never seen an express in them. This is all circumstantial, so maybe they exist already? unless you have inside info on a strategy shift
Mods, ban this one.
What’s Sears

Man people were buying like crazy. I sold at 17.69 then at 18 and it kept going up. I felt dumb selling as it crushed 18$.
Honestly all the analyst say NIO is due for a reset. Sure itll go up to 100+ but a good pullback isnt a bad thing. Its good for investors late to the game
Us broke fucks here have no moral compass. Imagine if you had real money, it’s depressing but true

Double Dicking
NIO is going to be like Luckin Fuckin Coffee
Hilarious.  So many people bought precisely because Soros was in it.  Now they discover he is mostly out and will be completely divested shortly.  lmao.
More like they don’t trust people who aren’t Mexican. One family member hates me because my dad is black and thinks I’ll just spend their money on crack. He’s a meth addict 🤷‍♂️
bought RIOT shares AH, already made 8%.  selling covered calls when they start writing them at higher than $8.  IV is over 300%

I will win the last word
Damn right. I lost 80% with X5 and I am going to keep using it until I lose the remaining 220%
I bought 10 :(

Kinda crazy a dude who used to ride around in a Honda selling books is going to own a stake in every sector. When the reporter laughed at him for saying he could become bigger than Sears Bezos took it to heart. Lmao
This chart means jack shit. Every time it's brought up it only loosely fits the situation it's being applied to. Nio pumped because hedges bought in because it had good sales and they're pricing in EV cars being normalised in China in the next five to ten years. China needs to cut it's fossil burning because it's devastating their populations health. It's not as simple as the west where the cost of discovering/harvesting fossil fuels has exceeded the cost of renewables like bio-diesel/gas, wind and hydro and that's pushing big energy  (hard) to move on. It's as much about a health crisis that's going to cripple the country in the near future. It's also another example of China aping America as it desperately tries to find its feet before it becomes redundant and another cheaper labour option presents itself. 

Nio might be bullshit (a lot of Chinese companies are, the whole country is built on lying about financials), and it might collapse but this bloody graph does nothing to explain how why or when that would happen.

I agree with a lot of the people here yesterday who think Cohen's sabre-rattling is the first act of him forcing the squeeze.  I'll be happy with $50, $100 would be thrilling, and anything over that is beyond my imagination.  I just want these calls to print.
They might as well conduct the call in wsb
Everyone who didn’t panic sell NIO deserves an award

It only took a few times for me to try stuff like this and get IV crushed to death before I said "never again".  Unless you are extremely confident, go spreads to avoid the IV crush.

2. Laptops

They won’t take over those categories
I am, the loss porn is going to be insane
Too much or not enough, I guess we’ll find out tomorrow
hopefully PUTS
They’ll roll it over into MP
I'm sorry man, that's rough.
You’re in the wrong sub if you’re looking for sympathy lol.. try r/daytrading they might console you
Second opening bell is my favorite time of the day
who's this cuck trying to unload 40k shares of NIO at 46.60.
If I see another person mention IV I'm gonna lose my goddammit mind.

NIO pricing in this 7 PM call
Bois not bad a 4K gain
BA, JMIA, had F a bit from Friday
You sound like the kind of person that loses....at everything. NIO isn't even bad. What are you talking about? lol
IV is a pointless metric. It inflates options to unaffordable prices and then the stock moves 2%
Yeah, I mean no denying it's a risky trade. But you don't make ten baggers by being risk averse.

I'm just tired of bears drawing surface level comparisons to LK cause Chinese or NKLA cause EV when neither are really apt.
It’s so dumb that people keep posting this for every IPO. If you believe companies always go down on their lockup end day then why isn’t your whole portfolio just shorting companies the day their lockup ends? 

This has the same chance of working as any other indicator
We got some wizTards in here!

Yesterday some guy said Tesla so boring and another guy said that’s good how they get into S&P
What’s your thinking?
AAL leaps
This is a put

I bought the 25c basically at the top today but entered the other 3 mid October.
I didn’t hear no bell

Ah, just looked closer.

What are DDs? Donkey Dicks?
Lmao NIO flat af. Both bears and bulls are fucked
That's true
I only yolo once a month. I soend the. Month gaining on small trades and at the end i yolo it on a big bet usually it pays off but this months yolo almost messed me up. But i broke even thank god minus 200 bucks 😤😤😤
Exactly.
FUCKING CONGRATS

What soros news? The soros news from last week?
Wondering at what price point would bulls come to terms with the fact, that price has run up too quickly? It is like a 1T market cap for you guys, or something like this, isnt it? 

^(Because it is MORE THAN A CAR COMPANY, IT IS ENERGY, IT IS SOFTWARE, IT IS CHINESE GOVERNMENT, IT IS EXPANDING, IT HAS BEST BATTERIES, IT HAS CURE FOR COVID etc.)
Frankly I feel better now knowing globalist Soros is no longer a share holder in palantir. *Alex Jones Voice*

PLUG did a secondary offering recently, price is on it's way down but when momentum reverses I'll be long a couple hundred shares.  

DKNG gang rich now. GME still poised for either death or a massive short squeeze.

Pltr is fine

Oof.. that seems a little rash. 

Then again, what the hell do I know.
My 2/19 30c knows he's right.

wtf. ARK just keeps on selling BABA, even after they bought the "dip" a couple weeks ago at 295.
calm down man. they're both +/- 1%ish AH
Thank god I didnt yolo this.
How much did u lose?
As if DDs provided by retards in the past were from Charlie Munger himself.
Yes but no

Just tedious asset value inflation leading to standard bubble pop as it is revealed that QE was overextended
A Padawan autist is among us. He'll lose 30k...then buy 60k worth of puts and lose it all...if this happens...

He is the chosen one
Yes, which is why this sub doesn't get any
The 😑
That's been mooning for the last month though.
One store is not the entire company.
RKT and DKNG
No I honest to God legit think this subs ignorance is retarded sometimes. NIO is a legit company with a good CEO who's experienced in running a company They're going to bank hard in the next couple of years and people are on here saying it's a scam. Also I don't do Contracts. Spreads are 10x better. I don’t get emotional about this kind of shit because I know ill always come out ahead. 


You view this as a casino. You view money as a number. I look at it like a asset. My money makes me money. my money has value I can take out giant loans based on my money. No questions asked. My money has Value. But most importantly. I control my money. 


Your money is based on luck. Your money buys a whip and a hooker but thats it. Your money doesn't take care of you. your money is determined by luck and Hype. It's sad you have to be legit retarded not to realize that stocks make you more money than options ever will.
u can make my penis tingly with your Tongue￼
Now run away and don’t look back. No seriously. You hit the lotto it ain’t gonna happen again
I am buying PTON options !

Still broke tho

high IV is what makes it fun.
Heh heh... You never know.
3 years ago I actually met up with a smokin' hottie after we found we had similar unexplored kinks, here on reddit. Wonderful kink fest. 20ish and gorgeous. Great memories.
look at my post history . 800% on tesla today . 30k in gainsss yeaaaaah
"Only 8% in one day for a megacap"

Will be up like 15-20% from here within a month easily.

Same here. I was betting on a Crew-1 to ISS spike but the S&P announcement took the cake to $460.
You’ll learn pretty quickly about IV crush
thats why its the perfect boomer stonk to moon to boomer values

Thanks!
I'm waiting to FOMO up on FDs after the first pop!
Stop trying to make NIO fail. NIO isn't going to fail. 

TSLA, on the other hand, is losing all on its own. 

[Electric Car Sales More Than Double In World's Biggest EV Market, but Tesla lags](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-cars-china-sales-double-october-2020-tesla-trails/), 11/11/2020

> Electric cars again outpaced traditional vehicles as China auto sales continued their pandemic rebound in October. But Tesla (TSLA) trailed both Chinese car giant BYD (BYDFF) and a General Motors (GM) joint venture in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles.

TSLA is being outsold even by other regular American car companies in China. TSLA sold 12K EVs in China in October. NIO sold 5K EVs in China in October and is ramping up production more quickly than TSLA. NIO is a few months away from being one of the companies that's outselling TSLA in China

With other auto majors from Europe & the US rushing into China with EVs right now, TSLA will be lucky to be in the top 5 with EV sales in China in 2021.
Lol nios down today after massive post yesterday. And I don’t buy into the hype so no it’s not me failing, but over pumped stocks that aren’t in my possession regardless but appreciate the attacking insult:). You must be strong irl.
Does the V in V shaped recovery stand for Vagina?
You doing ok? Been there too man. That battery day tweet nuked half of my account. Luckily I’ve recovered and am onto less degen plays. May the tendies print in your favor moving forward. ❤️
Nice to see all the indexes seeing some inflow AH and not just rotation.
I bought CODX on the dip and just hoping its gradually heads towards $15 with the huge daily case numbers

Once you don't have to care about money, it's all the same.
They’re giving me added value on my options.
I fucking bought 10 dollars of palantir last week so I wouldn’t forget ab it when my check hit. Well, I forgot ab it. That 10 is now 19 and the whole plan was to buy calls

A really simple explanation of IV Crush should be pinned to the front page so hopefully noobs read it before FOMOing into plays. This concept needs to be fully understood before buying options.

Good move
According to soros I guess not
Earnings yes but the call isn't till 7 when they will give guidance and as we all know earnings is meaningless; it's all about guidance

Don't forget to diversify with PLTR in case TSLA forsakens us and doesn't rally by weekly expiration
Plz no 167.5 by Friday. That would fuck me up so hard lmao

Any day Tesla doesn’t double is a disappointing day
Please do it!! I was thinking the same, but if you buy puts I think my calls will be good! Do it for pltr gang!🙏
Right under a million, should go over if things go as well as they’ve been going,
Lmao
It's like I thought I knew how this week would go.
Palantir evil hurrrrdurrrr. Soros’ comment and sell off does nothing to the value of the company. Don’t be swayed.

He made money on calls now playing puts fuck him
You were here for it.  Remember when...
Don't buy options, sell them
This only applies if they sell those calls/warrants though, right? Otherwise it would mean they are extra bullish. Unless they expect a near term increase (during which they would sell the calls) and then a dump down to $4.50, they wouldn't buy those calls if they were bearish.
There’s only 26 manual murcys in North America, so they will all be very valuable
Tesla was such a disappointment today. only 8% after an SP announcement
Diamond fucking hands. I don't even look to see how much I lost since I got aboard this train. If stonks aren't up, I just pass by it and don't look at details. I can wait.
That's what I'm saying.
New 🌝- NIO, I have sent the email to Oxford for an update in the dictionary
Same im just glad i didn't buy puts i figured it wouldn't be worth it
What are the fucking chances Nio and PLTR both get fucked AH by ER and an article in the same day that wsb is talking non stop about both companies.....holy fuck lol
Always was
Hey man, I am all on the NIO bandwagon... I am just saying anything is possible.

Haha  thankful one of my sisters is my best friend and she’s the most frugal person I’ve ever met, she’s always been great with money and the rest of our family is so bad with money it’s disgusting. Context, one of my sisters bought a 85k dollar truck on a 60k a year salary. Don’t ask me how she got that loan accepted. So this sister knows to keep it hush. Last thing I need is them using my nieces and nephews as weapons for me to pay their rent
I'd buy the hell out of that dip please happen
Nobody tell him.
you mean thighland?
By not having a loser lead this country.
Jesus I was down $5k from my first stupid ass trade Monday morning and now down net $800 for the week. I'll take that but my heart cannot
I hope you sold before 3

Where did you get this? I’ve seen this ranging from December - March on when they can start dumping
Buying the top I see
*cut to the end of NGNL where the coin lands on its side*
Because the 2 companies they compete with, who’s revenue is worse, are both running at $100+
Oh no
I mean sure, but say it runs up to $20 by december and it drops to $15 are you really better off than buying it at IPO?

Calls expire before then :)
Ah I see
Markets don't like uncertainty. Trump brought a lot of that. Pro business or not. Republican Senate keeps Biden and Harris in check, tax cuts stay not much gets passed. BTW he hasn't technically won yet but is very likely to.

Is the subreddit usually not this hype?
“Confirmed” and “hear me out” next to each other do not make for a good DD
Didn’t earnings already drop?
Had a zoom call with my team today
So GOOG puts?
So how many people do you think will come in here tomorrow asking why their NIO calls lost money even though the stock price went up since they bought the calls?
Exact same thing here. +300 gains to +60 in like 15 minutes. Hope tomorrow won’t be too bad
[deleted]
Maybe puts? Idk
The federal government owns most of the debt. It’ll just increase the deficit.
I pay my taxes, I hope that money goes to putting shirts back on the people who lost them.
“I did not regret this 2 weeks ago when it was $10, but now I do.” 😂

*"They're like a Roomba for your mouth"*
PLTR 25c weekly
cuz republicans still have the senate, which means nothing will get done in DC, so business will resume as usual, profits go up
Maybe 0.1% of the populace
Bet
It was at that ATH for like...all of 2 hours after a 2000% year? 

I would've expected a pre-earnings sell off down to near 40, the fact that it held 45 and is actually even higher than that is hella bullish IMO
Start by selling cash covered puts, then covered calls once you get assigned
I bought my first put since April today. I deserve to get double fisted in the cram hole for my unamerican malfeasance.

NIO might turn green in AH
positions or ban
It’s not going anywhere. Ignore day to day swings.  See where it is in a month.  🚀
You sir, are retarded.
its almost green from initial -8% dip after market. it might moon tom.
I don't think there is a lockup period for PLTR. It was a direct listing, not an IPO.
Cause he's selling. Read between the lines or do your own research into it.
Ah don't look so good for u
you're doing good then man.
Congrats to the dude who suggested iron condor on NIO earlier. I was going to comment that it's an asinine move since a violent price movement AH would put you in deep shit. But looks like that's THE play to harvest tendies from NIO post ER
Anyone else got some ZM calls?
If you ever doubted PLTR look at AYX and SNOW, and PLTR is regarded higher than these two in the tech industry.
Lol you good
Except...
CoMpoUnD InTEreSt
If they don't respond, threaten to complain on the media and/or open a SIPC complaint. It's best than watching your money disappear for something they should be responsible for.
Man that would be nice
Soros is a greedy fuck. He just wants to buy more
Woah li and nio hit different at night in the night we grow in the day we blow
Bitchcoin is mooning
Soros cant sell the rest of his shares until lockup ends in february. what are we freaking out about?
Can you bet on the over/under or spread for YOY returns / margins / eps ?

Nikola still worth like 7 billion with nothing to show for. Fisker is only worth 1.2 billion I believe.
Why would pltr go up if their revenue sucks bhole
Looool
Stick your dick it RIOT tomorrow. Can't go tits up!

I've been using the same strategy lately as well with shares. First time being green in two years lol.

On Friday I held 35k in amzn options. Was hyperventilating since they were 12/18 expiry. Made $5k last week. 

Yesterday I picked up some WBA calls. Today, AMZN fucks me hard. If I held AMZN would’ve absolutely banked at open. Instead I’m down a few k

Palantir Soros regret article [here](https://www.benzinga.com/node/18418066)
What’s the play for BCRX and why?
You will get a taste of it in February. =)
Not necessarily. It’s also a whole lot cheaper for companies to do it this way. It isn’t 2014 anymore where this has a bad stigma. Larger and larger companies are doing it because it’s cheaper for them and recently many shown that it works. Now Stripe may not want to do it and I don’t think Ackman has a chance at them anyway, but not because it’s not an IPO
Tomorrow is make or break for boeing. If the max 737 gets denied again, definitely can retest 140 support. Will buy another  leap
Anything hydrogen, FCEL and PLUG have been like owning a money tree for the past few weeks
i can't fap to this kind of loss porn.  not my kink
I feel like everyone who says this doesnt actually know what happened with LK lol

The business itself is doing just fine, even today. What killed its stock wasnt bad fundamentals it was corporate leadership straight lying.

Could it happen to NIO? Sure, but assuming it's gonna tank because of fraud while having no evidence that said fraud is happening is just pure retardation. Plus their numbers look in line with XPEV and LI, so youd be basically betting on all Chinese EV companies lying. Again, could be true but I see it as a low percentage scenario.
It went up.

People think it if they've read about the company's history and tech. People did this about PLUG once, too. FCEL (iirc) is into building powerplants and shit but not even using hydrogen (which is why PLUG is so... explosive...these days). PLUG is going for many different markets and is also investing in its infrastructure. FCEL is...old and just a catchy ticker.
How does George’s dick taste?
*laughs in IV crush*
This guy!!!
He is selling because he didn’t agree with the principles of what the company does. Which frankly makes me like it even more
I bought 100 shares at 15ish and 200 more at 17ish. Wanna wait for a while in PLTR then toss it all into ABNB when they ipo
Gg ur rich
And then they got beat down, just like Fisker has and will be getting until they have something real to show
🤡
I'll gladly take this over a 15% dump

Soros is selling his position. Just announced.
I’m unfortunately already in. But I sold 1/3 of my position for +10% and my PLTR position I say traded covered the rest so as long as PLTR stays green I’m fine. House money in a sense.
Limit down tomorrow
Its just nearly impossible for someone to get your autogenerated password without phishing.

Who’s getting drunk after today’s wild ride?
people acting like he's dumping shares tomorrow. they said they've already sold their 20% pre lockup tradable shares. rest of soros shares will have to be held through feb
I know, right?  Like if only when I tried to buy 1 share just now if it would have had a popup with something like this in it:

`Estimated Order Value $3.04`

`Estimated Commission $0.00`

`Estimated Foreign Settlement Fee $50.00`

`Estimated Total Value $53.04`

Yeah, that would be nice. /s
> You could instead sell weeklies against your 100 shares

What's a good stock to do this with?
People who pay their debts only do it for a sense of pride and accomplishment.
Inverse the inverse + inverse it x 2 = 6969% yoy gains
If you’re talking about technical analysis, go on investing.com and there are different metrics like StochRsi and 50EMA and stuff
Oh boy you bought at the top didn't ya. Next time look into dollar cost averaging
😂 good luck with that.. I’ll give you one thing, you’ve got time!
yup that’s the plan, i’m up 2k in the last month doing this rando calls shit so ima keep doing it but with bigger and bigger calls
Even if it does, is it really worth the risk?

I swear we live in a simulation. Just yesterday some guy in here was like imagine if Amazon came out with a vaccine and delivers next day. Today they announced they’re selling prescription drugs. By next Monday we’re going to see Amazon come out with a 96% success rate done by Bezos himself.

Hope you bought dis calls...tomorrow is mickey mouse day
Undervalued currently imo. Not to be political but LMT historically does very well in turbulent/war times, and frankly we are in a long history of peace right now and it doesn't usually stay that way. I'm already in RTX.

Nio doubled in a month. Only dumbasses who got shafted were people who bought Friday at 53, or bought options that expire the week of earnings. If you did these things... you deserve your shafting.

Wont matter if he lost 'some' because it's a leap...
Bought some calls at noon. Needed a convincing run to get me in
I can’t think of things that can dump this market
Ohh, so one option corresponds to 100 shares? This makes more sense
What was that huge drop then surge ?
FYI if anyone wants free pics, the best ones are posted every day on r/onlyfans
Lmao 🚀 🚀
My puts have tested positive for Coronadumbass
He probly thought this was going to be used for a globalist agenda, maybe thiel has too much influence to let that happen so hes out. And look at the sell orders, there is a huge block of like 390k in the $18 range. He wants it to tank and lose momentum...or maybe he wants it to tank so he can get in at a lower price point
NIO
Once futures go red, even for -0.05%, they stay red all night.
Cus those shit hole countries don’t have many people who can afford to pay for only fans subs
Whats closer

Califlower pizza to pizza

I was about to upvote but you are at 69 points so fuck your vote.
Soros is such a cuck. Some guy no longer w the company made him 100% returns and he says “we do not support this company” hahaha he’s mad he didnt pick PLTR himself 🤡
Probably either flat or dumping. Give it a week to get in.
“My tip” ? please. Let musk daddy slide in his 550 12/4 already, he’ll make you feel good.
This entire sub has been one big NIO shill for over two weeks now.
Excellent
More people down to fuck
Except no boomers know what a PLTR is
Imagine being stressed out about someone elses financial circumstances. Imagine thinking anyone at this point is paying back their student loans. Imagine thinking someone could potentially show up at your door and repo your fucking Tupperware. I can't decide who is dumber in this scenario.

Remember when all u assholes thought NIO was gonna move violently in one way or the other? Good times
Yeah man, it’s beings weird ass year. I just got so stupidly lucky. The fed and the vaccine news made me rich. 5 months ago I wouldn’t have ever imagined this. I’m scared people will find out, I’ve only told one of my sisters
Pot calling the kettle black.

whatcha get into? options? calls?

Their leader is a nutter
You can walk home from the bars.
Therefore NIO will always be over $50. Interesting.
You’re back!
Is there any reason it started mooning today of all days?
Lol i rode it from 3 to 25......probably gonna but some calls tomorrow 😉
Tomorrow we will be -=flooded=- in New with people posting "What us IV crush"  and "earnings and the stock is up, why is my option losing money after a good earnings"
fellow noob here in a similar position — when does theta kick in here and wreck me?
Cramer is about to pump RIDE. Get in for the boyah bump.
Exactly. Loaded up on puts. Gonna sell them to fund calls. Self perpetuating tendies.
I bought a bunch yesterday, who knew this sub could be right sometimes.
Wow a growth company burned cash and isn't as big as mature companies that have been around for multiple decades? No way!
damn son just cause they're leaps doesn't mean you gotta hold til expiry
I don't think malls are making a comeback, they're being turned into amazon distribution centers
Question. Is there an app that keeps track of each individual stock’s RSI or is that something I calculate myself? I just spent the last hour going through a few of my favorite stocks calculating the RSI for them and was considering making an excel spreadsheet to keep track, but if something like that already exists it would save me a lot of time. Sorry if that’s a noob question.
I know, right?
Doesn't pay to piss off the brass
Ur dum
Why would it be illegal to coordinate plays in a video game? The worse that can happen is we get banned from the app.
Is sinovac not publicly traded?
Same lol
What do us share holders get?
Don’t give up on NIO they haven’t even had the call yet..earnings were good...guidance was good...everything points to a surge tomorrow
Oof you got good expiration though
Wow. Wtf hope and know you will fk this up. I'm marking this post so I can follow your tragic life to the homeless shelter
Might go up or down
agreed, looking forward for the 1.5k lesson! :)

Why do people like living in big cities? Everything is expensive and you spend 99% of the time indoors anyways

I'm in.  Can verify music lol...
Curious, why LMT?
I highly doubt Palantir is going to be seriously hurt by someone saying that they’re evil. It’s kind of their thing.
xpev isn't up 1000000000% like nio
I’m gonna double anyway
I’ve been on a nice winning streak lately but I may have purchased an irresponsible amount of QQQ puts today
Thanks for the stock seems like a good stock. Looks like its going up. Especially now that ev are taking over its going to be steady maybe dip here and there but the more evs take over the market the bigger itll get
Holy fuck just hit $60 this is crazy 


Fuck you
[removed]
Haha, well I just put in $50k more at $260, already down 10%, and judging from experience after I buy the market will conspire to fuck me so you probably dead too, sorry..

I’ll keep doubling down until I’m a majority shareholder and Xi fucks me in the ass
They forgot the kind of retard strength these meme stocks can have.
For the next 5-10 years people are always gonna ask... how did u take advantage of the 2020 crash?
I have 3 trading days left of course my weeklies will print by then.

Have a feeling we are gonna see a slight decrease in numbers here on wallstreetbets tomorrow NIO blew up a lot of accounts today.
We must be long lost brother. Same move haha
I’m balls deep in PLTR and all I could think about today was “I hope this crashes so I can double up”.

LEAPS hit different.
If there's dip, I'm gonna double down on PLTR.
BABA has to go on a face ripper in the next week or two...
Welcome home, buddy
We might get another shot at a decent entry after almost missing the bus the first time
LOL PLTR will crash hard in Feb. Soros will make sure of it. Employees want to dump their POS shares.
Is riot a good buy?

Thanks man, it honestly hasn’t even hit me yet. Just today the value increase 100k and I didn’t even flinch. I’m just blessed. Going to take care of my family and just keep the money in the brokerage account and use it a a career leverage I guesss. I love working so the retire early idea is not for me

how original
The fact that its worth more than a bunch of the other vehicle manufacturers combined tells me otherwise but thats just an opinion. Im not saying the stock price wont go up on this. It probably will, all im saying is that it doesnt exactly hold water as an investment idea. If youre buying into tesla now, you should be doing it because its tesla and for no other justification. Which is fine too.
Thanks. You just convinced me to buy.

I'm hoping we're at the bottom. It looks like it has solid support where it's at now, barring any other major catalysts. I sold a $280P to start running the wheel on it a few weeks ago.. oof. Bad timing. Will be bag holding a while and selling very OTM calls
Ban
Don't listen to this guy he's clueless. Soros bought 13 years ago and sold at $9. Has no effect on the stock price..
MRNA invented the virus so obviously they have the cure too.
Risky play. Probably hasn’t been maintained in years. Calls on $BUSH
whats gonna happen to PLTR
Yes.  International. Don’t do it.

This is my new why
As a man of modest stature, I hope they don’t go bankrupt. One of the few companies who sell clothes my size. 😆
Idk, those Acb stocks really payed out for me and the IV was like 300%
We should double team
Either a job, yolo till rich, or in a dim alleyway with lipstick on lol
That actually is the line of arguments companies make when the government mandates any features. The seatbelt one isn't as great because a seatbelt provides protection when a specific event happened like an accident. Most people won't ever get in a severe accident in their lives. I'm not arguing against seatbelts or a vaccine but the other side will make this argument
Damn they are now 1.36
I asked but it too pussy to speak up how it feels
Maybe but he sold all he could already and the stock jumped. He’s gonna unload slowly on the creep up I don’t think he 1) can sell al he has and 2) if he could he’s definitely gonna take max profit even if he doesn’t agree with the companies values

I sold at 17.70 lol might regret it though.
I ain't judgin'
Some of them are hawt
You're obviously shorting it and trying to spread misinformation. Shut up
I swear to God, if I have to cash out these PLTR calls at +75% tomorrow morning instead of the 150% I could have gotten before close today I’ll be mildly annoyed
Nope just mainline doses of hopium and carry those fuckers home.
Only way it would have happened is if Dems took the senate. The old fart is gonna just constantly play hard ball now as a screw you to Dems.

I thought whales communicated with sonar and bubbles.
yeah, totally with you on future vaccines and I think both companies are more likely than not to win out. I'm coming from a personal standpoint as to what I would actually want to take. With all the money/politics/etc around pfizer and moderna and the fact this is new technology I personally have some skepticism hence why I'd prefer to sit out until Astrazeneca, but we'll see.

Actually I invested in BLNK this morning and made 18% and sold so I'm happy now
Soros regrets buying PLTR for ethical reasons. Lmao. Is this guy for real? Pot calling the kettle black. Someone remind this guy of the currencies he crashed. Anyway, PLTR 25-30 EOM.
Who is 🚀ing though
Yeah but luckin coffee is just liquids. This shit is EV cars and batteries I think. A.k.a the future. Same way Alibaba is China's Amazon, Nio is china tesla

I'll sell you that weekly
keep seeing RIOT being mentioned. make sure you look at the 5yr chart before considering investing. people trying to pump and dump. mods use to ban for mentioning of penny stocks, now its being promoted freely. sad times

nah hes doing it for ethical reasons not because its not profitable.. (re: data analysis/spying etc..)
Damn  congrats
A German company also scored high on the massive fraud scale this year
Those are pretty deep ITM now and quite long expiration. You can keep them and they act pretty much like shares. Can sell covered short exp calls against them. Or just sell them for tendies. They have loads of extrinsic value in theta and the IV is crazy high, you'd lose on this if you exercised. If you feel very bullish, buy higher strike calls.
Good idea, the market will correct itself after externalities face fuck the environment

Bought them Nov 3rd. Just don’t think there’s any good future entry point available. :/

[EOS Energy](https://eosenergystorage.com/) is now live for anyone that's been following: NASDAQ - EOSE
Thank you. I made the horrifying move of not having a sell order in place at open, thinking that it would hit 470+ and lost plenty of that chimkin. Managed to escape with 15k+ at the end of the day. Not complaining but damn.
one whale order will send it fucking flying on retail FOMO.

That’s true they didn’t even have the conference call yet, there could be some news during the call...not worried about my calls at all
Maybe I’ll buy in 15 years. Who knows, maybe hydrogen cars will take off by then and the gasoline ban will all go to hydrogen cars. But let me invest in this stock based on a prediction 10-15 years in the future and the stock has a -EPS every quarter but it’s worth more than GM.

THANK FUCKING GOD I DIDN’T PLAY NIO ER
Wash your ass in bathtub like me
It's hard to imagine an upgrade at this valuation but who knows.
God damnit futures stop being green. I need to buy into LMT, Mastercard, and/or BAC tomorrow

Plz dip I shoulda bought when the erection was causing volatility
That hurt my eyes
Here's my question. If it turns out you need boosters because efficacy is fleeting then wouldn't fatigue be an issue. So people get pissed that they have to get a vaccine every idk say 3 months and then just rage quit? What's the prognosis then?
The ER is already out. Not sure what news they'd release additionally in the call that would change much. Unless they're gonna be expanding into Europe early or something.
thank you for your service sir
In the world we currently live in I've not logged onto unknown WiFi since probably March and I don't ever click links that aren't ones I prompted into existence. But, something went sideways somewhere so you could be right.
Maybe it fixes the 🌎
Stop buying at the top fool
I don't think the scenario or an entire first world country requiring 100% electric vehicles in ten years is priced in anywhere
Palantir literally has a product called Gotham. I’m sure sweet innocent Soros just didn’t know!
And sure enough, TSLA came back down

God Soros is such a virtue signaling cuck fuck that guy
Buy shares you bastards
So the Soros news cane out during market hours. Couple reasons why it’s not a big deal. Acquisition happened in 2012, and it seems he sold a couple of weeks ago not today. Don’t worry PLTR holders
Vix calls for 99% of people because that shit isn’t easy to trade.
Are you saying my 50k PLTR yolo ISNT? A good play?!
Try making all of your position sizes the same every time. When your account gets bigger your positions get bigger.
good luck on 18.5C
Thinking Express (EXPR) could be a potential home run. Looking to add yolo April 2021 calls and a shit ton of shares. Talk me out of it?


They entered penny stock territory in September due to covid but still managed to survive financially. Bankruptcy highly unlikely imo. I think the worst of retail optics has passed. Nordstrom, Macys, etc have mooned but there's still plenty to go due to value. Express hasn't stepped up yet.


Shopping malls will make a comeback if these vaccines really do work. I know e-commerce has dominated but there's always space for B&M foot traffic. Express's demographic are neither rich people, teeny boppers, or welfare queens. Medium class have and can spend $$ here. It's $0.90/share now and was $2 in June. I think it's very possible we can get there again by April.


Thoughts?
my AMD 10P for 12/1/2022 enjoyed reading this.

Hi I'd like to go back a couple hours and sell my positions. Can RH help me with that?
The name is Bahg Holderson. They call me that. Because that's what I do.
PLTR was gonna tank in jan/feb anyways. Employees who waited for a lifetime to GTFO at IPO finally have the same and people who can't sell and hate the company like SOROS can dump his 24 + million shares out.
10k, whole portfolio basically memes. What do you know it works
I heard Xi Jinping will personally give me a handjob if I buy a NIO. AND NOW I'M ON A LISTS
Glad I could help
Feeel like NIO is gonna be diamond vs paper, bear vs bull, trying to scrape a nut off. It’ll go up and down all day with WSB exiting at the time they think is best for themselves. A lot of people gonna minimize losses including me. 


Or it’ll tank to hell. Idk
these short term charts look real dumpy.
Every day you will loose a little time value until expiration. So even if it holds current share price it will loose some money.
Welp it didn't.
ppl r so fucking dumb. goddamn

I've been looking at SBE. Haven't pulled the trigger yet.

then you must not be a true autist. this is the way
Fucking probably. I was all in on NIO before I got cucked by Citron, so now that I’ve moved over to PLTR, I read another fucking article that takes away my tendies. REEEE
There’s no difference in profit exercising vs just leaving option open.. if PLTR is above strike you wouldn’t have IV exposure.. I’d let it run.. or set a stop loss which would trigger a sale if PLTR broke a lower level of support..
Don’t even wanna waste the mods time with this one

It doesn't matter how much you've paid, does it? It matters what you'll owe. He makes $15k a year *if* he works full time, which it sounds like he doesn't.

So his standard deduction is 12,400. He pays FICA on 6%ish. So he's left with 14k gross. Now tell me where he's supposed to itemize his way past that standard deduction.
May calls already itm. Thinking hold some, move some up & out
Cramer pumping it right now. Could see a good bounce to end the week. I picked up some 11/20 260c today on the cheap. $312 though? Damn...

it might help you get laid.

That fucker could of made a alt and been one of the kings of Reddit
You do know reverse mergers are for lower tier companies that may struggle to get through an IPO. The company the merge into gets a big discount on the shares. 

Stripe is dead set on an IPO and I as a current shareholder would be 100% pissed at the management for doing it and would gather others to sue and block it.
NIO is up 14% in Zimbabwe right now
You can probably cash out and make money on another play with what is tied up there.  Hell wait for an AAPL pull back then buy leaps with them
This is all so retarded. Let the market decide when gas cars go out of business. It will eventually happen, but government  mandates fix nothing.
Nio's true reckoning will be what the big boy institutional investors say between now and market open. A few upgrades could send it flying, and on the flip side q few downgrades and she drilling back to $30

Lemme hold a dolla
Yea but bears keep saying “die nio” in their delusional hopes their puts won’t fuck them

I sold my shares when it hit 26 points.  I'm happy with that.

Man I initially bought this because I kept seeing those PLTR letters in my feed and I didn’t want to miss another meme stock. My expectations carry the same weight as my dick....Minimal.
Yeah, I agree. I've been telling my neighbor to invest in PLTR and he wasn't sure, then when I showed him Sorros had money in it, he bought in. So I definitely agree that pump was from false confidence. I'mma let my neighbor figure out for himself that Sorros is pulling out, and hopefully he and everyone else just isn't paying that much attention and keeps YOLO'ing (at least until Jan, for the sake of my calls)
If NIO tanks it's not overweight anymore in your portfolio and other positions weight increase in relation

Get more time
So I just need BABA to hit $312.95 by Friday real quick to break even
No man, shouldn't have done that.
I flat week will fucj me up
This is the way
This is the fucking remarried, cuck, stepdad version of the dad joke.
Imagine believing Soros’ excuse on why he sold Palantir. He’s just taking profits after making an insane amount since he bought in during 2012. If anything Palantir was more shady in 2012 than they are now. He knew what he was buying, his “reasoning” of his selling is his lame attempt to virtue signal to his investors.
Fake news. U.K. will be no more by then. Brexit

Wtf is evolutionary psych and will it help me buy better options?
Is NIO opens under $50 tomorrow I will eat a piece of pizza for breakfast
Shit well fair enough

That whale fucked.
8 420 tesla calls. bought them for 4.50, sold them at 41.15 right at open. i would have never imagined they were going to pop 13% after hours. right when i heard the news i set a limit sell at 30 dollars, since we were about 40 dollars above strike price
Nice troll

Where are you looking at? I see 45.85
Huh ?

This is how the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

how do you define low key rich ? a million net worth?
Good luck
You know you can sell the calls THIS WEEK at the strikes you own for 2021? That’s big brain
Both are solid DD's by WSB standards, red pill or blue pill? Pussy
Up 1% , PLTR and APHA up more than SNE and FITB down.
Respect. That’s hard to look back on almost buying those calls 🥴
I’m scared to see my 11/27 NIO calls I bought at close I think we’re gonna have a decent pump at open just because it’s NIO though

The entry could have been better but with a little patience you are looking well.
Would be hilarious if NIO just sat at 45 until December to fuck everyone over.
Salt is obvious. This guy definitely lost on a trade and is in here taking it out on everyone else.

You pushed the button. Man up.
that sounds like you're going to be writing unit tests, or writing CI/CD pipelines. Not necessarily a pigeon hole, but its tools/skills you need to learn along the way to help you advance in your career
His only stated reason for selling (after investing millions 8 years ago) is that they are unethical and at the time the unethical nature of big data was 'not known'. 

Its weird. Of course he only says all this directly after it becomes public knowledge that he was a big investor in it.
Alright, thanks
I would be, if I knew what any of those words meant

If you want to take the gains then just sell your contracts, you dont need to exercise them.  Just take the profit.
Yeah they trying to kick my baby out tho
Yeah, those NIO weeklies were rough last week. At least I'm not getting IV crushed tomorrow
I’ll hold you till market open tomorrow

I saw RIOT hit +10% but stayed away because "there's no way it can keep going up". Then I did it again at +20% and +30% 🤡
Are my 11/27 calls gonna be ok I spent a good amount on them at close
Comparing to logitech
I think MRNA and Pfizer are the winners here. AstraZeneca does not plan to take profit from their vaccine until July 2021. MRNA and Pfizer have contracts with governments around the globe, so sales are guaranteed. Analysts saying that profits are already priced in cannot estimate the magnitude of future successes of the technology that will be validated by the approval of an mRNA vaccine.

Edit: MRNA $92c 12/31 and MRNA $95c 4/16

Yes it is considered a premier EV company
Ally Bank sent me an email called “we’ve summarized your financial story” but I already know what it says and let me tell you boys it’s not good.

I’d be careful man. Soros is selling his shares most likely. That’ll cause a pretty heavy pull back at the least.

Pump!  bought at 9cent.
I'm considering selling all my tech and buying more corsair ,it feels like safe easy money to me? Should be worth double at least in this market
I was gonna hold and ended up selling for a -55% loss at close. Had FOMO for like 2 minutes lmfao
Can you spare me some peyote as well
Whoa lol 30 years who let the boomer in
$TJX puts
where can i see nio conference call
I feel safe here. Not sleeping tonight thats for sure
Short? It do be pumping with beetcoin

Yep! Kinda sucks that the letter is during the quiet period though

I’m lowkey Legit rich now, it honestly doesn’t feel any different. I’m not much of a spender so my life will largely remain the same. Feels weird
The action we have seen on NIO is not a result of MMs delta hedging, and they would be dumping *now* if it was.
why?
Please. Plug Power is still fresh in my memory.
yeah. this justify why its up so high ...cool, nio is pumping tomorrow! I cant wait to throw down all my money into nio tomorrow morning. who is all buying nio tomorrow???????
Just once this month I’d like to be able to hold puts for longer than a few hours with some confidence. Couldn’t even enjoy the 100% gains on my 11/20 SPY 357’s today for longer than ten minutes before I went into stop loss bear mode.
Yea everyone who bought puts will be wiped out for sure
Hurts, but you can't do that. I just tossed 20k in the trash... Not the first time either.
Always forward! Next trade!

I don't believe he did not know what they do/did when he invested.  That would be keenly retarded with $100 million.  I bet he wants to drive it down to buy more.
Seriously. Like what is OP’s problem?
Hands of spade
Because im a learner i like to learn new things. Im already making money. Not rich money but decent money. Im here to look at all the stocks that you peoppe talk about do my research and if they sound moderately safe and have good standing for the last 3 to 5 months ill dip in and dip out before the end of the week on friday.

So you have any stocks to mention young lass
I’m trying to learn more about the lingo in this thread and investing - What does this statement mean exactly? Speak English, Doc!
Long shbitcoin. I should get in riot too.
It leaks that Soros Fund bought PLTR

PLTR goes uppies 

Soros himself says it was a mistake and someone else bought it who no longer works there. Plans to sell all of it.

PLTR goes downies.
so puts or calls

Everyone here awoke today with their heart beating, and when you opened your eyes, light came in. Be grateful you are not ashes in the wind or 6ft underground. Now carry on you beautiful degenerates, and let’s YOLO everything we have until we are climbing that stairway of fortune.
I’ll see you here when you actually post lost porn. Like real lost porn, 100% down. Get out with this bs.

I told myself I would chill with the weeklies so I loaded up on PLTR shares instead of calls. Still made some money today but man if I had picked up some $16.5C weeklies at the same time as I picked up my shares 😩
he's already sold all the shares he can before the lockup

Okay, RIOT actually looks like a fun bet.

Don't follow Soros. Follow Cathy Woods. She knows her shit.
what happened
Paper hands
Did you select the “fingers were crossed” option before your trade?
i’m long on sbe.. holding shares
Fuck no. Not a big deal at all. He bought in at super low prices years ago before it went public. He’s just taking profits now and using a cute excuse to virtue signal.
Why doesn’t PLTR use their software to figure out how to mate their company more money? 🤔
its too bad hitler didnt kill soros
I’m balls deep in warrants. Love this one
The amount of people clearly loaded to the brim with puts makes me 99.9% certain we will have a nice 0.80% gain tomorrow and there will be a lot of “this is rigged what the fuck! COVID bro!!🥺🥺👶🍼🥺”
You ask this question and call everyone else retarded, that's next level.

I'm not disagreeing that we are retarded, but what does it say to be the dumbest mofo in the thread then?
Paper hands
he sold
replying to this so i can come back when someone responds
That’s crazy I guess I’m not surprised tho 😂 😂
Huh? What’s Theta?
I worded it poorly. Whenever I sell calls the underlying stock always moons and I get assigned. So I sold a call to ensure PLTR would blow up.
low-iq people on stocktwits think this is a headwind for the stock, but he basically said he is stuck holding and cant sell any more until the lockup ends
And exciting
Define leap
That guy probably can't even afford wifi
My March $330’s are dead. I’m so sad lol
always inverse WSB
Imagine having Nio in your retirement account. You really think this company will hold up for 30+ years. Lmao
its true... fuck
[removed]
Fuck we used to gap up 4 points on the regular back in summer.
Nope. PLTR will dump. It is just new hype about a company that is doing rather boring work.
Thanks I'd like to dedicate it to my parents and papa Elon.
“I see Dem people”
Yeah, that's why he is selling, fired the guy that bought them (back in 2012), he's selling all 18.5 million of his shares. No idea how much Cathie Wood has in them (haven't looked). You're right that it shouldn't have anything to do with the company or its financials, but as someone who is holding Dec. calls, I am a bit worried about that many sales driving the price down short-term, just in time for those calls to not be worth as much or even print. Especially combined with the poor earnings report, I think this stock is riding on YOLO more than fundamentals at the moment, I think it'll settle around $18 ( I'm holding $14 and $15.5 calls, so that works for me, but not as well) . I mean, I'm YOLO'ing it, but I wish we hadn't reminded Sorors about where his money is until January.
Stock price always drops after ex dividend date. Or else you can just buy stocks right before dividend dates and sell it after lmao.

I'm not saying MSFT's movement is 100% from that, but it has an effect. Google "buying stocks before dividend date" to learn more
It still is
That can be easily extended either way no? Regardless it’s gonna be stripe

Can someone give me an quick summary of the whole Soros-Palantir Issue?
The CEO of Polaris (PII) just announced he is leaving at the EOY to go be CEO somewhere else. PII has dropped as much as 8% AH today. Look at the YTD chart for PII, it seems to have a lot of resistance at $90 and has bounced back off that price about five times since May. 

I've bought stocks twice at $90 but no options, yet. Might pick up some calls 2-3 months out if it hits $90-ish tomorrow. Post-Covid high looks to be around $107.60.
[removed]
So NIO hasn’t issued a guidance yet?
Some nerve this lady has
That is the laziest typed out comment I’ve ever seen you sloth
RIOT Anyone?
Soros is full of shit lol. He loves data mining and analytics just like every other billionaire.

Depends on where ya live. I went to school in Northern California and I never heard about Soros but goddam cock man was the devil incarnate.
I hope you’re joking
So i can buy back into a few stocks i missed out on

How long does PSTH have left to decide a target?
-0.10%*
The problem is kids have become accustomed to instant gratification. They all want to become overnight millionaires. They don’t realize whenever they buy, someone on the other end, usually institutions with more power and resources, are selling to them. They get caught up with media and whatever someone on TV is saying without actually thinking. A bunch of rice farmers aren’t buying Nios, no one outside the country are buying them either.
George Soros can suck a Palantir penis
Why release it after hours? Seems sus lol but let’s see
Eow or ban

Sorry tesla stan not trying to offend your soy sauce. I cant im not done on here yet

"you're all caught up!"
As others said. Learn about IV. Should've sold the calls.
Sounds like he held for years 💰
I let my options hit -99% and double down so my cost basis gets cut in half

Late September actually. 
Their earnings call was pretty damn good last week.
Your definitely rich. Call you boss right now and tell him to fuck off and you quit.
Fraud
Remember when you all said GME was the move to play
They are technology consultants. Someone goes to them with an issue handling data or creating an interface or whatever and they develop a custom solution. They have base platforms that they can customize based on whatever the customer's needs are. 

Similar to how SAP develops accounting software off their own platforms for customers.

Like I don't think what they do is super complicated stuff (at least to a computer science graduate or software engineer, which I am not) but most of industry doesn't know anything about how to deal with data so there's a demand.
I'm closing on my home purchase on 12/18. either this goes up and I sell or I cancel my contract to purchase.
I think it’s a slow climb, or maybe stagnancy for a while then when some catalyst happen EVs will get meme strength again.
Shitcoin
why would u hope to open red?
George Soros ignoring a winner right infront of his eyes? What an idiot!

If you spent 5k on puts this morning you’d have 20k
I agree
I see flat?

It’s weird how exhausting anticipation can be
Your thumb
Lol stupid no one knows yet based on initial sell off I would say down we’ll see
What they said Experience is king CS degree just gets your foot in the door.
Whoever I sold NIO puts to: I'm not sorry at all. Your choice to buy 200%+ IV FDs right before earnings. Thanks for your donation.
Felt down this morning and blindly bought some AUY just to buy something. Is this worth holding or should I get out once I’m in the green?
These NIO 11/20 60c might lose a little of its value tomorrow
Meme remixes
Yes
Depends on when you bought it. If you bought it when IV was high, then the option is impacted.
Hertz, Luckin,Kodak.
on the way to jizzing man. Hope it opens up. My body is ready for this.
I wonder if GUH still browses wsb
Noob
You sound like a noob rn

I think PLTR can shake it off, but it may be rocky tomorrow. 

Hold the line boys.
Idk we’ll have to wait and see

Hey! Upside down UK starts the markets :(

dude...
So not only did i use my whole account on NIO calls, I used as much margin as possible. If this dont move by friday im gonna cry
🐻🔫
This is what a noob would say
yea
Why don't you create some sort of professional finance tool or options data website or something (like finviz or waffles.io). 

Something that let's everyone know WSB fucks harrrdddd. And the days of being shit on are over and  all those smug finance cucks find themselves staring at the future of options trading and whispering its name in the dead of night.. and that name is stonks.com.
Don't be ridiculous. With mortgage rates at an all time low, clearly the play here is to get a 2nd and 3rd mortgage on his parents' house.
I’m going to pound your little ass .
fuck these faags
Should Pltr calls be that worried about Soros
Thanksgiving
You sir, we’re the closest one! TSLA closed at $441. Congrats, here’s your award! 🥇
This is the ONLY way
Not really, you just don’t know how to read words other than moon and calls.
just remember not to sell if the stock drops. Diamond hands it’ll rise

I dropped $16k today on NIO er, but won’t spend $1.99 to remove ads for Among Us on iPhone. “And that’s how I became a billionaire.”
Lol i had the automod tell me im a noob wth. Ive been doing stocks since 2013 and ive made good money. If i was a noob how come im always picking good stocks. Automod bot is crazy 😂😂😂😂
I swear, if BABA dips tomorrow, I’ll exit my March 310c (which are already down $2k) for a loss! I mean there’s a limit to a stock falling, doesn’t it get it!? 😔😔😔
AMD hasn’t been doing SHIT I’m down like 10k on it.
Futures -0.01%

I feel like with tsla specifically this scenario is already pretty priced in but then again theres the whole martian market im sure no ones considering 🤷🏻‍♂️😂

I love PLTR.  Fucking money machine.
Everyone here been talking IV’s lately. I take it it’s time to buy medical stonks?
is a company like 3m a good play? PPE needs are going to sky rocket, I'm sure this summer stock-piles are getting low already, or is this already priced in?
I had a pretty shitty close, finished down 8%.  Flat on the week.  APPS absolutely cucked me last week however and I'm down about 3% all time again after being up 10% early last week.
Etsy’s brand is the polar opposite of Amazon’s so that was always a weird shot. I’m looking at GDRX as I do think it’s an overreaction but consumers will happily buy their Rx from the best fulfillment company and there will likely be discounts.
Hey dude, in the morning this position will be deeply red due to IV crush. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
What's the ICE thing I've been hearing about Palantir?

Old news, knew about this at 1pm
They only hold 2 meme tickers. Im disappointed. Was expecting to see RKT, PRPL, SLV, GLD, TSLA, HRTZ..... all i got was NIO and SPCE.
Thought you’d say we shouldn’t say this lol 

Anyways, NIO 🚀🚀
O fking hope so
do you guys think it's too late to get in at 45? i agree that they have so much room to grow.
RIDE AH volume almost as much as BA 🚀🚀
My portfolio has 0 in it.
Today was not key for RKT...
Go onto his profile, he has a post of his boy order for Tesla shares from 2013

See, I am long on palantir and I believe in the business long term; however this is still retarded.

Message their Twitter account, highlight your emergency and give them your case number. They can escalate it sometimes
Looks like calls and puts will be fucked. But we’ll see. Meme status is gone for this stock
Hmmm what? People should be writing automated test when they are developing. These automated tests should be ran each time in the build.

Tits down, tits up, as long as there are tits, it's good
Lol i hope
Still plenty of upside left. It's still a 100 bucks off of its pre COVID price.
I saw this same mentality when weed stocks were hot a few years ago. 

That's actually the only reason I stayed away from nio. Those types are always the ones holding bags in the end.

Glad I learned that lesson back then

For those asking how NIO can keep going up: NIO is only up 2300% on the year. Numbers are infinite (never end), meaning NIO's potential could quite possibly never end

Who TF is selling at this point too? I guess we just gotta wait for some signal from the CCP that they're not going to execute Jack Ma or something before it goes back up.

Hey guys I bought an options calls contract for a company called NIO that reports their earnings today. It’s my first options contract. I’m reading they beat expectations. These contracts will make me a lot of money I’m assuming? Thanks!
Long term like monthlies?
[deleted]
Or diamonds
Only europeans have a comma instead of a decimal point
should be 69.420% and 50.580%
I should point out I sold the call to ensure it would go up. Literally assigned 80% of the time no matter how far out the strike price.
Nah. He sold at $9...
Up 17%
Fire was a mistake
they lost over $100 million thats a reason number 1
Always has been
11/27 330 $10 calls sounds tempting.
Good luck pal

Only ccp dare to short pltr.. but pltr gonna fuck them back in the ass.. lol
Other F word
See ya again next summer bb
This. Any efficacy lower than 90 would cause a big sell off and a bump for MRNA and PFE. 94.5% is hard to beat so I bought 1/15/21 110 Calls. Once they receive FDA approval which is being fast-tracked, I could see a nice run up to 110. Also, the US wants to vaccinate 20 million people by the end of the year so even a week or two longer for FDA approval would be detrimental to JNJ.
I’m sorry man, best of luck, but your puts are most likely fucked.
Not sure but it would involve Elon Musk's cock.

Sell PLTR calls at open. Soros killed them. Link[link](https://www.benzinga.com/node/18418066)
How are they reporting this when their earnings call doesn't start for another 45 minutes?
IF ONE MORE PERSON SAYS THE N WORD THEN SOMEONE ELSE SAYS IV CRUSH IM GONNA EAT A FUCKING BOWL OF ICE CREAM TO CHILL OUT
NIO
Highly possible
I don’t know anything about NIO but I bought puts today because of how often it’s mentioned here
I heard PLTR will be at $40 by year-end. Is that true?
The IV on Jan calls is stupid low, so he's got a point for JAN Calls. Anything before that doesn't seem to make sense. If my BA puts go well, I'll go for this and BABA calls

Stupidest post I have ever read on Wallstreetbets,. They saved a lot of lives during my 4th and 5th deployment to southeast asia. The info we received during that time was indispensable to us. And yes info given to the American armed forces, believe it or not **WE ARE THE GOOD GUYS**.
And Biden wants to forgive 50k. That's 5k more he could have not done!
NIO is up/down 2%: Why are my 11/20 calls/puts dying???? 😭
So it was you that caused that crash
lol didnt even feel like a red day, everything on my list was up like 10-20%....

From an ethical standpoint he regrets it admitting that PLTR will make a fuck ton of money from mining peoples data.

He’s got enough nazi money to feel bad about he doesn’t need more.
He said it was a mistake and he’s selling his shares.

IV crush is the phenomenon whereby the extrinsic value of an options contract makes a sharp decline following the occurrence of significant corporate events such as earnings.

 Unfortunately, this implied volatility crush catches many options trading beginners off guard. Buyers of stock options before earnings release is the most common way options trading beginners are introduced to the Volatility Crush.

 Not only are they shocked to find out that they didn't make any money on their option - even though the stock went in their favor - they lost all their money!

I made 225k last week but it still sucks
So what, they hold onto the shares when everyone yoloing on calls stops yoloing on calls and waits for the price of the stock to drop before they sell shares?

No fookin way you made that on a single call, proof or ban
Facts
I actually had that same dream lol
I bought 200 shares yesterday. I was thinking of going all 2022 calls but I’ve burned doing that before. What strike did you get?
Hedge funds all protected up with their collars and other hedges. It will take a few big sellers to unwind all this though. Just need one small dealer to get margin called before they have to liquidate. Just one, just lever up boiis.
Is it 9:30am yet
LOL if you think Stripe would do a reverse merger.
Idiots can't quarantine for at least 2 more weeks until a vaccine comes out
I dont trust any rushed vaccine tbh.
Actually that was one of my better early plays. Hit a 6x
What does Soros matter here? If people didn't invest in evil companies, private prisons wouldn't be listed.
I thought trump was going to make companies report earnings twice a year.
What’s left to day trade this week. I need a potential 2 bagger day trade. Anyone?
Grab what you can then leave in a year and keep working on side projects. It's all about how to sell your experience and previous role. Learn to sell yourself.
They’re a bunch of kids who just put their life savings of $50 into Chinese Tesla, what did you expect?
Sold all mine at about 11am, got out with my gainz
But i really want to
I love radiohead
I have faith in Tesla in august it would gap
Up 5% every day hoping this was the catalyst to get it going
Probably because he made mad money on it already. He got in super early before it went public most likely.
Hey that’s just like your opinion man 🏳️‍🌈🐻

You should keep track of the most talked about meme stock on WSB maybe with your code skills you can scrape the data from here and have the ticker on the front page with charts and shit underneath to show how it's doing and maybe have a section which links to gain/loss porn, whoever gains or loses the most can have their own special quote in some sort of gallery and live forever in fame on stonks dot cum
You're doing money
Iv crush is coming for everyone who did not unload nio positions before closing. Theta gang wins this round.
Ah yes. A fellow retard

We both shall form 1 Nut Only gang
Just needs to drill through the Earth and pop through the other side first.
Fuck no. That won’t matter much at all. It helps more to find out more and more big money is in it.
The NIO call starts at 7 EST?
It’s very likely both are awful, it’s just funny to me that only one is a common punching bag
Doesn't sound so good. A friend with an average resumé got a job in the Midwest making that. He considered West coast but at that salary your cost of living would make it feel like not a whole lot of cash.
Baba
Something about data integration who gives a fuck.
trust me, I'm not...fomo'd into tesla calls today, sold fisker at $13, sold nio at $43 a week ago and have lost too much trying to short spy, I'm an idiot, trust me
Nah. Evil marches on. 

Soros sells, someone else buys.
Hope you don't miss those $100...

Not if you played Tesla puts at open lol
Any chance of up ?
RIP to your PUTS.

Logical, thx :)
If you don’t trade options, you must hate money. Or maybe just don’t like to gamble like the rest of us. 😂 Just multiply times x100 and that’s what I paid for each contract mentioned above and how much I sold it for. I follow support/resistance levels religiously, market momentum, combined with Tweetdeck (where I get all real-time news and market sentiment) and WSB sentiment. I made enough to buy a Tesla or 2 today but it’s not always rainbows and unicorns. As fast as you can make crazy money, you could lose crazy money. As long as you don’t get greedy, you secure profits often, respect the momentum, follow support/resistance levels and cut your loses early, You could do very very well. Much better than holding stocks over time...just ask anyone here
Last of my options and theta plays expire on June 18th. This is the day I give up options trading and go clean (100% stonks) for the rest of my life.
Too late. BABA go to 220. Then CCP may forget.
Hopefully you bought like 55p lol
Bear gang, clock in ! What precipitates the next DOWN down day by EOY?
RXT. Keep averaging in for more from 20. It keeps dipping. Feels awkward man.
They bought today most likely
You'd be a god amongst men if you had the working phone number to the RH help desk.
You’ve been warned, get your ass in RXT
Their pe ratio is now at 25 versus 99 for Amazon...
DICK OUT FOR DKNG

So soros is gonna fuck up those pltr bulls
Beware Lord Rajeev is watching 👀
your stupid radar tolerance must be set pretty high. Point me in the direction of something more retarded. I NEED to see that.
Perfect
I meant to buy 500 shares and fat fingered 5000. no calls because I think this is some type of divine intervention.
So TSLA putting it up NIO's muffler. RIP NIO call holders...

that's not a sell off

What’s something good to invest in that isn’t impacted by SPY? Da China boys? A good hedge essentially for when SPY has red days. Yes I know I can just hedge on SPY itself, but looking for a growth stock

Yeah I took profits on most my new puts. Still holding some. I assume IV crush applies to puts and lack of pure shit ER they'll be worthless.

Hopefully tomorrow macys dips a bit so i can hop back in. I made some money in september from macys
 I knew i should have dipped back in during election when the dip hit 6 bucks 😣😣😣
Yes, please do. My 10 contracts will thank you.
Ok but it is a role where i’d engineer automated tests == MAJOR pigeon hole??
When I bought I was targeting $20 EOY, could be $25 at this point but would be overvalued imo
Probably not moving much at all.

Does anyone have an estimate of what ABNB will ipo at? I guess it depends on how many shares they offer. I hope it’s somewhat low so I can buy a few thousand shares instead of a few hundred
Sorry man but it’s not possible at this point. Be more careful about your options next time
Yep. No need for us to travel and a lot of us arent going back in the office full time
Nice
People don’t want all their money tied up in shares. You underestimate how many retards have YOLOD on calls for this stock. As soon as all these retards get crushed on IV crush they sell their calls and the shares get sold by the MM to boot.

no one knows, it may even stay flat
Guh
Tbf they look “grey” - ie flat atm. Keeps switching.
It's not necessarily that much. Robinhooders as a collective might have a larger than expected percentage of all investments, but when you factor in the amount of trades these institutions and algos make per day it's negated.
SAME
Shoulda sold bud
Same strategy here with smaller gains. Threw 1k in a Fidelity brokerage account, 1k in a RH account, and 1k in a WeBull account back in July. Have peeled a combined 8k off the top and holding 7k now. If NIO takes off tomorrow will pull a bit more off or throw in SWBI (ridden up a couple times and Mango is not going down without a fight).

Well ill be down about 4k which isnt so bad to load up on 4 or 5 cheap stocks.

But that will never happen. Because we had outbreaks before and we got back to normal. Im sure everyone said the spanish flu would never leave and never get back to normal, but it did.

my vaccine dd: Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are new technology (mrna) and long-term effects are unknown. mRNA vaccines are probably the future, but I need more data. I'm waiting for AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine that's based on an adenovirus. It should have a high efficacy since it focuses on the spike proteins similar to Moderna/Pfizer
Ok
Tell me, have you ever seen a Nio car in person?

You realize this earnings report is unaudited
No it’s not, this stock is trading at 30X all future earnings, it’s wildly overpriced. You are in denial.
They’re green
I wonder if OP will write options against the position
Thanks feeling much better
Webull has extended hours trading from 4-9:30am and 4-8pm
What the fuck is “personal value”?  Is that you saying your $2 stock has a “personal value” of $100?
I know it won’t happen but I really hope NIO gaps down harddddd tomorrow so I can buy back my shares I sold earlier this week even cheaper. I think I sold at 46 or 47 or something else it really doesn’t matter because we’re all gonna die.

How do you like the fancy new insurance players like Lemonade and Bestow?
I should’ve clarified that this company does have options. It’s currently trading at $25 but the option block chain only goes up to $35

Edit: just checked all the dates. Even for the 2023 LEAPS the block chain for the calls peaks at $35
Well shit copy paste their videos to a better server they’re hosted on the backwater dying stuff. Probably doesn’t make any money doing it is why

DIX printed a 44.1 today

BUY BUY BUY
I too got fuk
not sure if this is /s but..... you’re up 88% which means this took about a month? roughly worth $140 with an unrealized profit of ~$60 if my math is right. I took 3 contracts, $25c for 1/15/21, yesterday before close for $0.90 each and cashed out at $1.92 each, just after lunch today. Not saying what your doing isn’t working but it could be working better.
Never said I’m not surviving. Doing great, but want to do better. That’s literally my point. Getting people to the level of survival does NOT mean they stop trying. Everyone wants more. You internalize fighting for more the second you walk into a school. $15/hr doesn’t triumph over that. Now stop yelling at the liberals in your intro to sociology class.
For anyone wondering 搞砸臭熊 means fuck them bears

China in trouble boy.  I wouldn't count those chickens just yet.  not saying your wrong, but there is a bigger picture at play.
KNDI currently sitting at 9.36$ so won't make you go broke buying calls. Today they got approved for US sales. Name another Chinese EV that does. 1/15/2022 10C today i was up 60% before 3:00. After the ev dive im at 38%. Recommend getting in tomorrow morning after it settles a little bit. Go for the 12C. 1/15/2022. They arent too expensive and have a real shot of hitting such WAY before the 2 year mark.

Would be good for a long call but the recent news might not get you the profits at 17.5c 11/20. I think today’s pump was driven by the fake news yesterday.
RIP my 11/20 11CC positions.
Everyone lost money and left
Why 7?
How does one constantly make the wrong plays. How. ?You could do what others are doing to make gains and you’d still lose. Is this spiritual?

I have a degree in STFU, but that doesn't mean you have to.
Actually macys went from 6 to 8 bro. Thats good. Anyways nakd was once around 400 bucks. If anything it can easily go to about 10 bucks and at .0880 u can put down 100 bucks for around 1200 shares.

Usio was around 3 and 4 so thatll go up since its a merchant company that processes payments.

LK had good earnings too. Have fun with your Chinese scam stock
Sell puts to buy stock.
It’s up overall for an after ER drop. It should have dropped to 40 but it didn’t even go that low. Everyone who understands analysis knows that the pattern is bullish and strong. It’s going over 50 tommorow nothing you can say is going to change that. They killed it with ER and they are chinas pride and joy for EV vehicles. China is nationalistic af and people don’t realize this, they want NiO to succeed not Tesla or any outside companies
I've seen it, but just watched it again.   Fuck nbc.
Thanks for the blueprint hehehe

Wear your mask brother

Go move somewhere else you’re saying you make 3k a week combined and can’t survive that’s a you problem
Calls it is.
Are you just looking at the EPS dots on RH? You are aren't you?

Go read the financials. 

21.7%  revenue increase from Q2 to Q3. 22.4% more vehicles sold, profit margin increased from 8.4% to 12.9%. None of that says it's the same.
When the market continues to move after 5 pm and you can’t make plays on RH does that just mean other brokerages have the ability to still trade until 7?
Nio earnings good. Sleeping good tonight
you belong here
Lol. Sure, if he avgs the fuck down tomorrow and close on any bounce. He might be good.
Every time futures opens it pushes spy down, is it just retail after hours traders who are idiots and going to get dumped on tomorrow morning again?

What kind of retard holds for more than 5 days anyway?
Exp date?
They sold 16k cars and lost $147,000,000
The sub ruined the rest of Reddit for me
The obligatory random red day was today. Green tomorrow.
What is the play for open tomorrow?
Wish I had family like you to show me how to get tendies early
3.5%
haha in my head it's always "there see it proved itself and it has entrered a bull trend. it's safe to buy now" \*stock went up 160% in 2 weeks\*
No. PLTR, RIDE and RIOT are next on the list. Pay attention.
Didnt i buy aes weeky the last post you had? Im down like 50% now. Would highly recommend
Interesting point there.
Should have bought VRYYF on the OTC
What price do you think PLTR will be EOY?
And you're as dumb as a fucking rock indoctrinated to think whatever you read from your mouthbreathing Trump Facebook groups.  What's the point of engaging with someone who is just going to resort to baseless name-calling.
Increases enthusiasm though
Found one of those retard permabulls who have no idea what they’re talking about, likely have a sub 2k portfolio, and have one 11/20 OTM call 🤦
Fried chicken !
Shit I’m just happy I can buy shit, close my eyes and wake up 20% richer almost every couple of days. Feels like April again 🐣
If you are tired of losing money buy $MOON ETF for long term. Yes they have taken our meme stocks and created an index and an ETF and will rebalance semiannually. Let the big boys do the hard work for you for once
I have a masters degree in economics. Unfortunately it’s in behavioral economics. Fortunately that’s led me to two key conclusions:

1.	You are all stupid
2.	Stupid doesn’t mean wrong
Why is SPY going down
Not without calculus
DKNG... join us
cool..bye!
just use smaller options and keep a running portfolio of options
Table Smirk
Maybe the NIO mooning begins at 7 PM EST? Can't believe MMs are keeping such a highly volatile stock almost dead AH
BABA beginning its completely meaningless nightly creep up.
My money is on JWN buying Macys.
Zoom allowing free video conferencing for families on thanksgiving when everyone can already do this on FB where they already have all their family connected for free with no limits
Good question. I think they sell it on the market 15 minutes before close.


If you don’t have enough buying power to exercise your option, we’ll typically attempt to sell the contract in the market for you about 1 hour before it expires.


So one hour before close.

If we ever return to “normal”
Correct, if you're using something like Google Authenticator instead, they need direct access to your phone or possibly the backups.  Text and email 2FA aren't as secure.  A lot of times you end up being able to reset a password via the email account, while at the same time being able to complete a 2FA challenge using the same email account, which means it really isn't full 2FA at all because all you need to do is compromise the email account.  It stops the person who has your password, but it doesn't stop the person who can access your email account.
He said IF you can turn 1k to 10k
Is it pretty safe to assume SPY is gonna open up like $5 lower tomorrow morning? Asking for a friend. ...A very gay friend.
Damn and i straddled the stock last minute thinking they report tomorrow oof
2 is too many, just choose 1
Jesus!
Set your exit price(s) before opening a position
They let LK fail, I have been a NIO bull but the same thing can happen. Don't get cocky.
also i said 2010s u retard lmfao
As of right now, it’s down 84 cents. That’s not too bad considering the expectations built into the earnings. 

NIO will eventually run to the 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
Anyone playing Jan 21 defense for possible last power grab loophole?
The call to discuss the earnings with shareholders is at 7pm est. the results are out
at least we are seeing some real money
Loss  porn
can u explain to me how u made money and how much u made, im an old school stock player  I just do the regular buy low sell high play. But right now I'm learning about options. I might never do them but I want to understand them maybe one day ill see if I can do one but not right now.

How much did u make out of these. And are all these options for 100 shares
How....how are you negative?

Sell some calls bruh

You're as straight as me putting 'Straight' on my Grindr profile

Yes market acting like covid will be cured and we'll be back to normal this spring.
Nope. It’ll come down soon.

There's a difference between the stock failing and the company failing. 

NIO could complete crater and then take all of the investors money, and then one week later this exciting new Chinese company called NIO2 could somehow emerge with all of the same products and assets of the original company. All of the previous investors would have no recourse.
give me calls for my 1k then. i smell bullshit

Along with vaccine news lifting pretty much anything that sank in the past 6 months back to late Feb / early March price, I'm very bullish on it and expect to be cashing out around $8.50-$8.75. 

...and I was pissed I sold my Macy's $7.50c at $8 early morning when I set myself a $8.50 price target. 

So Im kind of playing on tilt in poker terms.
If I were you I’d make it 69% PLTR and 42.0% NIO. Who said retards can’t be good at math

It keeps getting propped up by Vaccine pumps. It was dying after the Pfizer pump almost right away then caught steam again, like clock work, with the Moderna shit. It's fucking up my puts on Boomer stocks.

Wait so when did NIO report earnings? Im actually confused?
Just sold my $3 11/20 calls today at the close. Made a 200% return. Still holding some shares.
I think Fisker is the next big play, I’m getting in hard tomorrow morning.

Better then losing your life savings that you worked for your entire life. That feeling is a good thing. Just don't be a retard next time.
The short answer is everyone needs insurance. Pullbacks will result in higher premiums, and the book will always, inevitably, grow. In theory.

This dude sounds like a crazy person on his interviews on Bloomberg. Obviously, he's a Republican.
And that still isn’t the worst price cuz it will probably keep rising, but it’s the fact the he’s bitching for it to go up more immediately after it already ran 10% today. I mean yeah it will probably keep going tomorrow but what do you expect right now haha
Well no shit
Sorry, but you gotta get PLTR to 69.42(0)
agreed. thats probably the safest and best play. but what do i know

The music, too. Never felt more anxious watching a movie.
no, its legit

When did you buy?
Saw an old guy driving one in the stop and shop parking lot last week. Thing was sickkk

If you can I’d look at late 2021 or early 2022 options about 30-50% OTM for both. That of course comes down to if you can afford it. I genuinely believe both are good choices. If you zoom out on Penn you’ll say “well it’s almost already at it’s ATH” and it’s true there’s been a big run up. 

But I think both are good. If I had one option it would be DKNG as they are purposely spending money to beat out their competition and while their earnings are still negative their ad costs are a big part of that. They are betting on the future. I genuinely think they’ll be successful.
Brah the irony would be richer than all meme stocks combined if republicans lost their senate majority due to coronavirus.

Nice. Do it again and you'll have yourself 250k. I told myself if I hit 10k I would pull 5k out but who knows, probably would have still lost it all, lol.

Thanks brother
Lmao the NIO bears shit the fuck up real fast, well the smart ones who can understand trends at least. Don’t bet against a super Tesla in a country with a government and business model that won’t let it fail
because everyone is saying this it'll open like 0.4% down and then moon to 55 before lunch
If you don’t think that was beginner mode, you obviously weren’t here in Expert Mode September or Legendary Mode March... 😂
It's down 6% afterhours if that helps
Drill team 6
Great job man. that’s not little! Risked 3k!
Enjoy the free car man!
Timing be a hard thing, youre always going to lose in hindsight just the way it is. Enjoy the win.
Prized in. NCLH crashed by about 7% on the day, when CCL issued new shares several days/weeks ago.
I made this thread a while back, and a lot of the comments are from people more knowledgeable with condors than i am. [This comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/jerih5/what_deltas_do_you_you_normally_set_your_condors/g9ggmr2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) in particular explains it really well. I recommend reading some of the other stuff on there too
Sure. Do you have a link for the discord?
I told my brother about my gains one time and proceeded to lose a lot of trades the next 2 months. Since then I refuse to divulge numbers.

I can report things too, doesn’t mean they hold any weight.
BA is going back to 300 sir. Jump back in slowly.
It was down 8% after the release, and is still down 2% now.  Not sure glowing statements on a conference call will be enough...
its barely down...
Only the super rare LPs imo. Same with Gallardo LPs
Ill add that i would watch the IV then... MM like to get directional on their spreads to trap people into bullshit midpoints so that can fuck your stops too
What are you talking about retard? It was up over 10% today

I think typically this type of problem occurs when you invest a large proportion of your capital and/or when you invest in options that are expiring in the very near term.

And because of that, every single move makes you feel uncomfortable. If these positions were only worth 10% of your capital you would not hesitate to hold them, that is assuming if you believed that was a smart move to begin with.
SENATOR GRASSLEY TESTS POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS - CNBC

He is 87.
makes sense. i read somewhere that if you think Nio is going to dip to buy more shares than you literally have shit for brains
This vaccine will be 6 months from release before anything is "back to normal".  Market is forward thinking sure but it also relies on quarterly earnings, fixed costs, etc.  The vaccine doesn't mean shit yet.
this is exactly why OP is a little bear bitch
Thanks for clearing that up sir

It's shares you fucking moron relax.
profit is profit man, I had 2095 shares of NIO and sold them at 15 for a 20K gain :), we are in a casino, chill out
Good play bro
Two weeks ago it was over 3300 :(

It was up 1% today then dropped on that eod dump timed with the iraq news.   Hoping people sell back out of cruises and get into tech with covid rising for the foreseeable future. 


But I'm sure we'll get more vaccine news Monday killing any gains this week and I'll get proper fucked on my put credit spreads

soooo about PLTR... is this shit gunna go up or what cuz like i bought calls cuz of u retards
Give it a moment, the death struggle is different for all
Wait, what's the difference between stock and etf?
give me a reason to care
Why did I buys $TSLA at open? Doh!!!
OSTK pullin' up on Dat Azz...
You mean tell the truth? Stop it
Google only did search engine, till they did everything else.  That's how tech works.  You have a base of selling data analysis to the surveillance state, then with that revenue you can adjust your tools to commercial problems.
I havent been on WSB for a while. I had an itch today and after 5 minutes of browsing I bought 10 shares of TSLA ($439.50) and 120 shares of PLTR ($17.95)
Loaded up half my portfolio with 25c1/22s at 14. Wish I had heard sooner. Can't really afford to buy anymore unless they add 35c and up
Want DKNG to go full metal meme mode... need it for these 55 and 60 calls
How is anyone not buying BNTX 11/27 90c at this price? Lower than pre-vaccine and Emergency Use Authorization coming anytime... literally free tendies
People don’t read good. Wait till they actually put 40,000,000 new shares for sale though
YOLO on SOLO 🚀
Agreed but no gay
strike & exp pls
If it’s not IV crush then you’ll get V crush
I was down over 80% on TSLA, definitely a complete lotto. I had a feeling something fun would happen this week and that’s why I didn’t cut my losses. I thought it would be tied to the SpaceX launch, never imagined the S&P news 😂 🤷🏻‍♂️ Good to get a break every now and then

I also use DocuSign, and all the people we sell products to are familiar with DocuSign

Well after realizing that in the next few months covid might be out the window  and that a new economic stock boom will come. I decided to allocate 50% of my portfolio  into well known brands that have fallen into single digits. I already have 3 in mind. 1)Macy's  2) usio 3) naked brands

Most of them have gone  very dry low and I know once covid vaccine is gone these stocks may not boom right away but within 1 year after everyone is working again they will grow back  at least 20% to 50% of their market before covid came.

I'm open to anyone with company names that you are sure to boom after Pfizer vaccine is released. They are about to ask the fda to go ahead this is about to get real.

Remember what happened to PayPal week of election? It barely beat eps and got crushed then two days later it mooned. If you look at eps actuals vs estimate NIO beat estimate by way more than PayPal did. Yes not apples to oranges but gives us perspective.

Save the small businesses by taxing corporations fairly and incentivizing entrepreneurs. Get your city’s government to incentivize small businesses over corporations. If you think a stagnant minimum wage is going to save your local burger joint in the long run you are straight up KIDDING yourself big guy.

Tomorrow morning NCHL probably -20%. Hopefully they drag CCL down with them like -10%
That’s why I buy shares and don’t buy options which is basically just gambling
What if Nio goes something like "Uh yeah we didn't track how many cars we sold so we just made some numbers up"
I pussed out on my call credit and rolled it up a couple strikes \*sigh\* whatevs.
Breakout Year... Make money.
It’s already mostly priced in. There was already funds adding it when everyone thought is was being added in August. Now there’s like 35 days til inclusion which is unheard of so funds can slowly add it in without getting totally raped. If they announced Monday and said it will be included by Friday then yeah it would be like 550 right now

I mean that is kinda how it works. Risk management limits losses doesn't give you maximum upside. Maximum upside is when you YOLO into FDs and it works out. Thing is you keep YOLOing into FDs eventually it'll turn against you.

Think  about it, if you had 40k and just do 4% OTM put credit spreads on AMZN weekly, you'd make ~4.5k-5k each week. Sure one trade will wipe you out, but you only need to do this 8 weeks to make 100%.

You notice how when you buy a call or put, RH uses emojis and exciting sentiment in their notifications. But when you withdraw money, they show no such emotions. They love it when you place bets and lose all your money, but not when you take winnings. Scumbags.

thank you, this was a great answer. i will keep it mind
This is late stage capitalism baby. Corporations will win whether we raise wages or not, all you’re doing is creating shittier lives for the lowliest workers to postpone the inevitable.

I'm pretty sure Palantir caters to any business model that utilises a shit ton of data. In this day an age, that's mostly all big companies from car makers to oil companies to assisting countries with Covid19 tracing to future disease management etc etc... Palantir is just getting started on their commercial side. I'm confident in the company.
I don’t know if it’s gunna happen in the next few days unfortunately
Confused too, especially after the craziness last time there was rumored sp 500 inclusion. And the absolute insanity when there was a stock split.
Aw shit here we go again
So 2 gop senators magically get covid and have to quarantine so they can’t vote and Shelton doesn’t get nominated. This is a legit clown world

Just watch NIO after 7
Good dd
For sure. Thoughts and prayers amigo
Can anyone explain TSLA today? How was it so flat after the initial profit taking? Is S&P 500 inclusion not a big deal?
Pump and dump
Is Zack Morris legit? I honestly can’t tell
Those are going to print.
I’ll suck his dick
11/17?  Uh.....CCL closed at $18.05
Palantir caters to the groups that cater to the wide range of customers. Palantir supplies the top, is backed by the top, and is the top.
totally
The problem is shit does go down..but never when it’s logical or when you think it will happen so it’s just lucky timing if anything. They just feel like a waste of money, time and emotional energy.  Some trash stocks that should be in the gutter just keep banging up. Very frustrating.
My XLE leaps keep going up. Don't sleep on energy bitches, esp if Trump launches a strike on Iran, it would explode

AMZN was a big failure today. Bought calls near EOD and already down almost 10%. Hoping for a gap up tmr
I thought that would be the case and am down 5.6K or (50%)on 440 and 450 weekly calls...

I hope it moves to 470 -480 atleast tomorrow.

Looks like they limit the scope of the rule:

That money was in there much longer than 2 months. Mid-summer was when I scaled up quite a bit and started trading on margin.

Solid point. Puts on BABA it is.
Imagine acting like nio hasn’t held strength at higher lows for the last like 6 months 🤦‍♂️
ICLN my garage next
I saw that too.  Not much volume being traded from what little DD I put into it.  that's as far as I got

I don’t understand what you means by got shoot. Is that a joke or a real story?
Agreed. Fuck this guy. Also u/perpendosi how many fuckin shares do you have jfc
I exercised an option because I wanted to start selling weekly OTM options.  But I'll have to sell the others because I can't afford to exercise them all.
Exactly
It dipped 20 cents AH. Time to dip? 😐

Dang. Well it held up relatively well today. Maybe itll happen.
Have you not seen the fundamentals for BIIB? It is a good stock.
My key indicator was checking this sub and seeing “$20 EOD”

I’m only down $264
I might be retarded but at least I don’t pretend to know what I’m talking about
Bruh we eating good tomorrow
Bruh obviously this is bullish, the 50% drop is less than the priced in drop
Vaccines? Lots of vaccines? Calls on BDX
playing with NVDA fire.
I'm surprised this sub isn't big into it.  EV American play, it's gaining momentum, just hired a VP, and they're highly speculative. If they meet their scaling goals could be huge.
Is it a relief knowing you haven't contributed to the fulfillment of 1984 as a prophecy?
After dumping 10s of Gs into NIO I looked up their cars. Ngl they're dope and I like them much better than Tesla ones. They are sharp and look masculine kinda like mustang
It is fake. Once they release the other 80% of shares see what happens. I’ll buy back in then. Anyone care to tell me why I’m wrong?
As someone who works in big three I can't tell you how big a 14.5% margin on a car is. Industry standard in NA is 5% margin for the entire auto industry.
Lmao if I cared about history I would read a textbook
You may not be able to shower, but at least you'll be able to sleep at night.
I guess that’s the trade off for the ease of use
A 100k plus honestly we are pretty much the same respkt lol
Ew
That's what market makers are for.
Okay. Thanks for the vid. This actually happened for me on my $MRNA calls. Except for mine, the IV crush happened after the vaccine came out. It was strange to see how the IV dropped to 70% and my option actually didnt make any money even when the stock rose approximately 10%. Still made money tho.
Thinking about starting a DOCU position for earnings... they are legit and e-signing ain’t going anywhere even after covid is gone
Won’t get better if you never play. Won’t get better at trading if you never expose yourself to the market

Wsb was dumb enough to donate money by grabbing Rkt options and Nio options before the earnings. Will it be retarded enough to do the same exact thing with NVDA and ZM? Tune in to find out.

What do y'all think is going to be the next $1000+ stock?
Yes, but from an investor's perspective, not large enough market potential. If you have a great product, but only sell to specific industries, you limit your potential.

Just keep it away from your dick
I was broke when I started. Now I’ve gone 100% on my initial investment and it feels like I don’t have anything significant, but still if I lose it all then I’ll just be broke again
Thats what im hoping for
Fucking bear, go back to your cave, we haven’t reached climax
Dude I rinse at the end. Not gonna lie it sucks. Especially since we have a dog and a roommate who never rinses out the tub when finished.
Great thing about trading options at work is that you only risk what you earned at work for the day. That way you never actually lose money.
What happened to all tsla yolo?
i think some ppl went for lunch and just forgot about it
Dude i just saw this wtf happened with riot it was dicking around at $3-$4 range forever. Happy for you brother!
To be honest it's not a terrible idea.  You can get Nov 27 160c for 8 bucks or the one you got for 15 pretty low risk for a big shot.
Tesla? Sounds like an American NIO
They’re focusing too much on having a racially and sexually diverse cast and not enough on actual trading.

I’d rather watch a show about somebody who loses a ton of money trading goes crazy and becomes a serial killer
Well the ticker is front and center in the image. Can't imagine how you missed it.
Anyway, made money. Lost it too. Should've had a sell order in for open... Didn't and fucking rode that shit down until I dumped in disgust in the 440s. Jesus. Missed 20k.
Carry on autist soldier!
I hope so. I hate travelling.
8 calls deep, it’s gotta do them overnight pump magic
Tesla needs to be near 470-480 🙏🙏
Don’t forget BABA!
Quantum will trade under $QS. KCAC is the Kensington capital they are coming to market under... supposedly... NOV 25 vote I believe
remember when people were snatching up BABA 330 calls ahahahahaha
Soros regret buying PLTR

That is not called a naked option retard. 

Literally just Google what a naked option is.
Yea get the fuck out of our nio
You do know that I can sell them at different times, right? So if it goes down then goes back up the next day (as it's done numerous times) I can make a profit off both. But okay, I'll let you know when I make money and don't lose any lol
NIO 4Q revenue guidance 6.26B to 6.44B yuan, beats Bloomberg consensus estimates of 5.42B yuan (range 5.19B to 5.78B yuan)
Logitech is the only company I know recently that went up after earnings. Nio will be the next.
-£12, "tanking" come on bro. This is pussy shit. Get those fucking CFDs cranked up and get leveraged before you post.
Robinhood lets you withdraw without the funds settling?
I don’t really think you know where you’re at right now. We are past the disinformation stage, is that somewhere on your chart?
lol. Literally dude there's about to be the equivalent of a 30% buyback on the stock. Lots of people just taking their profits, stock is 500 EOY easy

Yup
Holding for half a year or selling at loss
Yea think i'm going to have to sell my shares
TBH I'm in it long-term, but calls on any red day are usually a good idea. They keep getting dumped in the morning and bounce back throughout the day.
Who are we looking at for Biden’s multibillion dollar clean energy investment plan? What companies are on the radar?
Is everyone here having a great day? It is a great day to be in this market. We are all blessed. Have a great week!

Unless NIO comes up with a vaccine tonight or go full Trevor Milton, I don't see how the fds i sold would be itm by tomorrow morning
Many times. Not really in that much debt tho (yet), so fuck you.
And that’s why they won’t 🙂
That movie gave me so much anxiety with all that yelling. 6/10
The only people who wouldn’t raise prices are corporations like McDonald’s. Small businesses can’t cope hiring a cashier for $15 an hour for people who already barely go in the store
This guy gets it. Sharpe ratings are overrated.

I completely missed the email for an operations intern interview with Palantir 8 years ago. Now I don’t have a shower just a tub AMA
Yep and this is giving me Nam flashbacks to that event
Anyone have the zoom info for the NIO earnings report? Would like to know in advance if I'll be eating at Wendy's tomorrow or sucking dick behind it.
Ask that ControlTheNarrative guy.
Ohhh looking again I can see it’s sorted by net profit and those are individual days with number of trades per day. Hundreds of trades per day during the volatile days, crazy!
Highly doubtful that it even drops below 40. Ever again 😂
Well frendos I cracked $300k this year. Back in 2015 all I had was $300 to my name and $80k in debt. Most thanks to Tesla, bought at $180 pre split and it catapulted my journey to being an prick that don’t take shit from da man no mo
Dis happened today bro
😂
You’re right it is about the fund, but there’s some murmurs of him bringing it up during the call.
so how many of yall holding NIO call weelies?
Can you believe I got into NIO at $3 and sold it at $7........

Like it was still more than 100% return but if I held on... damn...
This TWTR dip looking like a SNACK
WDAY has been a great earnings play the past two quarters. I won’t being going in this round, but it is tempting me

End of earnings season means we drill. Monthly Options expire Friday. Last two earnings seasons this exact thing happened
I love you

Any of you retards trade notes over bonds futures pairs?
It’s ok they get to buy the cheap shares in the offering tomorrow lol

It's up bigly today. How is it any more suck than the other meme stocks here?
So we just let inflation happen anyway while the poorest get effectively poorer?

When pltr started going up today. What were the key indicators that it’s not fake ? Or did you all just gambled for it to keep going up ?
Brush the poop I am going do on you with it

Tsla 469 tomorrow would be swell.
That’s my guess feb 2020

Products?
Damn. 140 sounds alright. I was gonna buy 125s.
[deleted]
im not at a huge loss regaurdless but I was up $600 today and decided to hold, I'll be out about $400 of LI and NIO calls tomorrow if this shit keeps up. But I think its just short manipulation after hours, I think we could see it hit 50 tomorrow pre-market.
Yeah and that’s if you think $22 is the right price. It seemed ridiculous it was at $22 to me today

If you assume it was worth $20 then fair value would become $16.7

So yeah maybe $17-18
No worries, I'll buy some calls tomorrow and reverse the whole market
Who doesn't like a BJ?
That’s why we have the SEC in the USA. Forward looking statements are not necessarily lies.
Imagine how many lives will change if NIO, TSLA, and PLTR gap up overnight.
Yeah but I play about as good as I pick options trades
Not exactly. Increased consumer spending mitigates the issue a bit.
Yea and IV will probably be lower on AMD. Although I guess it will probably move less than NVDA, but it should be correlated.
yes
Don't celebrate on Tuesday nights unless you closed your position already
If I keep up weeks like these I will lol
Yeah damn that 4 dollar difference at closing. 

That NIO is a fortune.
[deleted]
Make them pay their taxes. It’s not a hard concept. Raising the prices on everything to accommodate people working shitty jobs isn’t gonna solve the problem but make more people poor so the poor people don’t feel so alone
Why 185?
Women don’t cheat dude. They don’t poop either is all lies
I can’t even get pass the intro
Sounds like I'm getting more kong and entering penn tomorrow. I grabbed 75c Feb for kong a couple days ago for cheap. Any other strikes?
Yeah I sold some retarded options like 25p and 65c and they were rather expensive. I think I will go with lamb
I sold my 27p 12/18 20 minutes before that fucking sell off because I was worried NIO might actually do good.
Only on this sub you'd get a gold after asking
Been on r/frugal for 6 years now. Saved me millions on toast.
and that's just to barely lose money or break even lol
I bought tickets to the moon is this the right seat

I think you're doing it wrong.
I love when people compare NIO to NKLA or Luckin, shows they're idiots who don't do any research.

I thought that for yday! 😇

Probably for the best. Price of an education. At least it was just a Summer job making minimum wage. The time will come when you make that in a week or two if you put effort into your future.
Does it have multiple settings?  Seeing as 75% of electric toothbrushes are used for "other" reasons besides cleaning teeth... something tells me an AI toothbrush can't tell when a woman is satisfied.
I’ll do the math for you. 

Those 65c FDs you bought expiring Friday are expiring tomorrow morning lol.
Eh.. I think it's about equal

AH goes until 8
Real economics talk: Based on the areas in which it’s happened, the increased consumer spending mitigates some of the inflation. You do get some, but it’s not like a 1:1 trade off. Turns about when everyone gets more money people who don’t raise prices to compensate get more business and don’t always need to raise prices to match the increased cost of overhead.
 🤡
buy pltr
What kind of gay fucking shit did I just watch?
Im thinking about takin a loss now and sell.
Anyone go actually fully broke doing this shit?
If you want to actively trade it or be active with the shares I would sell them. I'm in for 500 shares and two ITM leaps for 2023 and I'm going to do nothing with them for a long time.
$3.29 for me XDXDXD
Could play AMD as a poor mans sympathy play on NVDA
Maybe.  We have the rest of the week of it to crumble down. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I'm up 400% on calls but didn't believe in it enough so I had only bought 1 for $1.61 last month 🙃
The meme strength is the same, and the over inflated hype is still there. Not saying it’ll drop that much but another 5-10% isn’t all that far fetched. Just my 2 cents from experience
Sell em before its too late
ZM has done nothing all week. Like a 1% range
Nice
The only thing I’m scared about is potential new shares issuance announcement on the nio call
IV crushed. you ded also rofl.
Perfectly fine, my options expire before then 😁
Same. Loading up on a few more in the morning
Palantir only caters to certain customers, limiting the potential revenue of its products. It is the only reason I did not invest. I am aware of their products.
But. Why? Just cuz it’s been in a consolidation? The announcement should been in like 2 weeks. But you had 11/20s. Fuck you congrats man.
What calls do you buy? Like $2-3 above current price?
The soundtrack of my options expiring worthless: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8x4m-qpmJ8&ab\_channel=FeiYu-ching-Topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8x4m-qpmJ8&ab_channel=FeiYu-ching-Topic)
You are cucked
Same here, holding $500c that are -73%
Dear wsb, thanks for donating close to 2k worth of premium by buying my naked NIO and TSLA options that will expire worthless. Should I make prime rib or leg of lamb roast for dinner tomorrow 🤔 😋
[deleted]
Oh yeah. That $230 ticket plus points plus insurance and the bullshit stuff they tack on. I don't practice anymore but cops on certian areas love doing this:

Speeding 

And they tack on

Unsafe driving and a few other ancillary stuff.

So now you're looking at a lot of points and you end up pleading down to speeding and take some points and a fine. The fine alone is usually loaded with some bullshit safety fee and some other random costs and it's now like $500, but hey at least you don't like 8 points.

Fucking racket. Goddamn fucking racket
BJ calls? Sounds like a regular Tuesday
Be aware of the share lockdown period expiring when choosing a date
Great
Level 2 circuits breaker tomorrow, got it.
At least I won’t have to pay capital gains tax this year, also have capital loss tax to carry over for the rest of my lifetime at 3000 a year
That was a painful day. The worst part about is RKT having a great ER, still tanked.
Chances the NIO conference call sounds like the H1Z1 lobby?
To stop flooding this chat about NIO

... I’m even a NIO bag holder but fuck
Roger that. I stick to pretty liquid stocks with a tight spread. Primary leaps.
Ready to let him move into the room. Wife says she needs space so im taking the couch
Oh i know i did......used it to buy Nike, Walmart and Starbucks.....might actually get back in Nio now that we’re post earnings.....$666 million just seems fishy so in all sincerity, good luck to people buying now.....which might be me soon 😬🙃
how did you get in at the top, shit mooned to 26 these days
Are you holding?
Fuckoff this world idea
But when will they announce?
Free on Netflix
I’m talking about the one that they are currently selling. That shit has to pass FAA approval first.
Went all in today on PLTR, moved out of nio before it dipped near eod today
[deleted]
Calls on SCVL. Since y’all love playing ER so much.
[deleted]
we fucked up
ZM and CRM were 2 stonks that absolutely mooooned on ER last quarter. Nothing has changed for them except they are waaay cheaper than they were. ZM beat by something ridiculous like 400%, CRM had its first 5 billion quarter. I would maybe look for these to report well and will do well UNLESS THERE IS GOOD VACCINE NEWS.
I don’t get a wage I make commissions and residuals
 No positions?
Both cause you'll probably win on both legs of the strangle lol
Can I be real for a minute? I grew up pretty broke and I wasn’t popular early teens. I started doing some jobs buying fresh clothes, I had money I had friends, I had respect. I walked my neighborhood like I owned it. I’ll never forget that line he had though. “Niggas see you in the street pretend to be friendly, but I know any type of success breeds envy, I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hit me.” Truest shit I ever heard as I realized majority of people around me just want to rob me.
You think we are interested
Why are all these children watching my pregnant Elsa videos?
The faster they fall, the higher they bounce 🚀 🌙
Then PLTR to crash to the center of the earth when Soros and employees dump their shares in February.
Buy calls in Garden Sheds.

Win win.
I've been doing my own reading on this, it's not made a single vehicle for anyone and is built up on $250 pre orders for the vehicle. They have 10,000 but it's not due to be shipped for 2 years.
Very few good earnings left this week. Nvidia obviously is the biggest one left. Other than that, it's a bunch of random names like Workday, BJ, and Foot Locker.
not a great movie tbh

safdie brothers made another one called Good Time and it's awesome. it's even got the guy that from "i'm the captain now" in it
Women cheat more than men but are more secretive about it.

Change my mind.
Ban if not
They used to be retarded back then
Realistically? 22. With continued retard strength? Fuck it, 30.
any mandarin speakers here? need live transcript of nio call
Deferred means paid I think.
Daytrading is the only way now. Won’t be buying anything unless I can day trade and set a 10% stop loss

Be like king solomon and tell them you will cut the cans in half - if one of them says "No, don't, let him/her have the cans" give it to that person because they care about the cans the most.
Last time was so disappointing tho, all teeth. 2 quarters ago shit was nice with that 20% move within a week
I was gonna sell at 49.3 but I had a fuckin zoom call for my work. Couldn’t sell it. Literally after like a minute shit crashed.
Gotcha thank you
Bad idea. Pltr prediction is 18 which already happened. Take care. Watch PBI
How is dating a single mom different than being a cuck
Going to be so fun seeing PLTR 20 tomorrow
Can I tweet from this toothbrush?
Limit down?
Any advice on being better at options buying? I'm trying to regain the confidence to get back into calls after getting my ass kicked in September
Listen up you fucking retards,

I see a lot of fucking whiney ass gay bears here saying that all of us NIO dorks are going to get fucked over by IV Crush in the morning. They sit there sulking in their sorrows for having not boarded this fucking rocket ship. Well tickets are sold out cucks. We're on our way to tendie town and we're not stopping to pick anyone else up. 

A lot of these pompous, self righteous mother fuckers feign superiority as if we have no idea what is about to hit us. That may very well be true but I have a feeling they know just about as much as we do, which is dick all. 

Here is a video explaining what IV Crush is. You're probably not fucked unless you have way OTM calls that expire tomorrow. Either way you were fucked so I'm not really sure why it's relevant. Your gains might not be as big as you thought, they might even end up negative regardless of upward stock price movement. Or you might fucking retire tomorrow. It kinda just depends.

Anyway I don't know anything but I can post videos of people who do know what they're talking about. So see if you fucking degenerates can get through half of it and learn something.
Should have bought NIO
This is not r/wholesomewallstreetbets
Still better than white trash drivers with trailer park RV's.
sorry but we’re in the smart money phase rn
Leave 5% for your wife’s bf? Yolo that shit on GME !
Should pray it goes down so you can get better position for leaps.
Umm sweaty this is racist xenophobic and problematic as phoque
Lmao as if elon lying on Twitter and at press conferences to boost share price is any different. All that matters is a headline and memes.

Yea I gotta believe that this might be one of the best moves out of all the stocks that are shilled here. They’ve spent so much money on advertising, partnerships and are trying to beat out of Fanduel. 

For everyone’s sake hopefully we start seeing distribution of a COVID vaccine in Q2 next year and the world returns back to somewhat of a new normal we’ll go back to regularly scheduled sports. 

DKNG holds roughly 55-60% on US fantasy sports and the merger w/ SBTech seemed smart through the DEAC SPAQ.

Additionally, so many states are pushing for legislation on new gambling laws and DKNG, PENN & MGM are pushing a ton of money into this space. 

PENN could be a real winner too IMO. I’m 30 years old and still listen to Barstool Sports and most of my younger coworkers 22-25 are huge Barstool Sports fans. Their 36% stake in Barstool and the Barstool Bet app could be a favorable move for Millennials + GenY/GenZ. 

I’m long on both DKNG & PENN
can't tell if you're being sarcastic not because of the internet but because im autistic
Aapl is below September highs. Nasdaq is as well. Up 42% on the year.

Big tech is a good hold but a bad buy rn
Its gonna meme like SPCE did in Jan/Feb
You belong in /r/PersonalFinance lol
Call me when they come up with self driving toothbrushes
me and my calls believe you TSLA 460c 12/18
Just remember: the former will allow you to do the latter only instead of it being by yourself, you could do it in front of those three escorts you paid to be with you for the day
Racist as fuck but I laughed anyway
i don't see color...only retards
Depends on the stock and the spread of the Bid / Ask
NI0 30p 12/4 ;)
Does the Money Glitch update include the green feature on RH?
Nio is FUD.
One day everyone will realize those Elsagate videos were turning them into commies through mk ultra but anyways back to nio
The show is pretty popular, IK a lot of people who don’t watch anime know who she is.

That graph can't stop me because I can't read

You’ll be up more tommorow
What do you expect him to say xD Ye imma sell that shit is so over valued 💯💯‼‼?
I did this today
In plain words it’s called BTFDF
I think I will collect about 1k with nio premium and 2k from tsla. As a theta gangsta I hope they come up with triple leveraged ev index so I can sell all the fds.
Fuck. You’re right..

Europe, world, whatever. You know what I mean
Pfizer vaccine being approved for emergency use, Pfizer about to print vaccines faster than jpow can print bills.
They make powertrains for class 8 commercial vehicles. They currently have a hybrid solution that can be installed in any semi-trucks, best current solution in the market. In mid-late 2021 they will roll out the fully electric Hypertruck ERX, which uses renewable natural gas and is expected to be the best in terms of cutting cost and being negative carbon emissions. Their only real competition for the hypertruck ERX is TSLA and NKLA for those that still believe in it. Massive growth is expected in 2022.
My DD: What if Nio starts going back up tomorrow. There might be no need to sell weekly calls that already crushed in the morning.

I work for a fortune company and we travelled 100% of time. They realized we can work from home perfectly and simply cut the travels even with an upcoming vaccine. HOWEVER. I heard Asia only make deals with handshakes.
My account remembers. I lost so much money in being stupid. I was really conservative, getting profits little by little 10% weekly. I saw so much gain porn, and I decided to go with the flow, Oh well,,,,, I went all in at the top.

PLTR to have gone to Mars
Meh.  If it does it does.  I made $11k just today.  I'm pretty happy with that.
Multiple reports are saying that the FAA is close to recertifying the 737Max for flying (like possibly this week).
Yeah I know.. I meant to buy calls
Not sure but it’s a solid chunk of dilution lol 😝
I don't really care which way we go but I hope it's big one way at open.
Or he is luck in coffee and many other Chinese companies that cook their numbers and get dummies to invest at crazy high levels??

UNCUT GEMS NOW 5.99 AT AMAZON AND BEST BUY!!!! Lmao
Man I'm a nio bull but I still wasn't retarded enough to hold through earnings.
I sold naked strangles. Should I get prime rib or leg of lamb roast tomorrow  🤔
Just wait for ticker change, Chargepoint will rocket to $40
You sold at 25? basically same thing, hating on the stock since it mooned far past your selling price. Thanks for the good luck, I doubt you mean it though 

You made some insane returns on a fucking stock, don't forget that. Not many get this lucky
That has nothing to do with options that are implying a ginormous move getting crushed because the stock only moved 5% or whatever it does.

Been waiting on my deposit.

Is there any chance NIO goes up tomorrow....?
PSTH anyone?
If this comment gets 420 likes and 69 comments tesla will reach $420.69
or tiddies?
Bears, tomorrow is Wednesday which means green. Dump scheduled for Thursday.
Heard it’s a doozy
I mean the numbers are already out. Unless Chinese Elon Musk goes on there and waves a magic wand around it seems everyone who did yeet calls and puts is gonna go bankrupt
14% apparently. I also bought CCL puts today fml
I got lucky and was able to sell my calls at the very top , the dip was expected you always sell the news.
NIO isn’t RKT at all though
Something big is gonna go down with this nio earnings call. Its 90 minutes so theres a 30 minute period when trading will stop after hours...
So how would you bring back the middle class when the ultra rich won’t pay their taxes (Donnie) and the poor just fucken riots and steal shit anyways? It’s not as easy as you think.
Oh shit! He does owe me my allowance for the week soon!
That’s what I’m thinking and then shooting up to like $52 Friday or next week after WSB is broke (including me)
+8%

You don't?
Am I a weeb if I know the show it’s referencing?
It caused rite aid to drop 15% today, when mail order pharmacies already exist and you can’t get covid vaccines from a computer screen. Bought a ton of calls.
If it wasn’t for these vaccines and your NIO calls you probably could have
Gates the OG Gay Bear, sells so much boomer stock every year
adam corolla said something similar recently. if you're super rich and u get a speeding ticket...no problem. homeless don't drive (never get a ticket). middle/lower class it's a big expense. the middle/lower class are the ones who carry the most burden, in other words
Pretty low odds to make you happy.

BUY CALLS ON $TOILET, TO THE MOOON BABYYY
I think options profit calc has an IV adjustment. Go there and adjust it back to 100 IV cuz that’s prolly where it’s going.
It's a data company
I got a year out leap so gunna try and diamond hand it least a couple days haha
That would be nice. Although they would probably expand on how they'll go into Europe, not the world. I'm out after they go beyond China. Highly doubt westerners would buy a car with a robotic interior camera from China. Shady AF.
Same! Lolol
Sell to open, probably the only move. Or buy ITM.
I sold at open and bought at close

Tesla ravaged my butt today
No, still neutral.
Already priced in
I mean if they're covered calls and you're deep green on the shares then meh that's fine

Selling naked calls on a meme stock is truly the path to bankruptcy though
Chief I’m late to the game. Mind linking me to the date/OI of these puts?
that’s actually kind of beautiful

what if nio just gasses earnings and says they didnt do the audit
I took out all the margin I could and it worked out, but it was scary getting a margin call on the dead cat bounce days. Schwab never sold off my puts tho.
Bullish
You sell puts.

I sold 55c so I smiled a bit..
20% percent trailing stop doesn’t seem like quite enough wiggle room. What’s the magic number?
I sold my puts at 240 IV today which was pure insanity
Yes is the correct answer
if not Im losing my fkn hope
Honestly though think of how many people spend their life savings based on comments here. Not even joking. The more people say this the higher it'll get.

So today, my 1/15/2022 10C were up 60% today alone. Took a bit of a hit at 3:00 to 3:30 but still up 37.5% as of right now. So I feel pretty decent. Might be a sell off in the morning because they had great news today of Permission to sell in the US. Name another Chinese EV that has that ability? NIO might announce plans to do such tonight on the CC but KNDI already is past announcement and can now do it. I can see them growing over time so im gonna hold these long calls and wait to it catch more on the artist radar to push it to the moon. Id say get in while they are still cheap.

The fact that NIO is only down $1 is promising as fuck
Brilliant, I was thinking the other day how I couldn't describe some of mine if someone asked me.

Democrats = the party for the lazy and entitled.
That’s a glaring sign to get into defi ASAP. Buy rhymes with tit coin. The fed keeps printing money, adding 3 trillion dollars to further inflate USD and they’re likely going to pass another stimulus bill to add another 2 trillion dollars out of their asses. Fuck the fed.
Lol priced in yea but that means this is the new entry point/floor. It’ll go up on average 20 per share every quarter
It'll go both ways, be quick
No big tech is no where close to being topped out. FANGMANT will always go up medium term. You can add AMD to that too.
I agree.  Hoping for $41 to $42.

I mean the earnings report ticks all the boxes everyone wanted. Beat revenue, beat EPS, lower margins, huge growth in deliveries, super positive Q4 guidance, etc.

But a lot of that was pretty much priced in given the crazy growth NIO has seen in the past month, so it's not really gonna moon from the ER, unlike Xpeng which no one really paid attention to prior to their ER.

95% of your portfolio? Jesus fuck. You may as well let it be 100% at that point. If it’s boring you’re doing something right it’s meant for passive income. Do you go party with tenants at your rental in Detroit for more excitement?
Oh boy, you better sit down for this one then...
The thing that boggles my mind is that bears can be wrong 95% of the time but still come out on one bad day spouting off like they are Nostradamus. It is healthy to hedge your portfolio with some puts here and there or to make directional bets when you see some obvious entry but perma bear?? I almost feel like they are just trolls because no one has enough money to be a bear since April, no one.
Because eventually the economy changes, or world circumstances change, and if you exploited this you suddenly get clapped in the ass and owe trillions instead of profiting trillions.

I think if people don't like the way the US Gov't does things, they have a couple of options:

* Stop paying taxes, don't fund the beast
* Move to another country that doesn't have the same problems
* Run for office and change things as a legislator
* Volunteer/Work at any number of law offices and orgs trying to help people with lesser means

I understand the OP's ethical confliction, but at the same time, the way the US Society works gives rise to companies that have kowtow to their customers to make enough money to effect positive change.  

That said, Palantir's pro-bono work is pretty impressive, reminds me of law-firms that are hired to defend sleezeballs, but also required to put in time and resources to picking pro-bono cases like for immigration and criminal defense.
Woah it’s almost like politicians didn’t think of that?! You don’t think they don’t know that? You think politicians believe were adding jobs? Politicians don’t care about what’s best they care about what works for voters. Apply yourself accordingly to their polices for good or bad. Want 15 minimum wage? Okay good do it my next move is to go as efficiently as possible and hire as little as possible.

Nio is going to stagnate until Friday evening and all you weeklies cuckholders will have to invest in rope. I heard they’re really cheap and unreliable on Baba.
I sold too. Cant be unhappy about gains

Sorry... refreshed the chart and saw that giant spike.... My Y-axis was fukt
Nah but wait for pull back
I wish I could upvote and downvote this at the same time.

this is an online concert, so it shouldnt be canceled, but this is uncharted territory for lil yachty indicators. we're not sure if this will be as strong as an indicator as album drops.

Sure hope so. I'll be able to sell off 1 or 2 of my 25c1/22s to pay taxes on my nio gains!
Lol good luck with that

Lol BA isn't selling any planes, with or without a vaccine. It'll go back up but it'll be slower than tech.
Agree.  But holding 1300 shares of MO gives you 4 fun days throughout the year.
Has BA topped?
Solid DD
hold it you are good. the TA says hold. it will be at minimum 41.39 by end of week
It's not about improving the quality of life, it's about getting underachievers more money for their booze and drugs.
Its a great move, but make sure to take out a loan and YOLO NIO so make up for that void in your heart
If it knows what's good for it it will...
Fair enough. I sold puts on high IV so I guess I'm in a similar boat.

Did see a few people posting their 35Ps and shit though which are just gonna get fucked.
Theta gang wins yet again. They stole your money with Nio FDs.
Sorry I was too tired to reply last night. This is exactly my thinking, though I did not know the technicals as I'm pretty new to investing, so thank you for that. Twitter is totally unique in its value and will not be replaced anytime soon. If anything, they are expanding their horizons since they offer a little bit of everything, like Facebook but more hip, and could replace other avenues of media once their user growth starts rising. Daily activity from active users has exploded recently with all the optimizations they have made, it's just a matter of time before their user growth naturally explodes IMO, people are using it for hours everyday. All this on top of the fact that they just acquired that new ad tech last quarter and already made huge gains for monetization, it's crazy to me how it sold off so much after the ER. This seems like it's exactly the beginning for them. Damn I wish I went all in at 28 earlier this year, I put $100k for leaps in at around $38 was up nearly 300% just before earnings and tanked right back to where I started now. Slowly starting to add more $80-100 Jan 22's to my position. Are you still holding?
after a day of having over 50% of my portfolio in pltr i finally found out what it was https://www.palantir.com/about/
You need to read into IV crush. It is seriously going to eat away like 75% of the option worth with no movement in either direction.

Of course they are. You’re just realizing that?
ATTN: CLUELESS RETARD

There is a conference call at 7 where they may announce global expansion, in which case it will moon
I’ll kiss you if you’re right
except nio actually makes their cars, they don't just draw pictures.
Tesla definitely has some first-mover advantage there and can also sell cars in China.  I just don't personally see the same level of velocity happening based on this particular set of financials.  I'm not knocking NIO I just don't see this moving significantly on this earnings report.  I think Theta gang wins this one.
Next thing you know, they acquire AMD for $1000/share.
guess up retard, you'll be right most of the time
Also no iv crush. Just the knowledge you didn't gain as much or lose as much as you could have.
you know it was random. but i chose tesla because its the stock that moves the craziest when news does break. just happened to be that lucky guy to be holding through the day. but i can thank WSB for this thinking . lost a lot of money before so it feels great to be back at the top
10k in play right now and I ended up down 35 cents today lol
Were you avle to sell? Otherwise you are going to have to exercise

Shhh they don’t think that far ahead
So whats the deal with BA bears? i mean, vaccine, recovery, stock still 64% from highs, what am i missing here
Sold at $48.80 and took my gains because we all knew this would happen post earnings.  I'll buy back in, in 2 days.
They beat earnings.  Tomorrow is going to be very green.

Alright after a year of this shit I’m finally going to stop making options 95% of my portfolio . I’m tired of blowing up these accounts but fuck, buying and holding stocks is so boring
Both are good medium term options
How anticlimactic is this NIO earnings

Can someone tell me I’m not retarded for holding 11/27 SNAP calls for 39.50 and 40? I keep fluctuating +15% and -20% throughout the day but ended today at -6%, which isn’t bad. Seems to be some strong resistance to dropping, although I did absolutely no dd and do not know why.
his area probably has really high property taxes. everyone else is the retard.  he's dancing.
i want to say you definitely knew about the inclusion lol
She’s literally more retarded that everyone on WSB.
IV gon give it to ya
There are other stocks besides Nio and Palantir 😂

Edit: Name 100% checks out
Thank you very much!
Tomorrow I just need egghead to announce an AMZN 8:1 split, Ma and Xi to appear on national TV holding hands, and NIO to shoot to 55.

If only 3 of these happen ill be happy.

PLTR: Agree there is a lot of hype(within this week). However, anyone who has worked with the software will tell you there Gotham remains without a worthy competition. Foundry has serious potential for commercial business application. Those with doubts are the ones who missed the 9-10 buy in.
Bars are for plebs, coffee shops are ace.

HYLN going to squeeze? Looks to be lining up nicely
That says A LOT.

Was up 250% after earnings drop so I'm mostly playing with house money. Still a loss.
Fuck you, I just bought in today. MOON NOW
Shutdowns ... = boredom .. = degeneracy ... = DKNG
Who knew nio was priced in except everyone

no way its gonna moon enough to offset IV lol, y'all need like 20%+ moves tmw

NIO will be green by 7:45pm
I can talk about HYLN all day. What do you want to talk about?
How would a $15 minimum wage build back the middle class if every other salary stays the same yet cost of all goods go up and the skill level of those salaries go down?
They aren't just earning less, they're losing money... bleeding cash, pricing below marginal costs just to get flow, and meanwhile the big boys are leveraged to the sun. Defaults don't seem impossible especially for AAL. When this is over there's probably going to be some upheaval to established markets and price wars will breakout.

Hello everyone, how is everybody doing?
All that excitement for NIO to end up right where it closed yesterday
[Welcome to the club buddy](https://youtu.be/jYmn3Gwn3oI)
Stay at home plays worked all summer and much easier to spot. Anything involving a computer wins
Sounds like someone just learned what IV crush is and is real proud of it.

Good idea to buy a shit tonne of ROKU, SQ, CRSR and TSLA because Cathy Woods bought it?
ATTN: RETARD

If NIO moons high enough it will offset IV crush
He wants to make a non-profit public option that people can choose to buy into, basically optional Medicare. Could be good if it happens but if republicans have the senate they’ll never even let the bill come up for a vote.
Or just more puts?
it IS a really weird shape.
Sweet bro, I basically did the same today with 14x 18c 11/20. Sold em near the top and bought shares and leaps. Made a few k
Because real gay bears sell calls or credit spreads on high IV
long term Im bullish but they were up so much I couldn't resist selling them
Nobody tell him
With the 244% IV today it will have to move alot

NIO can still moon before open tomorrow
Why is draft kings pumping
Scalpers everywhere. Some dude on Facebook was selling it for 1.2K. No thank you, I can wait a year.
I have no proof. I made my nio money and got out. I don’t necessarily think they are committing fraud either.

That being said I’m not going to bag hold knowing that there isn’t a disincentive to commit fraud.  I’ve been doing this a while and I’ve seen plenty of pump and dump Chinese ADR’s burn people.
Because tonight is a waxing crescent moon and that is always eerie signs for EV stocks
Definitely
How come no one is talking about HYLN?
I have insider knowledge that states that $SPY will move from left to right tomorrow.
r/investing salivating right now
If that happened, my retarded $23 12/17 FD would be in the money and I would probably have to call out of work due to viagra like symptoms

I would cum
Lol everyone does. I bought some TSLA debit spreads dated for Feb2021, I consider this a leap. It's not really, but I know I'm practically guaranteed to make about 150% profit in like 3 months so I'm happy
IF WE KEEP SAYING IT IT’LL BE REAL 🚀🚀
I just got one. It’s pretty cool. The main function I use it for is to be able to play music while I distance run without having to hold a giant iphone in my hands. But there’s some other dope functionality as well. Apple Pay and using the AirPods to talk to people thru cellular makes you feel like you’re in 2001 a space odyssey with how futuristic it feels. And the real time translator app has been a great ice breaker with people from overseas. Overall I def think it’s worth it. I never used my Fitbit but the Apple Watch is hard to take off
With vaccine news, noway it is going to be red. Sorry
People are waiting on the call expecting a factory. If not it'll tank

Sell
I like the logic. What strike/exp?

19th
NVDA earnings tomorrow after close.
I'm holding shares and calls (18c and 18.5c), we'll see if today's momentum will translate into a new wave of buying - I think that the hype/news over today's 11% jump may entice more people to hop in tomorrow, culminating in a Thurs/Fri sell-off. Total speculation, just a gut feeling

So you can also confirm the genius which is... the smart tooth brush es?!

when is that, ill need puta

Sorry bud the day game is over and real numbers came out. NIO looking really good
Charts look good. This is going to keep running tomorrow.

After that, I can't say for sure.

Everyone  shut up and talk about TSLA is it going to the moon or what???

but it's down 90 cents from close and still above open price. Maybe it will dump a lot more before tomorrow but I don't see a reason to panic.

I bought some $40 puts like 3 minutes before close and I regret it...
look at the past month, it's not happening. Every dip gets bought up. Every critical inflection point bounces positive. The triple top everyone was so worried about (I bought and lost a lot of money on puts betting on capitulation) was busted. Every rational fiber in my body says this market should be in the dumpster, but it's not and I'm learning that the key to success is to just go with the flow and accept that this market makes no sense what-so-ever
Am a dentist and can confirm this toothbrush does exist and is as stupid as it sounds.
because the coronavirus situation is getting better??🤣🤣
You're gonna lose it all by holding through earnings, aren't you?
Ill suck your dick guy

It's the play.  No stimmy, new lockdowns, vaccine months away from materializing into normalcy, current ATH based on nothing but hope, bad retail earnings, etc.

NIO flat as shit
Sold one of my BA 195c 11/27 for a 447c, not freaking out yet but bad trade
no. it’s not okay.
This money glitch was actually patched in the last update.
Whew 44:1.. you must have really ticked someone off

Why did you buy today if you weren’t confident in anything to drive it higher?
There is no god or covid
Or crashes
just curious, why BA? what happens if 737 news is good?
I’d be satisfied with -.6% open and slow bleed off

So family owns cheap rental properties, and my uncle is a baptist who doesn't believe in the coronavirus, and he recently entered into a tenant's house to snake their pipes and wasn't wearing a mask, and now that tenant might have covid, which means I may have covid cuz I see me uncle a lot. Basically, any YOLO calls since I may or may not die soon?
Thanks!

Jack to corsair, confirmed
It's up half a point from where it was at open.  This fight is far from over.  FDs might be fugged tho.
At least they should be set for the next year. Gotta get some deals coming through this winter and some more green energy hype the day after the election.
What do you think looks bearish about it
its about time..
Total revenues of NIO were $666.6 million USD... 

BAD VOODOO
This is a safe space. You are allowed to say the f word
50
You know there’s a CC at 7 right?
blnk dipped for no reason hahaha easy 5% scalp here.
Anyone saying PLTR is going to dip hard is a retard
Pick up its me
Yep
If the vaccine is gonna make everyone infertile and lose orgasms what do I invest in to take advantage of that? Tech?
My 16.5ps like this go on
Maybe if it was still 2012 or NIO was a pharma company they'd have a leg to stand on, but they're track record with 🦄 tech 2.0 is on par with Andrew's track record with his ex wife leaving him for a TSLA 🐂
Ya gotta answer that man
Ok mike
Chinese Communist Party manipulation is the culprit, in my opinion. I’d rather own 1 share of TSLA than 10 of NIO
because I thought Tesla was going to reach $450 by friday  (it did)
Holding, no imminent catalysts. They direct listed so my assumption is that more institutional groups will enter over the next few weeks.
major
But if everyone is buying how will we get paid since our salaries will be in NIO?
This graph is a heart attack visualized

This is a really good idea. I never buy them only shares And my money triples every year or more
no
Lol those are just scalpers dude hoping someone will bite nobody buys at that price. Most are selling for £650. There will be another shipment In a few weeks for Xmas sales and these scalpers with 10 consoles will be in the mud. These companies are not dumb.
Are you a fan of Tesla? All of the same shit could be said of them. They were mooning, and have been, for a long time. They are like 800X earnings.
Miller High Life?
Today sucked compared to monday
You do not need a college degree to be successful in life. I flunked college took up a trade job in carpentry and moved up to a project manager building customs homes. In 5 years. If it doesn’t make you happy fuck it. Get a job and trade with expendable money.
It’s a long game
Fuck no
25% fucked. Got out at open. Lol.  

Now NIO... that’s some real fuckery...
Literally any, turns out I fucking blow at short term trading
I have a 55c, yes im losing my mind
Fack that be amazing, 8% in 9 years is sexy AF
Interesting. I should look at them again. I like animals.
NIO gonna pump. Not enough for call holders to not get crushed by IV, but it’ll go up
YOLO everything on PLTR? Positions my guy.
They don’t like how Jack Ma’s head is shaped

Haha accidentally bought a se put a couple weeks ago when i thought it was a call and it started shittin the bed like 5 min later. $80 turned into like $500 in 15 min. By far the highest percentage return I’ve seen so far.
NIO just hit a higher floor and didn’t tank as hard as expected for an ER and some delusional bears are happy why?? It’s only up from here so I don’t understand why you’re happy lmao but whatever tendies for me and my NIO gang so idgaf y’all keep rabble rousing while I enjoy my champagne

Being aware of China allowing companies to commit fraud and questioning unaudited reports doesn’t make us racist. It means we don’t want to lose our money on another bullshit scam.
Got some put debit spreads for February
ANT IPO cancelled by the PRC
They do but rh doesn’t allow unlimited day trades on cash accounts
No one learned from Lukin Coffee. Only me and my wife's boyfriend....
oh idk, a company thats burning cash with their stock at all time highs?
I hate to break it to you but your WSB has a $50 fee per person that we will each assess you.

And deleting the post will have a $50 per person fee, too.

Can’t believe you didn’t read the small print and realize this whole deal is a Canadian scheme, eh.
Any insight?
Laguna Beach?
dayum, I think I may have bought it around that time of their relisting.
Not even close
Correct, because of the crash. It's not supposed to happen.
It reads exactly like a post on the rubik's cube subreddit saying that their parents think cubing is rotting their kids brain and they just don't understand waah waah
Are NIO leaps free money tomorrow?
Nope. I'm gonna let it ride out a bit longer. It opened at 3000% today. Now only 760% . Theta Depreciation is lovely. 

Even if I have to presell my shares at 430, I ain't no bitch ! :)
Alright Gandhi lol bet you easily will shit on people who have opposites of your positions.
Donkey kong
You must be new to this, MM’s eat fomoing retail trader ret@rds like you for breakfast
Depends on how much profit you're aiming for really
Not having to wipe after a very satisfying poop >>>>>>> 10 baggers and sex
okay, listen.


when you buy an option, the earnings volatility is already priced in to your extrinsic value.

after earnings, it is priced out. your IV will plummet in the morning, and if the price does not clear $55, the value of your option will be almost entirely composed of THETA, Which is the rate of time decay.

For the rest of your life, do not ever ever ever ever hold an option through earnings, unless EXP is months and months out.

your best bet is to hold now, and recover IV and hope the stock clears 55

If this stock rockets, you will get an IV bump, with no theta decay and be in the money. sell then.
18 cent moonshot lmao
Bought 5 more at 282.5 today. Hope you got in.
Did we all just get Trevor Miltoned on our NIO plays?!!
What happened I haven’t seen anything
LOL
Not even close to a yolo but 14 $65 Calls exp 1/20/23. Sold out of 7/8 of my FDs for about a 30% gain once at 2:59pm.
I’d help...but you started your post with the word “Legit,” which is annoying AF.
The show goes on!

THis is my home

they gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here

The are gonna need to send in the national guard or the fucking S.W.A.T. team cos i aint going nowheeeere
From a technical standpoint does it have to be even?
Good old Baka Test.

IV crush is a delicious flavoring for your soup.
I'm expecting a pullback to the $16.00 range soon enough. I sold at $18.50 today, and plan on re-entering WHEN it hits $16.00 again. The setup is perfect for destroying next quarter estimates.

May be a gay bear chasing a fright train soon though if it keeps running.

*update*

NO FUCKING BRAKES ON THIS TRAIN, SHIT. I'M BACK IN PLTR GANG FOR LIFE.

we can all post either bigly loss or gain porn at the same time.
Your parents have the right goal; their methods maybe odd and it's probably because they feel like nothing else is working. Their goals are definitely on point. Learning and understanding stocks and personal finance is a great tool but so is the other stuff you learn in school. If you're spending too much time on this stuff you've really got to stop and focus on your actual life goals for now.
comments on webull are even more retarded than the smoothbrains here on wsb.

Looks like somebody got a fill for 300 shares at 23.99 after hours randomly.
AAPL is one of those stonks you will be pissed if you sold out, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but eventully. I swore to myself years ago I would not make that mistake again and have never looked back.
I’ve played this company for 2 years, bought in @ 0.17/share .. they will have a big sell off after this when people learn about their debt and lost contracts. Needless to say this is a great stock to ride up and down, every time they get business they jump 30%
No one here cares about that game, but the IPO is sure to bring tendies
Pray that SPY nears 370 by the end of the year.
Kinda creepy but ok

Baba did nothing wrong why is it still dropping
HIMX May not be bad. Decent upside and very cheap rn.
copy & pasting are we? How about sucking some dick while you're at it?
In a bull market, the only answer is to make your own bears.
Where should it be EOW
Why?
what does a psych degree pay these days?  Are you going into masters/phd as well?  I feel like a BS in psych isn't gonna do much for a RIO.  Gonna be tough to build up a bankroll to yolo on this sub.
can someone ELI5 call options? so bullish on stock you sell a call option at  a higher price than current price at a future date?
Fake money practice trading. Download Webull they have a paper trade section. Retard
If I say “BABA go up tomorrow“ every day AH eventually it’ll happen right?
46:1 doesn’t count
Ah, makes sense. Wait, what..
I will never buy another put for as long as I live

There’s this homeless guy in my town that is literally always dancing. He doesn’t even have a tip jar or ask for money or anything. I drive by him like 3 times a day and at any time of the day he is just vibing out like crazy. Tell me how I’m looking at a homeless man thinking, “wow I need to be more like him”
>Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine

Dude, youre retarded.  There is a .44% chance because we've locked down and social distanced.  Let COVID run wild and tell me you still have a .44% chance of contracting covid without changing lifestyle.  Your argument is invalid because you assumed .44% applies for the general population in a non shutdown, non socially distanced world.

Bought a ton of PLTR today.... holding like an absolute idiot. $18.75 seems very far away.

Any PLTR bulls holding? Any imminent catalysts outside of post-ER bounce?
PLTR
Great for working out besides that it’s redundant to have an iPhone in your pocket and a iwatch on your wrist
lmao nio puts and calls destroyed by IV crush. NIO fucks both sides.
Ironical
SPY $300 end of month
NIO
More like 42.069
You are also being abusive 😿
It absolutely is a serious crime and many other people have been prosecuted for MUCH less. Leaving SAP level classified material in a vulnerable place DOES endanger people's lives. This whole notion of "lets never prosecute powerful people" is clearly not working. 

Since you have such a hard on for MORE SERIOUS CRIMES then please post them along with the statutes that were violated. You are a communist because you are repeating communist propaganda.
How many PLTR shares do you want for the sucky?
Obviously nio
Lol
WSB collectively shat themselves watching that dip loool. My sphincter tightened a bit, I'll admit. So glad it bounched back
Isn’t brigading only if you say bad shit?
Yeah I’m very curious too. I went a little longer with a couple of 25c 6/18/21 exp

You’ll hate us even more soon
I made a little off vale calls today, thanks.
It's ok. Force of habit.
that's my point retard. i'm guessing you aren't one of them.
Steps to free tendies. Step 1 buy nio and xpeng step 2 diamond hands step 3 huge profit in a year and more if you can hold longer. It really is THAT easy guys

Semantics really, his perspective is toxic and unnecessary. Why shit on teenagers? Or anybody for that matter? Everybody’s just trying to make some money
true - fucking insiders know something we dont. minute i saw it i looked for news. nothing
Yes the share lockup will end and employees are going to dump a shit ton of shares
Or if he actually makes money his parents might not care. OP are you deep in the red??
But when your manufacturing plants are fully automated with robotics and PLCs, I don’t think that’s much of a problem.
What’s a good $500-$700 leap to get in on?
Not unless you work out
Yes
I legit would like to learn how to do tattoos on the female body, that would be pretty cool if school is a goner for me. Plus tattoo artists are paid well and the perk of having it done on a girl
Why would you buy those positions 😩 please withdraw like half of this immediately
 WBA 12/11 $42 C bitchesssss
Quick question what IV ?
you're an idiot lol.
And if they self drive themselves to the factory expect a couple run over pedestrians.


Also wtf. Why is tesla so cheap with the emmc. Only 300 rewirites before failing? This is 60k car not a cd from 1997
“Jimmy Chill” he calls himself
Senate blocks nomination of Judy Shelton to the federal reserve. Puts are safe
This sub quickly went very racist.
I don’t have calls or anything. But it’s be cool to see.
what if it actually moons post-earnings?
the option is up 50% frmo when i bought reta rd
People are expecting the stock to drop after earnings so they are getting out while they can
Hopefully we’ll see PTLR dip to 16.50 before the next take off. If you’re in shares you hope for this too
[deleted]
Loading up on PS5 calls.
im being sarcastic, david.

now take that downvote away, or ill tell ur wife's boyfriend that you're investing in something that ISNT yoloing your life savings on Tesla FD's...
10 x for the new Xbox? That seems like a lie.
Umm..... uhhhh....   people pay for hbo max and just tolerate tbs.... maybe....   yep, calls on T.  

But damn.
The best trades I’ve ever put on were the ones by accident
Yea well listening to your dumb ass talk all day probably gets old pretty quick
Leap IV shouldn't change THAT much
Alright, real talk, does anyone else buy calls of the same asset with different expirys? Or is putting all your eggs in one basket the norm?
I hope this is correct as an outsider looking for an entry
I don't expect much more selloffs at least tbh. If you wanted to profit take around earnings why would you do it after stellar earnings? You'd sell immediately before earnings. 

We just had a couple big sell offs already too, if anything I think the FOMOers might be back in force tomorrow.

But who knows, NIO is just a fucking roller coaster. Wouldn't be that surprised if it opened at 35 or 55 tomorrow.
You best believe if it drops that low I'm loading the fuck up.
I hope it tanks more. Need to buy some
Because the price was too high before earnings.
Mod keeps deleting my posts because we can’t mention crip toe.

What does everyone think will happen to the price of butt coin after these countries release digi currencies??
wait for the NIO dilution announcement to send bulls packing
Apply for an mba take out all the loans then drop out and yolo nio calls
Dude, what the fuck? These idiots just keep posting the same shit about Nio every post lol


What’s different about me doing this and everyone posting the same “nio to the moon” shitpost?
Alright gonna hold NIO until next quarter 
Better luck next time ye
Calls it is.
over the last 3 months, there has been a brand new marketing team and branding team and the president moved into the company with those people coming into ZOM with the crazy track records of sales the accommodated over the years.. many more positives signs to come!
I think you meant Grindr
Thanks, maybe tomorrow it Will be also a good entry point
3 days is no time at all when you have weeklies lol
So they mainly sell vodka or commie blood?
Tech, puts on recent run ups
I am also smiling like a dumbass
They didn't sell because they foresaw a weakness in the business, it's because they don't agree with the implications and business practice of big data. 

We might see a small pullback after such a big run-up today, but honestly with that close of an expiration I'd say you saved yourself some heartache.
What’s going to rip tomorrow? Looking to buy a weekly
Deposited my remaining 1k from my student loan today and bought nio calls. Safe to say I’ll be sucking dick for money tomorrow
Exactly I’m gonna watch it for a week or two. Then load up.
anyone got an apple watch? is it useful?
Bro lol you just don't get it.
What’s going to rip tomorrow? Looking to buy a weekly
Perhaps. But I think there is a higher demand for PS5's than Xbox's, although there will most likely be more PS5's in circulation to drive price down. 

They sold more PS5s in preorders in first twelve hours than they did PS4 in first 12 weeks.
♥
Between the C in RH and the C in Webull I only had about 18k of my own money in originally. It dropped in value significantly and is just now going back up. I was in at about $56.00 per share on average. About 9k was what was stolen today. Would have appreciated the opportunity to lose that money 💰💰💰 in the market directly.
I want to be paid by MM to post in WSB. MM when you are reading this, let me know what stocks to pump/dump and how much I will be paid.
seriously just easier to type in ccl on my phone
Full blown Downs
You friend is right. Buying the dip is short squeezing. When I buy the dip I squeeze my short pp until I make happy.
Or get a worse addiction so trading looks tame by comparison.
Schwabgang
Can they hold it forever though? I know that ZOM did state it wouldn't do an RS in their last earnings (I used to be an investor when I had much less) but as far as I can tell they are just having the time of their lives making this actually work out.
Congrats and fuck you. I’m going to save this post so I could see this gain porn after work.
hurtz donut?
no one will be the last person to buy at the top because we will all keep buying
Lockdowns back on all over the place, covid deaths still going up, and more unemployment?? 
Calls
You think?😭
It's going to $150 by mid next year
It’s quite simple if you read the part that says “fuck China”
That's good enough for me tbh
I think
Exact reason I put some into PLTR.. I’m up 30% in 3 weeks overall, highest I hit was 33%, highest being PLUG @ 55%, and that’s after it took a huge hit today.
I think you meant Engrish
Mmm you’d be surprised
Rowwwrr
Except it wasn’t a post lol, and it had nothing to do with stocks or dd.
TSLA and AMZN both duds today lol
Jelly, I cant convince my self the premiums are worth it.
Yes. Sell for 5x then pick one up for ~$100 off retail in January
Wow, all those fractions, why did they write prices like that back then???

Yes, this is an asset bubble across the board. And yes, the late 90s were quite similar although we haven't yet reached peak mania. We're close.

Are you asking wallstreetbets for appropriate advice
Saw a lot of NIO bears gloating. You would think that bulls would have 6 months of bagholding in their future. Looks more like 6 hours IMO.
It's really not looking good. And I have 10k in calls. I'm probably going to dump tomorrow.
What’s different about me doing this and everyone posting the same “nio to the moon” shitpost?

Congrats on Level 2!!!
are you a U.S. Marine?
I just did, it says yolo now!
Grow up?
Well here's my honest take. If you can show them a history of winning more than you're losing, and by a decent margin, they may be more inclined to let you keep doing waht you're doing without them getting in your way, though they'll probably still pressure you to work on HW and schooling first. If  you can't provide history showing you at least SEEM to know what you're doing, and it's losses or staying stagnant, you've got nothing to back your case up.
Greatest play by Chinese - meme a stock and keep it flat for earnings. Someone played us all.
PLTR duh
Fetish.
Isn’t it February?
Have 1250 shares of pltr but got shaken out of my calls. Interested to see how it opens
Momentum dead on nio. Iv crushed. F

Some clown on my marketplace feed is trying to sell one for $2000. He’s got about 86 people roasting him at the moment.
Yeah idk Some big player sold everything
I bought in at +30% and made a good 15% today! Also bought Mara at the same time, made only 7%
How is that different than all of us buying calls individually?
PLTR dip bought after hours
No one cares about your gains unless it’s in the millions btw
Puts on this guys mental health
In all seriousness, I bought puts because it fucking exploded today and there is always a clawback the next day.  Hope I'm right and not get buttfucked.
Why do Europoors flip , and . in their numbers??? Disgusting 🤮 Ban!
hey guys my frist day here i bought 200 shares of this company called hurtz? no idea what they do but am i gucci?
The difference is that every one dollar PLTR moves is like a billion dollars and it’s already over half of Nio’s market cap
Fuck that game
There are dozens of YouTube competitors and you don’t know about any of them, not because you are retarded (which is obvious) but because YouTube is the platform that people want to use because that’s where all of the viewership is. It’s like saying mixer was a good investment because they will compete with twitch, well mixer is dead because no one wants to use that trash because everyone is on twitch
In the morning!
I had parents like that but they kicked me out cuz I was doing coke and hooked. So try that and see if they kick you out
I’m biased I guess. The 100 F $5 Jan 2023 are treating me well. Tesla has stagnated for now. It’s been in this wide range for so long even with S&P news.
Can’t wait to sign on and not read about NIO
Who are you so wise among men. Damn. Ima hope on that shit.

This is why I may go cash gang EOY, cant risk the catastrophic tank of a blue wave
Except then the shares fall below your buy in, making you either take the loss which likely exceeds your call sale, or you’re now a bag holder.
It's time for SPY puts, right? Puts it is.
There’s a tiny chance of that. I’ll keep it in the back of my mind. Just feel more confident about this lotto play than others.
They’ve probably had to hire thousands of customer service tard-wranglers since the inception of WSB just to handle morons like this

I wonder if we could use Palantir analytics software to determine when we should yolo in on PLTR calls
We're theta friends. Same exp/strike. Dope.
[deleted]
>... the price will go up and we will **all** make money. 

This is false.

Someone has to buy at the tip-top and then there is no money to be made. What do you do for them? How do you compensate? I don't want to be the one buying at the top (which I always am) so sweeten this deal.

Focus on school man. I promise you that is a better use of your time.
Xbox and PS5 are both sold out in the US from what I’ve read.
When you're investing in these low amounts you're better off maxing out your IRA/401k slowly throughout the year with VSTAX/SPY or creating a solid savings account instead of taking yolo plays.

if you want to pay a specific price, place a limit order. you won’t be filled at a price at or better than the price you want to pay.
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

What the fuck are you doing here? Why are you talking about 401ks?

How is trump in any way *not* an outlier example?

I’m not even a republican, you’re just a typical leftbot shill. Dime a dozen around here.
Nio is like Jason Vorhees
What are you talking about?
Can you source what makes you believe they are committing fraud? Cuz it just sounds like Trump calling voter fraud. Give us something. Convince us.

Nio 42 seems fair in my gayest opinion

you can literally calculate this yourself autist.  familiarize yourself with the Greeks

I thought everyone here just buys NIO and TSLA calls and lives in big mansions after making big profits?

Why not just stick to that?
I knew MM’s were gonna find a way to fuck over all NIO holders lmao

wait for the NIO dilution announcement to send the bulls packing.
indeed it's money that I don't really need. but I have some good resources that have over 200,000$ in ZOM that I trust
Really wish I could play demon souls and have no work to do tonight and see nio hit 55 and feel happy
Congrats, now go buy 200k of QQQ
Pltr
Lol school prob the better investment but trading teaches ya about life man

TF, you are right. What's up with this exact same move on all Chinese EV stocks
oh dear god
Cool, that doesn't matter. I'm telling you, the overall gains in a democrat market outweigh the gains in a republican market. You don't need volatility, that's why IV exists. It is all relevant. In an options market **low IV > high IV.** Say goodbye to daddy trump
I feel like it has a lot to fall after that run though. Like 35-40 is probably a decent entry point.

Specifically the ETF that track to the S&P, otherwise they will deviate from the S&P index.

SPY is an example of an ETF that will purchase when it is added.

ARK is an example of an ETF that doesn't have to wait until it is added since it doesn't track to the S&P.

Are PS5s in the USA re-selling higher than the retail price due to covid? 

In th UK there is a shortage of Xbox Series X and some have sold for 10x. There will most likely be the same for the PS5. I have a pre-order, it's selling 2x minimum but I wanna sell it for like 5x. Especially if there is a shortage in Christmas and we see major fomo.

It was like this except it had a defined blow off. People becoming rich off of companies with deteriorating business models. The stock splits were also a tell tale that’s when a lot of stocks just lost steam.

Zom is a company that makes veterinary treatments (Zoomedica) but it is horrible. Their pipeline is actually in play but it keeps failing to truly get off the ground (TruForma) and ultimately it is just a nothing-doing. One day he is right, it will work out, TruForma is quite ingenious, but unfortunately that day is so far off you may as well buy and hold for... ever. It'll likely delist first. Or be threatened with delisting (again).
I can’t find post anymore but there was a kid who posted that he bought like 900 tsla 500 calls. Was wondering what his gain was on that

That was a running theory for a while, and even one of the Pornhub people talked about it on Reddit as an idea, but I think they probably don't want to commit the resources to do it. I think trying to compete against YouTube (and thus, Google) is considered by many to be a lost cause.

Not really. they have some of the worst ad engagement on the internet. PH ads are some of the cheapest ads on the internet. A legit sfw site could boost revenue.
I think this is the play - slow bleed down and up slowly as well - so many people will forget about NIO in 10 days anyways and move onto the next meme stock.

It’s nuts. As much as I think Obamacare was a STEP in the right direction, it ended up being a gift to insurance companies. All the insane cost structures still exist, but now everyone has to buy insurance. Premiums have gone up 25% or more every year for the past few years and there’s nothing a person can do about it.

You’re telling me evs don’t make money
You buy and sell the *right* to buy shares with calls, not a contract for those *specific* shares. Can you imagine how nuts it would be with tax evasion if you could sell covered calls and if exercised they would just be taken in-kind out of your account with their cost basis intact?
I can't wait until day 6.
AMD.. 🤔 hoping for a January POP
[deleted]
Someone’s a bear
I mean no, my cost basis is 12 and I would not consider buying again unless it hits close to 40$ price floor. Despite being overall bullish on NIO I've also been slowly cashing out of gains. Down to my last 100 shares and a LEAP.

But betting against retard strength is usually a bad move. Especially doing an earnings play against IV crush.

at 7 when ching chong man starts talking he'll explain how the Nio is gonna continue to grow and rake in the profits making our stonky stonk go up

or at least i hope please god
About 30k gain today. Obviously still have a lot to go tm break even. But I’m holding strong.
Hopefully they never reach an agreement so SPY can go to 500

No chart showing it. Chinese government are dumping US treasuries to fund their operations. A Chinese state owned company couldn’t get the liquidity it needed, then another state owned company is on the verge of bankruptcy. If China didn’t inject 600 billion yuans into the market on Monday then they would of absolutely collapsed. Not saying they will, but China can’t print like the US can. They very well may come to a limit on how much repo they can do.
Lol the world may be gone by then!

No. Tomorrow is Wednesday. That is the mid-week so the price it is at now likely won't hold given that Thursday will be the winding and Friday the unwinding.

Will NIO get into the S&P tomorrow?
Anyone else long on MCD right now?  Looking bullish IMO: Bullish Divergence on the Daily Chart + MACD about to cross up...
Dude what the fuck. This idiot just keeps posting the same shit on every nio post lol
Kinda new here, you mean a dip in the price? What strike point you looking at for 2022 and 23?

Thank you so so so much!

Just need Georgia to paint everything blue and get a 10T stimmy. Ain't nothing happening before Jan
Is there more money on calls then just buying shares?
[deleted]
NIO with the 145% 30-day IV, doing not a whole lot after hours. Beautiful. A beautiful vega play.
Man could you imagine, just buy a slightly in the money call right before expiration and wake up Monday morning with 100 shares of amzn just sitting there and you paid $100 for the option!

I’m in December 4th 123 calls, shit doesn’t stop fuckin chopping
Ya hate to see it
How much loss porn tmrw
of course haha im well aware!!! 🙏🏽
Nah, sold half my 45 11/20 calls. Held the other half.

Got them for 1.20 a piece and will most likely break even or still profit on them in the am.

Also sold 50 11/20 65 calls at peak today. Easiest 100 shares of free nio I ever made

Conference call
1:57
Did you hear the clown from Citibank say there’s a chance it could go up to $318,000 per shitcoin
I hope youre all right about this! Balls deep in calls through 1/21/21
That would be a waste of money for them
Conference call
Same. 12/11 23c here
just like HD, smh
NIO still has that retard strength.
I think you’re trolling so I’m not going to answer
It only moved 0.2 percent from when you bought and you're telling people to buy this good job retard
No. PLTR is likely to go down to 17 and perhaps even 16.5-ish
“Hashtag boat water”
Ya supposedly by tomorrow morning so we’ll see
Yessir, they have a lot and I see the US building hundreds of thousands throughout the decade no matter who is president. Went to charge my Tesla yesterday at a new mall and they only had 6 of them in addition to 8 Tesla chargers.
another person said that like an hour ago in here too hahah that makes me laugh. at least youre not the only one

Just looked at nio results. looks good 👍🏽
“Look at this bug I caught”
Just saw that. I never buy puts but fuck CCL for burning me in the past on calls. But puts at the top today. Let them sink.
You realize palantir is helping to fight human trafficking, rescue missing children and fight terrorism. They work behind the scenes, and are a very misunderstood company.
Honestly fuck Nio. A bunch of literal teenagers think they’re Buffet after making a few dollars from their fractional shares.

Thank you. This is the kindest thing anyone has ever said to me.
Every single ev stock had the same large dip. It wasn’t because of earnings
Passive funds tracking the index needs to buy around 50 billion shares of tesla, elon will be taking bulls to tendies town.
Tesla 470 on dec 21
it cancels each other's effects thus flat earnings

Not if my puts have anything to say about it, spy cucked itself with tesla
Narrator: it wasn’t
Yeah SPY is down 0.5% on the day... get the circuit breakers ready!
Hmm.. I’ll probably wait for a pullback and then buy some 2022 and 2023 calls. But this is WSB, how the fuck do I know?

It was actually during august with that insane gamma run up. Every single day people sold into that strength and the market just went up every single time.

fascinating read
Who’s holding Apple or AMD calls
PLTR
Tesla's pricing is shit, they include some savings on gas in the sticker price that you probably already accounted for anyway before thinking of buying an EV.
 please tell me you sold some calls with all those shares.
I have a theory that Pornhub will one day launch a SFW video streaming site. People are starting to HATE youtube because of their nonstop ads and Pornhub has the video streaming infrastructure and capital to even come close to competing with them.

Every ev stock had the same dip and is moving the same. That wasn’t because of earnings
wow
I bought Corsair shares but I regret not buying Unity shares. Anything to do with gaming tech and gaming software will do well for at least the next 10 years
Guaranteed
Charge point, EV charging stations.
Get a real brokerage
Reading these comments and I genuinely think 90% of people don’t know NIO has a CC at 7. Either that or bears are shooting each other up with copium because they know CC will be good. Either way, smart gang knows what’s up and that’s what matters
Looking like a red day for Tesla tomorrow
Great. It’s covering all the countries around India .
Freaked me out this morning when they said institutions are the most bullish they’ve been ever. Average only 4% cash, most ‘all in’ since 2013. Holy shit
sure
11/27 CCL 16.5p finally looking some promising 🌈🐻
One for the Nio bears 🐻

NIO dead, what's next play?
Gonna load up on Feb NIO calls tomorrow post IV crush in prep for their battery day in January. Any red days between now and then will be bought. 

🤑🤑🤑
nio you fuck. theyre gonna announce breaking into new markets like europe, i have a feeling. big ups coming
Too many 🏳️‍🌈 🐻 are commies and love sucking CCP dick.

The smart phone keeps us down
Yes. I wanna see CCL open at 14.
The only thint ive learned is that im a retard
👉🏼👌🏼
But they do just disappear 😸
Maybe
Ever heard of margin?
Did you seriously decide to do this AFTER an 18% single day jump? Yikes. Take a breath and think this through. The premium will be stupid high.
Every EV stock had the same exact dip if you didn’t notice
I’d do the same for 250. MAX recertification possible tomorrow.
Careful with those options! Make sure to paper trade anything you don’t understand. Best of luck to you and congrats!
Can't garnish a margined account in the negative either. He needs the infinite money hack.
If you’re making that correlation, the younger company is more likely to be able to go another one or two times where is the older company was lucky enough to get it up in the first place.
That’s what I said, yes. Shareholders seem to have a great long outlook and theta gang (option writers) are going to profit.
SPY puts print? Maybe? 🙏
I shit whilst having a shower to train my endurance to bad smells
No I put in the new IV crush function my broker offers so I will be good to go
Why do NIO bears act like they're winning when it's flat and their puts are gonna get IV crushed to hell?
NIO dead.
I'll try to squeeze it in then.
it's not that big of beat considering the stocked soared this much, tesla beats their q2 eps by 1400%
Surprise quiz!

Select the event that is most likely to occur first:

a. Scientists discover the secret to eternal life

b. Heat death of our solar system

c. Fucking BABA goes back above 275


REEEEEEE
Lemme borrow $25k plz I’ll pay you back
buy at open. shits gonna pump. i have a feeling they are gonna announce some big things in the call and it will drive the stock up to 50 by open
The funny thing is it was mostly SPY spreads I had tried before that just would never seem to open regardless of what I did. I did ACB put credit spreads this time and that worked (just don't see it suddenly plummeting in 3 days with the trajectory it's gone, plus I didn't have much left in account to work with).
[deleted]
Lots of night left and they beat expected earnings, so who knows.
Is that the electric charging station company? What's your take on it? Are they the ones that will have stations at grocery markets, malls, etc?
Nice
You are fucked from IV crush. Better luck next time. Definitely no tendies as you seem to think
# 🚢🚰
Pltr does though.
nah its cause I when I sell shit always moons after lol
Having fun over here. I’m just sitting on the side collecting premium on my shares. This thing will go back up because no one cares that people are getting laid off or ‘Rona. Everything is priced in.
Good to know. Was that election week? I was too busy to pay attention and missed the rally. I know the buy/sell news is only a small variable that usually means nothing either way.

well flat for me was within the expected Move \~20%
Puts are almost in season

Options buyers are both sides are fucked if this (non) move holds.
Obviously that's bullshit, it's IV crush not EV crush. Your copy paste is a lie.

They still need to announce GM deal (Dec 3rd) maybe thats what they are waiting for
youre not wrong, but companies are doing that now a days too.
I actually bought CRSR puts instead of calls. Holy fuck someone take RH away from me
In this cruel, chaotic, and uncaring world, the only means by which we can attain some level of certainty and comfort for us & our families is by acquiring as much money as possible.

I have a few and even I know they fukt lmao
You know how much 12 cents was worth back in the day during the Great Depression? 🤡
Shouldn't have bought back my CRSR short puts, hopefully tomorrow's down so I can resell em
Anyone in 11/20 NIO calls or puts is gonna lose money tomorrow. IV crush baby
Now bringing you the fresh new autist spectrum
+45% is for those who bought it a day before. Not for those without positions. Go buy NIO
believe it or not but 6 is actually a lucky number in China
thanks homie!
Eh, it's a data company who sells to the surveillance state.  That's a pretty strong bet.
lets fucking go
My worry is that it will just be a slow trickle down across after hours
Tgt earnings always sexy as fuck. I remember the first time i played tgt earnings last year. Felt like the man when i woke up to 8% up. Then i sold too early and missed out on another 100%
Because the current valuation is in outer space thanks to retards pumping it, so an earnings beat isn't enough to justify that price, it needed to DESTROY earnings, which it didn't.
Implying they'd say no.
Imagine if your pension bought NKLA stock. Ooh, wait
Ok I see, thanks!
Apple is going to 125+ just so you know, so you will want shares, because they will do it in a way that options lose value..

but otherwise, yes, gamble up on Apple 100%
You don’t know me 👀
Why isn’t nio drilling harder, thought I’d be down 5k right now, it’s only 2.5k
What is SBE
You’re retarded I’m in!!!
Appl 125 eow?
Damn NIO rlly at $49 after hours
If BA hits 190 at open I would bust the fattest nut in human history
104.64% of your portfolio? WTF?
Yea I saw posts last night about people worried about their covered Tesla calls, if they should close them out etc in a panic.  Was lol
Why SBE
Interesting. I’m from Canada and have a hard time comprehending worrying about this so much. I’ve payed my provincial medical premiums before I was covered from an employer, which was 60-90$ a month if I remember correctly? Minuscule enough that I didn’t even think about it.

I’ve had a few major surgeries the last few years and haven’t payed a cent. Just crazy to think about.
Is everybody trying to off load their NIO bags and buy into TSLA???
I have a spread.. im retarded but not that retarded
what are you talking about CCL is barely down.
Did you even read your own article? Dec 21st is the soonest.
It can't report results for the year to 31 December on 31 December... It'll be at some point in February or March

no, prices can only go up. $80c 1/15 only needs price to increase by 80%. i’m all good
Thiel is a right wing loony. Those gov contacts are gonna dry up to nothing once Biden is in office.
I think its the guidance and how they see the company moving forward, this quarter was good   Now we wait for guidence
Buy it immediately with xpeng
Yeah it's inevitable we will have winter shutdowns and terrible Q12021 earnings for retail/entertainment/travel/etc, but I think the market looks forward beyond just the next quarter and they can see we will have vaccines available to at least the high risk people by spring next year (maybe even everyone), so one more quarter of shit earnings doesn't really matter that much at this point.
Nio sold 2 seasons worth of Oprah audience prizes. Wtf why aren't they mooning?
Anyone got Apple weeklies at EOD?
He might be blind.
Is that only calls or puts that expire soon? What about calls or puts that are into February expiration?
You underestimate us.
Cheers brotha 🍻
If it’s delisted bc they don’t allow someone other than a Chinese accountant to audit the company then no you will still have your shares but they just won’t be worth anything. 

I’m trolling, I really don’t know how that works though.
I’m all in on SBE. Ask me anything.
Thank you to who ever said CCL puts. This is the way. Wish I had gotten into NCLH as well but money is money. Thanks boys
Tomorrow is looking hella bearish.
So that’s the bear thesis right now? Okay. I feel better then. I thought there was actually something wrong that I was missing.
I was 3 calls deep at $28 with $40 calls expiring on 12/31.

Sold at $38 smh
A few weeks ago swinging +\-1k a day was a pretty decent amount for me. Then I lost like 15k with DKNG and made it all back the past 2 weeks plus another 5k or so. Now my account has just been swinging +\-6k every day and it doesn’t even phase me. Idk how I’ll go back to my normal fluctuations
Congrats and fuck you

Anyone know when Roblox IPO is releasing?
Run from here while you can lol

You will be fine, we will see 20 by the end of the week
Well NIO seems to be going green. Shareholders and Theta Gang win the day. 

Noobie bulls get to learn about IV crush, gay ass bears need to understand they’re not fucking smarter than other people, you don’t see shit in the market that everyone else doesn’t also see, and there’s no such thing as free money. 

Andrew “The Cuck” Left isn’t going to just tell you a stock is going to 25 and you get to ride it down like a slide covered in your mother’s breast milk.

And they expired worthless eow
It was mentioned on CNBC. Literally that's the reason.
Hold or sell Tesla calls?
Lol. It's going to be worth next to nothing
Probably not. Good news usually considered priced in when a stock soars 120% in a month
bro, let me see your progress pics bro
im 2.19 24c... id hold it.
Ohh I thought the call was the announcement of the numbers, what info does the call provide?
Actually I realized it's probably worse than 2k loss because of taxes fuck

I remember when this sub was actually as if 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. Then 2018 happened and now here we are, nothing but steers and queers in these parts
NOooooooooOOoooo
Many people are calling and telling me, "sir, after earnings, its going back up". So I have no reason to believe it won't.
same boat, only that I bought more calls during the drill... feel better
Why? For buying their products or for their valuations?
look at alibaba on that same site, the 12 month projections r horse shit tbh but you should be long nio nonetheless
Holding 510 $NVDA calls exp friday through earnings, will update glory or idiocy... if I remember
I honestly think the same shit. Was up like 15% this morning and couldn't sell cuz of pdt. 

Ended the day flat..

I do wonder tho how often id cut my winners a bit short

I was at 23k on Monday down back to 18. I was so close to getting there!!! Hopefully by eow
he'll learn eventually
 I still remember "sell in May and go away" -🐻🤡
Money market funds is at lowest point since Feb, must be why Jerome and other fed officials have been talking so much of late.

I just want shitcoin to die so all my coworkers stop talking about it
We all laugh at those who don't know what IV crush is, but consider this...

There are many on WSB who think if a call contract you sold gets exercised, then you just lose the shares. Not SELL the shares, but the shares just...disappear from your account.
Honestly just tinker.

I don’t think it’s tomorrow unless we get a huge catalyst. If it makes you feel better I watched the market rally 7-8 days straight with MOC orders always to the sell side in the billions. I thought any day now rug pull. We went down 1% and then everyday after for a week was all MOC orders to the buy side.
duh
Why can’t you buy options with leverage
Bears for Tesla exist because their valuation is bonkers and Elon’s full of shit 95% of the time.

Very nice
Worsening pandemic.  Vaccines will take forever to make the general population immune.  Lucky if there are cruises by next fall.  Summer at the earliest.  Why the F would they be up with never ending fixed costs
$37
Don't sell yourself short - you're probably more current on the state of vaccine affairs, candidates, and technologies than a lot of graduate studies holders. Glad to see you're staying modest :) I'm less of a vaccine specialist and more into therapeutic antibodies.

tesla's revenue for q3 is 8B USD and Nio's revenue is 4B RMB, the world has gone full retard
My calls need NIO to be added to sp500 tomorrow
Lol

Smart man. Learn from this and never be a 🌈 🐻 again
Some people didn't realize this till it hit 49.  Good for them.
add baking soda to water is biggest key
Nice work; you’re even more concentrated than I am. I’m also 3 months in and haven’t done options...but only averaging about 33% at this point.
Well done; and following you to see what your next moves are...


(PLTR?)
damn I wrote this?🤡🤡🤡
Harder than you think day trading with real capital on the line.
Once they patch my ps5 to make it stop crashing they'll moon for sure
Ok bears, looks like we’re at a stalemate. At 7 we’ll see who is truly fukt tomorrow. So far we have 1/2 pieces. EPS beat. You better Hope Chinese Elon dies on the call, because if you think NIO will reveal any bad news, well... youre retarded
Gonna be a sector rotation out of cruises and BA tomorrow
SO you are saying that NIO made up a fake revenue number so it would translate to 666.6 million USD?

SHITCOIN: 2017 bull run was short term retailer and trader speculation, a FOMO of fiat gains. This run is dominated by FOMO on adoption of Shitcoin as reserve asset by individuals, by corporations, and even nations.
How do you guys buy in the after market? Don't you have to place the order before market closes? Do you guys just place random low priced orders in case it works?
Most stocks aren’t already up 1000% in the last 2 weeks though.
Cursed thread
So you're saying on December 1st the stock price will tank hard?
Btw how do you know this?
I know A lot of Chinese people and know more about the company than most people on here. China doesn’t want to see Tesla take over they want Chinese made cars they are very nationalistic
Pornhub is up 69% since 04/20

Overtrading
Doing BKE 32.5c 11/20 because everybody went outside shopping at their stores during Covid last quarter. LMFAO, they all shoulda done Amazon.
What
NCLH secondary offering. Affecting the other cruise lines as sympathy
when shit trades flat and you only buy options.  luckily not a problem in this market.
The problem with being right in a situation like this is that the gains are not as substantial as a surprise move.  Theta Gang plays are boring but I’ll enjoy the victory lap.

Yes, it is stocks. Stocks only go up
call the houston astros a "bunch of cheating f&\*g\*tts" , but actually use the 'f' word
what happened? I have CCL puts
Honest question; how is it possible to lose money on an account with $25k+ that isn’t subject to PDT? Like you can’t you play volatility on both sides and exit a position before taking significant losses? I feel like i keep seeing opportunities that I’m unable to act on out of fear of getting hit with PDT
Sir, this is a Wendy's.



Hol up that actually makes sense

help
PLTR is going to 100 no matter if you want that or not.
She hot tho
To me, considering the price action and hype the last few days, you would probably miss out on a lot of the stock appreciation by going for the 17s. I went for the 19s and they're pretty close to being touched and it wasn't very good premium up there. PLTR is $17.85 as of writing this, so nearly 5% (if not more if it keeps going up the rest of the week) is going to be lost if you keep holding the shares and let them get called away. The way the stock has behaved lately and the buzz around it makes me think that it can hit $40 at some point this year.
Lol

Why tf nio is down so much ah? ER was good imo?
Dude deserves it. Did you listen to his commencement speech about his career path? NBC did him dirty

Nio could mobilize an entire small fishing town with all those cars they've sold! Wtf why isnt it mooning!
Retarded
Held my CCL puts through today and averaged down with all my money. 50 CCL weeklies 😊
I don’t have calls I’m a shareholder, aka not an idiot who gambles on calls and puts
I thought earnings were at 7 but they came out shortly after 4, am I missing something?
Secondary offering
It won't fall that low. If it does, rip to the WSB pensions funds managers that YOLO'd their private portfolios with NIO.
Of course it is unaudited lol what did u expected?
EST or CST?
According to the story it seems he just bought houses and sea scooters with the money instead of investing it
Everything fucking dies, IV is way to high
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run
'Cause we're them old boys raised on shotguns
>Revenue rose 146% to RMB4.526 billion, or $666.6 million

>Chinese people take Six (六) as a fortunate number mainly meaning smooth or well-off. In Chinese “六六大顺” means that everything is going smoothly.
I tried to sign up for Amazon pharmacy to check it out. There are too many steps and they require too much personal information. Many people will not want to use it imho now. Gdrx requires no information from you and is easy to use. Doctors recommend gdrx to their patients, I highly doubt they will recommend big boy Amazon to anyone.
Dolly Parton is a fucking national treasure go google how much good shes done in her life. i aint religious but GOD BLESS her soul and her giant fun-bags
Doubtful, not even iran war rumors could break 360 support. One of the strongest support levels I’ve ever seen

Well... no. But it will get close to 470. Of course that’s because on January 2-3 they will announce car deliveries
On the other side of the trade expecting a big move. Almost below the put wing so still hoping.
news on NCLH?
NIO flatter than Emily Willis 😖

I stayed outta this one for once
Lmfao he said I hope you have nowhere to live 😂😭
Also $1.5B sell at the end of the day... not good.
If you don't buy shares in a company that indirectly kill people, those people will have died for nothing. 

Might as well let their deaths mean something and that something being fat stacks of cash for you.

Remember blood money is the most valuable money since that money was earned with someone's death.
Of course the drop was expected but it’s straight back up the rest of the week. The drop was the old floor new floor is gunna be 50 next week
Don’t care. Already sold my 47puts on Friday. Awesome! Made enough for my sons school tuition for the year. Yup, still in school. Do whatever u want NIO & thank u!📉

I'd imagine quite a few MMs are going to set new entry points for NIO tmr and targets.  Just have to hope it's somewhere above 47.
At least it was shares and not options. Way easier dealing with missing out on $200ish rather than $20k+

Shit, I just read the “beat” part of the alert.

Sounds like a second offering. DCT just did this last week - dropped on the news then recovered very quickly
Trade war with Africa canceled!
Sir that sounds  like math and stuff.  This is Wendy's not Stanford.
The info I found about 212 being dodgy, their spreads being up to 550% higher than other platforms, I just stayed away. Etoro is the way fam. I opened a trading 212 so I could take short positions without affecting my main account.
He's definitely the sharpest bulb in the shed
Not happening. Lol

is this irrelevant? “The 17 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for NIO Inc have a median target of 155.80, with a high estimate of 310.32 and a low estimate of 44.12. The median estimate represents a +241.83% increase from the last price of 45.58.”
well it's high risk high reward. I put like 5% of my current buying power on the line with some NIO calls today.  Not really that upset right now.  We'll see how things look in two weeks when they expire.

But if you YOLO'd your entire account into FDs for tmr yea get fukt you deserve it.
Who gives a fuck about your profile GTFO BUY NIO
Biiiiiiig wrong. She’s an advocate for going back to the gold standard. Caint print gold.
yes! MAC is about to take off as well.
Well I would but it’s deep inside my asshole so I don’t want to mess up the doll

No.  Get it done before 7
After earnings, where the big move occurs (or doesn't), the price is no longer expected to move as much. Options that priced in a big move will depreciate if the move is too small.
You have to do something truly stupid and get banned and the mod will assign you one. True story

Y’all are dumb, wait til 7pm when the big moves take place either up or down
Already peaked
Prove yourself
Yes! $KSS paid off big today. Next up is $M. I sold $JWN too soon unfortunately. 

Retail is so beaten down, and has such low expectations, that a decent earnings and some guidance moves them up a couple bucks.

My best so far was $BBY. That was the most obvious one too.
I'm crossing my fingers for a meme-worthy Friday payoff. My 200 contracts won't sell at $0.01 anyways haha.

Nio is going up again. It's inevitable.
with you but smaller stake. made 4500 friday morning, lost 4900 the rest of the day, made 1900 on PLTR and lost it all and probably more on holding nio. Fuck this game and lessons learned. walk away when you have big profit for the day and stop trying to make it even bigger.
It opened at 3190 today.  

The chances are excellent
Unlikely. You’re going to have a lot of selling. Would wait until EOW.
fuck nio is dead after last friday. so whats next I miss my 10% days
Lmao, look at NIO trading so carefully rn, investors have no idea what to do until 7
Hahaha I’m not even in NIO my guy. I just saw you mention NIOphites, thought it was a reference to the Nephites from the Book of Mormon.
I did, but I am an idiot, so you shouldnt

 I’m mixing up avocado oil with some garlic and thyme. Hoping this makes them crispy though! I’ve always been disappointed in my oven potatos versus fries.
Is it easy to buy the rumor? Yes. Is it easy to make money off the rumor? Ask everyone over the summer after Q2 results. People lost a fortune thinking TSLA was going to be admitted. And then Etsy got the nod.

Yes, Dolly Parton part-funded research which went towards the Moderna vaccine which has reported 94.5% effectiveness.
I ditched my calls and switched to stocks. If it goes down at least I can relax knowing that one day it will go back up again without time pressure when the stock-down-pushing-fuckers are out of the game.

Made $104k off those 4 stocks
I would bet all the money I have that that won’t happen
Risky indeed but the market maker move is +/- $6.50 and 1 standard deviation range of $52-39 so after factoring that into what was $46 at the time I’m comfortable with my decision. Check back Friday to see me die or survive 🤣

No.
Holy shit that's embarrassing. Not only did you look like a retard to the help desk, but then you posted it to reddit.

Close your account and go watch some more YouTube videos before you end up behind Wendy's blowing more than just your portfolio.
So does this mean you made $300k off this one stock?
strike?
NIOs done boys, Huami is the next Chinese play to moon before earnings
I can't wait to short this
ur right im tard
Me too
This is the best sub on Reddit and half the time I don’t even know wtf is going on
Stonks go upper or downer I think
Add some SHMP
I see an EKG formation with a heart attack.  very bearish.
Didn’t they sell off a ton?
Spritz oil on them too helps crisp em up.
Sir, this is a casino
Get banned. Was recently upgraded to 35
No they deal with info and surveillance. Raytheon, Northrop, General Atomics, etc, those are the ones that kill.
Going down to 220.
My dog has a full on erection - he knows the NIO loss porn is coming
[deleted]
Tomorrow 1 hour after open
😍🕶️👌
You spelled $690 wrong
Its still up in the air whether I need lube or lotion tonight
Whoever didn’t see the NIO drop coming from a mile away and has been here for over a month is unsmart
I shouldn’t be celebrating until I can exit tomorrow morning - but damn it feels good to be right.
Because the earnings are still trash and also because you idiots buy fake Chinese meme stocks at ATH
Imagine trusting China’s numbers
WTF was that low ass volume at the end of the day on SPY? Not even breaking 1M? Such bullshit.
Ok nio just bleed back down to 42 please
because you have calls but dont want see its puting.
So whats the fucking deal with PLTR?  


Like, I know they're in big data, but why is this sub so crazy about them?
I'm stupid and somehow thought NVDA er was scheduled for today. But it's tomorrow...
[removed]
lol similar situation for me. bought under $10, sold covered call, it expired worthless, PLTR ran up later, I sold $12.5c, now I'm locking in a 30% gain but the sold call was a 16 bagger for the one who bought it haha. Today I bought more shares under $18 and sold $22c for feb. I'm ok if it just keeps running and I lose the shares or if it stays pretty flat. I think PLTR will be around a while
Is this Ylan Mui chick on CNBC a love child of Elon and NIO?
But those are way to OTM with exp too short too.
Already made 20k on nio puts lmao
You do something worth a flair
They used to give out a while ago. They're no longer giving them out.
How are my TJX puts gonna hold up
You realize the numbers are not audited right
I got them at $6 ;)
It is a POS stock that would get crushed by BABA and AMZN if Africia was investable by them.
Report for false use of the DD.

This is more ban worthy then usual.
Lol I sold less contracts but 50 calls it was such an obvious play lol

IV crush is the phenomenon whereby the extrinsic value of an options contract makes a sharp decline following the occurrence of significant corporate events such as earnings.   Unfortunately, this implied volatility crush catches many options trading beginners off guard. Buyers of stock options before earnings release is the most common way options trading beginners are introduced to the Volatility Crush.   Not only are they shocked to find out that they didn't make any money on their option - even though the stock went in their favor - they lost all their money!
No such thing spy calls only print my man
NIO doesn’t want you cause you asked PLTR
So Nio is coming back up? We should expect a $47 tomorrow?
February. Lockup ends so it’ll likely be a big dip. Just buy up and hold on it’ll go triple digits over the next few years
Ban.
NIO day, 150 kwh battery, new cars being released next year, stellar Q4 guidance, Beijing mandate for 20% EV in 2025, government contract to buy cars from NIO.

But have fun getting IV crushed tomorrow 🌈🐻
I’ll be back at 7 to offer mental health support
Holy shit. I think I may have discovered the trick to crispy oven potatoes...partially boiling them and roughing them up before cooking much like French fries. 🤔

C’mon tsla, please go uppies
...all quarterly results are unaudited.. for any company. (I was an auditor of large public companies). They are "reviewed" by audit firms at each quarter and then a audited report annually.
357 tomorrow?
until next monday. get in on friday.
Guess I have to continue selling call to lower my NIO average

Bro at this point it’s 50-50 anything can happen
Weird that xpev went +33% post er and li similar but nio drops. Maybe xpev was undervalued at the time
Your puts gunna get IV crushed lmao
TSLA stock split pls
Ehhhh I wouldn’t count on it.
Damn if you had just done Tesla calls instead of shares you’d be up 3x your portfolio
Would be funny if Nio just stayed there
WUT
"The number 6 is generally considered to be lucky in China because 六 sounds like 流 (liú), which means "flow" in Chinese. Many businesses display the number 6 to bring good fortune. Unlike in western culture where 666 is associated with the devil, multiples of 6 is good in Chinese culture. A popular Chinese idiom, 六六大顺 (liù liù dà shùn), means that things will go smoothly."
That’s hot & horny
Straight shares homie
Stonks only go up but also sometimes down
I love seeing the delusional bears in here talking about how “NIO is done” lol y’all can keep pretending all you want but you made the wrong call you should have got in, and maybe tommorow it won’t be too late. They did as expected on ER and are becoming chinas #1 EV. Chinese are nationalist af the company isn’t going anywhere but up. Bears R fuk yet again
Show the positions, on RH
Why is her face melting?
It won’t be worthless but man you’ll take an IV dive if it doesn’t open over $47
Is this about NIO?
jack twitter looks like a guy who swallows gasoline, knives and eats lightbulbs
how do i get a flair
Right now institutional investors are reaching out to ppl that have experience working with PLTR and are paying them for info. they are doing their DD and i expect them to make big moves in the near future.
My puts are printing, this is going to 35 eow
Should I still get in PLTR calls with this high ass IV or nah?
I hope we can move on from EV sector now to something different, or at least for some time.
Fuck man I was just thinking the same thing
Soon mods are gonna want to review and approve “DD” posts before they are published
Why did it just tank after hours
[deleted]
True that’s why you sell calls or puts to play earnings😂
Yeah I was thinking of getting more near atm/itm ☹️ worst case this isn’t the floor and 240 actually is.
Greeks. Learn them.
Aunt JMIA making 🥞 after hours
?? Those girls be thikk.
Yeah, ideally we either get some pre market news on that or just a generally bullish night with futures and we open somewhere in the +2% range tomorrow. My calls are about $8 ITM at the moment but expire Friday so im looking for one more pump to get out.
FSR is ripe for a 100% moonshot if you wanna stay in the EV sector. Consolidated last few days around 16 to 17. NIU earnings coming up too. Tiny float and small market cap could move in a major hurry above $40. Or the good ol PLTR!
That guy has no options. IV will bite even if the stonk doesn t move
Not too late if you hold long term.
Ask Elon to smoke a joint and 69 your wife you retard
If there's one stock that can be equally as retarded as people here, it's TSLA. but yeah I'm just watching from sidelines. I wish it would have gone up for the memes tho :)
Dread it, run from it, Theta Gang wins all the same.
JMIA AH 😳

Holy shit, OP...
Right, diamond handed would be sick. I'm in on this now for 12/18 8c. Still lookin juicy.
Their earnings call is at 7pm eastern then ur gonna get fucked when they say they expanded to Europe haha gg in the morning
Anyone in on FNKO? Up 11% the last week
I've got 99 $1 options but NIO aint one.

Short squeeze as well possibly
As someone with neither calls nor puts on NIO I am enjoying the chaos.
Are you trading weeklies with 2 mill?? Holy crap, you've got some balls.
How long will BABA consolidate in this 250-260 range???

Must not be corn fed then
I bought 1 share of UVXY because I can
Pltr almost made me 100 earlier today but I was greedy and made a whopping total of 12 bucks
anyone think a 12/18 $3195 AMZN call will print? I got in around when the stock price was at $3160 today.
Too bullish
Gotcha yeah gotta wait for the earnings call to really see what happens
MU $90C ??
I see a snake figure formation symbol forming on NIO, very bullish.
It's down 8 cents AH after a 12% day lol
Nio after hours is like a crazy gifriend on Saturday night.
Got a little aggressive on spy calls today.

Could go for the following statements tonight;
“Spy is too low”
“Stimulus deal announced tomorrow”
“XYZ cure 98% effective”
I had $3k to spend, that would give me (3000/14 = 214 shares - I bought when PLTR was at 14$) instead, I bought 9 contracts (900shares) so around 4,2x
NIO $100 by next March
They held on the 1% chance it would moon after earnings.
[deleted]
Nio opens aggressively flat. Calls and puts are donated money for about a week. Love how people are massively bullish/bearish thinking it’s gonna moon or dive and somehow IV crush won’t murder valuation. It was priced in pretty well I think.
It’s pooping, is that better. Stairs up, elevator down. Hope you didn’t buy calls
My puts expire Friday I need a red week now
There's a reason why they're living in garden sheds: they simply don't have the galaxy brains necessary for making those high level plays such as buying 1/21 $30 PLTR calls while selling the 12/4 $25 calls.
Ban for no post flair.

Show me on the doll where the market touched you
i eat second lunch before i leave work, then i go home and eat dinner lmao im a growing boy
for the new people here, good ER results does NOT guarantee a boost in stock price. quite the opposite actually, usually good ERs are followed by an unexplainable sell-off. dont be mad at me im just the messenger.

What’s been the deal with Fox News lately? I knew they always had a bias, but now their titles are just Breitbart tier clickbait, and turned the bias up to 11, wtf happened? E.g. “why joe Biden isn’t enough for the left”

Not yet, but a green day tomorrow is my coffin
They are on a good path.
Lmao pretty much, I lost a decent chunk on those calls already, figured may as well just see what happens with the earnings call. I’m very new to trading
Tru tru. I'm long but got some puts to hedge so I'm ok with this
Came here for the NIO comments.
Can NIO be saved? My 46.5 11/20 calls need this

Im so glad the NIO meme is over and all the RH users are back to their 9-5's
1% of 10000 is 100

Nice trade! Also I’m stickied to the bots dongus
Damn, didn't know 8 months out were weeklies :/, I was talking about his positions which were 11/20 IIRC
Genius
Buy calls first. They are going to pump that shit to sell into strength. I'm eyeing some dec 4th weeklies. Then buy your puts on that pump.  They need to generate buyers in order to sell without tanking the price.

They’re not real
That IV is going to hit hard too
Good luck.  I still stand by my decision as the right one. Market agrees so far.
NIO earnings don’t come out till 7pm I thought
IDK she’s a fighter never stays down long and it was a strong ER ... most stocks that have dipped on positive ER beat have come back to ATH in a couple of weeks. 

Nio is a volatile lil bish but she’s proven to be a track star this far

There's nothing wrong with the financials but there's just nothing to justify a moon in there, valuation is pumped up.  It's going places long term I just don't see it to the moon tonight.

Pump and dump? Good ethical plan there.
Your money can be found behind the dumpster at Wendy’s.
16ish maybe
That's what they mean when they say, "tHeSe CaLlS aRe PrInTiNg!"
Don't worry Nio fam, the FSR fam welcomes you with open arms.
That’s it? You could say that regardless of the result though. 

What about the content/numbers do you have problem with though?

these Chinese EV carmakers always have better than expected earnings and sales because it's all unaudited. Wouldn't be surprised if it turns into another Luckin Coffee
The stock price was priced for beyond perfection though. They would've had to say some shit like "we're gonna surpass Tesla within a year" for it to moon after earnings
No
Unless it was BA covered calls 😭
I feel bad for all the homies with NIO calls. Biggest pump and dump scam in the last 10 years.
She's going to get in. McConnell just going to wait for Harris to go out of town.
Vale calls are printing.

I told everyone they would, gave detailed explanations as to why, pointed out future prospects, etc...

There’s only one move tommorow if you want to make money, buy NIO and Xpeng shares ASAP and hope they aren’t crazy high by the time you do. NIO bulls congratz enjoy tendie town my brothers

It’s almost the exact same as last quarter. Losing money still.
I’m guessing people are waiting for the actual call to provide a little more guidance

What do NIO bears not like about the ER? I’m confused.
I disagree. Boeing is one of the only stocks to not come close to its pre Covid price. These old-timey establishment stocks are all coming back under Biden. I'd hold shares til theyre back at 400+

Oh god tomorrow is going to be blood fucking donger isnt it
A lot of people will say chinese companies make up numbers. I dont think they got proof but we ain't got proof that they don't either *Shrug*.
We have very different definitions of flat lol
Why’d NCHL drop 2% and why isnt CCL also dropping?
amen, let us pray
25 $450 11/20 calls
Lol didn’t expect the disappointing stagnation from NIO

Ya you are about to experience what it's like to be a cuck, sideways for 6 months
Once you realize how badly IV crush can fuck hold through earnings options, you do 1 of two things.

Sell cash covered puts or covered calls

Lose your money the old fashioned way, picking uppies when it's really downies.
Ok I'll bite. What's the next NIO?
First
There are so many pump opportunities for recovery stocks within the next couple of months:


-Emergency authorization granted for Pfizer/Moderna


-Oxford/AZ vaccine results released


-Once the high risk population is inoculated then the hospitalization/death rate will plummet even more, leading to more reopening

Lmao it’s been literally climbing to Valhalla since I bought at $6 without the help of all these idiots who think they know the company inside and out but didn’t buy it till it was $40. It will continue its monstrous growth with or without the noise
Why the fuck didn’t I just sell Tesla when I was up why I gotta be like this man. I never win on this stupid stock

Who was worse? PRPL gang or NIO gang? Poor one out for our fellow brothers
NIO earnings report forecast was a loss of $0.17 per share on **revenue** of $653.73 million. NIO reported a **revenue** of 666.66 million. Beating the target...
$666.6M sales.. those are lucky numbers in Gyna
Report came out but call has not happened yet. I have 400 shares got in at 28.40 back in OCT. Got 20 iron condors expiring 11/20 55c/36p brining in about 2.2k. If it does open low then I’ll def buy more shares since earnings report looks reaaaaal good
Well it was up like 8% at the time, which has led to consolidation typically for them. 

Not the most optimal move but it wasn't a massive position or anything either. A little column A a little column B I think
It's tomorrow.

edit: There's no other timing. pandemic reality will set soon,I think this week big uppies day then slow bleed.

I’m high key waiting for it to break down on this NIO dump
NIO is that crazy ex girlfriend. You know the one. Best sex of your life but she’s bipolar AF. You keep going back but you get too attached and then...she torches all your shit in the front yard. Still worth it.
More states/counties about going back into lockdown, resurging covid cases, vaccine news will wear off..

NLS $25 12/18 will bring me some sweet moola baby
How are they "weak"? I was able to get $60/each at $17 strike on Monday when it was under $16. That is \~4% premium with the stock >6% under the strike price. For 4 days.

Here is what I had on Monday:  
  Bought at $15.50 and then sold $17 strike for $0.60/contract. That is over 13% profit if it gets assigned.
U r fuk
NIO run up was huge. Profit taking will happen in the short term but I see it hitting $50 before 2021.
Fuck yea
i'll be honest, i never thought i'd say this but im actually enjoying seeing big green numbers more than i enjoyed cocaine. although they still dont beat cocaine + hookers + cialis. maybe if i hit a 10-bagger we'll see.
technicals mean nothing
Yolo on the puts
All I want is CCL to drop to 13 or so. Is that really too much to ask?
PLTR 👀 👀 👀
I have faith
MY TENDIES
Its China...
Healthcare and military get it first, then the most vulnerable, which I believe is nursing homes. Disease has been brutal there.
PLTR because its Raytheon or Boeing for Government Software. Gov won't let it fail. Billions and billions in contracts incoming boys!
My break even on NIO is 55
saaaaaaame
Are Chinese quarters discrete reporting periods?  If not this is not unusual
Nio bulls are delusional.  They just won’t sell.  Give it a red week and paranoia will set in
Its gonna hit 21 tomorrow.

Lol all the nio bears left because they know their accounts are fucked tommorow. I’d feel bad for them but they are always so toxic and try to use lies and fear tactics on here. You got what you deserved enjoy your just desserts while us NiO bulls go to tendie town this year
this is  indeed a fool proof  strategy
Personally i hope you were one day early on the BA
Finally, a ret@rd who knows how to properly use the gain flair. Nice trade.

Hi Wendy's, it's me... again...
Probably a 85% drop or so. I feel like any lottos I held for other earnings that dove were an 80-92% drop the next morning.

Time after time Chinese stocks have been frauds with god awful made up numbers; its repeated facts not racism idiot.
Anyone else low-key waiting for PLTR to break 18 AH?
Do not do this
This did not age well at all
Trying iron condors for earnings again. Looks like this will be a winner. 

Thetagang.

With earnings  you get so much leeway (leverage)


Make profit if it stays between 37-55 by Friday.
Let's be completely honest. It's a chinese company. Shit either moons or slams back to earth, pretty easy to swing either way, cuz China does shady shit with stocks. We have previous experience with things like luckin coffee (Again, China) which moon'd for a while then just... bam everyone who hadn't cashed in lost fortunes
Yoooo there was so many people guaranteeing that tesla would go up further today. And I believed them. What happened tho?Moving with market i guess?I hope you guys secured the bag tho :).
Thanks bro
Lol
watched news yesterday and they pretty much said there'll be a 4-phase roll-out:

1a) frontline workers - doctors, nurses, police, first responders

1b) Terminally ill and very sick patients

2) High risk areas and elderly

3) General population smaller size

4) Anyone who wants one

5) wsb

Muh iv
Somewhere in the 1-2 range if I had to guess.  Basically you give up the roided our IV and go back to merely high IV.  That’s assuming it holds 45ish.
I guess you could say I'm pretty retarded
I fuckin need this so bad. Averaged down my 275 Jan calls today and still down around 30%
>Stock gained > 100% in a month 

>ER ~ beat by 29%
Nah, not even close. The total open interest on January calls is <300,000 contracts. There is still a fuck load of open interest in January calls though.

Obviously it wasn't priced in then
lol yeah of course nio has retard strength . People will be buying the dip
Patience
Is Palantir helping the US kill people? Only if they do their job right.
It's unaudited, you wont know the real numbers.
Palantir helped keep me and all our bois safe. To the Moon. Also Karp was moto as fuck when it he talked about them being all in for the West. I'm all in for Palantir.

Usually takes 3-5 months, but Opendoors pretty huge so I think they’ll merge within 3 months (they announced in September)
It's going to lose a bunch of value from the big drop in IV.

If NIO stays flat and doesn't climb, it will also lose intrinsic value as well.

If you've been watching tesla you would have seen that it plummeted when snp500 announced it wasn't getting in a few months ago.
PLTR baby lets goooooo!
FuD has had some part in suppressing the SP, that should stop now and should let the SP grow to where it should be.  Very slowly though, like a wound that keeps getting re-opened now it has a chance to heal

Don't worry OP. Keep holding. Diamond hands. Lambo soon.

I see those lockdowns are coming back in the Midwest. Time for DOCU and AMZN calls. Sold BA today

Here's a hint one of those was over an hour ago and one of those wasn't
It’s not a win for the bears either when the stock moves 5-15% a day for no reason all the time.

Conference call @ 7 is going to dictate tomorrow — it’s just flopping all over the place right now and it’s impossible to infer anything meaningful.

They beat their estimates with 100%+ YOY growth and project q4 sales increase of  35%-39% more units compared to q3. They also have $19bil in cash and cash equivalents. If it's dropping, it's because of the hype. Their financials are pretty nice.
No if you're selling a put you make money off the premium just like selling a call.

Everybody isn’t as bad at this as you are
Get that karma Big Bro
IMMEDIATELY
Is this even relevant outside of "china bad"? 

Are newer IPOs expected to audit every single earnings report?
LOL
just wait until pre market, there is going to be a bigger drop
Famous last words.
Holy fuck. Is this a room of 17 year olds?  It's like it is your first time investing and dealing with an ER.  Beating earnings almost never fucking matters.  'But why muh stock down?'.....

80% of companies will beat earnigns.  It isn't that big of a boost.  Getting an ER bump requires some type of surprise and bullish forward guidance.
That much is true
Yes.. imma go with you being retarded on this one.
Supposedly it was at $9 which if fucking hilarious
IV 153% 🤣
Interesting take.  I agree they are sterling numbers if indeed legitimate
Strike / Exp? If you bought weekly calls today i know youre hurtin
Seriously, it is. The fact it just took back most of the sell-off from ATH is nuts, and the Russ is leading the way. 380-400 by end of year.
Don’t trust it
Not nio, I got Tesla calls from right before closing,m. Nio and Tesla don’t follow the same trend right?
I was told you shouldn’t hold through earnings. So wtf are you NIO holders doing?
Why do you guys even bother playing anything other than spy calls? Steady 100% gains on weekly calls
Agree after the dust has settled.
I’m so suprised MU has not fell off a cliff yet
We don’t do “investing” around here
i’m retarded explain
PLTR 20c is a money maker, it's just a matter of choosing which exp.
I mean, you’re probably not wrong
Lmao i went all in at 27. Made around 60% profit  (on average I put some money i made in the meantime in)

Who? If it’s not EV it’s dead
Yeah honestly with 200% IV the correct move is either just go shares if you think it'll go up after earnings, maybe LEAPS, or sell puts.

If you think it'll go down...well I guess you can sell calls or credit spreads, buying short DTE puts prolly a bad idea because unless it tanks super hard you're not gonna come out ahead.
Why would you do that?

When Walmart + really picks up subs they gonna take off. Right now they earn a multiple as a brick and mortar retail/grocery store. WMT has what 4600 stores? They are within 10 miles of %90 of the population of the US. Imagine same day, less than 2 hour delivery? The upside to WMT is yuuge
$54/$57 calls exp Friday. But I read their earnings and it’s actually very good.

Let's talk Boeing. Investors are expecting the FAA to recertify the 737 MAX. I am selling the run up to the hype. I sold shares I got at $120 and $170, and selling covered calls against my shares. Anybody really think this will skyrocket after approval? Great, you got your product approved, but you still need the buyers and the airlines are hurting.
I said only pre-market would be 8%.
Smart
It was ITM. Why would you hold?

wow the IV crush on NIO will be rough. My broker is saying the options were forecasting a 13.9% move in either direction .MMs win again
NIO earnings report seems too good. Seems like they just copy and pasted TSLA rate growth numbers and slapped NIO on there, would be good to see a few negatives to be honest to seem more realistic. Seems similar to LK to me but idk maybe they’re legit. I think a lot of the market doesn’t trust them.

Someone here bought calls at the top on NIO. Who was it?

You opened IC LAST thursday on a meme stock to play ER on Tuesday ? 

Jesus man you are either lightyears ahead of me or are dumb AF
I believe in playing safe just my style
The earnings is no different than last quarter and stock price is 1000% higher, so there is no justification for it to be this high. This MFer is going to tank
I was gyrating, is that the wrong move?
Positions?
[deleted]
🤡I sure do believe China’s unaudited report for a company that they have a stake in 🤡
So like honestly what will my NIO 46c 11/27 be worth tmrw after this bullshit
Let me guess. Your balls deep in calls
Can't wait to see how many people learn what IV crush is tomorrow.
How does this effect 11/27 calls and puts? new to this
Ok Andy
I am coming wait for me
The fact that the earnings report is "unaudited" should have you running.
Fuck I always buy in at the worst times though. 

I bought 500 shares at $17.51 a few minutes ago. Need about 1500 more but just incase they actually dont stop going up
My screen says it s red after hours
This Dec
That $7 fake spike on Tesla mad me happy even though I knew it wasn’t real. 11/20 calls bound to expire worthless
Anyone have any rope ?
They have enough cash to survive so who gives a fuck?
They taking profits and moving to other places. It will open at least around 45 and moon this or next week.
NIO will open at $39
Was true a few min ago. So volatile right now.
Dec4
Earnings were 29% above expected, what more did you all want?
Ban
not for long

If NIO drops, then TSLA up.

If NIO is up, then TSLA up.

&#x200B;

= Up
NOT IF IT GOES TO 100 or 5 by FRIDAY!!
I doubt it honestly
Like TSLA's is any better
They sold 13,000 cars last quarter.  Is that good?

Edit: actually 12,206.  They are expecting 16,000 next quarter.
Ah right they don’t have cash accounts on Robin then ?
The one fucking week I don’t buy Tesla weeklies they get in the S&P 500. 

Did I also FOMO at 9:45 and lose most of my money today? You bet.

485C 11/20
Anyone holding calls still? Not sure if this is ok or really bad.
All of them. IV gonna crush
Andthenandthenandthenandthenandthen
So he sold for 90% profit ( that's like 160m profit) and claims he regrets? Lol ok
Ha! Yes.

Congrats you've won a prize!
Lol how the fuck is it “over” actually you’re wrong it’s just begun homie. We’re now past the point of doubting the fact it didn’t go down is proof. 45 is the new flooor for NiO and it’s only going up sorry bear boy
Kinda sad the NIO meme will be RIP for a few weeks now 😔

Machine learning for trading? No one knows what’s going to happen. Save your money and flip a coin.
$NIO open tomorrow at $50 and closes at $60 is my best guess of what will happen.

Shit in your bed or ban. Mods?
There are programs to help people pay for vet bills. Also, don't buy options if you don't have enough to cover a fucking vet bill. Try saving for a three month emergency fund before gambling for a lambo.
great DD
Probably would be a good time to buy some leaps after ER though.
Beat the rumor to the punch... everyone was silent on tsla last week... and this sub is never silent on tsla.
Thanks dude
This retard didnt get the memo on “DD”, huh?
Was there any news for weed stocks today?
Well we live in 2020 already, if I got my math correct right here then that means nio is going to sky rocket tomorrow because of earning calls
You got issues if you're this worked up over other people's decisions.
That's my girlfriend bro. Yea... we're out of milk.

It will prolly hit 70 maybe 80 by end of year but yea it’s going places in 2021 might even touch 200
I had $20k into baba calls that are now worth 10

NIO killing the game...only been delivering cars since 2018 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Prolly cause its market cap is way less
false
Might buy at $20, maybe, maybe at $15 for real though. This earnings report is ever so slightly better than last quarter but barely. But last quarter their stock was 3.50. Plus every day that passes a new competitor enters the market.
Ok boomer
NIO will never go below 40 that is the floor right now is only gone go up might even hit 100 by end of year
Why only 8%?
Fuck nikola go buy NIO
lol there so many overbloated POS, but building a castle in the sky... works for a while

The earning calls has not even started just sit back and chill

Gonna watch my M calls keep raking it in.  short squeeze + favorable earnings forecasted on Thursday + potential reinstatement of dividend.  Gonna go wild.
So cringy..
I think XPEV has sold more cars than Nio lol

  NIO NIO NIO TO THE 🌝 AS FUCK
price can only go up. u all good
What happened? Lost your whole account on gambling?
How are you down on oil.  Shit is printing money.
Big deal here is their net loss is getting lower and lower. When they finally turn a profit that will be huge.
Hope you make Tendies.
NIO has earnings today.
I thought this was a casino wtf
Oh that's smart. Usually I do it near lunch time, just cause that's when I'm free. I'll remember that on the next retard IV stock for sure

how the FUCK did you even get to the point where your returns are in 100k-1mm?
did you run a business before getting into trading or did u save up?

Tiny red dildos, so cute.

I hope no boomers held Nio positions. They’re about to have a stroke seeing chart.
Ford 350 you show them king!
I hope, daily and 4 hour is so fucking oversold. I don’t know how much lower it can get but obviously infinite. I’ll let them cook in the oven.
You will still buy too high
Why would it matter if he votes no or yes if it failed anyway?  Couldnt they bring it up again anyway?
Shit in your hands and clap let me know what happens
So you can print money tomorrow
No fomo.  Many autists here don’t seem to acknowledge the fact that actual S&P 500 inclusion doesn’t happen until 12/21, so while I think index funds can still start picking up shares between now & then (right?), the real organic growth won’t start until next year.  I took one look at those sky high premiums and decided I’m waiting for a pullback, then probably buying a couple long calls that should be sitting pretty next year.
"the call will save us" "50 EOD tomorrow" "It's moving refresh"
dont even say that. im literally losing a percent every 20 minutes.
Same thing happened to pltr. Tanked after earning the ripped the next day
Ahoy xjayroox! Nay bad but me wasn't convinced. Give this a sail:

me need AAPL, QQQ, n' TAN t' stay flat or only 1-2% fer thar rest o' thar week since me sold covered calls n' want t' keep me shares n' premium

Meanwhile, me need PLTR n' PLUG t' motherfucking soooooarrr
Theta burn going to hurt bad tomorrow for Nio holders 🥴
Big brain plays
Ok so since I’m always right bears listen this time. If you want to make money stop thinking like a gay fucking bear and buy xpeng and nio SHARES ASAP as soon as market opens tommorow. In a few months enjoy your doubled money
Y’all some dumb asses.
NIO will never go below 40 that is the floor right now is only gone go up might even hit 100 by end of year

You got the classic WSB mentality still, that’ll change with time
Yes. But so are puts lol
I need AAPL, QQQ, and TAN to stay flat or only +1-2% for the rest of the week since I sold covered calls and want to keep my shares and premium

Best part is trevor still has his shares. No brainer what the con artist will do with them
Unaudited - what a joke
Elon made me feel like a god today
If you buy it back or roll it now, you will lose money for sure. If you will wait, there is a chance that it might not get assigned..(buy the rumour sell the news) 
If I were you and have enough money in the account, I would sell put for same strike price and date. This way you will collect twice the premiums for either getting shares or selling your shares. I think tesla share price will be less volatile next week compare to this week
I hope NIO falls so hard then I’ll buy.
Has anyone here taken a machine learning for trading class in college. My program offers it but I’m not really sure how useful it might actually be seems kinda niche
Long term play, PLTR or ABNB?

What kind of theta strategy would have made out with nio?
Didn’t pltr basically do the same thing Nio is doing tonite.....15 percent uptick next week lol
Shares
Not looking great. Expectations were so high there was no way they were meeting them. Not to mention it’s already up 1000%. It’s gonna be murder tomorrow morning
shoulda wrote all ya retards nio calls for tomorrow
Didn't they still only sell 12,000 cars in 3 months?
How are my Nio boys doing
Sounds like such bad infosec that he such be thankful it happened now and learned his lesson before he had anything of real value to steal
Im holding a Dec 15c on FVAC so im curious how this will play out
IV is about to destroy you
300c homie
NIO did great on earnings this shit is the real deal. 50 EOW after everything settles u always see earnings crush then dip.
You made me look and realize U mooned today while no one was watching.
Y’all still shorting NIO 🤭😂
People are really still optimistic on NIO? It’s over yall
I yeeted my savings account into oblivion in two weeks and quickly learned not to gamble with my own money. If you’re just chasing the rush, wheeling 5k will give you enough premiums to be safely retarded.

Lol do you not know how to read I sold on that massive pump this afternoon like i said i would. Enjoy the IV crush. 🤡🤡🤡
Lol @ all the fomos at the top of nio
Thanks for the advice dad
I actually have 90 calls for January, but 75 is the floor for her in this range.
I bought stonks, figured I could make a quick $3-4K.  I am now down $3k.
Just a friendly reminder that stocks outside of EV make money too =) https://i.imgur.com/d4xQnic.png
I posted a long NIO DD couple days ago, gets deleted every single time, the sub flooded with retard questions and tiny gains. Would rather see some good memes
Anyone else notice 500billion of jan msft calls bought today?
U gunna get IV crushed if it doesn't drop more
Is it really a dichotomy, or is it a giant circle. We find WSB and then eventually end up living in a garden shed.

Yes expect to get destroyed by iv crush stock down 3.8% as of writing this as well. Did you hold calls?
Fake news
This isnt mooning cause ER was already priced in. Anyone holding shares are in great shapes. Anyone with weekly options are fucked.
Neither NIO won
I think you are fucked
stocktwits
Its still going down
If you purchased NIO shares or calls $47+ and held through ER, you deserve any loss coming your way and should start focusing on something else in your life.
NIO holders grasping at every straw 😂😂😂
battle is still raging
yeah, true.... But looking at how much you could've made :( always shitty feeling. Need to just think of gains as gains
ain't gonna be no PLTR dip. +8% in pre-market tomorrow. watch.
NIO is moving +/- 5%.

oh dont worry you will be shitting yourself tomorrow, this is  almost identical to what happened for  RKT's first  earnings, it  looked fine AH but pre market and during the market it fell off a cliff, went from 33+ to  23 in about 12 hours

I'm always in and out
I love you
The only way I was ahead of the curve is because I hopped into calls on stocks before they became mainstream on WSB. Stocks like Corsair and PLTR were only mentioned a few times and that's when I hopped into longer term calls. Now they're so ITM I need to figure out whether to roll forward to a higher strike, or exercise to shares. Now I had NIO $12 calls a while back but they expired worthless and I decided to leave it alone so that's been going well for me 🙃
I don’t understand what happened to their cash? Like form last quarter their assets, mainly cash, disappeared and nothing else was much out of the bien.
Sorry NiO bears specifically
Options traders love volatility.
Average down then.
Not a bad thing
$48p why are you bragging about this? It’s absolutely nothing
solid dd
There is so much money to be made from turning this into a tv show
Lmao oh shit man I opened half them Thursday 🤣 nearly had a heart attack Friday at 10:30 and another 2 hrs before close.
 
Stabilized today though so I opened more. No clue honestly since the call isn't til later. Lot can still happen
I was promised +/- 30% wtf I can’t jack off to this
👋🏻
Oh right. I knew it was this week. My b
NIO made profit for the first time, it’ll open green
Probably safer to sell credit put spreads, since this might not rocket up that fast, but the floor at 400 is pretty stable.
I FOMO'd into TSLA pre-market (stonks)....down -3.5%. Sigh.
still some loss i bet
Yet you couldnt explain. Bottom line is im up idiot.

I hope not I bought 11/27 46c at the last fucking minute cause I’m not gay

if nio was gonna dump itd be happening now. only up from here with conference call later gonna release some juicy news and pump it up
Nio pump all the way, now all the weak hands are gone.
So did nio call holders or put holders win?
My brain is now bigger for having read that
Keep telling yourself that 😂

No longer overhyped. Already met the hype and price will continue to rise as earnings rise
Hoping to cash out my SPY calls and buy the NIO/PLTR dip tomorrow.
Yeah it has major fuckin support so far sub 19, but the share unlock is going to send it crashing through that. 20p should print though regardless.

Can you imagine having fuckloads of shares locked up just reading all the hit pieces and seeing Trevor's response and the whole time realizing you bought into a scam and you couldn't do anything about it this entire time and then finally when you can finally fucking sell.... yeah, you're selling.
👍
Earnings never go well 99% of time
It'll be back before next earnings. Interested in seeing how their GPU stock goes
Jesus
of course priced in. even if it wasn't it had to move 20% for any calls or puts to be profitable.
Ahh time for the quarterly wsb IV crush lesson. Last one was battery day. Yes puts get crushed too. Sell premium when iv is high ya ding dongs

If weekly, absolutely.

Theta gang master race
As long as NIO keeps selling more cars, I see it as a good investment. Who gives a shit what the price is right now? It’ll likely keep moving up and down as everybody panics
Thanks for your advice mate. Ive deleted the app and hope to be more productive, stop overfocusing on the candles, and get my focus back on track. Cheers

Seems the Chinese have finally learned the American trick of beating earnings and dropping

First rule of gambling: Don’t risk anything that you can’t afford to lose.

Also, if there’s the potential to make money fast, then the odds of it being successful will balance out that potential. 

Options aren’t the problem. Your understanding of how the system works is the problem. Either leave this phase of your life and go back to being conservative with your savings, or take the time to learn about options to increase your probability of success. The more I learned about options, the more selective I’ve become with when I decide to a position.

I’m a pussy for not buying puts
Are you bear or bull? Go to your designated wood chipper
how did you get this post to be an announcment
Based off of this NIO earnings report and overall market sentiment going forward in the 2020-2030 decade, I have decided that my position is now LONG.  I was going to play earnings but this company is the real deal.

im available from 9-10 am
Whichever one of you dropped the hint for FVAC over the weekend.  Thank youuu.
And corn continue to be up.
This is a $35 stock. I’m buying more puts.
I feel like if SPY was going for 370 it would have by now
Yeah, there are also people who buy Lambos with option profits and others who buy half a car called Solo.
And down again!!! Weeee!!

You got to wait for analyst reports though. 

LI went down after their earnings but after XPEV reported, it had halo effect and rose quite a bit. Then Credit Suisse analyst issued very favorable report on both and they went up by more than 30% on the same day

Anyone else diamond hands their TSLA weeklies and now questioning the decisions they've made in their life?
Bc Soros says he regrets buying it. It’s actually a shit company. 17 years in business and still can’t turn a profit. Like wtf
The reaction on NIO after earnings is very different from the other Chinese EVs like  Li Auto and Xpeng. 

And yet the earnings are good?

Or was it already priced in?
Theta gang won with nio

No its not down 3.4%
why AMD puts? i went for late December calls instead.
NIO to 58
I fucking hope so
NIO flat AH sorry bears u were wrong on this too 😞
In reality, you are talking about politicizing the DOJ and Dept. of State even further.  I believe that we should only be throwing elected officials in jail for serious infractions, not for choosing to use personal email instead of state servers.  At most, all that was identified was a security risk.

In reality, the DOJ, Dept. of State, FBI, etc. don't have unlimited resources and have to pick and choose what to investigate.   To spend so much time on something so useless with virtually no implications for the average person, while ignoring all of the serious abuses of power going on in the current administration, would be a mistake and would not serve the American people.  That being said, the people involved in the Clinton server have security violations flagged on any future application for security clearance.  I believe this is a sufficient step to protect the nation's security interest.

With regard to the current administration, it's hard to even keep track of all of the conflicts of interest and possible abuses of power, but here is a list of 30 open investigations:

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/13/us/politics/trump-investigations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/13/us/politics/trump-investigations.html)

My position is not an "inherent tendency toward communist mental gymnastics," but the result of weighing the particular allegations, details and facts of the actual activities being investigated.  I haven't accused you of being a reactionary moron, and I find it telling that ultimately, your only point of contention is that you think I fall on the wrong end of the political spectrum.  To call me a communist because I don't see the Clinton email thing as that big of a deal is laughable;  first, Clinton was unquestionably running as a moderate, so if I was defending her because of political affiliation, it would not follow that I am a "communist".  And second, my political leanings have little to do with actually evaluating the charges here.  As you've demonstrated through this conversation, the only allegations that any danger or improper influence was involved in the email thing is nonsense that has never had any basis in reality.  China, personal gain, etc. - there's just no evidence for any of it, aside from whatever you read from the echo chambers on Twitter and Facebook.

IV crush is gonna make everything cry since the stock didn't move
Sold a naked 70C 11/20 for fun just to inverse you guys since i had no skin in the NIO game prior. Premiums were ridiculous on this shit, everyone is ded after this cept theta gang :o
NIO gave me a little hope. Yeah I’m wrecked. It’s been fun
Ha, fuck. Thank you!
nice profit, wish I had balls to go more NTM
buy more OSTK regardless if it dips
Where is the dude who punched the wall? Does ur other hand hurt now?

Lmao we went down 0.5% after a months of ridiculous gain and you can hear the feds aggressively printing again
RARE POGGO STICK PATTERN ON NIO!!!!
To think I almost did a strangle on NIO. Fuck me. It's like life is telling me "hahah you think your money is safe today???...it was never yours, you fool"
They call it NYE-oh out there
1.4 ea so only like 10k total but i’ll take it. Ain’t risking big capital on meme earnings lmao
Welp. Guess I’m long NIO shares now.
Need a 100pt drop on spy to break even on my 11/20 puts :(

edit need it to be at 350 to clarify not 250
NIO getting into the Christmas spirit with all this green and red.
GM Delivers 665,192 vehicles in the third quarter, profitable as fuck, has a dividend, and worth less than NIO who delivers 12.206 vehicles. Makes sense!
RH is poopoo for spreads unless the option chain is super liquid. Handles SPY well and the retarded IV expiries well. Everything else is a crapshoot in regards to getting a decent fill
Thank you! I need to learn this. Appreciate your input and help.
We closing near 350
NIO took a fat shit on the option holders
You know when people are saying the conference call will save them they're fucked 🤣
After big blowouts in the others the beat might not be enough. NIO has been running up all month. It was at $26 a month ago.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/wccftech.com/intel-and-amd-x86-mobility-cpus-destroy-apples-m1-in-cinebench-r23-benchmark-results/amp/ just gonna leave this here....
do i need to care about this if i have shares
Its ok SPY you move from 360 when you feel like it.
ER out at 4PM, call is at 7.
now we have thinking person here!  moses are you here to save us ?

At close 😂
Always did.
Buy more RIOT if it dips. Otherwise continue the hodling.
I am not theta ganging it. Oh looks its dropping again woohooo!
tbh with where the price is at and how it has been trading, the stock is either going to be biggly up or down after the call.
I have thousands of dollars in FDs and ate apple cores left over by my housemates today. What does that make me? 🤔
They killed it, as expected
Wheres the proof?

Only way that’s true is if there are retards out there that didn’t buy puts at $49 but decided to hop in head first at $46 lol

....alright, how many of y’all did it?

I stayed away from tsla and nio today. Slept and woke up to open January amd puts and caved and bought March 300 baba calls. Nasdick looks like it wants to retrace to 11500.

Whether a company beats or misses earnings is really irrelevant when determining if the stock moves up. Its about how the individual parts the business are doing for example MSFT can beat but if azure growth slowed the earnings beat is irrelevant
It's still 3% up today
how do you guys beat me to the downvotes? I just refreshed.
STONKS ONLY GO UP 🐻🌈
so everything on my list was like 5- 20% green... how was spy red rofl
Are you ready for another 10% in PLTR tomorrow?
I'm going to pick up some tomorrow for sure was eye'in it today.

Still only 12000 cars sold and they lost a billion or 14 cents a share.  Gross profit of only $585MM. I don't see anything in the financials mooning the price tonight.

PLTR screwing me more than NIO atm

12/4 20c is printing 💰
You woulda been better off holding and buying more if it dipped especially on a stock like NIO but instead you sold your positions trying to time an earnings report. If it moons after the call big RIP my homie. Shoulda setup some

Is that like Ford or something? Only heard of NIO.
Ya could def catch a bid, honestly it’s run up reminded me a lot of TSLA before Q2 earnings. Their great reports were more or less riced in.
So when are we buying our NKLA puts? 1.6m shares unlocked dec 1st - 3rd
32 :( was looking at 0.3 delta iron condors, but was like fuck NIO could actually go 20% either way, probs safe to add a safety factor

Why are you buying otm calls. The higher strike prices make the contracts less valuable if the price goes up. Wtf are you doing. You should be buying the 14c or 15c if you think it’s going up. Jesus Christ. Somebody save him!!
I will be buying more BJs and will be getting paid for it

Look at it boys, look at all the bears saying “IV crush”, “theta gang wins”, “flat”. Do these 🌈🐻 really not know? Do they really not know we have a conference call at 7? A conference call where they may announce global expansion? Boys, the fun has just begun.
Everyone know that those industries are SOL until next year. So the market is thinking 8-12 months out for them. With all the vaccine news out theyre just starting their recovery now. Any news about shutdowns is priced in.

not really. if u had a strangle and didnt sell the weekly, you could have adjusted and got out ok when it dipped the week after
Can someone wake up old man BABA. It’s time to moon, and he’s been in hibernation with the bears for too long

Nah, the biggest mistake of your trading career is not clicking sell at the moment you made this comment. GTFO while you still can

Works with usa gov in many ways and has their support,
Thiel funded 17 years this company until now


I guess pltr is a buy?
Almost the same as you.

Anyone else pick up a ton of shares on that Nio spike down. Lmfao free money

The boomers from r/investing and r/stock probably out here butt hurt they missed out on NIO and PLTR
That's weird, because IV crush should be what's making your puts poop
The hub will have a NIO channel dedicated to said gangbangs.
TSLA fucked me into the dirt
I thought I read they didn't beat eps. Guess inner 🌈🐻 read it wrong

anyone else throw a few bucks at 🅱️oin every now and then?  buy and hold?
I put in a limit order for shares at 45.50 and didn't expect to execute, boy do I feel silly. Oh well, original buy in was 41, still winning
shhhh, don't tell em
Ni Hao!
NIO making a Tesla sign
Uh no.

The options were pricing in like a 20 percent move in the stock.

IV crush is going to be huge, unless they were leaps.
Look on nio website
I see some of you fucks made it on to the product reviews section.
some indie band from the 90's that all the pot heads don't shut up about???
I'm losing hope for my BABA calls.
Buy NIO
It seems like Soros sold a long time ago???? People are saying he sold in the 9s, if true that’s fucking hilarious.
Given the fact Citi just gave a buy sign for Xpeng and Li Auto with much higher targets for 2021 (2 days after ER), i think it's safe to say they'll do the same with Nio. Just have to time the call action right on Friday for next week. Should see some positive movement that will be a quick buck on Monday (or even friday this week).
Withdraw everything in your account in cash and see how much of it you can burn in 5 minutes. You'll then end up with exponentially more money than you will after buying this call. No need to thank me for the play!
Yolo pizza hut got it

WSB Answer: NIO.
BUY NIO NOW
Good to know, thanks! I do think spreads seem generally better to do but just got frustrated to no end when I tried to do it before. Not sure if this time doing it on the web vs. before on the phone made a difference. Since I didn't get into NIO, hope TSLA moons and NIO somehow flatlines, lol.
Unfortunately yes, it'll have some residual value tomorrow as positions close but unless it hits the breakeven of $53 by 11/20 it'll be a loss. Residual value maybe $.50 if it stays around this $47 but that's estimation from prior experiences.
Puts on your medical knowledge
Lmao nah neither but I did throw a couple bills into some  cheap NIO calls eod 😂😂
Y'all got played.
Ahhh so the option writers will make all the money...totally legal.
Guys what happened to amzn today? I thought the prescription drug news would be huge
See ZM aug 31. Thats why.
As always
Bruh idk what nio wants to do
Woof- PRPL blasted off today!
IV, implied volatility, goes up big time before 'unknown' events like Apple events, TSLA battery day and earnings. As soon as the unknown becomes known IV comes crashing down. Some of the NIO options had like 200% + IV and it'll be like half that tomorrow which lowers the options price by a lot no matter if you bought puts or calls so basically everybody gets fucked except people that sold those options
No fuck you, let it go down to $420.69 so I can load up on those fucken $500C. Let it fall, please let it fall, please.
JMIA calls tomorrow, guarantee no ragrats

How many of you NIO call holders were googling "bankruptcy" at 4:07pm and "new yachts for sale" at 4:21pm?
I want to thank the person who suggested Macy's Calls.  


Made a fuck ton today on their 10% swing.
Finally NIO over and broke a bunch of people. Next stock.
Hey man idk how this shit works but I'm up over 100%.
I’m sweating bullets on these TSLA calls I picked up this morning 🤦‍♂️
What a wild after hours 🤪glad I sold at the top I couldn’t take anymore of this shit
IV crush is nice but won’t make you a millionaire my dear retard
IV increases when a stock moves in large distances one way or another (it's more volatile) this makes us retards want the option more so it increases value because it could swing again in your favor. if the swinging stops or goes flat, your option loses more value than you bought it at (iv crush)
Yes sir.
Wait i forgot lessons in IV tomorrow ill take notes
Everybody trying to fuck everybody else so hard. The market can’t catch up.
NIO chart just made the Tesla logo. Illuminati
Stop being a pussy
this is not about to age well
If your holding stock I agree with a bull sentiment. If you’re holding short dated calls you’re fucked.
Tomorrow will be a good opportunity to load up. IV is gonna plummet like crazy
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Once details come out about NIO earnings, expansion in europe, growth etc she will take flight and continue to grow to $50+ in next two weeks.
George Soros hate Peter Thiel who helped Trump destroy Clinton in 2016. 

This is a payback for the pizzagate.
Don’t worry we got NIO JACK TO TAKE IT OUT hahahahahahahaha
The call is gonna be in Chinese right?
Where do you even find earnings reports?
Yes https://ir.nio.com/static-files/39d3112f-3cb4-4ed5-aade-b040b368719a
Hang onto those shares until next year
Theyre pretty solid. I interviewed with them a while ago so I did some research. The only thing thats holding them back is the amount of contracts they have/acquiring more clients. As soon as they announce another big contract theyll pump. Most of their clients are government and from what ive heard their software for data aggregation/analysis has no rival
Vaccines won’t be widely available for a long time and no one is taking cruises anytime soon?

You will learn theta gang is not as low risk as it seems. If you have an 80% chance to make $100 and a 20% chance to lose $400 how much money do you have left on average after 10 trades?
You can still excercise your option though if you're in the money, right? Regardless if you got killed by IV?
ME!
Difference between spy calls and poots
I’m going to hope for the history. That’s one helluva line graph today!
thx
In a couple hours, but figures already posted https://ir.nio.com/static-files/39d3112f-3cb4-4ed5-aade-b040b368719a
I don’t even feel sorry for those who held NIO puts/calls through earnings 😒😒😒
Needed a post like this to feel better about my positions
Please tell me NIO will be below $45 by tomorrow. Sincerely a put holder.
What's a google suggested password?  Like a password manager?
A silent retard is no retard at all. 
The reeee will not be silenced.
Could not agree more, play the meme stonks but do not necessarily “invest” in them. Capturing momentum has made me tons of money this summer but I also exit positions at a preset target and either never look back or look for a pullback to re enter
They had a loss of .12 per share. Which beats estimates of .17 per share.
Need to wait for guidance.
This fuckin guy
Smart
Thank you to whoever bought the 47.5c from me :)

NIO spelled differently is ONI
Buy puts on Tesla bro
PCOAB, FASB and SEC are all shit as well. 
Look at all the scams US companies have pulled. 

We are all cut from the same cloth.
ELI5:

IV make put and call option price big

after ER, IV go down bigly

in turn, make option price smol

(even if you were right)

like if you buy big stonk call for 60 strike for 200 buck, and stonk go from 45 to 60, your 60 strike call might now only be worth 200 buck still cuz IV go down alot
Institutions trading NIO collectively fucking each other in the ass
The more volatile the higher the IV the higher the IV the higher the greeks
If it doesn't drill by morning I guess that's pretty bullish. Still a lot of hours to go though.
Priced in by a lot
I prefer it 💦
1/15/2020. 46C breakeven is 56.75. Any chance to atleast stop being negative? Even the height of today couldn't pull me out.
[here](https://ir.nio.com/financials/quarterly-results)
Who's ready for a big end of year rally. S&P 500 is going to 4,000 at the very least
 So pretty much it’s all going to depend on future projections during the call huh?
Truth
I have shares so none of this affects me. But it was so funny to see the premature celebrations.
seriously? I cant tell if this is an actual serious question or just the usual retardation im used to seeing.
Not to mention this is unaudited numbers, so guaranteed they are cooked knowing Chinese companies. That’s why they about to get delisted unless they let auditors that aren’t Chinese look at their books. Honestly, just doesn’t look good to me.
Itm calls bruh. Bruh.
Looks flat to me bruh
You used convicted instead of convinced in your first post
if you retards think it will go 60, does it even matters
I came here for this comment.
I like it. Can we go back to su bae and all the classics
I close em out day after earnings 

42-39 put side 52-55 call side

Put up $150 per IC
Hahahaha
NIO earnings call starts at 7pm so there might be some additional upside afterwards.

For retards who think the call is conducted in Chinese, it isn’t. It’s done in English
They beat EPS...si?
You're on it
Wut if dey dnt sale.??
Good, now he deleted his account... I think.
Enjoy the IV crush on your puts tomorrow LOOL
7pm est
TSLA will definitely do something
RIOT Looks good. I just picked up 50x ET $6c 11/27 for a bargain. If it hits the target I'm projecting, I'll no longer be smallstreetbets
Might as well find a day job. Investing isn't for you.
Thank you for coming back in time to tell us. 65C 11/20
Sideways from the looks of it. It goes sideways and anyone who traded YEET options gets to have their portfolio expire worthless
Keep watching
I think Donny Pump got his nickname for a reason
If it does follow the memeing of PLTR, we could see Nio at $65 next week
Well Iv was nuts, so I sold Cash Secured Puts :) Bullish but fuck IV
I’m holding
I was up 700 at one point today and diamond dicked my Tesla calls. Please let it pay off.
Looks like nio earning is good, but not good enough.
Moon obv

for real, i'm boutta delete RH i can't take this
They should have the Barstool Guays in the gallery talking shit.

yep same. i was up 14% today and wasnt satisfied. threw it back in to get more and lost it all and more. eventually ill learn. or maybe i wont
dont worry it will end red and tomorrow come back down to 43-44 range
Theta gang wins again
basically when IV is higher, people will think the stock will be extremely volatile and make large moves - this is bc of uncertainty, previous large increase or drops in prices, events coming up , etc... b/c people think it’s going to move so much, it becomes “priced in” through IV. Therefore, options become more expensive. For these options to become profitable, the stock has to MOVE MORE than what people already think (IV basically). Right now, the stock needs to move more than 15 percent, I think - approximately (it varies with option strike price).

Additionally, IV crush occurs because the uncertainty is gone after earnings and people don’t expect the stock to move as much anymore
Yes...but you're home here
I appreciate that sir
Cost of tuition is a lot more than that.

Would be so fucking funny if nio was completely flat tomorrow
Regardless im buying calls tomorrow Nio is either on sale bigly or green by EOW
Said it as a meme earlier but I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up closing this week near $370. Gonna look into buying SPY $369 calls tomorrow.
Na we fine
I'm the Grinch bitch. So yes, I'm excited

But I dunno.  I'm fucking retarded.
Looks like NIO option holders paid tuition for the options trading academy. Tomorrow's course - IV Crush 101
not a bad idea.... market was discounting stimulus prior to wave 2 ... big fat blue balls...  not sure what to do bc spy could stay flat longer than my wendy's check can provide, may have to see if mcd is hiring soon

I mean. Market open will decide this. All you autists care too much about AH. Tesla slapped 460 in pre. I copped puts at 455 at open. Closed at 437. This shit volume isn’t enough
So the nio report is good right?
We already knew that but I think a lot of that was priced in with XPEV and LI earnings. I wouldn’t be surprised to see it tank a bit. They’re all 3 massively overvalued as is.
lol as soon as I typed this... spy went up rofl... now at like 10% haha damn was quick
nio making an M shape earnings
Still a minimum of ~20% gain (based on closing price today) with that scenario for the weekly, likely somewhere between 25-40% gain.
Y’all do know NIO beat earnings by a lot? After tmr it’ll start goin up
NIO will still go up.  Too many TA autists who read charts instead of quarterly reports.
Im in Lowes too. My thought is they'll do fine and release on a morning without the baggage of bad October retail numbers.

TGT too.
Well boys, what's this greedy son of a bitch's angle here. Seems like he's trying to orchestrate a selloff, he might have opened a possible short position.
Share price is not moving. Both call and put holders are all losers tomorrow.
Basically options have some volatility priced in. There's a chance that the stock could make a big move, which inflates the value of options. After earnings, volatility decreases, so options are less valuable.
Idk what you mean by "we're all fucked". I think you meant to say "The NIO retards on the internet are all fucked
ITS RED AGAIN!
Some dumbass market sold their shares lol
This aged well.  Glad someone here isn't a complete moron.
I don’t know the details, i just follow the meme stock of the week
for us americans, IV is the premium of an option since all other greeks know. Therefore IV is the standard deviation of market price and so higher IV is more premium or cost of options but once that standard deviation is reduced so is the price.

This standard deviation event being earnings. So regardless, IV will most likely drop and crush options premiums
I just picked up a few 20C 1/15/21 when it was $18.20, if anyone was wondering why it dropped towards end of day.
Tomorrow next to my onlyfans link

nope, u better buy rope.
Lambo with vanity plates "PLTR•TRD"

Tomorrow I make even more PLTR plays with my NIO profits (sold eod).
It had a nice day, profit taking is allowed
True
Guessing a fund or huge holder sold, and maybe bought back. Not sure. It’s hard to really understand the short term of nio. long term seems to be the best bet
holding PLTR 11/20 19c and 20c... what are the odds these print?
so where does NIO go from here? ER is out of the way and it seems like it showed the finger to all the bears out there.
you pay more for options when a stock swings around a lot, cause that means there's higher potential gains. if the stock price doesn't change at all then you just lose the premium you paid.
Yes
That’s the spirit 😂😂

Everyone is still looking at each other trying to decide what to do so it's just going to sit there and do nothing. Shares and straddles win

I fear that you are right.
I agree.  I’m going all in on SPX puts tomorrow, but I’m hoping for one last push up tonight/tomorrow before it starts to fall.

when is nio ER?

318M on volume and they sold 17,000 cars
is tgt gonna go uppy tmrw?
Sold 6 FD weeklies on NIO thanks for the money WSB!
Cause NIO wasn’t going to tank just 15%. It was going to be a huge gap up or gap down. Probably nothing in between
People still investing in meme stocks show how much money people have on the sidelines waiting to invest. In the 2000s dot com crash, almost every tech stock were like this and only the few solid companies made it out. Keep gambling, but in the end, the solid stocks will make it through and the meme stocks get replaced by new hype.
Might pump pretty hard premarket. Their Q4 guidance is very positive and so is their Q3 earnings (though we already knew it'd be good)

And it's had a few big dumps to shake out weak hands already.
because they lose money
That’s like saying the left hook is the way to win fights
Tf. Why the hell wouldn’t you buy puts at 455 at open. Damn.
I hope you had diamond hands
6.9k of 50c 12/18. Sold for 300 loss instead of at top. Bought a 12/18 260c baba through my tears.

Nio goes to 50 as all of wsb goes WTF...
Ahahahaha don't worry i m in since 11
Options on earnings always get crushed because the movement implied never actually takes place
ye prob get to 100$ and stop there
Why is ccl still going up wtf is this lol
IV is a measure of how big of a move investors think a stock will move. After earnings, there is less uncertainty to which direction a stock will move. A component of options pricing involves implied volatility(Vega) so this component goes down dramatically which can lead to a large decrease in your options value
Is nio down 7 or 1 it keeps bugging for me
Nio is team theta
It will.
PTLR EOM predictions? I’m saying $21.
Yes, I believe today bleed was amplified by the red indices and lower volume on them. Need some new momentum.
Carry on sucking dick we are busy here come later with this bullshit
I just realized something fucked up. Now that CBAT is rolling with the big boys, it's daily chart looks... exactly like NIO's, complete with a dip and bounce after NIO earnings.

Fuck me, guess I'm team NIO after all.
I'd hold for a fuckin while. They're getting dangerously close to 7 again and again. Only a matter of time before it gets there and stays there.
In reference to what? ETF bubble? Corporate debt bubble? There simply isn’t an “everything” bubble.
Lmaooo if that gets you as excited as Christmas you’re sad as fuck
Dear diary:
Oh I’m hard that I sold those 40p
Bruh IV is currently 250% HOW will there be now IV crush🤡
Sup bby
Wait till we make retard money then yo
Imagine buying options when IV is above 200%. No faster way to throw away money
Theta isn't :)
It’s an insult to actual retarded people
NIO is a long term hold.  I'd much rather see a sustainable, steady 2-4% increase that avoids the circus that has been this past 2 weeks.
EPS doesn't matter as much as guidance right now
Picked up few RIDE puts at close.  Probably fucked.
B won 306
Just pick a fucking team NIO
Buying puts on Tesla inclusion to sP500 news? Are you nuts?
I hope so. Need to get in cheaper
Alright band
go youtube gordon johnson
It happened.
[NIO](https://tenor.com/view/wwe-coffin-world-wrestling-entertainment-gif-17903370)
He ain’t a bear, but he sure is 🌈🌈🌈.
beat, stonks go down... im not sure why we expect anything else. perfectly normal.
Yea. I mean to me it was kind of WSB meme stock so I wasn't dealing with it just casually following it but it was like an unusually steep fall
NOT GOING TO LIE NIO's AH V shape recovery is making my puts poop.
Wow lol

Which one of you cucks posted this?? Lmaoooo
Theta gang, sad I did such far otm 0.05 Delta, was thinking of 0.3 but fuck me
You lost me at "You fucked up mate".
These swings are giving mad stress god damn
No kidding
Goodbye tendies, hello IV crush 😌
Nah lol
Brain as smooth as a marble

Call isn't until 7 PM
I'm retarded but from reading that report NIO posted their first profit right?
You a bear not getting your puts print lmao

Fuck V
nah you good, they still undervalued
Bought tsla calls. Hope they print!!
Oh for sure, if this was a US company I’d be skeptical but probably okay with it. A Chinese company doing this with review from only a Chinese firm makes it impossible for me to put money on them with any confidence.
Apparently yes, by 29%

Right here. Technically I’m the tragedy
Facebook, never heard of it
[deleted]
Yep, it might go up tomorrow, but I'll just wait for my next entry signal. Good luck.
I took profit on palantir shares to buy a 2/2021 $30C at $2.10. I’m gonna get fucked right?
I'm convinced you're stupid
How are my CCL 12/18 17.5 puts lookin😌
Looks like they sold 2,000 more cars than last quarter and are still losing money. Yup, not a drastic difference. Only difference is the stock is literally 15X higher 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 this turd about to get flushed
You can fuck my asshole if that happens
Thanx dude
Rally Pltr tomorrow bois
Beat by 30% is a lot
$NIO $60 tomorrow
Everyone too distracted by NIO to pay attention
It’s not China it’s every hedge fund in the world.
It’s called numbers.
CCL ships are the boat equivalent of Elizabeth Warren
Amen!!
Good lookin out bro
They create panic and then they buy and hope people would jump with them and then they probably close it lol
TSLA 500 EOW u heard it here first. Less shares outstanding + demand up = price up.
Damn ya'll really are wrong about everything
Yes it can. Steady hands my guy.
Palantir puts babyyyyy
Good to take a break.
Hope not
red prolly
I got out all $47 a piece
lol that would just be too good
Seriously the IV was so fucking high on NIO you couldn’t lose by selling puts. It would have to had tanked like 15% for me to even lose money. Easiest money I ever made on the market
Thank homie
I like what you did there
FUCK YOU 🖕
Lol nio IC's printing tomorrow

Clown ass mofos
Nio fucking with my emotions rn.
Meme stock
so are we all fucked
Please wait and watch the AH and premarket movement before you blindly ramble about IV crush. A 10%+ move on guidance and there will be no crushing.
Ayy, thats all I care about 

NIO to $60!
What's the name of the original show?
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of nio retards suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
Why would you not when vaccines are announced
This shit is like hard core porn somebody getting fucked and it’s a joy to watch
Lots of rookies gonna learn about IV crush tomorrow. Feels like Christmas Eve ☺️
So it's tanking tomorrow, right?
will PLTR be red tmrw
Bought in at $11 😎
Sold for profit and bounced....
Calling this sub retarded is a compliment.
I just wheeled the fuck out of NIO
MM just fucked over a ton of retail on NIO.
DRIV is a bot.
Next letter is I. So is that straight up or down?
Rip to both NIO bulls and bears. BABA call holders welcome both of you to the club.
Won’t know shit till market open. People here too used to price setting in AH. Did none of you see tesla today? 460 pre market. I copped some puts at 455 and closed at 437.
I’m at 33 lol, you?
Jack is like a parody of a tech CEO they would've created for Silicon Valley.
DOWNVOTE ME PUSSY. I DOUBLE DOG DARE YA
Holy shit those guys are low energy
good question, maybe one of the mods gave me god-tier status after my other post
this shits coming back down to 43-44
[deleted]
Is that what theta gang is? Sellin options? I’m a fucjin retard
well guess priced in from LI and XPEV
My finger was trembling over the mouse to click sell when NIO went to 43 AH. Was about to be the biggest mistake of my trading career
😠😤 gg bulls
welcome to Robinhood heres your free share of Robinhood
Yep
Just look at their news page.. it is there
Holy they even fucked the share holders
That last 10 minutes of NIO ticker watching just took 10 years off my life.
nio fucking both call and put holders 😂
You should feel stupid for investing in NIO
beat earning expectations by 29%
and shrinking
Sometimes the cat only falls over, but does not actually die. Still salty I bought mine at 47.60 this morning instead of waiting to see if I could get a lower price
Soros selling he sold it due to * not liking the company" at 90% profit? Yee. Not buying it. Soros is much more shady than all Palantirs skeletons in the closet
[deleted]
[deleted]
I wouldn’t be russian into that one
Some NIO bear gang with his foot up his ass
Calls on literally anything, obviously. What the fuck else would you do?
Guys I bought PLTR March calls so you’re welcome now it will drill
CC?
😂
I got slaughtered on TSLA today.  Bought calls early.  Stock fell, I bailed.  -$3,500.  Made some panicked option trades to get back to -$1,500.  Lesson learned.
Unless it hits like 53, yes.
bullish, soros is the anti-christ
Bought puts mid day and sold them before close for 25% profit. Only a retard would hold 230% IV through earnings
Beat EPS estimates by 29%
Not sure if it was smart to hold yet .... holding shares like a boomer cuz that NIO IV was high as hell
Any boomers in on $SLB $HAL $BKR. Looking to have both oil sectors/clean energy to straddle my big milkers on. Lmk boomers
I wanted to play theta but I decided against it cause I would’ve been shitting bricks all day on the off chance on a big move up. Sold my shares at $47 average earlier today too for 150% gain so I can’t complain too much
We mooning NIO bois
[deleted]
All good, buy the dip. I have 11 shares at 259 average cost and am going to buy more while BABA is on sale
Let me know if you find an answer lol
[removed]
Unfortunately I just know Python(I study Finance and  my programming skills are therefore very limited). Which site do you use that connects your code with the market and executes it automatically?
What kind of bullshit heiroglyphics is this??
So is there just a room full of MMs playing NIO all just having a seizure rn?
The IV on NIO was over 200%. Unless you had shares, bull or bear, you lost.
it’s not about the president lol
I had a 12.5c 5/21/21 and sold it when they hit $15. FML
... oh yeah, low probability that it does one of the two things that it has done multiple times over the last month or so 😭😂
I've picked up a lot of BABA shares last few days. It hasn't done much for me but hopefully it will later this week. Otherwise I might even get call options if it goes down more.
already self diagnosed at retarded for not understanding what’s happening so i’m clear
Drops to ~35
Except those ZM earnings aug 31
lol Earnings, what earnings lol
NGL watching NIO AH is better than last night's MNF
Something tells me cruise goers don’t really care much about catching diseases. May want to rethink it.
#good news everyone! 
We’re going to have a lot less members by tomorrow morning. I’m gonna start assigning autists to double shifts.Everyone gather for their job.
Niope
Theta gang wins this round
[deleted]
You know what as long as nobody audits them and the stock keeps rising we're probably in the clear
That's not comforting
🔥🐌🔥
[deleted]
Did they stated high guidance for the next year?
no pedos allowed in wsb
yo keep it down.  WMT lowkey making a run at AMZN.
So did NIO get an earnings beat or what? I can’t find a straight answer on the internet anywhere
No.  [Today](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvukyv/its_been_exactly_one_year_since_the_first_case_of/) somebody posted a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/jvukyv/its_been_exactly_one_year_since_the_first_case_of/gcn5htr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in that thread.  I scrolled down and saw an over-confident comment that made me curious.
The 420 rule in full effect
$50 by Jan!
I just keep consistently making losing plays good thing they are huge losses but damn. I suck at this now
Fuck it lads, I am 100 convicted that we are gonna fly to 60 tomorrow
Lmfao Soros sold out of PLTR because of public back lash wtf
NIO after hours looks like an option writer's dream come true!
Bought a couple calls, losing money anyways lol
High iv = no tendies
46.8%
Yup.  I got out at EOD yesterday (maybe I should have waited until this morning).  I'll have my popcorn ready for the fight at 7.
55% down on tsla fomo calls
Too much if you ask me. Im 100% pltr
Thats exactly what I am saying. Sorry for your loss. ❤
Can someone ELI5 me IV and why NIO options traders are going to get fucked by that? I'm from Europe so I'm betting on CFDs not options, therefore have no fucking idea how IV influence your gains and losses.
Lol so glad I sold NIO
yep thats why I sold my 100 PLTR shares...even if I didnt wanna!
Thank you for your tendies
Who the fuck is that guy?! Some motherfucker is downvoting everyone. Who hurt you?
Lol this guy lost money today was it TSLA or NIO?
Earnings are in Chinese! No one understands it!
nice now when I am expecting big gains I can hedge with puts on Robinhood just in case it crashes that day and I can't sell anything.
Theta gang got big NIO boners
bought at 3.98 out at 15, but i feel i've lost
It's making the Tesla sign.

It's either gonna crash, moon, or go right when it's done.

My money is on it going right
NIO TO THE 550 EOD
PLTR going down AH
He hasn’t even won yet
Theta gang, theta gang, theta gang!!
My heart can’t take this NIO volatility
Nice, thanks.
Gay bear downvoting 

 1 downvote=nio 1 dollar gain
Only if you want to make money. Just don't be a greedy and hold these too long.
Quick!  
Someone who can read, tell me what it says!
opposite of bad.
Birkenstocks, i ain’t even mad
U guys are IDIOTS if you don't think this shit will be 500 EOW. There gonna be less shares outstanding cuz they need it for the S&P indexes. Less supply + demand up = price up. Simple economics u fks get $$$
And it doesn’t even expire tomorrow

Anybody else listening to duel of the fates while watching the NIO chart?
Guess who hedged their Nio Calls with 11/20 puts?
[deleted]
but muh nio calls!! ermm...i mean poots!!
WTF is a GoJo?
This is the way
Only annual audits are audited by a cpa firm. Quarterly reports are unaudited, but reviewed. The Chinese B4 that audits them hasn’t been part of a huge fraud like luckin coffee (yet). That being said, I don’t know if anyone can truly believe whatever numbers NIO or any Chinese company will report if it’s audited by a non American B4.
Not share holders
Sell the news dickhead
Guidance af 😩
Shares ppl!!!!
Feeling better for you. Honestly this is a long term play, shares or LEAPS. This company will crumble or go to Mars....much much more likely the second option
Financials came out already. Beat expectations. 100+% YOY growth.
earnings are out retard
Pltr shares mate
If 60 year olds are what get you going, sure
*LAUGHS IN LEAPS*
so tomorrow red or green
This is kinda hilarious, regardless of my mini panic attacks every 45 seconds
Who tf is buying cruise stocks? Wtf???
ok thanks
Lol are u being serious rn?
Yes. Sell strangles instead
*tips fedora and puts cat ear headphones back on head
Tesla joining S&P500? Had no idea seeing the hundred other posts about it
Dude they're perfectly cucking bears and bulls right now. I hate bears but id rather they win than theta gang, fuck theta gang.
Doesn’t mean shit. Rkt almost doubled expected earnings then took a dump on call holders
Right
punched a table when nio plummeted. i now feel stupid my hand hurts
You realize you’re fucked yet?
does it give hand jobs?
All of NIOstreetbetas can line up to get cucked
We will soon be able to use robinhood to buy robinhood

Am I retarded for buying NIO 11/20's ?
why would you short it after one of the biggest sell offs in its history LOL.
THANK U FOR LOOKING OVER ME WHEN I WAS GOING TO BUY NIO CALLS BUT WENT FOR SHARES INSTEAD 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I somehow barely broke even in November
> If it rockets

Low probability

> if it goes way down

Low probability

> if it stays neutral

High probability

> you barely lose anything at all

As I said, make sure you never profit. Congrats, retard.
Lol I called NIO being theta gang delight
PenIsland.gov
yeah that’s what i thought
another one forming...
fuck you CCL! nobody is going to ride your shitty ships anytime soon!
Takeaway: 80s 2.0 is here
Nio is unamerican and you all will be punished in the end.... especially without the Donald backing you up
NIO is such a cock tease
That’s what I thought too but rumour is that it got leaked so idk
maybe i just don’t know enough about business or maybe i’m just retarded but why are the NIO earnings always negative
I honestly don't know but it certainly doesn't sound good to me. Also, the fact that China doesn't have the best reputation on companies reporting their financials properly.
Yaaas queen
HO HO NIO! 

*Yare Yare Daze*
how did you get this post to be an announcment
Mostly especially because most of the folks here use Robinhood
Fuck them all to death
Iron Condoms?
OOF NIO
More than what you came up with
Well tried it your way old man.  
Down 25% on oil, up 300% on Nio.
eventually
Someone should start a NIO earnings thread.
I’ll upvote you in that case
[removed]
Wow what a hot take
come back in a year or two, fear will make you take wiser financial decisions
You’ll be up but not nearly as much.
Thank you
I'm in
theta gang wins again.
How fucking retarded are u guys?? Earnings isn’t even out yet “iTs GoNnA bE fLaT uR fDs R fUk”

Tbf it dropped $2 in like 10 seconds which was worrying before it started rising again
NIO backwards is OIN. Not a coincidence.
Robinhood screen strobing red/green on NIO
lol those aren't worth 10k
✋

But why?
Pick a direction NIO.
Nio said nope :(
Yeah!
Congrats NIO bulls 🎉
only regret is not selling closer to the money... fuck hahah

You think this is fun, just wait until they announce another offering tonight
Green dildo is shrinking NIO
Anybody holding NIO options that expire in 2020 is gonna learn a hard lesson on what IV crush is at 9:30 AM sharp tmw morning
PLTR to 20 EOW apparently
Y’all know the stock might not have tanked but it didn’t moon either. YALL NIOTARDS GONNA GET IV CRUSHED TOMORROW
After hours fuckery. JPow had to go shit and the gay bears pounced.
Theta gang wins again imagine my shock
Says the guy that uses RichMan_24 for their username
I’d say profit taking, and people selling calls before close today. The un-retarded people in investing and theta gangs usually hide from earnings but still like to play I guess.
March DOW: Worst month since 80s

November DOW: Best month since 80s

Very nice
Lol everyone talking bout NIO and I’m sitting here wit BABA shares like a jackass
Iron Condors is the way
Get the hate out of your heart NIO bears. LOL. You deserve all the bad things your poor life decisions get you
NIO has the biggest red dildo big spooning the biggest green dildo I've ever seen in my life
so? how many fucking times have you morons seen this exact scenario play out? jesus titty slapping christ, you have the memory of a goldfish with  alzheimer's
Feelin good about these NIO 11/20 60c

if we pool all our money together and call it, Tendies Hedge fund. we can all in on TSLA calls and win Bigly.
NIO I don’t care what you do just choose a fucking direction.
CC at 7, gg

watch nio stay flat and IV crush everyone
Nah I sold mine at 50 sir just watching the fun now.
So can we call this a bullish ER move by NiO
“Tanking” by like $2. Snore.
NIO option sellers swimming in money both ways. Congrats
Someone link the call!
I thought the earnings call was at 7 pm eastern. Did it start already or is someone shit posting fake news?
[removed]
Tesla gonna be red tmmrw
Lol
I think I may have called it and hedged accordingly. I think NIO is going to go sideways-ish, perhaps trying to push to 50 by Friday. This was a solid earnings, but not a big surprise. I guess you might call it priced in. We'll see if I'm wrong tomorrow. Maybe it dumps or pumps during hours.
someone’s mad they didn’t hop on
Could be EOD today, however likely tomorrow, as reported by Reuters.
UPDATE: NIO at $62.71 tomorrow
Nahhh
May you have better luck than me
(Bloomberg) -- Soros Fund Management, which revealed that it owned 18.46 million shares of Palantir Technologies Inc., said it made the investment in the data-mining company in 2012 and wouldn’t do the same again today.

“SFM made this investment at a time when the negative social consequences of big data were less understood,” the firm said in a statement Tuesday. “SFM would not make an investment in Palantir today.”

George Soros’s investment firm disclosed the holding in its latest 13F regulatory filing late Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The position was worth $175 million at the end of the quarter.

Soros explained in a note posted on the Open Society Foundations website that the money manager who originally made the investment is no longer employed with the investment firm. The position in Palantir was converted into publicly traded shares when Palantir, co-founded by Peter Thiel, became listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September.

Soros has sold all the shares it’s permitted to sell at this time and will keep selling, according to the statement. “SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices,” the firm said.

Soros, 90, has used his vast wealth to become one of the world’s largest funders of groups promoting justice, democracy, human rights and progressive politics through his Open Society Foundations. He’s poured billions into his philanthropic efforts, and most of his firm’s assets now belong to the foundations rather than to the Soros family.

In recent years he’s taken a more aggressive stance on tech companies and artificial intelligence. He has slammed Facebook Inc. and Google, comparing the social-media giants to gambling companies that foster addiction among users and saying they exploit the data they control. In 2019, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Soros warned of the “mortal danger” of China’s use of AI to repress its citizens under the leadership of Xi Jinping.

Over the years the financier’s investments have conflicted with this philanthropic philosophy. His funds have at various times owned stakes in gun manufacturers and coal companies.

Palantir relies on contracts from government entities, including the U.S. Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence Agency, for much of its revenue. The company has drawn criticism from human rights activists for selling software that facilitates the deportation of immigrants and aggressive policing. Its data-scraping has also raised concerns among privacy advocates.
Stocks go up or down
Theta gang must be frothing at the mouth right now
undertakeralive.gif
pltr to the fuckin moon
Alright I’ve moved 50% of my purchasing power to the sidelines.

Sleepy Joe is going to stagnate this market for the next 4 years; finding an exit point with Amazon through the holiday season and getting out of dodge
Forming the classic Tesla "T" logo.. NIO 2 the moon!
Yeah lol
Those margins on NIO are actually very good given the fact that they dont build their own cars.
What about ITM Calls/Puts?

Say NIO opens at $50 tomorrow, and someone is holding $40c?
This will not age well.
And Google will auto correct that cursh to crush for you
Have to wait for the call, too early to tell what NIO does, I expect 60 later today/tomorrow
THEY CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!
Bye bye
Wouldn’t be surprised to see it below 16.5 again and hopeful for sub 16. But you never really know in this clown market. 

It dropped $2 last week after the vaccine pump wore off so I’m hoping for that same move. Granted we’re starting at a higher high.
NIO with the RIP
My guess is that people first heard nio missed eps. So price went south. And then they announced that they beat revenue with more cars sold. So it went north
aapl always recovers overnight
[deleted]
It's also utterly wrong.

Veracity should count for something when deciding what to use as your source of information and understanding, right?
Has theta gang ever lost?
what the fuck is this bullshit just give positions
somehow the bears won 5 games this year
Nobody fuckin knows. You can look up history and last two earning they had a dip day after then a small steady climb up the following couple days.
I’m dying, NIO just acting like it always does 9-10am. CC going to pump us to heaven
Is this why they say straddles are risky ? NIO 1x 35p. 1x 65c 11/20
Wall Street knows just as little as you contrarily to popular belief
Honestly you miss understand how index work... 

I’m real curious to see how they include it but they have to sell others to include it... fact Tesla value is so huge they might have to split in different class share! 

They just don’t add tesla value to it all just like that
Business Outlook

For the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company expects:

Deliveries of the vehicles to be between 16,500 and 17,000 vehicles, representing an increase of approximately 100.6% to 106.7% from the same quarter of 2019, and an increase of approximately 35.2% to 39.3% from the third quarter of 2020.

Total revenues to be between RMB6,258.7 million (US$921.8 million) and RMB6,435.8 million (US$947.9 million), representing an increase of approximately 119.7% to 126.0% from the same quarter of 2019, and an increase of approximately 38.3% to 42.2% from the third quarter of 2020.
This business outlook reflects the Company’s current and preliminary view on the business situation and market condition, which is subject to change.
Depends if she’s a goodun or a baddun sir
NIO option holders in shambles, NIO shareholders in sandals
Congrats retard, fuck you <3
What are you gonna do? Pass me the tissues?
Lick your wounds and buy BABA so we can finally recover ffs
It actually translates to “holy shit.”
No kidding
Need big dick energy everyone huddle up and present
Pretty great ER tbh
We don't discuss IV here at WSB thank you
Back down
Best DD ever
NIO revenue and EPS beat— not by a lot, but beat. We need good guidance from CC to make a moonshot
Most elastic dead cat? This your first ER?
weak 🤲
I don't know whether to short it or go long.  Damn thing moves SO SLOW.
CHINA will never let their EV companies report bad earnings even if it means making up numbers and bribing every accountant signing off on their statements.

Dunno how it’s formatted, i just sorted by all similar to how robin hood formats your “All” performance.
Built up some puts yesterday. Assuming that most airlines forecasted to run a recovering holiday season and won't; who buys a ticket knowing how long quarantines got extended last time. It's gunna hit their rasm and casm is already higher from reduced schedules. 

11 AAL p
36 UAL p
No matter if you're bull or bear, everyone will lose money in NIO regardless
NIO is going to be like TSLA. Future growth is gonna already be priced in and its gonna become a great swing trading stock.
NIO bears and bulls both trying to cope right now and talk shit towards the other is so funny. 90% of y’all are gonna wake up to -97% positions. Just accept the fact post some loss porn and have some fun about it
Lmao
It looks like you signed your name as the loser 👍
Is it supposed to be out by the end of the day today?
Gonna be a double V lol
Lol all nio holders getting fucked
nio worst case scenario where everyone gets fucked lmao
Isn’t the earnings call at 7pm eastern? Hasn’t happened yet.
What is entry cost? For 50c 12/28?
Yes per option but If I can buy 3 OTM options for the price of one ITM options Ill make more overall if the price goes in my favor.
IV crush in full effect tomorrow. Puts and Calls are toasted
not all of them are flat.  some have 2 round balls.
NIO EARNINGS

Was bullish for the last two weeks.  Now im all in SPY 358 puts for 11/27.  I dont see this shit continuing.
Tulips! Get your tulips here! $44-$48 dollars a share...I mean bulb
Hey pack it up everybody, he said it has to be up 3-4%.
But like no event or news or anything?
I was legit just about to sell all my NIO at 42 and then I waited 0.0028365383 seconds and it’s back up to 46+.....NIO, you something else, man
Is that a normal thing? I’ve never heard of a company posting unaudited results as their earnings report numbers.
NIO is the most volatile piece of shit ive ever seen.  you're all retarded.  and no i dont have puts
MMs and theta gang sucking each other off on NIO
nobody will really know until open tmr.
Yuh
U saved yourself some money!
Flat is a loss for both bulls and bears you retards
Not like this... not like this...
He's right y'know
Atlanta Bears
how did it go down then up i thought stonks only go up?
I consulted my Palantir and the red eye spoke to me:

NIO opens flat tomorrow and everyone loses
it has to go up 20% otherwise iv crush my bro.
Sorry guys I bought NIO calls and puts we staying flat
add some IV to the mix and you're double fucked
gotta do both... put 10%-20% of portfolio in options. most should 4 months or leaps, and some nice risky plays
[deleted]
Flat for NIO, not bad. But Shitty for people who held FDs calls/puts
Any nio put holders put in a lambo order a few minutes agoand now canceling it?💀
Sry that was me I just baught it and it dipped per usual when I buy. Strange that it actually came back up...
Nios death was greatly exaggerated
If you homies aren't in on DRIV yet get in now
 A Jewel reference in my WSB. I approve.
Oh get the FO from here geez
$475
Imagine being in something that can't break 86 resistance for months
Well done.... mine was under 2.00....  sitting on 100 shares.  sold half when it hit double digits... oh well, missed out on bigly gains, but i covered my cost so let it go to 0.00...  my balls are too small to have played the options on this one...
See you back in a few months with a -98k margin account
bet you feel stupid
[deleted]
For earnings absolutely
Agree
🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Your brain saved u $
This shit (CNK) rise to 15.6$ Monday premarket on vaccine news so people are willing to pay a lot more its just a matter of time before MM let the price move up
I’m gonna need Elon to start manipulating the price on Twitter again
lol
Alota people are going to be posting "what is IV crush" tomorrow and "what is theta"
Iv crush gonna be rad tmrw
lol, sold a few 49/50 CCS for a small gain, wish I would have sold puts though. Better than losing my money on IV crush though, retards
Oh shit it’s going back down lol
Bought in at 28. 

I win

How I imagine broke WSBers to look like.
How many are going to get their IV crush cherries popped tomorrow?

The first time hurts but it makes you stronger.
chinese government is trying their darndest to keep NIO up
Me thinking I should sell my calls then remember I got autist hands and cant fold
and a bull trap after that?
I have NIO shares is the earning report good for me? I can’t tell what’s going on and i’m new at this stuff
dont be a bish get in PLTR
50B meme right there
Fuck Dewine and these one dimensional health bureaucrats
He lost
The nio trend ah is starting to become clear
I don't feel so good Mr stark...
 Lmaooo
NIO gonna stay flat just to iv fuck everyone
[removed]
So when is an analyst gonna have the balls to chime in on ZM after it dropped $200

After they load their position?
The fucking balls that would take
If NIO goes red again, I'd laugh
Whats the volume on NIO gonna be by EOD? 400k?
New victims every day.

We will never forget you.
In september I got laid off & was super depressed couldn't even look at my portfolio much but had a little spare change just under $9 in a rollover retirement account. Put in an order for 1 PLTR share if it fell that low. Order filled near bottom & got a better job this month. Moral of the story is don't give up if you have firm convictions & chaos is a ladder. 

This has been my TED^x WSB talk.
NIO is spazzing the fuck out like Arnold in a line two clear Mars customs...
I shoulda Sold puts before close 😒😒
NIO bulls goin crazy for it being less than close
Half and half. Trying not to blow up another account. 🤣
[deleted]
Long term calls ALL THE WAYYYY
Need more money.
☹️
The one who would bring balance to the matrix
Bull parade also over Theta parade now taking place
Fuck em in the face don’t sell
Held and then sold at the very bottom @42.62
Just have a cash account
Well fuk
bears blew a 4 point lead
[deleted]
TeslaQ crowd be like "S&P500 inclusion is just the latest step in Elon's scheme to defraud investors"
12.9% gross profit, thats probably less than walmart
It’s kinda sad that the NIOphyte bulls don’t realize how fucked they are. Sub $40 by the opening bell.
My programming skills are quite rudimentary, like, I learned C# for this specific reason in around 2 weeks. However I was able to code this relatively easily. 

Honestly it’s all in finding an edge though, programming it is the easy part.
These AH algos on NIO mean my INTC calls I bought EOD will print tomorrow right?!
jfc I hate this sub lmao
If it stays level here you guys should be okay.
sell before earnings dingus
NIO bulls gain $20 and lose 3 years of life from the stress
This is one of the craziest ER's I've watched in real time.
Yep beat on all except for eps

The key is expectations and guidance
18 mins in and people already deciding whats next month gonna look like 😂
Perma anything people are a "bundle of sticks"
Lol alota people are about yo learn what IV crush is. And what happens when you IV crush and open flat.
Back to red bb
PRPL up 266% on the year. I’ll take that for PLTR
That's some 500 IQ play. Dump NIO and shake out the paper hands, and buy the bottom.
hahaha
NIO bears 🌈🤡
First one's free
NIO "I just had deja vu"

Trinity: "What did you see?"

NIO "A black cat. It walked by twice"

⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️46, 45, 42
⏫⏫⏫⏫42, 45, 46
NO ONE LEAVE NO ONE FUCK EM ALL
Because they're not out yet, you retard.
Theta gang is up massively right now if we open here.
Even if it plummeted rn why in the hell would you sell that many when it’s still projected to hit 100 in the future
velour hands
Yeah got calls
Let's talk baba guys. Why is it mad bro?
FACTS been feeling really bougie lately thanks to the NIO tendies
Nio v-shapes are unbroken chopsticks
You tomorrow in cash gang instead of buying calls: 😭
Holy fuck it dumpstered to 42 and I came a little. 

Then it immediately went back up to 46 and I pooped a lot more.
Honestly that’s a great entry point
Can I come?
WERE BREAKING EVEN
Spy and in 32 years that will be 25
I SOLD PUTS TO 🌈🐻

GG LMFAOOOOOOO
Fuck, what have you created..
most of you option holders arent
No up or down is all that matters
My only regret with FCEL is not buying more.
If you had no skin in the NIO game, this was the funnest AH ER to see. So much butthurt both ways.
This shit looks like its going to fuck both call and put holders LMAO
Mimosas pair well with cocaine
[removed]
Lmfaooo
Just like the PRPL gang lol. Bought FDs on a stock that rose a bit amount and were surprised it didn’t explode.
Nio is the new Chyna virus
IV: 250% +

NIO: I guess I'm just gonna stay flat.
Lots of dirty underwear in this sub right about now.
Need to learn how to trade options. Fcuk
NIO bear party went on for a total of 1.3 mintutes
Putting all your calls on nio feels like an abusive relationship
This place can turn 2.5k to 0 really fast. Your best bet is put that shit in the bank, and go find yourself a job.
NIO gonna be flat as a Thai hooker and absolutely destroy all option holders
Can't wait for all the posts tomorrow: "NIO green but my calls are red WTF?"
After a massive sell off? I think thats pretty good
LOUDER
The CFDs are proper dodgy, the graphs are shit and it constantly lags during peak hours (monday market open) but I've not been able to find a similar site with commission free equities and I just use an external graph site to buy and sell.
Tesla gang how we feeling?
The volume trading like regular hours on NIO... jebus
NIO, I’m not afraid anymore. WSB told me I would fall in love and that that stonk..the stonk that I loved would be the one.
NIO swings -8% down and back to green is... a sight to behold... honestly it's legendary...
Either i buy a new car or im sellin ass on the street. No Inbetween
CCP GO BRRRR
F
You lost me at “meme stock” and “always”
Forgot about NIO earnings

was thinking about puts
I am honestly am holding shares and selling calls just because the IV is too insane and at any moment the rug can get pulled out against your favor... Long term this is going to be a winner. There will be huge swings and I would rather not try to time them.
I think NIO gang is fucking your mum
She be doing a vocal warmup tho
Not when we on top but yeah did ride part of the rally!

I’m def perma bull on my option plays
Ok how about tell me the scenario where this works out
It was a wild fucking ride though.
[deleted]
yup.
It's the pre/post earnings day dump......even when a stock reported crazy good earnings it always initially tanks after it went half way to the moon.

Lots of people buy in before earnings and literally jump out right after. It's part of the circle of life.
i’m in london so GMT bro
Lol at the NIO put gay bear parade from 10 minutes ago.  Parade’s over bitches.
No fuck u
Lmao all the gay bears are silent now
I'M NOT FUCKING LEAVING!
Me too brother. We gonna eat tomorrow
All my homes love NIO
[deleted]
Nio call holders in shambles 💘
https://twitter.com/nypost/status/1328418812086153217
I don’t know what stripe is or does but tuck it I’m in
Oh here we fucking go NIO to the moon
just whatever you fucking do PLEASE PLEASE dont go back to nio. no matter how good it looks. i lost a ton with nio, gained a ton with PLTR, and then lost it all again with nio. seriously fuck nio
Citron loses yet again
These algos are going to kill us one day
Good lord holding bull positions on NIO is an absolute roller coaster atm
Yeah I was surprised no one else came in and used a lot more colorful language than I might have lol.
blatant manipulation
Biggest IV burn for nio rip all
NIO will never die
Its flat. Your going to get rocked by theta and iv crush
Ok who had the 47 short straddle?
Please tell me what’s going on
[deleted]
Yeah, and you might get hit by an electric vehicle and not post here anymore. We can dream can’t we?
Suck my big bull dick nerds

Have fun with all those puts I sold you 

LE LOSÉR
No it's funny watching the bears get excited and then the bulls and each mocking each other but nothing really changing
Oh my god that top comment lmao
was so tempted to buy that AH sell off... hahah fuuck
Ive never seen a battle so fierce jesus. My ticker bout to break
Nobody tell him
Even as a joke that’s really gross dude
🐻
Palantir is the only reason I'm not crying right now. 
$15.50C 11/20
China just making shit up as usual
call the poor house....but not for me.
WTF? Will you get it back? Keep us posted
ya i realize the fucking money printer was turned on in china
IV cuck gg’s bears & bulls get fucked theta gang takes this W sadly I was hoping to buy the new Xbox after Nio strangle 🤪
The algo CPUs are burning up trying to price NIO
Seriously. Nio the moon god.
how did you know before hand? any tips?
NOPE LMAO
Yeah thats not how it works when you buy way otm calls and puts lol. If it rockets, you win, if it goes way down, you win, if it stays neutral, you barely lose anything at all. Pretty simple really.
A casual 16.7% dip from the day’s high to the AH low? Pfff! Didn’t anyone ever teach you that stonks only go up?
It's a good day to be an option seller\~ 😋
😎😭
I cant take it no more im not built to be fucked this much
Yeah we did
NIO instantly recovered jesus christ. What a god
Why did Nio sell off so much
Yeah so I took some of my Tesla Tendies and went PLTR puts before close. Hoping this pays off at open.
And I'm out of TQQQ this morning...almost got back at the top but it's a mistake I made too many times 🤦🏼‍♂️.

Managing your trade and sticking to your strategy is of more importance than when to enter, trading should be boring, emotions are the killer.
Reliable?  If you Google the Belaaz the first thing that pops up is "this site may be hacked"
LMAO ya by 5 cents
Same me and my 4.3 shares are sweating rn 😅🥵
I think NIO calls are getting fucked too...
Unaudited earnings = fuck you,  we can report whatever we want
Okay, weak ass China EVs .....time to move all the cash to TSLA
Does it matter?
A special shout-out to all the retards that hop in on all the WSB plays. You truly are special. Cheers
It's like lol no jk but for real lol
I am a Nio bull but I’d like to see Bears get fuxked too. Flat Nio. Yeah
Damn what time zone u in
I just sold my 600 shares at  42.62.... fuckkkkkkkkk
praying that NIO tanks the meme stock market so I can get a dip on CRSR and PLTR 🙏
I’m feeling a sophisticated NIO brunch tomorrow with the ladies.
I think that is in reference to 2fa via text. If someone like calls customer support, and that agent neglects to follow procedures, and issue them a sim with your number, they can get the 2fa text.
Aye bruh don’t delete yo comment 🤣🤣
NIO put holders in shambles 🤡
I've got 30 day 160 puts. Planning to sell tomorrow
Prolly twomrow sometime around noon when the tendies are warmest at Wendy's.
stellar insight
Fuck v shaped recovery. Do stop limits get triggered after hours?

Edit: nvm. Googled it. It doesn't.
NIO back from grave. Theta gang once again wins.
I didn’t miss that pump. It was the greatest DD I ever read
IV was 140 area, but OK.
It's coiled and ready to do something. I started buying yesterday
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
I want off this wild ride 🤣
Welcome to the club man, am gonna go jerk off to ease the pressure
Only in 100 share blocks
29% aint shit buddy

70-100%  is the only way for NIO to keep going
I picked up 47c 11/27s.  Break even was 4 points.  Come on NIO how about 10 tmr.
Might need to back away from options. I’d suggest spending a couple summers working, and build a strong safety net. 

Once you’ve done that, go to the nearest casino and put it all on black (don’t fuck with red). Then put your winnings into options
Is there a difference at dis point?
Hahaha yes.  Except for when your strike gets run over and you lose %2,000
NIO will be $50 tomorrow by EOD.
We do, its called theta gang
Can confirm took body blows past two months while I got into 2-3 chip shots.
MMs gonna make some serious dough from selling you NIO bulls & bears ridiculously overpriced options
Depends on your strike
Nio about to trade flat tomorrow and fuck everyone's fds then proceed to sell of for the next month
wait, so I can buy puts on RH's stock from RH??? Fuckit, I'm in!
You have it opposite. You make more money with itm strikes on calls. Bc if it goes up in value the lower strike you have the better profit. You have this backwards Jesus Christ. Please read about options
This is very retarded
PLTR? WSB has been an a streak! we're back to the good old days of MSFT, AMD, etc
tomorrow i’ll either be begging for chump change under a bridge or living in a mansion
NIO bears about to get it.
Congrats NIO bulls. You’re back at 3pm levels lol
nvda
🤡🤡
Almost had another heart attack
320 million volume on NIO. No way that thing is dropping
What’s more predictable a meth addict or NIO?

lol NIO is back up
\*Agent Smith takes his sunglasses off in disbelief\*
MMs never lose
So my shares are good I guess🏋🏻
in this thread are retards who dont understand that shorts are going to short and already creaming their panties by celebrating early
Theta gang ftw
11/20 $50c purchased this morning for $3.20. So I'm guessing I'm totally fucked on holding this NIO call right?
did anyone here actually read NIO earning results?

I dont lmao
I like this even more
Taking the NIO bears outback and putting a bullet in their head
So when will FANG recovers??
🎵 Brrrrr, what happened to that boy. He was buying calls theta gang put a clap into that boy 🎵
annnnd your pooor

LIFT OFF - HOUSTON WE ARE A GO
Algos doing their shit😂
NIO buyers and sellers are in a winner-take-all round rn lol. Whoever out-buys or out-sells the other side wins the tendies tommorow
Lmao this is cray
yah for sure.  If you are one of those "in at $19 / $20" guys, then you've got nothing to worry about.  IMO, the only thing that would make this thing drop and keep it down for longer than a day would be a Stock Offering.  But even then, would probably take a week, 2 tops before it rebounded.
theta always wins in the end. the only way to win is to not play the game at all
both u retards are fucked
NIO's earning is really good if you read it
What are we thinking about Tesla tomorrow
nio 6000 by am
Orange crush is better.
👆🏻 translates to “I’m a NIO exec, positive ER on the way. Buy! Buy! Buy!”
Typical non RH trader
NIO bulls and Bears can both share their loss porn tomorrow cause Theta gang absolutely fucked them.
 Remindme! 4 weeks
Lmao at $47 now

Oh I have Jan $16 calls ready to sell late December, im just memeing
In all seriousness, bears are adorable :)
😂
Anyone know a good personal injury lawyer? Doctor says I have niohypertitis from this FICKING NIO WHIPLASH
NIO options are so fucked tomorrow lmao
ANNNNND WERE BACK
NIO gonna run bigly tomorrow
I legit think the CCP is going to pump the fuck out of this company and lie through their teeth.  Only question is who will be left holding the bag.  It's not gonna be tmr.
Hi Dad about Japanese cars in 1980.
"Back from the dead, assholes!"
NIO will keep jumping around no sense in even looking at after hours trading

Hell yeah 420

Bears need to start being bulls. They got to get tired of bears R fuk eventually. Bulls always have money bears always broke. Just change your ways and make money damn. Pick winners and stick to them
Yeah, gotta make sure you don't make a profit!
NIO to the moon
IM TRAPPED IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION
I have seen EKG machines with less movement than NIO right now.
To the mooooooooooon
Nio!!!
honestly... just watch the Matrix to see what NIO does... look how he fucks up agent smith by tricking him
Time to turn off my RH
listen here sped did u not see how far it dipped into my asshole and then shot up?
The 212 screenie in a world of Robinhood made me unreasonably happy
Selling my car and buying exclusively from NIO, gotta keep the faith alive #BULLGANGRISE
Same boat this shits better than drugs. Enables you to conquer the world, and eviscerate your enemies. Money ladies and gentlemen
Theta gang is raping both sides
Earnings crushes volatility pretty hard bro. IV Crush kills most OTM Calls/Puts
I hope you win this game
Well, someone is not making money 🤣
nio just beat expectations by 29%. shit might legit open above 50 a share and climb to 60-70
Aids came from eating them.

But don't let that crush your fantasies. You do you.
Fuck yeah LZB crushed earnings
11/20 50c purchased this morning for $3.20.... so I'm super fucked right?
[deleted]
NIOphytes don’t know what to think in this bitch.
No movement, taking money from retail both directions as usual. No one wins.
How does it make you feel knowing you missed the LL pump and it's now 5x from beginning year?
Need to turn 2.5k into 25k as quickly and easily as possible
Man NIO is the most awesome meme stock of all time. Which other stock has ever Drilled 10% down and then recovered it within minutes, and is making everyone capitulate like pussies
Well i Say that but i took many losses too lol... You decide when ti take the loss
You should buy a lottery ticket just for fun.
Yup. Only an idiot plays this shit.
More than that bro
NIO bulls celebrating being flat with 230% IV calls lmao. This is gonna end well.
We green lmfao
This is why playing earnings is such a shit show. 

Glad I pulled out of NIO last week and switched to PLTR
The gay bears are silent
Yes
Gotta get them to print more money.  Let’s go MMT
Moooooooooon babayyyyy
Who’s waiting for the $BA announcement?

NIO stop playing with my emotions I can’t work now 😂
NIO FUCK MY WIFE

They had us in the first half I'm not gonna lie.
Someone just bought 2 million worth of BABA at 256.56. What a sucker, am I right?
PFE tryna pump and ZM tryna dump in AH.

Wait responded to wrong comment - 11/20 50c purchased this morning for $3.20.   


Am I completely fucked right now?
[deleted]
LOL here comes NIO for the 10-20% gain rofl
This is the way to play earnings lol they just don’t get it
Fucking NIO
Papa Musk, we are so sorry that we believed in a false prophet (China Elon). please forgive us. bless up.
now I can shove you in there Nerd
Hey look, 47
This didn't age well.
1/3 Stonks, 2/3 cash to trade options
Stonk go up. Stonk go down.
Absolute mad lad

covered?
baba = kaka
i donno.. been so fucking strong, and so much hype, and people think its the fucking future and shit.

Plus intraday was fucking monstres today
Does this mean that we’re all Theta cucked??
Yes but let them have this moment
Revenue $666.6 million mark of the beast
Wym its barely changing u tard
Dont be shy, which one of u bought my 55 calls?
For what?
Both
this is the most elastic dead cat bounce i’ve ever seen, it might just die and bounce to the moon 😂🚀🚀
Not gonna lie, NIO had me in the first half.
thank fucking god I didnt go back into Nio today..
I’m honestly just surprised the market reacts either way to NIOs earnings numbers. Not like they are real
Are you referring to Guileanne Barre Syndrome (havnt checked the spelling) which happens in a few flu vaccines?

Speaking of flu vaccines the current ones dont work very well as the WHO makes a guess 6 months in advance and have only a 30% chance of guessing which is going to be the dominant strain that year. As a result it only works 1 out of 3 times which reduces uptake of flu vaccines (people dont like taking things which only work one out of 3 times). NVAX also has had successfull Phase 3 trials of Nanoflu. Being a Nanoparticle vaccine they can create it in 2 months instead of 6 so the WHO can wait longer and mkae a more accurate guess. This will increase the potency of flu vaccination.

That is another reason why I like the NVAX stock more than the mRNA based companies.

I wont wait for the inactivated vaccine. But I will most probably wait for the NVAX vaccine and not take one of the mRNA vaccines.

As I stated COVID is not really that bad in younger folks so younger folks would be taking vaccines more to protect their elder relatives. In such cases its better to wait for a safer vaccine. High risk groups like nursing homes should go for the mRNA vaccine but they should go with their eyes open.

Also consider if something bad happens with the mRNA vaccines what the negative impact it will have on vaccine uptake for other much more serious diseases.

Definitely children should not be vaccinated till we have at least a year of safety data given that they dont really suffer from Covid.
Looks like  jp morgan,s playing games
I was talking the pump in your graph
Great so i have to panic for another three hours, chris
Not how time zones work dumb dumb
Collectively, Robin hood users have about 3 dollars if you include all the retards with margin calls and negative accounts. So zero power
How come people don’t just sell calls on earnings? Fat IV drop fat profit right?
Literally 15 minutes into AH. I’ll come back later
Comrade Xi isn’t gonna like this one bro.
playing NIO = letting commies fuck w/your money
You’re welcome??
Ehh..... sus
Tesla sympathy off NIO earnings?
46-43-46

Dang, that's my locker combination
Eh depends we won’t know how bad until tommorow
NIO PICK DIRECTION
[deleted]
NIO is our greatest hope for world peace
Correct
Nah they have it "priced" much lower. They just wanted to collect more money by selling options.
hello my goodman! did trading 212 give it away😔
BEARS CANT BELIEVE IT. V SHAPED RECOVERY AFTER HOURS. YOU CANT KILL NIO
That’s why I told everyone to sell calls lol
nice.
Bigger than what people think
Real quick has anybody ever even seen a chinese car? In their lives? China has been making cars for like 100 years now... Youve never seen one?
Depends, bad if u buy, good if u sold
after looking at the color and shape of excrement, and spilling the guts of a freshly killed rabbit, I will go YOLO on anything green.
If u aint holding nio puts, u aint black
You study programming? Bc my programming skills are quite basic so I guess to implement the right strategy you'd have a code of 100 or more lines?
**NIO gives guidance for Q4.  New Electric Clown Cars hitting soon**
This shit is better than any movie. 

I FUCKING LOVE IT!!!!!

🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕
Why it’s up back ?
Wow. If NIO open flat at least Ill not be completely poor
Just do hard drugs.
ye.
DUMP IT! pump it! DUMP it!
Pretty sure both sides lose wit iv crush.  Theta wins again.
bruh go easy on me zaddy
as if i dont waste enough of my dad im stuck watching AH movement too...
WTF NIO. lol
[removed]
I regret getting into BABA tbh. But since I'm already in diamond hands have been activated.  Mama didn't raise no bitch
Gold and silver been very sleepy lately.....
Hope you gay boys sold at the dippity doo
Did you see that happened in the news recently?
Puts on my heart watching NIO
Ur new here
I heard 50 cent is back buying VIX calls
r/unpopularopinion... you can buy or short shares to hedge your position even after hours
Watching NIO AH right now is like the scene from The Matrix when Smith fills his chest full of lead and he gets back up.  Pretty soon, NIO gonna be stopping bullets, flying, and doing all kinds of Space Karate.
A lot
this is why you hold shares lmaooo
Tell me more
Theres WAY too much money on both sides of PEEOH to let a average ER fuck one side or the other.
anybody that held NIO calls is going to need it to be up at least 3-4% in order to not get IV crushed
IV crushed :(
Ok Nio fans lets talk about prudence.  Stop buying car companies that make no cars and start investing like your parents.  Yolo into oil stocks.  They actually make money.  Oxy up 50% in the last 2 weeks
Pltr 20 eow
They're out.
When there's a big dump before earnings, insiders know it wasn't going to be good.

Follow the money
Rip puts and calls wow. So much for that.
So is HD gonna stay flat even AH after beating earnings?
Sold a 35/45p - 45/55c iron condor mid-afternoon, I hope that shit opens up smack at $45 tomorrow
That sounds contrary to logic, but I believe you given what I'm looking at right now. 

My time being a retard with NIO has been a real rollercoaster...
Nio Q3 20 Earnings: 

- Revenue: CNY4.53B (exp CNY4.38B) 

- Sees Q4 Revenue CNY6.26B To CNY 6.44B (exp CNY5.42B) 

- Sees Q4 Deliveries 16,500 To 17,000
Whats it dropping to u think?
Well Nio bears can suck a big fat cock
Dirty theta rats
Does anyone actually buy shares like me or does  everyone trade options?
"BUT I'M NOT DONE YET."

nio
This bodes well for me as a put seller.
Arent nio call holders fucked anyway ,even with good earnings? IV crush from 250% is gonna destroy them no matter what,no?
Its literally going sideways lmao. All the NIO option traders are really about to get what they had coming.
Where are all the excited 🐻 of NIO
Very
Hoping for a dip on this stock doesn't seem wise but I'm a retarded.
I literally own zero options and just 46 shares of Nio you half baked potato. Not everyone is fucking balls deep in Nio rn
Yes and change you mind within 3 minutes if possible
[deleted]
Lmaooo they went silent reallll quick huh
[deleted]
SELLS CALLS LIKE A BOSS 😎
Bruh who knows anymore
The fat lady hasn’t sung yet
They are negative on earnings but they beat what they were estimated (which was also negative) so literally nothing has changed.
Lmao me? 🤡
I've been holding AAL puts since 94
Man I feel like this last 2 months just murdered a bunch of people's accounts. Mine included
See you behind the dumpster
Not me after sold calls😂😂
Telsas short interest is under 5% now. Shorts are dead
[deleted]
I kept telling myself after the Singles Day BABA dog turd and ANT ipo fiasco that I won't play Chinese stocks anymore... I won't play Chinese stocks anymore...I won't play Chinese stocks anymore... I won't play Chinese stocks anymore...I won't play Chinese stocks anymore... I won't play Chinese stocks anymore....I won't play Chinese stocks anymore... I won't play Chinese stocks anymore

NIO 40p 11/20
yeah man it’s open for another 3hrs 45 mins
NIO gonna lose the fight.
I made $60 today and got out right at the start of that big power hour dip on it so I feel like a winner right now
Nobody gonna win except the share holders selling calls and puts lmao
Greetings fellow Europoorean!
Dr bitch boy I’ve been here longer than your knuckle dragging self, get you some flair before we talk got my old account nuked from a “f@ggot” by Reddit might be worth another account ban here.
Same, sold 10 of the 70c the other day when it was up to $2.10
How many NIO shares do you have to sell to drop the share price by $4?!
Dead cat bounce
NIO OPENING AT 60
TO THE FUCKING MOON LETS GOOO
Lots of salty downvoters here right now
圣屎
Nio Paper hands are hopping back in tomorrow 


Up 100% tomorrow
Paper hands even in AH
is IV crush bad?
theta won lol needed 20% move to even make the IV worth it either direction
If you are long options on NIO you are fucked right now.
scarra
Yeah at least it means they are on a good path and is Bullish long term. It is clearly over valued atm but it clearly has a path to huge $$$ so I dont care about value
Even better for the theta gang :)
NAh sold PLTR shares at 17.80 just got 1x 35p weekly
MMs have priced in a +-$9 move by EOD Friday. This is from today’s $46.59 market close.
But can options set you up for a career as a porno cameraman?
nice.
TSLA market cap is 418.60B.  420.69B tomorrow?
Thought about selling the 369/370’s for 8% but didn’t, congrats on the $450 🍻
IV crush will still wipe you out if price doesn't move from when you got the option
Lol you can always tell people are salty as shit when the downvotes hit.
BABA is fucking dying, will someone please render aid ⛑
Fuck you gay bears lmao
This is hilarious
Stay humble
Good luck to the retards holding on to NIO thru earnings
EAT A FAT COCK NIO BEARS 🤣💦 In your face
Y’all think Tesla gonna go back after?
NIO ER

YEP!  I’m not sure what the fuck happened at first but it’s making it’s come back! :-)
Alright so hear me out. PLTR puts for this week.
All in less than a minute.
You can’t die NIO, you can’t because..I love you.
2020
[deleted]
Lol I’m sitting here with 600 shares and I’m completely ok knowing it’s gonna moon either tomorrow or next year, either way our money is safe.
lmao itm debit spreads still looking good
Moves for tomorrow: Watching PLTR go up after I sold it at open today. Deleting my account in shame if NIO moons.
Oh I know, been burned many times.  Although I guess it depends what price you got in at and expiration
Small hands small balls small penis nio to the moooooo
Why do people use robinhood???
If you long on Nio and holding shares then shut the fuck up. It’s not a big deal
Markets closed for me, y’all can still buy?
[deleted]
Selling half of my nio puts for 500$ profit before earnings was definitely the move let's see how the other half play out
[deleted]
I THOUGHT I LOST MY LIFFE SAVINGS WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS
FCEL have meme potential? 🤔
29% above projections is good for shareholders, right? I’m new to this and have a little chunk in NIO. Unsure of what to expect this will do tomorrow.
What then? Someone buys them retard
Running out of ‘oofs’ here Nio
Got a call from bear inc. 

CEO submits to the will of us bulls, told him to buy some spy 370 weeklies tm
**DIE NIO. DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE CCP NIO**
by increasing volatility?
I would think so. I feel like this is a repeat of last week. And that would say yes they’ll print by Thursday.
Love it! I have been on the Jan 2022 60c! Not worried one bit! Up 10% right now because I bought 2 months ago... Was down 30% at some point but diamond handed em
[deleted]
NIO AINT DEAD YET, ITS BACK UP
What a roller coaster...
all my nibbas bosses
NIO IS SENTIENT
Damn addiction I’m back in
Thank you, very much. That’s exactly what I needed to hear. Yes I am, and I just got in this year. I am up 31%. 

I have no friends in the stock market and thought I’d ask a single fucking question online but I get shamed out of the group. Besides you and anyone with an actual answer, please go kill yourself. Your the most toxic group online I’ve ever fucking seen. What a nice community! All I needed was five minutes
Crazy, it was a setup for the shorts to get back in
[deleted]
Never short a meme, first rule of WSB.
This is proof Wall Street hears earnings and just instantly sells without looking at them. This shit is fucking comedy. Godspeed you autist call holders.
I think you are the retard
Who needs reality shows when there is WSB. Always an interesting day, never boring
if nio doesnt move  20% both bulls and bears are fked... implied move was 22%
Correct sir
NIO AH is the tightest V ive seen since your baby sister
[deleted]
Upvote if you held those nio calls cause we are the elite degenerates
theta gang wins yet again !
Dead cat bounce lmao
THETA GANG WINS AGAIN FUCK MAMMALS

I wonder who was responsible for that fucking trolling on NIO. Definitely trying to scare some money away to buy back in.
NIO hurt itself in confusion.
Hahaha NIO is straight wildin. Getting my popcorn ready!!! 🍿🍿🍿

[deleted]
NIO reports were good, why did the stock drop?
THEY'RE GONNA PIN THIS FLAT ON A 200%+ IV LMAOOOOO
When will you learn that NIO doesn’t die, it only grows stronger each time it’s struck down

Looks like algos initially read the earnings as Bearish but when actual human investors got the time to finish analyzing, the earnings are actually bullish 🤔
NIO trying to write Big Daddy symbol(T) on the graph.

If I didn't pull out of NIO this stress would give me a heart attack
"Drop them drawers" -Nio 2020

Would give an award to this guy.

To whoever of you who sold me these cheap ass nio stocks: thanks weak hand!
NIO playing with ppls emotions.  it's gonna end up flat to fuck both calls and puts x IV crush
NIO leaps are the best thing ever... and short term JMIA calls are good too

Looking good so far. Early drop already gone.

Sooooo... do the opposite of anything said for NIO.
I think you can't laugh at anyone who is betting on or against Nio. It's trying to please bulls and bears. Shits so volatile both bulls and bears are right every hour somehow
Wait if they beat their expected isnt that good?
It’s gonna fuck over call/put holders.
back to the gay bear dens haha
Theta gang wins again dam, should of known the house always win

Bears never doubt me the fuck again. I’m right again like every time. I’ll call in your favor when a drop is coming but when I say somethings a winner I’m not talking out my ass. NIO bulls and diamond hands congratulations
This is the most excited I’ve been about a stock and I’m not even playing! Lol

Did wally say the n word?
I didn’t have any liquid money so didn’t buy the dip. Could have made $4 per share in 5 minutes wtfffff
Get in before it reaches 50
RIP your anus if you played earnings w/ options on NIO. Your shitty puts and calls are worth nothing when IV drops from 300%
So BABA went down so people could FOMO NIO????

[deleted]
that pump tho
[deleted]
NIO STOP THIS IS TOO MUCH PLEASE !!!
Unless you're holding shares that temper tantrum just wrecked any near dated options
I sold my puts before close on that drop
Not a fuckin chance
Earnings per second has increased.
NIO flat through the week. Option buyers r fuk
If you actually think NIO is staying down you are sorely mistaken
If there are any bears left in here just waive the 🏳 

It’s over.
Sorry fren
What goes up...
 LOOK AGAIN ASSHOLE
Millions of NIO call holders suddenly cried out in terror  and were suddenly silenced
IV crush...
LMAO
Look at that rock on her hand. She clearly knows how to spend all the money and therefore would be great and very motivated at printing money.
Zero chance NIO dumps below 38, somewhat of a chance it moons. 

It either moons or everyone gets IV crushed.
Wth

NIO beat earnings?
It’s going to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀

Yeah it’s at 7
Wtf I thought I could snag them at $42 😭
bears r so fuk idek
HAHHAHAA AT THE BEARS OF NIO THAT GOT EXCITED TOO QUICK
Wew lads
Awkward not even 2 mins later
LMAO bears have a good 30s celebrating HAHAHAHA
Look at the volume AHs
Flat about to screw over bulls and bears
Somehow Im glad I didnt play Nio
Lmao that was a fucking fast recovery hahahah

Guess +/-5% for NIO really is just noise at this point.
Take one more from me
EV bears laughing for 2 mins before looking up rope prices on Alibaba.com
and just like that nio taketh and giveth right back
.5%, green mode locked... target acquired
EVERYBODY HAS A HEADACHE
Also their number of vehicles delivered is awesome. Even if they don't pop 20%, I expect a slight bump up and a fight for 50.

Which is exactly what I am hoping for, since I wrote several 50c and 55c and I'm holding long 50c. I want those 11/20s to expire worthless.

NIO please fucking keep going up. my 65c 11/20 is not looking good
r/babystreetbets
*takes off agent smith glasses👓 *

NOOOOOOOOOO
Lol
Im honestly surprised. It really hasn't moved.
Remindme! 3  weeks
look again
Results are almost always released immediately after market close but the actual call is a bit later
Agreed
Imagine trying to swim your way up a waterfall like a fucking salmon. That is what it is like to be a TSLA bear over the next couple weeks.
LOL earnings going well 🤡🤡🤡
UP +8% in 2 min
‘Twas a trap you fools. 🇨🇳 #1
😂😂😂😂

I love this market. Eat shit bears.
I sold my house and put it on Nio now I’m homeless
HOLY FUCK and we are back... NIO!!!
Great time to open up some bullish spreads opened up some credit spreads on HD that I’ll hopefully close for a 50% profit. That is unless it takes another 3% shit and stays below 260 by DEC.
Perfect
Fuck yes. That’s good for the puts I wrote.
It’s been 10 minutes and your post has already aged like milk
That happens when you’re in a growing phase...
NIO DONT U FUCKING GO GREEN
Shoutout to the guy who made fun of Solo and said to buy puts
Pretty reliable source here: [https://twitter.com/TheBelaaz/status/1328793135644872704](https://twitter.com/TheBelaaz/status/1328793135644872704)

If it turns out to be Iranian-backed weapons systems... all bets are off the table
YES YES TO THE MOON
holding PLTR, GM, and PLUG calls. Almost bought NIO calls at the dip and very happy I didn’t!
HAHAHAHHA GET REJT NIO 🐻
How?
Coming up
Are you sure about that?
BABA genuinely might not go up anymore
We ruined nio.  It's confused
[deleted]
NIO BITCHES IT WILL NEVER DIE
Oopsies... spoke a little too soon? 🤭🐂
Credit default swaps
Let's get that NIO guidance and wait for S&P inclusion rumors
Holy shit this a wild ride!!!
LETS GOOO
NIO 🚀🚀
were looking great.. nio back up
Back in the green bitch, fuck yes
WTF is this stock lmao, in the earnings call lets go boys hahahahaha
-12 down votes. That's my personal best. Thanks
but i did too it's ok
[deleted]
Lol no one here has any idea what they’re talking about
Everyone holding NIO options is going to get theta banged
Retards UNITE!
and back into NIO  XD
Lmao bears are given 2 minutes of hope before being reminded why they’re gay 😂
They’re just fucking with everyone know
Same could be said for XPENG and they mooned 30% after a similar ER. Roast me tomorrow if you want m8 but this is a 20% improvement from the last quarter in delivered vehicles
Wsb did it again, pumping and dumping
May wanna check again
long term if you want to get in now. Short term when it rallies. BABA usually gets pumped fairly fast during uptreads.
NIO just blue balled bears so hard
So fucking funny
buying TSLA tomorrow if it stays below 445. it was long overdue
Wait for cruise ships to sink - but instead watch them continue to rise on “vaccine optimism”.
Theta gang is about selling options to the absolute fucking retards of this sub. You can do VERY well. However, to me, this is a casino, so all I play are FD’s on meme stocks.
FISKER IS FISTING ME RN
its backkkk mfker
NIO had good numbers tbh. Expectations were sky high tho🤷‍♂️
omg nio
Sold a Nov 20 35P. So. Aight.
I'm trying to figure that out too
Can't wait to buy NIO calls at a reasonable IV tomorrow
LMFAO SUCK IT GAY BEARS
gold
[deleted]
Tsla up tmr !! 🤣🤣🤣
[deleted]
Damn NIO bears went from masturbating at lambo pics to buying rope at dollar tree
Lmfao
NIO I fucking love you 😆
ON THE 3RD PUMP NIO ROSE AGAIN.
Lol!
Fuck you NIO Nazis
To all those who panic sold: o7

NIO bears in shambles
Nio bears r dead
NIO AH action most action all day tbh
V shape recovery
Not bullish enough to avoid IV crush
Yup spoke too soon
Strong recovery in NIO, bears are getting lead into a dark room!
“But NIO beat earnings why is it tanking!!!1!!1!”
That NIO Q4 guidance on revenue and vehicle delivery is huge
Like rodman
You’re gonna have to explain with pretty pictures, please.
holy fuck
so you thought
NIO with a comeback for the ages!?!
aren't earnings not even out  yet for NIO wtf
Except they were out when I posted this...

Edit: beat by 29%
I have a 47c and 43p strangle on NIO right now, looks like we ain't paying credit card bills this month cuz this shit will be flat tomorrow
BEARS had about a 5 min party 

Now back to yo broke ass cave
# THERE WAS A FIREFIIIIIIGHT!!
Lmao 🤣 who woulda bought NIO after the insane run up.
Now that’s some fucking movement.
They're actually going to cuck us all with the flat NIO.
This is just what nio does. The panic was fun to see tho.
...did the enormous IV today not clue you in on this? Lol
Sorry guys, I'm a failure retarded paper handed piece of shit pussy that deserve to regret for life and die a miserable death... 

My final advice to yall, if yall get shares, I'm begging yall, please hold. Do not over pathetic small gains lose out on your future vision...
NIOtards are gonna be googling "what is 4 crush" after reading these comments about IV crush lmao. Calls on GOOG
THETA won NIO :O
this is better than tv
Those are 2 outrageous candles
Starting to reverse 📈
[deleted]
MMs gonna pin nio to 45 to fuck all options
NIO is up over 200% in 3 months and the still didn’t make money this quarter.
> I broke even today. 

Whole helluva lot better than being down 19k
Fuck I just sold so much NIO at $44
NIO usually fall after earnings for some reason. It should pick up tomorrow.
Wait a minute is back to green AH...wtf is happening.
Lol wat
Softbank come back BB
It’s coming it’s coming
BACK FROM THE GRAVE
I feel like Trinity when the heart beat monitor comes back on. N..N.. NIO? COME BACK!
[deleted]
Wow. It’s actually recovering
If NIO trades within +-5% your weeklies will literally lose 70% of their values tomorrow morning.
Wait, you guys thought it was over?
i like how no one posted shit for NIO but there's just non stop screeching. not that the #s matter i guess for WSB degens

anyways Q3 14c EPS (adj 12c?), consensus on adj was 17c

rev 666.6m (not shitting you)

sees Q4 920 to 947m, consensus $800m (thats probably helping things a bit)

implied move is 25% (lol) and IV was off the tits. good luck to ppl with weeklies.
[deleted]
this is going to be a wild ride!
[deleted]
YOOOOO V SHAPED RECOVERY NIO
V
That deliveries number saved them
FUCK MY WIFES VISA MONEY WAS IN NIO MY SON AND DAUGHTER ARE GONNA BE TRAPPED IN ECUADOR!!!
So should i hold 5/2020 calls or sell soon and re-buy the dip? 

This article doesn't seem retarded and I can't comprehend
Guys everyone knows after hours trading is wild. Relax we will see what happens tomorrow
watch NIO open flat and just skullfuck everyone
THIS IS THETA GANG! OPEN UP!
Weird fucking day
Thanks man.  I appreciate it.  Everyone was telling them to get out but noooooo
Same didn't lose as much though
[removed]
I hope so.. I have 9 11/18 $365c that I need to print!
NIO ER isnt for another 3 hours
THE COMEBACK.This is so good and it’s only 4.10p. I can’t do two hours of this. I need a drink.
stock goes up 50% in one day... 
WSB says time to buy!
Remindme! 4 weeks
THE RECOVERY
LFGGGGG
NIO! is the One... honestly if you had shares you're fine
NIO N shaped recovery
Hahaaahahahaaaaaahaaaa
#BEAT
It's the SUPER V
LMAO
Tbh I think you got IV crushed
I can start a company to lose money for a quick valuation of. 50 Bol too
You can’t pay for entertainment this good
It’s fine, direct deposit paycheck on Friday just cleared.
Hahahahahahahahaha
Its a volatile growth stock 🤷🏽‍♂️. Last week it went from $54 to $44 over night.
Mr. Retard they report in 3 hours
gross margin 12.9%? my dealer makes more
holy shit NIO roller coaster
legendary
Crazy fucks will buy any dip.

But in the end, theta gang wins again.
The stock market is crazy.
My short strangle printing massively on NIO. No ROPE today.
Zoom was wild. Definitely the exception.
STOP THE COUNT
What the fuck is going on
Hahah madness
NIO can’t make up its mind
jesus christ what is wrong with this stock lmfao
Back green again b*itch
F
Oh u think nio is done? we open 50+ tmr morning
yes
So funny to see all the NIO bears on here right now😂🤣😂 that said “told you!”
OH LMAO
Just saw NIO trending with a drop on ER announcement. Made some popcorn and loaded up the daily thread.
It ain't dead yet!
This is more entertainment than watching a Tarantino movie.
HOLY FUCK NIO
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Laughing so fucking hard
wait a sec...wait
Y'all thought I was dead!!!!!
Wait did the earnings come out yet?
Come again?
Just take the word TENDIES and with the same letter you can make the word POPCORN, easy like that
EVERYBODY IS CAPITULATING
i bought some RAD leaps. there were some rumors months ago that AMZN could tie up with them. just a small $500 yolo for me
sold my VFF calls last week rip
Remindme! 1/20/2020
Looking like a theta win
NIO beat earnings by 29%
Yeah we’re all fucked
Great it's gonna fuck put holders and call holders.  The WSB way.
I LOVE CHINNAAAA
back to green and +10% at open lol
market doesnt make sense
This guy is holding NIO calls HAHAHHAHAH
Ya they are
Palantir is next....
Hahaha NIO coming back to IV FUK everyone 🥴
IV might eat at em. Hope you were ATM or higher.
NIOOOOOOOO!!!
NIO is still top of my EV list. This earnings may have been insane, but this run up will continue, just on NIO's old schedule (where it takes several weeks and then experiences a pop).
Everybody falls the first time.
Wouldn't have printed with that IV
Back to the moon we go!🚀🚀🚀🚀
That was a huge drop, with little volume..
It’s coming back like the Revenge of the Nerds
RRUUGGGGG PULLLLL
now down 3%, green mode confirmed...
#TIS BUT A SCRATCH
Same. Burned 7k this morning myself. 

Luckily I'm balls deep in PLTR and had a big day to make up for it.
Most of this sub is holding shares
Hold up wait a minute
How you feeling today 😜 did you hold or sell?
Didn't they say earnings come out at 7?
And already pulling back up
HAHA RIP WHATWE MOONING BABYYY
Lol none of this post makes sense
Lol Nio dancing
Thank fuck I got out of NIO I can’t deal with this shit
Lol retard
Massive run-up before earnings?  What could possibly go wrong?
This is fucking insane
No, it's a good mature company. I bought 10 shares to hold til I die
This is the way.
i see, so i have a new strategy: use theta gang premium gains to buy FDs
Shares, bought at 14.
I actually made like 20%
I caught a case of severe retardation reading this.
its about being able to sleep at night
I mean, more is always better, but I bought the monday drop at $41.12, so we good.
I am neither but this movement right now isn’t all that surprising. Wouldn’t be surprised if it bounces back right before or after earnings. 


Again no positions here, god speed retards
[deleted]
[deleted]
Got them for $0.16 end of the day, I'm hoping so. I feel like I've seen the pattern of this week before and tomorrow should be 2% green on open at least. Maybe I'm wrong, but I only put all of my profits from today into overnighters.
The fuck just happened?

Why is it that when I step away from my screen it either moons or dumps?
LMFAOOOO
Not until it hits 35
Well.....reminding you to check the price again!
I mean... I feel bad but I was hoping for a Nio implosion. It's got good long term prospects but the IV was insane
We've been to hell,

NOW IT'S TIME TO GOTO THE MOON
Damn IV crushed
Excellent DD. I’m all in.
Flaaaaat
Wait wtf.
This stock is so fucking retarded i’m done
Damn Robinhood not filling my NIO IC
NIO REBOUND LIKE MJ 🏀
Dip is getting ate up. Nom nom nom
y’all fell for the ol NIO pump fake huh? Back to the moon we go
IV crush for everyone!
CCP buying NIO stock after hours
Damn is NIO actually going to live? 

&#x200B;

God I hope so
Did NIO achieve the power of retard strength??
NIO unaudited earnings look fantastic. This is stunning stuff
I have a feeling... NIO gonna be flat tomorrow...
Lol oh I thought earnings was later today
Hell yeah dawg fuck them gay bears
Why are people surprised China is red
If NIO holders aren’t retards then they’ll keep their shit tomorrow. Don’t let the gay bears win
dont count nio out yet in this manipulated pos market, it still might be $300 tomorrow they are playing it like mad rn

probably making the earnings report as we speak, you know, tweak it to get the desired outcome sort of shit.....
Citron is Happy af
someone pour me a god damn drink
It’s coming back YES yes YES YES LORD SAVE ME YES
Niophytes rekd
CHECK AGAIN!
Nio recovering FAST
I would look up a term called "IV crush" if I were you
Check again 📈
rip my 11/20 50c
Lol on everybody celebrating NIO AFTER HOURS when we can't do sh*t about our options until tomorrow am 😂😂
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ixntLruNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-ixntLruNs)
Nobody is panicking here on NIO, it’ll recover and bears 🐻 won’t be happy again
When Jim Cramer said young people love NIO stock. It’s a done story.
😂😂😂😂
Lol
NIO playing with everyone’s emotions 😂
$600 million revenue for billion dollar stock valuation lmao bro
Nio going flat, get fked both ways lmfaoooo
i loaded the fuck up around 2pm
fuck you already back up to 45
I thought the earnings was at 7
gonna be a tasty NIO dip tomorrow
Well NIO is probably going to manage to wipe half this sub again, one way or another

See ya'll at the breadline soon enough
Bruh wtf they beat earnings why is it tanking
[deleted]
Glad I sold puts and cashed in on that 260% IV 😂😂😂
It feels like every time i think i know what the market is going to do, it inverses me
Earnings are not out yet. This is not based on results, but rather peoples gut feelings. Earnings is not for a few hours.
Earnings you twat
nio call and put holders in shambles tomorrow
It’s okay if you lost money in NIO, I fomo’d into Tesla calls this morning and lost 1200 in 4 minutes.. we’ll get that bread back tomorrow
You right
You're gonna be ruined by IV crush sorry to tell you man
Bears are fun NIO
Confused at all the madness. Underwhelming, but still beat their estimate.
Holy shit it’s coming back!
Back to green by 7pm
Maybe you could have sold when you were up 😂
Don’t think half this sub realizes that both NIO bears and Bulls are about to be cucked by the 200+% IV NIO had. Anyone playing NIO weeklies is fucked
nio: beats earnings by 29%

also nio: plummets

make it make sense x
You must be new to this
NIO V shaped or K shaped recovery?
OMG
Nio retard V incoming
But I thought for sure that a chinese car company at All time highs, valued at 6 million dollars per car, was going to keep going up???????
Ya they are. They beat expectations by 29%
The dip happened about 2 minutes ago
This shit is hilarious
Does this mean we don't have to hear about NIO as much. Honestly, it'll probably be up by tomorrow morning. Puts seemed way too obvious, watch this shit trade 45-47 sideways tomorrow
Well this isn't aging well
I am. How low you thinking it will go?
Its gonna get pumped and you wouldn't have sold anyway lmao
Sometimes we gotta touch the stove, y'know?  Besides, there's a HUGE bull camp around $44-ish, already recovering ;)
No problem, wsb chat isn't great if you hold shares. They're all doing options in wsb and just shout & scream at any slight drop. I read so much shit about nio crashing here that I sold my nio & xpev at - 6% at open yesterday smh. That hurt. Nio will be 60-80 by march / April. Just read these comments as entertainment. That what I've learnt and also don't buy before earnings with normal stocks ( nio isn't normal lol)
yeet yeet nio beat
I think they're referring to the account number. If so then it's not bad advice bc I don't readily have the account # to give the FBI (and FINRA and state/local agencies) in the report. It certainly won't stop a hack, though. I've even read that 2FA won't always work and that it can be exploited by doing the sim card swap thing. So I was a bit unsure if 2FA was it was not the right choice.
That should teach you to invest in MURICA - AYRO gonna be the next TSLA?
NIO is climbing back - what kind of fuckery is this.
I've had worse days.
Tomorrow #1 trending google search: "what is IV cursh"
lol yup i have shares and the people that think this is dead are the real retards here
BABA slayed all call holders. Is it worth buying any short term FDs on this pos?
V SHAPED RECOVERY AH
Wait aren't those results....really good? Alright well I'm okay with the sell off then, only holding leaps and shares at this point.
[deleted]
YEAH NIO YEAH LETS GO BABY COME BACK TO PAPA
STOCKS GO DOWN AFTER EARNINGS NOT UP NOT EVER
Would love to see the google stats for “what is IV crush” searches rn
don’t make me cry
NIO with that V 👀

Trumps getting re-elected too don’t worry
Brothers, we are going down!
Link to NIO earnings?
100% calls tomorrow after that sweet iv drop
Guys I'm retarded so I want to know. I was betting on a big red dildo on NIO for tomorrow after earnings. I bought 47P for this friday. What yields more profit? Buying 47P ITM or going OTM like 40P??   


Thank you dearly, a fellow retard
ouch, sorry dude...good lesson on IV crush and earnings though
You guys really thought nio was gonna jump to like 60 after earnings 😂😂. To everyone who’s been on this sub for 3 minutes, welcome.
got 12/18 20c but yeah, holding.
56, didn’t wana get my stock called away if it went up a bit
This!!!! Playing with house money is the best way to do it
Swing low, sweet chariots.
Theta gang wins, lol put up only 3k to sell far otm FDs (\~15% profit) :S should've went 100k lol
NIO CRUSHED. TO THA MOON!
Not saying you're wrong. Just saying your DD is about a week later than anyone would have liked.
Holy shit is nio gonna recover fuck my puts
Brave souls catching a white hot falling knife
[removed]
Priced in but hey beating expectations is pretty nice, plus it's so close to being profitable.
Definition of retard strength
Nio-Nazis in shambles? Maybe not
Would not be surprised if NIO recovers bigly. We’ve seen a lot of ERs do this exact thing. Big initial drop, then recovers
Are you feeling it now mr crabs? Hahahahahha fuk u
Thetagang wants consistent money, at the best returns they can get while being consistent
http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/17/2128703/0/en/NIO-Inc-Reports-Unaudited-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html Nio earnings look Bullish to me
Bear trap
FUCK
Dare to try !

Why buy that dip when it’ll be at 30$ tomorrow

Wait wait NIO is coming back.
whelp glad i bought a couple puts a few days back in case nio got absolutely butt fucked.
Gay bears blew their load too early
So BABA sells off AH cuz of NIO wtf
I was thinking you just picked up a contract. I’m also bagholding calls over here but expiring 11/27
Dude earnings came out a few minutes ago, this is the reaction lmao
It’s breathing!!!!
COME BACK COME BACK TO ME
NEVER! STOCKS ONLY GO UP
ouchie...only 7% is kinda nice.... surprised its not way more, always tomorrow when it turns green
Holy fuck NIO is going to reverse hard and snap some bear necks
At least use lube if youre going to fuck me
🤣🤣🤣peg time
holy spy dildo batman
Imagine thinking this nosedive is real.
NIO pls
NIO to $50 tomorrow - earnings beat was priced in and now we feast on calls in the AM
glad i only bought 500 in NIO lmao clown company
Nervous yet? Lol
I make pretty great coffee...
Guh
WE WON NIO
Guidance will be good and nio will open green, then this whole sub will act like no one was surprised.
I've seen too much craziness AH on earnings this quarter to say it's over either way.
>FUCK IT TURNS OUT I AM RETARDED
IV crush dumbass
completely
NIO shhh shh shh, dont struggle, just give up. shhhhhh shhh shh
👀
A lot of moves tomorrow are going to be to unsub
Just waiting for Xi’s call.
Well yes, that. I’m in at 9.23 baby, let’s ride this shit
Numbers are released after hours
Lost porn gonna be glorious
What actually causes the after-hours loss? Looks like it's off a cliff? I'm new here...
Lol
Looking like NIO is just gonna IV crush everyones' nuts.
The nio downvote cucks are here praises!
ROFLMAO BEARS ON NIO, but you know we’re here to make money ❤️
Bears celebrating a low volume NIO sell off lmaooo!!! Going to $60 tomorrow
why did nio just fall off a cliff?
Same lol
Bro it dropped $5 in 5 minutes
I purchased puts...
Sing the Frozen theme song with me: Let it go, let it go... 🎶
Look like they beat revenue and EPS
No I haven’t played BA in a while
Yeah man.  Thank you, and your gayness!
Probably. I always am. But I got Jan 18s, so not sweating it too much. But from pre-market to close was such a fucking downer.
Why imagine when you could experience irl?
Oh ok we good now
Why is it dropping????
Remindme! 4 weeks
Watch this thing do a triple reversal backflip and go to ath tomorrow

I honestly don’t get why people are shocked when stocks fall after earnings. Seems like the norm, especially after a big run up.
Bye bye account. I may very well have sold you one of those.
There it goes, doesn't seem like enough move though, theta gang wins again?
Remember when luckin Coffee was the WSB hype stock
Mm mm mm. Them tasty salty tears. Mm mm mm.
surprisingly nio is holding up more than i thought it would. was expecting 38ish
I wonder how many people won't be around tomorrow morning because nio forced them to long rope
get back down there where you belong
Happy for you man. To come back from that loss. Good job!!
Don't worry, a new one will rise once again
Haha
┬─┬ノ(ಠ_ಠノ)
WAIT SHE'S BACK
LOL so which one of y’all bought a nio call at the peak 😂😂😂
$PLTR is like my child. I’m just so excited to see where they wind up when they grow up so I’m willing to stick with them
That was the dip...
These new tards are gonna say “but they beat earnings by a little bit why isn’t it mOoNiNg?” And then IV crush is gonna want to have round 2
Nio bulls looking for any kind of cope right now.
NIO drilling to levels not seen since yesterday
NIO IS RECOVERING ❤️
LOL maybe cause it was an overhyped chinese meme
Here? Lol I'm holding this long term I could give a fuck if it drops from earnings like its done time and time again
[deleted]
[deleted]
Nio Earnings result, first thought: 

This is a step in the right direction
WSB is 67% bullish

Proceed with caution
ya im gonnna lose like $1500, not a fucking back breaker but it hurts knowing how much is was about an hour ago
Soros Sells PLTR rotates into NIO. It will rise like PLTR did after dropping post ER

11/17: 1.6 million degenerates

XPEV to 30 by tomorrow please
Really? You just randomly decided to scroll through thousands of comments and read them until you found a funny one?
Y'all think my 11/20 40P is going to print tomorrow?
Don't worry NIO memers...have you heard about our lord and savior PLTR?
Yeah lame as fuck
It just keeps going 🤣
Damn NIO ate my ass

PLTR 17.5 C 11/20 is free money
My only regret is not buying more puts on this subs favorite bullshit Chinese ev company. Get fucking rekt scrubs
Stonks gonna stonk (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
FUCK I INVESTED MY KIDS COLLEGE FUND ON THIS SHIT STOCK
There were so many comments warning everyone with NIO weeklies about IV crush. Now you gonna get -90% with IV crush and the drop. Cant wait to buy in tho lol
I’m crying happy tears now
Lol I’m only here to see the crying about NIO
I did :)
Bring out those loss porns !!!
Ban
We’ll at least I’m holding shares
Sorry not sorry nio bulls

NIO 65 by Open
https://twitter.com/yolocapitalmgmt/status/1328806119578415111?s=21 🦄😉
Touché
To the NIO put holders:

F
This is what we live for in this sub. 

^(plz stop the pain)
Does anyone know what’s happening to Nio? Short selling before earnings?
[deleted]
46?
Why did NIO fall 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Indeed. Call skew was crazy
Their guidance is ass
Wait for it
Where’s the NIO support thread
Nio drilling = nio still in 40s lol
https://youtu.be/G44xTr8D_bw

One time for the NIO call holders 🙏🏼🐻🌈
I guess it was the responsible thing to do
Damn I held off on getting FD puts after that EOD dump
The ATH is only the ATH until it's not.


Lol @ NIO
ER
[removed]
NIO -8% AH
NIO puts 🤤
RIP to all the poor bastards that bought weeklies for NIO
I sold some of my NIO calls at 3% and the rest at 9% AMA.
I’m literally gonna lose 10k at open on NIO at open
>I was bleeding... then I averaged down... now I'm fuuuuuuucked

This hits too close to home
Beating earning doesn’t mean it will go up 🤡...as if the market is that simple
[deleted]
😂😂
I officially divorced NIO

this bitch is a piece of shit
NIO earnings leaked?!
🤡🤡🤡
**to theta gang: i don’t get it**

genuine question: i made hundreds instead of thousands, why would you do this? is the goal of theta gang to live a comfy life during the stock market? is it to make a weekly income? is it to sacrifice risk for safety?

i did make money—finally—but not as much if i had bought FDs. so is theta gang all about getting certain money?
I bought one call, I singlehandedly tanked NIO
No we all kinda thought this would happen lol
Got  nio 50 puts. Sweet sweet tendie city
F to all the call holders
🤡🤡🤡
I got out of nio yesterday morning the best decision looool
\-0.12 EPS
[deleted]
Hey bulls if you spread your cheeks, relax, and hum your favorite tune, it'll hurt less
[deleted]
[deleted]
why did i only sell 1 naked call on nio?
will nio be the black swan?
Sweet georgia blue wave will make all the positions I own rocket
NIO 8$ by end of the week
Straight to fucking hell
Wtf is happening to NIO? 😤
Yes
How bad are NIO puts gonna get theta raped tomorrow?
NIO 20p might be ITM by open
Every earnings NIO dumps. Call buyers are retarded
Get fukt
Your Twitter DDs convinced me to close out the PSTH covered calls I had on my position (why I sold them in the first place no idea). PSTH is literally half of my portfolio - in Ackman we trust!
I’m a NIO Bull 😥
Time for the newbies to google what IV crush means lol.
No... I sold my put before close. Fellow autists told me to get rid of it.
I’m rock hard for this drill right now
Fear due to Citron.
Haha nicely done
 RIP NIO NOV2020-NOV2020
NIO beat expectations which is great!!!
TSLA sends his regards
NIO is the new China Virus
And just like that, there were no more Nio shills.

NIO Puts? HAPPY


Tesla Calls? NOT HAPPY
Possibly Kodak again from a couple things I’ve heard or just wait till tonight for more sentiment to gauge that’s what I’m doing
Should have held onto my NIO puts into earnings instead of taking a small profit.  FML
DO NOT BE A BITCH. POST THAT LOSS PORN TOMORROW

Bye bye annoying NIO call holders. You won’t be missed
1 flash crash please...
Nio is a fucking crackhead
Die NIO
Most predictable earnings in a while. Big beat but too hyped and run up too fast. Sold covered 11/20 56 calls, who bought them?
Congrats bro. Set some aside for taxes and champagne
[deleted]
ITS STILL DIPPING😈
If you thought nio was going to go any differently you belong here.
Bottom at 41$ REBUYYYY
NIO lmao
Chickened out and sold some of my pltr calls at 3:59 for a 3.5k loss. Still up on the day 2k and the last 5 days by 10k so not all bad just annoying.

Didn't trust MMs overnight to not screw with it.
Sorry for your loss
So I bought NIO at $19 sold at $50, good idea to re-enter tomorrow?
Frfr praise allah of all ages
holy fuck. well, it doesn’t mean anything until tomorrow 9:30am
Shhh don’t tell them. This was my exact play today. BoL to us.
It’s gonna bounce back eventually... fuck my short exp dates tho
HAHAHA RETARDO
We’ll rest in pieces
NIO beat by 29%
I’m flat out terrible at this and even I knew not to hold NIO through earnings
Pouring one out for you nio boyz
Imagine if Bill big dick spacman bought it via PSTH
Amzn is great, but the stock is either going to be dead for a few months or it needs to drop. It's too far ahead of itself givern price to sales, even with all the growth.
Which idiot is selling
wsb going down to 100k members tomorrow 😂😂😂😂
I love watching these WSB shill stocks take an absolute shit.
Thanks haha. I'm planning on holding long and adding to my positions aswell as new positions that come up along the way. I'm thinking of getting into options trading but I still have lot to learn. 5 months ago I knew barely anything about the stock market
NIO PUTS GO BRBRBRBRBRBBRR
NIO is a buy at $20
Forreal, too many people out here tryna lose money
🎶 How low can you go, how low can you go 🎶
What time is NIO reporting since they're in China

Are 11/20 32 nio puts gonna print tomorrow I’m kinda confused if I bought them to close to expire
Hey NIO... Where ya goin' Buddy?

As long as you don't have an ibkr account you're OK. Otherwise, you can just keep buying even if you don't have money.

The leverage loan amount is piling up for me. Just had to deposit again to keep leverage in check. 

Don't worry. You won't get addicted. 

*doesn't buy anything so I have more money for options *

Ya... You'll be OK *takes another hit*
Jumping into Nio tomorrow morning, it needed some pullback

Don't have a position in NIO but watching this AH action is even making me nervous...
Guys I have a really bad feeling about BA. I bought at the literal top when it finally was recovering when stim started (230). I have shares, been hodling for a long time. Is it finally time to dump this shit and cut my losses?
People are sleeping FOLD it is steadily climbing up and gives me great profits :-)

You sir are totally correct, in my head WMT and TGT would run up into earnings so the strat was to sell day before. WMT moved nicely, TGT not so much which put me in the bag holding position
No one mnows

It's called not being good at this game. Probably want to go back to minecraft or League of Legends.... Whatever cesspool you came from.
I don’t have any NIO, but this right here is the truth. Guys on here buy at the tippy top and then post “WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY (insert stock) CALLS?!?”

I’ve been playing this game a relatively long time and CCL is far and away the most retarded stock. Makes Kodak look like a joke.
Damn it is tanking

Spy $380 EOW
Damn bro you’re that salty? Get a life moron
So you don’t see them coming back to 40-45$? I’m not looking long term. Most knee jerk reactions in the market have a rebound affect I try to capture those when I can.
Lol
Amazing that you can feel anything at this point.
Trickle down economics
***RIP NIO gang***, a WSB production
I bought nio puts yeahh

[deleted]
NIO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[deleted]
NIO DED????
F for nio call holders
So you blew up your account on NIO or TSLA today? 

Buy high, and sell low? Feeling like your world is crashing in? It’s not. You’ll be ok. Your risk tolerance is wild enough for you to be here. You will get through this. Take a break and come back fresh. Don’t chase your losses. Talk to some comrades here about how dumb your plays were. If you still feel like you can’t handle life; check out the resources below. There’s no shame in reaching out. My inbox is always open as well, though response time may vary. Worst case, there’s always bankruptcy, and even that isn’t the end of the world.

NIO TO 20 LETS FUCKEN GOOOOOO
Had rebought some calls that were only up 2% whenever the soros news broke and it dropped. Recovered from -6 to -3.5 as the dip was bought up but didn't trust MMs overnight.
Up 70% on pltr February calls. I need 500%

I’m gonna poop on your chest
No Metrowest area. My house is 1.6 million, nice try.
blue sky coming
Ohhhb shit we drillin
Oh fuck NIO
You're truly retarded if you let your life savings sit overnight during earnings of the most volatile stock ever
Nio is not posting till 1700 gmt
Rip to the NIO call holders
jesus nio with  Tourette lol
Fuckkkk nio
Theta wins on NIO?

GOOD BYE NIOOOOOO
Should have reloaded NVDA at 330pm 

Holding a bit of DLTR
Explain
It was revealed he bought in in 2012. Now he says he regrets it and will start sell off, complaining about ethics of the company.
“Ahhh go crazy ahhh go stupid” - NIO
Agreed, fucker is old as dirt.
I was thinking about getting tested for covid but then realized with my shit insurance it would cost like $2000. Would much rather yolo on options.
People buying up NIO shares after hours (right before earnings release), driving up the price = true retards
Why do the downvote bots come after close every single day?
im long term bullish on nio, but all these posts this week in anticipation of ER are giving me similar vibes to PRPL and how a lot of retards presumed it would moon on one particular ER. needless to say my entire timeline was flooded with PRPL loss porn immediately after ER.
This entire sub is watching Nio ER even if they aren't positioned.

NGL I'm excited. Already made my 10 bagger on it, happy with whatever happens for you guys.
Ni-noooooooooo,, ohhhhhhhhh. woooooooaaaaa, nooooo, yooooooo, sooooooo, HF
So is RIOT pumping higher on shitcoin?
[deleted]
Shit on your face asshole
no thank you
Robinhood thanks you for your option fees and tells you to get fucked. In other news, water is wet.
Best ask v best bid PLTR right now woah

65k bid v 425k ask
WTF
Super bowl of earning. Some will get rich. Someone will be poor.
IV crush is a helluva drug
Can someone please poke BABA
Could be. Did the news break today?
Same thank god i overslept
Yeah I got the 162.5 a few weeks back, basically sitting close to even. Only reason I played it was they mooned last ER and wanted to gamble. I also bought WMT same time and sold day before ER for a nce 60% gain . I rarely gamble with no time to recover after ER but hey taking a shot
The translator on the NIO call sounds hot buy shares
NIO!
Remindme! 4 weeks
Will PLTR keep printing me money or should I try and time it
[deleted]

NIO mooning
go big or go home. Not gonna make much buying itm calls.
What is this you speak of?
Shasta is where the weed is at Redding is where the meth is made
We can’t be sure about anything in life. IV is relatively low considering this has had crazy momentum for a while. Buying longer dated calls should still be a safe bet. I was comfortable with Dec calls, I’m already in some profit since buying at the bottom this morning and if volatility increases I’ll sell.
NIO Chinese strobe light AH
Oh god NIO
this nio chart is crackin the fuck out man
[deleted]
NIO AH doing the worm
You think gov contracts grow on trees? They've already won all the contracts they're gonna get...this is pure WSB euphoria that will end like every other meme stock does
Logically speaking here’s another good point, do you guys realize how confident NIOs CEO is. He already knows they are killing it that’s why he doesn’t act like an autistic child like Elon musk. The man already knows where the company is headed.
Think I’m buying stocks to sell them next week? That’s what options are for.
Is baba ded?
We love you! Come to the moon with us
Nio pick a side lol
YESSSSS
Sold my NIO calls for the week and plonked them in PLTR, will hop back in after IV crush does its thing. Will buy back after a week at whatever price point, bullish long term on EVs in general.
50% gain overnight watch’n’learn
NIO BEATS, GUIDES HIGHER
As a Palantarian, I wish the fellow Niotians good luck.
Nio having an aneurysm
If we had a rule where you could only post DD if you didn’t have a financial stake in your prediction and you were actually serious about the stance, we might only lose half of our portfolios any given week.

NEEEEE OOOOOOOOO!!!!
Can’t wait to see NIO shit the bed
Earnings haven’t come out yet
Damn nio AH looking crazy
uh oh
This NIO price action is preposterous. Up and down entire dollars in AH in the space of a second.
Expiration is 11/20.  Probably should have mentioned that.
Excited to watch NIO from sidelines
some car company I forgot the name though
I went to business school in Shanghai and my freshman year roommate ended up getting hired by NIO right out of school. He told me just now that there's been a lot of hush hush meetings and a ton of top level executives getting fired in the past week or so and people are starting to get worried. On top of that, the girl he's going out with works in accounting and when he was over at her place one day he got a glimpse of some paperwork indicating due to massive accounting fraud they're anticipating a 90%+ drop in stock price all the way down to $4.20
Thanks dude
You trynna hook a homie up
You honestly can't find entertainment like this elsewhere.   Love it
If it goes up, I should have bought more, if it goes down, I should have waited to buy.
[removed]
HOLD ON TO YOUR BUTTS
no
RIP in peace NIO gang
BAN
Someone who held their NIO 70c 11/20
Got my life saving on NIO
Best ask v best bid PLTR right now woah
My dream is that one day the grandchildren that I could have had if I didn't abort their parents will look around and say

"Grandpa, how did you build this mansion and whats a FD?"
Nio is doing the worm
NIO thrashing wildly
We will take you
Op bought it pre earnings
5 min before close, I bought 4 puts ( to inverse myself) and 2 calls ( to hedge my inverse).

Why the $20 strike price. The further otm the less valuable it will be when it expires. If it does exp in the money. You should pick up itm calls bro wtf are you doing?
The Halvin'ing is going to occur today lol
lmaoo there’s a bunch of children in the discord voice chat
Dont worry guys I sold my nio calls before close so that means it's going to the moon tomorrow. Your welcome call holders
godspeed to you then sir
It’s going to be pandemonium in here once ER is released
Will buy puts and switch to fidelity
Soros 'regrets' PLTR. He regrets it for cuck-esque ESG reasons, not bc it's a bad company. Grow up bears.
in 3 hours LOL
7pm est
IV CRUSH
If it opens high sell quick, it will dump when all these retards realize they made bank on earnings
win/win
it's been an hour - how has mainstream news not brought up this muhfucking strike against the US embassy yet?

word on twitter is that iran has claimed responsibility
Fuck off

The true villain all along when an earnings report goes bust.

Mrna always tanks a few days after good news
Why it’s up ????????
As long as nio moves im happy.
U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as the market’s recent rally cooled off amid a sharp decline in drug store shares and disappointing economic data.
AMZN really faded to 0.15 plus🤡🤡🤡

NIO watch party on discord do it
Watch NIO go flat after earnings
Oh thank god now we know it’s gonna go up 😂 you should posted this earlier!
What can I say, I like pain
Yikes
Shit strike and only 1000 total at risk? Smallstreetbets is a thing
What?  You’ll be making bank after earnings
Held my positions +124% or 4500 in gains
FUCK YEAH
Vroom, jfrog, bigc, asana, sumo, rxt, auvi All had large corrections. Please open your mind to the possibility that you could be wrong.

Investors have been bag holding this shit for years. If your time horizon is to hold PLTR for 3 years like my Roomate is that’s fine. But don’t think PLTR is somehow special and immune to a healthy drop for a reload
She hot
Not likely bruh.   


might have to wait a week
Bought TGT calls on wrong account and now I have to hold these suckers through earnings. Fuck
I know. I think he might’ve mean buying a put or a call without a hedge. Or, like I said, might be a tard
Bought more AMC puts, but the market is more retarded than me so I might get fucked
How tf did you lose money on pltr
If NIO loses I’m margin calles
u short?
NIO to 60😈
Sure, my reply is that I call out lefty propagandists as well. It's your idiotic partisan bullshit that drags everyone down. 

So fuck you, R propagandist

🤡
CCL, watch Planet Fitness. See that? Now you try.
The only thing saving my fucking puts at this point is if joe biden announces he has Covid in the next few hours. Fuck!
You still can, aftermarket is open

how mad for FSR holders
Calls on loose butthole tomorrow
Good luck my fellow NIO brothers. May we all dine in 10 bagger land
A lot accounts about to be wiped out.
I’m about to take a vicious dicking aren’t I
NIO FTW. I sold some 40$ puts, hopefully they go to 0 tomorrow.
I haven't checked this sub today. I bought in at 46 this morning with plans to hold no matter what because Im optimistic about earnings. I was happy to see it climb all day. I check my phone 20 minutes later and all gains had been wiped out.
Imagine having massive anxiety for the next 17 hours because you decided to buy commie tesla over Soros CIA operative chad PLTR...
Unoriginal and a narc
I read it was 6pm EST is when it will release. Makes sense because that's roughly 7 in the morning in China.
I think you should add some PLTR.
$TSLA 500 eow
i been saying neo
Thats weird it says my break even is 39.65 but very hilarious
nio gang good luck

🍿🤭
You’re about to be your wife’s boyfriend now
What color lambo are you getting?
Man FUCK Baba. I hope it works for you but this stock has sucked nothing but dick for a week now
Dec 31st, $300
You sold? You dungoofed. NIO will be going up after earnings. Its going to hit 48/49 after market and tomorrow it will be 55$
Is nio ER tomorrow AH? I bought 999999 shares at $49
It’s a win win thoigh
I didn’t hear anything
I think one of the positive outcomes of the mRNA vaccines potentially getting authorization first is that high risk groups will have access to these. By the time vaccines are available to low risk groups, it’s likely that we’ll have a choice between more than a few vaccines. 

I’m not sure if I can justify apprehension towards mRNA vaccines based on the research and studies we’ve seen so far, but I think it’s reasonable to opt for a technology that we’ve studied for a longer period if they’re both available.
Chinese government finalizing the NIO ER as we speak.
CVS and WBA will be fine but GDRX just got their lunch taken by AMZN
I think that's free money most likely
IV is way too high either way if you weren't holding before this week
9pm on the 9th green.  Where something nice.
6 PM
chickened out and sold my pltr calls for a -3.5k loss at the end

Still up 2k on the day but ouch
The only reason Robinhood is going public is because they about to go bankrupt covering our margin calls.
[deleted]
If NIO dumps, it’ll be the REEEEE heard around the world. IM SO EXCITED and only have two way otm puts.
Yupppp
You’re telling the wrong guy. I’m 3 months and $8k into AstraZeneca options.

F
It’s already priced in and will 📉
I already regret not selling my NIO shares. Just couldn't pull the trigger.
LMAO
that’s may be likely unless it runs the rest of the week—good luck with whatever you do

Come on NIO, big hulk dick for daddy. Shilling can’t help now
Dude.  No way NIO hits that.
My Girlfriend said I could CREAM PIE in her if NIO open over 50 tomorrow. But if it goes bellow 45 she’s going to PEG me. I’m soooooo nervousssss 😬😬😬😬
I was curious who was playing with me.

I’m not sure myself. I don’t own any.
GL NIO brothers, we as king Leonidas would say "tonight we dine in hell"
Well its out of our hands now
Yes
Whut’s a share
This is the part in The Matrix when NIO is shot by Agent Smith but gets back up. He is The One
Picked up some PLTR 20c 11/20.

If this goes badly that's it for my account.
GREEN brrrrrr
At the same car sales/profitability tesla was valued way less in 2013. Its so over pumped its insane. WSB at it again
shitpost
Depends your strike and expiry, if you check the breakeven that's what it would need to do at the current price to be a wash. For profits it's past that, so $47c 11/20 would need a gain over $4 just to lose no money.
NIO options holders yall have my thoughts and prayers
Puts loaded
Never thought I’d go bankrupt trading side by side with an Autist
Also. Every month I’m buying ITM options with my paycheck. That at the very least should offset the initial yolo amount if the stock just raises at a normal rate
It did in the day
You can 100% do it, you can also leg out intraday which is nice if you want exposure overnight without a ton of theta burn
I know they need some viagra
godspeed NIO holders
no, just dont buy shit that expires in under 3 weeks, and don't chase WSB euphoria.
forsenCD Clap Market manipulation
Any reason why LU dropped a whopping 24%?
[deleted]
good luck to all the NIO bulls.
What time nio report?
Hopefully it goes up or I will cry
Jesus BA been such a bag these past weeks. Congrats call holders
It might get posted before then
Too many tards trying to self promote shitty forced memes
Despite all the negativity nio held strong and finished green. Chinese company can’t fail , expanding into EU, gains coming. Congrats to the bulls

NIO bears probably held back waiting for more dip during covid crash in March
Bearish
I thought people died from that shit
that eod nio dump was the most beautiful shit i eva seen
I don’t understand how so many people here always get on the same play. Groupthink is a hell of a drug.
Cash money
god damn it the nio earnings call isn't till 4PST/7EST
$NIO is gonna open $55 easy. Look what happened to the other Chineese EVs at earnings.
eod is here
Higher lows almost every day. This things still in a strong uptrend 😂
Tried selling at 2:59, phone froze, DIAMOND MOTHER FUCKING HANDS NIO CALL ACTIVATED. God speed to this retard.

Bought some at open today, not ideal but holy fuck that is some serious growth. Just wishing I had bought more
Soros is a gay bear
Any $CRSR pumpers in the chat
Is it pronounced "n'eye'o" or "neo"?
WHAT TIME IS NIO ER
Is it considered insider trading if I have a friend who works in enterprise sales for a publicly traded company and he tells me how there sales and customer retention are looking this quarter?
Market was pumping financials - now it's energy. It's not rocket science guys. Find the underperforming sector and jump in
As I was 😥
Nio Ramen

Kinda nice not having a position in this shitshow. Good luck you crazy bastards

NIO is going to have to go to like $3 for those to break even lol
Sold some NIO puts. Dont disappoint me fuckers
Hell yeah that’s nice consolidation around the 435/440 support.
Theta gang gonna cancel them both out
NIO is about to bleed red
GL all with NIO ...let's go!!!! Lol feel like the Kentucky Derby just went off
The weeklies 17.5 still gonna print right? It has to drop by friday?
NIO ER time...
Crsr wow
Since I sold my puts and bought SPY calls it will probably crater to 350 tomorrow
I’m disappointed I bought at the fucking top
Stupid 10:30 rule
I bought 10 shares and then a long dated $500 spread for May 2022. I might be saying effff lol

Bear heart attack.
Used a day trade to lock in $5 profit. Now accepting applications for my new fund.

I must say that NIO graph is classic wsb meme stock action

10/10
When's earnings ahhhhh
am i screwed for holding tesla 475$ calls expiring this week 🤣
I’ve called every single ER correctly, NIO is going to moon. Not trying to make anyone mad I just tell it how it is. Just wait for those ER it’s going to be like xpeng times 2 or 3

“IT’S OUT OF MY HANDSSSSS.......BUT I’M STILL IN CONTROLLLLLL” - NIO Call Holders
Down 52% on my Tesla 1 week calls
Positions: 
100 shares &  11/20 38c
These ig/Tiktok videos make me hate this sub now. I want to be taken to the real wsb, with real dd. (Shout out to the guy who made me buy pltr last week)
60 contracts of 11/20 80c. 

What’s $600 anyways. My net worth is almost twice that.
this is the way
55c live fast or die young
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure playing with you
anyone see apple spike 1.19+?
QQQ closed juuuuust below the lower bounds of the new downtrend. THere's more to go tomorrow!
I think you're confused by the concept of an average (which... dear Lord). But my day is almost done and I'm bored so I'll lay this out:

I buy 100 Shares of ABC at $10

I buy 100 shares of ABC at $11

My average price per share is $10.50. If I sell at $15.50, I make $1,000. Why? I made $550 on the first 100 shares and $450 on the second 100 shares. My profit is higher for buying the second 100 shares even though I made less money on them. My return on investment (the percentage gain I made) is lower for buying the second set of shares. ROI is an important factor in making an investment decision. But generally that's compared with making a different investment.

Honestly kid (God, I hope you're young), learn a little bit more about the fundamentals of investing before you lose a bunch of money.

Were still in tsla or no?
👁👄👁
Im so mad I bought these when they were just OTM and they’re down like 30% now
holding NIO leaps, so i cant really be bothered about earnings today, but my JMIA calls are printing BIGGGGGGLY
lol honestly got saved there but gains are gains. nice
retarded
[deleted]
7pm EST/8am HK time
NIO moon to $55 after earnings. 

Then the orange baby will deploy Chyna block and NIO will plummet to $35.
Yeah he's gonna lose it
Spy 362 1DTE YOLO BABY 🍆📈
It's been an honor serving with you gentlemen.
In 2 hours...
Bought a last minute NIO put, has to drop 20% so fuck it lets see what happens
If you bought yesterday under 44 bucks today is all green.
I feel the same but none of the retards think it priced in.
Thank you for the confirmation bias
[deleted]
I’m in a 1.20 ea
She’ll probably be brought back to a vote with more Republican senators present (couple had to quarantine) so not done yet
Yeah messed up, I went away and it had gone up $1 so I thought it was going up more
Jumped on Alibaba. Xi show some kindness on joke-ma.
ok nio what is it pump or dump........
[deleted]
Guys the moment of the truth has arrived, Hold on to the seats tight. GO NIO GO
Pencils down everybody
disappointed in PLTR, couldn't even reach $18
The moment of truth has come. let’s go NIO!
Really?
NIO 💎🙌🏼 🚀🚀
You people realize a China company won’t release earning til maybe 8 tonight.?
IV crush will kill you bud
I'm just super new hahaha so seeing so much green/red scares the shit out of me.
Of course we didn't
Red pill time
The calm before the retarded Nio storm 😈
TTD does nothing but make quiet moves up bro
"Old Jewish Boomer engages in virtue-signalling to keep up the facade that he is some nice-guy-do-gooder instead of a slimy globalist reptile".  
Nothing wrong with PLTR's fundamentals. I assume Soros is intelligent and actually saw PLTR as a promising investment back when he bought in.  
Bullish.
Damn AMZN you were so incredibly disappointing today.
No, I like Etrade. Their Power Etrade app is nice. You pay zero commission on stock trades, and a small fee on options. 

Their fills are fast and frequently fill under my ask.
🚀
DICKS DOWN, ITS TIME TO WATCH NIO
is there a NIO earnings thread somewhere?
ITS TIME FOR THE SHOW!
Wtf is that volume?! WTF?!
That’s your call man, just saying there is literally 0 negative catalyst...the worst of 2020 is behind us and over now. Fear index is ded like bears
I think your phone was upside down when buying that dip.

Mine too... fucking fomoed that sheeeit. Garsh dang it.
Bett than that *god damned fucking horn*
GOD SPEED TO US
Russia bad
MISTER ANDERSON
I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL
what time is nio er
Ok on that thought, so if NIO goes up, why isn't that assumption also gone? NIO would be the higher valued company and then XPEV goes down.
Thank you for your TED talk.
I was banking on that old tsla vibe completely and probably just burned 5 grand
Alright all the retards all locked in 

Which way you going NIO
weenies down
The longest 2 hours ever.
Thank you now I can not be depressed
Aight , time to hit the showers PLTR gang
F
WHAT TIME IS NIO ER
I held my nio 11/20 50c. Diamond hands
I need a fucking drink

How much more money would you have made if you did no DD and just made every move assuming stonks only go up
Aah fuck I am gonna wait it out and see where we drift pre-market

I feel like they may come back down with some actual profit taking but we'll see
I was close close to being you.. whew
pencils down

Theta gang
Always laughed when I would listen to my company’s earnings calls and the ceo and cfo were ultra composed but not 20 min prior they would say shit fuck and bitch loudly
What’s a pamp
What a wack ass eod pump
Many years from now, A sentient being will stumble upon this and a light bulb will go on: this was the chain of events that led to the crash of our civilisation .
God speed
Good luck NIO holders!!!
By the way, we won't see NIO earnings for another two hours.
Solid DD, thanks!
well today was exhausting
Nio had more than double volume any other stock today.
That last candle wasn't very cool. Wasn't very legal.
DICKS DOWN
FRAUDULENT after market sales!!!
[deleted]
Nah he didn’t, meme stock earnings always lead to big dips(see RKT about 2 months ago)
If you bought nio puts you are officially fuk
NIO 41p 11/20 (x11)

Bring me the tendies!!!
Close enough https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvf737/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_17_2020/gckv47v?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
CCL has to drop right? I have 17.5 puts. They gonna print?
Hope everyone chose correctly
Your strike is way closer than mine lol
And that's time, who here is going to experience his first IV crush tomorrow? Raise those hands.
Okay NIO gang. The time is here. Good luck.
Lol I held........
YALLA
Pencils down.
ding ding ding ding ding
Pencils down!
my baby brother works for NIO, he said it's gunna pamp tomorrow.
Good luckin to all the NIO autists
Last minute. Get those puts boys
Mistake
time to find out if NIO is the chosen one
New stock is priced at $22.25, i think its got another red day or 2
about to fucking blow
317m volume. You guys are insane
If your wrong I’m crying my self to sleep tonight. I just sold
I’m more interested, as a non NIO investor, with what happens with it than my own damn stocks!
It’s “your”

I would know...I’m retarded
I was worried about that but a double negative also makes too much sense. The most illogical thing to do is buy calls, so I bought calls
Does this have anything to do with tightening regulations on Chinese owned companies by SEC?
active management
ADD PLTR TO THE SPY
HOLD ONTO YOUR SEATS RETARDS
The fact that she was even considered is truly horrifying.
It will blow through 50
HERE WE GO BOYS. BEST OF LUCK TO ALL INVOLVED. FOR ALL MY SHIT TALKING THE NIO BULLS. WERE IN THIS TOGETHER. BULL OR BEAR. RIDE OR DIE
Theta says hello
Place your NIO bets
Imnin the same boat.
Sorry people were  rude to you but you should be very careful investing in anything with your current level of understanding, despite the joking nature of this sub its sounds like you arent ready. I hope you havent done anything with options if you have you should try to git rid of them or get someone to help you immediately. Your question makes me concerned you are a mistake away from being in massive debt.
And I just pussied out 3k 44 strike... I'm such a pussy
Goodbye you all!!!
god speed Nio retards.
Maybe from both bulls and bears, given the IV on options rn lol
It dropped on share dilution so not really bearish at all
I just asked a question and my their calling me donkey and just downvoting, fuck they this place is way better
For NIO and palantir and whatever retarded FOMO stocks are surging...yeah I’m the gayest bear out there
DOMP IT
That's a fat green dildo on PLTR to finish the day
Are those stocks?
Pencils down!!!!!!
They really do have 13 year olds trading on RH holy shit
That’s not a bad point. And don’t get me wrong. This is a gamble. Albeit not a big gamble for some people on this sub. But it’s definitely a huge one for me. That being said, I don’t really have much to lose. This won’t cripple me.

I need the stock to basically double in two years in order to break even. It’s almost doubled from 3 months ago. And they’ve barely just started expecting profit. The company doesn’t have a competitor and has something like a 95% customer retention rate. They are in talks with the UK gov about corona tracking which by itself could be a 25% increase. Especially if other governments go in for it. Yes it’s risky. Anything can go wrong at any time. But I’m willing to risk it for a possible 10 bagger. Maybe a 100 bagger.
Tonight were only going to count the legal green candles, not the fraudulent illegal red candles.
Congrats, would have gave you gold if I sold at 18.5...

Alright class, put your pencils down and pass your test to the front. Lets see who's the most autistic of all
How can I be loaded to the tits in puts and gain nothing on that dip.  Might have been too bearish

If you sell OTM covered calls along side buying long calls, and holding stock, it's considered a spread position that allows you to collect premium and benefit from stock increase up to the strike price of the OTM covered call and can net you more money. It also trains traders to pick out price targets, and narrow our expected price movement ranges which can multiply experience.

Your stocks will get called away only at a price you agree to be happy selling them at... so if you buy at $100 and you sell a covered call at $120 and it shoots to $130 You'll sell at a 20 profit + what you made in premium. The probability analysis will tell you the likelihood it would go passed the $120 strike price and you can manage your risk that way so that the likelihood of collecting premium is higher than missing out on additional gains above your capped MAX gain at the OTM strike price.
It might be a double negative. Get puts instead
youre gonna make 100 bucks
They paused the vote. "Key" Republican Votes have not been counted according to Fuhrer Mcconnell. The process will continue later this week...These Fucks still ain't done shitting on everything.

NIO taking off
At least you recognize this as most don't.  Most that hit home runs on low percentage plays tend to blow their accounts out pretty quickly.
Remember inverse WSB
Imagine thinking NIO would honestly report any losses
I would but I'm in DDOG
I constantly see your political garbage. The frequency leads me to consider you a propagandist.

People are reasonable in this thread?
Somehow up 100% today on my VMWare calls even tho it’s only up 1%
logically puts, so get calls
No I BELIEVE it, but also am in disbelief that an entire nation has run out of beds before flu season even commenced.
That’s exactly what it looks like to me, but I’m not an institutional investor so I don’t know how big money like that really works. In general, selling options is a bullish move, but the goals can vary.

This is a Wendys
CVS broke multi year down trend line and is finally having rallying, options are cheap after todays sell off.
Lol
Lmao
I sneezed and farted at the same time. That caused the dip.
Man thanks, that was a great idea. Now I'm so not stressed. Got 45 in and I'll put 45 in tom. If it goes down I got money to average down and set myself up long term, and if it goes up then I ride the wave.
LOL
NIO puts locked in
NIO taking off,

last chance to hop in bois

you will be regret not to
Mainly $16 calls and a single $20 call. After hearing something about employees being able to sell their shares in early January im probably going to sell the calls late December. I could see this stock hitting 25+ EOY when I cash out
That’s a sign!
was scalping and as i was going to take profit, TSLA free falls. got in at 418.45.. so i kept averaging down in hopes that it would go back up to the 415-420 range & it never did... until the S&P news. then the rest is history
Retarded leading the retarded

Edit* it went up $50 in 2 weeks, why can’t it do it again? That would put us well above $400
That’s fucking bold. Godspeed, retard.
Reminder: if you're still holding NIO weekly options in 3 minutes, congratulations you're officially retarded
Right? Like without IV it’s a def a play, but 200%? Unless NIO goes bankrupt or joins the S&P idk man

Probably early investors wanna cash out at a high public multiple before it’s too late. Competition is too strong and their service can be easily disrupted by big tech / competitors like SQ, brokers, banks etc.

OH god no. The lesson is to be a luckier gambler in the future. wtf are you on about?
I thought XPEV would do better today.  We'll see what the NIO earnings brings to the party.

I have spoken.
its like i refuse to take profit.. was up 104% down to only up 18%
You act like the money you got out of it won't earn the same exact money it would've had you held. You can always jump back in and your money will still earn while invested. You won't see the same  200% or whatever from when you bought in, but if you buy back in for a similar price as you sold, its the same thing

That Nio pre-earnings dump at 3:30pm was of epic proportions... I for one prefer a pre earnings dump than a post earnings dump

Bought NIO 31p 12/18 at the top, just gotta hold for a few weeks til the volume drops or earnings bust

Holy fuck man, let’s see what happen next. I’ve got 16.5k riding in NIO puts I sold to 🌈🐻
4PM PST
My play is indirect NIO play. NIO went up too much so even if they beat,it might fall. But if NIO reports strong numbers and upside guidance, there will be halo effect on LI and XPEV. So $55k into LI and XPEV shares.

thats your good ol Uncle Jay, coming in your room after a late night of heavy drinking, bud.
Bought AMZN last night. Saw the 77 point gain pre market. “I’m going to let that call ride”. Log in just now.  Cry. Take your gains. Always take your gains.
You’ll get the cheapest prices at the end of the day usually

NIO bears prepare your anuses tommorow, I’m not going to incriminate myself but I already know how ER is going to go for NIO, it’s going to moon. You lose this one sorry bears
I’d love to get in on NIO, but that IV guarantees i make no money lmao

You can argue with her.
All we do is pump? Just buy calls dude
Just wanted to say fuck RKT
Yup that was a definite turning point. You used to be able to find great plays. Now it’s just 300 pots a day screaming “NIO to the moon”, “OMG what happened to my NIO calls”
Leave this sub at once!
NIO TO 25 TOMORROW
Time for another leg down, spy 355 @ open
Cause they bought at the top
honestly cant wait for all the screeching that's about to happen on NIO after hours
Rh is definitely crashing on open tomorrow
Take a picture now, you won’t be seeing NIO under 50 after today
Just getting started.
RIDE CEO on Cramer tn will get Cramer pump tomorrow
Yes for a small period
ALL IN NIO!
M surging at close
Last warning: always inverse wsb
WSB needs a NIO prayer circle thread
Not that high considering it will be at $400+ eom
switch immediately the VIX on
What's your strike price? I'm holding 200 shares but really thinking about getting calls for March at 19
BUY BABA calls right now before close for december I’m telling you pleaseeee free money
Closing today with calls on HIMX FANG and HYLN, hoping for a good return
This is your last chance to exit NIO
RKT never disappoints in being a disappointment
Bears Bulls or Theta no one knows yet
Fucking same.  What has happened to us degenerates.  Ima die young of a heart attack from tendies or stressies
Close the market already... Goddammit!
RIP
does nvda report after or pre tomorrow?
Spin off
I have several stocks that I may add positions too but for the moment I'm leaving all as is since I have no money or job lmao. I'd like to add more to my current positions aswell
Their daily thread only has 370 comments. Probably like 15 people
Is that the ticker or the verb
Fuck JB.

And your name is fearless trader huh?
I want it to go up because I will make money.
[deleted]

People who miss it now will legit be the ones crying tomorrow morning
Nah I'm off to play tetris
Ride it to the moon
i think NIO retard money is gonna pour in tomorrow
It could.  It could also go up.  Even sideways
Can always bank on a pump in the final 5-10 minutes
A Chinese fortune cookie mate
Drinks on me!!
I mean if you didn’t sell at 49 earlier you decided right then you were holding. Diamond hands 💎💎💎
Agro futures are my new favorite.  Low margin and they move fast.  There's also mini futures that only need 400 in margin to hold
6. Stock price never goes higher than your purchase price
I don't understand why people wouldn't just buy stocks to avoid this
Best comment of the day lmao
😂
PLTR 19 tomorrow. GET INNN
This comment for the past 6 months...
Chewy opens at 68 tomorrow
Spy blow off top commenced a close above 361 indicates 368 open for me
Are we done with tesla?
Day traders closing their PLTR positions. This is your chance, babydick.
This market wants to die... Godspeed holders

So many NIO dios bout to get their grio down
PLTR train about to take off babyyy 😤
I can’t buy the dip until i sell the shares I bought at $53
Lol yes
NIO will eventually sell as many cars as TSLA if not more, and it’s worth 1/8 of TSLA. It’s definitely overvalued now but in the future it will not be, and theres no guarantee of a correction.
Hold!  Tendies are a-coming!
Y’all r fuk
long dated NIO puts are the way
Lmao I can't believe this sub is free

I hope this stock isn’t Orville REDenbocker AH

I don't know if you have an background in immunology or physiology or you just read some stuff on the internet about it and then tried to oversimplify things, but this is not how immunology works. As stated by others already here. 

Yes, there will be risks with the vaccine, but there won't be HIV-COVID in the near future. You have to understand that the family of corona viruses is not novel and we have been exposed to millions of strains of corona virus spike proteins already. If the immune systems is as feeble as you describe it and oversimplify it to be, there will have already been millions of strains of HIV-influenza, HIV-coronavirus, HIV-SARS virus, HIV-Spanish Flu, etc. On an unrelated note, HIV is not that feeble either. You don't give it enough credit. It doesn't simply let another virus come in and trick it to make their proteins. 

And your whole autoimmune argument is not novel either. It already happens. There's even a syndrome named for it. The fact that you didn't cite it, makes me think you definitely don't know what you are talking about. But anyways, it can happen after regular viral infections and sometimes even the flu vaccine. Don't worry, it's treatable.

There will be risks to any vaccine, but usually the benefit far outweighs the risk. Sure, don't get the mRNA vaccine. Get COVID instead while you wait for the inactivated virus (if it even comes out), since it's the most traditional way to build immunity, but don't spread misinformation when you aren't totally sure of the facts. Instead, ask questions.
I got 400 shares been investing in them since feb. A pullback after this week should happen. He asked by eod so if we have a red day with puts as xheap.as they are now, some down 60% in value, yea it could fit
Same. Cheers!
You done did messed up
Got 345p Friday at 358 and sold today at 358 for -75% , if they do then f
NIO? sell
The messed up part about this is that in LOTR, the palantiri usually mislead their users based on what they selectively show.
BA going to take me to TENDIE TOWN tomorrow!
Is my 11/20 C HD dead?
I am too stupid just tell me the date so i buy dip me no financialz wizzz
Bought mine yesterday, swore I wouldn’t buy more, I’ve never bought a stock I know less about than PLTR. What’s your plan?
But NIO will 🍷
Will NIO money flow into PLTR 🤤
Good for you
I don't know why everyone is freaking out, NIO is still up +2% for the day
only dumps are gay duhhh
Will Robinhood let you sell shares after hours ?
Sell or hold DraftKings call 48 11/20? Afraid it might drop down again but idk
Is BA going to be a sell the news situation?
At this stage I’m not sure what I find funnier the fact that people are suprised this happened or the fact that people still expect it to pump AH
News announcement of FVAC coming?  Its going vertical.
?
6 minutes to close. Make your retarded plays now

I want NIO to go up tomorrow, because i love seeing how angry some people get about it
The last candle on SPY is always so organic
this has been the longest hour of my life so far
Just watched this today
Yall ready for the fuckery??

Whichever this shit goes, i love yall

With that said, NIO bulls get your unicorns ready to fly to Valhalla😁
If Buffet thinks they’re good then it’s good enough for me. 4% dividend yield looks spicy.
It will go up or go down after earnings. That one is certain. No one knows. Im keeping my calls
Hold or sell?? HOLD OR SELL?!?!?!?!?!
Let it be known IV will rape me tonight and I'm letting it happen.
There's no way NIO meets the earnings hype this time right?

...right?
Thanks man, I keep telling myself I wouldn't sell, this is a company I've worked with for a project and I truly believe they have a future and can potentially triple or quadruple in a year or two. If it does dip back to 17.50, I'm gonna delete the app and never look back. Otherwise, I'll find another company worth investing and regret for life tho.
I grabbed some jan 300 calls for the hell of it.
A software company with gov contracts is definitely the same as a mattress company.
!remindme 18 hours
Commenting for later
let the NIO 🐻 bag holding commence
Yeah that’s why I don’t post in WSB I just observe the retards in the natural habitat.
NIO cannot move like TSLA. should have bought TSLA instead.
60 eow, 80 eom, 100 eoy
Wtf is with this SHREK DiCK
BABA's been dipping for a week babe
Those holding NIO through earnings have not learned a single thing about IV even after so many experiences 😒😒😒
[removed]
Last NIO run up was the cliff
What if you have both?
I feel like history will be made tonight with NIO earnings...WSB will have the most gain porn posts in its existence tomorrow
Right. Sell before crash. Buy back in the next day or 2 after.

BA needs to dump
unreal dildo jesus
I find it funny that us Americans are allowed to invest in a Chinese company like NIO through ADRs... what's the point of even having national borders anymore(seriously). Globalization is here.
TSLA gap up tonight plz

So it can moon one day when everyone loses interest.

Happy cake day
Last call to get in on nio fun!
Boys, I found my new financial advisor. You’re hired.

Positions?
NIO yes PLTR no
Buy buy buy
Even if the vaccine is only effective for a few months, it will greatly reduce the number who get sick and build up heard immunity as production scales up and a longer lasting one can be brought to market.
That's why I thought it was WSB worthy. Arent we autists around here?
NIO to 100😈
CARR $41C is a good lotto FD play and long term will crush it.
lol i'm surprised you're the only one who's said anything to her
PLTR way cheaper than SNOW
You have the ability to buy back you know. So what you missed a few bucks, theme the breaks but if you think it will keep running, buy it again
Just called her back it was a buttdial
Ready for that eod pump
I've got some 11/20 $16p in my pocket. Expecting some gains
Well here’s a quick one- the Oxford vaccine is utilizing a chimpanzee adenovirus (thus the name ChAdOx-1) to circumvent the possibility of preexisting immunity to the viral vector. Humans have been found to have antibodies to some adenoviruses from other primates in rare cases, but this would not be an issue for the specific vector chosen. 

You’re obviously not a dumb guy and you have valid questions, but I’d be hesitant to offer financial advice unless you’re really an expert in a subject... not that this is the norm in WSB. That said, I might still pick up some NVAX shares as I think you’re correct that there are some advantages to this vaccine, and there’s a necessity for multiple vaccines to be mass produced and widely distributed.
I feel like the only one riding on DIS lol
Had some extra cash so I bought some NIO calls. Sitting here with popcorn waiting to see if my gf’s boyfriend fucks me tomorrow morning.
Trading is the only thing making me happy, but it also makes me miserable
Let’s fucking GO
This is the way
[deleted]
These wtf bio posts are killing me right now

Y'all realize TSLA was added to the s&p500 right? Not nio. There is no reason for a large rose in nio today and y'all should be happy with 2% for literally no reason...
IV for 11/20 $165 C is currently \~82% homie
Mark my words - NIO puts for earnings are lottery tickets 😏😏🥳
NIO is the prodigal son
So dumb that they killed PLUG in AH lol
i've made my decision. I'M HOLDING
You mean it?  Tendies for the boys?!
Up 14k today on 4x TSLA 410c 7/21 and 1x AMZN 3100c 1/15. If ya don’t brag about it , it didn’t happen

I think so
i just fucking cackled
Terrance and Phillip approved!
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
10 min left...is it stupid to buy some weekly calls on NIO or PLTR?
Let’s GO
landscape mode = infinite gains
You guys think I’m an idiot I get the concept I wrote out .. I asked one fucking question to confirm for me. What a bunch of dickheads in this fucking group. Thanks to anyone actually trying to explain something
Buuuy
Spy finishes above 361
Sounds good to me
EV's are like weed stocks from a year ago.
you fucking weak, you are gonna miss 100 baggers,

get back on it, get calls now, you still have chance
It’s actually a fun community to fuck around in , just potentially very expensive to meme
solo is a scooter in a box
Inverse WSB. Buy NIO. Blue sky coming tonight
Buying the BABA dip
Dude you have profits...go talk to the people on here who lost like 75k. Relax
So dont specialize in machine learning.
lol spy to 365 I guess
Won't be long before RIOT RIDE and PLTR are on the most active charts and thats when FOMO really kicks in.
I’m not gonna detail it but it should gradually increase in price throughout the night and morning until open
Cvoid fears increasing

Oof... Maybe she just didn't get it?
Finally the pump comes was honestly worried for a second
I love how NIO bulls can give logical reasons as to why the stock is going to take off but bears can’t say anything except “die nio” that just goes to show why bears R fuk
u nerds drink that monster drink shit?
lmao unreal defense of 360 holy shit
NIONIONIONIONIONIO
Interesting, if SOROS is selling everything he must see a problem coming
if you couldn't afford a ps5 before making profit from your investment, then I'd advise you to hold it for something more important
SPX 3605 is fuckin fort knox, very well defended. Every time bears touch it we see the quickest and gayest of algo pumps.
Got 20 Boeing puts and 10 spy puts. Idk why but something is wrong in the force, I can feel it
3 wheels won’t sell
it's gone

fuck yea we fuckin do
Poll: spy 340p 11/20 print?
Why are you obsessed with keeping your avg price low?  If you buy a stock at $20 and it goes to $25 you made $5 regardless of what your avg price was/is.
450 at just under 11. Will add more to make it 500. Will also buy a few leaps when the IV drops a bit

EOD pump brought to you buy Geico car insurance in partnership with NIO
How many people in hear have been saying to pump and then dump right before close?  I think that's what you saw.  Buy more if it drops further!
Strange there has been no NIO ER leaks
Why?
Big red tomorrow, book em Danno
Their balance sheet doesn't look great...
At this point I feel like if I sell we moon and if I hold we tank
Jesus you put all your money into one sector of commerce. Good luck when that 100% turns into -50%

Pick a meme stonk, and flip a coin on calls or puts
Someone mentioned it last week
RUN
Mmm it’s a great sign in my opinion we will see in the coming weeks
Seems like everything dumped at that time

Not last night, but the night before, I dreamed everything crashed and I put my obligations on hold so I could spend all my time here mocking bulls' suffering.

First one. I just rewatched LOTR last week and thought I would enjoy the hobbit while riding the hype. Nope.
Tesla calls looks to be the move.  Once nio disappoints everyone. Smart money gonna go into Tesla.
Let’s get this!
That is more risky than options...
My 100k position couldn't swing from 10k profit to 1k? Ok buddy
I made enough to buy a PS5 today, if I can find one. Ugh.

Hatch lol
Right on...NIO means “blue sky coming”
NIO to 60! 

Let’s GOOOOOOO!!!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
AMD 83$c 24/12?
Daily Mentality:
1. Fuck. Stock price is too high
2. Price drops, I’ll wait for a cheaper entry price
3. Next day, stock price goes higher than the original high
[deleted]
Looking at price action today this thing has more room to run. I think $20 is psychological resistance. Today it was 18.70

If Mms dont manipulate the shit out of it and if we break 18.7 tomorrow, we hit 20 eow. Then consolidate
1/15 230c
Very nice to see you made money. What are you next picks?
Forget it, it's not a thing

I can’t believe you guys are holding through what is an inevitable IV crush scenario. God speed brothers
Got damn, this is making my heart explode

PLTR closing >$18 is super bullish imo but then again I also don't know what I'm talking about
pltr faster growth though, hence the premium
Wtf is this investing, hold that shit that’s what I’m doing
Nobody is using absolute risk reduction because we are using other risk reduction methods and only have a weeks worth of data. This creates a strong bias ARR for this trial. 

If we didn’t social distance and everyone was coughed on by some WSB “Analytical Pharmacist” with COVID-19, it is probable that 90% will not become sick based on this trial AS WELL AS the previous experiments and trials using humans, human cells, and animals experiments.

I think the bigger issue that you just barely touched on was storage. It is going to be a disaster, and if another company makes one that doesnt require as extreme storage conditions, even with lower efficacy, you can bet the states will buy that one.
Oh boy that would bring so much loss porn
What kind of dumb fucks are instantly buying up SPY at these prices? My god
NIO 💎🤲 activated.....🚀🚀
lzb is gonna tank right?
I'm green rn please ring the bell before these 21 bps slip away
Fucking annoying bro- this shit better go up tomorrow
What the fuck does this mean 😂
I was told there would be no math on this test.

EOD plays?
Chicken please 😋
I learnt the hard way. Sell when you’re up don’t risk it for the biscuit
Tyty
ive been singing my song to pltr for a few minutes now, trying to get it up, ill keep trying
Correction: ‘gay dog’
the dumb money guys are featured on a NIO article on Robinhood lolol
I sold my 2 pltr calls and made like 16 or 10 bucks idk and idk how to check, wish I’d sold for. 100 profit instead
Fomo
Sounds like me last Friday. I hit 10k and didn't sell, ended the day at 6k. Lowest point of the day was 4.5k. Just an insane swing.

Still trying to claw my way back up from that shit.
Lmao I’m an autist what do u expect. But thanks actually at least I’ll know why I’m losing money tmrw
Calls works 9 times out of 10 so I’ll stick with calls
Black pepper chicken in PE
Yes
What THE FUCK happened to Nio while I was in my meeting

Who did this
Picked up puts for tonight, if they print, then I'm adding to my 3/21c $400 position with them tendies and BTFD.
wday calls anyone?
Well just bought NIO 46c 11/27
thanks for the reassurance, just bought 20 $300 calls for Dec
[removed]
Im long pltr and have calls but i think at some point it may come back to realistic numbers and settle around 13.40-14 for a couple weeks i just dont think that happens before Jan 15th. Good luck friend. Im in leaps anyway so doesnt change my position at all.
boeing puts?  They're just now getting to their recovery.  I'd avoid this unless you're doing it very short term.

Position: 250 shares @ 150cps
Hurry boys!
Just loaded up on 20 Boeing puts. Wish me luck
SPY IS WILDING THE FUCK OUTTTTTT
Both will be butt hurt if it stays flat. IV is the villain in the every ones story tomorrow.

MMs buying up cheap calls
SPCE March bakkk 2 42 starts meow 😘
^(Call credit spreads)

CCL needs to dump. Like it went up so much like it doesn’t have like 20 bil in debt with a vaccine that’s not 100% available until next year
Cringe
What a boring close lets make the last 5 minutes interesting
Shares? What are shares?
This market is retarded lmao

Holding through my Chinese EV calls cause I'm also retarded
That’s not even possible it couldn’t have gone from 9k to 1k value lmao 🌈 🐻
You are stupid if you thought it wouldn't drop due to profit taking ...
I'm gonna regret for life. I sold all my shares on the Soros news and it didn't went down thereafter... I'm out of PLTR forever if it doesn't drop back to 17.5. Even though i got profits, I still feel like crap and I can't forgive myself today or ever.
Nice red candles!
Yo look at my homie with the brain!
Just checked the index and the sell-off started before earnings
11/20 puts aha
Easy
Beef or chicken ramen?
I think it’s a good choice but why not put it in a few places so if it does fuck up, your eggs are not in one basket. I’ve mine in 12 baskets, but larger amounts in the ones I think will make money - PLTR, PLUG, XPEV and NIO, and a little less in AMD.
Then I put the rest, all small amounts in companies that went down in March and haven’t bounced back yet, I’m willing to sit on them until they recover. 
I don’t have any in the red (id one and I sold it for a mover). I’ve been very very lucky. I feel like this is a little too easy.
bunch of retards. I paid $46 :)
jpow aint letting this get below the open price
This guy gets it
listen bois: NIO has no sky limit

we know it will moon tomorrow, The dip is a bear trap
355P 11/18
Justtt fucking with you
360 too strong holy shit
Can we get some Fs in the chat for people who bought nio at 49
I think it’s a great growth stock. They’re not issuing new shares to raise funds, they’re using their cash to expand production and facilities, although I wish more cash was being used towards R&D. They have tons of room to develop sales channels, partnerships and wholesale opportunities across NA. $BYND is overpriced in my opinion. These guys are just scratching the surface!
FWIW I did have a bit left and finally successfully entered into a spread. I didn't leg into one though and that's what I wasn't sure was doable, so will have to try that for my next trick. But as I mentioned, most of account is tied into TSLA, and unfortunately so. I knew there'd be EOD selloff, ugh.

Why would it collapse??
spy calls or puts is the million dollar question
Wtf is this new CNBC music, AC/DC electric guitar solo, while showing the Dow intra-day chart
Ok guys don't panic. This is the plan: We buy Robinhood calls ON Robinhood. The call will simultaneously drive up the price. I think we've found an infinite money making loop.
What expiration?
What Chinese product is worse for America NIO or COVID?

This won't age well.

Nio falling? More pussies about than I expected
Same question
What happened to it?
Bruh those stocks are all in the same industry basically. Risky, I like it.
Yeah I feel bad for those put holders
PLTR looks too expensive? Look at AYX, and PLTR > AYX.
your comments give me aids
How are the indexes so red with everything else being up atleast 2%?
I swore I would never put my dick in crazy, but buying DKNG calls now anyways
Most of my PLTR calls expire January, im holding onto these for dear life
So I bought NIO calls at an all time high Friday. Managed to flip puts and calls this week to get back to even. Riding profits into earnings but I'm calling this a W because I could've blown up my account buying high
Should I hold my sq calls or use a day trade on them.
Do I hold or sell my NIO call?

Upvote to hold. 
Downvote to sell.
Thoughts on buying a put for TSLA to hedge any AH sell off?

What Was there a fucking insider in your bathroom?
Keep the doomscrolling to /r/Coronavirus

Finally a worthy stock to yolo on with pride
My first buy in the market was NIO

I was able to buy a 400k house in NM 

All thanks to WSB
Well that’s my portfolio so I could just show that I guess
Dumbasses... if NIO closed at $50 the stock would collapse no matter what... the fact that it went back to $46 and is stabilizing here is a good thing for earnings to show a nice increase after hours
Let's go!
I need your guidance oh great scalep
There better not be another obnoxious pump EOD.
China is probably going to cook NIOs books lol
BABA due for a turnaround this week, right? Fuel my confirmation bias.
Calls or Puts on NIO??

Can’t wait to see PLTR become PRPL 2.0 📉
Why?
AHOOOOOGAAA 🌈🐻🌈🐻🌈🐻
me 100 baggers tomorrow

get it now and get rich
NP.. If you really want to learn something study up on Calendar Spreads.

For instance. Sell AMD 12/18 90c. Buy AMD 1/15/21 90c.
The short option decays faster than the long so even if the stock trades flat into or slightly down up into December you still make a profit.
Idk why anyone’s fucking with Nio rn with that IV
sure hope so, bought more calls on the dip...
It goes with his [birth certificate](https://media.vlipsy.com/vlips/AUvLvT93/preview.jpg)
I literally have no more money
good gain then bro
IV is irrelevant with NIO...11/20 60c gonna print

I'll look for your next post in red.
Why do you say that?
Yeah if you wanna make money
I figured to be around 25% so we are aligned.
This isn't even a stock market question, this is a basic math question wow

PLTR WILL MOON AH AND AT OPEN AFTER YOUTUBERS MAKE VIDEOS SHILLING IT 🤑🤑
Buying a call or put by itself. Literally all that WSB does, and you are paying bigly for volatility. If you do some sort of a spread you can mitigate your risk and raise your chances of actually making a profit
Yea you know me... who down with OPTT?
When do they expire
Holy shit PLTR is gonna pump after hours
WMT fuck off
Any bets on Joke-ma?
you mean r.i.p right ?
Yikes. Yes.... if you buy shares at a higher price, your average share price will be higher..... and no.... you will have more shares, meaning you make more or lose more depending on which direction it moves...... Spend some time learning on YouTube or something lol
What you want to do is sell everything so your average cost per share is zero.
Bought PLTR 18p, it will moon another 20% tomorrow
Go learn how to use Reddit first
Go down BA
Yeahhh lol I thought you got this week exp and I wasn’t gonna say it but I was thinking “RIP this guy’s account” next week exp should be okay lol
Unsinkable
I lost out pretty bad on option calls when I started about a year ago, sort of rebuilding my portfolio atm
✋ 20 Nov 20 calls here on TGT
Embarassinly I held $25k shares from IPO at $10.5

Held those all the way down to $8 and jumped out at break even so I could put some more weight into AMD and DKNG and CRSR which was solid but I just wish I had more capital LOL

I am cool holding for the long run, I am just waiting to see if we reject $18 before close because I would prefer to just open 1000 shares soon and 1000 at a later date
Why is everyone so confident on this? I'm up 80% wondering if I should sell it
Trumps been wanting to start a war before he leaves (re: axios Trump and Iran)

Can someone smarter than me explain what happened to pfizer calls today after the merger? I now have PFE1 calls for 100 shares of PFE and 12 shares of VTRS, how can other people even buy these? Or is my only real way to profit on them in the event they hit to exercise it myself?
That wasn’t a crash homie that’s called day traders and paper hands. I’m right about stocks 96% of the time so there’s a good chance you’re wrong
Looks good to me. After about 8 different stocks diversification is actually dilution anyway.
WTF is happening to gold?
This mfer made probably 100%+ on this investment alone and says he regrets it? He’s trying to bring it down to add more for cheaper..🤡

lzb is gonna tank right?
lines at 46....its not breaking that.  if it does its a free for all
This sub has proven that you can be disabled and still make money
42 would b v nice
Yeah that games really cool, what’s your user ID, I’ll play with you!
You’ll still get whatever profit there is if the stock were to rise. If your avg price per share goes high than the percentage %^ will be smaller just due to the fact that you got in higher. Remember it’s averaging your cost not just shadowing the highest you bought in at- does this make sense?
If anything, at least to show idiots to put the info in the main fucking post.

Good job op.
For these people who get fat gains, I wonder how many people actually stay in the green.

OK. You sold me. Bought 1 as a lotto. It will either go to $0 or +100%, lol.
It always was.
> Does SIPC protect me if my account is hacked and cash and/or securities are stolen?

> SIPC’s role and responsibilities are as defined under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA). Under that law, SIPC protection is available only to customers of a member broker-dealer that is in liquidation under SIPA or is the subject of a direct payment procedure. If you discover that your account has been hacked and your securities or cash have been stolen, you should contact your brokerage firm, the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (www.finra.org), your state securities regulator, or other appropriate law enforcement authorities. Whether you would be protected if your account was hacked would depend upon the circumstances under which your account was gained access to, and other factors being present that justify the liquidation of the brokerage firm.

Looks like this may not apply to my situation. Sounds like it is a question of what it means when a firm is "liquidated".
Wrong place to ask.  Now take your metro fetus back into the womb.
Let’s get it NIO....most anticipated earnings report in WSB history
why did no one tell us about RIOT
I sold about $250 worth, holding the other half
Looked to my NIO as it was +9k and blinked. $10k! Yes!.....wait thats missing a zero. $1k and falling.
Sell calls naked, not covered.

BABA PLZZZZZ!!!!!
Hump hump hump hump
Earnings
#🛬🐻’s get fucked
Absolutely no doubt
I think I may have a problem. I told my wife to go out with her boyfriend and I had something on the TV to watch. The truth was I will be waiting for NIO ER and watching this sub, and I dont even have any skin in the game 😂
Someone pulled the plug

Can’t wait to see nio crash
Ban
Got 500 hundred shares and adding.
It was a popular Dr Burry investment, thought he was a god here due to GME
I told some random Mexican to buy NIO, he was like "Dios nio, pendejo."
NIO really just teased all of us
Is no one playing TGT earnings? Or did I mispell NIO? Fuck
Can you share that? I need something to dull the pain.
12/11 21.5c
Why can’t I buy options on PFE??
Wrong sub bud, wrong sub 🤦🏻‍♂️
We're getting crushed. We need this baby to moon
And on the way back to their pre-covid levels over the next 9 months.  If you buy puts better make it short term plays.
I’ve got about 60 leaps between 125 and 150
ehhhhhhhh thats fair.  Yolo because the wife will have my balls if I fuck around.
I’ll happily advise them on how to lose all of our money, good at that
[deleted]
Yes
Me too ):)
Who knew being a soy boy pays off , other than the D n c
Been holding since yesterday
I need NIO to stay between 42 and 52. I think this thing might go lower especially if they announce dilution.
“Pfizer may be within days of filing emergency authorization request for Covid-19 vaccine”

Didn't believe we were getting a federal shutdown. Just checked the news. Gawddamn.
Buy the dip

we are to the moon
Tsla baghold gang
This is the smartest comment I’ve seen today. You’re exactly right brother
that's why it made money in exactly 40 minutes
Hands weak, bags are heavy.
NIO is just consolidating for the big rip AH
Unusual options are heavily favoring the stock to rocket. There's a single $10+ mil bet on it.
Exactly
lol didnt even know spy red... with everything else so green
Amazon going into the Pharmacy biz, supposedly going to take all of Walmart's pharmacy biz, just like buying Whole Paycheck was going to ruin their grocery biz. Of course, one didn't happen, at all, and the other one will not happen, but someone needs a pump.
Got SPY 364 calls expiring tomorrow...pump pump pump pump
I have 13$ in buying power all in on PLTR I need a FD for .01 weekly

I hope so.
600 EOW you think so ?
Do I sell my TSLA puts at EOD or at market open
Even more stellar than this earnings run up? It isn't going up in the short term anymore unless they have some insane surprise that wasn't priced in.
yup. my ass hurts.
Because paper hands
Beware WSB DD only produces 200% gains plays
glad i checked it out last month! fuck Vail.  Breckenridge is better
Lmfao
Tsla 500 eow
Doing my part as an american, bought a few nio put spreads for fun
What the fuck
Yesterday I posted this:

> TSLA 460c 11/20 were only 50 cents today at an IV of 66%, which is super low by TSLA standards. I wonder how much I would have made if I had went all in before EOD. These are the thoughts that keep me awake at night.

Those calls are now worth $ 4.05 and it isn't even ITM.
Dude they own part of an ecommerce company where I'm from and it's pennies in term of total revenue but the fact they were willing to invest there told me they knew what they were doing. BABA will be something I'll always hold.
I had a dream it hit $60; I’m either Kassandra or the dumbest bitch to ever live
Ty brother
That's a name I haven't heard in ages
Your joking right? Earnings after hours
Look at this NIO graph

Every time it makes me laugh

Look how high it was back then

And what the hell happened to my spread?
Do you finger ur gf with those paper hands?
They don’t even have horizontal display lmao
You can feel the tension in the air before earnings on a memestock that may just wipe out half the sub. Oh dear god.
Shitcoin went parabolic again today
7:00
Ptllllrrrrr
They are already contracted
Hey algos everyone here wants spy puts
Bears seem to not understand this fact. This is why bears lose ten times more than bulls
fym flushes?
PLTR can go even higher right?

No and then!
Honestly, no, but I've got a few calls I've been holding on to that hope so.
BYND creeping back up

Smart girl
how much is the potential upside on long term calls like these in comparison to owning the stock itself?
That stupid joke-ma made jokes on China banks Other wise it would have tested $350.
Now CCP is showing who is the daddy.
Up about 550% since I made this comment lmao
This is a great time to buy Boeing puts. They up almost $13
jesus bold :), i may pick some nio up below 25s tbh
Literally moved $1
Yo momma about to crash through
I went long soy futures at the bottom in october.  The initial margin is only 2k.  I made 500 off the run and sold.  If I had held I could be up almost 10k rn
UAL puts, ZM calls, wide NIO iron condors lets play
Because it pumped up more than it should have?
$XPEV 50 call yolo off NIO earnings? They love to love together
Don’t buy ba calls if you don’t want money

Only if he wants to exercise. Purchasing just one put tells me he doesn’t want to
“No” as in “should I sell NIO?” “No!”
Bears can get IV crushed too
Guess measily is based off perspective. Sorry for the loss goodluck on future trades.
Right here bb. Bought some fresh 47p when it was at 48.5. Lets ride this roller coaster.
I am praying it flushes hard before close, just waiting and praying....
6 minutes away from watching EVs drill to actual China.
Go fuck yourself retard, youre the dumbest fgt I have seen on this subreddit.
Nio dip wasnt the huge sell off everyone expected. Likely gonna kill it after earnings
Calls on MUSK
Oh you imagine buying weeklys? Oof
This is very much especially after hours today gonna moon
Need tsla and solo
no ps5s
[deleted]
Any reason?
depends. shares? i feel like anything under 20 is a fantastic buy, it’ll be a great long term hold. calls? it’s had a good run up, i’d say wait for more of a pullback

I sold 18 of my 20 Shell calls for breakeven that are now at 400% the week before Pfizer’s vaccine news. RIP

Still using Windows 98.
Yeah same. I just sold my puts though and switched to calls so I hope you’re wrong lol
When they come for me ive already got a plan:

hike through the fucking desert with some of my shit hit the fan cash and (water i got stashed all over down there, as long as i stay off access trails im good, who cares if the drones see me im heading south anyway) 

once i hit Mexico hire a cab to take me Monterrey, purchase motorcycle and try to work my way to Venezuela 

then id just live off remittances i guess
fuck you FSR...so close to breaking 17 and you just couldn't do it...how about tomorrow then?
STFU
LAST CHANCE TO GET ON PLTR BELOW $20
Where TSLA
I'm with you! Regardless of whatever "good" outcome, tomorrow in the pm will see some carnage!
oh wow, i know what my move would be...but not really cuz i would not have it in me to buy that at 407.....good luck
440 is an over 400% annualized profit if you held them for a week, 8% for the week - sheesh whats not to like

End of day pump. We close green. Continue moon mission tomorrow. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Lol can’t wait to see you crying and downvoting everyone tommorow. NIO leads xpeng in sales drastically you’re a fool if you think it’s not going to moon. It’ll never go under the 40s again
... going up 60% in 2 days... okay I can easily cover with shares lol
If nobody sells nio it can’t go down?
Hate myself for not selling yesterday
So is there anything I could get eod that’ll leave me waking with with a +1000% portfolio in the morning?
Is Facebook dead?
What's up w BLNK, only came on my radar yesterday?
How is nio earnings not priced in?
Fuck I’m waiting for another red day to double my position but we might never see PLTR below 18 again
35P/60C
Calls printed today!
This is the weakest "red day" ever.   Not even 0.75%
So true
After hours gonna moon
PLTR is really flirting with 18 lmfao
SPY PUTS!!!!
100 years not consistent enough?
Sell the news tomorrow
Ahh I see, interesting.
Wanna trade usernames? I think I outgrew this one in March.
Fuck no, if you do go into tech go into sales. Those guys are literally retards and get all the glory while the actual tech's try to salvage an impossibly quoted project without putting in too much after hours work and getting a sandpaper dildo from clients for not meeting ridiculous expectations and making house calls because their 2mbps internet can't handle a fucking teams call while on VPN and having quickbooks open.
I fully expect some Chinese accounting fuckery. Pull what Li Auto did and not be negative EPS.
Gonna be flat now n disappoint us all
Why is the market so kang gang
Shoot me a message then bro
K but does anyone know WHY Nio dipped?
We heard you the first time fgt
Yeah if you wanna lose money
Still, welcome home lol
Next dip get calls on RIOT. You will see tendy land again
?
I might have bought dec 18th 175 puts sooo imma exit once theres pullback lol😂
Lol hi
its better to have had and lost, then never have had at all.
Seriously? Two vaccines have come out with over 90% efficiency. It allows cruise liners to be more confident with 2021. Obviously, no one is going to get on now, which investors all know...

Pltr to 18
Can’t see shit from this screenshot
I'm only two dollars away from my cost basis for DKNG. *Happy dance...* 🕺
This NIO dip is making me more confident to hold thru tonight. If it was soaring I’d be stressing to sell
Impossible to make solid gains with how bipolar this market is. Feel bad for folks with pdt
I bought leaps in AAPL, contracts were and are cheap AF. Great company to hold for a year and turn off the monitor.
Matthew McConaughey?
3 day wait is usual recommendation, believe there is a short cap on individual stocks once it hits 20%. Could be wrong though, that's just parroted.
prob a good spot to buy 362 calls?
🤡🤡🤡
Hmmm
Riot is the new Aerotyne
I got the Robinhood gold so I could up my instant deposit limit. I’m also slight stupid, does anyone know how to read the level 2 market data they give you
Are there any NIO bears left? 🐻
Everyone thought I was retarded when I sold my house to buy 5500 shares of NIO at $21 now I can buy two houses if I want 😜
Good choice.
Have 11/20 68 c wanted the 11/27 68 c but I fucked up.
Tl;dr: if you’re holding NIO, you’re unique 🥳
I would totally give you gold, but spent my last dollar on NIO stock.
Today at 4pm tune in to see the final chapter of the NIO saga! Will the bears be in Lambos? Will the bulls that ignore IV be rewarded? Tune in after close!
That Nio rug was beautiful.
15 mins left! Get the fuck on the PLTR @ 20 EOW Train. Choo choo.
word? got it thanks thanks
Tim Apple is so gay lately
If that happens ... idk what I would do bro 

It can’t end like that 

No way bro 

No way man the noobs cannot win
Okay you win
Yall dumbass bears realize IV will crush ur puts after earnings. Calls are a better purchase than puts for NIO since support seems to be at 40$, and as long as they sell a sexy future, NIO will hit 600$ eow
Can't wait for the Soros dump
Puts on Vail Resorts because they fckn suck and are ruining the ski industry
Anyone else buying nioputs🦄 ?
I see a 66% dip see it’s. Good company and they are going to be retrying the testing and approval later. I buy. If testing doesn’t pass market already priced the fail so it’s not gonna dip more. If testing passes, I’m in profit. Simple logic little bit of analysis little bit of reading the rationale for the dip.
Why TSLA mooning?
if you dont think xi isn't gona pump nio you aint chinese
ah Mr. Phd over here, haha thanks for the tip bro didn’t even think of that
Ryan just bought a $24m house in Bal Harbour. 

LIVING
From experience. Market is shit right now and there is tons of fucking calls on NIO. No matter how ER is the market it will make NIO go down to kill all those calls.
Wow you all hate PRPL this much? No mention of 🚀today. Meanwhile all my P stocks are killing it. Prpl pltr ptsh it almost makes me want to buy pypl.
It’s gonna be the longest 2 hour wait.
Depends on expiry? If Ong dated fine to hold, if it's weeklies def should've sold. IV crush might be pretty nasty.
People are really acting like PFE is going to go bankrupt or something. Thanks for the cheap shares dummies.
is NIO gonna bring down the whole EV sector? hmmm. all EV spacs have been red hot
god i hope so

Just did. Please explain how this fucks me over. Isn't there going to be one last spike upward b/c of the earnings call then it's going to spike downward and then afterwards stay low and level?
Just loaded up on KSS puts.
It's the vaporub company, you know? Vix vaporub obviously
That’s why baba is very undervalued
Care to give a hint at least what you're looking at when running algo?

Iv crush is definitely one of the rites of passage
cant wait for NIO to shoot up to the sky AH.
[removed]
Thanks ill keep that in mind lol
PLTR LAST CHANCE UNDER 20 BEFORE OPEN TOMMOROW 🚀
Sold.. it was my only one in the red and it was annoying me.. I didn’t have much I just put in 30 hoping it could 10 fold one day. But realised it would be better in PLTR even if it’s only 30 quid
[removed]
Rotation from fuk into fuk
Nah.
Go with your gut
Don’t worry guys !!!1!1!1! MM’s drilling the stock so they can get in for a better price !!!1!1!1!1 buy the dip!!!1!1!1!1 biggest pension fund in USA has holdings 1!1!1!1!1!

At this stage I’m not sure what I find funnier the fact that nobody say this coming or the fact people still think it’s gonna pump at ER

Love them Greeks!
I could see it being PayPal too

I don't know why, but I like this retard... Calls on NIO!
5-year chart looks like a table saw blade lol
Market cap 7 million? You fucking pump and dumper.   


Reported and hope you are permanently banned. JFC.
Would you mind showing us a screen cap of positions?  If it's on Robinhood would you mind slowly scrolling through the ups and downs of your trades.  The less ups the better.  I would like to masturbate today but have had a difficult time getting and staying hard.  This sounds like it could help.
7pm est i think
Sir, this is a poker table.
WTF is this shit. BAN
can't wait to see it dump AH
NIO $20 tomorrow would be the funniest shit ever
NIO and NKLA might be but TSLA certainly isn’t...   I assume you think of Tesla as just a car company.  :-)

Needed now more than ever.
no
People who don't sell when up 1000% on Nio are the type to think they are an anime protagonist. If ya did not sell and u let greed take over, you deserve to lose your tendies to theta gang
Nvm, back here again LOL
I know lmaoooo its so funny
You sure this wont continue to bleed this week?
Holding 5/21/21 55c.  Not too worried about it.  Gonna hold til at least NIO day.
7 i think
you called it.
no it would probably pump cuz mf'ers will rotate
I’m holding $35 puts
Came so close to buying some inverse bear etfs but this market is not dumping.
It seems like it only goes down :(
how much does nio have to go up for calls to make money? Like 3% at least?
Lol do you not have enough money to buy this?

She admits to using a private email server. Using a private server is a felony. Therefore, she is admitting to a felony. I hope that makes sense...

Also one point to note... the "old data" that got deleted by Platt River Networks was in fact data for which there was a subpoena. Soooo yeah. That's bad. Their IT guy even got caught posting questions on reddit about how to obfuscate email evidence.

I think the law should be applied equally. I don't care how powerful people are. In fact, I think prosecuting more powerful people should take precedence over less powerful people. Want to know something crazy? We can actually prosecute more than one person at a time. I know, I know... It sounds insane, but its true! If you want to start posting other criminals and evidence of their crimes then fine. You seem to be trying to protect a particular criminal due to your inherent tendency toward communist mental gymnastics. I want them ALL locked up. I don't give a fuck.

If you or I miss jury duty we will be thrown in jail. Why do you think the powerful should be able to get away with their crimes?
NO I WILL MY PENIS IN YOUR ANUS !!!

NIO WILL FALL!!

I AM THE TRUTH U WEAK FUCK CANT TAKE THE PRESSURE HHAHAHAHAHAH

I die everytime I see that shit on the front page; I swear to god somebody better post it.
duped again by the GYNA
The worst part is  
If Nio moons to 60, or even just 55, all these FOMO retards will think they're Warren fucking Buffett because they blindly held.
Yea dude what do you think
No it’s like RS, you fake to be a chick to get extra items/loot

Nio Nio Nio!
Fuck, should I buy PLTR or wait??? It's like trying to jump on a moving elevator and I am afraid of getting cut in half 🤦‍♂️
what app do you use for trading?
Exactly what I was thinking... so if the company was an LLC and they paid themselves... it's gone.
I don’t even have NIO calls or shares anymore but I hope it moons just to see the 🌈🐻 suffer
Just sell a call above the strike price and make spreads to secure profits
Someone is spamming the downvotes, Sad! Fake Downvotes!
i guess.  FML
How many calls are you holding? I’m playing DKNG
Whats a woman
At this point I'm "only" losing what's left of my initial investment. Obviously I wouldn't be buying this same option for the price I paid expecting it to climb tomorrow, but I can hope we hit $55+ tomorrow and I can sell for more than what they're worth now
Meanwhile everyone is invited to his house for a dinner party.  Arnold was way better gov.
Yeah I’d hold if I had calls
Wtf are shares?
Nio bulls be like: “LOOK AT THIS GRAPHHHHHHHH”
And here I was hoping they referred to themselves as Uruk Hai or orcs. Maybe that’s just Jean in marketing 🤷🏻‍♂️
While you are insufferable overall, in this comment you are correct
BA truly has retard strength. I understand the 737 Max re-certification is tomorrow.  
  
**But who the fuck is buying planes for the next 2-3 years?**
Thoughts on CIIC?
been flat at 14 since 11cst but ok
Look like Tesla calls
It will...  just not today!
Who here is actually retarded and buying NIO FDs at 250% IV?
NIO gang shitting themselves rn damn
Both
There’s always hope, just don’t take the L’s personal. Realize you fucked up and that your next play has to be your best play. Take your time with it
If QQQ can just break 291 by EOD puts are gonna print tomorrow
Lost money on Tesla today tbh not NIO. I had a feeling something was up when there was no resistance hardly after the morning and NIO wasn’t bringing any of the other EV with it... I was actually afraid they were going to pull this shit in the morning tomorrow and it would be worse. So I’m glad they did it now, because anybody that can hold through that shit is in it to win it. I didn’t sell and I’m still in. Ride or die baby
[deleted]
NIO is gonna fuck me isn’t it
Yeah but there is always the flip side of the argument
Airplanes are worse...
Tickers that end in Q are the best. The Q stands for “quality.”
That’s the point and what makes wsb entertaining 

Stop warning ⛔️ them asshole 

Let them learn there lesson it will make me better traders in the future
I believe you are forgetting RKT on this list
This is a fucking investment sub reddit. We are just here to lose all our money not being fucking psychologist. Dumb bitch.
Are there actually women folk here in WSB?
How about you go fuck yourself? Real life is all that matters and I’m sitting here eating creme brûlée and prime ribeye idgaf what anyone here thinks I just give good advice and whoever is smart understands it, everyone else is just mad it’s not what they want to hear
Federally schedule 1, not schedule 1 in all states.
How anti-American of you.
Hey man. That was me last year. Learn from it and realize that this money you had was just kid money. I know that sounds stupid now, but this is before we really need the money and before we actually have careers. If investing is part of your future be happy you learned some lessons now and not when the money needs to go to your mortgage payments and bills.
Lmao 🤣
Sorry about your losses tomorrow bro. You’ll get it next time with your 3x/year gains

NIO back to 49 for close....
The real NIO surprise will be it going sideways and fucking everybody.
It literally can't go tits down!
[removed]
You're goddamn right you will, I still gotta make those tendies or all in on $ROPE
buddy.. Sell someone a put 1 strike lower and lock in your gains. You can just close both positions tomorrow.

You’re gonna get fucked
Bro are you saying I should double down 🤔
Does not
You shouldn’t be using the same logic to compare RKT to new EV companies. For your puts I’M HOPING FOR THE WORST!! ‘only cause I have Dec and Jan calls no hard feelings :)’
I like the way you think

We seriously gotta wait till 7 for the earnings? I don’t even have positions in it but I’m so excited
Short or puts ?
Thanks for the history lesson.

1/15 NIO 49p -- that shit has to go down some time
Yes, if a company goes bankrupt, after assets are sold off, debt holders r fuk
Shut the fuck up already jesus christ youre so annoying, dumb lil bitch. Also I have only a small amount of Nio shares, so shut yo trap.
Jan 15 Palantir $15 put 15 contracts
I really want AMD and NVDA to pump after earnings, this needs to happen FFS
Hoping our day comes, feeling good about long term prospects but hate to see the rest of the market mooning up
WMT was underwhelming - sold half of my 1000 share position today - everything was priced in, prob same with target.  Commentary on the call will be good to see how it they see holiday shaping up with lockdowns, etc.
Jesus this post made me shit my pants I’m down about 20 quid...
This is the way.
Triple money every year?? R u jeff bezos? If i start at 18 with 1k in savings, and triple my money every year, im a billionaire by 31, and the richest man alive at 35.

Looking at the performance on these new AAPL M1 chips and I'm wondering what the fuck INTC has been doing all this time
Thx you too friend
MMs pinning NIO to fuck either bears or bulls afterhours lol

LETS GET READY TO RUMBLE
Me to I’m up 7% already 

I’m shorting nio to the fucken ground 

In GYNA they happy taken western ers monies anyway
[deleted]
I'm holding out till tomorrow I think it might gap up tonight but all the 20 day ta makes me think a correction
you're big dumb if you're holding NIO FD's through earnings. exchange them for long calls asap
IF the 737 is officially ungrounded tomorrow I will be selling my position in BA (up %110). I do think that some of this run up is vaccine but also some is the 737 news. I hope for another pop for me to exit then I could see some sell the news happen
i call upon all artists to pump this garbage (please)
I bought them last week at $407 so I have great profit but I was working this morning and missed the boat on selling above $450
PLTR, BLNK, SBE, or RIOT for tomorrow?
You gonna hold into tomorrow?
Maybe put half in now and then half in tomorrow
The biggest bubble stock of the whole year(2nd tesla, 3rd nkla, 4th spce) is about to report earnings...

Google suggested password, my dude. I don't even know what it is except it has a capital W somewhere in it.
Yes
Paragraphs, retard.
Not today because we would expect that, they have to do what we least suspect, and then when we are all like, where's the EOD fake pump bros? they'll be like, huh what? Illegal pump, we have no idea what you're talking about. And then I rake in all my puts the next morning.
We get it, your moms a whore. Move along
Upvote if actually retarded.
I'm willing to take donations to sell, it will for sure go up as soon as I take my losses.

DONT U DARE SHY AWAY. YOU BETTER POST LOSS PORN ON NIO. IF YOU HYPED IT AND DID NOT SELL WHN YA WERE 20000% UP THATS ON YOU. POST THAT LOSS PORN. BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
Best strike and expiry..they call this one the milly maker
Take a look at nearly all EVs (not just Chinese). They all had a big red candle at the same time (3pm EST). Even TSLA went down some at that time.
You guys think BABA bounces back at all by eow 11/20?
Hey can you shit flinging monkeys grab more PLTR tomorrow morning?  I'm down from 250% up for the day to 150% and that's making me sad
shut up

The bounce this morning only happened because the entire overnight session was net short, so we spent most of the day rebalancing, and now we can proceed lower having retested those areas.   


Yesterdays EOD spike up was a stop run so also fake news. Real direction is down/sideways as we pin around 3600 due to options flow and wait for expiration this week. Later this week or next we likely see a more directional move, I'm betting on 3450 next week.

gl to ALL on NIO... its gonna be crazy.
Not sure yet. From what I've read they probably leveraged a weakness somewhere in my online life. I was using one of the Google suggested passwords so it didn't match any other password.
A lot of NIO holders, both puts and calls, are gonna wake up tmw and have to google what IV crush is
and they are all gonna rip tsla a few new ones in discovery, no more games
why won’t cruise ships tank?! Whose still getting on those floating Petri dishes?
nope, 80 by tomorrow

Right? Down anyway, might as well take the plunge to the bottom with the potential for a nice reward

NIO going back up shaking out the weak hands
Just depends I had 3.5 amc calls I bought Friday to sell Monday morning and they opened at .15 from the .5 I bought them at but I played the moderna angle for reopening. Just depends it works it can just be crushed so depends. I dunno but now you know why it happens
That’s what I’m here for
800 bucks for a $47 strangle on nio
I couldn’t do it, I’m terrified that NIO is gonna crash to $25 by tomorrow morning lol

Papa Jerome
WTF I just took a shit and my nio plumped :(
don’t wanna get ptd but damn i rly should’ve dumped these nio puts haha, luckily i only spend 20 bucks on a single put so
I'm buying LEAPS on this. The long term fundamentals for BABA is good, but I don't know how long this fiasco between Jack Ma and Xi will last, so I ain't playing no short term calls.
NIO Calls and Puts. thats it
the all mighty power of the fed my son.
It wasn't enabling options that ruined you. It was getting into options without doing any research. I'm guessing you just saw the top posts on wsb and invested into crazy OTM calls after the stocks mooned and then held until expiration without hedging at all and you probably never bothered to watch even a simple youtube video on what the Greeks mean. I know this because I did the exact same retarded shit when I first started. Luckily I learned my lesson and bought a nice 35c leap on NIO when it was around 28 and then sold an 11/20 35c for NIO. So my point is even when you learn to do stuff right you still lose.
Forgot what infinite meant, thanks bro 🙏🏽
Wow just figured I would do some chart work on NIO, you lot have balls of steel playing his retarded stonk, gl to you all
lmfao. This is the way
Not holding any NIO but got my popcorn ready to watch it AH
Wouldn’t it be ironic if it was BA. Everyone thought he sold the bottom on airlines but really he was just consolidating cash in BA cause it had the most upside
The king is back!
Bought a dirty disgusting gay ass put to hedge my beautiful NIO shares. Feel like a sorry piece of shit
If you bought PLTR at IPO yields are better than reselling PS5s
You are making me feel powerful.

No idea 🤷‍♂️
My teacher got it and he had terrible after symptoms, more worried about that than anything. We all going to get it at this point.
BA TO THE SKY
My Fidelity screen glitched for a second and it showed that Nio was in red and down 2%. Maybe it’s a glitch in the system and Neo from the Matrix has chosen me to warn humanity.
guess we’ll find out after hours
NIO keep bangin

90%. Everyone wins. Bears win a day, bull can run it back up in a month and we all laugh at china.
I bought in 3 days ago, sold today. Was supposed to be longer term but hard to pass up quick 30% gains. I was planning to buy back on a dip though - would be curious your thoughts on why should I stay away?
Not selling NIO...already made profits from it...let's face!!
Pltr power hour
Son going to pump AI stocks with $80billion cash. Any good recommendations?
Yes I want to DESTORY it 

Burn it to the ground and have my penis in your anus while I watch your nio burn 🔥

Just before the 3pm sell-off, i sold couple NIO 52/54 credit spreads for a hundred bucks or so...  Buy it back for a measly 25% profit, or let it expire?
Why is this dip happening? Not only in one stock at the same time on xpeng, Li, Ba, and a others...
Because he’s selling the covered calls

I’ve been balls deep in APHA since my mom walked in on my and my Cantaloupe.

Now that i finished the fruit salad, APHA is looking into THC infused beverage market in the US.

EVERYONE IS GOING TO TRY TO GET INTO THE CANNABIS MARKET ONCE FEDERALLY LEGALIZED.

Weed is just that. A weed. It grows easily. THC infused beverage market has more barriers to entry, and this is APHAs niche.

APHA is going to use the over produced, non-premium weed and extract the THC to infuse into beverages solving two problems. 

1) Excess inventory is eliminated, reducing holding cost and allowing APHA to dispose of excess non-premium weed productively 

2) A market with higher barriers to entry, and greater penetration into festival/concert/public venues where smoking is not a viable alternative. (Also, bitches be complaining about calories, diet THC beverages anyone)?

TLDR: APHA is the Becky stock of weed.
Bet !!!
Well yeah you don't buy and then sell at a loss. Leave your emotions at the door and look at this logically. This will be much higher in 1 year. Don't look at pltr for another 3 months. Stonks go up & down but good ones like PLTR ultimately go up long term. Relax
Well that sucks why can’t you help a brother out
Hopefully some big AH buys with some pre marker news for a nice +5% day.
Fuck it why not
His ass
True, it’s going to be 60+ tomorrow
DKNG i can only get so hard
Sorry, I don't use reddit that much. I mostly just use it to ask questions but I saw that this subreddit was quite active so I posted here.
Yes. I am. 
Predicted the exact time of the rug-pull
Yeah I’ll just avoid buying shit on Fridays then. I don’t hold anything longer than a couple of days anyway.
Am I a moron for not selling my nio calls earlier?
Can’t wait to see bears crying tommorow when NIO moons. Is it that hard to realize that everyone who was gunna dump already fucking did it? ER is going to be better than xpeng combined with these facts it’s not really a no brainer to see what’s going to happen. But I guess that’s why I triple my money every year while bears lose all of theirs
Fuck NIO, RIOT is the new meme stock. Going to $20 a share by January

Finally bailed on my 11/20 35c on LI today. So glad I did. Saved me from losing about $600...
We’ll see in exactly 23 mins🙃
NIO is no TSLA. Inversed sentiment. Today I'm gay on NIO boys\~ ;)
Place your bets
Nah man you need to get out by tomorrow end of day. Lots of states talking about closing down by Wednesday if things don't get better which they won't. The news itself will make DKNG go down even if it doesn't deserve it to

PLTR OTM Cs
Y’all remember that day when NVAX dropped 30% AH and came back to being +15% like 10 minutes later? That’s the most money I’ve ever made in one play. All in shares too
Dang, HYLN with the big dick energy
NIO about to explode to 60+ AH get in now
Not anymore it's been a ghost town in there since q3 started. I go to my local lowes almost daily. Home depot narrowly beat earnings this morn and dropped pps. Lowes is going to miss earnings I think

Robinhood should have a leaderboard for different stats. Could anonymize it by having usernames
She wants red so bad it’s not even funny.  Like watching them rearrange the chairs on the Titanic at this point.

What a wild ride NIO has been lmao
[deleted]
I wanna be a NIO bear but this shit is insane. I mean I would do a strangle. But at the end of the day I feel like I'd still lose money lol
free tendies
i don't think, unless you are ready to hold 3 months more

Bro the earnings call hasn't even happened yet. Give our baby some time she'll get there dw.
Nio is still green for the day for Fucks sake
Can’t stop me I have a snowmobile to assist my backcountry adventures bahahahha! Coulda had a better one if I weren’t retarded at stonks
Is BA going to moon tomorrow?
Merger with Tesla
These puts better net me 900% or I will be sad
Perfect buying opportunity
I made a whopping $15 on my NIO put, but I know its more than many of you will make tomorrow on NIO lol
Why? Ba has a strong resistance here. It's already popped too much
Memes gonna meme
😭😭✌️✌️
Buy at 50 on the way to 38.
Yes retail traders are 25% of the market now, not too long ago it was 11%
TAP SUM BONG!!!

NIO GET FUCKED
But you can’t cook the zook

It would be hilarious if we get a V back to 50 in the next 25 min.
He has a very long history and I only know what I learned from doing debate in school but he’s the type of globalist guy who thinks America shouldn’t be a superpower so he interferes in politics and shit

Edit: Monsanto his GMO business years ago has been tied to “a plethora of human rights issues” with chemicals, such as agent orange according to google


Edit 2: it might be a note of relevance that Palantir has stated it won’t do business with Russia or China (due to the risk) and that’s not very globalist
Imma need ACB to take a NIO style dump
Yea it's a good company with plenty of growth ahead but all this hype is making it volatile af.
Lmaooo at that strike
I guess I'm holding my NIO calls through earnings. Let's do this, boys
*All of my love, all of my love All of my love to you, oh...* 🎶
Whatever is happening with this Fed Governor voting right now, better not wreck this market. I hear there are more nays than yes so far
DraftKings probably blew up thousands on the line down from $63-35 lol
I can accept that.  I just remember my $15 c being worth like $1100 for a few moments
45 bps from the days high is not a *cliff* youngin
That’s just Wall Street bets, there is other and better communities for stocks.
[deleted]
I bet not.
NIO ER leaked or something? Either that or major profit taking i guess.. but retail is too retarded to realize gains before ER's..
You’re telling me this isn’t the forum for one easy trick to get rich?
$49 to $46.50 was enough for me. Sold my nio puts
AAPL, AMD,and NVDA need to get it together
BCLI... biotech companies cucking me again
Pltr calls
No
How am I a buffoon when I have nio puts. ????
What other new IPOs are good to hold long term? Tired of the big FANGs
looks cool hope it prints 🌸
[deleted]
$360 support looking really strong. Gg bears
NIO to 60+ AH buy calls now while they’re on sale
That does not make an emergency sell situation.
Nio is dead
For the sake of this thread I hope that’s the case. To this looks like an early leak of earnings and an absolute dump of shares. But I have been wrong before, I use to look at this thread for DD lol
Quick call recommendation before market close?
5k isn't much
[removed]
Picking NIO direction after earnings is just a fucking shot in the dark at this point
Found out my neighbor caught the covid. Everyone stay safe. Even if y’all don’t go out most of the time. 👍
Weak hands set free
So sell January 1st got it thanks
Did you get rich?
If you guys like us commie ass so much why not buy BABA it is oversold and a multi area tech giant just like amazon. I hate Jack Ma after his Conference with Elon, but business wise that guy has some brain.

hmm...
fuck it, la-z-boy earnings play
Spy puts
Buy it up. It's on sale right now
I would prefer this as well, but with the recent Soro’s news some of these chumps might chicken out
Fuck it I grabbed $30 calls for next March today
Yes 180 and 230 has been a fair range the past several months. TDOC is one of the few stonks near the bottom of it's range, so I'm liking the future, as are you no doubt

I mostly okay bull side by writing outs anyways, I'm happy to be assigned TDOC at 167.50 this Friday lmaooo
25-30
No
I will cum so hard
Team...what's the plan EOD today...hit me...there are no stupid ideas

I'm holding FSR and TSLA
😐
Losing money *as a bull* on NIO. That's special
Everybody is askin "where is Nio going?" Or "when did you buy into Nio?" Its never "how is nio?" 😔
Nope
Yea dude what r u stupid
I’m not saying they won’t have another one, I’m saying CNBC is talking about the bigger regional banks merging to close the gap with top 4. GBCI isn’t in that big regional bank group.
This is not a tank and this is not EOD.
DKNG, DKNG, DKNG! I told everyone on this sub to hop on! We are headed towards 50+.
Who stole your girl?
nah, bought when it dipped later
Yeah you aren’t invited.
For sure. I only started trading around January of this year so idk how “normal” trading behaviors were pre covid, but given the amount of followers this sub has gained this year as well how a lot of stocks are “memed and hyped” in this sub, I’m sure trading behaviors (on average) now are way different than they were even a year ago.
More like 60+ lucky trades lol. Micro scalps on both TSLA and FB.

I accounted for 30% of FB 275c volume last week
would you rather go into earnings oversold or overbought?
Mmmm people are idiots enjoy your holdings
[deleted]
when mine tingles, I'm just pissing myself.
Why buy either when you can buy NIO?
with the paradigm shift in china and the focus on ev, i'm long at cbak anyway, at least a year. maybe five. then we'll see.
What could you be in better the nio
When do you think I bought it
NO
Over 250% IV.  I don't even know what that means, but it's high af
Pltr
Screw VXX
Bruh, my nephew are 2 and 4 and they be watching some violence af YouTube videos that are advertised as kids.
Could you maybe just, like, I don’t know? Stop taking a nose dive? Thanks
NIO amazing ER incoming. All paper hands and bears time to cry
just buy GME stock, options too expensive.
I assume you bought 2022 leaps, instead of the stock, because you wanted more leverage. How much leverage do the 2022 leaps give you ?

You found this out early and for that I commend you. Now, take my hand as we ride the roller coaster of a bull life.
I'd be up so much more on my Nio puts if I just waited til today instead of buying a chunk yesterday and averaging down all day :(
can the market close already god damn
why did spy fall off a fucking cliff
That’s why you don’t use retarded simple passwords, make them as complicated as robotically possible
He lost real bad
I sold my calls for profit
For sure! I’ve used them before and always thought they were good in person too
PLTR C leaps
Too late to jump on the PLTR train?
there will be just a brief stop at 410 on the way down- if you have $ i'd really consider taking it, but you need to decide
They’re the only thing I have that’s green right now
I like 18 over close that’d be preferred
So what did you do? :p still holding here
NIO holder spotted.
Just fade SV
For all the people preaching “bUy NIO bEfOre eARninGs” here’s your dip lol
Y’all bears brag about any tiny victory you can lmfaooo NIO gonna be up tomorrow and y’all gonna go back into yo cave

Wanted to put a sell order at 44, ended up selling it all by mistake. Could have been worse, I'll take it as a sign I guess
Legal.  Cool.  Healthy.  Imagine.
hypothetically speaking, if NIO keeps drilling the fuck down after ER, how deep you are expecting?
Draftkings mooning hop in if you want to get rich
Shut the fuck up, pussy
Didn't even know my slv calls had more money to lose lmao

So close to being 69.420%
Damn covered calls on NIO are fucking juicy
Lol post loss porn tomorrow
Fuck you  :((((((
RIOT
Unless insider trading happened that’ll likely come up on ER it was absolutely profit taking to realize gains on an INSANELY volatile stock.
NIO call holders. Stand back and stand by
Earnings haven’t come out. What if it moons
not too good tbh
Watching the big short right now. I love this movie.
WHY BUY TSLA WHEN YOU CAN BUY PLTR?
MM really tryna keep NIO flat for pre ER loading up eh
HOLD THE LINE. 🌈🐻 GETTING CUCKED HARDCORE
Lets gooo!!
That’s how some religions started and doing very well.
[deleted]
So... Considering that NIO has had a 2500% increase in the past year, it seems like they have to absolutely decimate earnings or else they'll flop. Anyone else agree?
No the article means it’ll run until December 31st crash cause of employees then buy back in.
If you’re holding over the weekend and they are weeklies I’d recommended itm plays as they don’t get crushed but are more expensive and if it doesn’t move like you want your otm goes down a lot. That’s the trade off
MM wants cheap calls
Sorry friend.... insiders seem to know earnings bust
His anal beads told him so
Ba and ge are gonna be on an upward climb from here on out.
depends on how much it is, cash out everything that u dont think u need to use. it will also help with fomo and itll make ur trades safer. no point it have 10k in an account if ur only gonna use 2k at a time, keeping it in will just make u want to use it and potentially lose it
I really hate that all EV basically move in unison
My 40c 11/20 went from $10.15 to 7.85 in 20 minutes :///
Which of the following is the best idea

* GME puts
* ZM calls
* PLTR calls
* SPY puts

Here is the story about NIO and the reason why it did falling.
Holy shit look at that volume on nio lmao
MARA and RIOT
Been telling myself for the past 4 earnings seasons I won’t hop in on some meme play action. But then I realize I have to in order to be in the loop with all my fellow retards. 10k on some NIO shares for a little fun gamble
Don’t @ me tho. Just come back in two years and we will see how I’m doing.
Hahaha bearish handlebar
I think it's low volume on indices in general.. Hopefuly it gets better tomorrow :/

Welcome shill

Not even in NIO anymore but excited to ER today good luck to all the boys with diamond hands out there
Isn't this sub proof alone that DKNG will print. Everyone loves a gamble.
TSLA 42 shares @240

NIO 245 shares @21

XPEV 36 shares @31
That’s a lot of percent

Hey is anyone in here holding shares/options in NIO by chance? They’re a Chinese EV company. Can’t tell if there’s any interest amongst you guys or not
Yea and announcing tik tok acquisition as well
Lmao
No. Flip your graph upside down.
Hey....no....👀
I’m up 40%. Even if I sell now that’s still a good move.
>Could Reddit go public via a SPAC, capitalizing on the fact that it’s the intellectual nexus for meme-based retail stock trading? “Great company. A lot of upside. Weak-ass CEO, which I think is beneficial for a SPAC because they won't do a roadshow,” one venture capitalist mused.

Fucking hell, what a time to be alive boys.
Why is PLTR up 12%?
It hit that today
we rlly out here
NIO isn't Tesla. In fact it's trading at 10x higher than Tesla was when it was relatively the same size.
Bears trying to make profit before nio moons
it’s tru
Hope so
It’s one of my top worst nightmare not holding Tesla when Elon tweets “Tesla 2”.

Always depends on the situation. If it’s a pure gamble then probably but just do whatever seems right
Well. That’s obviously shorts all selling at once tho.
Merger with Hertz
If you buy the NIO dip you are black
I would throw money at NIO lottos if I wasn’t all in on another play with the little I have left
WSB is profiting off retards before we become the retards
Tgt earnings anyone?

Why is that?
Hop on astrazeneca
As someone else said, you need to add a 6th qualifier. Any company on the S&P500 that merges with another company on or off the S&P500.
Just fuck my shit up NIO, just fuck my shit up. I yield. Plunge my account to the abyss I don’t even care to sell at this point.
Agreed
lol its all about convenience
Checks for a dip - up 12%
Buy the dippp
Some yeah, maybe not all.
although full disclosure...i did get a EOW 420P
Has investors place been banned from stock markets for price manipulation? Are they losing legal appeals currently?

Yep still holding from 2 weeks ago 💎
>	The story behind a stock’s price is the behavior of the traders.

Really good way of phrasing this
LOL
So it looks to me like there is zero truth to all this Nio tanking bullshit, yeah?

No news. And basically people just secured gains for a small drop on today’s growth... doesn’t seem like an emergency. 

Am I missing something?
NIO puts if you got balls
# wayment... stonks go a different direction then up?
Wonder why Indians and Chinese never get hired under affirmative action?

I really wish the NFL would make a rule every team has to have at least one Indian guy for diversity.

In bed with PLTR 12%

Popcorn has a profit margin of 99% during coronavirus when no one eats it?
I’m about to lose money on nio, thinking of starting a support group for all the people who are about to also
Optimist words thanks
Ride Pltr? are we gonna see a spike anytime before market closes?
SPCE wtf
Everyone’s loss^
Most definitely.
Does anybody know more about some Kodak Rumor
yes
I think it should be baselining at 220ish. But so much uncertainty and volatility these days, have no idea when that’s going to happen
Lost 5k today but did not sell anything so we'll see
People buy calls playing the earnings run up but don't have the stones to hold through er.
Here I am overseas thinking NIO already reported.
Don’t be an idiot. Sell
So do I even hold onto my TSLA December calls or just take profits? Is this thing going back to $410?
In the pandemic I believe we benefit from people making individualized decisions because it's a little hotbed of experimentation. 

I won't be in a gym for a while, but I'm glad some people are going. Counter intuitive perhaps.
I was hoping to sell before the dip too. I literally stepped away for 30 minutes and this happens. Fml. Welp, gotta wait until after earnings now. I doubt thered be a crush now.
Holding $60 leap into 2023 that im up 23% on. All this is just background noise
If you’re up 100% is it best to cash out profits?
Lemme taste that $18 PLTR again wizard daddy 🧙‍♂️
What’s your cost average?
So me buying at 17.80 was bad

If SPY doesn’t hold 360 we’re going to open at 330 tomorrow
It's ok..i forgive you...don't let it happen again
BUY NIO AT DISCOUNT RN
Awesome! 🐻
Except they've had several M&As  in recent years - no reason they wouldn't have another one now...
tsla holding strong at 440 while everythings tanking. BULLISH. 460 tmrw.
FUBO on a rip last 30 min
u muthafuckin holding dat bitch
Got me lol
1,526 shares. am i doing this right?
When have earnings actually mattered?
Pretty good chance it goes below 200 next week. But I’m selling at +20-30%
bet you 100 dollars that the general public will get it closer to the spring, around March-April.
every time I touch tesla, it wilts away like a rose in frost
Fuck I panicked and sold. Then bought back in after it stopped drilling, will it drill more wtf is happening

I do want to clarify so as not to mislead I am currently buying shares only, no options plays as looking at the IV premiums are way too high to play leaps which is the play I would do here. If I had to buy any calls here I would want to get at least toward the end of next summer to cover major sports reopening etc.

pltr calls getting real cheap, get some for dinner money
Both
Yea I suppose holding out for $5 would be stingy for a long term play. I'll buy at 40 then
I had ignored his first 2 posts and FOMOed into it after having watched it soar all summer. 

Our big mistake was not seeing it was only a 1B company. I think the problem is it’s too small for the algos and HF and big money to care about. Shit doesn’t track anything. It just flops around like the worthless company it is. 

Agreed. Fuck that dude and fuck me for being so loose with the cash. Don’t know why I felt 13k was a good idea but it’s really fucking lame now.
Tells you how your calls are gonna be moving
Think 3 years from now. You are gonna wish you held. Big time.

Jesus, neither unless you're planning on a PLTR dip in the next 24 hours to unload.
Yeah, I'm red literally everywhere.  TSLA, PLTR, NIO . . . all the meme stocks aren't going my way rn lmao . . . hell even SPY is now red for me
Ouch.
Homebuilders are not a good long term hold. Housing always crashes because wages can't keep up
RemindMe! One hour
You right, WW3 = SPY 400
For every 1 person telling you to take profits on NIO 100 others have already decided they were going to. Remember that. Doesn’t mean you’re doomed but you have to remember that the vast majority of traders are more rational than you and will gladly realize huge gains over risking losing it all to squeeze more out of it. The story behind a stock’s price is the behavior of the traders.
Yes
Was doing plenty of both
ill pass
Say it again, maybe the market will hear you
Bought a 30 dollar 69c for the meme of it. I don’t want to be left out of the history books if they actually pull it off
Fuck this ass company,  it's bouncing around i don't fucking understand
You will break even very soon
I listen
theyre shares. Hold for a while. PLTR has great long term prospects

Hold NIO shares through earnings?
Done cause scared
yes.  If bullish run happens, it'll reach it in 2 days.
Nasdaq retesting trendline it broke out of, will hold, buy calls for the bounce tomorrow
DD: NIO has only gone up 2300% this year. Numbers are infinite (never end), meaning NIO’s potential is infinite
Rotation into my ass tomorrow
NIO BEARS stand back and stand by
Hey I’m 4K richer, I’m okay with that 😂
They always are
But it seems to me like it’s much worse from a Friday to a Monday then like a Monday to Tuesday.
Already about all in on PLTR, should I add more on this dip or wait longer for another dip?
[deleted]
Colorado just announced a shut down so no skiing vacations.
NIO shrugging off that minor dip..straight line to 50 by EOD...then 60+ AH
What are your calls?
No other choice besides holding.
And the idiots who see it fall and decide to sell, too
NIO $55.61 tomorrow
why do people with so little $$ keep talking about technicals?
Lol that’s how much I lost today >:(
lol they just got sick of doing DD and made up some BS headlines
It just will man, I’m not going into full on analysis on here...
Got it.
Done
7pm est
After looking into it a bit more, it looks like Nov 17 was just the estimated date based on last year.  JKS hasn't even announced a date on their website yet, but mid-December would track with their Q2 date.  My b.

On the bright side, that means my short 11/20 60P position is looking good.
I bought a single one. I better have $18 by friday
Yes it is👌🏼
Its crazy how I go from rich to below the poverty line in a mere few hrs
Last I heard you can still get it again. Anyway, as long as you go at non-peak hours, wear a mask, and do a bit of sanitizing you’ll hopefully be fine.

They hire retards and call it affirmative action.
As of now you can’t purchase pfe calls. Is this because they are waiting for approval?

It was PNC buying BBVA. Next probably involves USB and Regions. Glacier doesn’t have nearly the assets to be lumped into that regional group they’re referring to.

Is my PLTR 18.5 11/20 fuk?
Nike one is just a bit better IMHO
why?
$200 loss LOL
I’ve hardly done any real work since the election. In that time I’ve spent countless hours trading for a meager profit, read more Mango man tweets than work emails, and most importantly followed WSB religiously, the same forum that produced a piss drinking murder dungeon maniac.

I regret nothing. ☺️
Very powerful
Was wondering too. For once Hyln is doing great
Everyone playing NIO, get in DKNG now. We are heading towards 50 and beyond!
Agreed. Its WAY up on the year, which its so hard to imagine further climb. There are analyst predictions into the 300's. Mostly centered around expansion outside of China. This is where the real uncertainty is. IF they can prove succesfull outside China, it will moon for the next few years.
Honestly anyone who bought NIO puts all joking aside has no business playing in the stock market that’s just suicidal
A year of salary yo. Save what you can!
It feels bad
Should have bought more but I’m a pussy
Damn you did that good in the market today?
Congratulations sir you now gave nio 1/15th their revenue in auto sales for the months of October and November.
No, no, no. Tape down the backyard. A dog. You. A camera. Poop. It’s the only way.
Bought 1000 Shares of PLTR at $18.5. Hold?
We pumped for months and months on nothing but bad news, sometimes stonks just do their thing
Get ready for the pump boys bears close your positions now
Royal move king. If I get some big wins on my calls I’ll do the same
So NOK is more of a 5G play and wait for it boom on a play - it’s a bit more risk not much flucatuon so understand the hesistation for sure
Holy fuck what a dip someone explain?
WHAT THE FUCK NIO WHYYYYY
neither of are wrong, we just didnt specify what we were talking about. Investing and betting are the same word.
Representing
You good fam. :D
Anybody know the actual time for the Nio ER Report?
do we keep them put options or dump it?
I brought 4 contracts for the hell of it

Shoutout to the retard in the TSLA thread who advised not to FOMO into TSLA calls at open as it will be a slow bleed through the day. You saved me thousands of tendies!
I had a bunch of GDRX 11/20 puts that sold in a stop loss a few weeks ago, when it went up for a day or two. Add that to the list of failures.
Trusted my gut and sold my PLTR calls at 10am...
Deadly serious.
Already did $$$$
Let’s go SPY, power half hour
Yeeheeee
Some big $$$ whale just buys up calls on stuff like NIO and then dumps them when WSB starts buying. It's funny how no one does the opposite
He Got over stimulated and she left him on Read.
Very nice very healthy. Building above the 8 day ema. 

I believe bears r fuk🍵
I can't wait to BTFD all through the rest of the year, just gonna keep adding to my 3/21c $400 SPY position ;)
Probably just bought some near the top of today.
lol, same here. I wished that I had bought more.
all in on amazon
Not sure. But I think talks are going well.
It might drill soon
Same
Really is
Net bulls I need your energy!
I'm holding rn
No you 🌈🐻, NIO🚀
LI PUTS LI PUTS LI PUTS
Buying pltr now prepare for massive dump. Also on the shitter atm.
My bad, I'm still learning terminology
undervalued pltr is free money
We ride the ER train boys. No going back now.

Citron is good for short term shorting not much bright on longs.
Talking like a sassy  🌈 doesn’t make you right lol
Elon probably has the 🌈est smile on his face right now telling his robot son he is battery king.
Lmao the MMs fuking both tsla calls and puts. Pure manipulation
Yup, I try not to be overly autistic. I’m about even this year on options but hit for 300% on PYPL calls. The rest I owe to ENPH, and the future I will owe to BCRX
I thought the earnings call would make NIO spike after hours and then it will drop tomorrow morning. I'd say buy calls now, sell the calls at open tomorrow and buy puts to capitalize on the after-earnings-call drop?
Good for you pal
Idk nigga do I look like I have a crystal ball 😂😂😂
Hold till retirement
Hold them like your life depends on it if you love money, NIO at 21 is a once in a lifetime golden ticket
Why would it dump?
QQQ will not pass 293. It just won’t
How is that misused?
NIO needs a perfect ER to bounce back, but does the dump continue after market?
RH only shows closing prices on the charts. For example look at Kodak’s. It hit $60 but on the peak RH shows $33 because that was closing price.
So flat for the next 2 years?
We don't fucking care.  Either show us that you lost a lot of money, or don't post whining that you sold something too early.
Only have mid dec and leaps now (and gay shares)
Pltr 19c eow dirt cheap bois
Really want to sell a bunch of nio call credit spreads
Let's get that cheese!
Rotation back to TECH tmr 🤪
Too much diversification imo
Why do people playing with so much money not look at technicals
If ya'll werent busy sucking asian dick you couldve made some gains on PLTR
So hard to stop churning once u get started. How i blew up in rh. Chasing amd not taking profit
Lol there's hardly a "paradox."  You can't tell whether an earnings report will increase or decrease the stock price until it happens. Unless you have insider information, anyone who tells you different is lying. 

Most of the time, how an earnings report affects the stock price is whether the company is meeting or going to meet expectations. If a company misses earnings, but provides really good guidance, the stock price can still increase. Vice versa, if a company "absolutely blows their earnings expectations out of the water," but then says "oh by the way we are closing operations next fall," that can cause the stock price to tank.

So yes, I am sure you are surprised, but NIO has 50% chance of going up tomorrow and 50% of going down tomorrow after their earnings report. I know, shocker.
Sell it all and buy tesla
Sell itm calls

election passed
Most likely

Talks are going *well*
and where do you look at that plzzzzz
You seen the charts today? Tf you talking about volatility as if the pandemic volatility would be here forever ?
I’m guessing it is largely profit grabbers before ER. I’m assuming it will be back to 50 before end of week
[removed]
You can't be serious
changing NIO calls, selling 41c 11/20 for 45c 12/11
Sold it all :) going to chill for a bit and wait for great move opps instead of trading too much
feb 21
When they get EUA get ready for the pump
As soon as a WSBer notices a pattern, it reverses. Fuck
Here we go again, bears have been using this argument with Tesla and look at them now
NIO HAS GONE UP 2300% in one year so it still has room to go up 😂😂

🤣🤣🤣🤣🐻

SHORT THIS SHIT TO THE DEBTS OF THE SHADOW RHELM!!!
I've been married for 5 years, and after today, i'm wondering is signing a post-nuptial agreement a thing??

Strangle the hoe.

It's an adjustment, crush is such a toxic and problematic word.
Up 400 before crash now down 100
We took our pain the last month. Time for the 🚀
You'll defintely be missed
the stock is up 600pct this year....that is shorting it after it's gone up a lot

What would've moved the stock 13pct in 3 days if it didn't get included?
Not good
This is TD right?
im in NIO puts RIDE calls hoping for a rotation also could be retarded so take it for what you want
Idk???
Whatever happened to stimulus?

Market used to live and die on it but we haven’t gotten it and now nobody seems to care?

I was told after election it would happen but all I’ve heard is crickets and vaccine talk

Almost like the rich politicians don’t give a shit about the average joe after they secure their vote. 

Shocking
Fuck it bois I’m in once more
I sold calls
Lol bears saying bye from a 1 to 2 dollar dip that’s gonna get closed in before close and go up after ER. You must like losing money
Lmao you sold a weekly call when vol wasn’t elevated. I guess you really like exposure to tail risk. Hopefully a lesson for you about picking up pennies in front of steam rollers.
Airlines are fighting the dump.
Note to self:  ease up on the prunes

How so
12/18 PLTR calls.
WSB hates profits

No, you will post positions or be banned.
Nah.
Done
Nio has to move 20% for u to break even dawg
I may hold my calls just based on you fools’ opinions. But if we get IV crushed ima be sad
Guess I should have waited until EOD for these ZM calls....
NIO???  WhAt should I do with the shares??  Got in at $21
GME calls or PLTR puts?
Get in on TSLA

I cracked my teeth today too, hate when that happens

Makes sense lmao

Dude where’s my car
Glad I bailed on SPY early - trust your gut
man i traded like a fucking clown today. way over traded, chasing meme stonks, picking poor plays over all. went from  a $15 gain to an almost $200 loss. locked everything up with vertical spreads, will have a mess to clean up in the morning. need to stick to my rules, i made em for a reason lmao
Calls on calls
PPUUUUUUMMMPEEEEEEETTTTT
Really?? I’m about to be eating some tendies tonight
Leaving the basement. It's time
Did you buy back?
So humble! I bow to your greatness!
Pump starts every day in final 30 minutes let’s see if that trend continues
Thanks, I'm lopsided towards the put side though.  
I'm okay bag holding NIO if it goes south.
Iv crush is always real unless you’re months out
so Tesla,you uhh....you going back up anytime soon?my 11/27 call would appreciate it
no such thing retard. Hold the line
I'm hoping it drops to about 35. Nio seems like a good long term play for that price since its planning to expand into Europe

It's kind of shady that rh shows li's high on its late August spike at $23 when it reality it spent some time in the high $20s
nah hold that shit. just a lil profit taking, i'm not worried.
Buy the NIO dip
God bless your little heart.
Rewatching P&R,perfect timing.

the cheeto will get a second term have faith
Not playing TGT. Margin compressions expected . Will buy if it dips after earnings though.
Lemme see em. Make me feel better
Who likes short shorts?
probably will buy some soon but I'm not buying at the top of an +11% day. If NIO tanks after earnings tomorrow I'm loading up on calls. Holding boomer NIO shares for the long term.
AMZN really be rolling back huh?
NET calls
[removed]
Even more so than the Falcons and Pats?
If Nio tanks after earnings do you think it’ll affect RIDE?
Congratulations, you invented the 2008 financial crisis
Imagine believing theres a pandemic when stonks go up. Plus I’ve already gotten it.
Is that not largely profit grabbers before ER?
NIO dips being bought up by savvy investors
I mean I'm still down 8k
He said he’s selling because of moral disagreement
Got in at $20, gonna wait till it’s $19 to sell
Like it or not, big data is going to be huge in the future. It is huge right now. Everything you do on social media is tracked. I think I’m two years they will get a ton of government contracts and corporate contracts.
Okay but I’d figured I’d ask in a forum where we discuss stocks. Seems pretty rational to me. Source or don’t comment
lost 30k today playing tsla. calls at the top, and puts at the bottom.

going to diamond hand these puts and hope for a HUGE bognadov DOUMP
What’s a stock? Explain.
Bro I had shares and sold with a 10% loss, so no paper hands.
bears have taken over
My man that’s good to know. Might be a move, I bought 10 calls 2023
Expect pullback and then a moonshot I believe (230) possible ??
Here is the Oracle .

Oh okay
CRSR. Holiday season and AMD making tons of tendies with new products, gotta but cases, coolers, and RGB lighting from corsair to complete it
thanks man
It's okay you won't have to hear about it after today
Correct. I’m broke as fuck
Wtf is this tank?
Confirmation bias on NIO is so strong right now jeez
mods put the $ROPE HOTLINE UP NOW!
Lol spy with the classic pump and dump
Ya holding until 2022
Buy spy puts Friday exp your welcome
Mm shorting it
What’s a good move gents
??? I mean you can call it something different but either way the value of your option is going down
Bears been saying that since April
Expecting a resurgence before market close or a meh earnings call
When a stock is as volatile as NIO that’s what the fuck is going to happen DUH
Checked RH had Nio 3.5$ put I made money on and Nio 7.5 call I made money on. If only i bought and held lol

No
I had 2100 shares, sold down to 1200 at 12 bucks and 14 because I expected it to keep fluctuating back to a low like it had been. I bought back in in the 15s but definitely left a bunch of money on the table.

Fuuuck never seen that shit NIO you better fix this mistake

So is TSLA about to fucking settle the day at like $430? How tf did it sell off so god damn much in one day.
I bought shares this morning idk if that helps lol
me too man. me too.
Imagine having an opportunity to invest in Netflix when it was at IPO quite literally knowing it will be involved greatly in the future. Now think about why NIO is the price it is; and has further growth.
Im seriously not upset for missing the boat, because I had other plays going. But I’m waiting for the day that we move on from NIO. 

The solid DD is aight. But does every single person need to post “what do I do with my 5 NIO calls?” Or “Here is my 2k gain on NIO”
Even if earnings are ok, its way too pumped
Cmon man you’re just gonna get crushed by IV this time. The lesson here isn’t in your direction picking
Is small caps are the new tech. Thing is rock solid.
Legit trading strategy
Damn im fucking glad i sold before going in the gym
Yep. You are clearly the smarter one here and I take the retard crown. Were you riding the 70c that the pilot was pushing a few weeks ago? Most people were on 11/20s but I’m on the 1/15 so I’ve got 60 days before I fly this ship into a sink hole.  Down 95%. Shit sucks.
What shall we buy into?? Amazon??
Lol wait until BCRX gets berotralstat approved in Japan and USA, they’re ready to sell day 1 of approval. Costs $500K for a year of treatment
Exactly what I did
Serious?
Volatility gone, action gone, Mango tweets gone (not literally but nobody cares)...IF this is how next 4 years are gonna be, I am out man..
So, all in on NIO boys?
No one cares.  Seriously.  Stop with these fucking paper hands posts.
I’m sorry I thought this was /wsb not /investing
If u bought in today then yes
Wooo yes?
gawrsh what a mystery
NIO NIO NIO NOOOOOOOOOO
Position? And when did you buy
Bulls too confident. We due to plunge soon
And NIO... and TSLA... and AMZN....

How dare you!? This God of a man does not have cater to your desires! His one put reveals just a glimmer of his genius, along with the celestial sized balls that he will destroy you with if it so pleases him!
ByE $NIO
LOTS of people dropping out EOD before ER. fully expected this
This is gonna print
Well ya see there are reasons right? And of all those reasons NIO said “yes.... that one will do”
Back the truck up, the daily GME load-up is here.
Shares and leaps yes
My guess is it ran up and some people are trying to exit their positions before the earnings report, so it started and others saw the drop and also did the same, and it cascaded. I'm guessing it stopped because some people found a dip to buy back in at for those wanting to ride the NIO train tomorrow
[deleted]
It will rise in the future
🤡🤡🤡
Kinda leaning towards it have an 11/27 $20 call. Fuggit, what are you thinkin
If Nio could either moon up to 50, or crash back to 40, that would be great.  
Sick of sitting here with my dick in my hand, waiting for something to happen.
How many of you retards have Apple 12/18 130C?
But people listen to Citron??? 🤣🤣🤣
To let some inside trader get in on the tendies

This is the kind of quality research I expect to see on this sub.

This volatility is wilder than any Superbowl lmao
Thats a big upswing in 3 days. Currently holding 1200c for 1/2021

Nio
Lol at all the salty people hoping nio to fail cause they didn’t get in at $20
Both
NIO TO GONNA CUCK 🌈🐻
RIGHT BEFORE CLOSE
$50 EOD
Reminder:

THERE. IS. NO. SUCH. FUCKING. THING. AS. IV. CRUSH.
Might hit that AH at this rate.
Why not only use like, 5-20% of your portfolio for risky options gambling, and the other 80-95% for a bit more sound investing?

example, when riding the NIO train, I spent like $200 on options, and about $1500 on shares. I made like $1500 on the options, and only like $1,000 on the shares. 

Then with that $1,500, I can gamble it on a bit riskier bets, and not feel like I’ve lost any money that I worked for
Yeah, no kidding. Why would this fucking company try to take control from the fund manger that's doing stellar. Shareholders appreciate Cathie's management not the funcking fund per se. This is idiotic.
Am I retarded for buying RIOT calls? Probably but I need some feedback
NIO split eoy you heard me bois
It gonna be the greatest stock of all time
Get in now before it is too late!!!
hot snakes on the way
Really should have bought puts at $49...fuck
The amount of sleep I lose and stress I add just to lose money is unreal
Issuing more shares at earnings.
every data point known to man exists, have fun
my turkey’s been banging on the freezer door asking if it’s time yet
If nio disappoints is that good for tesla stock price?
Yeah the ride has been good but time to jump ships
Finally these fucks start selling. Note to self to wait until 245pm before buying puts

NIO IN FOOKIN SHAMBELS !!!!!

🐻 BEARKHAN 🐻
Is the IV crush over a weekend on an option 3-3 weeks out worse than one trading day to the next? Seems to me like if I buy something on a Friday it’s way down on Monday even if the price is relatively flat.
In the end I lost $86 on NIO. How bout y'all?
Ugh thank you. I've been struggling with this.

I bought 5 TSLA at 408 yesterday BY ACCIDENT (was fucking with a limit order at open and thought it was cancelled but it ended up going through) and I got out at $410 and was like "yeah, that was a good move" as it traded lower the rest of the day.

5pm I check my phone and see it's at $460 and I'm like "whyyyyyy" but to your point, I didn't have that information and made the best decision given the info that was available. Still kinda stings tho.
Bought calls, my bad
nio crashing the whole market
For sure. $20 by end of week man. Get in. Shit is hot hot hot
if i wanted to play options, I have hard rock casino just down the road. Similar odds there plus booze and women.
i bought puts
A hostile takeover, the fuck

What is it the 80’s?
you weren't getting fucked by the bears, they get just as gaped as the bulls. you were getting fucked by the volatility and theta gangs.
SPY will end day above $361
Only bother buying to close if you think it's really going to be well over your break even point by expiration.
ZM be hoping no one 👀 it's way
CRSR
lol

&#x200B;

thats some gay ass bear art
cause i bought
with you brother, just watching - made my money on NIO and PLTR and am enjoying the fun for a bit
SPY and randomly dumping for no reason whatsoever

Name a more iconic duo
It just takes a 11% pump for $SPY to reach 400
that NIO dump lmao
I call bullshit... he’ll buy the dip and fuck your puts
Merrill edge: You will regret later boy.
257.2
All 3 imo! Those stocks all have a solid future ahead of them. Bough SBE calls for Febuary $30 today
[removed]
I’m surprised everyone is surprised.... did all you retards just pile back into NIO after the last rug pull?
Very true. It's easy to dump $200 into a dumb TSLA 1DTE $500 call and turn it into $4000 or whatever, but even on wallstreetbets most people aren't dropping $15K into these same options. 

Those that do are likely braindead or love the rush, maybe both
Why is this market so afraid to rally
hold that shit
Likely a large firm unloaded a shit ton of shares triggering algo momentum into a downtrend
Nah doesnt mean anything he pulled put because he doesnt agree with pltr morally not because of the company
There will not be a 30-40% correction
Kodak vaccine pump at 95% success rate tomorrow.
Naw, IV way too high.
Buying PLTR at 18 is like buying TSLA below $5 presplit
So TSLA flat for the next  3 months again?
Why did nio drop. I’ll give you gold if your answer satisfies me.
Because it’s a GYNA company with BEARLY no sales 

U got hustled hahah
anyone holding pltr over night?
FL for earnings anyone ?
Someone have inside info of the sell off at 3 on $NIO?
made a modest 200% profit on PLTR. thank you retards
Why are you the way you are
Losing money off NIO? Nice.
I understand! Never sell at loss
1) Wait till end of day to buy shares. 
2) Hold.
[removed]
In 1 year they will by higher than now. Honestly here is the worst place you can come if you hold shares. Majority here do options and a few +/-ve % swing in a day is rip for them hence the " OMG NIO!". " Get out nio!" etc. Don't let that deter you from your long term play like I did and sold all my nio/xpev shares at open yesterday
thats cool just bought 10 55c 11/20 for 1.47
FUCKEN TANK NIO HELL YES!!!

FUCK U NOOBS HHAHAHHAAH

I have one of these sea scooters: they won’t take you very far.

 I've been holding some, they barley gained any value at all.

Correct. The 90% effective number is assuming you had a direct exposure to the virus (after completing the full vaccine process), you have a 90% chance of not being infected. If you don’t assume direct exposure, then his numbers make more sense.
Lmaoooooooooo. BUY HIGH SELL LOW🤡
Go to hell SPY
I’m an outsider and say they are beyond expectations
Profit taking duh. It is obvious it would drop before close. \*sigh\*
Die spy!!!
I mean I’ve heard of selling naked but idk... I guess
Nio and li I invested 550 bucks man if I don't hit 558 then I lost 5 buck ain't much tbh but I wanna see nio and li hit the peak sell and be done
The more NIO dips, the better the discount on these money-making 11/20 60c
360 is just a line in the sand SPY, dont you worry
I love it but why is SPY dumpin so hard?
There are other stocks ?
Nio
See, posts like this piss me off! Why couldn’t you post this yesterday?! Now it’s too damn late!!
Short sellers gone ,back to $60 now
🥴

U win
Yaaaasssssssss Queen. Dump
Nio body gets it anymore man, I hear ya
why is NIO dropping? what the hell happened?
No. It's actually the perfect time rn
Can’t wait to close green so I can punch the air like usual

You know what stock has high option premium rn?
Ah forget that! You’ll get the moral satisfaction of paying for everybody else’s student loans through your taxes. It’s basically charity
500 is ten times better than 50
why is everything selling off?
What was announced? Why are we dumping?
Yeah unless you love this shit and spent a lot of time thinking and researching, you’re much better off being a passive investor.

It sounds like you’re too reckless and not curious enough for trading more complicated financial instruments.
Will PLTR hit 18.5 tomorrow?

Anyone know the historical data on the end of a lockup period on a direct listing? Is it usually a toss up or are there trends? Lockup ends the new year on PLTR and insiders are free to sell shares

Get in NIO now.
what happend
Because I'm retarded and this shit was moving too slow. Bought Spy calls. Hope it plays out.
I think everyone is buying puts rn lol
Fuck happened to NIO?
> iirc

Just went to investor relations. 11/30 after close
I have more faith than the insiders though.
Roger. Well maybe watch TLDR then. Carry on.
Looking at QQQ dark pools it’s not looking good, it’s 82% put flow, I would get out of NIO.
Wtf happened?
This was actually played last Friday. I was up a good chunk but held.. might as well hold through 
🤷🏻‍♂️🤚🏻💎✋🏻

Puts or calls
Incoming positive

Watching Nio fall is like that scene is mean girls where that guy calls his mom because he’s scared. I’m that guy.
If you have call options then yeah it’s kind of significant
fuck you BLNK, fuck you, you fuck!
Throw it in plug instead. Price of the stock dropped today because they’re offering more shares. FCEL did the same thing like a month ago, the price temporarily dropped and then was back up in a matter of days.
Skyrim was fine until you came along. Empire was nice and lazy.

Guys I found it, that’s the post, that’s why NIO dropped
Thanks Merrill edge for not letting me in and panic selling

I bought a 49$ put at the peak expiring 11/20. Hopefully I wake up happy
twas the right move
Dump of the week 😂 at least we know the big players are confident of earnings
Sold my calls at 11:48 that’s why
God damn - this is bullshit.
Please I'd be rich off my hedges
The real nightmare is NVIDIA beating the earnings and giving good guidance and stock going down .
Buy high sell low

wow sold at 1 30 trying to beat the profit takers and cant believe it worked out. someone stop me from parlaying my profits into a put spread
If you bought nio at 49, lol, Alexa play curb your enthusiasm
U holding through er?
NIO is a Chinese company idiots !
I think they mean an unhedged option but also they might just be retarded.
You guys never learn...

Cold War is pretty dogshit as far as Call of Duties go. It's probably gonna end up like BOII where everybody forgets about it quick.
Keep going I’m almost there 💦
My honest opinion is that you're an idiot... And you should definitely sell some more calls, to cover up your loss.

what could possibly go wrong?🤡🤔
Loading up on NIO puts

Here it goes.... This volume insane
I've got a handful of $2 leaps burning a hole in my pocket.
Get in bitch some pussies are selling the dip
Me and my box of cash will be under the bed for a few hours.  See y'all tomorrow.

„Did they bought the dip?...ok dump it eod!“
This dude has 10x my account value and is 3x as retarded. Life is truly unfair lol.
Looks like it was filled at the peak
Be careful y’all the curse of Donny tweet hasn’t failed yet
Oh shit bruh. I’m only down nearly a grand but apparently I shouldn’t be bitching lol.
Buying NIO under 50 is like buying TSLA when it was under 500 pre-split
Get your premium back and let everything else ride, if you're a scared little pussy.  


Otherwise just wait and see what the dark gods of China decide.
nio puts feel good rn until some AH nonsense happens and fucks everyone lol

She admitted what, exactly? And putting aside your dubious claim about admitting "it," do you really think it's smart to throw political opponents in jail over something like using a personal email address? That's how you get a coup. That's how you destabilize our democracy further. I agree that crimes should be prosecuted. But it's disingenuous to be faced with the severe wrongdoing of this administration and return with, "BUT HER EMAILS!!" They're not in the same ballpark.
That's why they are gay bears

Technically, a swim-risk.
What’s the historical data on the end of a direct listing lockup period? Any trends to follow or is it usually a toss up?
I think it’s December iirc
Not too big, really thought these lockdowns were going to make it jump and some big boys are starting to crowd into it. ARKK has bought it 5 of the last 7 trading days. Oh well, more disappointed than anything
You really thought it would hit 70 today?

Well... I mean, you can get like 10 bucks each back if you act fast?
No whammy’s
Why you gotta say that to him
Real question, does everyone here just say this because it appears to be overvalued? What are the fundamentals behind “ there’s no way it doesn’t tank “? Why are there median analyst projections putting NIO into the 150+ range?
There you go, they just priced in a bad earnings. Sell your puts now

PLTR 19$ Call 11/20 
Fukd?
Yeah I'm not worried about dying lmao, quarantining for 10 days sucks though
Why’d NIO have to go and do that
NIO can drop 50% tomorrow and still be up 1000% for the year boys.   NIO is done.
Imagine believing nio was going to crash. Ahahaha idiots
Puts or put???
Lmfaooo
F
GME but not options - the actual stock
NIO 500 eom
Mama I'm scared
I highly doubt the majority of the initial jump and subsequent drop was due to people looking into the practicality of Pfizer’s vaccine storage. I personally cashed out on my PFE call the day it popped. I’m guessing many people had the same idea of taking profit on good news, including PFE’s CEO and his planned selling. Others can always buy back in afterwards if they believe in MRNA in the long-term.
I sell em 😃

Looks like 3pm sell crew arrived.
Rolling contracts isn't a magical way to make the losses go away.

By rolling you are taking on more upfront risk.
 
If you expect big price movements you should close the position, not roll. If you expect the swing to be temporary then by all means roll.

Which one is this going to be?

I had a short (covered) 445c. I bought an extra 100 shares yesterday after hours at $452. 

I closed the position today at Market open for $2100 (was paid $1500 for it). Of course then the share price went down and would have sold it for $800 had I waited but I was worried the share is gonna continue rallying at open. My risk tolerance may be far lower than others though. Everyone is different.

Lesson learned for me to not hold calls when they are worth a fraction of what you got em for (could have closed yesterday for $90).

Best of luck to all and hope the share actually takes off.
If stock moves, short call would move more than spread. So if stock had went down, short call would have decreased in value more and he could make money more quickly vs spreads which move slower but have less risk exposure

Also, the shares he has is enough collateral for ibkr that he usually won't have to put up much extra. You'd have to consider the buying power impact of the trade too. Lots to think about, don't really want to type too much detail and make this a tldr
>allowed to talk about here that sounds like tit coin.

Yeah, I'm up meteorically too.  Good for you for not listening to the geezers here or on /r/investing.
BABA bag holders, how we feeling?
Wish I could apply for reimbursement for the student loans I actually paid off...
It is, ya piss

I'm banking on an after-hours sell off. I guess we'll see what happens.
Wtf just happened I left for 20 mins and everything dropped.
Drilling resumed
This is the best kind of diversification
ZM me and you could be chillin' but you playin'
gg no re
There’s news of soros planning to dump LMAO
u/savevideo
Hold forever.
Rockets land near US embassy in Iraq. SPY dropping
Did you buy?
Literally the flu’s older brother you’ll be fine :)
Ya'll think NIO's gonna pump to the moon or drill down to Satan?
Ah I see ok. Make sense. Keep rolling it
Hold puts overnight or yolo into a call
I could see it at least testing 460 again. Super flat today anyway so not too much of a loss. Best to just hold it I think. I’ve got a 465c myself.
Well I did buy as ass-ton of puts.
He lost 306
i bought puts minutes before the dip and sold them already for +40%
[deleted]
LOL, anyone else pick up some TSLA puts for super cheap?  11/20p $400

I'm gonna laugh my whole ass off if this prints tomorrow!
take your profit dude. this thing is unpredictable right now
I wanna get in but I'm scared
AAPLc 130 11/20 

don't believe me just watch <funky trumpet music plays>
2k on $KSS for me, if we’re comparing sizes now. And I didn’t have to shill some penny stock.
Is baba permanently stuck at -.5%??
Puts on NIO
BET PUSSY !!! U MESSING WITH THE CHAMP 

MY PUTS WILL PRINT ITS GAME TIMR
Where
Confirmed bearish on Russia. Puts on forex
Momentum just came back.
When NIO, XPEV, and LI all have the exact same chart movement it makes me glad I got out of the China EV game lol
Give me a yolo play to buy today for tomorrow
That’s why I shouldn’t have bragged about canceling the $48 sell limit order SMH holding forever now I guess

NIO 4 lyfe

I just broke up with my chinese gf NIO and got with HIMX
🤡🤡🤡
Yup
Do you have shares to cover it?
Shit i gotta get rid of these bags by next wed
Works 'til it doesn't
Holding puts. Stock is trash. Getting killed but I'm holding until 11/20 and 12/18 exp. The only reason it spiked is because Steve Weiss said he bought back in. I still think it's garbage.
won't IV shred me thou?
if you dont buy here u aint blaq
Big money. They are selling a shit ton, the same thing happened with RKT twice and it dumped after earnings. Why would the stock dump this much right before an earnings report?!?!??
Not used it but it doesn't get good reviews.
They should just sell to themselves to MSFT.
[deleted]
Thank you
I hate to say it...but...I'm inversing WSB on NIO. Every time I've bought in on the hype (especially around earnings) I get fuk.

Best of luck to all you call holders but I'm hoping for a sell off :O
NIO BEARS, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BUY PUTS. NIO AT $60 AT OPEN TOMORROW. WE FUCKING RIDE BOYZZZZZZZ
Shit. Didn’t even see that. Might have to pull out of my other contracts this week and then purchase on Friday. That might be the cheapest price. I appreciate the info
GET OUT OF NIO
congrats on your whole $200

The market gods accepted your sacrifice of health.
shaking out the toilet paper hands so real bulls can feast. OBV
dont do this
Not a put?
Lol!  Puts everything in perspective
It’s gonna be higher after earnings if it’s good  lmao
He didn't buy NIO. He's not on this sub.
Same
I want bear
I am about to look at NKLA and that bitch better be dumping too.
Sorry, you couldve just said "i dont actually have a big port". no need to lie
I have a few 😭
I think what satisfies me the most is when I scalp $20 off something volatile to justify getting takeout

Just made a quick $20 off of NIO puts in about 10 seconds, gonna buy some Chinese food 😎
[deleted]
Under Armour calls
You pussies better not shy away from sharing those NIO losses. I need them.
You'll be fine. Virus has a 99.5% survival rate
SPY puts? Let’s get this bread
Fuckin 8% drop directly at 3. Weak handed NIO bitches
Anybody else buy NIO puts an hour ago??
It is truly unfathomable almost 10k options of 11/20 80c NIO sold today.  Dunno what its like to hate money like that
Have 100 shares of NIO what can I do
That’s already announced. And priced in. Thanks.  It’s already known. This is not news.
Right...thats been known all week, why is it dropping like this four hours before the report drops.
Im seeing 3/17?
Please respect the sock on the door and do not barge in. NIO call holders currently getting fukt inside
25%
Another day another EV pump and dump.
NIO drops: “WHY WOULD ANYBODY TRUST THIS STOCK”

Nio moons: “WHY WOULDNT ANYBODY BUY THIS. FREE MONEY”
Holy
U bought legit at the top lol
I have heard many people say it will go up tho
Give it a few days before another stonk replaces it
MM shit too bad I didn't cash this in time. You sell the call one higher than yours for the same date. Then the next day you can buy the one you sold while simultaneously selling the one you bought. At leaast you'll know for the future.
Some boomer bought Nio at the top. 😂
did someone say NIO ?
Who....
what, what's NIO doing?
Thanksgiving is coming up.
They are identical, solely because they're both assumed to be of similar value. If NIO has low earnings, then that assumption is gone, and xpev is a higher valued company. That's not bias, thats just common sense
Any hope for Walmart 152.5 calls for next week? Bought this morning but after initial pump and been sinking all afternoon
557.5 isn't out of play.  If you care about saving a grand, take the pu$$y way out and close.  If it's chump change to you and you don't care, just let it go until the 26th and see what happens.

If you remain bullish on NVDA like you were when you originally opened this position, double down on that shit.
What’s wrong with making $150 before EOD? Might also be a good bet for parking $5000 for a few days. Look at the numbers.
800 strike is crazy
The question is, who’s loss? Bulls or bears

40% here bought an hr ago
Who else is playing TGT?

**BREAKING:** Cramer: "Jews Reclaim Israel - NIO falls 7%"
wow never mind tsla LOOK AT HOW ARKK is tracking NIO...HF they must be loaded to their moms t\^ts with NIO stock LMAO  
Cat out of the bag, buh bye ARKK
Just buy NIO after earnings. Why do you artists wanna risk it
Yes I think I will buy 1 NIO 80c 11/20 now
No
Volatile stock on a shady chinese company that just exists to liquidate its clients, all of that recommended by some WSB retard who advises buying FDs on it with a post full of caps and emotes.

... I'll look into it.
YEAHHHHH FUCKEN TANK NIO 

NOOBS GET FUCKED!!

KEEP TRUSTING GYNA SHIT!!!

Who is they fuckass
All you NIO bagholders on here aren’t selling, so this NIO dump is all the insider traders with info we don’t have getting out before the big red tomorrow
China gang baby.
Is he your wife’s boyfriend as well?
Yeah, which stock is it? It also depends on what your strike price is, most stocks don't recover that hugely if they don't have retard strength like NIO and TSLA
Damn that 3pm rug pull is wild
dang i bought puts on nio at 49+ and 10 minutes later it's down 2-3.
Your definition of crashing. Tarded.
I would recommend swapping that money to PLTR
lol log the fuck off your broker and go take a walk till 4
Under
11/27 WBA 41 or 42.
This type of dip has occurred before ERs before wherein it was followed by a massive AH spike. 

Then again cat could also be outta the bag lol.
Pltr was way below it’s estimate on earnings and nios is announced AH
[removed]
Bears are unaware of NIO's strength
This is the way.
If you have trouble figuring out whether you’re for or against buying nio puts, you aint black
5k in 6 months? Small street dude. Maybe you're new.
Pltr
buying back into PLTR obviously
DraftKings before close lets load tf up
Maybe post something other than just “BUY OPTT!” Also its a penny so...

Bought some calls for 2023 let’s go !
Does anyone just flip a coin to decide whether to buy puts or calls? Never steered me wrong
pltr drop?

turn ur head upsidedown fool
\+1 - too much run up pre-earnings, they will have to really beat or ....
BET MOTHERFUCKER 

IM ABOUT TO TEACH U A DOGGYSTYLE LESSON
NIO gonna announce international expansion plans and fuck all you noisy bears in the ass
Actually I think there are more suckers who bought RKT and have been averaging down since August. It's what makes both of them attractive to me
Ready to see everyone’s NIO loss after earnings
I thought 16% in a day was a pipe dream so i bought 18P 12/04 when it was like $18.15ish\~
lol sold some retard 70c... like it will go up 60%...
will a strangle on NIO atm expiring Friday be iv crushed?
If you sell options you’re cumming your pants rn
To the moon
NIO might actually end the day red  🤣🤣
If you aren't playing RIOT today, I don't know what you're doing with your life, and how you're not paying attention. Doubled my money today.
Holding? 😅
say no more. take my money.
Credit spreads are a better move
Hope you are joking, that is messed up, sorry.
*Alexa play crab rave* sold nio at the top and already up on puts

These nio $45 puts I bought an hr ago are really great lolol

yes, this is how options work retard
My NIO puts  are up 16% already
PDD at close. Buy that dip :)
No, but I also have no balls
[deleted]
I want to get off Mr.Bones' wild ride.
the only way the stock will continue to rise is if the shares that the investors/directors will dump in December get absorbed.  It's going to take insane volume to do that. 

With TSLA being added to the S&P an quad witching coming up next month. I don't think PLTR will continue to go up in the ballistic fashion it just did.

I rather wait for a 30-40% correction and buy the dip then chase a pump.
I really hope so. I went to take a shit and it dropped 3$

Was going to bitch out of NIO b4 earnings but my wife’s boyfriend advised me not to
buy the fucking NIO dip
NIO back to levels not seen since... 12:45 PM today
under or over $2000 ?
God dammit NIO, I was told you’d be worth a trillion by Friday.
I sold at 2pm and just saw that it dropped not long after also on my last day trade so I’m now bagholding plug
How does this effect XPEV?
Yes
NIO dip already being bought back up...can’t keep a good stock down
PLTR $30 by next month
Welcome to the club 😎
Keep doing this, Lord knows these degenerates need it
Probably fucked all of them too. Sadly some of them gave us aids.

Alexa, play crab rave
Do it pussy
leave here immediately
Nio won't close  - ve and it'll be status quo in a few days. It'll be on track for 100 by march. Its just standard turbulence of the market
Huh $ROPE is cheap right now
There is a factor of oversimplification in my example as most folks are not genetic engineers but the fact remains that the spike protein is not a free floating protein in nature. it is part of the protein coat of the cov2 virus. The chances are low but there is a chance of it getting incorporated into the protein coat of a newly minted virus. The HIV virus is in a different family than Coronavirus so the chance is less but there are other endemic viruses much more closely related to coronaviruses where the chance of crossover is there. And even if the risk is really low its still additional risk as compared to simply injecting the spike protein directly.
I’ve got the hookup. But for real, 5 min charts they’ve been swinging the same direction. NIO is just more volatile. Ignoring the otherworldly gap up from TSLA this morning obv
NIO call holders filing for bankruptcy
NIO bulls !
Insiders dumping NIO
You hate money.
There isn’t even a number to describe how high this stock will go.
Yeah its all the autists in here lol
NIO put printing🤡
Good luck
How do you know this? I have heard so many people say the opposite
I think our china friends like selling itm/atm calls and then dumping so they can hang onto their shares.
NIO 69$ EOW
Classic pump and dump before earnings get baited
wild to watch. I'm on the sidelines but enjoying the show.
Fake and gay early fade is the most bullish indicator there is. 370s tomorrow confirmed.
What the fuck happened today, pltr and NIO just dropping like flies
Let’s get this money boys
If i could I would
See what I mean
How good is this company? How much potential you think it has?
Fuck this support level

Break through it!!
wu wu wu wu wu
why goldman cutting jobs

i thought economy real gud
I just did. Godspeed
No?
Yes especially PUTS. If you play long PUTS ahead of an IV crush like OP said then you are guaranteed to lose money. I don't think OP understands what that means.
Holding these nio puts fuck it! This is why we are here boys and girls. It’s going to be a fun AH
$NIO please don't hurt me like this. Hold the fucking line boys, we believe in NIO STRENGTH!

Hey can LU stop tanking, it’s wiping out my tendies for the day
No idea where the fucking bottom on it is. A few days ago I would have said absolutely.

After 7 red days in a row and blood streaming from my asshole, all I can muster is a half hearted maybe.
Sold my nio calls and shares and just dropped some fat puts. Lets see if this comment ages well
It might actually work out in your favor
😉
if u didnt sell at open, might as well hold
That sentence escalated quickly. Thought it was going to be about number infected.
it’ll fall dont fomo

What is the probability of someone that has had both doses of vaccine getting infected if a person with an active case sneezes down their throat? 

That’s the important number in my mind.
Unusual volume on the NIO 12/18 **75c**
Everything dipping? What’s the news?
If I’m holding call options and it hasn’t expired yet but it’s basically worthless now, would I be able to recover some losses if the stock decides to run before my options expire?
Somebody knows the earnings aren't worth the valuation, so they dump their bags on the run up
that was spectacular
But why? They aren’t doing anything crazy asap
Hot
I sold put spreads.



At $53/52...
#😅 Thanks
Do I hold or sell TSLA 465c 11/20
Jesus this sub is unbearable these days. There must be a Discord or a sub dedicated to NIO can’t you guys be retarded there?
Never ever buy puts but I finally did on this shit at 18P 12/04/2020 fall into the sea damnit. Breakeven is 16.97
Here come the therapists
and why is that?
Hes pulling out some capitol to buy into parler.lol
NIO is gonna crash stocktwits
 If you value money, load up on nio puts.
Your hedge fund about to go broke
 satan himself shorted NIO all the way to the hell
Its called a pump n dump
Got out with $640 in gains. So tell me why I am staring at NIO wanting to jump back in again. Am I regretting selling? Idk. It should fall after earnings yeah?
so puts on NIO or what's the move?
I’m waiting until tomorrow to buy any more options. Lol @ 230% IV
Nws Nio will present chinese numbers. If you don't buy now, you literally hate money.
[deleted]
I'm bullish Nio longterm, but this volume and dip recovery is pure FOMO. I'm out, but I hope (and believe) the earnings will work well for you crazies. Good luck.
NIO NIO
IV is at 250%. An ATM Nov 20 call is priced at $4. So I'd say at least by $3 to break even.
Bear trap
This thing is the next LK. Going to 20 end of week
Someone knows something and decided to not play earnings anymore
Get out of your TSLA puts, unbelievable bounce right here
hELP Me Turn $100 into $1,000 suggestions???
Cause the people with actual money know things we plebs don’t

Think nio is gonna rocket in ah?
Lmao!
taking a shit bigly. Moved away from this yesterday after the pump.
NIO trying to go the Kingda Ka route.
dont tell these fools here about it... shhhhhhhh
Ye
For the first time in history I have officially sold at the top of a major drop. Sold my NIO $50 calls right at $49.
NIO reminds me of my uncle at Thanksgiving, he'll always touch me under the table but is too scared to go all the way
i did the call, managed to just catch the bottom. see how we go lol

‘Earnings’
Jesus christ dude. Dont end yourself. Everything will hopefully be straightened out. 🙏😞
I heard nio only sold 14 cars in all of October and this far in November (14 total) cant find a source so maybe people are talking out of their ass.
No one will care about Donnie. Let’s see what joe will say.
If you don’t launch 🚀 your ain’t Iraqi.😂

I sold my 11/20 calls basically right at $54.  Got scared and went for it.  Was trying to chase it higher but the trade went through before I could submit.  Felt like a complete genius and now I'm hiding under the bed with my box of cash waiting for something else exciting.  Hoping PLTR doesn't fuck me too hard
That nio iv is nuts... You guys are nuts buying options
If you value money. Load up on nio calls

Perfect entry point for NIO, this is going way past 50 after earnings!
[deleted]
Watch her bounce back now and fly through 50 AH.  She a bad bitch.
[deleted]
Porn and stonks baby
How are you up 10% on PLTR puts
> and idiot

I don't know what to say
wtf u talking about their charts today look nothing similar. where u get ur drugs from?
If you put all that money in $SPY 4 years ago you’d be up $150k. GUH
stocks? shares? just hold lol
Sold at the top for nio
I hope you're right. I have 2x 18.5p for 11/20 bought at the top today. Small peepee gains but gains nonetheless
Sell off before earnings
I'm not defending Trump. Yes everyone using a personal email to do Federal business is a felon. I was a Federal employee for 10 years. We had to take training courses about this exact subject every year. We also had regular audits that we had to submit to where our devices were checked. It is taken VERY seriously.

>Again, no evidence of any wrongdoing.

She admitted it on TV, retard. If you go on TV and admit you committed a felony and there is also evidence that substantiates your admission, you should be put on trial. Simple as that. Anyone that thinks otherwise is a partisan hack. Again, the mental gymnastics on this sub are unreal.
Could be wrong but I believe at least $10 to the upside. Too risky for my blood.
It wasn't just NIO - literally everything in my portfolio dipped at the same time - even random solar plays. Must be algos dumping on some news.
Is PLTR gunna pump tmo?
You fool!
Im in
Screw it buying more NIO calls
I have calls and this is the funniest thing I’ve read all day
Hey retard nobody cares, move along and collect your winnings or not.
730pm Est
MY HEDGE FUND IS SHORTING NIO !!!

It’s over noobs 

Lesson time
If u just sold u did good son
Isn't that big weed growing country?  VFF mooning today near a 52 week high.  Getting higher. :)
I’m right here
This 💯
What means yolo
Good luck
He’s right you know
Everybody here should be obligated to buy the robinhood IPO.

Some much volume on NIO
is MACD MacDonalds?
WELL I GUESS IM HOLDING THROUGH EARNINGS NOW
[deleted]
Thoughts on my PLUG 11/20c's? Sweating a little here
AMZN’s chart is painful to look at right now
seems like bulls tried a last hope push but gay bears are back controlling the ship
You're not trading. Traders have stop losses and take smaller percentage gains. You're just buying and holding
N shape
No memes what actually just happened to nio? How does a stock crash like that with 0 news
tsla puts?
Hold ground men!!!
Im making money on my PLTR calls, but losing on my QQQ calls. To be up like 3% today instead of the 40 or 50 if I was in PLTR alone 😤
Saw it in cinemas. Had forgotten about it until now. Good shit.
#NIOSTREETBETS
Nio is still green. Unless you bought at the absolute top you’re still green. 

Bears taking an early victory lap about to get slapped back down.
Stay out
Am I the only one that uses reddit for porn?
Poor, poor bastard.
200
For the day, Im currently up 10.77% on PLTR shares, 10% on PLTR puts, and 26.3% on PLTR calls
Bought NIO 11/20 40p at 2pm, went to sell during the drop and realized I had no day trades left 😭😂
If you're not in RIOT, you're playing yourself. How many times have we seen these tech stocks carry momentum into insane prices?
Today reminds me of just pre-covid in late Jan early Feb. Need some more adderall
same here. puts at the top
Something to do with Iran?
[deleted]
It’s days like this I’m glad I got no settled funds. That nio dip would have bankrupted me
[deleted]
I feel uneasy after selling my NIO calls, they've been propping the rest of my portfolio singlehandedly for a month now
Everyone bailing before earnings. Too high risk.
nice sold my puts at 49s before the plunge rofl... sigh
To everyone that sold on the nio dip congratulations you’re an idiot!!!
Jack ma needed to rest for a bit
Buy CCL 17 11/20 puts thank me later
CCP said they don’t need BABA anymore when Nio is numba won.
And that’s why you don’t trade with your own money 😂😂😂
What time does NIO release earnings
Got 2 year calls on them. 51% return as of this moment.  Before the event drop we just had it qas a 65% gain.
Knees weak arms are heavy
Sorry, my sibling follows my account. I’m not going to post the majority of my net for him to see.
hopefully you exited in time. My puts printed 💰
If your bullish on nio I have no idea what to tell u
 wtf is happening with RIOT
What the fuck happened to a 12k support level for the gaydaq? I’m sure that’s a pretty special number just like 11k fucking retard algos.
If this doesnt limit down right now! THIS WHOLE FUCKIN MARKET IS *RIGGED* !!!!!
Lol just scalped 20% gains on NIO puts. I love obvious free money plays
Same
Anybody that is going to 💎🖐🏼 NIO into earnings deserves every dime if they hit
this is LITERALLY ILLEGAL I HATE THE SEC
Spy power hour drill let's GOOOOOO
Hop off the NIO train and come save your BABA brothers
PLTR In bois
Just a quick sack stretching before it slingshots to another universe
So many people are gonna FOMO into NIO after earnings
Did NIO already report or something?
[deleted]
too late hahaha
Ban
💎🙌 on Nio will be rewarded. Don’t get shaken out.
MM’s shaking out weak hands before NIO earnings?
Put that on? What strikes you looking at partner.
Or manipulating for better entry
Is this NIO street bets?
LMAO NIO
20%
Wtf NIO took my student loan money
My balls are sweating
Can TSLA and NIO stop moving in sync. Like literally all day. Just stop
Bruh I look away for 5 min and NIO just takes the fattest dump
Half of these people making fun of nio have TSLA calls 30% down from this morning
Welcome, my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been?
It's alright, we know where you've been
well i bought more
Sold puts at open, and just bought more lol
Some little war way across the world maybe getting started, won’t affect our stocks
the way they let BABA drop to $260 bro
Since you already identified the bias, you would think you would already figured out this is due to your gambling addiction... you are using two different forms of logic to rationalize one bias...

When it fits your bias, they are identical - "when one goes up, the other will go up."

When it doesn't fit your bias, they are no longer identical - "when one goes down, the other one will still go up."

So which is it? Are they identical or not identical?
I am The Palantir. 🗿
Thanks dudes. Just sold 3 contracts to cover my cost basis, still have 2 open but they dont expire until February 19th - gonna hold and see what happens
Tesla 500 11/20 let’s fucking go
Probably Institutions lockin profit.
classic
And that kids is why I don't touch Gyna.
I have 580 shares at $36 buy in so please explain how. I would love to hear.
Ever seen the movie Minority Report?
Nio is a fucking roller coaster. Some shit right out of Six Flags.
Bought around the split, still sitting on 50 shares waiting for them to get back to 124
It’s bouncing back
haha ok. This time tomorrow remind me. I could be wrong. If so I will say so.
I'm gonna lose it
lol hope you bought that nio dip
Up
Daddy Xi taking Nio out behind the woodshed.
Based if true
WTF NIO?

I took profit at 46 (was holding this mofo for some time). 

Worth to buy some b4 ER? Or this thing is going to be sell the news big?
NIO mooning!
[deleted]
65??? wtf ??
Might be the first time I timed something right. Sold my NIO calls at 48.80, bought puts at 49.15
I got ccl -_-
WEAK HANDS OF NIO,

YOU ARE SIMPLY VICTIMS OF THIS CHARADE
RIOT TO THE Moonn..
BA puts for next week free money
Big data that's cheap for now..
crazy how the the largest transfer of wealth between US and China is NIO
I cannot wait to see what happens with NIO tonight and into tomorrow. Gain, Loss, we gonna have some fun guys - it is about the journey not the destination
You’re good homie, it’ll bounce back
it wasn’t his FAULT
Stay cool homie they are trying to scare you
Except ya know when it's weeklies and Tesla has been getting hammered
Pop up or pop down?
Jesus fuck the volume on NIO,
It’s bouncing off the bottom
Citron? Is it you again??
Lol sold a 11/20 40c for at $10 when i paid $8 for it. Just before the dip. Still have some calls for tomorrow, but I can at least say I made something.
I cast ye to hell BABA!
wtf is this volatility lol
Fuck xpev didn't pump with NIO but now it's dropping with it
Hold Nio calls through earnings? How much would the stock need to rise for the IV crush to be worth it?
Just a guess based on how PayPal and Square have had some green days, SHOP looks like it’s lagging behind but may follow suit soon, open interest and volume for the $960 call for Friday has good volume, and overall, there’s majority calls on shop.
i thought we was going to $20
Bro what is up with FSR
God, you should be ashamed of yourself for misinterpreting the numbers so fucking poorly.
KNDI put? What's a good play?
CCL slow bleeding, puts gonna print tomorrow
Did I cause that NIO dip? I just sold my fractional share for $16.73
[removed]
Is 2 weeks long?
Speaking of vaccines and optimism, buy $M calls for earnings on 11/19 ;)
NIO bears: "someone call an ambulance"  
NIO: "but not for me"  🔫
here comes the dump uo uouooooo here comes the dump

&#x200B;

"THe shittles"
That drop wiped out 2.5 hours of gains in 10 minutes.
Lmao so big boys got the earnings report early?
And why doesn this make it a string buy? 😈
Omnggf
Can you elaborate on waiting until expiration to exercise? Holding until expiration means theta eating at you, right? As long as it's ITM, though, it's not to worry about? If you can't tell, I'm a retard who just recently got into options. Thanks for any help.
$ROPE
ayeeeeeee haha. For the crazies willing to hold. not me man. not me. I ain't fucking with this. IV is stupid,
Lol
my imagination isn't even letting me have it
sold a few for tendies. will buy on dip
Looking at the technicals (MACD, RSI) , PLTR looks like it’s gonna pop soon. But technicals are a bunch of horseshite most the time so
Holy fuckkkk
Totally healthy market yo

PUTS!
Everyone hit my Nio, can we do pltr next so I can get in on another meme stock?
Narrator: It didn't.
Sir look at the chart
dont do that
Not sarcastic at all. They are gaining market share and making a profit while hotels get decimated and hotel booking websites try to desperately copy them

It’s a really strong position to be in

I’ve also been trying out the Experiences and they’re really good especially while people are bored at home
Earnings today
F u
The exact same thing happened when PLTR was reporting earnings after close, it tanked 8% only to rally when it's earnings were released. People are just shorting it because holding over earnings has become almost a guaranteed loss.
[deleted]
Barely
NIO giving everyone so many entry points. Truly the best most considerate stock. Customer service 10/10
Earnings report tonight.
Can’t go to the casino, could catch COVID.  Safer to place your bet on NIO

Don't worry guys, NIO just having it's first healthy pull back of the day 😂
Sorry guys just had to sell my 500,000 shares of NIO
Spy gonna go back to 350 or so? seems likely...
who hit the market panic sell button?!
Had a word with Ivan A. regarding your language. Expect his secretary will be in touch tomorrow.
lol what a roller coaster ride for EV ADRs
watch NIO recover by EOD. I will never trade again if NIO breaks $49 by EOD not AH
this NIO dip is free money I feel like we should be $60 eod
NIO 11/20 $20P's are trading up.
You really think China is letting nio drop below 44?
[deleted]
Haha he mad y’all
and now nio goes back uop right as i sell. this is fucking fucked game.
oh wait LOL
check again lol
Don't you hate when you could've sold a position when it was just barely in the green but now it's just sitting in your portfolio down 90% because you were too greedy to sell
Bear trizzap
NIO WHAT IS U DOIN
It’s funny when the media gives him positive attention for his investments. The guy is the devil incarnate. 😂
Yes we’re okay.
What the fuck NIO
If I’m holding call options and it hasn’t expired yet but it’s basically worthless now, would I be able to recover some losses if the stock decides to run before my options expire?
and NIO says SIKE
Well, you fuckers broke it.
I want off this rollercoaster
Buying the dip
Keep going I’m almost there😫😫💦💦
What’s so great about PLTR anyways?
whats the consensus on NVDA earnings?

Ride wave NIO brossss🏄🏻‍♂️

I'm so fucking mad about this, I was hovering over the button and I got greedy then it plummeted in seconds
Eh I'll feel bad for you when it hits 59 eow.
Nobody tell him lmao
Oh man that’s right
People dumping before earnings is all
EV stonks dumping together. Did Biden concede the election to Trump?

Real talk should I hold these NIO puts through today
>mRNA vaccines are just too dangerous which is why the technology has been stuck for 10 years.

That's not true, the technology wasn't available previously.  


>Say the cell we are taking over already is infected with HIV. The cell factories are busy turning out copies of HIV. Now we infect it with the mRNA and it starts producing spike proteins 

Ignoring the fact that mRNA-mRNA fusions don't really happen, the mRNA being transfected into the cells is so heavily modified your body wouldn't have the machinery to perform it. You're also dealing with an extremely unlikely scenario where an HIV positive cell is the one that gets transfected with mRNA.  


>What if the immune system instead of creating immunity to the spike protein creates immunity to our own cells. 

Why would it do that? What difference does it make if the cell is secreting (yes, the cell doesn't have the spike protein attached to it) a spike protein or not? It looks like a regular cell to your immune system. Self-immunity does happen like you mentioned with autoimmune diseases, but secretion of a spike protein won't change that.  


What's your background, if you don't mind me asking?
I can’t even make fun of Nio Tesla is absolutely crushing me
What is happening, why’s it doing this?
Fed dump

same here, feels good man
Bought puts no way this overvalued piece of shit company does anything revolutionary this quarter lol
My only regret is buying NIO puts at 48.50 and not 49.20 just 30 minutes and I woulda had a better entry o well still up 2k
looks like the algos are on sell mode
You have paid your tuition fee for the options school. Now make more money and this time do the opposite of what you were doing.
Lol. No only NIO
nio just lost 7% faster than it takes me to drop a deuce

Getting ready to moon 📈🚀🚀 after hours
THANK GOD I SOLD MY NIO CALLS AT $49.20 IN NIO! HOLY FUCK!
Started trading 2 weeks ago and that’s the only way I’ve been doing it
Dad?
There has gotta be atleast one autist on WSB who is gonna commit $ROPE
🤡🤡🤡
You bastards were supposed to hold ahhhhhhh
Aaannnddd dumped
I will buy CVS again at the bottom if i get lucky, when amzn bought pillpack the hit on cvs lasted a few days. This same thing is likely to happen here before people realize that old folks actually will not use AMZN over their pharmacist and it will resume its climb. Remember CVS will distribute Covid vaccine and already rules Flu vaccinating.
Straddle holder here as well. Not sweating anything.

Buy PLTR dip you fagggots
Lmao bought a 50$ put at the peak!
NIO gang. Are you alive?
Liquidated my entire position on Friday, like a pussy. But I made $25k profit, so I'm only a little retarded.
DIE CCL
NIO being manipulated pretty hard core right. Glad I didn't fomo into that shit.
Buy MO instead.
hey guys guess where i decided to go all in on NIO?
Anything happen or just a pre-close dump?
Even though I got caught in it, it's still fucking hilarious.
Jesus i KNEW it was your fault!
WHAT THE FUCK NIO
What about atm puts?
The oral and nasal vaccines are also targeting Mucosal immunity (via the intestine lining and nasal lining) which is a different mechanism than the B Cell and T cell immunity being targeted by the other vaccines so VXRT and ALT vaccines may have a play as an additional vaccine. As the COV2 virus first grows in the nose before moving down to the lungs if the nasal mucus can kill the virus than it never gets a chance to move to the lungs and cause the fatal complications.
Wtf is going on everything just took a hit
[deleted]
well NIO is dead what the next one we killing gang? PLTR ?
relax guys nio is just springing down for a earnings 🚀
God damn all of EV is getting trashed
If you sell right now, you’re a legit autist. Hold the line.
Saw NIO drilling and thought it was my portfolio, thank God I'm not THAT retarded
LAST CHANCE TO LOAD UP ON NIO CALLS. THANK ME LATER
[deleted]
Wait when did NIO hit $49 I looked away for 5 minutes lol
holy shit what is this drill lol, i sold when it was up 5-6% ish
FROM THE TOP ROPE
Well that’s a retarded move.
Those who had NIO puts please show me your gains!
so uber is at all-time highs during a global pandemic while cases are peaking and the company is losing a shit ton of money. Even with vaccines, they won't be making profits till the end of 2021/ early 2022.

This is even worse for Lyft, because at least Uber has Ubereats.

I aint sellin bitch suck my 💎 cock

Holy shit, absolute great timing on that Nio sell. Knew some fuckery was gonna go on because of earnings
11/27 44 c and 12/4 47c
Kandi is still. Currently ** up 22% even after losing a bit.  My calls are still up 51% from today alone.
You just saved me like 3k
NIO profit taking..

What are you scared to hold NIO through earnings 🤣🤣🤣
Lmfaoo holy shit that NIO end of day dumpp 🤡😅🤡
I have 100 shares in a Roth of NIO and kinda don’t care what happens. A beyond meats type after hours beating would be the best thing for memes, though
So close some stores and then figure out how to make an online presence... doesn’t sound like much of a plan.
Ok say goodbye to NIO and PLTR, and say hi to HUYA
DAHMP ET
Nio is such a meme stock
[deleted]
Dump before earnings means its gonna moon
#power hour
never seen anything like this, can't believe I managed to sell my calls at $49
My only regret is not buying more puts
NIO bear trap
Does your algo run around the clock?
I like it
Make 6k today Sold at 48.17 been a good run
#I FINALLY MADE A GOOD DECISION
hold through earnings if you have balls. if you are smart, sell when you are happy with profits
Imagine making a call or put and having it actually go your way
ITS BATTERY DAY
Stop loss brudda
I bought at 48. Sold at 53 tho
IV crush gonna kill you tomorrow.
buy the dip on nio free money

NIO is done for. People taking profits. They know it won't hold. BYE BYE BULLS
Falling knife 🔪
Nio jumping off a fucking building. Jesus
If the prices get low enough I might scalp a monthly NIO for a couple hundred just to see what it’s like to light money on fire
Is this even real? How can a stock drop so fast and so much
Y'all understand to inverse WSB every time right?
communist nio getting whipped ahhaha
[deleted]
NIO LOL
lol these pump and dumps
Bruh how’d that even happen?

WHAT EVEN CAUSES THIS????
Don't worry NIO holders, if $40 doesn't hold, you get to buy more at $20.
hahaha NIO diving is making me rich
Smart move.
Wait is that true
Gme will never hit $15 again at this rate, quite sad really
So, apple is going to trade flat for the rest of the fucking year? Cool cool cool.
THEY are
If I was a gambling man I'd be buying NIO straddles. It will either get pumped to the moon or crash down to the earth.
[removed]
Buy more. It will go back up after earnings.
Fall CCL!
I mean if you have a leap you should definitely hold.
these are not ideal QQQ moves
How do you say “GUH” in Mandarin?
NIO WEAK , PLTR STRONK
Smh tesla
Have I lost money on TSLA today? Yes. Do I think it will do something crazy AH for old times sake? Yes. Will it actually though? No. 🤡

Is China already nationalizing their EV companies?
You waited until one hour before close the day of earnings to buy?!?
How low can you go!
Liberal cuck
BYE NIO
NIO 40p went from $1 to $1.60 in 10 minutes - not too late to hedge if you are planning on riding thru ER.
Bruh me too just g0t in this shit better not!!!
Nio was holding spy up all day
If there was an award, you would win.
Mfw I wanted to short nio half hour before close
Say sike rn
Damn that's quite a fall from grace
Let’s go DKNG!!

Bye bye NIO HAHAHAH
HO LEE FUK
That's gotta be the biggest red dildo I've seen in a while.
Apes together strong
down another xD
If NIO drills 20% maybe i’ll buy one share
You would choose puts that are lower than the current price because they're bidding the stock to go down
Oh God I was so green. Then nio happened and now I'm so red. Lol.
Bye Nio nice knowing you
Don’t hold through NIO earnings you’re gonna get fucked
NIO PUTS BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. IM GHAYYYYYYYYYEYYYYY
Can we buy calls on drone strikes? Can't wait for the payouts from white obama

Hindsight 2020™
nobody wants to hold through earnings. everyone playing the run up and getting out with their money.
I bought Nio calls at the perfect time!!
oh shit we going blood red bois
adioooooooooooooos
Get to the choppa
Gyna is taking profit
Nios going to the fucking basement for earnings.  
Y'all call holders got fucking played.
How we feeling about blink
Watch out, earnings coming on the 19th.
Holy shit nio hahahaha
You see Nio, you can’t be dead. Because the oracle told me that I’ll fall in love with the one. Now get up!
I'm sure at least one of you NIO kids went to take a shit and are now just looking at the chart. RIP
Anyone else playing DKNG options?
NIO said fuck your gains
$5.50*
NIO chinese'd you guys damn
Buy the dip?
Everyone jumping ship before earnings on nio
Its all those people who are securing profits since they are too pussy to hold through earnings
10x I’m also doing that, NOV27 $15p only $290 for an insurance policy
Strike?
[deleted]
Ban
Buy NIO calls or nah?
So what do I with my nio?
this is just a warning that you shouldn't be holding NIO through earnings, regardless if you have calls or puts. Just put it on black at your local casino
Weird
That makes as much sense as all electric vehicle stocks mooning so why not
AND IM FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, FREE FALLIN
NIO AND SOLO OH GOD OH FUCK OH SHIT
This theory is partial. You're not wrong but you're not right either; this is only true in stocks where there is abnormal amounts of interest. If the volume of a stock is normally 40% of what it is around earnings then yes, absolutely, that drop is expected but in the case where all things are even and calm, say, a low-key stock that does well it just follows the normal logic and goes up all over with no IV crush or sudden sell-offs.

So, to complete your paradox: The more popular the company the more at risk earnings drops are.
Some tard said DOW hitting 40K next year. 🤡
looks like earnings were leaked lol
Ur fukt
How are you figuring this? I need some hope as my SHOP options have been bleeding for 2 weeks now.
Same hahahhaaha 😅
All of you abandoning NIOs sinking ship, PLTR is waiting with open arms.

Come get the tendies.
Cant tell if this is sarcastic, but it genuinely is doing well despite the pandemic and I can’t expect it’ll do worse after, great long term pickup
How those NIO Calls doing ?
NOK almost never moves. Has anyone made money on that stock in the last decade?
lol sold my put at the very bottom... sigh I am great at timing lol
Why is LULU up. Lol
Would you rather lose money and think back on how obvious it was to sell or slap yourself with your new wad of cash for how obvious it was you should’ve held?
I just refreshed my weather app and was like, "hell yeah, it went up!"...then I was like, "wait, do I have a postion?"
RIP NIObois

Wow
Lmfaoo
Holy moly all Chinese EV took a big hit
Closing below 360 to drop another 3% tomorrow.
Take your money out of Nio and put it on Target. You know my girl will beat earnings BIGLY
Is NIO trying to find earths core??🤔
time to buy more!
Which one of you bought calls when NIO hit 49.37?

WHO WAS IT???  

***SHOW YOURSELF***
Totally agree with you - once I close a few of my other plays, I am putting more in DKNG
Wtf
how the fuck does that happen
we might have another WSB extinction level event.
My butt was fucked until there was no butt left for fuckin
Hahahaha this sub gonna get rekt by nio, fucking retards

[deleted]
NIO 11/20 50c holders are in shambles

I bought that Nio peak and instantly lost a shit ton of money. I hate this game.
Pre earnings report jitters. Just buy more.

War baby
So NIO is like the day trader's wet dream?
Same!  Hold your head high, timed that perfectly
Just felt the timing was a bit suspicious
Well done for securing that profit!
NIO LOL
WSB loses it all again
Puts look like an obvious play for tomorrow which means calls will print.
Sell retard
NO NIO YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING BALANCE TO THE FORCE NOT LEAVE IT IN DARKNESSSAS
I quadrupled my calls in them, does that answer your question?
Good timing, congrats

Lost my money on Tesla calls so I didn’t even have a chance to double retard on NIO calls.

Ah yes, how to double your losses on 300% IV

Sold my NIO puts. I’m keeping 1 put through earnings just to see what happens.
Bought them on 11/11. It’s terrible! I thought it would go up from there. Expiry is March so I’m not sure if I should sell. Maybe it will recover? 🤔

Palantir is to data what Salesforce is to customers

Benefits, any large enough company could see amazing returns by leveraging their under utilized data sets. Cons, this limits the customer base to only large corporations which have the budget and data to make it worth while. Pros, they have lots of government contracts which will continue to get renewed at growing rates.

Again, no evidence of any wrongdoing. The prosecutors didn't pursue the administrator who deleted files because he cooperated and provided the prosecutors with what they needed. And there's no evidence that Clinton was involved in any way with server management, much less even knew that old files were being deleted.

As for "the China connection," it's not "speculative," it's nonsense fabricated from whole cloth. 

Finally, this is all a nonsense distraction. Six Trump officials, at a minimum, have used personal email for government business. Are they all felons?

https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/352384-six-trump-officials-used-personal-email-accounts-for-white-house

This Clinton email thing was stupid to begin with and nothing ever came of it. Meanwhile, how many Trump officials are in jail or pardoned for their crimes? How many corrupt and fraudulent businesses and fake charities owned by Trump have been censured and otherwise penalized? The level of fraud and criminal activity in this administration, not to even mention unchecked conflicts of interest, is staggering. 

You're comparing using personal email with truly heinous abuses of power. Give me a fucking break.
They just did Binances monthly volume in a day. RIP to you

>  Random mutations do happen especially when creating proteins and viruses foreign to our system. Say randomly a copy of the HIV virus gets created with the COV2 spike protein attached.

This is complete nonsense, for example.   Mutations are minor copying mistakes like "I slightly undercooked the steak by a few degrees", but you're suggesting "I meant to make steak and ice cream for dessert but instead I served frozen steak on top of a pie.  Ooopsie!"  That's actually more feasible than what you're suggesting.

LDOS 2/19/21 115c is a good bet, likely profitable imo. This stock is recovering big time and will continue to recover. Military Defense + tech + some healthcare. Also bullish on raytheon.

Quick note: I've heard horror stories of RH handling the hour before expiration in a bad way, so I personally will exercise or close the option on my own 90 minutes before expiration.

I look at this play in the same mindset as playing weed stocks. As more and more states legalize online sports betting these guys are just bolting on more and more customers. I think we are relatively early in a multi year expansion here so I continue to add here nd there
Selling Nio calls
It’s not because they think the stock will go down. They are selling because they don’t agree with the business practice
same :')
Bought puts at the top too
OH GOD NIO tanking 😭

Are you expecting some giant movement based off of killer earnings? its run up so much that if you have any short term options you are screwed on IV if you hold and it happens to go up a little more. How much room does it have to keep going in the short term? Take some profit.

Disclaimer: Nio Bear
If you're long term investing hold. IF you're short term sell lol.

so you are selling already? thats the opposite of what I am doing.  shits going parabolic, time to find a new ath

If PLTR can close and hold over 18 today, i promise i won't be a naughty day trader anymore
My RH app won’t open wtf
From my POV, The company isn’t PC to most people, CEO’s politics ... basically everything the CNN Article said. BUT CNN is a liberal news source , they have to say those things when reporting for their audience. And luckily, markets don’t give a shit about that kind of thing. This is my opinion though

This is not the way, buy high, sell low
If my account wasn’t locked for margin call I would be buying more today
As long as NIO stays above 42, I will be happy
Nice buying power, you must be new here
Jesus fuck NIO why are you like this
What's diversification mean?
lost all my gains.

Why is life like this?
Dang I sold Nio at 48.5, 49 looking like the top for now. Pretty sure earnings will crush the stock for a bit
Don’t tease me
This is too retarded even by WSB standards

Busting out my $18 PLTR hat again 🎩
Anyone buying PLTR on a +10% day is a a fuckin moron. Double moron if you're paying for vol rn. Expect a tank day sometime in the next week when IPO investors unload. I've been in shares since IPO for the long game so doesn't matter to me, but it should be pretty obvious at this point that FOMO into a WSB hype stock is a guaranteed way to lose. I'll be buying your shares next week for <$14 nerds
AAL is such a laggard compared to UAL and DAL.
PTON calls look expensive. Am I missing something?
You guys buying DKNG? This is looking like 50+ this time next week.
Details?
Knights of PLTR we shalt reclaim 18 lmao
This is why you print out your account information before this happens  and contact robinhood.   So everyone print their account info out and file it somewhere. No filing cabinet? Go get a folder 📂
Just bought 1 contract each of NIO 80c 11/20 and 30p 11/20 about an hour ago just for the lulz, and they are both currently up 10%. #justniothings

depends on the broker. some automatically will do the best outcome for you an hour before expiration (e.g. Robinhood). If they can't (like Robinhood), then you are SOL, and should've done it manually. others, it's on you to do all the work.

This is actually interesting, if they are correlated, you can benefit from lower options prices by trading xpev off of NIO earnings.
Same playing nio puts lmao YOLO
Specifics?
It's going to be really meta to buy robinhood on robinhood using margin borrowed from robinhood
Needs more scuba tank.
I'm hoping it pumps up before 4 and I'm going to cut my losses and sell, but I am fucking retarded.

Sometimes you just gotta spend the money to feel the funny

You’re telling me piece of shit Monsanto Soros thinks it’s unethical? Fucking bullish let’s go to the moon


This mf is the king of being tied to unethical business practice despite his facade of being a progressive SJW. Besides, Karp of Palantir seems to be a less radical and morally skewed version of soros and I trust him much more.

Sometimes I wonder how I make money in this market. It’s not pretty but it happens
Would I be retarded holding NIO calls up 200% through earnings?
Give it a couple days bro. It’s uncertain if the market will react to Covid lockdowns , if it doesn’t then Tesla will be in the clear to hit $500

NIO will reward those who’s faith does not waiver. NIO is the true King of the Memes. TSLA is a false prophet, succumbing to a S&P holding, ensuring that tighter regulations will be put in place to make sure it doesn’t tank the market. But NIO? A Chinese stock who does not follow the ways of GAAP. Numbers are but ink on a paper, pixels on a screen. NIO will rise, and everyone will watch in awe.
That’s only if u exercise it

You should diversify within a stock, meaning owning as much share of one company’s stock and spreading the risk. This way if you have 1000 stocks of PLTR and 50 stocks aren’t doing well, at least you still have 950 stocks to count on
Somebody give me a $500 yolo
Yes
I will be fucking all in on this and buying any calls possible
Sometimes it's not about the end result, but the journey. And the journey sucked balls for you. Go fuck yourself.

Jim Cramer Says Young People Love Stocks Like Nio

11/17/20, 9:46 AM
November 17, 2020 09:46 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Media

Jim Cramer on CNBC's "Squawk On The Box" discussed the fanbase of Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO).

Cramer said younger people love Nio and love individual stocks or "obvious'" plays like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Nio has rallied approximately 1167.5% since the beginning of 2020. The stock was trading up 4% at $47.41 on Tuesday at the time of publication.

The company is set to report third-quarter earnings results after the market closes today.

Y’all know what to do
You have to have the money to buy it. Some brokers will even close it out for you ahead of time. But if you don’t have the money make sure you close it out before 3pm
I trade premiums. If it pops at all I'll double my investment.
Hold until it hits 25 next week
Left it on the bus.....
Only because it shot up insanely and then there were so many paper hands. What you see right now is some organic growth.
Bury me with my IWM puts. At some point the gaps will be filled. Likely after my 12/18 expiration.
Not only does lockdown cause break-ups and divorce, but it also serves as a barrier to finding someone in a world where more and more people are single. Inverse this guy. Also no positions, ban this tard.

Still -60% on 60c leaps. More plz.
I hope this nigga Soros dies, we don't need his negativity around here.
Been buying that shit since $40. Definitely a $300 stock at least
It is good. Robinhood has an extremely low interest rate as well that only counts towards positions you close with. I think you can possibly day trade without paying interest if you close everything out


If you believe in yourself then you’ll only make more .
Hold or sell my 480 Tesla 11/2Cs? Down -44.96%
if it costs less than a big mac im not buying it
More than half my portfolio is in it. Might have to increase that.

I wanna all the retards who bought puts cause of that Soros news. Don’t be shy
Volume = 10 contracts. The strikes below have no bids. Ban.
You mean to tell me being laid off in a global pandemic isn't a perfect time to buy a brand new house? Huge shocker.

Dude's lucky his calls/shares haven't went full blown Challenger disaster.

SPY retracement time
No. Their prior purchased shares were converted to common stock. This purchase was not made at the exact bottom. They have been selling it since the IPO.
I heard the eco nuts do butt stuff
5 years
No he didn’t! He sold everything he was allowed to sell and is going to keep selling. His fund doesn’t approve of PLTR business practices
what you mean my SPY 11/18 $220 PUTS
Correction? Mf this shit going to 25 EOY
What do you mean? Can algos unfuck me?
The can’t check the percentage but I took $8k to $1.7k back in March but came back fast and have had crazy fluctuations to bring me somewhat positive
Crazy holding into earnings with the massive runup already. Yes could just keep going on retard strength, but at least take some off the table. Iv crush gonna be huge.
NIO is mooning and my puts are printing for some reason. Sick life
NIO ATH was 54.20? Let’s break that before market close 💪
XPEV/Li power hour get ready
I love margin. It’s best when you have 2-4K imo like me. 2-4K is ok to trade on but 8k allows sooo much more wiggle room. Allows you to buy dips while staying long on past pics .idk perhaps it’s the same no matter what amount you have . But after a year of making consistent profits the only thing holding me back was not having enough free money to move , so many plays I would think “man that was one share, if I had 3-4 I would have made so much more” , so for me margin is essential
NIO calls dude. It's gonna moon after hours.
Reading that CNN 🌈🐻 article was what finally made me buy the calls on PLTR 

10x FEB21 $15c
I don’t think so. Just set a stop loss.
3% I think
What if I'm buying PSTH?

How did it hit my stop loss and then go up 🤪
I can't believe PLTR shot up another $3 tomorrow. Crazy.
wtf do you guys play this game if you need someone to make decisions for you. SeLL nIo Or HoLd UnTiL aFtEr EaRnInGz

I sold by all of my TEC.TO to buy PLTR. I spoke to God and he told me: "Son, buy PLTR."
i agree, buy NIO puts friend
[deleted]
“They sold?”

“Pump it.”
Pump or dump today?
do them make your dick grow? asking for a friend
Why would they do that?
How much of a correction do we see to PLTR tomorrow?
Yeah just make sure to watch baba for when it does eventually go up.
whats the likelihood nio numbers come out well before call? like 430
Why?
-22%
Watching my NIO calls moon but having ptsd from getting burned by PTON earnings... Probably gonna hold anyway like a true retard
I'm up like 4k rn too
*11.50$
I had $300 left and I put it all on Nov20 CCL 18.50c
Boys strangles the way to go on some of these high flyers. The puts are a little insurance in case shit goes wrong. NIO bulls I'm looking at you crazies.
I know! i bought it 10 seconds ago and its down $0.01. Shit stock
Almost touched 23 this morning. It's slowly going higher, it's day will come
Shhh don’t let anyone in on the secret...
Crwd hop in fellas
Fuck citron. He’s a miserable bear bitch just trying to recover the money he lost from his lame TSLA puts and his alimony.

How tf is it even legal to own puts in a company and then publish hit pieces on them.
Baba headed to 220 like I said last week!

This isn’t going to age well
Stop sharing your plays here. Algos just gonna reverse it
Pretty bearish in here
Nio 🚀🚀🚀
Thank you
For the record, I believe that NIO will go down after earnings. Bigly.

Am I still holding my calls through earnings? Yes.  It’s worth the loss to roll the dice on making serious tendies. 

Also fuck bears.
Half of this sub bought it at $54.

No Tillman on today. I’m assuming it’s because of what a fucking dumpster fire he has caused with the Rockets
All in for Macys earnings $9c 11/27
Bought puts on PLTR at the bottom 🤦🏽‍♂️
Never
When I sell shit creeps up like LOW, when I buy like HD yesterday it bleeds all day
He has sold every share that he is currently able to and will continue to sell it all
Dont hold thru earnings its way better to miss out than get burned
nio is absurdly ovErVaLued

but thats not why im not buying it 

i just dont like stocks that move on citron tweets, red flag for me
Yea thats what I am hoping for. You think they are going to report the record sales, or we will have to wait until earnings?
> That you're arguing that the OMB is defining the budget so the FR isn't responsible for creating it

Well that's right -- injecting liquidity into the market temporarily, and then buying it back means nothing for "raising money for wars" and other such nonsense.

You've been sold a bill of goods by a couple of charlatans.
ENPH higher support, getting ready for the next leg up
Hope you'll recover then, buddy

Power hour hasn’t even started. NIO 50

How long until NIO gets included in the S&P?

I’m ready daddy
If you really work in Biotech please let me know the company so that I can make sure never to use any of their products. The level of ignorance you have shown means the hiring is based on nepotism or casting couch.
Hi my name is LeoFireGod and I just got Nio Puts.
maxed out my day trades so guess i’m holding nio through earnings 🙃
That means my 11/23 $370C are gonna print right?
Sell
Fake. Ban.
I honestly believe HYLN will keep pumping this week

any questions?

no
Up we go
That's a daily occurrence for me
Why would you sell at $50 when you can sell at $60 tomorrow 👀
Maybe. Maybe not. Dunno. Good luck 

Look there’s 2 ways here - you sell half or whatever enough is to cover your initial cost, or you hold it all and pray. Either way you’ll probably regret it so just pick one.
The one we are in
12$
You made more % than dollars... BAN. Just checked out that low volume chain lmao, double ban.

Too late to add more PLTR?

friendly reminder that NIO was at $26 3 weeks ago. take profits while you still have them - retards.

So I've been so caught up in tesla I've missed out on this. Pltr = air bnb?
selling half NIO calls holding half
RH absolutely does it
Pltr power or sour hour?
I sold a $54 11/27 for $300, let’s hope the IV crush goes hard.
This just made my day 🤣🤣
bro where do u live it’s literally like 60 for me
I was thinking of rolling my 22c 01/22 to 2023 50c. As of this comment, it nets me a credit of $800, which was what I paid for the 22c to begin with.
Sold my 50 shares yesterday at around 15.40 😭 i got like 30bucks lmao
sell, it's better to hate yourself for not catching the gap than to get ripped apart by pooh bear
Will do numbers this covholiday szn
Every play has been wrong for me. Mostly wrong timing it is.
Interesting,  okay. Has he already?
im also gonna hedge with a close call and thatll break me close to even either way. if down considerably more.

Everyone is hyping on PLTR while i'm just PLUG-ging away
Signing off, no more responses. That you're arguing that the OMB is defining the budget so the FR isn't responsible for creating it is just ridiculous. If the Fed weren't allowed to do it, the OMB couldn't "budget" for the expense, and Congress wouldn't be able to "fund" everything it wants to pay for. The entire system requires the Fed to print money.
100 EOY
sell today, unless nio goes to uranus tommrow u still lose
[deleted]
-70% UPS calls when I bought before earnings. Only down -10% now and almost back ITM.
Bs, they bought it a matter of weeks ago at 9.50/share
Could hit $30 eoy
RIP
Holding 12 may 21 12.50 calls.
tech selling off into EOD?
Might just get rid of these BABA bags. This isnt recovering anytime soon.
How about canceling your sell just to see the stock plummet 15% in a flash
Nio ripping
power hour should get NIO to 50 and then we hold our breath
In EVs we trust, earnings will be great the only way I see this coming down would be cause of Citron..

Great job vro 🤙
I was actually unaware of this. So I’m not paying the tax on my snap leaps that I exercised after earnings? Hot damn. Feel like I should’ve known that... thank you.
You are right but I am sick of losing money while waiting for this shit to happen 😂😂
Not with IV involved, hold the shares
Get a graveyard job that way no never have to sleep
13,000 contract buy EWJ 12/18 67c

What bubble?
Cut tesla go into NIO. They said it wasn't justifiable being as high as it was. Same thing they said about Tesla in the beginning at 400 range. Then hit 2k, got split and is already climbing way higher. NIO is gonna be the Tesla of China but with a much larger population than the US plus.. all they gotta do is (mention) going global. KNDI just got approved in the US and jumped 20% total value. > I'm up 70% on my calls on it. Thank you KNDI.. NIO just needs to mention such and it will blast off.
So we selling before earnings???
Wait really lmaoooooo LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
I sold CRSR at 30 thinking that was pretty high 🤡

Sell my 2 shares of TSLA to buy 50 shares of PLTR?

I know I should sell my NIO calls but it's so fuckin hard to press that button now
I am on a couple boards for local non-profits. Just got out of two different finance committee meetings with our financial advisors. They more perma bull than me. SPY 400 confirmed. 

I loved how they responded to my questions about the markets with “because the fed”.
Lol
[Is this you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jozug9/guys_investing_is_not_that_hard_with_proper_risk)
After watching this, I don't blame anyone for buying those calls and holding.
Lol which one of you autists just bought my NIO 80 call expiring in 3 days?
Selling PLTR now is like selling TSLA at 100. It's okay to be retarded, but it's better to be smart for once.
The Virus saved the bubble. The stock market had been expanding for 10 years and we were due for another bank crash due to the bad lending in to companies that had happened. COVID gave the govt an excuse to bail out the banks by giving companies money under PPP to payoff their loans in the CARES act. less than 20% of CARES act money went to people who lost jobs. Most of it went to companie so that instead of declaring bankruptcy they could use the new loans to payoff the old loans and be credit worthy again.

This has cleared the overhang and now allows another 5 years bull run.

Add to that the fed put has allowed companies to issue debt very cheaply and we are in a situation with too much liquidity and nowhere for it to go and the only place to get returns is the stock market

COVID is the best thing that could have happened to the stock market.
Ye
my friend just had a kid today

meanwhile the most exciting part of my month is NIO earnings
Pop gang it is 🍿
They be using PLUG, my man.
Essentially a strangle.

NIO announcing battery powered rocket at earnings today.
Yes depending on how much your up. Look at LI after reports last week. If you’ve got a lot of FDs don’t be afraid to take some profit friend.
Free risk management
Who’s the fine lady in the picture?
NIO will pin at 43 for rest of the month or bump to 51
Nope, self-employed so I have to buy it myself. 

Even when you're covered by your employer, they're taking it out of your compensation budget. It might not be literally deducted on the check, but it's being deducted on the spreadsheet before your salary is set.
Because they have no product 🤡
Lmfao at Apple
Soros Fund Management said it "does not approve of Palantir's business practices" and that it "made this investment at a time when the negative social consequences of big data were less understood."

As a result, Soros Fund Managment said it would "not make an investment in Palantir today."

Sold PLTR at the top but hesitated putting gains into NIO ):
Well if we are just going to full retard pump nio up to 4pm I guess I’m selling these calls right before earnings
I feel like NIO is going to go huge one way or another, why not just put $5k on equally OTM puts and calls to play the big jump ? Is there  strategy for that?
My gut says sell so hold
my entire portfolio is now NIO lmfao. i hate you all. let's go!!!!!!!!
There vaccine is shit but they already have 550 million orders so next years earnings are going to be good
I would, unless you want to feel regret tonight/tomorrow.

Hookers & blow.
I did my own TA and figured that your answer is right in the ticker. The price will go LOW after earnings

Hold NIO after earnings?
Lmao homie is like 90. Whatever. PLTR is 🔥
Wym? They just put it on sale so we could snag more calls? Who wouldn't buy on a 80% discount?
You will hold through earnings

Like I said, I only heard this from somewhere. But I think the church would make an exception for those sweet tendies.
Apollo backed the Fisker SPAC, huge institutional support, I’m very bullish on FSR....I like the warrants
FYI: part of news story. The discounts for Prime members will also apply if customers who don't pay with insurance want to pick up medications in person at more than 50,000 brick-and-mortar pharmacies, including competing companies. That’s why Goodrx is down today.
NIO is almost at $50. Some of you are gonna get hurt. Take the gain and let retards go down with the 🔥
Milton is no longer with NKLA, and they haven't done anything recently to garner attention. Feel free to buy some long dated OTM calls for when they release the Tre/Badger that aren't 3D renditions. Also, their new 'factory' is still just dirt...

Honestly, on RH I don't know if it would let me do that. I'm on level 3 options but every time I tried to enter into a spread, the shit never worked, so I gave up trying to do that. Obvious answer is "use a better service" but I can enter trades pretty quickly on there vs. at least the one other service I tried (WeBull).

Ooooooh nice

NIO IV increasing hmmm

NIO share price is going higher but so is the value of my puts lol
Soros ugly ass eating Doritos looking ass drinking 7up stupid ass bitch ass niiga can even go to the bathroom by himself looking fat ugly fuck nigga
I didn’t expect to be on Reddit as much as I am when I created the username but here we are. Completely agree - we’d all be rich if they did.
What bubble
I’m still paying commission you fuckin retard
I’m up 115% what do I do
[deleted]
Some pussy downvoting everything lmao. Looks like someone has nio puts
It's obviously gonna be flat then
Oh shit thx for the info bro
very very horNIO right now
whats the catalyst
I bought Jan 2023 leaps on NIO a month or so ago, still holding. I think it’s fine even at this price. NIO shares are safer but less upside.
See
Biden will help him 👏
Nah. The ANT IPO would’ve gave BABA a lot more added value. Since it fell through, it got sold off because that value is currently not on the table. Hopefully, Jack Ma can keep his mouth shut next time and just bend to the will of the CCP.
Easy
I will sell at 50.  I will sell at 50.  I will sell at 50.
SPY EOD pump or dump? I say dump.
HO. LEE. FUK. NIO.
It’s been doing well despite covid, and certainly better than Q2. Not sure what to do with it tbh
Maybe buying NIO puts 30 invites ago was not the move
Bro... its up 11% in one day right now lol. Doesn't matter if you have leaps, there's gonna be a substantial pullback. Take profit and get back in if you want, but to each their own
NIO blasting into space, no bear sized astronaut suits💀
SPY 359/358p 11/18
If nio doesn’t have beyond stellar earnings this is going to be a disaster
Been holding my shares since $3.23 straight diamond hands

Closed my position today at 1 for 50% gain. Not bad for my first option. Also my second option was bought and sold today for 100% gain. PLTR Nov  27 20c
do ppl care about up or down votes? really?
MSFT Ex Dividends Date is tomorrow. It is not going up tmr.
Ive got leaps for 2023, Ive got like 8 more earnings to go before I sell
Stocks can only go up, if the thing holding Stocks only goes up. 

Ergo, this literally cannot go Tits up.
😂😂 bad luck mr big short
[deleted]
They try that and they’ll get theirs for the black outs in March. I’ll blow my whole account on puts the moment I can.
Shares r for boomers
when NIO diverged from XPEV/LI, and yes, TSLA.. is when shit went bonkers

i'm excited to see what happens in the next 48 hrs
The lesson here is to fomo nio no matter what
[deleted]
But that’s boring
My boy bbw just keeps getting hammered. 

Someone get Sarah McLaughlin to ask won't you buy a stuffed bear today?
Astute analysis from the taliBAN
Long call 50c, short strike 55c. I think based on the open interest, this thing might pop past 50, but then get crushed down to 50 on Friday. Look at the insane OI on 50c.
Doesn’t matter. Home Depot and Walmart both dumped on good earnings this week.
The call I bought at open is up 21%

Neat.
Or lose both via IV crush!
Sounds risky I wouldn’t
Holding, since I'm in it for the long term.
friday
Nio slow down pls, there is some more time for earnings call
Yes 5 years+
Goldfish
We need a Robinhood IPO & Reddit IPO to complete the memeception portfolio of stonks

Couple things, you can buy shares with your HSA. Second thing, for this knowledge, I would like for you to buy $DAL as the cost of this information.

Thanks.
Well even as a NIO bag holder I’m surprised we didn’t see more resistance at the $49.00 price point
Epic
Expiry?
Inverse dip you mean? 📈
Nope, holding from $13

I need to be a money manager that invests only in meme stonks. Buy a bunch make sure all the retards know I bought it then offload to them the following day for massive gains
Can somebody please explain to me what the fuck a 'share' is? I keep getting told to stop losing money on options and just do 'shares' by my Rtard family
This is the way
To 300
Holding shares 🤡
Defense/government stocks are boomer stocks.
Sooooo sell calls buy puts?
1
got out at 266, very nice very nice
Maybe if we say how BABA shows how weak the CCP is compared to an American powerhouse like AMZN is, it'll climb...hold up, someone at the door.
Hold, hold, sell, idk what one is, hold, hold, hold for sure after ER
What’s spy going to open up at?
Cos I'm a salary cuck
That’s what I meant lol, let’s pull some LL type shit and once we have enough money from it we can pull out our tendies and move to a real broker
Its not about money, its about sending, a message
yessir 170 strike expiring next friday, TGT has the best e-commerce. IT's going to blow
You guys convinced me. Bought NIO puts.

It is. any thoughts?
You forgot Hristo S, Customer Care Hero.
Bruh that’s wayyyy OTM. If those print imma have a Yacht
was following ftch, thinking of getting in but was afraid to buy the top, nice to see someone get sum gains good stuff op
Because Im busy watching NIO rocket and IV crush my NIO calls
I have no positions, but TJX has earnings tomorrow pre-market, and last time I went there (3 weeks ago) it was a fucking zoo, so even though covid, I’m betting they deliver good earnings
I think they are rushing before the bubble bursts.  

Having been involved in private equity you have a few funding rounds but they are on ROUND G? G? I do biotech private equity (marijuana / psychedelics) and I have only seen series C once...  maybe finance is different but we are seeing biotech rushed to market because it is hot and we don’t want it to cool.
yeah do you need anything?
[removed]
PLTR gonna dip tomorrow
Good call. Smartest guy I know works at palantir, I bought it just based on that lol. it has a long way to go, get back in there. I’d assume the it’s going to at least a $100billion market cap in the next few years. 

Everyone cucks themselves sooner or later, I liquidated my entire Tesla position average price $269 when it went to $500, this was pre stock split, would’ve made 10x 🤷‍♂️. you made money which is more then half these degenerates can say. 🍻
why do you hate money?
Last chance to close out your nio puts before president Xi jinping punishes you 🇨🇳
Lmfao
He's implying that Cohen is in on those puts.
How does all the shitty joke DDs making it though now? This sub is legit trying to help people lose money.
not bull or bear on nio, but some of y’all definitely gonna get wrecked in the next 24 hours

popcorn gang 🍿🙂
With most of WSB in NIO, i feel like it's time to inverse. 

FOMO burned me too many times.
Buying puts and calls on NIO so that I win if it goes down big or up big
Get on Microsoft before this moon.
I suck with options I have $90 left to do whatever
$50 put and call for Nov 27 selling for about $1000.

Was eyeing it but too rich for my blood
The $MOON etf was just created and is destined for this sub. It’ll be the first meme ETF that we take to Mars
I’ve been saving money for that ipo, gotta go all in
I almost timed the top today. It was scary because they actually dipped this morning and I ALMOST panic sold it. Khol’s surprised everyone and I think Macy’s will too. I see Macy’s at $11 after earnings
[removed]
Yeah to provide liquidity they are forced to buy at the bid and sell at the ask. The collect the difference as profit.
NIO diamond hands baby, DONT take profits. Roll the dice. Embrace the risk.
Damn, that Left guy must’ve lost a lot of money. Or at least people who believed him.
Everyone on RH better be getting a free share
Need to get to $25k ASAP not being able to consistently execute day trades is boning me
[deleted]
Best puts I’ve ever bought
Jeff > Jack
NIO makes me forget about how much BABA hurt me
If this rumour is true we are in for a sexy time.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/blackrock-backed-arrival-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-spac?sref=ZoyErlU1
Saw a NIO call block 2021-4-16 75c 🙃
we going to end green aren't we?
We about to rip past 362 or what?
Rug pull imminent
Keep buying my premium, peasants - your friendly Theta Gang dealer
It's going to 100$
Bless my puts papa elon, snuff the flame of NIO.
Smart man for such a username. I’ve seen this too many times with hype stocks on here, and it’s hilarious to look back at older hype earnings lost on here 😂😂stonks never stay up 😂 god speed young fella
Me waiting for BABA to move so I can get out and buy a few NIO calls and then open spreads as it pumps into EOD.

🤡
Hours later
🤡
Sell a call strike above
God damnn are we actually gonna see Nio hitting 50
At this rate, even if NIO has a sell off, it’ll only drop to 45 so nbd. Rest easy bulls, we’ve got this
At least we got kissed with tendies before this!
I mean, you'd objectively be closer to being a millionaire if you cashed out that 200K, took a break and came back cool and strategic.

You just got lucky as fuck and chain-gambled to fulfill your compulsive addiction.
If NIO details EU expansion, not even IV crush will be able to hurt you
I’d buy for no other reason than to have a big dick when I send support messages
I sold a 58c
Hi super nintendo chalmers
well I'm glad I day traded puts today, cuz i was right and it went to 440, not 500
Worth. I wanted it to diiiie
I bought at $6. Sold at $35. Was happy. Now sad.
Why is no one talking about our old friend DKNG
I canceled my $48 limit sell on NIO when it was at $47.46 and all I can say is fuck yeah. 
(Was just selling a bit to hedge against a drop
I don’t think so but good luck
I like the fisker warrants, lots of leverage in them
We’re really going to use Robinhood to get Robinhood FDs just to lose money and give more money to Robinhood
I dunno man, they just did an offering of 750M at like 22.5 a share.
Yup...I'm holding some 12/18s but I picked up a couple more 11/20 17.5c that I'm hoping will pop either EOD today or tomorrow.
DAMN NIO ..not leaving a trace...

Nah
normally i'd just shout HOLD THE LINE

but...it depends on what you have. if you're holding FDs, i'd sell just before close today. longer-dated calls (1/21 at least), i'd hang on to them and gamble a bit

position: 1/21 45c. holding, but setting a stop-loss cuz i ain't a total clownshoe.
Anyone in TGT?

Soros selling for moral reasons.... that's hilarious lol
Oh muh gawd did you seeing that organic growth on Nio?????
> Sorry can you ELI5. I understand the basics of it but I don’t understand how I get a profit from that.

Sure. (i'll use hypotheticals but you should get the point)

Say you purchase originaly purchase a  $350 Call for $200 (and you notice at this point in time a $351 call would cost $150). 


Time goes buy and now your $350 call is worth $300. But you are out of daytrades, so you can't sell it. But you notice the $351 call now costs $250. 

Since you own the $350 call, Robhinhood will let you sell a $351 call. So you sell the $351 call and are credited $250 to your account. 

So now you own a $350 call ( $300) and have sold a $351 call (valued at $250). 

Next days comes and SPY has crashed.

The $spy $350 call you own is now worth $150 and the $spy $351 call you sold is worth $100. 

Now in a single trade you sell the $350 call for +$150 and buy the $351 call for -$100 (net +$50 to your account) and you close out all positions.

So - you already collected $250 when you sold the $351 and you Collected $50 when you closed the position, so your net net is +$300. Essentially as if you were not out of day trades and sold the option.   

Same thing works the other way $spy if $spy moons the next day and your $350 call is now worth $500 and the $351 call is worth $450. 

You sell your $350 call and buy the $450 in a single trade and end up in the same place. 

Make sense?
u/XXXTentacle You can invest in private companies ...

I'm going in balls deep tomorrow PM on 3/21 $300c and may the all mighty pooh have mercy

What do you mean?
Nio $40 put 11/20 - in because cheap.
Blizzard already supporting WOW on M1:

"With this week's patch 9.0.2, we're adding native Apple Silicon support to World of Warcraft. This means that the WoW 9.0.2 client will run natively on ARM64 architecture, rather than under emulation via Rosetta.

We're pleased to have native day one support for Apple Silicon.

While our testing has been successful, we're highly aware of the nature of day one support with updates like this. Please let us know if you run into any issues that may be related to Apple Silicon in our Mac Technical Support forum."

[deleted]
Might as well watch at this point.  Unless you made enough from your old positions to gamble a contract or two.  House money.
I dunno, the dumping should have started already.  
But just in case, I cashed out half my position.
Planning to do a strangle on something like NIO is the type of retardation I'd expect from someone who doesn't know how to sell into a debit spread lol 

At least you saved yourself from yourself
Call credit spreads 25% OTM for NIO free money. If buying $65c weekly FDs on this stock is retarded then selling them is good business.
At this point, I'm wondering if expiration will just be a nothingburger.
just got in a SICK 55put ER for TJX. i got in 16 times. risky business.
You guys ever wonder how you got so retarded? I impress myself every day with the retardation inside of me
Imagine not taking nio profits now
Yeah I feel bad for it
NIO WITNESS ME, MY UNDYING DEVOTION!! WITNESS ME
Close your positions.

What reasons does it have to sell off?
NIO 50 🔥🔥🔥
i would have considered it as a sign to watch
Neither is ketamine but hey 👋
Yup. What he said. If you want to be a succesfull chef. Go to school for business. If you want to be a good cook. Go to youtube
They do make nice videos of trucks rolling down hills. That's worth something.
Tsk tsk
Low volume on SPY today
Holding any through? Options activity makes me think big news is a-coming
damn stonks really only go up even when they go down
Puts or chill but honestly I do believe it’ll go up so get stock or just watch the mayhem. Too late for calls imo
Bought PLTR at 14 last week, holding till exp at eow for once just to see what happens
And the owner unloaded massive amounts of shares the day of vaccine news. Bigger yikes....
My oil refiner calls and my tech calls are both up. Why can't everyday be like today.
Bruh, did you expect that a stock that goes up 15% in a day, would not dip?  Hold, and it will rebound fine
Amazon returns dude. Bringing in tons of business. When you return something they give you a 25% off one item coupon. They are now seeing the fruits of this.
That would be hilarious

What’s the deal w this one?
If you think this NIO pump today is big wait till tomorrow... will hit 90 easily

Is pltr gonna hit at least 18 by EOD or EOW?
he wanna make quick buck bro
*snap* yep. This is going in my cringe compilation
PLTR lets do a V shape. buy the dip . get inn while its cheap
Definitely going back up. Soros didn't sell because of financial reasons he sold because of some moral reasons.
Hedge funds
It was a freak gasoline fight accident

Might want to pull the trigger. It’s pulled back into the $17’s now.
Guys I don’t think this NIO run up is healthy
This is it NIO
Da faq u talking boot
Learn how to find well priced OTM contracts. You can find some a couple weeks out selling for under a dollar. Just watch youtube vids and all that
Or be flat.
I bought some by an accident earlier because I forgot spy sold weds calls so you can’t be that autistic
Have some 20c 12/4 at an average of 0.59. Sold some today to get my initial investment back and gonna let the others ride
Sorry fellas I edited post 😥
The perfect meme play....yolo YOLO calls. It's the double inverse, like taking the blue and red pill at the same time and chasing it with a shot of whiskey. You basically become Neo except the matrix is the stock market, the machines are the algos, and the agents are Market Makers and whales.
Ok doomer
I’m a true Nio bullol
I’m 170% up mine. Earnings on Thursday so probably gonna wait and sell tomorrow myself.
I need ccl to crater but it’ll go up more I’m sure
Dude stop shilling your boring ass youtube account. You're just ripping bad clips from better source material.
We won you fucking idiot
This is what I was tryna say, maybe my writing was bad. If u take schedule 1 drugs like I do, you have to get a prescription from a dr each month for a refill. They’re not allowed to write you one without an official visit. So it’s part of my daily errands that day because might as well take an extra hour and pick up your meds rather than wait 2 days for shipping.
It’s basically an ATM for shorting
Take them gains at 3:55 homie. If it moons, you missed out on some $$, if it tanks AH, that feeling of helplessness is soul crushing.
FSR is a long play. Won't see much action until they roll out their first EVs in 2022. Maybe late 2021 we see growth?

He is selling his entire stake in PLTR as he is legally allowed to - CNN article
LOL. mRNA cant even survive in the body without a protein sheath. It has no direct effect on the virus. It enters our own cells and makes them produce the protein . You sound like you are 13 yr old. Go back to scalping PS5s. Biotech is not for you
Pump into earnings then either flat or slow bleed tomorrow.
I really need Netflix to moon 🌝.
Anybody knows when are they releasing their next diversity hit? That’d work charms with sleepy in office
And just bought :)
Watch the Soros news 🤡
!remindme 2 weeks
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
if u think it will drop why not sell it and buy puts? duhh
Fuck me too
Have you made money bro??
I’ll make the calls around here.
Watch the Soros news 🤡
I meant to sell half my NIO position but accidentally sold it all....damn. Conflicted for whether I want to buy back in, buy puts, or just watch from the sidelines.
hold
This shit is going to 220 because I own it, thats the only reason, not that Jack Ma is a moron
What's a good entry for pltr?
homie really out here betting against CHINA
NIO strangle might be the moves this shit either gonna go to fucking Mars or die
buy some nio now
Hope you exited some on that
Are you rich
Power gonna be crazy for Tsla no matter which way
What's the minimum you think you should be putting in? I'm newer to stocks but I usually put a grand or two, is it worth it there?

Well fuck. I bought $19 worth because I had $19 left after buying NIO and PLTR.

GPOR up 42%.
I think Tesla gonna have one of those +10% a day weeks :)
[deleted]
NIO has retard strength. Maybe it won’t drop w/ earnings
PLTR  ✅ shaped recovery
positions?
they should after CHINA do their thing
Absolutely stoked. When I bought my shares, an options chain didn't even exist yet. Thanks for the heads-up!
Holy fuck PRPL
Really what happened was that they announced guidance for q4 and anticipated decreased earnings for the following quarter due to their seasonal, cyclical revenue cycle. They crushed earnings q3 but because of that q4 guidance, its assumed that they didnt 🚀 for those that played ER

Very close to pulling the trigger on a ps2
ROBINHOOD MAFIA RISE AND DEFEND PLTR
All this talk about PLTR.. No one notices the JMIA dip???!!
Sold all my NIO shares so y'all are welcome
Lmao it has huge support at 17.50 chill
I should submit though. It's just that I rode nio from 7$ to 21$ and I don't want to reverse that.
lol why sell S&P inclusion news when 51 billion dollar aobut to come in?

Oh, the damage is already done 😔
Anyone else in ZM?
Yes, with shares you’re safe. Ride the high until ER and sell high at the open
Lol gonna hurt a lot of people.
bought amzn calls at open. somehow held them all day and didn't fomo into pltr
Ah, a shitcoin autist. A rare breed following the great shitcoin depression of 2018.
850 P/E ratio I think it’s a bit undervalued tbh
NIO announce international expansion = moon bigly. 
NIO announce first ever profit = moon bigly. 

Yet pussies here want to sell? I thought this was a fucking casino.
never feel bad about taking profits. congrats and yuck fou
How much more pump are we realistically getting from BA. Jeeze

Reminder to check your daytrades before entering a trade that you want to exit the same day. Not that I'm in a bad spot (YOLO'd in TSLA near the bottom today) but I'd have liked to do a strangle into earnings on NIO and can't. :/  I think NIO's run up enough that it'll go hard one way or the other post-ER.
Good point. Biden is working with cvs and Walgreens on COVID vaccine distribution btw. They’re already a huge part of the testing.
I don’t even think about an eod pump anymore. I just hope the dump isn’t too bad
[deleted]
Because it's fun.  It's fun to hold.  I have 60c 10/27 and I'm not selling until that very day.  Best case scenario I'm living in tendie land, worst case scenario I'm still having a good laugh.  Mostly because I own 40 shares bought at $10.  And options

Oh thank goodness, then
Pltr about form the 🌈 pattern.
while im down 48% cause i bought Friday
!RemindMe 1 week
Get into retail guys.
pltr buy the dip opportunity in play
We gonna be eating good for years
Okay but sir, you have not listed positions.
Plz post a screenshot of your loss
I grabbed some cheap weeklys on Monday as a momentum gamble.  Just annoyed because their move killed the run...  It was bound to happen eventually because they could use the cash.
Thank you for your sacrifice
What do you mean?
Hope you bought the PLTR dip. 17.5 is a good price.
I think that was because people realized how less practical Pfizer is (needs incredibly cold storage) even if it works.  What are the negatives of Moderna's vaccine?

What color lambo you getting?
If you go to China, you ll see people are crazy about black, German, Luxury cars. Image is very important there.
It was just a flex bro
should i pick up more NIO shares?
If you don't have PLTR in your portfolio, you're retarded.
Yes. I normally can remember when I trade an ipo since I normally trade very few. This year was different soooo I've traded a lot more. Lock outs are usually 6months.
Who else is short dollar and short treasuries ? 🥴😤🚀
Proof?
 I put my hand up on your hip  
when i dip you dip we dip  
you put your hand up on my hip  
when you dip i dip we dip  
I put my hand up on your hip  
when i dip you dip we dip  


you put yours and i put mine  
and we can dip down low and roll and grind
Damn 6% isn’t bad at all. When I buy the top of shit I’m down 20%+ in an hour
I feel like it’s too obvious for SPY to go upppies tm
I sold 7 at open, had 9 total. Letting the last 2 ride but wondering how the rest of the week will play out
powell pump
Hold shares. You can make a graph showing the payoff from holding leaps to expiry vs shares. My guess is that it would need to more than double for you to make more with leaps than shares given premium, but I haven’t done the math. Make a graph.
because companies dont collapse overnight but puts and calls expire worthless
this guy gets it
What’s a bear?
Fuckkkkkkkkk what do I do NIO
Possibly
Same, as a GME bagholder i look forward to the pain at EOD every day
Didn’t know this. Another wrench in their viability.
Yep I killed it. Bought pltr call at the top https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvr81t/z/gcmlkxe
poop yourself on the bus
Wtf is this shit r/smallstreetbets !!???get it outta here.
We need real gain or loss porn not this BS!!
Okay sell it now
LOGI from here on out
Same ppl who fomo’d into NIO, are now screaming about PLTR. Sometimes you can’t help stupid 🤣
Are we blind?!?!?! DEPLOY THE PLTR BUYERS
Divide your age by two and minus that off the stock prices that should give you an answer
I think tomorrow it pops off.  Still low volume.
Woah no way, spy calls 🤑🤑🤑
Hold!!!!!!
So sell the FD, and buy a long dated call? Which strikes are you doing?
That's the king of boomer stonks. Leave that alone
Don't say nio will gain more than pltr today. Pltr will never have a day like this again and it can barely bearly beat a standard nio day
looking at pictures of some actual bears, they are some funny af looking animals
Thank god for NIO, otherwise I’d be selling feet pics to eat this week. FU BABA
Msft u piece of shit
That works for bulls also
:/
Heard that. We basically already had been doing a 10pm curfew tho with bars and restaurants closing at 10pm.
Okay - that’s reasonable. I am on calls
r/atomicalstreetbets
wait till tomorrow when it crushes all the hopes and dreams in this room haha
got in earlier today at 16.9, sold 18.4, bought nio till EOD, gonna buy back into PLTR, hope this dip continues
I don't feel bad for anyone on the outside looking in. 

These past few weeks have only been a tease..
Good shit brother, now get some more shares and leaps with that money!
Small/mid cap growth is where it’s at
As long as he doesn’t shit the bed
Could avoid paying short terms capital gains tax by exercising rather than selling
I wrote 55c just now. Even if it gets around that price, the IV crush will fuck it up badly. If it passes it, its okay because I have 12/18 50c and 1/15 50c to cover them.
NIO gonna drill in earnings
I cannot wait for some bear loss porn after being absolutely hounded by the bears for the past week
Pltr currently getting rid of retard dumb fucks, just hold my babies we going to the Proxima Centauri.
QQQ puts anyone

Where’s the guy who made 100% of his portfolio PLTR at the very top when it was $18.6?
$600 1/15 and $800 March 2021 are good too
Or lose all your profit retard
We got fucked by soros
Right haha, the stock just wants to do its own thing.. hopefully we will see a run up soon
*HOLD*
Money supply?! M2? It’s absolutely skyrocketed.. from from ~15T to 19T in just 2020.. Money velocity is still suppressed.. which is the key metric for inflation, but that’s because we still have many shutdowns across the nation..
Need all of your retard strength to make PFE a meme stock. Thank you!

Solid DD right here.
Wrong way Tesla
communist nio is going down!
They're gonna dump NIO again aren't they? God.
The rich boys are done selling off the vaccine stocks for now. They're moving money back to the "Distressed" stay at home/home-friendly tech stocks: ZM, TDOC, PTON, AMD, AAPL. After today, I'm quite Bullish about ZM into earnings.
I don’t have to imagine 🤡🤳🏻
I think we're at the floor. all it takes is you waking up to some good chinese news regarding winnie the pooh being happy with jack ma and we're up 10%
yes
Couldn’t have said it better myself, his old wrinkly smelly stinky bitch ass is just trying to get a better dip to buy on. What a pussy
He cucked us
HOLY SHIT NIO ITS REALLY HAPPENING
Bears so r fuk
Lol it be like that sometimes
Thank you stop-loss for preserving 80%ish of my PLTR tendies

Strong plz
[deleted]
Hey so is pltr gonna go back up
 Nio has to be 60 for anyone to make anything reasonable
See you tomorrow NIO bag holders.  😝
no my son
NIO puts sounds like the smart move since a lot of people will be taking profits
If you bought sub $40, absolutely.
Are you aware flaco means limp dick in Brazil?
low volume nonsense, it dont mean nothing
Now we can lose money betting on people losing money.
NIO feels like a sell the news event
I just love making a crazy amount of money on days like this so I can lose it on the others 🤡
Lol why the fuck did you leave the audio on...
lol i must be bored or ocd because I am triggered after looking at this option chain
Imagine imagining
Well then
I like your style.
PLTR screw soros. POWER HOUR climb inbound 
BUY THE DIP
[deleted]
Puts for the dip after earnings, not falling for this again
Already did
Spy only up $4 since 10 this morning, weak...tomorrow better be a $10-15 day
Mama didn't raise no paper hands. I will diamond hands PLTR to my grave if I have to.
I just noticed donnie hasn’t tweeted shit today
TTNP some weird spike Anyone know why? In long asf so I’m happy so just curious
Bought NIO puts at open and I’m up     Honestly gonna cash out everything cause I have no idea what I’m doing or how anything works
Swear on my life bud lt beer has the same effect as xanax. Just bud lt tho. Something about the herbs in it.
Ahh ok I didn't realize the MM are pretty much always forced to purchase this kind of trade regardless of TA, FA, or DD at all. That makes sense, thanks.
PLTR Puts ready to go. Make double the money!
What’s the mental state or NIO bears and shorts right now? Are y’all feeling comfortable going into earnings?
dude then sell at close! take ur profit, IV will crush you
I'm so late to real-time news, these threads are where I hear about them. What soros news? I saw he upgraded the price or buy rating (forget which) yesterday
then you hold - unless you need your money asap.
Energy
I watched PLTR hit 17.5 and my limit order didn't go through

Fuck RH
I’ve lost 4 grand
Happy Birthday to Covid. It’s 1 year old now.
So you're saying I should hold through the night and double down on shared in AH.....Got it
Y’all bears are either going to be very right about NIO.....or very wrong
Holding onto 18.5 17.5 calls for Friday. Absolutely shitting myself atm
Potential dip after lockup expires.
Murica.
better buy now before it breaks $18 again
decimal point one order of magnitude too far right
I'm up ~~5~~ 9% on my puts and expecting it to tank after hours
I ACCEBDTALLY BOUGHT JNCO WTFF
need a starwars one this is the way.
NIO will either land on the moon or crash and burn like a Boeing MAX after-hours

No inbetween
Yeah lol I've seen them. Good laugh lol but honestly not a  bad play
It’d be like wrestling a spider monkey
I ain’t fucking leaving
small cap tech doing really well today. Those former hype names like FSLY, ETSY, SNOW, U, CRSR all doing good
na I sold, paper hand
Why not just go AMZN
How fast this go down hill?
What's next for Amazon? Insurance? Bank? They're gonna be like Sumitomo or Samsung and sell literally everything.
Regardless of what happens at NIO earnings, they’ll be a dip soon after and I’m buying it.
Someone pls tell me tsla is going to beat 460 over the next 4 weeks
It's literally a publicity stunt, they said nothing bad about the business
Y not
That's actually reasonable.
I don't have the balls to hold
NIO gang holding thru earnings? I own sHArEs
Why don’t you think it’ll get crushed?
Not if it moons
I am convinced the only reason NIO closed up after opening down 7% yesterday was because of WSB Autists
So what’s PLTR going to do tomorrow? Who’s in it with me with some 12/4 22.5c
I was thinking the same thing. I don’t see how amazon would affect gdrx unless they are planning to offer discounts as well. Even if I’m planning to use amazon, I’m still gonna use gdrx to see where I can get the drugs for the best price
Buy boomer stocks and the spy and qqq.  💪
So are the returns.
NIO volume over 200 million, PLTR under 100 million...lmao wut!? PLTR rly gonna let that China ev fuk do that?
cuz you can google recipes and cook food at home
hourly reminder: if you bought PLTR at the top at 18.75 you‘re currently down 6.15%.
Sign up with amzn pharmacy  for all your pharmaceutical needs.
What's IV Crush? Is that like orange crush or is it a different flavor?
Why did I get out of NIO when I knew it would meme pump
Hey Alexa play I get money

We burn together comrades
I know this thread is obsessed with its meme stocks but if you are interested in a really solid stock that has been printing all my calls for me check out WestRock (WRK)

They make all of Amazon's cardboard, their fundamentals are great, technical analysis suggests huge upward momentum. 

Only problem is low volume, but good because p/s ratio is super low despite high revenues.

True... my brother in law is a pilot for them.... they’re hiring at the moment.
Fucking paper handed my 11/20 18p at 17.90 because I got busy at work and distracted and didn't wanna have them shoot back otm. I'm all about the easy tendies.

For reference I purchased them about 60 seconds before hand
So the first day it genuinely spikes, I should just take the money? I got leaps yall

Xpev announced when i was sleeping on 11/11. Woke up 11/12 to 11% gain..

From the morning I woke up to that close of day it went up 33% *after* ER. Even the day after it spiked 13% more before started to dip.   


To compare... today is the "11th" for the scenario above.

Looks like you might be able to escape this without such a massive spanking! Good luck
iBio new pump to begin? Big dip today...
Holy shit so many people asking me what IV crush is right now... you retards should not be trading options
Weak hands selling PLTR at 18? Watch next month this gonna be at 50 like NIO

NIO CALLS YEET
theta gang is a art form

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS puMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMp it
Soros a) has already sold most of his position, b) is selling because of PR reasons, not because of financial reasons. If you like money, buy the dip.
Question I never thought I’d ponder:
I’m up 300% on my Macy’s FDs is it time to sell 😬
I think the Soros news will drive it down for a bit (like, an hour)
RIDE ceo is going to be on Cramer tonight so it might get a boomer bump tomorrow morning

Well I bought today and immediately had buyer's remorse but it has climbed back to even.  I'm less concerned with what it does immediately and am more interested in open tomorrow.  I've seen too many autists create posts on here in the first 15 minutes after ER only to give a sad update the next morning.
I’ve been buying calls
you got it backwards. buy high sell low.
Fair assessment. I've got shares and calls but waiting for some stability before I grab more calls
Pay your taxes.
Get out
PLTR is the way
Some random idiot on NIO 70c 12/31 has had his single ask stay at 3.50 from $47.60 to now at $48.80 and its extremely triggering
Can ZM do that thing where it shoots up to $450 by EOW please and thank you
Dude...
Should I hold or sell my NIO 43.5c 11/20
NIO bout to become a $60 stock tomorrow
NIO 40 put is only 1 dollar, might print bigly tomorrow
Nio puts are the way.
Never touched it
Just bracing myself for the GME end of day dump
Shorted calls
It's a slow day for Nio buddy
Will that cause nio value to go down?
Sold it 15 minutes ago

wtf is wrong with th3se work options. Why that massive iv drop everyday. the stock is up 2% and my calls are still down 10%
"DD"? Ban this retard
Glad I bought NCNO yesterday, knew it was too low. Going to let it keep running back up heading into earnings.
Lost all my gains
You got that backwards bud
Sell low buy high
You are 100% right but this place has the “good” kind of retards
A bunch of bearish retards will lose so much money when they announce this.
Its going to be YUUGEE

GDX calls is an easy win imo

dont even know what this means lol! all i see is green
This is actually a good strategy because if you listen to the media, you behave like the rest of the sheep.
Based on this and your previous question, you really should NOT be trading options until you do more research. These are really basic things to know and without these basic building blocks, you could lose way more money than you already will lose.

All in on TAN you say? You son of a bitch, I'm in.
WOW

debating right now. Was going to sell earlier today at like 47.10..glad I didn't. Only up 18% on my calls so I'm not sure...
Listen I’m autistic.  But not that autistic.  May 21’ exp
**PLTR PUTS LOCKED AND LOADED.**

Darude, Sandstorm
Yeah read the article. I've $20k in Jun 2022 LEAPS that i got in August and was up 120% when it hit $320. Glad they are still up at 30%. I thought this would take me to tendie town but Xi and CCP threw cold water on my plans.  


Will probably wait for 2-3 months before i close the position since the CFO told that cloud would be profitable in the next few months, in Jan we will have singles day numbers and Ali Cloud is the official cloud partner of Japanese 2021 olympics.

I bought back my 10.5 CC’s on a red day at when it was down to 11ish. Got too bullish and made a fucking stack. Never doubt your little pecker
Wsb sentiment on NIO bearish - guess I'll hold...
how'd it shake out?
I feel you, I kind of got burned by them once but it would make sense for them to go up with the new cod doing well, wow expansion coming out, and more lockdown potential. Was thinking about getting in for Jan calls
Thinking about all the carts I coulda bout with the money I lost on spy puts yesterday
What is NIO earnings looking like?
Well I’ll inverse your inverse
Take your tendies and get out is the best advice. But, you won't do that.

Get back to us in a couple of months.
rotation from PLTR to NIO
[deleted]
trolling the daily thread is almost as fun as losing money with u retards
LI auto dropped 18% after earnings, NIO will prob be similar then run after 48p 12/4.
I have 500 shares and am up 94%, I’ll probably sell 200 before close I guess?
Agreed 👍💯
Not enough PLTR. Add 0.28% more.
Wow robin hood IPO
I am very heavily leveraged in TSLA. Plz moon
Agreed, this is cheap for PLTR. Get in while you can
Still, I'm worried the earnings will be sobering, which can't be good for something that has run up so much so fast
PLTR got that WAP bro!!
Analysts keep raising price targets though. That alone should drive the price
Robinhood ipo next year......hell ya.
Lol before
I am not too concerned about post-earnings. They will have a strong earnings. The huge sell-off with Citron lowers the odds of a nose dive imo
You had like an 80% run up the week prior to get out?
For my Puts, yes
its why we will trade flat (less than .2% moves intraday) for weeks.
You can take the rest of the day off.

I was close to buying PLTR at the top today, thanks god my order didn't fill lol.
Alright mother fucker, I've never actually made a profit buying calls, but PLUG has been good to me.

I'm in. 12/31 at $25
Thx guys <3
Can’t wait for NIO to get IV crushed, we’d cull so many of the braindead retards from the sub
Teehee 😈 💯
Not funny at all wtf
yes, also of August. August was crazier, tech went up in a straight line
Do we sell BA tomorrow after the FAA news? Its had a great run.
Nio for sure
Yeah, go google a bit how trading in general works and stop being stupid. Fuck off and have a nice day.

Sincerely,
Trading 212
That’s stupid bro, a lot of the market is random. No one could have certainly called that TSLA would enter the S&P yesterday. People with short dated calls got lucky. Can’t go all in or too much in on one bet because if you don’t get lucky you blow up. Don’t judge yourself on how your positions come out but whether the purchase made sense given the info you had at the time.
lmao Soros acting like a day trader. Glad I got out of my calls when it hit 18.50.
You guys are too bullish. They’ll hear you. 
*Ummmm yeah! Nio will crash so hard, you guys! LOLOL* 🤫

great earnings does not mean it will go up
Driving a Chinese EV will cure the world of COVID
This is why a low percentage actually make money here. Buy at the top sell on the dip, so smart. Have fun staying poor, but stop this fear shit.
Target fucks
If you don't write at least a few 11/20 calls on NIO I think you're missing out. The IV is insanely high. Even if this pumps the IV crush will fuck those calls up seriously.

Buy longer dated calls, and write 11/20 calls above that strike for cheap calls.
HD blasting to 280, get your tickets now
Probably not in the immediate future, but I would expect it in the next three months. The gov moving to block Ant group’s IPO was basically just to send a message to Jack Ma after he openly called out the govt for restricting financial innovation through stifling regulation at the same event that the Chinese VP was speaking at. The CCP knows that they need BABA, but they also have to remind Ma who’s in control. So I don’t expect this beef to last more than a few months. TL;DR: BABA long term hold good, BABA weeklies bad.
Selling any covered calls expiring Friday before close?

Why if you don't mind me asking?
Everyone
The difference, to my knowledge, would be that this bet is bearish. The Market Makers are forced to buy at the bid, so someone is betting that it’ll end below $20 at expiration. They’re looking to collect the premium credit. So if you bought the call you would actually be going against what this trade implies will happen, or at least what they think will happen.
Hold. And if it drops, increase my position and hold again.

Is there any way we can get that info to see what their short strike is to cover?

Dont go to culinary school you’ll learn more in 2 months working in a restaurant than you would paying for school.
Just gonna say it: don’t see stimulus happening. And if it does, it’ll be so minuscule as to make almost no impact. Seems like the debate on who to stimulate is businesses vs citizens. History tells me how that usually pans out.

Up to you, but writing otm calls against your shares reduces your risk (I'm very risk adverse myself lately). I get the fees though, swallowing decent ones here in canada too.
I'll take it at that.
InvestorPlace said NIO is a $150 stock...that’s what my proprietary model says too...buy calls, leaps, and shares
neither
NIO had a strong last two months. No doubt they meet or beat earnings expectations.
It was less gayyyyyyy
Duh.
Bought the top of PLTR twice 🤦🏼‍♂️🤢
That’s a lot of calls

Soros didn't get rich by pump and dumping meme stocks. I don't even own any but hearing from msm that soros is selling it makes me want to buy in at 16.5.
Be cautious over NIO guys. I’m a bull, check my history, but man it doesn’t seem worth it to hold overnight. Even shit into 2021, 43c, will take a massive hit if NIO doesn’t open above 60 tomorrow (as opposed to opening like 45-50)

Apparently a 20% move is implied but that also doesn’t mean it’ll hold into tomorrow even if we gap up to 60+. 

Just my $0.02. I intend to fully get into leaps by end of week regardless!
CBAT back from the grave.  Gonna unload this position EOD no doubt.  Quick 20% or so unless it fucking crashes again.

Which is why I went puts just now ... Now way this thread makes that much money together
Stand back and stand by
No I don't think its priced in yet.  The stock already was up in the mid 50s range so a strong earnings should boost it at least temporarily before it settles.

oh and I hold shares friend
Hold

OMG can we ban tickers NIO and PLTR or at least put a filter on this damn page.
Does it? Neither money supply not the money velocity went up significantly with the last stimulus
Nuclear war with Iran could not drop spy under 360. Calls are safe
SPY weeklies are such fucking lotto tickets. If you can pick the direction, you can get rich AF. Definitely going balls deep when the next move up or down is crystal clear.
😂
I thought it would be up like $100 after today. Good thing I didn’t fomo.
I sold just before it started going down. Never been so lucky.
[deleted]
Soros pulling out yesterday is what kept it down. This only skyrockets from here if the retards actually think
oh, he still made a tidy profit from the hype
Does this mean it’s not too late to get in?
we def dropping 20% on NIO AH...
I haven’t been here all day. But Kohl’s made me a lot of money today. So did Starbucks but not as much as Kohls
I'm thinking of going to culinary school. But I also want to make money. I'm torn

 NIO bulls who don’t see by eod, are gonna wish they took profits lmao AH
i did... 50 more shares
NIO will automatically Geolocate you via mobile phone and pick you up for full autonomous experience.
You might be joking but come January when they have to relocate from UK because Boris is a wanker they could take a hit. Source - am an EU based IBKR user that got many emails notifying me that I might not like the relocation process (Not in those exact words)
performing the 4th day trade within the 5 day period marks you PDT - you basically are free to day trade all day since the marking of PDT happens before open of the next day. 

While marked as a PDT and <25k you cant day trade or else you get a penalty based on broker- RH is closing positions only for 90d.
You obviously need to be on r/massivecocks
Ive had a hard on for PLTR since it first started trading.🍆
Tsla is testing corona vaccine .... In space!

PLTR is gonna bleed rest of the day.  If you have calls get shorter dated puts.

Selling PLTR on the Soros news. Will get back in promptly, though.

Cya PLTR
What a pussy!

Fuck that. I'm trying to get rich and not let politics get in the way of my tendies.
Christmas is right around the corner just buy some FDX December calls and sleep
That’s definitely the reason. It’s not a financial reason. So I hope it won’t discourage others.

You momma’s ass
with my second option trade of all time i've somehow galaxy brained myself into a NIO put
Idk who this *Mr. Siga* guy is but he looks like the Chinese knock off version of Mr. Clean. Oh wait
li what is you doing baby?
-$2k on my BABA March 2021 310c 

Would y’all hold or exit for a loss? 😓😓😓
I wonder if it came from investors taking profits, cause there had been good news around alibaba recently
no doubt they will beat, but they will also dump
Pltr nooooooooooooooooooooo stoppppppppm buy that dip here we gooooop babeeeeee
FSR
They don’t agree with their business practices. Some gay shit
Where would you even see that they pulled out? They don't file another 13F for a while
And your positions are where?
Guys hit up my GoFundMe, you can donate by buying FSR at your local brokerage account
Just my 2 cents: Amazon pharma is kinda stupid. At best it’s 2 day shipping. If ur like me and have to have a visit just to get a prescription refill, why would I then go home and wait two days when I could have my prescription filled at cvs in an hour? Especially with docs being able to send electronic prescriptions, it could be done by the time I get there.
[deleted]
I don't long term yes, hell I have shares in my ira. But short term there will be a pull back, hence why I wanted to short it in my cash account
i don’t see why not. extremely possible to even rocket past that
you’re flagged for 90 calendar days. during that time you can’t place day trades unless your previous days closing balance is above $25k.
Honestly I think it’s a PR stunt to get in cheaper, big money doesn’t give a fuck about ethics
Been holding shares at $3.94. The future is bright, amigo.
Jesus, BABA is now the most boring stock I’ve ever watched
You're not allowed to make another day trade or you get banned for 90 days from that brokerage.

Some let you call and beg on the phone to reinstate before 90 days. Or just open up accounts with more than one broker.
What's your DD on this? Seems overpriced to me, 250m market cap when they only had 1m in revenue last quarter? Seems way more expensive than BYND.
Get your Jan PTON call spreads while theyre cheap
What’s coronavirus?
waste of time that ticker, its over...move along lots to play with here - dont turn into a boomer in four months lol
Imagine if Robinhood had public stats like COD k/d. They might as well turn it fully into a game.

No no pltr wrong way
Please just go to 320 for the sake of things not being flat
People are getting 2,3,4 Coronavirus infections, and dying. We need a complete and total lockdown to get a handle on this thing. 2 months, minimum.
I wouldn't be surprised to see a few things tighten up.
Yeah I'll just sell the 55s
If you think Soros pulling money out of PLTR is the end, you didn’t deserve PLTR to begin with.
If you made 60% gains for the day and cashed out, would you wait before jumping back in or call it a day?
[deleted]
Yea I sold for a loss like 2 months ago. Got tired of seeing it haha 
But high, right?!
Like why not just sell covered puts and calls, you can literally do this with a couple thousand dollars, with 90%+ success, and double your portfolio each year 💁🏻‍♂️
Feels more like he’s nervous about what the investment looks like than losing money on it IMO
QQQ is as limp as a boomer's dick.
Yes
$MMM looking good
Soros Hedge Fund is pulling their 800M position of PLTR out.

Get out of PLTR if you don't even know what they do 🤡🤡
very wet ass pussy? it’ll bust, duh
If you don’t own PLTR your not black

shut up. you are gambling
lol not much runup.. 6+%
its weird NIO sat out most of the insane August tech rally(was flat July 31-Aug 21st??), and the majority of it's rally came though how it survived the September tech crash(actually went up a lot), and in Oct/Nov it's been the belle of the ball.
Apple teamed up with Chargepoint
NIO with x10 more volume in it’s candles than SPY
I’ll post when gains are %1000 and above.
read this as “elons feets” and got way too excited
Yeah with afloat of almost a billion.  And the BS is if I went to buy shares at the high like a schmuck they would mircleously come up with the shares.  I know, I know bid-ask price and such, but you can't tell me all 1 billion shares are bought and shorted too. ( And I realize the exxageration(
PLTR testing vwap let’s see what happens
It’s over dude the big bulls are selling and taking their gains already

Because you probably have a huge profit on PLTR, take it fam
YYY
I’m long TSLA 450 and 470 call LEAPS but short 425 and 440 weekly calls. Somehow my short calls are less down than my longs so I’m net positive... it’s good but wtf how?? And the shorts are getting IV crushed which means I’m making money even if Tesla stays flat.
?
i like ark, definitely gonna read it then
Do it bitch
Selling puts is free money.
now this is pod-racing
Calls are free money. Weeklies are likely going to be 10 baggers after tm open
[deleted]
Have $12.50 2022 calls. Thats why you buy leaps, there is no decision to be made you just hold that shit always and sell calls against it the entire life of the contract.
I got 800 bucks chilling in my account someone tell me what to buy

Soros already pulling his money out of PLTR funs over. I fucking knew it nothing ever goes my fucking way. Fuck this shit
Every time I see a person post "Buying BABA, can't possibly go down further", it's almost like the stock says, "Oh yeah?!"
PLTR rn is like when the girl says she close but you been pumpin for 4.5 minutes already
Who’s excited to see Elon’s fleets?

I’m not seeing anything ahead of CSIQ earnings. Keeping fingers crossed.
This is how I’m playing this game
Pfizer
Soros already sold and it’s still up 12%. You guys are retarded as hell, it’s a PR statement to get their libs army to calm down
I’m holding my shares no doubt, my calls I’m not sure, but let’s be honest I’ll hold em too
He invested in 2012 lol
Do you pay for it or make infinite free trials accounts?
Consider it a blessing
What if NIO drops back to pre-meme levels, never to recover though?  *ducks*
If the other EVs had great earnings why wouldn’t NIO?
Glad I went with more PLTR and got in to TSLA long dated calls!

Buy net!!! 12/18 75c

Guys chill. Chill. Buy and hold this massive pltr dip. We will fight Soros together.
You have some large balls sir
Holy hell anticipating NIO earnings is straight up edging. But yet I’m so high off the suspense
Are we going to see a drop like we did between oct 22- October 28th?
sell 30% of your options and hold the rest?
Something happened because it took off running up.  Maybe an institutional bought?
Fuck im afraid NIOs going to tank as markets close due to it jumping so high rn
Why would I do that?

SPY calls or puts??
Wasn't aware of that thanks for sharing. I really hate to sound anti-science or anything, but I just feel like it's insane that we have a vaccine for a novel disease in less than a year. I personally prolly won't take it, at least until I see what it's like to the public. I'm in the best category possible in terms of survival rates so
What’s everyone favorite Pharma stock?
PLTR hasn't seen price levels like this since 11
I called $KSS earnings yesterday. I didn’t expect them to reinstate their dividend tho. Did anyone else buy Khol’s calls yesterday? Macy’s is next!
Nah it’ll be fine but the dip
Puts on Soros!
The MMs dicked NIO call holders. 3 dollars up for the day and weeklies are only up 30%. I got out
isn't the lockup consistent across ipos?
Are you in profit? .... Hold

Are you at a loss? ... Sell, rebuy at higher price and repeat
PLTR tapped VWAP and right on queue all the algos bought
I have puts on NIO.  

I have been right about every move i make 0% of the time.

You're welcome call holders
Stock market 2020 90% options 10% cash lmao
My guess is a volatility drop. Wouldn't hurt to pop things into a spreadsheet so you can set your expectations. It could also just be a shitty spread/low volume MM nonsense (checked, spread doesn't look too bad).
As if today were red
I love that my last play on them was an expired $50 call lol.
If PLTR recovers this dip as it did before it will moon to 18.6+
PLTR no point in selling this
Another bear trap from spy
Lol, investors know NIO is a moon mission. Look at this buying rn
[deleted]
CRWD having a good day
Hold
I read it was Xilinx which AMD bought
Want to see a magic trick? I can make a stock drop just by buying calls.
Same
No clue, but I'm ready to buy the dip!
If I could write calls I would, but I’ve not found a broker that doesn’t charge extortionate fees in the UK. Plus, I’m fairly risk averse atm as I don’t have tons of money to just dump so gonna stay out of options for now until I’m more cash heavy and got my career a bit more sorted. But appreciate the advice!
Yeah might as well sell and roll the profits into shares
There comes the PLTR calls on Cheddar flow
Why the jump on NET?
Open interest in BA weeklies is pretty high for 11/20s . Not so sure 737 will be a sell the news event . Unless it’s I’m all autists loading up
Is Nautilus a good buy at $18 or do you guys think NLS will keep dropping ? I’m starting to wish I had sold at $27 - should I get more at $18 or is NLS heading waaaay back down ?
Zucc getting grilled rn
How the fuck are they going to "beat"? They are a growth company earnings doesn't matter for 1 but secondly it will not "beat".
soros pumped and dumped palantir what a boss
This shit is about to crash homies. So much build up can only go for so long before the big guys cash out and leave the little guys bag holding.
What am I missing with NIO? 67B market cap on \~500M quarterly revenue?
fuck him fuck
FSR calls...about to explode
THey fugged PLTR
With 1.5 hours to go, NIO is totally gonna break 50
what a fucking goon

I suggest TD Ameritrade
I’m in lol
Will we even see the stock response tonight? Isn’t call at 7pm est? Most trading would be done at that point.
Nah it’s ded bro, what’s there to be afraid of?
After all this time, still love the purp
it means they are going to be late, they are also rushing a late stage 2 doses trial just in case 1 dose didnt work. it is probably nothing for JNJ due to its size but probably good news for small vaccine makers

A lot of us think about day trades in an on/off kind of way: we have some left, or we don't. I'd encourage you not to get too frisky unless you have at least TWO day trades.

what's some autistic plays I can immediately regret (last day trade)
And I'm up on my PLTR 11/20 19ps.  Fucking day trade ban tho and I'm going to have to hope for a swing trade.  I should just go back to Webull until my PDT ban is up on RH.
Financial Times had an article on Nov. 6 and there may be more to it than Jack running his mouth. 

The Chinese banks and other financials in china are getting their asses handed to them and they need Party help to compete with ANT. Those banks are carrying a lot of bad debt at the behest of the party so it seems that the Govt is likely to neuter ANT to give it's competitors more time to get their shit sorted out.

I don't know what that means for BABA price action. 

I don't want to hold anymore bags. I keep looking for the price to stabilize but seems more likely that the govt. will announce and the stock will 🚀 to the 🌕 within minutes.
I feel like an idiot holding NIO puts
Only time will tell. From the DD that I have read, it sounds like its going to go up.
Should I hold or sell my NIO calls
*Power hour anticipation intensifies*
don’t you think its all priced in? and what about infamous IV crush?
Don’t hold through earnings

Hold PLTR or sell?
There is no way Mitch will pass another stimmy as long as he lives.

Wtf is a Soros??
Upvote for bipartisanship hating :)
How is this gang feeling now
Im confident those will do well, good luck
Shit guys sorry if PLTR tanks right now, I just bought a call about 10 mins ago

Edit: got to be fucking kidding me, of course it starts dropping literally the moment I bought in

I have made 13 trades today all of them instant losses
Just speculating as to the amount of attention It gets on this thread when everyone here is always looking for the next big thing.

SSSS, PLTRs current valuation makes up 50% of SSSS market cap lol.

He’s selling it when he can.
Someone explain to me how is PLTR being hyped right now
Normally sell before earnings drop, but this thing has retard cult strength similar to early TSLA days.

Ely used to be real tame but it's been wild the last few weeks.

Kind of figured it was hard to find shares, but why not just increase the cost to borrow. They did it on nikola
The market is not a reflection of the real world because the market is not for poor people
Juicy PLTR dip
it means they cant file for FDA approval until early next year
mRNA vaccines makes your own cells create the protein so the protein is being introduced into the bloodstream - NVAX does it directly. mRNA makes your own body do it

And you are completely wrong that the mRNA modifies virus proteins. When you are given the vaccine the virus is not even in your body so how would you do anything to the virus proteins.
The PLTR Block at $17.11 is large
Nah bro they bankrupt
it’s going to suck when i have to go back into the office and can’t day trade and completely ignore my work computer.
That sometimes happens when a stock has a lot of short interest. That’s to say every share owned in the entire brokerage is already short.

I can’t see how that would be possible with a stock like Palantir.
In on PLTR  12/4 $20

&#x200B;

Sorry everyone.
its looking stronger and stronger
Thats was a really good book, but im confident the author was on ecstasy and shrooms.
Yes. 95% shares, the rest in a few monthly calls for fun. It is the largest holding in my portfolio.
Same! I incorrectly call it the half hedge
My strategy is to hold my singular call overnight at which point it will lose all value.  This ties into my overarching strategy of losing all my money on this shit.

fuck it i am all in on PLTR now. small position in NIO
Buy the PLTR dip lol
60% of users on the Drudge Report poll said they would take the vaxx and 15% said not sure yet. So 75% would maybe take it.

That's pretty damn high for conservatives - arguably the ones least likely to take the vaxx.
You’re one of the...

>!smart ones!<
seems like the obvious thing to do. We all know what that means. Also, Chinese stock, so earnings will be beat by an order of magnitude x400
I'm back to say I told you so.
Be patient

Am I the only one that thought tsla would moon all day today and all week? Elon stole from me again.
PLTR puts until eod then calls
Should be atleast one green day this week, right?
The debt is really just a number at this point. $5? $10000000000? Doesn't matter. Pump it.
17c 11/20 and 7 12/18 at 10 been buying on the dips since palantir ipo
only a top for 30min till new ATH
earnings
Holding Nio calls through earnings cause tendies already made aren't worth the feeling of anticipation I get in my balls. Can go to zero for all I care, I'll be edging til they expire
Ruh roh the meme stocks are going the wrong way.
Told this chick on Tinder I’m a Derivatives Analyst
sold PLTR after small dip
CNN will still be gay when Soros pulls and the stock tanks and you lose your money on calls.
is tsla 760C for 12/18 pretty bad?
Doubtful that happens until we get some mega lockdowns.
It’s his antifa fund basically

Why Nio but not tesl
Calls on AIRBNB ipo
It means your broker doesn’t have any shares to give you to short. Too many people shorting.

Ibkr is a good broker for shorting. I think CP is far better cause they can locate much more hard to borrow shares but you pay a hefty price
if you don't you are crazy.
Jacked to the tits in shares and calls.
It be dippin! Buy it up fellas
J&J Exec see data need for US Authorization of COVID 19 Vaccine expected by 2020, early 2021... DATA? DATA??? PLTR??????

No seriously, I also have shares and don’t know what to do. Not a big amount enough to sell a part though.

NIO 49 EOD 😩

I’m just gonna tell you guys rn, EOD PUMP
Trying to save you from losing money. Take the blessing 😂
Source on this?
yea pltr bare minimum 25 eow and 300 eom if theres one thing I learned with stocks during the last two months i been on this board we always find insane stocks to ride, once a stock is at ath the momentum usually pushes it even farther up lets look at nio, 2500% up in 6 months, wheres pltr? only 60% up in 1 month, we have bare minimum another 2400% to go for gains 

PLTR 40 eow 85 eom, but more realistically 20 eow 25 eom
Do it 😎
Wrong way pltr
OH MY FUCK THATS HOT
I can’t wait for CRSR to become a meme stock
So sell a SPY 360c to turn it into a debit spread.
The most amount of BA calls coming in for 210 and 220 for this week right now during this little dip. Time to make another 10k
Spy has gapped up 9 out of last 10 days...so I’m thinking 90% it does again especially since it opened red today
[deleted]
What happened to NET? Any news?
Wait whaatt that was the only reason I invested
They were a great swing trade in July/August, now they're recovering again.
any suggestions?
Not likely considering I would be up 50¢ a share now.  And any time a stock runs up almost 20% there will be pull back
anyone hold PLTR stonks?
Indices strength is insane.
What's the overnight play? 🧐
Damn now I want take out
or a straddle/strangle
NIO must have a cure for all that is bad and horrible in this world for their earnings to report. This run up is a bit overdone.
is it time to play NKLA again? It's been almost completely forgotten about, when it was the hottest one in May, June, and July. Funny how they never have NKLA or Milton on CNBC, when it was a high flier it was on CNBC every day...
rumor is they have one more announcement planned for 2020.
That they think they'll have everything they need to show their vaccine works and is safe and can be approved by the EOY
Wrong way tesla
You bet a few days too early.
Yes it’s totally the same to intentionally not wear masks ever versus having a small outdoor gathering with close family once a year
[deleted]
 oh we're gonna pump? sick..
Sell NIO before close or hold through earnings? (I have shares). Should I just hold forever?
Thanks retards just made 500 bucks on one of you.

Also retarded DD because you talked about the over the counter stock on NYSE, instead of the real stock on Warsaw Stock Exchange (CDR)
[deleted]
Are we buying airlines again?
I imagine you were trying to write a call and you either don't have margins/a large cash balance or you don't own 100 shares. You need collateral to short something due to the implicit risk of it.
Please god tell me half the country isn’t watching this garbage
Soros is selling PLTR, do we sell?

Up huge on NIO shares & should sell some portion, but...

My mind’s tellin me sell, but my greed, my greed is tellin me hold

Hope you held brother
NIO, what are you going to do?! There so much suspense here, I just can’t.
Stfu
Congrats and fuck you
Just bought an 11/27 $AAPL straddle. Don’t know what it’s going to do, but pretty sure it’s going to move bigly in the short term.
Lol all you have to do is sell a 359.50 call (or 360 if that strike doesn't exist) and lock in your profit. You do cap your gain though but it seems like the way you are writing it you just wanna lock in a profit.
Dude most retail scripts are bought by boomers who go to CVS for fun and can’t work a computer
Hold
Why do you think we’re dropping overnight
You literally cannot lose with PLTR shares rn

Nah, I got out a week or so ago. Depending on what happens with the senate, democrat led congress could mean bad news
Guess I could have played that, but DLTR ER coming up first
Fuck.

damn so a vaccine produced in less than a year that won't even be widely available til April at the earliest and half the population probably won't even wanna take, along with record rona cases and some states imposing restrictions, with stimulus basically forgotten about... and stonks go up. Fuck. I'm usually a bull but felt bearish this week and I'm never betting against America again I'm sorry 😌
its more like there is an abundance of uninvested capital, so all valuations have just moved up accordingly. stonks are pricing in asset inflation and they are 100% correct.

**This is a bull market**
I grabbed apple $120c earlier and yes think $430 was bottom for tesla today
Nokia shares.  you could probally scoop up 1000 of them and then sell covered calls. Win win.
Why is RIOT up so much?
How’d that work if someone actually assigns you?
Was worse than that, bought low, watched it go very high, then sold very low lmao.
beautiful
Jesus wtf do they think is gonna happen? Not even 2 good vaccines got us to 365
Soros doesn’t make investment decisions anymore lol. Just the clown in charge of his family office
I think its reflecting Ant's valuation and the bottom is in.   
BABA's 33% stake in Ant is equivalent to \~$100B at the time of IPO. Based on the number of outstanding shares that would have given a $50 upside. But since the IPO got suspended, the stock is nearly $50 down from the ATH.  


Now it's in the hands of uncle Xi to pardon Ma for his lame actions and let them proceed with the IPO with some fake regulations imposed.
we 100 EOY
Just wait until tomorrow
Have you seen the cars? They are sexy af. I'd buy nio before tesla tbh.

Overbought?
Well boys, I fell into the classic blunder - buying an option with no day trades. Bought a SPY 359c this morning, currently +90%. I know tomorrow morning, I will awake to find it at -90%. Sigh.
The amount of people who don't understand the very basics of shit like iv or theta is staggering. Even if you're gambling and not investing rule 1 should be don't buy shit you don't understand for everyone
NIO sell off cancelled
Pump and dump for sure, it’s up 70% already
You too brother
It will either drop below $40 or open above $60. I sold my entire position on Friday, like a pussy. But $25k profit is profit.
But how do I know when to sell then
I think I’m banned if wrong, I know I said that somewhere along the way
MCFT: Recreational boating industry is set to grow 12% annually for the next 5 years. If you just do a basic DCF assuming MasterCraft grows in line with the industry it's worth at least 50% more than where it's currently trading.

FVAC: They are acquiring MP materials the only scale producer of rare earth metal's in the western hemisphere. China controls 85% of the production and if the western world dosen't want to get fucked they will need MP materials. If the price of the rare earth metals they produce appreciate in line with projections should also be worth double.

FAII: This is Fortress's third spac, the first one Vinint Smart Homes is up 100% and FVAC their second one is up 40%. Figured they would be able to do it again with FAII

INFU: Is a home healthcare company. They started out renting out infusion pumps to people at home, which are used for chemotherapy. They are now expanding into renting out other products for other treatments and are benefiting from the home healthcare trend caused by COVID.
keep going, just do the opposite
$48.50 NIO REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

BA calls = balls
Autists- if you want to know what Tesla will do- look at the weekly chart and the google “inverse head and shoulders”
he needs cash to fund protests he’s planning. don’t worry about it.
Thoughts on Ride?
Yolo it all on GameStop
Immediately please. If BABA waits until Friday then calls will be at -100%
What are your positions?!
I can’t believe people this dumb post on here
Nah
You have 20k of buying power. Go buy pltr
You feelin gay?
Positions? Ticker?
Yo, you getting Apple here? also you think that was the bottom for Tesla?
Grindr for me instead
looks like u still a 🌈🐻
I know we usually only post doom and gloom but after a pretty wild ride (up 25k then down 19k), I broke even today. Feeling very thankful.

But do they enjoy it?
Seems like you could live off of 100 tesla shares selling covered calls if you had a low CoL
[deleted]
Nah, big announcement tomorrow
Elon already paid off my student debt. Now I’m hoping he can help buy me a Tesla
I think they’ll partially recover... enough to make a few bucks from calls. 🤷🏻‍♂️
do it pussy
Awesome! Nice moves indeed. Made like 300 something bucks cause of the upswing, switching to selling a 20p for this week. If it fails, I’ll just roll. Good luck.
Congrats? Its what you did with that prediction that matters. Show us the tendies.

Depends on the pullback AH. I think the course its on we’ll def see 20 by Fridy
Nah roku.. but it’s run up too much of late so see a good place to buy in.. fade the vaccine news.. you all remember this comment, general population won’t get vaccine until December 2021.. hope will erode on a daily basis into early spring.. massive sell-off will ensue as headline bankruptcies pick up after the dark and desolate winter.. look at timeline of 2007-2008.. were in insolvency stage right now.. by god, please at least hedge your calls with puts to avoid total loss of capital. Shave 10-20% of your upside if this ponzi holds.  That’s what I’m doing now but I will pull as 10 years creep lower.. 10 year broke 70 bps already now 30 needs to break 160 bps and it’s game over..
whats ptlr
respects bro
Earnings will be past our moon all the way to Europa.
Elon just tweeted:

Is this NIO run up for a huge green dildo @ earnings? Or inevitable pump and dump @ earnings? Stay tuned this 7 pm
have a friend who bought 4,000 it at $4 and sold a week later for $8+
Am I really going to buy 1k worth of NIO shares right before earnings? Seems insane, unless....
BA calls?
What’s the move right now? Where do I put my money??
Implying they’d show up

Have one near me. Only arcade in both cities that’s popular. I think it will go up but not anytime soon due to covid restrictions happening again. They were close to bankruptcy during first shutdown

ofc at open. the screen shot is after i sold
Donny, what you gonna do until Jan in the midst of the worst of the pandemic , golfing and tweeting breitbart "news"?
They partner with everyone. Go spend a second to look into it. Also this is a similar play as it was when Amazon purchased whole foods. Look what happened to the food stocks. All went back up

Only mango can call the top
my bad. april 16th 2021 daily volume is 1.4 mil but open interest is 362 and 9.8 per contract which is 350k bet
Best seller since 1440
NIO dailies pricing an $8 move either way. If you expect more, buy straddles and profit
I think you are right, but if they sold it, someone bought it. Is that just a MM then? Does that not technically "count" in this case? Every trade there is a seller and buyer so I'm curious why the need to differentiate in the app. Do you know?

who cares, just buy them with intent to exercise and iv is meaningless, check how with your broker first

you would think. Whoever the market can fuckover the most is usually the outcome. So if the logical thing is to get puts and most people have puts, I think NIO rockets after earnings. There's a good chance it flies tomorrow morning and then dips. I could be wrong though. In fact, I'm almost always wrong.
https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/newsroom/statement-from-soros-fund-management-on-palantir-investment not actually backed by Soros though
Sold half of mine this morning so I’m not too bad
who's $RIDE'ing it
BA puts is where its at
Why is Purple king back?
any of you guys receive a TOD account ?
LI’s earnings were on the 13th right? It fell 7 bucks a share that day
Muah hahahhaha

- ccp
u better be right
NIO money gonna rotate into TSLA right at earnings
HYLN making my acct great again.  New high score coming
I have one for this week and leaps
NIO mini double-top and now a breakthru to $60
Ackman is a crybaby bitch boy
Good idea to buy like 1000 shares in an REIT like IVR? On slight upswing now and trading $3+ vs $17+ pre pandemic
You can’t
To not get it in the first place
If BABA doesn't start mooning by Friday I'm boycotting Panda Express
I just sold my 17.5 $PLTR call for 11/20. Hope I didn't miss out on too much.
Remove this so people will keep buying and make me money :)
put a 15% iron condor on Nio hopefully 15%+/- is enough...
EOW
Ty kind stranger. Up 300% in a day on that one.
FSR went from -8% to positive today.....
#MCPLANT
That’s me at 4pm eastern Monday thru Friday.
Good
Godspeed
I bought 1 PLTR share
FISKER
Rip
I definitely was pondering that haha. Was a good move I think though. Interest was really minimal and it allowed me to buy even more.
PLTR ez
If you've got at least 100 then look into writing calls against. The december 45c's are going for .70 - 1.00 right now and writing them still leaves you open to almost 50% gains on the shares in a month. Helps shift the odds a little more in your favor.
Naturally
Takes a while to learn when things seem too good.
3 fucking months!?
[deleted]
sad bc u lost 3 months' time? snap out of it pussy.
ARE we selling naked OTM call/put for NIO ?
Time for $Rope, thanks JPow u fukin cheats!

spaceKaren has lost it...that stock is off bounds now, useless, cept for PUTS
Jerome stop edging
Does your algo trade DOM or do you follow techincal analysis like SMA, Boilinger bands etc?
Ok yeah so I guess this is a sell, but like the other guy said, for every seller there is a buyer on the other side (or many). So the seller is hedging their massive long position you think?  


Sorry I'm a noob
Feed me!
I love your Disney numbers. My brain says no way. My heart wants to believe
fuck you
[deleted]
I was bear curious and got fucked for it. Guess I’ll have to load up on more calls.
Ofc
Or something?
Sell credit spreads
I keep dumping money in and watching my portfolio go down.
Such a hot take after it already has...
Just look on the bright side. Now you won't feel pressured to pay when you go out with friends who spent the summer getting laid, partying, and not taking shit from dumbass managers and customers. You now both have exactly the same amount of money despite spending the time differently.
I wouldnt...

AYX, FSLY, TSLA, PLTR, CCL, NCLH. I'm never buying ETFs. Stock picking for life retards
Rotation still going on? My financial funds are up bigly again today, what's happening?
Absolutely. That’s why I literally said it’s a gamble in the vid. Hopefully people playing this are experienced traders and not some college kid who has never bought an option before

You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That’s how I want every day to be.

Hold overnight sell morning
I appreciate the advice. I don't have a lot of money in my account, so I'm not able to purchase longer expiration dates. Should I just stick to normal trading for now?
Literally no sellers for PTLR. lol this is funny tomorrow we are 20.
What's the point of the vaccine if you can Covid twice as is?
Let me know of your next one
How far out are your calls? Thanks btw

Alright TSLA, what’re we doing at 448?
Good luck with your $200!
Would have been a decent day for me if it wasn't for fkn BABA
I’m calling my congressman right now to start a petition to make profit taking illegal 😤
Yea I’m planning on doing that. Wouldn’t mind picking up 100 shares even if it did get assigned. Planning on waiting till Friday and rolling out the call anyway. Delta on my LEAPs is around 80, so it’s gains are outpacing the sold call bigly anyway
it's at ath today lol
What strike? I got weekly 18
What’s the IV at for NIO fds rn?
Ngl the technicals look like 365-370 is not that unlikely eow
I mostly play calls, I’m just looking at it objectively. If it does open high like I think it will I might buy puts
how can I get nio puts without getting IV crushed
Are 1DTE 365c free money?

Up 500% today off my Yolo Tesla calls yesterday. My thesis was Tesla never goes down for that long and I knew something crazy was going to happen. I'm still mapping my next Yolo.
15 eow 15 eom
Come on Nio, you stupid little fuck.  
You can do it.

The supreme faggotry of the mods will ensure this opportunity is missed.

Wow contacting my representative over a [tax dispute](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtohy5/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/gcerwq5/) over call/email led to it being resolved in literally a day rather than months through physical mail correspondence. I've gained a lot of respect for local politicians and efficiency and an absolute disdain for state bureacracy.
Rip
yea i’m heading over to PLTR, nice consolidation, 11/27 25c are cheap
0 sell pressure all day, we're ending green
We all know exactly how well this will end yet we’re all still balls deep in NIO. Mama didn’t raise no bitch 😤
Yes correct. It’s safer if you wanna buy shares. I have calls tho. GL

Is amazon gonna buy rite aid?
Bro after I sell my AMD I really might never come back. Bloated stock barely moves up anymore after destroying earnings, acquiring a whole ass other company etc.
I’m a paper hands dude I grab profit when I can but I’ll also never make a million like some dudes here
Normally I don't do this but the play is buy shares of NIO and not options, right? Up/Down, doesnt matter because of the IV crush after earnings correct?
[deleted]
If you’re not holding NIO calls you ain’t black.
Proof
PLTR puts gonna be so juicy
those who have stayed with NIO for the last 3 months know what day it is 🕰
I need some opinions. What are my chances of getting crushed by NIO earnings of I hold my $47c exp 2/19/21?
What BABA expiry/strike should I get on a call?
[removed]
$60 tops and correction around $52-58 for a few more weeks
same too, only 200 shares should've bought 500
It's not a loss until you cash out or die. $1M+ or keep playing.
Yes that sounds smart. I do feel like they’ve got room to grow so I reckon I’ll hold these shares for a while
Puts all day. Brrrrrrrrrr
IV on my NIO call is taking me out by the barn right now for an afternoon surprise
So please explain how Xpev and Li both went up 50% the day after earnings?
Nio
Is there news on the launch?
$9 ÷ $48
Spy green EOD lol
You don’t have the sack
I got so many of them so cheap it’s going to be okay
At this point wait. Unless you have a day trade. Could easily scalp 1-200 if it jumps to 50.

Not sure what your position is, but I am medium-long term bullish on NET. If you're long term I would hold.
Tesla another gap up tm???
Sure, but so is everything.

BA will lag the market on a 1, 2, 5 and 10 year horizon. Anyway, all the best - takes opposite opinions to make a market. Just giving you my thoughts.
Now
I know. Just look at Li and XPEV, rotating into NIO. NIO is gonna gap.

Their commercial clients are the dinosaurs too... aerospace/legacy auto... Both low margin industries. If they want to get up there, they need to have big tech clients.

Not if these hands stay 💎 mr 🐻
Wth hold overnight they are going to crush earnings and open at $52
sell it all
I really don’t know but I feel like MMs are gonna fuck call holders just like on Friday
I’ve been trying to catch it for a week. I think the pros call it “averaging down” but it just feels like sending good money after bad.
I'm so happy I actually got into pltr at the beginning and get to ride the wave with y'all. Usually I'm a 🤡 and buy at the end while you guys are laughing all the way to the bank in your lambos
i was waiting for a fucking correction because rc people caught the rona

Gold now matey
1000$ YOLO opportunity?
Buying options or shares?
Diamond fucking hands
Fingers crossed
how fucked are the people who bought CCL puts
I think I ended up getting fucked on hedges, or maybe just by buying someone's theta positions.

I was able to get the same price, but then after I thought I was good. Big orders of the opposite trade came through later in the day. I wasn't going to hedge my bets and got fucked, especially not knowing which way to hedge.
shares - indefinitely
I remember when I used to buy options with 300% IV, god i was retarded 

AND I'D DO IT ALL AGAIN
What are you implying?
Mad IV crush coming on both puts and calls
92.5c 4,6 2021, 1/2022

Bruh if you got Arthur Blank and Langone supporting pay raises, we in a crazy world.
pump never stops
PLTR or more NIO after earnings would be smart plays

...Or ZM or SHOP calls if you wanna gamble.

My 2.36 shares has turned over a cool $5.00 😎

But why options
Anyone getting in on ATVI?

So tempting to buy puts but robinhood retards will never let it go down
25 11/27 are 0.30 right pretty cheap
1k shares cuz im a coward
Why do you think will be sell off? Compare Nio to Li auto and Xpev.  


Both went up about 7-8% the day before earnings call. The *following* day went up another 50%.. THEN selloff happened.

XPEV 50c 11/20 looks cheap, might be a good way to play NIO earnings if you think they are going to moon.
Maybe your 6th one will work out?

What's fucked up is that this won't even be the last double digit growth day for PLTR this month. maybe not even this week lol

What are your NIO positions
💯
It loves beating earnings and revenue too
This is so retarded I just bought puts
For real, it ran up too much.
For NIO, at this point good news is baked in, so they’re gonna need a huge beat and much better than expected future outlook for it to have a substantial move up.
I had 2 NIO 42c 4/16/21 that I closed last Thursday for zero gain after the dip because I thought they weren't gonna have every portfolio in the world invest in them
DKNG making Kings!
Basically everything 🚀🚀🚀🌛🌛🌛
200 eow
why? and give me your next play
This
I'm approaching them by holding a lot of shares and writing deep otm short term calls against them. I have some 35c's expiring this friday, then I'll likely write some 45c's against them again expiring in dec. Ideally the shares keep rising without ever quite hitting the strike that keeps moving up. My idea of a dividend stock ;)

$NIO is gonna do a line in AH and open $55+ tomorrow

How do you know from looking at this, who bought and who sold?

I didn’t know those existed, do people actually buy those? Why would you bet against the market?
It’s an easy 2-3x current price in the next year IMO
fwiw i got 500 , planning to hold
gimme 😈
And GME?
Y'all realize nio loves ah?
Me too
Hmm thinking about jumping in. Looking for inspirations for how far out I should date a call.
If you actually want to sell the shares, just sell cc’s against them until they get called away.

When is NIO ER>?
They only want enough profits to buy enough Elmer's Glue for dinner tonight
Why the fuck do people say “I hoop” now? “I ball” sounds wayyyy less gay. Literally don’t get it.
All jokes aside please don’t hold NIO options ovn, you will most likely get iv crushed even if it’s in your favor. Would hate to see y’all crying
This isn't even a diamond hands moment, it's just easy money
Institutional ownership
Bombing ER seems to be the money making move. Maybe it’s because investors figure it can’t get any worse, so it’ll get better? They profit take on all the companies that smash ER.
Then again, it is China, so it may be upside down there and the stock will actually just pump if it crushes ER.
You’ll be good man. Holding 1/15 20’s
It’s gotten IV crushed like 3 earnings in a row, I think this time might be different and then people will try to scramble to FOMO in and then it’ll dump and Niotard genocide. The end.
PLTR is very richly valued. If government cancels contracts, which happens all the time with defense stuff. Down the stock will go.
Anybody else think the robinhood monthly chart is so ass? It’s annoying having to check each stock on my pc because it has like 10 points plotted

Ok
look at Li and xpev. both went up like 7% day before earn and like 50% more after next day.
Im holding overnight
Short after it's gone up a lot, not after it's gone down a lot. Even if the S&P listing didn't happen, the probability this was going to go against you was high.
Same bro feeling like a fucking chud rn. We’ll see what tomorrow brings
I better see some massive buying into the close
Feel like its holding pretty well. Gut feeling says people trying hard to get in cheap.
Dead ass 😂😂
So, what’s that?  Like $5USD?
My timeline is like 20 days lmao. Can I get an F?
See that’s a good point but LI and XPEV weren’t as heavily memed if you will. In other words, do you think this could be different due to the fact so many Americans also are holding it?
I'm buying calls at EOW
Balls deep in puts.... -60% rn tho 😡😡😡 r they saying recertification in the morning Or AH tmrw

What's SPY going to do after TSLA is admitted to the S&P 500? Will there be a notable increase or will it just continue as normal?
Cruise lines still pumping 🤣😂🤣
Yeah, unless there’s a 70% upside they are gonna get destroyed

Citi of all big money center banks because still well below June highs relative to BAC and JPM due to compliance issues that hit stock hard in the fall. Has way more upside room.

Sticking with my COVID plays into next year's re-opening. Thesis is, value has been beaten up all year. These stocks are underperforming, hated sectors that will benefit big time from re-opening. See big risk reward here. Once we re-open, you'll see people who've been stuck at home for a year go on crazy eating out/buying junk/traveling/fucking. Long retail, travel, and STDs.

BA is the way to go now. IV still not high, so it prints faster
You have 2 choices. YOLO your life savings into NIO and loose it all (or maybe get rich, slim chance). Or do nothing and keep your money.

There was a guy on here who posted his gains of his stonk port and everyone ass blasted him for having an entire memefolio. I’m like 95% sure his port has 10 bagged by now lol

He had 
100k nio at 10
50k gme at 4

And some other on wish he would post his port again
Fckin paper pussies are selling PLTR cos they want short term profit, you will regret for life
Pretty much the same thing
PLTR 3k in stocks and 1k in whatever options you want to play
if your time horizon is 3+ years, should be a multi-bagger.

Sounds like a good gamble
Is there any actual reason that NIO won’t just get IV killed after earnings? Literally no stocks seem to moon even if their reports are great. Why should NIO be different?
DKNG $50 by EOW
Couldn’t tell you myself, but it’s up 9% so :)
Yes, 11/27 52c and 12/18 60c
Large institutions bought the dip Friday, and on top of that the Chinese government gave Nio a billion dollar loan to streamline their production. China will not let this fail. And on top of that, Li and Xpeng did well on their earnings and shoot up after. Also, NIO doubled their cars to sell. Like

Violence
Anyone getting NIO puts??
I'd be pretty fucking scared of 350
Maybe if they invested that 900M into pltr they would have some positive eps.
I am but I am super unsure about it
Imagine selling NIO before close 🤣

🤡 🤡 🤡
Yes will Skyrocket again and will make me rich
If TSLA hits 500 by EoW I’ll give everyone that comments $100 or a handjob, your choice

Premiums sky high everywhere
What makes you think that?
Think now is a good entry still?
Roll the dice ho. Don’t be scared your whole life
first time?
dafaq why
STONKS always go up!
First day in stocks? Companies  beat earning by a lot ALLL the time and tank
i think its gonna be 60 dollars after earnings
What strike?! I have 305 and this shiet is killing me!

It worked for nio when li and xpev reported

It's rising quick, so expect some consolidation along the way, but my portfolio's definitely betting bullish on them longterm!

Are you guys holding through earnings on NIO?
Unusual whales lost me so much money
Annex uk. Lets have a bigger commission free family of robinhooders.
I’m up like $450 on the day but robinhood says I’m up 3 grand smh
Okay, i need a small loan from someone I’ll double it by tomorrow
yeah, think it goes to 500 over the next 2-3 weeks
Nah you can only trade goats on the Somali exchange
Wtf
No way, Lowe’s is pack with people doing home improvement jobs during Covid
To the moon then flat
Anybody else find it kind of hard to get excited about your wins because you know you’ve had so many losses lately?
I’m more interested in airlines. If you’re thinking about cruise line LEAPs I see no reason not to do airlines instead. Much less risk, probably same reward potential
>Is the market just retarded?

Thinking aloud on this forum shows...
It’s so obvious Stephen Miller is writing just about every speech these days.
I would have said $0 too but they have $900 million in cash. And that will deplete soon.
NIO Dec 24 '20 $50 wish me ffucking luuuccckkk
More NIO
Tharrr she blows!
Why tomorrow?
oh yeah lmao
Third
ESH. Why would boomers give access of their portfolio to someone who doesn’t even have their own place. Bad decisions all around.
PLUG back to $23 tomorrow? 11/20s looking like a rip
I’m holding CRNC, TUP, SOLO, SPCE, and AMZN. Should I sell any before close??
These will not print
...ya'bloggusser!
Thats a penis
It's a data infrastructure company. Data brokers are dime a dozen; that's why they are drawing the distinction.
😅😅😅
Lies
Uhh it’s complicated
Good luck NIO call holders, don’t have enough money to play both PLTR and NIO at the same time.
Its going up
amazon
How did you do bro hopefully deep in profits :)
Not true... the swing on itm options is only 3$ lol
Dumping the rest of my tens of hundreds into The One before close.
are you me
A few years back when I was interviewing, pltr was notorious for some of the hardest interviews for software developers, and also some of the largest salary offers.

The company isn’t a joke.
I like it strike?
I agree VXRT has potential as does ALT for their nasal vaccine. The key is how long does the immunity last. Current phase 3 trials only have 2 months data. If it turns out in a significant part of the population booster shots are needed every 3 months then I personally would prefer taking a pill every 3 months rather than a jab every 3 months. Also logistics. if you are going to vaccinate 3rd world countries with low availabilty of medical personal a vaccine which does not need a nurse to administer and can be given by rural health volunteers works better.
Ex-CIA intelligence talking bout tendies!

How are looking today friend?
NETE is better than NIO
1. CCP
2. CCP
but you are one
Spy gap up tomorrow will be one to remember. Expecting +$7-10
Whats the NIO earnings consensus
How can I find the ali baba support to ask for a refund on my calls ?
better odds for 500 than 400
Preclearance? Is that like getting the 👍🏼 from the wives bf?
Any hope for TDOC?
Spreads if you're doing options
New IWM all time high. 

Also, highest amount of people admitted to hospital for COVID ever, even before Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

Seems reasonable.
That's it Nio - nice and high for Daddy
Thanks. I got some 6/2021 $92.5C. I'm currently debating should I sell a poor man cc on AMD $110C 12/18 or wait for it to jump up some more and then sell them.
I don't understand the obsession with losses.  I mean I get that its funny but I'm never like looking forward to seeing it. I def understand the FOMO though.  Is the loss porn just the other side of it that reminds you how stupid you can be with one trade?

I just got into investing about 4 months ago and got all 3 at the highest point they’ve been since

Panic Sold Nio for 7k loss on Friday. Lesson learned. Bird up to all you emotionless zombies that held on to keep profits!
Too new to do any TA right now.. but i think we hit 20$ eow (psychological number) then consolidate
I see an alternate history where man’s best friend consists of 600 pounds of muscle and hatred, and it is glorious.
I cracked up when I saw this too
appreciate you fam 🙏🏽
Cheers for the info. Been with them for a year now and personally I’ve had no alarming issues with their platform.
If NIO moons, will LI and Xpev also Moon?
To the more experienced gamblers, if there’s good news on NIO ER will we still go down, because there’s always a sell off before earnings?
Don't buy weeklies lol
this
For all the retards in here that tried to argue with me about tesla being better than nio, you have my love, but I'm keeping my nio calls
Fully agree
Just call them, I’m sure they will refund your loot hahahahaha hahahahaha scammed hahahahahaha
Taiwan number one!
SaND aLs jamaica
It's literally the shittiest EV stock you could be playing right now
It's implied volatility, but I've also seen it used as intrinsic value
Cmon riot, can you go back to +40% for the day for me one more time? 🤤

Buy RIDE Jan calls and don't touch them
Nah buy PLTR
Not if I have anything to say about it
Tesla why are you scared of 350
Can zoom fucking move ffs
Bruh what is this 😂
I think there'll be a small pull back AH, but gains again tomorrow fo sho
Need it to be $20.01 on Friday or Monday.
AITA: I sold my boomer parents' portfolio to yolo NIO $69 calls expiring this weekend and they are kicking me out of their house :(
"10 charts time" lol
 **IV** stands for **intravenous** which means “in the vein.”
Check the technicals. RSI and Bollinger bands are fairly reliable. But yeah if you’re long on this best bet are ITM calls.
Had me in the first half
yeah it pretty much says YOLO or GTFO
It will easily
does this mean I should sell you SPY puts?
I’ve got a bad feeling about my NVDA 550 c’s. I hope the arm deal doesn’t screw them like XLNX did to AMD.
Yes.
PLTR taking a break. NIO picking up the slack.
Ride and pltr imo
how do you lose on apple and amd
no chance
If you’re not already in it I would just wait until tomorrow after earnings
Why? How do you know theyre gonna do good on earnings?
0
WHY PLNT down?
Lmfaoo fuckin idiot
truth
What's your basis
Leave this place and never come back. Take it from someone that is down 35k since joining this sub
GME just grabbed a 1UP, new life
GAHHHHHHH EVERYONE AT THANKSGIVING IS GONNA THINK IM A FUCKING CLOWN IF I DONT HAVE TENDIES TO SHOW THEM REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
If it goes to 51 I will cry like a bitch
[deleted]
because EV is the future and china government like NIO so they wont fail
Typical GME Short attack
More Nio
#🚨🚨🚨 NKLA is still a $8.5 billion company instead $1 billion 🚨🚨🚨
That was mostly his reasoning. He was some kind of "fuck taxes" guy and would aways advocate how governments rip people off with taxes, so he defined how much he was worth and it was up to the company to make the price up to include taxation.
14% day tomorrow
Great
Yes hahah
According to OP, we just need one retard out there to get 3 billion vaccines and we should defeat the virus.
Thoughts on TSLA going to $400 by Friday?
Everyone who is missing JUMIA moon mission is fuckin autustic
This song bangs so hard bro just like all the stonks that are ramming my ass
love me a new NIO ATH
up
I have 4k to spend after cashing out of NIO and buying some truly retarded calls on other shit. 

What to spend final 4 on
paper hands.
moon it is
great for selling premium these days.
$300 1/15/21
I don't think NIO will spike like XPEV did. Whatever move XPEV makes NIO seems to follow but the movements aren't as large percentage wise.
You’d be a fool not to buy rn.
Lol nio.

Delete this shit
PLTR isn't a company at all, it's a way of life
Because it has "BA" twice?
Lmfaoo
Should I buy TSLA december calls?
Insta-thot
Anyone w the technical analysis on PLTR right now?
Sell pltr 11/20 50$ 5$ profit?
BA is a trash company and has been going downhill for years. Markets are forward looking yes, but also impatient. It'll be multiple years before BA revenue gets anywhere near pre covid levels, and they're bleeding billions each month. 

It can be a shit investment even if it's not going to go bankrupt.
You guys better be right about CRSR. I need another win to offset my AAPL, AMD and AMZN losses
Noticed this too. On the worst days shit moons it has a beta of .8 but for the last 2-3 months it’s literary been ping ponging on no news and has moved against the market. Feels super manipulated or institutions are getting out and manipulating the stock as they exit
Haha... Fuck. Yes.
Lost a ton of money on that, fuck baba
They will not let this die today. Someone doesn’t want to go back to 3500-600 range hell

SPY puts = fReE mOnEy
If you have FDs take profit. Shares or long dated options hold
"stock you haven't heard of that's already up 14% on the day, will rocket eod, GET IN NOW"

🤡🤡🤡
Sold half of my NIO CALLS for 800%
Most days I feel like I've unhitched from the horse while moving.
Wash sale rule: if I close all options positions before Dec and don't make any moves in December it should be OK right?
"HOLDDDDDD STEADYYYYY" lmao
Buy NIO right now or nah?
Instant volatility
No. way.
PLTR buy the dip. 20 tomorrow
They just make a bunch of diagrams. And apparently it's not even that accurate.
Based on accumulation 😂
RBC straight up scammed me, how tf are my BABA 01/15 260 Calls down 25% since EOD Friday despite the underlying dropping only 1.3%?
Lmao my 2023 leaps are losing value while the stock is going up. I swear I always end up losing money.
Sold my PLTR leaps to YOLO on BABA, can you guys point me to the special Ed room please ?
I was thinking about selling 17.5c today but had to get preclearance and by the time I did that it was over $18.50. Thank you ridiculous financial industry red tape.
It's taken me a year to reach that on my 401k
I know NIO is going to meme pump into close because I got out
If you think it’s not closing above 50 tomorrow your calls are getting IV crushed into oblivion man
Calls or shares
Happens to the best of us
To da moon, if people listened to any of my posts they would have 10 bagger galore this week...I’ve been saying spy calls non stop 

I maintain 370 eow
if PLTR hits $30 I'm hiring a hype midget for my 30th bday
NIO GOING 49
Fuck off ccp
Which ones????

No shit Sherlock I was being a retard and didn’t know it was 7 pm “EST”
Do you guys think PLTR is gonna dip tomorrow before going back up? I've got $450 in shares that've done well for me, but I'm trying to decide when to buy options. I'm thinking 02/19 $17.5 or something like that because I've gotten fucked too many times by weeklies. Thoughts?

This is always the time where my greed kicks in but I will not do it this time. I will be happy holding this NIO $47c exp 2/19/21
I analyzed the stock prices of TSLA and NIO and found that TSLA is about 10 times the worth of NIO, which means that in 10 charts time, NIO will be added into the S&P5000
Why do you think that?!!!
more than two months pay
[deleted]
Someone just dropped 600k on NIO 3/21 42p
If NIO doesn't Moon to $60 lots of people are going to learn about IV crush.
Don't. Be. Fucking. Stupid.

it's implied volatility
+$4500 so far today
Do I get $10 when it does? 

Some kid already owes me a stack when we hit 370 by eow yall better own up
I used to play ATVI over the summer because it was so predictable and literally traded between $78-$85. Now I never know what the thing is doing. It doesn't even move with tech half the time
I don’t see it running past $50 after tomorrow. But earnings should push it forward. So if it closes high I don’t think there will be much of an earnings pump at all.
[deleted]
PTON can blow me, stop being a pussy and just push $108-$111 again I’m not asking for that much am I??
Holy shit NIO faceripping 🤪
A mixture of both
Am I wasting my time with Fisker weeklies?  Though they might be next for some EV meme profits but no real movement.
Baba pls if you go up I’ll hold
NIO has taken off.. Buckle up guys!

This is the way brother. Best of luck. I don't put all my cookies in one jar but if it pays. No worries.

Hope you sold at open lol
Holy molyyyy
Has anyone heard anything from Jack Ma since the IPO was suspended? I'm hoping he'll come out with some good BABA or ANT news (even though he's not the CEO anymore.)
The price of an Nio 50C expiry 11/20 is insane. I really really hope people just take profit regardless right now
Don't know if I'm comfortable buying at 18 though 🤔
There's a ticker called $TWNK "Twinkies" the gayest.
exactly.

why catch a falling knife now when I can rather just miss out on a 5-10% gap up and ride the run to the 340$+ price target this stock deserves

Where do we see NIO EOW? I'm tempted now.
I like the optimism but ban

But of the 2, I feel like Jack Ma gonna be back with a roar so go for BABa

ok, short em then... investments are always forward looking, do you think BA is gonna go bankrupt? do you think Covid will continue to be an issue beyond 2021 with these vaccines available? in a market full of over valued whore shit BA is a legit ass blue chip sitting at 60% of its ATH and you'd be an idiot to bet against them

I closed my contracts earlier and got back on in on the slight pullback to 17.55

NVAX as a smaller company is moving slower but as they wont need to have complicated logistics and also are a single dose vaccine they may reach end user availability before MRNA or PFE. Also informed users will prefer waiting a few months if they can take a nanoparticle vaccine rather than an mRNA vaccine.
MRNA and PFE might end up being used for older folks who are at greater risk of dying from COVID while for younger folks for whom COVID has risks similar to flu , it might be more ethical to wait for a nanoparticle based vaccine. Even if old folks get cancer or Alzheimers in 5-10 years the risk is justified as they may be dead of natural causes in 5-10 years anyway but for young people with their entire lives ahead risking lupus or Alzheimers to prevent a disease which only makes them sick for a week is not a valid tradeoff.
In with 485 shares @25.20 avg. and a lot of Feb, May and Dec $25/30c’s. I’m poor, but hope to catch up soon

He's basically generated an idea and assumes people will think he knows what he's talking about by using lots of words and some science terms.
This is really facts though, bought in 20 minutes ago and already up
I'm scared guys
Unlike rkt there are strong supports moving up everyday with huge investment funds going super long on nio. Like rkt it’s gonna go up over the long term!
https://i.imgur.com/avzQe3H.png
probably some profit taking...
I would say 6+ months unless it goes full TSLA before. lockup period ends in December so some of the employees/big holders will sell some shares. when they report a profit for the first time its going to moon and it will moon and if/when they get a big private client like a major company (bank, pharma, car company)

and if it only profit its a defense stonk with good revenue and shitty margins
$100%
As is custom lmao
If NIO closes above $48 that would be very weird and scary

Buncha wet toilet paper hands

yes
i bought one nio put, prove me wrong nio bulls!
Tax reasons lol I had a January expiry but need to dump everything before EOY, if it went any lower I wouldn't be able to sell. Might pick up a dec expiry call.
I have no clue what to do with this shit.  Everything feels like a FOMO play or is going the opposite direction of where I think it should be going.
OSTK might just hit 60 today
I avoid expensive tech stocks due to my dot.com experience in 1999. I know it’s irrational now and the thinking is similar to gay bears shorting expensive tech.
I feel you

Not with that IV we don’t

Shorting NIO before EOD ? Everybody is saying IV crush. Tell me why not short it isnt it easy money ?
I see so many green stocks. How are we even red
NIO does like +20% on an avg day without beating earnings. I think it goes down regardless though, who tf is looking at a car company selling <10k cars a quarter and thinks 'Psh, 6th largest auto manufacturer by valuation??? this is a steal, load the buy cannons'. I mean, for fucks sake, EV isn't even that new tech anymore. An existing car company with actual earnings and infrastructure could pivot and still beat them to 100k EV's sold.
Sold my ATVI for a small gain and put it in Corsair when it was up 2% made bank. Thinking of getting back into ATVI but mother fuckers are the worst
Im up like 15%

Pltr gang
After not selling my DKNG at a 125% profit, I sold half of my NIO at 112% and I refuse to let myself feel bad if the stock goes up!
This pains me. People here must really hate money.
lmfao, I’m long PLTR. Don’t let a meme stock pumping confuse you into thinking you understood anything. The shit DD above is a lot of words saying little. Congrats on the gains tho! All the best.

No more rumors on TSLA back to AAPL where we don’t need rumors just buy backs
You think VIX gonna go up when we get close to the Georgia run off elections? Market probably won't like a dem senate and it might happen

Surprised no one's talking about FUBO. It's the perfect lotto ticket weekly play
If i sell though on Friday, ill be flagged for day trading (jumped in and out of that Tesla hype this morning). I've got other long positions that should be in good shape...idk, i'm bored and a fucking degen. so is that 90 day ban on day trading worth the gains!? So many questions
why on earth would AFL have 42x call volume? That fucking Aflac duck being bought out?

no ur gonna be rich if you sell before earnings just play the run up don’t gamble
Anybody else looking at CCL calls a year out?

$420 loss is better than a 10K gain as well lol

Which of these two should I dump the full $5,000 into and delete RH:

1) BABA $300c Jan 2022
2) RKT $25c Jan 2022?

Unlike the other guessers that replied to this. I have the real answer. EOY will be 12/31/2020
Literally every stock is at it's 52 week high? Cool! That's my sign to buy!  😎

Wow
Pump time
Honestly the fed is still too involved for a true March style rug pull. You might see a correction but not a rug pull
So li and xpev both did well and people started to pour in to equal out with nio. They all went down with nio when citron shorted them. So although I think we’ll pump on earnings and put will be the play tomorrow. Just letting you know why the price action has been acting the way it has.
That’s what I thought yesterday.. but yeah I think you’ll be fine if u buy now
Who’s playing target earnings?
I think this is keeping up. I sold and rebought.

Never had a problem with them. Interest rate is 2,5% annualized which I think is fair, you won’t find anything cheaper than 2%. Spread depends more on an instrument you trade rather than trading platform, i.e. random small cap stock’s in Spain spread will be much higher than than a spread of e.g. Tesla stock.
Whole market is even
Selling PLTR before close
Yes
Just make sure to pick up atleast a couple of the closer cheap ones gotta have some fun man (:

I don’t understand why I’m addicted to shit-stock FDs when I could just buy SPY calls 4 months out and make money on every trade. 🤦‍♂️ maybe I really am an idiot.
Get into longer dated options. With Democrats in office, they’re gonna play up the corona virus a bit, which means we’ll probably see some big downside days scattered in the foreseeable future. Not saying we won’t trend higher overall, but you don’t want your options to expire on week where the overall market is down
NIO to the moon launching soon ride or die

Historically AMD performs the same way. AMD stayed between 20-25 for a while before jumping to 50-55 and stayed there. Now it's doing the same at 80-85. If you play AMD you should go long when AMD dips below its range. Good luck!

There’s so much misinformation in here that I don’t even know where to start. I think nvax might have more upside as a stock though in the short term

Good to fucking know because the market likes to inverse shit that should make sense but doesnt.
I thought that yesterday when I bought them....
Smart man
I’ve got no brains and have CCL puts
Chin up buddy, it’ll be alright!
Long NVAX shares.

Long CODX shares as we will fucking need to test everyone before we give them an RNA vaccine. You cant give it to people already exposed to COV2

Long TMO as they produce the -80C  freezers needed to distribute the PFE vaccine

Not shorting PFE, MRNA or BNTX as they have retard strength.
If god is my witness this will print big this week

Tbh it probably will pump and then earnings comes out and it dumps. Just so I can pretend I was gonna be rich for one night and wake up early and watch my gains slowly disappear
Yes, i probably am blind because i actually made money off options
I’m losing so much fucking money today.
Andrew Left. The guy is who behind Citron Research (🍋) who set a target price for NIO of $25
Is my pltr call that I bought before the dip gonna print
I played TSLA over summer and even with their amazing ER, my like $30 OTM call, $1k at close, literally opened at 0 lol
if ur gona play it, might as well cover it
BOL!
Lol.
Good luck. Hardware store sales up massively and continue to go up
Dump happens in extended hours today or does the dump happen some time tomorrow?
Are CCL puts free money right now?  Isn’t this a no brainer?
I’m pretty sure PLTR is the next trillion dollar company.
I finally gave up this morning down 50% and cut my losses damn
GUYS WTF IS BABA DOING AND WHY THE FUK NO ONE BUYING IT ?!
"portfolio" LMFAO
def not, the time to short them was march. they will be back to fully operational by june of 2021 and they are sitting at 60% of where they were the last time that was true
I had good reason, it was outperforming RIOT back when I bought those. I just didn't check the recent comparison.
PUTS IT IS
You and 99.99% of this sub but that shit sells
NIO gang, rotate out of options into shares before earnings. You'll still get a nice bump if it does well but won't be IV crushed
Can we get a dip to 355 pls? I got these cheeseburgers
transition out of everything into BABA
Don't call me retard you retard.
I've stopped avg down on baba, it's like burning money
If I was that rich I'd just stand up, pull out my cock and say, "suck it you poors" and slap the camera with it

I think that’s one reason they got so many pre orders from India, UK, etc.. I know they stock is crazy up already but hope it suppresses 200 once they release phase 3 results I guess early next year

I didn't expect that 109.7% gain at all. Shoulda bought more than 2...
I am down 40%.
If it was not a meme, flat from here. Since it is a meme, I will go with 100$ end of week
BABA...
Will PLTR keep going tmrw? Tune in to find out

Your temporary lack of judgement has been forgiven as likely caused by wrong dose of add-eral. Welcome back to team GME. Fasten your seatbelt again, cover those paper hands with diamand gloves. Get some Eniya or Bjork in the background and enjoy the view while slowly moving up the roller coaster
Same which is why I also bought them.
60c retard checking in
AH...
We need some stimmy up in here
AH retard
Time for them to crush our premiums shake us out then scoop up our crushed contracts 😫
Thanks
Is AZN announcing data tomorrow at the London conference or is this fake news?
Maybe Q3 isn't a quarterly report. Maybe it was the friends we made along the way...
BUY THE FCEL DIP WE'RE GONNA NIO
close above $18 is all I ask
Dude everyone fucking knows that. They even said it themselves. Clearly no one gives a shit, Soros and Cathy just bought a fuck ton of shares knowing this
That was a 4g swing for 50 cents of share price?
Okay for anyone reading this. I am playing Lowe's earnings. I am going puts. Fuck you market makers and SEC with your market manipulation.
😂fax
PLTR 19c weekly...should i hold or gtfo?
So can inflation and debt crash the market 🤡🤡🤡 where should I put my money in after shit coin or gold?
Wow that was alot to take in. I've been doing long calls for about a year now but there's definitely more I need to learn still it seems!  In your experience, does selling covered calls make more money than just buying long calls? 

Also with selling calls, if theres a large spike one day, aren't you losing that gain since your shares will be called away?
Among other things
Just bought a $300 Jan call.

Does anyone remember last summers Netflix earnings LOL
Kings dont microwave pizza rolls you fuckin pleeb lol
Up 110% on my Feb 21 calls I love shady data companies now

If you are Filipino and you speak Tagalog (Filipino language) BABA means down🗿
Gonna buy the dip on PACB
why do we even play options when u can literally just buy any stock right now and make 20% returns in 1 week
I remember when RKT was in its “buy at any cost” phase too before shedding 50% of its value

I know PLTR and RKT aren’t remotely similar businesses, but most people on here don’t have more than vague ideas about what they do anyway
Somewhere between 10 and 30.
PLTR STRIKE EXP?
What if NIO just blasts like 100% just to spite Citron and Elon
50
kidney stock?
Xpev is releasing their new gen of cars this friday 11/20. If NIO earnings go bad, XPEV is the captain now.
😞same maybe tomarrow we gap up
Shares are going to be way easier to hold. Throw in most now, save some for when we consolidate is what I am trying to do...
More bears trying to get out of this alive is all I see here
don't do it amzn. go back up
Yes it does sir. YES IT FUCKING DOES GET THESE GAINS
I think we're all seasoned veterans by now, so for any new stragglers left, here's the simple reason you make more money with weeklies:

Same strike, but you can buy more contracts.

Your money literally multiplies faster.

The downside? There is no downside.
1$
All out of steam, take profits boys!
Congrats you gonna be big rich
sell them more
RKT isn't EV pussy

Everyone here acts like a low vix is bullish, but it's the exact opposite. Big selloffs happen when fear is the lowest.

Seems counter-intuitive, but it's an actual phenomenon of the market.
I did already. Wait 30 mins then come ask me how I k ew
My friend cover calls are for pussies

Selling FD pltr puts on every dip to retards
Donkey Kong always had my wee wee up 80%
I’ve got nothing left to lose I’m holding on
Why do new stocks get insane valuation when others that do the exact same thing for years have the following;

- Consistently growing revenue
- Adjusted Guidance
- Reputation

For example, TDC does the exact same thing as PLTR but PLTR is already priced above TDC in terms of valuation and is sky rocketing further with hardly any income...?  SNOW is another one in the same Big Data sector where it's insanely overvalued?  Is the market just retarded?
Everyone just wants in on the eventual RIP to 300. The issue is that with China giving Jack Ma the evil eye over his comments on ANT, that may take a while.

The moment the government comes out and okay's ANT's IPO, and Jack Ma looks relatively unscathed, it will rip multiple 10% up days for sure.

Injecting proteins has its own inherent risk my dude. Rouge proteins are the source of most neurodegenerative diseases. mRNA, I’d like an algorithm trying to destroy the virus, other way is pouring bleach on it. Both kill it but have downsides.

The main reason mRNA was stuck was a data block couldn’t process enough to have effective models and that’s been blown through now.
Been like this all year baby
Don't say that :( she resisted the dip and is gapping up a little
Holy shit, there are people with Nio 60 c weeklies

Can't wait to be disappointed -- got 12/18 170c just in case things don't go as planned.

This morning's stock activity from HD/WMT make me a bit cynical, but I think it's important that the bad retail numbers sell off has already been priced in.

Hope it pops.
So, puts on the menu?
and then i did it. 

I swiped up to buy. A single $SPY 200p 11/20. 

I whisper to myself, "surely this will print. the bulls have no idea what's about to hit them"

I microwave a plate of pizza rolls.

I take a whiff and think to myself

What a pleasure it is, to be king.
My portfolio doesn't deserve NIO to be honest
absolutely
Alexa play goldy
Outside of this recent move mines been doing the same.
So you should say buy puts if the market is going down. Go get the dunce cap and sit in a corner.

PLTR to 20 baby! lets goooooo!

Never investing in any Chinese stock again after this BABA debacle lol fuck

Down 50% on Jan calls. Not sure whether to hold or sell. Seems risky to dump anymore money in.
Wow PLTR dip got eaten up from 17.80 back to 18.20
Now this is what I call a great PLTR paper hand filter. Make those panic sell at 18, thinking it will drop to 17 so they can buy back, and letting those who really want to get in get in at 18.
I mean if we get like a red day of 1 or 2% I will hop in. Not expecting like a 10% drop lol
Bet you’re 🌈
🍋 is getting fucked on his short position
how could anyone call this a dip lmfao spy is down .4%

BA WOW!
what's the play
When did they buy in, and have you considered recommending a covered call for them to limit risk and give an exit point? Feb 2021 is offering solid premiums up in the 23-25 range.
I didn’t check any charts after open, what was the pump the last 3 hours about??
My $50c 12/04 says you would be crazy not to!
Why is no one talking about oil stocks.  They have the money machine on right now.
Lol see you in 2 weeks
OK. Agree. Is there anywhere they have to publish their activities? Seems strange if not....

Alternatively, set a market order and it'll fill.

I see. I follow along with Steven van metre's thesis on youtube. But QE is deflationary, and the last stimmy did nothing for liquidity. It all went to savings and debt bills. 

Fed's last qe's didn't help them reach inflation targets. They only drive interest rates down, which could help inflation ONLY if it leads to increased lending

Unless Xbox can import these popular jap titles they r fucked in the anus.   

It doenst matter if xbox has 10 graphics card in it if people cant play uncharted/bloodborne/horizon zero dawn etc etc   nobody would buy that piece of shit console
Priced in
Im eyeing some jan 300s
Im barely green.  Irritated that all the ridic OTM options that I've shorted over the last 2 weeks or so aren't dying

PLTR DUMPING
No problem! If you ever have any questions you can always hit me up and I'll try and answer them whenever possible. I also do run a free investing discord server, if you are interested that is (though It can get rowdy at times lol).
Missed out on platr today looks like it's going down now should I buy under 18 or wait for a bigger dip
😯
Yeh there isn’t anything to fear anymore, world peace otw along with cure for cancer
I didn’t, it didn’t go through thank God
Dec 24 NIO call spreads 47 and 60...bought for 350ish each. Wish me luck
I’m up $2.78 on Ford stock.  AMA
Only way i see is AMC calls plus a vaccine announcement plus positive news feedback
Not good
If you don't buy this PLTR dip you must hate money.
[deleted]
It will be months and BABA will move very slowly, we all got fucked
He could also win post-mortem so technically they never have to pay him lol
[removed]
If a crash were to happen in the near future, would you buy puts or calls?
pltr 25 eow and 50 eom?
[removed]
$DHI looking like a buy, but long-dated expiration if you're looking at options. Also unusual activity on XLY, which I think is a good trade for the next weeks / months
I need CCLto dump already....
I think so, BA appears to be on a moon mission. That said, I generally tend to inverse my own thinking and it works well, so do with that what you feel is appropriate
tsla stuck at 444
waiting for the dip
PLTR cancelled. Melting down 5 eod
How aren’t you a billionaire yet?
pltr 20 EOW :)
put option being exercised maybe?
oh no pltr boys we got too cocky
Imagine mango lives to 110 and this guy strokes out before then?

I just hope smart folk like you will share your wisdom here in tendie town so I can afford to put my kids through college
But there's already treadmills n shit there

Anybody else playing RIDE?
Calls hopefully?
Avg down if possible 
Holding $500c that’s down -64%
Roll to a further Way strike I’d say 30s any time after 1/15/2020 would be solid to grab and hold until expiry.
Uhh no retard? I'm in calls and relying on it. I want them to fraud into existence 69 million car deliveries this quarter. Fuckkkit
Every stock I sell goes to the moon....😭
Sooo puts ?
Uhhh
It’s all about when you buy
They sold a whole 7 cars this time?!?! Damn fine work, totally surpassed our expectations of 1 car this quarter. Definitely worth tens of billions of dollars.
Facts sqaured
7 PM tonight ET. so 4 PM CA time. Get the popcorn ready. This bitch is moving one way or another.
please just one -3% day please, that's all I ask.
Buy the dip!!
Flag to tell insiders to sell.
Nope, losing money as usual.
450%
PLTR how we feeling
to the MOOOOON
Buy wall too big at 18 imo.
I get that. Just hurts having my finger on the trigger and not buying - and now being down 10% on SaaS shares

Edit: after losing $7.2K on SPY FDs in mid-Sept lol
Top is in.
TGT earnings all in

rip my calls

BABA will go back up, it's just a matter of how much pain it'll deal out before it does. Ugh
I remember, the sub went private and only the cool kids were allowed in.
I bought Bonds like a boomer.
It would be nice to see it again
What kind of bullshit bear market is this? Where is my 5% red day?
Imagine going to work not on amphetamines 🤢

Okay, BABA is officially gay. Jesus Christ

Hi
you've got a bad case of paper hands and fomo.  
do not feel bad for you.   
Take off your pants.

On the real: do real DD & have price limits? the market's not going away.
Point 72 also bought 29 million shares.
Remember when BA was 90 a share in March?
NIO WILL HIT 50 AND YOU WILL BEND THE FUCKING KNEE BEARS.
buy after it ran 15%? this is how you lose money.
What's the RKT situation?
Yes

WOOF
I just want it to go back to 18.60 so I can make a cool hundred because I’m poir
VIX still green on the day and my VXX/UVXY garbage is down 45% lol
I’m a weee 16 year old noob pumping into nio cause yall hyping me up about it. Wish yall luck
lol
Easier to make money on puts because stocks plummets faster and then take forever to go back up. See the case of NIO
What are we buying today boyzzz?
Strike?
Bound to go up, but needs something to trigger the move upwards (e.g. favorable news on Ant Group IPO resumption)
My inner voices are working against each other. One says to buy 10K worth of Pltr 17P FDs - the other says to wait for a red day and buy back into PLTR. Either way I am legit a dumbass
Stocks are so depressing. Record money made the last two weeks and here i am hoping  I don’t blow my account for the second time on zoom lmaoooo🔫
TWLO is too low
What was that TSLA 460 spike a few mins ago about? 🤔
Contact tech support.
We still holding $23c 1/15/21 pltr boissssss
Does IV crush also affect puts negatively? New to options.

Personally, it is a play I wanna stay out of since I am a noob and also don't want to bet against the "retard" strength

💎🤚🖐 this shit guys bears still got a little fight left they coming for their shorts loooool
1.4 mil in nio 60C expiring april 4th. i think they are doing to avoid the ridiculous theta. so don't get in weeklies. nio's expected move is 20% so you're gonna get burned if you in weeklies.
It got pretty close this morning in PM.
Yes. Every paycheck I'll probably be picking up more. Even at $30 I think it is a great opportunity. One thing people haven't been talking about enough is Palantir's interview process. It is OD as fuck. So they hire smart people.

What happened to the guy who bought a ton at 11 at ipo? Hope he didn't sell when it hit $9
We still have time
See HB Gary
NIO don’t fade bby, you’re so sexy
Hard to say. Risky shit man. Why not open up a strangle? Earnings could be great but the stock still takes a massive shit. Other way around is possible too.
This here, ask your parents to co sign a loan for you, try to get somewhere between 50-100k and then throw it all into PLTR 20c 11/20.

PLTR to the moon $25
$BA. Let’s gooooo 🚀🚀🚀
Yeah. Wonder why it’s going up now
Most likely will eclipse 50.
12/11 60c NIO, should I sell for a slight loss to avoid IV Crush. First time playing earnings. Been doing great with NIO but bought this at 52 Friday. I have some 50c 2/19 think those will be safe.
buy the dip
Really can’t wait to read the “omg my calls are up 400% and they missed by -100%”
Pltr not dumping is very bullish imo
Until after my 01/15 calls expire worthless.
Imagine shilling a bankrupt company

This is maybe the dumbest sticky post I've ever seen.  Sony literally can't keep up with demand.  Both are good plays for the holidays.  I've been having a lot of success playing swings on Sony.
Woulda, coulda, shoulda
Same as in the casino
holding overnight every night forever
BABA whyy 😭
I don’t know if you are serious or not but not too long ago there was a mass exodus where only a select group of core users were allowed into a private sub. Mainly because of shit like OP.
That battle for NIO @ 48 tho
What is going on with it should be easy money
[deleted]
We must all do our part to keep PLTR afloat
Yep
Did the same. Got burned last time when all EV dropped and lost a lot of profit. Small gains 🤝
Alright bois it’s officially time to get in on the BABA call train. Chooo chooo
TGT gonna be green in a bit. Hop on tendie train for earnings NOW
MMs about to make their 32nd move, initiating the next leg down
Should i sell my 11/27 calls?

$16
Yeah...I actually like Palantir but I don't really like being in WSB meme stocks. Hmmm....maybe I'll sell a put.
Only down 14%, w the way it’s trading IV will keep them afloat unless it decides to rip up another 15% but I’ll have locked out these puts by then
This is exactly what I am going for.
We can always count on Moscow Mitch to pull his weight.
It will sell off . Nio will
Pop
And sell off will run with it

Got drunk last night and slept for 14 hours, all the while waking up in-between dreaming about PLTR. You're welcome.

Really?  

The Midwestern line worker, the Amazon delivery guy/gal is going to benefit from this?  

Only 35% of the US has a college degree.  That population has a higher income, and projected much higher lifetime income, than the rest of the population.  

This is completely bass-akwards; you are asking the poorer, less educated population to subsidize the upper middle to upper class.

You're assuming she's even still here
isnt earnings tomorrow
Moon. Starting to see action going into power hour. Will hold through earnings unless it miraculously gets to 54 a share again.
diamond hands, don't try to convince me not to hold
PLTR 3 hours ago
Anybody else surprised we didn’t see a run on TSLA today with that news? People have been waiting on it for a while now. I expected to see $500 tested today
Exclusives is the name of the game now, MSFT has 0
XOM looking good
Prolly what I’m going to do honestly. I’d rather keep my profits, even though my calls ITM, then put my faith on NIO beating the ER trend (IV crush, dump).
he got in at $460
I'd be happy with a 48 finish on NIO, but a 50 would make me cream
Never hold thru earnings
Since the past 3 days, DPZ just ramps up at open and then dumps just to flatline all day.
105 here
Not even openenin weekend yet boiiiiik
I’ll add you on as a co-author.
DKNG you fucking beauty
Same dumbasses who sold their TSLA shares and calls because it lost a few percent when they KNOW this shit is gonna rock all the way to Christmas.
The idea that I'm some sort of shadowy short seller just because I don't think active funds are going to immediately bring their portfolios in line with the S&P 500, is, to be quite charitable, fucking retarded.
Lol, how on god's green earth is forgiving a shit ton of student loan debt and freeing a lot of people of a second mortgage a bad thing?

I swear some people would curse Dems if they sent out $100 bills and folded them the wrong way.

I know our household would suddenly have ~$450 a month freed up and for households with two student debt bag holders it's more than that. You want to stimulate the economy, put hundreds of their dollars back in their accounts every month.
Want to wait for the earnings. Question: How do you read earnings report? (how to know if it's good or bad)
PLTR time to BTFD
No
Ye, but check out if you sell 1 put how much you can get
Just saw it, crazy smh 🤦‍♂️

Explain to me how we can go down 20% on NIO but we can’t fucking go up 20% on NIO this shit autistic
Same! Im up 5% overall, yet Nasdaq is up like 0,2% lol. NIO, CRSR, PLTR, TQQ, SBE, BLNK, RIDE!!!!
Sorry can you ELI5. I understand the basics of it but I don’t understand how I get a profit from that.
Me
I can imagine. Why?
nvda u suk big cock and balls
*grabs mic* IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING MY NIO 50C. 

IM NOT FUCKING LEAVING. THE SHOW GOESSSSS ONNNN
everyone is holding pltr overnight right?
Me. Earnings will be good, I'm also selling some options to cash in on IV crush. But I'll let my shares/leaps ride. Leaps aren't ITM yet and shares are shares so...
earnings was really promising looks like a strong company
I have 2
Possibly, but most likely not since someone exercising early is throwing their theta in the trash
I got 10 :)
$40K in stonks
nothing better then printing money and laughing at PLTR memes with ur bros
My calls concur
IWM. So hot right now.
I went in today. It's at march levels
Nvm getting fukt right now...
How many days do I have to wait around until baba pumps?
Same.. we goin to the moon soon though?

CVS calls 2/21

sold my calls already and its put time
It's really nice having an investing account to buy shares to self medicate FOMO while having an options account for degenerate YOLOs
PLUG what are you doing baby girl? Don’t hurt me again please.
I always by weeklies/monthly’s, last Friday for whatever reason I decided I would buy PLTR Leaps which I had never bought before. Fast forward to today I’m up $600 but if I had bought the options I usually purchase, I would be up 7k. Gains are gains I guess
Shhhhh don’t give my secrets away.
theta gang wins 80-90% of the time. it's just hindsight that pltr went parabolic

.
Sold my 225s for next week early today too. My shit luck. Lol
CRSR’s making me want to quit being a wage slave
Twitter guy is a 🤡
I sold NIO very very little gain but fuck if it goes down after market I’ll be screwed tmr. I’ll hate myself if it moons but at least I won’t lose any more
Ok so do we do what we did on pltr earnings and sell naked calls on Nio?
Selling all but a single lotto ticket
what is derogatory about an erection?
I'll YOLO on SPY all the way to my skivvies if they forgive the whole nut or permaban.
Like what
no, you'll get assigned on the long leg but you'll be selling the short leg anyway so it cancels out and the difference is your loss
MMs selling you a dream at the top??
And you know what to do. Btfd
Pltr needs to go back up just a bit pls to like 18.50 or 60 pls
Holy fuck GDRX got railed today. All because of the Amazon competition. Gee whiz, this may be an opportunity to enter though. Thoughts?
Thank you!
Palantir is already DEEP into the govt. Deep State. They’ve been around for almost 2 decades already
Thoughts on AXTI?
Everyone said a Biden presidency would sink them. Also had concerns over client onboarding costs and being a 17yo company that’s never turned a profit

So much regret, I bought some lame SaaS IPO
Lesson learned.. maybe
Zoom out
that gets the retard award nominee 2020
amazon could always enter apples space, but i dont think the opposite is true
CVX or COP.

CVX 95 leaps could be good too.
Saying it's just the beginning for PLTR. 

Like getting in NIO at $10. Both are on a tear.
hmm yes that is my modus operandi for sure...but not sure this time for some reason. cheers
holy shit NIO breakout finally occurring -- LI and XPEV not even budging
it's dead yo, it's dead
Wow whoever called HIMX Thank you. Up 40% in a few mins
Did BA news break or something
Morepheus: How did I make bank?

NIO: You... you're too smart.

Morepheus: Do you believe that my having gains has anything to do with my brain on this app? *swipes through a dozen OTM calls on robinhood, TSLA, GME, HD, PLTR 35c 12/1* 

...do you think that's money you're losing?
Get in on pltr and save ur portfolio
Everything's mooning today it's crazy. JMIA, RIOT, and PLTR already made me coomed like 5 times 😩
Nope, have a moderate equity position on Corsair. Been riding it for the last month
What does PLTR actually do? Just make me tendies?
Not even joking the employees. Tech employees are ultra uber liberal. Like outdo yourself for how liberal you can be kind of liberal. Wayfair a walk out last year cause corporate sold beds to border patrol. Google employees lost their shit a few years ago when Google took a govt AI contract.
I’m not fucking selling
Means you fucked for doing the right thing
FCEL wants to run.
Nio will close at at least 49.
Fuck your student loans just pay your bills
This is what people don't understand about trading options.  You need to leave your usual, safe investment accounts alone.  Gambling is only for money you're willing to lose.  Unless you're fine with losing your savings, or a portion of them, don't play this game.  The way I see it is if I end up with some lucky plays, I'm playing with house money.  Using options as a get rich quick scheme and blowing everything on it is stupid.
Tomorrow
What are the odds it plummets tonight after earnings ?
Nothing happened
someone lost their money and is mad about it, taking it out on us poor wsb boys

Nahh i did the same move... looks like it went up too fast this morning attracted to many shorts and scalps. Ill go back in at 19 and hold long again :)
YOU KNOW IM HOLDING THROUGH EARNINGS

Anyone know Boeing MAX hearing? is it today?
I bought naked calls, then sold the strike under me for the cost of my calls + the difference in strike. If they expire otm I keep the difference in strike. Initial risk of loss of principle was when I was naked, in this position there is no loss of principle since max loss is 0. However my gains are capped at 1k
Almost got in at 205, now regretting. This thing is going to pump 10+%
Hell naw, but people will definitely take profits
Yea on ccl puts lmao
What does that mean if people have paid off their loans? Notta?

naw bishhh hold that down till Jan.
Nah bezos is doing that but with people trying to buy it up lol
The main and only consideration iirc is whether or not you want to continue holding shares or just exit of position. Only exercise at expiration though, otherwise you’re wasting your premium
Lmao McConnell would have a brain aneurysm

Yesterday I passed on NIO, PLTR, KNDI, XPEV, and LI....I chose FSR

If your account isn't green for the day, I think you picked all the wrong things.
given the situation, that's probably not a high bar to clear
PLTR bulls just went over to NIO real quick. Back to moon mission tomorrow.
oh nio and pltr i'm cooming sweet baby jesus
I was pretty drunk at the time. Palantir confuses me. Isn’t there already a shit ton of data mining companies already?
I sold my weeklies when it hit 17 and looked initially like I pegged it right. 1.50 increase later...holy hell. And unfortunately I bought the weeklies yesterday at the peak :/.
APHA looking decent today
48!
Just like.....
SDC baby! 15 eow

I feel stupid for asking but how did $4,000 turn in to $33K with tesla only going up 13.21%?
QQQ 1/15/21 280p's were just bought. 8k of them for a total of 6.1m.

Alexa play Midnight Sonata movement 3
how much of an spy index would tesla makeup?
Iron condor on NIO perhaps?
Is anyone losing money today?
Anytime a stock moves up a lot with no news on the way that's a sign to take profit. The S&P was cool but unless you had leaps you weren't likely holding TSLA calls anyways.
Link?
They do have a few fiascos- major ones. And yeah, but past price doesn't determine the future. Ge used to be rather expensive.
All they have to do is lie tho lol
:(
50 or my name ain’t Lebron James
Yum
theres a song by 2 chains you need to check out called "watchout"... it goes like " watchout lil bitch, you getting mad... im getting rich" thats gonna be my song to you after you buy those dumbass puts
I heard acquiring tesla
Might not be worth getting their hands dirty in that sort of business
NIO please commit a legendary act of fraud tonight.
Bought 30 shares last night with my NIO profits. (I am a pussy who’s to scared to do options). Thinking about taking my 15% or whatever and running
Ahh haha nice I’m in PLTR too but didn’t make enough to buy a new car. Wanted to see if u bought the 18 call I sold yesterday that’s up 400%. In on 10 March leaps so even if my shares get called away I’m chilling
thanks PFE for the unwanted VTRS shares showing up my portfolio
man nio is riding that 47.99 like some cheap Chinese whore
Zoom out a bit. It was $3,900 six months ago.
Thanks for the advice regardless! Gonna buy some
My calls hope not
420 & $TSLA 

buy PUTs, PUT spreads or sell CALL spreads when above 420 and close @ 420 or below. Buy CALLs, CALL spreads or sell PUT spreads when below 420 and close @ 420 or above... \*\*\*work until it doesn't

BABA PLZ!!!!!!!
who are these idiots selling nio when it’s clearly on a moon mission
Bezos seems like the kind of guy who would love the idea of poor and mentally challenged people losing their money trying to short AMZN, he should consider a stock split to facilitate this

In yesterday at $15.72 and out today at $20.22

Hoping it drops this week to buy some more, I do see promise with the sports gambling for sure. Hopefully my short term quick gains didn’t destroy any chance of long term success

I assume you meant Dec 16 2022? Because Dec 16 2020 is a month away and I don't see an option chain for that date. It's far enough out that IV probably won't change a ton.

Breaking NIO news: “NIO licks $48 butthole, decides it’s not for it”

So how we doing here?

Fine, what oil do I buy into
Gonna go down more when PIPE hits. Has good upside when it does.
Well that’ll do it! Damn. I’m not holding enough of it
NVDA lagging the day before earnings is making me feel better about tmrw
I had 1000 shares of pltr at 10.19, sold for a loss at 9.40 because of these retarded pundits on CNBC and shit fucking jackasses get paid tens of thousands for retarded inputs
I think I may have bought an iron condor
Positions or ban

48!
Isn’t 737 approval coming soon? People might think the worst is behind them. After all it was a $340 stock, still a lot of upside in the long run
Bought 500 shares at 9.79 baby WE HAWT
NIO is the one we have been waiting for!
IT HIT 48
It’s short for Cuckdaddy
Loved that "YOLO" at the end.
You belong here.
Yes
I’ve gotta be honest I wasn’t sure about NIO earnings in which way it’s gonna go but after this rally it’s definitely pointing to a sell off AH imo.

A massive gain followed by a massive sell seems very possible.

Best of luck to all that have the balls to hold.
300 11/27. 😂
Rumors saying Janet Yellen could serve under Mnuchin's role in Biden admin
Tesla stroking its flaccid peen to NIOs green steel beam and watching in awe
I bought some Calls dont even know what the company does
😓
Link?
even after this 18% day? chill, i got 100 shares sold a call and bought a put to hedge
Bad reception from earnings I guess. It’s a monster of a company though and has been on a tear so I’ll gladly welcome a pullback to reload on shares. This company is a forever hold
twitter is a garbage dump
lol I'm trying to forget about my hundreds of 2013 shits
Just a little bit higher PLTR comment ratio, and will be time for aggressive puts.

I'm thinking the same, except I don't think it'll go that low. I'll look to pick some up in the 15 range
Question. What's stopping FB or GOOG or MSFT doing what PLTR is doing? Does PLTR really have a big enough moat?
https://twitter.com/deitaone/status/1328768121679867906?s=21
I been averaging in. 50 shares in. Started buying on margin hoping same thing
Anytime I’ve had dreams about a stock tanking, I wake up to the fattest green days.
Yeah i put 500€ on that thing and its up 10% in 2 days
You guys liking my APHA pick?
So similar.
The math checks out.
pltr price upgrades when?
Explain me how people on this subreddit think. 4k in bank aint enough. lets gamble it all and end up with maybe 0 and no food.
Kandi makes you dandy
Buying tops and selling bottoms since day 1..
Almost bought 1,100 shares of PLTR at $9.70 on 10/16...

I want to throw up. Missed $10k in **fucking share gains, not options**
Got a couple years?
So is 257 solid support for Baba?
Lmfaoo
idk. you might be paying for unnecessary time. get in january but get out by december i guess.

NIO is going to moon to close after that fark
Knows get on and get out
byebye to your portfolio
What’s nio closing at ?
Paid 18.80 it’s at 12.40
Yesterday at 3pm ET, Biden gave a briefing about his economy recovery plan. He emphasized his plan to install 500k EV charging stations to boost economy and employment. 10% bump immediately after that.

Then, this morning, they announced a partnership with Apple. Another 10% bump.

I'm ecstatic.
Probably will drop cause I have calls. That being said, LI and XPEV both mooned on earnings. NIO backed by Chinese gov. TSLA just added to s&p 500. Idk. I’m weirdly confident but also scared
Peaked
Yes
Anyone have BABA calls? I’m getting destroyed lol I really hope it moons

Nah bro you probably should maybe not sure go ahead

Lmfaoo
Who is swinging NIO through ER?
POWELLS DONE, NOW WE DUMP
About to cook up 370
We're saying PLTR is at the beginning of the rise.  Like getting in on NIO at $10.
sell a call with a close strike to take profits.
Bought some SPY 369 for the lols. Will be funny if it actually hits though.
✨ok✨
Yeah why..? Weird
Same here brother I have them laddered down to $14 just in case this turns out to be the LK of EV lol
There is no more trading today it’s just theta taking your bitch until earnings AH. Plan accordingly
Sure, anything to help out🤣
My bad. Guess I've been having a few of those today (arguments that is). Tbh, I don't know what the deal entails. Don't think she'll get kicked, just will have to part with her controlling stake
Looks like 2 and change to me, and up a full dollar from yesterday's lows, maybe you meant 7% up?
Every day. It is known, i didn’t know people were still betting against the market. Silly
Take out some pay day loans and continue to trade.
[deleted]
Just sell a cash secured put at $15 and collect premium to wait for the dip
Deal
Good job being a fighter and not giving up

Darn it.. now I will do the same and end up losing more money..
Sounds like you’re going to bore the hell out of your grandson
Proof
I saw 👀
When are those earnings coming out buddy?
Auto with paddle shifters is the way to go fam
Shut up gay bear
[deleted]
it's not that it's worth more than 400, it's just that it'll go higher than 400
Chi Coms will juice earnings to pump the price up higher.  NIO is their prestige brand and the high valuation is free adverting.  They have no reason not too.
I've been holding 93 shares I bought at $296. 7 days of red. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
Already did u missed it
You joking brah. No way someone tell this is fake
[deleted]
Looks like the perfect chart for a buy high sell low strategy
selling $50 strike NIO calls come get them
Masterpiece!
Spy calls? 370 eod
NIO is here to stay.
**RUG PULL INBOUND**
I'm not going to buy PLTR until it dips. Its RSI is over 70 for 2 weeks. Insane that people buy now. Due for a correction. But as soon as it dips to like $13, I'm going all in.
Thx!
SE getting dumped
Nice. Good luck

We probably up trend into EOD, all the pussies are out
I accidentally opened up a TD account and like the retard i am opted to use margin. so when i started buying stock i was unknowingly taking out margin as well.

I quickly learned about this. Luckily I got out after some months and made some tendies and the interest wasn't that bad, but damn, never again...
Agree
meant 2022
Yeah I heard some insider news that it’ll go up, and down, and up, and down, maybe sideways, then up again
When?
NIO...

He's beginning to believe.
SE pls, what is you doing baby
Yay, my call I bought at open is up a bit
Buy high, hold for 20ish hours and sell low.  Dont question yourself brother, you’re doing this right.
Nah its not. He would be lucky if he bought calls instead of shares. 13% increase to a dude who has 100k in rh and is holding 100% tesla shares is not significant enough to be lucky
? TRUMP >> FUCK IWM   
BIDEN >> IWM IS AMERICA
I cut my losses for -900 on 265c weeklies today. If it runs it runs but I couldn’t keep buying the dip. Still in for 12/24 290c though
why is SPY still at 361? I expect 420 by friday
Some stocks like TUP have had 3000% bottom to top growth this year and go completely under WSB's radar.
Just sell an iron condor and profit off of IV crush
Honestly I don’t want to give you bad advice because I am not that confident and experienced. Normally i check rsi and if the stock is just going up on pure hype or there’s some news

At this rate, you should be able to retire to your private island by early next year!
What's your cost basis?
sell the next option up, turn it into a spread.
nvda? where's the pump rn. i need my fds to hit
Imagine not buying PLTR below 50.

But maybe people just don't want to be future billionaires by investing in the future megacorp that unifies them all under it's banner to effectively rule the world.
Every time no question about it do it full send
NIO earnings leaked. They beat 700%
ass up now, little doggy
Nope. Holding Jan calls at multiple strikes at least till Xmas.

Got 2 1/15/21 15c PLTR up 110% hold fa sho right
Zoooooom baby! New lockdowns lets go!

hmm 16% or 6%?
No

wont be too bad
Whose dick do we have to suck in China to make this go back up?
Tomorrow. 265 EOW.
Alright best of luck. Went theta and sold 250c to eat some profit.
What if they don’t?
I feel like it'd be retarded to buy more PLTR here, but I'm quite tempted.
Nope, not as much as 30 days or 60 days out
qqq not spy; every vaccine pump will fuck your puts
I’m curious, how often do unusual options activity actually lead to something?
Nio market cap isn’t that much you fuckin poors. 60 eow
Next time Boeing dips, I'm going all in
I made some shit plays but still up today.
Good to know that you haven’t gone full retard
I seriously think the market is all about timing now. Patience is a warriors greatest ally.
I really need someone to tell me definitively... is NIO going to drop after earnings or not?!

I may or may not inverse you cause I suspect you’re bullshitting so please be honest.
Putting your last of your losing account into a stock that just went +15% on the day. Makes sense you only have that much left.
Balls in calls

I’ve been holding this for a while and was wondering what the green surge has been about. Haven’t seen any news to justify it. Maybe investors expecting deal to close soon?

NVDA being super fake and gay today
Last name r fuk first name not me
Usually it's 6 months. I've played a lot of ipos so idr when they did. Another redditor said it Feb
🔥🔥🔥
Well I just did a huge yolo today. Was up about 3k in 10 minutes. Now I'm down 6.5k. If you day trade and sell at the right time it can play out huge. Otherwise you can end up sitting around and praying to just recoup some losses.
I see what you did there
I like to sell my options at losses so I don't have to look at them while they're down.
There is literally 0 confidence in nio calls being profitable to hold tonight.

That's why I am
Nah you should be good
Realistic PLTR EOY predictions?
Put your dick in it.
Yeah long term they might be fucked but it’s still oversold rn and they’ll still be used at other pharmacies. It’s still just a trade I’m looking to make 5-10 %
Thanks Dad.

If you’d asked me at IPO, I’d have been disappointed if it didn’t hit 100 within a year. I still stand by it

Any other stock, sure. I think BA flies on this news
Happy to see it running up now!
Pretty close to it

"It's only money." (As long as you are not borrowing cash to invest / risking any of your margin money, or using funds that you need to satisfy other financial obligations.)

At least that's what I've been telling myself to sleep at night. Lost a significant amount of savings since May this year. Getting better. I've learned a lot however the lessons have been so expensive.

You will get it back through patient study, risk management and practice.

Buy $IEP you cowards
Everyone told me NIO at $10 sucked. People are idiots...including me cause I listened to people here and sold.

I will never sell PLTR.
Holy hell this market is nuts. How are DJI and Russel 2000 at ATH?

These stocks moving 10% a day on no news is legit nuts.
You took it from yourself.
Don't shit your pants bulls when NIO dies after earnings.
I think it will be flat

Wouldn't it be better to play Q4 earnings and get those options a bit more far dated
How do you tell a pump and dump?
It’s a sign you should load up on $FSR shares
Puts it is after this 4% run up
I got in since $9 with shares and calls
love to see it
It's possible to invest responsibly though.
Everyone in PLTR while I’m over here making money on PRPL 🤫.
The UK has retards and autists too
The NIO/TSLA pair trade seems to have 3 levels:

0.15-0.2

0.1

0.05-0.03

My grandson won’t believe bears ever actually existed
Pull up two charts: NIO and PLTR

Now compare the monthly and stfu.
I sit back in my rocketship as we blast off to the moon, I look out the window at all the bears and cash gang left behind. 

There’s still time to join us, PLTR isn’t even at 20 yet 🚀
So how does one profit from all this? hehehe
[deleted]
Because of all the NIO confidence here, I am scared for my calls
I’m up 40% on my SPY calls but can’t take profit because of day trade restrictions lol.
Why are there so many retard bulls clinging to the idea of ZM being worth $400. There are so many undervalued stocks that will spike once we return to a sense of normalcy but you cling to the idea that a stock that’s up like 10x in a year has more room to go up
My puts going to print watch

AINT SELLING MY NIO PUTS! I hate money
Mass extinction event.
What a reasonable price target for PLTR?
Wouldn't that be a classic sell the news event? It popped up from 180 to 208 in a few days. I would think it would stay flat or a bit of profit taking
you listen to the wrong people
PLTR AND DKNG WHAT A BEATIFUL TWO SETUPS

Nice. I sold at about $454. You beat me :)
He’s being sarcastic

Damn bro, think about all the cool shit you could’ve bought w 12 grand!
nio has made me chinese now
wtf is FB rn
what RAD calls do you recommend buying? saw the comment about shorts having 4 days to cover
Different story if you really are holding for long then i would hold still
So after a runup like this you don't think it sells off even if they beat?
Recert scheduled tomorrow. Play is $235c 11/27
Why couldn’t PLTR moon tmrw.

Haven’t we seen ATH on SPY like 10 times in the last couple months?
Why do I even bother with puts anymore
NIO is blasting off.... last chance to get on the ride to Tendietown!!!
Puts to 0

Fucking yes this is the exact type of insider information I love to read here. Not enough info to be dumb enough to short, but at least turns me away from buying.

BABA black sheep have you any dough?
No sir, No sir, only woe.
Donkey Kong is back with retarded strength.  

This is why I always ignore bear songs on short term volatility that doesn't go your way. Been holding since $13 from DEAC. Back to over $60 in no time.
Thanks. It was more like 85%. Solid.
Sold at $51 last week.  Ill wait till crap earnings and buy the dip.
Whoever just called.out HIMX, I hope you're right. Just bought calls for Jan

I see, I sold half of them at a small loss and bought some PLTR at $18 so I’ve already made most of the loss back. I also have some NIO which is doing pretty well atm

CVS calls might be the move

Please be quiet and enjoy
Ssshhhhhhhhhhh. We don't want to meme it. Let this be our secret <3
Bull put spreads. I mean it’s a 60B company who sells 60.000 cars a year with no moats or anything. Toyota and all the big boys are going electric next year and NIO is nothing
NIO!!!!
Already had the calls don’t worry
Grab your balls and saddle up partner, scared money didn’t make money

There's no evidence of anything happening except using a personal email server for admittedly sensitive information more appropriately on government servers. The rest of your statements are unsubstantiated garbage that don't raise past the level of Facebook conspiracy theories. This issue has been investigated to death and there has never been any evidence that the Chinese somehow exploited the personal email server, that there was any nefarious purpose, or that there was spoliation of evidence. Further, other politicians in our government including in the current administration have been caught using personal email as well - doing the same thing these stupid conspiracy theories spawned from.

The "mental gymnastics" really are unreal, just not in the way you may have intended.
When did you get your tracking number?
That makes a lot of sense, thanks
The questions is how soon will the acquisition  happen
It’s devastating. Would not recommend.
EOW
How am I arguing with you? I just made a statement
Look out for iv crush.
Also retarded, I’ve noticed people seem to think the market is going to dump every time we have a Green Day and lately 90% of the time it just keeps going up
Alls i need now is for GME to moon and today will be the best day of my life wooooooo
You won't regret.
Out of the loop with ba. What event is going on? And what are your moves so I can inverse them
I believe I am what you often refer to as “leveraged to the tits”
I really need to learn to ignore the market until at least 10:30 or convince myself it doesn't open unti 1 pm to stop making stupid ass fucking plays
I am not too worried - going to have a red day eventually - just look at NIO
Of course!
BABA gonna gap up one of these days. Just gimme that sick news bruh
Allah willing brozer
Xpev stopped moving with nio as soon as I bought calls sorry boys 😂😂😂
[deleted]
I habe no idea but like even a 10% jump at this point is looking at like 30% gains tops lol is that even worth it?
PLTR MAKES NIO LOOK LIKE A SNAIL 🐌
I got mine yesterday, I’m up 142% now. Insane
The fact that you have more money then I will ever have to play with inside ROBINHOOD kind of makes me depressed.

Thanks asshole you made me cry.  GOOD FUCKING JOB

Zoom caca frita
Are you ready for PLTR 19?
$1400 a week is more than a lot people’s salaries though. It’s ultra low risk and consistent income, assuming NIO stays relevant and doesn’t dump

Nio 35
Pump and dumps stock
If it breaks 50 I buy steak dinners for all of WSB nio bulls

We are at ALL TIME HIGHS. Buy PUTS on SPY
I’m talking about a 10-15% move following a very important binary event in the recert
Ok makes sense. Been reading about new IPO for ant in about 6 months...
earnings are priced in already
When is it not worth doing diamond hands?
Yeah they spy on you thru your phone
50 pls
3:59pm : NIO $50
4:01pm : NIO $60
Whenever I see comments like this, I know the top is near
Up 100% on a few 5/21/2021 $25Cs. would love to lock in some profit but why not hold strong?
Paper hands 🙌
I’m still holding. 12/18 calls. Hoping to gain something back.
PLTR still has a strong run up, get in before you regret it!
PLTR but wait for end of day or tomorrow morning.
This is the only way
Theta ganging by selling vxx puts for lunch money lol
How much does it have to go up?
NIO breaking away from his EV brothers, earnings looks like a dump if this is priced in
I'm up 180% on NIO shares,  46% RIDE shares and 30% SBE shares lol
Someone told me to buy the dip on BABA last week and I've been out on vacation. Are my 30 11/27 290Cs doing well?

Goddamn we had 2 straight theta days and no mango tweets. Might break ATH when Mango starts tweeting about BA tomorrow and then JNJ/REGN therapeutics EOW.
Lets goooo
Are we about to exp a nio gamma squeeze???
I just want PLTR to give back the $$$ it took from me last week lol. 🚀🚀🚀
Looked at it but didn't pull the trigger.

Solo go up $.10

Nio go up $2.50

Pltr go up $1.50 

And tomorrow I can start the day all cash.
I think CVS
Incredibly irresponsible cause a lot of noobies are going to actually do it after seeing this gift and lose all their money.
What is NNDM and why does it keep making me money? I bought shares at 2.98 bc 3D printing sounded futuristic and a stranger on the internet told me to. What do they do? Long term, whose market share would they be taking? AMD/Nvidia?

They’re up 50% in like a week
Ride that dick girlllll
Give it a lil time
NIO到月球🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Dude, we are humans who get bored easily and there used to not be any digital entertainment. Every mammal has been domesticated in some capacity one time in history. Its honestly probably veterinary or weird diet reasons most animals arent seen more.
Okay i killed it with Tesla calls. Pulling out 90% and playing with the rest. Where we going boys?
I'm shocked that GME will bounce between 11 and 12 all day. Shocked.

TL;DR: +12 AH, back to 11s intraday. Ad infinitum. "Manipulato," - Voldemort, 2020.
Hold the line bois
Big money bought and are holding. I assume with blow out earnings they will add. Think since it’s been so scared the last couple days but still making higher lows. We’re mornings. I’ve got 12x 53c and I’m holding. I withdrew the gains I made in the last month. If I don’t hit this I’m out til next month 😂👍 all or nothing babies it’s nio time!
ZM starting its moon mission this sub forgot ZM is a sleeping giant
Bought a few hundred worth 15 minutes ago and they are up 17 percent already. Good luck!
FLY MEEEE TOO THE MOOOON
If nio closes at 50. It’s well positioned to pump to 55 tomorrow and then we all make gains
I thought MSFT ex divvy is tomorrow. Why is everyone selling?

Also, I think BA is overbought and BABA is oversold. Soon to be reversed.
Can the people who make these get together and make a full movie. Like I would pay to watch words over a person that’s how good these are.
Don't you fucking give up on me BABA. Cuz I ain't giving up on you
I need NIO to reach $52 before close today
Lmfao my Tesla 535 calls ain’t moving for shit
Jpow said he’s buying Apple calls... bears be warned
I just put 12k into goodrx
NIO strangles for earnings, then buy more calls tomorrow
That’s a no no
I dunno twat you’re talking about, I cunt hear you.
what will we see next - 3600 or 3630 ?
I’m tired of making small gains, I just want to yolo my entire account into one play but I’m too much of a coward.
palantir gahhhh damn
Get in before PLTR is priced in for the S&P500!

No tears, only dreams!
Shhhh
what is the logic behind this move? goodrx seems fucked
Yeah, I started trading last December and that’s one of the hardest things to learn is to be proactive rather than reactive. Obviously it’s not black and white but I’m sure a ton of people went all in on weeklies on TSLA this morning only to panic sell
Puts on SPY??
Send a pic of your portfolio, ill send you mine. We will see who has the paper account

Robinhood?  Seriously though, the ease with which RH gives people access to options is straight up reckless.  With Vanguard I was too intimidated with going through the process, and with Schwab I actually had to call them to get access since they were concerned I only had minor experience (1 year) with options.

Yeah regardless of which platform people make, they'll probably make the same bets and lose money with options but RH basically handles a toddler a gun.
Take a look at maxr
whats everyone thinking about tsla now
Teach me how to fishhhhh 😍
hope everyone is loaded to the tits on PLTR now
Let's just keep directing them to r/smallstreetbets and r/antstreetbets then
Anyone fuck with weed stocks? Def have the potential to be a multi bagger in a 1-2 year outlook. Thinking APHA dump sometime soon? Thoughts?
John McAfee said back in 2017 if it doesn’t hit $500K in three years, he’ll eat his dick on TV. He’s got a month or so left for it to go 30x.
Wouldn't be surprised if it continues its momentum. I tried the same with NIO and ended up losing out on a lot of gains. Just my 2c
Still holding my 130 for 12/18 lol
Nah, probably not yet, sure.

that's rather extreme.

Moment of truth NIO, intraday high - what’s next?
i hope we didnt run out of money to throw at it already

Promise me
I generally prefer 69* but 45* will do
diamond hands baby you know what i'm talking about
I am also, but I don't think it's going to happen by the 27th
It jumped from $90 to $100 overnight. Thats about 12%. The issue with stocks is that market movers and huge financial investors jump into it right away. It peaks, then it hits limits and it starts falling back off. It hit $94 back in July, then fell to almost $56. If you want to try and get back into it, watch it slide now back down to $80, then maybe break thru $100.
I mean prpl
Strike and date please sir I’m itchin
NIO 😳
fuck no
Jpow has a strong voice for his age and looks and god damn he talks a lot he’s still fking talking
I am okay with taking profit. Not going to be upset over any green
Aaaannnd we are back from lunch.  Pltr.  Moon.
We have the next 2.5 hours to decide! I may sell my 12/24 calls but keep my 2/19/21 calls.

Amazon still cant fill narcotic scripts which was about 200 mill in 2019, or rougly 10% of all scripts in the US

PLTR still, easy 10% EOY
Pltr or solo seem to have good meme energy for a bagger
You’ve probably not made a better decision in your life than that
is this a good time to get some uvxy calls?
What else would it be about

I held on until $17.70 before I sold. I hit my goal and didn’t want to get greedy. 

Converted a small portion of it into 19c 12/4, already printed a bit but I’ll probably just hold onto it.

Put my last $500 into PLTR
pltr
Afraid of what?! 

Scared money don't make money and PLTR leaps are prob  one of the best plays out there. Get in pussy, the printers don't stop!!!
Bear call spreads or bull put spreads? Thinking of rocking the same
It got diluted
At this point my calls are so worthless I might as well just hold and wait so, yeah totally its gonna rip any minute now
Ride is the play, they have some nice trucks coming out in 2021. Already got 50k orders
PLTR for 12k
Did everyone load up on PLTR? Good.
They're offering an 11% discount but the stock is down 9%. Seems normal to me
God Nio you slut, keep PUMPING FOR US
Perfect, I’m just calling out the retards who commented on buying 15 minutes ago when some of them are over 200%. Those guys are just as dumb as the gay bears in this environment
is pltr going to 25 eow and 40 eom

Why are you dense fucks still waiting on BABA? It’s not going to do shit, ever. It’s done. Get over it. Invest in EV. Fuck, you baba ppl are dense

This is CCLs peak, I'm calling it

Anyone looking at $HD? Thinking about grabbing some $275c but not sure the timeframe yet. Thinking 12/18 or 1/15/21. Either way, I think this bad boy will be touching 280-285 before then. Easy 80% gain if it continues trading in this channel without diving off the deepend

Is this the JPow dip? I can't tell
This is beautiful news. I bought 2023 calls when PLTR was sitting at 10 bucks. Diamond handing these leaps for big gains
The fact it's gone down and is only up 3% means to me that it's going to moon. 

If it had a massive run up today I would say that shit is priced in.

my 1/15/21 30c is looking reeeallly nice right about now
Stocks only go up
how so? xpev deliveries, charging stations, gross margin, revenues are all up big. that would result in an increased stock price.
It means that people who were waiting before have gone all in. So it's a vote of confidence.

But also don't expect any dips to get bought up like they have been because people are already all in.

Got in for 120 shares @ $10 a while back and picked up a couple calls for out in Feb knowing this would go up over the next few months. Only speed bump is in December when insiders can potentially cash out the rest of their shares. When they did a direct sell insiders could only sell 25% of their holdings...

Same, pulled 300% from a 11/27c lotto I picked up yesterday.  Waiting for another Op to buy back in.

PLTR either going to shelf off this plateau or rocket again. 😳

Umm I think everybody knows about it but people are too focused on NIO earnings right now.

These banks that gave Tesla offerings based on TSLA stock prices (high) at the time - are compelled to pump TSLA

Have some relaxation fellow TSLA bulls
Yeah imagine what is gonna happen if SPY went down to even like 345
Seems low.
**AYO**

**MMs GOT PLTR BUY THE NUTS RN**
Premium burner.
Depends on how much capital gains tax affects that position, and whether you want to roll the strike higher or cash out.

I picked up 11/27 17c this morning already up 50%
they are cheap and print the most when a big down move happens
Goddamn MSFT..
id love to see the ask volume at 18.50
Telling someone first other than the president would indicate that was a lie Mr. CEO
meant 11/27, i'm in EU
the engine has started back up and the gas nozzle is back on the pump. we're bout to launch to 19 for close!

Yeah spread your ass u dirty whore
profit is profit my dude
$WORK quietly moving on up this week. Seems to be boomer-rotation-proof
[removed]
Once TSLA starts moving MMs will need to gamma hedge and buy stocks. This will be followed by a short squeeze. I’m fucking ready
SPXU puts, GE or F calls
Key component != sole reason, nice logic
don't hate me PLTR gang - I sold out and am now hoping for a dip to get back in (whenever that is)
2022?
why go way OTM then?
Spreads are the way for NIO
How’s that retest coming along? Lmao. I cashed out at -$650
“Options, futures, and other derivatives” by Hull Basu (I believe his name is) is a great book to understand derivatives thoroughly. Everybody on YT or other platforms claiming they will “make you millions” with their strategy can’t make money in the markets so they sell their “subscriptions” or “tips”. I went for Finance but didn’t learn half as much as I have through self research and learning. But the book I suggested is a good one to go through and study.
[deleted]
Looks absolutely retarded lol.

Imagine it doubling in a week or two. It would be exciting though.
To the moon now ?
Just don't dive in with the fundamentals, majority of the companies with strong fundamentals will not make you rich, they'll help you beat the inflation when you graduate to a boomer. What I do is YOLO on companies with rising revenues quarter on quarter no one really gives a shit about if they are making profits or losses if they are less than 5 years into existence. Rising revenues and upcoming earning reports that you think are gonna be better than the previous quarter just jump on it and exit after 5-10% increase from price you bought.
It’s chart is so young though
[deleted]
apparently none at this minute

PLTR going to the moon again. im guessing itll close over 19 at the rate its running today.
I bought this morning IV was only 80
[deleted]
You pumped more money in every time you lost ?
Chinese plays?

NIO
Yea NIO. Keep pumping you dirty bitch
I got uncomfortable and sold 7 $7 11/20 contracts for a mere $88 profit yesterday.
For when I panic sell my portfolio for the eighth time in 3 days.
I’d just stay away to be honest
IV crush, its a trap
They won’t be shit without cathie
I really wanna get nio puts but I’m a bithhhh
Those citi crooks upgrade it to a price of 57, but lets see
ain't gonna be no pullback bro. whoever bought this today will buy it tomorrow again. thank you come again.
[deleted]
BABA 260c for this Friday are stupidly cheap right now. Could easily have a 3% bounce from these oversold levels tomorrow. Just picked up a few.
Up prayers
Long term is definitely the way. Regret selling so many stocks that have mooned.
[$TSLA cheat sheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/InvestDojo/comments/jvy637/tsla_cheat_sheet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
My understanding was that it would continue to jump even higher, seems like I need to do a bit more research on how stocks react to news/announcements
took my gains in TSLA and already have \~11K worth of PLTR....more PLTR?
NIOOOOOOO MAKE US HARD
fair point.
[deleted]
Shorted shares don’t have an expiration
I’m holding mine, I gotta see what happens
Anyone gonna hold nio through earnings or bad call?
The argument is that it won’t go the other way
Don’t say that sir

I can't quite tell for certain, I'm looking at ToS crappy Active Trader data which is vague at best.  I'm only drawing a "hunch" LOL

Looks like 10% to me.

Nio is at 47.3

$47.5c 11/20 cost ~$4. So if NIO goes above 51.5 by Friday you make money. $4/$47.3 = ~10% not 20%. 

Other calls have different payoffs.
DKNG got a $100 price target
Why?
spy puts it is
Hold PLTR monthlies or sell today?
EOD no. EOW yes.
That happened like last week. She sold them the option a few years ago and now she's crying because they are exercising it
It's reached the point of no return. This thing will never dip below today's starting levels again.
Buy the Plug dip
This is a joke right? The only reason XPEV had “organic” growth is because it rode the NIO meme wave.
100%, I’ve been in since 25, but I still don’t understand the explosion lol

I was mostly talking about his comment about how he lost money recently because of advice here.
wtf is a 27/11
20
Hah good eye, there are some losers. I have a leap contract in BA and 2 in DIS.. gains greatly out weigh the losses.
My PLTR call spread is not getting filled out on Robinhood. What are my options?
What are some Christmas plays?
I bought an 11/20/2020 XPEV $25P when it first started running up crazy. It will expire worthless on Friday, and I will likely learn very little from this experience. Thank you for listening.
Every day BABA's IV keeps dropping. When it eventually reverses, the gains will be epic!
Still have tomorrow. I hope gme doesn't cuck me ah...
thanks for the reminder, fellow peasant. A sweet reminder to navigate this page for humor, not for advice or ideas.

I guess I should’ve held all my shares of palantir I traded on IPO day lol

Same with ppl who keep spamming when NIO’s ER is. I’ve seen that question pop up sooo many times when they could have done a simple google search.
those are some chad shorts not sure what youre saying.
Wondering the same. I have a SPY $420c '22 from March of this year.

Welcome to the future sir, we’ve been enjoying this ride since IPO. Enjoy your long stay
Truth be told, I actually really love nios cars. They are sexy af.
they just reported their earnings like 4 days ago
PLTR refueling before next leg up
Why are people yoloing into Palantir calls when the IVs are 200%+? Y’all know that if it goes the opposite way, you’re getting killed twice.
Real answer: how much do you actually expect it to go down, and how soon? My thoughts: not enough and not very soon
lol OSTK and its random dump/pumps
We fuccccked
Same
They’re covid tracing company
Nio 50 eod?
I feel like WBA calls for like 11/27 are free money. No way Amazon will displace them, especially not on any kind of near term basis. There's got to be a ton of regulatory hurdles to prescription medicine delivery and some of it they might not even be able to fill (specialty medications)
When are y’all taking profit on PLTR?
Whatcya got?
FUCK GME! 

Sorry man 😩
What do you guys think about PLUG calls eod?
Ill take it hahaha
Well, technically, it's still OTM. That's a hard one. I would wait until Monday. Theta is your friend.

What if Jpow says something like  tesla is  going to be huge for the future economy
[deleted]
Nio to 55 is the only way out of this depression.
no
I think its going to the moon. Its now touching its previous ATH, so it seems to be testing it. If it breaks past that, then its to the moon we go.

Edit: Correction, it is now ABOVE its previous ATH. If it holds it then its to the moon we go.
Hedges most likely
Return my treasures to me, and I myself will carry you through the gates of Valhalla. You shall ride eternal in EVs!

I like how PlTR moons when no one knows anything about them or financials.
Fuck it. I'm gonna will GME to 13 by EoD
This is the way
#WSB Sentiment

Top three WSB tickers today: TSLA, NIO, PLTR

Current Sentiment: 82% bullish
This is the way.
NIO moons, but here’s my hot take... it moons after earnings.
Hate to break it to you Santa and his elves aren’t real, so how are you gonna make the bikes?  The problem is with inventory and manufacturing enough to meet demand
What site is this?
Yesssir, the dip happening literally rn
what to make of the unusual VXX 27/11 38C flow (+9K volume, OI = 117)?
What
Ok so what's your next call?
Lmfaoo I know the charts fucking hilarious
GG
NOT TOO LATE FOR PLTR RN BOYS JOIN THE GANG
No better way to day trade imo.
Doubled down at open. Sold right at bottom
Where do you get the buy-ask spread data from if I may ask?
Still can't get over this volume in the broader indexes... No one wants to sell but there aren't that many people who are willing to buy so there literally is nowhere else to go but to slowly creep up....
[deleted]
they are really trying to pump this shit
Fading away slowly
Remindme! 1 day
Can you lose it all so you can complete that Batman symbol?
HYLN, make me a billion
Lots of reasons why the stock market should crash, but ultimately the market cares about 1 thing, liquidity. With record stimulus, Fed moving to inflation targeting from NAIRU, MMT becoming widely accepted.. we are moving into a an inflationary period with long term negative real interest rates.. the asset inflation period is just getting started.
Idk any of these terms but my options are  🚀
My wsj this morning said it was the #1 most traded stock yesterday.
stonks only go up
Lol did similar but a call debit spread
i pick xpev over nio. xpev has more organic stock price growth over the meme growth of nio
The tools are not going away anytime soon
Here comes the run up
Diamond hand those calls until the morning. 

I dare you.
I had to rewind the first 3 lines like 4 times because my boomer eyes couldnt read the color on the background fast enough.

its EV... go all in
Good call, I figured with that money you know what you’re doing lol. Sold my calls too early this week
Despite not liking the company I bought 200 shares at $15.60 and then sold covered calls at $17 assuming it wouldn't hit that by Friday. I still make over 15% with premiums if this holds.
The institution that bought PLTR today is waiting for it to dip a bit but there are no sellers.
Once Deep ITM it wont matter.
there will be 0 iv crush inna 1$ wide spread
It won’t stop going up lmao
FK u, congrat. I only had 1 425C, should bought more yesterday.......
Who the fuck is waiting til now to sell?

Great question and i think its situational. I personally like to set target gains and exit on that number for leaps. Sucks when you pay up for time value to hit that target after a week but hey you never lose taking profits
If NIO makes me a penny over my total invested, I'm done here. I am too retarded for options.
LET THE WINNERS RIIIIDE
I bought the around the same price. Do you think the price will go up this week? It's been rumored that there will be a drop tomorrow. So I'm wondering what the projected price will be.
55 wont even do it, IV too high
Why am I only hearing about these stocks after they moon. Geez
I hope you responded with, "OK Boomer. Buy real estate in the Bay Area."
IV 281% LOL
I would take profit.
short strangle or iron condor; just rape the retards who dont know about IV
Nvda calls anyone
butt PLUG
RIP NNN
Yes, you will see some resistance for few weeks1. But when its 21, 18.3 seems good entry.
I just bought 50 more. Since I bought the initial shares without all this hype, I really do believe in this company. They have virtually no competition and the heavy dependence of governments on the software they provide will be critical when the vaccine comes out.
I was just hesitant because the valuation looks way overblown. But hey, who am I to question the invisible hand
So they read about ANT and were like *yoink*
Google it
You could have said the same for xpev and li
good entry for pltr?
Proof [https://theintercept.com/2020/06/26/biden-adviser-avril-haines-palantir/](https://theintercept.com/2020/06/26/biden-adviser-avril-haines-palantir/)
Just bought some, we make money together brother 🤡
I think this is a casino and you should close your eyes and trade whatever your clicker lands on
BLNK has been ripping the last 2 days. Is it slowing down or going to the moon?
position?
Waiting on The dip
The delta on the same strike price is basicly the same no matter the time horizon. So the gains are the same. It's just that longer dated contracts are more expensive because you basicly buy theta.
speakin' my language
It would definitely be a plus with a big gap up day tomorrow.  Good luck 👍
Lmao fuckin right 😂
Short interest actually increased pretty substantially from when it was at $4. There were minor squeezes on that run, but nothing major, and everyone piled back in.  Retail got knocked out hard by the crash, but inst basically took their place.  Now Cohen turned down a board seat and has said they need to follow his plan "or else."  I'm not banking on a buyout, but it is actually likely now (first time I've said that so far).

I have over half of my portfolio in this now, seriously expecting this to be a once in a lifetime investment. Letter Cohen sent: https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC%20Ventures%20Letter%20to%20GameStop.pdf

Sounds bearish at a glance, until you think about what the reaction to it will be, and his reason for sending it.
HYLN
Hi We got a Girl here, wanna hang out at the retard bar after?
PLTR looking 😘
NIO call credit spread 55/56 am i retarded or r u fks learning IV crush
Nio been ripping has earnings today. PLTR got a price raise and ripped 15%. TLSA getting included in S&P. And thats about 85% of WSB rn.
If it dips it will be temporary, and a buying opportunity. It’s not staying sub $50 for long.
Party city 🚀
Create a email just for RH, most of RH's emails are useless anyway?
It's like a backwards Chime

I've never used Chime to invest, I just know you can. I'd imagine the functionality isn't very good.

Robinhood Cash by itself isn't so bad, but I wish they would focus on the brokerage aspect first
selling $20 strike calls, come and get them
PLTR
Just reaching out on a generous limb here. Could you by any chance tell me a good way to start learning about the market? I don't really trust looking it up because well obviously people make a lot of money off of teaching about the markets or lying about the markets and if I'm going to learn I'd like to make sure it's a good source. I'm kind of living in NEET heaven right now so I have zero expenses, good savings and all the time in the world so I may as well make something of myself even if it means losing a little.
I was hoping for at least a little upstonking just to dump my calls but Jesus it keeps bleeding
That’s why you don’t buy options on dead stocks
Don’t mind if I do
Lmao. I got access to option by the snap of a finger on Robinhood and I’m still unable to say trade on that account. Options are farrr more risky than day trading IMO
BREAKING NEWS: Chick-fil-A announces IPO and plan to open Sundays. Also pigs are flying and it’s the end of the world #RIP
PLTR!
My pp can’t get any harder
NIO calls
Eww. Ferrari.
They have adjusted options on Schwab.
I have Jan 21 $38C..... hold???
RH intern high as fuk
DKNG is making me back the thousands I’ve dumped into it from gambling, I have come full circle.
PLTR is up 15% but is still undervalued imo
Can someone explain for an actual retard.. so does NIO have to go up 20% after earnings to not get crushed?
I can see this happening. holding off on calls for today. i think some people already got rekt for jumping in too early.
Say it louder for the people in the back
Sadly no, because people think a vaccine announcement in Nov means things will be back to normal by Jan lol
Today
No

I can if I have 25k in my account which I don’t lol just a decent amount I’ve saved
The ETFs can’t buy until day-of?
Sorry, the TSLAQ ESMA spaghetti of an argument didn't stick to the wall. I'm still laughing about it lol. Threatening asset managers over single name portfolio weight discretionary decisions, hahahaha. 😁

TSLAQ lost $40b shorting TSLA already, they really don't know how to stop...

See how much easier
Jjjjjjjjpow
Lmao I actually laughed this great
I just did quick DD after already yoloed all my money on PLTR but holy fuck

The ceo is a facebook board member and helped start PayPal. Also the company is backed by the government with contracts to include the army.

Apparently it's also a vaccine play because it's used to track and distrubute

 Holy fuck this is gonna be a 10 bagger next week
Go meme stock go meme stock go!
 All right, moving on to Tesla. Those shares are up 13% this morning. At long last perhaps for Tesla bulls, the company is going to be going into the S&P 500. ***That will happen before the open of trading on December 21st***. If you look at how big Tesla is right now, it would be, if it entered today, this morning, the 10th largest stock in the S&P 500 by market cap, just after Johnson & Johnson. Which is pretty incredible here. [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-join-p-500-152340212.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-join-p-500-152340212.html)
DKNG $50 eow, don't @ me
Those are amateur numbers.
Ah today
Thank you! This has happened before, it will drop. Legit it has no big news or anything now.
It’s... it’s beautiful
A lot of people are going to learn what IV crush is after NIOs earnings report.
He got downvoted by people agreeing people with accounts less than $5k should NOT be banned. That goes directly against your comment lol

yehh.. no and pharmacies make pennies on emergency meds. they might not make pharmacies obsolete completely but it will be a major disruptor. cvs and wag are desperately trying to compete with amzn with cvs even buying aetna cuz they see the writing on the wall.

To the person who bought PLTR at 18.75, fret not, it will continue rising in the long term. Just treat the extra 50 cents per share as a late premium...
I can deal with loss a lot better than missed opportunity. I’m braced for impact boys
Wait on it, it’s gonna drop tomorrow. Got a huge boost today because George Soros bought in

Dont listen to this guy, buy the gun instead, it'll pay itself off in the long run. The overdue fees on gun rentals are killer.
Is NIO earnings tomorrow?
yes. unless you expect it to rally during the week, if earnings are thursday I probably wouldve bought calls for next week. Slightly smaller gains but time will hit you less
Gone.
lol yeah I remember the IPO bloodbath
hey experts, need stock reco for leaps.

 The **distracted boyfriend meme** is a [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme) based on a 2015 [stock photograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography) by the Spanish photographer Antonio Guillem. Social media users started using the image as a meme at the start of 2017, and it went viral in August 2017 as a way to depict different forms of infidelity. The meme has inspired various spin-offs and received critical acclaim. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distracted\_boyfriend\_meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distracted_boyfriend_meme)
I literally said this exact same fuckin sentence about a minute ago. I fuckin love everyone.
Bought puts?
Makes me sad. I bought calls like a retard today.
Nice timing! Hope these print for you.

calls + shares near bottom
Has Powell ever been this bullish? Spy new atm eod
Ya I bought LOW dip this morning because of HD dip and overall market dip. Now I’m thinking LOW will pop along with market and HD
this PLTR consolidation looks hella tempting rn
Should I get hasbro or Starbucks puts ?
I once sold a PLTR $10c 11/20 and a $12.50c 5/15/21 at a loss 🤡
If we don’t make it, I just want you all to know it’s been an honor to trade alongside you
I’m thinking of doubling down for the third time 🥺
Wait, you’re saying you don’t like the “rate my $1k portfolio” posts on the daily?
Tech companies scale faster
Nice. Hope earnings today brings you tendies.
Explain this to me, I just bought Jan 2022 spread $17.50/$35  for $3.55???  WTF?  

Not going to argue, but...dang, that was easy!
See you in outer space
How do I disable robinhood from emailing me every time I make a trade
Damn ur lowkey inspiring me to do the same
Maybe they should focus on becoming an actual real broker first.
We only get AH movement now, so gay
What time horizon do people sell their LEAPs? I see lots of people saying they have 2022 leaps, but do people tie up their capital that long for good gains or do they wait until a good 100%+ day then sell and roll out? I see weeklies going for 500% for PLTR today and my Feb leaps are "only" up 70-95% so it makes sense to buy leaps for a more secured time horizon to make gains in exchange for "lower" returns
b/c of this post i got in at $30... I'mma hold this for a year and will come back and either yell at u or call u my hero.
I like how you diversify your risk
Holy shit thx for the info

NIO 80c FDs are 10 cents.  How is selling those not free money lol
I had it and never lost sense of smell
SDC you are one crazy son of a bitch. 

Now I can get back to daydreaming the short squeeze to $15-16
I hope you also took some profit this morning
XPEV IV is insane. Fecking 200% lol.
Appreciatw it boss
I know a lot of guys who got it and can still smell. I also know someone who got it and cannot smell or taste certain things anymore. He’s actually lost weight bc he can’t eat pizza. Haha
Economy*
Looks like 5 million+ buy orders at $18 on PLTR.  Shorts are strong at $18.50 but not outnumbering the Longs at $18.   Anyone have better L2 data that can double-check for me?

TLDR:  $18 a good buy in on PLTR, it looks like.
Welcome back soldier. Don't mind these nerds calling you a pussy. Until I see them post 10k or higher on options expiring this Friday they pussy too.
Where does NIO bounce or drop to after earnings? Official predictions!!! I say $32 Oh MY!!! But then it rallies to 35-38 EOW
Weak hands here. I got it of it fellas. Thanks again for all the feedback

NIO is going to dump after ER, volume has been slowly decreasing past couple days, earnings already priced in
Quintupled my money on TSLA 800c 12/18

About 20% but don’t worry they will crush
So Pfizer stopped selling options. I guess it is going to the moon and we ain’t invited

Shitcoin - store yo currency before it’s too late!!!!
Roll to Friday. Potential 2.2341 bagger 🤭
Only down 43% so far!
If the market crashes again in the near future, would you buy puts or calls?
Do it at your own risk. Words on gay street is that baba might drop another 10% before reversing

I feel like I should close my PLTR calls today but I’m afraid I’ll get greedy and won’t
Do you think 18.3 is still a good entry?
A base model Tesla is 38k but I've seen plenty of 2018 M3P's for sale for $50k on the dot with EAP
I only know meme stocks and red charts, sorry

Just a couple more 800% days and you can probably quit
Y’all’s thoughts on Baba?
Cheers. Ditto. 🚀🚀🚀
Shares or options?
HD was good and dumped pulling LOW down. Hoping Low is good and pulls HD back up
Missed too many Tesla moon missions.  Riding this rocket all the way to Friday whether it be the ocean floor or the starrrssssssss
Are the bears of wall street just gonna take it up the ass forever now? No aggressive selling at all today huh? Buncha pussies, they always pull the rug when you least expect it.
It’s interesting to hear Powell time and time again say we need Stimulus to get the market going but it just keeps going up anyways 🤡
What you're gonna wanna do is buy some calls. Any old ticker will do.
Paper handed my PLTR calls :(
NNDM
Yes let’s have the fed keep bailing out corporations, and devalue the dollar into nothing. Because keeping the stock market high is more important than the value of our currency

Depending on how much it goes up today, I just just take the 90 day ban from buying on robinhood and switch to Webull

Im down 60% on my Jan 21 BABa calls, pls tell me there’s hope? Or should I dump and hop on another cope?

Nah i just thought it would dip after open since it was over-priced in. Long term i know it's solid
How much does nio have to beat today to break through iv crush
I’m up $500 today as well, feels good even on small plays
strike and expiry?
I would guess Xi’s right hand man would be a gay robot.
Now take that 500 and put it into something else.

Too many prunes today whew
Usually the price will start dipping after a big spike as normal people should start selling and taking profits. Put values go up when the price drops. So you play both sides for tendies.
T for sure. Maybe both
Good point
IQ 11/27 calls.
If the Max doesn’t get certified I’m fucked
I hate DKNG. Now it finally takes off and I can break even. If I put that money into NIO I would have been so much happier instead of just breaking even

its a legit ass company... I know my username says im the CEO of SPY but you're gonna be shocked to find out that I'm actually not. In realty I'm a defense contractor and this company will make shitloads of money for a long time
TSLA retrace back to 460 EOD
Wouldn't Januaries be the better play?
Shoutout to all the autists who have been spamming about palantir, my calls are up 300% today, thanks yall
PLTR still bullish at these levels. ATH tomorrow as sector rotates in
Nio 60 eow or Tsla 500 eow?
Can confirm, bought $20C
Have you guys noticed that every single PLTR dip gets bought up immediately?
Imagine blowing up your account on 40K worth of SPY puts. Taking a couple months off to sell and buy a new house, move to a new state, buy a new car, take a trip to Vegas, strike out every night on roulette, save up some more gambling money and then... throw it all in on SPY puts again.

People thought I was retarded to putting 50% of my portfolio into NIO back when it was $10. I refuse to make that same mistake again with PLTR. 100% all in this time and not looking back.

Why did Vale pump so much today?

Looks like facebook has it covered. That's quite the string of green candles...
Get in on PLTR below 20, and ride it till 30 EOY
Told y'all not to sleep on Aunt JMIA, every time she takes a good lashing she gets right back into the kitchen cooking up tendies.
Interesting thought. ANT IPO was tanked purposely by Ma. Fintech regulations don’t get drafted overnight. Ma sees these regulations,  assumes they would be released post-IPO. Which would pull down the share price and embarrassing him in the process. Thus, Ma pokes the bear first, forcing Xi to respond. Baba is fucked short term but it’s an intriguing story once you start to follow.
Lol facts.

Same, and I'm not even in PLTR. Up 25% overall thanks to KNDI.
Wow this is retarded. Godspeed.
You did already? There’s always a run up before close on earnings day. I meant sell then.
1000% return
Took a lunch break sorry guys, PLTR going back up now
Don’t buy puts on a train
Here I am thinking I’m smooth brain with 44c lol. My prayers for you.
just loaded PLTR again, been in and out since low 9s
I can't believe there is a Tesla logo at the bottom of today's chart
Not to mention, I don't have nearly enough financial research to be able to spot specific key details for companies as an actual experienced person would!
Good shot at 50 EOD.

If PLTR could hit 19, I’d be so happy
yep thanks, good luck! i highly suggest looking into selling covered calls. 

in a crazy volatile market its not hard to make 5-10% of your port a month and much safer then options

My 11 calls will probably expire worthless.
Is it be cause of the US military contract and Soros that gave PLTR it’s fuel? I mean it can’t all just be autists buying right?
$33K. Down over 50%
YEA POWELL, BE A NEGATIVE BITCH
Right.. dumb as shit
Last Thursday I had some 50c 11/13 for NIO which I sold at close for no profit.  
Friday morning NIO jumps to $54 and I'm so upset that I sold my 50c.

Later that day I see NIO dropping to $45 so I FOMO to some 70c 11/20 which I'm still holding.  
I'm -80% now because of my paper hands.  
I think I'll ride them to ER and Valhalla.
lol people don't understand - there are no fucking sellers in PTLR! Direct listing and lockup period baby! whoever sold the 20% when IPO'd already done so.
Personally would sell. There’s no guarantee they moon even if they crush earnings we have seen that happen all the time. IV is way to high I don’t think many people will make money off of ER.
So ... like practically everybody who had money in the market.

The fact is the S&P 5 has been incredibly lucrative for the past decade, but especially after this year they seem pretty top heavy.
It is scientifically impossible for PLTR TO GO DOWN EVER AGAIN
Amazon Pharmacy is really torpedoing all these online pharma stocks. I'd be careful.
nio calls
What the fuck is the play? Go long on draft kings ?
I bought shitcoin at $5k, and I feel like a genius
How you viewing BABA now? I’m thinking about March 21 calls
The beer wine and spirits market has already matured and not growing so much. Once Hard Seltzer disrupts, and TAP engages, they are now part of a GROWING and EXCITING market. Wallstreet loves this.
I’m holding small stack through earnings. It might get flogged after but will come
Back soon enough
Anyone check out AXTI?
Even my handful of SPY 366 11/20c I bought at the bottom today are printing LFG I’ve never had a week like this
its a good move. Its better than $0

getting destroyed here too </3 i want to sell to cut my losses but for some reason im scared it moved 50+ after hours for no reason
lol what a fuckin moron you are.  Go buy a bullet and rent a gun, you loser.
KNDI puts
I have 2023 LEAPS...wait for it to drop back a bit...it will.
wow and some websites make you pay for this big brain kind of DD
The prediction I've been harping on the past year and a half is $288k around Oct-Nov 2021. We're on track to get back to our $20k ATH just like we were getting back to $1200 in 2016 setting us up for that run. I'd expect $20k within the month and a drop back down to about $16k before fighting back up by February and never seeing $20k again.
Hah in that case keep on keeping on brother, good luck!
I like you. I have both of these plays exp 11/27
Naw you right.

This isn't my main account so that probably threw some people off but I can assure you I know what I'm saying as I've been talking about crsr since 18$ 

But I agree! Always do your own DD before going all in like me but if you do go all in you would've made 2k today like me 🚀 and its rising 🚀
They have 300 mil debt and 1.5 bill in cash no?
threw a small lotto at riot, shitcoin hype is going to be everywhere again
Hell yeah brother, I ain't selling
Check finviz for prices under crsr
Probably, but they’ll fire up the sweatshops on full cylinders. When they announce sales they recorded during their month long cyber Monday sale, tsunami of green is coming
Oh, definitely. But its not like we can prevent it anyway. Might as well make some money on its journey.
Fat stacks. Only option.
Secular stagnation + stagflation. Good going Jerome.
Not even citi
there are no fucking sellers!!
THIS CONSOLIDATION ON PLTR IS THAT SHIT I DONT LIKE PICK A DIRECTION
Jumia wtf hahaha, stonks only go up

This is where most people end up losing. Be smart
Algo traders must get all fucked up and buy whatever EV stocks they can whenever TSLA goes up 🤣 looking at you NIO HYLON

Sold 6 11/20 35P a few weeks ago
Bought 100 boomer shares at 46 today
Nio to the fucking moon. Permabull for life fuck gay bears!
Cheers brother!
Yes, the ID10T form
NIO calla
BABA gonna hit 0 RSI by the time it goes up
Nah I mean the 45p to protect from downside. If it tanks I have no worries, if it moons even better.
Volume on the 10 min candles are embarrassing.  Are we on vacation?
They’re up 40-80% today. FOMO chasing is a great way to get beat.

already missed the move
Lol I’m definitely not, it’s just fun to think about. Like winning the lottery!
u wot
Would you sell out NIO before earnings just to break even, or let it ride through earnings to make a fat stack of tendies, warning high chance of also being stuck in this Chinese stock for a few weeks if things go south, thoughts?
market poomping 

buy buy buy
TSLA dec 24 calls... whatever you can afford get quality ones
Doubt it. Would he nice though. Id cash out the second it hits 300k and buy a house.

ACB ACB ACB ACB ACB
what's the nio play tonight bois
Been making papes for over a week
Lol I got 1/20/20 calls and they up 100% rn. Thought about cashing but I think the next couple weeks will be telling
Only go up
Interesting
$69.69
Draftkings lets GOOO
Sell NIO at open tomorrow and buy PLTR
i would buy more. it's gonna get upgraded to a buy from a lot of sources and pump even more
hahaah, I sold for 577$ profit at 4.30$ right before it plummeted. I'm guessing it drops to 3.00$-3.50$ before it goes BRRR back up.
Perhaps both
300 shares at $10.03 :)
imagine when the volume on PLTR gets higher 🚀🚀🚀
Who’s yolo’ing NIO calls for ER tonight
Day trading ban? We don't get that in the UK. We can buy / sell unlimited amount each day
Feels like it.
CRWD <3

nancy pelosi you did it again
What the fuck
Draftkings
That’s what I think I’m gonna do, get my shares up to 100 (currently at 50), sell maybe the 55c, and buy a 40p.
BABA is dogshit until it hits $250, every time it hits a 52 week high it needs to fall atleast 21%. Its still at 18%....
Took profit and will renter at 17.75
[deleted]
It will if it goes below a dollar.
No
lol just did like 5 mins ago
Fuck PLTR staying steady looking real healthy
Nice $8
PFE has been shafting me and probably will continue to. I doubt it will shoot up too much even with FDA approval. Maybe climb $4-$5 with the news then back down to $36-$37 shortly after. This seems to be the trend with this stock.
NIO climbing without its chyna brother ev stocks is really sketch.

got 2k for a YOLO, anyone got something decent?
Alright guys gonna take a shower, want to see a big fat 19 when I come out
Why aren’t you balls deep in PLTR calls ?
PLTR to 21 today????
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah that would be a good split. I really need to do that, like for instance I got dkng at 36 had a ton of shorter exp calls and some leaps but ended up trimming most of my shorter exp calls despite them expiring in late november and december when I first bought them. 

Just too hard to watch the account bounce around like that and I prematurely take profits. Im trying to do the same thing with baba soon but instead mostly do it with shares and leaps. I respect the diamond hands guys and hopefully over time ill have more faith in my crayon line drawing skills and indicator reading to just chill. Grats on holding Palantir btw!
WE’RE ALL GONNA FUCK HOT DUMB INSTAGRAM THOTS NIO AND PLTR BROTHERS ON A BED FULL OF OUR TENDIES HAHAHAHAHAHA
This is actually one of the best memes I’ve ever seen on here. Had me cracking up

yeah agreed, im not worried. When it runs...it runs hard
ZM moves $150 in two days when I watch from the sidelines and only moves like $5 when I have options
I usually just yolo $UVXY
WSB was against PLTR until it went up like 50% in a week.

Anagram of PLTR + NIO = Lit Porn and Ol' Print!

If this isn't a sign then God help you, you anagram-of-TRADERS = RETARDS
Made roughly $500 off of palantir so far, would be more, but I’m in college so being broke is a past time. I think it’s about time for my 1st of many yolo life savings moments

Buy ETSY
Does that mean that if I'm expecting quarterly earnings in a stock in 2 days, I should still buy a longer expiration date to keep the stock from plummeting?
Damn.. that average cost is making me hard..
buy PLTR
im at work laughing to myself. 800% gains this morning.
How you goin all in and not checking the position? Tf are you
never that. palantir to $30 EOY
Okay well good thing I have a big dick. I can snap chat a picture of it to you if you would like?

Yeah, it wasn't because he was first to market with a mass produced EV with subsidized charging station infrastructure or anything.  It was all because he moved battery production in house 3 years ago.  Elon should hire you, you're basically a business genius.

Like that matters
>If all goes well should be closely back to its original price next year.  

It won't go well; at the very minimum, China is going to be treating ANT like a bank rather than FINTECH; they won't be able to flip the loans they originate but rather are going to be required to have a 30% capital reserve.  This kills it's profit margins, making the IPO (and the company) much less valuable if Xi ever allows the IPO to go through..
Lol check what the name he called you abbreviates to: no you can’t get your money back I agree w OP
But Papa Elon will sell them the green agenda and make sweet love to AOC...he will be King once Sleepy Joe is done.
gonna be very hard for it not to get to 20 this week
take some profit, and just dump it into shares, so when its at 50 you won't be hitting yourself as much

If you ask for investing advice on WSB daily chat, you might be dumber than fuck.
Nice call
##WHEN DOES PAPA POW SPEAK

Yeah - it went up and then kind of drifted down. But really bullish longterm - online sports betting can only grow bigger.
Idiocy goes a long way around here. Just look at everything. 🎪
As the villain who doesn't get away. I was pulling for him.
Open 55 and goes to 60
I wouldn’t do it. BABA can be slow to recover when it falls. Why not go for a US e-commerce play? Why China? I mean I get it I was a baba investor for years, it’s consistently undervalued, but right now I’d much rather be in AMZN ETSY maybe even SHOP... like there are better choices than BABA so why put all your eggs in that basket?
8 420 calls expiring 11/20. average cost 4.5. sold them for 40 dollars
I respect that. I believe that is the way! 💎🙌
It’s data, data is literally the new currency in this world and they have a stronghold over the government data. They can take their time making a profit but they’re not about to go broke with Peter Thiel as a founder

You guys think I should dump my Pfizer $39c 11/20 today? We’re supposed to hear more about approval by the end of the week, took a hit yesterday with Moderna
who do you think drives his cars. leftists may hate him but democrats love him.
Blackberry is making the base system for many of the upcoming EVs. Including Canoo and some self driving trucks
Democrats love EV though. Everything EV is up since Biden won the election.

You fucked up, but you don't need to take the loss yet. Just roll your options to a later date with higher strike.

Your 3DTE Nov20 425 calls can be rolled to 31DTE Dec18 475 calls for a small credit ($0.12)

Also, your Nov20 425 calls still have a decent amount of extrinsic value left ($3.30). You can wait until Friday to roll to extract the theta.

If you're bullish, you can even roll the 3DTE Nov20 425 calls into a 24DTE Dec11 432.5 put for a small credit ($0.07).

It's probably better to roll into something with higher credit though, since you are holding it longer.
Bought 100 PLTR shares a few weeks after its IPO at 9.50. Love the recent pump and I wanna buy more. Is there gonna be a dip or should I just buy it before it booms more?

Palantir has legitimately been the secret driving force behind numerous 'big data' projects the past decade. They were the software analysts for anti-terrorism, they helped bring down Bernie Madoff, they were rumored to be how Osama bin Laden was located, they built the infrastructure for Covid hospital data in both the US and UK (and barely charged the NHS in the UK, which is mega-suspicious that they built that huge data-base as well as "good will"), they have been helping aerospace companies save money...they're fucking everywhere. Their founders choose the name 'Palantir' for a reason, based off the Tolkien's LoTR Palantiri which were the 'all-seeing orbs'.

https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/16/21323458/palantir-ipo-hhs-protect-peter-thiel-cia-intelligence

They have a hand in almost literally fucking everything, and allow the corporations/customers they service to take "full credit" for the finished products.

They built their analysis using IBM-Watsonesque 'unstructured data' reserves. It's cutting edge technology and perspective, and yes they work with "evil" occasionally but they try to remain true to their Libertarian "not my problem what you use us for, we just want the money" philosophy.
hedging is pussyfooting its literally setting another bet against yourself. you have shares you should just buy a call or a put not both whichever side you think is right.

IMHO this is what it should have done after reporting earnings. There was alot to like there and it just kinda sat there. You do see this alot with earnings like a delayed reaction

“How it feels like to averaging down[s syndrome]”
Can’t decide if I want to double my position size in NIO before earnings. My cost basis is pretty high at $45, but idk I feel like a +/-10$ move AH wouldn’t surprise me at all... double the shares and buy a 45p maybe
My dumbass fomoed right at open into 190c feb, and 220 may and had to average down lol....
DKNG 🚀
parks & rec didn't end right but lol on the meme
GUHHHHHHHHHHHHJ
You must of never heard of PLTR. 

Ouch
170c 12/24 is what I expected...

Yeah okay. See you back at 16 by 3:57pm
When you've been in nio long enough to see, they are not going unnoticed anymore.
Are you PLTR gang too?
What's up with amazon? You'd think that news would at least pump it up 100 points.

To the people who are being a dick and keeping Delta airlines red today, have a big hearty FUCK YOU from the call holders. I hope you step on a lego barefoot you assmongers.
Yeah nice to see it back in the green. Some analysts gave them a $100 price target
$BA at 210 ? When tf did that happen
Unfortunately already cashed out hard EOD 11/10 after the 11/9 dip, but now feeling so much fomo

I can't wait to go through all this shit today to make $3

Yeah TA says PTON should pop tomorrow.  Nice call.
Lmao rip
My gym is staying open, puts it is.
Updated list:

PLTR
RIOT

If you're bullish, these are the names that you should watch. These either have room to run or about to break out of consolidation IMO
The fuck you talking about? Look at CCL and all the put holders here.
I already own a bunch ... TBD
Congrats, they just announce a merger
fukin sold my BA 200c for 50% profit instead of 2000% as of now

'uDonT gO bROke tAking pRofitS'
Do it! unless you're autist thinking to buy puts
fucking hope so
buy **BA**, 230 eow and 270 eoy
Scaling into CCL 12/18 17.5 puts. Their earnings are gonna be a complete disaster
whats worth buying in before closing today
they had an upgrade yesterday chump

Take a look at the 1 minute chart. Even a retard like me can see it.
Not the meme of the day
and then at 1:00, nothing happened
50\*
PLTR just broke the bullish scion on the 5h chart. No resistance till 25 and a raising wire forming on the 1h chart, wow
Hold. Not a loss until you sell but keep an eye on Ant IPO situation. If all goes well should be closely back to its original price next year. But if you need the $$$ to make a play elsewhere I’d sell.
Sold spy puts earlier , spy puts for papa powell rn?
Oh shit, you are right about Nov20. They are unavailing a new gen of vehicles already. Hopefully they aren’t ugly.
NIO call credit spreads will probably print fat, wouldn't get puts if you're bearish on ER
I'm going to sleep. PLTR doesn't look like its going to sell off. Consolidation past 15 minutes looks great preparing for another leg up
Literally any prescription ads yo. I saw one last night longer than a movie
Top is 30
Y’all peel y’all chicken nuggets?
FEASTING
NIO gang lets see those earnings so we can sore past EPEV.
Fuck this day is boring as hell for SPY, just move 1% in either direction in like 15 minutes please

is this where I buy calls on PLTR at the top?
we do options here sir. just hold that shit for the long term since you have shares, what is your logic behind buying more now
Fuckk just lost 10% In 30 minutes
Literally no one watches as DKNG goes up a casual 7% on no news.
Anyone on RUN? Thinking about some LEAPs
I don't care if I get perma banned for it, it's ridiculous that a sub can't make it's own rules. A few months ago that sort of "language" was tolerated, but why not now? What has changed? Does Reddit seriously think that censoring people is the way to go?
PDT sucks man. I am out of 3-day trades for this week and missing out on so many plays fearing overnight dump.

I posted serious DD on RIDE on Friday and everyone called me an asshole and starting reeeeeeing about NIO and now RIDE is up 35% which just reaffirms everything I thought I knew about this place.
Does anyone have an exact time for NIO earnings tonight? I wanna have warm popcorn...
Have you tried contacting Palantir? It's also their fault along with your broker.

Congrats! I sold my contracts earlier. I had 70 calls expiring next year but I couldn’t resist the gains I got. I was up over 286% OTM by the way. PLTR saved my portfolio. You holding or selling?

Nice leaps. Fuck you.
You really want this subreddit to tell you where to drop 25k
Baba fine within 3 months. If you need to sell before that don’t buy more
C u daddy
I'm almost there too. The L is only getting fatter. I was feeling sure about this play based on sentiment here and bullish option flow.
Haha same, bought at 15.80 because of my lazy ass
Take profits, don't be greedy
Me too. I meant to buy TSLA options yesterday but I bought TELA instead
Short NIO and buy long calls on PLTR with short term hedges

I’m also a retard so don’t listen to me. It’s just fake money on a screen
thanks bro
Why does CNBC have such a boner for Xeljanz ads?
wrong.. GAPE UP
Who buying nio puts with me
Got $100 to use up, what's the move?
Uh no.  You make nothing on a call that nobody buys.
NIO puts or will it short squeeze? That is the question
just put a stop-loss, sure you might lose 3k in extra profits but you also might gain 10k, its a trade off
It's actually legitimately a good company and useful for future societal problems (if you ignore how it's been used for 'evil a good 70% of the time)
hey... i tried to get this fucking username awhile back

Bad news for target?
I think you missed a period in those numbers
Miraculously saved? Lol. I feel like its pretty common to have an AM dump and then melt higher.
had to refuel its rocket
Feb
I think it depends on your strategy.... Actual day trading I personally buy calls for stock that have large swings, such as TSLA, PLTR, NIO, etc.  longer term, I’ve bought calls for RCL and CCL that expire in April 2021 that are doing well (100%+ gain already), and I’ll hold on to them for a while.
Wow much auteezmo

It will soon. NIO inverse worked wonders. Might be early sometimes, but only wrong shorting TSLA in June.
bull conversion therapy going well so far. I actually am making money today
Mods, people just post shit marked as DD so they get a cute little 3 or 10 day ban and flair. Ban these fucks for 2 months. Maybe they don’t even come back, and don’t even show flair. It encourages people to get banned. Yes, we are that retarded
ICLN Needs to get its shit together.
Not bad idea at all
I'd rather lose everything in the beginning and learn my lesson quick. The 20+ years of missed gains could've made everything back and more.
HYLN pls don't hurt me again bb
Weirdest consolidation I’ve seen on the 1 min chart for PLTR
Being able to ride positions out is important for investing, i would prob agree with you
Are you getting back in?
Yeah business labor is worth a lot more than research right now so combining tech and business could work out for you. I do wet lab research so I trade when I can. I’m starting medical school next fall so I’m trying to make a lot of money trading so I can go on a bunch of vacations next summer lol
Are you for real right now man? They wont give a shit you miss clicked anything. All you can do is sell and buy in.
Zuck getting grilled pretty hard rn

was looking at 5 stocks that would have gotten my balance over my $50k portfolio goal. 😕

Just bought some CCL puts...should hit $19 within the hour.
GLD seems to always bounce off $174 and has been so stagnant for months that the IV is under 20% on June leaps. Is it a retarded idea to buy GLD leaps in case a stimulus deal is passed by February?

Man enough to admit he sucks 🌈🐻 dicks. I agree, big fucking green or gtfo with your sentimental supportive advice shit. 13% gain isn't something we are looking for, unless it's 13.69% which is still meh, but I would understand
Next stop is $30. 

$100 in 2022

It is priced to perfection. There will be a 17 - 20% correction on a day 1. Followed by another 10% correction until Dec. Jan will be the buy time.

Yes, not too late
I see you and 116 other idiots bought those contracts today! Good luck
I havent heard of the buyout whats the deal? The 4 to 15 run looked like a massive short squeeze turned wsb pump so its hard for me to see it running much more unless it starts getting spammed again
I was slightly less retarded than you, but still retarded nonetheless. Bought 100 shares PLTR yesterday am at $15.20, sold at $16. 

Gains are gains, but still feels bad
PLTR gonna get another boost once all the sell side analysts upgrade it following this pump
555
not if you trade options on them
bruh.... I'd rather sit this out... hahaha... Fossil is pumped back to its June Sept Sell off prices.... everything back to those resistance levels lol. I may start taking positions off :) up quite a bit but not enough to retire fuck me lol
go on....?
Let's goooo
Yes, I will

I'm being wary for this reason, feels like retail is just pumping meme stocks while we're running out of short term positive catalysts.
Don’t doubt your vibe
shorting SIX, dont give a fuck.. this business is fuked
I’m a bag holder for life, I’ve been in it since before the run up as a SPAC. Love this company
wow are you okay champ?
When I said yesterday that kndi was going to be up 15% today, I thought it was a long shot, but here we are up 25%
gonna load up on some 18p or 18.5p 11/20 at the end of the day. My 17p 11/20 look sick and I don't expect them to make it

10 x February 21 40c
lol their ticker is wayyy different lol

good shit though
Still not enough to buy an actual Tesla.
The smart move would be to ride it all the way up and sell before market close.  The autist move would be to hold through tomorrow.
I had 17.5p bought yesterday and saw the dip this morning and got exited. shoulda sold for 10% gain but figured it would carry into the day.

Good. I completely agree with you, I'm kind of in the same spot but I'm doing research remotely.

Strongly leaning towards picking up business skills over the next few years. When combined with current tech experience I think I can then actually make real money.
I’m adding more if it dips hard. The earning was excellent.
TF, I never see TSLA plays, except the stupid ass memes about it on WSB lately. What advise nugget?
just be happy you got in at the start. other than losing everything, the worst feeling of is that you missed the train

You KNOW the PLTR fanbois will upvote this to oblivion. Ya’ll probably feel so outnumbered by us EVers, that whenever a post has the 4 letters PLTR in it=upvote. I’m not ridiculing, just an observation
These retards don’t matter that much. House always wins. Long term I’m extremely bullish (it’s spy’s time to fly, RTY too), short term I’m a greedy NQ bear
It definitely is diamond hands but can be very rewarding. Do you generally just roll your calls out further when you see that theta is starting to creep up? And what would you consider a high theta?
Because they're in the middle of a spinoff/merger. It freezes them till complete
Good place for SPY puts for a day trade
Only slept for 55 minutes today...PLTR feels like crack
Bro I hope you got out of these ahead.
Dad?
Boooiiii! Kandy train 🚂
PLTR buy the dip. 20 this week
SOLO is on it's own wave, it doesn't move with NIO
cruise shorts getting cucked HARD
Lol at these butthurt turds “don’t see s&p inclusion as catalyst to buy or sell”F you josh, so obvious, just trying to bleed it so you out the shorts before obligatory buyin begins.  They will bleed it as much as possible, would hold off on buying for a bit, before rip commences.  It should go lower, meanwhile pltr is the golden goose.
Without a doubt
Fuck me
Maybe depends on the hype, i could see 60-80 easy
Bro they just iPod a month ago and started trading options 2 weeks ago
Spy to 365 eod let's go
Yeah I held all morning then sold at 206 and fux myself outta 2k now I am waiting to get back in before tomorrow... hoping I could get in at 200-205

KNDI gang wya?
How much tho?
Floor is 250
THERES STILL TIME TO GET IN ON PLTR DONT BE STUPID
You living in 1998
Remember it's always darkest before the dawn!

I've been pumping PLTR hard since the dip last week.

And now the tendies gods are rewarding more than we can ever imagine.

Quick do a RH 1k instant deposit, and PLTR will reward you to cover before NSF.

PLTR is a 1 way train ticket to you already know where 🚀🚀🚀
i felt the same during august then the september correction came.

take your profits or the market will take it from you
The year: 2074.

I'm an old man now. My body is a shell of what it once was. My wife left this world some years ago. That's when the joy left. That's when hope left.

I'm not a religious man, but I sometimes allow my mind to slip away into pleasant things. I imagine holding her again. I run my fingers through her strawberry-blonde hair. Maybe it's in heaven, maybe it's not. I don't believe, but pretending makes me feel like me again, if only for one fleeting moment.

I turn on my neuralink and close my eyes. I flip through old pictures. It's her. I can almost smell her in the room. Lavender, and fresh wildflowers. It's enough to bring a strained smile to this old, callous, weathered face.

I open a browser and check SPY.

361.28.

It hasn't moved in decades now, it would seem. But I keep checking. I don't know why. Maybe the repetition takes my mind off things, or maybe it just reminds me of the old days. When I was happy. When she was here.

Sitting alone in an empty room, I let out a weak, broken whimper: "SPY flat... and gay."
i think part of TSLA being included in the S&P was an understanding their stock couldn't act like that anymore
[deleted]
Up over 300% on my pltr 05/21 leaps lol. Gonna sell and roll it out further on the next dip
nope :\[. I should have lol
I'm glad you like the buzzword but "vertical integration" is not something special.  Many companies make some of their own parts or own parts of the distribution channels.  It's been done for decades, Tesla didn't invent it.  Everyone focuses on manufacturing process that....manufacturers.  

The key to Tesla is Elon's genius, education and his seed money that came from paypal.  Nothing more, nothing less.
SPY about to experience an elevator down
dam I didn't even notice, portfolio too green
As much as I wanna meme and hold. I just don’t see how this will have any positive effect on NIO. I have a strong feeling the expectation and hype is priced in already. 
11/27 50c, probs gonna expire worthless but whatever. I’m gonna hold it but I’m 99% sure it’ll be for nothing.
Hold the line boys bears gonna get backed into a corner and start throwing their reserves at the wall just be patient
She will,soon.
It spent two weeks bullishly fighting its 54.5$ resistance, today it breaks out to daily high of 57.88, Ceo bought shares on november 9, very decent upside potential like  5-8%
I’m here for it. Just hit ATH ten seconds back
Yeah I think there must be a dip at some point for sure. Surely it can't just do 10%+ days forever
Love this HYLN action. Someone else doesn’t, because they are downvoting like crazy.
I sold all of it. Made a few grand. Nobody went broke taking profits on a +15% day.
JMIA is the easiest money I've ever made
What’s that noise? Just the PLTR train leaving the station. BYE YA FUCKS!! CHOO CHOO

Why does PFE all of a sudden not allow options?
I don't know if I hate Gamestop more because of how badly they ripped me off on trades as a child or because all of the Ryan Cohen fanboys who would willfully allow him to cuckhold their wives.

I sold BLNK at open when it dipped, because it hit my too-tight stop loss of 0.75.

The lowest it went was 0.7. Fucking thing broke it by only 5 cents. That option would be worth double now.

Then why did LI and Xpeng shoot up after ER 🤔
Who is buying the new V8 rubicon? Calls on Chrysler.
NIO $100
Hard to tell. May still be some room to make $ but it's risky for sure.
tmrw will be our day
i like it, the overhedge
You must have just sold because it just shot.
Made like $25 selling a CSP yesterday on PLTR instead of using same money to actually buy shares or calls. I was dangerously close to making a nice profit, glad I dodged it.

Cope. The dump already happened and it is back in a clear uptrend like it always has been for years sorry you missed out I would be salty too if I were you

ETM acquired sports betting company QL gaming.   

Sports betting is bullish a/f .

Because of degenerates like us .
What was the timetable between the change and the dump last time?
SOLO will dump hard if NIO fails to deliver. Also, how the fuck is this company going up? The car is fucking ugly as fuck! No one is going to buy that.
I'm hyped af brother. 

Another 15% day for the books WOW!
Virgin shorts?
Idk what the fuck is going on here...let's get it back up!!!
this is really frustrating, should I dump my call today? I feel like there's still a delayed reaction to come but idk
Nio-Nazis going to be in shambles tomorrow.
...more PLTR
$18 is the new floor for PLTR. It's up to you now if ~40 cents matters to you or not

Ok
I usually hold til shit crashes then sell for massive loss like a real man.
Downvoting a conflicting viewpoint is micropenis energy. Just FYI
MMs got bored and decided to try and see if they could make an actual straight line on the SPY chart for fun
Look up IV crush bro
Oh man, not this shit again
Alex Karp & Peter Thiel arent gonna unload their shares until pltr hits triple digits
GAZ 🚀
GME was beast on its way from 4 to 15.  Sell off in the market hit it especially hard...but with a buyout being hinted at by Cohen now and the fact that it is several times under its fair valuation, GME is going to run hard sooner rather than later.  Won't be like NIO going from 1.5 to 47, but it'll be at a bare minimum a 3bagger on shares, more on calls
“FUNDAMENTALS” OMG
Its a call on a blue chip with 3 days to expiry. Your contract will basically lose a quarter of its value per day until EOW if price doesn't move
Agreed ☝🏾
I'm an early bird so all good.
jesus we pumping... every chart looks like it peaked in June, Sept lol... Im loving this but come on... fucking MM going to rug pull :(
Because you’re the first who’s used a meme phrase on here
something gonna happen here soon. SPY tensing up like me after 2 strokes with ur mommy
I sold a couple mins after as well lol
I can't imagine there won't be a dump. Rode the wave up, but swapped to puts.

40p 11/20
35p 11/20

This is the way. Secure profits all along the way, roll up with profits with ITM

PLTR and OSTK keeping my portfolio alive
NIO wants to let loose so bad
Just need A M D to breakout and everything I own is green. Not gonna lie gains and losses really affect my mood
Too late to get in?
how do yall even use yalls day trades?   
because i dont get out within a day usually
i need to break even

I at the very least know for a fact this ain't matrix lmao stop scamming me
1. why
i bought some really cheap puts just incase it dumps for some reason bigly after earnings lol it won't but still a good lotto ticket
You’re not alone. I’d rather hold and lose everything than sell and miss the moon
Lmao hoes mad
Im holding my stonks but my calls are all being sold for put credit spreads
Alright bulls what are our low key plays that I don’t know about? Need some ideas to YOLO pltr gains
drop any winning positions
Why you selling shares man
west coast i'm assuming? What's it like having markets open at 6:30 am??
Which company did you defraud?
Scalp it
Yes and no - I like the holdings but the bid ask spreads on the options are wide enough that you basically have to hold them over a week or two
I need Tdoc to hit $200 by next week
This is the way
F*ck im retarded... how do I give them my $200 back?

Sad to say that I live for these posts..

Sold 500 @9.52. Congrats to all the holders.
what red market day
I was like I hope I’m buying the top lmao
Hoping for a good day tomorrow
Why do you think so?
I had a 17c. Sold it for a tiny gain because it started going down. Don’t ask me shit,
Tesla's focus on manufacturing process and vertical integration is a key component of their immense success, which is represented by their current position in the market. This isn't present in NIO or many other car companies, ev or otherwise

Lol true, I’m not holding anything I sold last week but if I’m honest this run up has been crazy everyone thinks that last Friday was the correction I’m not sure however I wish you all the best of luck for having the bollocks to hold 👍🏼.
Still won’t buy them, just like I won’t buy Zimbabwe dollars
Upvote if you’re holding NIO till after er.

Is ARKK a good one to get LEAPS on?
can someone tell me why my 11/20 WMT 155 Call is down 70%? it doesn't look like the stock is down but my call is aggressively tanking.
Yeah, corona vaccine is 🌈🐻ish for them. Imo, sideways/ down for a while. Condor or puts. Wouldn't touch calls
tesla somehow works inversely to purchases man, wtf
Markets are forward thinking, people know it will take time for vaccines to come out (6-8 months). Probably will be some pull back but it won’t be going much lower from here.
DRAFT KINGS GANG LETS GO
I held 1000 shares since IPO. Sold a covered call for 11c while it was 9 to lower my cost basis....

**bro are we seriously going “woke” and doing away with the “autists” user count?**
Shorts cant even hold GME down on a red market day. Y'all are actually fucked.
I think PLTR has room to run. SNAP is about to reverse off a good consolidation. RIDE has potential to be a beast in the next few days. Joining the EV wave
It’s my birthday and I just need to see Nio fuckin rock it let’s gooo birthday bump
so is NIO supposed to moon or dump hard as fuck here
IWM green.  

Reopening talks have resumed!
It’s called pyramiding. 

Pyramiding is not "averaging down", which refers to a strategy where a losing position is added to at a price that is lower than the price originally paid, effectively lowering the average entry price of the position. Pyramiding is adding to a position to take full advantage of high-performing assets and thus maximizing returns. Averaging down is a much more dangerous strategy as the asset has already shown weakness, rather than strength.

Just here to remind you autists that NIO doing well in earnings doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna moon, it can also crater hard, I've seen this game before

I think this could also apply to a lot of the EV companies that pumped in the last month.  HYLN isn’t the only one without an Elon type as the figurehead.
alright i’ll bite
Fail
SOLO you can do it
Bro no clue what i should do with nio... feels like this shit can dump every second but i kinda dont wanna sell tho
 The Infinite Bogdanoff Theorem states that in infinite parallel universes there are infinite Bogdanoffs that manipulate parallel stock markets to bog all stock traders simultaneously. 

A stock may thus be both pumped and dumped at the same time to screw traders on both ends of a play.
Volumes tapering on PLTR
In one year, SPY 350 is going to sound as crazy as SPY 200 does now.
RIOT up 50% wish I bought more than a grand @$2.96
I really like all my positions over long term with the exception of my March AMWL calls which I’ve been getting killed in, need to see how this winter and their next ER plays out in respect to covid.
So many idiots here betting on nio to sky rocket makes me wanna buy puts lol
Yah, he’s way to late for that quadruple next week. 

Next week!!!!
Nio going to be battery day vibes??
That would be pretty retarded...

But yes, lets.
Seeing everyone around me making money with my limp dick in my hand like Jack Ma
im addicted to buying BABA and DKNG

Can’t believe i owned PLTR 2/19/21 10c and i pussyhanded and sold before all this for minimum gains
Imagine waking up today and thinking “Let me buy PLTR puts”
We're old
Once you ascend you can do both, my friend. At the same time
I have 11/27 16.5p I am the most retarded 🤡
cmon man ! get a 18p or 18.5p 11/20  at the end of the day if she holds steady. Imagine how much you'll make when she plunges to 15 or 16 tmre
**Is it stupid to buy calls now at ATH?**
You could certainly day trade that if you catch it on a big swing. To hold overnight? The scenarios in which you lose money outnumber the scenarios that you turn profit, likely by a lot. BUT, if it hits, it’ll hit bigly

Rise from the ashes TSLA
Pltr you can do it hit 18.69 again
what’s 10Q

PLTR 75 eow
Everyone who thinks NIO is hitting $55 after hours is around 15 years old

Those are completely different models. Microsoft makes an operating system to run on any hardware. Apple makes an operating system to run on their own hardware, they just happened to be contracting the hardware out and now one more piece is done by them.
Bullshit really?

Literally everything expect MSFT is green in my account. WTF
PLTRs 10Q looks like shit to me, what am I missing there?
Its not negative...yet, but thanks!
If you ever feel retarded. Just know that there are people in South Dakota who are dying of covid who insist covid isn't real.
If $18.30 was your break even, I would sell once I do break even or just into the green. All it takes is one correction and your calls are dead at this point
Wow that’s a fucking stupid take.
CCL 11/20 18c ITM ❤️
It's going to dump regardless
Sour downvoters at it again... please downvote me too so I can feel your seething!
Still waiting for my tendies. Willing to suck off Chinese Elon.
Hold. Easy hold.
Epic buying opportunity incoming

honestly, who the fuck is buying CCL?!
everyone is missing out on JMIA...
NIO bout to 🚀
The way i learned is by doing 1 option at a time and see what happens then move with bigger calls however you're comfortable with. Imo if you think nio is going up, sell puts because those are way expensive
Dudes saying buy when it’s doubled in 3 weeks. Smart move
People like this don't understand market cycles
?
You think everyone sells tomorrow for gains?
I saw the news report this morning and bought calls and shares. I never do shares.
Sold spreads so hopefully NIO isn't too volatile today

WHATS EOW PRICE FOR PLTR
bubble
PLTR $16 12/4c bought yesterday... convince me to hold
Nio ready for liftoff
If it’s one thing I learned browsing wsb is to inverse inverse 🤷🏻‍♂️
You licensed Multivitamin piss yellow?
it's insulting that amzn would announce pharmacy delivery and kill cvs/walgreen then trade flat
Last week fucked me hard. Fortunately I went in heavy on PLTR and RIOT yesterday.
There are no sellers for PLTR until the end of December lockup period you dummies. free money.
Soros
I wanna know who has the largest gain % on Tesla calls today. Probably close to 2,000% lol
Shit
It really is wild. The act of actually selling/buying requires some amount of executive function/activation potentials in the brain, which is a scarce resource. It's less stressful to hang on to bags than to sell them, even if said bags are going to zero.
I dont know whats going on but im making money...
What I would do is
Foreal are we panic selling or not. Calls expire friday. Think I'm getting greedy and just need to GTFO
Why red tomorrow? Holding 05/2021 call and shares
DKNG LET'S FUCKING GOOO
[deleted]
Options or stock? 1/15 looks juicy but it's a $4 stock might as well buy shares
I don’t see it on RH. Therefore it does not exist for me

Tempted to buy some NIO shares to see what happens with their earnings, but don’t want to get absolutely annihilated
God I hope you’re right
Look at that trend line since earnings. Big boys like what they see. They are all buying.  We just in it for the ride. We heading north for the holidays!
Vxx puts when you don’t l ow what else to do is paying off. Figuring out next move
This. Dis+ is #2 streaming worldwide behind only NFLX.
Broke that....and here we go.
Exactly, why OSTK?
I hope inclusion brings back the days when TSLA would rip like 50% in a week. I wasn’t even on the train then, but it was entertaining as hell to watch.
fuck it, gonna get some 18 or 18.5 11/20 at the end of the day. No fuckin way this pos doesn't tank in the next 3 days
Have you tried selling
**[Compound option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound option)**

A compound option or split-fee option is an option on an option. The exercise payoff of a compound option involves the value of another option. A compound option then has two expiration dates and two strike prices. Usually, compounded options are used for currency or fixed income markets where insecurity exists regarding the option’s risk protection.

HYLN short squeeze baby 🤑
SOLO. NIO. CRSR. 🐮
damn nice. I think profits would be too boring on shares under like 100k$

i want to get around there where id probably do like 30% options 70% shares. and in the 30% options, 20% would be selling 10% would be yolos
Why though?
Ok thanks
RIDE got a 50k order. Securing niche part of EV market
Who else has no clue what PLTR does but still has a bunch of PLTR calls?
How much loan do the MMs have to take out to cuck aapl +/- 0.1% everyday?? where the hell are whales like softbank to break the dam?
If the coin crashes again and every institution has a stake, how sizable would a de-risking event be?
I’m down 98%
Why
looked at this about a week ago and went with DEO instead. wonder how they will do against each other
Being up 30% on these shares today is bittersweet af
eSsEnTiAlLy!1!
But you literally can
Someone pls explain BABAF
Venmo me instead
Small caps doing better than S&P 500.
Learning patience is easier
If you panic sold PLTR donate your brain to science so they can see what a grooveless brain looks like
Buy every pltr dip. Every single one!
It’s true. I’ve 3x my account in the last week by just taking profits and not hoping for the Hail Mary
Of course
haha pretty foooking much mate
Are you only buying options? Because I'd switch to shares with at least 75% of that
Seems like TSLA always shoots up right after I exit.  Goddamn it.
anyone have CVS?
Ah true, I don't fuck around with margins.  It's one thing to lose my own money, but when I have to owe interest on shit borrowed, no thanks.
Day trade. Sell top, rebuy correction. Sure, pltr is going to keep going up, but 18.75 is its top. Otherwise the momentum wouldbe keep going per hour basis.
I keep buying BABA it keeps going down. wtf is this shit
puts on high school physics
Tesla mooning and downvotes begin bears are letting out their death rattles
Gonna be HOT
Every dips being bought and the firms are barely catching wind
[removed]
Yes.
it's happening
HYLN ... not the EV pump we wanted .. but the pump we would gladly take
just remember you were scared to buy an 18 dip when it’s at 30
Can't believe mister open societies, open borders took a huge stake in PLTR. What a greedy hypocrite. Just goes to show these guys don't really adhere to any ideology except the mighty $$
Shares now, but I bought my calls last week.
Crwd mooning on volume. What’s the news
Yh definitely agreed in the long term i predict growth but at a slower rate do you have long term stock that you think are great for the long term
Have you seen the new pile of dog shit they put out as call of duty?
sellin tomorrow so i dont waste a day trade
now we can get airbnb for parties  so your calls go ITM  
big 🧠
Who knows. Who cares. Just please from someone that’s way happier to paper hands tsla at this point at least consider taking profits as you can. Weeklies print bigly but holy shit one wrong tweet and BOOM there goes your port right down the shitter

You and me both brother, have no clue why IV is still under 40%, but not complaining.  Actually up more % wise on my December 13s than I am on my PLTR Jan 20cs
Sitting on mostly equity. Options positions are Spy 03/19/21 $350c, qqq 11/27/20 $300p, vxx 11/27/20 $12c
Why ostk??
Sir, your calls will be fine. They are backed by the very foundation of the modern financial and economic system
Na i sold at the low😅😅 wish I held cause it looks to be bouncing back.  But I also bought more contracts for cheap an a shit ton of shares so I don't blow it back into options
Anyone else playing Dell earnings? My calls are starting to print, probably gonna sell next week because I'm too much of a pussy to hold through.
Love it, got downvoted, instantly up 1% since.

Lol I love it. No one selling PLTR and CRSR strap in
I bought 2 CVS $70.5 calls expiring 11/20 for $26.  Go big or go home!!! 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😂
You are dumb.
market overreaction to the amazon news
Let’s see here. The S&P needs to sell off positions in almost literally every one of their holdings and buy Tesla. 8% of float currently sold short, of which is only 80% of the total float cause elong owns 20%. All the shorts are going to have to cover, and a lot of buying pressure is going to be coming from the S&P in short order. 

We about to witness an incredibly large upward price movement or what?
Saving it for AH maybe?
"Police in North Rhine-Westphalia are testing research software from CIA consultancy   Düsseldorf The NRW police have put a new research system into test operation, which is based on software from the US company Palantir.

If you are holding calls for nio and earnings, and not hedging with some cheap far otm puts, check yourself

12/11 25 puts are only $27 a piece as a just in case

You never know what is gonna happen
We dare not sell palantir, the gains are not all accounted for.
How yall BABA holders doing
This is not the way.
Along with PRPL mattress to penetrate them on, then FSLY to livestream it to other chad bulls.
Good lord this past week has pounded my ass in the markets. I'll be the guy on the street corner holding the "will suck dick for money" sign

I think you should have taken less... Whatever it is you took.

Well Gus, we saw Michael Vix out on the field at morning warmups, he was held out of practice yesterday but the coaching staff is going to try and work him in to some reps today. The Bears clearly want to give Michael VIX the opportunity to recover because they know he gives them the best chance to win

Depends what your plan is and if you're holding long. This is just the start
Yeah, about 1.1% of their positions on average.

I can’t read.
We’re in the upside down
I love PLTR but it's going to dip back close to 17.
It’s in a coma
You don't know how contracting works?  Often, the contract will provide the specifications to the most minor detail on how they want a component manufactured.  They often oversee it very closely.  Even items that contain patents and trade secrets.  Now you know.  You referencing market cap is a flag that you are giving up since it's a straw man and has nothing to do with supply chain.
And how the fuck you know about this?

CVS really is a piece of shit
In all fairness it really shouldn’t be this fucking green today.  I didn’t buy puts because I think we get emergency authorization request from Pfizer or Moderna sometime this week or next and didn’t want to get crushed by that train.

But as an overnight play it made a decent amount of sense given CCL history.

PLTR: What is dead may never die
Same, but x10. Was up $80k in a day during red week, and down $80k in a day during the following green week. Managed to squeak out of the pandemic with a small (\~10%) overall loss.
Lol I just like callin myself dumb. Don’t worry I’m holding this shit allll the way bay B. It’s gonna pay off.
I’m holding til it goes back to like 18.50 or 60 and then taking my 100$ profit because I’m poor :)
BABA really gonna die a slow and painful death
buy the dip PLTR🚀🚀🚀  
its the bull way

66k in buying power?  Yeah it is.
This, I’m tired of people playing with lunch money.
Biden came out and said they're getting a 10 billion dollar loan, plus a partnership with tesla is a possibility that might be on the horizon.
I think the same, I finally have enough tendies to do shares and have it be worth it but still play options like a degen.
This just melts up every day. Dips at 10am then back to going up. 

And what is with all these random stocks popping today over 0 news?

And who in the shit is buying CCL? Wtf is wrong with this dumb shit market.
all these investment firms hiring "consultants" to give them the scoop on PLTR. seeing tons of postings. it means PLTR is on their radar and many still have not bought in.

Why
1 pm
I bought .0001 shares of PLTR why am I not rich yet
I work in a bar that also has a package liquor store. We sell tons and tons of White Claw, Truly, Corona Seltzer, and Crook and Marker. The others? They sit on our fucking shelves. I missed the SAM train and got cucked by TAP in July/ August. Good luck.
WHO THE FUCK WOULD BUY PUTS, WE'VE GONE UP FROM 222 TO 3-FUCKING-61 IN LESS THAN 8 MONTHS HAHAHAHAH YOU FUCKING RETARD BEAR, AND IT'S ONLY JUST BEGINNING.

THE YUAN? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Lmao I said this last week
No ducking idea
i cashed out when it pumped from 18 to 25, only to buy it at 27 some days later, now i‘ve decided to just keep holding it, one wrong timing and you will have to buy back higher or stay on the sideline forever
Volume and OI is ridiculous
Yep.. funny how every comment was about that till it gave back 2% in 5 minutes.
Buying and holding TSLA shares until FSD is out of beta. Then, or maybe before, it will Mars. I wish I had another idea. That one might take years. At least I can relax and channel my innerboomer.
You should see the karma I garner by just commenting that on shitty posts
You don’t sell PLTR today right?
I don't understand people who buy stock after a huge announcement and the price jumps 20%. Like dude, you're too late. None of this changes the fact that MRNA execs were mass dumping stock a few mos back.
Not planning on making major moves until February. So boring. So fucking boring.

Idk why ur getting downvoted, there’s almost nothing GameStop sells exclusively anymore. If people want a console they order one online - Amazon, Best Buy, target, Walmart and others all sell the same things. Video games? Same deal as the consoles but worse, more and more people are buying digital downloads straight off their console. How can GameStop transform itself into something relevant in this category without just becoming an entirely new company? Beats me
I’ll buy at 230??

FCEL went limp dick
Same 🤡🤡🤡
Same same was skeptical yesterday and didn't buy in, but I'm a believer now but don't want to buy at the top.
hold
for those asking where are the retards that bought the riot top, its me just letting u guys know beforehand
airlines are super volatile, but you said not boomer. so I dunnno wat to do
60$ jan 15 ostk call
You say that as if these retards are buying stocks with their own money and not margin and contracts.
We’re gonna look back on this time in trading like the poker players did during their boom. Don’t be greedy
Put it all into the Cardinals money line on Thursday
PLTR holding the Bollinger band. RSI is cooled down back to ATH
When does he speak? Normally we go down
Tanks? Gtfo
Alternate Currencies are up bigly today. Ill prob wait til it hits 20k to buy in though cause I'm dumb.
No such thing as an ugly billionaire
We have a trash trader downvoting everyone because of losing everything. LOL
Why? You will be rich if you hold lol?
Can't say exactly why it's been going down in the past few years, but I read recently they had some management changes and a larger focus on marketing, and it seems to be paying off.
Buy **BA**, 230 eow and 270 eoy
I've had multiple VALE $12c 2022 for two months now. I'm finally profitable today. I guess I should have doubled down.
This is the way.

Papa Enron just woke up from his cocaine-induced coma 🚀
Yes it does
DKNG printing, great time to go in. Loop Capital Markets analyst Daniel Adam initiated coverage on DraftKings stock (ticker: DKNG) with a Buy rating and a $100 price target.
ffs what is this quintuple top on NIO 46.6?
The options value implies it. It doesn't actually mean shit about the movement
Any news on weed stocks?why are they so up?
is ok, BABA just taking nap
If it dropped like 10% that would be tanking. A 2% drop on this is just a dip.
facts
We going up or down when JPowell speaks ?
[deleted]
can we just stop this maybe maybe mabye and go fully green already thanks
Expectation of 737 approved by EOY
I see kind of upset I’m watching but I’ve been holding it for a while so I’m good with the profit
Ha that may be asking for a lot
Just give it to him.  Unverified timing brags on WSB is what sustains us all.
So far until Xi forgives Ma
Because of what it’s doing now
You think so?
Damn BA is the market now
Time to BUY MORE!
goblina vooter is back. musta bought pltr at the top lmao
Agreed. I’m buying some NCLH puts now though
300 shares like a boomer bitch at 15.30$. To the moon brothers.
Setting sail on CCL 🛳

Sold pltr for double profit went in on boeing for 230 next week. My first day here is going pretty well.

HYLN!
Really hard to tell what it will do
what's going on with these positions? still holding?
Looking am for an option swing 5000$ ! Any options recommendations??
Holy hell my porfolio is 95% EV what’s some other sector good tickers, and you know I’m looking for that super volatile shit not boomer stock, how else am I supposed to lose money.
Good call. What's your next call?
Be ready to sell very fast if it starts tanking
PLTR $20 EOD $25 EOM $30 EOY $15 right after I decide to sell
PLTR takes a small dip and all the paper hands getting out 🤣
Up 11%
It's fuckin' printing money already. Got in at 14, just sold my 2022 call today, I hope theres a correction soon or lockdown news so I can load up on calls
They already have the contact tracing data for the entire US. The Biden admin will use this data to take us to tendie town.
Hold pltr call 11/20 19.5? I wanna day trade, only put 50 on
PLTR should merge with NIO and TESLA so we have our own rocket car ship who spies on gay bears
buy 1 BABA put please.



Edit: what did I say. what did I FUCKING SAY BOYS!!! CRSR AT 32 $ NOW AND YOYRE ASKING ME "How?!?" 

BRO THIS CRYSTAL BALL IS LEGIT ABOUT TO BREAK AT 40, FORTY BOYS!!!! YOU HAVE TIL 40 PT BEFORE MY CRYSTAL BALL BREAKS AND I WOONT BE ABLE TO MAKE YOU GUYS FREE MONEY!!! 

CRSR LRTS FUCKINGNGGG GOOOOO
All my homies fucking hate IWM. All of them
Long dated $spy calls and short the ‘daq
I want to sell my shares at $50 if it hits today. Stay cash. Then see how they're looking next red day.
Paper trading contest for the holidays to get the newbies ready for 2021. Let’s guide those with, newly found autistic powers, on how to engage them properly.
PLTR to $22 by eow
Probably never again friend
gg who ever was shilling CCL puts yesterday.
I got 30 since I wanted to put ~500 into it
Loss tons on ATVI before. Never play them anymore. One of those ticks that don't make sense
Calls on tinfoil hats
Hell no I'm not doing options. Might as well bet on sports
MARA up 10%, RIOT 15% since this comment.
Ehhh idk bout GME but the other two have been mint
Best I can do is .01
Lol @ the effort this one dude is putting into downvoting every new post right now
it's hope.  people hope it will go higher, and they hope it will recover. no one hopes "i'm up I should sell" thas y yoo shoodnt traded wif emoticons
he ain't wrong. There's r/smallstreetbets and r/babystreetbets for shitty positions posts
Did you seriously not see the 64 other PLTR posts in the last 24 hours?
Not a red day when it ends green..
The reason you don’t yolo 100% is so you can catch it up and then down. The more you know
hmm CRWD just went nuts cuz of big volume buying
Put the rest of all my savings in PLTR cuz I’m a retard fuck
Remindme! 4 months
$100*
Yeah - Covid cases surging everywhere with more and more lockdowns imminent, and we have all time highs right now with all three major indices (leisure/retail mooning)...This market is full retard.
Too soon, massive short squeeze is happening
Spy AH
TAP has been on a rocket ship the past few days! Expecting this to hit $60+ in the next 6 months (if not more, sooner)
It's goes up
Yes, always bank profits
You’re forgetting the third option:

BUY MORE!
Shitcoin going up is like an elephant in a tree, you don't how it got that high but it sure as shit ain't staying up there
I’m in the same boat. No day trades. And I went into next year with Pltr calls

Pruned Gardens die by Pacifism.

Usually salty people
i should buy 100 shares of PLTR
It's funnier when people are panicking lol
This is exactly what happened to me. Made 7k in one day on a bunch of puts when the market crashed in March, felt invincible. Now I’m sitting down about 16k and trying my best to make it back. Try not to get confident, always trading thinking you might lose but also don’t have paper hands
Your death rate numbers are off. As of yesterday, the US is at: 3.5% (253K deaths, 7.02M recovered) and 3.3% globally (1.34M deaths, 38.8M recovered). 

That’s a trivial calculation to get right. If you messed that one up, the rest of your numbers are highly suspect.
I did it. Yolo’d all of my savings LMAO I’m retarded
Oil companies stick money up his butt?
get into PLTR while you still can
how are pj traders the most powerful factor on stock movement. feels like everything becomes dead on arrival by open
Is there more?!?! The People NNNNEEEDDD MOOORRREEE!!!

#AWARDS
Yep, but not enough collateral right now - all of mine is currently tied up in... PLTR and Li Autos. Laffo. Either way, if Li moons or tanks after NIO earnings I'm gonna just go in for more PLTR by selling puts.
Hey, thanks to that guy back in May that said something about RIOT being the next meme stock. 
Sometimes you idiots make me money.
And fucking cash it out before posting unrealized gainz
🧐🧐🧐🧐
I hope you're talking about shares because IV will crush anything but an astronomical move.
This is the way
[deleted]
Dammit TSLA break $445
It’s a pos boomer stock
STOCKS. LITERALLY. ONLY. GO. UP. RETARD
Should I sell my spy puts???
thanks dont know who is downvoting
Any retarded bears short $IIVI its juicy and ready for a cliff dive
Imagine thinking that this is the last 19% day?
I disliked

Then I read the whole thing

Then I liked
Greed, in both cases
Market is grinding right now
Probably a sign gay bears wanna see, market flooded with retards, volume and volatility off the roof
Oh shit PRPL
Today or all time?
I'm done with that bs lol
So...just when i buy Palantir,  it tanks.
[deleted]
Did ba news leak or is it just buying on expectation? My covered calls are bleeding so badly.
good point
Up 2k in less than 10 mins on these pltr puts

Talk less shit lmao. Sold and waiting for a caller-entry point
Up 50% on Norwegian Leaps. Should I sell?
Look at the chart and the volume
lol someone mad and downvoting everyone

You can always make one more dollar
Every erection today is rigged so just cheat as well
This is the greenest red day ever, imagine holding indexes lol
#TSLA

Needs to break above $450 in order to make a move again. Level above is $460. Support at $430
Shitcoin doesn’t have options. What’s the point?
I’m holdin on for dear life
True that thing is mooning so hard i had to buy some
Yet SPY will not find any footing in the 360's. It's broken 362 on two vaccines, a new president, fake pumps and it's gotten rejected every time.

so I guess sideways we go
Please keep going PLTR. PLEASE.
$hyln gonna moooon
Tesla calls up $100+
Take profits man at some point 

Tsla can blow you up

I speak from experience
Get while the getting’s good
YALL ARE MISSING OUT ON RIDE!!!!!🚀🚀
humans are fucking gay
Just bought the dip beware retards
UPWK looks like it might just keep chugging along, but CRSR has its ups and downs. Kinda want to buy slightly longer dated calls.
Buy **BA**, 230 eow and 270 eoy
God I hope not... look at what it’s doing to PLUG
Aye, its just been going up consistently for so long, shocked it hasn't stopped or at least slowed down by now.  CRSR and NIO have been holding my portfolio up while GME slowly gets ready for its next serious run
AMZN wants to go under $3100
I love how bold the $100 DKNG target is lol. Go big homie.
The angry downvoter reeeeeeeeeees any new comment as he sees his portfolio sitting at -99%. A bear in his element
^this
Looked at BABA puts out of curiosity. They're down as well. BABA theta gang is winning.
My guess is that plus maybe another 5-10% to account for retard strength
God damn HD is getting fucked. Guess I'll pick up some puts on lowes for earnings tomorrow.
all aboard the JMIA train, $20 PT by new years
Pltr dropping
Wtf happened to hyliion
Why
those are some big red dildos on pltr
Fuck yeah it did
18.3 is still a food number to go in?
Bullish af spy 370 confirmed
But for some of the leaps that I bought, the theta is like 0.03, which is still fairly low but due to how many contracts, lets say 10, I am losing 30 bucks a day and 900 over one month. Isn't that alot especially if I've been holding since June?

Use YouTube. I've spent hours watching videos. Few things I would read up on, RSI, moving averages, & trend lines. Understanding these technical fundamentals will give you a good basis on technical chart analysis.

Comedy GOLD, better than the parks and rec script for the same scene
So what you’re saying is to take my gains and run away until March 👁👄👁
I'm too scared to sell CCs on BA cuz i want to keep my shares. it just keeps going
Anyone wanna buy this tsla put I bought just before the cnbc pump???
**BAM EM ALL!**
But lowkey the majority of posts are portfolios under 5k, which ruffles my feathers
Ok last time I complained about pltr it went back up we’re back again
PLTR doing its bull flag/refuel thing here
hold U forever, shits going to 200

Neither are my 11/27 $16P :( I'm holding on just because they're basically not worth anything anymore lol. Not gonna buy any more though...
I'm up 4200% and I could've gone deeper😭
ROLF just saw family guy with song “let my son die” the ending about John McCain had me dying
CCL is the next mooner.
Well, you better pull out new before it drops to the $17.
Baba Puts
I think pltr will retrace to 17.5
It isn’t officially included until December 21st
Couldn’t agree more 😂😂😂
Where is the high in holding CD?
This stress gives purpose and isolates from other pains or problems in life.
My whole portfolio is in these FDs, I want to close tomorow and dont want to get assigned. Also never sold before, I know I'll do some autistic shit if I do. Riding it out
Just cashed out on Mara
Damn RIP to all BABA call holders
This is the way.
Tonight baby
I just bought a $16 call expires 11/20 should I sell Friday? This is my first option
Why the fuck did you post a second reply 2 days after the first one?

It's a shit stock. Going up but very slowly. Hundreds of better trades out there.
Buying the PLTR dip to join the fun. Yolo
Riot went off
👎👎
But you’re still glued to the screen aren’t you?
Ban
I need to one day figure out trailing stops I just havnt so far
Sir, this is a casino.
Not until dec
CCL my baby
NNDM confirmed next memestock
Yeah and read the rules before submitting your $2 gain.
Wheres my VALE gang at.  Shit is on a moon mission
Sell my amd puts for a loss? they exp 12/4
Twitter CEO literally looks homeless like dude you’re a literal billionaire why do you look like you’re going to shoot up meth in a gas station
Nah every time i set a stop loss it triggers and the stock goes up 5% after
and the youtube guru's dude holy shit
George rr token
Cool. And how do I make money on this?
Thoughts: If TSLA held at a 15% gain today, the chance of a multiday run is lower. However, I think if it finishes today with \~8%, we can see multiple day runs.
460-70 is my guess
After hours today
Cocaine and hookers at my house tonight woooooooo!!
I can give you an erection for 1mil.

PLTR printing out free money today
Up a fuck ton today dec calls are juicy

I only have 20 shares and 1 1/21 22.5c hopin it goes up to 50
god speed
I'm balls deep in palantir calls, so I have the confidence to hold NIO calls tonight.

I'll see you tomorrow soon to be tendies

Tesla got included into the S&P, this means SPY gained Tesla's retard strength.

Green EOD.

Exactly
sold Palantir FDs. me vs. WSB. come get it retards.
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen. You wrote Tom’s lines so well, you’d think it was his actual lines.

16% rip = shares offering
Sold my BABA contracts for 50% loss, I need a new play boys.
Hey I bought a few after you made me think about it so I feel your pain
TSLA shares, TSLA LEAPS, TSLA month out calls, DKNG calls, GLXY and something I'm not allowed to talk about here that sounds like tit coin.
if i was bezos i woulda bought a billion dollars in pltr 16c 11/20's yesterday
Yesss, this is such a hidden gem right now. The chart looks so sexy.
CRSR is the way, 60 by summer
Seems to be paying off thus far
If NIO misses and dumps, is this going to be another battery day that kills WSB?
Thank you!!
No mine still up 20%

Stop losses are the greatest invention in trading. I can actually focus on my work and not be glued to to the charts all day
Fuck ATVI 1.6% intra day drop wtf is wrong with that company

Sure, if you want to get IV fucked and buy calls on a stock that's up 700% in six months.
Another PLTR dip, get in!
Buy **BA**, 230 eow and 270 eoy
I just bought the little dip

You should put your name on it somewhere but this is also very specific humor that won’t leave this area.

I’m unemployed so I’m just trading and making art and looking for a giggle where I can find it so feel free to DM me, this video made me weirdly very happy and I’d like to pay it forward

I can provide guidance as well [example](https://imgur.com/gallery/YkoAkdu) also happy to frame a specific screenshot, I already did my positions on 10/30 and it’s hilarious
So BABA is officially dead?
AI software vs hardware nvdia does AI processing. Not many companies does AI collection, which is needed for processing. HIMX has tech that allows you to collect cheaply and accurately. I wouldn’t be surprised if China is their #1 buyer. Even Uber will need them if they want better self driving data.
people are thinking they bought PLTR top and panicking. THERE IS NO FUCKIN TOP jesus

It’s going to the moon on the down low because everyone is watching PLTR
I bought like an hour ago at all time high and still made like 2k so far
Haha this beyond insanity big money is trying to trigger sell off by overhyping the lack of stimulus and trying to play stimulus news (like they did in September). News media like CNBC are buying in and once again talking about how no stimulus means recession, we have been thru a quarter without and somehow now it matters...

They make tendies.

SDC historic comeback!
Where’s the guy who sells 20% OTM PLTR weeklies cause it won’t even go up 20% in a week. Rip those shares
Lol some salty bear down voting everything, maybe just buy calls and you won't have to cry at night
VALE is going to help me bring my gambling addiction to all new heights, up 600% on a weekly FD right now.

Just curious why it was referred to as a token
Naturally
GME???TALK TO ME. GME GANG NEEDS TO GET PAID TOO, AND LETS GET NIO ROCKETING. ALL BULLS GET PAID.
mainly sells high end hardware components for computers but also offers stuff for streaming and it recently acquired some software companies
Hasn't dropped enough for it to be a correction yet. We are talking about a dip back into mid $17.
Way better link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnNCVfo3G-o

From a talk earlier this month.
I like the cars they have
Someone shorted pltr and is downvoting lmao
Yes, on any trading platform. TICKER IS PLTR. They’re $18 each.
That his ss number.
I wouldn't, but ymmv
That's on Friday bro if it doesn't continue pumping you get rekt. I'd lock the gains and buy another call with a longer expiry
Pos?
wow aren’t you totally normal

That’s how I feel about every position

KNDI has been a blessing
Any reason not to open a NIO 12/18 IC, 35/45p - 45/55c?  7.6 credit, max loss -3.4
HYLN has liftoff
Hmmm to dump UPWK and CRSR and buy back on a dip or not... UPWK 35c 1/15 (currently +100%) CRSR 40c 2/19 (currently +70)

They have to have a little correction after today, right?
$20 2/19
we really gonna test 262 every day this week aren't we. been doing this since sunday night.

spy. quit being lame.
Kept seeing that dude's posts about it and couldn't help myself. I'm in 11/20 22c for 50 contracts.
This is not how the day was supposed to go
bought cheap. it'll probably fuck me in the ass but still have a few weeks before expiry should be able to sustain any pullback...praying!

Agreed, def overbought. Volume is already at 107M compared to avg 37M. If I can’t hold $3.95, I’m out. Will prob come back in later
What color are solo cups? Red. Buy puts.
Yeah up 15% already today and I have until 12/11
I was not clear on what i meant, i am thinking buying NIO puts around $25 expiring late December. Is this still idiotic?

Holy fuck my only regret is that I didn’t buy more KNDI. 🍭
That PLTR dip got gobbled up quickly
End of 2021? 40+
Macy’s will be next bbby. You heard it here first
Anyone know where I can buy a spacesuit for this palantir rocket ship?
eom
Sell a strike down
Imagine putting PLTR and sell in the same sentence
me earlier: bought a bunch of pltr leaps this morning. won't look at it for months.

me now: looked at it-> "holy fucking shit..should i sell??"

GO DOWN SO I CAN BUY PEACEFULLY YOU POS SPY
Eow*
Here. Glad I won’t end up 99% down this week
SPY will **NOT** tank while BT.C is mooning

MMs cannot handle outflow from stocks when BT.C is this attractive

Young money & inheritance VS Old money and institutions
IM COOOOMING
buy PLTR shares for god's sake. its going to 100
Yes it is. It's exactly what's it's like.
[deleted]
17k. We just smashed a 28k one back at 18. We good. Gang gang.
A bunch (too many, slowly closing out a lot of them), and still requiring cash collateral to write calls against any of them
50-80 imo
Thank you
It’s literally the only alt worth holding besides Ether stay poor though
I just shorted the whole Russell IWM. Cruise, restaurant, little banks, etc.
What if I sold shares to get more calls??
Took your advice 👍. Cheers
[deleted]
What does CRSR do???
Bless RIOT

Bless the elongated muskrat

Bless bless
Corsair makes me wet

It'd be a miracle but I hope so.
Hell yeah, KNDI go brrrrrr.
Today is a good day. Not for the future of my personal rights but the portfolio? 🔮🚀🚀
Id hold it, look how many wsb idiots just bought calls thinking they’ll be millionaires by Thursday
SOLO is a company

BULLL GOODS TESLA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀please
Fuck rkt. Youre such a pos. Fucking cock sucker
I can see that getting tied up in anti-trust limbo.

I also have 100 shares I’m selling CCs on though so I’ll be okay either way
Saruman, uses a "palantir" to surveil his enemies.
The casino always wins
Well I can't sell my PLTR FDs due to pattern day trader, see how this pans out
I’m depressed
Honestly for perma banning accounts that post complaining about their previous post getting taken down. 

If there wasn’t so much bitching about “I ToLd yOu So” post real post could make it through just a thought.
Moment of silence for the 🌈🐻
Goooooo🚀🚀🚀🚀
I fomod into pltr but with shares

Now I could care less if this bitch goes back to 10$ because I'll just average down 

Is this what shares are like? Jesus man i need more money this is so much more relaxing
I hope those guys that I told to buy PLTR 11/27 17c did so it’s tendie town already
Inverse me for fat tendiez
tesla at 444 for good luck
Gooooo🚀🚀🚀🚀
Any idea why?
Great DD, enjoy the ban

Pltr 20c 11/20?

Too bullish?
I'm such a pussy.
I had feb 22.5 calls 14 made 5k
[deleted]
Oh no just wait for the government news on it about a deal
😂No need for news, just can’t let it die. Keep the faith. 🥺
So who’s buying tsla again?
Ehhhh its certainly an option my g 🤣
I bought a weekly. RIP to me if it doesn’t keep pumping
Fr fr
TESLA GOOOOO
Hopefully forever
no, am not okay😂do i double down?!
MARA $3 11/20 calls just went ITM will it hold?
Been burnt too many many times buying the top. I’m letting pltr go.
*pokes* thinks baba is dead
SDC V shape recovery lmao
10 20c 3/21 will rollover next month.
PLTR we taking this to $50. when you cash out any calls, take profits and buy shares. its your civic duty
[removed]
bro, the plebs can fight a civil war while i chill with my tendies.
im down 50$ overall since it keeps dying but i sold a 195c 11/20 against it to hedge, it should be over 220 by 1/2021 anyways
Ouch
Overbought and I did puts. 

Just going off of technicals but it can be pumped. 

I got out so my advice is retarded.
He ded
-10% goddamn... Oh well
GameStop
What was the losing play?
Sell to me
PLTR dip greatly exaggerated
TESLA GOOOOOOOOO DADDDY
i’m with you. 

i’m thinking once the supreme court kills Obamacare, disruptors like GoodRx will save a lot of people.
No one here knows that
it has to if it's going to be 500 EOD
Held PYPL forever and it always disappoints
How big was that $18.75 PLTR Wall
Feb SPY puts, Dec CVS calls
😈 Lucy’s on my side can’t go tits up.
EV pump is coming boys just wait
You have no idea, the betting market is completely unregulated here and there is a market for everything. I've lost hundreds before betting on 4th division semi-pro Bolivian women's volleyball.
370 eow, no such thing as bad news anymore fam. All is well, buy calls and get rich
ARKK ETF has essentially a 10% position in TSLA. So for 1/4 to 1/5 the cost of TSLA, you can ride a fund that derives 1/10 of its value from TSLA.
False.
Everybody focused on NIO and TSLA, but what about Lordstown Motors busting out right now?
Wouldn’t be a bad idea
that dip lasted as long as i did HNNG
palabears actually thinking there is gonna be a paladip?   


you must be palastupid?
Corsair yesssss
Lmao “down 90% will hold til expiration if i have to” 😂
If you sell PLTR shares or calls you're retarded. Theres literally no reason not to hold this overnight the momentum in this stock I haven't seen since NIO was at 12 bucks
You need to go to r/investing
Just bought 10 3/21 20c I'm in!
12/18 At the money
Yeah okay buddy. How’s BABA doing for you? Clearly you don’t know shit! Pussy.
Make sure to report back once you lose it all
I just bought a 11/19/21 $25C
did elon just wake up?
If you guys aren’t buying this Tesla dip idk what to say. It’s gonna touch ATH this week
Tesla calls officially free money
i hope you sold.
who is pumping raise your hands..

there are probably some news out there in private circles.. they know before us..
I’ll buy your calls bro
SoftBank has entered the chat
do i double down on 11/20 CCL puts? my 17P are not looking too good rn😅
Made 3k from 1.5k on tsla today. Up 50k overall from 3k. Idk I prolly am doing it wrong
PLTR but for low-T femboys
DKING gang rising up
You def did
have like 2k in puts
look at that chart, if im not a bone head theres another 10k.
I've lost fucking 33K since last Thursday. Which was like 50% of my account. What the fuck dude, can't make a damn winning play!

- sir, this is a wendy's
Exactly, I'm never selling
I am exhausted... i want to take a break.

Whats the sure fire play with low tendies... nothing fancy that I can lrt simmer for a month?
tl;dr
I am badass
TSLA Gang here too
I know it’s going to beat, what I don’t know is what that’ll mean for our porfolios. I feel like most likely a tank Bc of how overvalued it is currently. But fuck it. This is a long hold
Is this just you bragging to people you don’t know on the internet? Good job bud
That escalated quickly..
Damn BABA just gonna shit the bed forever I guess 🥺

Who woke Tesla up I love you

PLTR shoved a rocket powered Shrek dildo into my ass and I fucking love it.
Ok you fucks I bought the dip on PLTR, don’t you going paper handing me or I will start requesting tax information to claim you as dependents for all the money you cost me. 

12/4 22c
it only went up because you sold. this is the law of the universe
No need for a day trade.  Buy and hold for a bit.
Do it pussy
[deleted]
I sold and bought further OTM calls lol
Tdameritrade and robinhood have some really good free online material on fundamentals, I believe TDameritrade even has free courses
I’m about to take a loan out and invest it all in PLTR
1 by 1 my picks flip from red to **GREEN** - gg bears
Sorros just tried to shake some fools off the rocket ship. Not me you America hating bastard.
There was your PLTR dip next stop 19
I smoked a joint with Peter Thiel
YALL GONNA BE SAD YOU DIDNT BUT AT 18 WHEN IT LEAPS TO 20
Buying U shares at 95-100 and selling at 115-120 is so easy
Pltr the new NIO get in now before you miss out on your bag bros
Just picked up a CCL put cuz with the rising cases and vaccine for the masses still far away, aint no cruises going out for a loong time. Once vaccine hype fades and reality sets in, its definitely going to crash
Whaaaaaa really :,)
For all those saying it did already, i wasn’t here for it lmao
Why would you sell? Hasn’t even reached break even price.  Diamond hands that shit
[removed]
I dont know how i could live without a fancy massage chair
Bought a 11/20 put for 19.5 PLTR should I day trade it and collect my profit? Only put 50$ on at 78 rn or stay

Who's shorting NIO by end of the day though?
Fb undervalued
Super ass
Could get 2 of em
[deleted]
A token?
I they’re here to YOLO retirement and risking having to work two part time jobs between Wendy’s and Walmart greeter, then they’re right at home.
All this nonsense being shilled and RIOT up 35% ugh.
Guys bought my first call and its for pltr, hope it prints
bought 10c SDC at 0.05 each, 500% so far
[removed]
Gap up aggresively
bro it aint dipping down to $16
PLTR GANG LISTEN UP. DONT LET THESE PUSSY ASS BITCHES TELL YOU TO SELL. WE HOLD. YOU MISSED THE NIO RUN UP, DONT MISS THE PLTR RISE. FOMO IS FOR HOMOS!
I heard 300,000$ evaluation by 2022 I believe it Tbh

I see,   what's your cost/share?
ive been playing the dips since 6:30am lol
PLTR short squeeeeeeze
I think it’ll beat
#FCEL

Any fellow autists playing FCEL? I picked up a few leaps yesterday $4 calls 1/15/21 at .68, sold 1/4 at open 1.65, still holding the rest.  Tempted to sell some some here. 

Thoughts on FCEL?
The pain when you sell your PLTR calls too early 🔮
Same loool
SPY is a meme stock
I plan on grabbing some end of the day for next week though
Over reactionary much?
NVDA giving me slow death since September...
Fox con news?
Yeah honestly I’m quite new to this and didn’t realise that it could happen too
Keep pumping PLTR boys I just bought calls on margin like a true autist
Fucking PYPL why can't you just be more like SQ. I am disappoint
bro idk im retarded just buy it and ride it with me
I was down to like 8k from a 10k start and PLTR , a few SPY weeklies got me to nearly $16k. I do have a put on JWN and I sold a TSLA 420 call for a $50 profit before it 🚀
Ladies and gentlemen! Now it s time to buy TSLA
So you like pump n dumps? Enjoy. Probably hyped up WTC in the past too
I got the 17.5p. My rule is when it loses 50% of value, I sell. It's pretty damn close right now.
# rip whoever panic sold
Dont lie PLTR is the matrix itself lol
the only gang I wanna be a part of
[deleted]
PLTR posistions, quickkkkkk
I bought at 11.74. up almost 60%. Just sad it's only 4 shares.
Tesla nice
I’m holding 100 shares til death. Who’s with me? Tonight may very well be a blood bath but I will fight with honor
Last chance for spy poots
Wait until you get married 😝
How do you sell calls off of leaps?
I feel yo bro.
what kinda paperhands are you?   
if you buy leaps you're supposed to hold that shit
CRSR is fucking mooning today
PLUG gona drop the kids off for the next few trading days
Will TSLA hit 460 again before close? Survey says?
[deleted]
not when 45k sell walls are being broken in 30 seconds

🏳️‍🌈🐻
Mine is AAPL
PLTR thanks for the tendies and the fun, it was a pleasure playing for today.
Pocket sand!
4666,00 and 6066,00. Just got off the phone line with devil and he confirmed that you are safe! 😂
PLTR to dip back down to 16, just buy in then if you missed it

It won't be this cheap again

I was waiting for $15 and it's never gonna happen fml
please explain the dynamics of NIO r n. wtf
Yup same
Up $3k on kndi calls today
What a pussy
Where’s the CCL puts guy?  You ok?
$AWK down nearly 3% today

F for Michael Burry

PLTR - who wants to be a millionaire?
NIO waking up
This is how I find out about TSLA and the S&P and I couldn't be more happy.
"i bought more tesla! yay me!"
Ughhh fuck that stock, it’ll be down again tomorrow. This happens every now and then
Letting tsm cool off for a few days or going back ?
It was 2% red this morning
PLTR is a meme stock because Thiel named it after a token in Lord of the Rings
If the price is moving faster than the time you set your price and execute...that available price is gone. You will need to update your offer to the new price. Or wait until the option price returns to whatever you set the buy at
HAVE FAITH TESLA TARDS
As a pig, like the IRA said to Thatcher, you only need to get lucky once.
You sure that’s wise with a 360 rock solid floor?
Congrats! But still your dd was trash
the us heading towards civil war and you fags are cheering on SPY370. What a clown world we are.
Draftkings I love you
You bought and sold both puts and calls just today? No wonder you don’t get anything right....
[deleted]
Here comes another pump
Yolo
Who
Tesla gang making a come back!
did you even look at why they are falling?
bitchc0oin already making a run at 18k

I guess its just gona go up 1k every day forever
I also wanna know
Nio will run at 2pm
It is statistically riskier to invest in an ETF than it is to buy the PLTR dip
I dont know but its killing me
So tempting to sell $23c 1/15/21 Pltr
He should have worn more suntan lotion...

Going to read for an hour. Dont do anything stupid PLTR
debit spread that bitch . should run again but who knows when
na tsla better at this point for a day trade
You’re not trading on the job? Lol good luck getting rich
Change my mind:

Amazon in a year or two tries to buyout goodrx and consolidate the rxcard savings game?

Mkt cap of $14.8B, bezos uses that to wipe his ass each day. Why not?
[removed]
Right?? Put 4k then lost all.. might as well put 16k and lost 12k
You didn’t. Remember all the Cucks who tried to stop NIO lol.

Okay now I’m convinced to buy cruise puts. NCLH 11/27 $21.5P big time
HYLN boost mode
Spy starting a new colony on the 🌝 we shall call it tendie town
Too high buying puts
Y'all jerking it over pltr, when you could be swimming in kndi tendies

Shit 10 red days May be time to buy
They bought a company yesterday.
Noc 2022 600c, you have 2 years to hope a war breaks out
And everyone clapped and boo'd at the same time
Why do think you think it’ll have a big miss?
If tech calls are bleeding you dry just remember at least you don’t work at Foxconn
same just wish I got more lmao
PLTR GANG I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE *INSERT ROCKET EMOJI* MOON MOON MOON
Mine is Zoom
Yes.
OP position please
I've got a few February lotto tickets for when they full rebrand as an electric company lol
African-American projects you racist piece of shit.
Yeaaa I mean, isn’t that how we do options? Smart money don’t get tendies.. halppp
The spike was just everyone's hype, and the fall is everyone selling to make profit from when they bough roughly at $404. Youd be an idiot to hold that influx in a short time when previous days show negative.
Who else bought the dip pltr
These girls on CNBC grade A retarded, “we’re been here before the market knows how to act” yes last time we were here we had a stimulus
Nice, wish I had bought some more when it briefly dropped under 4k. Was close to pulling the trigger but the fact that it dropped so fast that day sorta scared me. Oh well.
This is the way. I did the same timed it all wrong as the norm.
BUY THE DIP
The PLTR dip got gobbled instantly
spoken like a true gambler
Thanks for the reminder. Solid play
[deleted]
Y’all talking about PLTR but CRSR is just as beautiful today
TSLA with an almost perfect looking reverse head and shoulders on the 1m chart.
Same. I bought shares the second it IPO'd. Flipped for like $80 profit lol
Baba will eventually go up. Just be patient.
TSLA recovery when
Lol nio puts
ok 🌈🐻
I am up $1.25 for the day. That’s a win.
my PLTR 11/13 16C and 17C walked so that my 11/20 17C could fuckin run
HOW THE FUCK IS ZOOM STILL RED
should I short 5,000 shares of NIO into earnings?
Why got this shit so high today?
i sold my calls.. this stock is on steroids so idk. maybe sell some to lock up profit and let the rest ride?
Good luck to ya, hopefully it works out
Anybody else trading TCNNF today?  Decent dip (5%) after the earnings call this morning followed by a steady rise.  Really solid pot / cannabis organization.
Can’t but PLTR Bc work, any other $580 yolo?
PLTR just stopped at the moon and is refueling for MARS
same
NIO puts
BABA is the champion of fighting the stairs up for an hour to gain 30 cents only to drop 2 bucks in the next minute.
I sold my PLTR leaps way way way too damn early. 🤡
I’ve seen “BABA is a great buy here” constantly the past 2 weeks lol
Anyone know why HD just tanked out today?
Here it is boys. This post right here.
Mcchicken
Would it be worth my last day trade to buy this PLTR dip?? HALP
CNBC is trash today.
[deleted]
I bought some more this morning. 4 contracts of 12/24 $30c. Hoping we have a few more days of this pump
Yall have a stock you can never get right? 

TSLA is that for me bought both calls and puts today and sold for losses.  Probably the 10th time ive done that, no matter what I can't ever hit the swing.
What do you think yall. Nio a good idea?
[deleted]
FOMO’ed into that mini dip PLTR, I hope I didn’t buy at the relative top lol
Buy **BA**, 230 eow and 270 eoy
Literally the moment I placed a chunky call they decide to pull this shit. Just my luck
Put 61$ on tesla 545 calls exp Friday let’s gooooo
I sure hope so, but I only got a pair
Buy high sell low baby
Thiel's spaghetti
Considering the price of GPUs and the general components (not including SSDs), I keep seeing the price these components going up slowly, and customization of PC building is quite board, not to mention even with a vaccine covid will be around for at least a few more months. We got Black friday and cyber monday coming up, with christmas. I would like to see upward momentum till EOY. After that more a steady increase but slower. I took logitech as an example based on Revenue, earnings, and P/E, just the basics. Long term hard to say but they make solid products, just their software icue is garbage and needs to be updated. Hopefully with going public they got the cash they needed to refine certain processes.

TLDR:

Short Term- Good

Long-Term - okay-ish

&#x200B;

Edit:

Disclaimer: Wife (boyfriend) : Bought at $26, shares, cause dumbass
It does work for every single alphabet agency in the US and NATO the Marines etc.

TL;DR publicly traded skynet
What r u guys doing with FCEL? That volume is still going up up up...trying to decide if I double down on calls or not.
It's up $0.03?
Alright boys, down to my last $2.84. Which yolo shall it be?
Imagine actually making money lmao
amzn calls 11.20
Hold the line valiant knights of PLTR we shall slay 19 and 20 soon enough
L. Burning money.

Congrats to PLTR holders me and my paper hands and shares in my play account salute you
PLTR dumass
This bump is him exercising his $9 calls he bought for $.5 per 3 weeks ago
You sound......frustrated. We’re you not holding Tesla onktions yesterday?
I can’t do it. I guess I hate money.
Just YOLOD 39 shares, first time doing so
Funnier if it showed red, like normal.
Sold a $20 call against my shares and now I'm scared it'll be called away as it runs up more by end of the week
THIS.
wish i waited to sell
https://imgur.com/gallery/xSWvyja
PLTR refueling rn
Nah
These bitches can’t say they didn’t have another chance to get in
This woman on CNBC can’t stop saying “you know”
When does lock out end?
PLTR puts up 20% just like that
Shhhhhh...don't tell them but this is the way.
Just sell it man
Wow hyln just went vertical. Fuck me for missing out again
I feel ya, just give it time. It should keep pumping
Damn Palantir just crazy
He started at 10 am?
Same, 310 shares at 14.91, 2 2023 20c, added another 100 shares this morning at 17, hope it dips for my next paycheck
its that peanut company
That’s fr the move maybe I should swing trade this move 🤔
Nice! First legit DD I've seen here in ages (no, I didn't read it I just saw you talk about a sector with a market that currently exists)
Baba bagholders be like "it will go up eventually,  270 eow" after seeing it dumping for 10 days straight🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
CRSR ❤️🤤
This dip aboutta be bought half y’all ain’t even got in yet
Okay I hopped on, I’m sorry boyz
pump the 🚀 boyzzz tsla landing on the moon
PLTR DIP 😍
DIP BOUGHT LMFAO
This needs to be the WSB slogan
SOLO is NO PLTR.
This woman is talking more gibberish and non cohesive sentences than 😴
Just buy psth if you want a guaranteed double but if you’re dreaming big then go all in on crsr
you were right
Lol L. You just burnt money.
Ford you little slut I love you
Pltr drops .5% 

Wsb: BUY THE DIP

I did
Bought my Tesla call at 437...near perfect timing 🥺
> He brought $1,000 home to his mother, who disapproved of his "gambling"; he countered that he was not gambling, but "speculating".

One of us! One of us!
Nothing stops this PLTR rocket
If NIO has a big miss this afternoon, how low does it go?
No
This is nuts. Everything is fucking mooning.
# RIOT (against GUH)
By soon i mean now.
#PLTR is giving you the opportunity to get in before take off

#Would you capture it or just let it slip?
I have 20c for Jan, and have decided to let it run.  I cashed out of NIO and SPCE way too early  mostly because I didn’t like so much of my account tied up in a meme stock.  

Now my account is big enough that I can let it roll for a bit.
Sold PLTR after it bounced off 18. Guh!
you should be buying NNDM instead. it's cheaper and will moon
Get the Xbox
LMAO😂
CRSR with the consistent long term strength we haven't seen since PTONs run up
CRSR 12/18 30c.. take profits now and wait for a dip to get back in.. or just let it ride?
been thinking about deep ITM leaps for forever now, I think EV is gonna pop it over 10

I mean, 4c 2022 is only like $9 breakeven, if you go to Jan 2021 you can get 3 and 4c for almost breakeven now, and that's buying at the ask

Could've got 4c 1/15/21 for 8.75 breakeven this morning
PLTR Dipped and TSLA Ripped at the same time...
You better sell them soon.
YOU CANT STOP $FANG 💪🐮
My dumbass wants it to go back up so the 2 calls I bought like 30 minutes ago can give me baby gains

Got cheap Feb calls on that Friday dip because I did my DD.  
Didn't do no puts because I'm not a gay bear on something I own stocks in.   


Holding through ER. Suck it you degenerates. NIO TO THE MOON
So Elon brought out TSLA shorts just so the SEC wouldn't fine him again? Very cool and very legal.

Why not calls and actually make money ?
Going to max out margin on Robinhood, max out my credit card and throw in my whole bank account into a play for the yolo of the year. What's the move WSB? GIVE ME THE PLAYS.
Are you telling me stonks can go down?
It’s went up $3 past hour, how does that look ded?
Say a prayer for everyone who is going to either get made or wrecked by tonights NIO earnings. It takes more strength to love an enemy than a friend because even the wicked enjoy good company.
PUTSSSSSSSSS
Made a small play on dkng yesterday and am up $700.  Should I sell or hold?   That’d buy me a brand new Xbox
BUY DIP NOW
I’m in! Just bought some calls!
I think I bought the top on PLTR! SORRY BOYS
Placing a small hedge on my nio calls, holding these hoes after earnings yoloooo
Where my NIO autists at? 60 EOD
After losing 75% of my portfolio a couple months ago, i bitched out on going all in on tsla yesterday when I wanted to....i would have been swimming in it
It’s up 14% on the day. Some people are going to sell
Looks like correction is here.
Hold
incoming PLTR dip
Pltr
pltr buy the dip
Trade volume low and it’s still killing it.  Can’t wait for people to catch on.
I had 11/27 $16c and sold them way too early.
we are not in trouble. we are the trouble brethren. buckle up
TSLA.... Go!!
And then Ben Shapiro jumped outta the bushes.
Amazing! 

  
Now you need to YOLO all on $YOLO (and yes that's a ticker)
HYLN taking off
Detox year lol
Good time to get into SDC
NVDA, sell before earnings.
You know you can sell right when you’re up 300% and then buy a dip again. Just saying
10% return? i would rather sell at 99% loss. go to fucking wendys if u think 10% return is good retards
sell me on it
HYLNNNNNNN

I'm 700 in at 18. Probably when I get bored of writing covered calls on them ill sell.
yes
Love the format but the guy should be the s&p, the drum should be short sellers/puts
ban
I’m not sure I understand
Lol what do you think I would actually research a stock and buy it on anything other than emotions? What is this r/investing?
Because every post on WSB is 'PLTR' which means the top is fully in.
I opened my Robinhood account 2 weeks ago so I am really new to all of this. Should I sell or hold my 28 nio shares?
#PLTR 🚀

Beast mode, picked up $30 calls 2/19/21 last week at $.50 each. They’re at $2.05 now. Going to reload again in this dip
everyone on here on PLTR, time to buy puts
Just fomo’d into some 12/18 20c. Seems pretty goddamn safe considering soros and the ark bitch.
I didn’t buy...I feel so dum. Is it too late now?

Wouldn't selling 17p be an easy play for you then? Since you want to get in at $17 anyway?

Be careful with APHA. It may moon but it tends to lag when compared to other cannabis stocks. It’s surprising because the fundamentals are one of the best in that sector, and they are making big moves recently
Tempting though!
Makes exercise bikes out of paladins
I sense a hint of bitterness in your voice. Also find it interesting you bet on American sports from the UK.
Respect the self-reflection. After all, money is money
Have 11/20 17p bought yesterday. Tempted to cut losses but I know this has to drop before end of week. But then again I know nothing.
I got hacked yesterday and the hacker wiped me clean
You’re in the green today. I bought mine at the same price as you
I just bought Ford stock.  What the hell is wrong with me.

PLTR TO 20 SO SOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚
BUY THE DIP
$18.75 is the next big block to knock down then $19.00. Expect a lunch dip soon though I think...unless the whales are eating at their desks today.

I need someone to write me a “yoloing for retards”. I try and buy some weeklies but they always end up being too close to expiration and not crossing to itm so I just get left with my dick in my hand

I’m up 20% on pltr 11/20 20c. Fucking holding
Hard bounce off of 18.75
Any gain is better than any loss
I got 6k in 42c 11/20 holding for earnings most likely

No PLTR is the way sir
Never buying pussy ass debit spreads ever again
Do you know why my palantair calls haven’t filled? I bought two like an hour ago at mark price
Why the fuck did pltr just plummet

LMAO my dumbass thought I was in trouble buying more PLTR at the top at $17 this morning... Jesus Christ
Fuck the calls. Imagine not holding PLTR stocks. Shits free money. Up 22% in a day..
Yeah my avg share price is 15.91 and I sold 18 weeklies for I think .45.. so if and when these get called away my avg price will be like 15.5 on an 18 sell.. I’m fine with that. Will suck if it’s trading at 20 that day but that’s life
[deleted]
I'm holding on for dear life until powell speaks
BUY THAT DIP YOU ALREADY KNOW THE DRILL
have some TSLA 9/17 430C - up 25%....not sure if i should sell and move the strike out or just hold for a little bit more
Jesus christ robinhood stop losses don't work for fucking shit dude

Is it too late for pltr?
CRSR and U GANG, in 2022 there will be no more malls only e sports arenas
Why would you exercise? Sell it when it still has extrinsic value.
PLTR NEVER ENDING YOU FUCKING BITCHES BUYING PUTS WILL SUFFER
thats a smart way of looking at it, im up 700% and was wondering how long to hold it for
Hopefully sub 20 because I sold some covered calls for way too cheap
The spread will close, or you can try and wing it by placing in between and hoping for Market Maker to help you.
I'm not worried about losing money on the shares. I'm just wondering if shares or calls more likely to make **more money** in my specific situation. I'm leaning towards just holding the shares, but I wondered what more experienced people thought.
the fuck does PLTR even do?
Everything I sold out of yesterday for small gainz is absolutely ripping today.  I'm not sure if it's worse to lose on a play or to take profit too soon.
Dump your cash on tesla and get rich, it’s that easy
Hey man, it worked out! Thanks!
never.
Spy she whispered in my ear and said "your puts make my pussy dry"
PLTR gonna drop sorry fella I just bought the top.
PLTR FOMO will send this bitch to Uranus, no doubt about it
Literally cannot fathom
TESLA WOKE UP
60$ on 700 here. Pretty much the same
Yep.. well BA/RTX.. combined both calls i'm up like 50K rn..
Will do. Whats the best time to sell? After lunch or right before closing?
How many did you buy? I bought 50. And whenever if dips again tmrw, I’ll go in again.

Shut up europoor
If it goes like this like NIO it'll probably hit 50 year end.
Jesus BA 40% in less than a month
A retracement can happen. Large mkt caps don't usually jump 20 percent in a day
Doesn't seem like a WSB attitude, but using only "house" money whenever you can is the smart play.
QCLN because your actually just buying nio and tsla but different.
Took gains pltr too early. 


Pain.
PLTR puts seem like the move
Oh shit

What's PLTR doing?

*He's beginning to believe...*
I can't say I've got a price target. As long as its worth more than I have put into it, I'm happy. I started DCA'ing back in March, $50.00 a week. I'll be retiring in 10-12 years, I'll probably let it run until then.
I’m a girl lol but thank you!
Everything just cause anymore. Except go down. Of course.
Ok Hank
I just bought in since I believe it's founds it's new bottom since it has been hovering around -20% mostly today.
I bought PLTR leaps this morning. I have no idea what it does and I had to look up the stock symbol to make sure it's actually PLTR before I wrote this post. Up 50% in 3 hours. I love this sub.
All aboard!!!!!!!

Whats PLTR gunna be EOW?!?!
CCL put holders I feel for you...it makes no sense to me as well why a fucking cruise company with cases getting near to 200k a day with lockdowns being imposed, and no stimulus in sight, and a current president who has not accepted that he is not president, is going up like 25% this week.
Ha ha, no idea

The more calls you buy the more shares market makers have to buy.

We can take this to 100 if all 1.6 million of us buy calls expiring friday
Fuck.. I think I’m holding til tomorrow
wtf.. why is pltr retarded today ?  this shit better hold the gains and do a NIO moon !!!
Glad you got it right! 
Keep going with that algo, and congrats for your gains
How do you know they partnered with IBM? What makes you think that big tech companies will want to use Himax over other AI companies that exist out there?

It ok, you will grow past this. The sum of a minimum wage summer job is peanuts compared to your future potential earnings.  Focus on gaining skills + education.  This will lead to higher and higher income.  That’s really where you can gain some freedom.

i'd exercise, get 100 shares
Is there any hope for the bears with BA puts or
Jealous of that's guy's grandma who dumped her savings into PLTR
I bought in when it first hit the market at 10, went straight down, only had 25 shares kept buying more, will continue to buy more every paycheck I think this is more of a long term hold
You shut your whore mouth
Can't say I disagree, but I thought I was one of those successful people playing it cautiously until I blew up. I'm just gonna sit out now and put the money back into boring old ETFs one day maybe when I can stomach it.
JPOW link?
Hold on to those solo calls. They gonna print

YES DADDY I WANT MOAR
Ok this might be stupid question but say you have a call dated a year out and 6 months before expiration a stock split happens. What’s that mean for the option holder and seller?
Last chance to recoup any Calls on NIO before they're worthless. This ship is crashing back into earth my dudes. You've been warned!

Market doesn't think we're locking down again, fuck New Mexico
If you sold otm at least you still made a profit either way, just not as big which is fine. I also left like 5% of my total acct balance on the table today, there will always be more plays to make

Did you watch the earnings call? I don't think you know what you're saying. Among many other things, they've reported that revenue was up a healthy amount, they just prioritized future growth investment as well as a slow payout to executives. Their balances are incredibly growth oriented
☠️
Jesus PLTR
Lost out on 2k by not using a better broker
Oh and not to mention big government contracts
God damn. Sold RIDE too too early. Bought for .45 and sold for .87. Currently at 1.28 :(
Citron says PLTR is too cheap. Buy more

Will PLTR dip? Waiting for an entrance, trying not to FOMO lol
So don’t close my 60 c 11/27?
sell pussy
Boom
I refuse to tell him to hold forever!!!!!
But they giveth for like an hour, the anal lasted quite a bit, though I don’t hate it
If this is the only holding in your portfolio I’d say sell 1-2 contracts and keep the capital for other opportunities.
Why isn't anyone talking about VALE??
Why wouldn’t you hold
Oh fuk is jpow speaking?
Anyone else loading some ICLN here? I'm thinking the Biden admin has got to announce some kind of green energy shit sometime within the next couple of months, if not sooner.
That's hype dude

PLTR rising too fast!
Fuck yeah
365!!!!
I'll probably sell half of my 11/20 20c at close today and then see what happens tomorrow.
+550% on my PLTR weekly calls. My biggest win ever. What do I do?? I’m thinking let her ride at least another day?
when you guys profit taking CRSR?

PLTR puts is the play from here. Using a day trade for these tendies about to come my way. 💲💰🤑
TSLA gaping my asshole RN but PLTR's holding my hand telling me it's okay, think happy thoughts
CCL put holders in shambles right now
You can still get in on PLTR. Just avoid short termed calls.
Yes. IV too high. Look at your break even pricing
PLTR closed my calls at +120%

Hell yes
Yeah palantir will probably be my first 10 bagger got 180 shares at 11.50 it’s pretty possible just gotta be patient
Count your blessings, look at the tendies you did get
Raise your hand if you’ve been personally victimized by Jack Ma 🙋🏼

I started my Robinhood and following wsb like 2 weeks ago..Literally my first option was a call to PLTR for 12/18. I love it here right now
To whoever I sold my PLTR calls to at 17.50 ... congrats and fuck you
Baba your peers are all going up what are you doing
Are we holding PLTR calls?
The key phrase is that you were prepared to fuck around with that money. If it was x10 (where it actually matters) then it may have been a different call. It's all relative.
It’s because you’re so far from expiration. Use an options profit calculator to see how spreads change over time. It goes up dramatically at/near the expiration.
Options giveth and options fuck you in the ass
Why has it been going down so hard for the past few years?
I can tell you these tech friends of yours have no life and work harder than you think. But all in all accountants fucking work a shit ton.

People laugh at WSB but then there's clearly some people here that are fucking geniuses at this shit like OP.  If you can spot and follow them you can def make some serious $$$$
If you are asking, then your vibe is shook. Sell.
Start over. Youre only 28. Dont spend the rest of your life being miserable in your career.

I as well hate accounting...

West coast struggles 😓
SPY +.25% EOD get your calls now
Well shit I bought a call ending in 11/20. You think they will announce before the market opens? 50c 11/20
Your expiration is Friday. Take your gainz today and wait for the correction. Buy in again with some time on the option. That's what I'd do with an expiration so close
Money doesn't sleep. That being said,  I'm probably moving to New York or Morocco where the market opens a lot later, right after I graduate next year
So last week, I was up from 4k to 16k from airlines leaps and cruises and shits.. and then I dump quite a bit on BABA and some other shit and back to 4k.. I dont like options
Don't wanna ruin it for the whole sub
bro you're doing just fine
You know what’s better than 47?.....48.

My entire account is up 70% today what is this. 🤙🏻🤙🏻

Yeah that’s what I shoulda done. But I waited and didn’t recognize the trend in front of me and now it’s too late to get out. That’s alright
PLTR 20 EOW easy money ezpz
I’m sorry you lost your money, but the most successful here don’t because of one reason: If you play it like a casino then you will lose money like a you’re at a casino. It’s about cutting through the bullshit in this forum and adding it to your other data to figure out what isn’t a gamble.

I have a bad feeling about McConnel's new Fed pick. I know she will advocate for 10% interest rates so the price of gold goes up relative to the dollar.

I'm up 100% on SPR calls thinking that they were Spirit Airlines....
What the fuck was that??
So I bought a February $9/10 PLTR spread a while ago. PLTR has since gone up like 95% and somehow I'm only up like 80%. My spread is actually in the red the past week... I understand it has to do with a wide bid-ask. Am I going to be continually fucked by this or will it adjust the closer I get to the expiration? I have made $0 today despite the stock being up 16%.
Seems stuck at 208 you think it’s worth rebuying in now or wait til eod?
Fucking Microsoft are you kidding me?
250% gain on 11/20 pltr calls - sell now or hold?

HIMX, growth stock. VR,AR,AI learning tech

Buy HIMX, next 10bagger.

Worthy currently 759m. Revenue hitting 309m????? I know wtf?? So cheap underpriced. AR /VR are just getting started. Cheap AI cameras, power efficient(big breakthrough). They make AI tech that collects info/ data from real world efficiently. VR and AR gaming component supplier, leading R&amp;D. Will be largest by 2021-2024 imo. Partnered with ibm (not disclosed). 


30%+ y/y in revenue only increasing.

Fuck weed stock, fuck electric car stock, AR VR time guys. Be ahead. Tsla will need their AI camera and R&amp;Ds too. These new technology will be needed by everyone even uber. A lot of applications. 


Buy now. Easy 10b company which is around 60$.
It makes all our pp’s hard
$20 EOD 😈😈
Cost basis?
You sound stupid hate to say. Learn to take profits, use stop losses, long dated options, and only play with money you can afford to lose. This will lower your stress. Also I feel bad for your wife

Help! Do I see my 01/15 21c PLTR call or no? Up 200% atm but it could be so much more - it’s only one contract so feels like I should hold to see where it goes
But they know what you do.......
ZM please give us one last pump for old times sake
Hey guys heard of PLTR 

Yeh neither have I
Were you not here a few weeks ago
Fucked myself over by getting an accounting degree. I hate this fucking career so much, but I’m already 28 and sunk so much time, money, and effort to getting where I’m at now and I’m not even at 100k salary yet, while my tech friends are making almost 200k with quarterly bonuses and work less hours.

WSB...lads...do I go back to school and start over?
Does anyone feel uneasy when they're holding shares long term and it moons wildly. Like expecting the balloon to pop and I'm left bagholding
Is it too late to get into PLTR? Kicking myself rn for not jumping in everyday the last month
Guh, why did I tie up so much in shares. Need more cash for PLTR calls
Damn idk if I would fuck with stocks if it opened at 630am local time for me.
I am never selling PLTR. Holding 10K shares.

I’m a poor college boy, I only have 2 calls on it so I’ll probably sell if I see it hit 19 or close because I’m a coward but I hope it takes you to the moon

I think the GME play is dead. Look at 2013 PS4 release - was a sell the news event. All the action happened in the runup to console release and then a bit of recovery over the next year.

GS now dropped Marcus's "high interest" down to 0.5% lolol. Imagine not just throwing your cash in some old boomer dividend stock instead.
ill honestly sell my calls at 20 and re enter on a dip, even if i dont get that dip ill be a happy camper
They make me a fuck ton of money
My 11/18 spy calls just nutted
Omg just ban
I think it’s unfair that BA is not $180 today.. like hellooo wtff????
When to short PLTR
Congrats on PLTR call holders, I would have bought some but had no cash and all my options were worthless so I had nothing to sell yesterday.
PLTR is the only thing saving me from the NIO hivemind. Might break even lol

No way. Will Ferrell's role in this is the funniest I've ever seen him and the fact that it's Ferrell in such a small role is one of the reasons why it's so funny.
have you seen this price action today? definitely not happening. they're pinning this at 360 until we can get some more news to break 362
Yea ur right lol, Up $76 so far tho

Get in Sir, this is a life changing event if you play it right.
PLTR past 18.60 is 18.75 then 😲19.50 as it stands.
You’re right. Gains are gains
Why did I think it was a good idea to sell covered calls on my PLtR

Nice, more leaps or short term stuff?

[removed]
I'm done. Posted this as a thread but it got removed.

I put in £9k back in April (savings that belong to both me and my wife, without telling her natch) and grew it to over £19k off of shares and CFDs. Then on Friday 23rd Oct I opened a huge Dow CFD position, gambling trying to scalp a few pennies in the minutes before close. Tried to close my position just before market close and my broker stopped trades 20 seconds earlier than I expected so I wasn't able to. Come Sunday afternoon the position was down £200 and rather than closing it then I sat and watched until it was down £2k. Then I doubled down and doubled down until my account was down £8k in the space of 5 days.

At that low point of a bankroll of £11k I told myself I would stop forever but I didn't obviously, I got back in and grew it back to £16k, then back down to £12k, up to £15k, and finally down to £14k. Completely degenerate.

What's crazy is that overall I've made £5k of extra cash in 6 months and it's done nothing but fuck me up. I'm just lucky I've reached this point of total exhaustion at a time when my account isn't completely blown up. Anyway see you next week.

p.s. This community is INSANE. I've always been a bit of a degenerate gambler, dipping in and out, and I've never been part of an online community where people win and lose money like they do here. You all put the sports betting and casino degenerates to shame. It's as if when you lose your life savings on options people see it differently to blowing it on the Cardinals over under, but guess what it really isn't. If anyone reads this I'll get called small pp and a big baby for losing only £8k in a week and crying about it, but on any other gambling forum they'd be sending social services to my door. I know that boredom during COVID times has driven me to this behaviour, if there's any of you out there in a similar position you can pm me if you want to chat. I'm sure life is rough for a lot of degens at the moment.

p.p.s. None of you have an edge, any retail retard over-leveraging himself will lose his shirt eventually.
Jesus, I've been on a rollercoaster RIDE over the last 2 months.
Remember, even red days are green

Palantir is a long term hold. Literally hoarding all of the worlds secret intelligence and data mining every part of the internet. It’s frightening, but I’m here to make money, so fuck it.

guys what's the news, what's the fucking news???????
[removed]
At 4 hrs you need to go.
BA, and PLTR no brakes today.
Print money...?
The climb in PLTR you see now is an institutional buying
Good. Ignore all the dumbasses on these subs, delete the apps, and when you’re looking to invest your money do it with professionals instead of feeding into a gambling addiction. A lot of people lost their life’s savings on this shit.
GREEN CANDLE 🚀
Shares is the way to go. I have shares too and not at all worried about them. My options don't expire until Jan but still. Underlying price is back to where I bought these options and I'm still down.
Man I see this echoed a lot on here but when I throw $35k at a stock around earnings and it could moon or plummet it still carries risk. I could lose $5k in 10 minutes if that shit goes the wrong direction. Then what? Panic sell? Hold while it drills more and wipes my gains for the month?
Got a lone 1/15/21 97.5c on the dip today. Feeling decent

NIO gains tomorrow shall be taking our autists to Valhalla
Then you are the loser on that trade and can’t exit the position. Every trade there is a buyer and a seller. In many cases, a market maker will buy or sell for their book and it’s not just an individual on the other side.
I am never ignoring the WSB hive mind again. 

PLTR to the moon 🚀

I did make a donation to them last week. preparing for my future residence there.
Through random serendipity I’m currently holidaying with some hedge fund managers, one managing $250m. They absolutely despise trump
Fuck you BA
I'm done buying Puts on Spy. I keep getting wrecked.
Fuck I sold my PLTR 15c 1/15 when the stock was +11% and used the profits to buy BABA and FLR. Might dump SPCE tomorrow and jump back on if there's a pullback
TSLA's price action is so manipulated jesus...
They make Palindromes probably
Right?  
I mean, I know it's overvalued as fuck, but jesus, the FOMO is real.
wanted to buy the stock but Solo cars look like shit
Can’t stop, won’t stop
when do I sell PLTR, ngl kinda worried its about to dump
Wow I did not expect to be green today lmao

Thanks fren.
Anyone can tell me what the news were that made oil companies shoot up 1-2hrs ago?

Green penis on spy
Td Ameritrade/thinkorswim
all day? it's just gonna keep going all day?
Yes the Air Force 1 maker will hit 215 tmw.
I love how PLTR moves. Not a pump and dump type of company. This is a very undervauled stock. Company is worth 22B. Slow mover but always on the rise. Definitely a long term hold. In at $14.
We follow money.
What the fuck is happening
It means at some point in time a couple months ago you made an incredibly dumb bet/comment that I took the time and effort to click next to your name and highlight "retard", it's ok i'd tag myself as a retard if i could too.
Pltr has given be an erection for over 3 hours.  I think I might have to get it drained in the ER
Hah spy put holders just got killed
[deleted]
Black 2 plz
Jan 22 SOLO leaps? or nah
Blackrock accidentally added a 0 to their SPY manipulation order
My 2 PLTR shares are RIPPIN. Total return: $6 🆒😎
[deleted]
PLTR keeping me in the game after BABA gaped me
The Bogs just called me. Old family friends. Anyways they said they're switching memes. NIO into PLTR. Do with that information as you please
Smile through the tears.
I would bet any of you tards I have the power to make PLTR go down the moment I fomo back into it.
if palantir keeps running andrew left is gonna release report on it soon lol
When is pltr making EVs?
I just got in too!
Love you 😍
Who knew a young Brendan Frasier was into Polka?
BABA got a nice 45° angle
No but I’m selling my Omega 
Google “Aqua Terra 2512.50” and PM me an offer ;)
That's racist.
Good question. Waiting for a dip
the fuck is that spy pump lmao
Green dildo alert. Where did that action come from lol
Positions or ban
This is way too relevant. “I’ll buy here. No it can go lower.” Then it goes up up 13% in the next 15 minutes.
Spy on you
What in the flying fuck just happened to my puts! Fucking bullshit green dildo out of nowhere
Sell bitch, so I can take your shares.
Here I sit broken hearted. My 10 Tsla calls only farted
What’s the news
Everybody hyping up PLTR not seeing $U (Unity) LMAO
Picks of the Moment:  
Go with the flow: PLTR  
Risky and frisky: TSLA  
One ring to rule them all: AMZ  
Gambling on Gambling: DKNG  
YOLO: CCL  
200 IQ: CRSR  
\-200 IQ: PLUG
Does PLTR go up because I hit F5? Definitely correlated...
Volume is amount of transactions today, daily average is the average amount of transactions in a day

there’s been a big increase in attention, more people are trying to get in and secure tendies
Not for long
Sell covered calls on FSKR. That's what I'm doing. Premiums are sky high.
Lol, up 40% on my SPY weeklies I bought 3 min ago.
Earnings whiff was 99.9% due to a debt related to their IPO stock listing, they were up like 50% from their last report
[deleted]
SPY with the midday coke bump I see
Am I out of my mind to want to buy as many NIO puts as possible before their earnings tomorrow?
MARKET JUST RECIEVED DOUBLE SCOOPS OF CREATINE FROM PLTR
Congrats & enjoy these tendies 🚀
NIO is a piece of shit blue chip
I've got 01/15/21 and 03/19/21 $20c. My only regret is not buying more
Does anyone actually know what PLTR does
When will Citron pull the plug on SPY.
All my PLTR calls from the day before ER finally printing lol
why didnt i click buy on the pltr 18c weeklies, if i did it at 10 am like i was going to my acc wouldve doubled
Profit is profit
PLTR 20 TODAY BOYS HOLD

Now
News about soros or something idk didn’t read the article just bought more

MEME STOCK
NNDM confirmed next PLTR:  imagine not having to send your PCB designs out to a fab house! Secrets kept secret. This is the NNDM way
[deleted]
PLTR 20c
Nio flat which means HUGE mooning for ER
So when do i finally buy PLTR?
Didn't CRSR and PLTR IPO same day/same week? It is destined they moon at the same time.
SPY with the hulk dong
Think that guy that YOLO'd 900k into CRSR should change his name to Michael Burry the 2nd
My heart hurts for you
I bought in 15 minutes ago and already got gains. Get in!
[deleted]
Spy 1min lmao
No. Get in now.
HOLY SPY
Because we've been telling you to buy for weeks!
not sure, I bought when they were .13 and its up almost 700%
Good job
wtf just happened
JD calls? Im thinking 92c 12/4
Then you're stuck with it until robinhood autosells it at whatever price they can an hour before market close on the expiration date
Huge green candle
Watch out for a guy named Andrew Left
Penny stocks
I got 100 at 9.54. Not much but I’m a low risk investor. Hbu?
Just did the same exact thing but $21
BA is just beckoning me to sell for a 30% profit fuggg
You: Apple calls

Me: Palantir calls
Meme euphoria
Wish I wasn't so broke and could've afforded more than 2 contracts of PLTR at open lol 🧠

Bought pltr, made a quick 100% and sold this morning. Could have been way more right now but I ain’t mad
No
[deleted]
All in on 11/20 455c’s
I bought my calls yesterday and sold them when it was at up 7%.. FML.
looks like it's time to buy TSLA calls
Up 220% on one & 98% on another. PLTR has saved my portfolio
shhh its about what they could be not what they are
i bought 1 call 11/27 16 at open. up 137$ but wish i bought more. i have a small account so some big purchases still scare me
$PLTR just cured my covid
[deleted]
Lol stonk
Nio bulls let it be known.

Nio is no longer meme worthy.
Do I smile at PLTR profits or cry over not buying more?
I am not a smart man, but I'm really liking HYLN right here.
i have the same
Yes, statistics are in fact supposed to be taken literally. I analyze stats all day which is how I make my money.

> Yes I do realize everything your saying but do you realize WHY?

The "why" you speak of doesn't matter because we have a few thousand years of data about humans and their economies. You can sit here and say "well people are lazy" or "people just don't know, let's educate them to make more money" but it doesn't matter. Even if you're right (you're mostly not because tier structured socio-economic groups play a large role here (regarding how much income is generated from day jobs), along with a massive amount of luck (regarding both stock picking and annual percentage gains)), it's not going to happen because we don't live in a perfect world. Never have and never will. Thus, statistics do matter. Congrats that you beat the average statistic **using the traditional "buy and hold long term" strategy**. But realize that you are in a **very very very** small minority. THAT was my point.
Should have kept my kohls lol, I just swooped up some 11/27 8.5c as well
Congrats and good luck. The only way to win is not to play.
No
Nice! I just got in yesterday when it was around $15.50
Im up 40% on PLTR in 5 mins
[deleted]
FDs lol
pltr Vol up to 64 mill.  up 7 million in about 6 minutes.   pltr is going for it.   This here is what you call following the trend.
I thought my 11/20 SQ calls were completely fucked, I think this shits got more to go
39 shares with an average price of 14$
Its a good company.
My man!
Ok I am a PLTR Bottom and I love it. We are a nice couple. But sold my calls to get into AstraZeneca. You know its next to pump! buy low, buy red, buy 30%IV cant go wrong!

PLTR will hit $20 today then I’m gonna grab puts
stocktwits ranked #?
Will aapl ever break out of this range
$20 today lets do it
From 2 to 4 bucks?
it may pull back to 16k but i dont think its going any further down. its relentless and the mainstream hype in the media has not even begun.
I swear I did it before reading this lol!
I’m going to puke looking at missed PLTR gains
How much have you made?
Is PLTR too late of a play?
This has been my pick since day 1. I trust the oxford crew over anyone else. Probably the only one I'd let jab me without question.
>LMFAO what strike/exp?   
>  
>

>This is so retarded
ah yes Thiel loves women
I know how to stop this PLTR train!

*buys call*
Pump it 🐢
I just opened up my account...I came
Do you have a sell target or just going to hold no matter what? I already pulled out my initial investment plus some profits. Just letting the remaining profits ride. Would be great to see 100k but even if it drops back to 6k, I wouldn't care too much.
These PLTR 20C wsb boys are about to brrrr money soon.
[deleted]
Y’all think that plane company hits 215 tomorrow? (Purposely leaving out ticker .... don’t type it)
How much harder is TSLA gonna run the rest of the week? The rug pull from the HOD isn't sitting pretty. Asking for my 430c weeklies.
Anyone else watching HYLN for a move back to ATH over the next few months?
is there an explanation for why PLTR is ripping
Leverage gives me PTSD from March.
CRSR 32 bro this hoe going to 40
Yuuuup
Every morning they short it. 1h 30 min later they stop low volume and the stock starts pumping.
PFE sure massacred my calls with that spin off.  Motherfuckers.  :(
PLTR is a funny one though.  Balance sheet is atrocious.  Like a metric fuck ton of debt.  They also whiffed earnings by an unfathomable amount.  Yet here we are getting tons of hype, and seeing a massive rally lmao.  Good times
My experience is don't sell early on these meme stocks
I did my first FOMO trade today. And I LOVE IT. PLTR 20c 11/27
I haven't seen anyone mention it and it seem like you might not know...FYI, you can buy to close some or all of your sold calls anytime between selling them and Friday afternoon.  The cost to buy them back might be higher or lower than the premium you received for selling.
sold my PLTR 17c this morning for like $20 profit lmao
I forget options are a thing sometimes.

Yes, I know I don't belong here
if you hold till 40,000% gains you'll retire tho
PLTR cured my gout.
Better go buy another fridge to store all the tendies you're about make
I am up 50% in PLTR shares. Why did I only buy 8k FML
Same here. Just because I bought PLTR makes me feel like Im a pro at timing the market. Gotta try real hard to stay grounded.
Fuck off
close out my pltr 11/27 $19 calls (up 300%) or let them run..
PLTR will have positive net revenue for the first time in their 17 year history in Q4, it will not be below $25 ever again
The only Technologies me and my homies use are PLTR 🔮🔮🔮🔮
Looked at RIOT when it was up 10% and almost bought calls but then thought "no way it keeps running today" 🤡
[removed]
God, RIOT is making me so horny right now!
love that this sub hyped up PLTR
15c checking in currently up 867%. 💎🙌
You lose everything... you're still only out $200.
I should sell these PLTR calls, but I can’t lol.
Thé Citron tard is gonna release a report on PLTR réal soon and when that stock tanks and none of you fucks load up on shares, you will be the real retard and not lemon head.
363
Its not !!
This thing has huge potential especially with these pharmaceutical companies talking about vaccines. This has the potential to make people rich.
Typed in xanax on the Amazon app and I already see it poping up.
Government Logic: You can go die for your country, even if you're not an adult.
Also Government: Now hold up, you're going to use money you earned to gamble, and you're not even an adult? Now that's just wrong!
just sold pltr, might buy back in later, but it’s rising wayyy too fast right now
new highs again PLTR has no brakes
If 5.3k makes you feel invincible, the real world is going to hurt 🤣.
You just salty you don’t have CCL calls
always were
170 shares @ 14.40 let's fucking go
[deleted]
Exactly. I actually bought two more on the dip so I netted $400. Feels good
I might actually go positive with my shitty BABA and TSLA calls because of PLTR
One day it will even buy PLTR calls for you when it knows you’re struggling.
not gonna get any cheaper
lol, time to sell
I kinda want to do this, but worried the premiums will start going through the roof
Real talk it looked perfect on my dope-ass monitor, then realized it looks like shit on phones after uploading.

Oh well.

GE and SOLO are free money
How long out. That’s stupid tho. Unless it’s far out.
You know something wild is happening when NIO isn’t being spammed lmao
Definitely odd seeing CNK be one of the only green stocks on my screen today
I knew pltr 20calls would print.  I didn’t get them tho
We don’t
Deposit some more money and get back in you retard the party is just getting started

CRSR is killing it every day
18.5 baby
CRSR calls printed and I took profits. Gonna hop back in maybe EOD
How dare you abandon Elon, after everything he’s done for us
Yes. That is why I keep buying SPY puts and selling next day at a loss.  I’ll catch the inevitable pull back eventually.  Lol
PLTR and CRSR are the chosen ones
Glad everyone is making tendies with PRLP
what the fuck does that even mean you 🤡
let me remind anyone posting here about shares... wrong sub
Peter Thiel will fuck your mom and gf if you don’t buy calls
Lul
maybe. you'd have to count on covid day drinking continuing and increasing indefinitely
Naming my first born Palantir
With 40k it only seems like the most credit I can get for weekly 5% OTM put credit spreads on most things is like 2-3k playing around with the profit calc. There's gotta be a better risk/reward ratio here.
Oh not complaining at all, had a cost basis of $9.81.
Jesus PLTR I can only get so hard
I can say I'm in it for the long run. I'll be writing deep otm covered calls along the way, but I'll be trying to buy back in if they ever get exercised.
Ill settle for 19 at this point, it doesn’t know which way to go of the .50 mark :(

Does buying MSFT leaps today a good strat?
So do I brethren, so do I 😔
There is usually multi day rallies
KNDI !!!!
I’m bouta YOLO into PLTR

$CRSR +10% by EOD?
Whenever you want to start regretting your decision.
If it doesn't have a correction by the end of the day, sell.
[deleted]
CRSR is killing it today.
Do we hold
Are we the baddies?
So you lost money on one FOMO and decided to jump into another. Lol
This sub poopoo'd all over PLTR at IPO for this exact reason. Fine by me, I bought in at $9.50.
Same, but i have you tagged as a retard so now I feel like less of one.
I hearby swear never to trade TSLA options again.
Im taking profits tomorrow morning regardless of what happens. Buying back in next dip.
That would give it a market cap of 300bn+ bro lol
[deleted]
I'm up nearly $20k on shares that I bought 7 days ago and honestly have no idea what to do about it.
Is 361 new resistance now
PLTR initiate the infinite gamma squeeze
Yes
PLTR baby! I’m up 5% on the day
I'd have done the same. How are you supposed to know how high it can go.
I should’ve put more in, even buying now doesn’t sound like a stupid idea for the long run
nah u guys are literally never wrong, nio, pltr, im getting in and dumping my portfolio in contracts
ill sell you some 11/27s 👌
That's The way
I got 400P 11/20 waiting for it to hit 430
PLTR too high, too fast. Slow your roll.
didn't know god was so poor
I'm diamond handing my 16cs, this is when they start really printing
Looks like TSLA is just about bottomed out. I’d sell your puts soonish.
I think they have a good balance of defense and civilian aerospace. It seems that spending on both will go up once COVID is under control.
I wanna fuk pltr
Don’t say that. (I have calls)
never
Search for ticker symbol MOON
Sold this morning for a fucking 100$ gain paper handssssss

So PLTR $30 by February is definitely printing?
Retard
I'm going to baghold until sports betting, see what happens. There's also potential for buyouts...
[removed]
not enough money
SPY EOD predictions?
Is there any reason to trade between 10 and 3?  shit only happens during opening and close. its boring as fuck.
a fucking google search, you retard
so euro chicks would think you're hung
Does this multi day rally make anyone else nervous? Like we’re about to see a 5+% correction?
Ok guys I bought PLTR calls, get out.
Don’t want to waste a day trade
Hold the Line! FOllow the PLTR
Well done, this may end up pulling a TSLA in 3-5 years
Forced myself to get calls today when PLTR was already up 7%.. who says being a retard doesn’t pay off?
Today I wanted to buy at 16 but I’m a cuck and didn’t buy WaItInG fOr tHe DiP
How fake and gay can the market get: 2020 edition

Can I get the old one?
I wish this wasn't a real possibility. I'm holding, but still.
What's the PLTR move? Diamond hand these Feb $16c or take profits?....
No shot it drops to 13 lmfao. I could maybe see 16 but the amount of support it already has, with the low float, this bad boy isnt dropping that radically any time soon.
I’m too retarded to buy calls. So I’m sticking to shares
Ar.... are... are we the market manipulators? 🥺
I’m you and you’re me
Check out the unusual options report and open your trading app for open interest bro
Yep, you do. We wear bike helmets to go to the bathroom...don’t listen to us
You don't go broke selling for profit 👍👍
Congrats
Just sold my $sq calls for 60% gainzzz I’ll take that for the day and call it
PLTR, TSLA and OSTK literally made my account value double today
Great DD
It’s cheap as hell now and they still own the majority of their PLTR shares. Fat dividend coming by EOY according to management
take it. have a gut feeling they gone come out with a public stock offering then it will tank
When do I pussy out on PLTR? ✋📜🤚
Y’all sleeping on TUP
Look at you nerds and your preciouses.
Bought 372c 11/20

Yeah usually when the memes pop up, the stock is close to selling off, so I'll wait for a nice dip to enter on and long it. I did that with NIO but I ended up getting stopped out after last quarter's earnings report.
Luckily I’m all in.
im holding mine overnight
what monthlies did u paper hand and then a few days later the stonk mooned?
Repost
Haha me too
Most insurance is accepted, Amazon said. But Prime members who don't have insurance can also buy generic or brand name drugs from Amazon for a discount, which the company said will be up to  80% off for generic medications and up to 40% off brand-name medications.


Will they have those $1 generic deals that $COST and sam's have for their members? That would take some foot traffic away or memberships.
Alright TSLA, do a PLTR for me
earnings was good imo
RIDE 12/4 30c just bought me a new Rolex

First ones free
SPY putholders, put down those bags and join us on PLTR 🚀
Uhm no it’ll keep going up ⬆️
Man if it’s Tesla shares you should be fine by December at worst. 

If you bought FDs at the top then well...
Yeah, I'm looking for it to shit the bed EOD.
Have no clue what PLTR is but it seems to be recommended by WSB so I bought 5 contracts. Although it looks like it’s at AH, obviously it’s just not done growing. Can’t possibly go tits up like my Tesla calls this morning
Haha ... Shit
Sold all my PLTR at $17.06 the day before earnings. Smiled as it dropped to $14. Then this shit happens. In all reality though, definitely see it dropping back to the $13-14 range, and I'll probably buy back in.
HYLN breaking out rn
Institutions are loading the fuck up on PLTR. Ownership went from around 1% to 15% in the last week

Bought random 11/20 and 11/27 PLTR OTM calls at open and they're all printing 🤩
PLTR you dirty dog 🐶
If the calls you sell, expire worthless (NIO stays under $75 on exp, and you just wait till midnight), you keep the credit and your shares.

The underlying would have to rise above the premium, for the buyer to even consider executing the calls.

This is a "risk-free" trade, and you should've done it already.

That option is liquid.

You're also not getting $1400 now, the premium is killed, and you'll have to sell below the bid to get a fill.

Whatever fill you get, just let them expire (also sell the $60 11/20).

Theres time...
how much profit you have?
FOR REALS, I’m UP 20$
Long dated or short dated?
SSSS owns 4.6 million shares of PLTR
DKNG 50 EOW 🦍📈
Whelp sold my PLTR calls too early
Try mine for may lmfaooo
PSTH Getting pinned at 23.88-23.89, wonder if something is coming
When pulled rug
The next AMAZON, $1000 by 2025 don't @ me
Let’s go to 30 why not
**One ring to rule them all**
Sell at 20 ?
Is TSLA 430 too much to ask for?
Wow $sq on a fukken rip today bud
inb4 dump eod
It's still down on the day.......   so.... buy it?
[deleted]
i hate it... sold PLTR yesterday and said f it... it's TSLA time today... 

inverse.... always inverse. why didnt i inverse myself.
Dam Sun
PLTR gonna make me throw up, my hands weren't strong enough to hold to 18
At 57%??? Pussy
fk it PLTR 11/20 $20
Someone shoot me for not pulling the trigger on 2k shares at 17.40 on PLTR. Too busy fucking around with NIO.
Fuck that its squeezing to 20 man the volume is absurd
of course it is. to many shares and not enough money
LOL
PLTR literally has no reason not to continue up.
We will see a dip on thursday. Then big up monday
Yep
Never go 🌈 🐻 on a meme stock
I don't mind minor pull backs I'm in it for the long haul. I've got more in that than I do in stonks.
No we going straight to the moon bye bye
Buy the dip
Samesies
I see PLTR is releasing a vaccine and an electric car this year.  Bullish.
 PLTR 🚀 permission to come aboard
holy shit
Palantir good god what a monster
Hell naw you saw what happened to WMT
spce has retard strength at 21.44 who would have thought
I think I just blew a load shaped like PLTR in my pants.
18.5 wall you aint shit
Take the small tendies and get out of it before the loss and greed take over! 🙏
I'm up 320% this week. Started the week at -99%, now at -83% 😎
Same but it could have gone the other way too.  Next time sell half and let the rest ride.
Idiot me buys FDs when a PLTR is already at ATH and +9.5%..

1hr later, PLTR at +16% and FDs at +66%

Gotta love meme stonks
PLTR is gonna hit a 1000 the real way not the tsla way...and probably faster
Because it’s crazily overvalued
I’m surprised how cheap they are, any reason why they’re not more?
is it even worth taking a position in at this point? I've been on the "eh I'll wait until it pulls back to 15" for awhile now lmao

Been eyeballing ETH
Come on AMZN you just disrupted an entire industry and asserted your world dominance can we get some fucking green candles
Sure glad I sold my ba puts on morning dip and went all in on pltr.
You can actually enlist into the Army at 17.
Make is ALLLL back in one bet - this is crazy..
Solid
Thoughts on corsair gaming hold for long term hold?
RH earnings doesn’t match actual earnings. GTS
Mara not up nearly that much
PLTR gonna bust
Been waiting for my 155 calls to come back up
Corsair is on the run!  Finally!
what are you guys expecting for nvda earnings?
PLTR IS A FUKN MEME
That you did
LOL
PLTR bruhhh this is illegal.
SVXY calls
I got it from here and usually just Google institutional investors plus whatever stock to see news stories

https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=PLTR&subView=institutional
I’m not saying the stock won’t go up. Cause people will buy anything if it’s related to EV.

But what a shit company. I say this as an engineer that was offered a stupidly high paying job there (I didn’t take it) They went bankrupt and came back years later to offer, like, the exact same car that helped bankrupt them. It’s more expensive than a Tesla with a fraction of the range. It’s heavier than a full size truck. The interview was the most unprofessional experience of my life. 

I know they’re working on a new model but I just don’t think they have the engineering power. They certainly are not grabbing the attention of brighter engineers like Tesla, rivian, etc
When should I sell my PLTR calls?
Yeah but Soros is smart and bought at 9$, not 17$
BuT PLTR dIdN'T mAke A pRoFIT fOR 17 YEars. GUHH
NIO has been paying off for months. I think I bought it for $6 this spring.
90 day ban is quite the downside
Buy the dip !!! Don’t ask questions
I’m not complaining and very happy right now, but what the hell is going on? Short covering?
Seems like the TikTok move was largely unwarranted, no?
Lmao alright I thought that was pretty funny
PLTR I think this might be love.
Short Tesla here it’s obvious
hell YEAH! CAnt  even keep up with the price alerts in IBKR!<
im waiting for a dip not going in after up 25% lol
[deleted]
PLTR 19 EOD LETS HOLD BOYS
PLTR is literally Skynet, they already have access to all your data from the US gov't and you don't realize it.
Probably just sell and rebuy
lol literally exactly what they used to say about tsla
Because its healthy
I’m up almost 100% today and my PLTR calls don’t even expire for another month
Dude go away you're ruining this experience for me
[deleted]
this is the way.
Anything you can afford at least 2 months out
Lol GAN tanks every earnings
Theta ain’t pretty but earnings are your time to shine.
WHY DID I SELL MY 11/20C PLTR CALLS AT THE LITERAL DIP THIS MORNING
bahaha
It’ll be an honour to stand alongside my fellow knights of PLTR when this shits 30+ lmao
Strap in boys, we about to blast off!!!!
Pltr - RU18.5, yet
Just woke up I’m Holding PLTR calls and believe me I’m hard af, but not sure why it shot up werent earnings bad? Was forward guidance amazing or something ?
holy fuck PLTR I got tired of watching the meme stocks moon so I bought $500 in shares just to get some of it for low risk and now it's already up $50 wtf
Literally this. Every. Goddamn. Dip. Snapped. Up.
# CRSR Stronk
lol in denial much?
Bruh
was late getting into PLTR but the bid is strong my friends...
OKE
Maybe but don't want to risk it since these are options. Waiting to get rid off the extra baggage at break even.
I missed the TSLA spike once... Now I fear every time it is close to top if I sell I'll miss out again... This fucking PTSD is causing me to trade like a fifth wit...
[deleted]
Why else would I be here
first you fuckers get paid by tesla, now PLTR poppin off. I'm really proud of you guys.I hope NIO gang gets paid too. Let's gooo.(I wasn't in any of those tho :()
all hail our new mod, u/SolitaryEgg
Bought in at 10, and 15, should I buy in now at 18??
REKT
I did, I bought leaps - now not looking at the app till Friday when my first set of covered calls expire.
CBAT, saw some random ass post in here, I don’t even know what they are
Lmao
Why’d you hurt me dad?
No problem
Down 19% from the month peak
PLTR doing what you guys expected Tesla to do instead lmao
Healy, CEO of HYLN, doesn't know how to spread news like Milton or Musk. His doesn't reveal much of what his doing. Without news, there's little catalyst to shake the price.
never
BitKorn!!!!!!!!!!!
The premium was trash on em??
It already ran up into the earnings a shit ton
What does that mean?
Dude, this happened to me.  I had 10 jinko solar shares, and they turned into SOLAREDGE shares randomly.  contacted robinhood and all they could do is give me the jinko shares back in buying power. random af
Lol bro PLTR is gonna meme for weeks
Fuuuuck I was gonna hop on AZN today but hesitated
I'm up 50k this year, with no margin...

Maybe you're just an idiot and needs to learn what "Trend" is and stop doing crayon technicals.
Just yolo DDD because it has that extra D for you.
# I FUCKING TOLD YOU TO BUY THAT DIP LMFAOOOO!!!
AAPL will always outperform. Berkshire just needs money.
I know...was in early
Yes take profit
Where are the green dildos ffs?
she sent outta tweet asking if she should buy it
It's diagonal to the negative....
Just bought a pltr weekly, the rally is over
Anyone playing $TGT
Congrats! Good to hear that, nice job on the gains :D
I wanted to sell covered calls of PLTR at 18 but accidentally bought them. Best. Mistake. Ever.
Send to me for tribute
Great work!
a little water break, before we go again.
Trying to decided it should buy POOTS
ievan
Wow might hit $20 today at this rate then switch to put
Lmao worddd
sell enough to get back your investment, let the rest ride
Bought PLTR at 16, thought about buying more at 17, sold instead. This is why I'm poor.
lol cuz they're retarded. i make 2x money from $210 call weeklies all the time, even if the spreads are ass.

currently waiting on an IV spike have about 20 1/15/2021 $260 Calls for .4 each. hoping to sell for .75-1.00
Are you holding Pfizer bc VTRS was from a split
Whoever didn’t buy PLTR because they “haven’t turned a profit in 17 years“ can get fucked
no sir keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times
I think pretty much all CDNs will grow but maybe not at the rate FSLY or NET has achieved. I can’t really trust FSLY too much after the crater from TikTok but I still have a number of shares and options. AKAM is definitely one of the top tier CDNs but it’s just so outrageously expensive and eventually any customer that’s paying them that kind of money will eventually build their own just like Facebook did. NET is in a unique position where it offers many of their products for free for data and analytics and enterprise customers pay reasonable fees while they keep shitting out new products no one has ever thought of.
Mwahahaha, Retard bets work.
Not sure. I think with the China gov. on Babas ass I could see it bleed for a while. I look at Facebook in 2018 as an example it took almost year for it to go back to where it was before Zuck went to Congress. But it could be different idk this market is crazy
Love me some TATA!
Welp I’m bag holding 8 calls that expire this week. Just hoping for a small run up to sell. I have 17.5c and 20c
Nope she is officially on her way to 30
Gonna go get a filet mignon and lob tail for lunch. When I get back I expect to see spy 365
I listened to you retards and bought PLTR. Thank you!
I only have one day trade til I’m labeled, what’s the downside?
Holy shit the volume is insane on PLTR what an insane day.
Evidence?
So you missed out on PLTR, what’s the next big stock you ask?  
Well daddy is here to tell you about NNDM: 3D-printed circuit boards.  
You thought metal 3D printers were innovative?  Imagine a printer that can print conductive and insulating materials in conjunction to make circuits.  
Get in while it’s cheap boys!
Do it trust me. No DD needed I did it for u.

# buy that fucking dip. EVERY DIP TODAY HAS BEEN BOUGHT. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.
Space X ipo as PLTR? 🌕
Same story as SPCE and NIO around here, also pretty sure the float the fairly small so when tons of people start buying OTM options, delta hedging forces it higher.
You bet I do
What makes u say that? I actually like the way it’s progressing rn. It’s healthy
Ban
RIOT and MARA are going to run like the wind as soon as the Coin That Shall Not Be Named eclipses its ATH here soon.
Same! Have a little in XPeng also..
Fuck that boomer stock. They killed earnings last time and dropped bigly
Same here, I bought in at 17.11 basically at the top this morning.
This stock actually has potential to 10x - whats it doing in this sub! Lol
Red pill gang RISE UP
It’s about a 1/4 of my portfolio lmao I’m in college
In since day one., I’m a day one brotha.
PLTR is new wave 🌊
Yes indeed
up almost 200% on pltr do I sell lol
It’s like an ig story that twitter just rolled out today. And I was being hella sarcastic above.
1/15 $70c 🌶
I wouldn’t be on this sub If I wasn’t here for the risky gains ;)
whoever the guy is that said “slow down pltr im trying to buy more” thanks, i just bought more
Currently balls deep into $18
Literally anytime i try and get out of F options
Out door heaters take propane, retard
Dawg, billionaires are buying lots of shares. Hold this shit until at least next summer
Motherfucker

If you have to ask...
Yes

I’m sorry bro FOMO

I feel like NIO price action is setting up for a smaller than expected move/consolidation below $50
I keep telling you guys to buy $CRSR
[deleted]
Welp I'm sad for taking 100 % profit on pltr calls this morning
So much manipulation on it, I’m waiting to get back in till I see more progress
Going to ride PLTR and CRSR from $100 to retirement
50:50
Major cuckage by TSLA today 😔
If I hit 1000% I’m out on any play and On to next wsb pick of the week
It’s time for the daily HYLN pump
11
He did yesterday!
jump on the MARA AND RIOT TRAIN, before it leave
I bought in when it was at 17.9 but I bought $18c good luck
Did any get some random shares on RH today? The shares came outta nowhere
Oh my God someone needs to stop palantir
235c 11/27 popped up on unusual whales earlier, was thinking about chasing but didn't because it seemed like FOMO

That was at 199 though
I want the names of every single WSB user shittalking PLTR after the IPO
This is just fuck around money haha
Waiting and buying the dip is always better than being a 🌈🐻
Hey guys just woke up, did PLTR break $16 yet?
Send PLTR to the moon
Fleets?
Tsla bears go ahead and close those puts. You’ve been warned.
BULLS ON PARADE... AAAAAND THEYY AREEEE 

&#x200B;

off...
Ill consider getting in to BABA when it dumps more to 250, cuz my FOMOd PLTR is already up 75%
[deleted]
PLTR 19 EOD???
Blessing in disguise. Hold that BABA
If he would have gotten away with it he would have been a legend.
PLTR just smoked the $18 wall
About to do a cum tribute vid for PLTR
You make it sound as if everyone goes to college. He’s also Canadian and Canadian universities are much cheaper I’m talking 30k to 50k for a full bachelors degree. Just because you have an inability to save money doesn’t mean everyone else does I’m sure if you budgeted everything in your monthly spending you’d see a lot of red flags. Otherwise you wouldn’t be saying this.

You’ve masterfully designed this for the sole intention of making it painful to read. Good job.

# OMFG ITS GOING PARABOLIC
fook me at this point the PLTR 19c covered calls I sold are going to get assigned
The fact the nio isnt having a crazy run today is actually good.
CEO was on CNBC yesterday.  Guess he did a good sales job?
profit taking done on TSLA. who isn't buying tesla at this level?  time for the second launch into outerspace
Ya I have scaled back a lot now and don’t actively trade everyday.
This is the way
OMFG PLTR
Right me too fuck it someone make some YouTube videos and tic toks on it lol
CRSR thank you baby
When you need a semi-coherent 3am tweet barrage, who will you call ❓
Can u explain
Good luck with that gamble
PLTR no brakes MF
You bankrupt now?
sitting up 57% on PLTR 1/2022 LEAP in one day. My long term hold plan is being tested
holy crap, didnt know that. I can maybe see why CVS price was what it was, there was definite uncertainty. still is, but i agree with the $70 price cuz americans will go to the CVS 3 minutes away. u go to amazon to buy masturbators or a bidet.
Put in a stop loss order and let it ride. Guarantees profits and lets you have potential for more profit.
If you aren’t shorting Gulfport technology right now you ain’t black
average down
No one trades DG
Nah only up from here imo, can jump to 20 in a matter of hours
Boring
Lol come on HD

Sorry just had to check back in after 4 days. It’s still printing
all buyers coming in for PLTR. What do we open at tomorrow?
Damn it feels real bad
>Do I take my 145% gains on PLTR calls exp 12/4 or do I diamond hands it

Take half atleast
stop asking what strikes to buy for PLTR just buy shares and check back in 2025 nerds
I sure hope so. GOD bless and good luck yall
I got in on 2/19 20c at 2.50... these bitches at 3.85 rn.
Who’s the dude?
23c 1/15/21 here let’s HOLD
lol bro sell and get out of there
It honestly might lol
When you saw people saying to buy in at PLTR and the number 18 a few times and buy in at .90c
Down 45% on Jan 275 BABA calls. Average down or not worth dumping more money?
Dude. Take the gains.
[deleted]
PLTR calls just doubled in like ten minutes
Market pump faked bears so bad this morning with the red open and drilling at open
Hopefully Joe Biden says something about Evs, I need plug to gap up
holy shit pltr. hit tsla and pltr today.
OK this is wild.  DON"T STOP!!!!!!
sell some for profit if u want but pltr will moon like nio next
Good job but this ain’t post worthy.. 9% increase in shares and 4k gain is nada
20 1/15
[deleted]
BABA is shit.. Jack Ma too
 Bears in general down 10% today
Kandi to 10?
PLTR is the perfect WSB stock too. 

low underlying price. IV "reasonable" at under 200% (now that ER Is done with). well above analysts price target. constantly makes big intraday move now that its broken out of channel.

the important thing is cuz its a $18 stock WSB can buy OTM as fuck shit like $25c and it may hit.
We should put astronauts in PLTR cause it's going to the fucking moon
Technically it is tech... But it is finance. FIN tech... I believe they call it... Can only go up. 200 by tomorrow
wtf corsair. any news ? why is it pumping?
I have 48% p right now, I’m going to let it run to 435
Bruh was waiting for PLTR drop, it’s not coming, thought I was buying high it’s only going up bby
Gazprom, really undervalued, price to earning ratio of 4, buuuuuut...
25k. All stock
One of it
Do you think buying into BA would be fomoing? It literally went up from 180 to 205 in no time. Due for a pullback soon?
Im a superior european
Depends, are you a lil bitch or are you a studly stud
I also just sold at $4.50 and now at $5.10

Oh well. Hindsight is 2020 be happy with the gains
CCL😭
When WSB goes fomo on a stock buy straddles. It might go up, or down sharply but it certainly won't stay flat.
Can someone make MSFT positive please?
[deleted]
20 by next Friday at least
It’s up 250% now lol
Not if you've got a 20, thats the only time I insure
Apparently my GMAT was scheduled for 12 midnight last night not 12 noon today so I guess my masters in finance at Pitt is off the table for another semester.  WHO THE FUCK HAS EXAM SLOTS FOR MIDNIGHT ARE YOU SERIOUS FAAACCKKK
i gotta stop listening to you guys, -$1300 following plays from autists today
Today is probably done, probably just gonna be flat all day from here. Hopefully this week has some good news
At least PLTR is covering my TSLA losses from this morning lmao.
I mean true, but also for people working on being better to the environment
BABA come back

You can put it all on me
PLTR baby dont stop now
Who you talking to? Everyone here is on it
RIDE
Palantir in orbit
All time P/L SS please.
PLTR $20 eod?
I could see PLTR go to 30. It stupid but... why not
I'm early, but I'm not wrong
You are my shining star
[deleted]
Ran out of settled funds. Hope spy goes up tomorrow so I can buy puts
yea, and if it breaks out we get more. i like these low risk 2 baggers for sure.
Jesus PLTR, save some pussy for the rest of us
Thought I sold off my BABA position earlier and rebought lower. Turns out, I accidentally placed a buy order instead of a sell order and now have 4 times more BABA than I wanted.
Honestly I was a trumpster but if sleepy joe is gonna pump up my gains I’m gonna hit the redo button on my vote lmao
GOD bless and good luck
No. Where do you think all the money is going that is being pulled out of ZM, PTON etc? Hint, it’s cruise, airlines, & entertainment stocks.
Touché
Tsla next stop 420.69.

Soros and Ark take us to 20!!!
True, greed kills
Tendies, down aisle 6 to the left
I bought 2 calls, up over $100. All I was willing to risk!
Life is full of disappointments. Alibaba is one of it.
Absolutely.  Even a 30% reduction in Rt drastically slows spread.

That’s the most annoying thing about this virus- it’s very easy to control if people just stop doing a select few very stupid things.

Bought at open for 22.11. The reason it dropped was they offered up more shares and promptly sold 5.7 mil of them to MS. It’s going right back up promptly imo.
Literally cant go tits up
Its gonna meme HARD
Can you educate me on volume vs daily average plz? 

From one PLTR to another
Guh out of settle cash I wanna buy puts for boomer badly
ELI5?
Why do I feel like PLTR is basically the Umbrella Organization?
\> HE SOLD PLTR AT 18   


HAHAHHAHAHAHAAH
I hear you
You have served us well
PLTR testing my refractory period
I had 20 15.50 PLTR calls I sold yesterday for minimal profit fuck me
I haven’t had a play work out like PLTR. Thanks WSB
Do I take my 145% gains on PLTR calls exp 12/4 or do I diamond hands it
realistic pltr calls what should i go for?
HYLN is big kill
Up 191% now
Get in before its to late. I can't see any reason why this won't go over 20.00 by eow maybe even eod
Literally just bought more calls. We’ll see
Bullishness is on CDN broadly? Most of the commentary I’ve read is pretty vanilla on CDN due to AMZN pricing pressure. FSLY bullishness surrounds edge compute capabilities and stickiness due to dev-friendly practices. NET is due to long tail customer exposure. Seems like AKAM is screwed LT though. Thoughts?
Positions?
Michael Burry's CVS position is dead? Or do we trust in King Burry?
Thank you pltr gang for getting retards like me  to buy in
Build a bear is down ten percent today. :(

This is the best answer. There’s volume at that strike, if you price at the bid they will get bought.

DOLLAR GENERAL **(DG)** EARNINGS ARE COMING UP EARLY DECEMBER

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED, possibly melt up into earnings=free money**
You think shitcoin will pullback? I want to buy the dip
Man every time I buy a small amount of calls (<=$1k) for any company they always seem to to be 3 baggers, everytime I throw like 5k in it becomes a -98%
I was just going to ask
[deleted]
PLTR okay okay
Yes but also get the fuck in loser
[link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloombergquint.com/amp/opinion/will-the-stock-bubble-burst-as-soon-as-tesla-joins-the-s-p-500)
Sell now. Not huge gains but you should have at least 20%. On a yolo that’s pretty good
sold my blink calls yesterday for a loss, coulda had a 4 bagger today, oh well
Twitter done changed the game with fleets. Brand new, never seen before feature. Game changer in social media.

Thanks to whichever retard bought my Tesla call at $450 and immediately lost a grand
I think you can still make money man

PLTR is memeing, this shit is only just starting lol
PLTR you did it you son of a bitch
Enlighten me on how the pronunciation is any different.
With that there's an x factor. A few years back JPM, amazon and a few companies started a health insurer. I think it's a dry operation right now but that could be the vehicle that propels them into that game.

Yeah, it’ll make you financially independent from your bank account.
Damn good day to buy. Up 180% over the last few months
Where is that guy with 20c for 20/11 on PLTR that I told to dream on before open today?
Sell and wait for 50% discount
Can trump already leave so Biden can pump for us? Cant take anymore of his antics
Arya stark?
Say no more. Im in 5/21/21 30c 🚀
short TSLA or PLTR
Lol you need to go YOLO now you've found winning formula 😉
I’m getting nervous we are about to get fucked because it’s been way too easy recently
Pltr 20 eod or eow...?
aight
DKNG mooning
shut your face
Buy spy 400c eow
Long term? I'll thinking 10-bagger in five years on shares
Already own shares 🤑
I have a feeling repeat of history will happen lol. But maybe not. SQ and Paypal support it.
Sucks man. I’ve been twice such a blast, traveled a along way to NOLA for it (from northern Canada)
[deleted]
insurance on a dealers ace is such a sucker bet lol
Not much of a wall
100% hold these.
I'm holding, stay strong Niophytes!
PLTR
link?
Get this out of here.  Idk what happened to the mods, it's like they just have up.  While I do like that we can post about anything, shit like this really pissed me off bc people don't read the rules.  No less than 2500$ should be posted.
I was looking at them since ipo. Solid company and great industry to be in. Amazon for the short term is shitty but people are silly to think Amazon going to eat up all the market share. Also theyll work to add Amazon in their vendor list. Thats all. They get a piece of the pie from Amazon transactions too
Yeah I actually threw $200 at a $50c because although I may be retarded I actually like tendies
PLTR lmao WSB does it again. Many tendies
PLTR all gas no brakes!!!
you need 100 racks to move out wtf?
The blind leading the blind. I love you guys.
RIDE fucking mooning again today.
Yeah.
Solo is going up
2 mins ago: 18.00
Now: 18.15

I wonder how this is going?
I am also getting in on the 22s. Experience has taught me months out ATM will be a two bagger usually.
analyst upgrades yesterday i believe
When the fuck is GME gonna do its thing
PLTR cut through $18 like butter
Fremont ready for takeoff
Leave a dip to buy a rip true wsb
PLTR GANG RISE UP
Why popping? What makes u say that
Imagine selling below 19
PLTR anything
okay not renting it bc u need ID and all that shit but you get the idea
*Softbank has entered the chat*
PLTR didn't even notice there was an $18 wall just blasted through it
Lol.
Damn I wonder how much longer SPY can go up before we get a drop
I want the covid stocks to dieeeeeee

Die ZM

Die PTON

Die you overvalued trash
Damn okay Overstock. The beast is awake
Went from down 40% all time to down 2% all time. Thanks PLTR!!
PLTR is a betty stock
PLTR 🟩🟩🟩🤠👌
my wsb fellow gods, PLTR is the next nio now u decide, what price are we going to next week
sold my 5 palantir strike 16 expiring Friday for breakeven at open after bagholding for a week, those fuckers are now up 220% lol
this play is a fucking monster. earnings call last night changed my whole plan for the day
PLTR at 167% volume today versus the daily avg of the last 5 days 

It’s going to $20 today boys
I mean that’s what I was saying when it was stuck in the 38-41 range for weeks lol
true, i think its a nightmare if they go down those routes, but I have no clue. you seem to know mroe than me. good luck with ur plays bro. i like how u thinking.
Watch out PLTR just burst through
Fucking mongols
Corsair will literally just not stop sucking me off, I've already busted a few times girl sheesh
Need to turn $1500 into $100,000 so I can move out what’s the move
Id take some profits if you haven’t but that’s just me. I was in around 11 and took profits at 17
I got many NET $70c 5/21
F you BABA. I Trusted you, but I am sick of it.

I am moving to FOMO PLTR.
Its OTC in the Canadian market, only trades on certain platforms. However, the company is awaiting a NASDAQ uplisting which will make it available pretty much everywhere
I was on board until you suggested renting a car vs stealing one.
Couldn’t be more wrong
I’m thinking this is the bottom for VXX. Buy your Blackjack insurance now
I CAN SEE THE VAHALLA FROM THIS VIEW NIO BRETHREN.
Without rona it could have been broken the 25k by now
Money is money my friend
PLTR I should’ve never sold covered calls on you baby I’m sorry. Please finish the week below $20 so I can keep you
God I fucking hope so
Green ending, fuk u bears
Arya Stark + Elon Musk causing shitcoin to explode!!! How didn't I see this.
Jesus fuck PLTR actually gonna hit my $19 PMCC for Friday and fuck over my leaps lol
Sold my $17 C too soon & then my $18 C too soon, said fuck it and bought 10 C contracts @ $20 for this Friday woohoo
BABA 1/15 290 calls
you regret it dont you, you retard
Whats wrong with shitcoin it keeps mooning
Wait for 17.70 to get in
Spy calls
If you’re gonna buy puts rn, have them be longer dated at least until December. This market will tank soon with lockdowns, but it’s hard to guess when
damn pltr
I see a lot of people saying it’s going to “moon” not a lot of DD. Maybe I missed it.

Definitely not seeing the case for tjis being the next tsla/nio
Tesla needed this to bust out tm it’s fine
Hindsight is 20/20. You'll end up killing yourself with that mindsight

Cool they turned it off at 11am

Seriously... There are people who discover options after saving six figures and waste it all away.

A summer’s worth of minimum wage is nothing - he’ll look back on this and laugh

Consider this a good learning lesson
Strongly agree
PLTR SLOW DOWN IM TRYING TO BUY MORE
SPY calls
The fact that everyone is talking about NIO and PLTR means i’m not touching that shit with a 10 ft pole. Good luck autists, i hope you don’t get PRPL’d lmao
200 shares checking in, even 100 will make you a few k in the long run
sector rotation into the koin
Bought 18c 11/20 PLTR at 16.94 today 😭😭😭
Laughing at stonks.
Nope, I always buy into MSFT@200 and AAPL@105-110 but I didn't have money last time :(
someone give me a 1k yolo
So MSFT green EOD??
I want to hold NIO through earning but I know I definitely shouldn't. They have a higher chance of popping than dumping
SPY flat bigly
Lmao surely you can afford a better strike than that
Selling CRSR for TSLA will haunt me.
im in.
turn tricks as fast as you possibly can. 2k goes to advertising

No stim. Food banks overrun. Vaccine doesn’t cure brokeittus or poor pox. Mangos being a dick. 

Basically everything is overvalued & sitting at ATH. 

Not sure what was to be expected.
*works for 2 mins*

“Oop gotta check to see if Tesla broke out yet”
NIO so risky r n
Be careful PLTR boys. Lotta walls over 18!
NVDA spreads all the way. Only thing that worries me is that tech stocks have tended to drop even after smashing earnings
We broke 18. Firm handshakes all around 🤝. Just please don't use the hand you've been fapping with
Sounds like a personal problem
thanks, its not a talked about stock like CVS or FISV.

under the radar, VERY CRAZY options activity around $22 strike price WITH NO HEDGES?

dude we hitting $25 by feburary, but im playing it safe and following the whale. up 50%. good luck brotha
Odds NIO goes up after earnings?
COME ON BULLS WHERE YOU HIDING?!

It’s -5%?
something is up with VALE.  Volume the past 2 days has been insane
I got long calls to brotha
HOLY SHIT PLTR
Go back 24 hours and short GoodRX
Crsr breaking out
Yup I literally just copied some retard here. I guess I get what I deserve lol
NIO and PLTR flying 🤤🤤🤤

JOINT KINGS
Pltr. Feels dangerous holding
$45
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHH IM HARD
Up 50% on SBUX Jan 15 $100c. Should I hold?
PLTR has reached 18... its now impossible for WSB not to fuck it.

PLTR won’t be stopped
Fuck it. I will
DKNG quietly mooning.
You never rent a car dummy.... you steal one. Rentals can always be traced back.
Profit is profit. You'll get the premium plus the upside.

Unfortunately my IRA doesn't let me sell covered calls from my $25 LEAPs....
SQ is my poopcoin exposure
nope, 11/27 20$
NIO 61c 11/20 here we goooooo
Yes. Also I’m in the industry and NET far exceeds pretty much any other competitor in product offerings, profit margin, and revenue is getting there. Next earnings will be 15% jump at least.
You’ll never make money again
Fair point if PLTR goes down 50% I wouldn’t lose sleep this is my fuck around money I’m holding
Take another look homie
You’re welcome ;)
yep , limit sell at open sold above what i set even

&#x200B;

THIS WASNT A PUMP RETARD MORON
Show is amazing.
PLTR is the new TSLA
If it is spy should be up 300%+ by next week
Should have bought 200 shares of PLTR instead of 100
If anyone is looking for an EV stock other than TSLA or NIA, take a look at SOLO.  


$370M market cap compared to $60B NIO
How many of you are fuk on CCL puts
I regret selling 10.5c and 22c so early but my 16c is almost tripple rn
See you then
I took profit on my 11c lol it was up like 400%
Rip to who ever got Tesla at open
Free Money
Oooh that NIO v shaped recovery tho
CRSR just going stupid.
#NIO WILL BRING BALANCE TO THE MATRIX
TSLA fighting back?
Time for PLTR gap up lets go!
I just bought in. Second options trade ever. Am i fukd?
Meh
200 shares here currently, considering getting even more, but the weekly covered calls are pretty weak sauce right now. I'll wait and see if there's a dip to ~$17 before grabbing up like 500 more or something.

Ig my new question is, is it too late to join the pltr train? I feel like I’m missing oit
Don’t miss out on NIO
you can lose the "Inc" bit
You’ve got to get to $51 by the end of week to break even. You’ll get ~100% gains at $55, 50% gains at $53, lose 50% at $51, and so on. With only a few days left until expiration you’ll have maybe $0.25 to $0.50 in time/volatility value (which is where IV crush kills you) compared to $1.50 or so today
WE BROKE DOWN THE WALL BABY
NVDA 11/20 520-530 call spread is trading at $5.30 it’s already ITM so as long as NVDA doesn’t totally bomb earnings it’s easy money
based on unusual options activity (check volume/OI on $22 strike price vs all other prices)

and Morgan stanely/JPM price targets have been reliable, just look when they said $18 PT they were right.
PLTR’s RSI at daily lows, pump incoming
TSLA pump and dump, garbage stock
This is the closest I'll ever get to cumming without actually cumming
If you’re losing money you must not be buying spy calls

It’s the cheat code to unlock unlimited green on on your screen
BA 250 by EOY?
*Mordor. The one place in Middle-Earth we don’t want to see any closer. And it’s the one place we’re trying to get to. It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.*
Anyone watching level 2 for PLTR. This is crazy
Up 140% on this call. Hold til expiry next week or sell??
[deleted]
I personally believe it is better to trade the companies that deal with the compression of natural gas. Far more stable from a cash flow perspective.

AROC, USAC, and CCLP
PLTR huge growth expected
Up 124% or 4500!!!
Moderna needs to fucking die... like 70 EoW
Not TSLA lmaoooo
[deleted]
Most likely, then buy back in

Pltr definitely going to moon again tomorrow 🚀🚀

If they aren't shorting tesla they aren't confident in their predictions.

If they are shorting tsla they're clowns anyway
Better hurry up IV is going through the roof rn lol

only play options on PLTR, the lockup expiring in a few months is scary with the volume of shares to be unloaded
Do you mean $42? was it ever $52?
Remindme! 7 hours
don't do it unless you like max pain
What is this I can't find it on my Acorns account.
Ridic lol

I would get in now
Until a week ago I thought Chick-fil-A was pronounced "Chick filla"

3x sell volume of PLTR.

Careful gents
Why was my post banned just like this... NIO, LI, XPEV, QQQ, PLTR
Classic
No, theyre an actual company and not a chinese pump and dump
#YES YES SHILL PLTR
PLTR $18 💪💪💪
PENN doing something I like here
If you haven't got in on PLTR there's more time and huge growth until $30
Do it
tesla find the bottom?
PLTR FDs
Anyone that opposes student loan forgiveness is a hater, I can pay it off but I had a hard life and I really really need to buy a new Cayenne Porsche to be able to live with myself
Definitely
might throw 100 bucks at $25 NIO contracts as they are $7 per contract.   risk/reward is pretty good..lol
They probably threw out some random high prediction to make sure they could get out well before that without any liquidity issues.
Talk me out of BABA Feb 21 $300 calls for $7.50 or join me!
IV is skyrocketing on PLTR
NIO is about to pop right here.  Will run to 50 EOD.
Everybody talking about PLTR but SOLO is not far behind.
but I did sell 15$ in the money calls and sold puts under 40
[deleted]
Man this sucks. No mardi gras in nola i might as well move
Value investors predict TSLA will crash the S&P. 

https://twitter.com/johnauthers/status/1328721507451875333
That would be nice, because I’m -60% right now
*pltr
Yes... (Matt Damon voice in interstellar)
I bought 280 shares at 10$ because I loved the name tbh. Better to be lucky than intelligent right?
i mean if this isnt mooning then i guess ure waiting for a 30% day or something
Riding NIO to the promised land
Soros would like to have a word with you
how to turn $2k into $100k by tomorrow?
just go all-in on 11/27 QQQ calls
god i fucking hope so dude. already 60% loss rn
Got out of PLTR call at 18.03, forgot about fat trades and have one strike left lmaoo. good luck boys.
This is the way
Well hopefully it is cause NKLA ran up to $78.
that's 1 analyst's speculation, not a lot to go off of.
Calls are still cheap too, im holding 10 contracts for Friday.
Fisker? I barely know her!
Lol at SQ having just as good of a day as TSLA
Before or after they split the stock?
Yea my dad on how he lost his house...
WHAT IS BEETCOIN DOING
Rotating out of PLTR shares and into PLTR calls
11/27 8.5c is what I have. 9c is probably safe
get some SOLO. not only blue chips ;)
nice dude we making bread still. check out how this is holding strong here, looks like $22 is defintive.
[deleted]
SOLO 8 eod
[deleted]
We suffer together, and thanks, I guess one small step towards better days, I’m holding the longer dated riot calls and my ostk calls until tomorrow, see how she goes
[deleted]
Are you watching? Spy about to follow the co!n...blow off top commence 400 eom
Nice man! That's how you do it. I sold calls and decided to buy some shares to just hang onto for the long run.
THIS IS AFTER I SOLD . i got yall
I’m in on 2023 Leaps for PLTR. So I’m not bashing, but I’m saying there’s an opportunity on BA this week. The hype of recertification could push it 15% overnight and tomorrow
PLTR is evil. There, I said it.
Is this the “WSB split” ?
TESLA is finally behaving well. 

Nowonder Elon Musk keeps showing up on my [investing.com](https://investing.com) website dancing interestingly. His dance is very similar to Trump's but a tit better. Musk's is more like a hoppy chicken or Kangaroo while Trump is heavy and slow, more like a fat Pinguin.
Buy shares, hold 10 years, collect tendies if it doesn’t go tits up
Only about 7 out of 10...for now.
hit 58 mil volume... pltr's got everyone playing
Its either this or throwing it on black but this is a slower depression.
Wtf PLTR
how u feel about AES? I still think this whale is right, there is a rotation into smaller cap stocks and $22 is looking likely
Up bigly today.  Should I look for a dip in next week or so?
I've got a further out expiry so just gonna hold and see if we can get another dump in the next few weeks.
Sold right at open thank god lol
I'm still technically up on my position, but really should have sold at open and am kicking myself.
EOD\*  


ftfy
I said that too after paper handing some shit last week and missed out on 200% gains but I bought calls today
Thank you 🙏
add
Take a break and come back fresh ❤️
That's probably for the best
lol no matter what it does people are gonna dump it, you crazy
Isn't some one speaking today
Thank you, good sir! Made around 300 on one put (should've bought more...lol)...sold it just before the upward trend just now :)
So this is what it’s like being a hot sorority girl
Please tell me you bought at open
Batman
hell yeah, i own 10 shares over 30$ now got some spce at 20 and 21 next 3 weeks gonna be so sexy lit retards.
Shhhh don’t turn it into a meme
at least there are like 3 people in here that understand things like this
Gotta send PLTR to a chiropractor after carrying my portfolio today
Hype isn't necessary a bad thing. Look what happened to NIO. Sometimes, let your winners run and see how far it can go
One of us 

One of us 

One of us
You didn’t buy the dip then, you ain’t buying the next one either...lmao
We know. 

Welcome.
PLTR vaccine news coming out soon, 99% effective get in now!!!
The FOMO is back. Pretty sure there will be a good pull back before it gets to 20k but I'm holding out for 10 million. Let's go!
Zing!
Last peak it shot from here to 20k in a matter of *hours*.

it’s gotten arthritic in its old age
i know nothing
Honestly consensus here seems to be anywhere from 25 to 50 lmao
Good entry on Tesla here, at the trendline it broke out of
Hold!
Same, what strike
PLTR: look at me I’m the new NIO now
PLTR breaking 18. get innn
[deleted]
looks like u were wrong retard
Is it your first time? How long did it take to save 28k
Jesus. I feel. I'm down 5k from July. Down to 400. In shambles. Hoping for better days. Congrats again on your win
Earnings are going to suck for NIO. Still bullish in the long term but I’m certain it’s way to overhyped rn.
Praying MMS trapping bears 🙏
I only bought a 1000 shares. Fuck the options. Now that’s the tards.
Go look at your calendar.
Yes
🖐
Riding PLTR is like doing coke without having to pay for it
how can PLTR go down...can it?
When it hits 20 today
I have a such a mega feeling this pltr is the next nkla lmfao
All up to your financial situation
What's your risk management?
2 back to back 100%+ on palintier however that nonsense is spelled. Thank you CIA 🙏
I’d hold for now
hi, are you trading nasdaq futures?
Buy PLUG on this dip?
Large put order came in for pltr
Hold that shit
[deleted]
PLTR 20 EOW
tdoc givin me a hard fuckn. they better be performing robotic surgery on my anus today....remotely
Yea thats what I thought as well. We will keep having this quick pull bakcs then surges to 20 this week im guessing.
If you have to ask, you already answered your question
[deleted]
Just hold strong sir it’s gonna keep going
At least your honest. How much was it
Quality DD right there.  This is why I come to WSB.
Chart? It’s a fucking horizontal line.
Will PLTR consolidate around 18? At what point do you take some profits?
[removed]
TSLA pleaseeee bro hit this bounce
the tan really brings out the lifelessness of his eyes.

I was hoping for more from TSLA today
Just bought 5 PLTR 21C for like Dec 04... I know nothing about this stock
I got in PLTR at like 15 I’m tryna decide whether to hold long term or take some cash. Mainly because it’s getting too much hype lmao
Still holding. Sold some shares to buy more calls
Everyone should be all over PLUGs nuts right now. 📈
Dude are you fucking serious?
PLTR, E went all in?

P U M P  EEET
They just won a bunch of gov. contracts and work with the CIA, doubt they're a bad long term play tbh.
Yes sell it to me
Submit to china EV stonks and all will be forgiven tesla call holders who bought at open today 😂🇨🇳📈
Is nio gonna plummet after the earnings call? 

Probably not because I have puts for that exact scenario
look at NIO it kept going up past 30. PLTR also has the backing of soros and thiel. super hype, 30 in 2 months
Fuckin' A
MayMay stock
Buy the rumor, sell the news.  I will exit most of my positions EOD.
Hey, What's the platform/Broker you are using?
Selling covered calls on NIO. Think I might get fucked tbh
You’re wildin bro..
But they reported a gross margin of 28% recent q... is that not enough?
That is your bear case right?
Hardly a YOLO.

BABA gang wya? I just decupled down on my 12/20 300c
You just posted on Stocktwits didn’t you
Government deals, hype, nothing but amazing catalysts coming up list goes on great founder etc
Earnings
That me 🤚
PLTR can I here 20!!!
PLTR holding over 18 today tomorrow will be 20.
Ball so hard motherfuckers wanna fine me
I'd still say there's a 75% chance this expires worthless, could wind up being a good play. Learn your lesson and hold to exp.
FCEL gang checking back in. Where my dawgs at and did you take profits this morning
It's the circle of life.
No I own shares lol just curious what the consensus is
They'll smash expectations, and it'll dip a bit.
Wooo ... sold that 11/20 call right at the peak
It’s time to stop ✋
>Keep sticking it to the man!

Yeah! Stick it to 'em by...losing on every trade?
Update for you 🚀🚀🚀

https://imgur.com/gallery/moN0Lne
Yes, but not yet.

This is a buy-the-news and sell-the-reality event.

TSLA bought up because it's joining S&P500. It's being sold because the reality is it doesn't really mean anything for the company's valuation, and the event that would be bullish on the price (indices buying it up) won't happen for a little while.
Holding NIO through earnings, just want to see at what point NIO and my IQ crossover.
[deleted]
My comments from yesterday and today were clearly a joke. I made my prediction days ago for TSLA and it will come true.

SQ will have a minimum net income of 50m just because they doubled their money invested in shitcoin lol; best quarter ever for them
Just reclaim 340 at least elon
Should’ve bought further out
Yeah I don’t get it. We should want just about every stock to succeed. Except NKLA.
Shorts putting up blocks at 18 as soon as it dips below. As long as volume stays they’re fucked.
Tesla bag holders raise your hand
[deleted]
Might let my 11/20 44c ride.
 Should have reinvested in puts to sell midday then open PLTR.
precisely.
If I break even on baba I’ll never touch her again
Why is NIOs volume so high everyday
Dw, still made $3. Enough to hire ur mom for 3 nights.
This is the way
318k by December 2021 according to CITI
up 60%
the volume in PLTR isn't even much but the potential is there  🚀🚀🚀
RIP to dumbass CCL Put Holders
Shit 20 by EOD
are you having a stroke
My foot and his ass if it doesn’t reverse and go back the fok up
What’s ur time horizon on that
NOK green every day this month just about. Yummy
SPCE would show some retard strength the day I switch to puts
Lol pltr has been getting pumped here for weeks
MSOS for US legalization, no options though.  YOLO has same US exposure as well and is optionable.
The disadvantages of options over time can wreck havoc on your account. This is why I mainly trade futures now. I hate being right on the direction but still lose money because of IV/theta or some other BS. I still make options trades here and there though but I don't put too much in them.
yea im up 50%, def still holding. that options whale knew it was gonna hit $22
Missed tsla but PLTR is giving me confidence
first one is always free
Fuck should I buy CCL 17p 11/20
[removed]
11/20 is the eow retard
Eow

25k eom

50k+ eoy
Same. Diamond handing those bad boys til they die. Boomers gonna dump it
Yeah dude idk about that one. You should’ve bought further out
Bullish case for $PLTR

* EV is the future
* Great retail space
* E-commerce is booming
* High growth stock
* Great travel company
* Has mobile banking system
* Stay at home and reopening stock
The irony is that’s also how the audits of US companies are going these days.
Picked up a 12/18 30c at open, pretty happy. Thanks!
This might be the worst one I’ve seen r/smallstreetbets
It’s considered a pump and dump. 

You know unlike stocks....
Well CUM with us buddy. 30 on the way.
congrats on anyone who made tsla tendies
FOMO'D MY MOMS CREDIT CARD INTO PLTR LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
I feel you buddy, I’m trying to rebuild from 600 bucks, lost 14k being a bear during the spring and summer
What is everyone here doing for NIO earnings?...0
Side note: Why the hell was this show so popular? This clip was horribly unfunny.
LET NIO COOK 👨‍🍳
BABA come on.

You are a degenerate if you haven’t bought this drop... retards anything less than $50 is a good deal for a long term hold

The lower BABA goes the more shares I buy
told u fucks to get in pltr last week.  20 by end of week.
Jesus fucking Christ man... today is a good day 😂
LOOOOL
It’s crazy knowing PLTR will hit 40. It is going straight meme stock
Shit, tried to catch a bounce on TSLA but it just keeps bleeding.
100+
I feel ya lol feels bad
tsla is back on the me u guys!
Guys, Tesla longs are in. They have their shares. This entire run up was dumbasses who think admission to the Standard of Poor People merits a 13% AH run up. It should’ve barely moved. It was people FOMOing in and now paper handing out.
😍🥰
you can still buy in

Don't buy the fuel, buy the container. Long TANK
I ain’t selling till it’s 50
Bro these NIO options expensive as tits. $500 a pop wtf
PLTR my shining knight
PLTR seems like profit taking going to happen at 18
Probably not, Chinese Black Friday already passed
Go LoNG

Bought my first options last week. PLTR 11/20 18c and 21.5c. Soooo. I guess now I'm addicted? Cool.
up 50% today how u hanging brotha
Babaaa please bounce, my hair is turning grey. I’ve worked hard for this money
up to you man. I've gotten so fucked these last two weeks so my advice probably isn't best. I've just gotten burned by MARA many times. That's all
Can someone point me to the tendies ?
In honestly just how high can PLTR go long term bois?
You need a new crystal ball
up 70% u were wrong idiot
Pussy Protection Team
YOLO is the way
It’s likely a hedge and not a straight bet, so both can be smart. The play made $11.25M in premium, that’s guaranteed profit for an institution now. Not every exercised option is retarded
[deleted]
Those sell walls are real, patience.
up 70% u were wrong idiot
I wish I did 😢
And when nio does its after hours thing I'll be doing even better
At this rate $hitecoin is about to hit 20k by the end of this month
WE ONLY FUCK 18+ AROUND HERE
Thank you. Someone actually used their common sense. King.
I thought the DD was great, hopping into February calls tomorrow when my cash settles
Your wife's boyfriend
Something something... rouge wave.
Wouldn’t funds buying it up increase the price though? Why sell now if the price will presumably go up when it hits the S&P in December?
wow lmfao these CCL pits are fucking me so hard
I bought more like a true autist
I think I heard 1000 PLTR retards cum in unison.
Bruh ZM is such an options burning machine
BUCKLE UP PALANTARDS!!! 🚀🚀🚀
For real though, how much higher can PLTR go today? It's smashing through every barrier!
All these pltr posts here getting me nervous holding..
I would have rather swallowed a live mouse the buy these Tesla calls
Man yer talkin propane and propane accessories
Fuck it 100 nug platter tonight on me
might trade flat the rest of the day then pump later during the week. maybe they want to see what the bottom is because it's been red all day so far over the 15min
Nothing feels worse than when a stock you just bought turns red immediately and stays that way for days.

It’s a stock that goes up.
I only trade options with a very very small % of my portfolio. It may be 🌈 but it makes me tendies.
NIO calls for life baby!!! 🌝
I’m relatively new here. Why are we not allowed to mention shitecoin. Imagine its own special thread here ...
my one (1) boeing call is the only reason i’m not red
When do I sell these TSLA Puts I’m thinking 420
Pltr to fucking mars
Pltr is second NIO ??
ok
I ain’t selling PLTR till it’s 30 lmao
Hope you bought puts at open with your profit for when it settles.
holy fuck why don't i have more in PLTR <3
PLTR 23k wall at 18.10
Hey fuck you
Only have 121 shares. Wish I sold a kidney and bought more.
Ironically enough the best catalyst for TSLA to pump could be NIO AH. 😂
is this a PLTR subsidiary?
Too bad the float is too big near a billion shares tradable. Otherwise might been in the 20s already.
We are officially above $18 PLTR March 16c take off!
The S&P inclusion has been priced in since July....
Nobody knows but its provocative
Russian EV me thinks
ITS THROUGH 18
PLTR Breakin the wall..breakin the wall.  18+
Who is the best trader on YouTube?
i know there was a ban on mentioning it here, but i would think people would be talking about the move more.
I know right? Up 6% how amazing
Why not run up the price with juiced up earnings before cashing out?  Not exactly complicated.
Getting a bad feeling about NIO
Calls on Airline companies.
I expect more vaccine news from non-US companies and other US drug companies as well. I also expect treatments that will make it much less dangerous.
You know I'm a bear, but I have a weird feeling SPY is gonna drop a bit then suddenly assblast to the moon
[deleted]
WE did it boys we broke 18
it's incredible how shorts just keep adding to their position everyday for the last two weeks

QQQ's put call ratio for the last two weeks has been over 1.5 almost everyday

there isn't going to be any type of crash until that ratio flips back to sub .7 and the shorts have to close positions

until then we'll slowly grind up to ATH

PLTR brought me back from the brink of implosion

It's down 7% since this post
Why would you do that when you can just come here to WSB and be financially independent for free?  No wait.....
No, for the same reason.
ban
Every-time I  check tesla it goes more and more and more and more and more and more down FUCKKKK
$18 is broken!
That month BABA chart is just terrible.
Oh you are right, can’t really see clearly with all these tendies in front of me.
ITS HAPPENING
If it hits 5$ sometime in the next 2 days, ill make some money
Not gonna lie I love how it’s looking. When shit jumps too much before ER it usually tanks. Slow climb or flat and it moons AH.
yea I might its down to $1,200 now
We just need to turn it back into a meme stock
EIGHTEEEEEEEEEEEEN
is TSLA done with S&P news? its fading fast
FUCK YES PLTR
I haven't been...
35,000 share block at $18.00 for PLTR. If it breaks that it’s straight to $18.10 and a 23,000 share block. After that it’s rocket ship time.

If you didn’t take profits for Tesla at open I don’t feel bad for you. Up over $50 overnight and penny pinching for more. Greedy bastards.

Elon just stomping on my balls right now

lmfao
Tesla has hurt me today but I have 2 weeks for it to hit 490
It's weird to see my portfolio drop like 30% and i'm not even phased by it. Wallstreetbets has really either made me a true degenerate or really apathetic
I guess tesla wants to fill the gap
Don’t mind this at all. Would love for the day to end around 47/48 though...
We touched 18! Only a fraction of a second but we were there!
fuuuuuckkkkkk I seent it
NIO will crush earnings tomorrow morning for sure..... no way the Chi Coms let their prestige brand take a huge price dump.  If you are worried about IV crush buy shares, deep ITM calls or spreads.
IM just surprised that my 25 PLTR stocks made me more money today then my 25 tesla stocks. LOOOOL what kind on nonsense is this.
only autist think natural gas comes in portable tanks
The 420 joke is not fucking funny anymore elon you fuckface corona sniffer

Lmao I hate this rotation into boomers stocks I guess Wall Street aren’t buying the 6 weeks lock down
PLTR going to hulk dick through 18 yeet
beeeeeeeeeeeeeetCOIIIIN
Same here, actually. I bought at 77 after the radical dip from 120, averaged down to 67 over the past month, and got fed up this morning.
**should I hold or get out of my MSFT 200c 3/20?**
MAWDSSS
Ye, no idea how to tag it as OC
I turned it into a spread lol
Obviously, calls on pieces of shit stocks today.
Take a look at the charts and get back to me bruv.

Tendies for days!!!
we're still laughing at you
I knew TSLA puts were the play fuk
Meanwhile, TSLA is 17% below its all time high that it topped out at 2.5 months ago, even after being added to the SPX.

amzn pillpack will not dent CVS at all imo. CVS is such a diversified healthcare company amazon doesnt even compare. CVS does the same thing too, who do u think ppl will go to for prescriptions (mail and inperson vs mail only)? even then, thats such a small market compared to LTC pharmacy and aetna imo.

&#x200B;

all my opinion, no clue what this woman ceo will do different. but i think AMZN Pillpack is such a dumb idea in a very competitive market. well see how it plays out.
I'm really shocked TSLA is giving it all back.  Don't people realize that all the ETF indexes that carry S & P 500 have to buy it now?
Throwing 100% of your portfolio 1 minute before market close, that’s sus
There are so many haters who want to prove a point that once we beat them it’s  game over
This is true WSB retardation lmao
11/20 is EOW ya dingus
don't let SOLO fade away  
theres so much hype in this one and can easily go to 15

Bought a $18p 12/4 today. Expecting it to drop down a bit after today's huge rally.
Maybe not as retarded as selling 20 18cs on the weekly
# PLTR 30c 11/20 ya'll laughed at me at market open
🌈 🐻
Nah, I just fomo into the 20c at .30 because some dude said he got 100 calls for 20 next week.  

I wished I'd have gotten at least 60.  I thought it was a shit bet too
It might be a toilet, but it’s my toilet
PLTR 18 please so i can legally nut on you

Is Tesla really gonna go to $420?
What’s the play today boys
Stop teasing PLTR. Take me now.
No runup means moon
You know what I learned. My shitcoins and common stock portfolio have outperformed my Options trading account even though I don’t actively manage it. Maybe time to quit options trading.
Dang should have bought my palantir calls yesterday. Need to find a new entry point.
I see it going up to $20 atleast. If datadogshit can have such a crazy run on some shitty analytics platform. I can see this Machine Learning consulting company do 12 times better. Also Machine Learning is based on reinforced learning so PLTR product legit gets better every single day. So eventually even their corporate applications will be killer at predicting things, just like how their government applications can track an 'Osama Bin Laden' down to his socks.
Said it yesterday, but PLTR keeps giving me that $18 Poseidon's Kiss 💩

yeah, i got a lotto stash of GBTC i will be holding for the next 1-2 years at least.
Wait is JPow the bear king talking today?


I've been worried sick waiting for a status update on his tools and his toolbox
Yeah - don't get NET at all - dumps when FSLY dumps but doesn't follow it up. Sold out of my NET position today.
Stay away from it imo
i think you proved him with the price action today, i’m sure he’s losing a lot of money
If you had that kind of money you would still put it all on the same ticker
My cost is in the 70's.... I bought what i thought was a dip after coming down from 120's. Didnt cash out and take losses, because this one will get back over 100. Might take a long time, but it will.
EOD
Sold and bought palantir
Should I sell with this iv right now? I also got ostk weeklies
Why...why
i lost about 15K as well it just kept dipping and all of a sudden there was no more money to buy on the dip
They are already priced in for a longer winter. That’s why Nat gas prices spiked over the last couple months. If you really want specific names how about Cabot, Devon, Cimarex (also has oil), Comstock, CNX.

That BA pump is legit
Yeah, I understand the hesitation.  If I had your capital I'd sell puts on AAPL or MSFT.

Good luck!
i said leaps dude. leaps are a year out. you did a 30% out the money call a month out... i was thinking like 110 strike a year+ out and just forgetting about it in my 401k.
Seems like it already broke lmfao
I wouldnt
Like you should have bought a better strike
18 on PLTR. Going to 30 after some little pull backs. Get in soon on a red day...
The entire damn sub bout to throw a party if PLTR manages to hit 18.
FaceTime me, we’ll do it together
LOL I was coming to comment this too XDDDD
Tell it to stop :(
PLTR giving $18 a few smooches before going deep inside
DQ just split 5-1 if you’re looking for a solar play for long-term
GME is a literal toilet.
Puts at 361 it is
PLTR, I can only nut so much in a week. Keep making me rich, good friend
LooooooL
Are we not pumping MARA like RIOT
Shit man, do I get into PLTR, SOLO, or BLNK? They've all ran so high so fast. Maybe I should wait for a pullback.
for sure thought we would test $500 today. Guess not
[deleted]
how retarded would it be to get riot calls now?
We’re here for you.  I know how it is.
so for an 11/20 47 call what would texhnically have to happen? (paid 3.92) for it
What do you think will change in that short a time frame? Hard to see successful cruises by then. I'm in leaps.
BA volume really kicked up the past 30 minutes
Congrats. Again, careful with MARA
Just need to beat the shorters and we in tendy town
If PLTR breaks and hold $18 today I will eat my left sock.
SBE for the win!
Sold mine right before that pump thankfully at a 35% loss
I think it is a boring steady Eddy stock now
Lmao after all the complaints I had to actually look up what CCL was ><.
Impressive deduction sir.

[PLTR BITCH YOU KEEP GOING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ7ndjhhps)
Not a GME bear but If your willing to take a huge risk, hold thru this week on the possibility of no news and a slow bleed. But there’s a good chance something comes out this week, so play accordingly, options are betting something big comes out but who knows
Just like $16, PLTR gonna absolutely fly once $18 breaks
Yep
TACO
PLTR is the best EV company around this thing is fucking runnin

He only bought it because I bought it on ipo day
Nobody in here talking about NVDA earnings? No run up. Wonder if it will tank after the ER

Thanks. I’m trying to have a good day I’m just in a bit of a funk right now

PLTR 18!
Thats good shit
PLTR flashed 18 for a moment!
Keep wishing
Yeah that didn't turn out well. Why in the fuck it's getting pumped I have no idea.

More a question. Their key drivers were vaccine (people assumed they would reap revenue on vaccines administered) and amazon pillpack making waves. Vaccine pump seems to be fading right now as people took some profits. 

Does anyone see big buyers stepping in keeping the price action going? or wait for that october resistance before buying.

I’m having a good day.  They’re not always around.  Big hugs to my brothers and sisters who could use one today.
no thats called investing
Anyone who bought TSLA calls at open blew up their accounts rip
You already made $500. Pull back and flat rest of the day.  This shit has a PT of 20 by EOM. Institutional buying will make this moon more. I suspect the company is buying back the stock equity it gave out so easily to employees in the past few years. 🚀 🚀
every little dip getting bought up again lol
Same. I wanna ride this bitch down and buy the dip
If? You mean when.
buy calls for jan/feb when everyone hates it, fund buying will start over the ensuing weeks.  right now everyone is selling the news/price being driven down before funds have to buy so that they're not paying premium.

An 8% rally in 3.5 days wouldn't surprise you?
Ya’ll think Tesla is dead? Just wait until it comes back like 2 day old tacos at a piano recital
Why are my Baba calls not printing
Well sure, after a parabolic run to 400+
GME bears, how long are we gonna hold these puts? Next ER probably gonna be another squeeze too I’m afraid.
That shit is going to 25 before year end.  I'd buy calls now.  They will sell out every sailing for 10 years post vaccine
Yeah bought little  after IPO and averaged down but quit chasing now. Average around 36 but seems now anytime it’s get to 37 always sells off. Surprised as earnings and growth seemed pretty good. I bet the ceo sold some shares again.
Yes but so are we

PLTR puts now
Hold NIO through earning or nah
Everybody so greedy in this market.
I feel like this may be the start of a short term sell off in TSLA, in general. Fund managers that track S&P aren’t going to want to buy near all time highs. Investors that rode this shit since last year will want to realize some profits now that inclusion has been announced. Just my thoughts though
Sweet, thanks
Thanks!
Part of me wants to be the dude that posts epic gains by 💎👐 on these 5/21/21 17.5 pltr calls. 

Another part wants to close them at 2x, and move on to the next.
i’m so erect for the number 18
If PLTR breaks 18 I’m gonna bust a nut
ya SHEEP buying planteer just cuz soros bought it 

nib is like 120 years old
Haha fair enough bro. My comment is aimed at the teslatards anyway, the ones who still think Tesla is gonna moon to $1000 EOY
Just thought about it but idk.

Nut material
I did think it was funny how they've been saying there's no way to make an effective vaccine for a coronavirus, to now saying 90% effective. As month ago the best they could do is like 30% with multiple doses.

I definitely think Trump is hyping the vaccine cause he wants to calm fear. The deep state & media are really pushing doom & gloom. They don't want any type of hope. Trump realizes that most people trust the medical establishment & big pharma, so he's going that route. It's pretty much the only choice he has. I know Trump tried to speak out about vaccines before, but those that are asleep won't believe that vaccines are risky. I just hope this plan doesn't backfire.
Yup. Got to $17.98 and was like nah
CCL calls for Jan 15 are the play.
lol why
PLTR about to hit $18
I sold everything at 100% on the morning pump.  Heindsight maybe just sold enough to cover and let the rest ride.
No it's good! As I said earlier, QQQJ has great assets but suffers from low volume, which makes the spreads kinda wide. You want a high OI, or *open interest* in order to feel safe entering and exiting the option at a favorable price. June $35's represent the most popular option on QQQJs chain with an OI of 1450~ish. I also like to use the price calculator on OptionsEducation to get a rough idea of what's fair for the particular strike.

Honestly same. How he became such an influential market mover I will have no idea. Every single report I’ve seen has been backed by nothing but the used condom that was used to fuck him in the first place. I dream about what NIO could’ve been. Yes it’s probably over priced but fucking let us have our fun
When something moves 12% in a day and you fomo calls at the top, is that retardation?
indeed it was
Then you should sell cash covered puts.  Then you get a small victory if it moons
Literally exact same for me, it’s bullshit lol
It'll break today or tomorrow

PLTR baby that's it I'm almost there 💦
Pretty happy I withdrew 80% of my account the other day, because if I hadn’t I absolutely 100% would have gone full retard & FOMO’d into TSLA this morning
So is the Coronavirus data, so can we call it even?
PLTR $30 eow
Some guy here bought OTM weeklies on PLTR. I’m bullish and thought that was dumb af. I am eating my words. This thing could totally break $20 EOW.
this will be a feeling you experience many many times in life. Be thankful it was only the money from a wendy's job and not like 100k. It's only money, you can earn it back, just learn something from this.
Teslatards get fucked, next up NIOtards, I hope you all get wiped out and Babatards remain

Xebec Absorbtion
Damn I sold shitcoin at 8.5k
If you zoom out, it seems to be consolidating around $45, at least for now. Although it really ripped over the past week, it looks like in the past, NIO would jump on good news and then coast until the next piece of good news.
I’m chill lol I’m just saying they don’t know which way they wanna go
Fuck Robinhood I called and they said they couldn’t remove my restriction 😐
PLTR is gaining value again.... no way
Sold RIOT $4 pooots yesterday.  They went poof already.
this is so sad
You assholes laughed at me when I bought 600 shares of PLTR at IPO for $10.15.

Who the fuck is laughing now?
Puts CCL
Up to you. Downside of LEAPs is having that money tied up for that long. You could instead sell weeklies against your 100 shares, but I wouldn’t on a stock this cheap. I suggest just holding. Set a limit sell order if you’re worried about it.
Think I’m about to get out of this Tesla call while it’s still in the profit zone, then take that profit and dump it in PLTR
All worthwhile educations are expensive
They did Pluto dirty 😤

The inverse wsb rule is real lol. Figured it wouldn’t take much for enough folks to take profits and bail, and set off a sell off. I was 50/50 on it, wish I played it short a little harder than I did but def glad I didn’t go all in on calls
I bought during IPO like a true retard because I have some DD in the industry. Long holding
I’m on 11/27 expiry. So not quite, but close

Was going through my history and saw that I owned a BA 200C June 2021 just 3 weeks ago that I sold for 20% profit. It is 4x now. Why am I like this?
we end green?
Quick way to look at it is your break even percentage. If you buy an option on a $50 stock with a $55 strike price for $5 then your break even price is $60 and you need 16% movement to break even. 

This is more or less what the Greeks are telling you, just using a number where the stock price doesn’t matter

NIO be acting like a boomer stock the past 2 days. Calm before the storm? Or start of a new trend where it just goes flat for a month?
I bought them at $15 made $5k so far
Actually sneaky liking the price action on ATVI these last three trading days. Been following this bitch the last 6 months and no joke haven’t seen it move like this since it’s last run up. Took a small position because i think it’s manipulated but if it runs up it will be fast and furious
But are you HIV positive?
Restaurant owners are hating dealing with these services. My brother was interviewed by NYT about them and some other shit like them (grubhub or whatever. Fuck all of 'em).
Time to buy $ZM for a day trade?
when does congress adjourn for the winter and quit doing their jobs?
I’m pissed because I sold at open after losing money for a solid month
I hope Jack Ma would go missing, that would crash chinese stocks prolly 4%
Will BABA ever coose green again?
NFLX is the biggest cuck until it’s not...
yikes
No one actually believe cruises will be going back to normal anytime soon, right?  Vaccine or not they should still suffer through the first half of 2021
That is why I am sitting here watching it continue to go up months on end....

Had September not been so fucking terrible I would have had a little altitude to throw a position in and see where it goes but now I know they will dump hard if I size up especially CRSR
tendie land
Pretty sure it gon sell off cuz
if you guys arent buying shares this massive TSLA opportunity you might actually be retarded
Smart if it drops after earnings. I just have 10 calls. Buying 3 more rn 🤯🤯
Me too
Tesla Shorts was the Right move at the beginning. Forgive me Papa Elon
Profit taking
A lot of people HAVE to own it now
Nah, my very early VIN (27xx) model 3 actually just turned 3 years old on Saturday.  But it still gets over 310mi on a full charge which is plenty.  It was retrofitted with HW3 after the fact since it was shipped with 2.5
take care!! quarantine!! calls on moderna may be?
Dude what the hell, please don't be stupid. Withdraw everything, order the best Wendy's meal of your life for yourself and everyone in the Wendy's. Have an after party at a local dive bar and buy a round for everyone. 

Then stop trading for a while and get your head clear.

Better be safe than sorry
Ccp wants to prove they are the real ceo of Baba
Yes. They both sell electrical vehicles my guy lol
Happy birthday to the ground!
Why?
They changes their model to more leisure and to do more shipping.  🤡

&#x200B;

They have many routes they never had before simply due to leisure travel.  🤡
Not that I don't benefit, but why is PLUG trading around $23 if new shares will be offered at $22.25?

i bought 17 and 17.5 puts yesterday for 11/27. i know a lot can happen in that time so i’m hopeful 😅
Boomers think we are going back to old normal..
Mr. Elon, my portfolio doesn’t feel so good..
Help me I just bought more CCL puts
Elon please get it back up to 460. I promise I won’t gamble again 😭😭😭
just added Snap to the long term baby
Good 😁
What a brutal day for bears
let me guess, you didn't sell yet?

im risking infinity
For retardism? We already knew
yeah, you're positively a retard
IF NIO GOESS UP, TESLA GOES UP. IF TESLA GOES UP, NIO GOES UP. thats what happens when you are the main competitors in a market.
For what
Right, and then the complainers got issues with cardi b dressing like an Indian goddess, but WAP for kids is okay
I didn’t know they had a gay test
Unity positions giving me life
Why is tsla falling after all this bullish news?
So..... Diamonds for hands or nahhhhh
im selling calls.
That is what I tell myself every day.

Look how they massacred my boy 🥺
Me too but it's Chinese 😃
TSLA fomoers would like a word.
Just get tested again like papa
NIO spiked with both LI and XPEV but dropped back down so it’s hard to say whether that’s priced in. I don’t fucking know I have calls on a +2400% in a year stock.
i keep hearing of this NIO thing, but because of how many CCP hands are in its cookie jar, so to say, i'll wait for it to retrace, then buy maybe a few stocks, then see how much it pops up
Nah, man. If the market were to crash you'd still wait it out expecting it to keep going down because we're clearly in a second recession and it's going to drop down to even further levels :)
yes
it doesnt have options
Absolute shambles, my house is turning into a cardboard box.
Sitting on about 2k in nio puts, trying to convince myself I shouldn't hold through earnings
Who here took the red pill ?
Absolutely
Give me a reason, I have an extra chromosome you see

Please let CCL just be a squeeze 🙏🏻
Depends on strike/expiration.
sells puts
Why ccl go up?😂
Rude of the market to be down on my birthday
For being a QT3.14?
We don’t claim the dumbasses who buy calls after a 13% AH run up. The real ones just have shares that they don’t even look at.
Both of which are bullshit. Fake ass polished data
I also did buy because I like gambling on wsb retardation lol
So now that all of WSBs PCG calls have expired is it time to buy some monthlies? In for 12/18 13c.
I have only ever bought and sold shares, never done options before. Must be doing something right aye?
Y’all too invested in PLTR. 

BA is where you need to be for the weeklies
LXRX up 50%!!!!
Get better
This day turned out better than expected. Sold my TSLA call debit spread and TSLA put credit spread at market open. Now I just need TSLA to bleed down below 420 so my TSLA call credit spreads don't fuck me.
Aight Im buying TESLAAAAA after this morning rundown of -6%. Tomorrow about to be a mini rebound.
My boyfriend tells me that all the time.
THATS FRESHLA
New Pltr peak around lunch time or tomorrow gentlemen no need to sell or be worried at all
Tsla puts, going to 430 eod,
And then climb 20% over the next two days
If the market is forward looking then why are they pumping up airlines when 90% of their profits come from business travel and that shit ain’t coming back any time in the next 3-4 years with remote work 🤡 show
How much money have you made bro?
sooo shitcoin is totally going to touch its ATH soon it looks.
You’re right.  I’m out.  I’ll make it back.
Doing the same with 1000 shares 19c for this Friday. Scared of losing them Hahaha
We are either going to be blasting screenshots on the earnings thread, or pulling out hair thinking of how we should have kept what money we once had
Yo i just tested postive🥺
Is that bad? :/
New peak tomorrow tho
It’s a very nice policy I am pleased
I prefer Palantir ($PTON)
BABA has touched bottom
I made a oopsie with these Tesla calls at open
Have to understand it depends on your strike. If you’re holding 80c, it beats, and goes up to like $65 youre screwed because the chances of a catalyst causing it to continue up are low. Thus the IV crush. 

You bode far better by buying at or in the money.
Oh Yea!

I honestly enjoy WSB so much. I love shit posting with you retards on my way to tendy land 😋
Bought it back for $50 (now sitting at $78). Sold 11/20 20c for $25 in its place. Is that the wrong move? 

I have no idea what I'm doing btw.

Correct.
Didn’t realize AMD touched 84, now it has to go back to 77
Just got in on Tesla dip at $430 hopefully get a spike back
Tesla is over $500 by EOW
not gonna lie we’re actually so good at making money all we need to do is spam more like i know u guys were going crazy saying PLTR but legitimately just no matter what u type add it after every comment u make i hated free money so i didnt buy until today

SPY is out of steam dude. Reversal coming tomorrow or Thursday.
Theres like 1000-2000 holders at 50 and 60 expiring friday too, hopefully thats good news, 40p and 35p has a little less
It's not unfair when you compare it to other things happening in plain sight. People want to be ignorant. It's fun. Let them. Take their money for yourself.
Yessss!!
Elon musk cucking you teslatards one last time, just as I predicted yesterday.
It’s been an honor serving with you.

so what happened to the 40% something of tesla's float will be removed and causing a squeeze bs?
https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=DNK
SAME BOAT, know how you feel.
I might wait a few days. Got rekt trying to catch a falling knife with BABA. Also this thing is still 20% higher than it was 2 weeks ago.
There’s not gonna be a reversal.  Vaccine trials are going great for 2 pharma’s, so it’s only opportunity for improvement from here.
Baba sell off is essentially done but it might just stay at these levels for a bit
trying to time the top on CCL again
Jesus
Got out of my outs earlier thank goodness
Me selling PLTR when it went up 10% 2 weeks ago 🤡
did CCL make electric boats or something?

who the fuck is buying this shit stock

Elon 😢 why have your forsaken me??
And you know who is gonna tell the CDC to shut them down?... PLTR
You'd be suprised how many retards are rich af these days, it's fucked mate.. it's fucked.
Peloton ($PLTR) get in now
I obviously have some reading to do, thank you
They don't collect data, thats not how their business works.
PLTR looks like it might’ve peaked for today
I obviously have puts :/
That's exactly why there's selling. You think funds want to pay billions in extra while they add?  Drive the price down then acquire.
Sell. Crsr is near its peak without massive resistance or a pullback.
The NIO IV is disgusting rn, not even worth it
American air Lines on some lowkey gains during this red day wtf
Why you do dis
20% that’s insane. I might just say fuck it and hold on to these bad boys because I’m fucking retarded.

When MSFT hits its monthly ritual of 200, buy 220c 2 weeks out. Actually free money. Other than that, don’t play MSFT.
there are better ways to spend your money especially if $1400 is your all you got
Other Chinese electric car companies have blown their earnings. People in China want clean air especially with Covid. China is getting rid of gas car production plants.
Hate to hear it brother. Good luck in the future, hope many a tendy come your way
It’s like getting an extra life in Mario Bros.
Don’t know why. As if people will all suddenly agree to take vaccines
Be a bear, or enough of a bear to have bearish long-term hedge positions, but don't play weeklies.

Fixed that for you. SPY puts killed my portfolio too so condolences.
That was fucking clever. Tip of the hat to you
he doesnt care about us
We all are lol
About 🌲 fiddy
Buy for next week.
I get it, my question comes down to how do I make the 1400 credit and keep my shares? Basically the buyer pays the credit, and if they back out I keep the credit and my shares. If they exercise then I sell and profit my gains at 75 a share. If no one buys then nothing happens.
That's not a baghold. It has a legit shot.
Fuck CCL.  I’m holding for the reversal.

Yeah, it makes no sense
Joking aside... I got a costs basis of $14, so I hope it keeps running. 700 shares deep.
I feel like it would’ve drove NIO into the ground this morning when the news came out. It did fall but definitely still buying going on. I think the article said that would start in December so it’ll be interesting to see how many of these ling ling companies get fucked.
Man the Tesla fade is brutal.
LOOOOOOOOOOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👋👋👋
It just flew. You missed it.
Loaded up on nike calls this morning for the inevitable run up to earnings next month. It's not too late brothers. Join me

Themsfightnwerds
Watch. Blow off top about to commence 390 eow would not surprise me in the least
how much does nio have to beat earnings for the iv not to crush like whats the math behind it?
Li and xpev mooned on earnings. It’s likely priced in that NIO should be in a similar spot. However they ran up harder than the other two which probably limits upside and increases downside. I heard implied move is upwards of 20%. GL
I never could spell well. Teachers always told my parents he know what all the words mean but can't spell.

You won’t do shit lol
Back on that BA train. Looking for certification tomorrow and a quick rally 🤙🏼
Fuck it, holding my NIO calls through earnings, wish me luck retards I’m about to go full retard
I stopped messing with that pay a $20 for cold food and a fucked up order. Also they always steal the popeyes chicken sandwitch
Well whose got a play to recoup my cruiselines ass fucking?
Realistically if you buy a whole bunch of boomer shit like cruises and airplanes now, hold that till you become a boomer. 

What's stopping them from going back to ATH in 15 years other than bankruptcy? Seems like solid holds if you don't wanna be autistic

Yoloing $54 and $57 $NIO calls exp Friday. $1,400 worth, pray for me.
You must not have been here in March/ April. Shit was heated when there were people losing their life savings combined with people hitting the jackpot. Especially in the discussion threads
Oh hey NIO
Amazing

Fair point. I mostly fly southwest so I don't have a choice.

this is not financial advice
Lol take puts now after they made me more then 100%? Where were you at open lol
PLTR
Chi Coms are going to pump the shit out of NIO earnings tomorrow.  All this hype around the stock is just free marketing for their prestige brand.  No way they are not going to juice the the fuck out of the numbers to pump it up.
Just bought 12/24 300c
Who wouldve known the shitter makes you $30k
Same here bro
it's is probably the worst thing about TOS by far

When do we pump sundial
[deleted]
Will be close but still early in the week and daily volumes have been strong. High call volume at $4 and I believe we may be above that by then. 🤞
I’m holding shares but I’m worried about the new SEC thing where they will have their own auditors look at Chinese company books. Not sure if NIO is doing anything shady but you never know. So far no affect from the news.
Well tell me your Tesla at least has the new trillion mile battery
TSLA back to $400 by EOD, amazing
I guess everyone heard that if you own 100 shares of CCL then you get a 100 on-board-credit on their cruises....
Wait that’s my sister
yea my puts getting wrecked
When tf should I get out of PLTR 20C 12/4? At this rate they're gonna be ITM at the end of this week
I took the L and got out
I went all in on PLTR after the dude that foresaw NIO said it’s the next big thing.

Haven’t even checked the price since, this post got me hard ngl

Take out your initial investment and whatever other profits you’d like to lock and then let the rest ride. Nothing wrong with taking green. No one ever imploded their account taking a little green.
Crsr is a good buy even at this price imo if you're holding long term

I’ve got. 16c, up 97% today
Yes everyone tf
Yea they like to remind us what pieces of shit we are.
1/15/21 16c, my only regret is that I didn’t buy more
Hell yea
Lol it's finished
Will check back in a year
[removed]
Yupppp
I see, thinking about 35c for next june.
370 eod or ban me 🤷🏻‍♂️
Do it so I can take puts
44.5p 11/20 🐻
WHY DIDNT I LISTEN TO YOU.
Ccl stops hit this morning now it’s mooning. Fuck this game
Selling off a bit now. I think this is the last time we see S&P 3600 for the year. Likely down or flat from here as we're obviously going full lockdown over the next few weeks. Happy holidays folks.
I need to recover a 5k loss fuck. If anybody has any play that they’re extremely confident about LMK
Nah I want IC
Why would they have a big move tomorrow?? Earnings ?
Anyone holding NIO calls through earnings?
signed up for bull conversion therapy today, have a couple of worthless puts left, but jesus, spy going to 400 eoy for sure, this market is a different beast now
I wasn’t kidding lmao I thought after hours prices transfer to the next day 🤦🏻‍♀️ thank you for answering!
I like the cut of your jib gl
🤣
It’ll go up
Dude.. I bought FSD and 4 bottles of Teslaquila for that occasion.   I apparently missed the FSD "public beta phone call" last Thursday and am devastated.
Shareholders are primarily institutions and insiders. I don't think this sub or retail has any influence on price and we saw multiple attempts from MMs to shake off paper hand investors. Shorts have been loading up trying to cover their positions too. She's gonna moon soon.
is anyone else holding pltr over night?
Didn’t Pfizer drop the following day after their announcement? You had precedence.
Not even to late
The moment you say fuck it and fomo in it will dump 15% in a day.
Palantir can collect whatever data it wants just keep printing
BLNK needs to fucking die
WTF is wrong with people?  China is not going to execute Jack Ma.  They gave him his spanking.  The company is still the Asian Gold Standard.  And it's dirt cheap.
me too, looking for tall bridges
How so...?  2 companies saying vaccine trials are going great!

I closed my Tesla puts should I switch to calls?🤔
PCG rising out of the forest fires like a slow ass phoenix
They lost a client I think?
Lol it'll be back at 300 in about a month

Dumpster fire market. Is the euphoria over? Has everyone on the sideline since the election bought in now?
IMAGINE DOING DD ON PLTR LOL

ALEX KARP HAS FUNNY HAIR , GO & GET FREE MONEY
Ccl can’t stop and won’t stop
Anyone else going into nio ER with puts?
Buy 10x 50c and sell 10x 55c. We’ll see what happens. I’m kind of out of trades and have money in another account that didn’t settle on time.
Oh  rly msft dead again...
Whats everyones predictions on PLTR EOW and EOM?
I think we need new flair for “DP porn”

I sold the same 42c this morning for 1500 profit and then bought back in at the dip. I want to hold for a bit.
Ouch
Mistakes will be made.

How big of a move will nio have tomorrow?
Carnival Corp is getting ready to fly.

tdoc what is u doin bb
u/vredditdownloader
Okay that makes sense to a degree. I would think an even bigger jump is coming soon
5 days
QQQJ is effected by tech but more closely follows the entire market due to increased exposure to healthcare and cyclicals
Congrats and fuck you.
mmm
Tesla breakout, did they finally finish their self-driving and robotaxi network that serves complimentary tequila since you don’t need o drive no mo?
Wtf ZM wtf is wrong with you.
Yes. It will pullback the second you say "fuck it" and buy calls.
SPY weekly and monthly are damn near the same right now
It baffles me that somebody with 250k in NIO shares doesn't know how covered calls work lmao
Saw it here https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionmillionaires/comments/jvu8dt/pltr/
Not to late this is just the beginning buy stock if you’re think your to late! Buy a few calls on the low and flip tomorrow
With u
Cruises being up is so dumb
Its steak for us, hope you jumped the solo train too :D
[deleted]
[deleted]
That's pretty insane
I have stock hold syndrome
First time ever going puts and get fucking destroyed lol 😂😂 fuck u CCL
Nope, do it before it reaches 20
TSLA V recovery maybe
Hey man, at least Cyclical Rotation Reverses On Lockdowns.
How many times have I said buy the PLTR dip? Literally everytime it has dipped today it has been bought up and you still sitting on the sidelines
I honestly don't know when to take profits on CRSR... it never stops going up
as fake as it might sound, he is not lying.  he is telling the truth
Tbf a PE of 25 is pretty healthy rn
BA reached the top now time for it to die
K=30? alright... MY MAN!!
Damn tsla and NIO can wipe out 50% of this sub in one day.
Guess boomers got their social security checks today and dumped it all into cruise lines
>Do you seriously believe that money managers of active funds are making individual weight decisions for all 500 names in the benchmark?

No, and this is a major point of contention in the European media right now.  If everyone rebalances to bring Tesla in line with the benchmark, ESMA will bring down the fucking hammer, accusing them of being "closet index" funds.
We need a team of people constantly analyzing Elon so that we can find shit like this
CRSR been good to me.
I think its risky bro. 60% chance it falls bigly vs 40% up bigly
[removed]
i just got out with like 64% loss
CCl is crazy
Jim Rogers said the markets will always go higher than you expect and lower than you expect. I am expecting 363 SPY EOD, but if it were to get to 365, no complaints. 370 by EOW  :D
Do you want to retire early and shit on your bosses car?
Spy stop the winning I’ve won enough, I don’t know if I can handle any more winning. Call gains every single day of my life 

Get the champagne out here on easy street brothas!!!!!!!
KNDI Crush incoming
pltr is literally the next nio
id cum everywhere
Why’s my American WKH$ not allowed in here but communist NIO is?
question for you: have you ever read a book or a newspaper? I ask because it's hard to imagine you having done so and still being retarded enough to write 'could of.' Have you ever seen the contraction could'f? 

Thank me because in the future people will no longer immediately think you're brain damaged.
Realistically how high can it get in the next year? $15 is its ATH and it's more of a dividend stock so I'm not sure holding calls makes much sense.
why the f is MSFT dumping?
FUCKING TIRED OF BABA, BABA PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
TSLA's 13 EMA about to crosss 50 MA
420.69
sold calls on pltr, do I take the L and buy them back before they go ITM or get them called away and start selling puts next week?
hai un mercedes
AMD and ATVI dragging is pissing me the fuck off. Let's go already.
Wow yoloing 2k into TSLA 420p’s at 455 was the absolute fucking move. Holy shit. Almost as profitable as my NIO puts
might mess around and name my future son Corsair or maybe Palantir idk
It was me
Smh I thought about buying BA too
What the fuck man, will CRSR and PLTR ever give me a pullback to get on board?  
FUCK
Lets do it. I have a box with wheels we can roll down a hill
So glad I got in at 15...
You should have sold this morning or when it was at 50 and then yolod some of the profit on earnings. Maybe even yolo on calls and puts lol
[deleted]
Hello SEC
Thank you DoD Overlords (BA&PLTR).
buy more
they have until december. this is all the people cashing out on the big jump. have no clue wtf the bottom is though. hopefully this is it
So glad I sold TSLA at 455... knew it wouldn’t sustain any momentum
[removed]
Was only -1 on SQ yesterday, now it shot up im even more negative, I guess I should’ve bought a put cuz this doesn’t make sense
What a fucking SNOOZEFEST today
Hope you pulled the trigger
Special place in hell for FSR for what its done these pass two days in comparison to the EV market.
Webull takes some time to settle cash iirc.
Damn nice play
puts on ccl?
Not once in my life have I played Tesla or any EV and I am so glad lol

I thought I understood price action, apparently I did not

Don't let your dreams be dreams.
Holy crap BA
seriously, who the fuck is buying CCL
Obviously hold.
All you fucks buying calls for Tesla on the top today missed out Nio. Wow
Use some saylic acid.
Retarded analysis. If all of the car companies could make a Tesla motor rn it wouldn't be trading with a few hundred billion market cap
you still can friend
fuck today I am out
Sure!
Other way BA
[deleted]
nope
You don’t need that job anymore
Hehe true
Whos holding PLTR December calls? 👌
got BA calls. theyre certifying the MAX tomorrow supposedly
Will people fly on it?
I'll give you 0.04 for it
NIO is their prestige brand..... the need the price to run up to get more free marketing.  They can make the number say what they want so they have every incentive to pump the hell out of it.
Is there any good reason for SBUX to be coming up on 100?

*puts*
Friendship ended with NIO, PLTR is the chosen one now
Headed to 370 eod you’re about to see parabolic blow off top
*Make AAPL 130 again!!* (so my calls can print)
BA rn!
Coin is only like 10% from ATH lol. Wild
Here we got Tesla let’s go back up

Fubo puts
just say you have a fever and start coughing
Chad's and Becky's already buying tickets.
Mr. Thiel, TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!
I was hoping for bigly gains today. We still have time before close though.
I'll keep a hold on NIO, but I hate the markets right now because this down pressure destroying my gains.
Why ruin a good thing by learning? Aren’t you having more fun not knowing?
I knew my spy puts were in danger, but I really didn't think it would be fucking cruise lines that fucked me.

Et Tu, CCL?
Okay cool... I read this and bought puts.  Already up $4!
Stock up, options down. Still, BA 300C jan
NIO minus the I
12/11 480C safe you think?
Don't know shit about pltr except some it's some tech shit for gubmint

lets go bitches!!!
To home you go!
This isn’t fun anymore
You guys are such fickle pickles.  Pre-market this sub was sucking Elon's dick "all in calls at open", 500 by EOD/EOW.  Now you think tesla is done for good?  Same for Nio last week.  What happened to the diamond-hand big-balled soul of this sub
1k instant deposit on shares only.  Options take like 3 to 5 days.   Been there done thay
LMAOOOO hope you're kidding. If not, options aren't traded after hours, so the price you tried to buy at yesterday was long gone by open today
SPY bears.....
Just wait...
Nope were fucked
Why is BA popping like this?
[deleted]
Sell. Cos this market is fake
Levan polka idk why they are linking you this dudes cover
What's the deal with NAK earnings call?  I thought that was supposed to be yesterday.

nice healthy pullback to ~358, now we can hit 370 before hitting overbought levels and take profits before a real crash

BULLS PUSHED BACK TO 361

YOU ALL SHALL BE REMEMBERED IN VALHALLA
Retard strength on BA 🚀
Wait bears are gay? Or u mean figuratively?
so youre saying theres a chance?
I honestly think we are going to blow past 18 today volume is insane.

Why not calls and make money?
EOW
I chose PYPL and not SQ today🤡🤡😒
Stubborn gambler. I like it
No. VTRS is a separate ticker
You know the answer already😎
737 Max recertificated tomorrow, buy calls $ba
My account is breaking out
Yea fission and not fusion. What are we talking about right now? Also I don't see any reason to put either in a car - just Produce Energy in stable Environment and store with Walter, h2 or batteries
[removed]
Hope to god you sold at open
Can someone please tell me my CCL puts will be ok?
Why am I investing when I could just release an EV ipo, watch it moon, sell everything, pay the breach of fiduciary duty lawsuits and be on my way?
Only holding 10 contracts now, so yeah
paypal what is u doin baby
playing TGT earnings.. my local one is always busy. bought a call. so everyone reverse me for free money
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[deleted]
I cant stop looking at PLTR im going to get sent home staring at my phone.
Yes please!
Anyone use Webull? If I make an account how fast can I get 2 grand to trade with?
Get out of PLTR I’m holding and I never make good trades which means it’ll crater soon. I’m sorry
They're so heavy.
Can’t open spreads or any other uncovered position without trader approval.
That’s what they said about 290, 270, 265.
Hey BigGuy, I love saying that. The truth is that the only true way to learn how to trade options is by studying your losses. Sounds like you have many to study from! If you ever come back to the game, study those losses and your psychological trading profile and thought process. Come back stronger!
I'm back in BABA, there's just no way
Re-Enter baby, tempted to sell for profit now but don’t know if it’s worth to bag hold 💎
Not sure.  I've seen this drop hard in previous earnings
Spy 370 eod calls are free money y’all
Are we memeing VFF? My dead 8 calls for this Friday have life again.
BA. Holy f
Placing trades over the phone? What kind of boomer shit is this
Weak hands, was bagholding for months at $11

I’m losing my life savings on baba
Boomers can't get enough of those sweet sweet BA stocks.
I have some 11/27 18c
PLTR MOOOOON DONT MISS OUT AUTISTS
Stock up 68%
NIO CALLS
how is it possible TSLA hasn't bounced yet
Just bought a single Nio put in case ER has good news.  (They were selling their product at a 15% loss, so this will confuse investors and potentially cause sell off if they are doing well)
>also it looks like the odds of Trump staying president are improving

Lol what are you smoking and how can I buy calls on it
HOLY SHIT THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING. EVEN IF THEYRE BAD NUMBER, THEY CAN FUDGE THE NUMBERS 

ITS CHINAAAAA
PLTR 35 EOD 💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
I think so
Does this pfe spin off merger fuck my calls?
Are you winning?

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jvr81t/_/gcm10rr/?context=1
Is today gonna be another SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP day?
overpriced
Throw in some GME and I'd say you're golden.
Not gonna lie, I’m hurting right now.

🖐🏻💎🤚🏻8 calls for TSLA $500c (-65%)
Sold some pm calls to close over the last couple days.  All up 3x and I'm the last sale.  Lol
the fuck is a ron
Cause I sold my calls for a huge loss
CCL can suck my balls. Absolutely does not deserve to be mooning
BA puts?
cleaned out all my NIO positions, im not tryna get burned by IV, plus earnings is probs already priced in
NIO
We like to cuddle.
Why would people be selling Tesla right before inclusion? Don’t funds have to buy this shit up?
Wow BABA just can’t even go green a ‘singles day’ lmfao
I know it was too ambitious thinking TSLA 500 EOD but what about hovering around 450 EOW?
# LMFAO PLTR on stocktwits

CCL bought NIO on an I.O.U.
Solid TA
Mm buy now
My NIO leaps are sweating for ER today...
So has my buddy and I wanna cry lol. He put me on plug at $14 told me it could dip to $13 so hang on and then it took off
[deleted]
Thank you sir. Hoping that this is the start of it
TSLA 420 EOD? Lol
This wasn’t really FOMO tbh, I sold gme yesterday for nio which was fomo but then sold nio today for profit. I’m back into gme off of DD cause of Ryan Cohen and the hedge funds with stake in gme + the history of gme rising after earnings after console releases + holidays. Before I had January calls but now April makes it in time for earnings
I've been staring at it but never jumped in
Was Bud Fox on the other end of the line?  

Step into the 21st century, you psychopath.
You holding through?
TD is the shit, I don't care what anyone says lol
Why are cruise lines up
You gotta move closer to the sauce.
shut your fukn mouf
Yes plx
We don't do that here
You don’t get insider info if you’re not an insider
I'm up 250% on FUBO calls today so far, it's still rallying!
Still hanging on to my LI March puts because inverse wsb (unless it’s PLTR)
Imagine thinking Chinese government would let NIO miss earnings 🤣
Chinese manipulation
Will Robinhood allow you to sell underlying shares if you've already sold covered calls?
Someone here somewhere prob made bank today cashing in their TSLA 450C then switching it to 420P
Is anyone else fighting the urge to sell everything?
Smart man selling calls against it. Didn't go great this time, but it's a smart move. I've been doing the same thing w GRWG which is just on an absolute tear lately.
Fuck Jack Ma. All my homies hate Jack Ma.
PLTR shook me out the day after ipo
From what decade is this story?
up 40% n sold
TSLA has to bounce soon
keep em
It won't.
Account up 50% today
I’m so close to my portfolio ATH. Sell, or 💎🙌?
I thought it was a picture, scared me when it started changing lol
Fuck yeah. Where can I get info like this? Just looking to ride some coattails

Anyone know what sector is lifting up SPY rn?

Is it legit just cruise lines and airlines? Because that's pretty retarded ngl
Cruise lines abouta have another 10% day 🙄🙄
algos up to something today
Yolo buddy
there we go PLTR baby
Lol I'm an atheist but my pcg prayers were answered.
Nio bulls tell me why you think it’ll have a good ER? No bullshit, what’s your evidence that you’re going by.
Your food budget? Good job.
Anyone know why VALE it's moving up?
Inversed myself of selling BA for TSLA, might do it later though
[removed]
With it reopening and insanely good vaccine news?

I don’t think it’ll pump, but it might hover around the current price for a while
Dump Tesla and buy into the NEW EV KING for the huge rally.

🤩NIO🤩
Had to sell my nio calls this morning

Bought some back. Let’s see how this er goes
Elon giveth and he taketh 🙏
Thoughts on whether TSLA will go up by December? I want to buy the dip.

I really wanna sell, but I feel like I'd be selling at the bottom
these baba bags are getting mighty heavy
Fuck it dawg
You just know the Ghyna commies are going to make the NIO earnings numbers look good.....11/20 FDs are going to print huge.
lmao watch tsla close red
PLTR been draining my balls gloriously since 10am😍
I wish I bought more than one call on PLTR
My TSLA $420p is now worth $420.
What is this? Volume for ants??
yeah why?
damn what is that QQQ dump
No usually it’s banks that hold the calls at the end of the option and they will exercise if the option is 1 itm. Very rare that itm options don’t get exercised
Geez took a stab at the 22.5 at .5 with .5 as the ask and it ran off on me.  Lol
[deleted]
Anyone else holding PLTR 11/27 20c?
BABA hurts me time and time again but I can’t leave. I think I have Stock holm syndrome.
Sorry bruh
The SPAC subreddit got all mad cause they want an EV company and it’s healthcare

Meanwhile Chamath has made people a ton of money on SPCE and IPOB and says it will 10x and is well positioned with the new president looking to expand Medicare which is their only focus right now
yuge sell wall at 17.92 on PLTR
ZM might be cycling out because of vaccine but it’s still gonna have killer earnings with new shutdowns
Once soros destabilizes the dollar. Lol jk
I’ll ride with you brother.
I bought tesla calls after hours and it still hasn’t filled, can someone help me?
Looks like Tesla going back to 420
Bleeeeeed
My CCL puts are so fucked😭 cruises are the new tech
What BA news is coming out soon, this movement is insane
Only if you own PLTR
PLTR wont stay 17 forever!!!
Anyone selling naked calls on nio? just sold a 12/18 75c for 1.85

Was regretting not buying but a few Jan puts on CCL yesterday, might really load up soon
Daily reminder KODK made bigger gains than 90% of the market today.
Which leap can I yolo $7k on ?
ZM weeklies are dirt cheap. People are dumb for not realizing we are going on lockdown again

Sundar pincha be like bro get a pixel.
whoa SBE
friendship with TSLA ended
Give them positions my dude. I got a 100 and need some christmas tendies.
TSLA fidget spinners dropping next week
Back in September, AAPL smashed me to pieces. November, BABA wrecks my account.

Man, these are not the stocks I would have expected to be so crushing. I figured my big losses would be chasing some dumb fucking memes that don't even have products.
Im down 20% on fisker, do i hold? Its a february call
this market is backstopped big time, risk-fucking-on baby.
I hope the next one leftnut pulls will be his last. Dude has enough money to short a stock 5-10% to create a panic idk why sec hasnt investigated him yet
What’s the point of horseshit SPY? It’s literally going in the opposite direction of the market
PLTR taking me higher
Whats your price target?
I'm a simple man. When the RSI falls below 30 I hit buy then sale shortly thereafter. Works till it doesn't.
I do not think mass buying happens during market hours
I just spent half of my budget on BABA calls expiring January. Am I retarded?
Your crayon eating cousin made bank this morning
ORTX, F, PLTR,
how long are we going to pump pltr?
holding baba jan calls, idk whether to sell or not
🤣
PLTR
I had Tesla calls and sold at open. Boys I blew up. Rolling up a fat one. I’m done with options. I’m going long. CASH MONEY BABY😎😎😎
Forever
Woke up to 20k this morning mashallah PLTR TSLA and SOLO
When I ran into this same thing, I canceled the deposit, signed up for the 30 day Gold trial, resubmitted my deposit and then 100% of it was available immediately.
Who is killing the vix and why?
Tesla you ignorant slut
What’s better then sex or money? Being right. Well maybe not better then money...you get it
I bought one 420p
Y do u guys call urself bears? Again new here.
its not even oversold on the day yet. RSI coiling back up rn
cmon PLTR you can do it reach 18
I am a pussy and selling cover call, cus i cannot decide.  Good luck to you.  This is not the end of it.
Solid DD...

gtfo and get banned
BA wtf.. my niBBa
Buying back into ino now 
Feeling INOVIO
Now should I hold NIO calls overnight?
I bought tesla calls after hours and it still hasn’t filled, can someone help me?
The value on them TSLA calls dropped a shit ton.
They needed a 0.1% drop?
[deleted]
What is going on with FUBO
$60
2022
With you brother.
Someone put me on a fuckin winner god damnit
[deleted]
why is tesla still dropping?!?!?!??! I thought it was going to moon another 10% during trading hours
Anyone think ZM calls a good move right now?
AAPL doesn’t even cocktease anymore. Just an old washed up whore at this point 😖
Fuck haha
Guaranteed. They don't even need to get it back in the air, just recertifying it will pump the stock 10%, then another 2-3%, then the selloff/dilution by BA to raise cash.
Other side my friend, bought the dip. Sold at 60% just now . Probably too soon but I’ll try & get back in eod maybe
Pltr added to spy when?
You on crack
And there we go
Oh nice! I was scared to check on my calls after I saw that dip this morning. Pleasant surprise to see it up
No shame in that man, take your time
was so scared this morning i had a short IC TSLA 370/410/420/470. was expecting -2k losses this morning. Sold the put side at open and just closed the call side for p/l day +$600. thank fucking god
350 12/2 anyone
Yeah, wish I hadn’t sold my 19s
Oh Nasdaq what is you doin
SBE will be $100 by the end of 2021. Use the “!remind me 1 year” command.
ahhhhh TD ni99as in the house!!!
Deciding if was going to BA or tesla this morning
Yes
[deleted]
Nah this is WSB. We only play weekly calls so the 5-day high *is* the all-time high.
Why is my gf messaging you
Congrats! Well done and try and learn from your mistakes
How long are we holding PLTR
Buy PLTR while it's still under $18 it won't stay so cheap for long!
lol you didn’t unlock green mode at all
Lol always inverse wsb. TSLA puts at open we’re the move
[deleted]
T212 is literally the only option. Nothing else comes close.
Thanks volume today is super 😴
Chlorophyll? More Like Borophyll!
I’m going to have to hold Nio through earnings aren’t I lol here we go
Imagine buying Tesla after a 12% gap-up when the fundamentals of the company didn’t change 🤡🤡🤡
Why give me a scoop ?
Fringe stonks saving my account today 😎 shout out EOSE
EVERY NIO DIP THIS WEEK CAME BACK UP. 11/20 50c buy right now hold into earning if your nuts hang
FUBU TV up 20%
The broader market is just wild right now.  Yes some stocks are up and others are down but as a whole there literally is no selling lmfao.  If noone sells the market can only go up
Same hahah. Saw it opening night. One of maybe 10 people in the theater no joke.
Correct me if I am wrong - we don't sell shares before 5,6 years?
I put it in yesterday and hasn't been filled. think I'm not gonna print
Nobody tell him

BABA $200 EOW
Mierdas touch.
Buying TSLA puts. Fuck it.
I think hdege funds are selling tesla cuz it got too big
UPWK fans where you at
okay, now that the NIO orgy has spent itself, now we have a barrage of TSLA posts.
ZM still has a market cap of 120b. Just wanted to remind you of that fact
BA will hit 250 tomorrow.

Xi flexing on everybody
Srsly wtf
So it'll go up again?
DKNG finna pop that 45 cherry
I'm still down 38% on this dumb stock. Probably just going to cut losses and dump it into something useful like pltr
nice hit homie
Wtf is happening with CCL? When’s it gonna fall off a cliff?
Shout out to TSLA putting a mufucka back in the game.
Lmao sooo fuckin good
Sector rotation into PLTR
Baba seems like such a good deal at this price, and I wanna get in, but damn it just doesn’t stop dropping 😰
Love it
I’m so glad you convinced me to buy more
i knew i should've inversed the CCL bears and gone with calls instead wtf

You are trying to sell the calls, you need to first find a buyer who’s willing to buy it. And if no one in WSB is autistic enough to buy it at $75, I doubt there will be anyone out there who would be.
That’s what my gf says about her new boyfriend
Fuckkkkk this has to be top 10 from you all time
I made 30 percent on IV expansion thanks for asking
Same boat bro
Did you retards get in? On FUBO?
Spy is holding pretty well I could see 365 eow
Someone on here told me i was an idiot for buying NIO puts, waited until after market close to come back and ask me if i still thought it was the right play lol.

He deleted his comments 🤣
Hey eljunbo809,

Today's my first day on the sub and now I can finally say it. You're a fucking retard.
CCL doesn't give a fuck about the virus, they said we cruising fool
Why the sector rotation?
Literally free money on PLUG
I've been in it for a while now.  Nice to see some action.

Currently have a 10/15 spread for 3/2021
Don’t worry guys I’m up all time now. 

[Update](https://imgur.com/gallery/APgAuDz)
Wow big red dildo on the Nasdaq
It will recovery unless 

Broader market sell offs which drive it down further in which I am sweating
That was great
Upvote me if you think a correction is coming!
$PLTR is an absolute monster. earnings call got me off a tesla/nio day trade play and playing plate instead. 

they have a foot print in Defense, private sector, and healthcare and AI/data management is only going to explode in the coming decades. This thing is an absolute buy and hold.
Who had the balls to buy some TSLA puts?
Aight just got some PLTR 24C 2/19 to go with my PLTR 20C 12/31 from yesterday

Gotta love a matching set
Sad i missed the  TSLA pop because i ignored my inner YOLO demon... but at least my safe PLTR and VALE leaps are killing it.
What are the actual odds BA MAX is recertified? Is it a guarantee or just a rumor
# entire tech sector goes down

# me holding PLTR😎
BABA you ignorant slut
you would have to be a retard to buy NIO now
my 2021 Jan baba calls are down 70%. Should I diamond hand?
I keep waiting for this TSLA squeeze as my calls fade.. :(
Hey TSLA! Wrong way my guy
Tech is dead. Get on with it
Welcome
Lmao
China is antitrust because they were in a *really* bad relationship one time, and it's like, kind of hard for them to trust again. 

BABA doesn't deserve this.
Do your covered calls itm ever not get assigned?
Yep
papa elon. wtf. are you gonna take us to the moon or no?
BABA is fucking me so hard right now. I'm not in weeklies but its still painful
Look at the order book some serious big players
Wrong
Nay said the philistines for they held long calls and did not wish to hear the truth.
how do my 11/20 AAL 12.5P look
How much $ profit y’all up on PLTR right now?
Don't get your DD from wallstreetbets, you retard.
Not a gay 🐻 but bought WMT puts at 149. 🤫
Lol my Tesla 420 puts that I bought at open actually printed😂😂😂
Pltr bois Question Hold $23c 1/15/21 ????
Ty
... I didn’t know people made orders by phone anymore.

In all honesty, why would you even do this versus just using a web or trading platform?
Fuck Tesla’s volatility man
Got out while the getting was good.
REEEEEEEEEEE
CRSR rocket ain't done yet!
[deleted]
AH
Selling put spreads while the premiums are high
Algos driving price lower so fund managers can get cheaper prices
I’m gonna get some a little before close. I feel like earnings hype will kick in from 1-3
Can't believe I managed to grab 50 shares at $14.11 premarket after their earnings report
Wow BABA WTF
So much money mad on those days. It was a hell of a rush too. Rip
whos got dkng calls
What are you buying shares of for the long term?
You think it’ll reverse and go down ? Just keeps going up even with bad news
Holy horse
I found an autist...
Elaborate please? Lol
Brave enough for poooots or you on the other side of the fence?
You know..I don't like to think of myself as a bagholder.

I like to call myself a long term investor. Like warren. LOLLLLL
Could be worse. You could have yolo’d everything in it and be shitting your pants
Finally pulled out of everything. Lost a lot. Learned nothing. I’m done 😂 later boys
I got out of my BA 185 11/27 when it hit 200. Wish I would’ve got in on a call when it hit 193 🤷🏾‍♂️
tesla ? More like trashla  amirite ?
Why did QQQ just fall off a cliff?
I thought I bought the dip. Then it dipped again
[deleted]
Seems like fidelity.

Honestly fantastic brokerage I refer every person that ask me about trades to open an account there and ask those fucks. They are really on it and have the patience of a saint they explained what options were to my grandmother(in detail)  who’s almost 100% in bonds.
Exactly lmao
You're a special kind of retard, not only does your touch make you lose your own money, you make everyone else lose money for just talking to you as well. Well done.
Lmao I did this exact play last close. Up about 20% and watched it die off. Took my exit of shame at breakeven.
Any snacks out there lookin’ tasty?
Congrats you played yourself 🤡🙌💰💎
just bear murder, nothing to see
If you were hoping for a NIO dip. 

*Jack Nicholson in The Departed*

There it is.
I can see that, I’m too much of an optimist probably and see most acquisitions as a good thing
FUCK MY PUTS
So ... when will my Nio calls start to print

Well now. What happened to a summer recovery?
Thiel will eat him for breakfast and then he’ll actually be a lemon
ZM wtf buddy you okay there
Yeah that’s why I don’t want to get in it just yet. It’ll probably consolidate and shit through the atmosphere for no actual reason at 1. It just feels so high
Someone told me CCL put was free money
god my SPY puts needed that... thank you lunch time
Btd bigots
Anyone catching the dip on WBA/CVS?
lol $750 dollars to a broker would be equivalent to a lunch reimbursement rounding error. Exactly 0 people at the firm would notice. I hit sell instead of buy on an order when i sat on a desk and proceeded to lose 100k, i got yelled at but no one really gave 2 shits, and I'm certain where I worked was far less reputable than a retail brokerage.
Selling puts 😎
Im not a professor but I'm pretty sure it's a thing? Idk, most recent example might be callaway the day they bought topgolf
BA recert make RTX go up?
I'm a retard and only looked at the 5 day chart.

HOLY PLTR HULK PUMP ENERGY!!!!!!
7$ EOW!
Wake me up in a year when PLTR announces a 4 to 1 stock split on their $2000 shares
Can't stop moving. I shake it shake it shake if off.
It's good to see honest comments in the reviews for a change
Watching you retards FOMO your money away on Gamestop of all things is exactly why WSB is the best place on the internet.

Citron research gonna pull a paragraph out of their ass from this sub and target pltr 😂
Nio no!
Any of you fags playing RIOT? Is this 2017 all over again?
It happened in September.
the tsla bleed is surprising
"I'm in on Nio because it sounds the least Chinese, and i'm fairly racist". Absolute fucking gold
Yeah but how many mentions do you see..
Big wall at 6
bought PLTR 16c 12/18 yesterday, neeeeeeeeeat
i have made $15 today
Damn
How is this going now /u/Chilton86
# LOL RIP BABA
Get outta here with that shit. We want NIO loss porn!

Jk, congrats and enjoy your tendies as you bathe in the sauce of victory! (Which is honey mustard btw)
Ya thanks I know
Are you selling any? I bought 5400 shares a week ago and am now up like $16k. I see the long term play, but it's also tough to ignore such a jump in 7 days.
Grats. Hope you sold at open
Thinkorswim?
Legit have no idea what moves to make
Glad you noticed 😅
[deleted]
Please do so then it can finally sink for the rest of us
😎
Explain this TSLA Dump. I bought the 18Dec calls last month not a retard to buy calls this morning.
At night
God Bless you.
Ccl just keeps cruising
Feeling like another move down coming on BABA.  11/27p $240 is what I'm holding, just added to it.
You think it’ll have a solid earnings?
It's found support at 360, and the trend of the past month or so looks to continue, probably a good idea.
So crazy how everything else testing ATHs but AAPL struggling to even tease
It’s already up as a stock 10% today. That’s a pretty good day and the market might correct itself coming out of lunch with traders taking profits.
I may have been one of 200 who saw this in theaters. Underrated.
nah not possible
You do you honey
[deleted]
QQQ with the elevator down
lmao did u buy a weekly? u better sell that mother fucker right now
Looking at that order, no one is asking if you know what you're doing.
TSLA RSI and MACD just need a quick reset before we moon again
BABA blowing through Kat last week's lows.

RIP.
Oh I dunno, 7 gaps down in a row..for a company with a premium out look. 70 billion in a day last week 🤷‍♂️
No source of funding as you are unemployed?

Ummm.... Unemployment?

Plow those weekly checks into PLTR

And I don't want to hear about not qualifying.  Covid has been a godsend to you losers who wouldn't have traditionally qualified.
Perhaps them being *slightly* overvalued has something to do with it.
I just made bank on blink charging last 2 days. Tell me you predicted that you bunch of nuts
Did I sell when Tesla hit 462? No, I’m still holding 🤡
PLTR tendies taste delicious
[deleted]
Yup yup
I lost 20k when it faded after the split. Tesla hasent been the same ever since
SPY, your friend QQQ jumped off a cliff will you join?
I Rt had no idea that Reddit existed
I haven't looked at legacy markets the entire day, I've lost all interest.

There's something else that has my attention... holy fucking Chad mode.
Hmmm okay hopefully it dips so I can buy more
[deleted]
Omg pcg stop being such a goddamn tease and go join pltr with a massive upwards movement. I'd like to be able to afford dinner tonight.
I’m out here buying calls on a company under fire from the Chinese government. Fuck it I’ll hold till expiry in January  I need this lesson

Baba bleeding me for weeks
BA gets certified tomorrow. You retards still buying poots when there is literally free money on some of these tickers.
Onwards to glory brother. The Era of Tendies... has begun.
[removed]
Poor wording but I’m planning on holding way beyond that but also curious about short haha
I bought 200 shares at $19. I’ve been very happy with it
Anyone thinking holding thru NIO earnings is a fucking psychopath, your chance of profit between IV crush and not hitting expectations is so fucking slim
I just heard about this stock for the first time 10 seconds ago bruh
"I won't name the firm"

Literally posts a screenshot of TD
YES BABY YES. PLTRRRRRRR LETS GOOO
Suck my dick you loser. Bet your account is negative af. Bout to report you to your place of employment. Got your IP up now.
Fuck you chewy
Jesus fucking Christ the Nasdaq cannot do jack shit with 12k
People also got pussy with Cathy aark for selling. She just took profits and bought the fuckin dip

It’s a documentary on car dealers. The Goods.
Ive been asking myself that for days
WTF BABA
Capital gains theft*
can always exercise the option and hold until baba 320
Tsla earnings day all over again lmao 

Whenever you see this bitch rise, BUY PUTS, you’re only gonna win on this if you bought BEFORE the moon mission. 

Point is, TSLA lost its magic and it never holds :(
KNDI up 18% so far, who else is in on this?
SPY literally only needs like 4 buyers for it to pump lmaoooo
Do your own trades and quit wasting people’s time and energy!!
lol god damn it TSLA, just do a rational thing for fucking once.
Ni romanu!!
Have to say, not bad, it’s catchy
BA!! I needed a win , fuck
Ill kiss her on the lips even after she swallows my load
Lol BA with the casual 5% intraday swing.
Holy shit I’m an idiot
[removed]
Only if you hate money like the rest of us
it can close above 20 if you really believe.
Ight i'm going back to sleep. PLTR is building a solid support for 50 next week, i'll rest in the meantime
I thought we had like 30M.
Lol it really is, maybe this sector rotation ain’t temporary
amazon has the limpest dick in tech
It will pullback again like it always has, so would be smart to buy any future dip on this bad boi
positions
What are you thinking? Let me check it out
Made a nice profit. Here’s what I noticed seems like big players are driving the price up and down but slowly up so don’t do weeklies. Wait for a dip last resistance was ~17.50
Yes sir
ACB has tremendous retard strength mfs think it’s where all their moldy ass $60 eights come from lmao
I think he means to say acquisitions usually eat into profitability in the short term and impact earnings, also depending on what they acquire (if they do) it might boost or hamper investor sentiment so some investors leave until they gain confidence and hop back.
SELLLL TESLAAA
r/options.
Fuck I shouldn’t have fomo’d into Tesla calls
He’s the GOAT 😂
PLTR

LETS GOOO PLTRR
$CRSR sex me up. $U sex me up. I am sex'd
I miss those back to back 15%+ days
What positions you reccomend?
If it trades consistently it won’t have anywhere to go but up on good news, so not a bad thing. Tesla is still a good long term buy imho
Honestly I deserve to lose money for FOMOing into TSLA 🤡🤡🤡
Fuck BABA for real this is dumb af
!Remindme 38 days
45days till I flex on u with my new tsla
Tesla pre split 🥰

Tesla post split 🤢
Thanks for your insight on a company that's up 34% the past week 👍🏼 What's the name of your hedge fund?
sixty-niiiiiine
Can NIO please continue to drop so I can double down on shares ahead of earnings
PLTR. its hot and has tons to run.
Okay guys, a question for those holding tech leaps. Are you’ll holding or selling? I don’t know why, but this market doesn’t inspire confidence 🤔🤔🤔
“Cruisleines surge as the US has surpassed 11 million COVID-19 cases. Health experts warn of humanitarian catastrophe.”
Very.
RKT leaps
go back to r/smallstreetbets retard, come back when you save up for years and lose it all on $SPY puts.
I had the chance to sell for a 30% profit and didn’t, fuck me
I bought PLTR shares in cash at 15, but my account is recognizing it as a margin position while it's journaled.

Is this normal? Haven't noticed before.
This bitch pulling me out of bankruptcy as we speak!!!!
Wish Granted
Go Big or go home!

these days I'm so disappointed if it's not a +50% day for my trading account

I've been spoilt by this bull run
Thanks for making me feel better about my losses TSLA bulls
It normally rallies for a week or 2 so just chill at this point tbh lol
Lol the problem
Isn’t robinhood, the problem is he’s poor
NIO is about to fall off a cliff
PLTR needs to break that 18 wall!

The full priced model 3 is now only $37,999 so the $35,000 doesn’t really make sense. I bought the $35,000 model in March, but if the other one was only $3,000 more back then, I would have bought it.
Will we get a travel dump?

NIO EARNINGS CALL 7:00pm EST. 1 of 3 things can happen. I can sell my NIO call and lose a small amount or wait through earnings and either lose a lot more tmr or profit.

By reading some of the comments,

Some are enjoying their tendies while others losing tendies and then there is One group of legends still trying to figure out the play :)
Posted that I picked up some 11/27c $20 on PLTR yesterday, they called me a mad man...   XD
Baba calls are in absolute shambles, don’t know if I should go all in on calls rn
300 would be super cool too tho...
VALUE CHARGE 💯💯
I bought TSLA guys, my picks are stage 4 cancer at this point. I caused the SPCE drop yesterday and I’m looking at ZM for my next play
So pissed I didn’t buy it at 9. I had a limit at 8 and was sure it would drop there and it fucking didn’t and then didn’t wanna fomo well fuck
Maybe not that part. Didn’t expect it to go this high.
fucking BA
LETS GO PLTR TO THE FUCKING MOON
Yessir. Just a silly lotto.
that's exactly why

as soon as it dumps a point, it'll just suddenly rocket right the fuck up above its high
Tesla puts be printing always inverse retards here
PLTR melt up. BUY BUY BUY
GRWG 😍
wad up with Kodak
Where are my NIO technical analysts at?  We averaging down here or what?
> They implement a special cybersecurity team and also involved 3rd party support.

things like that are not just implemented and boom. its gonna take 2-3 years to actually implement deep security processes. so no its not implemented tee hee
Soo pltr..
uhh wtf NIO it's ER day!
Get your PLTR 1/15 20cs boys
Yessir! Just sold mine cause I was sketched out it would dip, my calls were a bit high
🤡🤡🤡

bought tsla shares at 443 damn it's a race to the bottom now huh
*The Ring has awoken, it’s heard its masters call.*
SNE still rock solid at $90 while everyone else suffers.
Surely TSLA is value around now
Jack3d?
You doing any leaps on PLTR?
Too bad I bought such a faggy d I’m making no bread on this Tesla put
Feeling that FOMO on FUBO...at least PLTR feeding me good
!Remindme 45days
Why does the SPY graph look exactly like the NIO graph? Lmaooo
lmao
Wtf are shares? Were you born sometime in the decade  or so following the Second World War by chance?
tsla C aint printing
People were laughing at Larry Ellison for buying 3 million TSLA shares in 2018 because he was down a few hundred million at some point. 

Now he made billions.
wtf is CCL doing?  Die bitch

Die TSLA - got puts

Run JD, PLTR, PINS !!!
Your ccl a put?
[deleted]
Bought at 5.05 sold at 6.8 today happy with it waiting for the dip to dive in again
If nio goes up 20% AH. I will climb the Statue of Liberty naked
The good people of Lordstown, OH work very hard to produce a high quality product. I suggest everyone by shitloads of RIDE.
What's your position?
Correct. 200% is minimum leverage required for proper diversification.
Of course you did lmao fucking cuck
Shit might print, dog. Nice.
I feel like the PFE and MRNA vaccine EUAs are coming at 4 PM today.

Good luck =)
What's wrong with ZM. Huge freefall.
Hope u lose all ur money chasing tsla u no vision simpleton
That resistance exists for months. It will start moon when antitrust news come in if they are not too bad.
Will metals follow shitcoin?
trying to sell my CCL 17p but no one is buying it /:
Lost on Tesla feel like a idiot was up on it on that 460 pump and didn’t sell

Hell naw I’m buying December puts every day. If this shit breaks down I’m gonna retire to Bangkok where I hear you can live like a king on three dollars a day
"I'm a retard, chief."
I just show em my transaction history. No words needed.
TSLA over 450 is a fool's errand
I retract my grotesque comment, luck's a factor too. All about timing
No... I've been holding calls for 1/15 that are useless. I do wish you luck though!
Do it. You won't
Y
Just give Citron a call they can fix it for you
Did you write the first review??? “After sucking my neighbor cock until he cums in my mouth, he bought me this. Its amazing, im exploring the bottom of sea bikini.”
this is why u use Robinhood retard
Link?
Spy is so fucking gay
Fuck robinhood for scalping my orders
yeah but when?
wsb's crystal ball
it’s not difficult to look back in time and cherry pick any scenario that fits my narrative. that’s why people exist that think the earth is flat
I am still holding my 16.5c's I think it has the volume to break through 18 today but I can not blame anyone for taking profits on that run!
I tried to scalp TSLA calls at open and cut losses pretty quickly. Glad I did.
Anyone else buying this PFE dip? Seems like too thick a dip not to go in on
Good game bro.
just when you thought the boomer stocks were down.....
Im waiting for an opening to buy those. 25C
and the process begins again...
TSLA poots free money
Explain please
seriously just wait till eod of a red day. never buy puts again
UP 40% since the first autist mentioned it.
Presupposes you can afford one.
The questions she just asked Zuck had to be the most smooth brain level questions today.
BA moon
My retarded as FOMO of TSLA is hurting my PLTR
I call bs
TSLA 12/4 410 calls. I'm holding today, going to be a crazy few weeks on trying to figure out when to sell.
They ran up hard before earnings.
Bruh it got spammed for a reason. Super low volume. Prob a pump n dump
I have 11/20's and 11/27's, it just feels retarded seeing them go up. Stay level, whatever I guess, but pumping seems absurd
You have to enable Robinhood's Platinum Plan to see them.
Turbo tax doesn’t talk so I’m good
Jacked to the tits on my preqorkout.

PLTR, don’t fick me.
Weekly 30s!!
I won’t allow myself to restructure until January 1. I’m hoping like he’ll for this vaccine to delay for a while.
NIO weeklies dead huh
I consider it an options win, otherwise why not just buy and hold.  
Sometimes I'll use it to lower my cost basis if my underlying tanks and I'm so far OTM, just to get a bit more premiums.
I feel so sorry for those people that tried to ride TSLA this morning.

What we thinking of vtrs
> affordable housing

You gotta design a virus that kills landlords if you want this.  An old landlord that dies, just passes the property to a younger landlord.  You also cannot kill chinese people who own half this country while still being in china.
Ah, that old chestnut.  gl.

Boeing red to green. 👍
well

https://ibb.co/k9T0zP4

there is plenty of algos wanting to buy/sell so "volume" isn't a problem just so you know..

/NKD
RAIL going Parabolic!
Tax write off baby
Quarter mil of NIO on robinhood, asking for help on a 1.5k covered call.... Yep you definitely belong here.
I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure it is 500 companies. It's like 506 holdings because of class a and b stocks like google
I'm never buying puts again
dont be a gay bear they said..... stocks only go up..... 

cries in TSLA
They have their shit together enough that shares will do well in the long run but playing short-term options seems like folly - unless you're hoping they announce some partnerships.
Why
[deleted]
You’re a smarter man than me. You’re exactly right. Every fuxking day it does the same shit. I should take the L and move on. Could’ve fomo’ed into PLTR by now
No day trades

How do you guys go about explaining your losses to your accountant

Edit: Asking for a friend.
doesnt exist on the chain?
RIDE is the next Tesla
its going to move alright but just not in the direction you were hoping for
Im gambling, tomorrow morning will be the show. Big moneys for me. Or just a little moneys for me. Cant fuck it up
I can't align on the last sentence - the financials are way out of whack, they will report a loss outright next Q I think (and have an operating loss ongoing up til now) and I do not see the 400B$ market cap as sustainable - as I type it is tanking, could well give up all of todays spike and more before close...but 11/20500c keep getting bought!?
More importantly why isn't NET following FSLY?
Good thing I decided to unload my entire account into BA leaps yesterday..
GE don’t stop please 8=D
Can we get an absolute blood bath tomorrow? Pull the fucking rug already, please, thanks

bro this is me, i hope it doesn't run up too far past my 12/4 18 Calls
Bruh can we get a GRWG pullback please? Up almost 40% in a week. I’m trying to get back in who wants to tank this thing with me real quick?
Same
Why
I definitely don't think I'm smart, I would just figure that one day would be green at least!
PLTR that’s what I did. Fomo 1k in calls for PLTR after taking profits on Tesla, wish I just sold at open wish me luck
dude i'm still waiting for my fucking TSLA Short Shorts
Pussy
Bloomberg says TSLA is screwed once it’s listed.
[removed]
Xi and the boys wont let you down. Diamond hand that shit my man.
17.5c 11/20 and random 1/15/21cs
Despite all my rage TSLA still stuck in the same ass range.
You too
Hope so. But there's been fair resistance all over between 257-262 so it will take a heck of a push to break out
Poor Tesla. Gone are the days of crazy short squeeze/gamma squeeze. I dont think she is going to run like she used too.
tsla was bleeding me had to jump ship. onto pltr
I’m thinking people are profit-taking on the news. Give it a few days/weeks to consolidate before the index-inclusion squeeze.
Should I cop more PTLR Calls? 1.5k yolo?
cost basis lowered
Why r my spy put spreads down 7 percent bro
[deleted]
Cashing out of TSLA
That’s how you know it’s manipulated.
Damn that bitch is pumping harder than pltr
pltr red eod today? from a 10% run up? 

tough one
I can only get so erect!
Sell under market value
I made some good money with shares
NIO coiled up for either +/- 20%
I consider it profit.
If you post or screenshot, always sell. You know this...
LOL I got in 2 months ago and I'm finally in the money as of today
Your saying a new acquisition would trigger a rug pull? Can you explain that?
The bear literally went tits up.
PLUG giving me massive erection
Ffs let ZM break 400 retards
PLTR better not stop, this bitch buyin my new house
No worries. Well just have ice cubes for dinner until next paycheck.
BA bears really fucked, managed to shake me out of my calls this morning gg.. you deserve it
also best of luck
Buy calls! You want to be in the market b4 stimmy hits
Rip those that bought Tesla at 455
Don't pretend that's the future you don't want.
Sold @ $440 to open $PLTR position.
Cashed out my 16.5c on PLTR, was a great run this morning but feels like the top for the next few days at least. Might buy back with some more long term calls if it dips
CCL has me limpin lmao
January— I have some debit spreads I yolod exp this Friday for earnings, but my big call is 1/22 at 60c. Quick short gains for short term, long road for leaps bro
I feel attacked
I kind of want to go kndi land
Annnnnn deeennnnnn?
RIDE showing lots of strength gapping up again
Yep
No, but we’re likely to melt up past 370-380 at least
It bought/sold exactly at the times I needed regardless of volume, but hey, its ok, you have /ES and it's working for you, so either way.
When the boomer stocks blnk and solo making you tenties while everyone is crying for tsla... im confused
Word. If i can make a little bank on this bad boy ill be set up to try and make some real money

Tesla lost its magic
When ?
Cant even sell these nio calls that im 50% in
When you sell covered calls that expire do you consider your cost basis lowered or do you consider it an options win?
Feels great. Up $6k
If you had to ask me I think Tesla is gonna remain flat because funds have until Dec 21st to buy into Tesla. They are smart and aren’t going to buy it in all at once and rocket the price. They have algos slowly buying into it without rocketing the price. We might see a bullish trend but it’s most likely not gonna have a 10%+ single day.

So TSLA puts was the play!? 😒😒😒
Yea I might trade mine for some longer dated ones

My plan is to sell if it hits 18
I legit don't understand how it looks like it's about to fly


Sorta looks like it's about to take a fat Metamucil shit
Out of day trades, guess I’m holding NIO thru earnings 😂
RUN straight up
So, Tesla melting back down. Time to get in before the pump when it actually lists?
MSFT and FB have always been tech laggers, absolute dogshit stocks in all of tech compared to the likes of AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, Netflix etc.. Can’t believe I chose to baghold these laggers over AAPL

Do you realize that stats are not supposed to be taken THIS literal? Do you realize that if a statistic is over 2 years old its considered out of date? Do you let statistics dictate how you live your life? I don't buy into statistics like most people do. I look at them like tools that are able to recognize trends but it never goes past that. Yes I do realize everything your saying but do you realize WHY? 

I'm not getting into my personal life on here but some key points ill divulge. 

1. I invested in apple after the ipod was released but before the iPhone. I remember reading the rumors about Apple making an all in one device. 


2. Since 2015 I've gotten 20% back a year at the bare minimum. I do not sell a stock if I haven't gotten at least a 100% ROI. 


3. I was a produce manager when I started trading. I guess you can call it luck but almost everything I've invested into has made me money in some way. Right now I live off dividends and do whatever the hell I want.

Who got TSLA puts at open for the meltdown? must feel good
There is no Space X; != SPCE

Shares?  

Sir, this is a casino.
I bought calls a month ago and decided to forget about them until next year.
Lol I bought calls at 17.4
S&P isn’t always exactly 500 companies
How so?
hold it in...might be a fart, might be diarrhea. Either way...it will be a relief
80% gains on my 16 PLTR calls, this is a good one
Take a look at the volume though.
I love how SPY is a market index and doesn’t even follow the market HahahAhahHahA fuck this
Yeah not surprised
Up 70% in a month. Priced in. Will drop.
guess who bought at the top
BABA found resistance, it will start to moon tomorrow.
Honestly I hope that China goes all EV with NIO and XPENG.  I don't hold  any positions for them ... but removing a billion internal combustion engines will do us all wonders.

And the my villainously planned  EMP attack with fuck them.
They are announcing it right before TSLA gets added mid December
Imagine not holding nio through earnings
Spy looks like it’s about to take off but I don’t know if I want to buy calls at this point..
i think 18M is the biggest bankroll i've seen in this sub's history.

Unless it hits close to $50 by EOD I’m holding this shit.
Ok fuck it. I’m selling TSLA and NIO calls. My weak hands can’t handle this shit

This market is a thick-tongued retard when it melts up like this. No rhyme of reason. Just melting up like it's collecting carts in the super market parking lot
Who the fuck told me it would be a good idea to buy TSLA at 450ish
360 I’m out
Unlikely, especially with all those science-denying conservative/republican senators there. Why do you think she is dumb?
Thank you for this work of art

Long Tesla 420 put.....
I got in yesterday at 15.5 and sold today at 17.81. I'm just looking for another ticket to ride :)
Gotta inverse
I bought at 16. 7 last week. Can't see it falling below 14/15. Depends how long you'll hold. In 5 years now is a good price
Went all in on 2023 30c. Now just to sit back and watch
You laugh... Pacemakers in the 60's were mini fission reactors.
just sold my tesla puts, def left sum money on the table but i’m not sad abt it bc ik tsla retard strength can activate anytime, i can see tsla being flat tmr
that's another reason forgot to mention that but it's more of a theory than anything really justifiable
It was always puts bro.

CRSR with its daily event of setting another ATH
Good idea. I'm hearing big tings bout there "NIO day" later in the year..or is it early Jan I forget
Diamond hands my bear brothers

We shall win the day
Even with Tesla being included in the S&P it’s still gonna be pinned at 420
holding 11/20 NIO calls...lets get another run up
They don’t get added until 12/21 so, yeah, no.
Get in on NVDA during this dip! Earnings tomorrow. Gaming is at ath! Watch what happened to NTDOF

Now put it into PLTR LEAPS
Thanks man, never done this before. I appreciate you.
I really think the massive pump will happen after hours.
Yes with forward momentum. It should start moving downward to 220.
Probably won't but I saw this pullback coming a mile away though
Tesla really came out with that limp dick today
Everyone knew this when they announced
It will be good if tsla doesn’t close red tody lol
Brooo, this shit is legendary
Name drop?

8% = rookie numbers and anyone who doesn’t judge a stock based on an evaluation of the company’s core product is a fucking idiot
Jesus, what you buy?
How long to hold PLTR? I have 12/18 and 1/15 $20c’s. Looks more promising than any of the retard strength ipos like SPCE, NKLA, and NIO.
Yes.
NIO & TSLA puts printing so hard 🐻🐻🐻🐻
Why have All the EV stocks other than my NIO been mooning for the past few days!!!!
Keep going bro
Nio estimates are very high.  Somehow they will beat tho
I really hope none of you are buying SOLO right now...

Good luck with that IV

Ok bought 10k pltr shares. Pump it up
SPCE fomo made me over $10k earlier this year
Thank the heavenly gods for that NIO bump
You had my curiosity, now you have my attention
Just printed!
Why does FORM have like no volume, it’s been doing pretty well
They still have runway to burn; their MACD-avg is still significantly higher than their MACD-value
Autistic license maybe
This Fubo shit is crazy, every day I watch it keep zooming up while I'm sitting here without any
I spent more on dinner last night, what the fuck
Haha that video cracks me up every time
@bagholdCapital on Twitter said he's holding til 30+. And hes legit
It would have been a good idea, for sure.
Take your profits of $80 before I jump in and ruin everything.
Fuck you MSFT
Wake up BABA you POS. You already have resistance here, just start moving.
All varies based on the state you live in and the amount you sell
So plug calls
Sell bro
IV is so high they will get burned
TSLA boomering again, PLTR straight 🔥 though 👌
VALE gang. At least it's up today.
Incorrect on the baby pump. If you judge your stock choices on how the car “looks” you’re a dumbass
The stock closed at $25, they priced the new shares at $22.50 so of course the stock dropped 10% overnight. They opened at about $22 and I picked some up just to try to make up the damage on the recovery. So far the stock is up to $22.30
Wondering how much profit taking we’ll see EOD and AH for PLTR.
[deleted]
SPY only goes up.   379c 11/27
sell
Bro you could get a spicy ramen and still have 15 cents left.
Yeah okay NIO buddy gonna need you to *try* harder
Mm it continues to gap up post market cause there’s no reason for it to go down? Big institutions just getting started buying
NIO back to $35 after hours🥰
how low can RXT go. it's a mission
Anyone got a $700 yolo
Get a job lol
ill sell you the puts pussy
Any other RKT bag holders in here? Getting real sick of this shitstain stonk
PLTR 30 EOY did i say it right?
Just how many FOMOd into TSLA at open.  Show yourselves!
Why did I think Tesla would
Not fuck me ?
Dear Diary,

I’m not good a day trading, never stray away from theta gang again

Xoxo, retard man
i am close to having everything ITM now we almost about to cream
$461. It’s gonna end up flat as fuck to kill off retail buyers selling on the dip , and then whales are going to come in and swoop them shares up till we’re back at today’s high
Mid December
21st of December
PLTR just gonna keep chugging aint it
I posted alot of comments giving rationale not to buy. Hopefully I saved some idiots who put market orders at open.
Uhh can I get a NIO pump before earnings my brothers
Elaborate? She’s an insider trader so she looks pretty smart to me
Good call... can I make it a meal or should I slow my roll?
Imagine buying nio puts before their earnings when they’ve been beating expectations 🤡
Thank you pltr my account is almost at 1 k again cuz of you baby you don’t need a lot to make a lot!
DCA at the absolute bottom. I went from 3 contracts to 20 lol
that's the price EVERY new trader must pay, then you either gotta decide whether to learn from your mistakes and keep trying or just give up and go back to being a professional netflix watcher
Wake up BABA wake up wake up out of yo sleep!!!!
This is a broke man grasping at straws trying to comeback from a shot year of bad picks
For all the aal pumps and dumps it's basically been flat for three months. Only down .2 since August
Ghetto call credit spread on AMZN

You guys get NETE?
NKLA>ENRON
TSLA only ever goes up.
🤡
Dude. Hold that shit. Youll be rich
> Not redefining it, it's the history of money.

It's obviously not because we call fiat "money." So the word "money" has a definition. Hell, fiat currency first started to be used in the 11th century in China -- undoubtedly those morons wouldn't have known that, or cared because it didn't support their cultish definition of words.

> Bzzzzt, that's exactly how this works. What the fuck do you think the bonds are? It's debt! The Federal Reserve issues Treasury bills, which become the debt the govt owes.

Bonds are debt, yes. But the OMB (the Office of Management and Budget) sets the proposed budget for the year, which includes the level of national debt. Not the FR.
I want to know how often FOMO has worked out for you all. It has never worked for me....
Normally yes but I dont think that will work here. The IV which is implied volatility of the options is at 20% which means if the price moves less then that after earnings today both calls and puts will be crushed and worthless.
👌👌👌👌
[deleted]
Which call?
SOLO cars look like a shoe with wheels. Or a clown car sawed in half.
F that. Depreciating asset. Rather hold the shares
hold
Trading 46p rn, in a downward trend, possible reverse wedge. Expecting dump soon
Haha yep. 8k shares deep so far
200 dude what did you smoke this morning
Interesting, unfortunately I don’t have data for NKD so I can’t trade it unless I pay extra per month.
Dude... Go hit YouTube or Google. You're asking basic fundamental questions that you should already know before doing this kind of trade.
now you'll make max profit, or just roll it
“Dont fucking dance” 

Bitch pltr making me nay nay

when does tesla actually get added to sp500
Bro sell that and roll out longer wtf
What about 50?
Diane Feinstein has to be one of the dumbest senators. How is this clown still in congress?
show me your puts
Why pick just get calls in both
I bought a TSLA share yesterday and sold it for a grand total for 90 cent profit, 

IM FUCKING EATING TONIGHT BOYS
My 1/15/21 calls might just work out omg
Probably a decent long term hold
It seems so unfair, LOL.
Not alot of people are buying but literally no one is fucking selling so it'll just continue to creep up lol
The only thing I’ve seen screamed in this sub that’s consistently right is “follow the trend, retard”. It was dumb to buy puts all summer, it was dumb to buy calls in Sept and Oct. November clearly wants to be green. Stop buying puts on indices.
Oh my gosh tesla only up 8% wtf.. my ass hurts ... I’m not making millions 

That’s how you sound
Blacked out PLTR right on the driver side door
80% of this sub last night apparently

Gotta buy you won't have them that cheap ever!
Incorrect
There's no way I'd be getting PLTR calls right now.  You're crazy.  There will be massive profit taking EOD.  Wait until the morning.  Just a tip.  You will not making money FOMOing when it's 10 points up and this frothy.
This aged very well...

Brown homie
I know i'm incredibly lucky. I'm retired at 45 and have a comfortable life. 

My parents came to the US when i was 5 with their life savings of 10K with no english skills. My dad was a housepainter and palm reader to survive his first few years here. That's where my obsession with money and "it's never enough" came from. So my story really is a fairy tale that few would believe. 

I view life pretty cynically. Sometimes I feel like we're all living in a simulation. I'm too obsessed with markets. Even when I wasn't trading, I'd see markets up or down and feel FOMO. I'd think, wow, I would've made X if i was trading and bought that dip. I'd feel depressed as i saw markets go higher and higher without me in early 2020. FOMO! Then markets crashed with covid and I was happy for a couple days. Then as puts started printing 100X, I felt FOMO again. It never ends. 

So if you do this for too long, you'll truly never escape. My dream is that the stock market is banned and ceases to exist so i can move on. Fridays and saturdays are the best, as markets really don't exist. The Sunday rolls around and I'm back in stock market prison. 

&#x200B;

I think that's why we all love coming to WSB. It's like our AA meeting. We are all addicts. We all need help.
Nio 44 Call for next Friday.. currently up +505... Hold or sell
Any 💎 👏 Vale gang still out there?
PLTR doesn't want to alert too many investors so it will do 10% every day instead of 50% in one day
Damn it really does take money to make money. Where do I find money?
I'm just a bit terrified it shits the bed post earnings then I have to sit with the shares for months hoping it recovers.
Hold strong! News next week!
say it with me boys PLTR 18 EOD
RIDE 🚀🚀
Wow, that was more retarded than buying OTM 0DTE options
No meme stocks.

Not enough red.

Does anyone know when FVAC will become MP?
ok bought spy puts. should be around $365 by lunchtime guys

Ahahahahaha, wtf is this innumerate bullshit. I call satire.
Who gives a shit about making money when the govie has you on child support?

Do whatever the fuck you want, while you can🤷‍♂️
Did "Sell the news" hit us TSLA Bulls 

🤷🏻‍♂️
Proud to have bought the top on TSLA again
Buy one get one nugs at MCD right now. Gotta be careful with all your gains.
PLTR bros what color lambo we getting?
dude. thryre safe. worst case scenario you get assigned a share if it moons. buying that back was really dumb
[removed]
390-410
Thinking of doing the same. Could deploy the capital elsewhere. 

Why dd u sell though?
We're at support levels
Literally get the fuck outta here
Anything under $100
Time to check back in with Vale gang.   Ask this talk about EV has pushed Vale back into relevance.  It's already climbing without significant news.
The problem I see is that the bulk of the population won't get a vaccine until next summer and that also assumes lasting immunity
Dead
Upvote if you losing on tsla fomo calls like me. Need to know we're not alone in this.
SBE...shares or calls??
Strength in numbers.  We are the autistic army
I’m with you need, to feel something in this void
My boy lost like 10k on them. On shares.
My gf is taiwanese they like their semi conductors so i'll trust you. 1/15/21 $5 calls.
Tesla gods let’s rise from the ashes and hit 500 by Friday!
[deleted]
If he needs more than the 2k the gambling is a smart bet lmao
Not complaining at all but no idea why FSLY and SQ are up 5% today. Any ideas?
SPY must be stopped
I’m not gay but I’ll have sex with Peter thiel
thinking i might sell TSLA if it gets to 440 and go somewhere else
I think it won't go under $17 or $17.50 ever so my advice is to buy while it's still cheap.
it’s a long ass play
"Everything goes down after earningz" 

There isnt one. Just people being fearful and thinking earnings are cursed
just sell a 395 put now. IV is very delicious
I am on TD and TD Ameritrade has high margin requirements yes, but You are on ?? So yours are different, I need $8000 requirement for TD Ameritrade for /NKD, but I need even more for /ES!! so Ofcourse it's better to trade /NKD!
NIO puts gang? wya
Good entry points for buying PLTR shares? $16.8?
Who is stupid enough to buy it?

Lol Kandi is totally a stripper name
Wow value stocks are catching up quickly to tech. Tech may be dead
Nio bb
You belong here. Welcome, dumbass
Yes
Nice good move
You son of a bitch I’m in.
I'm afraid of spacs, to many scars.
Where the Fuck is the lunch time sell off
CCL stop it
😞
Shut the fuck up about SOLO, the cars are ugly as fuck and 8% is a baby pump.
Get out of TSLA while you still can. 

&#x200B;

this is not "A slow bleed so people can take profit" it's a slow decline trading your liquidity/buy orders for their exits in a controlled manner. Once people notice it'll be a flood. Then factor in NIO's soon to be manipulated beat and "increased interest from Chinese consumers" TSLA will be 200 by christmas
[deleted]
Now upgrade PLTR price target pls
🤬
No. Of no one buys, there's no $1400
Those r used to spoof midpoint value during accumulation. Volume only averaging 1-2m. Don’t look too much into it. Fundamentals always wins.
I mean yeah it’ll be a lot stronger compared to this year if we’re getting a vaccine in the next 6 months
When are we exiting the market and moving into the stay at home stocks? I say post Thanksgiving we see the big dip - gonna slowly liquidate close to and after
There is no happiness. No matter how much my stonks go up, I am depressed that I didn't buy more.
Me neither
As one does
You’re literally buying the pump.
My anus is not liking Tesla right now
Fizz and Bynd . Buy in Bynd, free money!!!! Fizz been free money for the last 3 months
Come on ZM. You’re so close to melting down
Options flow on Swaggy Stocks is very bullish for BABA but it hasn't brought the price up. I'm hopeful though. I have a month for a real good pump.

No everyone definitely said “we will collectively fomo into TSLA calls at open and trigger an infinite gamma squeeze”. WHERE IS THE SQUEEZE?!
it got downgraded to Neutral from buy on Oct 30th. I think its in the FSLY/ZM/NET tech type with pullbacks before launch
Wtf is this pussy shit
Doesn’t even have to go down, just the IV crush will likely be painful even if the underlying goes up
im gonna make sure you get a look at my end of year post, when you see the chart of steady consistent gains across 1k plus trades its kind of hard to argue. btw, i took a look at your post history and you def did not spend 25 years on wallstreet. if i had to guess you are probably 25 years old and live in the UK
VALE finally taking off after mine expire worthless, as you do.
Jesus. 140. Its going to explode
I bought NIO at 35. Im have a large safety net at this point
BUY PLTR DIP U FUCKS
70k
Average prices ?
Thank you! I’ve never done any options before. Just buying and selling shares.
Imagine being 30 and having erectile problems. Puts on your gf’s vagina
It bounced right off the gap from Friday.
You can delete everything after the ? and the rest is just tracking info
I sold my shares today
i was strongly considering going in, then just got a bad gut feel that it was gonna dump at open, so i stayed away from it and went with pltr
When he slides himself inside of you...
So that’s it for TESLA? Lol
430
Should had inversed WSB and bought Put. I got cucked.
I was up BIG on TSLA this morning and then magically it started to fade. Very strange.

STOP THE COUNT!!!
TSLA being added Dec 21.  Algos will drive it into the ground so funds can buy the shares for cheap.  They're not gonna pay millions in premium.
CRSR volume growing. Might see a big pop soon
I swear if Tesla goes back to 420 I’m never buying it again
So is TSLA gonna just keep getting fucked or
Wishful thinking lol
And 300k deaths by the time Biden takes over easy
Oh get ready for more fun to come
Shhhh don’t make it a meme stock
Ye buddy.
lmao all those Twitter traders tweeted about buying TSLA calls at open. 

**NEVER LISTEN TO ANY OF THEM!**
Made $2k on TSLA today where do I stick my profits
They are pretty safe unless the stock tanks. You're capped at gains so you can lose profits if it skyrockets though.
TSLA just gonna kiss $420 then Space X rocket up to $500
Yes I lost all my money earlier in the year trying to make a comeback
Up 20%😎😎one at a time ladies
KNDI!
sumo is almost nearly the same company as PLTR....just needs PLTR volume
Unfortunately you need to draw cards, read the rules. You said uno, you didn’t shout it

Best decision of your life, PLTR is here to stay.

All in on SOLO or too late?
Spoiler alert, he wont.

Covid go up, PLTR track covid, uhm stocks go up? Nothing Is stopping this train
Literally tried telling people the winners were those who bought YESTERDAY.
I agree 100%
I posted earlier to not mess with it today but I'm sure no one listened
Damn the asks on these calls still high asf even if Mark to market is cheeks
take the pdt L
Are you all missing the solo pump?
AMZN killed my RAD calls in cold blood.
Let’s get it

Probably getting shorted, dealers selling shares to stay delta neutral tbh
Who else is still holding TSLA? I might just wait until tomorrow to sell
don't fuckin jinx it

At least it's not TSLA
How much are ppl down on their Tesla calls this morning?
Boomers buying cuz of vaccine news even though cruises aren’t gonna start sailing until the middle of next year. I’m holding my 11/27 puts, I feel like it’ll dip unless someone else announces vaccine results

see, they look oddly close don't they!?  so just trade /NKD instead and make $25 per tick instead of $12.50 on /ES only..
PLTR trying to break the $18 wall everyone hop on in and buy while it's still cheap.
I’ve got 200 shares and a few 11/27 17c
Lmao
lmao actually go read about it and see how theyre applicable in every important problem in the world right now
Thanks, I tend to make short plays and get out somewhat early once I can take solid profits. This has saved me big time and made me miss out on huge gains (NIO). Going to let this one rideeeeeeeeeeee
Every time I think I’ve finally figured out the market, and I’m a Chad day trader, I get wrecked. Thank god this is just one call. I’m virgin theta gang and that’s ok
Hope Nio keeps bleeding till close for the extra bags when I load up.
I’m gonna go with no. Better luck next time
So was Tesla 

Trade with your balls not your brains 😤
I put SBE on my watch list for a swingy boi yesterday, not sure if it was because of you or not. Wish I had bought in!

Apparently no one wants to buy shares of Tesla ......
Bc it’s already up 2,600% on the year

Immediate ban.
The total should add up to 200%
It looks like everyone is tryna get out at $5/share from the level 2 data. 75k shares bid vs 610k sell
Took my profit from one  company and bought one share of tesla one fucking share not make it 80% of my portfolio smh
Nope under $20 is a bargain
Holy fuck this market is more retarded than me

THIS IS THE GREATEST SHOW
Down 40% intraday after starting +15% lmao

My brain is fucked.

The only thing that was rigged this November was the fucking market.
"Losing Money" isn't the way to look at it.  Look at their revenue estimate which is $1B for this year.  They're spending to grow to make more.  Being profitable isn't priority at their stage.

What the fuck is Tesla doing
Fucking Acorns! I mean Robinhood!
Nice lol glad you at least got something to make up for it 👍
PLTR is about to rip again! Get in quick!
Fear
It’s mostly gay bears.
I think he misphrased that and is saying the only way you lost money is if you bought at ATH and sold at the dip which happened after. That dip has consistently happened after every time NIO rallies. Earnings might be a bloodbath though

Exactly. You could wake up one day to a 7 point rip and then it’s off to the races. Stay strong.
DDog calls
But I bet swiping the buy order up released lots of dopamine.

Hey you could have blew it all on coke so theres that
Bro shut the fuck up 🤐 let's just get this money quietly
but they only go up?
I only invest in what I plan to hold long term, no quick cash here... oh no, they found me.... i dunno how but they found me... run Marty RUN
This comment was made in May, June, July, August, September, October and November
I sat on the sidelines for a long time with TSLA and today bought some calls... reminded me why I sit on the sidelines with TSLA
Always a fucking V
This is the way
I was told fomoing into TSLA calls at open was the move.
Just like apple and android people will wait for Tesla to make it if they actually want it
Some retard on here posted about TSM the other day and then my retarded ass bought some calls ATH. Fuck, I’m stupid.

Vix steady tanking
bro if you just bought and it dipped 10 cents it isn't the end of the world you clown
You
What do you guys think spy finishes EOY?
idk i have the same ones and was up early this AM shouldve took the profit then. No reason it's up today at all
I have some blink and ride that I bought yesterday and looking for some new plays
FINALLY PLTR
How much.. I have a 282.5C exp 11/27 might hold until worthless.
Positions?
PLUG Calls down 87% at open officially green 😎
I still don’t think it’s too late for PLTR, very undervalued with what they do for the gov.
 they prob have the same question.

Here we go!!!
What’s up?
[deleted]
Zkin anyone 👀
Bought VXX calls, I always get tucked by VXX but never learn my lesson so let’s see if this actually works this time
Fuck u TSLA

I think some of you are watching PLTR price at a 15min delay. If your broker is slow, look through Yahoo or smt.
PLTR 18 EOD ONLY GO UPPP
Hold White buffalos are hard to find
buy the pltr dip! we're going to $20 EOW
[deleted]
It basically follows the /ES anyway in a sense and makes you $25 per tick up.  

also the hours are completely normal??

https://ibb.co/Bjck88M


I'm just saying, give it a look, I've made $5000/day and it moves 80 - 400 a day some days
Yea..somewhere in that ballpark..should see 300k+ cases early next week..
You should have just bought a house.

Some of my best trades were fat fingered fuck ups.  I have faith in you my fellow retard
TSLA 420.69 EOD
But PLUG is gay plaything
Please tell me this is a joke
Sometime next week hopefully. Open till end of the month so maybe not till first or second week of December.
TSLA killin my PLTR vibe
Who fomo’d into tsla calls at the top?
I can't stop laughing at everyone buying over priced stocks during a pandemic 😫
im starting to think this TSLA day time non after hours moon aint gonna happen this week.... shit
Hold that mf. This rocket to the moon is just starting
This is the way.

A true retard.

Blnk boys we rich. Should I hold this long term?
To be honest i love this sub,
We can just talk about anything and rant about anything share our despair share our joy.

Just want you to know if you’re reading this, you’re awesome
TWTR has stories now lol

calls
I am actually retarded. I bought weeklie calls at the top (40c's) on LI that **expire in 3 days**.
Yes
No way. Easy way to lose.
my calendar was positive today despite the tank

the 200c i sold went from 4.0 to 0.3 (just bought it back!)
Proof or ban
Exactly
I got December 4 call
hell no
Easily going to 18
I want to get Nio puts but it’s scary :/
any reason its selling off..? or expectation as to when it'll turn back up
[removed]
Ok bruh *becomes bankrupt*
Up 85% on my PLTR leaps I bought a week ago. Fomoing so hard I didn't buy more
It probably has to do with the spin off merger but idk
Pltr has me up 16% overall right now do y’all think it’s too late to buy more?
[deleted]
What did you do
What a fucking joke
Better not be for the week. I'm out of day trades 😂
Yes
Why AA over some other airlines? I dont think you can go wrong with any of them. Im partial to southwest and spirit
PLTR dip, get in!

Good stuff man. Congrats on the gains! Mine are also 12/18. No FDs for me this time

Im praying with you brother
Real question, are people still spending? I think from August to October I was out and buying mad shit, with plenty of online orders. But haven't really ordered or bought anything over $10 in the past 2-3 weeks.
Spy gonna drop one more time before the inevitable pump
Remember that $1,200,000,000 SPY dark pool share order that came in earlier?:

* SPY 02/19/2021 343c for $128,100,000
* Tagged on the PHLX exchange as stock-contingent
I my self am too chicken to play that game
don't ever listen to this sub again they were probably trying to fuck you over and got got.
Is going all in amzn 1 week calls good playz?
The IV on PLTR is insane
Ya'll still sleepin on SBE.  Just as much meme potential as PLTR
So PLTR is like google for the 3-letter agencies right? How the fuck they losing money.
[deleted]
Yeah buy because you won't see it that cheap maybe ever again it has a lot of support and is a future proof company.
Meta
Buying into CRSR myself!
We're not the only ones FOMOing, hopefully it keeps up!
You right
FCEL got the juice for a penny stock
Zoom killing both bears and bulls the last few days
partnership w ORCL
Puts. It’s not going to hold at that level.... then calls
If you see SPY red just buy calls. Seems pretty simple.
Lol

I read somewhere they lost money already.And fired the guy who was investing dont remember the name.
I'm just happy that my retarded ass is now in the green again.  My dumb ass had a meme buy in at 420.69 and the order executed because I forgot I jokingly put it in there.  Now it's finally worth more than that.
Jumped in at 40, felt really safe last week, these days, well...

PLTR dip, LOAD UPPP before we hit 20
Are meme stocks like SPCE and NIO’s rise a sign of the moral decay of modern society? I mean I’m long spce but they seem to just lie about their flights and don’t do anything.
DDOG mooning!
I found a 🌈🐻
imagine panic selling PLTR when it dips 20 cents😂
Dude fucking be patient
Any dd on kndi —such a run
PDD found support and is about to rip again
SVXY, lost 90% of its value in one day
It's possible. It's starting to look to me like this is supported at the 360 range at this point.
Dumb
Revolut
Shhhhh keep ot on the DL. No need for WSB to know about this.
Yep
lets talk american airlines. anyone thinking of going balls deep and riding the next vaccine eua?
Hasn’t been a bad buy, probably offloading soon tho
Mostly buying and selling deep otm calls. Some stock. Apple Amazon etc for last 4-5 years.
Thanks! I have no clue what I’m doing. Just lucky NIO exploded.
💎✋
Yeah I got out of GDRX
Someone stop me from selling $BABA.

Very disappointing price action.....a lot of teasing
Thank you kind autist who said to buy plug. Needed that.
Man these 290$ 12/11 BABA calls are fucking bleeding me and yet I refuse to sell because I just know it's going to pop off eventually dammit
It's bearish
I can only get so erect from this statement.
i was on the shitter, thinking 4k in my bank account wasnt enough. so i deposited almost all of
it into tesla calls cus WSB IS LIFE. held and took a 15% loss on the day. but held through the day and made it thru to the other side
How do I lose money every day
[deleted]
tards who bought at the top
Just trust its not the top
You know how people trade APPL instead of AAPL? Yeah, I’m going to need the same people thinking they’re getting into NIO to end up in TSLA
Solo second ride to 18% today starting now
Lost 4k now BABA.. JACK MA IS UGLY
BABA and the 40 thieves
TSLA looking like a bargain at P/E = 852.  But growth
Hold and wait til tomorrow. We're all gonna be okay
Cool, but you need $7,500 in margin to trade one contract of NKD, and the trading hours are pretty wonky.
So you’re never buying? 🚀🚀🚀
You can’t lose money if you don’t sell
i have a lot of $15, $20, $30 leaps that I am looking to take churn gains on in the next two years.
writing 11/20 GDRX 30p at the moment. Not much, but it's honest work
Hope you’re right😂 can’t seem to find bottom
ha ha
....got PDT'd _by_ holding tsla, or got PDT'd and now you're _stuck_ holding tsla?
It's called profit taking bruh. Nothing wrong with selling a few.
It's chinese
200% IV...
Nice

S&P is in the RED 
TSLA to be included in S&P is in the GREEN
SO will Tsla end up red? Or will S&P end up green? 
Or they both meet in the middle? 
TSLA 400P 11/20
Are all those upvotes people who think that it’s too late or people who want an answer to the question?
So much for tsla insane volume

It can go sideways for as long as it takes for news from CCP antitrust to come in.
Hold! It will be back

Looks like SoftBank has been selling off stocks rapidly to raise cash could that have caused some of tech sell off?

Guess who bought pltr weeklies at the top 🤡

Also look at SOLO 😊😊😊😊
I thought he was an android?
Trade it don’t marry it papa
This thing with BABA is absolutely insane
Bought one 5C 11/27 exp
Ok retard just to let you know this is when you cash out to recoup your losses
Good luck! Hope we make some money

Just fucking hold.
Calls
December 4 call
Very. It’s will have little pull backs but continue to moon to 30.
You are good my dude. I guess ur used to buying otm calls/puts. Selling covered calls is very safe. The only problem is if the stock tanks. You could buy some deep otm puts to cover your shares in case they drop and still end up over 1000 in profit. At least for this week
PLTR dipping, buy in if you haven't hopped on the train.
[deleted]
All in on nio calls. Here we go
Yea it costs $5 to be able to have $5k instant deposit 

Also not having immediate funds isnt a robinhood thing all brokers do it
His hair alone is a good reason to go all in at any price under $30

it's the same price as 20 minutes ago you weeb. Message me in a week, go focus on your schoolwork...
Thanks lol, goodluck to you too
Dw you’ll lose it all 😂👍
after my 500 calls expire this friday
Shit is actually getting so stupid to call it’s not even hard, we know it will always jump in 0.50-1 increments, the moment it breaks either direction it goes smoothly to the next level.

Hell no. All they did was a little cable management lmao. 

RemindMe! 3 days
false, folks know it's basically the privatized version of prism & the other nsa style mass surveillance tech. PLTR has built proprietary algorithms on top of that. It's pretty useful because it enables the gov to sidestep privacy concerns, and I doubt big gov currently has no interest in building data store superiority given China's approach to the same

if you look at the few weeks after the recent IPOs, they always dip from the initial spike, and then skyrocket. fairly predictable stuff if we're being honest with each other

When is amazon and Tesla leaving 4 Mars?
lol just buy, dont wait for a dip cuz there ain't gonna be one
Just like they won't let baba the Amazon of China fail right?
They don't hire the smartest because they pay far low for it to happen. The smartest engineers work elsewhere. I work at Google but my pay would get cut in more than 1/3 if I went to PLTR. Not to mention I lose alot of benefits. I don't consider myself smart either... I am average at Google.

They work on all the low hanging fruit. Aerospace/legacy automotive/defense are the slowest to move industries outside of government.
Can't believe I sold PLTR at a loss a month ago. I'm just too quick on my hands

Get rid of your wife and her boyfriend LMFAOooo
I had straight PLTR calls yesterday and decided to turn them into spreads. Yeah it'll be a 3x as long as its over 17 by Dec 18th, but fuck man I could have gotten an easy 2x with the calls I had.

Same with with selling my BLNK this morning. It would be at 2x right now. Fuck me I'm so dumb.
Oh so you’re a genius
I bought a few 25c 12/24. I’m hoping so
Uhm wait until the government contracts news comes out now sit down they trace covid
If pltr goes up I make money if it goes down I avg down we gucci

Then sell it, you weren’t scared of losing you initial investment but if you feel in too deep after gains then just sell
Yep. Long way to go
Hopefully $10 so I can buy a shit ton more shares
Damn NIO is taking a fat nap. WAKE THE FUCK UP
lmao
ooooooo i almost fomo’d in on that. ouch
Yeah people are buying while it's still cheap.
That’s not a healthy looking graph
Nios got performance anxiety
When spy is red but your portfolio is green 😎😎 makes me feel so smart
I’m kidding btw I see this easily multiplying in the next few years as they increase their private sector business. Companies are saving billions using their software and they hire the smartest engineers in the world to do it.

But yes, fickle government contracts could temporarily cause drops come earnings. Still out of all the shit pumped here, this one is here to stay for years to come.
Damn i was in on 96s made like 60% profit
Peter Thiel, you are not my friend, you are my brother, my friend

Imagine we finish green 😂
that's why it's called SOLO and not UANDYOURMATES
Is TSLA a boomer stock now that it is a part of the S&P500?
Potentially it fails, pretty cheap lotto right now though
AAPL makin me SOLID
Hold you pussy
How are everyone's CCL & NCLH puts doing? LMAAAOOOOOO
[deleted]
I felt that one
Probably never
Ayyyy I’m sure you’re not the only one, here’s some advice... stop being a Fukin retard and you’ll actually make money
17.86
Not sure that’s a good thing? Definitely better than smoking bowls. It’s been a fun couple months, definitely takes the edge off what would normally be stressful situations at work.
CCL is a god

lmao like 30% in three days?
🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Is pltr still worth to jump on?
Is anyone having a really hard time trying to play this market ever since COVID? I was doing really well before and even made money on the way down in March, but feel like I've just been losing money consistently since June on calls and puts.
Solo
and you cashed in your gains. smart man
when is tesla done fucking bleeding omg
Makes sense thank you!
Uhm no lol
Alright CCL enough already. When’s it gonna come back down?
What's the difference between cruise stocks and a bucket of shit?

&#x200B;

Answer: >!the bucket!<
well if u never come back you can never make it back
This ain’t a yolo
Pretty sure I only bought it because I like the ticker symbol
PLTR at IPO - noone knows what the fuck this company does and is overpriced at $9.

PLTR now - still noone knows exactly what the fuck it does, but it might involve some dastardly shit using tech and is therefore underpriced at $17.

I'm so mad, how is it UP? For WHAT?
PLTR gonna be nice and let you guys get on for a second.
I wanted to play them fuck

Well... looks like I’m holding NIO through earnings I guess
If you are AMERICAN, you will invest in AES. Them mutha fuckas bout to take me to the moon and i want y'all to watch from your commie dirt.
Meaning other defense contractors would have to go bust. I see PLTR tanking when they lose or contracts get delayed. Government contacts have calluses that allow them to delay, pause, cancel rather easily.

Lockheed and other big defense contractors spread their workforce out so much government can't cancel without hurting so many people around the country.

I believe PLTR plans to do this if you notice their locations have been spreading across. California, Denver, D.C area and more.
[deleted]
Never selling
Earnings. I think it will be like this all day and moon in after market
Nio went vertical for an entire week.
This stock only has catalysts of improvement ahead only the beginning
TSLA.. wrong way buddy... wrong way
Ah man wrong way TSLA
No one told me NIO became a boomer stock
That 37 cent gain on BABA on the day was just too much. Investors couldn't miss an opportunity to sell.
I sold my Solo too early. When it jumps off a cliff again I’m buying back in
And better hookers
Yes
Just embrace it.  Buy leaps at 20 sell half at $22 and turn the rest into spreads.
Who bought BLNK when I told them too?
Just a solid stock not a meme stock.  Promising movement this morning and it had a dip
Sure, so inherently my strategy was a modified version of the condor. I had vertical spreads on both the calls and the puts. These spreads (net credit) were crushed by the IV. People were expecting a 15% move on $SE earnings but as we saw today, the move was only \~1%.   


Hence, these spreads turned out to be very profitable, as the options that I sold decreased in value much more than the options I had purchased.   


However, since I mentioned this was a **modified** version of the iron condor, I did have shares / calls on top, since I was afraid of "moon risk". Namely, I did not want to see a negative P/L if the underlying went up +20%, so therefore I have these positions to hedge against.   


So I closed out the spreads for a very nice profit, but now the question is what do I do with these long calls and long shares?  


The answer was to turn them into calendar spreads (sell these calls, purchase the same calls further dated out) as well as covered calls on the shares (selling calls on the shares that I own).   


Hope this helps a bit!
# Roll call for NVDA earnings gang
i know switching to TSLA poots is a trap lmao
Looks like they were granted FDA priority tag.  Should know if the blood drug is approved no later than 6 months from now
pltr gonna come back down a bit again right
Anyone thinks NVDA will dip after earnings?
Hold that bitch
Because no ones wants to hold though earnings
Tesla: Big dick is back in town
AYRO 12/18 7.5c and AYRO 2/19 7.5c, your next NIO/TSLA awaits.
Warren Buffet secretly buying PLTR?
Imagine being jacked to the tits in FAANG names, and missing out on the great growth story and sector rotation into cruise companies in the middle of a pandemic!
Baba u bitch I trusted u
I hope you closed lmao
Lotto ticket NIO tonight through earnings??
Stonks only go up
Ugh any time I see vix die like this I get nervous
Ahh sorry buddy. I kept buying leaps and selling puts on the way down. I'm bullish on the company for the long term
tmr morning
Got in on PLTR yesterday. I know nothing about the company. Yolo'd the rest of my portfolio yesterday on it cause some guy said to buy May calls. Is this another CRWD? or SPCE? Whats going on here.
Sector rotation to PLTR
Is it just me or... 
i feel that once a stock loses meme status or WSB stop talking about it, it basically flatline all the way
Me.
In BABA calls and BA puts at the moment. What about you??
SOLO legit looks like half a car. When they releasing the second half?
[deleted]
You know what the best thing is? Passive money managers following S&P have to sell a bit of all other 499 stocks of the S&P in order to fund their TSLA purchase
Well no someone has to buy it to pay you the premium. 

That's where the 1400 dollar credit comes from. Someone is paying you a deposit to hold those shares at the price you agree to sell them at. The strike price. 

Then if the option expires worthless you pocket the cash. Or someone exercises the option, you keep the credit and receive xx.xx per share.
Coz you are holding it

You got an eye for losing money!
When are we selling PLTR?
Saw that. Good for my calls I bought this morning
Still goes up next day
When do they expire?
Make him a mod already.
It took me four days to get my 5k.... fuck Robinhood
why is everything EXCEPT nio mooning?
No idea. You'll have to research. Check which states they operate in, covid numbers for those states, and invest accordingly.
I bought 11/27 500 calls at 450, thought that was the bottom. 😂
LOL. lmao made me spit my water
4.31 mah dude. 4 fucking 31. Had a 1000 of 'em.
What's sketchy about it?
Should of sold Tesla at that morning 460 pop and then just rebuy again later... now I’m stuck holding this shit
NIO would be hulk Bc green and dumb
It's just stabilizing, normal when you just jumped 10%. It won't stop going up.
I should have sold 10 mins after buying lol i got 11-27 calls can’t go tits up ehhh 😅😅
I guess, but I would sell calls closer to a 1% weekly return instead of 0.5%.  Slightly higher risk they're called away, but you're already up plenty on them.
My average is 26.20 \*cries\*
Should have.
Aapl fucking blasting off
Scared money doesn’t make money bby I love it
I’m only here to seize the means of production and overthrow the proletariat. Wait...shit you’re right. Dang it.
If the cash is in the account, it's a.simple misclick.  

Hoping my 21.1k mistake prints Friday, so j understand.
PLTR $19c 12/4 cause every time I’ve bet on PLTR so far it’s come through.
Kodk gonna get the loan bet

How I see PLTR right now

So easy free money with the $1,400 credit?
do it while u can
pltr eod price?
Tsla call holders or nio call holders this morning ? Who will win tomorrow? Find out next time on Dragon Ballz 🐉 🥚
The PLTR gains are good and all but idk how i feel about holding this for more than 2 days from now, usually vertical shit doesn’t end well in the short term
As someone who has held hundreds of calls that promptly dumped after the company crushed earnings, caveat emptor.
[deleted]
Sold RIOT calls for 500%. Good day boys good day
Any good 10k yolo lol
We also require those little rocket ship emojis sometimes.  Words are hard to read when you're crying over the daily losses.
Don't cum just yet!
When should I sell AMZN?
Something is seriously wrong with baba
hahaha literally every PLTR dip lasts about 60 seconds
I agree
nio gains
You're in the wrong stonks.
Ah, Redding. A desolate small town with nothing to do besides eat. That's even more south of an even smaller town that's has some citizens so afraid of aliens they literally nail tin foil to their rooftops (Shasta). Born and raised here I gotta say California Man puts up an even fight with Flordia Man
The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the pump
yea probably
They're not ree-ree. Dow down more than SP
yeah def gonna sell y’all some PLTR calls lmao
Kandi is making that run!
Lol yeah no fucking way. Unless they get some insane US government contracts

SPCE don't need no launch to blast off 🚀🚀🚀
Who?
Ok I'm back to August where I'm going up $5000 a day.

No
PLTR reporting in
For the sake of my shares, please stay away from PLTR. Thank you
Sell my tsla shares now?
When will my FOSL PUTS print?
Look, SPY and NASDAQ are both slightly red. What makes the tards think anything is going to go up bigly?
I dunno. I made money when it was at 19
I'm in both but really don't see SOLO being a long term play. Would not be caught dead in one of those cars
I’ll be at my 11/20 break even by the end of the day
woah woah woah pltr wrong way
Nice. I bought at 16.7 last week thinking I made a bad error.  It was on my radar 2-3 days before my purchase so I can't kick myself for not buying at 10. You heard about It here? What other shares you've bought? Looking for ideas
People know there will be another stock issuance duh.
walgreens is down after the amazon news. thoughts on buying the dip with vaccine distribution ahead of us?

Shoutout to whoever said to buy FUBO
its their fault for being gay
lol spy is waiting to get a fat dump
People... here's the TSLA trade.   Active money managers are going to be the SELLERS to the indexers which will mark the end of the ride.   Indexers will own the stock at ATH.   It can run for a bit longer but there will be a massive rotation of ownership.  You heard it hear first.   Oh yeah, market makers are gonna pump the vol into the mid Dec then crush it during the holidays.   Know what you own.
dow - 260 but most of the most active stocks are PUMPIN right now...

Yup. Government contracts are fickle. Defense contractors get delays, downsizing, cancellations all the time. The government has clauses that allow for this.

Fuck guys I don’t have a good feeling holding through nio earnings, setting up for a perfect MM trap
Is it too late to join PLTR party?
Don’t play with my heart baba
How many of y’all retards bought Tesla 500 calls 11/20 at open?
we want you to be rich.  get in.
Lmao what is this low volume shit
You are one sad, sad little man. Most kids on unemployment rn are NOT living paycheck to paycheck, they are getting cashed tf out and live with their parents so don’t pay a dime on rent. Idiot.
I got 267 and 270 calls so we will see I guess

Dumb to buy PLTR 18c 11/27?
I’m on WSB so obv not Lmao. 

No but in all seriousness I’m down like 2-3 dollars on each contract as of now so it ain’t too bad. Meanwhile PLTR is making my portfolio green for the first time so I’ll take it lmao
PLTR dips are just free money everyday
Sold PLTR at 13.96. Probably regret this
He’s shaking off paper hands so we can take off to the moon
Yet to start the first one

Edit: there's one before all of these - the r/wallstreetbets stage
Fuck outta here. I have calls on Nio, but that shit was never hitting that today. More like 55-60 of ER is solid.
APLE is green this means AAPL will be green too soon.
You left out KNDI, just got approved for US sales this AM. Cheapest EV on the market at 13k. If you live in Texas, it's eligible for a 2.5k rebate on top of that. It's up over 17% this morning.
How retarded is tsla 535 11/27
Idk shits not stopping
Rotate out of NIO into SOLO
This is honestly one of the stupidest things I’ve heard. 

Pure speculation they lose money on the car, absolutely an opportunity cost by selling a $35k version when they can use the same battery and motor in a higher priced model and improve their production mix.

Model 3s and Ys are still flying off the shelf and there is no excess capacity to cater to poor people. So I see this as completely rational, and a good business decision. The SR+ cost 8% more to the customer and zero incremental cost to manufacturer, completely rational decision... and what were the volumes on that SR model anyway?

*The NBA saw record low ratings for the Finals this year, is that a concern for the NBA?*

*No, it's not.*

Lol. Retarded
Why not do the $60 or so call options instead? You’ll make $4500 instead of $1400
Yeah I was about to fomo in, but then looked at the Solo on their website and honestly I can't see that getting bought by many people.
nah, its the next pump n pump

n pump n pump

Market doesn’t like to be red lol going green by lunch

If this hits, you can have that and a pool of money to swim in

Of above it. Just been pinned
Great idea!
damn SPY kinda just zoomed the fuck out of 358 zone
Nice, we’ll get a glimpse of our future

Nope. Right now is FOMO, it will drop in the coming weeks.

PLTR get in on every dip while it LASTS
You call that a gain?
MEME STOCKS! ...

...
ASSEMBLE.
Hold or sell, what are people thinking? 12/18 expiry
You think it'll hit $5 by January? I think it will but was gonna buy March calls just in case..

But it does look kinda promising, charts remind me of $SSI

All logic aside, stonks only go up anyway
I've been diamond handing puts for a week watching this shit and it does whatever the fuck it wants.  Rona rising, stonk goes up, trial cruise comes back with Rona, stonk goes up.  No revenue until middle of next year, stonk goes up.
The price is dropping but IV is high. My puts are only up 7% lol. Average of $4.04 on the 85s

You're a dumb ass OP.
It's a show: parks and rec
The PLTR to the moon guide:

- soon the normie subreddits such as r/stocks and r/investing will start talking about it
- then normie Twitter accounts
- then Boomer TV shows
- then the average person on the street

Each of these stages will mean another 10-15% on the stock price.
Never coming back
None of them are pumping today so far.
lol i was joking dude sorry

why dont I listen to u guys? NIO PLTR its literally being thrown at my eyeballs every single day its not like i have a life outside of staring at the daily threads why do i just not like free money rofl i hate myself
Dumbest shit I read all day. Those type of people live paycheck to paycheck and blow their money on dumb shit. Fuck you are retarded
FAKE NEWS!!!!
Anyone who realizes in the next couple years it can go back up to $50+ a share.  A 200%+ gain in a couple years ain’t too shabby.
You are!

They just might. My TQQQ calls are green now and I think they'll be solid EOD
Yes!
cause MM haven't gotten itnhigh enough for the rug pull
[deleted]
Definitely. You know it’s here to stay when people start using the company as a verb (I.e Google it). No one says shall we book a hotel, it’s now shall we Airbnb it. Silly not to get in on this
I’ll sell you the puts
Who has two thumbs and FOMOd into SOLO calls at the top and isn’t being punished for his autism?

👍😎👍 this guy
Meme stocks are just stocks that are memes

Get over it butch, what you gonna do aboutit?
Hump on PLTR while it's still under $20, won't be there for long.
The goal is to make $1,400 a week without selling the shares. However I would be happy to sell them at 4x what I paid. So win win right?
[deleted]
Retail investors make up less than 30 percent of the money tho? I always here this one
TESLAAAAAAAAAAAAA
People taking quick profit on PLTR and it just gets bought😂
Have you ever thought that you just dont understand the market instead of blaming it on external factors?
Bought a few shares hopping on train. Any call suggestions everything cheap as hell
Imagine stepping in front of a steamroller to pick up a dollar...
This $PLTR rug pull is about to send some people to the grave
PLTR $20 Call 11/20

PLTR $30 Call 1/15/21

All in, let's ride boys!
i am quite happy today
Well we know they’re moving into the consumer discretionary sector of the s&p..
Worse thing that can happen is if the stock tanks AH after the earnings report. You won't be able to set a stop loss and you'll be forced to hold the shares until the following day when you can buy to close your calls.

But if you're long, there isn't any real risk.
Last chance to get in on BTI

I got to get my funky off from 1000 shares at a buck a piece, but the fucker started flying after my trailing stop dropped them and of course I freaked and put all that on OOM. I'm stupid... what can I say.
Made about $100 today 😎
Kodak mooning
Why own 5500 shares of a meme stock if you’re not gonna sell covered calls to retards?
for long...EOY is 1.5 months away :-)
The blind leading the blind in here
Yea but in the vaccine side approximately only 90 people out of 19k we're even exposed to covid to even test the efficiency of the drug. It looks good that only 9 people got it out of 19k but 9 out of 90?
really can’t believe my weeks of dumping money into KNDI is actually paying off
Makes sense. Genuinely appreciate the reply.

agree just be a stock bear
How high can PLTR go? I’m holding shares not contracts (don’t crucify me scoob)
That POS need to move up 0.5% first. And I’m not sure that it’s capable.

Correct.

How bad do I get crushed by IV if I bought NIO today?
Upvote if you bought SPY calls because why the fuck wouldn’t you buy SPY calls at literally every chance now unless you’re a 🌈
Bought 200 shares of PLTR when it was $13.5. Dunno if I should average up
Hold, minimum $20 EOW
Who's fucking buying CCL I just wanna talk..
SE buy the dip opportunity too
In @ $10 and enjoying the ride
Awesome. How sure are you though??

You’d be a richer dumbass if you had bought more
why spy no die
Yeah it does. I keep wavering on pulling the trigger the day before these sq jumps. Driving me insane
Ur username just triggered me fuck u 😭
was bag holding solo... keep climbing
PLTR gonna hit 20. feeling a 20% kinda day
TSLA wtf do something 🙄
Well you're going to sell the calls, if someone buys the calls, then yes it's that easy. 

But someone may not buy the calls due to it's so far out of the money. 

Otherwise yeah it's a win win, if you can get someone to buy it.
i was saying 20, but most likely 25 EOY
Spy calls will print, change my mind.
Jack Dorsey is honestly retarded. The ZUCK 🦎 has mastered responding to governments. Unreal swiftness.

Congratulations 🍻
2023, yes typo
I wanted karma. I felt like I made enough game points on that option.
IV for this is 118% wtf does that mean is that bad
Profit is profit. Set an exit and stick to it. $200 is better but -$100 or more is worse, compounded by feeling like you hosed yourself.
The do secret stuff for the gov, no one knows but it’s provocative
In order for WSB to buy them, someone has to sell them...

That’s how the game works
I don’t know yet. I have some time I guess to figure it out
Oh trust I am
SQ fluctuates between $190 and $170 all the time
Stfu you gay bear.
Can never be happy at a stock taking off cause should have bought more
same sis, already did. fucked up last week listening to these losers and held my NIO call and lost bit. these are called “meme” stocks? and i learned that means take once you have a big enough gain you’re comfortable with and for me that’s honestly $100-300
I have shares but not nearly enough the FOMO is real
May george soros bless us, retard
When is BABA hitting $300??!!
BABA, rise from your grave!
Everyone hop on PLTR while it's still cheap, it will go very high and now is the best time !
You probably have never been accused of this but you put too much thought into it

Literally the one Chinese EV that’s looking like it’s not gonna pump like 15% today and it’s the one I play
Check out there website and you’ll see other credible reports and post too. I had my doubts when I first started looking at them but now they look pretty legit to me.
I sold my SOLO weekly yesterday at a massive loss with 300% IV and here it is today up 10%
Yeah ccp is great. My uygurs are working overtime with cheap labor producing my batteries with cheap lithium mined from inner mongolia
Nio will smash earnings right even if they're cooking so nio and ev's will go up again in the next few months?
Hold
Fuck solo I got stop lossed at 5.65 couple days back
[deleted]
Nio do soooomething
Why did he sell the short shorts again ? I wasn’t here around that time
Jesus christ.....pumping SOLO.  Have you looked at that mini turd?  It's insane what the market pumps.  That thing will hardly sell and the company won't even exist in 3 years.
its 17 bucks for a share brother nothing to lose here
Every dump is just a fakeout apparently
Ur mommy
Pharmacy
They just missed their phase 3 trials dawg. Abort
Go else where bro
Get in SOLO now
Yup
Should have rolled them into stocks because this bitch is going to 40.
I have a problem with what gets attributed to Trump as "success".  There are some things I think he is very right about in principle and he's terrible in execution.  And there's the problem of would things be EVEN better despite him.  Sure the economy has done well.  Would we have done better with a less chaotic leader?  He's very right on China, but lots of people were sounding that alarm for the last 10+ years, and he jumped on the bandwagon.  And has he actually put together an effective, consistent policy against China?  Wouldn't it have been better to have unity with our European allies in a strong stance against China as well as Australia?  who they are all now just getting the memo on the threat that China is... but Trump alienated them.  We're going to have to be united against China because they're only getting stronger and stronger and the pandemic gave them a boost relative to everyone else.  Immigration?  Huge problem.  What's actually been done to solve the problem?  Especially in a bipartisan acceptable way that just won't get undone by the next administration?  Healthcare?  Just 4 years of active sabotage.  And I practice medicine in a hospital so I have first hand knowledge of how terrible things are steadily getting.  And no the shitshow that is American healthcare is not his fault, but he sure as hell hasn't helped it.
Haha. I'm in on many 1/21/22 2c's. I've got time. ;)
we literally had to moon just so SPY could go test 360 one last time

whether or not it holds will decide the week
[deleted]
sell and rebuy when it dips.
buy on high sell on low plus pulling out too soon.
Can relate.
Low so far is $11.23.
BLNK !
So I only have to hold till Friday, if no one buys then I keep my shares and the $1,485? Is it really that easy? If someone buys then I walk away with selling my shares at 4x what I bought? This is a legit win win??
Sorry not sure what you mean by calendars/wheels (i am a dumb dumb), could you elaborate?
PLTR is about to break the $18 wall and go to minimum $20 end of week.
Okay so I bought some and I’m up $100 tenkyuu everyone lol
this year’s tech is an obvious outlier

your username checks out retard
ok.  all  in on PLTR.  11/20 18c
i think 25
Ranges from $20-25.

It’s lonely at the top 😔
if by "tanking" you mean nio is *only* up 1.6%, then yeah. its a bloodbath
Well if it beats it’s gonna skyrocket so hold it like a lotto ticket
They better! Cambridge Oxford one. not RNA.
Fully agree. Nearly $5b revenue and nowhere near matured yet, anything under $30b is a steal
Holding this boomer Apple shit while constantly watching square has me looking for the nearest window
Long 200 shares @1.98 will buy more every time it falls below $2. Been watching a bunch of funds buy sizable positions : Vanguard, Citadel, Boxer etc.
I'm holding my 12/18s yolo
I want to say you should have sold at the top, but then again my judgement of the top is hearing everyone say that NIO only goes up and my retarded ass believes them.  Perhaps better advice would be to go mostly cash gang or theta gang if you get up to the hundred thousands again.
Get in on plug you fucks. Offering more shares, which is bullish in long run, 2 months out
Haha I did 💵

Nope because I’m also about to jump in :)

What if its turn to 430?
I'm holding PLTR for long. But what's a reasonable EOY number for them? $25?
Rolled by PLTR call gains into puts for the inevitable pullback today

OKAY!
You apparently aren't very good at your job if looking at vaccine studies is what you do.  
  
>The primary outcome of this trial was a COVID-19 infection within SEVEN DAYS OF THE SECOND VACCINE. So technically speaking, any effectiveness of this vaccine is only for 7 days and you could essentially be completely vulnerable again (this likely isn’t the case, but still is still a possibility).   
  
Primary outcome 19 listed on clinicaltrials.gov is:
>"Confirmed Covid19 in Phase 2/3 participants without evidence of infection before vaccination [Time frame: from 7 days after the second dose of study intervention to the end of the study, up to 2 years].  
  
Similarly 20 also says 7 days up to 2 years. They continue to follow the patients and are looking at comparing cumulative infections between the study groups.

woohoo halo 4 just finished install
I'm $7.50C 12/18 so it won't go anywhere until after that.
Does having half of my account in nio stock expose me to nio earnings?
This is why you just set the limit price lower on a high volume stock like this
Wong
Keep praying man as $17 is getting out of your reach
SOLO is gonna absolutely blow it’s load if NIO crushes earnings. Could easily gap up another 10% after hours
Maybe you wanna save some for ABNB? Just saying nth serious here :)
I fucked up real nice with PLTR
Would you still buy it now ?
Do it
PLTR $20 eod
BCLI. It’s like at $4 and has a 12 month price target from $20-30
lmao too funny though
At what though 😅
What happens when you defy Sauron/NSA

Hey gains are gains move on
So say I bought 2 600c 12/11 TSLA for $600 at what point would I be making profit if things were going well? Is the number that RH shows me lying? Genuinely curious, thanks for any help
So we agree to pin TSLA at 447 now?
friendship with NIO ended, PLTR is new #1 butt buddy
I need that mofo to pump FB to 300
bruh, NIO is at all time high, the only way you lost money is by buying the peak and selling the dip that happened like 3 days ago. Wait, this is WSB, you retards likely did that.
New to options: Bought 5/21/21 PLTR call....does it make sense to sell it now or wait out more? I don’t want to lose out on profits now
Now that ya'll are done with Chinese Tesla, I'd like to point out that Chinese Netflix is down 15% today (IQ)

My sweet child, PLTR only goes up
I just see him as trumps Little bitch
My financial future is dependent on a sketchy Chinese EV companies earnings after the bell. Where did I go wrong in my life
TSLA has barely passed 30M volume on any day since 11/1.    It's done that in an hour today. 

Suckers will be done selling soon. Then hopefully we'll take off.
Quantity isn't important, what % of your portfolio is it? Above 50% I'd say you're getting there...90% is balls deep.
i was worried PLTR was a pump and dump, but the wsb echo chamber got me.  son of a bitch, i'm in!
Big players have thrown billions into this stock. It's a long hold. Strong COVID play. Easily see this thing doubling by end of year.

Shun the nonbelievers!
Institutions massive buys
It’s a deleted scene. I think it’s in the extended version only.
The difference is China will want to outsource jobs to other countries. Apple has already started moving its factory and production to Vietnam and is making high quality tech already. Developing nations have a younger population with a huge appetite for tech and EV is just one of the meals they want to eat.

I sold my PLTR calls early on for some mediocre gains this morning 🤡🤡🤡
What are your dumb TSLA lottos? I bought a 500c for next week 🤷‍♂️
Its 4.5$ u cheap cup holder
Yeah and you’ve been rewarded handsomely for buying the sub 420 dip, congrats!
PLTR is unstoppable today. Look at all the dips. Every single one gets bought INSTANTLY and it just rides the Bollinger band since open
Except those shares are worth $240,000 right now, and he's getting a pittance of a premium for them.  Why bother with selling such cheap calls?
Alright I’m gonna masturbate now and when I come back I want to see Tesla above 450
Sold my NIO position on Friday and bought more PLTR. Am 80% PLTR now and am erect.

Fuck pltr! I was selling puts on it thinking it won't move too much at the same time... Oh well, gains are gains
they gonna need to increase price target on PLTR

Closed all positions today. Gotta pay so much taxes this year
Buy Robinhood gold idiot you can then transfer more. Are you from investing?

Calendars look good, I closed some positions and turned into calendars/wheels to lock in profit

Hell no
It's something to do with Lord of The Rings.
No one here is half retarded. Most of us are 100%
The PLTR fomo is this the work of the autistic collective known as WSB or some higher power
Reminder that Tsla and Nio are proxys to each other now like FB and GOOGL and TTD. By holding a tesla position today, you area also exposing yourself to NIO earnings.
$20 EOW MINIMUM. Buy PLTR now while you still can.
If you're ok with losing that money quickly, go ahead. You could pretend to buy one and watch what it does. In weekly options near the money, +100% -> -75% can happen in minutes. Options with < 3 months to expiry is far more like gambling than investing.
PLTR has been on a run since the beginning of the month, what took you so long?
If it does you profit either way. Hard to mess it up. But someone has to buy the contracts. Then you just have that money tied up until expiration.
remember HTZ fomo?
idc, I'm long and will gladly take the mooning now and sell on high IV then rebuy after they crash it
How can some1 accidentally throw 30k out of the window... I guess im too poor for this sub
I’m sorry. Are you special needs? The stock moved 10% after hours on news for S&P inclusion. The options market closes at 4 and opens at 9:30. Without this news event you were most likely losing all that money. You got lucky.
we should put our smooth brains together to try and figure out who is getting kicked from s&p
Bullish as one can be on PLTR but this one is just LOL.

Sold all 50fds on pltr at 1715. Had to lock it in
You can’t mess it up. The only “risk” involved is if, by nov 20, it goes up to 100, then you miss out on an extra 5,500* $25 worth of profit. Your profit will be premium collected + (75-21.66) * 5,500.
You son of a bitch

Tbh I think REITs are a good bet. But your timeline is way too short.  

I don’t really have the time to give you the DD on this right now but... They may get back to $4+ but it’s at least six months out. If you look at the charts for each of the major REITs you’ll see that they are not close to recovering from the COVID drop. Also, a big issue you will have if you make this play is low volume, both in the underlying stock but the options as well. Hard to sell something that doesn’t get any volume. 

Also, just so everyone knows, while the ticker is “New York Mortgage Trust”  their properties are outside of the city and state.
Nice
Break that $18 wall PLTR ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
PLTR is helping for COVID as well as many other government ventures + it's starting to be commercial.
It usually shoots up around 12-2 because people are getting out of lunch

What is this collection of letters saying?
sold PFE at open :(
I just bought 100 shares of PLTR. Get your puts in now.
BABA's the worst.
PLTR I can only get so ERECT!
Nice job!
KNDI taking off. See you autists on the moon! In at 1k shares at 8.

[WSB on PLTR today](https://i.imgur.com/05wQUwS.jpg)
that's usually where the best gains come from. I barely know what Nio does(EV) and they did 2000%
Because it's rigged and news outlet has to operate in good faith but insiders will financially gain from this, and never get caught if the bets are not that ridiculous.
I am looking at IPOB for long shares
Source ? This is exciting
NOK is on its way to $5
the top is in boys
PLTR to $20 eow
I went all in but bought a protective put bc Im a pussy
Lol
same i'm kicking myself rn
PLTR how I love you
Man. Selling puts since last week So that I can get assigned to those damn shares. It's been going up and up like a retard
We all told you PLTR was FREE MONEY
PLTR looking so good
Tesla calls are still pretty cheap, surprisingly
$16

I'm not that crazy
Positions ?
PLTR taking me to early retirement
ETSY dip anyone?
How many calls in one stock do you have to have to be  considered “balls deep”?
Sell it. Make the money. Come back on the dip after earnings.
good looks brotha 🙏🏽
NVDA has not done well on earnings.  The stock has stayed flat.  This time might be different because the stock sold off a few times and then came back to settle in 530 to 545 range.
You can’t fuck this up. It’s free money
PLTR LET'S GO
Sold my PLTR calls and bought TSLA calls at open 🤡
SOLO is the one again. Buy my covered calls.

GREAT! ANOTHER THETA DAY!
[deleted]
PLTR will shape the governments and many companies for the future buy now while it's still that cheap, it's breaking the $18 mark soon.
You think most of WSB knows what a credit spread is?
NIO consolidating then exploding around noon, flat during power hour and then only god knows what will happen next.
I'm up on my VALE options I bought before battery day. Lol
its still up and flat, its still good
You are just 21, there is a long way to go and you can easily recover from this. I lost $15,000 overnight from a derivative product when I was 21 but I have made all that losses back shortly
How the fuck is CCL still going up 🤡🤡🤡
Ba moving a bit
I think I learned to numb myself after years and years of trading. Don't get me wrong, I still get annoyed with the swings, but after a while, you just get used to it. 

I used to have trouble sleeping and would wake up in cold sweats. My bed would be soaked sometimes and my heart would beat rapidly as I reached for my phone to check futures. It never goes away, but your brain and body adjusts to the constant stress and learns to tune it out.
# 100% in PLTR

# have no idea what the fuck they do or even what the company name is
By now it's really more for entertainment than for actually making money. I really dislike this stock
Be glad. It could get so much fucking worse, just hold through ER
[deleted]
For Tesla of all stocks you’d expect a little more action. More of a frenzy than Etsy.

Having PLTR calls going all the way to 2023 feels pretty gosh darned good right now gang.
Optimistic but not crazy. This thing has legs. Sitting on 11/27 14.5c, 12/18 17c, 1/15 15c feeling the same.
[deleted]
Wait wouldn’t this be a sell because it went through at the bid price? Legit question
If it goes to 75$. Doubt it'll fill that far otm and close to expiration
Should I exercise my NIO $17c 1/15/21?
Kndi puts
lololol
You gotta buy even more, it's the future of data analysis.
BABA Buy
Mark Zuckerberg is a Lizard Person if I’ve ever seen one 🦎

It’s a temp pullback, I mean come on the market basically just rallied 10 days straight, we might slam down to 3510 or so but I doubt we’ll go much lower if we can even get down there

according to price action today amazon is getting booted from SP500 to let tsla in
RIOT just casually climbed up 20% in the past hour lol
Hmm my tsla calls expire 9/17 at strike 430, wondering if I should sell for 25% profit and move out the strike since this huge spike threw them big time itm
Developing nations have come quite far in terms of electrical infrastructure. It’s not completely there yet but as demand for electric car increases so will demand for improved electrical infrastructure
QQQ broke below the supporting uptrend a little this morning. I think we droppin before the day is out.

Shhhh
And now it's up another 9% today what a fuckin loser that guy is.

Glad I hopped on those 25c after this reddit post for a 150% gain in less than 24hrs.
Im too broke  to exercise otherwise I would. This stock is going to grow exponentially since they've figured out how to get non government clients as well.

Cashing out to pay off credit card debt I racked up over last 7 years after I was homeless from losing $250k life savings. Still have 3x $14.5c 12/24 exp and 2x $25c  01/15/21 exp
I wish you luck
I will upvote because you paid $400 for a screenshot
covid surging again, highly doubt it
There is still so much volume behind PLTR goddamn
Nio been edging me all day fuck
Please tell all your friends to buy PLTR they have amazing ties to governments and companies and data analysis and being able to comprehend large datasets is the future!
Pls don’t tell me you guy jumped in to Tesla today lol
Right, so had you bought yesterday, you would've sold right at open if you're buying options or premarket if shares.
Future victims of iv crush
I really believe it’s gonna hit $20 eow

Imagine not getting into pltr at $10 and not buying leaps
[deleted]
I wish I had such big balls. But for now I’ll keep my 720 shares
Oops, Square.
Did PLTR get an upgrade today? 

Feel like I missed something but still on top of the world!
He was a real life Frank Gallagher 😆 🤣 😂
u/ruum-502  just called us retards (not in a good way) @ r/options and claims he's making a fortune selling OTM calls on NIO to us.

Ban that fckr
Pics or ban
PLTR was the easiest shit ever. Retarded analysts miss priced it because of politics and being a direct listing kept it from being hyped up on the day it started trading.
This is tragic
Will be hilarious if they slow walk tsla back to 420 lol
SOLO. 🥰
🍎 to 🍏 let's break out of this consolidation today!
$16* Fat fingers lol
I see, I don't know myself but I suppose it's the 2nd one

Buy them they have a strong future we need to break the $18 resistance.

I read that because PFE took partial ownership in VTRS, everyone who owns PFE was given VTRS stock with the ratio of your VTRS stock over your PFE holdings equal to the percent ownership of VTRS that PFE acquired.
PLTR $50 EOM
Excuse you... share the tendies please I only heard of SOLO last week

I don’t like people to lose money. I have lost a lot
ugh wondering if I should rebuy my 17.50 covered calls at a loss to stay in this
position?
I honestly don't remember this scene at all
Don't worry, Elon will probably tweet a photo showing that Crew Dragon all have matching tattoos of 🐍🎷...and it will jump up 20%.
>Model 3 Standard Range is currently off the menu until they can produce a cheaper car, possibly with the sticker price of 25k starting in 2021.

Is this a typo? There's not a chance in hell Tesla makes a $25k car in 2021.
Palantir Landscaping?
TSLA Jan calls
I bought some weekly puts this morning but selling EOD
Then sell puts. No iv crush

I’m just waiting for spce to announce more stock dilution to raise money
Spy going green in a few minutes 🤡
GME is a cruel mistress.  Should have learned that by now.
My main FOMO trigger is when a stock I own starts making a big move. I think "my position is too small" and I end up buying more at the top. 

Being a trader means always fighting the inherent flaws in human nature. We are greedy when we should be cautious. Cautious when we need to be greedy. If you go over my trading notes from the last 20 years, you'll see me repeatedly say "wait for the fat pitch. Buy when others are panic selling"

&#x200B;

It sounds simple and cliche, but if you can be disciplined and just wait for those fat pitches, you can be consistently profitable. But we're not robots. My journey has taught me that most humans aren't built for trading/gambling. We are emotional and easily manipulated by signals. The market is full of signals designed to trick you and trigger you into doing the exact opposite of what you should be doing. 

&#x200B;

My best trades were the ones I was most nervous/scared to enter. So this is a long-winded way of saying being a contrarian and going against the herd and your own emotions will lead to better results. Train yourself to go against the grain (buy only when there is panic/blood on the streets) and eventually, it becomes a habit. I actually get a boner now when markets crash. Large gap downs on a uptrend market are my favorite setup.
Jump on PLTR while it's still cheap.
KNDI and a PLTR fomo just turned me green.

Oh joy another BABA pump fake🙄
Still holding. She's gonna moon after ER
I don’t necessarily disagree but there is very real bankruptcy risk here. They have had to raise many billions in the private markets at less than ideal rates and they only have so much runway left.
Yeah because an American data company is so much like a chinese ev company. But then again this sub looks for lotto tickets instead of doing DD and fundamentals.

NIO gang must still be sleeping right now need all the strength for that NIO spam later in the day.
Unfortunately you learn expensive lessons in the stock market, you’ll be back for more.
Earnings too risky imo, pltr rotation
MARA randomly dumps 30-40% out of nowhere. So many times shitcoin goes up 1000 and MARA goes up 2 cents. Definitely a fucked stock. But RIOT ain't bad. Wish I got it back in the day over MARA
It’s better than a losing trade lmao

Why didn’t I sell TSLA at open? 😫
I do it here at least six times a day.
yeah i’m not going to read this but i appreciate the effort. tsla 🚀
It's still relatively early for this hype train, especially if you're long on PLTR
I bought over a 1000 under $1 and have been selling some every time we reach a peak, todays peak will be the end of my solo run sadly
Lmao god speed

Tell me about it, I don’t even care about the loss, it’s just boring and this money could be spent better elsewhere
PLTR has nearly made me as much today as TSLA and I have double TSLA in my account than PLTR
I knew I was gonna get rich off PLTR from IPO, but I didn’t think I’d get rich this quickly
I told you broke fuktards to buy KNDI this morning,  but u slepted on cheap Tesla coat tail rider

Well I got back into BLNK and I'm instantly green on my calls.

God damn I feel stupid for selling this morning, but it really looked like it was about to drop. I didn't even panic sell, I just set a tight stop loss and it hit it.
it's really a thing to behold

As soon as the big wall at 17.50 broke, buyers flooding in to buy at 17.50 and up

Ah guess you don’t know much about Thiel. He’s a very strange man who has done a lot of bad things including suppressing free speech by financing expensive lawsuits to put publications out of business to settle a personal vendetta while he makes billions spying on us.

Motley Fool announces a rare all in event today on Palantir, ticker PLTR. We believe that this stock is a millionaire maker.
Def. I've decided I'm going to see this one through until at least next Wednesday. I've seen Speed 2; I know how this ends. 11/27 17p
That's only if you have the stock.

Without the stock, every penny above $55 will be a $1 loss for you. If NIO reaches $60 for example, you'll lose $5x100 = $500.

imo, if naked calls are for people with big ballz. if you score everytime, you make big money, like lambo money if you do like 1000 otm contracts at a time
fucked up and got my calls for December yesterday, already down 30% lol
Guys please don’t jinx PLTR

You're assuming this sub is full of millenials instead of boomers pretending to be millenials.
Exhibit A lol
If you lost money on GME, I can understand why you dont understand GME bulls. you literally take all the information given to you and throw it out the window, do something other then what everyones been saying then blame GME bulls
He actually gained, but doesn't know how to post a picture of gains. You have to swipe through 3 images. Lame.
w-would someone really do that? go on to the internet and pretend to know what they're talking about?

Really hoping square has a 6% day today.
Nice -7%
Why didn't I buy more PLTR
Because he can sell his interest in the company if others dont come around

Why nobody ever talk about RIDE?! Shit is the next NIO
Never buying another stonk again

PLTR you will either make me homeless or a billionaire

No in between!
Just went full yolo on pltr.
gonna ride at 360 today i guess
PLTR broke the 17.50$ it's heading to $18 and $20 EOW
Is there still time to buy PLTR? I knew I should have bought calls.
PTON been chilling at 100ish for a few days now, really hoping for a breakout soon. What are your thoughts on PTON, just keep buying in?
[deleted]
Sorry guys. I bought the FSR dip so it kept dipping.
Bro PLTR save some fuel for the rest of the week
BLNK pumping bois
Buy PLTR. Done.
Dollar is foook right now lol

Can’t print more buttcoins
The next faang generation. Imagine the long term gains
[deleted]
What’re you going in on? I can’t get a fill
[deleted]
Dick and balls
well it was a very wide spread not naked, I dont have that much cash to cover
They're just getting hotter too
NIO IV is so fucking high. Whose holding this bitch? I don’t like it.
Elon is our king, I feel dirty betting against him.
VALE to the moon
I can’t deal with this price action on TSLA. I missed my exit point at 460 and want to get back there
Position?
Man I thought today would be like a day in August for Tesla :(
what fucking stock gives 10% + 2% for inflation
That's a logical move but ji actually ended up buying palantir at 17. Been watching it since 10 and I'm finally joining in despite the fact that I have no clue why it may succeed other tha peter thiel and data
I’m hoping I bought it at a 2$ NIO price haha
sold mine for a 10% loss im gonna prob buy back whenever the ccp stops being dickheads.
Ah, yes I added some downside protection with options.
[deleted]
Ban
Greed keeps you in pain will take you out
Moon!
Buy the dip, dipshits.
That makes more sense. Still $13 is a steal. I’m just too heavily invested in PLTR, SBE, and PSTH to do anything right now. PLTR and SBE are paying off while PSTH is flat.
you wouldn't bet against the CIA
I had all calls, if you look at the time frame it was back when everything crashed a second time
Why did I buy shares in PLTR and not call options... darn
Brother
$20 conservative...good momentum and volume
TSLOL
I hope so
Damn did soros invest?
The good ol dump at open and then pump
My autist sense were tingling. Like before NIO became NIO it was a SOLO
SBE anyone??
Solo and Kndi doing bits
Wsb is not retarded enough for you. 

PLTR to the moon also.
my baby calls keep growing, I'm at 70% gain right now with 2022 leaps
Literally $30
Premiums are wicked fuckin high
Anyone know why B TC has been booming this year
VXX has been the most exhausting hold of the last few months.

My brain is mush.
Just buy LEAPs and use options the way they're meant to be used
PLTR breaking 17.50 resistance. $18 eod $20 eow $22 11/27

Just burn your money
Yup I dumped my GE down 50% LOL.

I did make some of it back with an options play last earnings.
FCEL calls anyone?
I’ve spent the rest of my available money in my portfolio on PLTR... how do I buy more?
# /r/PLTRstreetbets
SOLO is vibin again
Yeah I was surprised by the div announcement. And then the upgrades good too!
Median price target is 360. It's horribly undervalued.
Fucking solo boys
God damn dodge a bullet dumping my shares of goodrx after their earnings.
PLTR just keeps blasting
Every dip is bought up. Still room
Thanks for heatin up the tendies.
Don’t anti-vax shame me!
I wish I bought below 14. Dammit. Better I got in under 15 at least.
It's not selling off once it gets momentum. This would make sense before it was less popular.
It’s a reverse merger. Mullen is merging into the existing NETE ticker. Look up Mullen merger
Is the pfe spin off merger a good thing for call holders?
SHOP
CORSAIR IS A FUCKIN BEAST.
Boring day
[removed]
Buffet rumors
I guess Alibaba is going to do this sideways shit all week
RIP my 11/20 debits spreads I guess
Buy PLTR while you still can, it's a bargain at that price.
oooo hyper course sounds interesting.

but yea, i was just curious if your method was the same or if you made any tweaks purely out of curiosity.
VIBE CHECK
Down 8% after almost 2 weeks of 5-10% positive days is free fall now?
There's even a gay bear watching in horror from the corner
Tesla gives to all. Likes to give bears a chance to make a bit too. That drop from 460 to 445 was the gift. Just gotta refuel for a bit and begin the climb.

400P 11/20 fella here
Fuck, my SQ shares are toast
Thank you!
Hold or take profits?
If PLTR hold this rally till close, tomorrow I'm expecting a pump at open.
Game over...please deposit credits to continue playing.
AMAZON GO UP YOU DIRTY WHORE GOD DAMN
Srne
Seriously considering dumping these BABA shares
20
lmao PLTR +10% today
Is RIDE the new NIO?  This stock needs to be meme’d on principal.  ‘Murcia!
Get fucked bear.
You shorted 2 calls owning just 10 shares? What the fuck why
EOD BABY DADY SOROS IS CARRYING US TO JUPITER
PLTR BABY!!!
SOLO omg
Lol that’s not even much compared to my 80% loss on BABA tbh.... I’d wait for it to go up a bit again and get out as soon as possible at this point. Who knows if it’s going to drop lower
Which industry?
Hope you fucks bought that PLTR dip
[deleted]
AZN calls would be a good time now. Low IV, you know there is an imminent annoucement and they are red
[deleted]
[deleted]
Is there a way I can make this feel more like a casino?
End of morning
 I can't imagine any time soon.
It’s making me so hard rn
\#MillionareMaker, PLTR moon
Is Tesla gonna tank again :/
pooh bear can delist baba with one phone call if he wanted to.
Everyone should get into it they have amazing clients, government, companies and their software is getting more commercial than ever and they found a way to scale up efficiently.
Pltr saves my life
It's hard AF to make a dollar in this market
PLTR
NIO sideways all day, an hour until close and then pop a few percent, after that crash harder than a brick falling from freedom tower
PLTR EOW expectation fellas?
Predicting slightly red EOD, green tomorrow then more red to come as COVID cases continue to pick up steam.
Not as good as Tesla calls
Youbought 70 60c on PLTR?
I just got here
Since all of WSB has NIO and PLTR if we just never sell it will never go down. Hold gang.
Pro tip: GNCA (T-cell immunotherapy company) has an investor presentation tomorrow. Calls are running about .05 if you are hunting for a “buy the rumor” yolo.
Mines for $430. Ez gains
Haha everyone made fun of the clown car but solo is going 🤡🚀
Net Element Inc? It says to me it's a mobile payment solution of some sort...
# Every PLTR dip is getting bought
The good stuff
This is key
Yeah, I bought an 18c 12/18 and am dumb enough to keep looking at the price. I shouldn’t be worried at all
Profit is always good, just don’t confuse bad trading habits with good trades. 
What was the logic behind pltr?
If you used that logic 1000 times- on 1000 trades would you come out ahead?
SOLO: A Canadian EV Story
#HIMX is the next nio and amd
You mean embracing yourself 🌈🐻. In normal circumstances id say good on you, But aint anything normal about betting against papa. 

🌈🐻 go away.
$60😂 jesus
PLTR IS THE NEXT NIO IVE BEEN SAYING IT SINCE 15$
I ALSO SAID IF YOU NEVER CATCH THESE EARLY THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
 
YALL ARE FUCKING 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡s
They aren't truly dead until they close up shop and Amazon starts talking about buying the properties for Amazon Pharmacy centers. Looking at you Sears and JC Penny.
Oh wow!
Daddy Elon is being very good to me right now. Meanwhile, I’m hoping my long bet on XOM pays out next year
100% can you spell collusion. 😂😂
What did you short man
[removed]
$25 per single tick up or down.. That's the difference and why you should do /NKD, and look at the 2 year chart!
Be glad you don't. This rocket is just getting started 🚀
Good earnings, i fomoed into buying at open some 190c feb, and 220 april...and its currently down hah. Hopefully it turns it around but, i think this company has a super bright future
GME is the embodiment of TRASH: Stock Version. 
Can't Win with this one.
Huh?
Holy shit PLTR $20 eow?
MUSK ISN"T ALWAYS, MUSK ISN"T ALWAYS on TIIIIIMMMEE
This is some bullshiet. Buy the dip, unless you're an anti-Science anti-vaxxer which I would hope not.
[deleted]
Bought the BABA dip. Let's go Gyna PAMP EET
$ROPE free at HD today with proof of murdered calls
Priced in
Do I sell my PLTR calls today, then buy back in tomorrow after the inevitable morning selloff?
Always manage to buy SQ before a drop, make it back to even, and sell, and miss out on gains.  Goddamn.
Don’t be a pussy, this is just the beginning
Pltr eow?
Take this W!!
I still can’t wrap my head around the GME permabulls lolol
I’m up 82% on PLTR shares
all in to pltr
Vale finally moving again!!
Wish i went deeper at PLUG down 11% easy money
There has been no real corrective action for the market since October 30th.
Can you share with me some please, doesn’t have to be money all i ask is your next move pls
Tsla
straight to Mars boys
Opened up a strangle.
[deleted]
Can’t get a fill on Baba, about to move on
Make VOLUME 100mil again
PLTR is a god send I have been saying for a few days now to buy this bitch.
I’m trusting you NIO riders sold GM for 100% profit and went in
A solid 45x would ease my nerves with Tesla
Rocket Tesla 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Goooooooo please gooooo
Baba goes down every day don't buy it
I’m annoyed. Rotation from RH to Pornhub bbl
Can IWM just fucking die
[deleted]
thanks man for the advice. i’ll stay put.
I have 11/27 and 12/4 calls, anything above 89-90 will print.
HD is down 3, DIS is flat, WTF is wrong with this shit?
back to 420
I just did too
Looks like that Left bastard killed Nio forever
[deleted]
How are your tendies printing today?
PLUG coming back ladies. Hop back in. The waters are great!
glhf
Teaming up with apple
What’s the average volume on spy?
I will definitely give it a look.
the only things that can make baba moon again is if xi approves ant ipo
[deleted]
Well profit is good so idc
Chewy just consolidating forever now haha
Probably :/ just wanted to see other peoples ideas on it
what is palantir smoking guys ?
Forgot about pattern day trading. Oy.
I just did
it better, I just made my first yolo puts play
PLTR 18 EOD
Still has a lot of opportunities might stay around 17.50$ as it will be the new baseline.
Autists be like, very surprised.
And I’ve lost 5x urs in a day lol.

For real 100k on chewy & GameStop
it's a thiel day
gave u an upvote my g 🙏🏽🤣
Wish I had some free money for ZM puts
Lyft breaking thru 40 😍
[deleted]
Don’t sleep on QCOM just broke it’s record high today
[deleted]
SBE and PLTR keeping my shit afloat rn
Ever since his Fake Punt failed against the Chiefs he hasn't been the same.
Calls on Lehman brothers 🥴
> I’m not successful (down 70%)

That is considered success here you know.
If you don't play both sides of the coin you miss out on 50% of the money.
Lol
Dont see why not especially if we start creeping towards more of that betting platform news
Soon institutional investors started eating it up, jumped in
I’ve lost all my savings
DIS 11/20 140 P
Companies like HD know a higher minimum wage is coming. They are just getting ahead of it by raising wages for their wage slaves. 

I'm going to stay tech heavy in my portfolio, with a healthy side of commodities. I'll still have some retail in the blue bloods, but there won't be a lot of "growth" there.
Watched once on mute to read. Pretty good. Then watched a second time with sound on. This was quality as fuck. Thank you.
TSLA going sideways like a boomer
Of course I bought BEFORE the dip :(
I love volatility!!
and P.S. 

Please please please! Do what you are doing with the /NKD instead. Watch how fast you make $100,000 in a few weeks haha..
Go sq go
It’s okay bro. I feel your pain
SQ blowing the top off...
Why? They’re gonna be rich
Plenty of big banks (Citi) have given a $300k 2021 price target for Beetcoin
PLTR Puts
Imagine not buying this JAMF dip 😍
100
[deleted]
yea but with just 10 shares
Yes buy every single dip of PLTR
Tesla definitely gonna start a downtrend temporarily
Why??? I haven’t checked my position since the lawsuit announcement and suddenly I noticed huge gainz lmao
Tesla thought it could steal NIOs show but Will Li just shoved his cock down Muskrats throat
Fisker just nutted on my face
🤷🏻‍♂️
NFLX
Getting real tired of your shit GME.
Thats what they said about yesterday when it was up 20% in a day smh
Bro, give me your money and I’ll trade for you. If you close out the shares( 100 per contract) you will be naked and exposed
Just say ur a communist and leave bro
It’s a reverse merger with Mullen Technologies. Mullen has two EV vehicles. Accepting preorders yesterday. MX-05 is the model. 

Merger should be completed soon
lel watch us close at dow 30k
Don’t you’ll lose money. And you seem like a nice dude
[removed]
TSLA does nothing for 2 months during a massive rally then explodes +10%...
Bigc is a pump and dump stock.
trick is not to buy the top, there are inevitable valleys to make plays on
PLTR that company is solid.
[deleted]
Getting some good gains today! Debating weather to sell or hold! 
Positions: $25 strike price expiring 1/21 70 calls!
Still riding.
they are liquidating a large percentage of their positions. If they thought the vaccine was going to work, they'd hold out through distribution. There's literally nowhere to go but up if you're an insider exec and you're confident in the product.
[deleted]
close you mean
Gay
If it could hold $17 then pullback?
No one talking about PYPL? Looks like it’s starting to moon
All in PLTR!
I holding for years, personally
PALANBROS , ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
Nice call.
But why? The Tesla news?
I have shares and may 17.5c

May sell some calls and buy some more shares
23.47
SBE is up 14% and *wasnt* just added to SPY if anyone thinks they missed the TSLA top lol
bruh i need this to happen lmaooooo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUYvbT6vTPs
What’s a guy have to do to get a few crumbs, come on man
Suppose to cut loss so imma inverse instead
the manipulation on SLV kills me.
well small drops like that will be normal, it's growing a lot, but the outcome for the company is really good so I'm not worried.
Sell now
Were you covered though?
Pltr
Probably 😂 just something I have been looking at and wanted to see if it looked good before I actually pulled the trigger with it🤷🏻‍♂️
pltr
So BABA is inversing SPY movement at the moment so I need SPY to crash. Thanks
Yes. You belong here
UPWK to 40 EOW
Hopefully a pull back so I can load more at a price not close to the ATH.
20
Anyone have like a solid 1000$ call that can make me like 3-400 within the hour
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah that seems to be the case, although the vaccine is currently the best option at the moment because it doesn’t need super cold storage
Hop on RIDE last chance
Rotation into SQ 🚀🚀🚀
[deleted]
I’m 28 😭 with a learning disability
Youre right. Most sell orders appear to be at 450 so if we can hold that it should be able to make the crawl to mecca.
SOLO gonna fuck around and hit 7 today
Jump in. Waters fine.
Fuck PLUG in free fall! I thought it was a cult
$350
$17.5 will be the top for today lads
Getting fed
15
We already opened....
then i couldnt buy a bike? like what haha
Tesla was super underwhelming today, wow. Not like the good ol days. Made my gains trading NIO again, Jesus Christ.
SPY with the TSLA logo. Cute.
Quick, make all the business units so if they split us we can keep the good ones! *business continuity*
[deleted]
All in PLUG or PLTR?
How is gambling taking power away from the big banks? lol
Probably
All I’m reading is a 27% discount on doubling down 👀
RBLX
PLTR every dip is bought. get innn
nio garbage Chinese stock went from 3 - 54 in 6 months anything is possible.
I mean I’m just assuming that 47 is some kind of hard resistance for NIO right now or something haha
[deleted]
RIP
hold
Lmao dumbass. It’s still healthy. Go to PLTR in the meantime
Nothing wrong with taking profits, but I do think that its long term outlook is really good. If you're going to hold plan on holding until at least March.
Don’t dance.

spy wants to be batman i guess, no honey it isnt october
I smell some paranormal retarded activity
lol Google exists and can explain it better than I can. But either way sorry about that. Its just another conspiracy theory that common people couldn't change if it did happen anyway. At best if you get worried, buy some real life gold/invest a little in gold on the side.
>NETE

Never heard that ticker before, what is it and why was it at 600 two times in the past???
But it dropped today on open
Scroll down in the article
SHOP is annoying af.
Inshallah
Congrats to pltr gang
[deleted]
reality
I was told TSLA & Poors was a good thing. I was told pump into inclusion date? What happens next on DBZ?
A profitable trade doesn’t equal a good trade FYI
PLTR pullback or done rallying?
NIO puts?
Imagine not buying calls for PLTR
The top is in when you see this comment
r/antstreetbets
Congrats on being down $1000 on the year lol
The OTM options seemed like they were too expensive. Wasn’t a major difference in premium to go deeper ITM for a higher delta
And pltr, you'll be set
Markets continue to soar and people here still losing their shirts. I know the feeling all too well, consider it as a lesson and be happy it’s just summer money and not your entire 401k or mortgage. Yes they’re among us :)
Yeah it’s going off. Return of its div. and got a boost. Might hold till EOD or tomorrow
Nio is gonna crater post earnings... and Tesla fucked me out of a 48hr run up....
Covid, stay away
My may calls are almost ITM
Cat landed on puts but chose calls nonetheless. This is top level, wall-street pro quality, premium DD. 

SPY calls it is
Now i feel safe it's gonna keep mooning ty bro
Just realized i bought PLT yesterday and not PLTR
I try to make 45 ticks per trade, I don’t really care about the dollar amount.
Yet I know as soon as I close my calls it will rip
Isnt NYC just full of garbage now?
lmao you do belong here. Have you sold yet?
Some brief moments of weakness had me sweating but holding the line!

If people would stop cashing in we'd be at the moon already.
Love the username
This is the way
Are my NOK $6 Jan calls fools gold?
22
Amazon makes their own pharmacy and they’re only up .5% rip nothing can take this juggernaut to the moon
Have a weird feeling $SE is about to take a major dump after relieving all of the bulls with that massive recovery
I was wondering about it. I have tons of leaps on it.
It was at 408, anyone who didn't already have calls leading up to 440 hasn't been playing Tesla at all. It's been doing the same thing for months.
[deleted]
Need spy to yeet itself off a fucking cliff
I’m in
[removed]
They aren’t people, they’re apes :)
Big money option orders in BABA have almost all been ITM lately. What to make of this? Nobody expects it to move that much?
\-27 isn't as bad as I would think. Stay strong man Its nearing the end of its sell off and when you see it resume its uptrend buy a shorter exp closer to the money to ride it back up. You'll be good and this will print my friend.
SBE 🚀🚀🚀
Alright now that NIOs dead whats the new meme stock
Had a day today on those puts!
Buy near close, sell at open seems to be the pattern.

Depends on how long you plan on holding.
RIOT calls printing like crazy.
Disney
I think a good safe play brother.
I don’t think Jack’s been heard from in a while.
This man is literally betting houses. Jesus christ
[deleted]
Probably but PayPal seems like a safer play? As long as covid doesn't kill everyone we need payment platforms?
im drinking the kool aid from Thiel and Karp. see you at the Yacht club
I believe this time if it breaks $122 then it's headed for $125
Sell enough to recoup your original cost. Then let that ride. The world is for real that tv show person of interest. And they are the company behind it.
[deleted]
This comment is 2 minutes old and already aged like milk.
I’m getting fed nicely with PLTR
20 mins
PLTR dropped 2% in 30 seconds and gave me a heart attack, but already back in business 🤑
it's literally like one tick up in price of the market sends VIX into a crater and then 10 hours of volatility make it go up 0.1%
What’s new with DISH?
I’ve literally lost 5x this on a day lol
This is one of the rare days where I *didn't* do something retarded and it's paying off
Yo why tf did AMC hang out at >$4 for the entire pandemic and now when vaccines are coming out it's at $3?
you mean 95?

I'm long on PLUG so I'm riding the wave regardless
[deleted]
Holy crap haha
For PTLR do we take the gains today by eod? Because it will fall tomorrow and buy low? or hold for the long term(years++) I’m new to this and have 50% in on ptlr
I believe that time was yesterday
PLTR GANG

[deleted]
i got it at 3.85, what is there left to crush
dildo on SOL
He's probably been Fan Bingbing'd
Pump 101
1.) Kill the volume 
2.) Dump VIX
3.) Let SPY drop & load up on fds 
4.) Pump back with 10% the average volume
This fucking dude who’s working next to me wont stop coughing and it’s really killing my PLTR gains vibe
Feeling like the TSLA bul is fuk
This thing won't go until every BABA bull is turned into a bear or broke.
Hold. Both Li and Xpeng mooned after ER. Sell tomorrow in the morning
DAMN sold mine to get in on TSLA...not going well.
Why?
[removed]
The most fucked as anyone on this planet
Nice
Most likely because of TSLA
Reptillian requires blood flow. He is a robot.

How is theta gang
same hahaha I FOMOed TSLA calls at open because of all this hype.  people were talking about “get as much as you can within 2 minutes of open before it takes off”
Our NIO will be THE CHOSEN ONE
SBE will be eating their lunch, go there
FUCK as if the one week I didn't buy RIOT and MARA this happens
[removed]
What you mean?
what's gonna go up next
Down 96% overall. Trying hit 100% by end of week. Just sold everything and rolled my last 250 Robinhood points into $NVDA 615 11/20
More are turning green from my view
Fuck the market. 

From now I’m only trading with Bill O’Brien. 

Can’t lose
Always buy under 118, sell anytime after 122. Rinse and repeat.
I sold for decent profit
Thanku
Is ride this momentum until end of the week and then roll it out to leaps or use the money to buy shares. I’d say leaps though if you don’t have much capital. 

If you have more capital just buy a ton of shares.
The fact that MSFT isn’t at 250 is just pure cap these MMs are trying to drive out retail by bleeding the stock.

PLTR is literally free money
Inverse this cat
The devil is great with money tho. I think you've been blessed.
Feb $16c and $20c here
This is silly. 

That should be an FD.
i didn't necessarily mean weeklies more so leaps and quarterlies but you're right
VBIV TRIL NETE. My account was -6k this morning. Blowing into the green now like spaceX

Just be glad you learned this lesson with wages from a min wage summer job. This is probably one of the best things that could have happened to you. People on here lose hundreds of thousands.
Cash gang just wants to be theta gang but they don’t have enough
RIOT🚀🚀🚀
I was cash gang for a while.  It got so boring.  Needed some Ws.  Got an L first day but kept moving.  In the W column again so far with PLTR. Feels good fam.
I'm also interested in this lmao
CRSR over 31
Thanks! Take what you can get!
Nah, they've been buying for weeks now
position? should i go 11/20 or longer?
oh shit!  That's a BIG RED ONE PLTR.
Just your daily CRSR run
Are we going red?! Cause it looks like we're going red :\[

Pltr make my pp erectus
TSLA in the short term has too much competition from other EV startups and VW/GM. And for that reason, I'm out.
It's taking off this morning, hold it!
It will ascend into VAHALLA BROTHER ONCE IT DOES THAT
Dear SPY,

Just give me 358.00 damn it.
Are you gonna exercise the calls or cash out?
Can spy just continue to dump for a god damn one single day
Oh okay, that makes a lot more sense. But that’s not exactly just buying and holding, that’s an involved strategy.
Thanks su herrera, volcano eruption is the DD I didn't know I needed /s
Walmart is gonna run out of rope today
Or down to zero just as quickly. I'd still take it though because either he gets 25k or he doesn't, two alternatives so that means it is a 50 50.

Is NOW the time to buy BABA??  I know many of you fellow retards are already balls deep.
#SPY just die FFS 

low volume pump bs back at it again 🙄
You’ll never regret leaving money on the table. It can go up way more and it can drop. Maybe sell some to cover your cost basis
solo is just a knock off niu inside a box
I’m up 104% on PLTR shares and calls today 🚀
My dumbass bought NIO $60C 11/20 last week... should I sell today for a loss to avoid IV crush or hold through ER and see if we moon? 👀
Squuuuuuueeeeeeeeeee
What is WMT doing actually?
That 17.50 wall got terminated holy shit...
Keep playing options. You'll get better at it and eventually make it all back.

What I can’t believe is that less than 10mil of TSLA has been sold since open after a gap up of that magnitude. Like what?
JKS has to be a buy under 60 right?
Haha CCL you're so silly get down from there
I guess boomer stocks aren’t ready to die yet.

Just buy buy buy we won't see it for long under 20$
Sell

You made 200% don't get too greedy and lose it.
I grabbed 3 12/18 17.5 calls at open yesterday and I'm very happy so far. 100% gainz already is this baby going to 30 by next month??
Isn’t this the first week that institutional investors are even allowed to buy PLTR? Is that what a DPO means
Meanwhile i’m just here with my hard earn money from frying nuggets waiting for the next meme stock
That PLTR up almost 10%.  Getting some gains.
They are special points when you post lots of political stuff.
Buy AMD folks, this daily chart is straight porn
Go off King
Glad I stayed away
Hedges my pltr calls with 10 17p 11/20 lmao im scared
I closed my put credit spread this morning up 57%.

It worked pretty good to sell then buy.
AMZN is being such a bitch lately. Goes up, but can’t hold. I know the second I try to play a condor on it it’ll have another 7% day and fuck me over.
BABA, listen to me you little shit, they can't abduct all of you.

Fight back. You let Jack take the fall. It's time for a revolution.

I'm so negative on all my TSLA plays, I don't know why I keep going back for more.
Looks like NIO’s gonna be trading sideways
was looking at SBE for  a week and just didn't pull the trigger. Scared money NEVER makes money autists
soon?
100 bucks x 1500 won’t buy much. A parking space in a global city. Maybe a condo in shitsville USA?
if pton gets to 105 today im buying a bike for my gfs bf
I mean, it's making me a bit of money but I would have a lot more if I bought calls on those stonks instead of the ones in my YOLO account.
Why so deep ITM?
had to roll my PLTR covered calls. FEELSBADMAN
Yes. Or Jan 15
Not bad, congrats!!

Exactly it's the same thing, PLTR is strong and will go high, that kind of company is here ot stay.
Juicy
Reversion to the mean. Prior to the pandemic the company was a cash cow. The optimistic outlook is that in 6 months the vaccine will take care of a majority of the cases, the pessimists think it will take over a year to get everyone vaccinated. Both outlooks are not that gloomy.
With an expiry date that close, I'd sell.

OP, you made it into r/badmathematics. Congrats. You really are an autist.
Bet hold it is
MM’s squeezing CCL
Cautionary tales? Ban.
Costco with the “bye bitch” dividend to celebrate Buffett selling.  Hilarious. That old fuck is probably livid at missing out on the $10per
Your comment was by far the most helpful so thank you!  Unfortunately didn’t get the $35 but managed to sell for $28 after my sell order failed to fill the first go round (opened at $33 and almost instantly dropped to $28) still profited big time, originally picked that up for $3.40

The $16 seemed a tad high (but looking back probably would’ve filled) so I set a $15 sell limit that filled immediately at open.  Originally bought that contract for $1.70.  

So overall a great fucking day! Godspeed fellow autists!
But that dickhead is not restoring balance

Rather die like a tiger than live like a puss
I mean, I bought at open, so it's already a discount
Maaaaan this guy comes straight out of a comic book
gimme some dd
Got it. Thank you. So essentially as long as the stock stays below $55 from now until Friday I'll be good. And even if it's above $55 on Friday, they'd have to be exercised anyways, right?
literally just bought them, I'm going to need a cigarette
 Break out of your gd ema TSLA

plsss
Its fair though. The drop today was a big overreactionn
Trash joke
Yea I’d hold

Oil to the moon! You think a red day can hold us? Ne I say!
when should I buy in on BABA it seems to be dropping and not stopping
Bruh, you know how high  nio would have to jump to make people's calls still profitable after the IV crush? I got burned holding through earnings because of that before, ain't no way I'm letting more autists talk me into holding and burning through my extrinsic value when they don't understand that
So you're saying there's a chance
Congratulations on the gains
Haha
Fisker was a share buy last week. Options trading on that will not do well unless you buy leaps
They are going to watch either way, they might as well see me enjoy my yacht.
fuck right!
Anyone else got January $14c on PLTR???
what the fuck amazon
If it breaks 17.50 it'll touch 18
selling cc’s was the worst move I have ever tried
Take me
quality DD
Surely someone here has a “China Cry” inside scoop on BABA
Um, not fucked. Just exit if you don’t like the position. Sounds like you’re a gay bear in hiding.
Haters gon hate
Buy XPEV it just dipped
MONTH AGO THEY SAID BABA to 330... why 😭
+15% to down -20% within a half hour lmao

Idk how much longer my heart can deal with this VXX/UVXY rigged ass bullshit.
Not today
+520 on my only NiO call
Almost bought baba calls last week. Glad I avoided that onslaught of dildos
How did you recover with 100? All options i see cost multiple hundreds? Did you buy spreads and shit?
Do you think it's a good idea to jump on PLTR now or wait for a dip?
I'm new to options and I bought $500 worth of PLTR $17 Nov 27 calls and I've basically made 2X (wish I'd bought more but I bought PLTR shares with the other $500). Is now a good time to sell? I know that there is time decay in the price so I'm not sure if PLTR can keep up with that at this point.
I’m upset
Sell puts and wait to get assigned
It matters when you become a bagholder 😂
What a fucking ride! 

This is only the beginning too.

Literally what I said bro. She was mean to me anyways

I FOMOed a bit too early but I bought a TSLA leap so not worried. And the thetagang in me made me sell a call against it - so I may have sold a $500 FD to some degenerate here.
SOLD
Ahh I still remember all the retards here shitting on PLTR when they IPO’d. But tHEy’Ve NeVEr TuRnEd a PrOFiT lmao since when does that matter

Is the spin off merger a good thing?
They did similar offerings on Aug 12, 2020, and Dec. 2, 2019. 

The percent of the offering remains about the same.

The Dec '19 offering left them low for about a month, but in ~1 month were back even.

The Aug '20 offering recovered in the following week and almost doubled in 2 months.

However the momentum rn is retarded, and if they use this new capital for an aquisition, it could trigger another rug pull.

Your position will turn from Covered Call to Naked Call (aka the hail mary YOLO).

If you keep the option without the underlying stocks, life will begin to be a lot more exhilarating.
Yesterday Soros and other big money sharks dumped millions into it.
TSLA roulette today. Buy a call or put and see where it lands

Market is completely red but VIX is dead. No fear in the market this shit will bounce hard tomorrow
Sold a bit of it once it got over $17 letting the rest of it ride
yeah but could be a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze or anything, really. they still absolutely fucked overall.
Why? It’s just getting started.

Any news driving movement on the coin?
Cheers. Right there with ya. 🚀🚀🚀
Absolutely agree, there is no way this does huge spikes every morning like it did this past year once everyones eyes are on it. Though with that being said I think it'll become more of a slow burner where it goes up slowly as more people look at it via the index.
Very well I heard

Maybe 18$ EOD?
Depends on your timeframe. I love the vehicle
Any basic finance book will characterize these last couple months as investment characteristics similar to the dot com bubble. FOMO, ignorance and false sense of security. There will be a dip, maybe not as bad as March!
**Tesla is the first company in the world with over $21.31 billion in short interest**
Buy some lottos but I wouldn’t bet big
Shoutout to my PLTR gang.
Damn dude. 

Yoloed like 80 bucks on a TSLA option yesterday, sold for 1700%. Bought another 50 dollars worth of RIOT calls as another small "fuck it yolo" and now its up 433%.

Why can't I ever go all in on one of these lmfao
Another dip coming pltr buy in
Thank you 🙏
I have PLTR shares. Should have day traded a shit load of $17C weeklies when we dipped to $16.80 smh
Rkt hold or sale?
would that give me more tendies?
PLTR talks going well.
You're not wrong. Sweet joke this morning btw
MMs are at huge loss due to gap up of TSLA today, so they are going to keep the SP below the opening price as long as possible to kill all the calls bought at open so that they can minimize their losses
jesus christ thank god i sold my FSR before that far dump
Nio is just a knock off Solo
Yeah, it fisted me too. Turns out you prolly shouldn't bet on fake cars 😂
generally, whats the best range for options, weeks? months?
I’d do it but I’ll have all my tendies on NIO

Impossible everyone knows what to expect if we lockdown. Vaccine next year. Bears in Shambles.
lol dont take profit they gonna be 100
lets just say way I spent orders of magnitude more on organic plant based products. Similar rush to scoring on weekly options and no emotional baggage and STDs
I just bought my covered call back and sold my shares right at 20. 

My average cost was 11.50 so I am happy.

Edit: will buy back on dip

JWN to $20 please bull god
whats the numbers at?
Looks like we got some head and shoulders on nio
any of u retards buying the dip on PLUG? or am i a retard to think that’ll be a good idea.
Never started, probably won't.
I might buy a scratcher or two,  but I ain't being against a trend
i mean were they extremely out the money? jesus, for 1/10th worth that had to be like a 300strike leap or something insane. also the 52week high for arkk is 106, so i think you LITERALLY bought ABOVE the top. mustve bought a super high ask price @ the top
GME back to $9 soon, what an unfortunate set of circumstances. Only this garbage stock would plummet on seemingly bullish news from a hyper-successful activist investor. Shameful.

Pltr is my first ever play. Starting to feel cocky and will probably lose everything i win with this.
Not too late if you buy shares

FSR finished?
Wtf, I love Soros and mass invasion of privacy now?!?
I think I saw some random R said no yesterday too
Why not exercise them?
Bears everywhere want to know which soup kitchen to get in line at! Stay tuned to find out
lol
The problem is you are comparing the price of leaps to the price of weeklies, when you should be comparing them to 100x the stock price. Another nice thing about leaps that you can’t do with weeklies is you can sell covered calls as long as the date is closer than the leap, and the price is higher. This can give you 1-5% gains on premium every week, depending on the stock and the risk you are willing to take. Even if you lose money on the leap, you can still come out on top with the weeklies.
PLTR up 10% yet my straddle unchanged. Friendship ended with PLTR. NIO my new best friend.
BLKN to the MOOOOOON!!!!!!
Lol my value stock is up 37% on my 300 shares...started this position in AMTD in June before SCHW merger...stopped adding shares in September. My shares are up a shit ton. You guys should do value investing on the side of options. Value stocks I’m accumulating now include IBM and INTC

I wonder what it would take for BABA to go green. Another rock star "farewell" concert to his staff?

Not I Spartacus
You mean those 47.8M shorted shares?  It's going to be amazing
I love when NIO shakes out all the paper hands. Then does a v shape recovery
BABA will hit 0 before 261 imo
This will haunt future Cyber-Elon one day... if $TSLA and $PACE isn't valued for 2500 until then across all his colonies and the slum formerly known as planet Earth.
Right now I’m loading up on shares that I don’t plan to look at for a long time, and riding the weekly options of its volatility

SBE with the sudden rocket launch. Now do I hold my shares or sell and buy on a dip?
good luck...whales gone...this is SnP inclusion not fcking nippon games - I am sure they are set up to not let any more stoopid pumps like we saw earlier happen once in the index, that is bad for business....hope you get your pump to the moon but i'm not putting $$ on it
Holy volume batman
Honestly who would be retarded enough to go long at these levels
Bezos = thanos. Look what amazon is going to do to the pharmacy retailers 😆
I think I'm going sell half of my 16 $15 calls and exercise the other half around expiry

The election was two weeks ago?
Yeah I'm putting a pretty big bet in on TGT hoping for great holiday guidance too.

TGT is clawing back up to its open price which is a good sign. If it can be green at close it should be mostly good for us.

I'd like to think that while the news on October retail was bearish that this is a natural sell-off of the sector and then get bought up again over the next few weeks. Especially if stimulus talks heat up again (lol)?
Holy shit I sold my CCL puts at the right time
Wild ride
PLTR you beautiful bitch, didn't let me get more shares under 16. Take some profit bois
i'll always respect an exit strategy
CCL puts now!!!
When +10% isn’t good enough

Do you ever think you clicking that buy/sell button is like a butterfly flapping its wing, which later gonna cause the shitstorm in the market?
Where’s that one guy saying buying SOLO puts would print?
Buy high sell low you’re doing it right
More retard strength than Chinese EVs!
PLTR 8 green candles in a row on the minute i'm pumping my balls so hard
ccl 20 eod
BABA $1,000 within 6 months and $2,000 within a year. You heard it here first
PLTR will have a strong run up to lock up expiration, small pullback to kick off weak hands, then parabolic to 100+ by end of 2021.  

Mark my words.
Did SPY dip?

Yes = buy calls

No = buy calls

Two bad bitches at the same time
That meme with the ugly guy on the phone saying "DUMP EET," except right now he's saying PUMP
You understand that margin requirements are a thing right? No need to waste capital on maintaining a basic long position when I could increase my position size while daytrading. Not to mention the fact that the past 3 months have been one of the best bull runs in a while, if the market dipped right after you entered long, you’d get absolutely assraped because of how much margin you get on futures. You also should take into consideration that if you have a long position, you can’t go short at the same time for daytrading, you’d simply cancel out your position and go flat or something similar.
Why??? I was hoping it would hit 10 million, there goes my dream.
Low effort
Hate to say it but a slight sell off/profit taking was very probable considering it jumped so high afterhours. Should go back up over time though. Maybe. Who knows.
So how many people we still got in here anyway? Like 15? I imagine the past several weeks wiped near everyone out? Can I get a rollcall?
Pltr leaps
had a BA spread I was having trouble selling.  So I bought the short end then sold the long end.  Ended up losing ~80% of the value in the process lol.  Lesson learned, just lower the value of the spread dont sell it manually
Fuck that’s genius
Most probably 30$ EOM PLTR will be much needed in the future.

I was so into my other positions i finally got around to spending too much time this morning trying to figure out where 12 VTRS shares came from in my portfolio this morning that are up $200. 


Its from a PFE spinoff-merger with some other company that generates some new shares overnight.

ubelievable my 18c bought at top volatility pre earning is getting less red...

I actually sold nio at the dip got damn
Buy PLTR, you won't regret it, the company has immense potential, everything is data driven now and we need more and more companies that can take on the enormous amount of data companies and governments are producing and make sense of them. PLTR is a hold for the future, we'll need more and more of their services to comprehend the complex world we are living in!

retarded spy dump. this market makes no sense
I guess I wasn't clear, I only made it 30 minutes into the first hobbit and then I quit when they started singing and dancing around the dishes.  I was asking which Hobbit it was from.
Hello PLTR paper hands weaklings who sold at 17 and hoping it would drop below 16.50 to buy again. Enjoy your FOMO
God ol IV Pump
Was eyeballing it under $10 but chickened out.
I'm out now but pm payed really good over the last week or so.
SEC can get these nuts 🥜
TSLA just needs a few points over opening price to envoke a huge FOMO rally.  I'll check back in later, see you on the moon boys
So when will SP500 include NIO? This or next week?
What did you get it at?
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

Because You can do other trades around the longs you hold and make money off of them while they are going long..

Like :

https://ibb.co/z2wQ8J7
I made $200K on Pinterest $45C when it jumped to 68. On 11/6 I parked 100K of it back into Pinterest $65C Jan since I'm very long on the company.

That Monday the PFE vaccine news came out and my position tanked down $70,000. I didn't panic due to the rotation away from tech because I believed in my PINS thesis and held through and now I'm up.

That's all
Why is this not stickied?
Lmao classic spy V shape
Closed my puts for a loss and bought some calls. God damn it feels so much better holding calls. Who gives a shit if stonks are expensive or not. They go up!
Sold WMT calls at open, bought back weeklies on that dip.
NVDA gunna moon, hold the fucking line
Its not a high five emoji anymore, it used to be, but it was so overused as a prayer emoji that they kept it that way.
Hold
Not one to play during the day unless you have puts on it.  Otherwise best to play UVXY overnight since IV is typically highest at close/open.
When there are massive green days there will almost always be a pullback in the next few days. 

It'd do the same thing if he mentioned it or not.
FRIENDSHIP ENDED WITH NIO. NOW PLTR IS MY BEST FRIEND.
Finally I'm in profit. Bought load of shares at 16.7 last week. Smh. Learnt my lesson about buying before earnings
[deleted]
GameStop honestly looks like it’ll be back to pre COVID prices soon
BTI up up up
Any more juicy TSLA rumors left, or is it all about execution now? Maybe the Biden green energy plan?
COTY been nice swinging the day trade.
Holy shit SBE
I’ll be selling at 48 today
Anybody else load into BA this morning?
Anyone buying NIO puts right before close?
How many peeps got burned on Tesla calls this morning
BABA you utter piece of shit
Scooped up 500 more shares of PLTR 🚀
[deleted]
$NIO open $60
If you have to ask this group of retards, you can't afford to hold
spy drill continues in exactly 9 minutes
Yeah, time to buy more.
Pltr popping off
keep buying it's still relatively cheap for how strong of a company it is.
Enjoy tenders
TSLA will die more after hours when NIO reports inflated numbers and says the chinese consumer is preferential to domestic EVs and they're confident they can be the market leader against other chinese manufacturers. The money will roll out after hours to fuck you and you'll miss the NIO pop because you probably sold those calls after getting slaughtered today on that end as well. 

&#x200B;

good luck boys XOXO
RKT is another one where shares probably aren't a bad choice, especially after homebuilder confidence today
NVDS bout reverse and crank before earnings
goddamn API railed me. but dodged a bullet cause 80% of my call orders didnt fill yesterday..
[deleted]
Nice
[deleted]
You deserve it for betting against PLTR and Theil. This is mooning over the next year. 

195 shares
5 $15 calls which I plan on exercising for the shares.
Fuck. I had an order for 500 shares of PLTR back when it was $12 and it was $0.30 away from triggering
[Jeff Bezos is definitely laughing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ_DyimkS54).
Yeah it gave me autism long ago
You sure?
CCL showing impressive retard strength today.
NET are you okay buddy?
its because VIX futures are horseshit

just play actual vix options
400 exp 11/27 might sel later today
PLTR just keeps sucking 🤤
[deleted]
I can only add text to vids
did you read the year? yours seems way more aggressive
PLTR MOONSHOT
[removed]
I wish I was the guy that made price targets. Just pick any stock, double the share price, call that your new "price target" and then buy a fuck ton of calls and retire. It's so dumb
BABA bear is the only one left
All retail taking a hit because of bad October retail numbers (worse than expected).

I think this is good for TGT since the bad news is behind earnings.

Earnings is before open tomorrow for TGT/LOW.
Better than me, stuck with boomer stock (GE) that's still -25% after like 2 years. Strongly considering dumping this garbage and using it for something more useful.
Muhahaha
if u arent in PLTR what are u waiting for? this shit is about to NIO
so now that TSLA is in the S&P500 will auto drive fluff and fold my laundry too?
It'll go up in long term
Just sold my PLUG 29c  11/27 so expect it to go up
You sure?
meme stonk
I think the vaccine news is really backstoppping travel. When it used to gap down back between March and until the vaccine news of the past 2 weeks, travel would CRUSHED down 4% at least, usually more. Now it seems to hold up better.
It’s gonna be fine my guy
$PLTR. Bought 10 $13c at .15c. Sold 5 at $16. About to cash out the rest right now.
[deleted]
Take
When is BABA $2,000?
Hold LEAPS and actually exercise them when the time comes.
All PFE options become PFE1 options. You can still sell tho, I actually sold for more than my options were worth yesterday somehow.
Pltr kinda overbought
It rhymes
Before you know it Amazon is gonna have it’s own island and government
WMT 160C 11/27  


Free money
You better buy that MFer a drum
Idk if the timing is right, but I definitely expect to see $500 before EOY
Hold
It can't until all shares issued are sold. It is pretty much pines around 22.5-23.5
Buy more it won't be that cheap for long.
Boomers be buying apparently
fake spy pump
got wmt calls, not sure why it seems like nothing can stop it
I dont know why everyone is saying "tsla why" like it didnt just gap up 11%. The fact that it pulled back 1.5% should be expected. And seeing as how it didnt dump like 5% this morning it should be expected to go even higher eod. This isnt rocket science this is wsb bro science. End of the day inverse this and go puts; Ive got calls that'll help them in the long run. This is the WSB way.
I expected lazers to shoot out of his eyes after taking the pill
Amazon will literally take over the world within the next 50 years. The future is basically bound to become like that game the outer worlds. Or maybe it would have if Trump had won. Damn
Fam what are you waiting for? Ofc
I bought 11/20 far OTM last Friday after it crashed from $54 thinking it would recover quickly lol. If we can't break $47 convincingly today I may just hold closer to expiration and hope for a gap up tomorrow or Thursday.
Anyone else experiencing some weird ass shit with Pfizer ?
Shit can turn and snap your neck at any moment but I'd hold.
Yep always taking profits, especially when doubling money so quickly.
check da pic
Puts 👌
Always take gains on puts and look to re enter on a bounce
hold pussy
holy fucking PLTR wtf
Buy more PLTR train has not stopped, company looking good.
Uvxy is the fucking worst
How do trump tweets so effectively call the top lmao. It’s every fucking time
Fact-check: untrue 


https://www.counterpointresearch.com/china-smartphone-share/
SPY bull trap
Not doing coke is a valid play too
Sell now if they expire Friday. Hold if later.

This IS financial advice.
Means you buy
pls god
Today will break my 10-day green streak.

Good to keep my ego in check though, I was letting the 2% daily gains get to my head.
It has to be manipulation surely, CCP maybe?
That’s tough
It just wants to go up
Vale being very cash money lately.  Too bad the DD for Vale gang was early but not wrong.
This is the way
Sell and roll to longer dates
This SPY pump is both travel (airlines, cruiselines, etc) and tech.

makes sense
yall cant really be convincing yourself with that NIO chart... gravity is in the front seat with this one
here's a gift to you, MCK  now if you believe that over 70% of population in US will take a vaccine, mckesson knows all the channels of distribution necessary to get this passed out... it's cheap, very cheap imho.  i know the industry incredibly well...  they'll also charge you and me a premium for ensuring this is out to all the hospitals, cvs walgreens, etc, this is what they are good at....
very fake, bigly gay
BTI dip over soon


Thx PCG for being always green


Thx tesla for the $$$
Soon everything you buy is from amazon
Roku breakout 👀
Nobody tell him bot pls
when the fuck is this thing going to pullback its going full Elon
What time frame are you trying to play? Get some options a month or two or and let it sit! You get to reap the benefits of the big green days (albeit not as much as you will with weeklies) while also not having to worry about wiping your account if you hit a red day 

That’s what I did with NIO during election week and still made like 200% returns with options 2 months out
take 30% profits on spy puts or hold? 361p 11/20
well look at pltr moon
I got $4.50s for 12/24 a couple weeks ago when it sank for no reason. Very pleased
take profits. you can always jump back in later
Getting? They’re way too big already. They can bully any other company into submission. Prob donate millions to lobbyists to get away with shit. Don’t forget they own some media stuff too, can always push propaganda if they want too
[removed]
[removed]
sell and roll out to later dates or buy shares
That was a Nice time to average down uour NIO calls
[deleted]
Square set up is looking strong
How you feeling this morning?
Plug selling a bunch of shares lower than the monday close price so it tanked, dont see a pump to 30 happening dude
At least post the ticker with this small street bets shit !!
Can we all agree PLTR is the only ticker that this retarded sub unanimously agrees shares is a good choice? When ask about shares of other tickers, can they be eaten?
Take the gains man, it’s up 8% today
You know that sinking feeling you get at the top of a rollercoaster?
Keep holding longer dated PLTR calls or take some profits here?
🚀🌑

That’s just a shocking decision to sell
Same boat. Hoping mrna stables out :(
Puts puts puts on CCL it’s about to tank again
Nio to the fucking moon sucking a spoon tough as a goon
I cannot understand it, given it's 2 week chart. Hasn't had a green day in 7 trading days, and is currently trading in a 50 cent range on 4 million in volume.

What the fuck is going on
It's funny because his name is NIO
You pay for your own beer at home?
Very close to ending my friendship with investing.com

Hope y’all bought DKNG
Might sell my PLTR shares at $17 and just start selling puts to bring my ACB down.

You should stick to counting pills, because your math is not correct here.
If my Jan NOK options hit I'll diffefinetly look into it. Just need the calls to pay off for the capital to start that.

Sold the 45 weekly calls on the DKNG shares I had- only to watch it moon and the call got 30% higher in like 10 min
Need NIO to moon before earnings I’m not holding through
Fuck bought Tesla at open and now tanking 😭why god ..why
what broker are you using?
Stocks I like (and own) ATM:

PLTR

ah the good ole reverse IV crush
It’s trying it’s hardest!
Ssssh don’t let them know that
How you feeling man? I’m getting very nervous
For some reason I've always despised them as a company but I could not agree with this more
But...but..papa elon did that?
i dont know the process in any detail, but the rebalance will happen next month...one (or more?) SnP entities will drop out and tsla will move in. Prior to that time I suspect the big funds etc will demand a look in detail at the books and ask a lot of detailed questions before having to buy in once its added, after all they represent their fund participants right? It should be harder to buy off so many all at once, and for sure he can not hang up on them as he has done in the past so lets see where this goes.
Correct
Drilling to the center of the Earth (down)

all the way through to China (up)

BULLISH ALL IN GO
Open up NIO weekly option chain. check out first ITM call. IV at 250%. Slowly backs away trying not to make any noise as to alarm or excite the volatility
Omg NIO Mars mission fuck the commission it's limited edition
To the earth's core.

I can't believe no one else saw this and realized I was fucking with them omg.

Wait till Tesla cools off pltr is still the play
Consolidating, good stuff
Good job not being a retard and selling at open.
I took profits and bought some calls at a higher strike price in case it goes nuts
Tesla wants to moon so bad.  Hold the line
TSLA why
Haha nice.  As someone who constantly loses $$ being greedy (me) I'm glad you actually made a good chunk!

I hate holding limit buys/sells overnight, but congrats.

Christ somebody feed NIO some LI+XPEV juice please, need a moonshot
Generic? Bitch we doing the same god damn thing as them. History ain’t no meme. Growth has been dying since 2018, globalization is going down (this lowers future profits), and the debt is historically high and unserviceable. Ironically you should be looking at longing emerging Asian markets and Japan and sell every US market rip. 

Set a 10 year reminder on this, I fucking dare you.

Fuck no lol Tesla gang is to strong
So Amazon is in healthcare, ev, pharmaceuticals, not to mention aws. This on top of their actual shopping platform. This is a company that is getting too big imo. At some point it’s gonna start to hurt the consumer

3 days of trading on NQ
#guh morning
There is one TSLA bagholder who have not sold at open coz he was hoping for 500eod and then break even or even some gains, but now getting cucked.

And he is reading this comment.
who the fuck is even buying CCL rn?! shit needs to plummet
bezos will make it happen. Amazon prime will come with your choice of 5 adderal or 5 xanax a month
My puts getting fukt
I went from down $70,000 on Pinterest last Monday to up $2,000 today. Fuck you vaccines!
God Lindsey Graham is so ridiculous
Wtf NCLH?
Can they stop stonks going down? Or just bad guys
Noooooo CCL what are you doing? Can some newspaper release an article about how retarded cruise stocks are so boomers stop buying?
Same bro
They being a bitch and not giving dates but it will be before the end of the year .. date has not been announced
But what usually happens is the stock will go up up up up up up up if I wait for a red day. Red day usually never comes until the stock is already stupid high
PLTR seems like a good long term buy, but I’m a little sus at my ability to profit in the short term
[deleted]
I bought a call so it should.
Oh No! RAIL is tanking!
SELL THE DIP. 

Don't fall for the trap.
This SPY pump is fake and gay.
Yeah my point is we’re in the middle of the sell off that everyone here is trying to time. We don’t know that we’re not going back down to $420 meme price EOD. I’m with you for $2000 2022.
Any news on IPO date?
Still recording lol, say hi to the camera
2/19 $50 BOIIIIIIIIIII

Rotation out of tsla and into NIO for earnings
Why is TGT options down so much? Earnings is AH tomorrow right? I understand WMT earnings affects it but I thought it was not bad. Not sure why TGT would take a bigger hit than WMT after WMT's earnings  


Anyone?
NIO we have Xmas presents riding on you, time for a hulk Dick! Thanks
SOLO
WAIT. This is a test to see who has balls. & a little patience.
PLTR let's gooooo 🚀🚀🚀.

Buy Far OTM calls for maximum 💦💦💦

PLTR is the perfect Russ Hanneman play.  They are involved in top secret NSA level govt contracts that they're not at liberty to disclose to investors/analysts due to national security concerns.  The future surprises will have you absolutely raw.
Don’t think it will take long. You should set the reminder for 6 months.
Honestly as much as ppl hate it here, it’s an asset that’s here to stay
you jinxed it
Anyone here hold weeklies for longer than 5 minutes

There's no doubt about it, I am ready to hurt again.
Yeah it started Dippin a a bit so sold. Used the profit to sell NIO puts
I got a weird feeling $PLTR is going $20+ EOW.
I live in FL, lol
spy gonna be 365 eod lol awesome to get cheap calls
True. It’s staying above 17 right now, I bought OTM for an average cost of 0.50 (70 calls)
wtf is CCL trynna be green?!!??
any reason to think it won't dump
Classy
Buy then sell

But never sell then buy
$420.69 looks a lot cleaner.

SPY inclution was priced in a long time ago.
Be greedy when others are fearful
Either bread line or caviar
NIO post-earnings predictions ?

CHARGE
Just sell them now
I’m not selling, I haven’t gotten in yet

Nio going absolutely bonkers titty tinkers put on the blinkers
Almost all Asian metro cities use motorcycles/mopeds for transport.
First one in a while that I physically laughed at.  Of course it’s daddy Haupt91
Day trade some options I’d buy in soon retard
Buy when it’s red, not when it’s green bro
Lmfao fuck the downvotes. You literally have the internet right now, anyone could have easily googled the song.

In fact, google voice search will actually fucking listen to the song for you.

It's okay to not know the answers to everything. It is unacceptable to not have the willpower to even try, or know how to find those answers.
Then again, it's a fucking tiktok, so the kid asking for "SONG?!" might as well be 14 years old
sell covered calls next time.  best of both worlds.
spy continue dumping pls
More "hope" over a skinny bill that won't pass. These mf got dementia
Good luck. We all at wsb are going back to Tesla. Join the bandwagon and make yourself a quick band while Tesla on the morning dip.
Any profit you greedy whore
I keep selling puts on it and am getting kinda sad I'm not getting assigned lol

Should've held the shitload I bought at IPO for under 10
dow 30k tmrw
Any BIGC holders here ?
Fuck it fomo’ed into Tesla ... INELONWETRUST

Gonna get crushed after earning today. Good or bad.

IDK last three days was down, flat, then down again today...plus with earnings..? I hope I'm wrong but not hopeful.
Biden replied he wants 3T
spy pump or dump
Thank you dad
I love how all the bears calling Tesla down. It's testing the lows of post market... duhhh. 1Hr view. inverted hammer coming your way!
I was told there would be tendies
TSLA going for the logo chart again
[deleted]
Learn how to turn it into a spread to lock in gains retard
Yea sold got scared it was dipping I gotta take profits
Green by open
Yeah but no online drug shipping company does sched II drugs as far as I know. If the pills get lost in the mail, you can’t get a refill.
NIO is back on track 📈
Very cool ccl
So y’all are gay as hell then?
[deleted]
generic buying the dip gone wrong example from 40 years ago? lol, not sure if relevant
This is seriously well done!
Aim for 300 same time frame
My fellow gay bears. A circuit breaker is immanent. Just keep hitting the sell button
[deleted]
God damn, I’m so pissed I sold my PLTR shares. I had about 1000 of them and paper handed from 9 to 8......
Averaging down my wmt calls. Hope i dont regret thus
What’s the whole bagger talk mean
Same I bought 15 of those at .64 this morning
My body is ready for this.
I was gunna buy at $15 but bottled out. Meh I'll leave my buy order in case it comes back down
I put $2000 in 💩coin, chilling in my coinbase wallet two years ago and forgot it existed. Best fucking investment decision.
Hold, it'll break resistance.  I'd say it could reach 20 EOD, but it'll most likely do that over the course of 3 days.
Is there a discovery process now? I'd have figured they would do that before deciding to add them.
FNKO moving boys get in free tendies
The funny thing is I actually slept in that day too and panic sold at $47 to buy back in at $48... I am bigly good at this game
NTES is the earnings play of the century. Premiums are dirt cheap.
yeah spys going back to 365, bought calls easiest money in my life
You need therapy.
Calls it is
Should i buy NIO? I am a bit scared of tommorow, any opinions?
Tesla wants to moon so hard

Ya, I’m a pussy. ATM 2 weeks out isn’t autistic

You think the electric motor is magical or something?  I'm not wrong.  Transmissions used to be the equivalent, in manufacturing terms, to the battery or motor.  Now they are contracted out.

Same thing will come of your magical mystery components.  They will become commodities.
Hold
$TSLA 694.20 EOW
A) Just because it happened to you doesn't mean it happens for others, even a majority. In fact, it doesn't happen to most people even in your (our?) age range until retirement age. You have a very narrow world view.

B) How old are you that you have more than $2M in your account? What was your starting point? How much did you invest total? Did you get lucky and buy stocks like Apple and Netflix only? Were you around during the early 90s and early 00s when people were saying Apple and Netflix won't survive? I remember that. Do you realize you got immensely lucky with your stock picks assuming you picked stocks that returned literally over 5,000%? Do you realize that (assuming what you say is true and that you still hold Apple), most people would have sold after a 500% gain (and probably less than that)? It's a very simple logic here:

1) Do you realize that most investors on the planet make around 7-8% annual gains? Do you at least realize this simple, basic statistic? I assume you do.

2) Now, do you realize that most people in the world do not and **will never** have more than $10K per year to drop into investments? Good, I assume you do.

3) Do you math? [Calculate](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) how long it would take to make $2M after tax for most people, assuming even a 10% annual return. It comes out to about 32-33 years. And when that happens? 2% annual inflation kills your $2M, because it'll be worth $1.2M in today's dollars.
Elon Musk got fat titties we don't mention that enough
I’m proud of myself for not fomoing into TSLA* at open

Tesla trades flat and fucks over calls and puts. Nice!

Might buy a Nordictrac with my PTON short gains.

My calls, they hurt

Tsla giving me ptsd fucking hell
Good enough for me
garbages like gsx will get killed by this
Bulls were dancing on ice yesterday
These CCL puts better print...
I made a post about it. Mods deleted it. Was pretty easy to see.
happy bday
I'm guessing this is one of those days where I just watch everyone else have fun as I wait for the market to pick a direction. Half my list is green, half is red and I'm not flipping a coin
Profit taking on TSLA over.  Moon mission from here on out.
Obviously man, he’s taking his time to come out of the closet

 yall think i should dump this for a lower strike? 

# BABA $320c EXP 01/21/22

  
bought yesterday so only under like -5%
Minimum to make everyday $$$?
they launched a pharmacy, it's why cvs and walgreens are down big
Either that or new ones are coming in. Either way, there's no shares left to short and we're near 12 dollars with only upside from here. Not looking good for them, even if only a few million of 70 million shares short cover that sends us up a decent bit
Fake v-shape. The recovery doesn't come until 99% of bulls have capitulated.
Is that a serious question...
company has been dying for 5 years... why would you buy in the first place?
Me selling an option for $200 profit: Well WTF am I gonna do with this, retire?

Discount on BTI this morning
Tesla small dip was expected for the weak to take some profit. Back up we go
What's a zooomer
My PUT Spread hopes so
Fucking gme bro
me too bro
Who doesn't like stinky pee
alright thanks a bunch
Profit taking. It'll go up, we just don't know when.
Did I actually sell my NIO Call FDs at the top like a boss for 30% profit? Still have some FD puts so let’s get it
OK don't go to 17.10 PLTR

Just don't fucking tank either cause I bought at the top
Sorry mate, ifvyou didn't get on at 11 or 34 you miss the train
Same lol
11/20 expiration . Bought 8 yesterday for an average of 4.50. was down 15 % on the day, which led me to just hold. cus usually short term options will have u down 50+ % in a day. My limit sell executed at $42 10 dollars above what i set it at hahaha
Well, you better decide because either you will come out hot and the hoes will love you, or not. Greediness will set in. Either settle for 300-400%, risk another 5%+ pop for 7-800% or risk it dropping 5% for break even. No one knows the future ..
RIP my FSR calls.
Everything is shutting down after thanksgiving. What stocks do you think it will effect?
Good point! Yeah my next position is $4.5 12/18, that got pretty healthy the minute I bought so I'm gonna sit on that a bit (despite the volatility today)
Whose hopping on the tsla fomo train with me
Markets at a high when Corona is also at a high.
why an app if you don't mind? i'm assuming because the web UI isn't mobile friendly?
I bought the dip. Now save me Mr buffet
no one seems to understand this
[deleted]
bro it makes me so mad seeing it dip down from 120 every fucking time
Get back in bb there’s room for everyone on the NIO 🚀
NCLH is about to be green what the fuck
If Tesla falls to $425 I’ll legit double down. I’m way to young to not take a risk and hold this slut into December.
Remindme! 400 days
Draft king new price tag is 100 guys . Hop on the train now
Aha. Make sense.
To the guy that posted this morning saying he had 50k worth of se calls.



Hang in there man
amazing friend
What can I say? I love holding options in stupidly overvalued stock and then not even checking on them!
It’s 10am where it matters

Don't kid yourself. It'll be at 250 and you'll still be back you gambling addict
winning, winning, winning
We must be patient for tendies. Tsla 500 eow.
You son of a bitch, I'm in.

420p 11/20 1.80
Weak hands on NIO just sell EOD
I would close those if you had any sense. Its going to the moon. Just testing the lows of post market
Wait what??
well at least I bough TSLA long and not calls...
I only have 200 shares avg $15 for now. Will wait for a good time to load more
Go buy the Japanese dip in 1987 and report back your findings.

Just tell me which buttons to press in Robinhood to make money happen
I'll tell ya when I'm out but mine aren't hot yet.  Need a little more for my orders to sell.
BABA BREAK OUT I REPEAT BABA BREAKOUT
PLTR is easily a 3 bagger within a year, don't be a degenerate and buy some shares
im in the same boat
every day that stock is a BATTLE. I'm playing some under the radar stuff right now, like DDOG, FVRR, ETSY. Names that were loved during the August craziness tech rally but left behind
REALLY AHHHHHH
It’s always interesting seeing first hand the different financial instruments between the two continents. Fintech is huge in Europe just not brokerages yet?
Gracias amigo.
same fuck, lmao
I was promised $500 EOD $600 EOM help help help help help help help help
A LOT harder
It’s still a rumor smooth brain
People are taking their profits
Fake dump. The rug pull doesn't come until 99% bears have capitulated.
Airbnb going public . Gone drop a grand or two in it

7:10am checking in
Lmao I just bought this 😂😂
DIE SPY DIE
Either 🤷🏼‍♂️
ZM has a negative outflow for like the last 10 days yet it doesn’t fall
Was a 415c expiring next Friday. That’s not really autistic 😂
Sell the news retard.
Give it a second. This was an expected dip. The fact that it didnt dump tells you this shit is going up higher EOD
I think we can forecast a stock dump based on the number of memes about that stock in this sub. PLTR is next.
Y’all are too worried about NIO. $50 EOW
When can fsly break through it last high last week
Why is CRNC drilling?
Goddamn WMT fucked me
i have money set aside... im talking about buying the dip
Why PLTR... i wanted more time to accumulate
[deleted]
Someone explain to me why tesla isn't going up?
A true autist sleeping in at market open.  Grow some hair on that chest big boy
I was a bear on PDD back in June to August, who would’ve thought the stock would nearly double from then. I’m done trying to predict which stock would fall off a cliff, this market don’t give a dam about fundamental anymore.
😂😂
Just pass the damn stim you old farts
DKNG GET IN NOW!!!
Thank you, people like you are my favorite type of people :)
Winter is coming

Hop on SOLO now. Remember I told you!

MAXR GANG WASSUP
This discount was enough for me to come out of retirement.

Plug $20c 1/15/21
It gaps up over 10% and you want more?? Dude this is better than you could have ever imagined it being at expiration much less in one day.  Take profits dude

Or at least sell half
PLTR everything under 20 is a bargain
Highly highly unlikely
i figure they will really tear them a few new ones .... everyone has to remember they can be DE-listed as well...in the discovery process they may end up knocking it down under 100B mkt cap, if all we hear is accurate
Now that the announcement has been made Space Karen and his flunkies can jerk off to their tendies. Stonk will probably collapse in 2021.
Lmfaooooo
this is the way.
OF course it does, unloaded 600 shares a week ago...
+13% my penis is fine
More like last week's gains wiped out.

I was lamenting selling my position end of day thursday. If I hadn't I'd have held through Friday and Yesterday and would've lost my ass today.

Still bought the dip for 2021 calls.
Buying tesla calls............
Vaccine is known to exist. We know what stocks do well in pandemic and what do not.  We known vaccine is out next year. We know what earnings reports will look like.
My 17$ puts can’t print
Bagholders who bought at the top finally can unload

Company is fully valued for a while
I got a feeling tsla will crash soon
low support trendline is holding up well at around 292 on QQQ we're going to push to 294 ATH resistance trendline and retest that today
So what time is Nio earnings out?
Everyone agrees Tesla manufacturing process + the critical components is essential to their moat and general success. If you think outsourcing manufacturing the car manufacturing + key component is the logical extreme of outsourcing supply of the brakes, then you're wrong, and that's exactly what I intended to point out.
V shape NIO incoming get in now
Bought me some this morning.
A boy can dream.
Looks about time for a stimmy talks update
Gonna need SPY To dump a little harder plz
You bought it on this dip? Lol it’s about to go back up to retest 460
That's the problem with these transparent boomer stocks, they give it all away before the big event.

PLTR will save us all with secret government contracts that they're not at liberty to discuss!
This market moves lik shit
wait for $440 TSLA, then buy the shitoutofit
First time?
It usually ends around 10:30
PLUG?
Of course you are .. don’t know why you even did that dude

2022 calls? Damn that’s really far out
Yeah this works really well in a historic bull run, but many would argue were at the top.
Its crashing lol
Stop giving all the other retards hope. It’s not very nice of you!
$410p here
God FSLY if you break through 80 after that wall that was yesterday. Keep eating
PLTR back to regular scheduled programing
Amen lol
All you retards and your NIO calls before ER! Thanks boss
Rule #1. How could you all forget so fast?

Papa Elon giveth, and he taketh away
Everyone said IV would make TSLA calls bought at open worthless, but good old fashioned price action will do the trick
BABA closing around what $260?
I'm not even in NIO but I'm rooting for you guys!!!(long and short)
Just did
Its repeating early 2020 with uncertainty (minus vaccine talks, but thats still at least a year away to inncoulate enough people for it to have an affect) IMO. Spy going back to ~300 one more time before its all over.

I'll only get in SE at 165. This stock doesnt hold 175+
It's hovering around 0.53 right now.

So stop panic selling and just hold the god damn stock
Sold my puts for a loss and spy filled the gap right after hahahahahahahhaahhaa
you'd be buying the biggest top eva bruh. These markets are gonna stagnate for at least 10 years (inflation adjusted). Debt levels are too high, insolvencies coming.
yikes bro i hope u sold em at open
I'll be back if BABA hits 300 by December 18th, if not it was a pleasure!

It coming back don't listen to 🌈🐻

It’s just taking a breather. Watch it blow through 460 in 30 min. Wsb guarantee

Told my parents to buy @ $130/share. Didn’t listen.
Which direction
Look crackhead, car manufacturers used to make 100% of the car.  Since the early days, they've moved to more and more contracting.  Tesla also has followed this trend.  NIO just took it one step further.  It's easy to see to anyone but crackheads that this is the future.
I think March
Good luck Chief
stop buying BABA weeklies you auties 

buy long term calls or sell medium term puts

AMZN winning the pharmacy war because you can compare discounts on their site.  Like the difference between using and not using your insurance.  Just went on and signed up EZPEAZY
Yes it is
Naw 💎🙌🏾 over here boi
Out of my weekly $4 for .5
ARK is going through a hostile takeover and Cathie may not be in charge anymore
P*^$$y
Congratulations to you bro!
That’s the only nightmare stoping me to jump into this stock now.
Okay theta man, we get it youre rich.
TSLA is part of SPY now lol
Here comes face rip recovery back to open
it hurt itself in it's confusion
This isn’t pre split TSLA up 43% on puts so far 🥳
Sold 3/4 at open
[deleted]
CRSR and SE dips looking juicy rn
Can’t sell options after hours.
We are SPECIAL. Remember that next time you get made fun of for drooling or shitting your pants.
So much for buying PLTR... every time I want to get in, it’s at ATH and if I do get in, it crashes. If I don’t, it shoots to the moon and I regret not getting in every day
Oh god what the fuck is going on NIO
$1000 to throw into options, what would you do?
Imagine selling puts 😰
[deleted]
Wait... did people actually think Tesla wasn't going to dip first?
Makes sense, though that vaccine DD says otherwise.
SPY to 353 EOD
Waiting for a Palantir dip intraday and buying 10 17c 11/27
Me too, lol.
Well played! I suggest you take some time off because that seems like a big adrenaline pump
🎈
I was promised TSLA moon
I may be fucked
PLTR looking so fine
Congrats. Now fuck you
It wasn’t worth while? But here you are arguing with me.
Bought a handful of 400p bc why not
Switched from Robinhood to tos and now I think I actually care about my money
Dude relax
[deleted]
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Looks like I’m either having 0 dollars or Tesla is mooning
I just checked out their holdings.  I'm going in!
Of course not, that's why I'm here.
Literally checking the comments to finally decide, haha!
Makes sense
$SE with the mega fist in my ass
Nice and short. No confusing charts. I’m in
Dude it’s been half an hour
Clairvoyant
Clarification-- he specifically mentioned young traders' obsession over the stock.
SEC ain't doing shit for months, weak hands will let NIO go.
TOK KEK
I feel bad for gay bears. They're out here just making money once a week and they're like little kids that want to show you their retarded drawings when they're done with them
this is my moms account. dont get more WSB than mee

Cross your fingers

Good thing I hedged with my day job. Guh
Omg market crash. This was we been expectin
Yeah the time to sell that was yesterday AH; making some money today on my 11/20 $410p...
tsla is what a meme stock does
NIO shaking out the non-believers😂
Can pltr just break past 17 already
After a slight dip to 30, nio will bounce to a modest 60 tomorrow.
them hush-hush tendies hit different
Gay bear gonna be a 🌈 🐻

Why did robinhood give me $900 of viatris? Anyone else get that?
No stimi
Chucks riding with the chadbros
Anyone else in UNVC? Up 577% for the year
Fuck you baba you piece of fucking shit stock Chinese garbage
That was pretty dumb
Pics or ban
Nope vaccine prevent that. Before it was too many unknowns.
Why TSLA fading? I thought everyone gonna fomo and 500 eod?
Before*
SPY 350 EOD
Good move! PLTR is a strong company.
PLUG $24 EOD
**covfefe**
same might as well
who got TSLA puts at open
Nice day trade. Tesla is all over the place. Time to scalp puts and calls
I'm a socialist and I don't think stocks are the best way to redistribute wealth, since it's literally capitalism. I trade stocks, but I'd never brag about it in front of my socialist or communist friends.
If you buy a call and sell a put is your max loss what you put in? Where’s the max profit lay?
**RIDE** American NIO
PLTR tendies are cooking 🧑‍🍳
Going to be implementing sports betting.
Time to load up on BA
Teasin us hardcore
It is a given before s&p500 inclusion.  >\_>
i hate these days where SPY is clearly dumping but it has some sort of retard strength and takes all fucking day to drop 5 points
TSM
Tesla about to rocket hope ya bought this dip
BABA rejecting very hard to be green, just like how girls rejected me.
I’m just waiting patiently for my puts to print.

Kindly requesting CCL < $16
What's the main reason market is down today? Cases up? Barely missed retail numbers?
I love asparagus
We have the vaccine it’s over
I know you didn’t buy anything Tesla with just $100....
im about done with this shit, give me one reason to not throw 100% of my 401k in to ARK leaps on the next red day
Yeah, delta will change relative to the price. You can use gamma as an indicator as to how much it will change. Underlying goes up $1, your option's movement is delta + gamma x (underlying price change), at least as an estimate. Getting the greeks down will stop you from entering positions that don't move significantly enough to warrant the risk of losing your premium.
You sure you're thinking about stonks?  I'm pretty sure they only go up.
Do I baghold PLUG or do I pull the PLUG
NIO $40 Put

DUMP TRAIN LET'S GO
oh oh ho ho ty tsla tyvm...and thank you phony momo chasers....beers on me , have to drink em here thou - this week only, cheers!
man hit a 8 bagger today , with the last 4k of my bank account . sitting at 32k today sold those tesla calls for YUGE profit
Link to that Denver hospital?
I swear to fuck if we close at $420....
How do we actually know that? Their 6-K says  the financials are un-audited. Could we be looking at another Luckin?

BTW I'm bagholding a June 300C
Do I doubt my vibe 😳
uh time for spy calls?
confused investors rushing into safe havens like ACB
Only true autists would buy FDs the morning after a stock already jumped up 12%
BABA's chart looks like a fucking penny stock.
I’m actually getting raped
Papa taking back tendies ?
Wow bro the only things that make Tesla significant apart from the actual manufacturing process are all they make? Exactly the same as NIO that makes nothing. Great analysis downs syndrome George Soros
time to diamond hands this TSLA bitch. FOMO will occur this week... im so sure of it that im willing to remain poor for it
Yeah dude I really doubt it. I’m holding for earnings because I’m too deep in this anyways. Can’t believe I slept in the day it goes to $54

And today a lot of FOMOers got zeroed out.
When is their lockup period end?
ZM gonna breakout today. Gimme them shutdowns!
Oh NIO baby what is u doin
Nope it’s priced in when it hits $500 (long term holder)
TSLA looks like it’s rotating into Robinhood users cash accounts
Where’s green 🙃
Haha you're right. Don't know what I was thinking when I typed this out after a few bourbons last night.
Lmao autisms a hell of a drug
IV crush, only buy if you day trade it
holy shit NIO dont ruin me
will NIO rebound after earnings?
Oh TSLA you dumb twat, wrong way
Lol I wonder how many people here bought spreads at least.
Ok boomer

Ban
Sell the news lul
And Then??????
Anyone else think PTON is a good buy at 100?
TSLA rotation into AAPL you heard it here first
Give the 411 on PLUG boys. Does it keep bleeding or bounce back tomorrow?
[deleted]
Watch Elon betray you again by issuing more shares.
What are the odds we see spy sub 300 again? Lockdowns, covid exploding, etc.
# BUY SPY CALLS NOW ?
I am selling you guys some puts :)
TSLA deffo gonna moon
I think it’s more likely that it will consolidate gains than keep pumping, yes. I would wait until EOD at least to get in
the only thing up more than TSLA calls right now is..

Walgreens puts lmao RIP get cucked by bezos
What's with the semiconductor stocks? AMD NVIDIA
Would the real BABA please rise up
Most probably near $17.50 ? It's already on its way.
It’s went up very wildly . Their guidance should be top notch to go-up or maintain the price. 
Now it’s a guidance play not earnings beating play.
Retarded and gay
Found the Mormon
Anyone have any ideas on what PLTR will do before the lock up period ends and what will happen when it does?
I said fuck it and sold all positions of bio and gme to put it into pltr
today i learned stocks go down too... not happy about it
Nice play. Take them gains when you can mate
Like clockwork, trump tweets something about stock market doing well, it dumps the next day
Stocks waver on coronavirus concerns.
same here. i jinxed it too
I can sell you some :)
its like a magnet
[deleted]
I bought a call, sorry
Ever since Tesla and I broke up and she started talking to SnP ,she isn’t as wild anymore. She boring and different and just stays home smh. Anyone else see the change? (No -200 instant loss in 14 seconds)
He may have got in at +12%
I thought NIO expectations were to hit $50 lmao
[deleted]
IMAGINE BUYING TSLA CALLS AT OPEN
Always. It will never go down for long. 100c 11/20
Dumping NIO lady for cuter, younger PLTR
Solo isnt
Wtf shitcoin at $17k
I’m trying to find something similar to robinhood but for europeans
A costly one
All speculative.  They don’t actually get added until 12/21, but once those index funds start buying the shit out of it...
lmao
I got a few NIO 45c set for 2023. Not fucking with that stock anymore other than that. I’ve made a good profit from it, time to find the next one
Its down for people who bought into today’s hype. Like me
Oh god oh fuck
You think it’s over?
Get in on Twilio ASAP.   They already have the contract for NYC Contact Tracing.  If they get a national contract or a few other major cities, could be huge.  300C 4/16/21
yes. S&P target of 200
sold all my NIO positions
Okay BABA Fam, 

The investment case I see is "BABA has great financials, they're earning money. The only problem is the CCP might crack down on them and their ability to grow, especially since Jack Ma offended them." 

But when I check their 6-k all the financial forms are noted as un-audited. How do we know we're not looking at another Luckin?
omg that bullish engulfing on PLTR so horny
“Prolly safe.” - a guy who has done nothing but lose money for 4 months
Why TSLA 🥺
Time will tell. But I am rooting for you bro
Plus500 shittiest platform ever, my Tesla 420 calls are conveniently frozen at yesterday’s close price and are locked for trading. Wtf
RIP to all the tards who picked up TSLA 500c FDs at open
If you‘re not buying the dip you like asparagus
I fucking hate TD ameritrade!! My account never fell below 25k but they put me in day trade equity restriction...
Very cool very legal
Remember
why the fuck is TSLA dropping
To reiterate someone below - NIO baby what is u doin...
There has to be an equal amount of sellers so I don't see why it has to. And at a certain point a stock will go back to it's worth based on earnings and future growth. Trading at almost a 900X P/E is ridiculous. TSLA back to $200 in a years time
Moderna calls?
The second I get tesla calls it dies hahahaah
[deleted]
I swear you autist are really something else... putting $12,000 on calls options expiring next Friday. Talk about the stars and the moon aligning for your trendies.
NIO and TESLA are done
[deleted]
These NIO premiums are beyond retarded
Bikini
Should’ve bought 1000 shares of PFE then yesterday. This straight up seems like free money because I didn’t lose my position at all
Anybody get random shares of VTRS?? What’s it from ?
Lube up NIOphytes
The dow what?
The coin!
When you go to bed with an exit strategy on TSLA call and hold anyways 🙃
they're expected to beat
[deleted]
Please ACB🤣
Oh I get it, I sold my NIO calls for some nice profits too but the latter makes no sense why wouldn't it drop too. Guess it's just a little lagging behind hopefully.
NIO will still end the day at $49.  Don’t worry and don’t panic sell you paper hand 🌈 🐻
Retail sales were abysmal
Jesus Tesla
Webull, I don’t recommend it.
NIO drill baby. Drill!!!
300 EOY
Where’s the fucking bottom
Is this why NIO is tanking this morning?
December 4
Almost exactly.
Based on your posts, we don't really disagree fam... His REASONING is fine based on the data provided, but he assumes that the data cannot be extrapolated to the real world and that the transmission rate is the same in the general population. He is an idiot, but not for his reasoning only his deductions from that reasoning.
Imagine being the idiot that sold at the bottom last night.
why would you buy a NIO call at open
idk i took profits then bought back in. 700s dec 18th
its at 17 rn, u think itll drop over 50 cents?
What do I buy now
Yep, they were green until it went below 455. Guess I shoulda sold
I can’t believe people are actually still buying ccl stonks
[deleted]
Purchased a 4$ put. Hopefully it goes burrr
You and me both
yea but ACB is pretty solid play lol im not just saying random shit. if you watch the markets you know how it moves
Did Cramer just cause the dump in nio wtf
rip nio. you guys were jerking each other all night about how it would open at $50
At least you’re not mad. Good on you
you guys got some more of that V shape?
This is just a healthy rotation to stable stocks like ZM, NKLA
NIO was so fun until you retards ruined it last week posting non stop memes
PLTR did... nothing after ER lol
oof went from 184 at open to 175. Man I hate/love this stock so much
What the fuck james bond movie is this? Ripped straight out of thunderball
aapl gonna be consolidating til 2025
Depends when it expires
Now NIO is negative is this so fucking stupid
TSLA dip
52c 11/20 at this point I might as well
PLTR and SBE turning this year around for me
[deleted]
So Tesla gonna go back to 455 ?
I understand Jack needed to be edgy and speak out against the guvment and shit, but come on Jack, read the room. You're in China. Facepalm.
What kind of pitbull is this
Looks like NIO and TSLA bulls got killed.
[deleted]
what spy dumping to today
**How we playing BIDU boys?**
What platform is that?
>Tesla

>Fundamentals

Pick one
Same lol
You're overlooking something
someone poke BABA with a stick or something
Whoever bought SE for earnings I feel bad for u :(
we're only up 2.5% time to panic
you mean $453 was not smart?
[removed]
Which stocks you wheeling bro?
Nio wtf
Lol tesla sp inclusion was priced in like a year ago
Hmm maybe Tesla calls at open was a mistake ...
Hold SPY 11/18 $350p till after JPOW speaks? Looking for the bottom to sell and buy into TSLA
[deleted]
You're a little late to the party but luckily for you it's just begun.
Who bought into PYPL on that dip?
If he does the next dozen GM ads will just be Leo smashing lines and fine af hunnies in Chevys and Cadillacs. If that happens I’m gonna use my house as collateral to YOLO on GM
$TSLA on its way back to it's home at $420
You just cannot buy anything for 3 months
$16.50
Was hoping for a nio run so I can buy puts. 

Oh well
Am I stupid for not taking profits on Tesla and holding ?
Whats going on with NVDA with earnings tomorrow
Nio you foggat
After earnings
TESLA WRONG WAY
I bought a NIO call at open and it is not going well
lol.. TSLA and Chinese EV ADRs are the same chart right now...
Good move, PLTR is a strong company with ties with a lot of powerful companies and governments.
What is wrong with Tesla?
Why is market red >.<
[deleted]

If you missed on TSLA get on BLNK.
Very cool FCEL, keep dying
[deleted]
That’s a massive return on that, sell you greedy bastard
I just watched my $600 Tesla profit go to -100 now!  Better retest 460 again
What the fuck moderna
Onward to 18 knights of PLTR
Somewhere around $17 slowing climbing
[deleted]
Glad to say I'm not touching the dumpster fires that are EV today lol
Why not
Don’t do it
More NIO calls? Just dipped red
PLTR about to 🚀🚀
Usually there’s a dump with Nio in the morning
Lol tp brain
[deleted]
I am 95% PLTR
it jumped 40 overnight, and market has barely been open for 30 minutes. next jump we'll be hearing the same fomo stuff, as usual.
What’s so different about it? It just seems like a streaming service like roku
I could make a trillion gazillion dollars if I could time the market
rip nio i’ll rebuy at 41 again
i mean gigayachts do have minisubs, so yeah :P
Yeah, its like losing 1k, what's an additional 100 on crack and hookers right?
NIO puts are the way and then calls after ER no emotions!
It's up 9.5%...
realistic pltr eod?
You mean PLTR you retarded fuck
Why is all EV getting murdered right now?
Meaning ...
Be there or be SQ
Why would you hold? You think they earned any money?
Not good
If you didn’t get in TSLA before today. Don’t fucking touch it you apes
are my SE February calls fucked?
Profit taking bro
Don’t you dare !
China has copycat software or websites for everything you can think of. Twitter over there is Weibo. YouTube is Youku. Google is Baidu. WhatsApp is WeChat.

Works the same way for Shopify. They will use Baozun or some other ripoff, they will not let a Western software company be dominant within China's walls.
Here’s the Tesla dip to shake out all the retail traders
Totally. Works sometimes
Because it's nearly everything in the car but the three major components.  The battery, motor and computer.  90% of the car is contracted out?  It's not complicated....
Seriously though bulls can you just let us bears have one -5% after this face ripping rally? You can just buy the dip after
Wow. WhT a ride
[deleted]
Up 37% 🤩
Buy buy buy PLTR buy Palantir. While it's still cheap.
the latter
Sir i do not think you understood my post... I said I finally made profit... sooo that means all I do is lose my ass 😉👍
Two actually thank you very much
bad day for china?

IQ down 15%

PDD down 5%

BIDU down 4%  
NIO flat, going red it seems 

luckily I only fucks with BABA.
just bought some
Uh.......*allegedly*
FUBO retards. Get in.
bird in hand is worth 2 in a bush don't drink the koolaid here and chase the mooon
Friendship with Nio terminated.  
Now Elon is my best friend.
Pull through amzn. you can do it buddy!
oui
Nonononono fuck fuck fuck
Did my part, I bought into it just a bit ago
Why are we red? Are we back to “coronavirus numbers going up”?
MUSK ISN'T ALWAYS ON TIIIIMME

Walmart December 18th $160 calls back on track.
Any reason for ACB to moon? Thinking bout loading up on 11/20 6.5 puts
[deleted]
Cough ACB cough...
I think I'll be smart and not hop in tesla. No one knew about the move yesterday and buying at the top would be idiotic
Not too hard with these paper handed gayz
Imagine buying into a 10%+ TSLA pump because a stock joined an index that has absolutely 0 to do with fundamentals 😂
Lmao
NIO falling and NKLA rising, makes total sense. Fuck NKLA
Thank you very much
Lol yes
Come on back down TSLA. You know you want to 🐻
MAXR. Tasty.
I may have drank too much of the NIO kool aid butt fuck it, we holding through earnings.
🤚
okie dokie
$550 EOW
11/20 $420 P @ 2.00

GME 12C 11/20 SPY 364C 11/25 PLUG 22C 11/27 SNAP 55C 12/18
Right now I hope 🥺
likely, yes.
Can you imagine being a fund manager forced to put hundreds of millions of dollars into a regulatory credits company?
How are my CVS bros doing today
About dam time. However I do believe wall street banks and Chinese commies government will do everything they can to stop this going into law. If this becomes a reality then gay Bears will go wild on Chinese listed stocks.
Rip
Lmao watch NIO do a v shaped recovery in an hour
Shit I guess I better sell now
👉🏾😏👈🏾
I’m gonna shit on you
Fucking SPY is gonna bounce hard every 20 fucking cents all the way down
Should I sell AMZN, CRNC, SPCE, SOLO, and TUP and put everything into NIO?
Going to announce a stock buying before 60. Take profit
Wow did I just sell my puts at the bottom?? Turning off the phone for the day 🤘
Wait. Paper hands leaving
>Like a dynasty of bitch ass bears, that are slowly getting softer.

Yeah. It's called the human male.
The IV is so high no one should hold through it
Lets go BIGC tell em what it stands for.
F
Hold she’s going to 480, market selling weight rn
You specifically responded to a comment that said NIO wasn't even building its own cars saying it was the future lmao. Clearly the substance of that is that you're saying it's not a problem that NIO isn't doing anything like Tesla's vertical integration. Otherwise if you were only talking about brakes and wipers why would you respond to an unrelated comment...?
Spent two weeks being super disciplined while scalping only to lose 90% of it this morning. I’m beginning to think I may have a learning disability
After your options expire
S&P inclusion was such a bull trap. Fuck me
has anyone tried entering a bunch of low bids and hoping the order gets filled? Assuming it never works
Be honest. Who here is actually holding their positions through NIO earnings?
TSLA = bear trap
As soon as you sell it will moon. Literally ha happened to me so many times on Tesla lol.
someone call pelosi and tell her to get on the phone with mnuchin stat
So the market dumps then dies. Cool day
no way
Theta gang has successfully allowed me to quit my job, I can finally focus on school only. Bless up.
I’ve started adding a ton of shares and am deciding to not look at them until a year or two later
hahahaaaaaaaaaaohgodwhy
Don’t get caught up on FOMO for BLNK, cause it’s coming
only in the USA . MF FREEDOM
Bought a TSLA 460c at the top. Time to watch it burn
I think there's a decent chance.
Yep because the shit will not hit 500
What's the catalyst for this dump
$75 EOD
well, if you're only up 20 or 30 % or down 50%, hold, if you're up something stoopid, sell you did good.   so you missed out on huge gains, aint going away after 2020.
Its going green, red, green, red, green, red. Boring.
If you have a big brain and not a smooth brain, the move here is GOOG. All these companies will move their operations to GCP.
if you bought 10$ acb calls and 5$ acb puts expirign a month out.

you could probably make a 10 bagger on each if timed right
:|
Don’t worry, just don’t stress out about positions, make sure they are safe and just chill and put a stop loss if you want
We buying SPY puts on the fake pump or?
Profit-taking seems obvious when TSLA jumps more than 10% and the lot of you still bought in
when’s this NIO er mooning gonna start
Pls pls pls
[deleted]
Dw bro I got your back
I grabbed some shares and end of year calls myself
Terrible fins, major dilution, burns cash like the joker. The stock going up shows you a lot about the market right now
There’s no monetary penalties for it right? It’s just a restriction on trading? Cuz I need to force myself to take a break from the markets.
Honestly is everyone holding through NIO ER or you think there will be major sell off
Perfectly natural V, nothing to see here.
does that mean the shorts are doubling down on their positions?
There’s the SPY V
Why am I overtly confident with the capacity to diamond hand retarded big $$$ plays but scared to lose $5 on a small play I actually put forethought into
1 day 425?
So do I sell my 11/20 500c TSLA now for a 50% loss that I bought at open like a fucking idiot
Lol no
A little too late for many of our brothers
What in gods name r u talking abt
jesus that was a violent bounce back up on spy
[deleted]
That Denzel one from the Flight movie is what made me join this sub.  The content here is fantastic.
Nio does this every time bois it’s chill
Ok Elon take us to the moon on your giant pee pee
Puts on Netflix. They are canceling The Office in December
Especially when the stock price adjusts for it
Algos straight up will not allow a green day on BABA. This shit is probably going to continue until December so they can buy shares for nothing.
Will Nio be going 60+ or down to 35 hmmmm
I waited till now
Gonna be no stimulus or ubi.  Divided government means no help or harm coming.

Sold my spy puts too early fff
I was not in the money but I sold my position. Bought at 2.73 sold at 8.20 (x100).
BABA leap
[deleted]
Fucking warned y'all.  But no, the dumb train gets rolling and folks forget what puts are.
If you make a fourth day trade in a 5 day window, you get marked as a PDT. 

If you make a day trade while marked as a PDT, you will be restricted from opening new positions for 90 days. You can still withdraw money, and you can close out any current positions that you have open
How do we expect NIO reacts to earnings?
NIO is the cheapest it’ll ever see again
WMT to $155 by EOW or nah?
I feel your pain this morning
Still kicking myself for not pulling the trigger back in March
I picked up some GDRX stock because it was down 20%. If I had some balls I would have picked up some calls instead.
Just read that Tesla is not joining S&P until December 21. Thats a long way to go
weak hands shook out of PLTR
Huge buy wall at 46
grab em by the pussy
I’m gonna put my legs behind my head and let gravity, or whatever it is, peel my bhole walls from each other and endless fart allllllll day
TSLA gonna rip now that I sold my calls, that was the shake out wasn’t it
Green 0.00%!
I did
Profit taking
Facts. I was going to hold out on buying a weekly until it calmed down, but with only 80%, I jumped in on the first dip
"was"?
It's about time
If you hold for more than 2 days you won't
No gf but you’re more than welcome to have my shitty ex.
Im with you there buddy
I think S&P is priced in, so this pump is just retail waiting to get dumped on. And I think there will be a small correction from yesterday's overall market pump dragging it down over the rest of the week.
Carrier too, who was said to be producing the refrigerated trucks for the vaccine.. No reason they should have dumped today but for inversing Cramer. Was not expecting that.
Dumbasses NIO gang... the goal is to breach 50 today
gay bear alert. gay bear alert.

LOL
Good idea but gains already dropped to $2K in the last 10 minutes.  Crazy!
Who got $500 Tesla FDs at open?
Then theres me depressed after losing 20bucks
Wmt 👀
Pltr hold above 17 pls
I bought an 11/20 500c two minutes into taking a shit. I’m down $100. I should’ve bought an then wiped. Mother fuck...
I need a thousand dollar option that will make me 300+
WMT is really about to be green lmao
Just resell it. And get a PC bruv
I might yolo some calls, but scalping this bitch is fun in the moment. Lots of money to be made on these swings
NIO calls?
Who here has the balls to short Tesla?
I got May contracts for $10 and $17, I think breakeven at expiration for those combined is ~$17, probably unload them March/April whatever the price is then. Also got shares that are like $14-15 that I'm going to let ride long term.

Otherwise I'm kind of bearish on the market in general cause of election and COVID drama.
For real. 92$ calls fucked me
[deleted]
Putting 100% of my portfolio into PLTR. Fuck it.
And just like that... PLTR is dead! We had a good run though 😔
wrong way tsla..
NIO getting sold off with the DAQ
[deleted]
You know how everyone is talking about their "calls" and "puts" when they obviously have one contract max
RSI and thinking that vaccine news was a fake pump for the market
Ok Tesla there was your dip people
Spy puts
PLUG will definitely go below $20 EOW
That sounds like anything but surely
Baba giving me a seizure
Thank you God for crashing SPY 🙏
Bought PLTR shares at 16.93, hope I don't regret this...
u better be right
I’m pretty sure I got IV crushed on TSLA within the first 30 minutes markets been open
calls on O'Doyle
NIO what the fuckkkkkkkkkkk
HOLD THE LINE
Yes yes and yes. All the DD I have is amazon and Walmart hold a fuck ton of shares
TSLA PUTS EVERYONE
Uhh.... No.  No way that shit doesn't pull back first
[deleted]
Wtf plug?
[deleted]
That’s probably a smart move. I’m just holding 11/27 and 12/4 calls through earnings. I’m weirdly confident based on LI and XPEV earnings but also scared
Good news is I get my PS5 today. Bad news is SNE has cost me multiple PS5s today
Sell FCELL
TSLA is basically milf money
will my amd puts going up?
RE: NIO  


Since valuations on EV is pretty arbitrary at the moment, it's hard to come up with a scenario where it drops materially on earnings.    


It's like, what multiple do you apply to it? No one knows since 1.) it's all a bet on the future 2.) TSLA, the  bell weather for the space and stock from which all other multiples for EV are derived, just tacked on 10%.
I mean we just dropped $6 since I posted this, but what do I know.

Edit: $8 and continuing to drop. TSLA winners bought last week.
Did you make any plays
Bezos is a piece of dog shit. I wish the absolute worst upon that bald child eating fuck face. He destroyed my cvs calls
That’s the point
Universal basic income and stimulus will carry the market for another 6+ months, then the collapse.
I hope yall didn't FOMO into TSLA at open...
this is why you don't buy calls at open.
FUCKING GO WALMART FUCKING GO  GO GO GO
Yeah
30 minutes
Zm stop playing games with my heart
This drill looks like the real deal. Repeat, this is not test. The next month is gonna be bloody AF.
you can tell a lot about a day in the first 30 minutes
Holy shit this is such a good day
With all my money stuck in stocks and calls, I now realized the genius of War Games.

The only winning move is not to play!  Would have lost bigly had I have the money to buy more stocks.
[deleted]
I’m out.. cashed at $49
What are your positions rn?
77% for some 500 calls not bad
No you forfeit everything including your gf to me
I don’t touch Tesla
Now is the time for TSLA calls.
TA says next support is 244-252 so I think the sell off is close to being done. What do I know tho all I do is lose money
holyshit I just saw BABA positive .07%
What breed of dog is that?
Lol. Closed my puts for profit. Tried rolling profits into calls and accidentally picked up more puts. Fat fingers.
The rise of all the LOTR memes is cause enough to be excited about PLTR.
RSI was high, shutdowns are happening, and that fake vaccine pump wasn’t gone hold.

Didn’t kno Amazon was gone help too
I bought some yesterday, stock falls $0.48 and I'm -$2 a contract 😔
[removed]
What’s up with PLUG? Long term hold?
But it's just "potential gains."
AMZN kills CVS... amazon up 1% 😂
My SPY 360 puts that expired yesterday love this 😪
I swear rkt was green at open
You mean paper hands?
NIO $40 Puts you fucks!
Spy 11/27 calls, hold or sell
[deleted]
So can anyone here get NEM up to like $70 by EOD?  Please and thank you
I know and thankfully I'm only shares, last few weeks (outside of GME) have been bad for me, probably just a personification of subconscious stress with these comments.. thank you
BLNK is the new wave fellas, get on while it’s cheap
Shares sure, don’t buy fds
Why are they garbage?
I get restricted like every two months lmfao
I'm buying 1dte far otm calls on SPY, i keep buying as it drops, hopefully I'm correct and we rocket to a +1% day or rip me
It's been going up a bit and back down for a few days after. So Nayak I bought ACB puts.  It's like a dying person,  the death take as they get enough oxygen for the next minute and keep dying,  rinse and resist,  but its a downward trend
You mean paper
Weed stocks pumping again
It opened up like 12%, what did you expect?
WMT 🚀
Ready to let him move into the house?
you can sell but cant buy
[deleted]
Congrats. Sell now haha
and yes it's bullshit, agreed...
I think Donald Dump was never invited to the *rich person steal money from poor people stock market club* so he still thinks the market is legit
Nio, up 2400% this year and is UP 2% today, is dead. True.
go to the bathroom
Looks like 🥭 indicator can lead by a day.
Patience
Because the cars are really awesome.
GME shares available to short went from 2.5 million to 300,000. These retards really just love losing money huh
This didn’t age well
if i had a dollar
Buy PLTR while it's still time, won't be that cheap for long!
Not bad odds compared to cramer
Cool thanks
Up $50? If you got cucked youre an idiot
We are all sitting here with notepad and a #2 pencil....ready to YOLO!
Can I dm you my venmo account? I'm autistic enough to have a whole institution to myself
Yeah, it was a trap
Cron $9c 12/31 this is the way. Come on sleepy joe! Do it for the pot stocks baby
BABA, wrong way bitch, go back up
Wsb legend
Anyone else grab 11/20 500c?
There are a bunch of 🌈🐻 trying to short NIO this week, they going to lose. Don’t listen to their gay shit informational warfare here and elsewhere. Fuck those motherfuckers and 💎🖐. Give these bears ptsd they won’t forget
I’m gonna be writing options on that sucker for years

FSR kind of fucking me but I have faith long term
[deleted]
Lmaoo rip
TSLA’s little Chinese cousin is still having earnings today let’s not forget
Admittedly I've never been there. Are you're saying that in China they aren't allowed to have their own stores on shopify?
It went up like $50 AH, lots of people profit taking atm
Yes you are right. They take back all shares that were loaned out, leaving the shorts fucked
Even ACB up today lol, you have to have canned dog food for brains not to make money in this market
Doubling up on Tesla right here
It's not easy seeing other people live out your dreams
HOOOOOOOOOOLDDDDDD!!!!!
Is there someone on this sub that does voiceovers? WE NEED YOU! Subtitles AND a voiceover would be a nice touch :)
Lol RSI of 72 is dead. Meanwhile SBE has RSI of 71.5 and its “alive”
[removed]
BABA
Nah IV is low. I’d give it a 50/50 shot if it runs up again. If it does $500 is easy.
Yuge volume on FCEL again today 👀
Unfortunately it took 5 years while my NIO LEAPs are up 125% in 5 weeks...
Yeah
I think robinhood is just being gay lol
I am very bad at this.
thats my thinking. if black friday kills it this year. bull run confirmed pretty much. but if it's lackluster could be a lot of people eyeing the exit
In other news 🅱️TĆ is going to hit a new ath so that's free money, not buying though myself
Are we buying plug power on the dip? Not really a dip but a price adjustment due to 38 million new shares.
Me too. But the universe is against me so we're both fucked.
Cruises going down slower than the titanic
I hate trying to trade in between working this wack ass 9-5
Buy the Tesla dip!!!
Are you a fucking retard?
I made a simple statement.  I said they contract out most parts. Contracting out was the future.  All major car manufacturers do more and more contracting for parts.  Including Tesla.  

You said they do the opposite.  They don't.  Crackhead.
You don't think it'll drop more?
Hold strong, it'll spike
Yeah, whether or not I hold my weeklies depends on today. If we can hit $50 I'll just take profits and maybe buy a couple more closer to the money in case it does blow up after ER
Again, even in its infancy. It’s probably better than your crippled life
Don't mind me. Just going on the put side of TSLA
If I get a pattern day trader restriction can I still withdraw money?
Alright NIO, half an hour in, weak hands out.... GO UP!!!
Buy while it's still cheap, won't be for long!
Can you plz tell CCL that they are to traveling amd fuking CZR that no1 goes to casinos because of freaking world pandemic, ty
If you’re playing TSLA, STOP

It’s all FOMO at this point
WMT with the comeback?!?!?
That was the last two months....I said that every day

cramer reminds me of the nfl countdown 'experts' but then they are like 2-7 at predicting games right
for every 1 of them there is 3 of you

Down bigly today
CBAT GUNNA RUN???
A 30 dollar call is a yolo? Are you homeless?
pton has been consolidating for a couple days, send this ship to 150
PLTR ? I just bought calls

They're like shares but 100x more exciting or depressing cuz you have control of 100x more of them
[deleted]
pltr BUY THE DIP
I think they knew it was a funny thing only some people would understand.

Just like I build a “defense” company and call it Anduril.
TESLA just got added to the S&P and it’s cucking?

Wtf is this
SPY selling off because institutions need money to buy more Tesla lol
That makes sense.
Now you're thinking volatility!
[deleted]
26 by Jan
Fed says q4 is a disaster. Xi says great depression. Mango gonna stop fudging unemployment #s now that he is fired.

Tesla gonna moon around noon out of nowhere
Bought just cuz you said so
HOLD PLTR YOU BITCH
Gg
true, good point.  made so much on tsla alone....  recently fcx, missed nio
Yeah, they are.  Food bank lines 2 miles long will do that.
PLTR going to run this week?
Why have earnings after hours? I cant buy or sell after hours.  Not fair! Sad!
Just traded my NIO for SBE calls 

Nio is dead
shit dont look slow at all actually
Fck those diamond hands people causing PLTR to drop... Punish them, moon higher
Pltr wrong way
Is plug over bought rn? I was waiting for a dip and finally got one but it's ran up so much recently. Should I just do leaps?
Buy this PLTR dip. You’ve been told
I bought 4k shares at 11 and sold for a loss lol
[deleted]
It's fake
Because PLTR is the new NIO 🚀  🚀
92 contracts of $CCL $17.5p 11/27 bought yesterday near the top and sold for $1.08 each at market bell. Easy $2.5k 🌈 🐻

11/27 CCL $16.50P is so cheap wtf. Does everyone think this thing is going up? 2.5%+ drop today and no change in premium price?
I saw this happen with NFLX when they had a spike.
Yes, sell cash secured puts.
Because they make a ton of money?
PLUG, WMT. PLTR dips are free money
When does PS6 come out?
I thought 400 eow
I have to say. Losing $1k was a blessing in disguise. Now I don't stress over tiny $20, $40 drops anymore. I'm not panicking over my losses!
Fukkin so funny!!!!!!!  So funny it's retarded!
It's trying to pull a dukey on the weak.
I'm afraid BABA will never go up again.
Just chill dude, hold long
The IV on tesla was way lower then I thought it would be
If you want to buy today I would maybe split and buy half today and half after a drop or when a jump up confirms on the chart.
FSLY just when I was about to give up on you, your dirty dog
I made a cheat sheet for ya’ll for today.

Is TSLA above $455: if yes wait until below and buy $455 FD’s

Is TSLA below $455: if yes buy $455 FD’s
Cramer the kiss of death curse continues he recommends CVS and Walgreen yesterday and stocks are getting killed today as Amazon is gonna destroy them.
Nio has a tendency to cool before faceripping.
Tesla 500 weekly call is over priced? I'm think of hoping in. Or should I play NIO EOD?
You’re gonna win for the first time in your life
Keep your eyes on BLNK fellas
Well, nicely done my good man.
True brother, true.
Nobody says credit spreads aren’t risky. There’s a reason it’s called picking up pennies in front of a steamroller
Idk what to tell you kiddo. It worked for me.
Up 3 grand over  the last few months thanks to nio
So did you uhhhh try the forbidden fruit?
BUY THE FUCKING DIP RETARDS. HOLD THE LINE
Is CCL real
the slow bleed on PLTR fuck
Good man, that’s the way
I think he means 70 calls, not 70c. No ones even sold calls higher than 30 so far.. at least on RH
i like td’s interface
Yes exactly buy!
I’ve got both

Call is 11/27 16c
Need CCL to fall to $14 this week
I'll buy TSLA again for 420.69 before the end of the year
Puts on Tesla?????????
anything that says PLTR I upvote cuz that vibe is fucking stronk today
TSLA gonna give 1 more run at a breakout or nah?
Some short sellers come out with a report saying they have a $0 price target on ACB. 

Shit proceeds to moon after plummeting at open. Seems pretty sus to me.

Jim Cramer on CNBC's "Squawk On The Box" discussed the fanbase of Nio Inc. (NYSE:NIO).

Cramer said younger people love Nio and love individual stocks or "obvious'" plays like Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Yeah..NO SHIT, JIM
Over here my dude
Its only temporarily down from the discounted stock offering, itll be back to 25 where it was yesterday way before December
How long out would I need to buy ttwo leaps to reap the rewards of them finally announcing gta 6? One year? Two?
Name it Shadows.....my dream bar
I  like this. I don't know what to do with it. But I like it. haha
G’luck
I don’t know way to much though! I just want ccl to sink
It's not about quantity. The point is they make the engine, the battery, the software, the chargers, i.e. everything of significance, whereas NIO doesn't. Nobody gives a fuck about the wipers retard
Atleast it was just 1
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? I could really use an NIO pump right now, pump right now, pump right now
Yes
Anyone know what percent of the float is still short on tsla
I’ve seen that they have something like 12k cars delivered whereas last quarter they had 10
was that the sell off or we going down more boys?
There is no top for Tesla lol
Great job fellow autist, real talk, Costco is never a bad bet.

Sold most of my stocks this morning waiting for the upcoming crash.  All way up.  I don't think it crashes till December or January, but don't want to get caught on the back foot.  Cash gang.
Nio is expected to report a per-share loss that narrowed to RMB1.18 from RMB2.48 a year ago, according to FactSet, and revenue that more than doubles to RMB4.37 billion from RMB1.84 billion.

We thinking it dumps on earnings?  Kind of feels like the pop was already priced in after Li call.
You were right it did beat earnings...sadly beating earnings was priced in.
Might be my best day in the market yet ❤️🐻
ACB
Sorry guys, I have NIO. Guarantee this doesn’t work out for us
No Bitch has been flat for 4 years now
70c wtf?
420. I literally buy calls and puts always 420 strike just depends on which side of 420 it’s on
DKNG on the way towards 50!! Get in now!
Smart, but not respected
keep getting nervous about my FSR calls but then i realize i'm ITM with at least a month until expiration and the stock price is still practically twice what it was two weeks ago.

pls
i was promised CCL was gonna go down on me
It'll post great earnings and go down, most likely.
Tesla back to $500 either now or from ETF fund manager in December
Now gets TSLA gets to go down with the rest of the market 😂
Buy PLTR now it won't matter whether you bought at 15, 16 or 17 when it's 100
def NOT 20 EOD lol
Tesla is a fucking boomer stonk now. 🤦‍♂️
It will after it hits 430.
What’re you looking at 270 11/27
I love how accurate a morning sell off after a large AH jump is. Made $25k on weekly Tesla calls bought at open and sold them in the span of 5 minutes.
🤦‍♂️
If AMD and NIO could just fucking go up that would be great...
You should hold and buy more

The party ain’t even getting started yet for Palantir

I wonder if they are still in it or if they have handed there bags off yet
Tanking? Fucking retard alert
Whats the news on RIDE? Getting close to being up 50% on the week.
The BABA dump as soon as we opened is meme worthy lmao not even the pajama traders can pump it rn
They don’t even make their own cars!

Yeeee you dropped this👑 too late to buy more?
It's heading on 7 straight red trading days. I'm assuming 250 is where it's headed next? I've lost so much money chasing this fucking pile of shit.

AMD?
QQQ must of stayed up watching The Core last night what the fuck
To buy the new company they have to sell off positions in the current companies. With TSLA being such a huge company SPY will be flat/negative til after it is added.

Two things, 1. Should’ve place a sell order before open. 2. If he went too high because he didn’t estimate correctly instead of canceling the order to go look at the price you hit the replace button. It lets you immediately Change the price and sell again

Yeah $NKLA price action over the past 6 months has been totally normal.

honestly, fuck !
Wrong
It’s 9:53.
Ayyyyy! We're up, boys! 8% gain!
Tesla needs to break 460
Most likely it will go up for a couple days at least. Although historically, news this big usually pushes the price for 2-2.5 weeks. But there is always a firsf time for everything

Doesn’t all tech die after earnings no matter what
FAKE AMD GAY
sometimes I sit back and look at everything going up. stock markets/btcoin/bonds and wonder where is this money coming from...
SE you fucking slut
I’d rather $rope
800 764 7419 is custoner service number!
I got totally fucked selling Tesla covered calls yesterday. Should I just let them go at this point?
Sold PLTR calls at top for profit, wondering should I hop back in
So...you haven't actually seen the Earnings then, huh?
🥲🥲🥲
Seriously how are you guys picking up these dirt cheap options? What was your strike, $600??
If I could get CCL to dip below $17 for about 10 mins that’d be great
This is the way. https://i.imgur.com/x2prG9O.jpg

Epic!
Mmm I think I’m aboard with that think I can get in with weeklies or iv crushed to hell?
RAD on a moon mission, only -12% now. This is wild. -11% next
I have one on my watchlist and it’s literally IPO. it’s gone up $10-15 in about two months
Wrote a naked tsla $420p.  If I get assigned, I'm gonna collect premium from you fuckers.
Are you serious? Literally everyone is in PLTR, NIO, TSLA. How is that bearish?
It was a minuscule dip lol.. been bought now
Organic growth
Maybe because Baba is facing a class action lawsuit from investors...
1000 comments in minutes about tsla and pltr obvious bots
Buy half now, and if it goes down buy the other half.
so just gonna be a slow drill day?
440 imo. Prolly there will be a random ass sell off. If I was to guess, it will incline up to 480-510 gradually until inclusion then slowly decline and go back to stagnant then growth randomly trending upwards
No BABA love anyone?
If they do I’m out, if not I’m holding fuck it all

Its fine shhh

I dont think so. Dips were bought instantly the past 2 days and it looked like consolidation to a gap up. Instituional firms average 11-13 cost per share so the floor is firm.

yes
BA almost down 3% already... nice
Nah it will steadily grow
Im gonna load up so much if they miss
Let’s go PLTR!!!!!
There can't be a more perfect set up for NIO earnings puts than this. TSLA pumps NIO to the moon right before NIO earnings pull it back to earth.
>COST

If you have COST calls (385C 27/11) would you keep holding them?  People piling in for the special dividend.
puts on tsla, oops
Not this time bud
I got out today, its not worth the risk unless imo. 

Will re-buy after earnings.
Buy the PLTR dip
NIO tanking, hope people got out.

My CCL puts are up about 10 percent since yesterday. It’s ok if you don’t wanna make money
I'm not much into gap theory but I'm afraid I have to issue a "this is the way" here.
I bought 1 Tsla 11/27 550c to fuck around with. Not going to go all in here. Shit is to expensive now.
It has everything to do with it, are you kidding? Compound interest, you as a bommer type investor should know exactly what I mean. You can be the smartest person in the world and still make average monetary gains - in fact this happens to most people, again just look at the statistics. You also need a heck of a starting point to make what anyone would consider "good money" annually. To get to $500K, it would take most people about 20 years. There are plenty of people willing to live like they're poor. Hell, I make sick money and spend about $5K/month on everything (this is with a wife and 3 kids). I live like I'm poor and have considerable money at my disposal. But I'm not oblivious and don't sit on a high horse saying "look at my fucking bank account you idiots, you could all have the same!!!!" because I realize that **most people** will not make the kind of money I do to start with, and therefore will take a **VERY** (key word: very) long time until they build up a few million dollars...at which point money won't matter much anymore. Is it possible? Sure. It's just not realistic for the majority of people....kind of like that book Rich Dad Poor Dad. In a perfect world that shit works. Guess what? We don't live in a perfect world. I'm surprised your eyes are so wide shut considering the amount of money you also have.
This comment is all it took for me to buy back in when the stock is already up almost 8% today. Good chance you are a 12 year old suburban kid but I like the way you think.
Why do you think this will hit?
“Looking at” doesn’t mean ready to buy my dude
Everyone shilling PLTR while the rest of the market takes a nap. Cool
Lets see. Luckily I never hold options that expire the week of earnings. Always at least a week out at minimum but in this case 3-4 weeks out.
Is it too late to jump in PLTR?
Slowing down :(
I could've watched this all day. Hilarious!
It was fun NIO but no way in hell am I holding you for earnings. Fly free little birdie :)

Fuck me these TSLA premiums are insane, like double what I was looking at AH yesterday fuck that I’m waiting until after the first selloff
Everything dumping

Why? What’s the DD here?
Holy shit PLTR I shouldn’t have sold you at $16.60
Tsla 420 put 11/20
This feels like its going to be a very dumpy day.
Hey these aren't new tendies.  These are the same tendies I gave the BABA gods last week.
PALANTIR TO $20 SO SOON
Can BABA at least give me a little hope?
Imagine not buying the TSLA dip before launch to Mars 🤷🏻‍♂️
JD u cuck go back up wtf what’s with the sell off
[deleted]

Damn $SPY fucking drilling
So that GME news didn’t do anything. And baba is still tanking. Interesting.
pls do MU again, RAM is cool again! we are back from the dead!!!
Just got in 12/4 PLTR
Big brain time: since Tesla got included into the SP500 the big boys are selling some positions of SP500 because they want nothing to do with TSLA at this point in time
Lol if your not betting on tesla you should not be allowed to jerk off
[deleted]
[deleted]
Sell and don’t worry about what could’ve been.

Are my NVDA calls fuk?????
Let’s go I’m ready to be hurt again by NIO
love to see the transition from red to geeen
Is being ass a good thing or bad thing?
It says my only option is to sell
PLTR is absolutely mooning right now. Still think it’s early to get in
Guys I'm up 10 grand off Tesla calls and I don't know what to do.... Was going to sell but it's already climbed up several hundred dollars. Help me autists.
Yea but those puts may have been hedging calls on the other side. Back in April, no one knew what the fuck was going to happen. The AARP guys on CNBC we’re debating whether it was going to be a sharp V recovery or special k recovery - whatever the fuck the latter means clearly the people who bought SPY calls made a killing.
When did you buy?
I knew buying MRNA put was good idea!
My account is green and yours is red
Why a breakout? What do we know about earnings
spy taking a dump
PLTR single handedly saving my entire portfolio
Meme name?
I'm fucking in
If you go broke that's your own fault for listening to me, haha. Set up your stop losses bruh!
Up 20% on MRNA 95p 12/18. Sell or hold
how?? loool
Down to the last $50. Ideas?
Expiring calls?
Did I studder? You could have thousands of dollars to your name. doesn't make it real money.

PLTR the next meme stock still in early stages. If you’re pissed off you missed out on Tesla and Nio, this is a third opportunity
geez louis, power to you, hope it gets resolved.
PLUG can suck my fucking dick how could they do this to me

this CARR selloff is such manipulated bullshit, Fuck you, Jim Cramer.
What? His reasoning is shit.
I’m sorry but this a casino and I only care about pump and dumps?
Wait until the big boys stop giving a shit what the SJW's think about them accumulating Palantir.
Also leave me the fuck alone. No one likes you and you fucking smells like shit.
Fuck me and stupid FOMO, missed out on some calls @ 2.85, jumped to 4.50...dammmit
God dam, its not everyday you get one of those!

What the hell does this have to do with being smart with your money? yes I had to work hard and live like I was poor for a long ass time. But eventually I started making more from the market than I Grossed. I'm not saying theirs a clear disadvantage. I'm saying its possible.
I had calls on both because I'm retarded.
Lol at stupid fucks who didnt buy tesla at open. What are you even doing?!
This is fucking gold. The Tesla caller 😂😂😂

Most online brokers are about the same now since most have $0 commission and offer the same products. You just want to make sure you like the user interface and tools. RH has bad functionality and outages.
Not for long term
You don’t belong here, poor bear.
all you rkt retards should take a look at TREE, which is down substantially today.

Calling it now, all in BABA  

(For real tho, his tax returns showed he had pretty much no stocks left.)
cool, and when theres a pothole in the road, every single TSLA will pop a tire in it
But.. it’s already more that $458.. if you think it was a mistake then sell now for a profit
Who’s holding NiO calls thru earnings?

What industry are you in?
What’s with this schitzo market today...no more room to grow in tech and small caps aren’t falling much

RE: nio
If you're trying to just dump it.  Set a limit order 1 cent cheaper than the going rate.  Usually an algo or someone sees that one dollar "deal" and it gets scooped instantly
TSLA IV and IVP are still surprisingly low.  Don't have to get gigantic price movements to get profit if volatility also increases.
If you believe that fake QQQ dump, I have a bridge to sell you
dude it's going down below 400 before end of week
The wrong way 😢
?
fud thanks to the ccp
GameStop swinging 1% every 2 minutes lmaoo

Good time for PDD calls

Nio gonna fall either way
this is accurate lol
This is the way
Sold my NIO calls and FOMO’d into Tesla like I said yesterday. Praying for some juicy tendies
Daily reminder RKT is ass for shareholders
Day trading Tesla is a real cunt sometimes. Didn’t quite react on open as I anticipated. Let’s see what the day brings us.

Guesses?
Keep going down CCL !!
Good job fucktard!
Tesla to 500 by Friday
have you met my friend CSCO?
Theres no way BABA does 8 red days in a row right? 🤡
Why is plug tanking
Yes
Hold NIO through earnings or what bois?
No
Walgreens then collected that quick dividend
Yeah not sure if I trust this. Waiting for some insight
Start down every morning huh :/
PLTR gonna hit the 52 wk high today
https://i.imgur.com/BOExb4v.jpg

Just filled 77k in TSLA 11/27 500/520 debit spreads
You are way too excited about this, I dont expect it to stick
Fuck it, ima load 30% of my portfolio in it as well. Thanks bro
yes
This guy is fucking smart!
Well that was an easy way to lose 20%
I got lucky, just picked up a cheap call yesterday with how low tsla was feeling. Was honestly just going for a quick flip on any mid day action. It will probably go up more but I got what I came for, not trying to make a mil on one play
my WMT calls are for march but it still hurts
The news that profit will essentially be capped? Commies took this one
Gonna be a boring day until Powell talks and says the same thing as last time
My position is... Start investing and making real money.

Please read what the article is about. It’s not about stats, it’s about stubbornness. You just confirmed that convictions > facts
Yes, finally some tendies.
For the first time I ever I bought stonks in extended hours. TSLA at $458. That appears to be a mistake.
🤡
Bought TSLA shares again 

letsgoooooo elon
Lol the top 3 tickers on my watchlist are TSLA, TUP, and VIX
Can’t even have sustained bearish action for 10 minutes, god damn
BTD ON CVS
RDFN
What’s new? It couldnt even move on singles day.
It’s green. Stop sucking your dads cock
So how many of you FOMOd into TSLA at the top?
Damn who fomo’d into tsla calls at open
Why is everyone so into PLTR? Has there even been any news on them?
 2,400% returns today on CVS puts 

>!Still down -50% on it tho!<
BABA do be acting extra sus 😔😔😔
Sitting on a call, hoping that wasn’t the biggest peak at open
Then u aren't up...
All hail PLTR, I for one welcome our Big Brother overlords!
why is FB tanking..?
well then you should take notes brah
Another day of getting graped in the mouth by BABA? Sign me up 🤡
Can I get a baba gang check in? I think we may see some tendies this week
Same bro. I bought a few 11/20s. Good ol' days. Tesla back on the top of the watchlist
Good luck!
There are people trying to short, they gonna lose
RKT - name a shittier stock
Make the VIX great again
Might delete later. Idk.

Tesla sell off is over, we mooning soon
I panic sold my gdrx and just backed the dump truck up to amzn. I hope bezos takes me back.

That means puts for you...

Diamond Hands baby!
Because he spat at the emperor's face
Lol HYLN is seriously shittiest stock every
Guaranteed when the Europeans get offline we start to go green again
New contracts, helping the delivery of vaccines, building contact tracing programme for UK, managing COVID emergency supply chain for Colombia and UK, classified military contracts including Project Maven that Google lost, and existing contracts have average 3.5 year of revenue which jumped nearly 45% this year, and they are sitting on nearly 2 billion in cash with less than a billion in liabilities.

I ain't even talking about the private sector.
Couldn't resist TSLA
I had some $3 11/20s that I dumped yesterday at like 300%, I feel retarded.
It’s days like today that I’m glad I decide to buy my calls for at least 4 months out starting 1/15/21 (bought in Aug) and out to 1/22/23. Cause today’s gone suck
Tell me something: do you think it's not only realistic but actually possible that the majority of Americans (50%+) **could** make a few hundred thousand dollars per year just by working hard? You know what? Forget working hard. Do you think that's even realistic outright? Even if it's not at a day job and it's via capital gains, do you think it's realistic? And if so, do you realize what that would do to prices for all products on a general scale?

Look at statistics. Then look at how the general economy runs. Then get back to me.
I’m up like 180% on NIO. Where’s the tragedy?
Okok
Should I hold my wmt calls ffffff
YEAH DIE NIO!!!!

YEAH!!! 

SUCK IT WSB NOOB S!!

WELCOME TO WALLSTREET BABY
feels like a day where stonks will be at their lowest around 3:45 pm. 

don't be a piggy
All of WSB Is it's own poor hedgefund
Good job brother, with you on that one
PLUG Puts going to print bb
1k yolo what the FUCK do I do
can GME have just 2 green days in a row ? ever ?
fck that, they are actually going to have to answer REAL tough questions from the big boys now that need to commit 100m's of their funds to the stock - the games are gonna get smoked out i think...or at least they have to wind them up and we know what that means
All in on Tesla
Did I fuck myself buying GameStop puts? Up a fuck ton but nobody buying
You will get paid!  Hang in there
Maybe they should release some real value like a stock split
Bears and Bulls must unite to defeat their common Kangaroo enemy
What’s your position
 BABAbabies btfo once again
My leaps are saying it'll hit 60 by EOY lol, cant wait for this earnings hype to be over so we climb steadily and stealthily

Where is amazon going?
A big red candle would be lovely 
And if Vix could go up 30% that would be great too
It started at like 38 yesterday.
I’m in on this as well as $5c’s for 2022, super cheap atm
Eh, I think they could be worried about the collective weaponized autism driving stonk price. Which is a legit concern with so many people piling into calls
My dude!
Yeah wtf
oh yeah im raking in the karma from this post my friend. You got me. you're so smart. But more importantly. You're right!
did basically the same
Kiiinda wished i didnlt sell my NIO shares before closing yesterday.

I jerk off to Papa Musk as hard as the next guy, but he's probably going to eat shit on his opposition to lidar. The tech works, and Musk knows it works. He called it, "cheating" precisely because it's so much more accurate than cameras/radar. 

Musk wants his AI to be able to process and interpret camera feeds, so that when we all jam Neuralinks into our skulls his AI will be able to process our visual feeds, making him an all knowing god. Guess what humans don't have? Lidar units. Case closed.

My wife’s mother may have Covid - she was just with her and is supposed to start an awesome job tomorrow.  Continued shutdowns have completely annihilated my industry and there is very little chance I’ll be able to find work when unemployment runs out.  Stimulus is nowhere in sight.  Lol bulls and bears rejoice, but I am fuck.

Motherfucker has 20 identical swimming goggles in his office. If that doesn't scream "so stupid it'll make you rich" then idk what does.
Why did it go up so much?

Me!  300 shares.
I hope SPY drills beyond belief
Why is BABA struggling to move despite all the news?
Got a TSLA $450 FD for old time sakes. Don't mind if I lose a few hundred on it just brings me back to the good days of staring at TSLA on my watchlist all day

Why is NIO so bipolar? Lol

Anyone think this PLUG price action at open is a bull trap

Disagree. Insiders on Wall st. knew, which is who took all your money. You people are being fleeced by insider trading, which is why I dont do options

got in TSLA at 454 lets see if there's some FOMO
I’m the guy who’s going YOLO on Boeing calls and I’m still holding because Boeing’s about to go tits up. Either way, Tesla kept bouncing around at $400 so I picked up a call before closing and I guess my luck hasn’t run out, yet. My only regret? I didn’t buy more.

I hope mgmt responds ASAP, any positive news will make it moon. I’m long 01/15 $15 calls
Yes. My recent birthday I had literally like 2 people tell me happy birthday. Fine with me cause everyone I used to know we’re snakes. Less people the better man
BABA entered the green for 10 seconds before going red again. It’s an improvement already that it saw green
Pfe removed options?..
Some shit you're that you only use if you're getting scammed. Don't fall for it, retard.
There’s “karma whores” and apparently the opposite too, can we call these “karma 🏳️‍🌈🐻?”
it depends on how much cash you have to invest that is outside of your living expenses.
Glad to know I bring some joy man!
It was always after hours

Worst part is im all in on NIO calls
My brokerage Fidelity will do the transaction of paying out the value of my “in the money puts” at expiration into my account, so I don’t have to worry about getting rid of expiring puts. I assume other brokerages and RH do the same (?)
-88% ouch
Currently I am supporting my parents. Mom has serious disease. . So I am doing all the work at home. So no job for now. Only when situations  resolve will look for a job for IT technology architect or manager

You sound like you barely know anything about stocks tbh
Active portfolios have a benchmark, not an index.  They are not ***supposed*** to be just buying the index constituents, excluding a few losers, and bringing in a few winners.

I mean no not really to be honest, but it doesn’t matter what I think

Zoomer? I'm just about 37 my man. Secondly, who the fuck said anything about "rich get richer bullshit"? Don't put words in my mouth.

The hard truth is that 90%+ of people don't even have $100K in their trading accounts, not even people in my age range. I do, but most don't. Another interesting statistic: most people don't make $100K/year or more, leaving them little money to invest more annually. What you are proposing is basically that people invest $10K to start, and then add an additional $10K every year. Let's assume that most people can do that (most people can't). Let's also assume an 8% annual return. You know what? Let's make it 10%. Most people don't get lucky and pick Apple type investments that grow 5,000x over 20 years. And even so, with $10K, they sure as shit aren't putting all $10K into Apple; maybe a 10% oftheir portfolio position. My point is that "investors" like you look for 7-10% annual gains. What the fuck are you going to accomplish with those type of gains with a $10K starting point and an additional annual add of $10K? Nothing **meaningful**.

Your $2M in your account is from your day job, not from your insane percentage gains in the market. Most people don't have the opportunity to make 6-7 figures a year. It's just not possible statistically speaking and how the economy is set up to run. This is coming from someone (me) who made $400K at my day job last year. Get off your fucking high horse and realize that you are lucky, and also that your investment strategy blows harder than gay bears.
Why
I was going to buy calls at open. Bad idea?
Congrats to everyone who had some TSLA calls. Excited to see those gains.
da wey
Good luck everyone!
1 MINUTE LEFT!!!!!!!!!
Nah
Gl today retards
It really was just a slow bleed with no volume. We’re hitting 370 before Thursday.
You know of mark douglas? Well a long time ago he was training a guy who was a bit similar to you. He was good at entering the market but would always exist after his position went up 1 tick (futures). So the advice was basicly that if the trade went up for 1 tick do not touch. Look away for 10 minutes.  If he lost, he lost. If he won, he didnt cuck himself from profits. 


Well either way since you are broke now it doesnt matter.
This is **mint**

higher chance of profits when you go ITM. but need more collateral.

deep OTM options have a high chance of expiring worthless. but needs less collateral.
guess im an idiot then
right? good try Baba. trying to make us feel again.

Same, bought 3 calls option
BABA PLZZZZZ!!!!!!
Waiting for high iv. Either towards open or close
I spent 25 years working on Wall Street. I’ll wager my net worth in real assets is 100x yours. Plus I have millions still invested. That will still be there in years to come.
Feeling like TSLA and NIO are going to take a dump after some profit taking. Just like how I take a dump after eating wheat-based tendies...heh
469 WOULD BE NICE
also way more fun to drive. more than a fucking ufo bugatti or lambo
We fucking know already, covid is bad. Priced in, markets high on hopium

Fuck me ugh
doesn't really matter. if the person buying the call from him is anyone other than a wallstreetbets visitor, he'll get assigned most likely
This starts parties where I'm from .( Carolina)
BABA going to break out today.  Already green.
No I know, I’ve learned being burned before. This is my second month in and I’m up 130%, but that’s down from being up 268% at my all time.

I was going to jump into Tesla but i think it will sell this news today. Shame
hahahahaha wow
😂
BABA let's goooo
Please Elon give me that juicy IV bump.
Better see some tendie screenshots from Tesla today

Oof
Homie called it yesterday EBAY 1/21 $65C @ .14 , I’ll throw $200 at it fuck it!! Yolo
If Tesla faded this entire gap it’d be hilarious
GM = undervalued
Because I lost a fuck ton on their blackjack last night ☹️
Lol tech lagged yesterday so you bought puts?  Are yah winnin’ yet son??
Uh oh NIO bears
I’m here, son.
\> But wait, I'm a retard. So I did this in Robinhood. I forgot that Robinhood just put a handy dandy early assignment button in their stupid app.   


Do... do you think when you sell options on Robinhood you are only selling to other Robinhooders?
do you recommend standard account or margin trading account? i like the idea that they’ll give me buying power so i might go with margin trading. i already have a roth ira with vanguard so this is gonna be my daytrading account
I think they had a big price target assigned last night after hours
Let’s do this my herd animals.
Fuck this sell wall on GM
It is. Except it will be a tiny amount of real money and likely lost in the next year.
No... we’re full on retarded, but herd retarded.   Never underestimate an army of retards.
lol
When should I buy then? Or just not lose money into a FOMO play and move on?
Man I can’t decide what to do with my TSLA 450 calls, this gonna run at open or tank?
My LI puts are about to be fucked
My body is ready papa Elon. Fly me to the moon 🚀✨
Cramer talked about Nio. He definitely reads this sub every day.
if you got calls prob best to dump at open, thats my plan - hoping....
Sounds like trump wrote that headline
Never said there was only one person being fucked lol just that I’m not getting the dick
Depends on the news
It's like scratching a lotto ticket while half awake
And we’ll both definitely regret it around EOD

TSLA calls at open or has the ship sailed?
not take any of these retards advice
>Just buy June $420c's on TSLA

well? did you listen u/chinnick967 ?
HOLD THE LINE BULLS

EUROPEANS HAVE DECEIVED US

HOIST SPY TO 360 AND RECEIVE ETERNAL GLORY
Lmfaaoooo
Easier and safer profit cause if the stock falls and you have a call already itm doesn’t effect it too much
Dude, just get out of plug. Averaging down is just pissing on more money
Some of us

You’re welcome https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jv52hs/_/gcif7gs/?context=1
Don’t listen to that random; listen to *this* random. Just sell puts on something cheap and use the premium to accumulate SPY shares. Worst case, you have to buy the shares at discount.
sell
Can always roll that tbh, good luck

This is unhealthy isn’t it
You’re 100% and it’s not just SE lol
Baba with the fake hopes
I don't think it'll dump but might be erratic. My guess is 460 or 470
Whatre we thinking it peaks at today??
Nokia 1/21/21 - 4C and 3P straddle - should cover from any COVID dip. Profit outside of he 2.91 and 4.31 range trading @3.86 right now low @ 2.30ish and high @ 5+

My apologies, looks like the community voted for the automod to erase that one, too.

PFE stock spin off.  If you hold PFE, you automatically get X shares of this.
Why the fuck DKNG is up 3.2% lol
If you're somewhat rich, sell options to the WSB crowd.
All we need is to bring R under 1. If baseline R=2, vaccine is 90% effective, and 60% of people receive it, R=2 * (1 - 0.6 * 0.9 ) = 0.92
Yeah I was actually drooling today
no one is ever the only one getting clusterfucked in the stock market
[deleted]
So who's selling Nio at open?
For SPY to get back to 330 it would requiere a 10% decrease, do you guys think have that in reserve?
Every day
not even a "thank you" for dropping this knowledge on you? how rude.
I’m not missing anything though?
Since 2018, Dollar General has outperformed SPY by 3x.
Who's that trans lady driving a vintage roadster?
 **RemindMe! at 11am "check for updates"**
But but but...vaccine!!!!  Ha!
Considering they are offering at 22.25, probably not

I want to try options
478 by eod, why sell at 460?
Robinho of it allows you to see the last sold amount
Clearly u just gotta wait another 2
Nice to start the day knowing that I’m not the one about to be fucked. Good luck today dipshits
Lots of coffee
To what.  You are winning.
Lmao why
Seriously, why should I buy ITM options instead of lotto OTM options?
Realistic TSLA price eod?
maintenance drinking and weed
he guessed that SPY would trade between 1 and 5,000 and was wrong.

never lived it down.
Rip these PLUG calls. I’m averaging the fuck down
NEVERMIND, WE DIDN'T MEAN IT 

-Futures traders
You need to buy some Nio calls at open sell before close make some quick cash Nio loves all
tesla snp priced in ?
I bet he smashed the hell out of that BUY button didn’t he?
Eod prediction?
TSLA aint breaking $500 any time soon
Dangerous combination
I am back in the + since I bough during ATH. still negative overall.
Yes and when they go up you lose money
Because you have shares of PFE
Date ?
Who’s your BABA?
Need strikes pussy I can’t do math!
You ever get that feeling, right before the bell, that you're about to do some stupid shit and lose money?
like most BABA green dildos, it will be sold off

Tesla small dump at open and then rocket
You sonofabitch I’m in.
I might cash them in and sell these nio calls..muahahaha 

I dont think ita going 160 eow, I might just be done this week and watch the nio extravaganza.

Made $9900 on this.
For sure, I sold my shares at $461 during premarket

All 8 options I have, all calls, are all in the red now. After all of them were up slightly in some way or another earlier. /sadface
also a tech play
Dump at open :( then green by eod
puts
Cept he didn’t gain lmao
Feels like we shoot straight back to green and >360 at open
Was up all night after drinking tequila and eating too much chicken alfredo. Anyone got a remedy?
Hmm thats funny. we opened red. yet I still made money. I wonder whyyyyyyyyyyy.......
Lol no, puts give you the right to sell at that strike
Tesla will you go back above 500? Lets find out

Nah, I say we let AMC fall. Payback for $9 pretzels.

Might sell off more at open but should return 17-ish in an hour
So much for your blowout 🤣
Daemon
writing TSLA puts far OTM
I can’t wait for air bnb to ipo, it’s such a good play, it’s a vaccine pump play, a Becky play, and a covid travel play, better to stay at a private Airbnb if you have to go somewhere rather than a hotel where you interact with more people
Thanks. Avoiding at all cost.
Not with TSLA inclusion. SPY will drop/stay flat til next year.
Plug hitting 25 EOD thoughts?
seems like you have to miss earnings estimates to increase share price, judging from SEA
Better get in on BA quick at open.
[deleted]
And do the opposite you’ll loose everything today idiot lmfao
This is actually a really good point. A $45 dollar entry fee weeds out a lot of people
Dondé es la leché?

See that would make me happy but yeahhh.... no.
Wrong way spy

Lmfao those are actually great insults
Zoom is running with it, up 3% pm
bruh is SPY really just gonna break back through 360  at 9:25 after it took literally all night to break the support
Please Tesla dip so I can get 12/24 $500cs
Every good trade I make is due to my genius while every bad trade is because the MM’s rigged the market 😎
He said buy
Not going to hold TGT though earnings. Retail sales data this morning not great
Buying TSLA, SE, and PLUG shares at open, gl brothers
Buy
Elon tweets he most likely has the 'Rona and he joins the 500 club!
Can someone tell me why Facedrive Inc. doesn't have any options on it?
Fuck bro not looking good
You’d be short the stock.
Absolutely. Ride or die baby
Bro some major players are buying huge stakes in it. Hold as long as you can. Also disregard that these are the same major players that bought huge stakes in shit like Nikola...
Well congrats to all of you
You get stock
Man fuck Amazon they just killed my CVS calls entering the pharmaceutical industry! Fuck you Bezos

Uhhhhh looks like this dip is gonna get bought up again lmao

Thanks
[deleted]
Did SE have earnings?

Sold a Strangle, haven't got a clue what they are
Yes
Idk. Might average down on yesterday puts and honestly sell a couple near BE to lesson load. Thankfully it's all house money so I can only win less
exactly what i was thinking unless IV is gonna shoot through the roof by then
It's from the BBC, can't be wrong.
They’re expecting bond failures and are going to step in if banks need to unload them before they fail
>could rip his hand off at any second.

I'd sell my wife's boyfriends camper Van he's been living in for the past year in our driveway to watch that.
Did Cramer say buy or sell NIO? I’m doing the exact opposite
No you def want him held back a year. The kids that are older than everyone else straight up dominate the classroom and playground
Someone just bought 11.78K shares of TSLA
Sad belly 😢
What is the plan now? How do you plan to support yourself?
To buy stocks in March
Bought calls at eod yesterday. It’s babas time
Lose it all
It should be deciding calls vs not playing for the next couple days

I hope to below 14.5 before January.
Picked up some yesterday too
Good morning everybody. I'm trying to write a analysis after no sleep, was a little sick yesterday and not feeling too great today. 

Anyways, get out of bed and have a fantastic day. Keep your head up and don't worry about tomorrow. Enjoy today and grab some chic fil a. 

love u guys.
[deleted]
Shut up so I can buy them first
If it were to do either of those it would have happened already. Dropped 8 after initial earnings, and now green. Earnings were fantastic, so prob stay green now
Crushed it, as usual. Never selling this stock.
In Mother Russia ~~bears stand on you~~ we stand on bears
They don’t even sell cigs on Amazon it’d never happen

It ain’t even that much bruh.
Tesla 500c December or Jan?
SPAC warrents usually have a 11.5 strike price

BUT: there may be stupid rules about early redemption (stock price reached X value for Y days), one warrent may only entitle you to a fraction of a share (e.g. 2 warrants = 1 stock) and you can't exercise it whenever you wish. That means the stock price can be 20 and the warrants trade below 20-11.5=8.5. See SBE for a recent example of this, you can't price it like a standard option.
spy
This is going green dont fight it
Don’t buy it at market open
Fucking drill AAL 📉📉📉⚰
One
Of
Us
Bc papa buffet wants it to be an elitist stock, if everyone can get into it, it won't have the same effect.
Cramer just called us HERD ANIMALS! Well, young people.  But he ended with 'but they're smart! and it's working!'  Calls on WSB
ZM somehow fucks me everyday
Holy shit, why does this happen every time I buy calls
[deleted]
GME is gonna dump HARD at open due to panicked shorts and then rebound
Just buy all the calls and keep them forever
Good way to play it!  I've explained it fully a few times
Good advice lol
That’s assuming it’s all on purpose some people just have a weak pullout game
Legit, dont know if I should be on puts or calls on TSLA today for EOD
Already blew it up
Muy bien y tu?
Honest question.... if I exercise a put option do I get negative stocks? since exercising a call option gets you the actual stock.
Yeah i mean if you hate it, quit. Even if u dont have the money. But id quit options if u do. Never know when it goes to zero.
Solo yolo putz at open? 11/27 20p?
[deleted]
The game is in the 2% scraps.
You’ll regret that by mid December
ZM is the play 🚀
I placed an order for a 11/27 $500c. Ask was $0.69 close yesterday. Rounded up to the nearest 0 and multiplied by 6. The order is for $4.20. Hoping it’ll fill with some luck. But also *high*ly doubt it.
Moo
I’ll take this advice!
the bottom is 0
do I diamond hand these cvs jan calls or sell at open?
I'll show you gay.
465
Who owns the tesla calls
 What would you do if you had 100k?
Fuck him I’ll slaughter him talking about my Nio like that
Oh thank fucking god people came to their senses and started buying ZM again. 🙏
1... 2... 3... we all buy $AMC? I promise it isn't manipulation.)
As if they don't already have all of it anyways

Solid DD
Do you guys think SE will moon or tank?
You can do the wall street bets thing or you can make some money. I bought at $400 with plans to ride it back to $460 and it's at $460. Every time I don't stick to my plan I get fucked in the face. I'm selling
[deleted]
Nice opportunity to trim my TSLA position. Gracias S&P.
420c fd here.
I think PLUG puts are the play today any here doing the same?
theta is the play
Ban
Also you have to work harder with options than you do with stocks so I really don't get your point.
keep watching!!!!!!!!
 vete a la mierda
Fantastico! Y tu?
First thing, I am selling tesla at 460, don't want to be greedy
This moon mission doesn’t need any luck. We’ve got the best book cookers in the world on our side
i have a feeling tsla us gonna dump at open
Bearish. JPow added to the FOMC speaker list as a late addition. 1pm. GL
Cramer talking about us and NIO

He just called us "kings of the obvious" 

"they are herd animals"

😦
Yea best is to just delete the ticker after you sell and check back a few days after. Man it’ll fuck you up psychologically if it moons after
Are you in high school lol

Where are those numbers coming from? Sounds like a fun read
KINGS OF THE OBVIOUS!
The Walton's must hate me because I voted blue
Slow or not, he needs 25% increase (more to actually rebalance the call cost) in 3 days. Without any news coming up. And after a run up. On a market that already climbed.
Do I buy TSLA FD’s at open with a cash advance on my CC to deposit into checking and use the margin on Robinhood and day trade it within minutes for a profit? 

Or is this fucking stupid and will I be caught buying it at it’s high?
It's ok to be gay

All in PLUG today fuck it BTFD
I hope so but rsi isn’t high enough, it can go both ways and if it goes up I think I’m fucked
25% OTM calls 11/27

Go big or go home pussy
Having a predictable pullback in pre-market today, but given how far it's soared, no biggie. Hold this baby tight, there's plenty companies with NO sales trading much higher. They have better battery tech than Tesla, made profit for the first time ever on their recent earnings (0.0007 cents a share!) and have a contract with China's 2nd largest automaker + more to come, unless it's all a lie.
IM TAKING THE FUCKING HD RED PILL WISH ME LUCK FELLAS

You also dont take into account disease prevalence nor social distancing. ARR would likely increase after disease prevalence has gone up these past few months. Esp in the midwest.

Nio's stock rises ahead of earnings as Tesla surge, upbeat analyst call provide a boost - MARKETWATCH
whats the move today?
Tesla
I wouldn’t call it that. Lifestyle would imply I live it day in and day out. Thankfully the market closes and I get weekends off where I choose not to suck so much.
[deleted]
Cars? They buying carvana or what.
Glad I picked up February FSR calls because this shit aint lifting a finger.
Dumbest analyst around!
I’m holding my shares long term. Depending on your time horizon and how many you have, you could take some profits at open if you want/need them. If you have calls, I’d probably sell those at open to lock in gains.
My gut says wait till first dip. My vagina says at open
open interest on otm calls is low which tells you more ppl will be buying than selling at open
Because I bought it yesterday to swing 😂
PLUG puts and CCL puts at open??
Can't wait til 9:40 when RH actually updates my balances
I actually went to wendies yesterday, they fucked up my order.... TSLA is now sp500 bound... coincidence I think not!

I'm selling Tesla at 460
1 step ahead
Because only retards think it's a high five emoji
#SToNkS
Because it's run by the ultimate nightmare Libertarian AI enthusiast Peter Thiel and at some point that company is going to be linked to about every shady government security contract imaginable, local and overseas. It might be SkyNet in 30 years.
Last week vaccine news impacted the market for 2 days.

This week's vaccine news impacted the market for 40 minutes.

ITS EVOLVING!!
Nah Dunking on retards is way funner than earning real money. I'll just stay here.
FCEL touching me in the right places this morning
Whats the TSLA play at market open?
Looking good so far. CCL is already down 3% in premarket.
If it's up for the day, buy puts. If it's down for the day, buy calls. Weeklies. Take profits don't hold for too long this company is great but also a total pos. Or leaps.
Exactly. Wait for the market to sell off a little, BABA will go down with it. Then long AF
Imagine thinking COST isn't the millennial store of choice.

Ahhh that pre-market bleed. Is this what a . feels like?
I’m buying nio puts yall too hyped
stonks go up
I know better than to try and predict the market top.
Good luck.
Anyone else been holding Tesla calls since August 31? Las manos diamondes
Anyone who isn't dumping SPY hates dogs.
0.65% at premarket. That’s what bothers you?
About 4 minutes of algos buying at open
Damn. Well may tendies come to us all nevertheless!

Because why not
It is not unlikely that the FDA will approve. The thing is though, by approving it, the US economy will probably collapse into a sustained and spiralling long term depression. The infection rate will be rampant and this will be reflected in the loss of overall productivity accompanied by an increase in violent crime.

PLTR seems too high to buy into at $16 rn, specially with their most recent earnings
The PLTR sell volume is disgusting 

Why hold it back from the sky?
He uses Cash App
is it hopium telling you this
$LIT still holds a lot of $TSLA, one site says 8%, another says 3%. Looks like $PBW holds more $NIO than Tesla now. $ARKW is off & on, but a good ETF
A few days. It could get ugly.
Hopefully a pop today after getting through 16 premarket
OP didn’t respond because he’s a pussy and you decimated his argument. Guy has no balls & can’t handle volatility so he just “bUYs & HOlDs fOR tHE lOng TERm BrO.”
You need nio to crash. lol.

PLTR $20 Call 11/20
Well, technically a plan can be spun up overnight. Will it be good....? Most likely not. So yeah I guess were in agreement.
I am in US. I am going to day trade only stocks listed on AMEX;NASDAQ and NYSE
holy crap this is racist. are you assuming Nio is an asian company or something?
Cramer too high imo

Brace for a million TSLA gains screenshots today
Y’all ready for this 10:15 red to green pump?? 🤞🏼
Hi also a pharmacist. You used interim analysis to make your 7 day point. So you obviously know that this data isnt complete. You also know that this means not everyone has met the full follow up period. Its quite likely that 7 days is the only follow up that everyone met and therefore the endpoint. You cant assume effocacy only lasts 7 days off that. Especially with data we have on antibody production in the body and their subsequent half life. You should probably not be an outcomes analyst with this poor analysis.
We need nio to crash
I think 1st one most accurate
I finna love it
At least 5 times
Someone’s gotta take one for the team...  Thank you for your service!
he literally always does.

It's a 100% correct leading indicator at this point. It's never failed.
I have no idea whether to get in TSLA at open or not. On one hand it has hit 500 before but on the other, logically there would be a sell off. Luckily logic doesn’t work. Is anybody getting calls at open? Weekly 500s

Ok Zoomer. I definitely didn't start with that much money and I have more than 2 million in my account. It is possible. It can happen.  You just have to be patient and smart. When I got my first 10k I put it on apple and then from there picked and researched my balls off to make sure every cent earned me a cent. Don't sit here and tell me that 'rich get richer' bullshit when I've literally built my empire off of hard work.

I will say that if they actually lay out a plan like the one he mentioned, that'd definitely be bullish. I'm just saying it can't be spun up overnight.
What strike and date you going with?
Anyone can buy a call! It takes big balls to buy a $65 call expiring on Friday. Do it, faggit
so mango really did call the top yesterday lol
Damn, Taiwan raises are number one, imagine if was street cared about the "corporate social responsibility" mentioned in that article though

Gonna place an order for a TSLA 11/27 $500c for 6 times what its ask closed at yesterday of $0.69, but gonna round it up to the nearest 10s. So, I’m gonna throw out the limit for $4.20. It has to be done that way. Wish me luck! Highly doubtful it’ll even happen, but maybe I’ll get lucky. Elon would be proud, nonetheless, I’m sure.
it needs to do something. killing me.
If you insist, I can fuck you
I gotta say this is the best one out of all the meme videos I've seen here
tsla call?
yes
Lol cvs is pretty solid for a decade or two more.  once they keep working on that Aetna debt. The problem is Amazon isn’t for boomers and most meds go to old fuckers who don’t know what google is.

Yes but you’ll be keeping both. I use RH for positions and WeBull for information and 0DTEs
Does the market care about retail numbers?
Ok. Give me the pill you fucker.
Down
Correct
FCEL gang
Nio you dirty little whore hold through earnings
quite honestly I'm looking for a decline into december below 300. 240 specifically as the bottom before the next bull run. If you consider in pre-split terms, 240 would be a return to the support of the SECOND major bull run to 1200. From 1200 (240), I believe this will set up a long-term bull run to 1200 post split, which would be 6000 pre-split; the price target cathy wood made that ultimately turned TSLA into the meme it is today. I used to believe that was impossible, but post split pricing and retail ignorance seems it has the strength to push to a total market cap reflecting that value eventually, even if it is undeserved.
Cash right now, then probably fomo into tsla or just daytrade spy and the q’s
Down
I hope everyone that refers to puts as poots loses money every time
Wow these have been ripping, are we too late though?
😂😂
It was after hours. Market didn't open yet to place orders.

This is incredible. Thank you
I know absolutely jack shit about trading, I just got approved for options trading on WeBull, I got a $100 dollars, and I'm absolutely retarded. What's the play
sold covered calls against my shares, so couldn't exit pre-market.  just sitting here watching it fall.
If you don’t buy this PLUG dip, you ain’t black
You seem like a nice guy. May I advise to do other plays instead of the autistic one you just described. Many other valid plays you could make it doesn't have to be NIO!
Sorry, English is not my first language, I always make that mistake. fixed
SPY open: up/down/flat?

first correct guess gets gold
I don't care what u do to Ma, fuck him, fist him, lick him, finger him, rape him, tickle him, make love with him whatever, just make Xi happy again. BABA pls moon.

In an email Airbnb sends out. In the Q&A they say if you didn’t receive the email, you’re not eligible so be sure to check your spam folder.
My friend, be true to yourself, I think you're talking plenty of sense. People here like to buy OTM weekly calls, so there's a deep-engrained resistance to even acknowledge the possibilty that our 🌈🐻 fantasies will come to pass. What I keep coming back to is that it's stupid not to have a bearish hedge (in my case, leaning toward UVXY leaps.) It's also stupid ATM not to ride this bull market for all it's got and make tendies off of meme stocks. Will check out your tickers though, thanks.
I like how CNBC is putting up chyron's like it's yesterday morning at open and we aren't dumping 300 points at open.

Of course the one time I decide to buy PLUG calls is when it announces dilution on the same day.  At least I have my calls timed for March.
Why not saving 15 percent on your car insurance by switching to geico?
Cramer literally has far OTM Walmart weeklies. Shilling it UNBELIEVABLY hard
Do you know why it’s down?
i sincerely doubt its worth either of those #s
And NIO is worth half of them. Youre still proving my point dummy
[deleted]
yes. go anywhere else.
And bought pharmacies, which are about to get crushed by AMZN.  LOL.
Half bull half bear. Its a bearish warning that management needs to change their outlook so the company will not die. So bullish.....?
Depends what country you're in, PC or mobile. I suggest low spreads over low fees and mt4/mt5 for forex purposes. Get a vps, it's worth it if you're gonna get serious. If you're only day trading options ignore everything I said lol

Everyone thinking it would be NIO bulls vs bears today, but no one saw TSLA coming from the corner with a steel chair
>  Companies are definitely going elsewhere for labor when they can. 

Don't they also do that in country's like America where you can get fired straight away? 

I feel like Americans are always complaining about jobs being shipped oversees. At least the jobs we have left in our country have security, kind of nice when something happens (like covid) and you are not on your own from day 1.

TSLA 465C 11/20

TQQQ calls should be in the money at open
Positions?
He's assuming the op looks like shit from all the stress of trading
I can't stress this enough: piss off.
I would. Gonna be a while before Boeing will produce planes again
Is 55c 11/20 even realistic at this point? We thought it would be 50 by EOD yesterday.
😂👍
is that why they keep going down?
Might join you in case they do equity issuances again
I wanna short it around 50 but the iv is too much to swing, even on longer out plays. I’d day trade the momentum

ALL HAIL ELON!
Which colour though?
Definitely. Pre market gap up 60 dollars, first thought, fomo at open. Yea. Do it pussy.
I’m not saying I think it is but there are idiots who will call anything racist, right?
They’re too busy trying to buy calls now at open for the double fuck
SPY Calls at open?
Could be. It's not exactly bullish when one of your biggest investors says your current business model is crappy.
Bunch of price target raises for JD this morning. Maybe they help BABA too? I just want out.
EquityZen tryin to sell me instacart shares at $85 billion valuation when media outlets saying the IPO could be valued at $30 billion. WTF?

Just have money ok
Like a true autist
Id stay away until some good news comes out. Or buy leaps. This has been painful
I will never not watch this meme
I mean it’s incredible, but def not the best expiration
You sir, are a rich man.
Yes
I will
Back on easy mode
Hell yeah
How you feeling man. NIO’s up to it’s usual premarket antics yet again
So today is like yesterday but in reverse?
not conspiracy they. The major fund holders who trade competitively and want their year end bonuses locked in. It's just easier to say "they" dont make it a fat cats with cigars thing. Pumps happen it's not some conspiracy it's how the game is played.
I’m really curious to see how the markets react to confirmation that the recovery is backsliding
I agree. They already have over a billion shares outstanding (which is a lot more than Tesla even after its 5:1 split), but they need to build actual factories to produce enough cars if they are ever going to justify their valuation.
Happy Birthday COVID

Probably the best bet, however I see it dipping more...
I’m back. What’s the fucking play for NIO. Going all in for it.
Have a 85c leap. But it's really getting heavy. Hope it pops soon.
Lol, three week shutdown? How much you want to bet this shit ends up being 3 months.
Dilution
So JKS decided it didn't feel like releasing earnings??
SPY blood red but my tech stocks still flat to green.

Things are finally normal again
I'm so excited for the future.

Do the mafia Bros know something we don't?

Yea very legal that stocks don’t always go up wow what a shock
i hope you make the right choice. many tendies to you sir
I'd aim for $35+ on the 435 and $16+ on the 455. But I sure as shit wouldn't set a sell order and just walk off for open. Shit, I'd call in sick if I had to or make up some other bullshit excuse.
He's retarded if he did
Dont ask me, i'm autistic.
IDK if I should sell some SPR, I'm in with an average cost of $20
Elon declared King of Mars
But it won't. Its got that silent wsb retard strength.
EV market is heavily competitive and NIO isnt a clear winner. Their current valuation implies that the EV market will be huge in China and they will be dominant which isn't a guarantee not to mention where is there room for growth? Conversely PLTR has tons of room to run
Starting to worry about my WMT 😅
Maybe Amazon can just buy up everything in sight knowing they'll be broken up, and be just fine as Amazon, AWS, AmaDrone, etc.
The Trial is 25% placebo FYI
Wait today’s red 😎
Even if it’s not flat it’ll fuck everyone. Anyone trading NIO has the playbook from Tesla that occurred not long ago. I’m waiting until after earnings fo fade a spike up or I won’t touch it at all.
PLTR has actual, novel technology.  NIO is garbage.
I legit hate playing puts. So much stress holding overnight and impossible to time the exit
But after news of vaccine efficacy comes vaccine approval. And then comes vaccine delivery estimates. And then the average John has his first dose. And then news of 10% of americans being vaccinated. And in between them news Elon will tweet us breadcrumbs to keep the printer brr:ing.

Wonder which way we’ll go today. Up down or sideways
Yeah you're right. Can't help it either sometimes.

Account value is correct, the rest can get messed up
you might as well have taken your money and lit it on fire cause at least that way it gives you some light and warmth
I thought that for a little bit too but now my own personal stance on PLTR is that it can't be ruined by WSB.. TSLA gets talked about here more than any other stock, they seem to be doing alright. PLTR is going to be a fucking monster for a long time
ENRON
Earnings are today after market close. Hold them, NIO wil be 60 tomorrow.

Yes, the market was at a multiyear resistance level (going back to the 2018 crash) at the end of February, breath/sentiment indicators were very bullish coming off a 3 month bull run since the end of 2018 (market tends to inverse what most people expect), and historically the market usually dips in March anyway. A correction was in the cards, ‘rona just made the magnitude worse because everyone started panic selling when the correction started.

depends on your buying power. Just aim as far away as possible above 330.

12/31 385p, jan2021 330p, or march 280p are all probably going to be nicely priced at open barring some massive IV

Depends on your position and risk tolerance. If you’re already up may want to take the op to buy more in and average down cost if a little pop.

This isn't an announcement really, its been in the works for years. Very well priced in already, pharmacies have been prepping for this over the last 4 years since theyve taken forever to implement

The only money maker in pharmacy is vaccinations and healthcare services. Until amazon can offer those, their pill pack thing doesnt matter. They're likely losing money on scripts, but its worth retaining those customers for their retail segment

PLUG down big. Is it time to buy?
Not really no. Its a good way to make fast money but you'll never be able to predict hype. You can however. Research a company and figure out for yourself if the company has a good long term plan.
really need NIO to hit $55+ AH or im eating ice and cardboard sammies until next paycheck
TSLA is not going to 500 and 600 under these conditions and the inclusion is a liquidity event to allow breathing room for majoy holders to exit on top of 400 while you guys provide the exit on your buy orders. Think about this logically.

The major holders need to unload. If they unload at 400-420 the next support is 360 and then 330 and then sub 300. The moves down are always violent because nobody wants to be caught holding a car company valued like a space warfare company at ATH's or near to them.

The real play: selloff same day heavy but sustain above previous day

Fanboys: "it's just profit taking. double down and ride with us or forever hold your peace gay losers who dont gargle elon's ballsack daily wooooo

Continuation of the play: gap down following morning and crush the week but sustain above 370 which is where the put volume realllllly picks up.

What happens in all of this?

1. bears get slaughtered and sell today
2. bulls get rock solid and buy today
3. they pay for the losses on the decline with the call premium being issued on the pump
4. they reduce the payout on the downside by buying back most contracts for nothing during the first three hours of the day
5. they get rich and know you'll buy the next bull run anyways.

See the september 1-9 daily candles to understand the play visually.
EOD, or at least some point in the day. Bet it hits it at some point in the insane hype.

Look at 90 day charts and how it’s been behaving on pump and EV news. People are buying in as they don’t know what it is or their financial, and then it bleeds out after a week.
When does the new world order take into effect?

Probably a lot of volatility, profit taking, and other adjustments. Options are gonna spike right at open.

i bought tsla weeklies yesterday so my plan is to go buy a tesla
If I ever get a day off I'm writing the biggest, bestest, gayest gay bear post in the history of WSB.
What color Tesla we getting ?
Is “growth” really growth when the unit of currency measuring said growth is down by nearly as much? When factoring for a weak dollar, inflation, and QE it’s kind of inevitable that the market had nowhere to go but up.

Very cool and very legal pump to ATH last few weeks guys. Great job. Very impressive. You think we got enough of them? You think they bought? Alright alright, let's get this show on the road, that rug right there, yeah that one, no the one in the corner. Yeah that's the one. Give it a little tug. No, harder. HARDER! Yeah, that's it. Keep pulling that shit. \*sips coffee\*

Yeah, the only thing that sucks is I was really targeting the 39$ price point for a huge buy-in after the Citron news... but because we never made it there and AH was back up so you really couldn't get back in for less than 43$. The NIO bears are not talking anymore though lol

Unless you're starting with $500K, good luck with your investing approach and your 8% annual returns. Maybe you'll have $2 million when you hit retirement.

Yeah, 90%+ of the people here blow up their \~$10-20K accounts, but at least they fucking try...because honestly, and answer this honestly: what in the fuck is $2 million going to do for you at age 67? At that point, money doesn't matter as much and you can live off your $3K/month pension with your wife's $3K/month pension (plus social security). People here are trying to reach the dream by age 30-35, not 67 (however statistically unattainable is irrelevant). Honestly? I have a hell of a lot more respect for people here who YOLO than condescending fucks like you. Enjoy your $2M at age 67...which will be worth around $1.2M in today's dollars.

I think I might pass on the TSLA scalp today. I’d like to see more strength on /NQ and the broader market, I’d also like to see TSLA break and hold above this resistance above 463ish. We’ll see though, it can change at open
Yes
roll that shit out bro, if you think it's gonna keep going up, get farther out OTM calls so you can get more gains

Would it though, the market didn’t collapse because the fed administered a massive adrenaline shot. It’s doubtful the fed can take steps on the same scale again, and if it could it’s doubtful that it’ll have the same efficacy. Not saying markets will crash since they’re full of hopeium, but it shouldn’t be surprising when that runs out
it's green every premarket

Please sell that, if it goes up more, then yeah I guess you missed out on some profit. Hard to be mad at 260% tho. Lock it in.

Careful not to get burned my friend. I had same tactic with Tesla and it fucked most of my gains when I didn't sell at high. Be prepared to pull cord. I would keep a couple of positions open and as market high hits sell some others as you go. Best of luck!

are my projections about future earnings just way off. or are people really going to own equities with small yields?

 I would just consume more to travel & get drunked or something rather than have tiny returns. 

If its not a easy no-brainer decision to invest something for the future because of the huge benefit I expect  im just going to spend my money  as I go. Im doing some trades when they come but no way im buying more because TINA or some other silly reason. Theres always an alternative. For me I think its just enjoy life as it because you live in the present.

>Among surveyed investors, 91% expect the economy to be stronger in the next 12 months, and 66% believe that global growth is in an early-cycle phase as opposed to a recession. Fund managers also haven’t been this optimistic in their global profit expectations since 2002.

Lmao, so everyone is optimistic about the future for the first time in ages. Seems to me like the 'explosive growth' train is still getting revved up and we'll hit something stupid like SPY-400 before the real top.

Man, once you hit an earnings play (NIO has an implied swing of 20%+ tonight) it’s hard to play anything else!
She got too stoned off that vaccine hopium and is now puking on herself
I bought SPY puts at market close. Hopefully I can offset the pounding the 🐭 gave me a few days ago and break even 🙏🏾😢
Puts 🥳
People are still playing weed sticks?? Just as bad as tanker gang
I just realised. Old people are the biggest consumers and they are all either fucked up from covid or not leaving their houses lol

Chipotle burrito with guacamole
I got Jabra 75T Active and they are waterproof and got active noise canceling delivered per update recently. Also 50 bucks cheaper than Airpods and available in black and other colors.
lol rotate. retarded yolo is the term you're thinking about I believe
Buy buy buy
FCEL FOSL BLNK NIO SOLo (before dump) were a great investments hype
Think about how important they are to the Taiwanese economy
Anyone else’s robinhood total not updating correctly?
I get that but Elon gets closer to his monstrous pay day and there's not other catalysts coming after this besides deliveries and random WSB/softbank pumps

Maybe a good time to average down?
Always take profit. Reinvest different strike or date but take your 260% and run
HD didn't tank. its the usual post earnings low volume sell off premarket shenanigans.

I hope it pulls back, I want to buy in and sell premium.
Some googling results in...Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) completes the deal to spin off its Upjohn business and combine it with Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL) to form Viatris (VTRS), which will start trading tomorrow under the ticker symbol VTRS. Pfizer stockholders received ~0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock for every one share of Pfizer common stock held as of Nov. 13 and they retain the same number of Pfizer shares they held before the transaction.
Thanks for that insightful commentary.
Lol I wonder if those people bought at the recent 3k bottom
Never buying puts in docu again

1 thing to remember is WMT tanked last earnings much like it is now while TGT absolutely mooned on earnings. Both beat expectations so theres hope TGT does same
You are double dipping sir: investment advice from the WSB gurus and therapy ... I hope you paid in advance for our yearly membership
I have $16.80 in my robinhood account what should I yolo on
So we all can agree on it today: dump TSLA, buy NIO and XPEV. Great. Now go do it
So SLave Masters are insulated. It's Great for EVERYONE then.
One of the two
The one.. where I lost 11k with credit spreads

nah no position,  hate earning plays. but figure friday's candle looks like a blowofftop
NIO going to do the same shit as every other stock on earnings recently. IV fuck your holes with a bent in half double headed dildo so you can break your DP cherry.

It will need to be, at least as of end of day yesterday, upwards of 56 to make money on calls.

It will probably end up at like 51 or something tomorrow and everyone loses.
So how ridiculous is the IV for TSLA going to be at open?
 "\[A\] topping process is underway," [says Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/bofa-says-market-is-so-bullish-it-s-time-to-sell-on-vaccine-news?sref=DWzi38c2&source=news_body_link).

Gotta go big on these potential 24% swings.
Sell
It barely ran and will really max out at $18-20 in a slow climb up. Long game get some gains but I don’t think it moons
I actually hate Walmart
I dont usually post here, but here is a ticker $SE. Just released Q3 results, YoY is roughly 100%. Raised guidance by a third or something. However, stock is down premarket because of a change from non-GAAP to GAAP accounting, which shows the results as a miss instead of a huge beat in seeekingalpha and elsewhere. Otherwise, SEA is well oiled machine firing on all cylinders (e-gaming and digital entertainment with Garena, e-shopping with Shopee).  
Im in and expect this to appreciate today greatly when folks understand the math behind it.   
It is -3% premarket as I am writing this, expect it to go at least 3 in the plus IMO.
Everything going down today!
From what I'm gathering it's the last of the Chinese evs to do their earnings and as long as nio was up they were staying up. But I'm a degenerate gambler that only bets the long shot
No Tesla? Ban this guy
Yolo bro bro
12/24 600c?

Last week TSM announced a 20% raise for all its employees. Interesting that HD tanked on the same move whereas TSM is hitting new highs.

Doesn't macro show us we are on a economic growth downtrend with I creased credit tightening since 2018 and corona just sped that up? Yet you have all calls.

Hopefully this doesn't come across as rude. I'm genuinely curious what your macro thesis is
Lmfaoooooo
dips keep getting bought up, it was regularly falling to 15.5'ish yesterday morning
What dip
My guess is it did calls then puts! Just remember that!!!
How is it fading it’s up pm
A lot
You’re goatified for that bro
Does it get worse than Jeremy pivin? Fuck that dude
FSR being red premarket means more people will buy at open and will be bigly green today. simple science really
Bobby Axelrod wanted to do that but he couldn’t get approved
Gloss over this for fun, don’t take any advice besides life advice. Too many high schoolers with $100 talking out their asses.
What the 411 on PLUG? I don’t understand the hype
No but I own those and they are now ITM. Waiting for a dip to pick up more 11/19/21 18c
Same but 12/31. Should I be scared?

Doubt it'll crash today. Not that big of news.
i swear if a random green dildo sends SPX back above 3600 after it literally took all night to break, im writing a stern letter to my senator
Buy the dip!

Holding slv now is equivalent to hearing your wife’s boyfriend railing your gf in the next room and you watching stupid rocks on a screen do nothing .

The metals run is gone
Should pull back a small bit today imo - market is red, so people will fear a pull back etc.

Should continue tomorrow though

Why are Kevin and the assistant manager from the buy more in this video
Yeah man.  You have calls currently?  I might get a few calls as a hedge if I find one of decent value today.
15 min candles has made me so much less of a crackhead
This is not the way
Buy PLTR while its cheap don’t regret it a few weeks later when it’s too expensive
But how many pumps do you suggest before dumping our loads?
In all my years of trading I’ve never seen an opportunity as good as NIO. I plan to rotate 100% of my portfolio in it today.
Are Feb 2020 considered leaps?
I'm thinking it wont go straight down. Ev market is going to have a day since everyone has tesla on the mind. But fuck if it did
After months of playing PLUG the day I decide to go heavy in shares and calls they have a stock offering and it crashes 12%. What are the fuckin chances
I like it. I hope the same, I bought a couple calls to ride this wave and then flip them to puts and plan on regular news on the earnings. But I'm a retarded gambler that only knows how to hail Mary
Sub rotation into tesla today
lmao
Solid meme. Also one of the funniest scenes from parks and rec 8/10 from me dawg
what’s TSLA gonna look at market open??

setting up for a fatty dump at open. 

any dip buyers left?
fuck you retard
Research is for gays
Imagine being a bank right now. Make a loan, pocket the fees and top line, pass the bag to Fed. Goddamn, we should start the bank of WSB.
You got my hopes up lol 😭
Positions? buy ROPE. Cause if you fuck with Options thats where it will end. always. If you want real money. do spreads.
Oh well, I feel you. AMD is a highly manipulated stock.
Be a big boy and pick your own positions y'all, nobody can tell you what will make you money
PLUG was doing so good...
Good luck lol
...Profit?
retails sales down. but HD same store comp sales up 24%. incredible bullish for HD. retail around them is declining while they go against that trend.
WMT is a hillbilly stock.   
TGT is different. It will run up till about noon on earnings.   
I played it last time and came out well.   


I'm hesitant to play this time around because it's already at ATH and Covid/Lockdown hysteria is priced in.
[deleted]
No retail data is not good, I have no idea who thinks it is. The bigger question is will the market react since everyone knew everything would go to shit again after the initial recovery
This is very true. Never going back to wired earbuds
yea, no way of telling, but ima get a couple puts incase

TSLA doesnt formally join the S&P 500 until december 21. Do you think a run up until then is possible?
Welcome to Amazon, I love you.

Yup

"Economy" is just a fancy word to describe what the Fed does.
not with biden as president and the pro-corporate cabinet he's looking to nominate.
Exactly
Harsh bro.
You are right, SPY 380 by December 1st!
missing the point. If Gamestop was already a decent company, there would be no contrarian play right now. I would not have been able to start buying up shares from $6/share.

if gamestop was actually a decent company, they would be worth over $200/share right now because they would probably have been smart enough to buy out Twitch back in 2013. Instead the dumbass bean counters decided to "diversify" by buying Spring Mobile for $700 million (Amazon would later buy Twitch for $970 million the year after that)
I found the letter.  Thanks!
Do you only look at 1 min candles???
Too much to explain
Got a couple of $160 walmart calls for December 18th.

Should be safe
Are we perhaps talking about securing a TSLA and PLTR partnership?

That’s for importance/significance if event I believe

yes, cause we're on an uptrend it'll get bought heavily there and we continue to the blow off top

Also, fuck you $GDRX
Think Palantir pulls back at all or keeps on running today?
Bro stfu
Why does retail sales say bullish of 3 bulls on investing.com? Doesnt that look stupid as shit or is retail data actually good
Imagine thinking the floor on SPX is dollars off the ATH
What gives you the thought that it would have such a large run

That's fucking peanuts. These guys are getting fleeced. Puts all day.
Don’t learn, these guys are all retards and want you to lose your money. Just hold shares and you’ll only have to pay 20% long term capital gains tax. Not the most entertaining one but it’ll save your mental health and wallet
I meant you’re beating the market for now. Until you’re not

Are you selling or holding?
Walmart from 155 to 150 the past 2 hours. never play this stock because the float is so high. so many boomers ready to dump their shares on any small spike.
I mean this is just my guess.  But NIO is up 2400% for the year; NIOs massive gains have been going on for months almost nonstop; we pretty much know the entire pipeline of what to expect with NIO (EU expansion, new SUV coming out, hopefully sells 100k next year) etc... we know all this stuff.  So one would assume it’s priced in.   Finally, everyone is bullish on this stock, so it makes sense for deep pockets to want to wipe out calls in the short term (even though long term NIO is a winner).  That’s my thoughts but nobody really knows.  NIO could could just always for up perpetually. Who knows.
So for NIO, the numbers we are looking for that supports the rumors is 100,000 cars sold in the last quarter.  Also something about how much Andrew Left's ex's lover has invested in it?

And once the news hits after the bell, sell?
I'm the biggest fucking moron when it comes to selling Tsla
No, that was a great move.
I will always upvote this me-me

I feel sorry for all these Autist's who are flooding into plug like it's a late night orgy spot.  Andy Marsh is 100 percent going to keep diluting shares like he did in 08,14, 15, and 18.  This is almost Luckin' levels of craziness.
If it hits 500 I might buy puts
I remember people saying a bunch of big investors have their shares locked in nkla until November. Anyone know a more exact date?
It raises over time and I think accounts for something like 10% of the cost of items. So would you pay 10% more so the MCD worker doesn't have to also be on SNAP and other forms of assistance? Taxpayers subsidize a huge chunk of Walmarts wealth by supporting their workers because their wages are garbage.
You hold bitch
sounds like a good life
PLTR fading bros 😔 time to go long on $ROPE
Why? The inclusion is very big news and potential catalyst and TSLA still far from all time high.

man what happened to SLV... silver was supposed to go to 50 in mid-August when everyone piled in... hasn't moved in 4 months... stuck at 23.
I’m reading this while I’m pooping so it’s like a speed boost in a video game.
Typical market WMT beats earnings and drops
Wow maybe the stimulus really was helping multiple different aspects of our economy i.e. retail
Lol

I bought a few 11/20 TSLA $420 calls at around 2:30p yesterday simply because of the meme of it. Luck and a bit of immature stupidity.

sooooo not to ruin the fun today, but is it time to get rid of TSLA?
Doubt it. Disney is a clear indicator of why they won’t
Uhhhhh? Why would you post genuine advice here, don't you know where you are? Retarded Tendies or Bust.
Soooo BABA what we do today...
I feel like everyday it’s all of us retards going to war with the MMs. And we get beaten down so hard but we have a few of those artists who are gifted fighters hittin 10000% profit on their accounts. FUCK MMS
It's gonna fill the gap and bounce hard around 457, get ready boi
In at 3.00 with 1000 shares but I was a boomer and sold covered calls to make a mere 20% gain on my investment :\
Yeah TA works faintly imo. You can’t argue some of those TA resistance points are pretty clear and precise. 

Problem for me is it all depends on what window/chart you’re looking at which makes it less accurate/predictable and then these guys go off on their crayon jokes lol
Licking their chops because of the kickbacks? I agree
I look at price first. Then I look at their earnings history. I don’t like over paying

weak premarket sell off for HD. probably rips 1-2% at open
Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.
Just stay cash. The minute people pile into puts, this shit skyrockets to ATH.
Its funny how people think this way. As a person that runs a business I will give you a very basic understanding of how a small business will handle this massive increase in payroll. Pass it on to YOU the consumer. You can't possibly think a business will just eat the loss😆
But it do
The decline in retail sales is really really bad news imho.
nice job retail
If I was bezos I would smack my own ass on the daily
PLTR 16c 2/19/21 and 18c 11/19/21

Awful retail sales numbers! Missed by 67% on what was already expected to be a big drop from previous...
Wrong forum unfortunately
In short you are a pussy
yeah good call as soon as i posted this it started bouncing up again. I've got 10 $17p 11/20 bought at .40 hoping to sell at around 1.6 for a 4xer
Apologies then, carry on
WMT is a good example of how im going to get fucked tomorrow with TGT

I think it will backtest the trend line at 448 right at open (that is where I would load the $500 weekly yolo) then slow and steady run up to 510 through this week. My opinion. GL!
**SO YOU COMPLETELY IGNORED CONSUMER SENTIMENT 10% MISS... AND YOURE SURPRISED? LMFAO**

Nobody uses technicals anymore bro.
Are we crashing again?
It would go to 22.98 on the news then bleed down to 20.03 after
I’ve had this Dow 30k hat since 2018 man lmfao

Imma be slightly less stupider and buy after da profit taking. So at least I’ll feel like I had a chance before da money goes up in flamez.

I was thinking shares. Xpeng went up w earnings recently so I'm going nio does too. If nio doesnt I have shares so I can hold.
No clue what you’re talking about...  AMZN, TSLA, and NIO bulls are sipping on champagne with their Wheaties this morning!
Nope I didn’t not
You're on it.
Is this off of retail sales data? Is that bullish or bearish.

“crashing”
Aren’t nio earrings today
You can do it
One of us is right
Fuck it dumping 6K into $PLUG 11/27 $24 calls at open. This is the strongest stock I’ve seen and I really think we’re running to 100 within the next 2 months
Give me something to play!!!!!!

If anything we agree with the Jokes but it kinda works?????
Gonna be down 30% by open, Jesus. It hit my SL last Friday but I ignored it...not sure how many times I have to learn that lesson 🤦‍♂️
What’s your play here? Sell at open? Or continue to hold?
Cause this kind of info can determine the volume of a stock...you know the info that you so desperately want to know?
Then mine are fucked. 320 1/15
they think it don't be like that
Should i close the puts i sold?
This dude is probs playing spreads so your point is invalid

Get in SEA now still loads of room to grow.  Huge market.
Yep with everything you have
Just put the phone away, do something to distract yourself during market hours, then check your phone AH and rejoice in the tendies
It's right above an old small gap and around 460 resistance. Might fluctuate a bit but I believe it's gonna have another run up in my opinion.
Kodak gonna be releasing their ev rendering soon
Anyone else hoping the bear rips his fucking arm off, spits it on the ground, then feeds the guy his bear snacks?
If it breaks 463 it goes to 510.

You had me in the first half... mods please change flair
NIO puts.
I needed to hear this, I just started 2 weeks ago and haven’t been sleeping more than 3-4 hours a night. Also started options and haven’t made a single profit. Good thing Robinhood limits how much I can put in per week. Thanks fam
oh man so bulls are actually fucked
Well it jump 13% and people can buy shares pre and post market so of course it’s priced in

Go for it. See what happens! This is how we learn.
Proof or ban
I got like $300 left in my account what’s the play today boys
check newest posts ... damn
Pretty much priced in pre market but fuck it yolo
Yea, that's basically it. New board sounds less old school. They are nearly at their predetermined cash threshold to reintroduce a dividend soon. But that probably won't happen until after my options expire, hence why I'm deep shares. 

$4C is a run-up bet that they'll be where they were pre earnings before new years. They were .11 a pop when I bought them before Halloween. Gonna add a few today
Why does the economy even matter when 1% of people own 98% of the worlds wealth?

Oh this dude is actually gay
Finally!!! My options were bleeding 🩸
GSE is def going to close EB Games (AU) Q1 2021
Is there any actual technical analysis to support TSLA 500 eod? Somebody mentioned it’s current channel could easily run to 510, is this true?
Go for it. See what happens! This is how we learn.
>Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine. Your absolute risk reduction would be 0.39%, which means getting the COVID-19 vaccine reduces your chance of contracting the disease by 0.39% (0.0039).

I think you should enroll in some basic math courses and learn how to calculate percentages lol
What do they do
Keep going 🐻
This retard is going to be crying in a few weeks when it’s still pumping. TSLA cannot die. It’s all up a huge hill until at least 2030. For those wanting to buy now, buy and DO NOT SELL until years out. You can thank me later
I didnt come here to do math
BABA finally moving
Youtube
I mean, shes probably going to run away with the boyfriend, so you got that going for ya.
Leave. Now.
Start cheap and start a few contracts a piece.  Pick expirations months out in case you get it wrong.
I think it’s a bull trap going to occur today.  Either sideways or a little up. Then plummet after hours.  My plan is, depending on the movement today, to either buy puts throughout the day or just wait until power hour and buy puts.
I expected a little more action but i guess it was all in the gap up. Or else waiting for market open. I bought one share ha as a reminder to check calls later.
"No one is selling" implies there’s simply no better equity on the market that could do better in the near term

All the cool kids are buying shares of PLTR 🚀
I actually think its realistic.
Apparently following market hype makes me more money than DDs so.....
My sleep tracker graph matches up perfectly with the 15 minute candle chart of the S&P 500 futures.
Look up what the Greek letters mean, look up different strategies, and most importantly buy options that aren’t crazy otm and set stop losses unless you like huge loss porn
"safe" and "day trading"?
What stimulus they aren’t even talking about it anymore.
Just do monthly itm moves, aka buying options on strikes already in the money and at least a month out so u dont get killed
So the existential question is : to buy TESLA at open?
Umm. A few of those are selling calls at 415 and 470, this trade isn’t a slam dunk unless you cover those. Since this is wsb, I am assuming those are naked calls.
I’m the artistic sheriff. Looks like your license was suspended last month
I want to hold nio through er but I'm not sure if I feel like being that stressed out.

I think in the next year or two - they likely outperform expectations. Remember that 45% figure mgmt gave doesn't include new states legalizing in Q4 or early next year. So when that happens they'll most likely beat earnings on paper. Also look out for large states like FL, TX legalizing.

They're starting from such a low base in revenue that these sorts of increases we're talking about i.e. 45% y/y aren't all that impressive, but more a necessity. As their revenue base grows, I expect it to be harder for them to continue growing at these large percentages from let's say 2023 revenue-on. That's my take.
Space Karen is Daddy 🤤
You think it will drop today or after earnings? Or both?
Tsla free money
They’re still gonna post man don’t worry. They secretly love the horoscope jokes and shit posting too. They wouldn’t post here if they didn’t lmao
Wtf was the deal with that pump eod yesterday. It's just going to get wiped out the next day???

What's your strike and exp?  I got 280 12/18.  People saying that strike is way too out the money.
I mean Tesla has a long way to run and as long as CCL doesn’t BK then the dividends alone are gonna be more than the S&P500 will return annually
I’d take $5 bucks.
This is a very wise post. It gives direction and tackles those intrusive "what if" thoughts.

TSLA calls at open or wait for a dip?
WMT tanked after 6 out of the last 8 ER. The time to get in for 3-6 month calls is now. Saw some great DD the other day saying that they were primed for a jump in the period after earnings due to rolling out a subscription service like Prime
I don’t! I appreciate any tips or tickers that are interesting.

Dare you to say that to his face.
What's going on with PFE?
I mean spx is up 9% in 2 weeks so I'd say it deserves a little break.

There's plenty of shitty companies they can dump.
Step 1: be born wealthy

Step 2: profit
ZIRP helps flow of credit but activity has to pick up. The thing that propelled us out of GFC was the software boom (app store, fb, amazon...etc). This time they are trying to do it with green shit (electric cars, solar panels,...etc). Issue with that is the cost of entry to software is small for individuals (free apps, websites)... Who the hell can afford an electric car that's made in America? China is gaining an even bigger advantage on green tech because we can manufacturer our own shit. Either way, Trump is going to attack everything Biden does to cause volatility.
For every 100 PFE share you get 12 VTRS share. Do the math.
I'm bleeding on baba. I keep buying more calls. I need help, I might actually be retarded and no one I know has the guts to tell me the truth.
Gawker was a media company.  Only thing their journalists did was state a fact that Peter Theil is 🌈.  

The great thing about America is that you can bankrupt and intimidate your enemies just by tying them up in court.  Also the endless appeal sysytm.

Theil can go after anyone he sets his target on.  The more baseless the class, the larger the legal fees!

That threat alone should stop shitron from ever typing the letters PLTR in sequence.
I was about to post the same lol wtf
If you actually listened and got calls that’d be 100%-1000% depending on what part of the spectrum your autism falls on

im up 1500% this year after believing how it wasnt possible to beat the market for way too long
So retail sales in 3 minutes. Maybe that’ll pump
i think of this whenever something I'm holding is up like 15% in a week. Boom there's S&P gains for a year, market beaten.

so tsla calls at open?
NIO

PM trying to Hold Down NIO before the OPEN. Expect HEAVY BUYING at the OPEN. Big Banks want IN. 

NIO $100+ EOW.
I am pulling every penny i have out of this market the day the fed announces they are ending QE, or if they even hint at raising rates.
I saw many people saying go all in on EV Calls yesterday and was thinking,  "heh, retards" instead of listening

BABA is super cheap.

This is the spinoff stock for Pfizer. Do you own Pfizer? Because PFE shareholders get VTRS

Leave NIO alone!!!!

That's it. That's the play
Yes, like in EVOO

Market makers already delta hedged and thats basically the move after algos bought in. So it already happened, MMs bought shares to be delta neutral again. But this could lead to another gamma squeeze where people buy otm calls at open and push the stock further up.
Amazon 3300c mid january, easy money
How does xpev charge its vehicles?
Cool cool good dodge there
His name was Skychansky. RIP.
Jack Ma decided to piss off Xi
So is amazon gapping the hell up at open is it to late to get in
Who doesn't sell your data these days tho?
With regards FCEL and PLNTR:  I feel like a mule with a spinning wheel.  I’ve got no idea how I got them, and I don’t have a clue what to do with them.

The break even price is that price on the expiration date. Do you still have the contract? If so you'll be green at 9:30am lol

Crashing through the stratosphere on its way to Mars?
😂😂😂😂😂
Is buying calls at open will avoid getting crush by IV?
NIO does battery swaps, don’t think XPEV does
DKNG is pumping hard. Hope it actually holds the gains this time.
Yes they only go after chain pharmacies for easy money, they never actually shut down prescribers.
Im in the same boat , down 30%
U just bought them?

Position?
[deleted]
So, just long straddle?
I like the second to last point about TSLA would help rally anything EV
I need BA to just die
🚀
Totally agree. My local HD hires a lot of retired tradesmen and their knowledge deserves good pay. Last weekend I had a tricky job with a service entry into my garage ended up at HD to get some parts. Got advice from an HD employee that was an old master electrician and he helped get me back on track.

The red line is GAAP earnings for SPY, the other line is PE ratio.

We have been rallying on earnings mostly being shit essentially, and lets not forget the trillions that were spent by the government to even get these earnings, they would be significantly lower without all the stimulus.
LOL

SE reversal at open

Send a pic of yours and we'll compare ;)
What are some good calls? got a grand do dump right now
Why didnt you tell us? No one likes an individual when we are suppose to be a community. You should be ashamed of yourself for with holding information.

This is the way.

Eh, his emphasis on

> NO ONE FUCKING KNEW.

is a little out there. Lots of people expected this. The exact timing was unclear, sure, but it's not like this came out of nowhere. People have been talking about this for months (or even years, but for months of it actually qualifying).
Agree, it has room to run up to about $510 in the current channel. No reason it won't hit that....
[deleted]
This guy fucks
Here’s some NIO info for you tards:

-ER is AFTER HOURS

-IV is over 200%

-On day of Shitron report, NIO opened over $6 from the prior days close

-It’s already pretty accepted NIO is gonna beat based off latest delivery numbers

-I would NOT FOMO your life savings today without at least having a day trade. If you plan to hold through earnings you’re playing with fire if you’re holding weeklies

-TSLA news last night could be a catalyst for huge movement throughout entire EV sector today. 

-O’Doyle rules

Positions: 11/20 calls, bought during Friday dip, of 44-48.
I think it's in CNY. Probably a bug.

It's the same for the other chinese EVs lmao.
I mean it needs another gap up...do you think its possible for tesla to get another 10% today?
Same
Waiting for $5,000 EOY
Stocks always drop after earnings no matter the result unless they’re EV
Stonks only go up
straddle NIO earnings 😎
I did spy puts, your welcome
Need confirmation bias that Nio is going to crash
It's actually pretty good at getting wind of the most important info as it relates to the markets. Somebody is always on and posting at all hours of the day.
[deleted]
Also any reason why BABA is so undervalued at the moment?
[deleted]
Just got Copped  100 dollar fine hopping the turnstile otw to work. I laughed in the bitch cops face cause I’m boutta make 10x that one Tesla today.
You forgot to factor in the 2016 dollar has more buying power
Tbh the only negative aspect about nio was the pump and dump... slowly growth like today or yesterday is so much better
Market watch and trade gate are what I use for prices, other than that reuters can be good and yahoo finance. Only just started routers. And my wife's boyfriend tells me hot picks
That’s still a thing?
Earnings expectations for all were revised downward by like 60% retard. Not hard to beat when the expectation is .00001 cents profit
Buy some TSLA calls. Things about to head to mars itself

Calls on fish penicillin
We've had 8-9 green candles out of the past 11-12 days in the Dow and SPX > mkts need a pullback before more moves up > I believe spy should test $352 this week
nio calls, or puts. One of them will make you a lot of money.
I've only heard from the alt righters that it drives inflation. Wouldn't McD's  personnel cost basically double?
Company you had shares in went bankrupt.
>GDRX 

what's gonna make it moon?
Tesla at open anything you can afford
They said they’ll decide in dec
The algos are going to fuck with us hard at open. Don’t be scared boys
There is no demographic that simultaneously uses aligay and shopify. None
Tesla is a bubble and will pop sooner or later. Nobody can tell you when, thats up for you to decide.
Shoulda had TSLA calls
im actually pretty impressed how well SPX 3600 is holding

shit been getting straight hammered all night
Tesla 500$ eod or eow. Sure bet.
NIO OR XPEV TECH IS BETTER?
True. We should pay them like $1 an hour so companies can moon.
Guessing Amazon Pharma news + release of sub numbers can’t match hype ?
So we’re all buying TSLA weeklies right?
1k cash to option. Pick
Yes
It will become a forgotten penny stock or THE death star

Really interested on what NIO will do after ER
Inverse your fomo
Is that good or bad idk anything you just said
well if it dumps on you today then you'll know what sell the news means. I don't play tsla but I know it's the exception to the rule so i'm likely wrong.
How many people get a severe immune response even with the carbon added to these crispr vaccines?
It always falls after earnings. It will continue to drop too
My only complaint is that it’s not a 3x ETF
FUCK
when is the announcement that RKT will join the S&P :(
It’s not over til it’s over though!  I bought AMZN calls for $19k a few weeks back and was down $17k and sold them for a $2k gain just 2-3 days later!  💎 🙌
so bullish yes?

Lived in China 4 months. They all shop on taobao, jd, and alibaba. Nobody uses shopify there.
Ahhh okay. Makes sense
FUCK YOU, BEZOS! LET US LIVE!!!!
Well yeah if you wanna yolo your whole account on one trade then on tos you can only make one day trade everyday.

But I’ll make probably 20-25 day trades in a week. Whereas with RH you can only make 3, even if they’re big trades.
Nio 🚀🚀
It will be back down to $50 in a year or two when people finally wake up to the fact that we are at GFC level economic activity. Mango's craziness is what's kept everything alive for past 6 months.
God speed but.. other vaccine researchers probs looking to release "good news". That or news networks will be digging it up
Sold yesterday. Is that too early?
Lmao. 20$ an hour is the lowest salary in Denmark. Calls on $DKNG
We'll see what prices are at open but 500 should be within 5% which is nothing crazy.

Baba calls
Good idea
It's a projection, so not really
My calls sure do hope so.
EV companies have stupid hype, dangerous to bet against them.  But really, what kind of fucking moron designed that car.
You want your lawn leaf bags with a side of Covid?
Either I’m going to be laughing all day or crying, with these BABA calls today.
No, I’m referrring to it about to be over-reacted sell off @ AMZN pharma news, giving a good entry for near term.
fuc u gai man
Suspicious price action right now on NIO. We know that nobody is selling.
Thanks for supporting my ex’s like that then. Sorry I’m not in the vids as much recently
No, it won’t. This is a fallacy that’s been touted by alt right ding dongs for decades. It’s been proven hundreds of times that raising minimum wage does not affect businesses.
Same play but with a 22 strike. Agreed that if this thing oscillates for a year under $20, fuck me.
thoughts on FCEL calls?
haha, i have experienced this myself
Lmfao
Got like $800 cash gang I don’t know what to do with
Pls pls pls
I know. Im fucked. But well it happens. Wasnt that much money luckily but still hurts

Not really. This is already in place in so many places.

Ohhhh... I thought you were saying $520 for some gain.  You just don’t wanna see red.  Sorry mate.

Yahoo finance app is hilarious for the comments - but seriously don’t go off their advice. 

Nasdaq.com is good for lots of information like pre/after markets if your current trading app doesn’t provide all the figures.
AMZN bro.  Breaks my heart too cause GDRX is a good company doing good things :-/
Wow shit just dropped
I also have a couple stacks in Bloom Energy (have heard good and bad things about this company however it is the leader in solid oxide cell production (different from hydrogen cells)) and Ballard Power, a Canadian hydrogen cell company based in Vancouver who have decent profits selling hydrogen buses and trucks to places in Europe and China. Ballard Power also signed a deal with Audi regarding Audi using their products in their production.
Good for the Economy... Great for stocks. Bad for slave masters.
Bloomberg showing red asia and euro indexes and then has eod yesterday for the US as heavy green , lmao
How much do home deport employees make ?

Wtf is all this talk of wages up for employees that just tanked my HD$ stocks
Can someone share the image again?
This is going to be a multiple day run ending in the 500s somewhere. You safe to enter anytime below 500
Yeah but so much as I'm bearish on the stock but rather for a nice decent quick dump today after 14% in two days 40% in 3 weeks and bc I thought the mkts would be red today
They have always been great at manipulating the "sorority girl" crowd

Ok

So dont help the poors

Dont go to college

And keep wages low

Well im a dumb fuck from the midwest, maybe ill vote for you
Got sick of the theta decay on my FCEL calls and exited my positions on Friday. Fuck me.
There is no reason we are down almost a percent today, right?

Why the fuck did I wake up to GDRX in the dumpster? Wtf happened? Anyone?

Down then up
520. Like i said above😂
As a kid, I loved the book, " The Little Call that Couldn't"
Thats what everyone does here though
You’d be better off asking that Google guy.
Don’t count tendies before they bake. I had pltr puts last week and they always looked good premarket then faded at open. 

Holding ccl 16.5p 11/27 and hoping the trend down continues at open.
Hate to tell u retards but TSLA S&P500 inclusion been priced in since Julyish
Why do a research when stocks only go up
Since this is the smartest place I come for market advice/analysis, anyone want to give me a guaranteed 20-30% play for today?
Thats a whisper directly in youre ear.
when they start talking about helping the workers it means top is in.
I'm there with you bro. This is absolute insanity but its a double edges sword. Not only are people overleveraged on the market, there are institutions who rely on the market for survival. This is a double whammy that people don't realize, its not just the Fed printing money to dealers. The treasury has been lowkey pumping money to companies (hamiltonian economics).
Nah
Woulda been perfect if you shorted end of jan
Isn't that too expensive? Or I'm gonna have to go super out of the money huh?
get a load of this pre teen who honest to God believes that you make more money on options than stocks. Let me ask you something. How many times does your account have to blow up before you take the hint?

Absolutely no clue whats about to happen today.. any ideas?

Anyone here believe pre-market pricing is fucking retarded
If there is a pull back market open have to see if it shows some strength on a bounce or else I’m out
Such a flaccid pre market right now
I'm not a bear and I can see this hype will pass in like 2 weeks. These vaccine news are just some justification to inflate the market, trick people into giving away their money to later on pull the rug.
The stock price drops by $10 the day of payout.
Pfizer's prevnar pneumonia vaccine has NNT much much worse and still approved by FDA.  The FDA doesn't care how effective as long as it's statistically significant.
[deleted]
If you’re bullish on NIO but worried about the high IV then sell ATM or slightly ITM puts, this way you take advantage of the high premiums and profit when it pops after earnings
RIP WMT naked call and put holders
Cash in airline puts or ride down
No its called outside
nah we gon keep inflating this shit fuck a triple top
Y’all gonna get Tesla calls at open or hold onto your balls for the first hour?
What’s the strike price?
LI to 50 eow
Let’s go amazon !!!!!!
Wanna post this is  few more reddit groups for good.measure?
They meet more than once a year
How much are people making there ?
Doesn’t sound right, usually good peripheral vision is a prey thing not predator. All in 500c weeklies.
"Be kind. Rewind."
Puts at 18 per share was the most guaranteed money maker weeklies on odds ive done in months.
Number are confusing.. strike?
that’s exactly what I told my dad. they are the robinhood of investing. First mover advantage is everything right now for DKNG. people don’t realize how big the gambling industry can grow if you can make it easily & accessible for the customers. DKNG is the netflix and the others are blockbusters.
Is there a reddit for that?
Yes because WMT always moves that much post ER...
Zuck makes enough profit to propel him to #1, the only reason he hasn't is because he doesn't want to face the scrutiny cause he's a cuck.
Lol
What is dead may never die.
Technically correct
I feel like shorts are going to cover their positions and it’ll hit 500 EOW
Were there more recent rumors about TSLA? I thought the s&p talk died a few weeks/months ago
This is so stupid.

I love it all in on tesla
Kind of slow with nearly 2 million volume right
I haven’t looked yet.. but thank you for reassuring me ❤️
Mmm hmm...Why didn't it move already with earnings released?
Inverse Citron.
Aside from beyond meat's earning miss, I don't think I've see any company not beat earnings expectation. And I've been a pajama trader in my parent's basement for so long, I have not gone out of the house to verify any of the news I've seen all year. Was 2020 and the pandemic drag on the economy real or was it all just fake news to create the March 23 dip?

You short? LUV seems more inflated to me. BA was \~$355 pre corona so the current $199 valuation seems reasonable amongst widespread vaccine optimism.
TSLA an hour in
TSLA ain’t up 20% yet wtf is this? SHORT AT OPEN.

AMZN @3300c 12 Jan 2021??
Calls expire this week? 😂
No
Idk how to feel about it. Seems like most sources believe it’s overvalued, but then we see Catherine Wood and Soros are investing in them. Then they also have 80% of their shares to make public (unless I’m not understanding this correctly). Either it will rise based on hype or will fall to its actual value. I had puts on them for earnings that didn’t end up printing so I’m starting to lose all sense of there being any logic for a companies valuation. That being said, I bought some shares because conceptually, they are futuristic and big names have expressed interest financially. If I had to bet (even though I bought at 15$), I think they’ll probably drop back down to IPO price in the near future then eventually regain and far exceed their current price over the coming years.
bro
Bravo!!
I agree, right now, the joint venture they have seems to be working well so far, but having their own factory would definitely be good. I was just having a look and they’re reaching 97% automation in factory they currently build the cars in. 

EU expansion is a way off agreed and depending on how Tesla price the Model Y in China it could put a serious dent in the works but they’ve been slowly chipping away at Tesla in China and I think it has potential for significant growth. I’d also like to see a competitor to Tesla, all options so far have been either been well above Tesla price (Taycan) or lagging slightly behind in specs compared to Tesla (I-pace, Polestar 2, ID3). If NIO get this 150kWh battery off the ground quick, they’ve got potential to really give Tesla a run
Dividends steal your calls
Inverse yourself & profit
Work smart, not hard. 

I just let you guys do my research, and anyone who suggests something here means I should follow them.
yeah I didn't sub up one year. within 1 week I resubbed.
Dope.
Bro, take a look at earnings of the SPY companies, we are literally at 2014-2015 levels of earnings, but the markets are double what they were back then. Without the fed, SPY would probably be trading at 1500 tops.

They literally cannot stop printing at this stage because reverting back to fundamentals will result in one of the worst crashes in history.
[deleted]
Lol. How new?
CBAT crashing because it has BAT in it.

You can do your own research ya know. Just look up their green plans they have a bunch. They said they'd reduce emissions by 2020 in a 2014 statement by a bunch which they have done and they have a road map into 2040/2050. 

Here's a random quote from their website.

 **“As momentum increases worldwide for the use of hydrogen solutions, we will continue to leverage our industry-leading hydrogen technologies, our deep customer relationships and our extensive service network to enable adoption,” said Linebarger, who serves on the board of the global** [**Hydrogen Council**](https://hydrogencouncil.com/en/)**.** 

Here's another.

 **“Hydrogen technologies, particularly electrolyzers, will be a fast-growing and increasingly important part of our business over the next few years,” said Cummins Chairman and CEO Tom Linebarger at the virtual event, which drew a registered audience of more than 3,000 analysts, media members, environmental advocates and others.** 

Another one.

 **“I am encouraged to see government interest in this space increasing in order to support new and less carbon intensive technology,” Davis said.** 

Another one.

 **Germany, for example, plans to spend $9 billion on hydrogen infrastructure this decade, with 5 Gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity by 2030. China and South Korea are developing fuel cell and hydrogen production targets. In the U.S., California expects to have spent about $230 million on hydrogen projects by the end of 2023.** 

More here:

[https://www.cummins.com/news/2020/11/16/cummins-seizes-day-lead-hydrogen-technology](https://www.cummins.com/news/2020/11/16/cummins-seizes-day-lead-hydrogen-technology)

Anyways. They bought out the Hydrogenics company last year in September and no doubts have been engineering their products together to make something affordable and efficient.
Looking here is much more entertaining.
fucked for the whole year

I accidentally bought puts instead of calls yesterday and I’m going to make money wtf.
How the fuck home deport drop
I suspect buying calls right at open should net profit because of people FOMO-ing into it.
I'm just thinking about Friday. Come Sunday, if there where to be more news about vaccines will the market become jaded towards the news this time around? They've already said the vaccine won't be readily available untill May

Someone please send this to the socialists
Get a load of this 🏳️‍🌈🧸. Stocks only go up. Postionz or ban
Imagine going up 5-7% on no news but getting cucked on earnings but dropping 1.5%. Fed has really done something special. Jerome Powell deserves a giant bronze statue front and center on wall street.
Alright I've got 500 bucks left. What's the play
Nice call
It ‘twas
Figure Tesla options will be good for day trading at open.

Also I am groused with how well NIO is holding up so far. Was expecting the drop this morning
Where was the Tesla advice? Must have missed it. Congrats!
Guess I have to sell fsr at a loss

Gotta step your game up to BRK.A LOL
WMT is going up at least 8%
With the cruise lines there's also governmental pressure in the US to re-institute the no sail. And there are no plans to immediately sail regardless. Lastly, CCL walked those gains last week all the way back, why not again with no catalyst to sailboats moving fatties across the seas for many months to come.
Exactly, do this same type of "analysis" with flu shots, polio vaccine, MMR shots, car airbags, etc and you're going to get similarly tiny numbers to work with because these are rare events. How prevalent is polio today? OP is a fucking idiot and I really hope his pharm job consists of nothing more than handing ppl their pre-bagged rxs out the walgreens drive thru otherwise some ppl are gonna die lol
if you're buying tesla today, wait a bit for it to dip then go back up
TSLA kind of slow in pm.

Averaging down every day. Just averaging down until it's fucking negative. They're going to be paying me to average down. It will drill into the earth and I will be averaging into $-10,000 BABA. The company will fail and become a whirlpool of economic turmoil, crushing entire nations with record sales figures that spark market panic. Exchanges will beg me to stop feeding BABA by averaging down but I'll just laugh and laugh as my hands solidify to adamantium and the universe goes dark.

Good play, but not when other sector is hot.. there’s gonna be pullback for sure if not flat

[deleted]
Will lose a shit ton of customers prob
I think that’s smart, but if they beat earnings in late January that could be another spike, plus it will be less likely to drop now that it’s in the S&P. Funds will need to hold it to track the S&P. I don’t see a good opening to short it. Let me know when you do.
Not when QQQ takes a dump today
I plan to ass fuck some bears today
Lol AirBnb is a stay at home stock
No but I hate my job and could definitely survive a year or two off of what I've got. Maybe get a job I hate less in that time.
Hmmm yes quite interesting, could it perhaps also go...And I know this is a bold statement, but could it go sideways?
Feeling nervous wearing shorts on such a cold day?
Can’t decide if I should ride AMZN or TSLA at open so I’m going both
Consider: has Tesla ever gapped up once? It’s the ultimate FOMO stock. 1 gap up triggers at least another run up. Then u can buy puts.
What was the premium?
So youre saying that to prevent death in the USA, 3 billion people have to get the vaccine when there are only 300 million in the country?  there is a math issue here.
Green by open
Theta gang is best gang
Lol!
Oof
Somebody break my fucking neck for buying CCL calls lmfao
You gotta remember that most people in here are just hoping to shill & pump & dump what they buy. Tesla chatter had practically died. Lol that’s very indicative of $$ moving away. Then all the insta downvotes and luke warm tesla reception? Absolutely people weren’t loaded up haha

Sir this is a casino.... We don't do smart moves - we YOLO shit cuz we want to MIN/MAX tendies in 1 play.... not think things through and have a well rationalized plan - where is the fun in that?
Can’t wait for the surprised pikachus after the secondary offering lmao
Nio will moon too
Can the NIO bulls and bears just meet up and fuck already?! The tension is killing me
Personally, I think $125-150 today and $300 this week.
Bezos just cucked tf out of CVS and Walgreens
Alhamdulillah

::puts stock into shopping cart, flings it into a ravine::
Every losers from NIO train
Both too risky... buy NCLH shares and thank me when the vaccines are distributed
They just became the past
This is the right 4D chess move, I think 11/27 is a bit early but for sure by mid December it will be down to the 185$ range. Travelling won't go back to normal until the vaccine logistics and distribution chain is sorted out. I dumped my BA stocks last week and made some decent cash that I used to buy Palantir.

Idk how i feel about this. If i interpret it, like the true genius i am, i see the following.

Lots of talking. Mostly (all) retards.

Something about EV's and NIO.

People are dying. Their stomachs hurt.

Conclusion is that NIO is a shitty yolo, but if you already have diarrhea, you're good.
You didn't mind me asking what happened to your pants when I walked in on you jerking to loss porn.

1.6% pre market?

Fuck u
If it works for you it works. Godspeed
NIO + PLTR
Haha. Nope!  It will inflate even more after ER!
Pp hard rn
This is my research!! +75k YTD, if it’s stupid but it works.. is not stupid
today is a very crucial day for QQQ

if it breaks the ATH resistance trendline then we can see 298-302 soon

if it breaks the low-level support then there is downside all the way to 270

these two trendlines intersect later today so this move could determine where we go for the near future
What happened to kindness?
It’s not AMASON fucktard

>Big companies issue capital raises before s&p500 inclusion. Tesla will likely issue the largest in history.

They usually do it before the S&P index committee announcement though.

And Tesla did it already two months ago, a $5b ATM secondary offering, already closed.

Also, Tesla would have to issue a $50b equity round to absorb this demand. If they do that the stock price will catapult some more lol.
Will see in 6 months. Either I’m rich or broke as hell

I just need like 52 EOD so I can sell my risky crap
What are you guys buying on market open? AMZN?
Staying underweight TSLA will be an active portfolio decision that the asset manager will be responsible for. By doing that they are shorting Tesla against the benchmark equal-weight allocation.

The "safe default" will be to buy 1.1% TSLA, especially if you don't really understand Tesla, which most money managers don't.
Nah in their own threadS, which is the right move

Most non-triumphant.  (For now.)
Is anyone familiar with the stock WATT (energous)? Years ago they were rumored to have a truly wireless energy charging tech and since faded into oblivion. Stock is currently $2 per share. Seems like it’d be ripe for a wsb type run for some reason.
Pumping penny stock? Hmm yes me like
It lost a lot when it was decided to be left out last time but that was also September. I think tesla looks for any news to rally.

Yeah algos overreacting to CVS, they are more than just a drugstore too
TTNP going all in could probably move the market with its volume - moon this shit
Ccl starting to fall let’s goooo
So you’ll be going short and posting your positions then right?
they don't have to sell it, they have amazoncare and 23&me
Damn how big will amzn be allowed to get?
Nice, same here
Domestic beer has been around for a while
Amazon just announced amazon pharmacy
So wmt iv crush or am I good? I’m a noob
thanks that means a lot to me
Am I crazy for buying 500 shares of DRIP?
Do what u love 🤑
So MARA the buy here with that coin breaking 17k?
I think there will be a sell off before close. Then its 50/50 if it goes up or down AH/tomorrow. Gonna probably keep shares, sell half of my calls.
imagine preparing for anything work related
Hope you sold
None is official yer
I agree, CVS is more than just a drugstore...RAD and WBA make more sense
Ask your broker.
Amazon pharmacy
Watch the last call. Unique product, thicc pipeline of customers in a variety of industries, insane retention

The only problem is they have like 100 trillion fucking shares outstanding lol
Yep. But you can Google it luckily
More a long term play.... 

Pos : jan21 2022  20c x 10

Edit : if it does 't reach 50 by expiry it means it will have tanked. Otherwise....I'm good
They over tax and over regulate it so most people still buy illegally
Hold.
Of all the memes I've seen here, this one is certainly... the most recent.

Edit: Only WSB..crazy award, /u/fireduck may the Tendies rain upon thee
The healthcare industry jumped a lot these past two weeks. CVS, Walgreens, Cardinal Health, etc. Take a look at their 1D charts through November. The kind of movement of the whole industry is absurd. Great call with the puts!
Once puts are available, yea.
Yeah this feels like too big of a sell off.

Amazon can't distribute vaccines (yet) so the implied foot traffic pump will still be there.

I also wonder if people generally prefer working with a real person when getting their prescriptions.

I'll see what sort of price action we see at open and decide whether today or tomorrow. This dump will shatter all the volatility/momentum the stock had so calls for Jan/Feb should be dirt cheap tomorrow if it sells off and trades flat all day.
Yes you did
Did all the TSLA boys falls asleep?
What strikes are you thinking
Retail favorites kinda is meaningless.

If you take out the loosers, only look at winners and call them favorites.. Then look at their overall performance, and not only after they became hype stocks..

Then it's a dofferent picture.
That’s what my calls hope
I feel the same way...the market looks like inflated beyond any underlying support
For some places in Europe, you are considered resident wherever you live in over 180 days per year. Some people choose places like Monaco or Gibraltar to "live" and pay whatever applies. I would say the UK will tax pretty much any kind of income > £13k surpassing the free allowance or somethin'.

States want money, either coming from respectable jobs or chicken race betting.

Answer me this. Have you seen him this past week? 🙊👀
to da moooooon (shitcoin)
Yeah, and not just "bought", but "**bought & held & (almost) never sold**".

Hugely anti-dilutive event, with a potentially permanent effect on TSLA price levels: the weakest longs get bought out and the shares get locked up.
Will tesla have a pullback before shooting like hell?
Username checks out
Hold or sell NIO before earnings?
Old news
Ppl just minding their business with "safe" pharmarcy stocks during a fucking pandemic and Bezos comes off the top rope. GUH
Goddamnit
PERMABAN
NIO ER today right boys?
Then... Playing CVS for the bounce today!
For sure and likely through the holiday shopping period.

What time we buying Tesla
I could be preparing for work meetings but here I am. Perhaps this is a sign.
Yeah the writing was on the wall for RAD, WBA, etc for some time
they seem to be on par with what Tesla promises. Both are with a time-horizon of 2025.
Sounds like 180

It’s our day buddy
Who's buying TSLA calls today?
CFD?
Nio seems to be all in in R&D, and just outsourcing manufacturing. If / when they have enough capital to have their own factory and do it all in house, combining all the knowledge gained in motorsports with hopefully efficient manufacturing, it's gonna be great. 

As for the EU expansion, that's still a long way ahead, and it has lots of uncertainties. I hope they succed and manage to bring the fight to Tesla, but it still is a big if.
Hell, I hope anybody can bring the fight to Tesla, a bit of competition never hurt anybody
I just realized if they legalize weed I won't be breaking the law at all anymore and that makes me a huge pussy.
600c 11/20
Ah bon d’où
900 IQ play today is obviously NKLA cALLS
We honestly don't know rn.

I'm getting worried for my theta. I just need it to go 10$ up
NIO moon til 3 then sell off.
FFS I just sold at a slight loss because of lockdown 2 electric boogaloo
Can’t waste the gains
No it hasn’t. Your just making up shit lol
I would like to speak to the manager please right now!
you are gonna lose money forever
You man live off covered calls
They are not doing Schedule II drugs
TDOC hit bottom, 200c 11/24 better print big tendies
TSLA.
VTRS is a thing, I guess.
PLTR aggregates and analyzes spook data for operational purposes. Why not hop on the crowdstrike train if you’re worried about an expanding cyber war?
That was some solid info there! I had assumed that efficacy was calculated that way, but curious now as to what I'm missing.
And don't fight a cult stock

Position jan21 2022 20c × 10
> gonna lose so much sleep over this.

profit is profit, you didnt lose money
1. It's within the standard stupid deviation of most posts here.

2. Bagholder? Have you ever seen a TSLa or PLTR chart?

3. Only bags here are turning these 10x baggers into 100x white buffalos
haha i'm always supportive of autists making money
Idk if just a giant Troll or one of the biggest douches ever
My 11/20 415c I bought yesterday gonna print! 🤑🤑🤑
Heard that it's about SEC thing
Yes
Fuck chyna
I mean isn't this the exact reason they bought pill pack? Their next move will be to challenge health insurers
illumunati
Fam literally while watching this I started to ignore the captions and thoughtFuck I need to watch lord of the rings soon”
I am kill
Try Calendar Spreads.
so TSLA 11/20 200p , gotcha
🤡

I would've lost my shit if it said dhallywood
Usually if you have a bigger margin, like $150,000, your interest rate will be less, so it is a big money savings to go deeper.
Does this mean I can use fake scripts for vicos?
Pump and dump.
xom i heard
When is it?
trump tweeted the top again lmao
Dutch actually :D
Go ahead, buy one of them...lots if you can...
CVS jumps 30% in two weeks and you guys didn't buy puts??? My 12/18 70p about to print
Baba still frozen in time 🤡

Awesome. Do it

Such a great movie.
So fucking 👄
I wish I would’ve known that leaps was the move and not weeklies 
Also I was a pussy starting off only playing with like 300$ at a time lol
After the stock split?
BAN
# 😨
Correction is coming soon. In the next few days you 🌈🐻 with that said, market is now dictated by option flows/gamma exposure, Lagos front running and trying to digest liquidity.  News is just used to explain the movements.
Thats what I say, hold some weeklies for the thrill, but NIO is for the long haul...buy leaps and shares and sit back and watch your capital grow
If we’re fucking up your market, then you’re not good at it in the first place. Go somewhere else old man
Die boeing die, you're up 40% this week on a news pump, now give up 5-8 today/tomorrow

I have theoretical knowledge on IV. But in this particular scenario how would it impact? Can you eli5? In fact this is my first trigger. Thank you.
yeah most of us don't have a t word pass
Hahahah tsla call holder got me. I bought 415 calls yesterday 🤣
But the real question is TSLA potato?
Ahh yes. After being stressed out weeks on my baggy amzn calls I’m finally rewarded by breaking even. Not worth
Drill Team 6 let’s activate these CBs
Wtf is happening with RAD and WBA?
I'm seeing a distinct lack of dicks in this autistic finger painting.

You won't. No balls..

Marketing expansion due to new valid markets will do that to you.
Whats the yolo move for tsla?
What the heck is up with BABA stock? Did they throw Jack in prison or something? lol
CVS overreaction. Going back to highs. Cvs a healthcare store now CALLS/SHARES
Can’t be wrong if you call the top every single day
Where do you register?
All the wage deprived workers will be busting-in and re-taping for the good shit...

Do I launch a weekly at AMZN or TSLA

Vol and OI mean very little. Remember back in April? SPY 4/17 200P had ridiculous vol/oi and we all know what happened to those positions.
I read the book 1984 in 8th grade
On the low end smh
Muted. Jared from subway was the last person of significance with AIDS
Sell calls, keep shares.
Look at what happened in the snow ipo. And with a vaccine coming more travel more Airbnb!
Lets face it Amazon getting into Rx was just a matter of time, just needed to work on the logistics with the drug makers and insurance companies

You already know some analyst is doing coke ready to buy 8 figures worth of Tesla shares today for his fund
Walgreens puts it is
“West Chicago” is an actual city, seperate from Chicago, located in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, and it’s a very wealthy neighborhood.
No!  I think AMZN will be huge but TSLA will have bigger % gains this week.
Wsb says so
A lot of people took his TA for law and just yolo’d themselves into spy 200p 4/17 but he didn’t put a gun to our head. He always explained that at a certain point (which he did) that he was gonna switch to calls.
That was a fucking google glitch. It bottomed at 13. The autists ove at google have fixed it now.
Don’t forget the boring company lol
Yes, buy calls that expire on Wednesday. Where do these idiots come from?
hype train seems to have gotten enough traction to start climbing. im thinking 16.50 by close easy, possibly up to 17. its sitting at 16.33 as it is right now, which is a huge jump overnight.

Whether NIO beats estimates or doesn't, think long term. We've gone from the microwave generation to the point-and-click generation. Everything is now now now. Be patient. I would rather own a company that is methodical and not a flash in the pan company that burns itself out. Slow and steady wins the race.
stocks go up
EV bubble is now beyond retarded. XPENG with a fucking 32 billion dollar valuation lmao.
Just like gasoline...
F
Agreed, same with the regulation prohibiting non accredited investors from investing in most public companies, would have been nice to get those PLTR earlier / space X shares already.
They announced they’re doing pharmacy. ;-)
Well if Tesla is in the sp500 doesn’t that mean all those 401k/retirement investment agencies will start investing in Tesla?
JKS gonna pop 10% on earnings in a few min
Clear troll, notice the heavy use of the thesaurus
Overstock needs to jump in and go up-
🤡
What’s the bullish case for PLTR?
Dump tsla and buy amzn at open?
Calling the top eh
Let’s get you down for a nap.

Maybe some employees checked their robin hood account while the intern was posting the news
Inspirational and extremely frightening at the same time.  Definitely a legend.  Might be the best thing I’ve seen here.
Ban this ultra douche. Fuck you asshole.
Things TSLA isn’t going to do:

1. Bleed for weeks
They are hemorrhaging a shocking amount of money for a software company
User name checks out
You son of a bitch I'm in. I've been out of the loop

The future is now, old man
Too late to buy even more pltr?
Queen 10/10 would bang
that's legit flat for NIO. it goes up or down 20%. this aint flying.
Fking autists are going to jump in TSLA at open
and watch it slowly bleed red for weeks. You never learn.
good my old ones need to start printing.
You said it yourself fam
When I type pray, the hands pop up...besides if it was a high five, then why wouldn't they have different color hands as an option like a black hand giving a high five to a white hand?
Wrong.
The earnings report will be after market close. Probably will see them tomorrow.

i don't remember billionaire investors investing in memes
Been there for a bit but had to enable it
Oh you got no idea what that bitch is capable of
I see up 2% on a down day
Is NIO earnings before or after?

Don’t you understand that money is everything and you young fucks don’t deserve any of it? You come from nothing and therefore should remain nothing. You don’t have a lineage to stand on. You were not born into true wealth that was built from several generations and passed down through time. You are peasants that barely scraped by and now want to play with old money. You fucks are all nouveau riche at best and uncouth vermin at worst. Go find a new game to play and stop mucking up my market.

People in this sub do just that everyday.
If you don’t hold NIO calls through ER, you ain’t black
Anytime in the next 2 weeks.
Thanks for the update, didn’t actually know they left as a manufacturer but saw that they still hold the NIO team name for the 2020/21 season
No
Sooooo much is "value added". I didn't read the announcement, but if they are able to offer compounded prescriptions, the only thing holding them back across rural and suburban america will be same day delivery for meds.
Imagine looking at a market thats been getting inflated for months and N O T MAKING FUCKING MONEY🤣🤣. -.6 red premarket and people jerk off to the Big Short all morning.
Now if baba could just start selling COVID vaccines I’d be set!

Absolutely
This is hilarious for some reason
So... will Robinhood restrict me from doing that?
Wippity yay
Currently strangling SPY this week:  $362 calls / $355 puts and I'm sure both will print.  Clown-ass market...
Was testing a theory and if I can exit my position this morning it worked!
No Russian
After the mango dump, yes. Way too risky right now.
This is pre-market bruh.  Patience.
Omg these were a great buy you're going to make soooo much off them!!!!

At least they're saved now.

See you \*today\* (or whenever your already processed transferred funds settle).
My really dark theory on TSLA> When the SPY goes back to 250...which it has to  do. And Nanna and Popop lose their life savings....EVERYONCE  CAN BLAME TESLA, bc, after all, it was the most heavily shorted stock etc etc. A magnificently Machiavellian plan btw

Oh damn sorry
Lol bro you mad?
I hear talks constantly constantly constantly about LKCNY. But I’ve never heard anyone bringing up Wirecard. That’s your answer right there.

There’s no better feeling than watching your money disappear when there’s zero you can do about it
Yea you’re not wrong, Formula 1 is essentially a bunch of millionaires and millionaire kids driving around for billionaires. I think Formula E is slightly different, obviously still heavily dependent on sponsors, but there’s a whole lot less money flowing around there. It’s still yet to really take off, but the fact NIO has been able to run a team since Formula E’s inception was more my point in this context, and that too in the EV side of things. It’s probably the most likely Chinese EV to break out of the Chinese market into EU.

If shit goes awry, you know which retard comment to come back to and make fun of: mine.
Hope you guys have enjoyed BTFD’ing all year. Glad you made some money. But it’s wave 2 corona heading into the end of the year. People are going to need to move money around, take profits, retire, etc and they’re just itching to sell at ATH. Plus the secondary bond market is about to dump everything they’ve got to get cash so they can stock up on fresh US treasuries that were auctioned last week. Consider today February 20-ish
Costco has a history of dropping on earnings, good or bad. So if both are on the same date I would expect a big drop
Is that considered day trading?
Holy shit boys, I just looked at the value of my employer DCPP and just got erect. This thing grows faster than my personal TFSA.

sooo, how many TSLA 500c 11/20 should I buy
it dropped ;(

I have a calendar spread, bought 190c 1/2021, sold 200c 11/20
Yeah no bueno.
I’m not crushing it yet...  I’m down as of now but hope that turns around quickly....  AMZN $3320 12/04 calls.   1 share of AMZN bought at $3333.  TSLA $440 12/04 calls.  173 shares of TSLA bought at $109.  300 shares of NIO bought at $39.
Wait Drill team 6 coming out of drill school fresh and ready?
Not to mention that this type of reduction in R (rate of spread; or rather 'pass-on-rate') would be great. Not to mention that the real use would be reduction of spread in a non lock down environment, and not in a lock down environment.

&#x200B;

Which is why the use RRR and not the absolute reduction percentage. If the relative reduction is 90%, then it is a good bet, that this reduction would transfer reasonably well (even if the percentage reduction was significantly reduced) into a non lock down environment, ie. higher viral load environment.

Not Barbados, they opened a luxury hospital just for Covid and have been banking it on the 1 year work visas if you're rich. They don't allow you ashore or through the airport unless you get a negative test. If positive they take you straight to the hospital for a nice 2 week stay. Cruise ships and airlines won't let you leave if you are positive.

what's the play for today? TSLA is out...i already missed that boat...need new ideas

Thank you
Should've trusted my gut:

About twenty years ago, I was walking around an Eckerd examining their merchandise thinking "very strong company, good future."

Then Rite Aid bought them, and I got this sharp shooting pain, like a sense of dread, knowing in about twenty years, Amazon would gadoosh them one day, and my Rite Aid shares that I bought the day before the gadoosh would quickly lose value.
I'm expecting spicy good NIO memes and gain/loss porn after today
Sounds like you'll be walking alone so you should be good

I had PLUG leaps for $10 for Jan 2021. Wish I still had those
I paid $4450 for the shares and collected $415 for the 45.5c. I'm not super optimistic about NIO so I'm not selling way OTM, like 1 or 2 strikes up.  9.3% of the underlying is an INSANE premium  

EDIT: I don't trust the current valuation so I'm actually trying to get assigned and get out.

Honestly, the fact that you're asking someone else this question tells me all I need to know. Take that money and throw it in an index fund and enjoy your 8-10% average. 

You need to forget about the possible profits you can make with your 350k and think more about the risk and possible loss instead. 

The 100k that I often trade with is under 5% of my portfolio. Whenever I trade with it, I consider the whole 100k a loss until I'm out of the trade(even though that's extremely difficult to do, since for the most part, you can wait it out or if it's a Nokia type situation, you can cut your losses before you lose the full amount. I typically hold since my risk is reasonably low, which also means it won't mentally wreck me seeing red days.)


If this doesn't deter you. I severely advise that you don't use more than 5% of your capital. Which is more than enough to make money if you know what you're doing. If 17.5k isnt sexy enough for you. Use 10%, which is around 35k. Although I recommend sticking with the 5% route. 80% of my portfolio is in varying ETFs, so, I still recommend that ,whatever you do, put 80-90% of that cash away into long-term ETFs.


..alternatively, bet it all in a January NIO call and clench your butthole in anticipation?
Most of them want to get their old as shit parents deathly ill, then bingo, inheritance.  Because they haven't done shit with their lives or made their world a better place...

The first one is (almost always) free.
Generally, I’d agree thanks to these bursts of lock-downs.  Especially for China right now.  With the tariffs and pushes Trump has done with them, many companies are going elsewhere for manufacturing.
NIO have run a Formula E team since 2014 and offices in Oxford UK. I’d say they’re pretty legit
Lmao zerohedge gtfo

We've all known this for quite some time. The market doesnt give a shit
LK was obvious scam, I've actually seen NIOs products
That’s the opposite of what everyone else on here is saying, so.... your probably right!
I mean. Did they know it would jump once it was set to join the sp500
Do they offer fractional shares? I can't get a straight answer with them
To pessimistic I say 150

Ok CCL, enough foreplay, time for you to go down.

Yeah I got burnt on PFE calls once already, $40C got news of operation warp speed or some shit then never got above$39. Fuck PFE
We always have ample masks at the door and require one upon entry, that’s why the post which is pretty close to top for the month is a lie,  if they take it off sadly there’s not much we can do cause it’s not like you can grab their face and put their mask back on. 

But we’re also one of the biggest Sam’s clubs in the nation, if not the biggest, and we’re in a very conservative state. In the last month we’ve filmed multiple national commercials in our club after close, and are less than 5 miles away from Walmart global HQ. If I’m seeing less than 5% refusing a mask, no where in the country is seeing greater than 50%

When 1 high priced share becomes multiple lower priced shares (to same value of the 1 high priced share). Tesla split it's shares 5:1.
Yea close to that
and they say wsb is infested with "hate speech". you cucks make me proud.
What, happened to Pfizer
😂😂👍
$3.50.
Lmfao same here, buddy. Sold my weeklies at breakeven last week. Wasn't worth risking the theta decay.
I stand by my guesses. You can easily look up any of the figures I gave and you’d find they are accurate. No need for a source on widely available public information. Anyone disagreeing with my statements is disagreeing with fact. Next to nobody retires with 5 mil in the bank.
It happens often when a stock price becomes high. While there are financial reasons. A lot of it is due to trading volume and investors buying 10 shares at $10 is easier on the eyes the 1 share at $100

Puts on this were smart in beginning of year. The economy will open again. Calls is the way to go now
So TSLA $500 weeklies is at .16 eod Monday.. my guess it would be around 10 today?
I really hope so. I’m dying to get into leaps.
Oh kk thanks..but y do they do it? Like to increase the no of shares or..? does most companies do this? (Am a beginner & trade in nse,bse stocks)
I bet it would be over $1000 by then
What am I supposed to do w/ my spin off Pfizer call?
Lmao I’m a retard and read top as opening. Yeah so that’s exactly what you’re doing
 DO IT

November 17, 2020 06:22 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- News     

Loop Capital initiates coverage on DraftKings (NASDAQ:[DKNG](http://www.benzinga.com/stock/DKNG#NASDAQ))        with a Buy rating and announces Price Target of $100.
It's barely down. SE is +- 5% every single day, this is nothing.
Feet up
Amzn fd’s it is
Duh
amzn
I can't believe you're allowed access to the internet, let alone trading.  I sincerely hope you're not a licensed pharmacist, but if you are and you're allowed anywhere near these vaccines then you might end up being right.  Those death and case prevention numbers you're so confidently asserting are based on the assumption that everything will scale linearly here, which is so so far from the truth.
Not hate. Honesty. I call spades spades.
not really, only if short sellers step up but think they'll give up
[deleted]
Also about INO, there is quite a number of short sellers, and serious banks on the other side. I am in long with leaps and 800 shares. After some DD I am overall impressed with possible future and we might see a real short squeeze here. Blackrock got these at 19$, you can get at 12$. 25$ by EoY. DoD financing of COVID vaccine trial amount disclosure I think will be Wednesday, and Friday another update on their non invasive brain cancer treatment. Very bullish.
the top isn’t coming for another 6 months at least

It’s a melt up.  Wait for the bears to start buying calls XD
Yup its rough lol
A big subscriber number could make it jump but that’s the only chance really
tell Michael i said hi
I‘ts already continuing to go up pre market, so you might want to wait and see how high it goes before opening
The dog is Russian
i'd be a millionaire, let's fucking go
Nasdaq gonna be green with AMZ and Tesla
What's it mean when the only time i feel anything is when my portfolio moves??
Why so much hate bro?
For some reason I’m being downvoted for this. If anyone doubts my claims, I can personally objectively prove them for them if they would like
its probably having a sustained rally this time to 380-400+
Not gonna happen. We’re in the FOMO zone
SE tanking in the pre
Ahh the good old days
Calls on cans. This is all the DD I needed
Who's holding Nio through earnings?  I've got 1/15/21 calls, leaps, shares.
i am erect
That’s larger than most autists on this subs portfolios 😂 yeah, keep pumping your positions and calling it memes
Yea, TSLA up 14% already. AMZN pharmacy news seems better
After close
Sorry bud, ain’t happening
2 week otm puts for each, esp. RKT/AMD, in case they tank, itll save your ass
My td news ticker dropped the news at 7:05 am
I’m guessing 90% of these were sold to hairy-legged men with saggy butt cheeks.
No? Why the fuck would you buy puts on TSLA?
Positions or ban
NIO bagholders when it gained over 2% yesterday and is over 3% PM. Smells like a TSLA bagholder who got his 10 bagger to go from -99% to -90%.
Is the vaccine safe? Who knows. But the FDA will fast track it because we haven’t updated our vaccine laws since the Cold War.
Had same thoughts...
NOW
Tesla holders better sell before it goes right back to dump.
This is the way
🍆 💦
Just pick a team and go all in.

Hey guys it’s pokimane here should I buy back in again?

Thank you, Mr Luv2fukmarriedmilfs. You’re an inspiration.
Memes aside, the hobbit movies were so trash
I have 500 shares, that’s not really ball deep.

Doesn’t it seem like time for SPY puts? It’s been on a crazy run the past 2 weeks
That man is a legend
Lol no
Jealous retard
Ofc.
There's gonna be a lot of new price targets for TSLA but not until the big boys get their shares bought up
lol, I’m not doxxing myself. I have no reason to lie about this. Not exactly privileged information I don’t think, as I’m sure you’ll start hearing all the major pharmacies start saying things like this soon.
For WMT that pretty much is a surge.

MOTHER OF GOD
Should I buy calls exp Friday that week? It sounds like free money.
Damn, u better buy puts then hope for the best. Good luck comrade

They're launching some online pharmacy thingy
For example?
Online pharmacy opens today
Top retard yes
So far this month the market has been gap up on Monday,

Red on Tuesday,  gain whatever it loss Tues,  red Thursday,

Will you buy mangocoin if it were to exist??
Who holding Nio through earnings? Ive got 1/15/21 calls, leaps, shares.
[removed]
I have some emotional attachment to RKT, breakups are hard, I don’t want to leave it, but it’s hurt me in the past.
Maybe like 8500
Is there any reason that TSLA wouldn’t just keep climbing until 12/21 if we know that S&P funds will be buying $50B to match the index?
That should start happening from dec 21st right, seeing as that's the inclusion effective date?
So you're saying buy the dip?
Both..But TSLA would be spicy 🔥 I believe.
Errrrrthang bullish
ban ur mom
What happened.... Why is Amazon doing so good?
When are we some vaccine news goddammit!?
Position?
Cathie bae
Thanks
Cardinal health supply’s freezers for vaccines that we store in hospitals.🤷🏼‍♂️
Hmmm. Ok. Stick went up to 2500 and split into 5. So if you had 1 share at $2500 you know had 5 shares at $500. Stocks do this often. Apple also did it around the same time.
Bynd$
bear cave
this is true. Im all in. Waiting for the stock to 10x
Amazon imo
building bunk beds for more activities
tell that to my 30k worth of ups losses ;-;
That place is a hell hole. Feel bad for people with anxiety that browse there for legit news coz half them seem to want the world to burn. At least when we want the world to burn it's so our calls go ITM
It will go bad. People will go to Tesla. Too much dumb money not in Tesla.

Burry bought a bunch of cvs options, I wonder if they were calls or puts?
it has been pretty volatile in the same sideways channel since june tho
No confirmed rc stake yet, though runor is that he bought tons yesterday and sold the deep itm put blocks worth 10% of the company. He sent a letter to the board yesterday basically saying adjust the company's path or else. Also said he's not interested in just one board seat. They did an initial response saying they offered him a oard seat repeatedly and were turned down. Lot more than that but im typing on my phone

Pretty excited to just read all the cucks here who will have to dump Nio or all their money tomorrow.

Be prepared. Their financials will be ‘okay’ but nowhere near good enough to offset this recent SP increase. 10-20% dump next 2 weeks.
TIL 1.9% is a surge

It’s up nearly 4% AH tho

Good morning everyone.  I was told there would be gap up on my calls overnight.  Why no gap up???

There will be a knee jerk reaction at the open. I will keep it till it stabilizes and then sell.
Appreciate your response. Have a couple of questions. 

>This is not a tough virus to solve. It's an easy spike protein. I've worked in commercial genetic engineering labs with nearly enough to put together a vaccine of this complexity. HIV is tough to solve since it hides in the immune system cells away from targeting; this virus is not.

Wait, do they know that this isn't the case with covid? Its been should to affect brain, liver, kidneys, testicles, blood. The virus seems to be doing more than ARDS, how is it possible now to say that this virus will "easy to solve"?

How can they possibly have a vaccine in "everyone's hand" by March 2021? They won't even have enough doses for the whole population of the US by then. That's why preliminary plans have said health care workers first. Think that seems very optimistic.

Also, you sure about the R0 for covid? 2 is at the low end of averages and it varies by factors that affect spread, its not just a single score for the whole pandemic.
Did you people know this would happen?
Online gang is one thing. But check out who own these shares and at which price they got them. This is really promising and news are right around the corner.
The debt misconception is a common one. They actually aren’t loaded down with much debt at all. Certainly less than Nio in terms of the companies debt-asset ratios. The vast majority of GMs debt comes from GM financial. What many don’t realize is GM actually profits off this debt. GM borrows money and shows it as debt, then they loan that money out to customers and dealers at a higher interest rate for a profit. This shows as both a debt AND an asset in GMs finances. GM has come a LONG way since it’s former bankruptcy.
Institutional investors start rebalancing in early December.
NIO #1 by Units, Sales, Revenue, Market Cap. 

Xpeng = #2
exactly, if theres any chinese company that wouldnt mind complying with this its BABA

theyre as legit as it gets

but market is probably scared that CCP will get mad
So many NIO bagholders, lol

Smells like a boy's locker room with all the frustration and angst in here
And down 2%.  Lol.  Fucking stupid.
:o whats stock split brother? Like i often check the price and dont go deep.. I don't track foreign stocks
Never listen to Cramer. Inverse Cramer.
Yolod my last $1000 on a single TSLA 11/27 420 call. Guesses on what it opens at???
r/coronavirus is a fuckin doomer circle jerk. There’s people claiming it there that they’ve gone to Walmart and not only seem less than half of people there wearing masks, but employees not wearing them either. 

I work for Sam’s and can’t even pull down my mask to take a drink of water, and while I have seen an increase of people refusing to wear masks, it’s still way less than 5%. I’m not saying our customers have similar numbers to Walmart or anything, but I can guarantee employers are forced to wear masks lmao.

Tdlr: doomer subscribers of r/coronavirus like bad news, and when we have good news, they make up lies cause they don’t want things to get better
Sounds like you bought calls near the top during the earnings run-up
So it is!

retracement/pullback/consolidation of yesterdays move; bullish

&#x200B;

well see some $$ flow after the retail numbers in an hour.
That’s usually what happens when there’s an influx of orders at open.
Yeesh, what’s this CVAC cliff? Was happy with that rally

I'll dump all 10 shares of brk.b in my portfolio. That'll show him.
so if XOM is getting replaced by TSLA in SPY, how many points will SPY moon when they switch places?
why stop at 300t? we can price it in for 3060, 900trillion ....I think this catalyst justifies a valuation of $3000
Take a look at this tards comment history. His happiness is built on using 50 cent words in his boomer karen rants. Slow down on trying to sound smart..we all know you should...

Get back in the drive through window bisssh.
Yeah like your positions won’t show you balls deep in PLTR LOL
Whatever
14% in AH right now. Unclear which direction it moves, but I wouldn't be stunned if it went up. 465 was the 4 week high and it is sitting on that atm.
Kek.
Stock splits incoming I feel like who’s gonna do it tho amzn?? Googl?
Yup!
Amazon 3300 EOW??
Why not have positions in both companies
Hehe! I got shares.

Now for the split announcement...
Mind as well suck a cock and make a man cum to redeem yourself
Y
I believe the announcement of prescription drug sales with two day delivery for prime members is responsible for this surge.
 Definitely was bro congrats
I don’t really need a 30% parabolic gap up by NIO at open I just need it to be around 46-48 range and gradually gap up throughout the day EOD at 60+ like yesterday, people are more likely to take small profit along the way but the stock would run, if we have a huge uptrend at open people going to panic and sell their shit and we could end up like last Friday for those who holding calls at 45+.
NIO is now AI chipmaker... Fully Autonomous EVs deployed. 

NIO $100+ EOW.
Be PREPARED for some trading systems to go “down” at open.
Sell that shit at open bro
I have a crazy concept bulls, don’t sell your shares.
When did you open this trade?
Hope. There's always hope.
Weird, I like a lot of the actors in this scene and I literally never heard of this movie once.
Got a source for buyout rumor and more RC stake? I’m always happy for more confirmation bias but WSB tends to throw around a lot of hearsay.
Contemplating shares or a strangle.
The numbers imply 90+% effectiveness for both moderna and pfizer. 

Idk what OP is smoking.
I'm getting more calls at open
AMZN or TSLA call?
Just want to have fun making maymay bro :(
If we open at 13 or 14 its gonna be ugly. Possible it takes longer though with red futures
Yo boys I just got back from Miami, going to get tested for coronavirus right now. Wish me luck on testing negative and my SPCE puts printing
Try MSOS, Also this marijuana etf has Trulieve and Curaleaf as the Top holdings, CURLF also reports today
Ever since etsy somehow got added I'm expecting shit like beetcoin be added to s&p
Yeah I might just tel her to come knock or something.. bins are open air no top
Rite Aid tanked because Amazon is doing online pharmacy.

Why the fuck did I buy 1000 RAD shares yesterday at the top you ask?

Well let me tell you

What is this from?
[deleted]
Hold RKT for the long run, it’s the one stock I’ve had in my portfolio for the past month that’s consistently been very good to me and I think it has a chance of skyrocketing any day
Too many Autists in this sub balls deep on Chinese EVs hoping to ride Tesla’s coattails not realizing that won’t happen today. Earnings will bring Nio and other Chinese EVs back to earth even though they’ll be great & Tesla will rocket up and continue to on FOMO. Calling it. Too much dumb money on this sub in those stocks. Seeing people downvote anything Tesla (pissed) they’re not in... which means dumb money is missing the Tesla boat and Chinese EVs are about to sink.
Drop rocket, man. The banking industry is in a perpetual decline. Replace it with something fin tech related like PayPal or square, probably square. Thank me later
Yeah that’s what I’m gonna start doing .. just gonna tell the old lady to come knock starting next week
2100
That might screw over my calls that I sold.... oops
[deleted]
Exactly and are going to report great earnings
Lol
Its still massive leverage over the stock. To put it in perspective, my dis 140 calls in Jan 2021 went from 230 per call to 1100 when it popped to 140. Holding equivalent value shares would have made me 30 bucks instead of 770.

Ccl leaps jan 2022, 35c doubled on a 4 dollar move at the same time.

3-6 months out is ideal imo. But also, definitely don't start options with short dated....there is a reason wsb constantly posts massive losses
Pharmacys
Huh, it was down 0.57% when I posted this. And for the first few hours of PM
Get your eyes check or stop with the crack. That stock goes sideways and down than up lil bit.
NIO #2! 

Xpeng #1!!!
Pharma business announced
I’m calling it, due to Tesla joining s&p everything is gonna be slow asf at open and lots of people are gonna miss out due to *Were experiencing high traffic*
So Tesla would have billions added onto their balance sheet after everything is all said and done?
Didnt sleep all night, just went for a run in freezing weather, puts on me
If you hate money, sure
Announced pharmacy, tanking Walgreen and cvs
Announced amazon pharmacy

Edit : discounts available for some 🐻🌈😉
NIO is #1 in China. #2 in the World.
Why is amazon pumping ?
From last night until EOD that would be like 25%. 

Are you high?
For real, they dont stand a chance
Time for Amazon Prime Prescriptions
EO Decades
What did they change to make them worth more?
True.
Idk i wanna fomo otm at opens.. higher chances
Not sideways, steady climb. They are killing it on all fronts, the stock float is just too big to make any major movements.
Q: new price target for TSLA?
Nope. Terrible instincts.
imagine being this delusional
Poor girl lost her tendies and her tiddies
Maybe NIO earnings go bad and everyone moves to XPENG. Chinese Elon 2.0
I got burned on HYLN as well. Not as bad though. I sold and took the loss to reduce my capital gains taxes and put the money to work elsewhere.
wtf was this announced? Did they just split without saying anything?
How low you think it’s going to drop?
Girl you know it's Girl you know it's Girl you know it's
Apologies.
How the fuck do you lose money on a stock that only goes up?
add some hedges
So what you’re saying is that there **is** a way?

Long BEAR.
Find a way to put a lock on it only give her the combo
Yeah now they just announced they are opening their own pharma business so doctors can send prescriptions through amazon now. 2 day delivery and discounts for prime members. RIP cvs and Walgreens/rite aide
I love the smell of unrealized loss in the morning
You think its gonna be like this every year? Lol
Took my cvs gains away too. Love to see it.
There’s a lot more then that coming out today buddy buckle up
Suck it boomer. Suck it hard and suck it long
Dont let either one of them have the cans. Sell them to them for one cent each
I understand you can make your own decision, but please do not base it off of this post: his entire thesis is false. There is nothing I hate more than people intentionally misleading others with scientific data.
Because almost all vira are. 

Reinfections arn't unheard of, but generally not common enough to matter. No need to panic just because some low percentage don't develop rebust, longlasting immunity.
That was the play yesterday.
Nope. Only Tesla will
Any catalysts left for MSFT or is it sideways to EOT?
I have a feeling tesla will dump at open then rocket all the way to 500 by eod. Buy the dip sell the rip
EPS missed
Anything more than 0DTE is leaps.. 2021 options are stocks
Retarded. So now that it’s on the S&P, people are going to suddenly “discover” TSLA like they’ve never heard of it before? No.
Have you ever played Tesla? The swings are violent as fuck during news like this.
That's great of you, polio is a huge problem these days.  And nice fake trade.  There weren't 900 contracts traded after it hit .15 yesterday.

Come on WMT give me that sweet sweet sugar
Reeeeeeeee!!!

Edit: (Op)
Might up the stakes even more tho
Amzn tanks Walgreen by announcing pharmacy, up +35 points. Tsla may be the focus today but I'm gonna grab a few cheeky ones to see if amazon makes it back to 3300

Edit:+45
Gonna try next week
I keep going back to remembering they helped in Afghanistan, that is interesting.
Out of hours is pain cant do anything and have to watch my money burn
My millionaire friend swears it’s going to 800 EOY
Dq split
The guy who designed their chip is also the guy who designed Apple A4, amd athlon 64, amd zen.... sooo
So i guess the play is hold NIO thru earnings and buy puts on Tesla?
I think next week I’ll probably put them out at different times. I have 2 bins, and am up early as is. So will just try and give one to each
I’m the sure the mods would love to see a flick of you wearing them!
oh this is goooood

Tesla was finally added to the S&P 500.  This means the millions of VOO, IVV, VFIAX, FXAIX, and SWPPX investors will own a portion of Telsa.  Thus causing easy upward trend for Tesla as long as they stay profitable.
Anyone on Elon’s dick at market open is the epitome of retarded.
Sell at open don’t look back
Wow cringe 😬
Not even close little buddy. But go for those 2-4% gains on amd. GME just had a 10% day and those are going to start being a regular thing shortly
Nio is gonna hit $60 this week!
They bought some pill co a few months back I thought?
Go Nio Go! :D

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
It’s great to be European, Tesla started at 445$ here and is almost back at ah numbers at around 465$

So legit question, is that all options and futures or stocks? Im canadian and have a wealth sinple account for dividen stocks but i was wondering if options are actually worth it.

Bro just jerk off on the cans
That's its entire basis
My bet is heavily in INOvio. As soon as we know the amount of funding this will go 15% more easily, besides other one of a kind non invasive solutions they have in pipeline. 50% institutional investors who got in at 19$ (black rock, vanguard etc). Leaps, shares - it will be worth 25$ by end of the year.
My entire portfolio consists of tech calls expiring Friday.

This is kinda dark but whatever. I drink a lot of seltzer, therefore produce a lot of cans a week. Tuesday is bin day. For months this sweet little old lady has gathered my cans from the bin into her cart before the truck comes. Recently, this homeless guy started going earlier, and thus beating her to said cans. Today they arrived at the same time and are just sitting on my street yelling at each other about who gets the cans
Hey Jim how’s the show going

Those could be worth pennies by open. Consensus seems that a buyout is coming shortly and cohen already upped his stale yesterday. Last time we ran, retail fomoed in from $7 to 15 over 2 months. Now its going to be retail fomoing in at 12 over a few days
Yea buy in to tsla n get fcked for sure is tge play....dont miss your chance to lose

Ugh IV crush. At least you have some days to go.
Buy Li
You must be pretty retarded. First of all this is a synthetic product that is leveraged. Second of all, its a derivative, so its pretty obvious that if TSLA is up 10% after hours this in the UK is up 25%. If today at premarket the stock falls 2%, this will fall 4+%. The fact that this stuff in the UK has risen 25% is not an anticipation of what will happen today, it's a consequence of what happened yesterday
In this market it doesn’t make sense to get options near itm for spy because it either gaps up or gaps down in after hours(other than last week)
Who do you trust to make a better chip. A company trying it for the first time, or a world leader?
When funds tracing S&P starts buying the price should go up.
Just send it 🚀
I love poopcoin. not as an investment but I love it for what it is. fuck banks and soft bank in particular
Nobody tell him
Look at the TSLA volume in premarket.  Its dog shit poo poo.

When market opens this thing is about to fly so far into fucking orbit you won't even have time to pucker your anus
I think making the assumption that this will scale linearly is a demonstration of your ineptitude

Agreed to short pfe tho
So the plan seems to be not having them counted
oh fuck whats this about the SEC threatening chinese companies now

leave BABA alone
 maybe you should invest into a december rent etf  instead
A damned legend
Every single one of you young fucks that dilute this market with your asinine ideas and illogical decisions, is one more dead fucking body I have to dig out after having caused massive and irreparable damage to our systems.

Ahhh, fuck missed that. Thanks man.
That 2x represents what TSLA is doing after hours and premarket. Should see a big spike once market opens.
You realize Tesla is boomer status at this point right?

Remember the market is forward thinking? Yea that works with industry players too.
i found your answer using about 4 seconds of my life to look up cvs stock on the interweb...amzn is the answer

Kid on Twitter who's not even old enough to legally trade: Yes 

guy: Thanks man!
I thought that happened after hours
Obviously
Nah. I’m balls deep in Tesla.
this is a great time to be in BABA, stock has been basing out for days now. a trip to 280 should be coming soon. 300+ basically guaranteed in a biden administration
Funny thing is, a feb call ntm was selling for 2x a weekly yesterday morning. Half the upside but 3 months to print
Why are you buying them?
CVS calls on sale today. Looking to get back into 70/75c for 1/15/21.

nice, I meant more a another round of pump & dump
It’s a gamble but honestly the best move is swing trading. Look at the premarket high and low as well as the overall sentiment on the stock and try to grab it at the bottom on the way up or the top on the way down.

Normally you can use RSI as a good guideline too. I did this a couple times last week and was up over 300% on the week from day trading PTON, but full disclosure I gave it all back catching a knife on BABA cause I was sure the PDD and JD news would break the downtrend and 💎🙌🏼to the end ruined me
Boomer portfolio beat you.
I think beatcoin is due for another pullback and wipe off retards from the market. Imagine literally buying the top.

I'm scrolling through old posts for NIO to find our prophet, you're the oldest so far at 3 months
Don’t understand how people value TSLA over NVDA. NVDA is going to put fsd in every car brand, not just a single one. And that’s just a small part of their business
I’ve tried SPY strangles before and actually like 2.5-5% OTM both ways and then it stayed with in 1% the whole week I tried it. Never again.

What calls y’all buying for 12/18 and why?
What is money gram
Fake and gay
It's so easy, open a coinbase account, buy a coin, buy a trezor or ledger, park it on there and forget about it for a couple years.
The damage has already been done, but this is just completely wrong, and it's easy to see why. Let's assume we have a once in a lifetime 100% completely effective vaccine. Then, in this study, 0.44% of the control group would get COVID vs 0% of the experimental group would get it.

By your logic, this perfect vaccine is only 0.44% effective (0.44 - 0) and would prevent 1 out of 11360 [1/(0.0044*0.02)] deaths. It's like saying seatbelts are worthless because 0.01% of people die without one and 0.0001% of people die with one die.

Also, your positions are ridiculous. Please mods delete this
Uhh no if he bought 120k worth of options in the weeklies say he got the 465s that were like 0.45,  be like over 3 million
The one with the puzzles.
Hell yeah!
Do you guys understand earning reports are the low hanging fruit? Everyone and their mother knows the plan of buying before earning with the intent to sell off after ER. If a large enough group sells off simultaneously after the ER report of course the price will drop. I've seen so many people burned by holding through ER after a big runup. Most of them are like the cool bar that became a TGI Fridays.
2017 would like a word with you.
I'll make it a hat trick if you don't send me 15k to yolo on losing BABA positions.

Can BABA have one Green Day please
He has to report within a few days of going over 10. There is a lot of speculation that he was buying yesterday and thats why the stock ran. Also the huge blocks of deep itm puts sold worth up to 10% of the company could be him. Couple that with any call buying he may have done and he could have a large stake pretty fast
It's had options for years, use ledger X for regulated shitcoin options

Donate Blood and Semen, give oral sex behind a wendys. Or you can yolo that 1.3k and most likely then have to make 3k with 0k
Bruh I’m from UK so can’t touch options, nor a financial advisor so anything that happens is on you.

Imo this could cause the price to rebalance for November and could easily have a run up through December.
sell and buy after the ER??

Okay fine. I'll tell you my strat. 

As far as I know the trend is Monday to wednesday = pump + stabilize new levels, Thursday to Friday = profit taking so minor pull backs.  

Check the graph and decide for yourself if I'm correct, but yeah CEO of crsr was on mad money last night so idk when the boomer rush will begin, analysts have been upgrading crsr to 30-34 these few days but wait till cyber monday and holiday specials , lockdowns + stimmy  check, this will go to minimum 40 by EOY and I'll keep holding as I see this as a growth stock .

Positions : 12/18 20$ c & 30$c  --- 5/21 20$c & 30$c

I want to say yes but honestly I think PLTR is getting too much attention here. It will go up, but I honestly could see this thing moving at a snails pace with a considerable amount of volatility. If we’re 20 by the end of the year I’ll be damn happy.
HD seems to sell off after every earnings beat. WMT seems to react appropriately.
He would if he wants to repeat his previous success

man, i don’t even know who i’m competing against on this sub

It literally closes the short position unless I'm wrong, meaning their broker essentially puts a market order in to cover all their shares for them. Same thing as a margin call except there isnt a warning. This would be the most intense version of a squeeze
Of the Trinity, I'm really liking LI
Imma lose so much money on home depot
I hope soo, but looking at the order book rn I doubt it
50%
PLTR broke 16. Moon mission from here on out!
i have shares
You lost 10k on tsla cause your dumbass keeps coming her asking teenagers for advice...
europoors at it again
One...So it might take him awhile...probably as long as it’ll take some of my plays to hit
I like how you did everything and stopped short of actually doing the work involved. Not hating on you but it reminds an aweful lot of working at big Fortune 500 companies. No one does shit.
I use both. Lynx (IBKR) mostly for option trading, Degiro for stonks.  
Degiro is much cheaper (as in 10x cheaper) for buying stock.
11/20 NIO vertical spread. Buy $50 sell $55.
December bruv
He made 50k in a day, risking 1/10 of that for potential astronomical gains is a no brainer.

So many people are saying this that I want to sell lmao
The 21st is Saturday..
JPow speaks today, you know what that means.

SPY calls at the dip!
SE to the moon
2 lots for 20 handles and +$1000 🤷🏼‍♀️
Why ? Fundament your answer
I got greedy, should have exited when 70% up and not held overnight, just rarely expect to wake up and be 90% down. If I had held my strangle with puts however, I would have made 300%. Whoops!
Sorry to ask. Who’s the one on the left and right ?
Nio calls.
NIO running out of fuel.
Tell me your next trade please
Searched for confirmation bias on my GME puts for 30 minutes today, found nothing. Gonna be a tough day.
Who is this someone you speak of?
Yup benzo withdrawal here must get off
my mistakes have taught me, if you buy TQQQ calls more than 5 DTE just hold for another day, you’ll be fine as long as the world doesn’t end
[removed]
But no one else makes batteries, these guys are gonna to supply all the batteries. You are fine!!!!
SPY 350 tomorrow boys get some sleep
Hi
You own 1000 shares of Tesla?
Good god shut the fuck up
Look at LI and Xpeng.
Just buy SPY calls at the dip fagboy
Motherfucker I bought 5 pairs, lol. 

Looking forward to trade in a fresh pair after I shit my pants Mon to Fri.
I’m up 4000% since 3 weeks ago. I pulled out 1000% as a happy boy and letting the rest ride saying fuck it.

Might delete the app for a day
Why are premiums going up so fast for the 2021 spring tulip harvest? Getting serious FOMO, about to go all in on a 100 bulb contract yolo
What is invested?
So did any of you retards actually buy TSLA yesterday or are you all under the impression it’s going to somehow rally another 15% lol.
Stops
Man I could go for a nice bowl of meth right now
[deleted]
Dude, I took a lost on pltr $-2500 and bought myself LI and Xpeng. Thank to them, got my money back and some lol
I’m gonna start hoarding SM shares until that shit hits $5 then im gonna sit on them for years
CCL to 14
Buy a fancy dress, a jug of vaseline, get your hair done, and head out behind the local Wendy's.  $5~20 at a time, you can do it.
Havent seen the news... Why you say that?
Feeling hella fomo rn seeing everyone’s gains. Been pretty gay, buying stocks only & staying away from WSB. 

But now I need to make 3k ASAP or I’m fucced. What options for tomorrow? 1.3k to deploy & double
Puts in the meantime. Going to see a bit more red the next few days.
Here comes the PM NIO death march.
Am I allowed to link a [Kitco interview video?](https://www.kitco.com/news/2020-11-16/A-sober-2021-gold-price-target-say-goodbye-to-phenomenal-drivers-HSBC-s-Jim-Steel.html?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation) I'll take the slap on the wrist if that's too 'newsy'. Analyst at HSBC is giving a gold price projection of $1,960 as an average for 2021. That, along with Buffett dumping his Barrick Gold at a loss makes it sound like the deflation narrative is becoming more mainstream as more and more institutions are relaying similar messages. Justified? Probably, but if we learned anything from 2020 it's that when investors and traders have a mindset they overdo it and it ends up snapping in both directions. I'll be following metals closely but I'm waiting to make a move.
Even if the pandemic is solved, people gonna still be buying more gaming PC's cuz they'll have money again, not just time.

And if Biden does stimmy and a lockdown oh boy. CRSR to the moon
PLTR mooning
Alright, you can do this Tesla. Come on, pray with me.

Dear lord, 

Just stay out of our way.
Where is the PLTR-Gang??

I'll take this win in stride by buying a tesla and crashing it into my house
Damn kids!
REEEE
~~Capital gains~~ ALL taxes are tyranny
So what you're saying is pull out that Wet Ass Portfolio and buy shares ?
Not until the 21st? Will probably happen in phases
BABA going up today?
Bulls r fk
Username checks out
Literally tho cuz spy has to buy a shitload of it
Thanks for real response ha. GL brother
It's natural. We've all been there. Nothing to be ashamed of.
Ask on a RH sub.
You can lose more
Don't forget all the stress, that will take off a few years
Trump never truly liked you guys. You just thought he did. How happy are your wives? Good luck with everything guys. 😬👍🥶
All sectors rotate into TSLA today
SE looking like a bigly beat and raised guidance :O
Whelp HD just set the tone. Retail earnings are going to be a sell off. Fukk mannn my WMT calls
Because we've been cumming so hard looking at gainz this last week that we're jizzing blood at this point
Yeah exactly so it’s to be expected, long term looks great to me still so nothing changes.

You could argue to sell now and try to buy even cheaper, but I personally avoid doing it.

If you want another safe play I would recommend IEA
Damn.. sounds personal. Best of luck to u, brother
If you shorten your lifespan you can spend more in retirement.
Lost 10k on tsla I’m good on that one chief
God I hope so
I do not feel risky, I feel like throwing up though
Pretty sure the sell off came early on Friday with the citron article. I don’t think it’ll sell off as hard
TSLA
[deleted]
God I fucking hope so
[deleted]
No shit. The dude's an idiot
Happened to me to wtf is that shit even
stay up late to have enough money for retirement. by doing DD and picking out your next move? no, to shorter your lifespan by constantly being sleep deprived

Calls allow you the option to buy shares at  price. You pay a premium for this option.    
Selling covered calls on tesla is not a bad option imo.
It's been going up 1K every 2-3 pretty reliably lol. Kinda nervous 😬
Yeah ytd was a shocking run! Well it should go hand in hand with the EV run?
Half at bell. Half if it dips.
Same lol and Xans haven’t been helping guh

Damn shoulda got CVS puts after Cramer shilled it. Gotta remember the golden rule
Dow at 29.5k is the dip buy
Spy 356 is the dip buy
Easiest game
Had a feeling today would be red. Markets were wayyyy too optimistic yesterday. Wish I had waited and didn't load up on PLTR yesterday.
Riders of the gamma, your time has come. Lord musk has announced his crusade into the S&P500. It is time, let us sharpen our FD's and brandish our tendies, for we will leave no market maker unsqueezed, no bear unslain and no pension fund unfrontrun. The fury of our FD's will echo in the halls of Robinhood.   To TENDIEHALLA
Yeah it’s been on quite a run, and with the recent news it is to be expected.

If the new funds drive greater long term growth no complaints from me.
I SMELL THE BLOOD OF BULLS 🐻
make VIX great again
I need to make 3k using 1.3k what do I do
It’s all about data aggregation. It’s worth billions and no one does it better. I’m going to look into this at my Fortune 500 company.
Me too, call for 40 EOY... :(

How long do we have to ride this TSLA train until Elon announces an offering?

The profits are pennies compared to what they make off normal drugs tho. They make no real impact on their bottom line. 

I agree with random pumps at anytime bc if good news tho

Why would you touch this after M1 announcement?
BABA gonna die off and ur country gonna be laughed at till u die, u want that to happen, Mr. Xi?
Thank you kind sir
Thanks for buying.  Come again
Keep us updated. If u feel risky, cash out and put everything on $50 call. More contract more money.

I'm inversely invested in Intel with my amd shares
Like 5 percent. 5 percent too much too. Fucker. 

Bought at 49, should have sold before last ER. But I didn't. So now the bag shall be held for a while, sigh. 

My only red position fuckin pisses me off.
Jumped out of NIO last week with profits. Curious to see how they'll do post earnings. Should be interesting
Anyone holding PLUG?
The safehaven
Upvote if your sleep schedule is fucked
Sold at peak yesterday AM and switched to puts as I thought movement matched recent 9:30 AM run then bleed rest of day movement. Got out of puts before the end of the day as I figured it would move back up on expectations and the cheap price. 

Hope it works out for you though! You never can tell in this market and long hold HD should be solid.

Looks like it’s doing the same pattern trend it did yesterday premarket. If it pumps at open I would sell.
Lets go SE! Let’s boom this shit!

Cramer yesterday was telling everyone to buy CVS and Walgreens talk about bad timing

Are u 💯 sure. Last time I got advise here, I lost $1500 three days ago.
Got $90 Jan FSLY calls because of listening to the autist triumvirate of a Reddit hype post, stocktwits, and my own “instinct”.  Possibly screwed up here
40$ EOY OR BAN
What percentage of your portfolios do you guys have invested in Intel?
I remember you did this and was going to buy puts, but was out of meaningful money as it was tied to another deal. You called it right though. Thanks!
What a fucking loser this guy is. Go retire already Jesus Christ haven’t you learned that lesson yet. Some people don’t deserve their luck
After TSLA news I expect the comments to be 75% TSLA, 25% NIO.
The SPY 360 support floor: https://i.imgur.com/g1ksvXe.jpg
Yeah hahaha I noticed that the day after! I mean sure the stock goes up and I really want to buy some shares (and I might do it), but I don't think I'm going to keep it long since it costs $18 000... We can get something cheaper with that money :/
BNTX and MRNA both finish above $100 this week

> But let’s dive a little deeper. Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine. Your absolute risk reduction would be 0.39%, which means getting the COVID-19 vaccine reduces your chance of contracting the disease by 0.39% (0.0039).

Pretty sure this is all meaningless without taking the timeframe into account. Obviously the chance of contracting the virus will increase with time.
yall slipping on CRSR, 

I talked about this at 18, 22, 26 and now it's at 30.

I’ve been holding 45 calls for 3 weeks now. Even last week they were only 1.50 when nio was at 45 dollars. This is definitely er iv
I was in HD for a while but it didn't move much. I missed the yearly run up I guess. And that's a good stock for me to invest in because I shop in one almost every day.

i’ll get lucky someday

I think I'll wait for nvda dip after earnings and then go all in dec 580$ calls.

I probably would have \~20% more net value if I stuck to just share-trading. The learning has been fun, it's more intense and stressful, but I lament what could have been.
Anand TSLA can join its brother NIO back in the RES comment filter section
Dude you're retarded, s&p 500 is based on market cap of the companies so just buy puts for the last 20 something companies with the least market cap 
Even imagining thinking that Apple and others would be taken off s&p 500 is even stupider than being a full autist

Should I sell or hold before NIO earnings?
Lol I’m glad people use that but for me it would still be gross. It’s just splashing water everywhere like on your nuts and your junk just got done marinating in a bowl full of piss and shit aromas. The only time I will go and not shower is if it’s before the gym because I’m just in that mode where I’m about to get all nasty and then shower after anyways. I’m actually a bit of a country boii too but idk how people go to the bathroom and don’t shower after. It’s so simple to train your body to go to the bathroom after breakfast in the morning and before you shower for your day, then again at night after dinner and before you shower for bed. That’s just how I do life and it keeps me feeling clean.
if u don't stop jinxing the bears i will fight u

Sameish.  4 weeks.
There‘s lots of suppliers for exactly this kind of software and they have been providing it for years and are thus also years ahead thanks to experience alone. 

SAP and Siemens COMOS do exactly what PLTR is supposed to do but they are incredibly advanced with features you wouldn’t even think of.

PLTR is overvalued but it will continue to go up because people like to gamble
I'm guessing PFE1 is not a good thing for my calls.
I'm gonna have to agree with you. Both great for sure, PandR finished stronger and was consistently funnier.

Man I wanted to sell cash secured puts today but this isn't red enough
You must be new here.
Will TSLA show it's retard strength now again and shoot up 10% a day this week? Or is it going full boomer with profit taking at open and then flat again?
why is shitcoin rising every day?
Ok but you have to be retarded enough to buy LI 45c with a Friday 11/20 expiry on a Monday at open when it’s trading at 31
Maybe you already did and made all the same mistakes. Which makes sense.

Meme stocks r fine
Oh damn you’re right
Anyone else getting irritated af watching SPY pretend it has strength for like 2 days now

Possibly.
You’re exactly right. 

I worded that badly. (Lack of sleep I’m sure )

But right, I was referring to current case-density - prevalence - as opposed to cumulative totals, (which would include resolved cases). 

Disease prevalence would determine exposure risk.

Say no more, look into it. You'll thank me in 3 years.
SPY is due for a 2% drop today. I have no facts or data to support this claim so don't use this as investment advise.
Sell calls against them.
"turnaround tuesday" and mango tweet should ring some bells
Nio is the Chinese NKLA
Just forget it loser you're too late
I said NIO was a gamma squeeze when it was at $54 and recommended everyone sell, and everyone called me a retard and downvoted me.

Then it dropped and the mods banned me for 3 days so I had to sit here *not* mocking everyone who called me a retard, for 3 whole days.

Congrats!

LET ME OUT NIO
The Mango Indicator triggered yesterday. We're gonna see some serious shit this week.
U wot m8.
I know nothing about this company.
I did not. When did they start to crash? I honestly don’t pay attention to bonds typically.
So almost as if we only locked down the elderly and vulnerable, we wouldn’t have had to have shut down all our businesses and livelihoods that are at least in my case never coming back?
prior to trading on Monday, Dec. 21 which will be our christmas present from Papa Elon
Godspeed 🙏
That EOD green candle actually was a straight up bull trap that got eaten alive by 8pm

ya love to see it. or hate to see it. depends on your position tbh.
History says it'll get dumped, but TSLA is the biggest meme that ever memed. FD calls should print.
Anyone holding HD calls still?  Earnings pm today.  I have Jan 285’s. Hoping for something decent.
That's some rainman shit. How many chromosomes do you have and how does green taste?
WOLOLO BRING ME LUCK ELON

You could drive a truck through that options spread.
Get in on NIU (not NIO) before earnings next week.  You’re welcome.
No, they spun off a company. VTRS. They're worth about the same
Let’s fucking hope my puts would print

I think it’s super smart to get long dated leaps when it’s as low as it is now. Then on any minor spike you can sell a weekly and in about a month you’ll have free leaps

I have 4 1/20/23 13c leaps that’s just generate me spending money any time there’s a pull back. They’re getting close to free

but why would they launch it if its statistically likely it will crash
What do you use the vagina? Are you gay?
Never should have closed those NIO 11/27 70c's. Profit was sweet. Adding more Today at the Open. 

NIO $100+ EOW.
Sir, this is a casino.
Yeah I'd say it wouldn't go anyower than that anytime soon without a big selloff in the mkts
NIO?

Edit: someone already told me....
When the market started to tank back in February/March were there any technical signs leading up to the crash? Was there any way to tell like an hour or two before stuff tanked? Or did the bottom just fall out in the Morning?
We don't do penny stocks.  Read the posting guidelines.
lol @ using RSI in this case. Its fucking China, Xi Jinping can delist BABA overnight if he wanted to. no one cares abut RSI/oversold when it comes to these manipulated shady ass stocks.
Yes
JnJ pledged not too, the ones he picked are going to make profit off it and they can just say anything about a vaccine and shareprice jumps up.
invest in penny stocks 😅

Tesla moons today,
Not very standard nor poor,
I love Elon Musk.
I own pfe is this why?
Yea turns out the vaccine was useless, don’t worry they still have some other products like baby aspirin
only idiots with most of their money in the Nasdaq. SPY is already tech overweight. all tech equities is super risky.
I’m simply stating a trend I’ve observed with both markets rising together. Swiss has been open for 2hrs and 45mins and it’s already showing these results
Yeah I own pfe is this why?
[deleted]
Pfe
Abolutely not. Switched to degiro too, just had 21 bucks left on plus500. If degiro is a proper casino, plus500 are those loot boxes kids get addicted too.  Only weeklies, just a handful of options to choose from, there is a delay when you can buy or sell your options which causes often to get you fucked etc..
And alot more that do not.

How much of our losses are you guaranteeing?  This is up over 1000%, seems due for a dump (scam)
I’m good
Post when you hit 70% not 10
why are you freaking out, its hardly down
No it fucking doesn't lol
But there’s still no vaccine available yet, and nothing has been approved by the FDA. I think all the bad COVID news with it spiking will cause CCL and NCLH to dip again in the near term. Hopefully my CCL and NCLH puts print this week too...
Sell covered calls and collect like $80 a week
Pretty gas my dude
Set order and go to bed.
true, not sure where its going, but guess the bottom is the gap from the day before?

PLTR all the way
RLFTF trades on both the OTC and Swiss markets. COVID therapeutic play that looks surprisingly promising long term

But it’s also good for a quick scalp. Already up 17% on Swiss market. 

When OTC starts trading at 6:30ET RLFTF will follow suit with its Swiss counterpart like it always does. 

There, that’s my DD
You think it will continue going up after opening? I'm really in doubt to put a sell order on my 415C 11/20 which I bought yesterday just before the bell.
[deleted]
Have they stepped up their mRNA game? Logistics of transporting vaccines at South Pole temp seems expensive.
Don’t worry. They’ve only missed on EPS for the past year, you’re totally fucked.
Now YOLO it all in to PLTR calls, thank me later

PLTR seems like they were just way ahead of the times and technological advancements have finally caught up to where they can actually start applying their product. Once people realize the future prospects and potential this thing is gonna pop. Remember the movie Minority Report?

What do we think abt pfe?
So we all saw that the SPCE launch will be delayed by 2 weeks due to New Mexico's lockdown (and luckily not due to engineering faults). This meant the share price fell from $22.27 to $20.89 (yesterday's close). 

We can assume that by the time the lockdown is finished, SPCE should be trading at roughly what it was yesterday - there is no material difference in the *value* of the company. So that is a 6.6% upside over 2 weeks, with relatively little risk. 

Plus, there's the additional upside of the launch working well and it becoming a meme stock.

TL;DR: Buy SPCE shares at open
Buy at 7am and HOLD TO DECEMBER U IDIOT
Why did I not get into Tesla

No worries

If only you bought cbat instead of cbak
"they could have added Tesla now but it's not going to be added until December... "
Good luck
Do the people who paid for their college education get their money back?
While I agree that the vaccine is not going to bring back the economy overnight this post is very innacurate.
Not enough downside for me. I took the 800C's (3/19). Most of them thetas gots kids to feed.
they're for january you fucking tard
This is the way.
Quarter of my portfolio is in Chewy and GME
If I go back to sleep I won't wake up until 9. fml
They have a shitty vaccine, so the chance of them having the best vaccine is lower
I believe the 37% run up the last few weeks has been pricing in the approval for a buy the rumor/sell the news trade
I use dumb ass shitty degiro. Is plus500 better?
This is the way
They don’t really make money off the vaccines bro. It’s just good publicity more than anything else...

Thanks man. I made a yolo bet on CCL last week and lost $50K. Although the trade hit my target it did it pre-market and could not unload the options before they announced an offering. Worst trade of the year for me. I had a gut feeling on this one. Hopefully I recoup my CCL losses. Will be interesting to see where IV is today.
LI December calls were up around 30% at close.

I bought them yesterday randomly to "diversify but really it's keeping pace with NIO calls, and then some maybe
Puts on me.
Fact. Their paid stuff is actually very very good, and gets you $$.

Did anybody else see that endless line of cars lining up in Dallas for the OTM SPY call bank? Times really are tough at the moment.
Ok, so say a stock is trading at 10, you and a million fuckheads like yourself buy an OTM call expiring this Friday with a strike at 12. Some buy stock, moving the price to 11.
The dealers of those calls have to reduce their risk cause theoretically they could lose an infinite amount to you fuckheads, they do this by buying the underlying future or stock and the more they buy the more the price moves up, forcing even more hedging. These calls might expire ITM but the dealers have little risk because they bought stock which is also now higher.

Now if the stock isn't close to the strike price come Thursday and Friday, the dealers can start taking off their hedges, Monday they don't have to hedge at all if there's no real call buying before the next expiration. The larger the percentage of calls expiring the larger the expected move in either direction. This means that there might be a run up during the next few days but there could theoretically be a huge downturn once dealers start unhedgeing positions.

Personally I have only one position in $KRE and then a small put on $SPY with a long dated expiry. I've done ok during the recent run up and waiting too aee how this plays out.
Let me see
What about Arkk?
As a sports gambler first and stock gambler second, Draftkings is poised to take an enormously oversized market share for a few reasons. The sports betting world is stodgy, it’s full of traditionalists that merely adopt, not adapt, to the changing landscape. Live betting being an example, exotic props are another. Domestic books only picked these up because offshore was killing them in the variety of plays available. Draftkings maintains this innovative approach and is giving offshore a run for its money. There’s something to be said too for breaking from the old boys club, they’re the Robinhood of betting, where MGM, William Hill, and the others are the Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, happy to go on with business as usual until they realize the great user interface and efficiency are pulling the low-information investors/gamblers away, who are the profitable clientele compared to the professional trader/gambler. Throw in their readymade infrastructure into every new state and they’re going to be wiping the floor with MGM’s sports division. This is a Roth play.
I’m overwhelmed with joy. My son just said his first word: “Dada”! 

Unfortunately i wasn’t there to witness it but my wife texted me to let me know. She and her boyfriend Dustin are truly lucky to have heard it first hand! Maybe my son will call me Dada some day but I won’t get my hopes up. Dustin is a lucky guy

Anything less than $500 at open is a screaming buy. I own Tesla calls and have sold puts. I think there is room to run to $600.

They will also probably be down 50% tomorrow.

Yes dude!! I remember talking last post. Good luck. Also in nio calls
I’ve been bag holding 300c for 2 months now, was +60% a couple of times but didn’t sell 🤦🏻‍♂️ currently at -20%
Aw man really? I'm not sure when that exact date was but if it was within the past three month's he's definitely down on that. I wonder if they gave some commentary with that or just quietly posted that they did that.

Entirely depends on your outside exposure. In my neck of the woods it's roughly 21 degrees F out, kinda necessitates pants in a sense. At least I only need them to reach the bong in the garage and can lose them right after but still man. Pants for sure.
Your climate and thus your millage may vary.
Glad to make you laugh. The comment resonated with me because I also looked at a bunch of stuff and honestly I can't make heads or tails of what's going to happen next. My conclusion is I've built up a nice buffer for a crash, so may as well keep going long.

Ours is similarly calculated but they focus heavily on goal progress stuff and peer feedback too. I had a pretty big year in that regard and got a unit level award from the division vp for a collaborative effort me and another guy did on our own so I feel entitled to a big one this year. I got shafted last year though so I’m a bit worried
You could have literally cycled selling the stock each time as it hammered on 16.00 yesterday before dropping down again to where you had made the initial purchase. It must have done that 50 times or so and I wonder how many tiny gains you could have banked? It is only a matter of time before it breaks through 16 and long term you have little to worry about.
Vaginas are not potatoes

PLTR CRASHING BRO
Yup
I bought options this morning when it was at 349 dollars premarket in Europe. So yea
Tesla CFDs not moving too much. I’m guessing they’ll shoot up when the stock market opens up. 

I remember the hype last time and it became a minor increase and even a dip, so we’ll see...
Do you plan to hold until expiration or slam the profit shortly after open?
Haha with the way my luck is going your puts might be good. I'm still down on my portfolio 50% this year which is why I'm not planning on holding lol

Just don’t be a paper handed little bitch if it drops, hold onto that shit.
For who I work for, raises are based on performance rating, market adjustment and manager discretion. This year I think our lower performing guys should bank 2%, while top performers might get 7-8%.

Anyone want to hear my thoughts on Apple?
Your new option PFE1 will have underlying of 100 share of PFE, and 12 share of VTRS. 

It will have less liquidity for the first few days. But sounds like it will increase the value of PFE1s? I am not 100% sure.
Long term you are Fine.
Just forget about it
then put it is
If we were to think it logically, Soros got it at 9.5. If he sold now, it would plunge it to like under 13. Ark got it at 14.5ish. 

Other funds may want to hold long term that's why there was an insane high pump to 17.50 and above pre market yesterday. But retail scalpers who bought under 15 knew already realize big profits so they plunge the price and it fall to 15, only for them to buy again and repeat the process. 

Big money pump only for retailers to dump their pump? That doesn't sound so right
I don't know why you feel the need to attack me
They're shares, don't worry
it's definetly undervalued, considering that they will be selling like 10 millions cars each quarter by 2023.
I’m proud of you 👍

why nio is adr ?
I hope so, good LORD willing. Thanks and GOD bless.
But pre market is also up in Europe, how does that math work for you?
Well, its staying at 6 in AH. I cant tell you what to do, I am holding to see if it breaks the strike of 7.5
Humble and measy 150-300%. But I never said my profits are acceptable.
I’m cash gang right now because I looked at a bunch of charts and no play stood out or made sense and I’m literally retarded. I was walking to my car last night and stepped in a hole and fell down. I should have a handler or be in a bubble
The actual risk of a brick falling and hitting your head being reduced from 2% to 1% is a 50% improvement, not 1% as you state. I hope the rest of your argument doesn't hinge on that same misalignment of risk reduction.
Just hold
No why would you think that
when's NIO earning? before open?

Maybe we should use predictive tech to predict the predictive tech stock price
To be very Frank with you, I didn't buy those y'day bc I didn't think the mkts would rally today and therefore I'd get a better price on them today, but clearly I won't be regardless of what the mkt does, those calls would be worth 1500-2000% today, I was hitting my walls y'day after-hours fyi

And the hookers are cheap..... lol. Never been to Hong Kong I was supposed to go there last January but changed my mind last min because of this new thing (at the time) called covid-19. I’ve only been to Vietnam for vacation so my perspective different than yours. But it is my favorite country in Asia. I’ve been to Singapore Thailand Malaysia India Japan South Korea as well and still think Vietnam is better
Good thing we have so many shining examples of communist countries succeeding lol 🤡

Can help expand your business with digital marketing. My guess is not too many boutique investment banking firms are advertising online. Can be geo-location focused to your specific local markets (or if you want to expand you can do so as well).

Hell, this is something you should at least throw a few dollars at to see if it works. Even not with me, find a good digital marketing agency and see how they can help you.

I am Hong Kong. Vietnam is pretty af and has amazing people but it’s also corrupt and polluted as hell. They’re getting away way with being the nice guy next to China a bit too much as they’re basically the same thing just less powerful. They do everything China does, from abducting dissidents abroad to eating dogs and bats.

The prophecy is true. Big money no longer wants PLTR thanks to diamond hand retail scalpers plunging PLTR yesterday from $17.30 to $15.10 in minutes. These diamond hand cunts caused the entire PLTR to crash downwards from now on as big money pull away cause their pump is abused by these scalpers

It already got rejected when it broke through it's current resistance in after-hours y'day, I believe todays high is in at the low $460s, there's gotta be a lot of bag holders from it's ath in Sept and throughout it's downtrend consolidation period since then (look at the daily chart), so I won't be touching it today unless see a massive dip to at least $440 but I'll prolly let this sort out today and buy a dip tomorrow, plus I'm expecting the mkts to be red/slow today so that'll factor in to it's bullishness

Walmart popped like 6-7% last ER but ended the day red. Why? CEO said that the business increase was due to STIMULUS CHECK and not the growth/ecommerce. As long as he keeps his mouth shut during CC and not say stupid things and keep a positive outlook on Walmart+, this shits opening $160 atleast
It’s an analogy, I wasn’t suggesting any play regarding SPCE. I think TSLA hits 500 at some point tomorrow.

So TSLA $500c at open right? 😅
Balls of steel lmao
I’m already in SPCE. Actually bought more yesterday on that dip. If TSLA hits 500 pre market I’ll skip it
I actually bought before the pump, was up 100%, but never sold 🤡

No puts, the next best thing. I own shares and sold covered calls and I don't want to lose my shares or be bothered rolling out the calls.

But I'm not a total dick, I'll meet you halfway. $45.56 it is.
Ok so today its ev day again?
Good luck. TSLA will be on the moon before open and you’re still waiting at security to get on the $SPCE rocket to the moon and that rocket has long been gone. You’re too late.

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

Two doses of MMR gives an 88% protection against mumps.

Mumps is basically not an active disease unless you live in a community of non-vaccinated.

Vaccination allows for manmade herd immunity, pushing R below 0.

Tldr; if you prevent an infection you also prevent that person infecting others. So this MD thinks your analysis should not be so pessimistic about NNT, you should be pessimistic about how many will decline/refuse the vaccine.
Sorry, this race is taking place in China. You must have a factory in China to participate in the China EV Grand Prix.

It’s going over 500 today, so no
Dude get a fucking grip. Your alive, you got a roof over your head, the sun will rise tomorrow and you will do great. You wanna know why you lost? Because you are gambling like most of the other retards on this subreddit and don't know when to cut losses or take gains. Only thing that matters if you're playing the stock market is +ev and if you don't know what +ev is or how to get to +ev you shouldn't be playing the market. It's all about risk management.
Was the TSLA news anticipated? I thought there was talk about it near ER like weeks/months ago but then some other shit got added and it seemed like it wasn't going to happen. Were there nowy recent rumors?

Instead of buying NIO for a potential IV crush, just buy xpev or Li. They will pump with NIO if that happens. If not you win get IV crushed
Less open interest on calls blocking up the prices at the top end of the stock means that price goes up. Anyone who yeets out is just taking pressure off the higher end of the move and letting the rest of us rip upwards now that they're out. Shorters and put holders will be forced to sell at higher and higher prices. Stock prices go down because of a glut of dummies who are willing to buy at lower and lower prices to get it. Getting out after a big move up is amateur hour.

Supply and demand, yo. But by all means, take your profit and lighten the upper end of the stock lol

Sell PLTR low and buy Tesla high. Should work out
That’s what I think will happen but I’m to broke to afford TSLA options
I see, so you have never used borrow money then. Got it thanks. But I assume that would mean you can go over your original amount buying options. That's nice

Before it was my main account I put $3,000 in, it accrued $0.03 in the money market and I pulled the $3k out. For half a year it was the most closely monitored $0.03 in history.
Wait... if tsla is joining.... then who they kicking out 😳????
Damn Twitter got dumped again
What happened? Y’all fight?
A good question.

Vaccine distribution is set up well for around +4°C temperature range, enough so that a standard countertop vaccine fridge in a doctor's office is preset to only control slightly above and below that level (for example +2°C to +8°C). My impression is that the successor to the first generation supercooled vaccines is ones that support more of a +4°C distribution model. I reckon these will be out the door sooner than oral.

Oral is still a useful vaccine model. I predict its most likely best customer for COVID though is going to be the developing world where refrigeration and electricity are less reliable. My hope is that the rich western countries would use that as part of the aid for developing world: either oral, or solar powered vaccine fridges for one of the +4°C vaccines. If the solar powered vaccine fridges, a good value would be to match that with a train-the-trainer education approach for electronics field repair in the desert.
no way does this play out exactly like last week.
TSLA 500c FDs it is at open first dip
Amateur hour.

Freezer bitch
Yea Singapore was fun
I might be derping but I can't seem to find the exercise price for the THCBW warrants. Only thing I was able to find was the SEC filing for the Trust account for the 240k mentioning $10 per.

It the strike for the warrants set?

hey, we're all here to lose some money
Holy shit I just had a dream where I was rescued by Gumby from dying in a fucking salad shooter.  We are going to be green as fuck by open.
Hell yeah. I guess I am a professional analyst after all. I'm not like those who raise price target after a stock mooned.
The million dollar question
😂😂
Looks like it from the futures that just opened thanks
Thanks guys. I could just be overreacting because I missed out on this Tesla surge.... we got into a big fight tonight.
WILL THERE BE A TSLA DIP OR NOT
JD was such an obvious play
Speaking of small brains, the word you wanted was 'effects.'
Well the futures just opened mildly green, so looking good so far!
NIO 🚀🚀🚀📈
I bought 10 shares on Friday, Felt like Imma GENIUS when I saw the share price go up lol.

I should have bought more had spare cash.
NOW BOYS WE LOOK AT THIS LOW VOLUME MOVEMENT AND IMAGINE THE POSSIBLE TENDIES WE COULD MAKE THAT WE CAN FORGET ABOUT AT MARKET OPEN.
Thank you.
NIO is mooning 🚀
And maybe vaccines do cause autism...
How am I gay? Tell that to your wife's boyfriend
100x TSLA and 1000x PLTR half yolo.....I'll see you all in hell!
I miss the days of random feet pics and circuit breakers, now it’s just NIO spam

Ah, yeah, just read it. I guess that VTRS stock must not be worth shit for him to dump like that despite a 99% chance of knowing the free shares coming his way.
Didn’t even look PFE no idea but chances are your still fucked
probably worth have a couple post ER
Dude, toxic people are always around. Especially on the internet. Don't ever let them stop you from doing things you want to do.
Options expiring means options prices will more accurately reflect share price... And with this massive pump delta has gone up with gamma.
Everything will work out, keep your head up
This is not as retarded as some of the $20s put I've seen
How did you seduce him to do that?
You make us pharmacists look retarded. No common sense. Just cause you can read and regurgitate doesn’t mean you’re smart. You don’t even know how vaccine studies are done. Or even how viruses work. Go back to school.
So is NIO a long hold then?
NIO is small blind, TSLA big blind
How has nasdaq not tanked on those giant wicks lmao
If I had NIO I would absolutely sell and play TSLA. Or if I had any bad/flat plays. Except PLTR, keeping that.
Base on my professional analyst experience.
Anddddd he’s gone

Im an antisocial loner so when my chick left, after a brief period of sadness, I was actually happier.
Not so smart when you realize SPY is heavily weighted in Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon which don't give two flips about the virus (these actually tanked when we got a vaccine announcement).
[deleted]
Do it with me just because
Could pump for while because that now when anyone buy any S&P related ETFs/funds, part of that is going towards buying Tesla
As a pharmacist that works in the industry... go back and study. A lot. You’re gonna get eaten alive in 4th year rotations. Do some more journal clubs. 

Think through OPs post again. Use common sense and logic. It does not make any logical sense. 

OP making us pharmacists look bad. I swear guys, we’re not all retarded.
Cause your asking will they print
With the amount of abstract data PLTR is trying to process, at which point will they outmarket the market with their predictions?

Why does this bot exist?  
Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services. Using AMP, they can track you even more, and they might even replace ads with their own, stealing ad revenue from the site's owners. Since there's no consistent way of finding the original links from an AMP link, I made this bot which automatically does it for you.
No

Good question, following
You bought puts again didn’t you?
Hard to see how Covid wasn’t the impetus but only time will tell if it doesn’t become a trend.
No, because some are gonna dump AH, and shares price will fluctuate.

Set your strike and no. shares and walk away from money computer brrr
No time for that. NIO earnings are today.
Stop shorting SPY if you think Covid's going to continue rampaging. SPY is full of companies that benefit or at worst are marginally affected by the virus. Short the Russell 2000 instead which is much more vulnerable to another lockdown.
No, it's more like the 0.21% is 10x my account value.

Either way, we want to see big percentages.
It hurts

The cost is closer to $18,000.00. I believe the person who said $250 was referring to the pre-order fee.

It’s different with fidelity. You open a margin account and put in 50k. Everything in that account now trades as margin, unless you specifically select cash when you make a trade. You pay no interest unless you go over you 50k. So even though it says margin, it’s not borrowed money until it goes over the amount you deposited. That’s how fidelity does it, I think I can go up to 4:1, but I hardly ever use more than I have.

In theory, that is based on the individual stock and the way it performs. There will be a break-even price listed and as long as that stock you purchase makes it to the listed break-even price then you will be making a similar amount

I have 9k of share buy orders for open. Positive vibes only lol
it will either go up, down, or sideways tomorrow
Li $45 tomorrow
Or TSLA will simply issue new shares to the funds and raise even more money at $600 a share. Or the hype will drive the price up and then when the join is done and it doesn't pop right away, everyone will sell and the price will drop. 

Both of these are possible.

Meanwhile outside of NIO Land, RIDE is up 28% today on positive news and the fact that it'll be on Mad Money this upcoming evening. Think I should get out at open and count my tendies or build a play on this event? I'm honestly thinking cash out at open because Cramer is the kiss of death. I don't know how popular it is outside of the WSB bubble.
Not how it works, but don’t take my word for it. You are smarter than the market. You can do better than these idiots. You’re smart (but the MM’s are smarter)
Probably go to 262 and then back down to 260 at close. I'm optimistic for 10 bucks by Friday but the theta will have crushed my weeklies by then.
No, you’re right. In eu it’s currently trading for the high 45s

Buy as many shares as you can/want to carry on margin

Stop losing is alot easier and for a quick swing trade, any interest on the margin is pretty minimal. Fairly common tactic for momentum/swing trading - stock has better liquidity than options, bid/ask is usually pretty tight and they dont gain/lose insane value quickly so you need to just size appropriately

But obviously remind yourself that you are on margin and to keep a reasonable stop loss
I never FOMO but that made me miss out like +70% on XPEV/LI/NIO so yeah

Probably. Just go grab some Cheaper, later dated, higher strike price with a bit of the profits and look for your next opportunity. That way if it keeps going a bit you don’t feel guilty, plus you won’t start to just decay if we trade sideways here for a week or two before the next surge
Just today though. Cause tomorrow NIO will IV crush us.

Yeah, I guess you are right, I feel dumb for selling too early. Still pulled some decent profit off it so not too sore I guess

But I had regretted it for like 2 months not selling them when they went up in September so I decided to just cut and run above $30 just in case they failed to break to the upside
I don't know much, but NIO I love you, That may be all I need to know...
You’re lying. Jeez man

If I used sound investing fundamentals, I’d be posting on r/investing instead
1) Filter stock universe by SP500 criteria.  Compare filter to current SP500 composition. In easy mode you get 498 results, but this isn’t going to be easy mode. 

2) From your filter, start looking at the worst performers.  Obviously it isn’t aapl getting the boot.  Find which names are riding the line or trending to not meet criteria.  Probably a name with lower % composition but that’s my hunch.  

It’s a start. Tbh by the time you do all the work it’ll probably be public knowledge

Well damn good, apparently I’m looking in the wrong place
Is it bad buying shares at market price at open
Sell if u are at breakeven re-enter for better price
No do something cool with the money

If you’re making a shit ton and can’t find stuff to do no offense man but damn you’d have to be boring for that to be true

## Those are neons idiot
Thoughts on what NIO opens up at? I say 48.
Looking like it won’t go past 35
that actually makes a shit ton of sense
Don't think anything changes. You get shares of the new company ( ~0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock for every one share of Pfizer common stock) but I don't see why it would impact your PFE calls.
 So many questions still left unanswered  
So much I've never broken through  
And when I feel NIO near me, sometimes I see so clearly  
That only truth I'll never know is me and you.
I mean if you have good profit at least trim the position. They do keep grinding higher and higher though, I imagine they would shoot up if we get a mega green day at some point
NIO trading for one 8ball in Bogota
Yes, it happened before but then CBS acquired it so technically it’s still in the SP...idk but those puts are weird
mom has the make the tendies. There's a process here.
It's just an idle game if it's numbers on a screen. Go withdraw those gains as $20's and roll around in them or something. If you actually see it it'll be more real to you and you'll be properly excited.
Now that they finished stock can go back up, big boys lose as well, they are just retards with ties and suits
I feel like I saw one that was a play on girls gone wild once. r/gonewild r/wildgirls... I dunno
Nice
Merger? What merger?
LMFAOO finally someone with a sense of humor
Where are you seeing pre-market numbers? AH it was down 1% but AH really doesn’t mean much. I hope it drops tomorrow cause I have puts as well but I think we may have bet wrong hopefully I’m wrong though.

Is it time to sell my 12/18 CRSR 25c and move on?
So over 20 years a market return of 8% on $300k would have netted you about $2.4mill.  A double leverage would have made $9.6mill. 

Not the house and cars. But still ok.  

I do think my post is against spirit of WSB bets. 😅

Or sideways
What is it with you guys and GME? Lol

Fuck I hope not
They split off the viagra company, at least thats the reason the underlaying stock is down
All I got to say is Warren don't cuck AAPL.
what do you base that on?  the unusual put volume for today?
Maybe down then up
Oh yea and then some. Daddy needs a lambo
Anybody messing with LMND? They finally had a damn good day yesterday.
On the second pic we can see ur account number. Be more careful next time..
Was kinda hoping to wake up to tesla 500 ngl
I am pretty sure they are relying on Market Insider random after hours estimates, which are usually 95% incorrect.

Just wait till like 4:05 AM and see where all the pre-market buy orders put us and stare at the premarket chart until we open if you must

Or just wait wake up at 9:25 AM because nothing matters until then. Look at MRNA today. They literally cured covid and sold off AH and at open
nope, lets find new adjectives please
I swear on my NIO calls
try Pepsi

FRANKANDFART EXCHANGE HAS NIO AT 46.26
I already have shares. For some reason, I always lose on calls - its usually because its not far out enough and the company needs more time to rise - I think only leap calls work consistently and those will be way too expensive with Tesla. When you sell puts, you don't spend a dime.

Yep, I'm about 90% certain I got it in late December of last year at Oklahoma Winstar casino- lot of Chinese fly straight in. That's well before any documented cases, it fucked me up and antibiotics didn't work, thought I was going to die.
Why?
First ones free 😉
gains don't excite me anymore, should I start do coke or something
TD shows it at 49 right now
I wouldn't have enough money to buy 100 shares if the price is up to 440. fuck
are AAL puts the move for this week
Really appreciate the thoughtful response, but please respond back to this with your thoughts:

I bought these puts immediately after the news came out and the last vaccine news resulted in an immediate stock price drop the next day as people realized there’s nothing tangible for the next couple months. Also, pre-market is down 1%. I am planning to sell tomorrow so don’t you think making a profit is likely? Let me know what you think and thanks for your time!!
Damn, 1.5 hour commute is insane man. 3 hours a day you need to sit in a car, I would need a PRPL car cushion or some shit to deal with that

Good luck brother and keep the tendies flowing 👍
BABA opening at 300 at BSE (Babylon stock exchange)
Ok, WTF is up with that CNN projection graph?
I am fucked with NIO. Fuck the ER. I gotta get out of NIO in the morning.
My plan was to sell my tesla puts for a small gain and switch to calls first thing this morning.  Wow fuck me then.
I bought these at the september top.
Pre market not open yet
dude but it's safe play. I have been saving money to buy 100 shares, and I almost pulled the trigger last night. suddenly, boom! I missed the chance again.
Green by open.
Same idea as me. Puts when it hits 362 calls when it hits low 350s
He just fed you absolute bullshit. 

What the fuck did you even thought 90% is? It is exactly what it says, redaction of infection chance by 90%. The absolute delta between infection chance is absolutely irrelevant. 

Lets say you have a 0.05 chance of developing bone cancer. I invent cure, that reduces this chance to 0. I announce this news saying i just eliminated bone cancer with 100% effectiveness. But according to OP the ABSOLUTE(oh my god he is so woke) cancer chance reduction is only 0.05%. which is small number. 😭😭😭 Smaller number=bad😡😡😡

Not talking about how less infection rates and less severe covid course if contracted despite vaccine will influence overall situation and mortality. 

Yes, vaccine news are kinda overblown because there is still manufacturing and distribution question, antibody retaining period, but overall ops idea of MATH is retarded
Are these euros?
Whaaat
Your obv missed the point.
IV might help you fly to Tendieville.
Oh that's interesting. My experience comes from residential installation/sales and light commercial but none of the special stuff like that. I would argue they are getting the best of a lot of trends right now. They have high debt in a low interest, highly forgiving environment, they get to ride the home improvement wave that HD, LOW and CAT have been on and I guess now they get the vaccine contract gig. I suppose I don't know if it will continue to tear upwards if those tailwinds fade, but it looks like it's a good bet for the immediate future. I'll nab a monthly call or two.
Fukkkk its actually lower than after market :(
I tries to get Robinhood to forgive me for my first-time offense and they basically told me to fuck off. 🤡
Any books/ articles you'd recommend to somebody who wants to learn more about macro trading. Some in-depth analysis stuffs?

getting removed from S&P usually tanks a stock decently hard. People are trying to figure out which stock will get removed to make space for tsla so they can short it and make $$$$$$$.


edit:just realized you're op. what im saying is that XLNX is getting bought out by amd and its in the S&P. that might not happen in time for when tesla enters tho.
what kinda food do u make?

I will touch your pp for 900k
At least 127M (\~ 15% of free float) (and potentially north of 200M) Tesla shares would need to be bought by institutions. This would create tremendous upwards pressure on Tesla and drive their stock price higher.

Dawg you’re doing what I did back in march. But I switched to bull after losing like (-60%). I have since been up +50% since then. Capitulating early gives you second chances.
Take a break. You’ll need one.

seriously? why didnt you just buy shares at 400 or when it hit 388?

I will buy those off you right now for $200.

I don't have nearly as technical an understanding of their business as you seem to but I've been in it for months knowing it was a solid HVAC company. Right now it's popping off because it turns out they're also going to be producing refrigerated trucks for the vaccine.

I mean.. making it would be a whole thing. You can't just do it with automod rules. Doesn't seem like anyone wants it anyway.
S&P inclusion good sir
yeah they do as long as there is enough money in the account at a certain percentage margin. Selling puts at $400 for example just requires me to be able to buy 100 shares which would only cost around $40k IF assigned which is highly unlikely since this stock will be at 500 easily by end of week so just simply buy the put back and make a quick and easy premium.
Should I get in on more tesla, fedex, and NIO shares?

Technical Analysis is just Astrology for men
Got into trading a couple years ago, but I've been doing it full time for the past six months. I was an accountant at a couple HVAC companies before that so that's why I was excited to ramble about it lol.
What’s TSLA at
I did eSports betting HS. I found some inefficiencies with the website and how it paid out large rewards so I was massively profitable (2000%+). It’s not a problem or even a waste of time if I’m able to garner a statistically positive EV, I figured. I was definitely addicted to it until a string of unthinkable upsets forced me to walk away with some profits. 

Then there’s the actual market. And I’ve never been young or stupid enough to think I can game it like some sketchy gambling site. So I’m not entirely sure what my goal is except to not lose all my capital before I figure out how to effectively use it.

Damn. I too want to know where their pre- pre-market numbers come from. I was looking for an answer in “here’s how you know”
Yes
Oh good a feeling
If you sell a position the day you buy it, that is a day trade. A stop loss is merely a type of sell order.

This is good for all EV. S&P finally admitting the industry is not just a meme.
Why is tsla still relevant?

Just checking if it works.
thanks but hits too close to home.. never had something speak to me so directly 🏳️‍🌈🐻
Ok. So I have buy orders open for the morning for 20 $TSLA, 50 $NIO, 42 $VALE, and 250 $PLTR.
Ey, 345p 11/18 too tho
SPY please open at 363 so I can buy cheap puts 🥰
You hear that boys?

That’s the sound of autists blowing up their accounts on the latest WSB meme stock.

It’s a tale as old as time.
I think if you google stock news you can find stock news
Let's hold each other till the top.
Wait wait someone figure out what company TSLA could possibly replace... shorts on that shit
I get almost 100% of my trading information from WSB. Im definately not encouraging anyone to trade on the advice given here because that would be fucking retarded. But you can definately get a lot of information. Some is good and some is bad, but if you can discern what is what you have a good leg up.
Tomorrow for sure
I bought puts but it’s for Jan2021. $15 strike. Will sell at the end of the month if it’s losing. If it the price drops twice in a row from today, i’ll probably start selling.
Honestly, even after hours I would have bought shares around $440 and $450 - I already hold 100 TSLA shares which I sell weekly covered calls on (thank fucking god not last week), but I did have to stop myself from sizing up when it pulled back after the first move up, because TD always makes me sell my earliest shares and I bought some of those in the $200 range, and more around $300 and I don't want to fuckin sell those

High confidence we are going higher in premarket tomorrow AM
I wish I knew when it did. The production business is absolutely booming. The sales and installation monopoly that was previously held by major service companies is beginning to dissolve as consumers are purchasing equipment wholesale and there's even an "Uber for HVAC installation" app in its early stages which is making the purchase and installation cheaper for homeowners and landlords. The manufacturing companies get to reap the increase in sales, but I suppose it sucks for the chain service stores who can no longer mark up the installations by 3x the equipment purchase price. That's a hard buy from me. YoY revenue may still be wonky for the next couple years from the R22 to 410A refrigerant rollover forcing people to replace instead of repair since it's in the final stretch of the equipment transition.
What is it doing
Thoughts on selling large numbers of Tesla puts at something way OTM like $400? Should be quick and easy premium collection over the next couple weeks?
Same but I didn't fathom someone would burn their country's cash cow over ego. Setting an example is understandable but damaging China's investment reputation is retarded.

Little men are fucking useless
NIO is down .4%.... that’s not drilling
Uh Huh
Yea but well happened yesterday too. NIO loves doing this premarket bullshit
And one of their two criteria for selecting stocks is how many times a company uses the word 'innovation' in their press releases. Literally building an ETF off of buzzwords (this is a good thing)
I'm kinda scarred lol no one's talking about the Futures being red 🤬
Hope you set a price limit.
Future big uppies. Sorry bears, I wish everbody could win but I root for the bulls always(even when im in bear positions).
I’d sell. Any dip that doesn’t get instantly bought up means your contracts are worthless.
No

Bruh I’m over here cracked out off a Ritalin idk what to do with myself I gotta sleep lol
same, gonna buy nio after the er dump, if there is one.
I almost bought a Tesla share today
Oh yeah shares you are totally good to go. Just stop loss appropriately 

Options are going to be fucking wild on TSLA tomorrow, IV is going to be back to insane levels = options premium prices will be sky high. Good for daytrading or swinging some overnight, but not good for buying long dated calls to hold for a while IMO
TLDR: I’m going take a statistic that says your chances of contracting COVID are 10X more likely without a vaccine than with a vaccine but spin it upside down with acronyms no one has heard of and remind you that doomsday is still just around the corner. 

Nice try 🌈🐻
that would be an SEC violation just so u know
That’s only $8,000 if Tesla go up $80 tomorrow. It’s not much fam, it’s not like weekly calls
Wait. Should I buy NIO in the morning or no?
Yeah I actually admitted that I have a problem after last night. I don’t YOLO in any single play but I always am looking for my next “big win”

Might have to talk to someone to figure out if it’s really an addiction. But idk I honestly am always throwing “only $200 into the next big thing.”

(Save for NIO Which is gold)

I own 35

Yes. I’ve got casino puts and the boomer stocks need to go back to where they were two weeks ago
There’s no way it’ll go up. What earnings could they possibly have? An extra 1000 cars sold?
comments like this make me feel warm. We retards gotta support each others
what the flying fuck is going on with NIO
I'm color blind.  Can someone TL/DR me please?
It has been tanking almost every day what are you talking about.
kinda bizarre how this guy is so 100% certain with no doubts that Tesla is going to do a capital raise. Its one thing to say its likely or highly possible but this poster is guaranteeing it. Odd.

Have you any thoughts on the oral vaccine that’s in development, even though it’s further behind? I can’t help thinking that if this is an easy vaccine to solve, and there wouldn’t be the required cold storage problem with a tablet, it might be worth throwing a few coins at.

Do not do this today. Maybe it will push up today but will drop after earnings tomorrow. That would be a good time to get your call. Only buy today if you think that it will give us a catalyst today that will make it go up directly after earnings. Like NIO announcing doing 24hrs shifts now for example...

Honestly the problem is I lost(spent) $2500 in options since March and I don’t mind. I might have a problem. 

I make $32,000 after taxes so I’m not a dead beat. But it takes me weeks to months to recover😅

I have 20 TSLA, 50 NIO, and 250 PLTR buy orders open for the morning. I don’t know how options work sadly. Shares only.

But no worries we've only been up 1% so the day hasn't even started for NIO
This retard gambled his weekly allowance that his mother gives him so he can afford to pay her to rent the basement and he might make his rent if tomorrow goes well.
that's ridiculous, the size in both car volume and market cap of Tesla completely overshadows any other automaker including Nio so why would the S&P base their decision on some overvalued Chinese stock instead of making a decision after consistent profitable quarters from Tesla after it became the most valuable electric car maker with strong investor confidence behind it?

I would probably say stay away from NIO options through earnings unless you have profits you want to gamble at earnings. Maaaybe scalp trade it for the day but earnings is obviously high risk/high reward scenario
Well with a 2k portfolio it seems like you are a poor potato eater.

Ahhhh. I honestly hovered over a 3k loss. Planned on putting it into Li, Nio and Xpeng... thank Jayzova I didnae... i held tight from market high too. Made a huge loss because of that.

If this money is in a ROTH IRA then please reconsider the manner in which you are doing that. You can only withdraw the $6000 you initially put in without penalty. The penalty is severe when you realize it was already taxed once. Save the money for retirement age if you can. If you still want to donate to charity you will end up not wasting tons on taxes instead.
so when you retards play roulette do you do the same thing you do here, basically stand around yelling “red r fuk” and “black r fuk” depending on what color you’re playing? ... i might actually do that

Hmm, I’m eyeing this play too. Call options though. Are you a docu customer? I’m an enterprise customer and their fees are so absurd now + they’ve been getting very strict with envelope limits the last few months that I wouldn’t be surprised if they beat massively. They basically coerce you into upgrading b/c once you have an API and processes in place its so hard to change to another platform. It’s fucking highway robbery though, I’m paying, after hustling with an AM, $3/envelope x 10k allocation a year. Trying to figure out how I can cover that expense by playing w/ their stock.

Gambling addiction is rough. It is a lot like depression where a lot of people will blame you but it is straight up an illness. You have to keep it managed. Help is out there if you look for it. It's pretty bad in here if you've struggled with it before cause the general message is to encourage people to gamble on low % plays. I think telling people can help sometimes tho if theyre looking out for your best interest.

edit:sometimes an underlying condition can be the cause of a gambling addiction. Treating the underlying can help a lot.

I only do calls in certain cases where I want to get exposure to a position but don't want to commit a lot of $$
Potentially more room for growth imo.
Options would of been a better route, less money down for equal tendies
That ride from 1.3 to 300 must have been an exciting 5 minutes.

I don’t get it. How I’m interpreting margin is: you have 80k but the broker give you another 80k so you have 160k in buying power. But it is only if you use that to buy not so volatile stocks. If you buy options, lets say with 10k. Then you have 70k left and 70k they lend you. Basically you can’t use the margin to buy options. Thats how it works in robinhood. I understand it because options is risky. Idk if your broker operates the same way.
Do it and leave us alone

Deal with your gambling addiction brother. If youre trading risky all the time and you drink to deal with the risk/stress, you will become dependent with enough time. Hopefully you hit it big and dont have to deal with any of those two problems, im rooting for ya but don't let it become a real problem.

Or maybe im just talking out of my ass here and you got it managed.

I don't know,  how will it open, but I'm pretty sure it's just shows the price on current open market. 15 min Delayed price in Frankfurt is 445
wishing you luck. i played this a couple years ago but not all in kus i lost my ass in 2018

Yes, unless your bank identifies as poor.

Wasn't there a fund that went under, I don't remember if it was this year or last year; they were shorting vol and they got squeezed so hard they had to barf up their entire position because of a margin call and it was so impactful it affected everything for a few hours of the end of the trading day because a whole bunch of forced vol-buying turned into an upwards spiral. I know ZHedge had an article and a bunch of social media covered it but I couldn't find it quickly on Google.
I AM IN FOR NIO AT MARKET OPENING THROUGH EARNINGS LETS ROLL THIS DIE BABY
This one is better. No “bubble” like there was in 08. The growth stocks (ecommerce, Fintech, Cloud), we’re doing great before Covid (most of my portfolio) and will continue to do great once Covid is gone. The rotation from growth to value will only hurt in the Short term

It’s Fidelity and although they will allow you buy on margin, I wouldn’t recommend it. These trades aren’t on margin in the sense you’re thinking.. it’s an 80k account with only ~ 60k in options, 10k in shares and 10k in cash (money market fund)

lol talking about tsla buying nio
Glad I just held tesla shares cuz you can’t time this shit sometimes lol
... what? I bet my account on a market prediction and I would’ve been perma banned. But I was right. Now I’m doing another ban bet for NIO earnings. So if I survive this one, I wanna know if I do one more and survive if I can get a flair.
What's up?
Worth buying tsla in the am?
TSLA, SBE, PLTR, ABNB
nah jan 21 300c, but 80% of my investment is just shares.

This is why there are 44,000 people in the trial: you vaccinate half, give the others a placebo, don’t tell anyone (including the clinicians) which is which, then see how many from each group get infected in their regular lives. In this case, over 90% of those infected came from the placebo group, which means the vaccine is extremely effective.
After the spike?? I fear you have missed the move since IV is going to be huge. Shares would be the way to go, or you can wait a few weeks to see if premiums come down.

In the letter he outlines their attempt to sell the company in 2018. I suppose the letter either lights a fire under their asses so they can actually cash out or we find out they retired a long time ago and that’s why they lag so far.

I don’t know how investor relations like this normally work, honestly. The fact that Cohen isn’t interested in just 1 board seat wouldn’t worry me except I think that means it’s up to the Old Guard to make initial renovations.

So why are you here?
But in China EV makers all put their stores right next to each other (it's the Chinese way). So when you're out shopping it defs feels competitive. Also Tesla still is the most popular ev brand in China.

bill ackman stood at the window in his office looking out on the view of the park below. The winter wind whipped the last leaves off the trees but he couldn’t feel it. He couldn’t feel much of anything.

The computer on the heavy wooden desk behind him was open to businessinsider.com, on an article heralding him as the next Warren Buffet. He hadn’t felt anything since the deal had gone through and, as he crossed the room and poured himself some of his best cognac, he didn’t know if he’d feel anything ever again.

His hands shook as he put the glass to his mouth. All his life he’d been working, grinding, trying to make the investments he could. He often went against typical advice and was known as a contrarian. As a hedge fund manager, he was no stranger to high expectations. He was used to people relying on him and he had grown accustomed to keeping his focus under pressure.

But that boy today... That tall youth with the dark hair, the one that had come in for an internship. His breath had caught in his chest when they made eye contact and he couldn’t get the young man’s proposal out of his mind. How could he let himself be so distracted?
No, the big mistake is being incapable of logical thinking.

ok 2009 market rally vs this one which was better?

I still think 2009. We've gone up 50% from the lows but the same thing happened in 09 in around the same time. Financial crisis was more serious overall than this "pandemic" fear which really only lasted about 3 months.
I will bet you $100,000 right now that both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna receive EUAs within a month.
9.2 rating on Hot Or Not. So 15 years ago.
It was misheard as that, but the real quote was "Stimulus and Ream-us", we're at the getting reamed part.
Think of it as an asshole shower.
That's exactly what just keeps me from liquidating a good chunk of my portfolio to fund TSLA stonks... and it feels so wrong not to.
Don’t make fun of us bro
This is completely retarded.
Run 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️ 🏃‍♂️ 🏃‍♀️
Crush in the sense that they beat everything. 

They won't miss on anything but the beat won't have been enough to justify the run up.
Are my OTRK calls going to be OK? Idk why I bought them
Sooo should I buy TSLA and PLTR tomorrow? Also how much min?
Sharing is caring my cömrade :)
Sector rotation to TSLA from NIO
TSLA TO 620 , NIO TO 40
No, that has already been accounted for in the option price as well.

Hell yeah they report their Nov earnings on Dec 2nd (including all their black friday sales) and then they report quarterly earnings Dec 10th. If there’s a dip I’ll avg down but there will be a nice rally through Nov hopefully

Now that’s the spirit!

Plus it’ll end up being like $60 per prevented Covid case because without a vaccine practically everyone would get it sooner or later. OP post is bullshit.
Can someone explain why that letter to GME is bullish? Are investors going to rally thinking Ryan is going to buy out GME or at least force their hand to get into the 21st century, causing shorts to cover for a nice short squeeze?
Tesla isn’t a car company.  Did you l know they have a market in Europe where they provide power to houses?  Their prices are cheaper than the market rates there.  Did you know that they sell stationary storage to different companies all over the world and demand is so high leaving them supply constrained and booked out for over 3 years?  Did you know they are the largest residential solar panel provider in the US?  Did you know that some people willing pay $10k for software upgrades when purchasing a Tesla?

Show me Toyota doing anything of the sorts of things and I’ll agree that Tesla needs to sell 30 million cars to justify their valuation.
Sir this is a casino
I just finished the second episode of His Dark Materials and I’m pretty hooked. Is the rest of the show good? Haven’t read the books so it’s a bit confusing but I’ll probably get to understand more as it goes
You are correct my friend. Roughly today there was 1.5 million worth of calls bought for 11/20 50$ strike that showed up on the options flow. Another 400k at 60$ strike
Facts
what happen to amd?
TL;DW: The bear does not bite his hand off. :(
I guess I’m playing earnings, apparently. Actually got the play idea from some person that commented in here about how they played $25c over the summer as vaccine news dropped. 

They recommended playing a CCL 12/18 $25c for their ER on that date, but I wanted more time and a lower strike.
Theyre poor but at least they have free education free healthcare and actual work life balance

Of course, you cant electrify the worlds cars or put people on the moon with that kind of laziness
i got 280C 1/15/21 at around 258 strike 

hope ur right D:

Almost everything you calculate is correct, but your interpretation is wrong. None of this is bad news, bad data, nor suggests this is a bad vaccine. 

This is exactly how vaccines work. You vaccinate WAY more people than would be at risk in order to reduce the risk of ANYONE getting it. And with something as dangerous as covid (or getting hit in the head with the brick), it’s worth getting vaccinated (or wearing a hard hat at a construction site).

Also remember that with much of the country quarantining, your ARR is lower than it would be if things were ‘open’. But your RRR would not be affected. There’s nothing artificial about that - it’s a representation of efficacy RELATIVE to your risk.

I think it’s a stretch to assume they’ll even crush earnings. Unless you’re considering YoY growth
Surprised you sold given you're just a few buckaroo's to hit ITM and today is only Monday. I mean it's all hindsight, but kinda odd you sold with Moderna news. US futures is kind of red, Tesla would have continued flat, probably, no one knows since they already made an announcement.
Don’t be greedy. Take the profit
You play calls/puts directly against the MM and are open to be ripped off by them changing IV to their liking... doesn't matter, they already stopped selling warrants on TSLA as it's a too obvious play.
Dude you might as well just sell that and buy shares

NIO will crush earnings but not enough to justify the run up. 

Wednesday NIO will either be flat or slowly bleed back down to the $45-$50 range.

Can tell you never used one before, get with the times.
After Tesla’s bump today it’s market cap is something over 450billion. That’s almost 3x Toyota. I get Tesla’s future potential is massive, but how can they be worth that much? Toyota makes 10 million+ cars a year. Even if Tesla take a majority of all car sales in the world, they still would need to make 3x as many cars as Toyota. How can Tesla possibly get that size of market share since there is plenty of competition. Just seems like the only reason for stock growth is hype and Fomo.
that’s a weird way of saying +5%
I mean, I’m up on them so. Like I’m fine so far.  I sold my $33 call for hella profit I got it like 2 weeks ago.  I just used some of it for some puts to try to get a little more on a swing down.

What are you talking about? That's exactly how it works. You pay the same price for a share of the same company on exchanges around the world. You just use local currency. And if the price fell down in the us, while chinese exchange was closed, hong kong cannot just resume from their own  previous day. It's a world price. You cannot just go and buy in hk, because it's cheaper

Good god you have misread this. Your math is mostly correct but your conclusions are complete illogical bullshit.

First, the trial data only covers a month or so, so the cases prevented per vaccination is artificially low; over a period of a year or more, it will prevent far more infections.

Second, you’re just plain wrong about the “within seven days” thing - it’s literally the opposite: they don’t start counting infections *until* seven days after the second dose, under the assumption that it takes the recipient about that long to generate an immune response.

Infection data covers the entire trial period, not just seven days.

Company officials have said that the underlying data suggests that immunity will last at least a year.

And you haven’t seen any “closely guarded” data - everything you’re discussing (and distorting) here is public information. They haven’t published detailed data yet; that data is coming soon.

The reality: the vaccine reduces Covid cases by at least 90% in vaccine recipients. Therefore if most people are vaccinated, it will prevent most Covid cases.
Ooh *popcorn*! That sounds exciting, I love when shows have a twist at the end!!

stocktwits, just gotta follow the links within the comment sections of other pump n dump tickers
What a good dog.
He’s basing everything off the fact that he thinks there’s a 0.44% chance of catching covid.

If we use math the same way this retard does, that means the 11.3M covid cases in the US so far imply a population of at least 2.56 billion. And that’s only cases so far, if we’ve only had 1/3 of the total cases that we’re eventually going to get, then we’re looking at a suggested US population bigger than the worlds actual population

Hold NIO earnings or Sell after NIO earnings...the question is 🤔 🤔
In a nutshell, that's exactly what happened. The mustache petes in the party took great offense and Xi personally decided to halt the IPO and dealt a rebuke for anticompetitive practices, such as contracts to prevent vendors from supplying on competing platforms. They will regulate Ant more like a bank than a tech company now.

After you’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars very easily missing out on a few million probably doesn’t matter much. If he goes to the nets he can probably make it up with more endorsement money anyway
Interesting. That makes sense. I’m sure they’ll trim a lot of their positions. That being said, one of them will still have to move down to a 0% stake and be removed from the 500
Ask yourself if it’s just your anxiety from thinking about it too much (placebo effect) or if it’s actually changing your libido. I’d probably see a doc to know for sure
You know it’s already at 15 right

Damn! Why would you put such thoughts in our minds before sleeping :(
U said short term. Jan doesn't seem that short
If we have less in $1 million in gains for trading derivatives, why are we paying taxes? I understand maybe large scale traders, but this is a zero sum market. Why pay an insanely large tax on basically taking money from a big institution. You tax things you don't want. So they literally don't want us taking money from market makers.

There seriously should not be a capital gains tax on zero sum derivatives for the small trader eating from the big boys.
Average cost was $60 and it’s now trading at 22.43. Do you mean current IV or the IV at purchase?
TMUS was added in 2019 and only moved like 5%

Take it to the TSLA question thread.
Or you can set a buy order
This one, PME, is more a curiosity than a prospect. I just really want to know how a tiny fishing fleet went up massively not only during this recent quarter but also five years ago. I'm looking to see if there was intervention or debt relief or what. I don't know much about Chinese stocks outside of RH memeland with the EVs, Luckin and GSX so it's a general exploration. But yeah definitely volatile enough for just shares lol.
Will my 1/15/26 NIO calls get IV crushed if I hold through earnings?

Oh Lord Elon. You have answered my prayers. I am but a humble bag holder of thy calls. I suffered through the dark days of September and October, as other pretenders such as NIO and XPEV, with their snake like tongues, seduced a multitude of retards and engaged in uncleansed carnal knowledge in their mothers' basements. Despite the tendies you rained on their unworthy souls, they turned to idols and false gods. But you did not forsake the faithful. Praise by thy name. Deliverance is at hand. In the name of the Father, the Tequila, and the Holy Memes.

What are we thinking for tj max? Up or down
Over half of Americans have zero savings, so if you in the chat you in the top half

TSLA carrying spy right now. Probably
[And some are wide](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5f90453fc0780)
This. May seem bad, but the outcome could have been far worse and everyone initially expected it after Stonks began their decline for a bit. If anything, shits all priced in now
anyone thats been in this sub 6 months knows the fd's tesla will print. everyone else is either new money (nio) or a gay fucking bitch
This happened to me with square when they ipo'd. I think they only gave me 25% of what I asked for... I think if I had an opportunity to get into airbnb ipo, I would literally mortgage the house and go all in on it
If the index has to make room for such a significant buy of TSLA (1.5%) it's gonna have to do MUCH more than remove all its holdings of the #500 ranked company (0.015% or so) it's going to have a sell off of not only a single company holdings, but portions of every stock it holds besides maybe it's top earners.
Yes
That's a good question.  Probably because idiots like me run out and buy one only to realize their transmissions fail every 20k miles.
I’ve been in and out of PayPal calls the last few weeks, usually day trading but held overnight sometimes. Profitable if played right. Would have got burnt bad holding calls for weeks lol. It got a bump today on that Warren Buffer rumor but it turned out to be false so will be probably go back to mid-low 180s tomorrow.
I am not a pharmacist, but I know statistics. OP's write-up makes little sense. The numbers aren't wrong, but the interpretation is way off.

By the logic OP applied here, even a 100% effective vaccine would be worthless, because COVID does not kill enough people for the vaccine to "prevent deaths".

Worse, OP treats RRR as a time-invariant constant. It is not. We are dealing with a highly transmittable disease. If left unchecked, we would not be looking at 85 COVID cases among 19,388 enrolled patients, but something like 1,000 or even 10,000. The reason it's just 85 is BECAUSE WE ARE IN A FUCKING LOCKDOWN THAT IS WRECKING THE ECONOMY.

Finally, the psychological effect of the vaccine matters much more than the actual economic impact of saving people's lives.

tl,dr; OP is an imposter and numbers don't matter for market sentiment. Long TNA, long UPRO!

Want to make some money? Short Tesla as soon as the market opens.
Closed after five seconds, hated it.
How do you get suspended?
It is legit. FDA doesn’t let companies fuck around with trials like this. It’s double blinded and the symptoms are even reported/collected before knowing whether the patient had the placebo or vaccine. 

There are still lots of questions (like how long immunity lasts, what’s the effect on high risk patients, etc). But these results are great news.
I'm inversing the cat. Puts it is.
I bought 42 500 3dte and 1 455 c 3dte. I'm very happy.
Because as long as they are selling cars with a 7% interest rates to the lowest rungs of society, they will always have a place.
Luckily I added shares of PSX in my Roth, I also have a shitload of PSX calls that will probably expire worthless that I bought months ago.

Refiners have had a stupid week, up like 40% since last Monday with a lot more room to run. PSX and VLO went from not being able to break their 10 day moving averages for 3 months to slicing all the way up through their 100 day’s like Swiss cheese

200 day average is sooo critical... it really needs some vaccine news to spike it through there or it’s really gonna get sold off

Still bullish, the falling wedge was too perfect. Last Monday was the most volume ever traded on XLE for the breakout
Ten years or so
you can make more money on chinese penny stock SHARES than options if you pick the right ones. look at CBAT today and last week...

Look for trades that will be successful once it becomes obvious to everyone else that Trump is actually going to be President for 4 more years. MSM is hiding the big fraud being uncovered and this election is not over yet. Save this comment, Trump will be sworn in in January.

It depends on your risk tolerance. TSLA was about 25% of my portfolio, and remember that if I lost all of it I'd have to make a 33% play to make up the loss. When you get into that kind of hole, it's super easy to dig yourself deeper trying to find the big play to get yourself out of it. 

I trimmed it to 5% today and am still walking away with 100k, which is not bad. It just hits hard knowing that 100k could have been 500k...
Start searching on YouTube. There are hundreds of good tutorials and explanations. OptionAlpha and tasty works are a good start.
Priced in years ago. Market is in 2030, catch up.
Shares in us give you the same right of ownership.  The reason it's down there - it had to catch up to last price here.  I'm not saying it's not gonna go dowm tomorrow, but the fact is baba is slightly up rn. Consider it as continuous market only with different currency
This is one of the best ones on here in a while. So much action lmao

Because (NI)ssan is 66.66% NIO. And honestly even things which are 1% NIO are good investments. Strong buy rating from every analyst in WSB

If you're going to manipulate the data, at least make the math work.  Oh, and BTW - options don't trade when the market is closed.  Need to come up with a better story.
Buy at open sell end of day.
Tesla went up 250 points after hours if we calculate with before split price. Damn. I'm scared to buy fd's now.

Ok I need to stop shitposting and do some DD. There's a shitty previously $85 million market cap Chinese fishing ship penny stock that's up 145% in the past 3 months out of nowhere and it must be holding the secrets behind why other ones are rocketing out of nowhere. If I can understand why, perhaps it'll shed some light on the others.
I'm tired of all this green. When is the next circuit breaker?
There is no publicly funded government run institution that has any shot of having a vaccine ready in 2021. All the groups in phase 2 or 3 trials are private companies. 

If by going long you mean ‘several years’ then sure, I agree. But in this sub going long means like a year - and MRNA and PFE have VERY real shots at being the real deal.
is CBAT gonna keep going with its+50% days or what?

Hard to say since we don't know how the news affects IV, but the intrinsic value alone is $47 so at the bare minimum it's $4.7k per contract. If I had to guess I'd say around $5-5.5k per contract.

If it opens at $460, that's $40 over strike x100 which is $4k. Take away the cost per contract and it's roughly $3600. He won't get the full amount, but anyone would be dumb not to buy those contracts from him for at least $3k each. If someone offered you these 8 contracts for $24k, would you not take it? If you have the money you'd be able to exercise immediately and sell for $8k profit at $460 a share. Selling these at $3k a contract would be dumb. Would be probably $4k each by open at $460 share price.
yeah, and apparently you bought your 900 contracts of TSLA (that only cost $6k) after hours too - right?   $0.15 happens to be the last traded price for the contract.  What a coincidence.

If someone can at least think for themselves about why they believe what they believe. I'm going to like them. Way more than someone who agrees with me for retarded reasons. I'm not strictly either side though. I'm down for gay marriage and abortion, but also people owning guns and shooting up heroin if they want. Literally just do whatever you want and if it infringes on other people's rights we can deal with it then. Otherwise I don't care. Mainly leftist on tax and borders. But again, for much different reasons than the ones they give. So who knows what I really am.

Is it true that hair loss pills ruin your penis?
Bitch it is down less than half a percent
Paul Blart: Mall Cop: Origins
 I’ll break down a bunch of points for why you are underestimating Bero: 

1) Market research indicates a large percentage of their patients are willing to switch; you know, to not being stabbed with a needle. The conservative estimate was 40%. 

2) An approval in Japan will mean a complete monopoly there for HAE, of which BCRX can get up to 40% royalties.  

3) As you indicated, the market is growing. It will be over 5B worth by  2026. 500m is 10% of that, and nowhere close to the 40% expected

4) We already have signs that we will break 100m in the first year, see  posts about the long term trial patients paying for/switching to Bero from Apollo.  

5) Bero is being priced upwards of 500m. When you are talking prices  like that, sales and manufacturing costs are virtually irrelevant. The reason they can charge so much is because of how rare the disease is. Thus imo, 200m per year is a severe understatement/expectation.

Ya probably
GILD it is since it healed trump, wait for the pop.
I got the first half of the chart nailed! Soooo..... You're telling me there's a chance?!
There's the problem though, even if I buy a put tomorrow while the underlying is ripping, I have to be sure that IV crush won't cause it to lose so much money by Wednesday market open that it becomes a losing trade. 

This is where the p/l calculator can help. Let's assume NIO moons to $50 and I buy one 11/20 35p. According to the calculator, it will be around 0.17 and that's if we assume the IV remains at 220+ when the put is purchased.

**Scenario A: No IV crush**
Come Wed morning (after earnings happened the night prior), if nothing else happens (besides the theta aka time decay) and the underlying is still at $50, the put has dropped in value to $0.06. For us to simply **break even** and get the option back to 0.18, the underlying has to drop all the way to around **$46**

**Scenario B: IV crush**
Now, how about if we try to factor in IV crush. Let's assume that IV will drop to 100 post-earnings (could actually be a lot worse). In that case, that same put, at $50 underlying, is only worth 0.01.** Totally flatlined**. In order for us to break even, the underlying has to drop to **$38.25(!!!)**  

And of course, the everything gets worse the closer you move to expiry.

So you've gotta ask yourself, do you really see NIO nosediving from $50 to $38.25 in one day? A 23.5% drop? If not, then forget about it. At that point, the only way realistic way it would make money is if it ended up ITM. Improbable

-------------

IMO, if you truly want to play a bet on NIO post-earnings, wait for IV crush to destroy the puts on Wed. Wait for market open and take a small gamble at 0.01 per contract. You'll be green once the underlying drops to $43

If my calls pay off tomorrow, I'll do just that (and plan to close intraday).

Honestly I think the previous offering and stock split were in preparation for this moment. Don’t know much about the process tho.
I see. Thanks for making that clear. I thought the application was done long ago for approval, and Friday was FDA’s announcement.
I’m hearing from other sources that hospitals and clinics are leaning on PFE by Dec.
I would assume your thought process is correct. 
However, as I’m typing this out on toilet, I came across another thought. This is emergency clearance. Not a regular approval. If the covid numbers are climbing, wouldn’t this pressure FDA to get something out? At some point the nation was pushing resde- something (forgot). This would be a better alternative I would think.

and I agree with you, but I like learning, and am not knowledgeable enough about either of those things, especially the engineering challenges Tesla faces. hit me with everything you have?
He thought that when he was already in, all those pointless rallies lol

So just to make sure we are all rotating to Tesla fd's tomorrow. Don't forget that guys. Sell your shits and bring your buying power to daddy Elon for promised land ticket.

HBO has been coming out with some great mind-fuckers lately. The Outsider was hair-raising.
Buy Tesla shares premarket, switch to calls at open

Thats the part that is dumb. They killed the single day. Was 319 ath. Should've gone higher.

Long on rope
ha ha.
Prices will rocket. I know seeing huge gains makes your pee pee hard, but there's a lot to learn. Be patient, don't go all FOMO.
Wtf is warrant trading

It’s been lifted but Congress is pissed to put it lightly

Not from a retard
It’s not even if I was green I would die, it’s literally da ba dee da ba daa
Learning to trade is learning to ride a bike. Go slow with small money until you have a system that structurally works for you
XLE puts must be free money.

Let’s hope for the sake of half my very small portfolio those calls print lol
As with all things, practice makes perfect. Keep the path!

Good for you man! Now quit while you’re ahead

Speaking from experience, taking 2 months off while you ride high and everything else crashes and burns makes you feel like the real baller.
BABA short term OTM
What sign was there? What was capitalized?
Buy TSLA calls and smash her best friend

Take it to Vegas and bet it all red / black. 50 / 50 odds are better chances for a faster flip than the majority of option plays seen here on WSB.
Wow this sub is actually retarded during the weekday nights. I rarely come here but had some late work to submit and was bored and like most of y'all don't even know BABA has an ADR adjustment when you convert from HK price to USD and everyone's freaking out. The price literally has not changed since US close. Almost all the real price moves occur during US hours anyways or during the 4-930 US premarket.

Omg thank you kind sir I was having withdrawals being away from my fellow degenerates for so long

That line plays quite often in my head when I see pretzels too. Don't know why its so memorable
brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
FYI typically the brokerage credit team liquidates for margin calls whatever position that is:

1) most liquid 
2) causing the margin call

During volatile periods in the maker, high risk margin calls may be auctioned without warning at the brokerages discretion.
Legit why I won’t be riding this ride. It’s the only loss I took in months but the stock was way to volatile. Best of luck to those in it though.
Start making decent swaps I guess
I bought it months ago, I had expected it to run but it’s been flat forever. I like to give myself time so I generally just buy leaps.
I got ZM calls cause of this but its been bleeding a bit each day so far just hoping for a spike one day to sell it
Wake up you sheep
Can DKNG just spike up to 50 so I can live with myself atleast a little.
Let's fucking do this

Why QQQJ? Because it's cheaper? Looks promising? It's following the OQQ looks like. I don't have much buying power right now. I'm heavy solar etf leaps.
You do not understand CCP. CCP hold grudges for a long time.  It will dip lower. My PT is 220 before I buy. If I miss it okay. I miss it. I got great other plays.
retarded by open
A lot
All of this negativity in here saying BABA to 250 or 220 or 0 is giving me hope my calls will print

What they do?
Edit did dd trash company
This is the new normal.
Shit... as an European I'm inclined to FOMO into TSLA calls when warrant trading is opened in an hour or so...
Lol, I should’ve added that. Tbh idk why there’s 4 seconds of black at the end

Ma is not the only one in BABA, this will pass... I'll leave the news and focus on the fact that it's nearly oversold on the daily, rare opportunity...
I'm not sure but I thinkk with the IV explosion you can add a zero at your valuation
The Undoing on HBO Max is a great show
By my calculation you missed out.
What ?
Lol thata how i felt about nio, the pump up is going to feel good but the correction would hurt like fuck
So BABA made 72 billion in a day from Single's Day but because Ant Group doesn't get to IPO, Jack is dead and BABA's going bankrupt? Got it. 90p.
Hell yeah brother! Easy money in this environment
I think mango tweeted about stonks

Pfizer safety data for emergency approval is coming in the next couple days
BABA down to 250!  To all you guys who said BABA was at the bottom last Friday. It likely will go down to 220 before big resistance.

I sold my MRNA 70C 12/04 Calls when MRNA was at $72 3 weeks back. 

How the hell do you think I feel. I had $60K worth.
Make sure you sell tomorrow and roll into a later date.
Did I miss something, why the fuck everyone so bearish on everything other than TSLA
The resistance line has acted as a ceiling for virtually every rally since 09. If you are too brain-dead to understand what resistance is I don't know what to tell you brah.
What new president? Last time I checked our commander in chief lord Donald was still in office
Uhhh not really. If they can just take over a private company, what makes you think we d be any different?

But without ccp support, baba will lose its edge in the market
Y'all made it sound like futures are a disaster. Don't worry banks and tech won't make another big rotation move without the bond futures /ZB and /ZN taking a direction and they are flat. Things will slowly retrace back to status quo until the next big deal headline drops.
But I'm not aware of a conclusion that it's a one and done virus. Can you be reinfected?
I see, sounds like a good pick 

Goodluck
Jack Ma a cutie doe 😳😳😳
TSLA calls in the morning? Or will IV kill me?

Nah boomer rotation is done till vaccine pump next week
Lol not all the time silly. Obviously you’d love for you skill to pay you dividends. But often times the greatest plays by these investors had some sort of luck involved. Warren buffet yolod 40 percent of his investment groups money on Amex when they dropped 30 percent after a scandal. That was actually his first biggest trade that put him on the map. Peter lynch did it with GM, George soros with the British pound. Jesse Livermore with the cotton market in the 1920s. Shit my one personal yolo got me from 20k to to 60k then I yolod 75k into JWN 20c 4/15/2020. I’m almost at a half a million. Point is, one can calll it skill or luck, but the truth is that it’s closer to the middle
Very true
i dont see it,
Lol I know its AH, I didn't buy any. Wondering ufnits worth buying at open or should I expect the option prices to skyrocket as well. You're right, I barely have any idea whats going on, which is why I asked first.
I don’t know enough about this or numbers to say if he’s correct.

But in this thread alone there’s several other options to chose from and nothing on his profile or that he’s said leads me to believe he’s an actual pharmacist.

Nope, they're congressional districts but Congress can mean the house or both just depends on the context.

It's tough to get through the bullshit news right now, left or right. Gotta just ignore their spins and try to find the meat yourself. It's just shitty right now with MSM.

My sister and I weren't on speaking terms for a while because she had access to the earnings report of a big financial company she interned at this summer and wouldn't let me read it ahead of time. Family gives insider information to each other. This was a huge betrayal of trust

You buy and it goes higher.

How much is 15k worth of tsla worth at 180 a share right now ?? Correct answer gets gold
Cheap because you're looking at prices from 4pm. Post your losses. Sounds like you have no idea what's going on. Recommend paper trading first.

It's being implied for a 258 US pre-market open right now. If you got fucked, you already woulda been fucked last 5 days.

Buying or selling? Buying a straddle will only work when you know how to exit properly. Timing is everything, that’s why it’s hard. Great to feel like you’re taking no risking being both puts and calls but it will burn you if the stock doesn’t move, or if you don’t time it right.

S&P 500 Special: Buy a TSLA and get free moderna vaccine!!
Eh I think unless you have crazy algos the stock market is pretty brutal long term. Again you’ll have an edge but if somebody just listens to what experts say they probs have a decent chance.
Yeah obviously 😂 but posts gains at 1am that’s begging for bad luck.
No way in hell they find a noggin comparable to the original
why that strike range? and would you still plan on selling before 12/4?

Lol why is everyone complaining about BABA. It hasn't even moved vs the US closing price.
why?
As of last week 1 of about every 30 Americans tested positive.... not 378. 378 would mean fewer than a million Americans have tested positive
Imagine if NIO reports insane revenue growth coupled with TESLA's news catalyst...everyone's gonna bust all kinds of EV nuts tomorrow.
Oh I pretty much just take my information on american source as well just can't decipher everything. Also I thought that the congress was a synonym for the house. In Canada our political system is pretty much just similar to your house of representative.
I also have been making a lot those last weeks. Almost sold everything waiting for the election to pass. Would have been a terrible idea haha
bro lockdown ain't a solution lmao

daddy fauci, china WHO and CDC all agree on that
I’ve made a stupid % return on playing tsla 405-440.
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.
Oh hello nice just wanted to talk to someone before premarket
Now diversify, get ETF calls more, and take profits often
the worst combo
It sucks when you have no passion for your job. That's why I want to quit

Todays volume on Z was interesting. 740k shares traded in last 15 minutes with 3m daily volume.
Other way around - shares are waaaaay less risky compared to options. With options you can lose a sizeable value of your position within seconds to minutes if the underlying has a crazy swing (I've had this happen). A good example of this would be if I were short TSLA and got $400 puts expiring at the end of this month. These puts will effectively be worthless at open tomorrow due to TSLA's huge gap up (gap up = opening higher than previous day's high). You can make significantly more money on options, as you will see here when people start posting their TSLA call gains (some weekly contracts will go from $70 to $1000+). At least with shares you can hold onto those indefinitely and your only major risk is the company going bankrupt or getting delisted (going from a major exchange, like the NYSE, to the over-the-counter (OTC) market). 

In your example, that person buying that $450c doesn't directly affect you (unless it is a huge sweep, but this is a somewhat complex concept that you can worry about once you understand the basics of options trading). Yes, the person that bought that $450c would make more money on it as the underlying's price went up. There is a website called Options Profit Calculator that will calculate future movement of your options based on the underlying's movement (here is your example contract specifically: http://opcalc.com/h7E). As you can see in the example, as the stock price goes up, the value of your contract will also go up

Lol even market makers and experienced investors would rather chose being lucky on a trade than being right.
I guess I should have specified "and continue to live in a high cost of living area". I need like 80k / year after taxes to live the same way. Seriously considering it but hate that I cant do no risk shit like boomer stocks. I'd have to continue doing options and take on risk
CCP can do whatever it wants. It can literally decide it completely owns BABA so f you investors.

Can we seriously ban all the stupid fucking antimaskers in here? Y'all are gonna fuck up my calls with your bullshit
Right? Thank you for posting this. While reading I was like "I know we are all retards here, but this retard thinks he is smart..."

Dude doesn't even understand his own assumptions make his argument moot.

Where's Paul Volcker when you need him? RIP
What's the next 20bagger play?
Jack Ma is prob replaced by his imposter by now .
Unfortunately your same analysis could also be applied to the flu shot which is 40-80% effective (depending on the season / who you ask) - that does not stop the government from pushing vaccines and from the public believing they are near 100% effective and safe.   As much as I hope people come to their senses and buy into your analysis I’m betting that they won’t.

If not poker but I like playing crash on roobet

I think you'll be okay, but just don't hold til expiration. I have an $80C, 1/21. The next run up, I'm gonna exit. With no stimulus its only a matter of time before we drill.
not a chance- can't live off $400K.
1.08 expensive? What do you say about NIO
then it'll go up like 4000% AH. wednesday rinse and repeat.
Selling January amzn 3000p is literally free money. Expiration is right next to holiday earnings and why would amzn drop below 3000. Finally, I can change the 450 to a 63 on my e class for when the new one comes out.
these are the types of retards giving us advice and probably making money.

its fucking ridiculous
oh right orange man bad
There was 27.5k contracts bought for 60c expiring this Friday as well.

CCP killing the Ant IPO is perplexing. On one hand I get the need for consumer lending regulations, like trying to avoid potential domestic financial collapses, as well as, securing international investor confidence in Chinese investments. On the other hand, delaying the IPO so abruptly is a self fulfilling prophecy of losing international investor confidence, at the least.
I'm retarded and unlucky. So fuck me
Gonna be up 3k on Tesla which will cancel out probably my losses elsewhere since I'm bullish everything. 

Also short puts/long calls on WMT and HD in the morning and short the wide strangle in SE.
I mean realistically having that knowledge gives you just an edge over them. Just like sports betting, knowing a shit ton about sports really only gives you a slight edge sadly.
absolutely.
PRC wouldn't throw them in jail.  They'd ask for stock and cover up the fraud.

I wonder how many autists are railing addies tonight(no coke its a weeknight, you degens) waiting for 2am to post so they can see the 58 shares traded on the German market open at 450 as they watch their 11/27 TSLA 430c fade into it’s crush as Tesla makes its slow decent to its natural home of 440-420 2-4:30 am is gonna be. A total fucking shitshow.   It’ll be worse than a goddamn dog track on a Thursday night.

I’m bullish on NIO because China’s market is so large and unlike Luckin Coffee, NIO has a close relationship with the Chinese government and if they ever pulled some fraudulent scam on investors— the executive board team would be arrested and thrown into prison forever (China’s courts have a 99% conviction rate) 

This is the 1 thing China gets right: punishing white collar crime 🥰
I've seen so much people speaking about it and I have yet to understand. Billionnaires talked about it in Davos will most likely be bad for us or something. Either way I am excited for it, feel like it is the dawn of an expansion release for whatever mmo i was playing in 2006.

Also love how non chalantely its been named as a factor to maybe slow corsair stocks progress.
What happened?
hell no, but mostly because i suck at trading
I have TSLA, NIO and PLTR in my portfolio and none of these follow SPY. So whateva fuck futures does doesn’t matter to me!

Ya, I wouldn't listen to your media too much. It's got a filter on it. Go straight to American sources bc there's definitely a lot of information that people miss.

And BTW we've got 3 branches, executive, legislative and judicial. The house of representatives and the Senate make up the legislative. Often it's just called Congress.

It's a really mixed bag this election, the volatility is fucking awesome tho IMO.

Nothing comprehensive because no one ever says anything explicit about China. It's all the same quotes about "innovation" and the clip he said about needing collateral in order to secure loans from Chinese banks which is why Ant is coming into play, to facilitate easier loans and make credit more accessible. China is gonna use this to leverage their position to make sure they get a bigger percentage if the pie. I think I remember reading that 30% of all loans needed to be tied to central banks, now I'm sure it will be significantly more.

Imo no fucking way this doesn't happen. They'll just smack Jack around for a bit, make him sweat, and take a better deal. The CCP continues to stand to make a fortune from Ant.
I blame Donald by tweeting about the market

Guys, this is the **BIGGEST** equity index addition & funding round in history by dollar value:

[https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/media-center/news-announcements/#indexNews](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/media-center/news-announcements/#indexNews)

The scale of this event is mind-blowing:

* Passive S&P 500 index following funds (over 5 trillion dollars of assets under management) alone will in the next 4 weeks reallocate 1.01% of their assets and buy & hold 127 million TSLA shares (worth $52b) and **effectively move them out of circulation**. This alone is more than 17% of the free float.
* But there's another 6.5 trillion dollars of actively managed funds indexed to the S&P 500. They too will buy & hold TSLA shares, worth about $65b, over 22% of the TSLA free float. Many of them own TSLA already - but most of them don't.
* An important detail is that TSLA was not part of the S&P 400 already - in which case for most funds the addition is only an internal reshuffling. It's a **new** addition, which is rare - and the magnitude of the TSLA S&P 500 addition is unprecedented.

In total that's **removing around 40% of TSLA's free float from circulation**, similar to a TSLA share buyback program of $110b ...

Remember what happened after AAPL gradually bought back \~35% of their shares over the past 7 years? This is now happening to TSLA over just a few weeks ...

The +10% after-hours could just be the beginning... 🤠
i abandoned musk, i deserve this wretched punishment
Your right, you can’t prove it though. If the MM’s let the market drop when enough “retail” investors have puts in place.. it would cause the bigger funds to lose money. The market drops dramatically when the little guy least expects it, but the big guy already knows.
Now is the time for airlines
Troll or real? Don't give me false hope what happened
Wow. What’s the plan? Hold tomorrow or sell at open?
Futures were up all night last night
New lockdown is good to ZM right???
Can it go back to previous heights of 1000 after the splitting?
I have poots
I’m going to assume tomorrow is going to be shit so I’m not going to get my hopes up b4 bedtime.
If you had 400k would you quit your job and just trade instead?
I have puts
Had TSLA calls sold for December at a $460 strike. Was up about 50% on them so far and was debating buying them back today. Figured TSLA was consolidating and with the China EV excitement it could run down to $395/$400 in the next few weeks so I held the option. 🤦‍♂️
If you're not in Tesla already, better to wait for another entry point. Sell the news, not buy.
I literally loled at a WSB meme, fml
Animal abuse or nah?
Really?! That’s a lot of money
it's a regulatory credit company, that's the thing they sell the most.

>I don’t mean to burst your bubble but you’re only gonna be up like 200% 😶 great gains man! But new man idk about that.

Assuming price doesn't suddenly drop he is looking at each contract being worth at least $35-36 (probably more realistically).

That's almost 1000% return!

Congrats OP!

im not up to date with all the recent lockdowns but most of what ive seen are just indoor dining, movie theaters, bars and gym closures, so most business will keep operating
NIU make solid EV scooters and are pumping out hundreds of thousands.  People be sleeping on them.
Get a job. No one over 20 should have less than 25K lol
If I let Mr. Ackman use me as his little fuck toy I wouldn’t even enjoy it. I’m not doing it for pleasure. I just want to make him and my portfolio happy. I’m sure he’s under a lot of stress.
Don't sell right at open unless you know shit is going to hit the fan or stuff starts seriously tanking hard once markets open. Markets are very volatile for the first 15 to 30 minutes of trading as people get in quick trades and ride the premarket numbers. Then things begin to shake out and trends form for the day.

Bottom line? In any situation, take profits when you can and don't get greedy or you might be left with useless contracts. It's difficult to remember, but most options contracts expire worthless. And all expire worthless unless you plan to exercise. 

Regardless, you can always buy back in if a trend keeps rolling. Sure you lose a bit of meat, but it's better to take profits than lose your account holding out for the big numbers.
Yeah. Prob 100% gains

Haha I started at Boeing last year right after the initial selloff. People at the office were expecting a quick return to fleet and for their retirement accounts to shoot right back up. Lol.


I'm expecting short term gains on BA, then a selloff when people realize it's gonna take years for Boeing to fully recover. Hopefully we see $400+ within the next two years.
I generally like to hold for at least one year to get  long term capital gains. Although I will cut if the trend has clearly changed and there is still some decent premium on the contract. Going in though I’m prepared to lose the whole contract.

Oh okay yeah this does seem really complicated with the three branch of government and a fourth one in the supreme court. I honestly hadn't paid attention to any other election prior to this one and was confused as hell about how the electoral college worked. Now peoples are bringing the supreme court in the lot and also I just learned in your post that the congress can also oppose the elector vote. I also think Biden + republican senate is the best scenario for us. Hopefully your inceritude will be over soon enough and no president will have to get dragged out of the white house haha.
Yes exactly but it’s top reddit LPT right now, people are upvoting common sense and pretending it’s good advice

Right? It either will or it won’t. The in between is what you make of it
Tesla bulls argue indexation created more demand for the stock. There are, after all, roughly $12 trillion in mutual fund assets indexed to the S&P 500. Very roughly, $100 billion in Tesla stock has to be bought by index funds. That does mean elevated demand for a few trading days. But other market pundits argue any price bump from indexation is temporary. After index funds buy, trading volumes return to normal
BABA gang rise up

Take it to the Tesla bullshit thread.
Futures have been fading all evening. Slowly but surely going lower and lower.

If it opens red tomorrow, it will be at least -1%. I don't see us having a red day that's only -0.5% or less.
It rose something like 30% off that news. Why would it keep going up?
Moderna calls ?
Feeing ok now buddy?
I predict a green day tomorrow because the bears lost to the Vikings.
Just because you type big sentences doesn't make them true.

Same, I’ve had about $20k in $450 calls expire since October expecting surprise S&P.  At least I still have a couple 11/27 $440
Would like to know this as well
Fake as shit
When retail gets a chance to buy in it’ll already be up 80%. Be honest.

Bears gonna be angry in the morning when VIX nosedives at open

Then around midday VIX will creep up out of nowhere and SPY will look like a rollercoaster about to drop

Then after edging bears, SPY picks back up and VIX dies back down

And end of day pumps into close cause why not

A tale as old as time

Act now! Before I change my mind.
It's unfathomable for BABA to be like this for so long. I'm usually mostly cautious too. I've learned even the most unexpected can happen. My weeklies are getting ravished; I hope my shares and Jan's will make up for it. I'm confounded too.

OPs a pharmacist. They're not a medical expert and I'm not either. I'm just cranking numbers. I'm not sure what they're doing. Dry ice can the Pfizer vaccines cold enough and that's not exactly hard to come by. 

There should be at least a few statisticians on this sub that can show what I'm talking about.
Over 100 grand between 550c and 500c expiring next month. You really need to get your head checked.
I'm counting on that as well... But thinking I should get rid of the Dec ones a lot sooner
I can’t believe I bought more baba leaps today. I should lick speeding tires instead lol

I bet the under today Bears Vikings. Easy 100% gain. These 10% and 20% gains are nothing in the sports betting world. Why do people gamble in the market. When they can gamble on the NFL and get 10 times the returns? Seriously. Someone explain this to me please

You’re joking right? In what way in your mind are they on the brink of bankruptcy? They’re incredibly well capitalized! By all measures, an extremely financially stable company.

What’s wrong with GM? They have the second best battery tech in the game (ultium batteries) all made in house. They sell more EVs than Tesla and Nio do within China. They have the top rated autonomous driving program (cruise) which has been running fully autonomous trips in San Francisco without a safety driver. In all honesty, they’re one of the best automakers in the game rn. Certainly the best positioned for the future. Nio on the other hand doesn’t have their own battery tech, doesn’t have their own autonomous driving program, doesn’t have their own factory, hell- they don’t even have a license to manufacture EVs in China.
Why is it drilling tomorrow?

Yes. The price is fixed. So the whole point is that selling shareholders at XLNX know exactly what they are receiving in AMD shares. There is no way for XLNX shares to drop to $50, because market participants (aka merger arb shops) would buy XLNX shares since it would be “free” money

I love it. Retards would rather try to find the 1/500 stock that will go down, rather than buying calls in the Elongated Muskrat
That’s a little high imo but if it prints it’ll print hard. We’ve seen crazier movement
You dumbass, market makers do exact opposite of what you want
Call out the troops eh. I'm joining you I see it. Leaps are fucking pricey tho..
Quick question about this tsla s&p inclusion. Is it typical for a recently added company’s stock to skyrocket after the inclusion or is tsla just a special case ? I was looking at Etsy and teradyne as examples and I guess they kinda went up a lot over a month or two. Wonder if I should be expecting something similar in Tesla’s case.
Yah boy, I was about to buy puts just to get this shit to sky rocket.
Vaccine didn't stop the incoming shutdown. Bull still beat tho. SPY calls on Tesla MF

An epidemiologist also cautions that we don't know about the long term immunity of the vaccine yet  [https://twitter.com/michaelmina\_lab/status/1328352029190877185](https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1328352029190877185)

I don't think the rest of the math is very relevant. If each individual's chance of getting the virus is actually reduced by 95% long-term and we vaccinate a majority of people, the virus R will be approximately halved, pushing it below 1 and dying out.

Then be happy with your decision, but look at the weekly and see if you bought into a fake out. The worst part of trading is when you look back on previous trades, and it can be more stressful than actually losing money. Overall, just analyze the play from an outside perspective and write down who you listened to as a source and why you sold out. Write down your own investment rules.

I've started investment one month ago, got quite a large chunk of money from NIO and open leveraged positions in BABA right before 11/11 sales.

How long do you hold and when do you decide to sell?
Hello son
As a pharmacy student I can back up u/gaarguinchona 's assessment. The RRR is very good and if Covid were more transmittable, this vaccine would be a boon (and if we fully reopen it will be), but if we were to administer the vaccines during a lockdown we would see very little effect. Not to mention many people are starting conspiracy theories about the vaccines being near approval so soon after the election.

RRR is a much better indicator in high probability scenarios, but damn near useless as the probability of the outcome by chance decreases.

Vaccine = rotation out of tech. 
Virus fears = rotation into tech.
What happened when you went down from 18 to 1.8??
I've been worried about 2 things with these vaccines.  


1. Because the population spreading/most likely to get the disease thinks its a hoax; and the population most likely to sign up for an experimental vaccine trial is more likely to practice social distancing/quarantine protocols, it is unlikely we are seeing these results in a representative population and this pre selection bias might have introduced some kind of confounding variable that inflates the efficacy. Specifically in their trial design they are basically making a ratio of transmission rates and calling efficacy. If both populations are practicing social distance/mask/quarantine then transmission rates would be massively reduced and as we know small n = big error (in this case it would be the effective n of people challenged with the disease that we can't really measure but are guessing at). So the underlying assumption of a homogenous endemic distribution of the disease in the population is broken. Its stretches my belief that a technology that has never worked before could suddenly produce 2 miraculous results in short succession.
2. You can go on BioNtechs website and read through their Zika vaccine paper. This is the same technology they are using in the Covid vaccine. They have trial data in macaques and measure antibodies up to 5 weeks. I want to know what happened at week 6+. That did not seem to be discussed in the paper and omissions like that are usually a huge red flag for me when I'm reading papers.

Yes he’s copy pasting that line over and over lol. DONT GO FOMO AND MAKE PRICE GO UP!... lol. If you want my advice, go all in tomorrow and thank me later. Just don’t get weeklies. She will go up and you will make your 70% loss in no time
Actually good advice
This is so remarkably stupid lol.  I should have went to pharmacy school with all the med school washouts

It doesn't matter how many cases they prevented this time.  (1) They are dealing with an unusual unrepresentative population (people who care enough to enroll in vaccine trials).  These people are probably not going to parties and eating indoors in red-state restaurants.  (2) For much of the trial, case counts across the US were not \*that\* insane (the blowup over the past few weeks is much worse).

The only thing that matters is how many more placebo people got infected.  If the placebo people and real-shot people are getting infected at the same rates, the shot doesn't work.  If the rates are different, then statistically, it's very likely the shot is preventing at least some infections.  Here, the results are strongly skewed, so we very likely have a strong shot.

This post is like reading about an Ebola vaccine trial and then having someone say "but it only prevented 5 cases of Ebola!"  No shit.  Ebola is a rare disease.  Same with covid (until recently and on a relative scale).  The key thing -- the only thing that matters -- is how good are the odds that the shot makes you immune?  Here, at least in the short term (we don't have long-term data yet), it's probably 90%.

If you are reading this and you are not sure if OP is a complete moron, please ponder this more:  "To prevent the roughly 240,000 COVID deaths in the US, over 3 billion vaccines would have to be given (240,000 x 12,580)."  Lol so dumb.  OP is basically saying that even if every single American gets this thing, that would only be 1/10ths of the shots needed.  Does not compute.

Should I get out of bed and go buy this dip on Es. This could be a generational buying opportunity. This might be the last time we see red this year
I have like 50 puts so I doubt it
Classic WSB.
God I want to buy options but my account isn't set up for options. Just gonna sit on my boomer oil stocks I guess... Up 25% since October
This literally isn’t how statistics work.
If you hit a ten bagger once every ten tries, you just break even lol
That sucks 

I did that with GME at $9.50 and it went to $14

I lost 1500 fucking SHARES
Sure do, but have major support to break until we fill those.  I think there will be a better short position.  Looking at SPY $348 to break
I bought puts too... 200s are way too high rn

As a Trump guy, with respect, how could knowing this guy has lost it as you say be someone you'd want for this country another 4 years if the votes had gone his way?
I’m just curious tho has this type of movement happened to any other company that recently joined the s&p or is Tesla a special case?
Wheel strategy?
You think so?
[removed]
So you think on December 21 they dump 1.3% of their holdings and buy billions of tsla?

Plus it isn’t just SPY/SPX how many hedge funds track the 500?

They will be making moves now to reflect TSLA inclusion when they release their reports in Jan/Feb to have TSLA in their and reflective for their next Q reports
Gm has no potential I’d sell
Imagine not having them

yeah that's the GT3RS, the GT2RS has a black bumper
No. But I'd like to change that, send it here.

Welcome, we have been waiting for you
cheap calls tomorrow
Mine too! Most public won’t get the vaccine until May or June and we are about to go on lockdown in January. This vaccine dip is a perfect time to pick up ZM

For real!  Down 89% here but was caught explaining why PLUG tanked and said not to double down anytime soon.  Like I've been making money...

Guys did you hear LPT says giving pets as gifts is a bad idea and I already mailed 8 kittens Kongo and Vietnam. Here is a real LPT: Buy some muthafuken AMD
🐻
Tech is not at ath. Wtf are u saying?
Did a double take in AH. Life is funny sometimes.
You obviously grew up in a wealthy household. Likely in a wealthy California suburb. Maybe NYC. Seems you don’t understand what the country is actually like. 50% of people have less than 250k net worth upon retirement. Even looking at people with college degrees. 50% retire with less than 290k net worth. Not everyone wastes 10-15k a month on the basics like your parents probably do.
I'm hoping that the NVDA upside will finally bring up AMD with it in all the semiconductor ETFs, would be a huge fucking boon for the fact that I didn't make a 100 bagger dumping all my 90cs in NIO and SPY opening last week
69,420
That’s the way the dick sucks
[deleted]
The amount of times I bought sold and rebought them only to buy again at a loss and get ultra screwed at the end ceases to amaze me, I can’t sit on my hands.

I’m hoping so, I’m looking at -15% on just my last purchase but hopefully I can make that back + some of the 15k I lost yesterday. Think I’ll go long on some leaps after this and quit

Think these green ETFs are in a bit of a bubble and will trade flat-ish for a while, but that could be recency bias.
Signed. I completely agree with the sentiment, and it’s a chance to support a fellow tard. Win-win
Is this a thing now
That's the goal lol, don't buy calls unless it's sub $11 though

I think it bottomed at $10.02 in AH today on meh earnings
Im guessing you trade full time since 2004? Or do you still have a dayjob
Some appl positive movement would be nice before January. At least give me 125.....

I seriously think Palantir was building an infrastructure for the past 17 years, now it's got a reputation and people believe in it with revenues almost doubling. This stock is going to the moon.PERIOD.
We’ll be open by open just you wait
Joke's on you, I never talk, I just sell calls.
I agree, but quite frankly I really don’t think it’s a good idea to go ahead dropping time frames on this kinda shit
I buy Apple calls on dips
*Struggles to understand why futures are down after weeks of straight mooning*

Hmmm... CHYNA! 🇨🇳
Flip side is this is sell the news and it will take 6 months to a year to get our economy back in full swing and back true all time highs.
I hope that's 350C but we are in WSB so nah
I think your puts will be fine, depending on the time frame. I bought a bunch on SPY and Im underwater but not really worried (yet).
This BABA dip lookin juicier than a mother fucka
Please pull out your original investment at minimum at open tomorrow. Also, congrats on being 19 and filling up your Roth already. It’s a really smart play. I just started at 24 and wish I did at your age.

They don't call them europoors for nothing

That was awesome!

Are we seriously going down just because of mango?
nah I’m ugly
I haven’t heard of that actually getting enforced at all. The new rules are to get a test after 3 days (because Covid takes 3 days to incubate). I would definitely get the rapid test after 3 days because it’s easy and it’s a good thing to do. As far as literally quarantining in the hotel before the test??? I think it’s ok to go out and just do mostly outdoor activities for the first few days and wear your masks religiously... you’ll still be doing your part to keep the spread down.
Hello fellow QT user lol.
/u/dingeaux is right. Claiming that we would need to vaccinate 3 billion out of 330 million Americans is a clue that his model is missing something.
I'll never feel bad for whoever has the cash to write TSLA calls.
Dude congrats.  Would like to know your change in Tesla holding $ amount today and then an update tomorrow.
Some shitty remix of the im blue if I was green I would die song
You’re 18 please put at least half of that in an etf and let it compound
This is unlike any other inclusion in history. You’re comparing apples to oranges. Tesla just had a capital raise on 2nd of September, it would be unprecedented to do another. 

Quit spewing your bullshit b
i am so proud of you
The only reason jt would open that low is because nasdaq down like 1-2% that’s my logic I doubt it goes that low
Anymore stim talks or are we waiting till February? Not like it matter, we're higher now. 🚬
Next week JNJ then The following week AZN
British? Japanese? What the fuck is this?

I only speak American and Chinese you fucking wanker
So would the losers.

What if GME squeezes and Ryan Cohen is found dead in a desert lmfao
i just wanna sell my tesla calls tmo morning
Yeah that was the real kicker. I was up 4K that morning, after lunch, down 3k
Do you not understand we're at ATHs?
Mango just gave you 4 years of bull runs. Don't be such a 🏳‍🌈🤡
If you wait through earnings, IV crush will get you. I would close before last bell and then re open tomorrow.

But it's up to you and how much risk you are willing to take. Remember, everything is priced in unless NIO absolutely demolishes earnings. Odds are prices will drop before earnings, then rise after earnings if they do well. If they missed the mark, they will drill in AH probably.

Then again NIO has some serious retard strength with price bounces. So I am most likely wrong.
The VALE pump was low key hilarious
Congrats. Don’t hold through earnings unless you want to lose it all

Just trust us, everything will be ok. Just listen to our commands. You’ll be ok, the Government will give you an income and food rations, it will all be ok soon. Just listen to the news people and don’t be worried about big tech censoring anything. Just quit gathering and talking to one another. Just close your 2nd generation business, there are bigger corporations now that will deliver anything you need. Just take this little ‘warp speed’ vaccine that was rushed into production, there aren’t any unknown long term affects because, just because. Stop talking to each other, wear a mask, stop talking.
Mango tweeted about record dow
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480627/

>Herd immunity is achieved when one infected person in a population generates less than one secondary case on average, which corresponds to the effective reproduction number R (that is, the average number of persons infected by a case) dropping below 1 in the absence of interventions. In a population in which individuals mix homogeneously and are equally susceptible and contagious, R = (1 − pC)(1 − pI)R0 (equation 1), where pC is the relative reduction in transmission rates due to non-pharmaceutical interventions; pI is the proportion of immune individuals; and R0 is the reproduction number in the absence of control measures in a fully susceptible population. R0 may vary across populations and over time, depending on the nature and number of contacts among individuals and potentially environmental factors. In the absence of control measures (pC = 0), the condition for herd immunity (R < 1, where R = (1 − pI)R0) is therefore achieved when the proportion of immune individuals reaches pI = 1 – 1/R0. 

My assumption with R0 at 2, you only need 50% of people to be immune or 53% of people to take the vaccine (53% take X 95% immunized = 50%).

95% effective = 95% of people who take it are effectively immune. We can quibble on what the R0 is, say it's 3.0. Then 66.7% of people need to be immune, assuming nobody wears masks etc. Or 70% of people would need to take the virus.

But.. masks are already 70% effective. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html So combine wearing masks with such a vaccine.. doesn't take much to get herd immunity.
Same, congrats and good luck you fertile son of a bitch

I’m so confused all this hype and we are red
CODX?
These keyboards last too long. Been using mine for 3 years now. Short
I wonder if WSB autists would go all in on calls if it opens that low. That would indicate to me that there wouldn’t be a moon mission.
When you think they announce a capital raise which is going to happen as as large companies that enter S&p500 do. This is the largest.
It can’t go up forever especially w the Dow being allergic to the number 30,000
$COB
I just like rustling the lib feathers
Yep no vaccine in sight then 2 with 90 percentile effectiveness ? Y'all were just sitting on that shit huh?
Fun fact: it’s grammatically correct to use the word “sheeps” if you are talking about more than one variety. Same applies to “fishes,” etc.
interesting, is there a comprehensive article I can read? also I assume this is just a temporary slap down and things will blow over in a little bit?
 Beans and rice after a 50% drawdown
If I were in the same situation again I probably would have made the same decision. Theta was too high and this event came out of no where.
New vaccine tomorrow with 99.99999% effectiveness ... CCL 40
Buy calls around 190, puts at 220.
How many TSLA calls are you buying tomorrow
Why the fuck is futures still down. Will Europoors push this higher or lower?
No, you should believe a random retard on reddit who thinks the risk of getting covid is 0,43%

Why would SPY approach 370 when it needs to dump billions in stocks to create room to bring TSLA in at number 10 holding, paying a huge premium for tsla and shedding stocks which will cause a fire sale and lose them money???

>But let’s dive a little deeper. Based on this trial, there is a 0.44% chance to contract COVID-19 without the vaccine, and a 0.046% chance to contract COVID-19 with the vaccine.

Pretty sure this part isn’t right. IIRC, these trials considered a ‘case’ to be someone symptomatic. Surprisingly they weren’t doing weekly testing or anything; just waiting for infection and symptoms. So your “% chance to catch covid” may be excluding asymptomatic people. 

Also, 9 (or maybe 11?) severe cases were observed in the placebo group and none in the vaccine group. So even if the covid continues circulating, a drastic reduction in hospitalization and/or severe outcomes  will end this thing just as well.
Glad I sold my TSLA 400p 11/20 before close.
Ultimate cuckening
Earnings will be awesome. Guaranteed.

But it’s already priced for perfection. It needs to deliver perfection + significant upside guidance that surprises the market for it to rally after the earnings release. 

My guess. It will deliver great numbers but it won’t move up much after earnings.

jpow going to make my calls nut prematurely
This comment will age like a fine wine and I can’t wait to come back to it
Hope so! Wild card is definitely numbers could change for the worse between now and then. Right now though things are good .
lol one more time
I feel like the best thing to do is look back on the day and see if you traded right based on that day’s charts. After that check back on the week. Did you make the right play for the day even if you didn’t make the right play overall? If so, that’s livable. Try to check and see if you bought into a head fake and learn from your mistakes to become a better trader in the future.
Just put on WSB synth while you fuck her. Get your stock news and bust a nut at the same time.

premium weeklies as in for selling weekly covered calls? I don't see that great of a premium. $52 is around $200 bucks and I think a good earnings could hit $52 and get assigned.
Damn, sorry to hear that. I will say never trust Chinese Companies but same happening with others as well.🤡
TSLA
500c ???
Of course man. I like taking peoples money. But it’s no fun clapping noobs 😂👌

Can’t wait for mango to be potus for another 4 years woooooooooo get cucked once again libs
I may have worded my comment wrong but what I meant was XPEV is up 35% this week and NIO is only up 7%
Regarding your Rnaught... what equation are you using to calculate that? Doubling time-based, SEIR-based, other? Because I know that R values can vary depending on how they’re calculated. Population density and ADCs also play huge roles in what Rnaught actually is. In a closed system it can remain constant, but the real world is far from a closed system lol. Appreciate your insights.
Why
Good luck on this tomorrow morning, I decided not to hold calls through earnings. Regardless, if this tanks or skyrockets again, il be buying in!
Sign me up for the $100 pls. The student loans aren't even covering my school costs much less my options plays.

Honestly no idea lol but it'd be after the S&P hype buying
Yeah right now its way easier to ride the hype train of the day than to try calling the top, no matter the sector
its kinda fucked but i'm glad a bunch of people will get the vaccine before me so i can see what happens
I think it’s odd that people here assume that the MRNA vaccine news will fade the market like PFE’s did.

It won’t...because now there are two companies with plausible paths to a vaccine, which means the markets will not sell off this time since it’s twice as likely that one will offer relief. And, if two companies have already produced vaccines, it’s even more likely that three, four, and five+ companies will as well. It’s proven that more than one person can crack the code, you see. 

Now value stocks will get propped up like a mofo and SPY will approach $370 this week and the next.

I’m closely watching NCLH, RKT, GME, BABA, JD, CGC, SDC. Those are all over the place but I can assure you that the travel and retail industries will be propped up now with higher lows...for the foreseeable future.

I also just placed a huge buy with 10% of my net worth on AMWL because it should be a $15b company, not $5b
He spoke stupid and made a big boo boo but they love Jackie Ma. He forgot where he was and made a mistake. They gotta fuck him for a minute to remind everyone that even the biggest boy can get taken down a peg and then everything will return to normal. They want Ant to go through too they're gonna make a fucking fortune for the government.

At least I think so. They could shoot themselves in the fucking foot but it would be fantastically insane. Ma is China's poster child entrepreneur.

It depends bc every state has different rules regarding the election. Electors are actually who elect the president not individual voters. It's not totalitarian just really complicated. Trump doesn't have the influence to effect the SC decisions. Could go either way. The SC is probably the most powerful branch in a lot of ways but also the most independent of politics. They don't bend to Congress or the administration given the political climate.

Bottom line tho it's the uncertainty that'll effect the markets and yes they can reverse electoral votes. But so can Congress after the electors vote.

Markets wanted a Biden win and republican Senate. It's the best case scenario for them. Trump has been a wild card since 2016 bc you really never know what he's gonna do. Biden is docile and pliable compared to that. He's a glad hander. Trump is unreliable bc he doesn't really give a shit.
You love to see out

The moment of realization when close friends want to know your opinion on certain tickers cause you are up to date on the news and know which stocks are hot in which sectors but what they don't know is low key you're down 80% on your all time charts 🤡
Yup, and it can happen anytime between noon and 3:50 PM. If you call them and complain they will usually refund the fee the first time or two. But Then they usually put a 0 DTE restriction on your account. Downfalls of a boomer brokerage. Benefit is great customer service and you go to the front of the line for immediate fills.
Ha. Love the spirit. You're just about 6-months late!

If it’s 100% effective that means those people can no longer get infected. This means that whereas as before a person would infect two people, assuming half the population is vaccinated, then one of those two people is immune. This means that R drops by the same percentage of population that is vaccinated.

Tesla is taking GM’s place in the SP5hunny
Last time a big company/firm was added to the S&P was in 2010 with Berkshire.  While the stock soared \~25% (lots of dips inbetween) from the inclusion announcement til when it was fully added to the index, there was a big dip in the S&P for about 2 weeks before recovering.  Will the history repeat itself?

He said all Chinese banks suck bc they don't lend to poor people. You need to be rich and have collateral to get a loan. Exactly what Ant Financial is combating.

You’re kidding right? Ma talked trash about China.

How did the s&p go up more this year than last year 😂

As of now most museums and attractions have timed entry tickets to keep people from overcrowding but you can still go. 

General vibe on the street is positive, outdoor dining and bars honestly make things more fun at least when there is good weather. Things do close early (10) because of regulations, but it’s also getting dark and cold early so it doesn’t feel as weird as it would in the summer. 

Walk around Greenwich village, Lower East Side, Williamsburg on a weekend... tons of people out, wearing masks. There are outdoor dance parties in the parks, people out drinking abd smoking in the parks. 

It’s a more positive vibe than I’ve seen in New York in years. 

Probably will have to shut down at some point this winter but with the spring having been so bad here, people are ready to do what they need to do to keep that from happening again here.

That day I bought two shares sold at 450 feeling like a genius...

Yeah I was just joking, my timing definitely looks sus though
I’m saying unless there’s a massive short squeeze you’re gonna lose money buying in the am unless you’re adept at options trading intraday. Would be better to buy puts in the event of a short squeeze. S&P inclusions 99% pop immediately and then fade off hype. The safer play here is to buy credit spreads but that’s also a little more advanced and you’d need to know when to buy and at what strikes to not just lose all your money. Long story short better to stay away and enjoy the show.

Lol. So wrong
Europoors gonna clean house.
Well, when you bought the shares was it because you thought it was a great company that would do well in the long run or was it for a relatively short swing trade? If it was the latter, then you probably would want to exit the trade soon then. If you like NIO long-term then I'd probably let it ride. If the shares drop (hopefully not too much) then I'd sell more covered calls. If it pops then I'd get assigned and wheel it. I guess it depends on why you bought the shares in the first place.  If the shares drop too much then I'd wait for them to bounce back a bit before selling more covered calls. I think I might be a retard though, so take my advice with a grain of salt.

Okok but how do we know its 95% affective if 95% of people have no symptoms.
TSLA gonna do that thing where it moons 20%, then 10%, then 10%.
Are there any stocks with small enough volume that if we all came together as one we could move?
70c is still cheap too
Jokes on you, I'm into that
If Cohen had the shares he would not be submitting a letter. There would be no need.

He is building shareholder support and attempting to damage any positive management sentiment in the process.
they are both shit
Super hot take!
Hey my wife's boyfriend said it was a gift for taking care of all his kids.
Buy puts then, ez money
I got calls 11/20 and I’m buying leaps on the next dip couple bucks here and there
Imagine not being in on NIO
Mhh so this post stays up and mine gets removed? Yeah this place is officially a joke
Thank you! I’ve been watching YouTube videos trying to understand. I guess I’m confused as to why a call would be better than just buying a share EXCEPT that it’s less risky in case the shares lose value. Is that the main benefit? That you don’t have to lose money buying a share because you can purchase a call and if it doesn’t hit then you just lose the premium?

For example, I bought a share at $409 today. If somebody bought a 1 x 450c on 11/20 then am I in a better position? Or do you make more money on a call if the market goes above 450.
I just want to say thank you to all the hard-working autists here. Without our obscenely large volume of OTM call options, the financial markets surely would have crumbled in the face of the wildly out-of-control global pandemic. Your sacrifices, along with those of the SoftBank directors board, have truly saved this nation. I hope that while you sleep soundly in your Uhaul boxes tonight, that you reflect on the tremendous debt that this nation owes you.
Lol

I always make massive gains, and people always say. "Cold, what is your secret?" I tell them i jerk off to hentai before I start trading. Use that post nut clarity to guide my way
I dunno I saw the puts were deep af this week I thought it would tank tank but it seems to be okay for now

My biggest position is in QQQJ 35C 06/2021. 8X potential from current price when it goes ITM. Avoids big tech related headwinds, hedged with cyclicals, suffers from low volume. CNBC also loves to shill it.

bruh plz donate to my tuition just a couple grand sir
Yes they do, but you risk their janky policies and staff randomly liquidating your options mid afternoon on expiry instead of letting them expire and them charging you a ridiculous fee
I was trying to find stock with this shit a year ago. Any ideas.
They’ll skyrocket at market open
If I wasn’t a cheap piece of shit I’d give you Reddit gold
Shouldn’t be as high as it is
You wish! its full if red bean paste.
Yeah, an ITM call would be considered an investment. Only degenerate gamblers up in this bitch so OTM calls is how roll!
I’m not sure. All I know is they sold even though it’s going up. Make of that what you will.

If R0 is 1.2-2, and half of people take a drug that means they can’t catch the virus (95% is about 100%), R0 would be half of what it was previously (i.e. 0.6-1).  He’s just dividing in half.

I’m a pharmacist. We got a corporate-wide email today at work that “phase 1” vaccine will be available in mid-December but probably not given in our pharmacies (most likely special clinics and hospitals for the high-risk/frontline workers). The “phase 2” will be given in our pharmacies and will be in January. These will all be given at no charge. I do not know the names of the companies. I’d guess phase 1 is Pfizer and phase 2 is Moderna and whoever else, but that’s conjecture.

Refiners stocks have done better than anything else in the last 6 trading days, like 40% up, and they have an ungodly amount of bullish options being bought on them. I posted elsewhere but call volume today was in the 100’s of thousands to virtually no put volume. Flipping puts after big days might not be a bad idea but energy will be ripping the through December broadly speaking

The fact that SPY was only kind of up today on what was supposed to be huge news on the vaccine and relatively low volume is pretty telling. Or it could just be a slight green in preparation for the rocket to 400 eow. No one really knows in this retard market.

Sounds like time to BTFD
I think your numbers are off and your positions are super fucking GAY
it feels like years since tech has had a solid face ripper green. this boomer shit has gotta go. i'd rather buy puts than buy calls on oil stocks and CVS. fuck CVS, place sucks dick. I use to work there in high school and all the employees would steal so much shit
Im predicting price surge before it happens. I did it past two weeks with pdd and sq. Dont buy. Miss out. Ive got plenty more.
Yeah but options gains have made me numb to the money that working regular jobs/internships during semesters have been making me so far. Gonna have to stop trading when I start working FT soon for compliance.
I spent 4 hours Sunday night studying different option strats and mapping out different plays for the week based on different setups.

Gonna just scrap all that shit and yeet into TSLA monthly tomorrow
Don't forget about your stepchild NKLA. $30 EOW

Holy fuck $450 Tesla calls expiring this week are too cheap. Instant 10 bagger at open
Imagine going to work everyday with a balding boss watching over your desk like a hawk telling you you’re a loser while Buffet makes your entire family’s life worth by the time he moves his finger up his nose to find a booger and then tastes it to determine if today is a good day to get a sausage McMuffin or egg McMuffin.

It’s cool to help out fam. But it’d be more help to invest that shit and take out 1-2% a year to send them on Christmas or something 😂 you understand you’re about to print enough money at open that someone who knows what they’re doing could retire on that and make more money on that money.

Sign me up and if I win, I'll put it all on wayyyy OTM 1DTE TSLA calls
I still can’t believe I canceled my limit order to buy Tesla shares at 350 back in March the day it hit 350
Right, I could do weekly covered calls. But don't want TSLA be 105% of my portfolio, so need to trim some time soon and the next few weeks might be it.
I have Jan 2023 calls and they are down 32%.. Thinking of averaging down
Safe plays are conacophillips or Pioneer.  I like to live dangerously so my main oil is Oxy.  Much higher risk, but much higher reward.
These red futures are just vaccine epicenter stocks going down right, not tech...right?
xom best tech stock.
I sold a $480 11/20 covered call a couple weeks ago. The premium will probably skyrocket so I’ll just ride it out for the week and see if I get assigned.
Sometimes I question how stupid I could be for buying baba 12/4 260c. But then I realize I'm a prodigy for buying Tesla 405c 12/4
Bro don’t just through out a great reset theory and not explain
Tsla dumping at open?
Where did you set your stop?
Never too far as a capital raise might temporarily kill short term calls.
You might’ve just saved he day, cheers brother
I don’t either. I just like commenting stupid shit

What's really going to happen is Ackman will pick a solid name brand that everyone knows, like his Burger King spac, and all of you hype fuckheads will be disappointed and flee, dropping the price for no reason.  The reasonable investors will sit on the position and make a 75-100% profit over the course of the next 3-9 months as the stable but boring company finds its market value.  See Utz for reference.

ALL viruses mutate to be less deadly. Covid19 being deadly is basically a black swan event. The virus has no brain, evolution moves toward surviving. Infecting without killing is paramount, therefore all viruses mutate to become less deadly over generations. The spanish flu mutated itself out of existence so much so that it's most likely a regular flu now.

You can trade ES on day trade margins with some brokers, a few only need 600 in margin.  That's 1k if ES goes up 20 points with only 600 in margin.  CME doesn't have pdt rules either
Smallpox vaccine was also only 90% effective. How's smallpox doing these days? Their numbers are way off. If Pfizer is 90% effective and Moderna is 94.5% effective it doesn't drop the deaths from 2% to 1%. It's stopping 90+% of the people from getting it. So going from 100% to less than 10% changes things. Then those less than 10% have to interact with the other less than 10% to spread it. This makes the spreading much more difficult for the virus.
"So you have a 95% effective drug, and half of people take it. The R0 is now 0.6-1.. odds-on that the virus dies off and it's back to normal life."

Show the math behind this statement or you're posting absolute bullshit.

Still a lot we don’t know. Agree the market is getting giddy. Puts might be profitable at some point. Not yet possible to know if vaccine will be approved by fda, but would agree odds are that enough information may not be available and would not be surprised if that’s the conclusion the fda comes to
Am I supposed to be making moves everyday? I guess we don’t go long here
If you dremel and clean up the internals, they aren't too terrible. Finicky about ammo though. Look up the "torture test hipoint vs glock", it's surprising. A used S&W SDVE is basically a glock clone in the $250 range.

You're clearly not familiar with snallcaps because this exact phrase can be found all but verbatim in the fins of every small cap. In fact I would defy you to find a smallcap qhose fins don't have that clause (and if you its a lack of diligence on their part). It's financial ass-covering, just like when IBM or whatever boomer stock lists all the potential risks in their fins

Not saying that including a boilerplate clause means CBAT is a solid company. But using that clause as something to point to as a mark of a bad company is laughable

Why is relative risk reduction invalid? It tells you what % less likely you are to get the disease as compared to the unvaccinated population. That's what you want to know. They use the relative risk reduction because it's unethical to intentionally expose people to the disease. 

Suppose you had a vaccine that worked perfectly - everyone who took it was totally immune forever. If you measure by relative risk reduction, the result will always come out to 100%, because it's 100% effective. If you use absolute risk reduction like you propose, the result you will get will depend on how many unvaccinated people got sick (which depends on how you do the study for). If you run for a week and 1% of unvaccinated people get sick, by your math the vaccine reduces your risk by '1%'. If you run for a year and now 50% of the unvaccinated people got sick, is the drug somehow now more effective? 

Think about it - even if nobody who got the vaccine got sick during the trial, what would your NNT number come out to? 1/0.0044 = 227, which means by your (wrong) math, you would need 2.7 billion doses to save everyone who died in the US. 

Your number of 257 is the net number to treat to have a positive outcome on one patient **within the first week** (duration of the data collection per your post). NNT values are time specific, which you would know if you were a PharmD (or if you had read the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_treat)). So the number of vaccinations you came up with is the number to save 240,000 PER WEEK. Of course it's a ridiculously high number, because there aren't that many people dying of COVID per week, so you set an impossible goal. 

This is literally why people use the relative risk reduction - because it isn't sensitive to how long your test is (aside from from the standard deviation / error which goes down over time).

Sure, we need to see how long the immunity lasts for, but the picture you are painting is nonsense. Good luck selling those puts!
For all .00286% of you

My dad gave me $1m this year when he sold his apartment in China that 10x’ed. The rest of the money is mine. I own and run my own M&A investment banking boutique with 14 employees. I sell private businesses like a real estate broker but instead of selling houses, I sell companies. I make 4-6% per deal and I get paid a monthly retainer like a lawyer does.

Yes. There was good dd on here posted a while ago on tsla showing different IV %changes on price vs time. Especially on otm contracts. Let's say you bought at open 460, tesla dipped to 420s then near eod hit back 460, you may have lost liie 5-10%. Look at Vega and implied volatility.
Congrats man.

No, the point I was making was that the vaccine isn’t really as effective as it’s hyped up to be. PFE saying that it’s 90% effective, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to prevent 90% of deaths. To prevent 90% of deaths in the US, we have to vaccinate 2.7 billion people, which is impossible since there are only 325 million people living here.

I spent two years loosing money in my day trade account. Researched companies. Bought what I thought were good investments. First major loss was CEI. Then my next one was safe stores. One went tits up and the other one may as well have. Then I found NIO options 😍😍

No seriously though I've 10x my account in 5 weeks since I started options. Studied how to use them over the past two years. finally saw some fucking autist at my work doing them and I as like "what am I waiting for?"

Yeah, "side effects". I bet. Do we know what's really in the vaccine?

Oh as usual I have to cram study immediate events. So what's up with the indicies that track the S&P? Do they have to instantly readjust or is it over time?

Shouldn't matter to DIS.  They're not expecting to reopen this year because the county they're in (Orange County) is currently stuck as red tier (COVID spread).  They can only reopen when their county gets down to yellow tier.

If anything - the lockdown should help bring Orange County down to yellow tier and allow them to reopen.

realistically you gotta play around with long call calculator

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com

to see what the highest return could be on spy 380

also if your guy charges a fee per option trade or anything like that, could make sense to buy spx 3800 calls or whatever instead. they are more expensive so less fees. fees can kill ya

but the liquidity isn't great compared to SPY so you have to be real careful especially with going OTM above 380 on spx

medium term trends don’t look that great for Airbnb imo. even if urban stays come back there’s such a shortage of housing now that has driven prices up I doubt the economics of buying a few houses to put up for rent make sense anymore. plus affordable housing is now going to be a much more heavily scrutinized issue and don’t think Airbnb is going to win a lot of friends in places are that both expensive and have high housing costs.

Cities will also crack down on short term rentals through their zoning codes, not only because neighbors already hate AirBnBs and they impact property values, but now also for the point you raised where people will say they are a vector for disease spread.
I’ll give you my DD.
I met Elon at a grocery store years ago. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
Don't say that  wtf why

If you keep saying they have had no vaccine on the market then you’ll never make money. There has never been COVID-19, and they been in research for over a decade leading them up to this point to be ready to get their chance to show off. This is how medicine works. The media sucked you into thinking it’s fast tracked and skipping safety data. Not true. They have tons of experience and data from MERS/SARS which also have spike proteins that cause infection (mutation doesn’t matter since the spike doesn’t mutate). The fact that Moderna has NIH scientists on their team, they are the ones who know most about coronaviruses. Manufacturing takes place after a vaccine is approved normally but they are doing it simultaneously as its being studied. Moderna specifically has more data than you think and mrna vaccines is more safe than you think. It’s not a dna vaccine(which has been proven to be safe) doesn’t risk being embedded into our dna. After it’s used up it gets degraded and nothing happens. Only a MRNA vaccine can be done this fast or a inactive rhinovirus backbone since they know it’s history of being safe. Only a mrna vaccine can be mass produced this quickly since it’s easier than dna. Don’t forget the United States is #1 in biotech/medicine and it’s not even close! we should believe in our science.

It might be believed by retards, they can’t just buy shares whenever they want they have to file for it long in advance like the S&P just did. They’re stopped from buying so they can’t control when the news is released to pump and dump the stock. Thank your gubbermint for that protection

In WHAT though. I just need someone to tell me what to throw my fucking money at
Elon once rescued me. I was late for work one day and was driving recklessly. I was fearful of being fired you see so I kept swerving around trying to stay ahead of the flow of traffic. I eventually lost control and my car began to spin and slam over the edge of a bridge. 

From hundreds of feet up I could see water approaching fast. I closed my eyes and accepted death. That's when the car stopped. An armored Tesla suit had caught my vehicle. I couldn't believe it. It dropped me off back safely.

The suit of armor was just about to take off when I had to know who it was. I asked "Could I at least know my savior?"

Thats when the suit's helmet flipped up, revealing Elon Musk and his not exactly rugged but handsome face. I immediately climaxed but I had to keep my cool. He kissed me on the cheek and said. "Godspeed".

I never saw him again.

Tsla Calls at 9:30am or 9:31am?
[deleted]
Yes. There was good dd on here posted a while ago on tsla showing different IV %changes on price vs time. Especially on otm contracts. Let's say you bought at open 460, tesla dipped to 420s then near eod hit back 460, you may have lost liie 5-10%. Look at Vega and implied volatility.
That will buy you one call with a 3% chance of profit. Good luck.
Hey, everyone is entitled to lose their money how they see fit
What you’re not accounting for is disease prevalence. 

absolute  risk reduction will go up as disease prevalence increases. 

Since you can’t induce controlled exposure (at least not ethically) in a vaccine trial, you have to make do with incidence in inoculated population vs incidence in placebo population. 

The incidence of 94 cases in 43k+ subjects is too low to measure anything but relative risk reduction. 


Long story short. Correct, relative risk reduction is not an ideal way of measuring efficacy.

But. It doesn’t mean it’s NOT 90% effective. 

Your entire argument supposed the disease prevalence never gets higher than 94/43000 people. 

And considering that as of last week, about 1 in every 378 people in US have tested positive....it’s already higher than that...

It took S&P CEO months to get over Musk calling him a peeedo guy and walking out after they offered inclusion the 1st time in August.

It's talking about how that university's Alumni helped the recent SpaceX/NASA launch...with most of those Alumni being NASA employees who did SpaceX's certification.

Neither does this prove they helped SpaceX technically ( does the person grading a Test help take the test ) nor that SpaceX employees are ex-NASA.

I may just be another retard here, but I don't have too many people to turn to. I can't just open up to people about my fear of existence, but if someone's a dick here I can just ignore it. I appreciate all of your advice and can't wait to dig into these books.

You just suggested shorting the market. This doesn’t work.
Same idk whether to sell market open or hold until eow
That just means s/he bought 10x 500c (c = call, meaning you think it will go up) expiring on 12/4/20. If it goes in the money (ITM), then s/he could exercise those contracts for 100 shares per contract at $500 a share. S/he likely will be selling this for the increase in premium on that contract rather than exercising it. Let me know if you have any other questions.
Great posting man. I'm still long because market sentiment is too bullish but I agree that these trial results are not as dramatic as media makes it out to be. They don't even know how long the vaccine is effective which is a huge, crucial question.
