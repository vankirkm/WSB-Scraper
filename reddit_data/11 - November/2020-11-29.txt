Turning autistic rants into money
BC money here in on PLTR at 26.77 🤤
Low ass volume. Never a good sign. Thats all
Wait what? So you’re saying that since the consensus is more bearish as a whole, that makes PLTR bearish and GME bullish?
[removed]
bro, can i not get banned anymore, please? like at least give this slut some goddam flair >:(
They already did
And what if I give proof? Trust me... by banning me... it’s you guys who lose. I am just getting started. You have no idea what I bring to the table.

Nice! Me too

Very good
The idiotic part is not putting it all in GME. Much better upside.
Medical rights in the case of an incapacitated spouse, rights to property after death, insurable interest that is necessary for purchase of valid life insurance policies, legal protections for joint assets, legal protections for shared children, and sometimes a tax break.

*Oh, and VA and SS benefits carried over to a spouse after death, as well as some pensions.
Send me a DM if looking for help still
Can’t imagine

I did a limit price order and I had no idea what the fuck I was doing I thought the orders would execute at 27.96 but stock quickly jumped to around 28.30.. I might be boned someone tell me how much I fucked up I have 90 days for the orders to fill

in 10 years, you'll have left millions
On a fundamental basis 40-80 but if they get a tech multiple because they could get a much higher multiple
If/when the squeeze happens they could push to unprecedented heights because they have the most short interest of any stock to date so nobody really knows but a push to 500+ while sounding absurd (and is absurd) could shortly happen but the fall down would be equally fast and hard to time
exponential fuck shit always good pls trust not funny but live hahaha LIVE

Are you a retard? Who told you I sold a single share?
Also, it's possible that people who want to sell stock will do through a block trade with institutional investors which shouldn't affect price.
The Aark bags I've been holding have started to get lighter. 12/18 110c....bought at 106 weeks ago 😐
No but I like theta gang
Get a bitch
It’s probably all these people who spent the Obama years hoarding gold because they thought he was a Muslim socialist who was going to destroy America and physical gold was going to be the only currency left.

Now it’s been 4 years since he was in office, the country is still going strong and most of them are unemployed or underemployed because of the pandemic, and watching the price of their gold start to fall, and thinking it might be time to get my money out so I can buy groceries and pay the rent.
Get short call LEAPs for the short squeeze🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡

LOL imagine thinking PLTR and GME are not apart of the stock market
I just had a post autoremoved in this thread.

Guess I should have added more rocketship emojis
What did I miss lol
[removed]
And maybe they’re not girls after all
GME, myovant, apple leaps, baba puts, selling moderna puts for premium.
Think APHA 12/11 9c are going to print?
>Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 also happens the same day the so-called “quadruple witching” takes place. Every last Friday of the quarter marks the day when futures and options expire at the same time, which increases the volume.
This, investors say, might help with the liquidity that day but may also increase market volatility.  

Lots of words to say 800c. You heard it here first.
Premiums too high for me personally
Yea, and they cleaned up, a lot. Nice.

Thx mods, y'all still kinda gay, but in a good i-keep-my-shit-real-clean kinda gay now.

I bought PLTR at 10.70 and sold at 31 and change.  How much did I just leave on the table?

🌈🐻
i think the gold money all moved to the coinshit
Sector rotation into Tesla tomorrow. A red opening would be a blessing to pick up some more calls. Fuckers need to know we got big news for indice buying in the next few days
People tryna drop PLTR price to get in while simultaneously trying to pump some other stock because they know PLTR is the real deal. Same deal that shitron does
What GME leaps should I grab. Or is it a short play
People freaking out about a -0.5% decline in futures lol
Enough ppl realizing the short squeeze on GME is pretty ripe. It’s been hyped since March? But the catalysts are afoot!
 if they somehow get stripe then everyone in this thread is a fucking millionaire
Spy still at 362....what y’all tripping for?
DXY failed its attempt to break above 91.725, the previous 2-year low. Futures will be green by open
Again, what’s your proof?
Shit, It happened I almost was about to flip out.
I’m talking about PLTR and GME dumbfuck
Lol pics or it never happened
Your assuming the people posting that were drilling tomorrow actually know what they’re talking about...
17.7m shares vs 1.2b what am I missing
I would like to speak with the stonks manager.
Seems like they are up to some fuckery
Why do I feel like if Liquidated every call and share I have and put it in all in 2023 ARKK leaps i’d be rich
Dude thats fucking with the world markets. Not funny.
[deleted]
My calls would like that
Mine goes green up slowly but I also want to see PLTR die because so fucking tired of hearing about that stonk.  I want it to hurt so bad these people never think about owning it again and never mention it again.
[removed]
back in your stink cave
You mean a job?
Yes, definitely different then. There can be protections for assets shielded by a corporation, within a trust, or family assets that were inherited- that's generally how a prenup would help someone in the US. There can also be guidelines included for automatically raising alimony, outside of standard alimony considerations. Sort of like "if you marry me knowing I make nothing but my family is wealthy, I will give you 20k annual in almony for every year over 5 years that we are married." They're great for unusual situations. But typically all property owned before the marriage stays with the purchases upon divorce, unless a portion of debt was paid off during the course of the marriage. So if John bought a 500k home and still owed 200k on it when he got married to cher, when they divorced Cher would own 100k of the home.

Yea but the drops can make you a years salary in 10 minutes
I might just avoid looking at the price for a week. Could be volatile.
Incase this place goes private im starting a new sub called "ifibrowsehereisuckmanydickseveryday" so search for that if it ever happens.

I got out second it hit $30 bought my shares for 21 so made a nice little return on it.
Most likely red open for us tomorrow as well. But it’s not a 100% indicator

Imo you should maybe add the first mention? That way you can see the gain from the first mention to current market.

It’ll be bought from Friday’s dip

I have 3 letters for the SEC the second letter is Elon’s
0% chance your PLTR weekly calls come anywhere near break even.
FYI, since 1896, the DOW has been green 7/10 days, I like my odds buying & holding long term.
If wsb gets banned there will be no reason to visit reddit.
Still buying puts tomorrow most likely
[deleted]
They’re gonna bang for sure
why not?

Think SPY puts 11/30 358 are gonna print, or is it just going to continue going up?
I bought in around the same price. I'm planning on holding, but I'll be setting my stop loss tomorrow.
Schwab doesn’t do PM until 7:00AM ET
First thing I’m doing doing tomorrow is selling my Baba calls and buying more PLTR calls and puts on everything else
This is almost as horrible as being the person who bought all of my dad’s shares at $4+. He said he invested my net worth into it at .65 and closed his positions at $4.
I hope so but 600 was rejected 4 times on Friday. There might be a few days of sell-off before it starts to climb again.
Do you feel lonely are are you content with solace?

Gonna donate to some stuff and buy people close to be some dope gifts if APHA doubles from here. Please WSB make it happen

Lots of retarded words. I’m all in
But literally no news came out on either ends. Sure futures are down but last red day PLTR went up 20%...

I dont check this during the weekend normally. I save the weekend for poker. Lost my all in and came here for the shits. The mods were giving bans for saying the former presidents name so I dont question everything they do.

Buy stocks for the short squeeze, not options

Umm. Its not a good stock
Most western countries are like this, but shit changes dramatically once kids are involved. Splitting assists between adults is one thing but splitting between an adult and a now single parent + kids + the responsibility of now being the sole carer changes it a lot. 

Also if you earn a bit more and save while your partner earns less and spends, your gonna lose half your savings while gaining very little from them.

RIOT should come back from last Friday's dip
Yes. SPY will drop about 1-1.5%. Tuesday and Wednesday will be red as well but we might get a decent pump back into the high 350's-360 into Thursday-Friday. December will be red af.
It will probably be worthless.  I'm holding 30c 12/4
I'm hoping for on a 50% hit in the am

what did i say my man
Absolutely, love selling CC...mainly FDs so I don’t get called away 😂
rest of it is Eurofags and SJW, its a cesspool out there
Yeah. Like I said it can be played for sure. But there is a relative incentive to hold through the merger compared to any other vehicle of this kind. I shouldn't have said disincentive.

I think depending on the target announcement, the obvious play would be to hold to get the warrants though. I'm not sure they are priced in, at least not in any conventional sense, given the 2/9 is a worst case scenario. But yeah, if I am holding this at $24 and Stripe is announced 60 days pre merger and the stock jumps to $40 on announcement, I would not be selling that news. This isn't conventional.
He got in at $4. I mean, I would take some off the table

Know what else looks juicy? The commodities.
Yes market I need you to open rn, nobody can wait until tomorrow
It’s not going to print tomorrow because it is too far dated and otm to do anything on a -.5% day
You’ll make like $15 maybe

Same. I have 24c’s I made loooong ago. My shit prints either way 🤷‍♂️ but above 30 will for sure make me the most happy
They like buying SPY but not QQQ 🤔
Just because I prefer lady boys doesnt mean I'm not a good trader!!
Proof or ban
VXX is my best friend. Let's do it. 35c 1/15 gonna print.
They’re trying to make you sell don’t fall for it
Red for a week and then big whales will jump in.
Yeah i have a guitar, started learning, stopped after a week. Gotta be more consistent

12/18 exp, your gucci my man. these will print easy
I have $80k of shares in GME, PLTR and TSLA. Might buy a GME call at open if I'm feeling horny.
Its ok rocky, you go when you feel like it
WTF was that ?
Online blackjack too easy. You just never lose
So... Are axe and Wendy ever gonna fuck or is a platonic relationship really possible?
Exactly people keep making fun of them but they don’t realize they are a gold mine. Just do literally the opposite of everything they tell you and you have a 90% of being pretty damn set.
Nio has a strong resistance. I really don’t see it dipping below $50 again so if you’re holding shares it’s not that big of deal. Plus with Nio day next month I think end of December it pumps again
Some dude has a $150 dollar call option by end of December? Who has balls that big?
It's making gold look dumb.
Green all day long.

This website is already fucked dude
I know at least one of you tards went over to r/investing after this became private and commented “good evening gentleman I am new here. I have left meme stocks and came to chase 7-10% average gains in broad index funds. I am open to any ideas.”
I hope they stay around and keep us informed on their positions. Makes it easy for us retards to do the opposite and go long😭
It really is, no wonder people lose money
How do you sell calls? Kinda new to this, bought 40 shares when it dropped a little on Friday
Why do you think market is going to tank tomorrow?
The INO projection was correct
I’m guessing not, since the EXP is still several weeks out.. even now..
that was
Probably because it was up like 0.5% at opening.

Used webull for some time now. Can confirm there are retards who would draw shit with crayons and said something like “to the moon” or “dip hard” with 3 rocket emojis and some popular tickers at the end. Like bitch this aint your instagram bullshit
You must be new here.

Shitposting is kept to a maximum only on the weekends.

Damn. Those are big, bold leaps.

Your wish is granted. Except we just red at open and green EOD
Bro, this is a classic example of a bad play.  You need to sell this asap because Tesla will not hit 930 by 12/18 no matter what, as amazing as they are. And as a tip, the strike price and expiration of any option are actually important! They need to be realistic if you want to reduce your risk and make profit in the future.
Yeah that’s not a lot, talk to me when we are at 2%
Absolutely.

Actually they were 24/25.5 I could've cashed out at 28% only two days after opening the spread but decided to hold on. I was confident I'd max out my $3500 credit. VXX never went above 24 since then. One of the few times when diamond-handing did fuck me lol.

Futures red but, ELON IS OUR SAVIOR
Sure, that makes total sense if you want to own it at all post-merger. It just doesn’t really disincentivize buying pre-announcement and selling on the post-announcement spike and moving on to the next play, as far as I can tell; the warrant rights would just be built into the price of the stock. Although at some point pre-merger it needs to be sold to a long-term investor in order to maximize that value, which likely accomplishes the goal of the structure.
It’s not a definite thing, but they likely shorted at a very shitty price and are underwater. 18 would be a price for them to cover due to them losing so much money at that price point, and I’m pretty sure there are set rules for institutions on when they have to sell a position, like it depends on they’re risk tolerance pretty much
[removed]
Yeah we saw it too. Discords all lit up about it.
What makes you think I am half out? Bet you won’t find very many ppl on this 1MM+ sub who can buy pre-IPO. And Palantir isn’t my only pre-IPO buy. First one was Facebook in 2009 and last one was SpaceX. Also bought Tesla at IPO.
Damn do we need a...a.... A backup WSB 😳😳😳
Seriously.  Like why did every fucking government declare war against this company right after every fucking analyst say it was a “must buy”?  They must be shorting it.

Yes! You get the premium from the sale, much lower risk than just a naked call or put. But if the shares hit the strike price the call can be exercised and you might be forced to sell the shares.
What was
You missed the link to ur crystal ball
My prediction is that PLTR is going to rocket tomorrow, but the second it hits 34, all these paper handed pussies are going to sell and it'll drop again before close. 

As long as it closes above 30, I'll be happy.

IDK man, to be honest i have been expecting a red day for weeks now and it just keep surprising me! Either way, this is one of the stocks i’m confident on long-term. It doesn’t matter much when u get in, in my opinion you’ll profit either way! 

If tomorrow’s red then buy the dip, if tomorrow’s green then this stock doesn’t know when to quit so buy either way
Where did you hear that? Every post is marked nsfw from what I'm seeing

IMO Webull is the best for beginners.   To me RH is crap and earlier this year it stalled and failed multiple times. Once costing me over a grand. Start on Webull for 6months to a year and try some other brokers in the meantime. I like the speed with ally and the interface is simple if your not a pro trader

It's like that. 0-day FDs that are voided if the underlying asset crosses a certain price.

 “The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable.”
https://www.barchart.com/story/news/710750/uk-stocks-up-on-vaccines-hopes-to-start-virus-shots-in-days
One could buy now, sell on the announcement, and by again on a dip before the merger to capture warrants. Are you sure there will be a dip though? That's what makes tontine unique.
I’d keep trading the million. Even if I only make 10% a year (which is extremely conservative) that would still be $100k a year before taxes which would be twice what I need for my budget. I didn’t mean I’d really retire. Just that I wouldn’t work a 9-5 anymore and spend more time with my family.
Reeeeee don't make this sub private ever again

Why the fuck is the sub going private
ah. well the answer to that is to maximize profits on a higher strike betting on a short term breakout while the march is i guess my ‘safe’ contracts.

na, it was so trash before seeing 100 PLTR posts in a row
Sorry. I'm just saying that once you are a shareholder, you are incentivized to keep holding the share through the merger in order to capture the warrants. 

I think Ackman here likes how this structure leads to less fluctuation in the stock. People who buy are likely to stay in for at least a year, compared to the pump and dump cycles witnessed with other SPACs.
Aborting my pltr calls for the time being.. gme gang for the time being.. watching pltr gonna jump in fast

Yes... I do angel invest but this was a private secondary transaction.
I believe the earliest you can cash in the warrants is July 2021 with a 30 day window from the merger date. Commons you can do whatever with post merger but you only get those warrants if you have common when the ticker changes. Even if your time horizon is a year, chances are okay you can redeem it all then. Late 2020 announcement and merger in Q1-Q2 gives a few months of growth before warrant cash in, if you like. Warrants don't expire for 5 years though and most who get them will appreciate the utility in holding for 3-5 years, regardless of what the target is.

 I feel you, I used to work retail, or in group oriented jobs and it sucked ass. Now I work at a mine in a mineral processing plant and it kicks ass. I show up, we have a morning meeting, and then I'm off to run whatever part of the plant is mine for the day. Some days I'm running a loader or a dump truck, or some days I'm by myself just running my part of the plant. It's great when your success is dependent on some nitwit pulling his head out of his ass and finding the work ethic he has been missing since birth.

I did a bunch of crayon drawing that told me PLTR -3.5% for today. I don't put much stock in it, but makes sense to me

If a budget isn't passed then the government will shutdown and federal employees won't be able to work until a budget is passed, it's happened a few times before. 

For COVID lockdowns though, I don't think the president can implement *full* shutdowns. But there are measures they can take that would have a huge effect on the country, like closing borders, airports, interstate highways, etc. There might also be a loophole the president could use to force lockdowns by declaring a federal state of emergency but I'm not too sure.

My biggest gainers were DKNG NKLA  and GME. I  got into draftkings and nikola early before they merged. I’m a swing trader. I’ve gotten lucky along with  this market having the best comeback of all time has helped. I’ve learned a lot this year
Lot of drag queens too..
Oh shit,  I spelled it wrong
Mods need to lock this sub for a couple months
I'm long FROG shares. Makes no sense to me the beating it's taken. NRR fell from like 139 to 136% and you'd think it was the end of the company. Jesus christ it's going to fluctuate, it's still industry leading.

COVID is messing up the top line for some of these companies. Contrary to popular belief COVID is not supercharging every cloud name. FROG is very good at what they do but it *can* be put off if budgets are tight enough. However, with the vaccine coming online in 2021 this looks bright and COVID woes will go away.

I like FROG and SUMO. Personally I think SUMO has more moonshot potential. When you comp SUMO to Splunk it's ridiculous.
Wait then how is it a disincentive to sell after the announcement but before the merger, if my buyer still receives the associated warrant rights?
It's at 372 as of now. With all the news, I don't see it green
I have to remind myself that when my alarm clock goes off I have to wake up and go to work because I can’t be in the car when the market opens

Is the US really different than Canada; Canada, all assets owned by a party before a marriage (with the exception of a marital home) are naturally shielded from any claim from the other party of the marriage.

Parties can only claim 50% of assets gained during the marriage; except when a prenup is signed and overrides this.
Got in above 51 and I feel like tomorrow will be red. Should be good in the long run tho
Agreed re: upside comment. 

Regarding selling puts, let us say hypothetically the Stripe is confirmed, then there is no way I would get to own the shares correct?(Edit: because the price probably won't get to the strike price) In such a case, a 5% swing in cost basis should not make much difference. Shouldn't I rather pay the 5% difference knowing the risk might be worth it ?
Future catalysts for people interested: 

December: Mexico legalization vote in the lower house/president (Senate passed), UN Decriminalization in December.

Longterm: NY & Connecticut wants to stop being boners and possibly legalize.
Colombia Marijuana debates for legalization. Israel planned legalization within 9 months. If UN decriminalizes, this will be sent to EU to consider.

I’d like to point that it is NOT a US legalization vote. It’s a vote for decriminalization.

Right now, it's hard to say, but I'm thinking any retracement wont be as severe as in the past since shares are being locked up by institutions ahead of and after S&P 500 inclusion. I think it's likely Tesla will break 600 this week and any dip could be into the 500s, but I would be surprised to see 400s again.
What do you think is there a difference between the words “shithead" and “piece of shit”?
I wonder if my puts are gonna make more money than what I’m going to lose on my calls tomorrow 

Probably not
If BABA is down 3% in HK right now does that mean it will open down 3% in our market?

No, not really.

Few on SPY, few on PLTR. Nothing crazy.

Pre-IPO? You work there or something?
Yes i think we do 😁
13F doesn’t disclose option positions.  He either took profits or sold shares and bought options.  He’s also posted on Twitter about amazon failing to deliver consoles by Xmas.  He’s jacked to the tits in GME.

How does that work? $15 when you deposit cash and then $45 when you take any out, and then $1 per options purchase? Sounds pretty reasonable?

You think Tesla is going down... haha
Not even close, man. 

As far as I can see, next stop for IWM is $177.
That’s what they do literally every weekend
You got a shit ton of puts don’t you
Can’t afford anything more than that I’m assuming?

Couple strategies to try. First, put separation between yourself and your feelings. Step back and label your negative emotions. Understand malicious lies are a reflection of the person spreading them and not you. Focus on things that are going well for you or bring you some moments of happiness. Once your head is a little more clear, think about the big picture and what strategies you could take to work through this issue. Focus on the longer-term. Yes, this is right in front of you and interfering with something you really want right now, but expand your scope and think about more than this moment in time. Play the long game. Try to practice some empathy toward your ex and possibly consider responding. I get it, you probably fucking hate her at the moment for spreading malicious shit and fucking with your relationships, but if you're better able to understand where she's coming from, you may be able to respond in a way that could turn into a real resolution.
Don't you have to have enough capital to actually buy the 100 shares? Or does the broker just do that for you?
I’m saying tell it to your shrink. Also, fuck your stock

Thanks for the response, it’s quite an interesting thing! Becoming basically rich overnight. I know you said you live frugally and are buying up real estate but are there other things you want pursue now, like flying around the world or buying a yacht or something? Idk what I would even do with that money.

I was searching all of reddit by new and I stumbled across a post someone made to their own profile. [/u/APXTAvePoint](https://www.reddit.com/u/APXTAvePoint) 

They spammed to buy ____ because they were from the future and you're welcome for the free money. 

They didn't know how to post to reddit because they posted this to their own profile like 12 times. I found this to be the bullish indicator I needed. 

In for 100 shares (I am poor) at $11.52 current price before premarket $15.27

Edit: people are saying I was clearly being sarcastic. I wasn't. My portfolio that day was 100% in the stock that shall not be named and currently it is 75% of my portfolio because I deposited more cash and bought some pltr calls

Look, I'm a PLTR bull but I have to agree. These are low quality posts and deserved to be removed.
So as long as you buy pre-merger you get the warrants? And if I sell pre-merger the buyer gets my warrants? So the “long term hold” incentive doesn’t start until the merger happens?

Sorry, just want to make sure I understand the “long term hold incentive” part of this correctly.

Their margins are better than Amazon/Walmart because GameStop has stingier return policy from what I read. This makes retailers more likely to give them a higher % of the inventory to make more profit.
I want you to print, but retracment is definitely coming so have a tight stop loss.

The application is a real long as fuck application too lol
No I mean QQQ has been literally flat for weeks look at futures it’s the only thing keeping it’s head above water spy puts are fine but QQQ puts is just a weird play
Futures keep testing the depths and quickly realizing that they are in the Mariana Trench.
I once asked a guy when Nio was sub 18 how many puts he had since he was bashing it. He said "0" since he was too smart to get involved with it. Majority of people on here sit on the sidelines and spew nonsense but don't actually have any positions.
Not enough lulz
You maybe onto something. I made a nice trade on TWLO after hearing them on NPR for a week straight.

You can sell 26x weekly calls against your shares. Sell them way OTM. You could collect $2000 per week for a $10-$12 OTM call, and you don’t even have to hope PLTR moons. Use the premium to get more shares.

I’ve been watching that one for a while. Friday was a good day for SOL. Buying shares then LEAP’s when IV chills out.
Goodman. Glad to hear. Keep being smart. If you’re young, you can make the rest of your life a lot easier, if you don’t get greedy/blow your money. Hire a financial advisor if you feel like you don’t know how to handle a lot of money. Congrats bro.

Everyone is bearish af right now because futures are red like calm down children
I bought one share on Friday, probably not going to make much but I gotta ride the hype train somehow.
Dude you’re still broke 😂
Holding PLTR shares strong tmw. What’s the next play to get into?
What service or product would an online version of GameStop provide that the console makers aren’t providing themselves through their own devices? 

I understand the riding the hype train for quick gains; I just don’t understand holding GME as a long term investment. Their business model is dead and they don’t actually provide anything other than physical space to buy/sell a physical version of a product that is increasingly digital and unlikely to be sold by GameStop online in volume sufficient to carry the company. 

I don’t get it.
Needed to get more adderall
I dunno if it'll disappear but the media narrative will definitely change. Right now COVID is just another thing they can use to complain about Trump but once their own guy is in office they'll need to be more optimistic or risk making him look bad.

Buy stocks you want to own, not what everyone tells you to own. I try to buy companies that seem like a good company and product
What is your expected upside? 

Since this is mostly shares, why would I not buy at $25 price right now rather than sell puts that might or might not get assigned ?

If I do buy at $25, my downside is limited right ? Sorry if this is a retard question

Low quality
Please don't.
You can always sell calls against the ones you have to lock in gains think its called a vertical spread to be specific depending on when the 45 and 35 expire you might want to secure gains on them especially if they expire relatively soon. Not sure about pltr I actually bought some puts in it and its the first time in that stock for me

You’re the fool, overbought is just another word for trending up quickly.  Undersold means trending down quickly.  A year long bull market can stay in overbought territory the whole time and you would be selling it down because it’s “overbought”.
Is it wrong that I liked this thread before heavy automod?  I liked buying things based on "XYZ 🚀".  Now I feel like these posts are the equivalent of trying to hit a word count limit on a book report based solely on watching the movie, rather than me taking a chance on a guy's idea bc his balls felt funny.

How’s that going to happen exactly
It's not a meme.

And remember, it's all about perception. Even if GME was just an imaginary company, if everyone believed its value should be higher, the value would go higher.
Looks like fear/greed pullback started early
pure cope sorry about your calls
Which one?
AMAZON FUCKING NEEDS TO TURN INTO LITTLE BABY SHARES SO BABY STREET BETS CAN GET IN ON THEM
Just trade it, might as well lose money while you stare at futures.
With a black guy playing him with a white face on.
Calling for a pullback is a good hedge. You can be right and still lose money at the casino.
it can def hit 600-1000 I believe
I have my stop set for 21. Hopefully we don't see it again, but locking in mild gains if we do

Pretty sure it’s a sign of weakness
I hope for your sake, but you won't be able to if that's the plan. People were buying a lot of shit on Friday and barely anyone has puts out there. If I could control the market I would dump all over the FOMOers and retail idiots and then pick up the pieces. They will FOMO right back in when we start mooning again.

If we do open dark red, I'll look to unload my puts around 1130-1 and start buying

fuck good to see the rare bull amongst the orgy of gay bears. These retards think red futures will lead to every stock being red
You can only purchase shares?
Is it me or does this thread seem more...on edge than usual?  Holidays must've really stressed ya'll out.

Any other margin calls that make sense?
Yep.   I put g r w g n and got 'low quality'
Bro I’ll die if that’s the case
future is red will our stock go up tomorrow? what ya think???
Everyone remember the last time you sold too early and then watched that stock explode. My last one was PENN. Bought at 8 and sold at 15. Now it’s at 70+..

Let PLTR be the one you trusted and stayed with!!

You are literally fine.. we are sitting where we were Friday morning.
That was in response to your “limit down” comment, and even then, I STILL said they don’t matter. Go read the comment again. 

Also, we’ve had, what, 8 straight green days now? Even if we have a major correction, calls are still vomit green. If you’ve been shorting this market you took a fat L.

To hit it big, remember the 80/20 rule of stock investing.  If you want to invest $80 into the stock market, you can earn it by giving 20 blowies at any neighborhood Wendy's location.
Checking futures is an addiction
Can't use that margin on options
what is the performance of this portfolio over time?
No, you're a fool. It tells you the market is overbought and ready for pullback/correction.
Childcare? She did way more to the company than baby sitting for the founder of Amazon
Yeah same as vxx just 1.5x leveraged
I’m a noob but just based off their past performance each time a PlayStation console was released their stock went way up. Ofc there’s more in depth info about new leadership and the direction their trying to take the company in the future. Also MSFT deal

Hope so, I have calls expiring this week that I might roll out
I know. Can't wait to see what NIO does.
Will tomorrow bears could finally afford some honey?
Does anyone else give advice and but also not follow it? I've been calling a pull back for this week and yet here I am stuck in calls.
All the new members of this sub are about to find out why its called WsBets, betting means risk of losing and oh boy, there is going to be alota losses tomorrow

Ayyy bro I appreciate the honesty I was just concerned because I saw more people complaining about it idrc that much.
The fact that everyone here thinks the markets going to be dumping tomorrow, means we'll be up 5% easy
Futures PSA: Unless it's 1% or more, you can safely ignore.
Well congrats and fuck you.

Next couple of days I think. Over $50 by the EOY.

My post, which I spent a good half an hour writing, just got deleted. I actually put time and effort into that. This is some bullshit.
green monday, flat week. slow bleed into mid december because of budget negotiations that could lead to a government shutdown. but electoral college votes on 12/14 so once Biden is 100% officially the president-elect then the market will be green all the way until he implements nationwide shutdowns. 


pltr is its own market though so tendies for everyone.
excited for tomorrow. the market is the only thing I actually look forward to on week days
Who cares! New blood in the game. We don't need boomers talking about how everything has gone to shit. We already knew that!

Takes a certain type of angry sad fuck.
Fucking hell of course I have puts that expire tomorrow and not a few days out.
Futures down... Nothing an early morning vaccine announcement can’t fix.... bears are fawked
Get high, to get high returns yeah the math makes sense
Except for TSLA that’s gonna go to the moon baby!

Fellow palantir long investors, do not give into the 🌈🐻s, remember why you bought in the first place and hold. If you bought FDs you’re an idiot and idk what to tell you
80% weeklies and 20% 0DTE?
That’s the point I’m trying to make. We have not had a proper red day since that first vaccine (Pfizer) announcement
I do, do you?  The fear and greed index just tells you the markets trending up.  Any minor drop will be quickly bought back up.
It’s dumb any tickers not PLTR or TSLA or NIO get dogged and removed too
Are we trusting that weed stocks run this week based on legalization voting? If so, ACB moon due to supply
not unless you know exactly what you are doing.
I'll save you some more embarassment. TSLA just had a stock split my guy.

That was the greenest of green hulk pp that day
Tomorrow is earnings. It’s probably going to be volatile

Idk my theory on Friday was that a lot of big money doesn't bother trading last week (see low volume on almost everything). Retailers ran up prices and I couldn't imagine the returning traders being excited to buy at highs. Dump and force the paper hands out then pounce on the dip and begin the next rally.

Sounded really good in my head and I'm positioned exactly for it, so there's no way it works. Either way, my calls aren't being sold.

A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected.

It’s only gambling if you’re not making money. I made enough in the last 2 weeks to pay off my student loans so keep it up, they seem big, but in this bill market and the right plays, you’ll be there in no time. Buy some shares to hold long term and as a store of money so you don’t lose it all on options. Just buy options close to the money, and over 1 month out at minimum. Take profits frequently.

Mr Powell I don't feel so good
The stock that seems to benefit the most on red days is ZM. The only time it dips is when someone whispers "Vaccine..." and then it takes a nosedive
Because I needed to destroy so many accounts based on my bad takes.
Good Luck. I’d suggest selling all those PLTR contracts and buying some with a lower strike. It’s possible they will all print by Friday, but your return will not be significantly higher than if you just had $30 calls.

Bulls, obviously.
MB (guy from big short) got in on it. Console sales have them at 780 million value or something. Apparently new heads of GME are strong bets and the restructuring of their company has people antsy. 

I don't know the route they will take to get more money. Any Eshops for games already hog the market. Maybe they'll be a vr hang out. Who knows.
Probably not, but it wouldn’t affect me too negatively so it’d really just be an opportunity. To squander.
What’s a good expiration date for gme? I’m currently looking at 1/15/21 just because of how much open interest there is. Or should I look further out to sometime in April?

Why do companies subject their employees to embarrassing group experiences like this?   I would never want to work for a company that did this.
The federal reserve act would need to be amended. Not happening.
thats not enough to trigger a short squeezer it might go up 5% tho why not
Nobody cares buddy

Why with PLTR. You can do that with GME.

that’s what i’m wondering
Dont understand what u mean. Depends on what data u extracted. For me, post title, contents and comments are def regex searchable
I was asking about the strike price not the price of the option...
I'm consumed by worrying about money. I worry about money more now than when I had nothing. When you have nothing then you have nothing to lose.

I'm at a weird point in my life where I don't have enough to retire, but I still have more than most. I don't want to get back to the point where I have nothing. So I'm forced to keep my job because I don't want to start eating into my saved money.

Wow what a revolutionary bear thesis. Hurry and buy puts!
I believe under custom options on the all in one trade window you can. I also use SSE and actually am really loving it.

RH is garbage.

Those strikes it's showing at a penny don't have a bid.

The other ones I think it's showing bid/ask midpoints.

Don't trade options on RH.  This interface is totally insufficient for doing anything.

The spreads are large enough that you need to see both the bid and ask.  And a "Last Trade" that's more than a few hours old could be totally worthless.  There's no volume on any of those strikes.

A mixture of both their current auditor (i.e. PCAOB-approved audit firms like PwC), or whether or not they are state-owned, or not. For e.g. BABA is non-state owned, and has a PCAOB-approved audit firm (though the PCAOB has been unable to audit PwC China due to Chinese government disapproval).
WOW we drillin now correction was a little overdue to be honest
Hope it stays that way I wrote weeklie calls friday and bought weekly puts 😋
I have everything you mentioned down...but what happens at the expiration date?

Example: 

12/4 35call purchased today, 11/29/2020 while stock @ 27.66. On 12/4/2020 it hits $39. (You're effectively guessing and paying money assuming the stock will hit above $35, and it does)

What happens? You get the *option* to buy the stock at that price? Or you can sell the option?

I always hear "An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity (but not obligation) to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset.

(You seem helpful. Ignore if you want. 'In the Money' dude on YT has a one hour+ video and I had to stop before he got to the end of 'calls')
[removed]
Because you’re using CFDs
UVXY was great but contango took it over. VIX is the only good volatility play rn
My bad. Dec 4 calls at open. Get in, get out.
If you think we'll open red tomorrow you are a fool.

🦨💨🐻
Me too, bigly
!remind me in 1 month
Calls on life alert 🚨
NIO
Stfu pussy bitch
[removed]
If PLTR hits $22 I’m buying in with everything I have STAMP BET ON IT, ITS LIT! 🔥 🔥 🔥
So I have about 2 calls on PLTR and 3 calls on NIO ..should I sell ? Should I buy puts? What do you guys think
You do know that Palantir was a direct listing? If he (and others) didn't sell their shares there would be no shares to buy. 

An IPO is different because new shares are created.
shares/options
So why are people saying GME will become a meme stock?
If it's red tomorrow I'm buying calls, if it's red Tuesday. I'm buying more  calls

It’s not. Easier to justify our YOLOs.
I've realized the reason so many of us lose money is because we have no position/bankroll management. When those old decrepit cucks at r/investing said small position sizing is key they were actually right! Those senile cunts actually gave some decent advise. Who woulda thunk it.

See they do this shit cause the company is 99% new college grads that are excited for their first job. Those are the type of girls to get excited about dressing up for work and doing things like company softball to network but they haven’t quite found themselves yet. Eventually they realize that they just throw bodies at contracts until they get worked to the bone and find out why the turnover rate is so high

Silver gang in 2 weeks is our time to rise
How are you not in on gme yet?
They don't need to pump it. Shorts from the squeeze last Thursday have to cover by Friday. It won't go to 20+ but 17-18 is easily possible before the end of the week.
Yours and his both feel like they have kind of different goals, but I feel like yours would accomplish its goal a lot better if you had it standardized by buying 10k worth of stock or something per mention or as close as you can to it with rounding. Look at how unfair GME and ZM are with mentions versus investment. All we need is a few mentions of BRK.A and nothing else will be overpowered completely. The other thing I'd consider is to maybe also weight the investment amount relative to market cap so that you don't have wild penny stocks being the main thing that move it, but that's more optional depending on what you want to go for.
Futures are shitting the bed dude, calls are fucked. Buy puts at open and ride it down. Probably on Tuesday or Wednesday we push up again

I put in the order, will be official at open.
Thoughts on buying puts or shorting?  Anyone that confident it will dump. 

I have some Dec Calls $420 I am selling tomorrow up 53% in a couple days. Maybe hold one as a lotto ticket as I have 5. Will depend how tomorrow goes. If it is a big up day of like 5%+ i will sell all.  If it is flat i will probably sell 4 and hold one as it may jump a little based on good ER.

Luck, yes.  Balls, absolutely.  Conviction, tons of it.  A lot of pussies would cash out @ $1M.  The fact that you took another 10X+ is ballsy and has secured your future.  Congrats and also *fuck you*
It will go down but not when u have puts only calls
Because most people on here have calls expiring tomorrow

You have such a way with words
It goes a little something like this:

When you have $8M to gamble with you have more than $8M and you can still live really fucking well if you lose half of it. 

If you’re gambling with $100 that might be grocery money.
I'm 20 so I will end up going 'all in' on one stock for the foreseeable future. Right now I'm 100% in Cruise lines and have to hold until May if I want to be taxed less -- I'll be worth 100k if Carnival crosses 32 (21.5 now), which I don't think is too unreasonable if there is a lot of recovery hype and a travel surge.
Because while the news is kind of old, the vote happens this week and then it's on Trump's desk to actually become a law. I'm thinking there might be more media attention on the whole thing too then. Hopefully not. I have 12/18 calls lol

Awww man all this time I thought PLTR was the hottest thing in town. Time to pull-out and wait for it to turn 18.
Why are people crying about futures when SP is barely down and Nasdick is flat?
Same. Turned 25k into 7.5k, worked it back up to 46k.

Even Trump catching covid didn’t dump futures if I remember
Anyone care to be Google and explain futures?
the guy who owns chewy (huge ass online pet store) crushes it for online shopping. Gamestop is hoping he can take their boomer blockbuster model and pivot accordingly. That type of shift in strategy takes a long time to implement as it requires them to increase their online marketing channels. Their site traffic was 14mil in beginning of yearr and now its att 12mil. its a sinking ship, long term.
if you had to go all in on 1 stock for the next year what would it be?

What are we thinking about PLTR tomorrow
Someone doesn’t realize tomorrow is always up Monday. Holiday week throwing it off. It will be corrected by morning when we get more vaccine news, fed talks, and great strides on more stimulus
Melvin Capital is one of the most successful long/short equity hedge fund launches in the last 7-8 years. They’ve crushed performance ever year and that’s caused assets to balloon to $13bn+. Gabe Plotkin is a shark. Not saying he’s right on GME or that the position isn’t causing pain, who knows what the actual p&l is, but just saying that these guys are legit and one of the best equity hedge funds. They won’t get margin called ever, and the position is fairly small compared to their gross exposure.
bloody Monday, good thing PLTR doesn’t abide by the rules
Hows the GM?
I know who to vote for next time
Haha right. Almost like we’ve been green and hitting all time highs the entire month of November while there’s a pandemic worsening. Literally so many people are over leveraged right now

*narrator: but he did*
Yeah absolutely true. Nio and probably all the other major chinese companies trading in america do use auditors but the Chinese government doesn't let the auditors share information with us regulators because of state secrets or whatever. I hope for the sake of my calls that this isn't a big deal and will get sorted out without scares of nio being delisted
The Sunday gap open higher on s&p500 futures usually gap and go, or have been since JP told the world om 60 Minutes he prints it digitally (P.S. He also showed his ass. "The Fed Put" is at 2850). Tonight it gapped and crapped. Something is very different.
Makes it harder to close your positions, like a shotgun of calls then have to manually enter to sell at bid price lol
Yes but why would it tank them this week if they have 3 years to comply
so yeah we are drilling by the way
Yeah, I realized that about a half hour ago. Planning to sell puts in the AM.
What calls are you holding
Both of the contracts I mentioned cost less than 3k
In PLTR since $9.76 and some of the biggest face-ripper green days have been when market was red.

Hoping it tanks so I can buy calls!!!
You have to sign up for their cash management account. 0.3% APY. It makes sense if you want to use it as your main checking account.
Lol NIO is going to at least +5% today check the news
They're 48 billion now, insane! Its funny, this sub was convinced fair value for the stock when it was 9 a share. Now that its 30, it is criminally undervalued

My boss got 14000 shares this past week and insisted I play it too.. hope he’s right
Sorry, I meant millimeters.  Metric system is just so much easier to understand.
But it’s Monday?? This doesn’t make any sense
If you really want to own shares you can sell 30 puts
Damn, Biden twisting his ankle really fucked the markets up
Literally the dumbest argument I’ve ever heard.
You should use some of that money to have some WSB Zeppelins do fly overs in each state capital, trailing banners that say “Jim Kramer suck my dick”
Still a solid company. Believe it or not, young humans still want to have a brick and mortar place to buy things. Plus, the trade in rewards keep people coming back. They literally take broken shit for points. Started as a short play, but since it's going to survive, could lead to massive squeeze. Even if it doesn't squeeze, solid gains are possible. Been holding since it was sub-$10. Basically goes up $1/week
Very true, but retracement is coming my friend. Soon, very soon. Make your money and SELL. Don't get caught in retracement.

I was selling puts hoping I will get assigned on shares below $250 cost basis but it would always bounce from $250 really fast. 

I should have just bought shares, premiums are fairly nice and the stock is expensive so 100 shares is a reasonable long term hold. I got AMD which also is a solid ghetto dividend stock.
I don't feel so good Mr. Futures............
we are actually getting a red monday.. unbelievable
Do your own DD or get PP in butt
I think the pltr holders feel threatened and are fighting tooth and nail to stop money shifting to the next thing. Every gme post and thread gets down voted and then people rage about pltr.  Sure, the company could go up some more, but eventually momentum ends. Even nio has slowed down substantially now

I’m sure even those would have been ok if you diamond handed.
Why?
Slv goes by industrial demand a lot too so its more sensitive to sudden downturns if that is what is going on.
So close to buying puts but i thought don’t fight the trend damm
Aroon and Accumulation/Distribution, if you look from Sept to now (basically ever since vaccine positivity) Aroon up has not held near hundred levels and Acc has remained flat...but price shows going up still meaning the trend is not strong. Makes more sense if you compare the indicators for the bull run from after carsh in March to before Sept. Non-technical factors-rising cases,rising unemployment,rising default in loan payments. My 2 cents.
Sometimes being slightly less fuk is the best you can hope for

But by adding in about $200 and moving it around now it’s March 2021 44c.

Because Gamma. Basically if you had 100k spread in 100 60+ dte calls you'd get a lot of +10 baggers as well as those that didn't actually go to zero because you sell at 20 dte only taking slight theta. Sharp events abounding you're likely to receive sweet drift tendies.

it’s like 4 in the morning in europe
it's important for the folks hoping to "hit" big that you stick to your convictions. Think about all the other subreddits on here and how often you read the comments thinking, "these dudes are absolute fucking morons they don't know what they're talking about".

Now look here. Do you think this is a unique special part of reddit where those idiots no longer exist? Nope. They're all still here, making statements that are false to push their preferred narrative.

Remember why you bought your call/put/shares in the first place. Do not let the weaponized autism here fake you out of your position, no matter what that position may be.
It can be stressful. As cliche as it sounds I’d say “ knowing what I own” and following through with my original plan helps me hold on big down days. Also playing simple percents and averages. Most of the big downs come off of gains so it makes it easier to hold once you’re up.
bruh you later

Yeah. It's just a short peak season. November to Christmas. I got into stocks so that I never have to consider doing stuff like this again. Plus, I always excelled at anything with numbers, patterns, and formulas, so I figured I'd try it out. I heard the tendies were better than working.

My parents have put a lot of care into their financial situation over the years (sounds a lot like yours) - have you found it weird you don't REALLY need to care about money that much? It is a blessing I could go broke and be taken care of, but it makes me rethink what I want to do with my life, since so many other young folk are (rightly) concerned about their financial future.

Covered calls on BABA have been one of my most profitable positions. BABA always goes up. But it also always goes down. My calls always get blown way the fuck out before coming back to earth.

No problem. I don’t know if you’ve traded SPAC warrants before, but keep in mind the warrants can be called early. It’s normally if the stock price is above $18 for 30 days after the merger.

Who is screaming in the background?
You know there's legitimate fraud right? Why would he not call out actual fraud? Data anomalies, hundreds of affidavits affirming people running polling places broke the law, republicans  watching the votes being thrown out of buildings, in GA 100k people didn't put their address as anything, the dominion vice president saying he would rig the election in a tweet from half a year ago, people burning trump ballots on camera, counties refusing to allow recount audits despite trump being allowed to do so under the constitution and just now a judge almost forced dominion to wipe their servers for no reason but then immediately reversed that decision. In fact you clearly don't even understand how the EC works, trump can actually still win via faithless electors or just PA legislature not certifying causing a legislature state by state win.
Same as the US, not moving.

Duh, dude, buying ACB is literally throwing money in the garbage. APHA is undervalued, just compare with CGC

I think that's what I'm going to do as well. I have shares also.
PLTR:

Monday there will be a short buy-the-dip pump and then the FOMOers will dump because losing sleep.

People are going to buy that dip and the underlying will rise again.

boomer sad make short squeeze rocket. hope that helped.
I might not even try to offload my BABA calls. Might need to remember the feeling of watching them tank so I'm more careful next time.
Yup. You do want to have some cushion above the 25K in case the market drops a few percentages. 30K would be ideal to weather a bit.
It's pretty cool hey! But I still love yours just as much and we need to encourage more of this sort of thing and creativity so that the content increases!! Good job, I honestly would have no idea where to start in creating what you have.
This is the way.

Monday and Tuesday are financial community events. NVDA always popped during those.

Plus, GeForce RTX 3060 Ti was listed in UK for sale starting 2nd December, but this might be priced in.

I’m really banking on the webcasts tomorrow and day after to pop the stock. Lots of bullish calls for 590/600/610 over the next few weeks. I’ve got a 12/4 expiration though.

Reason for GME mooning ? I bought a call for this week because you retards were pumping it but I have no idea why it would go up
Don't need prayers for something you have confidence in
so baba puts at open will pay? you said iv high, but dont we got a sneak peak into its movement. even if iv is high if it moves down and i sell eod, thats free bread...
NIO probably dropping on open from this
how do you guys make a large order? say, $100k+

just a limit order? or do you have a special option with your brokerage?
I’ll show you some low balls

[deleted]
i just think it's undervalued and will take off at some point in the next few weeks.
Be more attractive
There's risk, as with everything.  In this strategy, risk would be defined by how much the underlying stock drops when you're assigned.  For instance; if TSLA drops to $400 and you're sitting with puts you sold at $550, then you now own the stock for $150 over asking price per share which sucks but hey, you own the shares now and you'll probably be fine.

Just research the stability of the stocks before you go pulling the trigger, make sure you understand the downside and are OK with it.

Well the ANT IPO was never going to be in Jan anyways so whatever you lost in IV it woulda happened a while back. Delta is more worrisome since BABA is down in HK.
What makes you think it will go up?
Maybe, I don’t know. Can you repeat the question?

STM or GME

Looking to January of ‘23 on the LEAPS for APHA. I am probably going to hold off on buying any shore or the LEAPS on APHA until after the Georgia Senate run-offs. I think the run-offs will be sit or both won by the Republicans which will reduce the chances of Federal legalization, but states could still legalize through the legislature or ballot initiatives. I’m honestly not familiar with IIPR.
Starting recently, I've been buying a share each time I get calls just to do a little of my part. The vast majority of my position is broken up into calls at the $10, $15, and $20 strikes for Jan 15 and Apr 16. I have about 20 calls expiring this week as well. Each week, I try and grab a few calls at 0.05 or less just in case we get the squeeze. On those I stay small. If I throw $100 or less at those each week, I can lose a lot of times and still come out very positive if we moon. The FDs have to be played small. 

GME is currently 70% of my portfolio, was 90% at one point but my other moves have been printing lol
Due diligence. It’s literally looking into the company. Or just buy whatever is hot on WSB and nut up.
Happy you bought? 😉
Probably like last Thursday but that’s in the past

The reason as far as I know is that they're under 1 bil market cap, which is against the sub rules. But that's only the SPAC market cap though, the merger is valuing at Microvast at >$2B so I'm not sure what the problem is.
The MM’s inverse WSB.

A lot of y’all are about to find out tomorrow
so buy stonks in apha?
Honestly, you might just be giving off super beta vibes. Are you texting her back too quickly? Are you consistently consoling her about issues with other men, but not getting your shot in? Are you talking to her passively in order to not offend her? Perhaps she doesnt find you attractive (no offense)l. If thats the case make it plain that you want her and if she rejects you move tf on.

Is there a term for the sweet spot when you should unload your calls for max gains before theta starts eat away? Does that make sense?
For real, what is the actual DD on GME.  Like how do they transition as gaming goes digital download
You can absolutely still get into PLTR. Every TA out there predicts massive run up. Plus, the company actually makes sense. Don’t second guess yourself.
[removed]
Down 3.4%
Let me borrow your axe bro I flamethrowered mine
So you're saying it will either go up, down, or sideways. Got it.
Y’all think BABA gon keep going down all week or is it up from tomorrow
Moderna. They will win the vaccine prize and the calls r expensive cuz everyone knows. Just buy the shares
Best advice ever. I tell my friends if you wanna learn options, you have to know investing and must have money in there so you have something to fall on if you fail. Lol
bought 100 more during the firesale, waiting for the morning bell to buy a handful of calls.
Because they were around 55–80 each
Can’t sell PLTR puts if it goes up
[removed]
If acb hits 20 and pltr hits 40, ill get pltr on my face!
Woof. Good thing I bought those shares in my gfs account and not mine. Someone remind me to buy flowers tomorrow.
Sept 29. This was priced in decades ago...
I can’t believe the people I trust with my organs are the same ones gambling far otm calls with me.
Possibly CCP-controlled, which would be against US law if this bill passes Congress...(it will)
Actually I think it is my best trade in terms of realized gains. The same day I sold I bought a 1/15/21 40c 🤡
Hopping into some 12/18 90s at open.
Not if you know how it moves and when to play it. Watch it.
If you’re still getting flagged for PDT and have to keep track of how many trades you’re making get tf off retard companies and start building your wealth. I understand that’s a hard concept to follow in a euphoric market.
I wud nut
In TSLA (hype) I believe
Godspeed my friend thank you very much my night has been made now
I work at the nasdaq and right now it’s literally $TSLA’s retard strength holding us up, can confirm
Bro, diversify into more pltr. What is this Corsair 🗑
sell calls next week to make some of that money back in case it continues to decline
I am god ... and I will grant you this one wish

Wait on PLTR just in case there’s a sell off tomorrow, you can get in cheaper
would you guys be interested in a WSB ETF? is that something you might be interested in?

[removed]
and you know what the real problem is?  people keep trying to say things are different in the auto business with these new companies and use completely inapplicable analogies of high margin business FROM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SECTORS and say things will be similar to this sector where they sell a completely different product with completely different needs with completely different legislation.  people are trying to shoehorn "tech" in every fucking which way into the CAR INDUSTRY.  it certainly will improve some things but it will improve things for cars as much as it has for shoes or soda or whatever physical consumer good that simply benefits from tech through distribution and is not itself tech.

Bought em at .03 before Biden’s unofficial win.
Can't tell until the chain is open in the morning. I'm probably going to grab a few at 3, 4, and 6 weeks out with a range on OTM calls. I think the hype might take more than a week to grow.
Well atleast we’re both fucked.
if RKT is under $20 tomorrow im loading up on december 21 calls.
I'm no a GME bear I just don't like the way the WSB whales are doing this shit and are distributing to the people who are late. Yeah it's how it works, but we are fucking our own now instead of getting fucked together. 



everyone tits deep in PLTR = late comers have to make their choices.



Now let's just have some of us cash out on PLTR to do GME, then we have the retards who went in PLTR late. 



Then these people who cash out will end up going in late for GME (well they could have profit), risk is there. 


Then those people still in PLTR will probably get stuck thanks to the people who decided they want a new toy. 


The cycle continues when a new ticker comes about next week. Pick anyone. Many of them from the past few months are holding fine at around 50% of the highs. Guess who provided the support.
You got it

Good perspective.  The China I see are poor people living in high rises, using public transportation, etc.  I don't get where these poor folks are going to get the $ to spend on a fancy EV.

As I always say, congrats if you made $.  Remember to lock in some profit if you haven't already.  I don't have a position, I just caution against blatant looking scams.
This was back in September bro, would it rlly affect the price at this point?
This is probably true
Someone bet 100k on the 🌈🐻s RIP
Don’t plan on it, I’ve been paying them off with my nice mediocre accounting job, but shits still a burden and if I don’t make realized tendie gain porn, I’ll be paying them off for years

Sounds like a bitch move. CRSR is a piggy bank that still hasn’t even cracked open yet.

Last 2 earnings stock has gone up ~30% week prior to earning and 12% / 22% respectively on day of release. I think that’s reasonable but would probably sell if a moderate/large pop tomorrow before earnings released

Only up like 22% lol hence why I said "gay diversified gains"

HBO is owned by time warner which is owned by ATT.  So yeah HBO max isn’t really going to cause it to dip, owning Directv on the other hand might make puts worthwhile.

That means something different than saying a stock is at the top. And yeah he should have bought months ago
$40? Gonna hit $50 again this week. Maybe even $60 if late week pump from Cyber Monday sales results look juicy enough.
Thank you. Been seeing everyone post about gme the last few days so I'm going to buy a bunch tomorrow. You trading options or just holding shares?

Soo grandpa warren dumped airlines during the sell off in Q1-Q2 only to moon later.  Then he dumped JPM & GS which are mooning now.  I’m hoping the same happens with GOLD, he dumped it last Q.

PLTR gang is fuc
it'll tank a tad more...people are antsy....I think most people are price targeting PLTR at 40....which is a problem....I personally think its more likely to hit 40 close to Q1 earnings when hype is much higher

I’m want to see Schwab put in personal rate of return. Once you add deposits, it’s a mess figuring out rate of return. All you get is starting and ending balance like chart above. 

Example, if I start at $1 and deposit $4999 the chart appears as if my return was 5000% even if it’s all in cash 🤔
A bit more in depth?! This is way more comprehensive! I really like this, thanks for sharing!

Doctors who work in a hospital have way more stress then nurses do in my opinion. They work longer hours and longer weeks and generally just have more stress then we do. Besides they go to school much longer and acquire much more debt in the process. If they work in a specialty other then general medicine they are probably on call meaning that they can get called into the hospital in the middle of the night or called by nurses at odd times. They have high divorce rates too. You couldn’t pay me enough to be a doctor. They are not comparable in my opinion
Best for eoy would most likely be pltr or gme bc squeeze is most likely to be sooner and ev will go up but not as wildly as the other two but best bet would be gme because earnings this week and they probably crushed it with console release and everything I can’t remember if it’s gonna be reported for the coming earning but the pre orders will be counted in pretty sure

Actually, if it goes up, you can convert an ITM option to OTM
Is it tho? I really don’t think it’s anywhere close
Thanks again, I’ll remember that. Just going into everything. Not throwing in more than 10% of my savings and it was a small call just to learn how it worked. Thanks for the tips

Don't even think about it. Seriously. You are loved and at the very least if somehow (probably impossible) that that's not true; you will one day be loved.
I am not 100% sure but I assume similar to call options before a stock split, they just get adjusted. In my understanding if you buy an expiry date you get that date. I think the ticker will just change.

Yes, I agree and do that sometimes as well.  Definitely a good strategy if you don’t think the underlying is going to shoot up.   Not sure I’d want to do that with something like PLTR though, as you’re limiting your upside.

We don’t know. No one has proof. Gay bears have no proof, it’s just usual shit talking.

Projecting much?
Why do we love ass so much? First a guy eating shit and now this? I’ll do U one better. If PLTR hits $60 EOW I’ll get the logo tatted on my dick
I will gladly say I can make trades like that after this squeeze, currently in $48k~
have enough cash for EOY one option of each... thinking of getting a position in PLTR, NIO, FSKR, and GME... Someone talk me in or out of them.   


Wish i could afford tesla positions but the only way i could do that would be by selling my shares, which will obviously never happen

No matter how much you learn, there are hundreds of thousands of millionaires/billionares who will always know more and be a couple steps ahead of you. You obviously have to know the basics but in the end, the only way amateur traders are going to make any money is with either luck or, most importantly, investing in proven blue blood companies and sitting like patience on a monument.
Fuck that nigga
Thanks (for all your DD too)

Sure thing, together monkee smart and all that retard bullshit. For real though, be careful buying calls too close to expiration unless they're ATM or close to it. The value of an option naturally declines as it gets closer to expiration (this is one of the Greek variables, known as Theta), if the underlying stock increases then that decay is less noticed. Look at the day gain % for PLTR calls for last week. Despite good growth of the underlying stock, options closer to expiry gained less than options further out. If you're new to this, I would definitely recommend not buying any calls shorter than 3 weeks out, so you can get an idea of how prices and performance of options is different to it's underlying stock.

Oh that makes sense. I just never have any that dip negative. All my options always just go up 😄😉
no, i think you misunderstood what I was focusing on.  the "past" or really I was referring to current performance had to do with you saying they aren't subject to many of the expenses or problems of "traditional" car manufacturers.  I was saying your not seeing the problems because of the pathetically small numbers of cars they're putting out.  and to justify that big valuation means they will at some point have to produce huge numbers of cars, like a million or more, and at that point you will see the problems set in.  no one does a million cars "on demand" and they will of course have all the warranty, recall, and repair problems.  who will service them?  you have to have dealerships.  even tesla does.  so you end up with inventory.
[deleted]
Oh trust me, I get all of that. “Put all your eggs in one basket, but watch over that basket.” I believe that was Carnegie.

Nursing is super stressful but we care for patients in a lot of ways without being overseen by a doctors and it’s a collaborative approach more then anything. Besides...

Mine are shares. However, instead of waiting I just put in an order to sell at market price at open tomorrow. Honestly, I don't have an idea of what I would wait *for* so I don't see a reason to stick with it.

Yeah you're right it looks like tradingview is giving me the wrong percentages. Looks like it opened right at $270.
I do look for companies that have catalysts. Example. I loved DraftKings as a company. I got in before the merger when it was traded as DEAC. I picked the date that was planned to change their name over to DKNG 2-3 months out and bought options 20-30% out of them money. So I use thoss types of percents but also use risk spreads. Pick a bulk position but then Open a smaller percent that’s more risky and another that’s less risky

Don’t they have longer schooling though? Idk shit about the medical field. I know as a nurse you can get into it after 4 years while as a doctor you have atleast 8 years of studying to do. Shit I could be wrong, I study computers for a living.

Recent news regarding PALANTIR:

PLTR ADDS $17 billion value in their best week since their IPO.

The COVID-19 vaccine distribution system is going to be operative on PALANTIR software, on top of this we already know that Palantir is developing software for the US Department of Defence.

This is a very undervalued stock relative to the benefits they can provide for companies. I think their flourishment in the public sector is yet to come. Especially in this age of big data!

What’s with all the GME pumping? It’s been basically the same short interest since April and there are new waves of posts every month saying “the squeeze is coming soon!” Same exact pumping last time it hit this price level and it then dumped back to $10. I have a few January 30c left just for the hell of it that I bought in August, but don’t be surprised if any type of major squeeze doesn’t happen until summer 2021. That being said, who the hell knows, maybe this is the time. No one knows in this market.

Great vintage. Human cask finished I believe?
Healthcare companies love hiring RNs for executive positions.  I know some RN MBAs that are pulling close to a mill a year.  There’s definitely upward mobility for those that are willing to work hard for it.
Best of luck!
All year long CPB has shifted within the same $8. If they jump it wont be high, and they wont be up long. You're gonna have to buy a lot of calls, and jump off at just the right time.
But HK doesn't trade in dollars so he isn't talking about HK, if it's trading 3.2% lower in HK, that would mean it's at $267ish on NYSE
me :(
That was like 5 days ago
Is it safe to assume based on HK. BABA will drop a good 3-4%(~$10+) in US?

Can some1 plz DM me the price pltr will close at thanks
just depends on your timing. I'm an investor with a $100+ price target by 2023. Buy this and any squeeze is secondary.

That said, no one truly knows how the price action will go.
All in affirm. Was just reading of idiots using affirm to buy $20 of candy because its only $6 every 2 weeks...
so much
Having a job is overrated and sucks ass
Would you make more than just regular contracts for the same move? I usually scalp /GC but there are times I'd like to hold for longer but holding /GC or any futures contracts is too scary for me and like you mentioned, the spreads I've seen kinda suck.
So much
Hahaha!! Classic!

thanks man hopefully I’m next up ! Be easy
Your price is too low. You're not going to fill.
/uj if options decay over time, I don’t know how this is true
Hahaha, damn those calls are actually really nice to swing, did not think they’d have that much premium, nice
Not what I’m saying at all.

You have NO idea how important nurses are.
That's incredible!

I'm going to guess your strategy - let me know if I'm too far off or if it's close enough:

1. Find stocks that are in momentum or have a catalyst
2. Risk 1-3% on each trade that is 3ish weeks out maybe? Let it run with no stop loss

Did I get it right?
>Ok did I miss something futures were up .58%, now at .18% what happened?

Yeah now they're down .29% at 20% retard

ur fkn retarded if u think nurses just work in the a doctors office or hospital. they probably have more options to move up than any other healthcare profession.
How much did all those contracts cost you?
Simply comparing GME to Blockbuster shows how lazy and retarded you are. That is like comparing Best Buy to Blockbuster simply because they sell things in a physical store that you can buy online... 

Plus, the balance sheets are much different. Blockbuster was balls deep in debt and burning cash. GME is cash flow positive and has enough cash to pay the debt.
yea that’s risky, if Tesla is flat or red any day, you’d be fucked, but if it keeps going next week, which I actually think it will, you might be good, good luck!

Gaming will eventually replace most sports. Its on the way there, but its a few decades off being a main form of entertainment for the majority of the population. Itll get there though, already passed things like basketball and baseball.

GME is pivoting away from game sales being their primary income source. Think best buy but with a gaming focus. They're involved in esports and community gaming stuff, but it is still in its early stages. The new mgt team was only in place about 8 months before covid hit.


Comparing the two companies is silly. Im not shitting on pltr. I just don't see it going to 150 billion this year and trading at 90. I do see gme going to 51 and trading at 3 bill, even if its temporary
Well, I meant the re-incorporation strategy that they will announce (i.e. all this month, half this month, half next quarter, etc.).
I just realized, who TF has sex with shades on?

in my mind I think SP500 should naturally dip slightly to generate the liquidity to buy Tesla rather than cash on the side to buy Tesla

555 billion (tesla mkt cap)/23 trillion (sp500 mkt cap) = 2.4% (amortized over the time since announcement to inclusion)

but this seems too straightforward to be true
Don’t sell. I mean you’ve made good profits but it’s gonna hit 35-40 by 12/4 so I’d hold
yes.
All in

PLTR
Puts scare me because of losing more than you put in as a potential risk, and I don’t understand how to make money with theta but I might look into it once the semester is over. Not playing with student loans but papers with overlapping deadlines go brrrr just as much as the printers for TSLA and PLTR for the people here lol
[deleted]
your only post about gme is from 1 day ago..... wtf did u call
Can’t tell with the Covid
fake news
Was that your call?
-3.2% isn't $260...
Bro fr wsb gonna become shit if it keeps up
Actually, yes.
Only if you buy them back.  If you're "Wheeling" then your intention is to be assigned but at a lower price.  When you sell a put, you are credited with the price of the option contract you sell.  

So if tomorrow at open, you decide that TSLA is a stock you're willing to own but only at $550 per share, and you have enough capital to buy the 100 shares per contract, then you sell the option and are instantly credited the "Bid" price which would be around $1,100 (more or less depending on many variables).  

If the stock keeps going up, then the option you sold (sell to open) becomes cheaper and cheaper to buy back (buy to close) if you want, or just let it expire worthless and keep 100% of the credit you received.

If the stock goes down and dips to or below the $550 then you'll own the stock at $550 unless you buy to close at a net loss.  Back to the Wheel, however, you'd just turn around and sell (sell to open) Covered Calls against the shares you now own, continuing to pull in credit by virtue of selling to open the contracts. 

There's a guy on r/thetagang I think his name is something like "kamakazi cash" or something like that who does an excellent job describing the Wheel Strategy in his YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRYBh6dtxjY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRYBh6dtxjY)

Options on futures are nice because you can make moves in the post-market. But the spreads are pretty terrible (i.e. depressed liquidity) across the board. The exception being options on /ES.
I’m saying man but the thing is I made like 1,050-1,100 $ can’t really remember the exact number but it was literally just last Friday off 810 12/18 calls so idk I have some hope

Thanks bro, it was pretty disheartening at first ngl. But we can win this shit. We’re never gonna have the same advantages as the MMs but we can still make some money!

I’m not good with credit spreads, but supposedly you can do that and make decent theta gang money on a smaller account. Or sell puts on something with high iv and a lower stock price works too

Hold up wtf the premium is so high, maybe dont sell them ASAP, but it will definetely not be hitting 930 by 12/18 imo. I’d sell them soon if I were you

Real question is how old are you. If 25 or under  yolo it you'll make it back. If 35 or older yolo it your life sucks anyway. If you're in the middle judgment call. Call is right there in the sentence aka buy calls
This isn’t about fundamentals. No one is saying this is a keeper. This is a squeeze. The technicals on this is it’s over 100% shorted at under $15 a share. Get to $30-40 the shorts get margin called and have to deliver the shares that don’t exist. Or if there’s a vote, shares get recalled which is also very possible with Cohen.

There was once a freak named Jesse Livermore who made 1.5 billion in one trade in today's money by shorting the market in 1929...

If PLTR doesn’t cross the 40$ mark tomorrow, I will gag myself to vomit and then I will eat the vomit.
No this week is finally going to have action hello
Reminds of Delos from Westworld and for that reason I’m in.
I think GME is a shit stock and how people don't so obviously see it is the Blockbuster Video of our time baffles me.  So long term it's dead meat.  But short term, it has momentum and a hell of a bullshit thesis to pump it on.  holidays, new consoles, new mgmt etc.  50/50 chance to win big or crash and burn.  could do worse.
I mainly scalp gold futures and have been keeping an eye on the dollar since they go the opposite but now, they don't seem to correlate any longer which is weird. 

Yeah, the think the big thing is less uncertainty with Trump out and vaccines here.
I got 8 at 1.58 ...feeling the same way

I’d be interested but it sounds like it takes away from trading time
Ain’t talking shit I lost money on silver too had some good plays made my money back but silver was a fucking loser!
I mean clearly it's being manipulated both ways tonight. Look at the volume at the inflection points. And it's definitely rangebound now. Probably some manipulator wanted to drop the market but someone more direction-agnostic with bigger pockets stepped in.

So I live in NYC and my parents basement would rent for 2k+ a month if I wasn't living here. 

I have a full 1 bedroom apartment with my own private entrance, parking spot and I actually love my parents so it's nice to be near them incase they even need me for anything. I see no reason to not live here.  My parents also have other rental properties where I can live free of charge aswell, but I choose to stay here. Also it's not really a money thing because I easily spend 50k a year taking them on vacations and stuff. I just like my family I guess.

Tomorrow may be too late. The market knows this too. Perhaps hold off and buy in a week.
Bullshit, I just checked. Would love to be downvoted if I’m wrong, I got calls riding
Robinhood allows for instant settlement and no fees. If you’re doing lots of back to back trading Vanguard may not be your best option. Don’t get me wrong, I still use vanguard for my long term investments (ROTH)

ITM = In the Money.

An option is either ITM, ATM, or OTM.

If it's in the money, then it's profitable and most of it's value is derived from intrinsic value (the value of the underlying stock).

If it's ATM (At the Money), then it's break-even and it's value is based on both intrinsic and extrinsic value (the value an option has based on a number of variables known as The Greeks)

If it's OTM (Out of the money), then the option has not (yet) become profitable and its value is mostly derived from extrinsic value.

Most people are buying OTM PLTR calls hoping it will be ITM by the expiration date. It's paid off so far to everyone who didn't buy on Friday, and that's why you see people hyping it for next week.
“Barron’s said he tried to buy Stripe and failed.”

Can I get instant notification of every trade you make so I can replicate it on 1/10th level and reach $4M some day. 

On quitting, I would probably take time off first and think it through.
I think 30-40 would trigger the squeeze. No clue the top but I “think” that would be enough to trigger the margin calls on the shorts.

Is there any reason you don't find 100% gains acceptable?

Like I told someone else a few days ago, the stock is due for a pullback before it peaks. I'd take the gains on the calls and be happy.
Yeah cancel it. Do not buy during after hours, because it will not actually buy until the market opens, in which case it will give you the price of whatever the contract is at at that point, not what it was when you first tried to buy it. It says your order is queued, so it hasn't gone through yet
Definitely and for once I didn’t mind lol. Made a killing last week and sold off my positions on Friday. Plus 73 years without work was nice

You... You know how SPY works, right?

Fuck $SPGI, amirite.
Man probably better in TSLA as much as I would like to see more sucking up GME shares.. this could shoot at any time but could also be early/mid next year. Just really depends on stock action to trigger the margin call.
Retarded minds think alike. Also holding CVS and TSM but sold my CRSR a while ago. If it dips below 35 this week I"ll buy back in.
Uncertainty about the election gone is part of it.  Also vaccines being close.  Some of it may also be FOMO into cry pto.
So how did this go?

The statistics are basically already baked in. They needed 150 cases, to show demonstrable efficacy among them, and have a good safety profile as well. With the spike, MRNA is going to hit that 150 number this week as well.

If PFE can get it the EUA, there is a great chance MRNA can too. Both of them have already sold 100s of millions of doses that are contingent on approval, so it's only a matter of time. And these aren't alzheimer's drugs - they actually work. They don't have dubious claims about them working over a long period of time... They work as soon as you get the boost dose. The edge MRNA has is that it is easier to store, so there is a potential for a flood of sales after EUA.

Be careful! If you maxed out your margin and it dips with Q3 Earnings you could be forced to sell at a great loss before the squeeze comes. But great position! If you haven't maxed out margin you should also look into getting April $20 Calls for safe money.
I think your right on the selloff EOY. But i think it will pop in January from stimulus news. Probably a sell off later in spring

So what's new?  Shit always takes the elevator and the cable breaks half way down.
I sold 12/18 35p’s on it but when it was like 42 lol. So I’m down 60% but as long as it holds above 35 I’m good, just getting less premium than I could have.

Sorry about the calls man, I’m bullish on crsr, not sure why they tanked this much
I’m holding ACB 2021 calls and am comfortable with em so I don’t have any relevant posts right now lol.

I think PLTR is gonna fuck a lot of you.

Boys Palantir is at 100 in hell and as you know time is distorted there so buy calls as far out as possible
actually 28 on Robinhood, it went up after market
Gold has been pretty well correlated to real rates (basically 10 year yield minus CPI).

I know it's just a saying, but precious metals are hardly boomer commodities. I had a realization when Covid first struck and lockdowns were just announced here. I was at the grocery store grabbing food before they went into a effect and it hit me that what if the store owner laughed at me when I pushed my filled cart up to the register with a credit card, wad of cash, or mobile phone with payment app in hand...and he was like, "uh, yeah, no. that's not going to work here now. shits hit the fan, i ain't giving up my milk, eggs and bread for whatever the fuck that shit is. gimme something with tangible value"
now 8
But they do own RIOT which I'm thinking is about to gap up
buy puts on the way down, sell puts and buy deep otm leaps at the bottom
oh ok. yeah that's a good idea. thanks

Think it goes back to 50 this week or slow moves up? I don’t speak all logic / understanding market movement. I know a lot of Star Wars lore though
MP still gonna rip.  It’s a metals play but the revenue comes from actually using the fucking metals not merely a shitty dollar hedge.  Also QS gonna keep ripping.  EV mania == battery mania.  NIO can fail, NKLA can fail they’re still gonna buy batteries and those metals.  1/15 Calls

I'm 20!!!
such fascinating stuff! So, from what you read, there is strong beleif in the medical research community that there are many or maybe even all cancer-virus linkages? This is something I have been thinking about for all chronic diseases. I have ulcerative colitis which is an autoimmune disease. I have interestingly found (in my own experimentation) that my symptoms are lightened when I take certain anti-microbial or anti-viral supplements (colloidal silver, oregano oil are examples of such supplements) which to me indicates my disease might have a viral, or a biofilm, trigger. I also use EDTA which is used to break up biofilms. In case you don't know, biofilm is a matrix of nanobacteria in the body that creates a matrix of calcium protection around it so that the body cannot attack it. There is some speculation that it is the root of auto-immune diseases because it is being attacked by the auto immune system but the biofilm nanopartical matrix is too microscopic to be seen by modern medical imaging. Kind of a sidebar but your comment on the link between virus and disease made me think of this.

What strike price
The subs for saving requirement has people celebrating with a 10-15% return lol. Need to be more aggressive with the current situation.
AT LEAST. But you really gotta pump those numbers up.
Oh, see I'm not as familiar with these terms, so I assume anything with a price that is not obviously a ticker (USA, GDP) is legit. There's a "blacklist" of terms to avoid, so I'll add that to it! Thanks!
Lets also keep in mind that unlike us autists, actual institutional investors are made privy to what the acquisition target is beforehand and sign NDAs so whatever it is is enticing to big players.

Your fist bullet point assumes that UPS will be getting a surge of business because they are involved in Ops Warp Speed. Google”major pharma distributors” and that will debunk your first point. If you would like more information DM me. 

To your 2nd point - you may be correct, but I would honestly assume that last mile (non-parcel) companies are the winner here. A good example of this is XPO. Completely your decision to make on this point.... just my 2 cents.

What’s going on
I have 12/18 $7c. I’m playing the vote on this. It is probably DOA in the Senate, and the Biden admin likely has some other items on their to do list before they ask the Dems to put it back on the floor. Take profits on the vote/bump (because it should pass the House) then look 2023 before the next action. APHA, imo, is the most stable bet because they are well diversified, especially with the Sweetwater, acquisition and they have cash on hand. I will likely load up on shares for the next year as well as some LEAPS and ride the waves.
CVS is a good play. Vaccines are going to be administered at these locations. You'll get a ton of store traffic and likely plenty of peripheral shopping.

CVS TSM CRSR here.
200% on FDs is painful. I wish I could write these in my Roth.
Great job buying in at the top. Obviously a good chance it still goes up but damn could you jump in with that kind of money any later??
When is the squeeze supposed to happen?
This stock creeps up in the winter, every winter, and plateaus in late December/mid January before dropping off again.

If you've got options it's a good time to sell. Shares you can hold until you see the next pullback to dump because it's not going to drop fast enough for you to lose a significant portion of your gains.
If this sub wasn't retarded we would all buy TLS calls with a decent amount of time on them and then shill the shit out of the stock
Before you buy into anything, please make a 45 day cashflow budget to be sure it won't throw your account negative. This really is a casino.
CACI
If only there was some way to make money on options with +150% IV  if the stock moves either direction ...
Even if that's where it's headed, I think there will be a pretty decent bounce before we even see 1700. I think we get back to at least 1830. Could tank after that, who knows.
Based on what?
Funny how BABA doesn't really get affect that much by HK prices when it goes up. When it goes down it'll go twice as fast. RIP my calls.

Honestly one of the dumbest trends in American culture is the trivialization (and fetishizing) of mental illness. 

Anxiety disorders, depression - these things are legitimate mental illnesses that affect people. Just like being diagnosed with Gout or Crohn’s Disease or some shit. They’re physiological. 

Feeling anxious or sad based on legitimate stressors in life is not a mental illness. And it does not necessitate passive-aggressive Instagram stories about how people don’t take mental illness seriously. Just so god damn dumb.

Too many bullish catalysts is a bearish catalyst imo

People near retiree age are probably investing hundreds of thousands on the lowside and millions on the high side. If they are on WSB at that point, they've basically failed.
Puts are fickle cunts but when the hit right they feel so fucking good
Selling a put gives the buyer the right to sell shares to you.

Some dude said buy GME ASAP and was super confident, basically it read less like DD and more like a tip...then the post came down later. He claimed it was a coincidence.
That. Doesn’t make sense. What share went up over 1000% that you think was less risky than options?

Please please please, don't throw your money on any suggestions provided here. I am not saying all the play will definitely go against you, but you know the value of 100 bucks and losing it all.

Let's say you make 1000$ of 100$, that doesn't mean the next play you see here will help you grow that 1000$ to 10000$, people don't talk about their journey it can go anyway 100>1000>50>25>643>10000>0. 

The plays mentioned here are to be played with EXTRA SAVINGS. Use the money to build a skill that can help you get up on your feet, then save some and learn how to trade, and then use tools, this sub, etc for picking stocks and playing with your accumulated knowledge.

THIS IS CASINO for most of the ppl, and 1 gold rule of the casino is HOUSE ALWAYS WINS.
PTSH has a value of $4bn. SPACs buy a minority share and merge, not outright buyout the company with change to spare. C3 has potential, but it is far too small in market cap for a SPAC the size of PTSH

Hi there. Apologies in advance for the dumb question but once you sell the put, what do you do? I believe the only two options is to let it expire where I’d have to sell the 100 shares to the buyer at the strike price or I can buy a call with the same strike price and expiration date? For the later, do I need to then sell a call? Trying to figure out how to cash out after hopefully making some profits. Thanks!
It hit 1767.2. I think this area is a solid short term bottom but the speed of the drop to get there was kinda scary.
Better than the one I just gave you or between DKNG and PLTR? Cant tell you the answer to the latter but my options are 95% DKNG calls 5% PLTR calls

Don’t play weeklies, to much volatility. I’d go 12/18 as the earliest but preferably 1/15/21 or later. You could play the 12/11 calls for the possible ER run up but I’d suggest getting out right before if that’s the route you wanna take. Seen a lot of people lose money (including myself) trying to play weeklies.

we're in a high risk spot so I don't wanna give the impression that we're "safe" or anything.

It's up like 25% or so which isn't bad but isn't that amazing vs other tech names.
Yup potential target for PSTH
I don't agree with this analysis. During a short squeeze, Call options play a major role. If a few people each bought a sizable out of money calls, then rally turns those in the money, they demand stocks, no shorts can supply so many shares.

My point is, we don't know how many shares and Call options are in diamond hands.

Besides, where is data shows VW short to float was 12:1? I remember at that time shorts couldn't cover because there were not enough free shares for every short, then every short panic at the same time.

Technically if 80% shares are locked, 22% short, that could lead to huge squeeze.
Just means you need to do 6 tests, rapidly. That's 6x the machines.

75% of this sub will be gone

Very short term we will have bad news. No more vaccine pumps. High infection rates. I am cash this next week. Feeling like we might go down 5-10%
VW only had 3% of the shares *not locked up*.  Porsche had 76%, the German state had 20.1%, all those shares not sellable.

KBIO had only 25% of the shares *not locked up*.  Shkrelli was sitting on 75%, not selling them.

VW had a short to float of 12.  KBIOs short to float was around 8 to 10.

GMEs short to float is like 1.3.

And there's been plenty of issues with more than 100% short interest.

Plenty.

When are you folks going to understand... there are 140m shares in long positions, only a *tiny* fraction of which aren't getting sold no matter price.

ALLLLLL the rest of those shares are available to sell, and they're not going to be sitting there twiddling their thumbs waiting to sell if this thing even goes to $35.

A requisite part of an enormous squeeze ala VW is that *a large percentage of the float needs to be locked up and not for sale at any price*.
SNOW 12/4p $320 2/14/21p $200 NKLA 12/4p 17.5$

I don’t like the emotional attachment that comes with having shares.  Buy a call or debit spread, make a reasonable profit, flip it, move on, and never think about it again.
BABA made me a lot of money for month. And has wiped me in November. I expected a quick bounce back, but people are genuinely spooked.

Take a short position and then it’s positive vibes
And like I said that has nothing to do with you being wrong in your statement, which was not an opinion, but a statement of fact about what has happened in the past.
Yes SEC this post right here
Then get a fucking job. Seriously, if you can't afford to pay for food, run far away from this sub ffs.
Yell out a ticker name. Close your eyes, look at a very bright light through your eyelids. Turn off the lights. The squiggly lines flashing in your vision are the current AH price.

Can you explain why they need to go SPAC instead of traditional ipo or direct listing?
It's now 267 US implied open (259 in HK but US has a +roughly 8 to that value) Still got time and the US pre market session to recover but not great given that's a huge drop from the Friday close.

Thank you
In the US, we've never had a corona or influenza vaccine with higher than 50% effective rate in perfect conditions. Regular effective rates are much lower. This is a long shot even for wsb.

“Data from the 2018-2019 flu season, the most recent set of complete information, first published in June, indicated that a flu shot to prevent influenza A, the H3N2 strain, was only 9% effective in preventing onset of the flu, among all age groups. Among those from 9 to 49 years old, the effectiveness rate was 3%.”

Alright dude we will see, like I said earnings is right there
Both short shares and puts, puts were deep ITM, now OTM. They might have sold them, since the 13f was from 9/30, they could have sold after the Microsoft news at a massive loss. But they have shorted a lot of shares. Apparently they’d be in massive pain at around $18, from what I’ve heard, and that could be a price point where they start covering.
You have that backwards.

That they sink every time after earnings. It’s a fact that this was an incorrect statement. You can’t admit you’re wrong. And all of this is hilarious 😂
Lol last zm earnings is when I first was building my account. I had like 10 shares only and it went up $200 lmfao. Beginners luck. But right now zm could go either way tbh. So i will just hold some shares

In one case you have downside protection (selling the Put).  The other case you don’t.  That’s the point.  

Even if the stock totally crashes, you are losing less money when you have downside protection.   Make sense?
Why do you say that? It’s fuckin TSLA
Agreed
Hi, this is Wendy's. Would you like tendies with your order?
This perfectly shows the volatility of stocks. Gotta love it.
That’s the perfect amount of time for PFE stock to go up on advisory committee hype and the moderna hype gets diluted. I’m sort of hoping for the advisory committee to say they want more results from PFe and the statistics used to come up with “95%” efficacy is weak, but as you say it’s a EAU so unless it is harming people, they’re going to try it (but maybe not... I won big betting the advisory committee would not approve BIIBs Alzheimer’s drug)

All my Nigerians hate Citron Research.
BABA is way too volatile for me to go in on calls or shares.

I just keep selling $260p and it just keeps expiring OTM so I just keep rinsing and repeating
1768 should be the reversal but it fell so fast as it approached it, I got scared. I bought near the bottom but also sold on the slight bounce. If this area fails, I'll be looking at 1700 but the next true reversal would be around 1590.

I think virgin galactic will tweet something tomorrow morning at 7 am eastern time and 4 am pacific time. Agree?
This guy’s 40 years old btw
I mean I guess. For the time being they have a pretty shit dividend. Still has loads of room for capital growth. Won’t move that easy because of the huge market cap, but significant volatility isn’t out of the question, especially surrounding earnings. Like I said above, I’m not looking for a 10 bagger. I’d be more than happy with a 30-50% profit. I put a huge portion of my portfolio on the line with PLTR and I’m looking to slow my roll for a couple months before another big play
You the man

I lent someone 1000 McDoubles to sell to others; this person would pay me back at market value.  But now a million people want to buy McDoubles. So now a McDouble costs $100 and the dude who borrowed the McDoubles now has to pay $100 each to buy them back.

Then more people want to get in on the McDouble trend and the price goes up to $200.

Then people get sick of McDoubles. Exit before this step.

How much money is enough to move out of your parents house? Right now I have 67k, this will probably be my last year living with my family while I get a steady income (which is probably more important).
Agree. I’ll be buying Dec 24 18 puts today.

Green tomorrow and next week because people are still riding the hype of 30,000. Red in January because of the inauguration and it's starting to look like Joey is gonna be "hArD oN cHiNa". Thats my predictions. I'm big gay if wrong

How does PFE having an advisory committee review before MRNA effect the reaction? I feel like PFE Will steal the spotlight. 
Also, is the MRNA data any better than PFE because the PFE data is weak and the “95%” is bullshit
Yeah, why listen to just one retard when you could listen to 30,000 autists.

What influences the interest on both US debt and bonds? And why?
Untuck and let's fucking go
[removed]
No idea. Just looked at its price. The US price is around 8-9 more than what you see on Yahoo finance if you look up BABA HSI. There's more volume in the US though so pre market it can go back up.
Any reason why?
Lol.  PLTR is not going to +69% tomorrow, or by the end of the year.  I hate to burst your bubble.  You should probably get out before the dump and move onto the next meme stock.
yah, I'm in QQQ and TQQQ wondering which prints harder LOL.  That opening was awesome but damn these blue balls gonna make it hard to sleep tonight.

I wish you included this with some DD. I’m sure you do have good reason to buy, but there’s so many pumpable stocks on this sub that I’d have to spend an hour just understanding what this company does. I wouldn’t have enough time to do a full DD on every stock mentioned here without an initial analysis on why I should consider it. Someone gives me that and I’ll pump your stock harder than your boyfriend’s blowup doll

It’s when autists like us make stock go uppie to fuck over ppl like Citron and thus it continues to go uppie
Feel like one of the best things that can happen to someone getting in to options is to get totally wrecked on your first trade (which is hopefully pretty small), just so you understand what can happen if it goes wrong. My first ever options play I doubled my investment in like 15 minutes and it seriously warped my perception of how options worked, which obv cost me down the line.

Let me re-phrase, Apple is such a shitty play for WSB. Options give ass returns, you won't get much on the stock itself (maybe 2-3% gains). Apple belongs in r/investing

If there wasn't a pandemic, airbnb wouldn't be a bad stock to throw 200 dollars in.

PLTR flat day tomorrow and y’all will lose your minds.
Yes and then Stripe instantly went on to fill these spots making this old news. Its as if some people on here really think an initial declination (if that even happened, you have show no proof) means the terms cannot be negotiated later or when new info comes in. These people are investors. Deals can happen at any moment.

Guys there are other great option plays besides PLTR. Not shitting on PLTR just sayin' the risk/reward calculation doesn't look good with the huge amount of IV this stock is getting. I hope it all works out for everyone but I've seen this with NIO and SPCE. FOMO works until it doesn't. I will definitely load up on LEAP PLTR options if it does crash though.

Why are they all huddled around that girl?
Got it ok thanks
Thanks for this, I've been reading on SPACs lately and this + the comment section gives quite a good insight
Just because I’m a pussy and can’t pick an exp date grab some stock. I grabbed 5k in stock, 350 shares to watch the fun. If you wanted options look into March or April 2021
Yea the theta difference is huge. A 20 dollar wide spread makes 20% of what I can make if it's naked. It's 20% OTM, it's a lot less risk than what people perceive. I know it can go up like 40%, but I think it's highly unlikely this time around.

Maybe, it seemed like mostly actual buying rather than coverings but I could be wrong, and yea there’s still a lot more, a good chunk could cover next week. Melvin capital is getting crushed rn on they’re short position, when they cover it should cause a nice spike
Ur fine
Really shouldn't say such nonsense on the internet. Tesla leads ev sales in 21 countries nissan is second with 9. And nissan basically only sells the leaf dipshit. Tesla sells every car they build. Again keep dodging the no marketing budget or dealership network please explain how vw will compete against a company that doesn't have to advertise or deal with dealerships..
Doesnt have to be tomorrow. By Friday is good with me. Lul
Tests weren't as accurate for asymptomatic patients, as its still not as understood but mainly COVID vaccines came out, which I admit are concerning for long term prospects, but in reality, these tests will likely be needed for at least the next 1-2 years as thats how long vaccine will roll out, the possibility of mutation in the virus which could render vaccines useless, a huge portion of the population who choose not to get vaccinated means COVID will still spread, mind you fatalities will decrease significantly. As well we still don't know if antibodies are long term or short term, so if antibodies only last a few months, we will need to be vaccinated at least annually.
Up over 100% and one day it “dumps” 5% yeah dog this ain’t it
Dude, you should roll out of those puts to some that are OTM. You’re leaving a lot of potential money behind as your multiple will be way lower
all pltr call holders looking for confirmation bias while they profusely sweating all over their body
I'll cum so hard if this happens. They'll I'll load up on leaps afterwards.

Wow do small caps and value suck
Yeah. That cock sucker tried to scare everyone. Probably made millions shorting the stock before the release.
What should I do with my pltr calls at open?
Not a chance boyo.  Shove it in and shove it in deep.
I’m dumb
I’m one of those guys!!! Put thousands in weekly calls based on the dd and hype around here, they were -90% in the morning. So fucking pissed. I’m finally back but it took a long ass time to recover.
Gotta wait for all the millions of tards to return after exchanging Rona with their mom, dad, aunties, etc. we had 50m who crammed their dumbasases into airports and aluminum tubes

I appreciate the effort, but this kind of sucks. Hopefully my downvote will inspire you to provide actual lols next time. All the best
Nono, look it up. I actually recommend you look into EVOK it is a really solid buy. As I explained 2 another commenter they basically set up a monopoly on a certain drug and profits will be rolling in for years
Thanks for your advice!
You good
oooof
Even on massive red days like tomorrow you know weeds going to be flat or up so happy 95% of my current position is in pop s*** doesn't fall the market at all

“Broken bones and fractures among older people increase their risk of death for up to 10 years, according to a new study published in the Endocrine Society's Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.”

Why the market is freaking out a bit despite it just being a fracture. Imagine khamala as president 🤡
I am part of the gang. Never going to touch that stonk again.
Happy to engage with this further! 

First I said banks will still keep reserve balances, not that every single reserve dollar makes its way into your checking account. 

Bank reserves are not dead money and can be used for reasons other than collateral to lend against—primarily for transaction settlement in the economy, I.e., transactions between market participants. When I transfer money to you, what’s actually happening is my bank sends reserves to your bank, and my account is debited and yours is credited to reflect this transfer. The same is true when you earn a paycheck. 

What happens when firm A has bonds but needs cash? It sells them to someone who has cash. That transaction is facilitated via bank reserves. What has happened in the housing market over the past ten years, especially since the Covid crisis? The fed’s QE has further suppressed interest rates, which goes downstream to suppressing mortgage rates and, paired with Covid flight from the cities, has caused housing prices to rise! Now what else happens when interest rates on savings accounts, CDs, and other safe money instruments are low? People seek return in financial assets, I.e., the stock market, which again, drives prices up. Pension funds specifically have contractual requirements to earn returns that they can’t get with treasuries anymore.

Moving overseas, this same thing happens on a global level. The strong demand for the dollar and US citizens being net spenders means that the US gov has run a current account deficit for quite some time—basically meaning we import more than we export, causing other counties to need dollars to buy out assets. But you know what we do export? Treasuries. Other counties but treasuries because they need access to the dollar to buy dollar denominated assets. You know why Japan, despite spearheading QE and yield control, isn’t in a similar position? Because they are net savers (obviously there are other factors lol). And in a low interest rate environment, where do they put that saved money? US assets, again driving prices up. 

This was a long winded, and admittedly tangental, explanation to say that OP’s write up is misleading, as it makes it seem like quantitative easing does not promote liquidity and has not made its way downstream to affect businesses and individuals. Banks can “withdraw” all of these excess reserves (again, reserve requirement is zero) to buy assets, settle transactions, pay companies’ payrolls, and yes, lend. Of course banks don’t withdraw cash from the federal reserve. That was never the point, and I apologize if anything I wrote blurred that line. The point is that QE, and bank reserves, aren’t just dead collateral waiting to be lent. 

If you’re further interested in bank reserves, I recommend reading some about the 2019 repo crisis, which essentially was a sudden upward shock in the reserve rate when banks couldn’t get access to as many reserves as they needed. Pretty interesting stuff.
Buy puts then, weak hands don’t get rich

Fellow retards, can someone explain what the GME squeeze shit means? I have no idea so I’m putting my life savings into it
What’s the position? Stocks or options?
Wtf are you talking about
squeeze = good if you're long
Why would anyone base their trading strategies from what a stock guru says that’s only 1 perspective ... when u can read 30,000 different perspectives for free on Wall Street bets 🤔🤔🤔
Does anyone else start playing money themed music at 9 o’clock if your positions are looking good pre-market because I do and I feel like a fucking idiot every time when looking back lmao
You probably won’t get a good answer on this sub. Watch a beginners guide to options on YouTube. I’m just starting too, so I’ll tell ya what I’ve gathered. 

The price you’re paying to buy an option is the premium. It’s what you pay to have the right to exercise that option at the given strike price. The farther out the exp. and closer to ITM the strike price is the higher the premiums will be. That’s why OTM weeklies are dirt cheap, but if they hit, you can sell your option for 1000% more than you bought it

He likely bought this put awhile ago when his strike prices were 15-30% OTM

I share this sentiment
Copper demand project to exceed supply and price is rising. Vale has some exposure to copper so probably got swept up in it. Your analysis is same as mine - i looked at it late last week and felt like price was already too high so moved on. If wouldn’t buy, could be time to sell. It’s a slow mover though, so probably wouldnt get burned much to speculate a few mote days until it started dropping to sell. Or just set a trailing stop limit at like 5% below high price and let the computer do the monitoring for you.
Why would that be the case?
Here's to hoping it was just WSB overeacting to a little dip..

No. Like the disclaimer said I ended up putting in 70k which was most of my life savings. I did start small though and played simple up percents to leverage my gains. Had to put my biggest deposit when the market was crashing in March though.
buy calls 3-6 months out with the goal of doubling within two months of purchase. Be patient and only buy on down days for the stock you're interested in. have limit sells in place even if it means you miss out on further gains. Find stocks that are unfairly down and have a compelling story for being undervalued. After selling put all the money on the next options play. However DO NOT hold these options less than a month from expiration. Also never FOMO. At least people who YOLO on weeklies have balls. FOMO is just gay.

I been watching OSTK for the last couple of weeks. I have $80c 12/18 calls.  It goes up nice in pre market.  Dips within first hour of trading. Then breaks PM price and goes higher.  So I'm gonna buy more calls after market open on the dip.
[removed]
Big oof
I did that too. 3,990 shares at $5.88
Are you?
I'm going to be giving you a bag full of shit.
45c 12/24 back on 11/19 when it was 42. It's up 30% the last month and only looking up with GM's push for EV percentage. I'm not bullish on the Hummer but short of the batteries blowing up (their spark/volt platforms didn't) they have the play over the others in the Big 3. 

I put 500 into RH on a lark (thanks to WSB) a month ago. GM alone has made me 2000 in that timeframe (this is my third OTM call).

Ride it on the way up to day before flight, buy weekly put to cover shares over flight week? 

I agree a crash is an inherent risk that could tank the company. I bought 700 shares at 21, as I feel the reward outweighs the risk on this one. If i was a betting man, I’d say crash=50% drop, success=20% + run, this looks skewed to the risk side, but i also anticipate a low risk of crash, low single digits to be conservative. Overall I calculate the reward outweighing the risk, but still 700 shares is my comfort zone for this play.
I was waiting for someone to create this. Well dine

Cocaine, jr. and Baby Cocaine.  It's an underserved market.
1.  Option market makers have to hedge.  If you buy a call from them, they become “short” this stock.  They hedge by buying stock.  Gamma is the sensitivity of hedge amount (delta) as the stock price changes.  They effectively become more short as the stock price increases and need to buy more stock to remained hedged.
2.  Same goes in reverse.  You buy a put, they become “long” the stock.  So they need to sell stock to hedge.  As the stock price declines, they need to sell more.   That’s gamma.

The other thing to think about is location of buys.  The 23rd last week was a HEAVY volume day for BLKN.  With Fridays close BELOW the levels from the 23rd, there are trapped longs above.   Most on this thread are weak hands and will capitulate easily.  That capitulation causes prices to cascade lower.  

Make sense?

Nah, I’m still up 320% YTD. I’ve been pretty suicidal all year and I just used WSB and trading as a distraction. Even when I was making $$$, that suicidal feeling didn’t go away so I tried donating and awarding random ppl in the thread, which helped but only momentarily. Eventually I thought there’s no point in distracting yourself, either seppuku or improve your life. For a long time I was seppuku gang but now I actually want to improve my life. Every second I spend on Reddit just feels a second that takes me further away from my vision for myself.

Lockdowns are not priced in. Scientific consensus is that the number of rona deaths will hit records in about 5-7 weeks. 

The question is: Will anybody care? Will politicians feel pressure to institute lockdowns with so much of the population opposed? No elections looming so they won’t be as careful pissing off constituents. Cell data shows people are moving around like pre-rona levels. That’s what the market cares about. 

Personally, I think most dem governors will institute semi-lockdown measures once the news is filled with photos of bodies stacked in fridge trailers. Market will go red for a week or two. Atlas (JPow)will hold the whole thing on his shoulders and, barring a major precipitating event that creates a correction, market will go back to Pamplona bull run.

Thinking about picking up some longer dated AAPL calls tomorrow. It’s been treading water for a bit and IV is pretty low
I was hoping they would before earnings. That doesn’t look to be the case now. So I’m not sure. Again there could be a pull back from them so depending on how this week goes I’ll hedge. But as long as Ryan is still in I’ll still be heavily in this. Because I understand why he’s absolutely drooling over this opportunity. Seems like a no brainer for the board

I remember back in July ish I believe we were down almost 3 %%% and by eod we were green, made $$$ on puts and calls in the same day, crazy
Partially agree, that it is a value investing company. But, the stock is up 45% YTD, so def room for more growth with some good PR or analyst upgrade

Yes, unless you have other securities and certain margin levels

I work in the tech industry and have heard pretty positive things about the company. I know that they've been soaking up great SWE & UX talent and have heard good things about their founders. They are also profitable already I believe (well, at least before the pandemic) and we all know their business model is pretty solid. I'm planning on going long with shares unless they open with a stupid high valuation.
Farmers Market in Bangladesh, mby!
I'm pretty autistic so I think I'll be able to sell a decent profit, even if I don't sell the high. I got out of PLTR with a 5% profit last week lol.
No, it was a flop for e-commerce. 


But deals have been sht for years and pandemic. What people expect.
Gains or gains. We win either way

I’ll see you back here soon like tmrw actually keep your calls though
I experienced something like that a couple years ago. Guy next to me looked like he was in his 50's and was just watching porn on his ipad with headphones. Zero fucks given.
Oh better mental health for sure. I haven’t traded in 2-3 months, still up 320% YTD tho. Even when my portfolio was going parabolic, I was still suicidal so it doesn’t really interest me anymore

Yea yea! I'm like 95% reps control the senate in which case I think lot of the faang's will gap up bigly. Funny thing is that market will react to it imo even though it seems very obvious of the outcome. But if you think dems will, weed stocks will be a killer play here

You guys make fun of /r/investing but their DD is consistently better than what average DD we see here.
Like a bag of sand
Sorry can’t post any loss porn, my calls already up too much :( Good luck next time
Cashed in some good tendies at $49 and will hold out until we hit the 20 day MA of around 35. shit went parabolic and usually the 50 and 20 day MAs are some good support levels when it happens. Could be a short term bounce but the risk reward is to high right now
Why the fuck did the auto mods create a shit filter
Yeah that’s the plan rn. The continuous red just hurts
This sub is the greatest sub! Fo life bitchez!
But we need his material for these. That’s his real contribution.

Hah that’d be great but no. Taxes at end of year and I need to buy a house. But I will still be fighting and trading. And won’t stop till I hit the top or bottom.
Hi there! Dumb question but are you 1602% because you purchase these puts a while back or...? I am genuinely trying my best to learn about options trading but it’s like another language to me. I was thinking of buying my first put for $38.50-$39.50 with expiration of 12/24. I see you’ve chosen a closer expiration and am trying to figure out why one is better than the other. I would really like to figure this all out as soon as I can. Also, based on the milestones you listed, when are you looking to sell your put? Do you usually wait to hit a certain profit % or determine a date in advance? My parents didn’t do the best job saving for retirement so I’d like to help them multiply as best as I can. Thanks so much!

You hesitate. “...Hey, Mom.”

“I’m sorry, who’s this? I don’t have children.” You can see the wry smile on her face, through her voice. Despite yourself, you smile, too. In this moment you regret not calling her more. She *is* funny.

“Oh, sorry, wrong number. Bye.” You both start laughing after she chants *NoNoNoNoNo*. She tells you about her garden and your dad’s new golf clubs. She asks about your love life, and you tell her about the girl you’ve been on four dates with. She asks when you’re coming home next. And you’re noncommittal.

“Anyway, why’d you call?” Call. Call. Calls.

“Mom, I need some money.”

Buy an Apple call spread.  Buy June 18 115 sell June 18 145. It comes out to around 900 a contract. you can potentially make 2100 if it closes above 145 in June. It also gives you plenty of time for it to play out.

Very nice word
Most of these idiots are over leveraged with loan money on OTM pltr calls or 10% over the money weeklys on spy. As I said earlier, even a -0.1 “red day” it’s gonna wipe out half of the people screeching PLTR calls, stonks only go op, bear r fuckers, and the plethora of idiots statements inundating the main post nowadays
if it gets to $30 next week ill give you my teeth fr fr
Nothing. No Reddit at all.
Yea, writing it down and having to go look back at it is much quicker than pressing two keys and then getting all my reminders at 6:30:03.
Being a rich guy that doesn't eat his own shit... Do you think pltr will moon tomorrow?. Because I'm pretty nervous.
Synopsys will do well i bet.  Most computer chips are designed with SNPS technology, and that sector is just crazy.

Honestly ? I think it’s going to tank heavily 

Why ? 

Because I bought shares and calls
PLTR is worth $23 max.  Typical Pump & Dump. Bought puts at 32.  Move on to the next meme this run is done.
That’s my motto after my shit swing trade play. Only then, I’ll be mad I bought in at the wrong time and missed out on a 100000% gain.

Everyone is talking about $PLTR. I'm gonna buy $CROX ITM calls tomorrow morning. It's up YoY on Google Trends and has good social media growth. I see a decent amount of upside and limited downside here.

I hope not that high, I have more calls to buy
Honestly like 20k. Most youngish healthy people are fine and the old people dying don't really contribute to equities. Sad to say but the market doesn't give a fuck about them
Black Friday was a huge flop for non e-commerce.
I honestly didn’t even think about IV crush after earnings!!! Thanks for the reminder and heads up. I’ll probably offload if it goes positive before Dec 8th and roll profits into 15 Jan calls if I got capital to spare.

The fucks going on here? Can an autist translate this to a bigger autist?
Wtf is this. Are you 13?
The downside protection is on the price of going Long on stock.  For example,

You could just buy 100 shares of PLTR at 27.66.  But you have zero downside protection.  

But if you sell a 201224P26 (I.e. a Dec 24 $26 Put), you get a $4.40 premium.  If assigned, the each share will cost you $26-$4.40 = $21.60.  So you are getting $4.40 in downside protection.

No... one share of slack won’t equal one share of Salesforce when acquisition closes. Salesforce has a significantly higher market cap so you will get small fraction of CRM shares for each share of Slack. First we don’t know the acquisition price. Second we don’t know whether it’s all stock or all cash or mix of both.

However let’s assume Salesforce acquires Slack for $30B in all-shares deal, you would probably get 0.13-0.15 shares of Salesforce for each Slack share.

Hi there. I’m going to ask the dumbest question ever because I am genuinely doing my best to learn about option trading. It’s like a whole other language to me. For the amounts you were up, is that because it was it affected by how close you were to the expiration date? Trying to assess whether I should by my very first call for strike price of $35 or $40 with the same expiration date (12/4) as you? You have the least amount profit on it at the moment but I’m assuming it’s because $40 is far from the current stock price and perhaps because it’s a week out? I would really like to figure this all out. My parents didn’t do the best job saving for retirement so I’d like to help them multiply as best as I can. Thanks so much!

You’re going to buy calls during a bearish pennant...this I have to see. Please post results. Godspeed you autistic motherfucker.
That is f-in nuts. Sell 2x puts,  if they activate you have shares on margin and you can still sell calls against shares you own on margin I assume.

So on PLTR you could literally make 15-20% on cash in a week. With risk, but as soon as it makes you own them you sell calls. It would have to go off a GD cliff to lose.
Picking up 1000 OTM GM calls lol

In 2030 33% of automobile sales will be EVs. Do you really think that legacy auto will be able to maintain the same market share in EVs that that they have in ICE?

Clearly legacy auto will face declining sales. 


I'm skeptical of the legacy auto companies other than Volkswagen. The others are too far behind. 

Tesla, Chinese EV companies, Rivian and Volkswagen will probably take up the majority of the market.
I'm more than happy to watch numbers tick up and down when it's yielding me 1100% returns. It's not always a "random walk". I follow patterns, levels of support and resistance. 
If your way of trading works out for you as well as mine does for me, we're all winners.

Anyone have numbers on TSLA short interest? Delivery week coming up ... saw this [Chart on Twitter ](https://twitter.com/post_market/status/1332881243906715649?s=21) indicating shorts may have mostly covered
im not holding calls.
Anybody got a grill so these bears don’t have to get raw dogged?
Ask Santa then
It depends, basically if a call has been skyrocketing up and already had a pretty good run, more often than not it makes sense to just be happy and take the profits. Or you could hold and hope that it continues upwards, in which case you bank even harder, the flip side ofc is that it could stall or drop, in which case you'll wish you'd sold. 

Calls are great when there's a lot of forward momentum but not so much in any other situation. 9 times out of 10 I'm glad I got out while I was ahead with call options.

Only place to buy vacuums is Costco. They always have a top 3 consumer reports model for around $100 with rebate. If it stops working, you take it back. Official Costco policy is you can return vacuums without a receipt forever. My $100 Hoover is better than the dyson it replaced. The motor broke after 8 months, Hoover would t send me the part so I returned and bought a new one, no questions asked.
A bit late to the party.
De way
I could....
So let me get this right. This GME squeeze is basically a large scale pump and dump but no dump? We buy to stringer a short squeeze with no float thus jacking up the price ? Mods I think we should ban the whole sub. 1.8 million pump n dumpers
How are we going to let 🍋 or 🌈🐻 get us down about pltr? The only thing we need to be worrying about is keeping our hands and feet inside the vehicle at all times as we fucking 🚀🚀🚀 until we land safely on the 🌚. If you are scared stop buying weeklies.

If a red stock falls in the forest and no one is there to sell is it really red?
Yeah, but even more OTM on the big drops you may still lose. Then it would make sense just to say fuck those times and go riskier for more premium to offset the losing plays. I also downloaded tons of stocks data and ran the same calculations.  I created a program to run thru the data faster and everything.  Definitely paid well until big tech got raped by the vaccine news 2 weeks in a row. I lost 90% of my gains from the last 2 months in 2 weeks. That shit was fucked. My fault tho for being so heavy in tech
How are we red? My eyes can’t even see red anymore!
It’s getting bought a little bit. I’m not too worried

I updated the wsb wiki one day a mod said he’d flair anyone who did it but didn’t give him suggestions so he decided to troll flair me with this I guess because the election was coming up.

My stock broker in my country here don't offer Options..sad.

Eh, at best they announce a signing of the deal that's already been known.  The details of that deal are so one-sided in GM's favor that it's hilarious.  

The only reason it's not easy money is the same reason it's at 28/share currently, which is that it's propped up by speculators.  Once some start bailing hard the others will cut their losses (at least that's my suspicion).
If SPY could get down to pre election lows tomorrow that could be tight.

oh fuck i was thinking you were kidding and looked this up. holy shit. i do have symptoms for this. i make unusual sounds sometimes.
It's a job, I love helping people, but always being short staffed and dealing with management is getting old fast. I want to be financially independent enough to not rely on it as my main source of income. I think small doses of it is amazing but full time is life sucking. That said if you're into that stuff, ED/ER is definitely the place for it.
I don’t think this recent run has been fueled by coverings, at least not fully by coverings, I however do think there will be somewhat of a squeeze next week, leading up to earnings. I do think gme will dump after earnings tho, from then on idk what’s gonna happen
Yes trade er off buddy boy PLTR is gonna take off by EOY

I've been keeping my eye on it. I'm gonna see what Monday is like and maybe get a couple calls come Tuesday if it performs well
You can't buy covered or naked calls, you can sell covered or naked calls though. That said, you can get extra leverage by buying calls with margin. Strait up jacked to the tits. Maybe PLTR stock and calls with the cash and GME calls with margin?

You're fucking autist- artistic! You're artistic as hell. Thank you. 

This should be perma-pinned.
It was a 5k account, I was too slow so I only leveraged up to 300k, if I had used a bot I could have gotten like 10 mil to 100 mil leverage I bet. The correct thing to do after that would be to spend it on 0dte options or weeklys, because they lock the account as soon as they detect free riding. You get to keep the gains if it works, and if you lose a lot they wouldn’t come after you because they allowed it to happen.My account was locked and liquidated, I somehow left with 10k.
Paper trading contest? Tell me more!
Yeah the upside loss was tough to swallow even for me, someone who absolutely does not left FOMO affect me, especially since I bought on IPO day because I had faith in the company based on all the reports and analysts. I only sold the call because it stagnated so bad for a long period of time, and 22.50 was my cost average, so I figured I'd get out of it by breaking even + premium.

Have plans to do any TSLA calls? You’d make a killing rn especially with the S&P 500 inclusion hype.
Same. Sold on Friday and now sitting in cash. WSB about to have alota loss porn
Did you make this all in calls? I'm mostly just running on equity but those are some wild gains
There’s literally a hit against that stock every time it starts getting bullish.

I have money and a Robinhood account. So, let’s do this thing. Going for Millionaire or homeless sounds like the responsible thing to do. 

First, I must reveal the depths of my ignorance. I have no idea what the difference is between a stock, call, put, or option- or how to leverage them. Rather than telling me, or my Googling at random, can you recommend a resource for education? 

Starting with one of the two subs you mentioned might be the safer option. Though, safe is boring if I can still learn the basics from WSB.

Yeah, I exported historical data for that stock and calculated the price change every 2 weeks and definitely seen a few points spread out where it drops below 5-6% (excluding the big march drop of course). I may just go even more OTM with the extra profit as I hit em to be a bit "safer"

Short term: Nobody knows what’s going to happen w PLTR, it’s practically polarized this sub. 

Long term: I think it’s a great investment w a lot of potential. Just look at the backers and project Tiberius. Even though it hasn’t turned a profit it has a great trajectory. Not to sound like a 🚀🚀🚀 guy

No Chinese companies have ever complied with other country’s auditing requirements. Communist companies cannot and will not provide transparency. It goes against the nature of communist businesses modes of operation. 

There is bipartisan support for American auditing watchdog PCSOB to require Chinese companies to open their books. China has human rights abuses up the ass. China is actively participating in genocide right now. China uses slave labor. They will never fuking allow auditing to happen.

Being a bull on this stock is the equivalent of being a bear on personal freedom or getting a deal on any sort of consumer good at the individual level. 

Government surveillance is going to ruin us? Bearish on liberty, so be bullish on this stock, because they create the AI and ML models to do it.

Gas prices will never dip to a level that’s advantageous for consumers? Bearish on consumers, so be bullish on this stock, because they optimized the supply chain for an O&G business within a month to ensure maximum profit margin.

Hey guys my wife is fucking the janitor at Goldman Sachs' back office in Bayonne and he said the rug pull is this week.
Yeah set alerts though on underlying resistance points.  If nvda or whatever you sell breaks through that resistance a lot of times it is best to exit the position for a loss or where ever you stand.  You dont want to take a max loss at all.  Sometimes rolling the option for extra premium can help as well if its breaking through the points that you set as alerts. 

Just an fyi, you will not win every time, so you have to be methodical when going theta gang

Had a few 900P the day it went parabolic before the pandemic. Opened a spread because I thought it would slow bleed. Would have cleared about 100K if I hadn’t and only made like 20k
Thats a lot to gamble and not know something UNLESS they frequent this sub

Down 2% in HK so probably not tomorrow.
 I've been a bear, I've been a bull, but I will never understand the millions of retards who are literally obsessed with gold and CRYIPTOCURZENCY... The fuck is wrong with these people? It's all they can talk about.
Bears r fuk.
Wow they may as well be an ore index. Getting short is definitely the deflation trade. Good for a Thanksgiving case spike spook, but the threat of stimmy looms too. Tough call
It doesn’t matter what side your on.  If you lose money tomorrow, just remember that all you need to make youre money back is a warm butthole
I think it opened around 22 but I think anything around 23.50 is safe.
The fuck are you talking about lmao were barely red right now
You need to diversify more. Put half into PLTR stock and the other half into PLTR calls.
But they said diversify. Fuck it, all in PLTR.
It’s going to dip this week then pump up again next week
I'm fine with boring as fuck tbh, tryna recover from an 86k loss so I I dont mind if doing this takes till like May next year to get it all back or something. thanks for the info fam!

Last time IV was way lower. I won big on ZM on previous earnings, but premiums are so high the risk/reward is off for me. For instance, last time I bet $800 on a strangle and made $15k. No way I can place such a small bet this time.

I sold covered calls on XPEV for 22.50 when it had been idle at 19 for weeks. It then proceeded to fuk me good by going to 60.

It was my biggest loss ever, though it technically wasn't a loss since I made money (some), but obviously missed out on 200% gains.
Green Packer WIN = PLTR +16% tomorrow.
RKT please just do something positive.
If you had to ask, you weren't going to do it anyways. Move along.

Not too mention is fucking gay
Yeah don't usually wish ill on people's tendies but if that crowd gets wiped out I won't feel bad.  Not like the fucking company is making the world a better place either.
The MM who sold you the call will be relieved to buy it back from you at market price. Worst case scenario just exercise the call and sell the shares to a sweaty short-seller.

Selling put credit spreads on $JPM when I knew it was going to keep drilling for another day back in July. I jumped the gun and wiped out 90% of my gains. Haven’t done spreads since.
It’ll dip some more 2moro then it’s extra juicy
Have been rolling this strat for a couple cycles, shit pays but is boring as fuck. I got out of my last positions earlier this week (bought them back early when i had taken more than 60% of the gains). Rolled a bunch of my cash on s Argh aye sea and doubled up the next day.  Selling is constant profit for sure, but less action

Monstrously green. But this isn’t that yet
Dude just posted $8 million in PLTR. Means we 🚀🚀🚀, dude probably has insider info, no way he’s gambling $8 million
Buy half at open, half about 30-60 minutes after open.  If GME opens with a hefty gap-up and RSI is overbought, it will usually sell off for the first half hour. If there's no opening gap and RSI is neutral or underbought I'll usually just go in at open.
god damn who was it

Hey
I'd caucus that
Hey 'tards. Fear not. Don’t panic sell. Don’t go cash gang, don’t shed your mighty horns and become rainbow furries overnight. We move this fuckin' market now. Let Cramer, Black Rock and Shitron Eat shit. The dot com bubble burst because they didn’t have WSB back then. PLTR will be a 100B company within months because we say so. Elon will be the first trilionaire because that’s what we want. MMs, pension and hedge funds have to track US now. Shortsellers are being driven into the sea. Price action is defined not by holders but by the marginal buyers and sellers. I don't see another 1.5million-strong retail hive-mind army anywhere else or in our way. We buy EVERY FUCKING DIP all the way to Christmas. We move this fucker.

TL;DR PLTR, TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, NIO, VALE late Dec calls and leaps. More meme IPO's coming. Buy shares too. Also anything that Shitron touches. Cathie Wood has already parked her mile-long penis at their backsides. We just gotta give it a little push.
Gain porn yeah?

Same, selling before market close. Worst case I loose some tendies but I’m willing to settle for a solid gain and don’t risk the high probability of a sell off Tuesday.

Held to 80% loss and sold right before huge rally. The 12/18 40c if I held, would’ve been worth over 3k a piece. The 50c 11/20 would’ve come back from the dead for a 200% gain. Shit still gives me nightmares and I’m still trying to recoup my loss. Am retard

Like the consensus right now among the analysts is they’re saying that Zoom was going to be a good company and had a future regardless of the pandemic. However they agree the pandemic accelerated its growth. But stocks are also forward looking. So I’m contradicted on if that means it will keep growing from here or hit obstacles that deem it not as valuable.

I appreciate when people appreciate that. My parents are well to do and emphasize that they got really lucky too. And early on. Being lucky early is extra lucky. They bought some muni bonds in the 80's. For some reason they got fully paid off, with all yearly payments, after like a year in. So they got the principle, and like 10 years of payments back after sometime like a year. For some reason it made sense for the municipality they lended to to refinance like that. They never understood it.

Agreed I don't think GME will rocket 1000%, but the short squeeze will bring the stock prices up low 30s by EOY an keep it there.
Does this mean we won't get to see that guy eat his own shit?
Alright TSLA, do your thing tomorrow please
I'm making a prediction. FROG will be the next PLTR. FROG is only at a cap of $2B at $70/share. $40B market cap is $1400/share.

I'm basing this prediction on absolutely no fucking logic whatsoever, other than technology, software, cloud, meme, fucking frog, and.. I don't know.. tits?

June $130c's because that's the highest strike. Because.. why not?

Disclaimer: do not invest anything in FROG. It will cause you to lose money. Don't say I didn't warn you.

CRSR has gotten wrecked these last 2 sessions. It’s due for bigly green
My Tesla weeklies are starting to sweat just a little!
lol ok
Lol, gaming is in its infancy? By what metric?

The problem is that GME is completely useless in the new retail paradigm. Especially so as gaming continues to go mobile, and consoles move to digital delivery channels. 

Palantir has the smartest people in the world building systems that allow someone in Tucson, Arizona to shoot a missile up the ass of some terrorist in Syria. GameStop employs minimum wage neckbeards to sling video games to kids. 

Fuckin A, some of the military simulation games available at GME probably use some elements of what Palantir does to move the story line along in the cut scenes. 

As I said, GME might indeed be a better trade, but let's not pretend like Palantir is fairly valued at $50B with as much growth as there could potentially be in the big data/AI space.
Yea I thought so. It looked like RH was going to let me do it with just the cost of starting the contract but I didn’t try to push it through

I think there isn't really a reason for a sell-off. People are just following the trend, which usually results in tendies.
Yeah, I don't know if I would ever want to fuck with that kind of money.
I think it’s more around 20.40. I’ve read different numbers so I could be wrong.. I’m buying calls at $20. Seems to be a win win.

Do you realize PLTR has more call volume on it than any other stock in the market.  It has more call volume than almost Apple and NIO combined!  Do you know what that means?  It means dealers are forced to buy the stock to hedge the risk of the all the call options they sold us.  

The more out of the money call volume on a stock the higher it rises.  And no one can stop it until the call volume decreases.  Every week call volume has increased exponentially.  That means the stock rises exponentially.
Hold until he’s in the HOF my guy.

It was kinda a joke.
Only bullish for one annoying stock
My vix shares actually might print
There's a lot to unpack here and I don't have a complete grasp on all of it.   But here's my understanding as of today:

&#x200B;

The linkage between HPV and cervical cancer was groundbreaking in that it was the first such linkage between viruses and cancer.  But it is strongly believed in the medical research community today that it is not the only such linkage, we just don't know what else, or exactly why.  So yes, there is that angle.

  
Additionally, cancer is caused by regular, repeated protein misfolds.  If we can teach the body's immune system to target those errant proteins the way they do a virus or bacteria, we can use the body's own immune system to eliminate cancer.  There was a trial done some years ago that involved using a modified HIV virus to essentially reprogram the immune systems of a number of patients with end-stage leukemia to target their errant leukocytes, which met with something like an 87% success rate.  I wouldn't be surprised if something similar can be done with an mRNA vaccine.

&#x200B;

And speaking of HIV, there are also efforts working toward an HIV cure that involve a protein mutation found in <2% of the population.  HIV cannot bind with the mutated protein like it can with the standard one.  If you research "the Berlin patient," you'll find info about a patient with both HIV and Leukemia, that was given a bone marrow transplant from a donor with the above mentioned mutation.  Both conditions were corrected.  Current efforts are to derive an injectible HIV treatment from this methodology.  When I'd first heard about it, I'd thought CRISPR, but since such a change would not need to be permanent, I wouldn't be surprised if mRNA were involved instead.
At this point its free money if you can figure out to trade

AMD is looking good to me for an intra-week swing on the 15m chart:

\+ Currently toward the lower half of a long term channel

\+ Recently hit a double bottom at 86.36

\+ In a long term uptrend

\+ RSI is at 48

\+ Analyst rating is $90.41 ▲ (3.74% Upside)

\- MACD is flat / unsure of direction
That’s why you’re a broke human being.
But also, do not let this go down the drain. Congrats!

That is only if the Q3 earnings are real good and people FOMO like a mother fucker. I am seeing Q3 reports are negative and the price will go down to shake off weak hands.
Ugh why we gapping down? Any news?
[deleted]
Uncertain how the vaccine affects their user base. Sure tech that doesn't use teams will still use zoom since many tech companies are going WFH indefinitely for those who can or at least partial WFH so they have a smaller office space footprint. A big factor is will universities and school still utilize zoom even if the pandemic is over say for students who are sick at home or just recording for students to focus more on absorbing content and taking notes versus taking notes.

All very helpful. So you should never really hold an option close to expiration? Why do I see so many YOLO’s where people do this holding to the last day? I’m kidding but also curious.

Also - is there an easy website to find this? I did a quick search and it’s basically a new language.

Thanks again for the advice. Again, it’s very helpful to someone just venturing into the space.

Approximately 70 million shares need to be bought to cover. Until that amount of volume is reached, the shorts literally couldn't have covered. 

That being said, if GME opens at 18, things will get real interesting. But that won't happen. And I am super bullish on GME. That kind of movement won't happen until news.

Buying 100-200 GME shares, depending on PM action. Rolling my 12/4 $35 PLTR CC out to a $44 12/11.
Warrants can be redeemed the later of July next year or 30 days after merger close.  Warrant redemption clause at $20 and $36 so there's very little upside at this price.  The free warrants are nice though, but I doubt they'll be worth much when you get them unless it's an absolute superstar merger.

You said that the difference between Palantir and GameStop is that GameStop is severely undervalued and has massive room to run compared to Palantir?

I countered that, saying that GameStop has a much more obvious ceiling than PLTR. 

The number of shares outstanding only factors into a short squeeze. Otherwise, it is basically irrelevant. Tesla has a metric shitload of shares available as well and it trades at an 1100 or so PE. Palantir has plenty of head room, especially in this market.

I really do believe in the possibility that this will be a triple figure stock in a few years. This is a company that's stayed afloat for 17 years, has managed to become a singular commodity, is expanding into private business outside of government contracts, has Alex Karp and Thiel behind it. They're a winner and very close to profits. I read a report that they're probably not paying taxes in the next few years due to accumulated tax credits. I'm on my phone and don't really feel like looking it up. The future is extremely bright for them.

Hold for 5-10 years and come out happy. Also, absolutely no basis for this speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if they worked with Tesla eventually due to the Thiel-Musk connection.

Growth in the short term might not be as exponential as we've been seeing. Expect some bumpy roads ahead in Q1.
I’m all in with you man. Only $1600 to my name and it’s all in PLTR.

Keep saying the ticker. We will not be silenced
There's not much of a point though. An algo can immediately execute the trade and sell the underlying to capture the arbitrage. A person would have to execute and then risk the movement of the underlying in that time. I'd gladly pay a few bucks to just pass that on to them.

You pronounce it neeyoyou? Interesting
To those buying $PTSH, you know Seth and Guggenheim are planning on holding for 5 years right? Occupying a space within their conservative, wealth-preserving, tight-ass portfolios with all sorts of incentives NOT to lose money.
This isn’t it
Do you question when we go up? Greed index is literally at 92.
Nice ! Thanks !!

What’s your favorite hentai? Mine is Succubus Stayed Life
Almost like money printers are going brrrr.
You can calculate this by factoring the delta of your option into your limit sell for the premium. For example, if my option has a delta of .5 then if the stock was trading at 85 and wanted to sell when it hit 87, i would add 1.00 to my option my premium limit to sell. granted there are other factors like theta, gamma, and vega that can move option prices but as long as its not close to expiration, then calculating for delta is fine.
If calls go on sale tomorrow, I’m going all in.

Thanks, good luck.

Its a tiny ass speculative bet so no biggies.  Amount I have in gold isn't so tiny (but still not that huge) and unlike cry pto that shit might be dumping for years.  Oh well long term ass bets.

You might be right, the rise over the last week or so coupled with expectations of a similar pop to the last ER could cause it to plummet.

I'm mean there's nothing controversial here, BABA is gonna dip over the possibility of the long delay for ANT until 2022, more having to do with getting on the wrong side of the CCP.  But yeah, I'd buy any dip if you're planning to hold longer term.

But a put is about buying the share; you hand over cash. How does holding shares as collateral work for that?

Looks like you have longer duration trades though. I just see that 5-10% potential gain on cash and think what the hell. Worst case scenario I own a stock I would be ok owning for 10 years. I would be curious to know what you learned to be able to somewhat confidently do what you did as it seems to have been done in a non yolo manner. Or was it just in depth research on a few particular stocks?

You realize we are actively squeezing now on GME right? A stock doesnt have 30% down and up weeks without one. 

Most people think GME will be a slow grind up like overstock instead of a kbio or volkswagen although its possible. 

even 5% of shorts covering on GME have enough power to move the stock 10%. 

Its just that the institutions are doubling down more then selling, so thats why SI is going up

30$ by april is a very good possibility

No options - That should have been the TLDR ..meh
>But basically it takes the current stock price, removes $11.50 from it, and whatever the remaining amount would be in shares, you get that many per warrant. 

Could you possibly clarify this? Like $20 - $11.5 = $8.5. I get 8.5 shares per warrant and the cost per share is $11.50?

Stripes valuation is 80-100b so 20% at 4B would cut that valuation to 20B. Even on the low end stripe is worth atleast 50b. The math doesn't work. I do see the upside for stripe though as they would only give up 20%, but I don't think it's stripe.

Meaning if there isn’t a major correction before the end of the year, there’s gonna be a lot of huuuuge rebalancing back into bonds that no ones ready for.  

One can say almost a forced dip/correction.

Think about it, if you own a targeted fund that’s a 60/40 portfolio, and stonks are mooning above 60%, they are forced to sell stonks back to the 60% level and buy bonds to get that back to 40%
Almost like we are in a recession 😑🤡
Huge thank you for the PSTH "No FOMO" post King.

I was market open away from dumping some big money at it for some really short options, read your post, and went long (on shares).  Took me from a negative to a positive on that trade.

I like your sell puts on high premium stocks. PLTR is a great example. Like seriously, I can make 5% on my cash in a week? And if I am forced to buy, I just hold for a decade while selling calls so long as premium is high. If premium stays this high for long you could hold shares at zero cost basis.
Make that money but GME is there as well decertification is key
You’re gonna have a hell of a life living off dividends- fucking congrats man.

not GME? Is it too late to jump on PLTR or TSLA train?
People talking about PLTR's intrinsic strength are missing the point. I've no doubt that it will eventually grow to the targets that people are mentioning here, just that it will not be the best weekly mover, since the move last week was driven by FOMO. Just the fact that there are bearish comments here indicates that FOMO won't be driving its price, so people looking for growth will look elsewhere in the next week.

Not to get snippy about this, but it’s Sunday night and I don’t want to do research for other people. I’ll give you two ways to check this though:

First there are numerous articles on FT, Reuters, even Motley Fool, that have this. Those you can Google. 

Second I read the prospectuses for a number of the largest S&P 500 Index and sector no load mutual funds. There are specific provisions within the fund covenant that state what they can and cannot do. While funds may, at their discretion, attempt to better match the S&P 500 by buying some derivatives, they cannot use leverage as a means to improve the return of the fund. My hey all report assets at the end of every month. They cannot own shares in Tesla in November. They can for the reporting for December. Since they do not report actual acquisition dates they may choose to buy starting on December 1st, though I do not know which fund will choose to do that. I do know some funds have asked their shareholders to vote on when they can acquire TSLA. Some have tranches, some specific dates. All are in December. If you want to check this out, go to the largest no load mutual fund web sites, go for the ones that are specifically S&P500 index funds or S&P500 Sector Index funds. You’ll be able to read their rules and see their holdings as they publish this information online.

I’m knuckle deep in GME but I don’t think it’ll pass $50. If WSB know there’s a squeeze coming evey one else with more than one brain cell knew about it months ago and have been fluffing the retard army so they can pump and dump before we even knew they were doing it.

Im not saying Cohen would do a full buyout I’m saying best case scenario would be a 51% takeover or if he exercised a large amount of itm calls to acquire more shares which would cause shorts to cover because of less available shares. 
The first article I saw on short float said the float was around 20 million then I saw an article stating 41 million then an article stating 48 million so I’m not sure what’s the correct answer on that.
I've been to shrinks on and off over the years.  They've often described it like this:

It's never as bad as I think it is, and if it is, other people do dumber shit and still survive.  I've found that if I could avoid doing it at work, I was able to sleep better.

Out of curiosity, what was your initial capital investment that you parlayed into nearly 8 figures? and what platform do you use for trading?
That's basically the point behind shorting. Companies can afford to short it indefinitely if they truly believe it will go out of business in the next few years. 

So likely a short squeeze won't even occur until when and if GameStop actually gets on track

If a conversion doesnt take place the pfds need to receive full dividend before commons see any

In your case, you are proposing a scenario where Pfds convert to commons, which I think would be favorable terms as the plaintiffs currently have a bit of leverage. Keep in mind that the main plaintiffs and big players are all Pfd shareholders, with the exception of Ackman, who isn't a plaintiff, and did recently purchase Pfds to hedge against dilution.

none, but if you combine it with other stuff like a 20day EMA Wave and idk some RSI value it can be used as an a buy or sell indicator.

depends on your system
I’d take that 100% and run and be happy. Just look at the emerging electric car landscape ( finally) big automakers will have serious entries the next year into the market.  Who the fuck would buy a Fiskar when you have established brands and networks in place.  Says the guy who wants a Polestar. Oh well fuck it. Leaps
Cash takes away from other positions. Sure they will post cash for a while but the higher it runs the larger the margin call will be. With GME closing above 16 you're probably not realizing how much pressure is on the shorts already

Turkey day leftovers make me have puts on ITIS that's going to dump tomorrow premarket
Basically, MMs think its going to tank. They are shorting the fuck out of it. So much so that they are shorting more shares than exist in the market right now. If the price doesn't drop like they think it will, they lose money. If they lose enough money, they pull out of their position. This makes the price jump, this prompts others to pull out of their position. This continues again and again and the price skyrockets. Jump on the train before/if it happens.
Market cap is low enough that I jumped in for some double, triple, and beyond tendies. Im in at $16.

Hey you remember when about 8 years ago you were screwing around on internet forums and everyone was laughing about shitpenny mining being a waste of electricity, and you decided "WTF do I care? I'm not paying for my electricity." So you set up a wallet and started mining with your egg-frying AMD GPU?

I remember that.

I also remember thinking "Holy fuck these loud ass fans are annoying when you're not gaming. I can't even focus on bouncing tiddies, screw this shit." and just fucking forgetting about my shitpenny wallet because it was worth $16 at the time.

And that's the story of how I deleted what would be $80,000 of shitpenny without giving a single fuck.

Just buy shares.  You people need to search GME on this sub.  The idea of the squeeze is not new.   Trying to play it with calls *2 WEEKS* away is worse odds than buying a scratch off ticket.   Play weeklies with a little bit if you need to gamble, otherwise get shares or like Apr calls.

Guys, real quick question. 

Was there ever an iPhone 2, or did it skip straight from iPhone to iPhone 3g?
True. ITM LEAPS are the way to go.
No, but the global platform that brings people together through play will pump to the closest galactic center.
I saw one guy draw "Triple top" pattern on the price grah of the company with 20 years timeframe, and support his claim with "well not exact measure but as we can see on s&p500 graph pattern already proved itself" where the s&p500 one was like 0.5-1year, so yeah WSB is practically geniuses...

A buy out won't cause a squeeze like VW.  Because there will be a "top".  VW didn't have a ceiling, because Porsche had already acquired a controlling interest without any sort of tender offer.

If you get a buyout agreement at $25, there's no reason for a long not to sell this thing at $30.  Or $28.  Or $26.  There would be plenty of sellers for shorts to cover.

The current short volume on GME is 68m.  The float is around 48m.

That is not 3:1.
I’ve noticed that whenever a meme takes off, there almost always was DD posted prior. Just gotta sift thru all the shitposts
PLTR call holders have big cocks.
From the comments about how you'd think we were limiting down from the comments here, you'd think we were limiting up.
$11.50 cost bases sold covered’s for this week expiry at 40 Strike when PLTR touched 32.
you mean the CCP?
If it's parabolic? Probably $300 easily.
Everyone’s still on their zoom meetings, and probably will be for this quarter and the next 2-3 quarters. Even when things return to “normal”, most companies will probably significantly scale back their real estate/travel budgets so Zoom will probably still be used by many corporations and schools, and non profits.  Translation - should be solid top and bottom line beats and guidance should be strong. Idk if we will see a $100 pop but it should be good for folks who are bullish.
Thank you Sir 🤓
I know bro. In hindsight we probably shouldn’t have bet on SPY going to ATH with COVID everywhere, no Black Friday, no stimmy, rising jobless claims lol
AirBNB was already ruled oit by ackman as PSTH was not given access to review books.  Stripe is still in play as we only have Ackman saying that Stripe wasnt ready YET.  That was like 6months back.  Since that time we have some major major coincidences occurring.  First and the biggest should be the buys from institutional investors.  You don't sink major percentage of book into a spac without knowing something.   Second, stripe per the post has been hiring for positions to take it public.  To me its a risk worth taking and starting a small position. 

With that said its a spac and one that has given very little guidance on industry they focus on.  But what we do know is they want an established name.  So no BS company you never heard of.  2 it has the best structure of any spac out there.  They want a company with a moat.

“The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to lower interest rates.“

This is 100% true but it’s completely the opposite of the point you’re trying to make. The lowering of interest rates leads to credit expansion which is inflationary. You were trying to prove that QE is DEflationary, remember?
Sorry bears, I thought you had this one. It’s looking like green by market open. Good luck tho
I think we are in this weird era of trading/investing where everyone thinks the next tech company is a facebook or amazon. 

Really, stocks only go up if people are willing to buy their shares. If no one dumps, the stock maintains its price, regardless of fundamentals. If people keep plowing money in, it'll go up. nothing groundbreaking.

Without demand, a company's share price will not increase.

I mean I agree, I think we are on the verge of it right now, but its a good idea to spread ones assets over a longer time period. Im loaded on everything from dec 4 to July personally.

Id rather advise people in a way that makes them a bit less money, but has a low likelihood of failure and paperhands :)

We have had OI like this before and cratered. I dont thinkbit will happen this time, but then it delidnt seem likely then either

Pretty sure the pump is in spite of authority and aggregate funds, not because of it; if you define it as such. Speculation is more suited IMO.

And be wary buying options if you're new. When I started, I went 200% up my first week and almost got wiped out by the correction in September because I had no idea what I was doing. Look to buy longer dated options when you're starting out so you don't get killed on minor pullbacks.

Yeah FB I’m going to go calm on, but I’m going to YOLO the weak before earnings. Snapchat reports a weak before them, a strong finish also drives FB too. That way I can just sell before FB reports.

This is a big brain thought but Canada's pension system bought around 24 so I have many doubts it would fall too far and would likely rebound quickly. Why would a government's pension system buy a big stake if they thought it was going down quickly? I suppose they could probably be incompetent though.

Futures will definitely be green by open
Sell whenever you want to take the profit (before expirary and before it diminishes (unless it’s going to the moon). You will pay your premium whether you have a profit or a loss. That’s what you paid for the option to buy to the stock. Your profit is $over the strike price minus your premium.
This is the way.
This is a throwaway account. Of course I won't make a real bet with some rando on reddit.

I can do a lame virtual bet though. If a short squeeze happens I bet it will hit $500. I don't know if that will be in the next 6 months (though that seems likely at the moment). Put a remind me if you want.

FWIW, I only hold GME shares and don't do retarded options betting like WSB folks here. Your bet is essentially that :)

Btw, do you understand that fundamentals don't matter during a short squeeze?  If you look at it from a fundamentals view point you will miss out during the squeeze. It is purely technical demand/supply at that point. 

Lookup KBIO squeeze for an example.

Also while you are at it, lookup the insider and institutional holdings in GME to get an idea of how low the supply could be during a squeeze (especially one induced by a forced recall). I presume you are already aware of the amount of short interest.

I went to a startup week event on cannabis companies in Colorado and essentially it's just a total race to the bottom on everything from growing-production-sales.

The broker i trade in has "social network" twitter-like build in its app, and you wouldnt believe the amount of retards that would draw some lines and figurines on the arbitrary timeframe and be like "head and shoulders pattern occured price will rise to 30$". Like not even "go up/down" but fucking precise price range. Fucking dipshits, i dont know jack shit about market but at least i dont pretend like Im fucking expert while eating my crayons that i just finished drawing triangles on graph with.

Maybe.  I went through a stage back in 2001 / 2002 with this kind of thing.  9/11 wrecked my head and I ended up with a debilitating fear of death.  After I saw almost every conceivable way to die / be killed I was able to move past it and haven't looked back.

How did you learn to use something like a regression function for determining stock fair price? Any good resources I could look into for learning these things? Pretty new to the stock market, made some decent gains this year but mostly I feel like I got lucky, would like to graduate past getting lucky at some point.
Oh shoot I didn’t even see that, congrats and well played. I’m glad you got in on the dip on Friday rather than the top. And yes definitely a moving target. I’m just super impressed with Karp (CEO) and I feel like PLTR represents the next iteration of “tech” companies. Something about them solely focused on AI and data integration just makes them unique, and almost operating at a higher level than AMZN, MSFT, AAPL. It’s like an AI pure play on a company that cares about where the world ends up. I guess time will tell

What the fuck are you talking about? You JUST said they don’t expire until January. You’re fine.
I’d argue he needs more
So the most important thing you need to worry about at this point is theta. If you look at the greeks on the option you have, it tells how much money the option loses everyday- and it’s always increasing. On the opposing side, you have delta, or how much the options value increases every 1%. Once you think the theta is going to start overtaking the delta, that’s a good time to sell. However, the number one rule is that “If it’s good enough to screenshot- sell it.” 300% is a massive gain so personally, I’d sell it.

For the new influx of people, mattress king up here is real and actually shares his ideas, unlike this fake-ass bullshit you guys upvote over to 10k (re: "This is true gain porn, not the weak stuff. 120k to 4.8 million in under a year." no trades shown, no understanding of options, nothing...)

Other guy was just peddling his youtube videos, which have zero usable information even for complete beginners, and erased his post.Dude clearly never traded before based on his comments, especially his dumbass tax comments.

Anyone who has traded for more than a week can tell. A real trader will tell you trades in full detail, what they were thinking, how they felt, important news that dropped while they were in a trade for years after the fact, etc…You can try to fake that, but you just end up looking like a dumbass peddling a youtube channel or paid discord. Plus, that guy is now saying he's out of PLTR and that it is a pump and dump and will crash...

Loneliness: I don't get too lonely because I interact online and I'm an introvert.

How I avoid oversharing:  my most prominent thought when talking with someone is, "don't say anything".  So, when I do say something, it's very little.  I don't tell stories, don't talk about the stuff I'm into, etc.
Assuming you're not trolling:
When a stock goes up 50% in a couple days, it's going to have a pullback. A lot of people are blaming Citron for tanking it and they were definitely a catalyst, but the stock was already in overbought territory and had almost doubled in value on practically nothing.

It’s always been an open sub - why isn’t it more evenly split based on population? Is there an scientific or evolutionary explanation on why women tend to participate in less risky activities? Also would explain why unicorn start-ups are entirely founded by men, even though it’s a free market.

 Diamond hands, always.
Whats the moves for this week?
Trash panda
Yeah, and I work in the multifamily industry. 30M-40M facing eviction? That’s a year of heavy turnover. I build that into the pro forma, and the expense is a PITA but completely manageable. And my rents aren’t going to drop, either, because people who lose their homes have to go somewhere... like cheap suburban apartments.

It’s also offset by the fact that every apartment complex in suburbia has flat rent growth at worst. Also, not to be callous... but people who rent do not drive the economy and never have. People who own do.

Mortgage delinquencies are at an all time high? You’re a banker. You’ve been extending and pretending for almost a year; why wouldn’t you do that again with a vaccine in sight? And 3.5M homeowners? Congrats, the math says that we will go from 2.4 months of supply on the market to at worst triple that, which would be 7.2 months of supply. Totally manageable.

Housing prices may flatten, but there’s just an insatiable demand for housing during a pandemic and flat out the country isn’t building enough of it. Until that core supply issue is resolved — and pro tip, it won’t be — the trend line for the price of a starter home will be up, up, up, even accounting for booms and busts.

I did my research
Same. I sold a bit early but still worth it. there was a 10min window to sell at the top before it took a dive idk why anyone would hold when it’s up 14% the first 10min at open
It’ll naturally purge itself soon enough
I’m hodling my PLTR. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

Why is the ticker banned? I’m long this shit too
Ophtho. See 30+ elderly pt's a day, a significant percentage of whom are demented and can't understand why they can't see or what needs to be done. 700-800 surgeries a year with pt's angry if they aren't 20/20. National average complication rate is about 0.5%, so dealing with bad outcomes every couple of months. 

Grinding as hard as I can and throwing a ton of money into the market because I cannot do this job forever. Pays very well, but looks like TSLA and PLTR calls pay better.

Nice, just added you to my list of people to sue. Luckily I made out like a bandit on NIO calls so I have a fucking ridiculous amount of money at hand to go ape shit with my legal team, I already put 100k on retainer. Shits gonna get real 2morrow.
I’m confused. Is -0.22% considered down bigly? Or are you guys just expecting futures to go down further?
Thats true. Thank you for a legit answer. I just see so many "gamblers", yet never any actual profit and losses from futures considering the leverage.
It works that fast?
Hell yes 🚀🚀🚀

Alright don't have much free money but I got $800 to blow, what do I YOLO in?
The max gain is well over 100%, max loss is only 100%.

That means, only a small percentage of your holdings should go into such high-risk prospects. If it pays off.. it pays off big. If it reaches $500k, you're up big with even a few thousand invested.

I have 3% of my net worth in cripto. Non-issue if it goes to zero, but I could easily double my NW if it skyrockets.

The most horrifying and rewarding thing I've ever done. If you a true gambler and realize to keep your plays small you could have some fun. Only if you're used to options and the insane gains and losses.

How do you know that index buying starts tomorrow and hasn't already been happening?
If that happens, the stock price will be much higher. Though if it doesn't happen, the stock price will be 0 🤣

Probably a decent amount, I saw  an "influencer" I follow talk about beginning her trading adventures yesterday and wants to teach people how to invest. She was pumping NIO and PLTR.

We are funding our own demise. It will be worth driving the cyber truck for 2 years before we all get AI installed into our brains after the concentration camps!🚀
Motley Crue lyric about living life on your own terms got to be willing to crash and burn lol.
If my PLTR puts print tomorrow it's gonna be bittersweet because I'm not gonna be able to celebrate here with you retards. All of you fucks are holding calls
Agreed. For me hedging is selling a little to lock in gains.
Sometimes it do be like dat doh
Yep. There's a lot of retard cash to swindle out of these idiots.
Kind of sucks for small accounts and you can’t trade them on Robinhood. So WSB is out.

These adderall junkies get like this over a 0.5% move, don't get spooked by the autists, anon.

Not to mention that PLTR will know everywhere that’s received a vaccine..valuable big data money. Or there’s laws on that shit idk I didn’t research but I am invested.
LOL and I was all butt hurt over my 50 NVAX shares @17 I sold at 21... thanks for the perspective.
Exactly, the leverage is just ungodly. All about proper management. Small sizing is God.
if only i bought more
😂
Leverage is absolutely insane, and most of the kids in here don't have enough to meet the initial margin requirement.
You buy PLTR calls on Fridays at the bottom and sell them on Wednesday. You then buy puts at the top on Wednesday and sell them on Friday.
You holding BABA before House vote that potentially could lead to delisting bunch of chinese companies?
So much upside. Can't wait to see it gap up like CII C did.
Hey guys, I’m kinda new here. What happened to ptlr? (I think that’s how you spell it lol) I bought calls on Friday and it went down :/ what’s the next play, boys?
Sure hope so 💥🚀💥🚀💥👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️

Because most of this sub is now pltr ai including myself.

The current consensus is GME. Jump on the wagon before it's too late.
For the poors like me consider doing a debit call spread ATM on TSLA this week. Should go up but calls are expensive.
Just curious, is there a certain place to put stuff about auto mod acting up, or should I just use general mod mail? For instance, I had [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3lje9/coronavirus_gains_got_out_in_august_but_excited/ge3pkth/) comment removed for “low quality”. I don’t mind that much, however I don’t think it’s necessarily something that should be removed. Thanks for helping out
Why though? It'll pass the House but it'll die in the senate? Would the market really care when it passes the House since it won't go anywhere? I'm not trying to be an ass I just want to know if I should jump in as well to get those tendies
No man, they want us to have money to spend in there stores
As opposed to being retarded and losing your house
I bet she likes anal.
Pick an OTM call strike for ZM for 12/4, and I'll sell it for tomorrow's earnings for fun.
Remember guys, this week the House votes on making Chinese companies listed on US exchanges comply with audit oversight rules: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-to-vote-on-booting-chinese-stocks-from-u-s-over-audit-rules-11606518590?reflink=e2twmkts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-to-vote-on-booting-chinese-stocks-from-u-s-over-audit-rules-11606518590?reflink=e2twmkts)  


If the House passes it, it goes to Trump to sign into law. Which means it's guaranteed to become law.

Should see selling pressure across the board on all Gyna shares as people derisk into the vote.
Robinhood needs to add it
PLTR to the moon this week. Bulls stand up.

Funny and very true story, I was in law school talking to a professor about Jesse Livermore’s death right before crim-law started. I don’t remember how it happened but somehow she ended up googling Tracy Lynn Livermore because she was identified as his kin and let’s just say thank god it happened right before class started and only 10 people instead of 150+ saw 😂
Hope all my THiCkBois are ready for some fireworks tomorrow. Some big bids on Bloomberg after hours Friday.

The problem with the news is they talk about stuff that’s already *happened.*  What you’re looking for is stuff that is about to moon, or die (if you short it) that hasn’t done so already. News just brings retail in so the pros can sell to them at a profit. Don’t waste your time with news.

For the money you spent, you could've bought like 8 4/16/21 $200 leaps.

Bought one a couple weeks ago for $75 and it was up 64% when DIS was at $151 a few days ago.

Considering how much DIS usually moves intraday, [this](http://opcalc.com/hTT) doesn't *look like* a winning trade.
when and if i make money. yes.  my threshold is high.  5 or 10k does nothing for me.

One thing you need understand about this place is that it is basically just 4chan wearing reddit as a disguise. half the time the mean comments are actually compliments, half the time they actually mean what the mean, and the 3rd is complete nonsense and the poster doesn't even know what they mean \\.  


Most people assume newbies are 16-18 year old's who don't understand the concept of money, debt, liabilities and assets ( learn those last too as well ) and are just here to yolo $100 bucks on whatever the last retard has said is a winner.   


but anyway, good man ! you will return here with a much better understanding of the stock market so god speed my friend !!!! i hope your future is full of happy green lines and ill see you in tendie town in the near future.

Oh I’m envious of that trade. I tripled my position on the pullback, but I am happy to say that the SEDG stock I bought in late 2016 has seen a 1000% R.O.I. This far, too bad it was only 50 shares.

Makes sense. Was just curious because I bought the ipo and believe in palentir as a legit company long term, but might sell if it spikes too hard over the next month and re-enter at a lower price. Looks like you got in around 29$ so 90$ would triple your equity, seems like a reasonable time to sell. Thanks for the answer and all the best dude
Considering A P X - T tomorrow. Will it moon?
Ackman is long equities and a lot of other hedge fund managers are long equities rn. Calls might take slight hit but shares are pretty strong rn

All my calls are 2022 or even 2023. Most of my calls are in the money with a smaller number OTM. This way I can survive bad news that can hit any stock at any time. I sell when my options expire in six months or so and roll that over to 12-18 months.

Interesting play for sure. I believe they have a meeting on the 4th of December where they are expected to extend their merger deadline. A lot of people are seeing this as bullish. There's also a rumor floating around that Microvast will supply batteries to Tesla. IMO it is a good play since it has a ton of hype and you can expect it to explode if their merger with Microvast is announced.

Why wouldn’t it?
Yeah I sold out of positions on Friday just to lock in gains from the week. I figured we’d get a week of rally as is the Tesla way but I wasn’t too sure what we’d be seeing down the line as we get closer to inclusion.

Yes, but it won’t be “set order when stock hits $X price”. Basically you have to calculate what your option will be “roughly” worth when a stock hits a certain price. 

Kind of a pain. It would be nice to have an option that says “sell call option for whatever it is selling for when the stock price hits $X”

I've been saying that I didn't see how big money could be excited to buy after prices were pushed up by retailers last week. Made the most sense to me to dump, force out some paper hands, and then swoop in for the next rally. Still not convinced tho, green by 7am
Agree
They do this every weekend, a little red and it's bear parade time. When the market opens green you don't see them anymore.
Yup if you get in early though you can make some serious cash
I mean I think a lot of market forces are converging right now and at least some sectors will have to give. Big picture wise, our country has low growth and massive debt pretty much locked in. The question is whether we will return to deflation which combined with the last two is a boring stock market, or inflation which will make the markets (or at least specific sectors) boom.

Good choice. I’d buy 1 2021-2022 call instead if you could swing it, cause ah aphria has a monster balance sheet, good immediate past performance, industry which captures the interests of many, and a solid name. If you were to do it this week though buy a real number, like 8 and it will work just as well if not better.
PLTR to $5
I use TD but I’m also only 5 months into trading, what’s the issue with the app exactly? And what’s ToS?

Well....got my $TNA shares called away on Friday/Saturday. Now, I guess I’ll flip over and sell cash-secured puts which will be around $300+/week in premium. Deep down, I’m hoping for a quick dip on small caps just so I can sell more CSP but whatever.

Let's say you discover that your favorite stock is going to have an event that causes a massive sell-off next year, on the 2nd of July.

Open the calendar on your phone.

Set an appointment for 9am on the 1st of July (day before the event).  Enter a description for what you're supposed to do with your favorite stock on the following day.

On the day before the event...your alarm on your phone goes off at 9am to remind you that you need to do something with your favorite stock.

Also set a reminder for the morning of the event.

Yeah, the squeeze is already happening, and since you have a veritable shit ton of 2-5% holders in managed funds with exit points all over the place (probably LOADs in the $22-$24 range), you're never going to get the sorta squeeze these peen heads think is going to happen.  It's a slow grind squeeze.  They'll all be out on a 5% down day from paper hands, and then we can stop seeing this idiocy.
SPACs can be a good place to park funds and wait for a pop. Some are great to hold through merger and others end up like HOFV.

Not typically. Example: twice was focused around name changes. So once the name changed I just sold once profit hit “ can’t hold” levels. So that’s an example of after. Same with Gme now. Originally thought just till consoles are out but obviously it’s evolved a lot and I have a comfortable enough gain cushion to hold

IRAs are treated differently than a non-retirement brokerage holding. They are their own specialty.


You are not taxed on the ownership change/inheriting it. And you can move the IRA between brokerages without any tax issues. But cost basis won't matter, and tax treatment on distributions varies from tax-free (ROTH) to taxed at income rates (all other IRA types).


Inherited IRA distributions can be forced over time (can't defer taxes forever). The required distro can vary depending on previous owner (individual or estate; once inherited, twice inherited, etc). IRAs are their own thing.

FWIW I noticed in the option chain the same thing that happened to Tesla a few months ago so it seems to me that a short squeeze is very possible in the short term.

It's an enormous stretch to make VW and Tilray comparisons.

VW was locked up 96%.  Porsche had 76%, and the German state had another 20.1%.  Neither stake could be sold.  The short to float was 12:1.

Tilray was 80% locked up by Privateer.

The short to float on GME is about 1:1, and there's *at most* 20% of the float in any sort of "unsellable" position.

Further, those stocks had carries that were *way, way* into the triple digits.  The tradeable floats were miniscule.

Loaded up on VXX at $17.  Seemed obvious to me that it was the best play.  Lowest level since before the crash.  Vaccine accepted Dec 10th, followed by run off election on Jan 5th to determine senate majority.  Add in covid cases rising, lockdowns, shutdowns etc.  seemed like it was too easy.
nobodies reading that shit
cool bro. good luck to u and keep us updated!
I tend to, but I've learned not to.  I'm getting better at it.
`PLTR` has your back.
This is the way.
Get in before it increases. I fucked myself on PLTR not believing the power of the meme.

Thanks, I think people on the sub are a bit fatigued with pumping posts and rockets without any basis and your spelling error aided in discrediting your post further. I personally don't find anything appealing with DIS but would look forward to your post to see what you have for us.

I wouldn't set a series of limits as that will relieve the pressure on the shorts by allowing them to buy shares to cover their position. If / when it kicks off, you'll notice a sharp rise in GME share price, keep an eye on it and sell it >100 or set a stop loss that's incredibly high. There are a few posts on this sub about this exact play. Have a search and read.

The problem with this article is the framing. The economy is in the shitter right now and stocks are at ATHs.

The question isn't "is the post-covid economic recovery real?" The question is: "what happens to stocks when life goes back to normal and we look around and realize every stock is overbought to shit?"

GME was priced at <$200m.. The market had it priced wrong since the bankruptcy narrative was pushed so far and only recently proven to be incorrect. It is re-rating. So yes, it is fundamentals because the company is worth more than what it is priced at and shorts have not covered. SI has only increased from 55m to 70m in the last few months.

Never said anything about a squeeze either so how do i have a fucked up view??

The person asked for the reasoning of the green line. Yeah Ofcourse up or down but it will be a big breakout from the pattern instead of these $1-$2 intraday swings
A lot of paper hands sold PLTR on Friday when the stock didn’t go straight to $40. I wonder if big money will buy the premarket dip, or if the sell off will continue?

I’m just hoping we don’t set off my $25 stop order. But w/e I got in at $18 green is green
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fuck isn't PLTR moving? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want PLTR to $100. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought stonks were easy???? This is so fucked.

Yo, I also have OCD. There's this amino acid called N-A-C (n-acetylcysteine) that's sold at grocery stores for mad cheap that has been found to treat OCD. Theres a bunch of literature on it, actual studies and shit. Most times supplements are recommended for shit it's absolute nonsense, but this is actually different. Like psychiatrists are now prescribing this stuff. I recommend taking a look at some of the research and trying it out. I guess it doesn't work for everyone but it's done wonders for me. The Jarrows time release brand is like 20 bucks for a bottle and is really well formulated.
Stm supposedly is getting a contract from space x , pretty cheap and the volume on calls is insane

If you could outright buy the VIX, you would always buy when it's below 20, since the returns would be asymmetric.  Too bad you can't do that or you have to buy a related product like VXX/VIX options with decay.

But I’m down like a Clown

So I sit my balls on some calls

The problem is knowing when you’re at the peak. A squeeze may be small, it could be massive. You could be a airing for $40 when you it’s only $30, and there’s so many auto traders that will beat you out everytime if you don’t sell before the price drop.

GME will probably be fine short-term, but I’m just not seeing how they will keep up w/ someone like Best Buy when you can get a video game and any other tech services all under the same roof. If they can offer something the other guys can’t or just start getting ahead of current trends, I 100% see GME coming back into the spotlight.
Bro I do that shit too but still manage to exercise, eat right, and do other shit.

But honestly take that break and work on yourself, you got this.

Not on stake, no need for a margin account to spend unsettled funds. The fees on IBKR are pretty miniscule yes, I'll definitely use my IBKR account if they allow me to use US options! 

I need to contact someone from IBKR to see if they'll allow options on my account as most brokers don't allow New Zealanders to trade options on US stocks because of a regulation law here in NZ.. Which sucks.

Wow. Bringing me way back.
The increase in price creates a large exception for performance, like anything priced this highly, failure to meet our expectations will result in a drastic pullback. However, it is a leader in a market space that is just beginning. If 10 years from now PLTR is a leader in this new market space, well then it could easily be worth 500 billion or more.
lol were you not here for the split announcement?
probably bc it’s on an upward trend and ppl are expecting a short squeeze to happen any day now. and they saw a huge gme gainz post
I got in at 12 and made my 10k off them. If they shit the bed tomorrow ill watch and pick up long dated calls in a day or two depending on how hard it sinks.
It averaged up comfortably until the recession fucked it. Then after that we see it skyrocket.
As long as its above your buy price its gains right? Sell for gains..

Wow WSB cured hunger during thanksgiving, they control the entire market according to the members, and they’re now an advertising agency. WSB IPO imminent.
Nah fam you good
it's the largest company in the world, it can't move more than 1%. Think of the scale involved.
Use my phone to set an alarm for the morning before the event.
It helps dude. We got 1.6m members now. Think about the shit your not seeing getting removed
I like to imagine that there’s a small human just gently sucking on the back of our eyes to hold them in place
What a legend. They tell him to cash out and he puts more in.
THC 🐝
Lol I have no clue, I'm terrible with remembering movies, but OP's post sparked a vague memory along those lines. I go to bed drunk alot though so I might as dreamed it. If I did op can double dip off the movie rights.

Oof.
For so many people who bought PLTR at $10-15, and made 5 figures on it, y’all seem pretty desperate for it to rise nearly 50% at open lol.
squeaks matter
You mother fucker
Yes
How is retarded school anyways
M1 runs great, good long as usual
Just had an ace in the hole, tomorrow green confirmed
Damn did he really?

Also it clearly means CHWY puts
Damn Biden already busted a foot.  Going to fall and bust a hip before his first term is over.  Hopefully Trump shares the POTUS life alert with him.

 GME obviously
See you next week retard
Hey, im scared of options too and hardly trade options. Can you please post some of your trades? btw thats a impressive gain!
How so?  Lotta shit talking on the discussion page
Yea I would buy puts but the volume on those options are straight trash
Its gonna be hard to sleep tonight because ima be obsessing over PLTR and the stock market in general
I think its due for a move up. Been trading sideways for ever
Oh no its a fuckin auto mod u loser. It doesnt even know how to read
for sure, PLTR is cringe. Everyone who sold out of NIO and went to PLTR is gay
How cool is it that our balls don't just dangle. They have a little pouch.
Nervous?  If you got a long dick you are long on pltr.
About 60 hrs ago
47/48 if opec talks go well
Why is everyone so bullish on GME?

I’m now worried for my GME calls.
You already know it's time
You can get an abyssal whip for a couple shares well
Rip
I think the hype could actually hurt it. Lotta weak hands jumping in. But if it triggers the squeeze it triggers the squeeze. If not again Ryan Cohen is the end all not this earnings.
The good thing about PLTR is that we’ve seen a ton of institutional investors. The bad thing is that WSB retarda are the REAL hedge funds now.
This is the way.

Bought 26k in shares at $20, put another 35k in right at the top before the drop. I regret nothing. 2345 shares @ $26 average. If I had more money to throw at it, I would.

Some of the best action sequences ever shot are in this film and PLTR Bull Gang over everything.
as a fellow gay bear, I am interested why you think CCL will drill
Be sure to post that loss porn
Once I double my account on STM, I'm going all in on shares

CRSR pumped to 50 then dumped. I would expect the same
Neither could he. Kid mixed up 2 parallel lines with a rectangle.
PLTR
If it opens over 33-35, I’m selling. And moving on to other plays that are cheaper.
man kids on instagram flip a pair of yeezys for like 50 bucks and all the sudden they're motivational speakers loooool 😂😂😂
finished my retarded school assignment 🤡🤡🤡

let’s get these gainz 🤑🤑🤑

APHA TLRY TSLA GME FROG brrrrrrr
I was there
12/19 100c
Gotta add that margin in there $$$
Go eat cauliflower you bull bitch
Yeah you can buy them back at a loss if you are afraid of losing your shares, but ideally you would only ever sell covered calls that you are okay with getting exercised. 

It's also not the best idea to buy back at 50% necessarily. Lets say you buy 100 shares of amazon at $3,200/share and sell a covered call for a strike price of $3,400. The best thing that can happen is that the call expires with amazon trading at $3,399. Your call won't get exercised so you keep your shares, and now you've had growth of $200/share or $20,000 + the premium. If you want to keep selling calls you can't actually use the $20k in growth but now your new strike price will be even higher than your cost basis so you're probably happy to keep selling calls even if you get exercised because you'll be making a lot on the growth of your shares.

What's peach bee?
My uncle told me to buy PLtR this weekend. Bought puts
Market movements are 100% a personal attack
so whats the short squeeze approach? set a series of limits so that your shares sell in pieces as it rides the spike?

Expect the unexpected at open fellas
Lockup over, bullish momentum and recent flow activity. Looks like it’s filling gap back to 85.
any day that the squeeze is not happening is getting in early.

Yes but you have two years to manage the position.

A two year leap, theta is not the first thing that should pop into your mind. It is long exposure with a lower capital requirement than owning shares.
Sometimes they do. And if they do to stop the disorientation place a cup over the eye.
I see the reasoning. But at the same time. I was already up. You can play with smart percentages and use those gains to leverage advantage for yourself. Made no sense to just cash out. Now coming up to the end of the year and when I owe real taxes is a different thing.
Alota people about to lose money on PLTR.
I’m in at 11.84 , how many shares do you have?

When would be a good time to sell PLTR (other than never of course🚀🚀) but seriously how long do I stay in this, I don’t want to hold on to shares and then the pumping stops and I’m left with the dump to sell at a loss.

Nah probably because of their low market cap
Apples and Oranges with these 2. APHA actually sells cannabis whereas GRGW provides the equipment to grow it.

Both have been strong as of late, but I feel like you are better with GRGW long-term (as more and more states legalize the devil’s cabbage)
Great story and good watch. Dude wasore rainman than rainman was. Never even spent it. Which granted is what saved his ass but true autist for sure
In the few short years I have been on WSB, I’ve noticed one thing. Once the gain porn hits the front page for a certain ticker, you’ve already missed the boat.
Damn... weathering those crashes is quite impressive. Well done.

Alrighty! Let’s get a week of proper red, limit down days. So I can stop being cash gang then ☺️☺️☺️
I bought shares at the high. My bad bro
12/4 35C
well played, you two
NIO is kind of a long term play at this point. Will likely be around $200 midway through 2022
[removed]
I bought in at $19, I’m just saying if it dips badly tomorrow a lot of volume is going to be scared to touch it for the short term But it’s honestly bound to hit past $40, just give it time.
What makes you think CCL will dip? If anything I see a run up this week because 1. PFE vaccine approval date is on Dec 10. And 2. PFE vaccine has arrived in the U.S from Belgium this weekend- seems bullish to me but that could mean fuck all at this point

Its going to go from cring to crying when your loss becomes real
Thoughts on when the GME short squeeze will happen? To me it already looks like it’s about to take off (a strong close over 16).
Damn I hope PLTR doesn't drop under 24 at open - I know it is a long shot but  just need to get out a little in the green before it is too late tomorrow
Yup.
I have a secret play that's a guaranteed 10 bagger. Ill fill yall in after I get em

You can pour 100000 hours into GME without a basic understanding of the market. 

You realize even if 10% shorts covered thats enough for a sizeable move in gme right? Even 5%....

Once again, you people have some fucked up worldview of what short squeezes are. They happen every fucking day. Every few years we see some crazy shit like volkswagen, kbio etc.

Stocks dont move the way GME does because of FuNDaMenTals lol. We literally have +30% weeks and -30% weeks.
Well yea, because we are worse investors lmao
The magical thinking on the DDs of this made me retarded

Can't sleep, so deep in QS, all I want to do is sell at open, stressed

I've really enjoyed my time here but time to move on.

When you inherit something, you can either elect to use the basis of the departed or elect a new cost basis within the 6 months following the point of inheritance. If the investments have appreciated since the original owner purchased them, you will likely benefit from a stepped up basis. I'm not super familiar with how an inherited IRA is treated specifically vs inheriting the stocks straight up, but this is for sure the case with inherited investments and *probably* is the case with an IRA. Talk to a professional about a stepped up cost basis and they should be able to handle everything for you. Sources: Accounting degree, [https://investor.vanguard.com/inherit/irs-taxes#:\~:text=The%20cost%20basis%20of%20the,the%20investments%20in%20the%20account.&text=You%20may%20benefit%20from%20a,owner%20paid%20for%20the%20investments](https://investor.vanguard.com/inherit/irs-taxes#:~:text=The%20cost%20basis%20of%20the,the%20investments%20in%20the%20account.&text=You%20may%20benefit%20from%20a,owner%20paid%20for%20the%20investments). Regardless, you will only pay taxes for this year if you sell the investments.

if you don't stop talking nonsense I am going to shove my 12/04 30c's down your throat you cuck.
They weren’t wrong for telling you to cash out. It was a smart route to take. However, I am guessing you had more insight/DD than what you see on WSB, thus you were confident in letting your money ride for bigger gains.

Moving out of NFLX, going for 100 shares of EA, selling covered calls, moving into CCL upon projected dip this week, selling covered calls 2.00 above the money. Using contract to accumulate TSLA.
I was looking to sell around 1/3 off at $20. Another 1/3 at $25 and the rest at $30. Not too sure myself though.

Not looking good for anyone out there. Bulls or bears. you should just assume the worst case scenario for yourself and worry about it constantly.

Burberry meant to tweet GM but tweeted GME because he is going to short squeeze GME with the help of WSB and Ryan Cohen will commit a hostile takeover and make gamestop the chewy of amazon then everyone will hold and make a crillion dollars and no one will paper hands and ruin the plan when citron tweets that the stock is too high and WSB def won't move on to another meme stock in a single week.

Some of you are so uptight you can't actually read between the lines. "It's not going anywhere" is a reference to the fact that as a long-term play it will be a good play; there's little risk of any severe devaluation due to hype and such.

A bubble is a bubble because no one knows when it’s going to pop.

You can save reddit posts you know.
Check usernames. Like the same 3 guys with outs are spamming PLTR hate. A sell off Friday would have been natural. Citron pretty meaningless. I don’t think it will do 20% every day but it will end week over 34....which means those who bought shares low are happy.
Nah. (Not a bear).
Is NIO & PLTR dead? What’s the next meme stock
Depends how Monday goes tbh but if it does well it will keep going up in the coming months with a few dips. Just buy shares and be happy
Is it green again? Man some of y’all need to chill, you’ll make your money. Just be smart bout selling at the right time gentlemen.

Wait till TQQQ and the other leveraged dog shit funds have to slap the market bid. It will be shocking to see how fast this shoots up. I’m expecting something similar to ZOOM. Wall Street has perfected the “pump and hold” with these type of etfs. The 200m volume on Friday has to be eye opening as well citadel is gonna pump this thing to the moon this week (and make a fortune off of selling weeklies)...get in boys we are to fukking Neptune.

I made a ton and bought Logitech last couple weeks when Corsair price was around 42-48 while logi was about 81. You’re honestly playing a guessing game as you need to assess what you think the company’s worth. The forward P/E is less than 20, which isn’t too expensive and amd+nvdia supply chain issues will spread out corsair’s bottom line. The question is: will Corsair be able to keep up the strong free cash flow or is this year a one hit wonder? Even if they have another good year, how would the market receive it? MU traded at 8-18x multiple over the last few years bc people thought what they were doing was unsustainable. No one really knows at this price they’re just guessing. They could self-fulfilling prophecy this shit all the way back up to 48 or vice versa. I have a lot of variables in my regression function to help me determine if the value of the stock is over/undervalued and honestly the stock is fairly valued around 36-48.

Yes a 300% change in a day on a weekly call option is common. Dumping isn’t really a thing except on true pump and dump schemes, people will just sell their shares if it goes high enough on most stocks. Don’t chase the short term gain though, long term is much more reliable

I made a similar post on this a few years ago. Honestly I would advise against it. There is a time benefit to money - assuming you will not make a profit, ask yourself “is there anywhere that these loans be used to immediately benefit me?” 

Even if the answer is no - you have the potential to lose dollars that you may not able to immediate repay. Once those dollars are lost, you will now be charged interest for dollars that you did not even use. 

TLDR: It’s a bad decision, given that you can’t guarantee you will profit from trading equities.
Yea its very possible. Im not disagreeing

Im just saying the kids on this subreddit think a short squeeze means volkswagen when that doesnt have to happen for a short squeeze to occur..

The fact that they reported it is fucking retarded. He's either hurt or he's fucking not. Some stupid negative news over the weekend is some stupid as political bullshit and I blame the democrats for this red.
Question for traders who’ve been in the game longer than a year: has it always been like this? Have options always been so hot and bothered with run ups gaining 300% in a week, then dumping, then another one pops off? I’m just trying to gain a sense of what’s normal in a market.

>Stake also allows you to trade on unsettled funds after selling off shares, instant buying power so to say. 

No need for a margin account to do that? I'm still on my first portfolio but I'm planning to make another one later on in another platform just for long term plays on shares alone — and maybe Forex. That being said, IBKR's fees are pretty minuscule so far. They just made me take this quiz before letting me do options.

I don't think you understand that most Chinese companies *do* only list on the Shanghai and HK. The ones you see are A) representative (You don't buy NIO, you buy shares that mimic NIO, super complicated) and B) a very, very small portion of the actual market for China. 

Go look at a stock screener specifically only for Chinese companies listed on US exchanges and you will see it looks like China (or any country actually) doesn't do any business whatsoever. It's paltry compared to the actual nature of the market size. 

Also, there are other major complications regarding Chinese companies but that's another matter. Basically not everyone is out to list on American exchanges because most companies don't need that level of capital to succeed.

Yeah like 80 percent of the time it's bullish but this is how you get wrecked like in September.
> but to claim that reserves are dead money that can only be used as collateral is hilariously wrong.

No it isn't.  It's exactly correct.  Bank reserves are not legal tender the same way bank deposits are. OP's explanation is 100% exactly how it works.  

&#x200B;

If what you said is true, M2 would increase at the exact same rate as the fed's balance sheet.  This isn't the case.  If they don't create new loans against these bank reserves, these reserves do not under the system. The fed can't create broad money, only base money.

its scary, its still gamestop ya know? While WSB might be all over it, we saw what one short-squeeze can do. I think if you went 17.5 for 2 weeks out or drop to 16.5 for this week thats a solid play. The two weeks out seems even better, you don’t have to jump in tomorrow, you can get a feel for the trend or get a discount or see that 17.5$ might not be remotely relevant anymore

The lowest is $0 but realistically
I mean you cant compare futures now to what they were back in the early stages of the pandemic. Back then there was much more uncertainty and also actual stimulus being passed. 

Now that everything is more stable a 1%+/- move on futures means a lot more. But with the vaccine pump that will probably be announced Monday I'm thinking it will be green by open

It seems to me the way we all win is to find good companies that are sort of overlooked or not valued as highly as peers and bring them to the attention of fellow retards. of course the people in them the earliest will make the most money but that hardly seems like a problem.

There is a risk of the meme stocks becoming simply captive to the people who can yell the loudest, which would be a problem. As much as we hate to read we've all got to do some DD before deploying our capital.

Having said that, having WSB all in on a stock you would have invested in anyway, pretty awesome.

fr, in this day and age there's no point for the market to be 9:30 to 4:00.

Personally I'll be VERY bullish on this company, here's why;

1. Extremely large and loyal user base that's ever growing by the month EVEN in a pandemic! People were still traveling within 300 miles of their permanent home.
2. Different sources giving different numbers but they average 5-7 million listing world wide, as the millennial and zoomer become the majority AirBnB will become the trendy, more modern, "classy" type of stay for vacations.
3. AirbnB has a 18B valuation with a 30B+ IPO , it's only growing by the month. 
4. The leadership seems to be VERY tech & forward thinking (targeting the next set of age group/always thinking of the future.
5. Although they have a few hurdles they need to get through, I'm sure it won't be a huge hassle that will slow them down drastically.
It means gold will continue to die.

If IWM continues to drop 0.75% per hour until open, I’d be game for that.

I thought they were only getting 6.5 million doses by end of the year? US infecting more than that in a month.

Really? The trend is so bullish and the hype on here is insane. You don't think it'll pick up 10% even on an intra-week high?
Yes. There’s no point in exercising and holding shares. Just sell the option because of the additional time value.
Problem is you would likely time it wrong and get wiped out 🤦🏻‍♂️

Every time this subreddit freaks the fuck out over a 0.05% move in futures I fall for it because I make the mistake of assuming that surely no one is actually dumb enough to refer to that amount of movement as "drilling". Perhaps I am the real retard here for still not realizing how god damn dumb the people REEEEEEing over futures are. Like clockwork, every Sunday night.
Dems did the same. Add stuff irrelevant to covid relief.
This is completely ignoring the hedging necessary to sell options with a reasonable degree of risk.
Based on the technicals and elliot wave theory, we could be up or down bigly. Waiting for confirmation on the ema retrace to see a bounce on the 50 day bollinger bands. After that, I’ll analyze the hezma charts to see if there’s a chance to test new highs and or lows.
Made 50k, kept 40k worth of common, any future profit compliments of the house 😎

Fair enough. I think Dem mobilization won’t be as high as it was to vote against Trump, and that Dem failures in other senate races portends another loss here. 

But I love ICLN regardless, fantastic performance ETF. I put most of my winnings on ITM calls for 7/6/21, it’s free money.
Just giving yourself a false hope, take it all out and yolo it on PLTR/GME calls, may as well lose it all in one day and be over with rather than it slowly bleeding out
It’s ok bud. It’s still going up, it’s not too late for you.

The only question; what will price be at IPO?
That's not Apple's fault though.  Tried using my PC to buy options on Robinhood, and their shit script crashed it every time the options chain was a mega-cap.  It's so poorly fucking optimized for browsers.  Apple is shit though.
No, they didn't. They've actively tried to pass relief bills but Republicans continuously tack on extraneous budget increases for shit that's not needed.

That's how Republicans senate has worked for years. They want to squeeze extras into the bills that they know Dems will vote against, then shame them publicly saying Dems don't want to pass the bill that will help everyone.

It's extremely transparent.

We are...
No
Correct
Do you have money? Do you have a Robinhood account? If the answer is yes then you’re already qualified. 

If you’re wondering what to trade you can just look at what stocks are being made into memes (NIO, PLTR, GME), and buy into them, either by buying the stock, or buying a call option. (Conversely, if you think a stock will be doing horribly, you can buy a put option) 

(Options are riskier, but give you more profit than holding a stock if your predictions are correct) 

Some people do DD, but most just YOLO their money into a stock a random redditor told them about, and that person either becomes a millionaire or homeless. 

This is WSB. If you want a safer method of investing go to r/pennystocks or r/investing, otherwise, welcome aboard.

I haven’t read a single comment or checked futures but I’d like to know who exactly is fuk tomorrow?
No nut november is cancelled.

We have rebranded to Nonstop nut november.
I have a 12/31 $11 call cuz it was cheap as fuck, I might go for a bunch of shares since I can’t time anything for shit tho
If you hold through merger and the company does poorly the stock will drop below the $10 initial price.
We are due to a short-term pull back but no way a rug pull with the curret excessive liquidity that FED's been providing. They went as far as buying ETFs. If we drop too much, I bet they'll pledge straightup buying stocks too
I’m joking. I saw that doc a while ago.
Oh I was going to in this order
Sell PLTR stocks tmr.

Buy 12/4 PLTR calls 

Buy GME stocks with tendies from PLTR Call.

Definitely agree buying calls for GME is tough to time because squeeze. Definately buying shares instead

Me selling stocks and long calls Friday seemed like a bad idea, paper hands and of course Fomo but did it anyway.  Gotta be honest it’s much more relaxing and waiting for a pull back to go back in.  Gotta have patience tho, which sucks.
If a rug pull is coming, I promise it won’t be on a Monday. They’re gonna pump Monday and dump Tuesday if anything

Lol. Dems blocked any relief until the election.
To be honest, I wouldn't advise GME calls if you want to time the squeeze. Purely because we can't time it, no one really knows when it could all kick off. The last thing you want is seeing huge spikes a couple days after your calls expire. That's why I suggested GME shares, if you're ready to jump into GME now. I would personally just jump on the hype train now, before it really picks up the pace. You saw the hype on WSB regarding PLTR right? You saw how it rocketed? Well, every other post here is GME right now. Sentiment is off the charts. But I'm already all in, so of course I'm biased. If you think there's a better opportunity in PLTR at the moment, more power to you man.

Put them at different intervals. 1/5 at $100, 1/5 at $200, etc
I am curious to see how this plays out, maybe a fuck you parting gift from Trump to Biden 😆,
No. PLTR didn’t get the attention because it’s not a mainstream company. Plus wallstreet didn’t value it properly. These kinds of opportunities come along once in a decade because PLTR is not a speculative meme stock. When it listed at a 16Bn market cap that was absolutely crazy. I couldn’t believe institutional big wigs (other than Stevie Cohen and Soros) were in on this.
I was taught to say something along the lines of  "I'm a perfectionist" and that you tend to not stop on something until its right. Not sure if that still stands today, but hard to knock someone for wanting something to be close to perfect. Tweak it accordingly.

In all seriousness, you want to answer it with a "weakness" but then show that you are working on it/turning it into a strength.  Maybe you can start with a joke like "coffee...can't resist it" (but you have to actually be good at it and say it right), and then say the real weakness.
Tell them your biggest weakness is your honesty. When the interviewer says they don’t think that’s a weakness, let them know you don’t give a fuck what they think.

For the love of god don’t buy PLTR on Monday. It’s going to 20$ . This is a promise or I will eat my shit on camera
FYI futures down a tenth of a percent does not constitute “drilling” you absolute dipshits

I don't understand what you mean by "cancer vaccines" - maybe cervical cancer is caused by HPV (virus) but are you saying that there are other cancers caused by viruses? Otherwise, how can you have a vaccine for cancer? The whole concept of a vaccine is to used a weakened or dead virus, right so it makes little to no sense to have multiple cancers vaccines unless the implication is that there are many cancers caused by viruses.

No way, it never even fucking hesitated to break 23... thats just a random level u came up with. I wouldnt be so confident in that.
It's more fun because you get to share all the hype with the weekly gang and keep making profits months after they tap out.
Yeah you’re spot on. People will by options on the SPY because it hedges against broad market movements. You can be pretty sure if the SP50 changes dramatically, your specific assets are going to follow that trend. It’s less riskier to buy calls on the sp50 if you’re bullish because your essentially betting on 500 assets. The combination of having all those assets reduces your idiosyncratic risk and exposes you to systematic risk. Essentially you’re not betting on any company doing well, you’re just betting on the market doing well.
And we all know that American audits are much superior because we’ve never had any fraud

Is there any reason why I shouldn’t go all in on TSLA tomorrow? ETFs following the S&P need to buy somewhere between 60-120 billion worth of stock by December 21st. That would be more than the average daily volume of you spread it out evenly over the next couple of weeks. Am I missing something? Seems like it’ll easily squeeze to 800+. Right? Too easy?

I wish I could get the one with the convenience package like BMS and push start at that price. Ik I could get em in few months with cashback deals get better but don't wanna wait that long.
Consider selling a few calls for stupid high strike prices. You take in premium now, and if the stupid high strike price happens you can sell a few shares for the stupid high agreed to price and all your other shares are also stupid high. Then you can get your model 3/S/X/Y whichever you want and at worse you spent a few shares to get there.

Just wanna throw out some numbers so you don't get left bag holding

* PLTR had a net income of -1.5B and an EBITDA of $148M. The market cap of 48B is 325X EBITDA.
* Amazon has an EBITDA of $16B. The market cap of $1.6T is 100X EBITDA.
* Apple has an EBITDA of $77B. The market cap of $1.98T is 25X EBITDA.

It has had it's run and 20-30$ isn't too unreasonable. But anything higher than that is just hoping more retards pump it before the inevitable dump. You're playing a dangerous game.

yessir. I understood all this. To me options on these ETFs still seem less risky than individual tickers though. Like Apple is a pretty good proxy for SPY, but recently less upside. So I'd rather buy a call on an ETF with stronger upside than Apple, but that's definitely not a common sentiment. Or a strategy where you go long with market segments and hedge with SPY puts.

So basically Merrill Lynch and other institutional investors/big players have shorted the stock, which was a bad decision. But rather than cut their losses, they’ve decided to double and triple down, deciding to short sell even more, anticipating that GS stock would eventually lower, making the short sell decision ultimately correct. HOWEVER, GS is only going up, so eventually these shorts sellers are going to get margin called and/or decide to cut their losses, so they’ll have to buy up shares. But if we collectively stand strong and continue to hold the line and buy, we’re gonna force these short sellers to buy our stuck at the ever-increasing share price?

Is that what’s happening??

Everyone is talking about how to stop your shares from being borrowed, but don't brokers have to get your permission first and compensate you to loan out your shares?  Pretty sure that's the way it used to be.

So what would you consider the next dip price at?
I have 50 shares GRWG and 2x $35c 12/31. There is almost zero chance the bill makes it through the senate with McConnell. GRWG sells hydroponic and other growth equipment, which is a market that’s about to explode since nearly every state is coming around to legalization. Moon or bust 🚀🚀🚀
But what is GameStop doing that will keep them competitive against the other big names that aren’t only in the video game business? Vintage Stock and Best Buy sell a larger variety of products and provide similar or better services(GeekSquad is a technologically impaired Boomer’s wet dream). 

So I’d argue that while GME is doing better than others think now, they’re slowly removing brick and mortar stores to get higher margins online. However, every other business already operates online. Unless they can find a niche like other non-proprietary game sales businesses, I’m not seeing this rise of GME anytime soon outside them hopping onto online sales late in the game.
Stock market metal up this week
I'm just worried about how other traders will react. To me it's not a big deal and their CEO has agreed to comply already. Just not looking forward to a huge drop due to overreaction.

Honestly I’m horrible at picking but iShares aerospace and defense ITA looks like a good candidate.
According to TA, I could see a dip from around 3.60-4.50. Id be happy to buy in this range. It’s tapping a monthly resistance at 7, most likely won’t break that on the first tap. If it does then it has major strength and worth buying into on a retest. Otherwise, I’ll sit back get a lower price. Great looking chart though. I know people are afraid by the sell off but this just shows me that it is in accumulation now.
As long as you dont have retard calls you’re fine

So you mention the concept of a ‘broad market’. Institutions have built indices which represent different blends of the market. So for example the S&P 500 is an indices containing the biggest 500 companies in the US. In finance we use these indices or benchmarks as proxies to understand how well we’ve performed on a relative basis. You can’t invest in the SP500 because it’s something that isn’t traded - it’s just a performance indicator. However companies produce ETFs which are designed to track those markets. The SPY is the main one designed to follow the US market so it provides the broadest exposure you can get. The beta of it to the SP50 should be bang on 1

Saying oh it's just made up currency is downplaying what happened here. OP gambled with extra steps. This is a cautionary tale to new people to what will happen if you buy 0DTE options with a gambling problem.

There likely will be a Chinese sell-off on Monday as people will sell this news, but if you look at the May charts, they all recovered nicely a week later. Not only do these Chinese companies get 3 years to comply, but some of them are currently a lot better off than others.

Yes, but the larger delayed rewards are guaranteed in the study.

If you're experiencing a higher probability of immediate rewards, it become worth it even if the immediate rewards are smaller.

Everyone knows, long term, the market is a ponzi that is eventually going to crash.  Frequent smaller rewards are a form of position sizing.  See you on the other side; we can compare loss/gain dick size then.
Typically the spac team takes 20% of the shares for themselves as compensation. This can encourage teams to take bad companies public because 20% of a shitty company is better then nothing. Ackman is taking no percentage on the deal and rather then using pump and dump hedge funds he is putting his own money in so he has no incentive to do anything but a good deal.
Where tf thr pltr bears come from
This sub was bullish af 2 days ago
Anyone else think of companies names by their ticker since you started trading? 

Like I’m writing this message on an aapl iPhone, while driving my tsla over to pick up some mcd, wearing my clothes from jwn, and then going to pick up a lot of crck
Whatever your personal tolerance is. If you can afford to lose a couple hundred+ and still maintain a good portfolio then go for calls. Shares are usually the ‘better’ option. I’d personally buy shares because it may trade sideways for a while until next January or so.

They have 3 YEARS to comply (if it passes). A net positive for the companies if the bills passes as it really makes those companies bullet proof after the fact.
all valid points minus tsla propping nq

but you forget the other side of the coin... what happens when all this money on the sidelines enters the market?
yep. Stock will rise on the news. I'm hoping for a quick 25% gain then I'm out until it pulls back

AMD is basically priced-in with maxed production right now. Consoles are selling like hotcakes but they've hit a hard production ceiling so now it's just a bet as to when they'll stop selling out when they hit the shelf. And this was all pretty much predicted as soon as MS and Sony dropped their release windows.
Covid is increasing. People are cold because of winter. Cold and sick people eat soup. Campbell’s makes soup and a lot of it.

What we thinking about ACB and other weed stonks?
Fair point.
this seems like a genuine and important post so i would definitely recommend u ask a better sub like r/stocks as were just all shithead autists over here. best of luck to u tho.
I have 80% of my portfolio in PLTR, 10% in CRSR & the rest cash. Dumped out of TSLA at 595 & bought the near-bottom of PLTR dip Friday. Bought the CRSR dip earlier in the week near the bottom too.
BABA is 100% fine.  It's more for stocks like GSX I'm guessing.  Joe Tsai owns the Brooklyn Nets, has a ton of ties with like Cuomo and others, lives in the US, and he will definitely comply.
WTF? Votebot doesn't fucking work. What retards code that shit?
There are some recent DDs if you search the ticker, bunch of them get into /r/conspiracy territory like hostile takeovers and Burberry making a tweet that he deleted, I might buy in a little for the retard pump n dump
not even gonna lie autism charities must be seeing a spike in contributions due to this sub and they prolly have no idea why. 

wonder how they would feel if they read the comments of the people contributing e.g "you autistic fucks" .....i guess they wouldnt care cuz its free money
If you're Australian based, IBKR allows you to trade options on US stocks, IBKR for New Zealand doesn't yet there are fees associated with trading on IBKR where as Stake doesn't have any fees at all for trading (just deposit/withdrawel fee on 1% forex exchange). 

Stake also allows you to trade on unsettled funds after selling off shares, instant buying power so to say. 

If I had access to options through IBKR I would give it a try though!
Garbage stock. Company not in operation. CEO abandoned it and they only sell shares now. Played it for a long time during the run a few years ago. Have done tons of DD
im pretty sure that PLTR is either going up or down. I would risk and say I'm positive about it.

Palantir is at $25 in Sydney Stock market wow
Remember everyone: GREED IS GOOD
$NVDA also
I’m just totally baffled by any of that hype.

The Dems have said they’re going to vote on a legalization bill in the house this week. And that’s great as a statement of the party or whatever, but McConnell is in no way going to pass that bill. 

Now, MAYBE Dems pass the bill in the House and then campaign hard in the Georgia Senate Races to say “hey we’ll legalize weed nationwide if you vote for our Senate Candidates.” 

But the vote in the House is totally symbolic.
They have 3 years to comply or negotiate new rules, it's not exactly high risk
Another green week for nio? Fuck the house!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
WSB approves
So does that mean my puts will print?
YES! PLTR FRIDAY. wow. sometimes i'm thinking the loss was basically just the cost of one good ass lesson. it was my first [big] play and i no joke lost almost to the dollar what my profit was but got what i put in plus $500. can someone please tell me i'm honestly a loser for crying about still coming out above while people of here fuck up their whole life's [sometimes]
Dude, if you wanna lose 50k just give it to me, I promise you I at least wont force you to watch it slowly dwindle into nothing
pretty sure they will vote for a merger extension on December 3rd

Github Packages? You mean the solution that supports way less artifact types than Artifactory like OP mentioned in the post? You mean the solution that doesn't even have an on-premise license and forces you to use their cloud solution?

apparently now bad economics is good for markets, since large cap corporations get to survive and accumulate for market share and the expense of small business, so more profits for big names basically. That holds until demand and consumer spending plummets, but for now its doing ok so yeah, Memeconomics
In contrast, I paid $2.65 each
So was Kodak a short squeeze? I’m actually curious about it. Didn’t look up the short % when the news happened. But I’m surprised people just bought it as a speculation alone. People had to think it was going to 0.

A little bit of DD for the retards who see this shit and think they can pull the same move with 120% chance of success: pulling out at 500k is not a losing position, it's profit. The point is not to max out your gains at 500k, the point is to alleviate risk. There's a chance that your 2000 dollar gain this week could turn into 3000 dollars. There's also a chance that it could turn into -3000 because you refuse to cut your losses. Diamond hands is a funny meme but the last time I stuck to it too hard I fucked myself. Don't be like your dad, know when to pull out.

Real talk: keep Ford if you have June or later calls for around 10 or 11. They’re cheap and if you need immediate capital to drop into meme stonks and join the Palantards, just sell some of it. Ford has great prospects for EVs (have friends who are engineers there). I intend on holding on to my June calls and buy more on dips (unless shit hits the fan).
We just wacked one of their nuclear scientists
thx. I think I understand, ETFs have latency (?) and for the use case of the broad market you want lower latency
It’s in the money already, so very likely you get assigned on it and have to buy the shares for $35 each. So basically if the price drops at all, you end up taking a loss.
Welp, jacked into 30k worth of palantir calls I bought in the dip. Sometimes you just gotta ride the hype.

This is false. In fact one of the reasons it is not very easy to build an international portfolio yourself (I've tried) is because most of the world does not use U.S. GAAP nor does most of the world really care too much about being on the U.S. Stock Exchange itself. It is rigorous and difficult to get listed on the U.S. exchanges as a foreign company. Companies who are global do need the capital that the U.S. exchanges (and actually, all exchanges) provide, but most don't need it at all.

A new shareholder that will try to make GameStop the Amazon of video games is what people are saying. Also a short squeeze that would rely on people not being paper hands (lmao sure). It’s all very dumb reasoning for a dying company, but maybe I’m wrong
Hey me too. 😎
wasnt tech up 1% a couple minutes ago
Who the fuck are you talking to?
for everyone worried PLTR won't moon tomorrow because WSB already FOMO'd in

you forgot the idiots who read Citron's tweet and opened short positions Friday are going to have to cover tomorrow

we all know Left already closed his and bought weekly calls

PLTR $40 EOD 🚀
first move, starting the week off eight by donating $500 to st. Cecelias food pantry Englewood.   2nd move, Buy GME shares, add to my Amzn calls 3400 1/21.  And hold on to PLTR 1000 shares, multi call 25 23 27 expiry March and beyond
you guys think PLTR will rise a lot in pre-market? i’m tryna buy the dip

Yes but if I’m wrong it’s just an anomaly

Been known for months.  Companies will have 3 years to comply.
its definitely really hard to make money during an insane period of stock prices endlessly moving up, when everything should be going down the way the actual economy is.  


but sure, wsb are experts one and all. lets go with that and wank each other off in a circle jerk at our accidental brilliance.
Scraping all the comments and parsing them for stock tickers I assume.
If no one has mentioned, I think you should add a weekly view as well
Does CRSR move back up this week?
Shut up boomer
PLTR Puts, SPY balls deep calls, QCOM calls, NIO calls

F
 Bought some TSLA puts at fridays peak to make some money during the next week. Still bullish but a pullback is a very likely scenario
If you think GME squeeze wont happen, please sell me covered calls at $40, $50, $100 etc. Please. put your money where your mouth is retard
I need this answer, what has changed? Do your close ones know? I think I would keep it to myself and not hint friends but maybe let close family know.

Okay kids. Here's a free PSA you don't want to hear. 

Volume as been reaching lowest levels in history for the past month for BIG tech FAANG (which makes up 30-40% of SPY and NQ). What does that mean? It means these huge *up* price movements are by very very few traders, not the average market. 

You can look at any FANG stock Volume this week and last week. Sometimes less than 10k people are trading per block. However TSLA is the only major stock moving 1m + not far behind SPY. this market is literally being proped by Tesla at the moment. If TSLA bulls start to take profits and it nose dives, expect FAANG to as well, and the rest of the market with it. 

Literally walking on eggshells. And I mentioned earlier extreme greed is at 92/100 with put call ratios at 70%. Lowest numbers in 2 years.

True that 45% rise last quarter has set the expectations too damn high
Yep. My style is to never hold overnight unless its a leap. I’d probably put most people to sleep with the way I trade.
On further review, read my other post and read the article someone linked as a reply to my comment and I replied with a 2 paragraph quote. The retail investors (that's us you retards) will get screwed. This thing is overcooked and designed to give money to the fat cats, not us.
march gang here, got in under 10
You gonna waste money for the next 2-3 years waiting on Ford, you might as open a savings account
Maybe. If their puts went ITM they would buy shares to close which would reduce their short position. Otherwise they continue to sell puts and it reduces the losses as GME rises.

Just spitballing here. Shorts have been crushed this year so I wouldn't want to be a melvin right now.
This is the way
Yeah, I bought it a bit too early too. I thought the 12%ish correction post-split was a good long term entry play. Mines down about 45% but I think itll come back
Nah. Biotechs will carry nasdaq this week with all the health conferences
It's not a dope time to be holding BABA calls... Hah. I have a feeling they will vote to audit the Chinese stocks. Why wouldn't they?
Cuz they only like options, welcome to shares gang friend where we gamble responsibly. Buy in at morning if u want to gamble hard but tbh they will probably rise the whole week u can get in whenever

Bruhhhh
Guys I actually meditate and see the future two-three days ahead. Please get out of PLTR tomorrow at bell ring. PLTR will tumble down to its 20s by Monday afternoon. Then a fake pump will buy it to about 23 dollars but then by close it will tumble down to 18$. Be safe. I already purchased a bulk order of 20$ puts for Friday that should pay off.
Unemployment no longer impacts the market. NeoEconomics
The crowd says PLTR
Green at night; bulls take flight.
Omg I hope you’re my psychiatrist
Following. You def need to give updates on this tomorrow holy shit
took a 100mg sour patch edible and jerkin to Stocktwits confirmation bias
First time I've ever chosen a "WR" with negative FPs.  Joke is on me though for trying to be cute.
As long as tony's announcing it they could be buttfucking for all I care
He is the devil.
Implying this is more catalyst for shorts to squeeze themselves.  At the end of every year most institutions (and traders for that matter) sell off losing positions to offset gains from earlier in the year to reduce their tax liability.  Selling off a losing short trade is a double win in the sense you are booking an immediate tax offset, but also taking substantial risk off the books.  A few firms booking some tax-loss harvesting will look like investors running for the door which will cause others to run for the door too.

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp
SPY has much broader market exposure across sectors. ARKK could fuck you pretty hard if just TSLA dropped. I don’t know anything about IBUY but it seems like a single sector
Valhalla
There is nothing funnier than spank-monkeys in here convincing family members over the holidays to buy PLTR. They’ll either hold some tremendous bags at the top of a bubble or get a good investment until they hold tremendous bags at the top of a bubble
So we can rule out the price being equal to what it was at 9:30?
2am est iirc?
NIO and XPEV will pass the audits with flying colours and they'll moon even harder after the naysaying deniers get shut up about fraud

Imagine comparing EV to fucking coffee

Just let us sell for a few hours. It's gonna be green by open anyway.

Timed it? He should have just not doubted his vibe. He had the right horse with FSLY and his position in FSLY alone which I calculated to be 6,000 shares at the peak would have been worth 768,000 alone. That's what we're looking at here.

Do I keep Ford for long-term or sell it and buy more PLTR tomorrow?
what are they gonna do? pound sand?
Honest question. Did they ever?

Literally buy the cheap calls a year out. You'll be rich. I bought shares for corsair at 18. Kicking myself for knowing it was super undervalued but didn't buy calls. Airbnb is the same. It announced no issue even with covid surging.
we still have to find out if this is a trend-reverse or a pullback. At the current level it's best to look for longs instead of shorts.
ZM probably needs a historical beat for it to go up like 5%+ tomorrow.  I can see it crushing earnings and then giving neutral guidance and the stock goes down.
Climbing back up now. And NASDAQ and SPY still green.
Same, you mean Energy Fuels Inc. by the way? What about them?
yup

**Tech** 💯? More like **Tech** not 💯
I get to feel like a professional investor with my one share
if you're trading for broad market upside, why is SPY so popular vs something like IBUY or  ARKK? Is it just due to SPY's trade-ability?
Do I need some special account to place pre market orders? I have td ameritrade and I'm looking to get some GME asap
Yes, but if the rest of the world wants to list on US stock exchanges they have to follow US rules and Regulations...IE using GAAP.

Edit:  This fight isn't even about IFRS or GAAP, it's about the complete lack of audit trail, and the Chinese actively preventing it's companies from being audited/verifying it's financials.
Load up on calls at open, got it.

You guys think NIO gonna drop below 39 by 12/18? I got call spreads for 39/38 and wanna wait till expiration for max profit. Feel pretty confident it's gonna continue going up but even if it doesn't I don't think it would drop that low so my calls should be safe.

>What’s not to love when “risk” is all but risk-free? There’s only one  loser in this equation. As always, it’s the retail investor, the  Robinhood novice, the good-intentions fund company like Fidelity. They  all bring their pickaxes to the SPAC gold rush, failing to understand  that the opportunities were mined long before they got there—by the  sponsors who see an easy score, the entrepreneurs who get fat exits when  their companies are acquired and the SPAC Mafia hedge funds that  lubricate it all.

>It’s about to get far worse for the little guy. Giant quant  firms—Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management, Louis Bacon’s Moore  Capital, Michael Platt’s BlueCrest Capital—have recently jumped in.  Sure, they all raised billions based on algorithmic trading strategies,  not by buying speculative IPOs in companies that don’t even have a  product yet. But you don’t need AI to tell you the benefits of a sure  thing. And that means torrents of easy cash for ever more specious  acquisitions.

Yea you actually brought my attention to the name.

i mean with current inflation, a loaf of bread will hit quadruple digits in 5 years
nice mate. what stack did you use to make this ?
[removed]
You love to see it
Selling puts! and setting leaps on speculative plays. I’ve made a lot on SPCE and PIC that way
PLTR at 9 rings gifted to the kings of men on the middle earth market 💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💍💍
Bangbus and skateboarding combined
If it hits 41 buy me one too
Based on comments over the weekend it seems that most of wsb has fomo’d into pltr already. When everyone fomos the price goes up obv but what happens when that pent up demand fades ..... we ded😵
at least 3 figures
Lots of competition is what I am finding, and there seems to be deceleration in their business.  With that being said it could easily still quickly become a meme
$YOLO obviously
So will my sperm count
[deleted]
Yeah I got in early with 1 share but it’s soooo up
Gaping.. like your moms booty hole
I don't understand why everyone wants in to wsb then wants to change the way wsb does things. r/investing is a great sub and would love to have you. Go there.
Let me tell you how to make big gains long term that anyone can do with a relatively low chance of failure with no dd at all, just that you need to hold for a minimum of 5 years 

Pick a number between 1 and 10. Buy stock 100% in whatever you land on
The code is below











1. Tesla 
2. Tesla 
3. Tesla 
4. Tesla 
5. Tesla 
6. Tesla 
7. Tesla
8. Tesla 
9. Tesla 
10. Tesla 

Not saying this will be the biggest gain, but the biggest gain for the amount of risk
Could you link it please because I'm only seeing stuff from Friday

A girl gave me her snap what should i say?
Weirdly enough though, the bullish news has only begun, the vaccine deployment is gonna cause everything to jump another couple percent in December and Jan. Maybe small pullbacks but I still say we end December up.

Think about all the Thanksgiving weekend conversations that just happened about PLTR, NIO, & stonks in general with fam & friends. 

Three days of shrek green dildos, bigly red Thursday, unless said family members tell their boomer friends who have been sitting cash gang since April. 🤔
$NBAC - it's merging with an EV Charging Company called Nuvve. Extremely undervalued. Will moon to $30 this week.
oh ok, maybe i'll keep it then. as long as they charge the right amount.
I’m in on JMIA for the boomers who will drive up price in the coming months but it’s more of a long term play if you wanna make serious cash, Africa is about in 1980-90s China in terms of infrastructure and capital so if ya wanna wait 30 years go ahead but there’s so many autist plays you can make in the meantime
Yeah I think this is what most people miss. WSB will hype any stock, but it takes half an autist's braincell to spot a failing business from a mile away. Find the stocks that WSB hypes, then cross reference that with common sense. Tendies only go up.
PLTR is the gift that keeps on giving. I’m preparing my body for a +15% gain tomorrow lads. See you on the other side.
[removed]
Wouldn’t that imply we open red

I'm usually into MILFs, but McKayla Maroney is looking good

people who post in the daily thread might be slightly ahead of the FOMO curve

Fucking absurd, lmao I love this sub

I think just became sexually attracted to a company.
I got a margin call where the requirement was 60%. As smart as you think you are you can lose money if they change the requirement on you. Special event pending: We're taking your money, enjoy the holiday.
The house is voting Wednesday to kick out China stocks over audit rules...if it passes, buy BABA leaps after pull back
.. if it doesn't pass, buy BABA weeklies
Maybe?
It’s not a large part of my acct, I just wanted to see what ppl think with it having a nice run then obviously have a pretty significant reversal. I guess it’s probably best to just do what I think tho

The hero we need but don’t deserve, otherwise who would we buy from and who would we sell to?
I mean, that is the name of the company, Hattori Hanzo😮
I feel like early futures never mean anything, only after 3AM EST. And even then, they're not particularly telling. Legit there was one time two weeks ago we were up by a percent and dumped to red within 15 mins and stayed there...
Warrants bought at .79. When you see warrants on a green stonk under 1.00 time to yolo. Still not too late.
Feels toppier and toppier in here everyday. Just blind, belligerent bullishness everywhere you look.

u/stevenvanmetre I'm sorry I drunkenly called you a bitchass pussy the other day; you just might be right after all.
Those who missed Tesla will also miss PLTR
Youre a winner
Nah my strategy is to become rich in the stock market and then get both of us fired

Got my friends and family to buy into $PLTR. Did my part over the weekend.
[removed]
My plan at least - hedging acb moonshot w APHA
But retail also goes from up 0- up 10%- down 50% - up 100% - down 90% ..
Apex legends already up 17% for me
You are two months too late when GME was in the single digits.
>If PLTR hits $40 in the next 2 weeks, I'm leaving the girlfriend I live with.

dont worry i bought puts and am on a losing streak, i feel the puts will fail so you should be good
I’m in and bullish on PLTR but if you bought crazy OTM weeklies idk what to tell you
As much as everyone wants GME to 🚀 it has been very unstable always dropping as soon as it hits $15.The past has shown that it go’s $45 to $50 on new consoles release dates but with the hole COVID thing I think we will be lucky if it will hit $35 this consoles release.
Same. One ticker. Track a 4 week out ATM option thats 0.55 of previous close and wait for rebound untill target. Get out at 0.48 if it drops.
Nah, fading hard.
[removed]
Ok then buy puts
Don’t forget to call everybody a retard
Walmart sent me the wrong lego set. think they'd actually do anything if I just kept it and the replacement set they're sending?
Don't take the shit literally it means actual good indexes and government bonds bruh.
Dow just went red
Why isn't TSLA in the portfolio?
No idea. I’ve been checking out these websites to see what people are trading lmao. Then coming in the sub and searching particular tickers to see if anything is fijd
We are getting so close to the first all in play with 8 figures can't wait.
How low do you think the VIX will get before EoY? Looks good to go below 20 on Monday

Cool, so you spread it to 30 girls who then gave it to their friends and family unknowingly
You need slightly more since it has a dividend coming up (which will drop the price by the dividend amount).

I remember cloudflare’s IPO and watching it hover around $16-18 for a while, thought this would be a great opportunity long term, just never really committed. Just took a glance at it again, holy hell what a missed opportunity that was.
My target is 5~7%. I'm being conservative (?) though.
The same reason why you don't buy all your clothes online directly from the brand. If that was the case don't you think the game houses would just sell directly to the consumer, don't you think XBOX and playstation ect. would just sell games exclusively online..

No idea
We don’t buy stocks here. We buy deep otm options with early expiration dates. but srsly don’t enter the market unless you know what you’re doing. as retarded as this sub is they at least know the basic fundamentals
We all do
ICLN is looking good to surpass $26 really really soon
no, it's a great stock that could be a beast again.
I placed an order for open for 12/24 $35c
Yeah document the fuck out of this and if you have email correspondence, screenshot and save those emails or texts. If they were phone calls or in person conversations, still document what was discussed and save them. 

First talk to them via written media and explain that what they're doing is fucked up and that it's unacceptable, if they continue down this path, then at least you have proof. 

Depending on your work circumstance, you may or may not want to complete the work, prior to bringing this up to the upper management.

Futures always green. Tech always 🚀. Keep buying calls and BTFD. Stocks keep climbing and luckily bears keep buying puts.
Ya, the main reason I got in in the first place was ppl spending more time at home and gaming, and e sports gaining popularity. But with Xbox and PlayStation released i thought they might see less sales but then figured if ppl are inheriting lager sums from a generation that did save more they might buy more expensive machines like Corsair

Chronic anxiety is it’s own reward

Yes, it has quite a bit of extrinsic value because its about 5 months from expiration. Time is on his side, therefore, the contracts have loads of extrinsic value.

Purple didn't tank though, it dipped, and then continued on to ATH. It's just that people took the advice of the big purple gang guys, which was to hold shares and warrants, and decided that meant buy weekly options, which of course expired worthless.

Not this time 🌈🐻
Why are people shilling GME? Justification?
Shares over options on this one. Premiums are too high and shares help make the short squeeze happen
i had tesla calls that were like 4k profit, sold when it dipped to 3k

like 3 hours later they were worth 32k profit

I think you’re overestimating how many incremental people are dying and how much is being inherited as a result.
I think it might either bounce harder and run, or it will chill for a while due to its stellar run up. Hard to say which is more likely.

Here’s my hot take: CRSR will dump to 35 then recover
APHA and acb buying this week from UN, US and Mexico by mid December news?
[removed]
Considering APHA LEAPs
This guy isn’t smart, he’s just stubborn. He’s ignorant in tech, but he’s good at making money. Basically how he got successful. One of his students introduced the internet to him and he thought of e-commerce. He could have stolen Amazon’s idea, but China’s basically isolated, and no one would use Amazon in China. So he saw an opportunity to make money and he did. He’s an ignorant dude who took a lot of chances (and failed a lot), and I respect him for that.
Anyone else have positions you forgot about from day drinking?
I've got BABA 2x 275c 12/11 & 300 12/24. Yeesh. Not sure what I'll do yet. Glad I've got some APHA , DKNG, and FCEL calls to hold me tight.

I have PLTR $34c so I’m in your ballpark. 

The $38c was a lottery ticket. You’ll be naturally frustrated if it ends up running to 40, but it’s better than having lost it all. Take some profits and save a few lottery tickets for Friday. 

(Personally I am not holding a single weekly through Friday, last Friday spooked me.)

1) Post controversial opinion about a stock

2) Don't explain why or how or when

You got downvoted a ton but I think your right. It already had like a 17% percent swing on Friday could continue into Monday a bit. After hours price changes aren’t reliable since the volume is so low
I know it's still green, but IWM has dropped 0.35% in the past 20 mins. 

I'll take anything that confirms my positions at this point.

No, that’s not what I meant, but there are going to be headlines on Tuesday along the lines of “Amazon Reports Record Black Friday and Cyber Monday Sales” and my thesis is that it will lead to bullish sentiment for consumer discretionary stocks like Corsair.
DG is one of the secrets to how the upper middle class stay upper, but this week is the end of the $200’s for them.

I believe the stock market will keep on going up as there are new investors getting lured in every day, the money sitting on the sides are already getting pulled in. At no point, there will be a rug getting pulled except corrections on regular basis. Everyone will keep on rotating their holdings, with bag holders left behind here and there.

However, even though your portfolio is doing well, the dollar value will keep dropping, inflation will increase, things will get expensive.

When TSLA and others ramp up, they are in a good position for the supply chain.My only concern is that the US govt may repeat the same mistakes back in MolyCorp days.

Shenghe Resources having a 7% (non-majority) stake, as well as being a customer could be a good thing. It means the Chinese have a vested interest now, and wouldn't do them good to do a price war like last time. But some Muricans may not see it that way.
I never said other vaccines are letting viral replication run rampant. I said "NVAX has the only evidence of sterilizing immunity in non-human primates challenge studies" to date and they do.  

Figure 3 of the paper you linked is the same figure I put into my original post. Note that NVAX's equivalent challenge study was also performed at Texas Biomedical Research Institute, also with Rhesus Macaques and had superior results at both dose levels (you can reference the figure in my first post). And in the study, NVAX challenged with 1.05e6 PFUs versus 7.6e5 PFUs for MRNA - so I'm not sure where you got your numbers. MRNA's NHP data isn't bad by any means, it's just not as good as NVAX. As you say, monkey models aren't everything.

Ultimately, MRNA's 95% efficacy readout supersedes all of the NHP data and I think those results were huge for MRNA and all of the people that will get their vaccine. I'm just trying to make a prediction about NVAX based on the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been published and NHP/titer data is all we have so far.

Thank you
It’s an IPO that’s going to attract a lot of types of traders.  A lot of people are going to have opinions on the stock so it’s hard to say it’s going to rocket up as easily as PLTR.
What’s he going to say that we already don’t know? Unless he’s raising rates I have a hard time seeing the “jpow” sell off tomorrow
So wait, you guys say “because EV cars will sell we need to invest in batteries we need to invest in mining companies”

Yet I heard nothing about the guys who sell to the mining companies.

Why do I hear nothing about CAT? It’s like at the base of the cycle.

May the upvotes decide the winner of the ticker for our Down syndromed ETF. I think RTRD sounds too much like retired- and boomers will try and invest in it and we’ll get bad write ups due to the insane volatility of the thing by boomers, and then get an SEC investigation and have WSB closed and then have to meet in the back of Wendy’s every second Friday and verbally say our positions.

For my target I used 1.5% on $10 trillion passive tracking and benchmarking to S&P. So they would need ~$150 billion added to cap from the date of the announcement. 

So look at market cap. It went from ~$390 to $555 billion. So that would be roughly 1.5% allocation on $10 trillion in funds tracking or $160 billion...

It's already been priced in. Now you may say, okay well speculators have bought in, but what about the actual indices? That's exactly what this pricing in does. Speculators front run and dump shares creating liquidity just as the indices need it on inclusion date. Everything is *relatively* balanced. 


Priced the fuck in. Anything above $600/share is pure hype. You're assuming that nothing has been priced in yet, or you're off somewhere else in your assumptions.
Fuck those meme stocks that you love so bad 

I know you still think about the gains you had

Instead I bought calls that went to shit.

So wtf is gonna happen with PLTR
[removed]
I just bought in🚀🚀🚀
Yes agreed, but bid/offer spreads are pretty narrow for TSLA despite being a 600 dollar stock.  I actually would never recommend anyone buy APPN options - calls or puts (it's spreads are like 5 dollars wide for ATM).  But still, TSLA hasn't been as popular as I thought it would be vs. PLTR recently, even though it had it's own large move, which does make sense given the price too.
Yes, but too much of a percentage is allocated in assets because of the situation we are in. Realocation to bonds and governments assets will most likely happen before EOY imo. This must happen before next year anyway so we will see when.
one of the few thatll stay a meme forever
its the do not enter sign
Tsla calls even for $950 for end of year are rather expensive haha.
also you using vercel? never heard of them.

That IPO would react like Rkt not PLTR.
I have 1/15/21 45c CRSR I bought on Friday after they were way done. Time will tell if that’s “good”. That’s my only open options position. However I’ve been buying Ford June $9 calls every time they drop below 9 and selling everytime they go back about 9. Been buying like 15-20 at a time since they’re cheap

Here are some thoughts. I have followed Airbnb for a very long time and also bought some pre-IPO. The way Airbnb and Chesky handled the Covid crisis was very impressive. People who are not comfortable flying are driving down to nearby places and renting an Airbnb. Once things get back to normal, Airbnb should explode.
APPN has gone more parabolic last few weeks than PLTR, but it's a 200 dollar stock, so it's never going to be that popular here.
It's already been reported that Stripe wasn't receptive to Ackman's pitch.

I'm shocked this company isn't in the 50s already. It's saved all of humanity with the vaccine and it has an amazing pipeline - the next few years are looking great for Pfizer shareholders.
I got banned on the discord for mentioning A P X T. Like some little narc started going "PENNY PUMPER ALERT" and I got banned lmao. For mentioning a damn SPAC.
You got it wrong and I'm too lazy to explain, but in short.

No lending and rates near zero (this tells me no inflation, and it's bad for the market) and If there is inflation then rates must rise (also bad for market). Market rised because of a weald dollar and that can't go on forever (also bad for markets)

All of the things above has nothing to do with plandemic, vaccine, election and so on. There is a lot more but whatever... i have not even gone in detail about debt.
I think a $8 swing is a lot. I’d sell at least half of them if it touched $34.
You seemed worried that GME might have a huge pull back after 16. Just trying to tell ya we haven’t even started.

Maybe try picking up Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas. He talks about the emotional aspects of being a trader and how to develop your mentality. Useful after a losing streak. Taking emotion out of the game is important (such as being ok with cutting loses too), though it's obvious it's part of the charm.

Good luck to you.

Hi, Would you like to buy shares from a company with an inevitably dead business model, up from over 400% since it's all time low since the covid19 economy crash?

**Hell no**

It has been theorising over 4 months about a "squeeze" which you don't really know anything about but there's rocket emojis in every post🚀🚀🚀


**Oh, hell yes**
I use a scraper I made called scrapefrom, it's on npm. It runs on every call to fetch the list. Didn't have any issues with the load time so figured there wasn't a need for a db for that... definitely would be useful for historical analysis though

That makes sense but it's still odd they would choose to maintain their position through the cycle while keep paying interest on the borrowed shares vs realizing their gains and jumping back in after the console cycle peaks.

Anything sealed you need to weigh it. Heavier means it has holos inside (foil). There's lots of scams on ebay and amazon where they gut the packs, take out the good stuff, reseal it with junk and sell it. 

Or buy from reputable dealers that don't fuck around like that. You can tell a booster is resealed if the "weld" on the seal is fucked up or it's clear meaning the print tore off and they put it back together

Example: I own 100 shares with the price at $4/share. The implied borrow rate is fucking retarded and therefore puts are pricier than calls, and demand for current delivery of shares is very high.

I sell my 100 shares, and BTO a $4 Call / STO a $4 Put. I have the same upside/downside as owning the stock, but I no longer own it explicitly--I committed to a futures position, but pocket the premium.. I did this in the Spring and got a ~$.60 credit on that trade because borrow rates were ridiculous.
Wow. That is a fat finger trade. I fat finger all the time, nothing quite so retarded, but still...like two weeks ago I meant to do 310/311 DIA call credit spread, and I did 300/301. Bunch of 'em too. Fuck

Can it be a week for BABA too? Need BABA to 🚀
all i said was...i started investing when i was 17-18 y/o w/ $5k. i just bought shares of blue chip stocks. boring, i know. but i needed to learn how all of this worked (noone ever taught me). so i learned terminology, why things happen and can happen. and im lucky enough that my portfolio is now $500k (not my retirement account, my personal cash account). 

save your money when your young and let the ball roll and do work. be patient and dont panic when things go down and dont get to excited when they balloon.

specifically when it comes to GME....im ready to hold onto my shares and position through the Q4 earnings report.  in fact i want to...unless a VW type squeeze actually happens. but dont think short term, especially if your are not playing weekly options. o and i personally dont recommend playing options if you are new. thats just me.

With your experience level, just start with maybe 2k or 1k even and take a position and then if it hits take 70% of the profits and move that into the underlying stock which made that profit, then the next time try again with a little more maybe $1500 and if that fails then move back down to 1k

It can continue up, still has a week and a half of EC run to go. I think if it hits 30-40 margin calls will be in, shorts are already underwater at 15. Double that and brokers will want their stocks back.
As of two weeks ago started buying options no closer than 2-3 months out and not as far OTM. Less of a chance of making fuck you money but much higher chance of making money. Especially on something like SQ or any other company prone to random big days (as long as you’re not buying on the big days)

Dumbasses think because a stonk is going up they can buy a weekly far OTM and it'll print. I know how how stupid it is because I used to do that and only this week broke even all time. 6 month calls about 15% OTM and selling monthly calls far OTM is the move. You make theta money and then eventually that call goes ITM.

This is an another way of pomping same stuff: PLTR. You can not stop something by doing same thing yourself
Theoretically the shorts when they get margin called.

Will buy PLTR if true
i want the PLTR crash to happen already so people can shut the fuck up about it

When does Germany PLTR ticker open? edit: 3am EST
Need at .65% on spy which isn’t the worse but wish we were higher
Bulls are in the clear. Monday’s have been green for sooooo long
It looks like you can cancel it still, if that's what you're asking
y = r cubed over 3!
So what’s wsb’s plan on R*bl*x when it IPO’s? We still pumping this thing for days on end?
I bought 32p on Friday for like 1.40 and made 6x my money lol.
Reminds of the electron that got pulled over by a cop. The cop asks him “do you realize you were going 100?” And the electron replies “GREAT now I’m lost!”
futures can be red or green, microvast's confirmed offering is still going to the moon...
I will, untill January 2021
Calls or puts !
Seeing how democrats were so willing to work with trump for the last 4 years, it would surprise me we get a stim package UNLESS spy goes to 220 then they sign anything.

>who pulled out too soon

That's what ... said
off on a tangent....I've stopped buying stuff on ebay after they started collecting sales taxes making used items that much more expensive.  bargain hunter here.
There’s literally like no downside, if they go under(which they won’t) you lose $50 on each call and that’s it, but if they go up it’s easy money
Pretty sure I’m going balls deep in MRNA FDs at open

Thank god our economy will be saved by Facebook /s
lol "we"...RenTech trades more volume in a day than all of wsb combined.  Retail became a terrible scapegoat for the intraday volatility not caused by them, and retail doesn't get enough credit for their long term stocks outperforming the average hedge fund.

i got banned for supporting microvast lol
Its only post titles? If you get it with comments in the daily discussion that might be something amazing.. idk if possible i am too retarded
I love how bears only show their shitty faces when the market is down .05 %. When it's at ATH multiple times a week now they are nowhere to be seen. Haha wily little fuckers.
I just want tomorrow to be ideal, so every single meme stocks should BOOM from open to close except PLTR, that I want to open with -10% so I can quickly scoop some juicy calls.
[removed]
lol

I guess I'll just have to wait for international markets to see if my puts actually increase in value. 

I think they've only been green for about 90 minutes of the past 3 weeks... immediately after I opened them. 

Thank God they're fairly far OTM and long dated, and also that I sold spreads. This week, though, I might have to abandon ship.
Woke up from a nap half asleep and checked futes. Up 10 points, but for a second I thought it said up 10% and I didn't know what to do with myself but I was so excited
I see no GME in here, need to diversify bro 😀
So you mean I get to watch a guy eat his own shit, and two retards fight? all in one week? ... you son of a bitch I'm in!
It won’t
Still a boomer stock.
Remindme! 16 hours
They hate us cause they ain’t us
where do you start ?  
 

leave this sub reddit visit r/stocks or r/investing. Dont be afraid to ask logical questions on these subreddits, you wont find anything usefull here. 

&#x200B;

What sites do i use ? 

&#x200B;

Definitely not this one.   


Investopedia is a good place to start.   


How do i know what to invest in ?   


Everyone has been asking themselves this question for years. the answer is yet to be found.   


Gonna sound like a rainbow bear BUT

Look, the smartest thing you can probably do for yourself is firstly get a job, find a steady income, dedicated half of that to savings, all while still researching how to the stock market works.  
Once you have saved up $1000 - $10000 start buying shares, gain some experience. THEN start learning options. Learn about CALLS and PUTS, learn about vertical spreads, leaps, etc. 

Research brokers, who has the highest commissions ? do they only do CFDs or do they have options available ? How long does money take to enter / exit the account ?  


Start small, don't make decisions based on rocket emojis, and most importantly stay calm.   
This sub isn't going anywhere soon, There is a new meme stock almost every month with these lunatics so don't rush yourself because of FOMO.

 *There are always tendies to be made somewhere.*

Do you think this is just the literal top of the market forever? Plandemic is old news. Vaccine (even if it turns us to zombies) is “good” news.

There's no options on apex, so it literally can't gamma squeeze like PLTR did. Leverage sent PLTR to the moon.

I think it's getting confused somewhere with the FROG ticker. Maybe CAI as well.
Dude you're good. Hold the line.
Same thing it does every week, Pinky. Up premarket, up market start, retrace to wherever the price hasn't sat long enough yet to gobble up all the orders that have been triggered. Repeat every day but Friday, when another options expiry induced sell off occurs. 

I expect the growth to be less that last week, but enough to trigger enough OTM call buying to drive price down on friday, just like this past week and the week before.

Good luck. Lol also take advantage of your employer matches when you become a pharmacist. That will make you more money than these dumb meme stocks.
You bought an overvalued OTM call on a stock that rose >50% in the last 3 weeks, but apparently this sub is to blame.
Restaurants not adapting will go out of business. This happened 20 years ago when restaurants refused to change over to credit cards because of the fees. Now you pretty much have to accept a credit card or lose lots of business. Same with delivery. You have to be on Doordash or Uber in order to make those extra sales. 

You’ve made up my mind. I’m going with $DASH because every excuse you and everyone else in this thread have given me about why Doordash will fail just doesn’t add up with the facts.
Yeah but it’s overvalued now. Don’t chase this. AMD is better for long at this point.
I won’t either

He missed the PLTR train
Lol chart analysis is liking reading bones
Elaborate
Obviously that's less risky but if its a MEME stock I would rather hold shares on margin.  Just do that math,  I fuck with options too, I have had great luck with OTM leaps I just feel that the juice just isn't worth the squeeze if I'm counting the stock to go up 10% in a week and still paying up the ass for that privilege..
Damn.... what’s your real job?

I dont understand since half of those stocks are hardly mentioned and not trending and they dont seem to be in a specific order from like most to least talked about
I agree, that was intentionally misleading. They bought 1m shares of PLTR days ago and didn't add to their holdings on Friday at all. Anyone can subscribe on the site to get a neat little table outlining their daily trades at eod

Bears impregnated

Leaps
sell a put, can't go wrong with 200%+ IV
HOW have you not spoken up about this before you son of a gun
Everyone thinks THIC🐝 is gonna moon with their upcoming merger with an EV battery company.

Hello there
Except gme is going to squeeze. So to answer your question, GME
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
That would help if I had any idea how wide it’ll swing tomorrow. I don’t wanna set a low limit that it hits in the morning and continues to moon past, and I don’t wanna set too high, it never reaches it, and then sinks back to hell lol

This market will dip eventually but im riding it up until we do
It's called a dip retard. If you didn't see one coming after 3 green dildos you need to buy fucking bonds and go to sleep.
Not if everyone gets 3/9th of a warrant.

You’re so rich you could have slaves
Those liars spreading rumors ARK bought PLTR Friday should be banned. 

They are holding 30 million of shares. They didnt buy it recently. Just subscribe to their trades at the bottom of their page and you get their daily trades by email everyday after market closes.

The SPAC buying Canoo that we’re not allowed to talk about is going to 2-3x by EoY
It’s legit af. I had a few hundred shares that I bought at 16ish and sold at 27. Still have a hundred shares for exposure but will buy a few hundred under 20
Yea I am too 😉
Someone’s mad. Maybe stop being a 🌈🐻 and you’ll actually make some tendies. PLTR 🚀🚀🚀

SOL hasn’t been meme’d yet but give it like 3 weeks. People will catch on

Airbnb had a huge surge after the initial cancelations due to the pandemic. I even bought an airbnb in Vegas for my 21st specifically because i didnt want to stay at a hotel. They also have a very low operating cost, doordash wont be as profitable as airbnb until they get fully automated deliveries which wont be for potentially a decade or more
This WSB. We lose $2K a month on stupid plays, but we refuse, REFUSE, to pay money for data that might make us better traders.

you're so confident then all  in puts gay bear, then post that amazing loss porn for us otherwise stfu
Bulls gonna celebrate all night about green futures, even though their entire portfolio is in meme stocks and they haven't bought a SPY call in 3 months.
Sell off after tremendous gain on a holiday half day bc of tweet by scammy outfit shouldn’t give you existential dread
she's just playing you.  chicks like to keep exerting their power and dick teasing to get off.
This literally cannot go tits up.
fuck. i sold my spy 365 12/2 calls friday before the dip for profit.   i shouldnt have pussied out and i probably could have gotten some hookers and blow instead of chinese food.
Buy the CRSR dip! Cyber Monday (20% off) this bitch flies once again
Wow such high quality posts here now

Don’t forget an unexpected fed meeting can be thrown into the mix to pump it too.
Better than being a fucking loser at 27

Short squeeze. Buy shares not calls.
oh god I can only dream.
am i missing something, how to S&P futures mean PLTR is mooning

A lot of people miss "normal" and want to get back to it. My thesis on movie theaters (AMC and CNK shares, selling covered calls) is that once it's safe to go back to theaters they'll be sold out for months. People will want to go to a movie just because they've spent so long unable to.
Open +0.52% - L.O.D 363.21 - H.O.D - 367.09 - Close 365.33

Popped up in the power app when I went to check /es
I bought $22.50 FSR calls for January. How should I feel
I bought some at 11.50 and held it until last week. Knew I had to hold it for a long while to get some decent gains but I hopped off to buy Palantir. Glad I did that

How high will Tesla be on dec 21 when it joins the s&p 500
It’s expensive. I know a few restaurant owners who won’t use it because of the fees on both sides. Owning 50% of the market means they have ground to lose. Same could be said for Ford, Chevy, etc. in the car market. But yet everyone has Tesla, Nio, fisker, etc. because of the upside. 

But what do I know. I’m just a degenerate gambler on WSB.

Reasonable people can disagree and I have no problem with people disagreeing with my analysis. But to suggest that I'm being misleading is ridiculous bc I've put in extra effort to be as thorough as possible.

1. I've linked sources to just about every claim I'm making and said right up front in the discussion section: "**First things first - everything in this post is irrelevant if NVAX's Phase 3 results are poor and do not support emergency use authorization and global licensure**." 

2. In the header for the section about supply agreements I said "Billions of dollars of revenue **PENDING SUCCESSFUL TRIAL RESULTS**". 

3. Directly below that, I explained that part of the $1.6B in funding will go towards the 100M doses for the US and included the link to the agreement. Hence, I didn't try to make it seem like they have $1.6B in cash.

4. You're wrong that the all of the funding is contingent on delivery of a phase 3 result. I'm not clear on the precise details of the OWS/CEPI funding but we know that they've purchased a $167M manufacturing facility in the Czech Republic and have an additional $572M in cash on hand that they didn't have before COVID.

&#x200B;

You're being pedantic by implying that I'm being misleading because in my reply to your comment I simply stated "$2B in funding from OWS and CEPI" after carefully explaining all of the caveats IN THE POST YOU'RE REPLYING TO. Not to mention just about every headline published about the OWS and CEPI funding use the same phrasing. 

I haven't written anything misleading but you're free to tell me if you disagree and I will respond. And I can prove my identity to the mods if that ever becomes a sticking point.

I bought about 2 moths ago. They posted profit on oct 14 and stock went down for some reason, vol was very low as well so I bought this call on a whim. Wish I had dumped my entire account into these!

I know it. They’re a different company now. Previously they focused on the raw material only. They bought AK-Steel last year and then ArcelorMittal this year. On top of that they’re launching their HBI facility near Toledo. No one in North America produces HBI. If it’s adopted by the electric arc furnace guys for a cleaner base to mix with their scrap it will be huge.

I do the same, except I have a SEP, because I’m self employed. I put 200 a month in my degenerate account. I only started gambling in February and have upped it to near 10k, but I stay away from options (except covered calls). Even still, I can’t fathom yoloing this little egg I built.

1) I've seen the issues that protein-production which relies on cell cultures like the NVAX vaccine can have. Much bigger players have had issues at their facility. NVAX can partner with whoever they like, but if they are racing to make and sell the vaccine with other companies, that puts them at a disadvantage.

2)  6-fold differences could be accounted for just based on differences in the assays that they ran and even in variability between groups. It's two labs, it's two models, it's a lot of room for variation.

3) I think you are completely misinterpreting the monkey data. First, they used a different species of monkey in NVAX compared to mRNA. Second, the NVAX study used a 1x10^4 PFU challenge compared to Moderna's 1.9x10^5 (log difference). Second, I don't know where you are getting the idea that the other vaccines are letting viral replication run rampant. Look at figure 3 from this moderna vax paper https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671 - After challenge with , replication is suppressed in all but one of the monkeys 2 days post, and is completely suppressed 4 days post. Clearly memory responses are robust here. At 100ug doses, there is also quick and thorough suppression of nasal replication. 

Now when you look at the NVAX data, where they actually gave a much smaller dose, they don't see any replication in the vaccine group. I wonder why.

I think it's also worth pointing out that monkey model's aren't everything. There is the old saying, mice lie, monkey's exaggerate.

So it makes more sense to me to buy shares if I’m ok holding long term and believe the 2/9 (or more) will be redeemable for a considerable gain

What’s the advantage of just buying warrants instead of shares at this point?
[removed]
There weren't really that many duds.  Some dropped in the short term then made gains later.

RKT was sort of a dud for those who bought late but I bought at 19.

Prpl dropped big for earnings then basically doubled in the same quarter. 

MSFT sorta traded flat for a while after it first hit 215 and everybody lost money on otm options

Vale dropped initially then soared quite a bit to 15 (considering its sector doesn't usually move much) 

NKLA is up a lot since the SPAQ at $10/share

DKNG was getting pumped at like $28 a share and it has had its dips but still doubled.
Me too but apparently the cops are anti-harambe, arrested me in the supermarket for it
Lower strike proce would have been a little better but good luck fellow retard
Automod is an anti-American terrorist.
People order food for delivery with just a few clicks. That’s the expectation now. That’s what Uber and Doordash have spent their money on. Creating that seamless system of ordering food. That’s like saying drive thru’s will not be popular once the pandemic ends. Lol
Restaurants are making a killing on Doordash and Uber. They might actually the only thing keeping them open right now. There is no way in hell restaurants will end their contracts. It’s extra revenue. It’s marketing. It’s another way to make money.
For real. It’d make things easier for everyone and go all in.

No major catalyst right now necessarily, besides the obvious EV hype and the Citi rating putting it as a buy with $25 target. For the short term, probably just celebrity endorsements and pre-order numbers. They’ve already partnered with Magna to get the Ocean into production and seems it’s all in place. The biggest news we could hope for would be surrounding production. The big speculation is whether or not they’ll get there, so if we get some sort of validation, it could get a boost. The product is nice and the lease model is intriguing, I just think most investors are concerned we won’t get to that point. IMO, if they get the Ocean to production successfully and get some cars on the road, this will be a major competitor to Tesla. Look up the Fisker Emotion. If they get that car successfully to market, they will sell a lot of them.

Strap them to PLTR and they can bounce off the moon
Agreed. I don't see much value anywhere right now.    
But then again I never do, until I do and then I stick 20% of my capital into it.    
But this is also the first time i can remember where I don't believe any of the big boys. Aapl, amzn, msft, fb, goog are terribly overvalued when spy is at ath.     
The rise recently has mainly been due to other stocks gaining I believe.    
Tesla needs to cool off and maybe a few other stocks.    
Tbh.. could just take the entire market will just do a 10% dump. When is the next fed or stimulus update?     
That would do it.    
I think stocks have risen nicely this year so January otherwise for the tax write-off.

Bought 250 @ $22.53, 25.87 and 28.26. for an average price of $25.55

Set a trailing stop on 250 which executed at 31.83 then sold 250@ 29.28 and 150 @ $28.995 and kept a 100 from the 22.53 block

Even if the company went to $0.00 tomorrow made $461 in 2 days and I still have 100 shares.

Yeah the pecking order is essentially:

\- Max out 401k up to the full employer match (free money)

\- Pay down any high interest debt

\- Max out Roth IRA 

Then either max out the rest of the 401k if you don't care about actively investing but since you're here put the rest in a taxable brokerage.

Just because RSI is high doesn't mean it's going to drop. Plus high IV. So either do a put debit spread or sell call credit spread. But I think upside is limited. Huge volume of calls that expired worthless on Friday. That means a lot of selling early this week.
You a real cpa bruh?
Right now you can buy shares or warrants. One share is worth 2/9 of a warrant at $23 if you hold thought the merger though. 

PSTH initially was listed as a .U with a 1/9 warrant attached. That deal ended in september when the units and warrants were split. Now its shares or warrants with a new 2/9 warrant deal attached to these current shares.
So from what I gather, 


Premiums on NKLA puts must still be good then.
I just came. That hulk cock is fucking huge
Futures so green they broke the market

What part of their financials? They lost money in a pandemic? Looks like a bigger upside than door dash. Pandemic = money for door dash. Once things return to restaurants at 100% their business is going to go down. While this will be the reverse for Airbnb. Once this “ends” people will travel and Airbnb will take off.

Sir, this is a Wendy’s
I have a feeling if I play it cool she won’t come at me for child support. I’m surprised she wants to raise a kid that she knew the father for only a month.
Shitty mods and too many retards. 

Occasionally there is some great DD but its just been getting banned or buried. 

I was hyped as shit when they got listed and have been in since, enjoying steady gains. Now all the morons pile in for short gains. And while plenty of people understand Palantir is a great company, you have the other side that pile on to gamble their kids Christmas money to make a quick dollar without knowing shit about the company or its potential. 

I'm all for the gains, for everyone. I just think more people should stop spamming this fucking sub with posts about it. Should be stickied threads and bot-mod bans for shitposts regarding PLTR. 

meh 

PLTR 30C JAN 2022
Are you sure you're in the right subreddit? 🤨
They are but we make money on them so who cares lol
Go for PLTR shares instead

This comment really boils it all down to its essence. Thank you sir
You throw enough shit in there and they magically call it “diversified”
Exactly the reason why I advocate selling them, not buying them. Covered calls and cash secured puts.
My female boss was hard on me but did not compare to guys. Once she saw I wasn’t bowing down she went soft and overprotected me.
What we need to buy to trigger the squeeze- autist power (yeah I know my position doesn’t do shit for this)
can u ask for nudes while ur at it
Skii?
I think they're already here
keep up the good work
$PLTR , just buy it mofo that's all you need to know
I’m assuming we are green with the Vic down -1%
we shall see i suppose. there's some ipos im interested in, if nio shoots up in feb, i may sell the feb calls and not exercise and buy the ipos im interested in, unless i go super ballsy and exercise and buy the ipos on margin. but i aint touching the $3 calls for jan 2022
Found the guy who missed out on NIO 😴😴😴
Auto mod, please delete any content with the word "Wendy's"
Where the fuck are the futures?
You spelled CRSP wrong
I don't trade futures why would I pay for live feeds?
What if I told you, we come here for the low quality shit
Sure I'm doing just fine, still missing out on a cool 50k hurts pretty bad

Monday is a buy and hold day anyway

Let's see where GME and PLTR open.  If they open flat, 💎✋ to the sweet Monday melt up.  Only if they open down bigly do we skip it

"anyway, do you want to pay $125 for 1 week to have 100 shares that are time limited for 1 fucking week?

its that simple man, that simple.."

So you're telling me you but options to tell people, "I owned that for 1 week!"? Because That's exactly what you said. I see absolutely nothing about what options actually are: Contracts to buy or sell at a designated price sometime in the future.

I imagine you probably still make money in this market but this makes no sense.

I’m no expert, but the hype of a short squeeze is kind of a self fulfilling prophecy
most of the shorts are from prices well above where we are now so they're not feeling the heat.
Zero chance, if you bought the high and then panic sold low then you're a retard with 25% less in your account. You would still have 75% left for other retard moves, there are several days of fun left for you on other shit moves for you before you quit.
Don’t even need to look to know futures are blood fucking green

Yeah. WSB definitely is a small part in all this.
I‘m sorry for your short position that you opened on Friday

GME's current CEO made Chewy the largest online shop for pets, I have no doubt he knows what he's doing and can do the same for GME. Companies with already crazy userbase don't choose to completely give up all their profits to a point where they are losing money on sales on the off chance that they keep their customers away from GME...

Oh God this new automod is really gay. You can't even say Bluud Gren anymore
Which are not working
There are many notable firms buying millions worth of this stock because they know it’s going to be a great long term investment. They’ve been waiting for PLTR to go public for years and now that it has, they’re fucking with it heavy
I did but closed my acct and switched to fidelity. Getting options with fidelity is a pain in the ass.  I’ll have to reopen RH it if I want options. I do want to play around with since everyone is jumping the gun. I also don’t wanna miss the boat, which I already did but tryin to see if I can salvage something. I’d love to see this as the next Tesla.
Where have you been for the last month
One thing that doesn't make sense to me is why short interest in GME hasn't decreased over the past several months through the console cycle. Is the shorts plan simply to maintain their position until (per their hypothesis) the company goes bankrupt? Even if most shorts anticipate eventual bankruptcy, wouldn't they expect an increase in stock performance through the console cycle? And if so why would they not close out their positions several months ago when the stock was at a low, and then jump back in after the console cycle peaks. 

This seems much more lucrative, less risky, and cheaper (avoiding interest payments on borrowed shares) compared to holding strong through console season. Was this an oversight by the shorts who now just need to hold strong or double down to avoid huge losses or is there something I'm missing?  

I don't really care about the short squeeze, if/when it's going to happen. I'm just trying to understand the rationale behind the short's maintaining their positions through the console cycle.

Someone tell investing.com that futures are open
The Bee will be the sigil of my house and will occupy a place of honor on my mantle if this thing pumps.

Also one way to snag up a RTX 3080/90 or RX 6800, both in short supply and pricey as fuck. Is to pick up a prebuilt (by Origin, owned by Corsair) PC. One with Rx will run you 2k ( the card cost 800-900 when you can find it) RTX will run 2300 ( card runs from 1100 to 1500 (90)). People are getting that desperate. I'll just wait to next summer myself.

Happened with GME. Thing went from $5 to $15. Everyone talked about it. Consolidated back to $11 for like a month, everyone forgot about it. Now is back on the rocket.
[removed]
Double, triple? Please, I bought into NIO when it was $6 and convinced my family to YOLO their savings into it. My family are *all* up over 5x in NIO, on average, whilst I'm sitting with my money in GME 😅 but that's only because I'm not in this for double or triple. 

Considering that the ATH market cap of $9bn would put them at a price of ~$138/share, and not around $60 as the all time chart shows, due to share buybacks - this is an easy 8-10x, or more if the short squeeze happens.

**PS** my entire family now have positions in GME. They all (finally) see GME upside with, and without the possibility of a short squeeze.

Even my 55 year old parents see the possibility of a short squeeze and are now in GME. Fucking bullish if you ask me. 🚀🚀

I only put 100 a month into my degenerate gambling account. I've been able to get it up to 2k in about 1 year (first stock I bought was AMD, right about now last year, got into options right before the crash).

I put a sensible amount of money into a 401k managed through some asshole on wall street. I have a very nice padded cash emergency fund. And then I take 100$ in cash and piss it away doing hoodrat shit.

Funny thing is, I don't think that 401k will ever pay. Its gonna be this degenerate shit that lets me retire.

Good questions!

Yes, i86 has less room to improve compared to ARM. ARM is a newer technology that is growing in performance at a much faster rate. Geekbench scores show the M1 comparable to the lastest Ryzen 9 and i9 in single core tests at 1/10th the wattage. To be fair this is peak performance and not constant, and also is impacted by software availability. 

AAPL actually founded ARM. They sold ARM years ago, and NVIDIA recently bought it. Apple has kept their own branch of ARM based silicon - “Apple Silicon”. They are far ahead of ARM in both performance and efficiency, and closing in on i86 on performance with far more efficiency. The latest M1 processors can even surpass the old Intel processors from previous macbook generation even when using virtualization. This is huge. 

Also this CPU architecture is proprietary to Apple. As they now control the entire end to end build and design of their devices, they can further take advantage of optimizing performance and efficiency on top of the superior CPU architecture.
This seems like such a common high thought. The induced paranoia is real

that's not a priority. Having low expense ratios is.
US Steel is shit though. That's why we import it mostly. You may be right but this will likely only happen if Biden's infrastructure plan involves forcing US companies to utilize our own shitty steel to revitalize that sector of employment.
Roll it right back in. I make too much to take any out. The man will tax the hell out of me.
How do I know their reason? I’m only reporting the numbers and the data. Maybe they don’t wanna drive up the price like Buffett?
The only SNOW play is leaps. Why would you bet against the future? Are you planning on an overall downturn? Tech still has room to move in this bull run.

WSB diversity: strike over ticker
No no no. This market isn't powered by sleepy boomers anymore. You have to look at market sentiment, not ta or pe or any of that shit anymore. The market is powered by a bunch of tards with direct access right in their pocket. 

So market sentiment then? Look at one of their direct competitors, Logitech. Logitech trades at 14b cap, 88/share. They make nearly the same products at the same price points at the same quality for the same demographic. 

You might say "Hold on, this idiot is saying Corsair will have 14b market cap because Logitech has a 14b market cap?" Yes. Because read the first paragraph again. 

TL:DR; TSLA $700 12/4

Fuck that guy
It's not what they make it's who they are traded with and how they are traded. It's whos talking about them and following them. 

The guys buying Ford and GM stock, talking about next year's models and the next "big" thing are not there same guys buying and talking about Tesla. They guys talking and buying up Tesla are talking about tech companies like FB and Google. They are talking about battery revolutions not horsepower. 

In all reality Tesla as a company doesn't make shit, by all regards they are a terrible company. Damn near worthless. Every metric you can measure them by other than hope and dreams has them as worthless. They have only posted a profit what one year? 

HISTORICALLY that's a bad thing. In the future, who knows. Ideas might be what builds company's not bottom lines. Idk.

too much danger that it becomes the next zynga imho. video game plays are just incredibly difficult because it's such a hit-based, boom-or-bust industry. As soon as farmville started losing engagement, Zynga was turbo-fucked for the better part of this decade.

Growth, the number one thing the markets look at, is just so difficult in this space, even the biggest games in the world, the minecrafts, the world of warcrafts, fortnites of the world "peak" after a few years and continually bleed players until their publisher can think of the next hit. Sometimes that never happens.

I am planning on buying GME tomorrow to have a piece of the short squeeze cake. Opinions on that?
I think I need to rollover my calls tho
The fastest supercar rn is arguably an NIO. This isn't the same 1980-2010 China with the mere capacity to mostly make cheap trinkets for the West. You need to get with the times or get left behind my man.
I got my Dad to loan me 35k so I could quit my slave job and try to turn trading into an income. I wrote a long thought out letter to him explaining how I felt trapped at my job and was confident I could really make it work. He was down cuz he is a cool ass fuckin Dad and so far things are going well.
This week I’m here to take scalps.
Shut the fuck up
3 times less than you just did.
im gonna barely lose NNN if it gets to $8 tomorrow
There are a lot of cries of an incoming correction as a result of insane P/E ratios in the market overall, which would only require one catalyst to trigger. Runoff election or lack of stimulus are potential catalysts and can cause a sharp tumble. I'm not entirely sure these scenarios will play out, but possible i think.
Don’t be a douche

my min target price for exit is $150 based on current trajectory and current competition; but minimum wait is 2022; if it hits 150 in 2021 im not selling, going to wait till 2022; ill probably sell around 200 or 300 between jan 2022 and jan 2023; if i choose to exercise i will have to hold for a year before i exit; jan 2022 i have to either exercise or sell the contracts and repurchase shares if i want back in. but have to keep watch on developments, delivery number improvements, expansion to europe and other markets, demand for their sedans, robotaxi rollout in 2022, etc.

I hope you are right on the numbers.

I'm very bullish on PLTR long term, but think we're in for a slowdown on the road to $100 end of 2022.

Yeah, I keep thinking if I save enough, I'd just buy some multi-families and rent them out, but I'd never see huge returns unless I held onto them for 30 years then sold them peak market, but it's a lot easier to just get lucky once investing and have a guaranteed early retirement with the way many landlords have been set back by covid and potentially new laws coming in as well.
Hey mind if I ask what you use for scraping?  Puppeteer?
cuz theyre both meme stocks autist lol...

wtf is an ETF
For all of you buying OTM weekly's on these MEME stocks. STOP please for the love of god use options calculator or another way to estimate profit.  For these high premium stocks like NIO, PLTR etc. the risk isn't typically worth the reward. Do the math,  What would your profit look like if you bought shares w/margin if it hits your target price vs the OTM Option profit  "I am fully aware margin calls exist".  **Then ask yourself is that difference in profit WORTH losing everything.**

100%, GM's in a win-win position. If Nikola fails they only need to find another use for their motors and batteries, if they succeed they get a huge stake in the profits just for handing access to their motors and batteries.

But you lost money instead of being patient. Could’ve just sold calls. Anyway I got it much cheaper.
Almost seems like they could front run it and then go long right after for the squeeze due to the consensus short on it.

The internet changed things. Influence moves faster now. There's a lot of propaganda for companies that we help propagate because of our positions, and we can do it faster then ever.

This weekend has seemed so fucking LONG. 

It feels like Tuesday and the market has been closed since last Wednesday.
Up in premarket, then free fall between open and 45 minutes after open.
No.. it’s definitely not. Company just turned a profit recently, no way it deserves a 50b valuation even in this retarded market

How are you saying this isn’t long term, they’ve barely pierced the commercial market. They’ve got room to run past gov contracts. They’re currently in hedge funds and aerospace so it’s not like they can’t expand, it might just take time. This has been a shares and leaps from the get go. Probably would’ve let you retire early if you’d bought enough at the $9 it was at near IPO

funny thing is my vix calls only make up a small percentage of my port yet i find myself wanting to open deeply in the red. i kinda understand why gay bears are the way they are.
I mean pltr is in Frankfurt exchange
Are we still NIO stans in here
Wait so its either Jan 2023 or early 2022 if it hits $200?

I guess I should have said, if you truly think you know what you are doing and don't think it is luck, don't take any of the advice from this thread and continuing with your plan.
Well damn GM quietly is killing it lately
They send out an email every day detailing their latest trades, no PLTR for awhile now

Last purchase I see was 1,025,700 shares on Nov 13, maybe that's what you're seeing
I'd say a diamond for sure. This sub had actually helped me a lot. Most things that people decide are good moves on here turn out to be true. 

As someone who is new to investing it's good to have people who are so interested in it talking almost non stop about investing.

Why. Seems like you just keep buying at the top anyways
Exactly. One could say bullish momentum or upcoming earnings. But either way im buying 30c weeklies
Pretty small. GM has already mentioned something along the lines of they do not need Nikola at all.
Extra Crispy from KFC is not the way. They just overbread it. Original all the way

My dad refuses to believe it can last. He says it's a bubble. 

I agree with him but who's to say when this bubble pops? Probably not until after fed raises rates which could be 2023 at the earliest.
anyone else find it odd that Microvast couldn't pony up for a SSL for their site?
Sounds weird. He was coordinating people to upvote stuff in his discord and we found out about it somehow? How would we even do that?

Hahaha good luck dude. I was wondering what kind of people rode fixies. This makes sense.
And nvidia for FAGTMAN
I'm deep in PLTR but this was fun to make
April 30c probably,
Maybe a lower strike, also shares
Screenshot? I literally saw the PDF on their website. Unless you are saying someone hacked their page and changed the position number.
I believe it will go up a little bit until Wednesday, they hype is already dying down and many people said they will sell at 30$ which is what happened. Max I see it going is to 33-35 but falling down below 30$ on 12/4.
if it dips again after earnings that shit'll be bought up and new ATH by end of Jan
Yeah those are just from bonuses or side hustles I’ve saved from over the years. I mess around with options and day trades separately.
It’s at 40 now because it might get bought out.
That ETF has a lot of strong companies that I wouldn’t lump in with the EV craze. Top holdings include names like Qualcomm, Nvidia, Microsoft, Cisco, Alphabet 

I need an ETF of overpriced trash like NKLA, BLNK, HYLN, PLUG
Pltr was miss priced and there a no more sellers
Ok so I’m a noob af, I’m semi poor with only 7k in savings I’m also 19 so that explains it, how will I know when to take out money? And what do you recommend investing at my current savings?
That's fucking epic wish I'd known about it I would have done the same.   What was your end result with the funds afterwards did they give you hassle retrieving ?
The only reason they put out these shorts is so they can buy lower.
I would totally buy a NIO those cars are nice af

duh, but no one's going to disclose their short position on GME when they don't have to. The biggest disclosed puts are the only clues. It's definitely not a hedging strategy for Melvin so let your speculation run wild

if you want something more interesting then keep a close eye on the 20,000x contracts for the 12/18 17p.  Whoever bought those on Oct 15 is now down at least $10 million and potentially expiring worthless if retard hype continues to jump into Gamestop. I mean this is the same year where SOLO reached a 1 billion market cap momentarily lol
Looking at their position PDF, it increased substantially last Friday.
Think you meant it the other way around.. GME is about to skyrocket very soon.
I saw an analysis of like 120 stocks price action leading up to, and immediately after SP500 inclusion and the vast majority of the time they dipped immediately after inclusion. Take that how you wish, because those stocks weren't TSLA
Relax dude, it’s not that big of a deal.

It’s a company that made/makes POS hardware, and the world shut down. It didn’t make sense at 50. Somehow, with most of the world still shut down its 200. Yeah Cash app, but still crazy run up imo
I've got 25 p Dec 18
Thanks
Scarn' mate. I agree. I've been pestering them with emails to get options added to their platform too which they said they'll forward to their development team. Here's hoping.
Where my Tuscan raiders at
i’m confident that squeeze like action will take place.  will it be like VW...probably not. i don’t mind my money sitting in for the near to midterm or even long term.  i have $50k in there right now and have another $20k ready for this week.
50 points in first quarter for hill lmao
I hope you guys picked up all those weeklies PLTR $20p that we’re going for 2 cents last Wednesday. If you didn’t drop atleast $1000 worth into it you are missing out on getting the fucked paid.
Only regret was not selling more or buying more and selling CCs because those babies were out of this world last week.
Thanks for the information. Could you tell me how you found out about this?
Let’s goooo baby easy double or triple for you maybe more ... I will add shares after I sell and purchase more calls
Nice, you ever take profits out? Or just re rolled and reinvest?

That's interesting. I was just thinking of making a site like this. Would you share the code on github and we can (try) make it better? You wont be adding a weekly option as well?

How did you get all the stock ticker names? I was stuck on that part :D Does it only pickup words with a $ in front?
But I read somewhere here that stocks only go up.
Lmao ya I told friends to long SQ then I proceeded to buy puts on spy myself.
Shares. Buying $3k tomorrow and I’ll probably sell and take my 12/31 35c Palantir profit on Friday and buy GME with that too. Doing my part to help ensure squeeze.
Not being cunty lol just being real. No ones going to tell you what you want to hear. Also the perks you get at Fidelity are insane. Once you have 500K you get special IPO pricing.
> Cohen was the spark that turned Gamestop from a value trap into the rally it has right now

And what happens when he sells because Gamestop told him to take a hike after he proposed his master plan to them?
That’s a respectable gain, those numbers would have most boomers jizz themselves.
Patrick Mahomes & Tyreek Hill together is a fucking cheat code haha

Pltr went from $19 to $33 on no news in a shortened week lol. Gamestop is at $16 rn.. my most conservative estimate is $30 eow. Based on this im gonna toss 1k into 30c weeklies for max leverage

Shiiiiieeeeeet.... I bought at the post-IPO slump at sub-$10 on 10/1.
Yeah honestly having the savings I did I believe is what gave me a huge advantage to making it where I have. I saved for over 8 years really so it wasn’t the easiest decision but just made sense each step of the way.

I was in this and sold around the peak after asking my software engineer friends that worked at google how often is JFrog used there. And they went wtf is JFrog.

The dip will continue into Monday and we'll hit 25. Rise to low 30s at mid week, with another dip to 28 or 29 on Friday to shake loose the expiring 12/4 30c. Slow climb to around 40 before Xmas. This is based on a reading of the secret patterns in my armpit hairs so I have very high confidence.

Does SNOW even have a moat? It seems to be in the same space as a lot of other businesses.
How far out are you puts? In a normal world that’s the right move. But the fact that it jumped to 30 proves it’s not a normal world. People are riding that EV rocket. I took my profits and will buy back if/when it drops back down (because I like them long term)

I wouldn’t be shocked it rolled back to 14 (or lower)...but this week? I think it’ll still bounce around between 24-28.
Sentiment is a powerful thing & the masters the universe know how to control it and manipulate it.

Ok fantastic, it worked for you. Just saying there are downsides to any play. If you sell on something that tanks, you still lose a lot of money.

Roblox is about to be super hyped no matter what. It's no secret that roblox has really good profits from its business model.
Here’s hoping my PLTR 32c expiring 12/4 prints. Trying to decide whether to buy calls or shares in the morning. What are you guys thinking?
Gonna get better after Corona. Do good stuff for yourself rn (get rich, find hobbies, go work out, eat healthy) and set urself up for some hot chicks after the pandemic next summer.
What expiration?
Yup. Currently doesn't want it. Told me she hasn't regretted taking hard drugs and plans on doing it all her life.

Even talking about it, makes me want to give up on her. I would have already if she was older or unattractive, which is selfish on my part.
Based on my earlier guessing, I still think it will hit $35 and stabilize around $30. I think it will stay within these ranges for a week or two until we get closer to the end of the year where that stability and general awareness of their use in the Covid response hits more boomer ears and it starts to get some more attention, bringing it to possibly $40-$50 due to more speculation. I still think once Biden's Covid response effort is fully spelled out and PLTR is mentioned as a key player, it won't go under $50 again. 

Then, depending on how much hype follows, and how much talk begins around what they do, and older management and operations literate professionals begin to see how PLTR can change virtually every industry, we will begin getting larger waves of long term investments, creeping up that price. Once that wave is in and brags about PLTR in their portfolios, that's the road to triple digits. That can be a year, or it can be 3 years. But one thing I am confident in is that by 2030, it will be obvious why it made it to triple digits.

That's right! So every time you open the site, it'll make a call to scrape the posts and return the parsed results for the table. Normally you'd do it at intervals and store in a db as a background service (and make the call to that when you enter the site), but the data/scraping is super light and quick, so there's no need to do that.

Youre assuming im ever worried about site outages. Im never overleveraged to the tits on calls or puts. How do you think I got to 25k?
I bought a couple calls for WMT and TGT.  Hopefully there is momentum into Xmas but BLACK friday was underwhelming
So you're holding leaps or shares?

Do some googling and compare rates between insurance. $250/month would be my complete guess. Same basic calculation here.

That's not true at all. The more research I do into this company the more and more your DD sounds like complete and utter bullshit.

Let’s make something very clear here: OWS and CEPI have NOT contributed 2 billion in funding to NVAX. Those are not research funding agreements, they are SUPPLY agreements that effectively state “IF you can produce a safe and effective vaccine, we will buy it from you”. Nobody is questioning whether or not their vaccine will be in demand, but rather whether they will actually do something they have failed at for 33 years and bring a product to market.

I HIGHLY doubt you’re in grad school at a top 5 university, and if you are I'd have to assume you’re acting in bad faith given how misleading you have been throughout your post history.

Wow, I never even considered that, but why didn't I? Makes a lot of sense. I guess it was naive to think that there are consistently profitable TA strategies that utilize simple indicators. I'm beginning to think I should just listen to Graham and Lynch rather than get involved in what sounds like a rat race. Even more so because I have no coding knowledge, statistics put me to sleep, and I have next to no resources.

People get mentally and physically stressed, they impoverish and lose property. That is dramatic and far from good, but in the end it's better than dying. This page does not state that people die because of a lockdown. I'd appreciate it, if you directly adressed your other statements and maybe show how you would handle it in detail. My stance is clear as I said in my very first post:
> "But it simply is necessary, because thousands of deaths per week are just unacceptable for..."

Lockdowns are necessary to save lifes, at the cost of everything else!

You overall don't seem like a nice person with all the mocking, but I wish you and everyone around you strength to get through these times. We will get through it if everyone does their part, by social distancing, good hygiene and empathetically taking care of each other! I hope you don't exert that kind of toxic behavior in your real, everyday life :)

Hey man I’m glad you had a good head on your shoulders and knowing a lot of people with immigrant parents who came to the US dirt poor I’m sure it came from a need to grow up fast as a kid. You’ve worked hard for the money you make and I can see why the idea of your tax dollars going to pay for someone else’s “mistakes” is upsetting. But what you don’t realize is the “wealthy” people who’s student loans would be forgiven aren’t actually wealthy. The true wealthy people don’t have student loans, mommy and daddy paid for college outright. The people most impacted by the burden of student loans are lower/middle class people who find their pay cannibalized by student loan payments even if they may be making more than someone who didn’t go to college, assuming they didn’t pursue their passion and end up with a completely worthless degree. These are the people who were taken advantage of, these are the people who will most likely die in debt because the value of a lot of college degrees doesn’t justify the debt you go into getting it not to mention any number of things that could happen in life to destabilize you and completely destroy the ability to pay. I think you have a rather selfish, small scale perspective and even though I can understand where you’re coming from, we’re not just talking about your tax dollars, we’re talking about generations of lower/middle class people’s wealth being plundered by a broken education system. Student loans are destroying the middle class and if you want to know what happens when in the end game where the middle class is eliminated and there only exists the lower class and the elite, read about the French Revolution.

VW the float was 1%, which is close to what it is going to be for GME too if the everyone decided to hold on. VW also released shares after 2-3 days to let all the shorts out.   That might not happen with GME. There is still the possibility of a shareholder vote induced squeeze that will be insane.

Talking about market cap during a short squeeze shows that you are utterly clueless. Sorry.

Also, it is pretty clear you will sell it before it even hits $200.  It has to go to $500 before you even realize it (and that is not gonna happen) for you to take a 6 figure profit. Don't kid yourself weak hands :)

Just wanna throw out some numbers so you don't get left bag holding

* PLTR had a net income of -1.5B and an EBITDA of $148M. The market cap of 48B is 325X EBITDA.
* Amazon has an EBITDA of $16B. The market cap of $1.6T is 100X EBITDA.
* Apple has an EBITDA of $77B. The market cap of $1.98T is 25X EBITDA.

&#x200B;

It has had it's run and 20-30$ isn't too unreasonable. But anything higher than that is just hoping more retards pump it before the inevitable dump. You're playing a dangerous game.

thats what Im saying. Because during TSLA's rise, there were a lot of WSB bears, a lot of people skeptical, etc.

With PLTR, thats literally all this sub talks about, and no bearishness is accepted. Hell, when Citron said it was a casino, this sub literally instantly morphed into a Citron hate sub.

Alright all stocks aside, is Chicago covering +8?
Ok this makes sense. So Vega will have little impact on the contract price since Vega is directly correlated to IV, and IV Is low in this case. Little Vega component implies a more affordable contract. Is that correct?
Only makes sense if options expired this week. It doesn’t have weeklies and the increments are $5 each. That would require a decent size sell off. I don’t think it’ll go under 40. Plus the OIs are low too

Hype is a powerful machine. People told me I was retarded for buying PLTR, CRSR, PTON, NIO, and SPCE back then. GME is no different

because everyone fucking whispers and uses big words
Slight pullback on Monday but will recover quickly $37 by end of week.
Citron has an accuracy of 50%. You’re better off flipping a coin than to trust their garbage shorts. I picked up more PLTR Friday at dip, tomorrow we moon📈📈📈📈

$95 for longer expiry, JD is about to break out I can feel it in my balls
if she doesn't have willpower on her own then lend her yours.
Buying from Denmark, the fees on low price stocks are more retarded than me tbh
I definitely love the craziness on here, but I really appreciate when somebody offers true solid advice like this. I'm a newb myself so I'm trying to find as much real advice as I can.
Calls are definitely safer, but don't say they have the same result, because they have very different results.

If you buy 100 shares @ $17 in the AM, and the stock goes to $34. That is a 100% gain.

If you buy and option for say, 1/15/2021 strike of $20 for $2.50, and the same $34 price hits. The option goes in the money and is worth the difference plus the theta, we will ignore the theta for this example. $34 - $20 is $14, times the 100 shares the option represents is $1400, or a  560% gain. Pretty big difference.
Sell em at open

For a second, I was wondering what kinda fucked up app screenshot is this.
I agree its got retard strength but I believe its going to loose its steam as there are to many hot sectors right now. Spaqs, Ev's and Weed are all pumping and retail investors will start selling positions. I believe that shelf share issuance is right around the corner and institutions may dump their shares.

other than the citron report, there’s no news for it to have pulled back like that. maybe it’s just profit taking from the run, but i think there’s enough new buyers for it to get back at least to thirty by the weeks end

My prediction is PLTR price will stay stagnant most of the week and start recovering towards the end of the week. Will see a small dip and then 🚀 Look at my previous cup and handle prediction. You’re hearing it here first but idfk a damn thing I’m retarded af. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0jbph/cup_and_handle/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Dude both are amazing tf wrong with you. Put down COD for 5 minutes.
You'll have long term investors licking their lips and fingers on the dip and loading up. You already have big institution buying it up, so that reenforces the notion that it's  steady, has potential to grow = investor and gamblers alike to buy shares/calls. They're anticipating for a solid 2021. 

Democrats or Republican, no party wants to gut homeland security, it's a open attack for their opponents to say they welcome terrorism. 

All in all, the CEO fundamental for the company hasn't changed. So yours shouldn't also just because Citron wants you too, so he can buy your share of the stock.
Dooooo it. The past few weeks have been amazing.
LOL! Everyone's got in in the back of their minds, but GME and APHA 🚀 get in the way.

They were  above $400 (iirc) then they did a 4-1 split back in August effectively adjusting the price to ~$100. That and I think last earnings they reported the first decline in revenue in a while
It’s going to fly this week! Dam mod won’t let me post the ticker, but this is the play this week.
My play is to manage my PLTR 12/18 35c and shares. Then move into call options that are 50% down foor whatever liquid stock and catch a rebound intraday. Rinse and repeat

Tell that to the father of TA, before cars were all over the streets. [https://www.investmenttheory.org/dow-ta--fa-theory.html](https://www.investmenttheory.org/dow-ta--fa-theory.html)
Yeah, it's generally untrue given the efficient market hypothesis.

If there's a reliable signal, x, (say MACD cross) that causes many traders to take action y (buy/sell). Then there's a strategy that front runs x and scalps people taking action y, resulting in y having lower profits. Basically, if there are consistently good technical strategies, then there's even better strategies that siphon away their profits until the technical strategies are no longer consistently profitable. Trading strategies will never be permanent and need to adapt; ancient TA strategies are definitely long dead.

For the sake of yourself. Please please please be careful for end of year. If you go into the new year with realized gains, and lose it January 1st. You will owe taxes on it. Seen this happen.

Every trade I’ve made before PLTR
It's already up 60% from last week, almost exactly like PLTR. 

Why do I keep hearing about stocks only after a massive rise?
Pension funds and other fixed allocators at these price levels need to sell 300-350b of stocks by quarter end and usually do so between dec 20-31 in this kind of situation. If prices up more, it’s worse. Tesla inclusion in spx will add to that.

Thanks but this is wrong (I'm the NVAX DD guy).

NVAX's vaccine is cheaper to store and produce, hence the lower price tag. See [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/937596/vaccines-task-force-falk-group-21-oct-redacted.pdf) for a slide deck from the UK's Vaccine Task Force and reference slide 17 for estimated prices to the UK. I'm not sure where you got the idea that MRNA's is easier to produce at scale. The whole reason that NVAX has 1B doses in supply agreements for the developing world via COVAX is that it can be made cheaply. If MRNA's vaccine was to cheap and easy to produce, they'd be able to supply more than the estimated 500M to 1B doses in 2021 (compared with 2B doses for NVAX) and they'd be charging less money.

Also, I disagree about 6-fold differences in titers being nothing. Especially in conjunction with the fact that NVAX has the only [evidence](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31976-0/fulltext#bib8) of sterilizing immunity in non-human primate challenge studies of any Phase 3 vaccine to date. MRNA's non-human primate challenge study data did not prevent viral replication in the upper airway despite using a lower viral challenge dose. So maybe those 6-fold titer differences aren't nothing.

Regardless, people are missing the point about NVAX as an investment by getting lost arguing these details (which I obviously still think favor NVAX). The value of NVAX as an investment is based on the $8B market cap. If their Phase 3 trial hits then they rocket, end of story. These other factors more play into the long term value proposition of NVAX.
Test all time high

Well on the contracts you buy.. consider IV as a "uncertainty" tax added onto the intrinsic value (if any) of the option.. if IV is low, you want to buy volatility instruments on the idea that it is underpriced, if it's high you want to sell volatility on the idea that it is overpriced (more often overpriced than under..). So basically, considering AAPL is a solid company that more often than not goes up over time, long call options is an easy way to get leveraged returns without overpaying for the privilege to do so.

Not an argument. They strongarm all competition out of existence and charge 30% of your companies profit. When competition appears they unperson that company by making it impossible to talk about them on their platform or search them in their search bars. When epic games came out and made a platform steam attempted to lobby their payment system paypal to disenfranchise them permanently. They also launched smear campaigns against fortnite saying it was brainwashing your kids with violence so parents would force kids to stop playing it. This is all common knowledge amongst the gaming community.

Your ignorance is laughable, how can steam not be a monopoly despite being 95% of the pc market.

Keep seeing these types of comments, but what’s the bull case for increasing their market cap beyond $2 trillion? They already sell iphones almost everywhere..  so what’s their available addressable market in any area? Also vast majority of reviews of iphone 12 say that it’s not worth it to upgrade because features are essentially the same as 11. I think order numbers so far reflect that sentiment, which is why stock has been going sideways. Open to hearing otherwise!

Wrong subreddit. They don't do anything slowly here your either gonna be rich or broke in a very short matter of time. And it sounds like your already broke seeing your buying in for $30. You will fit in well. Think of yourself as the wino at the track betting his last $2 on a horse that he needs to win for more booze. That's more the mentality of this sub.

Rip to everyone who pulled out too soon. We will shove this one in your face forever
Many people thought it was crazy Tesla went to $1000 after the crash/before the split.
It's already run up 20% since the announcement... Hedge funds and active trading have already bought it in to bid it up. Once the inclusion hits they begin cashing out by selling to the index funds that need to re-balance. Stock goes flat to down on inclusion day. You can quote me on that.

I fully understand the dynamics of the inclusion, which is why I went all in the morning after the announcement. However, I wouldn't be invested from here.

 I'm holding some in hopes we hit $630-$650 but I'll be selling the rest of my position over this week.  Then off to the next hype stock trade. 

Rinse and repeat.
If you plan to go shares, instead of dumping before earnings I'd suggest selling covered calls for the Friday following earnings. IV will be insane and unless the squeeze happens before then, there will still be upside potential.

There's 3 conclusions I'm making here.

1) This is either confirmation bias at worst, or a fucking J-curve at best. Either way wsb hype will lag behind actual stock movement. Usually the shit has peaked by the time autists are name dropping it left and right on here, and by the time your average lurker/normie buys in it's either a dud or you can get one or two more climatic orgasms out of it. 

2) Meaning you can either diversify in anticipation of a wsb shout out, which would result in at least some autists throwing away their 401K to buy in and elevate stock price, or develop some great pull out game. 

Assuming you get in early enough, you can ride that curve as long as you recognize that the majority of the time *you're probably in a fucking over hyped, over speculated bubble,* and your window of opportunity probably isn't jack. 

99% of this shit will never be Tesla. Hell, Tesla might even end up being fuck all with normie companies seriously getting in on the electric vehicle game now. If you play the stock version of Vatican Roulette and have great pull out game, then you can still come out ahead *before* it turns into 80s Argentina. The key with that is to be more humble than greedy, (which......the fuck am I even saying on here? Self control? lol), if you dropped 10k and only came out with 15, don't even trip. You still came out ahead. Wallow in your dopamine hit, cause the realistic chances of getting to 20-30k are dogshit, at best. Assuming wsb isn't talking out their ass and you lose it all. At least that's the mentality you should have imo. Wsb *will* pump some other bullshit up in the near future. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

3) The democratization of the stock market will get sorted out and stabilized eventually, but will be an utter shitstorm for the world economy in the meantime. Of course, I don't have a crystal ball, but I can tell you that entire countries, if not the majority of the world, have been fucked in the ass repeatedly by *very smart people who actually know what they're doing.* Or at least thought they did. Then turn around and give this power to a bunch of normies who think free money goes brrrrr. That's like putting a dude who's never driven a car in the cockpit of a 747. Holy shit we're fucked in the grand scheme of things. But oh well. Different topic for a different day. 

tl;dr There's nothing wrong with jumping on the hype bandwagon. Just hold that shit like you're playing a game of hot potato.
Even if you are correct on your YOLOs 99% of the time, you will still end up with $0.
you won't have much luck fighting the drug itself. you have to address the reasons behind for why she's addicted to them.

Mint, it was all web based and cumbersome. I guess about the only good part was the social media aggregator. I just prefer more intuitive hands on software, Palantir is marketed to be "user friendly" which I suppose it is on the interface but felt very limited as to how you can organize, review and export. Our office tried their platform for about 2 years before we stopped renewing.
If I'm understanding this correctly, everyone of us buying shares will increase the percentage, way above 100. And this will absolutely fuck over short sellers over years if none of us sell.
Dont drink too much, overhydration also causes headache. Try to avoid harsh (especially artificial) light, just try to relax, maybe take a nap. I'll have some tendies done for when you wake up

Re-approved. Sorry about your loss man.
It might be hard to tell from the chart but I started slow. I used my gains to add percents of savings as I learned and felt comfortable. Believe in what you’re investing in. Don’t be a follower. Play smart risk spreads and follow through with plans. Keep your ear to the ground and don’t trade with what you’re not willing to lose tomorrow
Which GME positions y’all building? Shares? LEAPS? Strike? April 2021 $25c for me
Earnings
I hope you don’t gamble... bet lost over 18. So many fake gurus so just wanted to ask here

I’ve got similar positions, depends on when you sell, GME has been steadily climbing but could just as likely be rammed into the ground. Earnings are next week which (depending on what they discuss) could be the catalyst for the squeeze. 

As far as i’m aware, there’s not been an official merger announcement from THC 🐝 (aside from LOO) so there’s no reason for it to really take off until then.

PLTR is looking to have a good week, and see what the bee does. Depending on how it goes, take profits by friday and roll into GME for next week. That’s my potential play.
Gamestop was riddled with a shitty board that took until this year to sell off their corporate jet. Buying Spring Mobile instead of Twitch, among many other dumb mistakes, added to the downfall of Gamestop.

The bear thesis was also that the new console cycle was not going to be a boon for Gamestop because of digital gaming. The other fear was that covid was going to delay the console cycle. Turns out all those fears were overblown, especially after Microsoft. Backwards compatibility returning to the consoles is also huge for Gamestop.

I had a negative bias against Gamestop, but it was such a lucrative play to me once I got rid of those biases. I'm not buying Gamestop in 2013. I started buying Gamestop in 2020 right after Cohen filed a 13D when it was still under a 500 million market cap. Cohen was the spark that turned Gamestop from a value trap into the rally it has right now.

But not everyone is retarded, perhaps the people short on GME were starting to think that shorting GME was probably a bad idea right before a console cycle. Q2 was going to be bad (and it was, outside of cleaning up the balance sheet) because of covid so they must have thought they had plenty of time to cover. Ryan Cohen caught them off guard. And now we're in November with 13F's showing that institutions were buying up the dip in the $10-$11 range in October.

If you’re looking for advice on how to reliably make some money in the market with limited risk, look in a different subreddit because you are going to fuck yourself here. If you’re looking how to turn 30k into either $1,000,000 or $0 in three weeks, this is the place to be.

Selling Treasuries and gold, buying GME and PLTR. Fuck a crash. Fuck all the bears saying there’s going to be a crash. Not this winter.
Read Citron's recent publication about it. They call it "a generational buy". I've been all in on JMIA for a few months.
So 2.6% of 72k is 1872. So I’d owe that every month? There’s no way that’s way too high
how many
It needs to hold lower 30 support or it will fall back too mid to high 20s. I am out of CRSR... It is still far heavily valued over competitors. It is a hardware company. not software and they don't have the Apple like hype.

Yea, literally got a Street Account notification after that Citron tweet.
Lol don't listen to these autists, vaccine news are hyping these stocks up like no tomorrow and there are no brakes. I'm not saying hold CCL forever, but you will profit from Jan-March
I’ll throw the rest of my buying power ~5k$ not riding other memes on shares. I honestly want wallstreetbets to hump wall street on GME’s short squeeze to finish off 2020.
Whachu talkin about Willis?

How does this compare to PLTR situation? It doesn’t. 

You need a percentage gain section and then needed percentage of loss required to bring the gains back down to $1000
The price is higher per contract on the later ones because you’re paying more for time/safety. Think about it like, who wouldn’t want more time? That means later options will always cost more

a lot more big wiinners? perhaps if you take out all the 1000's of WSB kids who are actually losing though..  

for those 10 posts you see "winners" I know, I never thought I'd be the punk saying it, but there are 1000 losers for those 10 big winners..

but that is the truth.

The losers usually don't post their losses as they are now in shock how much they just lost in 1-2 weeks..
Technical Analysis is like predicting the future after it already happened. Astrology is a much better predictor of market trends.

Yes always to the dollar. Mm's use percentages so higher share prices make no difference. Puts are negative because you're hoping on price to go down. So for every decrease in share price the put would increase by a dollar

Listen to yourself man. You're just making excuses and putting the blame on other people. At 18 I was already capable of knowing that there was no way in hell I was going to be able to pay for any schooling. My parents were dirt poor immigrants and I have a disabled sister. I had nothing or no one to fall back on. I wasn't able to go to school for that and many other reasons. I had to immediately work. I bagged groceries and collected shopping carts at Northgate Market in Compton, CA before I was able to find a better job. I always just kept looking for better and better and better until I got to where I am now. I don't depend on anyone and I never made excuses because if I did that meant I would go hungry. You do realize that the people who would be forgiven are those who are college educated and therefore better positioned to make more money in any field compared to non college educated people? For every $1 dollar of loan forgiveness that would go to a low income family $5 would go to a high income family. How would it be fair for my hard earned tax dollars to benefit the wealthy when I had to make major life altering sacrifices? Those with a college degree need to do something with it and make money.
Like in 2030 when countries start enforcing their mandates
This sub isn't all terrible people, check out the DD posts and google anything you don't understand and allow yourself to go down the rabbit hole and hopefully you come out the other end with more money and knowledge.
I live in a very shitty state. 325k would buy me either a really nice house and no land or a lot of land and an ok house or a good bit of land and a medium nice house. My current house was only $110k

Got it. Silly me, I thought you meant the words you said. Turns out you actually meant "buy low, sell high" in this discussion about whether WSB ever loses money on meme stocks.

You win, you're absolutely correct. Nobody lost money on NKLA provided they bought lower than they sold.

PLTR, obviously. Don't know how much, but I plan on either going bankrupt or TO THE FUCKING MOOOOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm starting to scale out of it. Up 760% on the calls I bought the morning after the announcement. I think there's room but but not going to be another $100+ jump to $700/share. Until the inclusion, buy the dips sell the rips.

Exactly, people like my type of personality maybe shouldn’t even touch options again. Seems like no matter I have $100 or $1M I’d blew all of em eventually. Some people do very well on options from the beginning.. I plan to save money for a year or two and start investing conservatively... but then my mind says “take a loan and do options and make a fortune, you can do it” ahhh I am scared to touch it again.

Solid investment opportunity. Africans are well known for being good with computers and the logistics of running international companies.
This is a relief to read. I’ve just started investing and learning to trade, and everything I read regarding shares is like, “in 40 years, your $1000 investment can become $100,000.” Bruh... I’ll be a fucking old man in 40 years! I don’t want to wait that long for only $100k. But then everything I read regarding quick gains seems to involve either options or day trading, and options scare me and I don’t have enough money to day trade. So, your post gives me hope.

Any advice?
desperate times for gme bagholders
ok on my behalf tell her that she's a fucking idiot for a spice.
Ive been on WSB for a long time, but Ive never seen greed quite like the greed around PLTR.

Shit has been going vertical for weeks, and everyone is still all-in and mass downvoting anyone who says anything bearish.

If it drops, you all deserve it.
Biotech made a huge gap up on Friday and everyone here is still talking about PLTR, GME, TSLA, and EVs. Sounds about right.
No puts only calls PLTR TO THE MOON BABY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If it's itm I let it go. If it's otm and way below what I sold it for, I'll leave it if I don't have any expectation of it going up enough short term (rkt with average assignment at $25) to collect my pennies, otherwise usually I'll close it out and sell another one for later expiry at a good selling point

They do not even ship Ryzen 5000 CPUs to some countries because the demand is too high and they can't produce enough for USA. AMD will moon after the next earnings, so yeah, the kid is right.

At least you're not shadow banned my dude. I started off with trading penny stocks back in 2017 and WSB's mentality reminds me so much of that crap now.

At the same time there seem to be a lot more big winners these days.
if you invest in spacs with floors, margin isnt to risky
comparing options market to bread in retail stores.. interesting..

anyway, do you want to pay $125 for 1 week to have 100 shares that are time limited for 1 fucking week?

its that simple man, that simple..

If you have insider news on something, then yes, you can overpay for options no problem, but otherwise, look for options that have decreased in value, or purchase options after bigger dips in the market.

Yea they probably do that but don’t you think that they would have had some shorted shares called away on the way down
You missed SPCE.  Branson's character is impeccable. Playboy was neighbors with Epstein and not even implicated.

JMIA, aka african Bezos.  Citron is now bullish on it, similar to NIO before the run up.

Bullish. I went on StockTwits and a lot of people are mentioning WSB. Good sign for GME
People with a lot of money know things you don't.. mostly because of networking, some DD, and insiders.
Massively undervalued turnaround story in a roaring industry with a billionaire making moves to take over.  March will likely be their best quarter in history after 2 years of bottom of the barrel expectations and there is massive short interest. Any of those things is worth a nice double on stock price
Ok
He/she/it/shit’s trying to influence. Post history is anti PLTR and pro GME.  It’s not hard to imagine having money tied up, and wanting to shift focus back.  Good on you for encouraging a break from the intense campaign.

What i dont understand is everybody in this sub is loving this movie when we're the type getting fucked in the ass by strattonites with trash stocks
I get it this is a momentum play.  I fully understand why you would throw money at this expecting a short squeeze or short term surge.  At least with RKT,  NIO, PLTR I don't mind holding a bag.  With GME I would sell at a loss if it didn't work out pretty much immediately.
Retard strength runs out when people take profits lol

There are a lot of institutional bagholders who bought Jumia at IPO and higher prices, and pumpers have driven this up to levels where even those people are liable to take profits

Going all in on GME. Check out amazing DD from  **Uberkikz11** at stockwits if you want to know why. Not a lot of risk for the potential crazy payout.
I'm going to stick with Chinese EVs and PLTR, but I hope you pioneers find what you're looking for in GME. Godspeed, autists.

What’s the news on them?
How so?
you’re right. thanks man
I would pick BNTX over PFE because PFE is already huge in market caps so price movement will be minimal compare to BNTX. But the premiums and IVs of BNTX are crazy stupid high. Not much gains. Meanwhile, PFE premiums and IVs are fucking dirt cheap lmao. Buy PFE calls expecting about $2-3 increase (too much optimism) with FDA approving their vaccine news.
Exactly, everyone ignored my comment about buying calls for earnings next week. So I doubled up lol
Not decades. But 5-10 years. 

Other manufacturers don’t build rocket ships. 
Tesla’s IP is an unfair advantage and people will really get a sense of that when they roll out Cybertruck. 

Also not sure why you’re skeptical on FSD. Full 5g implementation will take us there. 

And yes, everyone’s getting in on EV but you should be aware of the fact that Tesla isn’t only about making cars. When the day comes where everyone’s driving EV and most of which aren’t Tesla’s, it’s likely they’ll be charging at Tesla charging stations. I also wouldn’t be surprised if Tesla begins licensing out their tech to other manufacturers

With all that said, Tesla has tons of upside and probably more than enough to handle any possible drawbacks

How often were you checking / swapping shares etc out of interest
It's funny, your description sounds like I could have written it myself, except bought only one house and a large stake in a local small/medium business whose board I sit on instead.

Knowing that you're also in GME is the tiny nudge I needed to get my gamble on in that side account I also hold.

If I ever stuck to my bearish zoom positions in the past couples months I would’ve been wiped clean. I still think there will be an eventual catalyst that will sink it but for now stay away from retard stock

Market makers (eg Citadel, Two Sigma)— they’re the ones who sell you every option you buy. 

However, they don’t want directional risk so they attempt to replicate the payout of the option via buying/selling shares. 

This hedging process is why options market influences share price— lot more detail and nuance here, I suggest watching at the video about the Greeks (it’s circulating in this sub) and reading the squeezemetrics white papers if you want to understand how option flow affects markets

I’m 18 and I don’t trust these guys, I only trust YOLO CALLS from anyone over 21, so is PLTR still hot daddy
So for those not holding GME already should we just buy premarket?

That last 400K parabolic run made my pee-pee hard.
Ok I see how this year was probably not the best for using TA, particularly in the earlier part of the year when things were crazier due to COVID. But what about now? Volatility isn't as drastic (albeit still high), and as I mentioned before, the number of new retail investors added this year was is at insane highs. If a good portion of them are like me and are exploring security analysis techniques, I would expect an increase in users of TA, which would increase the viability of commonly used setups...right? Or am I missing something?
It’s already mooned (has more space) didn’t they stop in a couple of countries because tensions in war areas?
Don’t have PLTR so Blackpink for free?
can someone tell me about PLTR? I haven't heard enough of it
It's pretty easy to code up a scraper for news on the company websites of stocks you're tracking or for sentiment on reddit/twitter. Then combo that with technicals.

Most things that are easy are already being implemented/arbitraged away. But if you can come up with a unique insight or find a niche strategy that larger players overlooked, then you can make a profitable algo.

This means 100% of outstanding shares need to be bought up by short sellers? 

How often does it get updated?

Even with this squeeze, I just don't see it going up to 160 (10x).
A $12 increase in 4 months is a squeeze? Also care to explain why short interest went UP during that time

It’s a good company, but I wish I had sold last week before the big dip. Still positive but I should have taken the gain to rotate in the thicc 🐝
because you can look up the short interest online. it is still 100%. this is info that is verifiable. it was shorted this much because it was supposed to already go bankrupt. it is not happening. i never go all in on one stock but I would never be able to forgive myself if I didn't. Buying shares is low risk and the potential payout is 10x

I’m not a long player usually. Just swing. Look for opportunity  3-6 months out  usually. But I’ve had losers as well. Xspa and aytu were loser COVID plays I had. Nobody has only winners.
TK was trading at $1.80 a share before the election it's at 2:50 right now. I made money selling puts. that's cuz I'm a retard who just happened to take the exact perfect play if I had real money.
Shit. Thanks
Idk what kind of ghetto broker you use but we get Starbucks at our Fidelity. 😆

For sure. Options can basically provide that leverage or better without risk of margin calls
I mean NIO is definitely going to 100 at the latest DEC of 21. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.
Did you fomo in at the top? Lol, you deserve it.
It was either a 10% or 15% discount. It also stacks on-top of other (affiliate) discounts. I will save me more money in a year than the cost of a single share, let alone the gains from it.

If anyone actually think Cohens idea for GameStop is good research Epic Games Launcher. It’s literally the same exact idea. The only difference is that Epic has 10x more money, and Epic Games Launcher is still getting slaughtered by Valve. Even after buying $300 million worth of exclusives...
Don't be in it for the hype. Be in it because the company will outperform all other Chinese EV companies. Be in it cause, while it may not be worth what Tesla is, it can at least be worth 1/5th of what Tesla is. $100bil market cap easy.

Not unless we do $CORN each time we make the front page. That was fun.
$6k a month for my son.
I mean I wouldn’t say flat. 12% isn’t huge but it’s enough to make money on shorter options in. I have 250 March calls also. And am still accumulating. I’d like to have 1000 before announcement. I spread my risk out so the rest will probably be further out. If they announce before they could be lotto tickets. Just an announcement of who they are going to merge with is all I need for the pop to sell. But yes I’ll be accumulating more further out safer calls
>So I see a lot of people buying options just before quarterly earnings and I'm thinking to myself "the uncertainty is basically already priced into the option premium". If you're looking for a fair shake on your dice roll for a big-risk, big-reward scenario, just go for biotech stocks about to release Phase 2/3 results or applying for marketing authorization.

This logic is backwards. Expectations and interest are "baked" into IVR for earnings but that means that not all stocks experience extreme IVR *if the interest of the broad market is low* which means that you actually can make a lot of money in the case of swings, in fact, just as much with IVR.

Biostocks however run through sheer uncertainty; the IVR value may not matter much for them. They're quick to rise and be abandoned.
But what side of the lawn did the dog shit in?
FUck! I cant wait that long... Long ROPE!

there's now like 2 a week
Amen brotha
I wouldn't buy $1000 worth weekly unless you don't mind losing all $1000 every week. If you have significantly more than a mil in total assets that is not crazy for a potential 6 figure payoff. I'm not a millionaire, not crazy far from being one (mostly because I'm 10+ years older than most people here) but losing $1000 each week on lottery tickets feels like to much for me. $100 per week over 10 weeks is ultimately meaningless so why not. The payoff on $100 isn't as great but I am not looking for a single bet to make life-changing money. Just enough to fund a non-PDT restricted account would be great.
Tuscan ehhhhhhh
I mean that's a steady growth post it's not like the dude put in 10k on OTM FDs and scored an overnight gain.

I wouldn't stress over it. At our sub count and demo, there should be plenty of millionaires. You can be a childless dev in a HCOL area and you'll hit that in asset in 3-5 years. (Or less? Fuck if I know what the comp packages look like these days).
A lot of people grow up ignorant/poor and as soon as they get a little money or get away from their family they compensate for their lack of culture by being into "travelling"

Not necessarily win win. It limits your upside most of the downside is still there in your SPXL example. There is a fund that constantly sells calls to the S&P 500, I forget what it’s called, but over time just owning the basic index yields better results.

buying 12 shares of PLTR and 21 of GME. am i stupid? idk how options work lol
Well on the bright side, if GME does manage to somehow magically squeeze, I'll buy the fuck outta puts at the top. No way they'll maintain anything.
Why cash out now?! That’s crazy. We keep going up hold it.
Dude I know what he’s trying to do. Look up Epic Games launcher, it’s literally the same exact fucking idea, they have already poured $200 million+ in order to buy exclusive games from Valve. Way more money then Cohen is going to be able to spend...

Epic Games launcher at the moment is all intent and purposes a failure... 

Just look how much money Valve makes from Steam, and then realize that rumors have it that Microsoft and Valve are about to partner together to implement Game pass, the future of gaming, into Steam. Gamestop stands no chance against these giants.
buy calls then

They can sell puts against shorted shares to hedge, exact same way you sell a covered call.

What I love most about this sub is the power of dumbasses coming together to make a YOLO play. Most subs back in the day would pump and dump you leaving bags. I don’t feel this here. I feel trust. I feel a tingle in my bear/bull balls because my animal sentiment changes with this sub.

It’s ok. But in the end it’s not realized gains and is just a small step towards the real goal. I could and have lost it the next day. So I try not to get too emotional on big days anymore. It’s larger longer moves with conviction over consecutive days that get the juices flowing. I’m not a day trader so a Single day gain doesn’t mean much.

When's the deadline for that?  He said end of this week?
Those are not leaps, but I guess anything more than a month out of considered leaps by the new wsbers
So what you're saying is that phase one is the gamma squeeze phase two is where the retards weeklies expire worthless and phase three is where the leaps break even if they get bought during the gamma squeeze
please let it be so...my 12/4 120c's will thank you.
I don’t expect life to be easy. I don’t expect everything to be handed to me. But I also don’t think it was fair that as an 18 year old with a non-existent prefrontal cortex I was forced Into making a decision against my best interest. The college scam is forced down the throat of all high schoolers as the only path to success and I will be bitter til the day I die that the “college counselors” I had allowed me to go down the path I’m on. I think the number of people who went to college never planning to pay back their debt is far smaller than the people forced or tricked into because they were brainwashed into believe you’re a failure if you don’t go to college. Although I would benefit from student loan forgiveness my motivating factor is to prevent any kid from going through what I did. Being saddled with crushing debt as a teen is something I hope future generations never have to deal with.

Guess mods are cool with obvious shills pumping a shitty meme stock
If consumers wanted to exclusively buy directly from manufacturers then Best Buy, Amazon, etc wouldn't exist. There is value to having a collection of goods from multiple manufacturers in one place and in the case of Best Buy and GME, value in having experts available to explain the difference between those items. Plus, GME and Best Buy can offer deals on different combinations of those items that aren't as likely to be found if you buy direct. 

As for the squeeze, my minimum price target is $25 by this summer without a squeeze and just based on the stock being hilariously undervalued. A squeeze is likely, but not the sole reason to be in GME.

The majority of my position is spread between Jan and Apr calls at the $10, $15, and $20 strikes. If we stall at $25ish after April, I'll sell puts all day long until we break and stay above $30 at which point I'll reconsider my plans.

**You can only choose one.**
The prices actually don't (and cannot) tell you anything.

A little example:

Let's say you go to store A and you see bread for $1.00. Is this expensive? Is it cheap? Well, how do you define that? You define it by other products of the same type, that is, bread in another store.

The problem with options is that there is only one store; you can look at Implied Volatility Rank to be able to tell how that bread's price moved within the store, so for instance, it was $1.00 at store A last week too, but two weeks ago it was $.25; the bread is definitely expensive relative to two weeks ago, and so ultimately the only reason you'd buy it is that you think the bread will become *more* expensive in the next few weeks, perhaps to $1.25 or such, but one way or another you can only look at the historical version of this store to see how the price is.

Understanding options pricing is a shitty game because you can't play with these same options even in other "stores" (stocks) across a sector. Certainly you can say that the IVR is lower for one store than the other but ultimately that just means it's cheaper to buy and crappier to sell. For buyers lower IVR means it's "on sale" and vice versa. One of the reasons I didn't buy into PLTR too heavily is exactly this; once the IVR went through the roof it becomes a seller's market. The people saying "PLTR is cheap!" are absolutely lying in the objective sense.

Sorry, this wasn’t entirely clear. The firms give out TurboTax to employees to use. When the firms do returns for other people they use pro series or one of the fancy programs. Just an FYI the $300 for a CPA to do your taxes assumes it’s pretty vanilla and you don’t do any forward looking planning. Tax planning for the future is really how you save the big bucks so after you pay them to do your return and maybe get you some cash back this year, pay the hourly rate to sit down with them to do some forward looking planning.

Those are some savvy picks.  Great read of the market and how it would act.  I still don't believe in some of those stocks long term which is why I have trouble figuring out the best way to play these things.  GME probably is a great play right now going into the holiday season and the new consoles, new managment etc.  It's immune to the naysayers and has good story behind it.  Next summer?  Stock will probably half of what it is now.  But who the fuck cares about next summer I guess.  Win it now.  Good luck to you.  I hope you cash out at xmas a millionaire.

Earnings isn't the play at the moment. The play on GME is aiming to be in for the potential short squeeze that's building up. You can do an earnings play if you'd like. But the short squeeze play would give you so much more tendies.

🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽
This is also something I considered, and I was planning to ask this in the sub at some point in the future. If TA strategies are supposed to work more often than not (thus making it a viable strategy), why wouldn't all technical traders use algos designed around these setups for more time efficiency instead of finding and executing on setups on their own? Many if not most technical traders I've seen touting their success seem to rely most heavily on pairing technical chart setups with catalyst events like news releases or earnings, perhaps this active involvement can't be accomplished with algos?

What I really like is that they are using economies of scale to really make a business behind simply flying people out of Spaceport America.  Based on all the information and what company executives have mentioned building a fleet of spaceships that will be used in more than one spaceport.

Once you start looking at projected revenues the company can bring in with multiple spaceport and how much each one can bring in terms of profit, you start to have a very profitable business and a valuation that should be a lot higher than what it is now.  Perhaps north of $50 billion if done properly.

First things first though: we need to finish the test fights, and launch commercial operations with the flight of Richard Branson being the first.

Assuming all that happens, even in the short term the company appears to be just on the start of a much larger bull run!

Depends. We've been in a holding pattern of pumping recovery stocks and selling tech on Monday/Tues then rotating back to tech. Memes are resistant to market trends, but we need some fresh ones.

Seems too predictable now tho and I'm half expecting a curveball. I feel a little disadvantaged right now because last week was hilariously low volume on a lot of shit, so we're probably at the mercy of whatever the returning big money boys decide to do

I thought performance is worse while energy efficiency is way better. So I agree that ARM will dominate for consumer products, but how would ARM replace i86?

But I dont see how they have an edge over competitors by using arm when everyone can use it

Watch it.
Just from why your saying though I can tell you don’t understand the gaming market. There were already examples of companies beating Amazon, Blue Apron, Hello Fresh ETC. 

Every single large gaming company has tried to make their own game browser to sell game, and without fail everyone is failing. The only two to have marginal success is the epic games launcher and Battle.net, and even then both are minuscule to the empire that is now Steam/Gamepass. It’s pretty clear what the future of gaming is, and it’s game by service and online purchase. All of which are already monopolized on PC/Xbox with Steam and Gamepass, and monopolized on Sony with whatever games by service they are releasing. 

If you can prove to me that Cohen is willing to spend more money than Epic Games and Activison Blizzard to compete with these giants (which you cant) then I see no positive outlook on Game Stop.

This is known, I think people are just betting on the short squeeze where it pumps to like $30 and then dumps back down to the $12-15 range where it belongs. It's not so much an "investment" per se moreso just a lotto ticket in case that spike really happens

I'm not touching it tbh. PLTR, Bee, and PSTH are way better plays

The real play was buying massive amounts of shares early 2020 when everyone left it for dead at ~$6 and then selling at $15 this week

I think a lot of those people went into it knowing they weren't going to pay that shit. I can see what you're saying but, nonetheless it's still unfair. If they want to get back on track they should make sacrifices to pay it off. I know a damn good amount of people who didn't have it easy at all in life but, they made sacrifices and they paid their dues and are better off now. Let me guess though......youhave student debt? lol. Quit whining. Life isn't easy.

What I really like is that they are using economies of scale to really make a business behind simply flying people out of Spaceport America.  Based on all the information and what company executives have mentioned building a fleet of spaceships that will be used in more than one spaceport.  

Once you start looking at projected revenues the company can bring in with multiple spaceport and how much each one can bring in terms of profit, you start to have a very profitable business and a valuation that should be a lot higher than what it is now.  Perhaps north of $50 billion if done properly. 

First things first though: we need to finish the test fights, and launch commercial operations with the flight of Richard Branson being the first. 

Assuming all that happens, even in the short term the company appears to be just on the start of a much larger bull run!

They literally designed their own ARM chip and are switching their entire platform from x86, that's a ridiculously bold move for a company so big. It was a big move when they switched from RISC in the past, but doing so with such a huge base is amazing tbh.

Oh of course, last Friday (20th) people paper hands PLTR too then it shot up like fucking crazy Monday-Weds, I made a $1000 a day on it. Then people cried on Friday because they didn’t make 100% gains on it in one day. The Friday pullback was healthy and I’m long on it in shares. PLTR is not in a short squeeze situation like what people are trying with GameStop tho.

Didn’t see your early expiry. Betting on weeklies while stocks are consolidating are probably not a good gamble. No one knows how long the consolidation will last and you could get lucky and it breakouts but it’s a blind gamble. If it was a later expiry(2+ months)not as bad...but for these weeklies, I’d wait for a breakout + conformation.
resold sneakers for years, particularly during the nike SB crazy pre-2010. trust me when I say you can't make a living doing this let alone get rich, particularly in 2020 where everyone and their mom is running bots to try and snag these highly-in-demand items.

it's just practically impossible to get the kind of quantities you need to make significant profits. in the sneaker game the guys I knew who were able to do (dozens to a hundred boxes of the latest jordan release etc) all had quasi-legal insider arrangements with distribution centers or stores; it was all really shady shit with basically the same kind of atmosphere as drug dealing and most of those guys either eventually got arrested for sale of stolen goods or had their connections get shut down by Nike, etc.

When is the merger meeting? The 3rd?
If you actually read about the VW short squeeze you'd realize the reason why it went up so quickly. Even so, a 500% gain for GME would stop its rally at $80. A share price of $500 would require GME to squeeze literally over 3000%. Show me a squeeze in history on a company currently valued at 1B. It's unlikely to run all the way to a 30B market cap, at least in the next 6 months. Either way, I have a sizable position as I believe in a rally due to other reasons. I also do believe it will be short squeezed, but not as high as alot of people on here think. If it does indeed go to $500 I'd be more than happy to donate 10k to charity because my profits will be well into the 6 figures if it actually hits that share price

Really? I had the exact opposite thought. Granted I have less than a year clocked in the market, so I can't rely on past experience, but I would have assumed that generally high valuations and PEs, generally high volatility, and massive increases in retail investing activity make TA *more* viable than fundamentals rather than less. Why would you say this year is not suitable for TA?

Amazon gets 88% of it's revenue from online commerce.

Yet 56% of it's actual net income comes from that small 12% AWS chunk. So it's a bad argument to begin with, even if it doesn't apply to Tesla yet.

The biggest take away should be that the margins you make from a segment is incredibly important. Like if Amazon could convert all that low margin online commerce to cloud service margins the company value should really 5x as well.

Tesla is transforming the entire auto industry from low margin into a high margin industry by selling "smart" cars. Just like phones went from boring bricks nobody cared about and cost around $200 to things that run your life and cost $1,000.

That is not even mentioning Energy storage which will be Tesla's AWS.

>During 2017 Tesla, Inc. won the contract and built the Hornsdale Power Reserve, for a capital cost of A$90 million, leading to the colloquial Tesla big battery name.  
>  
>It was constructed in 2017 to supply 129 MWh at 100 MW.  
>  
>In November 2019, Neoen confirmed that it was increasing capacity by a further 50MW/64.5MWh. The expansion would cost A$71 million

129MWh / A$90 million = $514/kWh (USD)

64.5MWh / A$71 million = $811/kWh (USD)

Meanwhile Tesla will be making 3 TWh of the stuff for $50/kWh. Add in $100/kW something in transformers, supporting equipment, container to ship and install it in.

Why the fuck would anyone pay that much for an overpriced battery?

>By the end of 2018, it was estimated that the Power Reserve had saved A$40 million in costs, mostly in eliminating the need for a fuel-powered 35 MW Frequency Control Ancillary Service.\[32\] In 2019, grid costs were reduced by $116 million due to the operation of HPR (Tesla big battery).

You noticed how the first installation Tesla charged $514/kWh then bumped it up to $811/kWh to expand it? Tesla doesn't really want to use it's batteries to make big grid installations right now; Tesla wants to make cars. These utility companies are so horny for batteries they'll pay Tesla more per kWh then Tesla makes per kWh putting the battery in a car and selling the entire car.

**Model 3 LR**

$46,990/75 kWh = $626.5/kWh

Legacy auto is completely irrelevant to Tesla's valuation.

When is their ipo good sir? Do we have an estimate on their expected share price? Do we have any knowledge of big players taking a stake in the company? Is this good enough for high effort you fucking automod?
Inverse implication: A 100% gain covers multiple losses at a rate which, when using options, secures the idea of longer dated and higher costing optima for decay and recovery purposes.

elvis isn't dead.  i just spoke to him.  he's taking a big position in tsla and toilet bowl manufacturers.  bullish.
With tight S/Ls and if you know what your doing, you could literally be right 33% of the time and still make damn good money.  If you don't know what your current win rate is, how much of your account you're risking on each trade, and you're target growth then I wouldn't be surprised if you end up losing all your money one day.
We all know this, but the problem is WSB is infected with many real shills, (I even get accused for shilling the futures!) and it's actually amazing how whenever I post something that will actually make or did make people money, is when you get "accused" ..

I know for sure WSB has a controlled strict police mechanism and they absolutely shadow ban (where others can't see your comments and more) 

they do take down certain posts very quickly that will not help the insiders and more.

and really really think about it, if you were Goldman, Blackrock and many many others, why wouldn't you have accounts on WSB saying shit to help your positions??

that is how it's been since the beginning of man, man always wants to control everything and more..

it's just the human way..

there will always be scams, pumps and dumps and more especially here on WSB..

This concept is already an emerging trend among the comments. Are you suggesting I choose buy-and-hold tickers based on fundamentals, and use TA exclusively to find a good entry point? In that case wouldn't the fundamental analysis of the company's intrinsic value suffice?

Can zoom be included in the S&P before New Years?? What else are they lacking?
I think short-term it will go down again. It's fever pitch at the moment. Having said that, Tesla only seems overvalued if you think the are a car company. They are not a car company. Even if they did only make cars, they are a very different type of car company so couldn't compare to others. Pure BEV with no sunk costs in legacy technology and production lines. Vertical integration, fast innovation. Holistic design. Already auto industry leading margins and only just spooling up. 500k cars this year, 1.2 million next year. Industry beating efficiency. Best charging network. Best brand recognition. Best driver assistance. Inhouse silicon chip design. In house industry leading AI department. In-house corporate software. Direct customer sales. In house robotics development and custom production line engineering. Industry first hot casting of chassis.
Original material design and sharing with space x custom alloys etc.

Then the non car stuff.  Telemetry based in house insurance, HGV, solar, in house original battery cell r&d, in house custom cell production line, industry beating cost per kilowatt hour. Energy storage at domestic, industrial and grid scale. Load balancing services. In house Energy brokering software, distributed virtual battery storage platform.

Possible future products. Transport as a service Robotaxi etc. AI could compute as a service with DoJo, massive scalable self supervised machine learning.

With HGV (semi) there's scope for baked in logistics software which Tesla has already developed for in house use.

I was a hopeful sceptic on full self driving but the recent Full Self Driving limited Beta release had me thinking they might actually do it. 

I think in 5 years it could be more valuable than today.

Incumbent auto only really do general assembly and drivetrain development. Everything thing else is outsourced. This is a serious disadvantage when trying to catch Tesla. I think VW has a chance. Their CEO gets what is going on and knows they need to bet the farm on pivoting hard.

Many of the old guard are lost. Culturally hampered. The more popular brands might get bought it by battery and technology conglomerates like LG etc. The profit centre is moving to battery, power control electronics, motors and software. Not typically the speciality of the auto industry. Tesla's real competition will come from fast followers. New Pure EV companies like Nio etc. and any of old guard who get it.

Maybe..🙂
Anyone top $33. 19 yet?

I honestly don’t think anyone here is bearish on PLTR. 

We just don’t think it’s going to open at 50 like some of you autists.

Just buy on Monday 😁

I hope so, but reading these comments I think he's right. Taking away the barrier of entry to invest in companies has resulted in dumbass shooting these companies into the stratosphere for next to no reason beyond taking their shitty ceo's word for it despite the track record of bullshit haha some of the arguments in this comment section are fucked.

Would you advise I stay away from TA completely? What I've learned from my readings so far (which have been primarily focused on value investing), my gut reaction was that I should not be involved in this market at all, and that when I do get involved I should be looking at multi-year timeframes. But being greedy as I am, I want to be able to trade more often, and at the very least find out for myself just how BS (or not BS if it turns out to be profitable) TA is.
My prediction octopus said sideways
This is what I’ve been doing.  Jump in with calls if you can get in early, shares after IV jumps, sell after further runup, then switch to Theta Gang when IV hits 200+.  I’ve been able to post regular 20% weekly returns just running the wheel on small cap EV stocks after the initial runup.  Premiums to fund option buy in when hype rotates to next sector.  Lather, rinse, repeat

If you're holding PLTR like I am, do not let the 🌈🐻's scare you. They are just coming out of their hidey holes to strike fear into your hearts. 

PLTR 40 EOY.
Green open, pltr sell-off as well
Your idea is correct, but you just should use options for certain things..

There are far more ways to make money with options than with shares but when you combine it with shares, you can really do some interesting things.

for example, this is what WSB won't tell you but is the real way:

You buy 500 shares of SPXL at $65/share, then you sell 5 calls at a strike of $75.

You literally make money from $65-75 with your shares, but if SPXL sits flat, or pulls back, or crashes, you make the money from the calls you sold at $75..

It's a win/win scenario.  

I'll explain more if you want. but it gets way WAY deeper than that, you can literally sell options to pay for your calls in a way to where you make buying options cost you nothing..

You can sell puts and use the money you get from selling to buy calls and more..

it gets wild, and WSB doesn't tell you those things, they just want you to lose it all in 1 week with buying just single calls..

and that is why you see the losses you see on WSB, they don't use options correctly.

Send me a dm if you want to see it in action. I can even let you paper trade options and see the real results in realtime and see why options are actually the way to use with shares..
Our company's Christmas bonus to all the employees is too high, puts on my company.
This is the way
I honestly think the PLTR FOMO and hype energy is mostly gone. I think you saw it crescendo on Friday AM with that opening surge. 

And no, I’m not gay. I have PLTR calls. But I just have a feeling. Am I wrong ?

Gonna roll my 1/21 IVR 4c/5c into 1/22 5.5c.  Shit's gonna pop eventually, just probably not in the next two months.
Use with 50MA and trade with the trend. When price breaches, go hard and exit when price closes back inside.
Bought 31 $20c PLTR for an average of .75 each contract a week ago when it was around $18-19. Could have been up $40,000 from $2,300 if I didn’t have a weak ass stop loss that made me sell at .50 RIP

Hexo
I trust neither tbh.
I don't know how BSX doesn't get talked about here with the reversal it's about to have, fell on news and has been trying to recover even though it wasn't that bad. Check there 5 year chart out too. BABA still has plenty to recover, and for more risk/reward PTON but have a stop loss set (even this one I'd be careful entering, got in a bit earlier already). Think it's gonna run up another time before it dips

If a stock is constantly being talked about on here prob means you missed it (PLTR entrance right now would be stupid really). They hype stocks because 1) they're stupid and jumped in now and are gambling, or 2) have an early entrance and are just high off the gains so they constantly post. 

If the Ant IPO for BABA gets a date announced by end of q4 I think it'll push the stock back into almost full recovery (not completely since it's chinese and theyre all crazy rn). 

Last, start with larger market cap stocks if you can afford it. It'll save you so much suffering honestly unless youre just here to gamble too
No dude

Wrong, most people just don't know they have a data cap till they get a big bill for the "data overage" they used. It costs an extra $50 or so if you actually want unlimited.

if you look at the price of puts, they actually haven't gone down much, so I'm sure they're fine.

A significant amount of people here have a gambling addiction, so sports betting is how they get their fix on weekends when the markets are closed.

Google it to get more info but basically yes you do make more money on calls but you need enough shares to be bought in order for the squeeze to happen.
don’t bet against papa
If this ever happened it would happen through their own first party software not from a third party like GameStop lmao

SO MANY new buyers on this sub now are going into GME are going to paper hands and fail the plan
Sad to hear. Hope it all works out.
I am only up 40% since July, basically $100,000 to $140,000, not insane gains but I am strangely okay with it. Especially because I have gotten to this point slow and steady, I had losing weeks for sure but I never over extended myself.

I have been a gambling addict for 15 years, and have to say switching to "Investing" has been a nice change. It meets my gambling dopamine fix, but due to the lack of finality doesn't trigger my bad tenancies.

Gambling you bet on black or red for instance, you know the result pretty quick. Options have a final date, but you can sell at any point while stocks last forever. Removing the finality and thought of "Failure/winner" from the equation has made me not crave it as much.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Chasing gains will leave you unfulfilled and probably broke. Be happy you got to where you are and try to replicate it. Those with bigger gains, likely also had more at risk.
Really? You have more faith in the retards here actually HOLDING SHARES?

lol
So what does the futures look like? What’s PLTR looking like in Frankfurt.
I expect a pop in pre-market and melt down throughout Monday.

You’ll be a happy camper this week. If you want to solidify green sell the calls whenever you’re comfy and don’t look back. Hold the shares for year+ and it’ll be worth more than whatever gain from the options

E: saw those were all contracts buy shares dummy I know it’s wsb but that’s free money with whatever play money you have leftover
What are the chances GME continues upward?
I think you have that analogy the wrong way around haha Michael Barry literally has [denounced tesla ](https://benkinnard.substack.com/p/tesla-burry-and-a-passive-investing) 

From that book/movie I remember him say a thing about how obvious the previous housing bubble was from clear markers like an increase in fraud. Doesnt take a lot of research to see all the fraud in this industry, including within tesla

When trying to video call someone on instagram, what does this mean? It says "contacting..." but never "ringing..." before the call ends stating "didn't join." It's suppose to go from contacting to ringing. 

Does this mean they're logged out of instagram, phone is off, or what?.. Google isn't helping me on this one.

120x dec 11 $23

60x dec 4 $30
So do you still believe this short squeezing is coming then? Will have to read more on their developments as, while I don’t think they’re a blockbuster, it seems like they represent a middleman that most companies don’t want to keep long term. We have seen more developers choosing their own platforms over Steam for instance, and in this case GME is edging in on profits of MSFT and SNE who are also taking the profits of devs. 

I suppose it just surprises me consumers aren’t trying to buy directly from manufacturers/developers when the only difference will be going to a different website to buy the game they want. If GME had their own hardware or could function without dependence on the bug 3 consoles it’d be easier to wrap my mind around why consumers still use them.
Not yet, road to $30

That's basically in alignment with the reading I've been doing so far, and seeing these all-time great investors sticking with their fundamentals and value investing principles certainly did stave me off from technicals and day trading for a while, but the market we're in right now seems to be rewarding the other side. Granted, I've been in the market a whopping 6 months (during highly volatile and unprecedented market conditions) so I don't have the experience to tell me otherwise, so why would **you** say technical analysis is garbage? Both sides have their arguments, but the soundness and validity of their justifications are what matter to me, not just their viewpoint.

What’s the benefit of buying warrants vs the shares itself when the shares will grant warrants?
I invest really aggressively and I love coming here to see how much fucking stupider you all are than me, it makes me feel great and super mature and fiscally responsible. Like, I have tons of AMD, ETSY, and TSLA, and even a little bit of SPCE from one day when I got super stoned and made the mistake of actually reading the dipshit comments in this fucking cesspool, but I fucking waited for lows and bought big, and now I'm sitting on mad gains that I keep telling myself aren't real, praying that they will be millions by the time my kids are grown so they can pursue their dreams.

And like, is it a bit risky? Yeah. 

But I'm still not as fucking retarded as you lot.
He’s swing trading on stocks. From what he’s said he sets a 2% stop loss and goes all in on a stock he’s researched. Let’s the stock go up for a few days, cashes out at 5-10% gain, and starts over reinvesting the gains.

Thinking tesla's product is decades ahead of anything the other manufacturers are producing today. And If you bring up their inflated epa ratings they use for advertising compared to other makes im going to throw my phone because that's bulkshit. Apart from that you would have to be retarded to think EV powetrains are exclusive to tesla. Fsd is basically a drink driving simulator and anything beyond adaptive cruise control with lane assist is a lie. Level 5 autonomy likely isn't possible in our lifetime so tesla fsd "advantage" may as well be vaporware. 

Even of the other car companies needed a decade to catch up, what happens in ten years when they have? Because currently, tesla only has 1/10 of the highest selling ev cars in the world and that lead is getting smaller by the day as 145 new EVs are being released this year alone while tesla is still taking interest free loans from stupid people to produce vehicles tjey had no plans or intention to or that literally can't exist in the first place e.

boring as fuck? or hows it
#the way I get a stock price to go down is just to sell credit put spreads.

#when you sell credit put spreads, you trigger the HFT to have to try to oppose you, and the only way for you to lose money when selling credit put spreads, is if the stock price hovers around or below the strike you sell puts at.

#so, sell the Tesla $400 puts and buy the $390 puts together and you have a credit put spread, which will only lose you money on the day of expiration if Tesla is below or right around $400/share. 

#that is thetagang and how you really short the market.
Good research. What everyone should be focusing on is that some HUGE investors are piling into this and they probably have talked to Bill and know what it is. So if it’s not Stripe that’s ok...it’s still something that is seen as incredibly attractive in the eyes of these huge players.

NAKD and ENZC are micro stock gambles, I can literally sit on these forever and hope either one can do something in the future and I'll be ecstatic if either approached $1.00.

Don’t use TA to pick a ticker, use it to find an entry on a ticker you’ve already chosen.
It’s not for the long term. It’s riding the waves and knowing when to get out and back in.

Do you think it’s too late tho a lot of them have jumped up pretty good
Because most people haven't sold yet despite losing their profits and probably will if they see a 2nd red day in a row (or even a flat day). 

I did a poll the other day, most people on WSB are still holding their calls. There's SO much selling that'll happen on the next dip.
Don't pressure it too much.

It all comes out in the wash if you’ve liquidated all of the impacted positions. It’s not that big of a deal

If you can afford to keep your money in AAPL for that long and also have more to put in, I'd suggest buying more to cost average down. Maybe you can sell some of that off on the nice big pop. 

The other question is, is there a more sure thing of a bet you could possibly have your money in? Would it make you more profit than you have on the line with the AAPL play? Sometimes it's worth it to cut losses and run into something instead of waiting for a position to come to fruition. Not always but sometimes.

Great way to lose money, so makes sense you’d do that if gay.
i dont think so.

its two put spreads.

itd be similar to a calendar spread i guess.

The credit spread is to offset the debit spread. If it goes up, youd look to open another similar spread near expiration of the short one.

If its itm, then youd look to roll it downward. Your debit spread would likely be itm at this point as well.
The switch has been sold out since March. People were paying 1k on ebay for switches in April.
The best online key seller websites make a FUCK ton of money. If GME got into selling Steam keys, along with download keys for Xbox and Playstation at a better price than they can really take over the entire market + fast deliveries for new + used games (good margins), a system to send in your games for credit, they could build the biggest library of used games. They're one of the few companies that can probably undercut the competition and afford the loss to obtain max loyal customers.

GME has actually been positive EPS if you remove the goodwill impairment over the last 2 years. Goodwill impairment is bullshit running thru the P/L so therefore it's been profitable up until covid.

I have no idea which meme stock will outperform which. Maybe NIO or PLTR will continue to outperform GME, but I lean heavier on GME since it's at least a value pick so I still perceive a lower potential downside on it

but i mean if you were planning to start trimming profits on NIO or PLTR, there's no harm starting to average into a different position. It doesn't have to be all or nothing, let your winners keep running, but trim profits just for risk management purposes? Everyone has their own style

I mostly bought weekly call or put options. The mistakes that I repeatedly made and eventually got me broke are:

1. Not taking my profit when a position is already in green (thinking it might go up more) and then next minute it becomes red and I don’t close it thinking it will go back to green, but by the time it’s closer to the expiry date the option is already worthless... 

2. Overtrade many times with irrational greedy mind. Even though I had days that I made nice profit (like turn $100 to $1800, $50 to $2000 etc,,) I took that profit and jumped into next one right away without clear thinking and the next thing you know all the money’s gone. I should’ve just log off and enjoy my day after a nice profit day instead of over trading mindlessly until the money is gone. 

3. Not sticking to my DD and plan. I’d make some nice research and trading plan prior to some trading but somehow I don’t stick to my plan and do some shitty moves which is not inline with my plan... there’s one time I lost $2000 for not sticking to my plan, if I’d followed my plan that $2000 would’ve turned to $18000.

5. All in on weeklies left me $0 almost every time when a week ends, I should’ve used at least 40% every week instead all in and deposit money after losing it all

4. Too many insane lotto like trades instead of making few well thought out quality trade

Edit: I bought weekly options because of make rich quick chance

How you planning on playing your PLTR position? I’m holding the same calls.
Beautiful

As someone who's used Palantir, it's overrated analytics software for data, emails and social media. There's plenty of other competitors that offer much better functionality like NUIX. Our office rarely used it because we had better alternatives.
Trading up 2.24% in the after hours, just friday profit taking, the stock price appears to have a floor and I know many here bought the dip. They are shares worth buying and holding.

There isn't much to do but Sell credit put spreads on these cruise lines.

The big boys know it's too cheap and so they quickly bought them up before the people can get it.

RCL was a steal at $40/share and lower, CCl was a steal at $11 and lower.. 

but now you are buying in the high middle range.. so I think it's best to just sell credit put spreads or buy covered calls and keep selling the calls for good premium and letting your shares get called away forcing you to get profit every single time.

Ok, help me understand this I read that s1. Mind you this is pure speculation not financial advice, BUT here we go.

1bn in yearly sales is cool and all but let's kick them in the balls real hard with operations expenses and say between paying people's salaries, taxes, rents,  prostitutes and all the other big business expenses (1m in company cocaine minimum req.)  they operate with 800-850m including everything. Leaving   a sweet sweet 200-150m in tendies for them. 

They are offering a total of 21,000,000 million shares  including class a (1share-1vote) and class b (1 share- 50 votes, for the big dick energy investors) 
 Why should you give a fuck about this? Because I have a calculator and a brain operating at .03% and i used the division function of that calculator. 

Sales total, value per share is like $47.somethin
Earnings after deductions per share is $9.who cares.


So then why the fuck is the preliminary sale saying 0.56969696969420 (I rounded) per share!? 

Thank you for reading my autist talk.

Tl;dr, why the fuck is the ipo only .56 cents!? If they have over a billion in sales?
💯
I’d love to see $50/share I have 48 FDs for the 24th
Alright so next weeks plays are:

PLTR calls because insane FOMO and Hype

NIO calls because delivery numbers, hype, and NIO day coming

TSLA calls because Daddy Elon

GME shares because the WSB millionaires and Micheal Burry said so

You can buy calls if you plan on selling the run up on the IV. That is my plan. But I also have shares for long term.
and that is why you will win and the options holders will overpay.
I'll try it

Oh yeah cuz this market makes SOOOO much sense lately
Your right. But I was smart enough to sell b4 the drop, then rebuy when all those contracts got crushed. Even posted my massive gains on it on this sub

Okay so we're the same

What are you referring to?
You really shouldn’t do what I do. I generally buy in the after noon. When I’m ready I see where the bottom band is at, when the price drops below it, I buy because the stock will likely go up at that point, but it certainly doesn’t mean it won’t go lower. TLDR I’m retarded.
Frequently. I cope by YOLOing on high-risk plays.
Already have DraftKings $50 March 21 and will be buying GME calls tomorrow!!
How are you making money on tesla puts if the stock price is increasing?
Maybe but not for long, Comcast is rolling out the data caps they have done in test markets to all their users. Spectrum, Verizon, ATT and Century Link are expected to follow suite in 2021. Of course you can still pay more for unlimited but most standard home internet packages are going to have data caps soon.

People are buying in due to the potential of a short squeeze, which is an incredibly rare event where short sellers are forced to buy back *all at once*. 

The thing is, call values are extremely over priced, so it's better to just buy shares and sell covered calls.

Man, all this gain porn jades my perspective so after a +15-20% week i’m pissed my account didn’t triple lol
nah. retards paying 900% markup with no right to repair is what is profitable.
Could be! Who knows. Tomorrow is probably a good entry point
Tough to say honestly.  Great for the medium and long term.  Lot of factors at play for tomorrow including the house vote on accounting standards for Chinese listed companies.  But on the flipside we have the run up to nov deliveries which is next week....also run up over the next month to nio day.  Short term plays always risky but just get expirations a couple weeks or a month out.
He’s telling you autists on Twitter to short TSLA before 12/21. Will you listen to the king?
True for PTON.
That’s generally what I’m doing but it’s not a sweat for me because I have the shares to cover dumbass moves and April calls 20s and 30s. Also the premiums are higher now so you get less bang for your buck on the OTMs unless they start writing 40cs

As ronoron mentioned there’s a speculative range where these shorts break but there’s no guarantee on price alone. These guys are burning cash but they have the cash to burn to an extent.

A catalyst causing a price burst from current levels would be more likely to trigger one. Obviously nobody knows if and when that happens. There’s also the reality of post earnings price movement which new wsb initiates would get anxious over but if you’ve been in for awhile it was expected.
Even without the squeeze I think gme will hit 25 in the next 2 weeks based on hype alone. Only sell those calls if you want to lose money.
$50 in Calls...? You can buy maybe 20% of a decent call

You’ve got almost a year just hold or you’ll be kicking yourself when Apple is $140 and you remember selling these
I haven't heard much intraday usage before. Do you just look for a squeeze to confirm a good entry? Cause I see it can squeeze to reverse trend and I see it can squeeze to continue trend as well.

Fuck it. Ill toss $500 into 130c 12/18
I think it's both. GME hit a price resistance so in order to push above, it needs the strength of new money. Draw a line at the current price, and zoom out as far as your charts go, even to the mid 2000's and you'll see why we're at a pivotal point. There's a reason why there's still a huge short interest.
I was looking at those also not a bad play looks over extended

Better to ask these questions on GME/PLTR specific threads, but if you're taking no explanation recommendations shares in either with probably be in the green at some point. To understand how to time them though you, again, really need to do a lot of research looking through the pltr/gme specific threads.

I think we get a nice bounce
I think we have hit peak euphoria
Maybe 1 or 2 more weeks
If you’re truly serious about it, one path would be to get a customer service job at a firm like Fidelity. They’ll likely require you to pass the Series 7 (and probably Series 63) first...you’d have to figure out what the path/timeline to a supervisory role there would be (at which point they’d sponsor you for the Series 24.)
they dont last
Ok thanks dad
You got me!
"wanna bet I don't?"
Solid balance sheet and cash position, larger so less downside risk . They have had very good returns pre covid , best for business travel and their service culture tends to be rated better . American Airlines has higher short term upside imo but long term im in on delta
It’s $145 😬
*laughs in RKT gang, purple gang, Kodak gang, post earnings nio gang*
Different types of traders but buying on breakouts is one of themz No one can predict it always but buying on breakouts(and usually waiting to bounce off resistance->that becomes support) is one way that a lot of successful traders use. And yea...a lot of failed breakouts so waiting for confirmation through retest/time/volume is a good choice instead of just buying the initial breakout.

I’ve bought and sold ccl calls with great success this year.  It’s moves are so dramatic.
 When float is high, shares are available to buy. When float is low, shares are not available. The VW infinity squeeze didn't happen specifically because they were highly shorted, it happened because they were highly shorted AND the float was in single digits (VW locked up a kajillion shares on purpose).

The ratio of shorts to float on GME has not only been increasing in 2020, but accelerating as large portions are getting bought up by speculators and institutions. Does this mean there will be a 5-10x squeeze? Almost certainly not. But there could be a few multiples if the stars continue to align.
BAN. Also obligatory 🚀🚀🚀
If you’re not satisfied in a relationship, then break up
I looked it up just fine
Rh doesn't support warrants. I am not sure warrants are a better move, just a suggestion. Would have to check options prices and shares. Shares come with 2/9 of a warrant attached so buying shares in rh if you plan on holding long term may cause trouble. Don't know how that would be handled.
Agreed. I see what we do here as no different than what institutions and ultra-rich individuals get away with regularly. If anything I believe what goes on here is far less incriminating. But similar to what you said, we aren't worth the expense to Reddit if the SEC decides to crack down on the platform as a whole due to us.

But I'll just remind everyone that the mods could easily auto-delete any post containing the keywords GME, or short, or squeeze...
All in on nasdaq futures at open or what?!?
I mean, you can literally do it right now with just 25% of your account. You could be making like a steady $6000-7000 a month (if not more), easily, with virtually no risk, other than getting assigned shares, which in reality isn't even a 'bad' thing to have happen since then you can just sell covered calls on the stock or hold and sell it when it goes back up regardless but keep the premium.

You can make a full-time salary on like $50k, I can't begin to imagine what you'd be able to do with $1.2m.

This company is complete dogshit, and the idea that they will all of the sudden out compete companies with vastly more resources and human capital is...beyond retarded. The evidence you laid out in these posts is far from convincing and most of their other failed vaccines have shown high antibody numbers then complete shit efficacy (manipulated data?). This is a long shot play that has already been priced for perfection. Monthly death puts it is.
Is the move to liquidate my NIO or PLTR to pick up GME tomorrow?

I'd buy tomorrow because this sub is going to pump it then sell when you feel you've made good enough profit. This sub is gonna pump and dump gme so hard
Assuming that’s short term gains, that 1.2 is actually more like 600k-800k

Weed stocks have been pumped every time there's news like this, then even if things turn out well there's a sell off, APHA and GRWG typically lose the least but ACB will and has gained AND lost 20-30% in a few weeks at times like this.
Good time to buy some shares?
Fair enough - although it was also profit taking across the board later on Friday.

Guys just went off to buy TVs and shit.
Good pick

I did make a quick 50k in pltr. Was honestly trying to accumulate options before it started really popping off. Missed out a bit. If they mention making a deal with Ryan Cohen during the earnings call or that they bought back shares or great guidance I’d suggest it. Could have a pull back from earnings or the big shorts could say fuck it and just get out and rip it too. Lotta factors.

Buy shares, because people have to buy and hold for the squeeze to happen and it could occur literally anytime in the next few months to a year at most so it’s impossible to time. If you really want to buy calls wait till after earnings.

I was looking at some 2021 calls. The hype scares me...
This is a 1/15/21 xp contract. This is not a Yolo this is just a regular long dated option play.
Agree with all of the above. Good stuff.
the gamma squeeze came when softbank showed up in august and the market followed suit, tsla still made significant gains over the months before that without whale calls. gme has been experiencing the same positive feedback loop with significant gains each time their is any sort of neutral to positive catalyst, should only become more drastic in the months ahead w/ high q4 ER expectations
[removed]
Ssss
I’d like to get a little bit of a pullback but they are starting to gain traction and honestly it’s still at a great price. I just have all my money allocated already so I need to wait till I’m out of a position. Will keep an eye on them tho.
Plenty of other plays in this market dude. Plus, 1 share of tsla would be pretty boring

First time throwing money into shit coin this weekend to get my gambling fix. Just closed positions for $250 gain. Not bad
Given how bullish we are on gme (now) will the shorts double their tripple down before earnings? I'm kinda hoping for sub 12.50 open on the 8th just so we can take extra lunch money from these nerds.

Just stop.  ETFs getting 8-12% returns from this point forward. You'll get blown up if a highly speculative stock has a 20% pullback. 8-12% returns on ETFs is still like $100k+ in returns every year, which is more than most people make.

So wait for it to bounce on resistance, spike upwards, then buy high when there's not even technical analysis predicting which way it will go from in the middle of the channel? So it could just go back down to resistance?
Tombstone frozen pizza.
Short squeeze incoming
It does. But again. Taxes. Plus my job has a great 401k dental health all that. Shit adds up quickly. Plus the way I’ve traded with higher risk is all because of the fact I have a safe job to fall back on. Without it I would have to play quite differently. But I am moving towards that hopefully
I'm not  convinced that saying people should buy a stock because of ANY potential event happening is orchestrating/manipulating the market any more than every other hedge fund, bank, or merger corp. out there does on a daily basis. But they have money, and lots of money, and lots of lawyers, so i see your point.
Just a matter of running the numbers and setting up your holdings to minimize the probability of taking a 20%+ balance hit by holding until you make it to long term gains. Ultimately you’re looking at ~37% short term vs ~20% long term so as long as you don’t lose more than the difference by holding, it makes sense to wait.

If I were you I may consider de-leveraging a bit but with how ITM the lions share of your calls are, you may be insulated enough to not take that much of a hit regardless of underlying movement.
Legislation won't pass. But the states will keep legalizing

You’re selling otm pltr calls? Thats a sure way to feel alive
Yeah I have have shares up against options, I rolled my Jan stuff to April on the run to 16+. Still play weeklies as lottery tickets because it’s fun. I don’t understand the people who went all in calls November, as it was never recommended. I like your 40 target I was hoping for 30.
Buy Bose if you’re not a peasant
Will likely go up several bucks this week. Can sell before ec and buy back in after. If it goes down you made profit goes up you are only a little bit behind. Just a thought
Just kiss her and have sex already
So basically, it's going to be a green week.
Currently heavily mixed into various strikes in both January and April. If there's a run coming up into earnings I'm thinking of rolling all my January calls to April, in the chance of a post-earnings dip dragging my January calls down into their expiry date.

Don't worry, I also have plenty of shares.
[removed]
Nope. Shares are held in a trust at $20 a pop. If you don’t like deal you can cash out at least at $20. I’m not sure if price can go below that.
Yes been doing DD on them. Long term stock but worth it. Long term stocks don’t really make it to meme status tho.

Thank you sir a hidden gem that blew up, hope it has momentum going at least the way it did.

If Gamestop is "going bankrupt like Blockbuster", why are the bonds trading above par?
My man you made a masterpiece. Thank you for the laugh.
When someone shorts a stock, they are essentially selling shares they don't own to collect a premium while leaving them negative shares of that stock. To close their position they must buy back the amount of shares they sold short. Ideally this is done where you short sell the stock when it's high, and buy it back when its low, keeping the difference in price as profit; the opposite of buy high, sell low.

But you more or less pay rent on those shares you sold short, and the higher the stock price climbs the more rent you pay, essentially.

When a stock price rises rapidly enough (usually due to good news about a change in fundamentals for the company, or a person/institution makes a move to become majority share holder) holding this short position rapidly becomes no longer profitable, and can easily and quickly move into becoming a major liability. At that point it's in the short sellers best interest to close their position buy buying back the shares they were short. This raises the share price.

When a bunch of short sellers are forced out of their positions due to rising costs from one reason or another, the price can increase dramatically. The shorts are squeezed until they pop.

But this is wsb so I'm just supposed to call you a retard and say "nobody tell him", so pretend I did that instead of explaining it.
**I have reflected, in recent hours, and as OP, a lot. I realize the take is controversial. But the ensuing discussion thread has been so instructive. Tomorrow AM I will advance this position from $70K to $125K.**

Agreed. And I guess with the post of people can realize how slow I started. I played off of simple percents going in deeper to things that were already up. I don’t play weeklies. And use a spread of risk.
why whats the news and whats the target price?
This is the way.
If you bought 10 shares and it only hits 29 you're up 75%. Your option expires worthless. Farthest out of money call for 12/4 is 29 at a cost of 0.11 or $11. If the stock had a short squeeze and exploded to 100 it would be worth $71 or $7100 for the whole contract or a 645x bagger. Every additional $ in stock above that is an additional 9x. So 150 stock price would be 1000x. If it hit 300 it would be 2350x. 

If it went up to 100 in a short squeeze you would gave a point. Might even be worth taking such a gamble for the next 10 weeks. Put in $100 in the farthest out weekly hoping for a squeeze. If it squeezes in any of those weeks and goes from current price to 100, 150, 300 you could make 65k, 100k, or 235k respectively. If it doesn't you are out 1k over those 10 weeks. Not a big deal.

Now that you mention it I think I will give it a shot, only due to the potential squeeze.
believe 6/15/21. i have to double check.

You’re right. 

Went back and looked at the transaction. I mixed up some of the details.

Good stuff. Just read your other comment that your goal is to stop working normal job. Don't know how expensive your lifestyle is or how big of a paycheck you are used to, but here in Finland, i could stop working easily if i had 100-200k account to trade options (selling premium for cash flow).  Anyways, your account is life changing. Be careful 😳
Or you could do a small clip here and there and connect them together when you hit a 1000bagger or when you lose all your money.
You're probably right too. Market closed early on Friday, Pltr ended on a small upward tick. Who know really,  I am just guessing here.

all of them
These are just what I’m in now. Biggest by far being Gme. Why? Well I started getting in late spring and summer because I wanted a “COVID safe” play. Well why Gme though because they are brick and mortar? Well because they had just changed out ceo and I believed they were gunna cut cost and improve. Plus look at the price in the summer vs the last two times consoles released. Easy buy that I used simple averages to average up and get deepe in on here way. The biggest mainstay that has kept me in is Ryan Cohen. Otherwise I probably wouldn’t be as leveraged. I use a spread of risk with shares/otm options and itm usually. Picked for 3-6 months out around a news event( not earnings)

Momma said they'll be days like this
It's impossible to predict it so I stay away from relying on a short squeeze. Not touching any of these silly 30c calls that are already around a 10% premium (ridiculous) despite being 100% OTM. There are some rumours (seekingalpha) that $18 is the breaking point where risk management would force them to cut losses, but I wouldn't base my positions on GME on that alone. It's just a sweet bonus on top.

The foundation should be that Gamestop is still at rockbottom valuations even at $16 compared to its peers in brick&mortar despite their clean balance sheet and future growth prospects (new console cycle, Ryan Cohen, video games in general, Microsoft digital revenue sharing, etc.). It may look like they pumped hard already, but that's only because the market thought covid was going to kill Gamestop so they had valuations around 0.05x of revenues before August.

 At the very least, Gamestop could do a turnaround like Bestbuy did in 2013 then that will  leave them with a valuation around the 3 billion market cap (0.5x of revenues) range at \~$40/share without a squeeze.
If you're buying the dip. Go look at MG. call it the big dipper. 🤣🤣🤣

Jesus Christ this is the most retarded thread I’ve ever been on. Literally no one in the comments knows what a stock option plan is and they are spending their parents money on stocks

Movie Wall Street is free on Amazon prime right now. 

I watched it again and noticed they were buying option calls and then bid the stock up with share purchases to make those calls pay out huge.

Movie really shows that to make the big bucks you gotta insider trade like a mofo, go all in for a few years, risk jail but with a chance to retire in your 20's.

Yeah, I understand that but idk why it’s not verifying my identity with the information I’ve given them. None of my friends had to do this. Did you get verified after you sent that info?

That’s all I do boi. Try to time the big moves -  trim and leave a runner. Short S/Ls. That’s how you get the big gains and minimize risk. Look for bearish or bullish divergence on you oscillator of choice and look where your vwap is at. Use Ichimoku Cloud to see how strong the trend is. For the love of all that is holy stop using 1m, 3m and 5m timeframes. Use 15m like a man and be patient. Trading should be boring.

If you compare the balance sheets of GME and Blockbuster as it was declining, you'd see two very different stories. Blockbuster was losing oodles of money and had huge debt levels. GME is cash flow positive and has enough cash to cover debt. Additionally, GME is benefiting from secular growth and therefore can stagnate in terms of market shares and still grow revenue. 

They are finally closing stores in a meaningful way and pushing people to order online which will improve margins. Microsoft and Sony benefit from the existence of GME, which is why you see the revenue sharing for digital-only consoles with Microsoft and likely Sony too.
Him pushing conspiracy shit is bullish. Keeps him distracted while they move all his shit out the White House. ‘Keep grandpa talking while we load him up to the nursing home’ type of deal.

Once he gives up on the conspiracy bullshit then be worried about him doing something to cause a downturn. But even then his in immediate target will be those close to him in the intel world. Powell and mnuchin are safe.

Producing just one car requires a massive amount of resources, engineering, and time. If it was easy every manufacture could come out with a new model all the time instead of just updating the models they have every year like they do.
If Melvin first bought their puts in Q4 of 2015 then the share price was at about $40 at that time. Would it not stand to reason that they're still in the green until shares are at least near that price again?

Ya think of it as a free call option. If you buy 9 PSTH shares on Monday (likely around \~$26.50) and you HOLD those 9 shares through the merger, then Ackman will give you 2 extra shares at a buy price of $23.
Tesla might hit $700 until Friday. I see a 40% chance of this happening.

Remember, when Cathie Woods went on CNN with her $7000 base case, everyone called her crazy. That's $1400 split-adjusted.

If Tesla can sustain their growth rate, they might hit a market cap of 4 trillion.

No. Because like I’ve said. I don’t want a nice car or house or a fancy trip. I want to quit my job. I want to continue till it’s sustainable and it certainly isn’t right now. I don’t have kids/wife/ or mortgage so I’ve used that opportunity to extend my risk. It just makes sense. In the end if I lose most of it I won’t regret trying to hit my real goal. I hate my job.

It’s scary to see a meme without PLTR
We seem to have the same strategy. I started with $1,200, bought the dip and sold when I made 5%. Rinse and repeat until I was at $9,100. Then I got my money stuck for 6 months when I thought I was buying the dip. Was just able to sell for a profit 2 weeks ago. I’ve made another 20% since then. Hoping to stay on track this time around. Congrats on the gains! Hoping I get there this upcoming year.

Yes, this is true. They are very close to each other.
I think it would be illegal for Ackman to offer a legally binding SEC doc with info and then ALSO sell the ticker on an app that won't let you access the agreed-upon warrants. In short, I don't use RH but believe strongly you will get the warrant equivalents some how. This is obviously worth you just clarifying and switching brokers now if you can't access warrants easily.

Not saying you’re wrong, just curious why you think GME still has room to do well. It’s easy to say another opinion is lazy, but I don’t see the advantage they have over Best Buy, Vintage Stock, and other brick and mortar companies. Plus, they’ve had a bad rep with consumers for years. Nothing about what they’re offering seems proprietary or even preferable compared to most other businesses in the same market.

It’s tough. As long as Ryan Cohen is in  I will be in. I’ll probably hedge earnings
First step would be to get a job at a FINRA member firm. Only a FINRA firm (and other similar companies) can register someone to take the Series 24. You can’t just walk in off the street and take the 24. 

Second step would be to get a management position at the firm you joined, since the Series 24 is for people who supervise and manage. So your firm won’t sign you up for the test unless it has a reason to. 

TLDR: Don’t take this bet.

Lots of people shorted it. So now, they have to cover their short. If the price starts going up, they panic and buy it, driving the price up more. Its their panic, not the stock itself driving it up. Its called a short squeeze and it is a common pattern. The gains will be short lived, but a smart day trader can take advantage and make some cash quick.

I don’t really use margin. My biggest gains were from otm option calls but none of my big plays I felt were that risky. I find something I believe in or makes sense should go up and use a spread of risk. In the form of shares/otm calls and itm calls. It’s all simple percentages and risk/reward.

To get the specifics you should read their SEC doc: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520191638/d930055ds1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811882/000119312520191638/d930055ds1a.htm).

In short, the 200 million (really 222,222,222) shares) is a public offering associated with 444,444,444 warrants.

I think it will go up. But what do I know I’m retarded.

I’m long aphria, but I’m just very long I wouldn’t buy a put. It’s still really undervalued compared to its peers, I’m just gonna let this one ride

What about a all in PLTR play? seems more
reasonable
Wow damn. One of my comments got removed for low quality.  

Anyway, I got scared friday and sold half my OSTK $80c calls.  Will buy them back tomorrow if I get the chance. 

May watch PLTR and if it drops further, I'll load up on calls
Biden twisted his ankle after falling

So angry retard it is. Maybe you'll have more luck betting on sportsball?
Yeah, the only shot Dems have in a state like Georgia is generally going to be in general elections when they can maximize turnout. They have slim to no chance of winning an election in a place like Georgia without full mobilization.

would y'all advise a man to put a grand into PSTH shares or into PSTH June calls? thank u in advance. just wanna go to tendie down with daddy bill spacman
In theory yes, but let’s be honest you really think that wall always exists?
Do you wanna answer it anyway???
I’m in on tan as of last week got a 87.50 call for $470 with a 1/8/21 expiration need it to hit 92.50 I feel ok with the history
By end of 2021? I'd say 100%.
Nay, but let’s be real, we’re not holding GME for the console sales anyway.
I thought game stop is dead? the cheaper consoles don’t have disk drives like the ps5 so people will be going digital for games. idk about the xbone. it just seems like physical media will slowly rot away.
Sure, but as time passes and earnings are released, models have to be adapted.
GME can realistically have a 20% day tomorrow. There’s was a gap-down over a 2 years ago where GME dropped from 20 to 18.5 over night. Gaps tend to get filled quickly when the prices reaches it again. If GME pumps by 12.5% (at the peak on Friday it was at 13%) tomorrow, it will hit 18.5, and fill that gap up to 20. The hype around GME this weekend has exploded, and it will have many new buyers on Monday. It can easily hit this level. I’m going all in on calls tomorrow.
Great way to front run people and then post gains and look like a trading master.
I mean I don’t see deflation happening under Powell and Yellen. If gold hits 1500 again I’m loading up like Peter Schiff.
What really? My info says differently.

There will be people who will take profits. HOwever, there will be more buying than selling and that will prop the share price up.

Don't get me wrong but I feel like A LOT of people are underestimating just how much money will flow into TSLA and how much it will impact the rise in share price.

Nothing has changed in the FUNDAMENTALS. This is just sheer supply and demand play. When there is less supply and more demand of something, it gets more EXPENSIVE.

CyberPunk 2077 been hyper to max in the last few years and keep getting delay so I think it wouldn't meet the hyper. So I wouldn't invest in them but I still think that long-term invest can be good since they want to work on The Witcher 4 too but that's probably 5+ years from now. The price is already up before they release CyberPunk 2077 so I don't think it will go up much more.

I mean it’s to show that it’s possible. I didn’t jump on things because people said to. I did the research and got in things I believed in before they were big. I don’t follow what people say on here and don’t think anyone else should either. I follow for the gain/loss porn and Funny memes. This is over the course of the year. Which was really my first year. I realize it was a record year for the market and my gains are unsustainable. There are some huge down days in that chart as well. It wasn’t easy. But it did happen.

https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19

Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.

However, these measures can have a profound negative impact on individuals, communities, and societies by bringing social and economic life to a near stop. Such measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people in poverty, migrants, internally displaced people and refugees, who most often live in overcrowded and under resourced settings, and depend on daily labour for subsistence.
From Wikipedia:

In 2013, Burry reopened his hedge fund, this time called Scion Asset Management, filing reports as an exempt reporting adviser (ERA) who is active in the state of California and approved by the SEC.

Burry has focused much of his attention on investing in water,  gold, and farm land. Burry has been quoted saying "Fresh, clean water  cannot be taken for granted. And it is not—water is political, and  litigious."\[20\] At the end of the 2015 biographical dramedy film  The Big Short,  a statement regarding Burry's current interest reads, "The small  investing he still does is all focused on one commodity: water."

Imagine investing in water instead of Tesla.

It's actually a very controversial topic amongst FNMA/FNMAS investors, and it is a discussion that deserves a whole different post in itself. However, you can just think of it like this.

18->50 is just slightly less than a 200% increase which means commons would need to go from 2.7 to 8 to equal the investment. 

The Pfds are higher on totem pole, and there is no situation where the commons receive dividends and the Pfds are not worth par.

There are risks that the commons are exposed to that the Pfds are not such as

\-IPO dilution (they need to raise something like 280B  
\-High CRP's that will further push down their earnings potential

\-Warrants being executed

\-JPS conversions

&#x200B;

At the end of the day I don't think the opportunity differs too wildly, but i think there is about a 30-40% chance that the commons get fucked and super diluted. There is also a 20-30% chance it could be worth $15 or so per share, but I find that highly unlikely. The PFD's are good in any scenario that they are released, where as the commons still have some hurdles to jump over in that event.

I'm starting to see more GME posts and gains porn. Don't want to accuse anyone yet, but the timing is suspect.

Wait. So as long as the $TSLA share price continues to rise, so will the value of your call options, right? Can you extrapolate, for example, what your options will be worth if TSLA hits $1000 by Dec 2021?
not that it matters or anything but the weekend wow is up 50 points so like...bears r fuk just saying.

That half day friday shit is like your girl asking you if you want anal. 
Cock all hard you say "hell ya." She says "shush baby, let me put on something sexy." 
Comes back 5 mins later with a strap on. "You ready to party little bitch?" "Lick these motherfucking steel stilettos while I lube up this fat cock."
With tears in your eyes you whisper "I've waited so long for this" As she takes a long leather glove with barbed tits and scratches down your back as you lick, she purrs "meow..."  
What the fuck you think. Then slowly you begin to wake up, aware that you're in your mom's basement in a puddle of vomit with the stray cat you found eating chinese food in dumpster behind the bar scratching your back.

That's what half day trading feels like. Waking up from a beautiful dream to face your shitty reality.

BofA (deez nuts) is short as fuck GME and they're actually the autistic ones in this play.
On Friday everyone was like “citron being bearish means the reverse”

By Sunday everyone is convinced citron was right based on nothing.

This place has the memory of goldfish and everyone is incredibly impressionable! So if PLTR is green Monday expect everyone to be back on the hype train
Maybe they're up there polishing off a Sunday afternoon 8 Ball and walking around is literally better than sex.
I am on Monday. There’s a gap between 18.5 and 20 that hasn’t been filled in over a year. If GME goes up 12.5% tomorrow, it will hit 18.5 and immediately pump to 20. I’m getting 12/4 20c, only plan on holding them until Tuesday at the latest. But if I’m right that’ll be a 5-bagger play

PLTR is a company that serves intelligence services of the U.S. and NATO allies. The company was founded by the CIA and is instrumental in the Western Culture’s war efforts. 
PLTR centralizes data and information into a meaningful picture that provides actionable intelligence to the boots on the ground and eyes in the sky. This has been known as Project Gotham. More recently, PLTR has created an unclassified service, Project Foundry, which provides similar services to companies who rely on mass amounts of data and intelligence to drive operations, reach consumers, and streamline internal efficiencies. 
TL;DR - PLTR is a defense stock and the only public company to fulfill Top Secret and Secret data and software needs for NATO.

What percent of your total portfolio will 100 AMZN shares be in 2023? Less than 15%, go for it. That’s how I break down decisions on LEAPs. Do you plan on converting to shares if it’s ITM or are you just tying to give it more time to make you money...
Cause a bunch of people went out without a mask
Thanks friend!
Cool thanks! It's a relief to see that you're holding through earnings and you have so much at stake. I was planning on trying to get out of my micropenis sized 400 share position that I sold calls against but I might just keep selling calls until I get assigned.

If it shits the bed at earnings I'll be thinking of you 🤙
Yes, currently its my only strategy
So how exactly did you do this? Margin trading or buying/selling stocks or am I wrong on all fronts?
Its breaking out and your making a bear thesis?
Thanks man the community needs more heroes like you actually making logical arguments about why we should take the gamble. That being said see you on the fucking moon baby GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

So what are we expecting in terms of share price from this squeeze? I keep seeing people say GME is going up, but what exactly? It was only like 6 bucks in september and now it's 16. 30 dollars? 50 dollars?
Both.  But GME seems like a sure thing at least until earnings. Short squeeze might take a bit longer and you need ride the wave.
Who is bearish?

It just made sense. I started  in may/June asking What is in a COVID safe growing market? How about gaming? Well GameStop is old but look at the price. Oh and the console season is coming up? Look at the price of Gme during the last two console releases. They got a new ceo and vowed to cut costs and grow the company. Well they should at least have a pop from the consoles so buy some shares and buy nov/ Jan otm options. 25000 shares were from exercising options. I normally wouldn’t do that especially when they were 2000%but when Ryan Cohen got in it gave me a solid reason to believe there’s a bigger leg up porrisble if he takes over.
fuck I can feel it
He’s a retard
I went all in on TSLA on Sept 1st and went bankrupt in 1 day
S&P trying to keep your tendies, build a giant boat like the one in movie 2012, and runway with their friends while you face the flood (again, like in movie 2012).
this is a joke post right
yeah they have sells in place, but its also thier decision to report anything. i dont doubt they will go up, but they are without a doubt the shadiest at it and its left alot of newbs not privy to thier shit before hand left bag holding on both sides.

 seen it too many times
It’s been on my watchlist since they launched it but it’s never seemed like the price action is enough for options to be worth it. Guess I’ll give it a shot this week

Just something to consider after this huge bull run.
Seeking alpha said GameStop short squeeze is over 4 days ago
you should be fine by friday
Why the fuck are my TA discussions being removed on a weekend thread, is some bitch reporting them or is the automod broken?

Im seeing people post about irrelevant bullshit, so what gives?

Realistically a lot of people aren't gonna make it, realizing this and taking profits and waiting the market out over the coming few months is the optimal strategy when you realize a lot of stuff is gonna suffer a 20% drop from mid-december to the end of the year. Paper hands are reliable in that they will fold.
I envy you sir, I wish I owned close to that. I will beep buying calls and throwing the profits into shares though while watching my cost average rise
12/4 $630c x3. Poor man version of what you have
Baba calls solid. And may even get a nice dip in the morning with the stupid sec news
Glad there's company down here.
Classy is for r/investing. I stay earning.

Good point, too. Although if it should slump, then the funds will have to buy more to weight it. Which is also interesting.
Well, it's been trading sideways for months. It's time.

Holy shit!! This is it! What an analysis🤯
Are we assuming the shares we’re buying on the public market right now are from initial investors selling part of their stake or was there some portion of the 200M allocated for the public? This is actually a general question on spacs that I haven’t been able to find the answer for.

wow. If PSTH dips to $24 I’m adding more shares
I need to take my own advice, but you should give your plays time to mature and do whatever you think it will do. Im terrible at that. But it is soo frustrating to have a great idea, get a fill on a contract amd then for some reason sell an option you planned on holding for months after a few days
[removed]
Honestly don't worry about the squeeze prospect. You're buying a company that plays in a booming market (gaming) that has an e-commerce arm generating ~$1.5B annual revenue and the entire company trades at ~$1B market cap. Just the e-commerce business alone is worth a double. 

Feel free to read the fuckton of DD I've posted elsewhere if interested in learning more.

Or STFU and buy the stock with your monkey brain. Don't throw shit at me if it goes down after ER, you must diamond hand this.

Let's say you buy 1 call so 100 shares, can you sell off partial (2-20) shares instead of the whole contract? 

Never have bought calls and am confused if you just sell them like a normal share?
So to be stumbling into someone else's lambo as you will be a penniless bum drunkenly yelling at passing cars downtown.

Yup. If PLTR has a massive rise on Mon, I'm selling 70pcnt of my PLTR shares for GME
this is the greatest fucking post this sub has ever seen
So almost $88 billion in cold hard cash is going to be thrown at TESLA stocks, but they are buying in for S&P inclusion after a monster run up. Obviously they will be buying high. Is there any way MMs and fund managers can DROP the price so that they will be buying in low? Basically, everyone is expecting the stock to skyrocket given the liquidity. Is there a (bizarro) world where they will be able to manipulate price DOWN to avoid paying a premium and also avoid getting assigned on all the outstanding bull calls?
As a lifelong New Yorker everywhere else just seems small to me.
Yes but once we're out of the market and the streets are red with blood it provides a great time to get some new positions for the rebound.
Employer restrictions?
trailing....stop loss...percentage. .
How do you "know" it's not going anywhere?  Just because CNN isn't covering it, and Facebook and Twitter forbid evidence of fraud on their sites, doesn't equate to meritless.  It's not over until SCOTUS says it's over.  I believe Al Gore thought he was President for 37 days before SCOTUS disabused him of this notion.

All in on Tesla in February 2020. I was down in May 2019. Wish I went all in then at $35.6, as Warran Buffet says, be greedy when others are fearful. (This sub probably does the exact opposite) Hung in until October 2019 doubled my position, then yolod in, in February. Nearly chickend out in March. Now feel like a genius.....🤔.

This wasn't a frivolous bet. (Still a bit gung-ho) I consume on average 0.5-1 hour of Tesla content per day. I had insomnia for a while and used to listen to the audio book of Elon Musk's biography over and over because I got used to the cadence of the narrator's voice.

Dude what? Approval means sales, sales mean revenue. They are very effective, it’s a 95% rate. Have you even seen the studies and read them? I also work for a private equity firm that specializes in conducting health trials, and Pfizer just put in a new change order last week to add a few extra million dollars for their study. So something is going very well for them. Like I said, many retailers have already said they won’t have a problem storing it in the desired temperate. If you think FDA approvals are questionable based on loose studies, then I hope you aren’t in any pharma position right now since they are all waiting on fda approval. Plus, UK ordered a fat dose of the vaccine today. News came out. Coke back here tomrrow when you read it here first that PFE will hit 38.5-39 tomorrow and 40 by the end of 12/18

AAPL looks like its heading for a BREAKOUT. 

We've seen a high of 138 and a low of 104. Triangles are always so hard to predict. Movement before the pattern was very bullish so I would assume to resume that trend. Who knows if something fundamental has changed though.
r/investing
Boomer stocks ain't gonna do much for that situation
Maybe you should probably still cash out 50%. Buy a house or something and then YOLO the rest
I hope people lose money on GameStop, then the company will die and we get to say I told you so. If they make money from GameStop then WSB can pump PLTR with gains. It's a win win situation for me, and I don't need to have any positions in GME. Would you really stay long in GME after it's $50 a share?
I fucking wish it was Monday. I live for Mondays, Karen.

actually its not unpopular. Lots of idiots are saying this. They have done zero DD but happy to give their 2cent opinion on something they dont know anything about.

DO. IT.
When you throw these share price predications around do you consider the Market caps? As it stands Nios market cap is 80 billion, at a 80 dollar share price that would put it at market cap about 120-130 billion. That’s a higher market cap than Ford and Honda combined. Let me tell you something, the party will end much sooner than that. Don’t look at the share price, look at the market cap.
This isn’t in Trump’s hands. Thankfully we have a constitution and legislature that will not permit someone to occupy the White House without being duly elected. Also, Trump has said in 3 different post election press conferences that he will leave the White House if the electorate votes Biden in Jan. I have more faith in our country than I do one man.

Sir, I've never shorted anything in my life. I don't even wear shorts, out of principle.
My monkey brain is trying to learn some knowledge here. I get the basics of what you’re saying. Do you have any good videos explaining the VW short squeeze? To the best of my little understanding the squeeze happens because a company is forced to buying back shares.
MAYBE but the georgia run-off was never viewed as anything other than a long-shot for dems getting both seats. Not sure what the odds are now but I don't think the market was counting on that scenario playing out.
What if you lying on the floor?
Same and I sold it by April lol
No way man. The is bullish! Someone tell her to go speak to the manager at Citron.

For a 10$ a shot you could probably get the entirety of africa to take that vaccine. Then you have data to see what happens. And people in africa have food for a month.
Right? Too much love for a rehash
If you believe a squeeze is going to happen why bother with options? The premium is so high you barely benefit. If you can't be thrilled at a 10x stock gain I can't help you.

Another yolo? Try and stop me
Just sell SPY 280P for Jan 15
I suggest you buy at open then set a trailing stop loss % you're comfortable with but GME tends to moon then drop then gradually coast back upwards throughout the day lately. It's a long-term hold (for this community). Don't worry about what you make tomorrow or lose, worry about what you could definitely NOT make in a month or two if you paper hands it.
Fuck it. Take out a home equity loan and YOLO. Your kids solo be eating the finest tendies Christmas Eve and wake up to ps5’s.

I sold a 27p for 12/4.  Retards together. 👊🏻
Woah! About 2 more weeks then we can play CyberPunk 2077!!
Dont know what GME is, bot in my vocab. only PLTR shall be bought
Wondering what I should throw 15k at. Only buying shares. 

Holding 100 shares BABA, 100 AAPL, 1000 PLTR, 1500 THICC BOY, 500 ICLN and got around 20k in VTI. 

Play should be to hold at least for one month due to employer restrictions. Like, something I literally won’t be able to sell for a month. 

Can’t be AMD, MAXR, NET, MSFT (These are positions I have closed and I’m under restriction not to buy for a month)
They are more like Best Buy than Blockbuster. The Blockbuster comparison is lazy and wrong. Years ago, people though Amazon would kill Best Buy... but they didn't.
why is DBX so limp
And yours??
That’s what my understanding was but I just wanted to check. 

If I want to contribute > buy shares 
If I want to profit > buy options
I got lucky with calls at 25 and 30 on the run up. Currently holding another 30 and a 40 expiring the end of the month. I missed out closing the 30 on Friday at its high because I wanted to see how the increasing share price would effect the sale price of the option. Bassicly I was being greedy and was hoping it would keep going up.

Live and learn I guess. I’m pretty optimistic the 30c will print before it expires. The 40 I admit I am less optimistic about but Atleast I have some time to let it play out. I will probably switch to leaps soon and I plan to hold the shares I have for a couple years and see what happens. It probably will not turn into amazon but with a cost average below 20 a share I figure it’s a safe long term bet. Maybe I get lucky and it doubles every year or two for the next couple decades.
NVAX, JPM, PLTR, AMZN, AEM (don’t do it, bad gold bet), PTON, LLY. Straight shares but going to get some PLTR and PSTH calls after spending all damn weekend on this stupid sub lol

Any of y’all lives in Wisconsin? Why the fuck there’s so much cheese here
I mean I buy long calls but fear no one is willing to buy them back when I choose to sell them in the middle of a short squeeze
Are you making more than if you just bought shares and held? Seems like a lot of extra work for not that much of a reward.. what do I know?
In for 2345 shares. I have nothing left to give.

"Due diligence is the investigation or exercise of care that a reasonable business or person is normally expected to take before entering into an agreement or contract with another party or an act with a certain standard of care. It can be a legal obligation, but the term will more commonly apply to voluntary."
 I researched federal student loans and am confident in a bail out there for I'm entering into a contract to take out a loan. unless I'm missing something how is this not DD or does the flair mean something different genuine question.

Just found out tencent is the 2nd largest share holder of NIO, for those whom don’t know, you can bet against BABA but never bet against tencent, tencent is equivalent of if FB owns snap EA blizzard twitch uber booking.com, PayPal, ebay, doordash, yelp, Airbnb, Zillow, etc. Yes they have some competition (payment and e-commerce from BABA though WeChat pay and PDD is becoming toe to toe with Alibaba and Alipay) but they always dominate or came up as winner in all other fields when their backed company going against BABA backed. And their CEO actually knows to stay low and work with the government. Adding in more NIO LEAPS.

Idk. Dont care. Some short squeeze shit wnd new manager. More importantly, buy PLTR
If and when the squeeze happens, 90% of retards will hold it till it tanks back to $10
This needs to be upvoted as the $38k I have invested so far, I always had to manually make sure it was a cash trade. IDK why fidelity tries to hide that you're buying on margin until you open 'more trade option' and change it to cash (jk i'm sure they know exactly what they're doing).
I cashed out Friday morning before the dip. And will be watching PLTR again tomorrow.
I would like to do something like this at some point
You should try to practice sticking to your original ideas until they dont work out. But something i have been thinking about is habing an exit strategy, so u have a plan and dont panic sell first sign of profit/loss
I’d start by googling “series 24 exam” and picking literally any of the top search results for a study plan

If you want to make money, all you have to do is NOT SELL pltr.
It is always possible. If you own the shares. If you own 1000 shares you could sell weekly calls $1-3 out of the money and make a few percent weekly. But only do this on half your shares in case the squeeze happens. 

Current price is almost $16.5. Buy 1000 shares. Sell some calls. If the squeeze happens this week you'll lose those shares. If it doesn't you pocket some money while we wait for the squeeze. And on the chance the squeeze never happens you are lowering your cost basis by selling the calls. 

Sure, you are lowering your potential upside, but it's only potential anyway.

Totally wrong. Never head of any rules here. MODS ban that guy.
position for earnings play?
That's a lot of money to me so I would be nervous. If that's more than 10% I'd be concerned.

115 is ITM so your probably chilling.

Looking at AAPL it looks like its setting up for another rally or a huge correction. I haven't heard the best of news.

Idk, I would probably rather hold shares considering you can buy so many.


Question for you, do you think they will get a holiday catalyst of some sort to send this up?

Those 15 shares probably can turn into a Tesla car down the road. But it's ok. at least you learned the lesson.

One big lesson I learned is that everyone should max out IRA and 401k accounts in early years. As you get better at investment and trading, your account will turn very large. Tax or no tax can make a huge difference in the long run.
Yep, not much downside is this play. Plus, bill ackman with the backing of 4 billion dollars makes me quite confident that something good will happen with this SPAC

Fair point. Given both are based on spike protein, so it might be possible for both to be susceptible to the mutations.

But tell me why you think MRNA is more superior overall? Even their CMO said dose tolerance and side effects could be an issue, along with the likely outcome that their vaccine will only provide immune response to protect against the symptoms of illness, but does not fully prevent viral replication and spread. NVAX P1 studies showed theirs does stop the viral replication, therefore providing herd immunity.

NVAX is as much of a gamble as MRNA was during the trial phase. It's not like we are talking about SRNE, INO, or some other vaccine pump and dumps. Surely Bill Gates/CEPI/DoD are not fools for provide in $2B in funding months ago if the vaccine wasn't sound, as did other big buyers like Cohen.

Also, as a bonus, by doing this, we can see if people here make a hell of a lot of money, or if every winner has a loser. We can also gauge which investment class people trend to--I'd expect more investments in stocks than the options people so like to promote.

- Used for TV and PC, with TV as the source / amp (I know)
- Reasonable impedance, I'm not buying a $200 amp as well, will use TV as mentioned.
So you think in 10 years time Tesla will more than justify what the current share price is pointing to, that they'll be bigger than the next 7 largest car companies currently are today, combined...? It can't just be THAT big though, it has to be bigger, for you to profit more than you would if you just cashed out now... I think this is peak Tesla. It was over-valued at $600... Before the split!!!
Buy more.
 How about now that you got fucking lucky by being a degenerate and doing the opposite of what you should have, you cash out and actually learn how to trade, rather than just get lucky. What if Iran nukes DC tomorrow because they killed their guy, and the half market it it opens in 3 weeks at -50% sending your positions down even more. Black swan shit can and does happen. You made a shit ton. Just take the money and diversify, then be ready for the next bubble.

GME has a lot more potential, PLTR had a great run and possibly still has some gas - but it's not the second coming of TSLA that many wish it was. GME has so much more space for growth and I think that with a little luck and good news, GME will at least double in regards to shares price.

Like you I have no kids but am married.  At 600K I took 250k out and bought 2 houses.  One to live in and another to rent out. Both with mortgages but the rental covered its own expenses + property taxes.   The 600K was in the dotcom boom and then bust.  I made money on the ups and learned to short on the downs

I then took a hit on the remainder of about 150k (this was circa time of the telco boom/bust cycle in 03-05) and parked my investments + yolo to take time out to re-assess.   The hit was because I got overconfident on one single transaction where I thought I had an edge and got outmaneuvered by someone smarted who cornered a derivative that I was short

I then doubled what remained on another boom/bust cycle just before the 08-09 meltdown so got back to about 700k.  

When 08-09 happened I was mainly neutral to short and got to 1m.  Back then that was a lot of money and what I had always envisioned as my bag of FU money.  I sat tight for a year then bought a bunch of boomer dividend stocks.  Just to give you an idea MSFT was considered a boomer dividend stock back then at 33.

Ever since then I've been doing what is now calling theta gang but it didn't have a name back then.  This was pre-Reddit.  I owned dividend stocks and sold covered calls on them and cash secured puts to leg into more.  That returns a healthy 15+ % pa which to me was fine because FU money.

I keep a Yolo account of 2% of my port just to stay in practice and because gambling.  It's for stocks, options, FX, exotics etc  When it gets to 5% I take money out.  If it blows up then I consider myself done for the year.   Since 09 I've blown up the yolo account 2x but for the most part done well with the 2% of port pulling much more than its fair share.  But i like to sleep well so this strategy gives me all the excitement I need.

However this year is special.  i've not seen anything with this much volatility since the dotcom cycle.  There's so many opportunities. 
 Don't think the field will be as fertile when things revert to mean so I support your plan to take advantage while its there. 

However keep in mind WSB has survivorship bias.  Of every 100 autists who post, maybe 1, 2? will win big like you.  Maybe another 8 will win smaller but will still win.  Maybe 20 will win small or draw.  And the remainder will flame out.  For the most part trading is a zero sum game.  Your big win means many many small losses.  So all I can say is maintain extreme paranoia.  And if, like me, you detect gambling tendencies in yourself then take steps to keep yourself honest.  I speak as someone who saw the bodies of many of my colleagues who blew up bigger accounts

It’s wasnt the easiest. But as cliche as it sounds “ knowing what you hold” I believed in Gme to rebound before this earnings so it wasn’t crushing. Plus a few weeks earlier I had a plus 275 k day. Yes would of been great to get out before and then back in. But Thats much harder to do than just hold. I definitely had my eye on the market every minute at that point though because at some point you have to pull the trigger.

When it comes to risk, "high risk" is a standard deviation of annual returns of 20% or more. With the amount of turnover most options trading has, I'd anticipate standard deviations of much more than 100% for regular options trading, and 40% or meme equity trading (see Nikola, Palantir, Kodak, etc.).

APHA and SOL
IV and relative risk (and absolute reward) is great on the near term expiries, but the risk of a dip before expiration is also high. April gives exposure to any share recall driven short squeeze for a proxy fight with RC Ventures in the Spring.
Keep in mind that most of the investing world has written GME off as 'the next Blockbuster'. WSB is a whole different beast in that people are this bullish (and obviously have higher risk tolerance than the investing world) so all these factors combined make this an intriguing trade. When others are fearful be greedy applies very well in this case.
gme unpopular opinion is going the way of blockbuster. Everyone buys digital copies or orders online

Yes but more difficult if you’re trying to sell on a large drop from the peak as the bid/ask will balloon. Basically don’t be too greedy.
I almost have 2500 shares and have bought all of them at market open. What happens happens just keep holding for more than a damn day this is a multi-week venture. Paper hands will screw you over. Set a trailing stop loss % if you're feeling like you can't handle the idea of a 5% dip one day.

He said “chairs are under appreciated” right before a huge earnings beat too. Shares are under appreciated.
Why do something like this?

In MPT. there is an idea that greater risk results in greater reward. This concept comes from the fact that people are willing to offload their risk onto other people at a premium--just like insurance. Noting that the people on this sub seem to trend towards taking on insane risk profiles, does this result in insane gains, or is it just a wash?

I am leaning toward thinking you just misread the comment accidentally. To reiterate, the warrant kicks in 30 days post-\*MERGER\*. There is going to be an announcement first, which, leads to a bump. Then, \*traditionally\*  sell. With PSTH, if you go into the merger without shares, you don't get warrants. In sum, all I am saying is that there is a lot arguing against a dump (or really any volatility leading up to the merger here). Once the announcement is made, may who were watching but had no stomach (THE NON-EVIDENCE-BASED NAY SAYERS ON THIS THREAD) will likely BUY stock and capture the free warrants. Ergo, that is to say, it's conceivable that this stock will continue to climb, even after the announcement (whatever it is) because of the warrant structure. Really, in sum: THAT'S THE GAME FOLKS. ACKMAN HAS MADE A STONK WHERE THE STRUCTURE IS THE NEWS. ONCE THIS IS ANNOUNCED (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ITS STRIPE), THE WARRANT SCHEME **IS THE NEWS & WHAT DO MARKETS REACT TO (THE NEWS).**

i actually think this would be a great play for the company long-term, along with licensing auto-driving software to the other car companies (ie carplay). Sort of a pickaxes play.

I think the next decade or so the commodification of EV cars is going to erode TSLA's margins on actual cars, which have been slipping lately (at least if you trust consumer reports) anyways.

Jeffries sees 50-100% upside for callaway golf ($ELY).  The Jeffries report set a $30 PT, which is 50% upside at current price levels, and cited data from Dick's Sporting Goods that indicated big growth in sales in the golf sector due to a renaissance in the sport and due to a big push for outdoor activities due to the pandemic.  $ELY also recently acquired Top Golf, which is apparently quite popular during the pandemic. Localities have apparently been fighting to get new Top Golf locations since it is a cash cow.

Sorry if I’m bothering you with noob questions. Even though the price per share on later contracts is more? In other posts people have mentioned that GME could see a dip in mid December. So my thinking would be to get in if that does happen?

Because they benefit no more from FDA approval than from vaccine study proving effectiveness. Effectiveness  implies approval. So the news you are counting on is already priced in just like the vaccine study results were, except they weren't, because of the two (study results vs. FDA approval) the study is more questionable than the FDA approval.  You have the logic precisely backwards.

The real question is what the short breaking point is. They’ve already held through the previous ATH in the 15s. By now they’ve probably at least leveraged the positions with calls. Luckily the covering will still cause a rocket, moreso on a catalyst.

Fuck it I’ve never invested before and have no idea how this works but I’ll be only putting in $200 to start Monday
options dont have the same effect as holding shares. if all of wsb buys calls that will still help but if all of wsb buys shares, say every 1m subscribers buy 10 shares and refuse to sell them, that will push the squeeze that much higher when shorts go to cover and there arent shares available
Yes because no other car companies have a battery factory that is comparable to TSLA. They would have to rollback a huge part of their budget in order to start constructing factories, which also requires a lot of time, versus TSLA starting from the get go.
The squeeze is one potential positive catalyst. There are many more which is why I’m in so deep. The risk/reward is there. Pros outweigh cons. Maybe not right away because earnings could cause a rough pull back. But the outlook on the future is high. Do your research
Black Friday and cyber Monday suck dick these days.

but chinese ev companies aren't going to use elon's products, they're going to use another chinese companie's products. and nio is partnered with CATL for their BaaS which will allow them to make the batteries for less, repurpose the old batteries, and recycle the lithium, cobalt, nickel, etc. to make new batteries. CATL provides battery cells to Tesla as well.

Idk man their new m1 chip and their arm > x86 virtualization stuff is good shit
that’s the point, it’s a meme portfolio but with some merit behind it. the White Girl as a group seem to get behind many companies, pushing them to perform well. this is a way to track that demographic as a consumer base. just for fun and maybe some insight.
I bought some super cheap weed penny stock $1 calls because I didn't like having $10 in my account.

They're printing.
If Tesla didn't decide to compete against all of them, it would have been a good idea to license their battery tech. Something tells me that it is more of Panasonic's battery tech than Tesla's.
I’ll probably only buy a few options but I wanna help pump GME so I’ll buy shares since that’s what contributes to short squeezes according to other retards

I mean that's why apparently this law applies for relationships were you've lived with them longer than a year.
I wouldn't move in with someone untill dating them for 6+ months, and even then I'd have a year to figure if the person I'm with is a sloth.

Don't date lazy bitches unless you wanna pay for lazy bitches.

I agree with you. I still think there will be business-meeting in persons but just not as much.  [Bill Gates said the same](https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-travel-for-work-never-the-same-after-coronavirus-2020-4?r=US&IR=T)

You've single-handedly kept GameStop in business. Any rhyme or reason to buying so much of it?
You heard it here first guys, follow the herd blindly, chase the bubble
[removed]
Back then there were a few people here posting screenshots of SPY $280 calls for like June/July and they were practically laughed out of the sub. 

In fairness I think people have already forgotten what the overall mood was like in March. There were people who legitimately thought 3-6% of people who caught covid died. China wasn't releasing info. Italy was in complete lockdown. The world was ready for a culling like 1918.
Mmmmmmmmm 8 figures. Gunna hit me hard after taxes and probably buying a house in the spring depending on market. But I will always be a degenerate going for the ultimate goal
I don't know about that we have had a couple folks buy in $1M in shares last week.
Lol 320s! That would be a huge drop.
[removed]
But but all those Instagram training videos!
This week, in several 600/605 spreads
I bought at 27 for this Friday, are any calls above 35 lotto or realistic?
Agree - also I’m not trying to pay taxes 😂 my earliest sell is may of 2021 to avoid them capital gains baby
In shares and in weeklies bb
That was a v v thoughtful reply brother. Seriously.
I had May 2021 $15 calls that I closed for a tiny profit a few weeks ago. 
Currently long March 19 $25 calls.
Only getting more people here too
Buy lots of shares and hold and make calls
The year is 2030, a movie is made called “the big squeeze” starring Ryan Gosling, Danny Devito, and the Bogdanov twins as they, along with the WSB forum famously taken down by the SEC in 2025, figure out how to exploit a short squeeze in GameStop stock. This is to the backdrop of thousands of stockbrokers and hedge fund managers suffering because of their massive short positions that were touted as “risk less” and “to good to fail” and “cannot go tits up”.
You're retarded. Shares.
Y’all see any good deals for CyberMonday?
Where can I buy a self driving tesla?

Sir you are missing out how big my balls are stacking puts on puts on puts for months with more puts then ever before.

Trying to stay well diversified over here
DRIV
Lmao get out me swap if you don't wanna go to tendie town with me ;)
I wouldn’t be surprised at that either. That’s why I want to probably convert the money tied up in calls into shares either Friday/next Monday, much safer imo
You probably bought my calls
Let’s see Jake go against a real boxer like Canelo. He won’t stand a chance

strange how i was right for other stocks before too. and you took one part of my thesis, the ceo's vision and twist it to the ceo saying it's dope rather than an analysis of their roadmap and growth potential is rather silly. so many jealous people who can't do proper DD because they don't have the engineering background to understand the products or understand the IP that wants to believe everyone is just as clueless as them lol
No institution holds a short until bankruptcy bro they usually cover below 5 because it’s too easy for idiots like you and this sub to cause squeezes below that level
Thx bruh!
I’m not optimistic. Dumb American bitch idiots are really starting to believe the xenophobic anti-China narratives, paper hands come out for every single slightly negative headline
At their current valuation it will take you decades to see any rate of actual return if you bought in now.

Tesla can start from scratch but all the automotive companies can put out better cars in larger numbers and are just now starting to actually make EV cars trucks and SUVs. They are able to produce them at a better rate with more serviceability with no waiting lines to get one. 

Tesla is rated second to dead last on quality and had to go back to what the major car manufacturers were doing when it came to automation in their manufacturing processes because Tesla had its head up its ass on its first factory.

In total numbers they are still a longs way off at being near Ford, GM or Toyota but their valuation being greater than all the current top car brands is fucking delusional even if it isn't a car company.

Tesla ? Who’s on the train to $600 😎
Saw a guy run $500 to 50K at a crap table in Vegas.  I could tell he was walking with $100K or zero.  You can guess which one he did.

Edit:  Watching that guy throw dice was a thing of beauty. He literally threw the dice around the condos (towers of chips stacked on the hard ways) in the center of the table but landing them about 3/4 of the way down on the rail and then "riding the table curve" around until just about the time the dice were coming back they would stop.  Every fucking time.  Even the casino guys were looking at each other like WTF?
Agreed. After taxes I dont even think of my gains as much. It’s a good start but it doesn’t allow me to quit my job yet and that’s what I’m here for. It’s the goal. Hate my job.

some airlines dont offer wifi access until you are high up in the air cruising at a steady altitude so you might not get full access during comeup or landing
Nope. I get a lot more likes from men but I don't swipe on them.

The extra likes boosts my profile score so Tinder pushes my profile to more women.
Based on the general attitude of buyers. Funds aren’t selling shares of this they are buying, retail investors are not selling they are buying, Yeah there was a pullback on Friday after the citron hit price and after going up over 70 percent (at its high) in a week even with the dip it ended the week up over 59 percent and after hours it rebound 2 percent. 

Do I know where it will end on Friday? Of course not but I fucking guarantee at some point in the next couple weeks (before this dude’s call expires) it retouches that 32 dollar high. I would bet (and will buy calls Monday) that it passes 30 by end of week and 35 by the end of the month.

Unless this crashes significantly I’m talking like down 30 percent then people are just going to come in and buy up the discounted shares. The FOMO surrounding this is huge just look at the front page, or the options sub or the investing sub or any trading discord you can find. Too many people are too bullish on this for it to not go up. 

Personally I am going to keep buying calls until the end of the December and rolling the profits into shares. Yeah I will probably eventually get fucked and lose a couple  but at that point hopefully I have enough shares that in the long run whatever I lose in the options will barely register in the big picture.

But what the fuck do I know? You probably shouldn’t listen to me. But if you are at the point that you need to come here asking random strangers for advice well you are probably fucked anyway.
I’ve literally have heard the exact opposite technical analysis from MANY people that specialize in this.... so more than likely your wrong and retarded.

Look up SIPC insurance limits. The easiest way is to add a joint owner, this doubles your coverage. If your account is under an IRA, then adding more beneficiaries will also increase your coverage. The cap is per broker, so you could always open a secondary account with a different broker to park or trade excess money.

When you so rich, less then 1% dividend pays almost 1 billion.
there is only one way... you must seek out a man named Elon Musk... ask him for strike and expiry... tell him WSB sent you...
Just get shares instead. Easily we see an initial dip on people who dump because of the EPS, and then a rally because of the content of the conference call and guidance. But that rally may take several days; killing your calls. Just buy shares just in case.
Not only do you have to pay taxes, you have to pay quarterly taxes. So you've already missed 3 payments this year and will be charged a pretty hefty % fee for late payment.

Options liquidity is extremely scarce after hours, and must be placed by limit order and match up with another (contra) order. You are probably not getting another matching order, so your order expires. Try buying during market hours.

Boys. Can we not forget about NIO, my calls need it
I made the same argument yesterday that the Citron tweet wasn’t even an argument against the company, just the current valuation. Palantir has proprietary software they’ve worked hard on for a long time, they’ll accumulate tons of corporate clients before anyone else can compete. All Citron said was there will be a pullback prior to year end. People buggin.

I did few weeks ago. Then vaccine news came out and tech crashed so I bought the dip. Now I just buy spy weekly puts as a hedge waiting for the imminent crash.
Price whatever it is at open tomorrow
I wouldn't say the only example of why it won't be Stripe is a troll on Twitter... In an interview a couple of months ago., he himself added "employee-owned and family-controlled businesses" to his list of potential targets. That definitely doesn't sound like Stripe.

Surely WSB can combine to become at least 5% of float. This is excellent DD by the way
Yeah they trade NYSE stock too.
Ryan Cohen announce as ceo or a big part of the company moving forward would make this price 25 easy. As you see there’s hostility between him and the board. I don’t understand why the big funds didn’t get out of the short and yes anything’s possible. The catalysts and future are too much. I’ll probably hedge some for earnings but will also buy the bottom of the dip. Worst case scenario there’s a crash and Ryan Cohen gets out. But I do t think he will. As long as he holds 10% I’m comfortable having a sizable position in the future of the company
It's coming. GME is the best in the world at what it does.

How would you turn 10k into 100k by March?
This is the way
Interesting choice, think they could survive.
Citron didn’t even have anything negative to say about the company just that the price is higher than they think it should be.  Whatever that means. They need a video of a truck that is pushed down a hill to have a leg to stand on and the more people dig into pltr the more legitimate it seems.  I’m not advocating for pltr, just against citron.
Personally, I would look at April and longer-dated calls to get the best risk/reward tradeoff if adding.
Also wanted to know, I like me some gore, makes me think of all the things I could do to my wife’s boyfriend...
Wish I would have sold then or atleast half

they are the largest by revenue and assets
I know, I wish I loaded up more on Wednesday. Won’t be surprised if there are a few nice buying opportunities coming up. Very interested to see how this holds up next week.

SPY, BRK.B, COST... buy and hold, don't invest with borrowed money. 

Don't worry about temporary down turns. Just hold. Over time you will either have dividend or capital appreciation.  Then you can treat that gain as house money. Then use the house money to learn trading skills. 

One point is very important, if you invest in safe companies or index, you can add more when there is a big pullback. If you invest in random/unsafe companies, you may have to cut loss when bad news come. Try to avoid unsafe companies.

What does tesla do outside of cars? All I can see is some solar panels that they are having a hard time selling because their service is so bad. Also the vast majority of their current revenue is from cars. The rest is ev credits which is also cars lol

I think the people that think tesla is more than a car company are also the ones that invested in Theranos.
Interesting choice. You think proctor and gamble will survive and thrive another 100 years?
No taxes if you lose it all. You still have 1 month to lose your gains in the market

This is the answer, minus the 3rd paragraph, for everyone who doesn't know how to use Google.  Unlike databases (Oracle example) that potentially store more and more data, deployable assets need no such retention and can be cycled off, thereby limiting capacity needed, and managing costs.

Exactly. APHA is always the play.
My ideal future goal is 100 shares of Amazon. The OTM weeklies with a 80% chance of expiring worthless  are over $1k. 

Or you could even play it super safe and go with the $800 weeklies with even less chance of expiring itm. 

And if it does expire in the money, you just sell cash covered puts or move into another position to sell CCs on. 

I have a very small portfolio but I've dipped my toes in CCs and it felt so smart. 

If you had 300 shares AMZN ($1million) you could sell like 12k a month in covered calls with a high chance if expiring otm.
They’re spearheading the transition to clean energy, starting with transportation. And then you have batteries, which is storage. And then solar, which is energy generation. So yeah... not many companies are multifaceted in energy like Tesla has been for the past decade. And they made it cool.
So wise

GameStop’s pull back. Easy hold knowing what was coming though. Actually bought some more calls when it did but didn’t buy the bottom or enough. But I’ve been in long enough to me comfortable to hold. Next earnings might be different. But you won’t have big gainer days without some big loss days too. Makes you a better trader
How would the one or two day buy period affect price?
I would be but I cashed at 33

I’ve never done options trading but realistically if I yolo (sell my 61 apex shares and clear my savings) I could get a few thousand shares. $20C 12/18 sound good for 30 contracts?
Orchestrating a short squeeze is illegal, which the majority of GME posts right now are attempting to do in one way or another. Mods are helping us out by leaving them up long enough for a few people to see and spread word, yet not long enough for Reddit or the SEC to have reason to bring the hammer down on us.

There is a lot of good advice in here if you dig between the memes and pumpers - I bought planters at IPO - I jumped in late but still made good money off CRSR and I’ll buy back in soon because its a great company and I’ve used their shit in every computer I’ve ever built.

This is the way.  There is a tidal shift going on right now, and you are a perfect example of the mindset that is flooding into the markets.  The younger generation has zero incentive to save, and every incentive to chase gains. 

A combination of low interest rates, limited job prospects, and sharply rising cost of equity incentivizes the YOLO mindset.  Why work your life away chasing a mortgage you’ll never be able to afford when you can strike it rich in one fell swoop.

The structural underpinnings of the economy that have led to this are going to, at least in the near term, continue to accelerate.  Expect to see rising cost of equity, both in stocks and property.

The long term implications are scary, expect to see a sharpening of the wealth divide.  As long as there is continued buy in it’ll continue, and I don’t see any indications that the trend will slow anytime soon.  Where else is capital going to go?  Savings won’t keep pace with inflation, neither will bonds with the current state of interest.

And boomer analysts are losing their minds trying to figure it out.  It goes against all conventional wisdom.  The thing is, conventional wisdom is rooted in an assumption that the status quo will continue.  It all falls apart when a new paradigm emerges.
I’m sure you know tons of gay bears

Are there any bulls considering easing out of their positions and going cash or bear? The masses are all bullish, bears are dead, short interest is kill and retail buying has gone euphoric.
Honestly it was so long ago. But the whole thing was I got in early. When it was still DEAC. They changed there name in April or may?  So June calls maybe?Whatever it was I picked calls surrounding thetable after name change. Price was like 10-11. When I bought. Calls were OTM for like 14-16 dollars. Cashed out when it hit like 25. It seemed like a free bet. Because the name change in my head would have at least some type of small pop.
Holy shit, this is WSB if you are to stupid to figure this out on your own you are retarded, not autistic. And you should be banned for trying to spoonfeed the retards

does it have a moat such as infrastructure or IP? is there a growing cult fanbase specifically for their brand? if not then probably sell since they can be replaced at any time. if you're holding you better have a good thesis on how they won't be replaced and how they will expand their market size or grow revenue even if the market doesn't expand

You specify post-announcement. Isn't that a different time frame than post-merger? My understanding is that after a merger these shares in PSTH will convert into shares in, hypothetically, STRP. Is that wrong?

Either way, fuck the teenagers who are questioning this. It's super solid DD and you're doing anyone here with enough capital a potentially life-changing favor (provided you're right, lol).

Apple in no longer an innovative company, but i agree they do have a loyal following and strong branding. I forsee that their growth will be less in the r and d innovative aspect and more on the expansive front, operating in new countries ect. Right now there is less speculation on potential tech/how far can this go and more on how they can improve their supply chain/bottom line/optimization. 

That being said its a good safe company to invest in i wouldnt say they would get tesla type growth anytime quick

I agree partially - they still have a lot of cash and they have a shit ton of advance bookings - the market is still there and if you plan on holding long term then it’s a great opportunity to make money 4-5 years from now.

All that being said - my share price is 13.28 a share so I’m not too worried.
Then why even mention if you don’t care. You’ve talked yourself into a corner.

Because that news was already priced in bro. historically, all pharma stocks get a major surge from FDA approval. Especially in these times regarding a covid vaccine. That’s your opinion though, I’m just sharing a gamble on a bet I took. I’ll bet you that dollar they close over 45 near end of December.  How is there no logic to this play when your only counter argument is that they haven’t closed above 40$? lol if you think they are staying under 40$ with fda approval, vaccine distribution starting soon then you’ll be missing out. But I’m not here to convince you to take a small bet. We will see who’s rifgt in 30 days

Started reading about Tesla in 2015. In 2017 I realized I could buy shares with an app. Very gingerly bought 1 share for about $200 then slowly bought more. Until  this time last year when it became very obvious that they would not fail. Got in for about 15k then just after Christmas went all in for about 30k. C19 hit and I got spooked. Nearly exited but hung in there and now here we are today. Tried trading some of the big swings since late summer with half my capital but find it too stressful. Was very uncomfortable with 50% on the sidelines so just put it all back in. Holding for 10 years. But so tempted to cash some out to buy a Model Y long range. I would go camping in it all the time! Ifi start in there's probably another 3-5x give over 10 years. They are aiming for 20 million units in 2030 and they already have industry leading margins per unit. And thats just on the cars.

While they already have a huge chunk of the top market share and thus limited growth opportunities for new customers, JFrog can and will raise the fees of their existing licenses and all these companies would have to comply

Artifactory has absolutely no real competition as a universal artifact storage except for Sona Nexus, which is dogshit. Even if new products do pop up, migrating from Artifactory to another service would cost way more money and time that corporation would never approve of, especially if the current solution is decent already. This is the same reason why Oracle and their shitty fucking database has made so much money for so long

Data creation is going to exponentially grow for the rest of humanity, to deal with more customers, more data, more information, and more types of software artifacts existing as well. This is great for the cloud licenses

Sorry to be the one to suggest a common sense strategy. If I were you and assuming no drug addiction issues or enormous debts, I’d make some kind of investment that pays you cash, real estate, dividends anything that can maintain your capital. Then I would use that money for my playtime on WSB.  Then If you get zeroed your can always reload.
Not the hypo. One company. Not an index.

Just roll with the dumb hypo lol.
Are you asking if there is still room for the company to grow whom 90% of Americans interact with for hours upon hours each day? No, doubt it

Just for fun as you say, in this market, I am thinking that a share price in the $120 range 6 months post announcement would be reasonable. I mean once the ANNOUNCEMENT happens, people can still get in on the warrant deal. So the convention pump and dump is unlikely here. Bill Ackman has chosen to design a stonk that truly can only go up.

If EVERYONE just watches this Ackman interview, you will see the light more clearly: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzz5SGpDrc4)

What’s the bull case for APHA specifically as opposed to other ganj companies?
Lmao our saying should be that.
You had me at manbang

-The chairman's name is Wang Bang

-Was profitable this year

-Ultimate meme potential


Can't find a date for the IPO except 'next year'.
Checked it out, doesn't fit the current criteria (looking for EV-only currently, as almost everyone else has a EV venture inside a bigger company). Thanks for thinking along!
This breaks rule 7 of this sub, Ban.
Down 8k this week. Gon sell my BABA calls open and put it all in APHA calls and make it all back

Forgot LB, they shop at Victoria secret , bath and body works too.
Can someone show me where they’re seeing the float, share and short position ratios? Everyone keeps saying it’s over 100% but I’m not seeing that anywhere..
Lmao nice! Money is money.
Because with 45k, you’d get exposure to 300 shares instead of 200, and a delta greater than 200 allowing you to have more exposure / leverage with the same capital vs just owning shares.  You’d be playing long so 300 bucks is a non issue long term (I’ve lost a few thousand in a week due to small mistimings but more than made up for it in the weeks to follow — better to get in a little early than too late)
yes
Never considered this (also I don't have this issue, yet) but curious
You c a n do this with 1k
Don’t forget LVMH. They own Sephora.
Literally just commented the same thing but with January calls, I think it could be a smart idea to load up with cheaper shares/calls while taking in the ER run up profits

But if large announcements like that are priced in, shouldn’t the short squeeze allready have kinda happened? I mean probability is taken into account ofcourse but still, I feel like if MM’s saw it as a likely hood they would either pull out of their short positions or doubt that it would make a difference for the company, in which case there is no catalyst for a squeeze at all.

Because theres weed news with legalization in Mexico and congress vote for legalization. Apha has already been on the rise off their own rep. I would expect all weed stocks will gap up but i think apha has a good chance of doubling by eow just based off weed stock mania.

PLTR to the moon? GME squeeze?
On Friday I was just sat there waiting for the first sign to sell and I dumped PLTR at $32. Absolutely no regrets
It should go down, so that means it will go up.
This will be the most retarded thing I’ll
read today.
I think it’s all about the short squeeze that might or might not happen, he said if a lot of people on WSB buy in it’ll cause something that will create a short squeeze (I’m not smart enough with this), people were asking his target sell and he put at sell order at $1000/share lmao
Looks cool
Delusional, TSLA is going to open above 600 tomorrow, and if not it will happen at open, the sell wall is nonexistent.

Not at all. It can go to $30

It's been consolidating for quite some time and they'll probably go up on the good black friday hype
Haha who knows. If I wasn’t a tard I wouldn’t have sold PLTR at $12 lol bought the day it was listed right at $10.
I bought QDEL the day it fell from 230 to 120.  I got calls at 140 then it ran back to 170.  Bought more on the way up to 170 and ended up selling them around 155.  Did a bit more trading in and out of it and ended up losing probably a thousand or two.

i was up 50% with 100 PLTR shares, bought 225 more on friday at 32, we’re🤡🤡🤡🤡
agree, long-term this is actually really good, but short-term I think my calls are f'd as well
I have Apr GME calls that I picked up last week that are up 80% already. Seems like the sentiment here is that there will be a drop after ER(IV crush/poor earnings/guidance). I still believe in the short squeeze in the short/medium term. Is the smart move to sell my calls right before ER and buy back in after ER? I'm still going to hold onto my GME shares.
Delta is the worst airline, go with Alaska and SW (LUV)
Lmao what are these bs the us is tryna pass about proving they aren’t controlled by external government will this have affect on share price ?

I have shares of GME and also some Jan 2021 calls, should I consider selling the calls right before earnings report and rebuy later in the week in case of a dump? Planning on holding shares through it

yeah, i think that’s a fantastic move that many other companies may attempt in the future, especially if the partnership plays out as well as it seems. i’ve added it to the list.
Lots of DD on them already. Cloud, Microsoft partner, strong leadership and backing, and still low. Warrants also give you leverage without having to worry about expiration/theta decay.
Parabolic hyped up shitty penny stocks.
pussy
Sussed that it can jump $20 by the 18th, but the Theta is only -¢9 compared to a Delta of ¢16. The underlying has been growing at about $2 a day as well for the last week.
No, CMPS and ATAI are the largest ones. 

The rest are either non public companies I bought before the (hopefully) upcoming IPOs or too small to mention on WSB.

I can’t wait for shitty cable programming to die.  Maybe people would begin to be less retarded and think more critically if they aren’t talked to like preschoolers.

Sat in the waiting room during the day a couple weeks ago and daytime TV is infuriatingly dumb.
So to put these numbers into shares you would own 999 shares of the new company plus the ability to own 222 additional shares at $23. Is that correct? 

And what if you can't exercise the warrant like a lot of people in here don't exercise their options. You can sell the warrants, right?

How much does GME have left to run? DId I miss the boat?
Hah it was my first ever purchase I had more and got out. I kept one share( now 5 from split) more for nostalgia purposes. But that first trade gave me the confidence to keep going so it wasn’t a total loss

One big problem I see is that the market has been extremely optimistic over the coming year. The companies are valued as if 2020 never happened and people think that 2021 growth/profitability levels will follow where they finished off in 2019. I just think people will realize that all the growth that is baked in right now might eventually be impossible to reach even for these high profile growth companies. 

What happened in 2020 was that after the initial sell-off, every single new thing was positive, whether it was liquidity, stimulus, or vaccine. Once all that fades, markets may realize that they may have been overheated/overshoot.

Hypothetically, you have cancer aids, you will die within a couple days, but hypothetically science has reached the point where they know with certainty they will develop the cure for your cancer aids within 100 years and cryogenics have reached viability to where you can go into stasis for 100 years and come out the other end just like today. Conditioned on these terms, you have to take your whole life savings (call it 250k), and put it all into SHARES (or options, if you’re a crazy motherfucker) of one company, and just one company. Just one ticker and one position. Just roll with the fucking hypo. Otherwise you die. This is a set and forget for 100 years.

You’re absolutely right. I’m going to hold some of my LEAPS I believe in long term, sell calls against stocks that have big gains I don’t want to realize, and take profits on a couple like positions IWM and BABA.

No recommendations, just advice: Understand what you are buying and look for long term buys that are undervalued. 

Make sure you spend at least 30min researching the company on your own and believe in the company before jumping in. There's definitely a lot of good DD on this sub, but you can easily get burned on some of these pump and dumps if you blindly follow.

So many retards see something double then think “oh it has to double again” or even “oh it has to crash!” No, it doesn’t have to do shit. I just ignore those stocks because it’s just a guessing game where the ath will end or if a heavily shorted stock will get short squeezed
I’m in both. NIO has a ton of room to run. $200 by end of 2022.
Anyone else hearing the buzz of magic mushroom stocks in their day to day? Might get in position for that.
cant wait to see the loss porn on this. Jk these dudes gonna swim in tendies
While the parent comment is true, don't let this discourage anyone from coming in now and still making some gains.

The one thing that I'll point out is that NVAX's Phase 3 UK trial is already fully [enrolled](https://twitter.com/TeppichTrader/status/1332629489269039104) and that data will support global licensure. Think that's underappreciated and will make this pop even more once data are released and that gets digested.

Ive been waiting for Palantir to go public for years so I always knew I'd buy it and hold without selling. Didn't expect it to reach where it is now so quickly. Really just figured I'd hold it and watch it steadily rise over the years 😂

The 80% increase in revenue early 2020 was nice, could hint at big things to come, but then again that could be because everyone was stuck inside blazing all day for 6 months.
guys how realistic is it to make $20 per day in the market and how much capital would be required
I don’t think the price is for “earnings being great” they are priced for news like “ we started a share buyback” “ we are working with Ryan Cohen to be our next ceo”  or some type of strong guidance. The numbers for this quarter don’t really matter. It’s all about what the board says.

Basically there was a glitch where if you bought stock and sold Deep ITM calls, Robinhood would double count your money so your buying power would double. You could keep doing it to leverage up to 50x-100x. Some anchor on the news said these kids need to go to jail so that scared me, but obviously nothing happened besides me getting banned
Very scientific. When it looked weak closing, I bought a few 12/11 $525P on Friday because I felt like gambling.

GME was like $10 in October, only went up $6. He must have some heavy calls expiring this week. If he bought itm, he would only score about 6-7 a pop. He must have bought a lot otm to be this aggressive then. Poor guy.

I completely disagree.  I don't think it is one giant bubble.  I think there is some froth in the market in certain places (EV, some tech including ZM, PLTR).

I think Pltr hasn't been actively traded long enough to know a fair value.  It may be $25, may be $40 or more. Same with ZM.  Fair value make be $200 to $350/share so it will correct some.

Big Tech like Amzn, Aapl, FB, Google etc may be a like overvalued but I don't think they are going to drop.  They are just going to trade sideways +/- 10% from where they are now for the next 3 to 12 mths as they grow into the valuation and the cyclicals recover.

There is still a ton of the market that is undervalued like Kss, GPS, Cnk, Gme, airlines, Ba etc that will continue to increase in value over time.  May take until early next year or even 2022 for them to mostly recover.

The market will not just collapse. It may correct again 10 to 20% but I think it will be more than that for certain companies and others will barely dip.

I actually wonder if there is a way to hedge this with SPY puts as S&P 500 may actually not drop very much as sectors improve and others drop and it may balance fairly well.
Thats what exercising means
ManBang. Enough said. How do I invest?
Pls stop with your almost daily "puts on everything" shitposts, fucking bearrorist. Literally sounds like you discovered charts a couple weeks ago.
Well that’s my advice.  Don’t wait until the end of the year to figure out how taxes work or you likely will be quite shocked when/if you go see an accountant.  Also, don’t get f’d by a November/December wash sale.

How confident is this move
Bro everything you have expires a month out. Day to day you’re fine.
This was actually exactly the case for me: I started investing in January (in $4 Nio, can you believe me blind luck), and when Nio started mooning, all the money I would have spent on dumb tangible items went into stocks instead. Made a lot, but even if I hadn't, I would have saved most of that money
Many of us are ahead of ren tech this quarter.
Do you have a stock trading discord I could pay to subscribe to?
Not playing around with calls but pretty
Confident shares will be higher in 6 months than they are now
100% probability
You’re in at 11 on PLTR, when it drops to 11 you’re selling everything and going into PLTR.

Got it. Solid indicator of the general IQ of a Palantir trader.
Still can't decide if I should go in ACB or APHA tomorrow. AHHHHHHH
I would say a 100 percent return is capable this week.
So then vote to keep.

Yes. My 4 year old actually drew these. You’ve all been duped.
The deal is already done. Stripe wants to get listed to get in on the bubble. Spac means more aligned investors. The hiring they are doing suggests either >1yr traditional ipo or spac/direct in the next month. 
Spac is more favorable than direct 
Buffet is for sure in on the deal
PSTH will get stripe and be an easy 10 bagger in 6 months. 

If COVID hadn’t hit they would traditional ipo.
Really just average
All I know is that we straight up EATIN today at Wendys
Hell ya. I think I’m going May $25 but I think Feb & Jan would print too
Where my fellow PLTR put holders at ???????? We gonna make a bank tomorrow 😎
Ah a Canadian company that doesn’t sell in America. Yes sky high
Sounds like you want me to do work on a weekend
Didnt Nio also get higher price targets. That with  their monthly numbers report for deliveries was the catalyst for their last big run
Shit ain't gonna happen. You can tell the tards "HOLD!" as much as you want but the paper hands always prevails.
And the fucking leaps. This dude will have like 10 mil+ after this squeeze
China wants foreign dollars to invest and own in China. China hasn’t done this in fact they’ve been very against it some see it as China trying to be a viable global trade partner others think China will cucky Chan everyone with it.

Deepfvalue is about to become a God of WSB if this short squeeze hits before the options expire. Literally 100k -> unknown millions
No see the disclaimer. I slowly added as I learned and increased gains. When the crash happened in March I lost 50% in a week. At that point I made my biggest deposit and was in at that point a total of 70k which was most of my life savings.

Wow every single stock is suddenly about to have a short squeeze. What a time to be alive!
I've been in before $30 and how many times now has the same scenario happened?  A 10x moon, followed by a crash and then a slow decline, followed by multiple attempts at breaking through resistance around 1/2 of the previous high, followed by breaking through to the previous high, and eventually another 10x move.  I think $200k is possible within 2-3 years, hell maybe 2-3 months.  I kept some in play since the last mooning a few years ago, I might actually sell if it hits 100k.
If it had more tutes in it I would say its a full send

Exactly right. I am a college grad and I simply don't have a rational reason to save my money. I have student debt, but the interest is at 0%, why pay it down? I don't have much overhead, why put it in bonds or a savings account? There is no returns on that. The only rational use of my money is to throw it in stocks/etfs/etc. And wait for a year and pay off my student debt. The incentives are all messed up.
Put me down for 260K. Entire net worth. I BELIEVE.
Sorry can’t hear you over my PLTR TENDIES
  

Ok, first off apologies. After reading your opening line that you definitely wouldn't recommend NVAX but haven't looked into them I assumed you were an idiot and didn't read your post as closely as I should have. You've made some valid points in your follow-up that I'll respond to:

1. I was making a general point about the distinction between the adjuvant and the antigen and trying to point out that the eventual immune response that will lead to the immunity that we care about is directed against the antigen, not the adjuvant.

2. I now see the point you were making about the mRNA vaccine being more natural and although that's a fair point, I ultimately don't think it's all that important if we reach an endpoint of functional immunity with a protein subunit vaccine. What I think is more important is the actual immunogenicity data that we have from Phase 1 trials for MRNA and NVAX, as well as the NHP viral challenge data which favor NVAX significantly. The mechanistic advantage that you're saying mRNA vaccines have might be true in principle, but it hasn't translated to superior in vivo data. Maybe that's due to mRNA dosing limitations and in the future that will be solved, but based on the existing data for the two subject vaccines, I think NVAX is be better. Now we have to see whether NVAX will match the 95% efficacy number.

3. You're right in bringing up the distinction between different antibody responses, but again I think the functional data are what matter most and the data suggest that NVAX leads to significantly higher levels of NAbs than either mRNA vaccine (not sure why you think this is a stupid term since whether or not an antibody is actually neutralizating is a critical distinction).

4. I'm well aware of the implications of individual AA residue changes on protein production, stability. But you're jumping ahead. We already know there are several spike protein mutations and we have every reason to believe that most of them will have no impact on the current Phase 3 vaccine candidates. So your original claim implying that coronavirus mutations will necessitate new vaccine candidates is wrong. In the event that we actually need new vaccines due to mutation, I strongly disagree that MRNA would be able to make the argument that they don't have a different drug product bc that new mRNA will be generating a new antigen. The only advantage they'll have is in getting the initial candidate out faster. But NVAX is actually much faster at candidate generation then people seem to realize hence the reason that they're only 1-2 of months behind despite being a much smaller company. Their technology is underrated in my opinion.

First make sure your brokerage account is cash, not margin. If it’s margin, your broker can lend out your shares, so your buying will not affect the number of available shares on the market. 

When you buy call options, the seller is required to keep a portion of the shares as a collateral in case the call gets executed. I think the portion is 20%.
No these are instructions for cool people I.e. bull gang. Bear gang already know what to do

It was a concern for them during their own trials. They were having issues with manufacturing enough doses. 

You don't seem to understand the difference between a subunit vaccine and mRNA vaccine. The mRNA vaccine produces the same protein, just inside the recipients own cells. Please explain why you think that makes it any less susceptible to mutated variants of cov2. I won't even get started as to why I don't think cov2 mutations is an issue we need to worry about. 


I think there is potentially money to be made with NVAX. It's not as solid of a guarantee in my opinion though. Worth a gamble if you're feeling lucky.

So your holding on to them waiting for the squeeze^(TM) ?

Considering buying in on Monday, afraid I might be to late tho, I may wait for a dip.
If you're messing with that $100, I suggest looking up Arkk's investment in penny stocks. Theyll pop for 20% per week before a dump. One stock you might want to put one or 2 shares into is gamestop. Their yield dividend is at 9 at the moment which is higher than that of normal dividend stocks. Once the stimulus comes in, you might see this stock sustain at around $25.

Holy shit dude how much money did you make
Wow.  I guess he is a good actor because he seems so harmless on TV.
I didnt realize we are playing with MSPaint on the weekends

You're not late at all, the short squeeze has not even started yet (aside from just a few smart shorts exiting last week). Short% is still 5x to 6x available float, and December earnings report will be a smash hit due to INSANE FORWARD GUIDANCE.   


It's like buying Tesla at $1200 pre-split. Yes you could have bought it 2 months prior for $400 (which I did) but $1200 is still a great price to pay for Tesla.

Not a tax lawyer and no idea what you usually pay the man. If this is a lot of money to you + it's short term gains, then 1) feds want their cut every quarter, 2) I suggest google "ES tax payment" to figure out when and how much, 3) congratufkglations

I've got 2000 shares of PLTR I bought at $9.10 and it's honestly been the best. At some point the hype train will die down. With something like this which is a multi year hold, I'll recommend stocks to be honest. Whenever there's a dip buy some. Rinse and repeat. Not sexy but you'll thank me in 5 years when you've got a few lambos, few oversea homes, wife, and a mistress.
Tesla is a collection of high tech startups. Robotics, AI, software, hardware, charging, batteries, robotaxi. It’s like a massive momentum of innovation.
Retard is going to end up making money anyway lol
Imagine the time it took for you to go 20 bucks in positive. How the markets had to move for this to happen.

You could literally have sucked dick for 5 mins to earn the same.

It’s so fucking shit. It actually irks me, I haven’t watched cable since I was a kid and Nickelodeon wasn’t shit

I’m happy you said that actually. At first you had me nervous but now I just realize you’re a retard so thanks for putting me at ease

SPY is made up of people selling and buying my little snowflake bear. The pronoun "she" is sometimes used to refer to things which can contain people such as countries, ships, or vehicles, or when referring to certain other machines. This, however, is considered a stylistically marked, optional figure of speech. This usage is furthermore in decline and advised against by most journalistic style guides such as the Chicago Manual of Style.[9] If used, the terms she, her, and hers are always used, regardless of the entity's name - for example, "The U.S.S. John F. Kennedy (CVA-67) was laid down October 22, 1964. She was launched on April 1, 1967..."

Many languages use gender-specific pronouns to refer to a variety of objects that are obviously without gender. Many of the Romance languages, for instance, refer to objects as “he” or “she,” instead of the non-specific “it” common to English speakers
Price of leaps are so close to shares,

You don’t get much leverage as you’d like to. 

Also as people mentioned shares reduce float calls don’t.
Was thinking up 106%, I guess that’s the correct way to interpret. Thx bbgurl

Are mods banning potential stocks that can go up because they have calls on them? If so, selfish

I’m comfortable in the medium to long side yes. The risk/reward and catalysts there are, are just too great to pull out. Yes there are some paths that take this down in a big pull back before it rises but again Ryan Cohen gets his hands on this and I can probably quit my job
Nah I’m on the east coast, somehow I timed the dip 💁🏻‍♀️ I got the touch

BABA gang can we close the gap to 290 this week before meeting big resistance?
if you never sell, you never lose!
year isnt over yet but its easy, you need to list every single option you traded even the losses.

You can find info online
That’s what I also took from this
Downward death spiraling anchor with the mass of a neutron star 😳📉
Didn't you hear - its going to the moon. The moon doesn't understand variables under 30.
Agreed. It's FOMO. I think the issue is that when you see an opportunity, you think it's once in a lifetime. So if you dont go all in, you will miss out and you will always regret it. It's like being at a live auction and people get caught in the moment bidding up something. Pretty soon they are bidding outrageous numbers and the thing is worth half or less than what they paid.

I found options in March and promptly donated $600  to theta gang. It sucked but options are almost impossible to learn without experience.
Probably because you have no idea when the squeeze will happen and if it takes six months, you'll have lost a lot of value on your contracts due to time decay compared to just holding stocks. That's at least one possibility. Haven't checked but its IV might also might be pretty high resulting in costly contracts.
Why is it a big week for Tsla?

I've just never noticed anything this excessive and impulsive. Either he is paid to do this or he is soo deep in on GME that his life depends on their success. That's why I'm legit worried about the dude. I just hope either he is getting paid for spamming and that explains it, or if not, that GME does well enough for him to cash out and not off himself.

From other comments by people that seem to know what they are talking about, it sounds like there may need to be additional SEC filings before a repurchase.  If that is the case, I'm wrong.  But that certainly doesn't make your nonsense right :)
So you're saying that when that happens, the market will be flooded with supply and they will have to drop prices to attract demand assuming there is less demand? 
But couldn't you make the argument also that because interest rates may continue to be low, people are waiting to buy (hidden demand), and if the economy recovers soon (people resume paying mortgages and rent) that the market won't crash?
There's a big difference between 93% and half

Agreed on longer term calls.  Whatever you do please no $25-$30 calls with 12/4 12/18 exp. If this thing were to really start running and breaks 20 with what seems like continuation towards 25+  and you're all happy about you FD's might just be able to print, (especially if it's a Friday) Right around 23 watch out for fucking Citron.

How much further will tesla run up?
Not dumb at all?  Do you think $25 is a good price to get in?  If you do, and think that there's future upside from there, it's a can't-lose play.
Just shares? Very impressive. My question would be why get out before end year? Tax wise you’d be better off continue to play unless you think it’ll crash before Jan 1

Honestly.... im expecting a repeat of last year. Big players take profit, which is selling, stocks go down then we find the bottom, and ride this bitch back up. Or we continue only mostly up.
Ah yeah I saw that. Hopefully a juicy dip this week I can hop in on
GM isn't a bad play with the EV Hummer on the way but definitely don't sell TSLA for it
This is what these tards don’t understand. Sales have cratered at GME while the industry is at all time highs 

GME has been closing stores and losing money for the past 2 years because people are downloading games. There is no way to save this company

Yeah I believe in Airlines. I don't think people will travel as much as they did, mostly businessmen now realizing that online-meeting works well. But they are still going to go up more than they are at now in 3+ years.
It seems like calls are free money for another few weeks or even longer. No way this can happen tho, right?
I'm confused, would calls not be better? why is everyone advocating shares over options ik shares are obvs safer and better long run but people made a lot on options last squeeze

Just your daily reminder that Fast Money hasn’t advised it’s viewers to buy TSLA a single time in the past year. Not once. And even now, after a 780% year, they still won’t swallow their pride and say “hey, maybe we missed this one.” Carry on
Ye, pretty much.

TLDR: You described margin, which can act as a specific form of leverage. But leverage is a broader concept and margin has more purpose than just leverage.

Rug pull /tax sell off doesnt come for at least another week.  
Then we can start to worry.
Ackman has actually said that he's looking for a 10-20% stake for \~$5-7B. Please don't spread easily falsifiable misinformation.

The link between BRK and PSTH is the least substantiated, yes. But the insane positions by Klarman, Guggenheim, ONT Teacher's and Blackstone make things more interesting. As well, BRK shedding JPM, the secret position they are hiding and the HUGE outstanding PSTH position make anything possible. Nothing is for sure, but the mountain of circumstantial evidence here correctly fuels speculation.
I don’t want your money I just want you to take mine and turn it into something LOL
Whats going with them??  Puts for next week??
Hurrr durrr

Sure but is Porsche announced they are building new factories to churn out more cars? I didnt hear anything, so expecting them to produce significantly more cars in the coming years is baseless. 

They are building and selling as many cars as they can. Porsche also will never release a cheap electric car and dilute its brand name so it will never compete with TSLA only the top top segment of the market.
Would like to know what you think about PLTN. SHOP. & ETSY.
Small dick energy, and maybe concerns WSB might go to hard....

just get in and buy shares. don’t expect the goddam squeeze to happen on monday. buy in and enjoy the ride.

Klarman and Buffet would NEVER park money in a SPAC...they have millions of places to park their money and would never just throw it in a SPAC unless they knew what it was acquiring. Klarman bought at 22.60 so there is downside to his purchase. He bought at 15% premium.
Is this a subscription service or a one time purchase ?

And on there way to produce every single car component in house .... psh let me throw my money in General Motors.
That’s what I meant. But the points the same he would lose money exercising
I have a very embarrassing confession to make.  I was so bored watching the Falcons game, that I clicked on a Motley Fool article.  Thank God I did.  The advice was absolutely brilliant.  Stupid me was planning on keeping my TSLA stock until I died.  The wise "Fool" however, advises to sell TSLA and buy, yes, wait for it:  GM.  So, there's the Monday move fellas, sell TSLA and buy GM.  And they say the Motley Fool is a scam.  Hah.  https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/29/the-only-electric-car-stock-worth-buying/
Airlines, I guess? They're running on government life support rn but once people are vaxxed and society is closer to normal they'll rebound
Road system isn’t TSLA - can’t even keep the companies straight. It’s like tards that buy TSLA when SpaceX has a successful launch
Which stock moons higher this week: 🍏 or Tesla? Both are set to skyrocket this week but not sure which one goes higher

Last month of the year to lock in those taxes and last month mango is in office. How can you guys be bullish rn
Had to close the thread on "Stripe is the next Google."

Stripe isn't even the next Square.
noooooo, we havent even started yet
I wanted to just laugh at this but the way you worded it makes me think you’re not joking
You should know that I am brand new to investing, I started during the first wave. My father told me to buy and hold ETFs so I did, but dedicated about $1000 to “fun money”.

Somehow I landed on your first NVAX post, which got me reading. So the $1000 went to NVAX while it was around $75/share. 

Since then I’ve done more research on NVAX vs other vaccine stocks, and since bailed on my grandpa ETFs to go all in on NVAX.

So the question is: are you the bigger autist or am I?
I’m confused.. are u bullish or bearish?

If they had a draw line then yeah. If not the bets are void
Tech still hasn't recovered from Early September.  There has been no sustained rally and still way off ATH.  You guys talking about a rug pull, fear greed index etc. from what I can see Tech is due for a rally not another rug pull.
RemindMe! December 9th 2020
What stops ackman from doing an early redemption once those warrants becomes exercisable - he can redeem them for like 10 cents iirc? Wouldn't that meant that you can't really hold them for 5 years even if you would like?

I’m all with the plan, but why?
What’s your move after GME? Or are you not able to determine right now because I know you momentum trade
This is unreal, some traders speculate that TESLA will reach 1k.
I won't bet against it that's for sure.
You really really don't need any luck for that. Thats a guaranteed.
Selection bias. Now find all the stocks that reached 5% sentiment, died down and were never mentioned again.

Luckin Coffee is one such stock. I still remember every autist in here talking about it. Then it died down. And there are many others like it.

WSB are experts in thinking they are unique. We are not. Most retail traders lose money over time, and it's completely naive to think WSB is different in this regard.
Ahh gotcha, thanks!

You are the equivalent of aol chat rooms during the dot com boom. Nothing you are doing is knew or different, nor is the market or the companies your pumping up. It’s a story as old as the markets. Before the internet, yolo’s were shared by fax, before that carrier pigione. The reason no one talks about this, is because it’s a mere footnote to history, as will be wsb. In a world with billions of people and centuries of history, you cannot be special, period.

They are building an underground road system in Las Vegas, built complete power systems in Australia and other parts of the world, making the only true self driving car at the moment (this could change), building roof singles with solar components built in, I could keep going but this would just cause more people to buy Tesla 🙃

Probably gonna ribbit my way into 🐸 at open tomorrow
Nobody is sure of anything. But if you look at the possible catalysts vs downside. They have a lot going for them. Risk/reward is there. There are a lot more informative posts on here and even online. Do research. Read. Make your own decisions. Don’t listen to people.

You permabulls aren’t the only people on this sub it’s not a crime to point out short exposure on a stock on a clear pullback. Get over yourself pussy. Don’t see you calling out the people who spent the last 72 hours pumping PLTR but you’re balls deep in my activity because I hit a nerve. 👀
Pretty sure if PSTH  <> Stripe was actually happing, John Collison wouldn't be joking about it on Twitter.
MGNI
Woah that was big brain
I'll enjoy becoming one then
Bare minimum would be enough to sell puts (or put spreads) against pltr probably. IV is crazy right now so you could start a very unexciting portfolio with $3k I suppose. Though you'd probably be better off buying if it stays green tomorrow and selling calls. You'd have to check option pricing to see which was worth it.

Many stocks listing less than $20 seem to be garbage for premium selling (personal opinion).  Though some spacs to have options chains which reduces risk as they are unlikely to go below $10. I usually buy the 10p for pennies to keep capital open if I'm going to sell puts on a spac.

If you're serious someone posted a high iv list on r/thetagang today. You can also set a screener up with most brokers software.
the link between BRK and PSTH lacks any substance    😒

Ackman has said they are looking to invest in a company with around $10B market cap, Stripe is much more than that
Thats where the budget comes in trying to reign in the spending

Fuck this guy. I’d rather scan WSB than listen to a word this clown says
No background. Do my own research and make my own choices. I come here for funny shitposts and cool gain/loss porn not actual stock advice. Probably people’s biggest mistake is listening to other people. I would think if you made some money on others advice it would be very difficult to keep it going.
The chewy thing interest me, GameStop definitely could be a big online presence. Lets just hope their not like blockbuster hahaha

0.1 up. 0.1 down, okay whatever. As theta gang that’s good. 

I buy calls and sell puts. But, some of you guys don’t realize that when the stock goes up, that’s good for us. It means we can buy to close out of our position quicker. 

Not everything needs to stay neutral always.
I bet gold sees 1500 again before there's a massive spike too.

Oh guess it would be state by state. In Colorado we're paying they same if not cheaper for better quality weed from dispos including tax. But we've been legal the longest and prices weren't always that much better from dispos, so it'll either just take time for it to be better or the way Nevada set it up is just shit.

I’ll be interested to see if this post gets removed.  Lots of GME posts being removed right now.  I bot voted to keep it FYI.
Ah yes red means you can't sell until you blow up your entire account, I forgot.
I hope they get crushed like I did in September then make their come up. No handouts like we have been having these few weeks.
No those are just what I’m in now..... I’ve been in and out of a ton of companies. Biggest gainers. Dkng(DEAC) nkla(vtiq) were my biggest gainers early on from options calls though.
So its not doing anything and thats evidence that it might do something? Nah
i actually have completely rethought it where i’m currently at, so I agree

Whats the catalyst?
You seem a bit upset
Nobody seems to mention the oddity of NIO's PT's.. like, how are they so high..? Or is it literally just free money.. i know i know, don't take PT's seriously, but even half that gain on contracts is multiple 10 baggers..
What's the name?
I’m assuming it’s in reaction to all of the mouth breather one liner PLTR pumping. But it’s harming the refined commentary by WSB scholars like “positions of ban” “fuck you” “fuck off” and “ban.”

I need the crsr ceo to tweet that he is sleeping on the factory floor to be able to keep production up for all their products that are almost sold out.
We average between -1200% and +17,450%, so imma say yes.
Every platform has the dumb af fees - $10 per options trade +1.25 per contract.

Anything below like, $4 per contract makes no sense to buy unless you’re absolutely sure it’ll print lol
I think so. And there are a lot more informative posts on here that explains the pros and cons. Be careful about earnings coming up and be confident before you invest in anything.

Literally this auto mod shit is so dumb, I just blocked my position or ban comment.
Write cash secured puts against SPY to gain positions or buy multiples of 100 and write weekly calls that require a 20% rise in price. Rinse and repeat until you have a much larger position and can generate significant weekly income.

Take some profits and dump into another account to scalp options based on trends, take those profits and buy leaps on companies in emerging markets

Ta-daaaa~~~
Honestly the best thing to do is just mess around and find out. Buy some deep OTM options, puts or calls, and just learn how they work. Also research what the Greeks are, etc.

Why are some realtors so arrogant I was going to use my cousin to sell the house that I’m flipping then I heard he was telling my other cousins that I’m going to lose money i don’t know what I’m doing he also named the price that he wants to sell it at which was 30k under what similar houses are selling for now I’m hiring another realtor she did over 150 deals this year and my cousin only did 7 deals I thought I was being nice by using him then he backstabs me

I'm a little confused and naive here on how this was accomplished, can you please explain?

Is this your entire portfolio shown here? Just consisting of PSTH, ACB, FSR, and GME? I see you at \~5.6k in Jan, so \~75.6k total deposits, if you bought in on those positions at the best possible times I'm seeing a max of around 2-3x per position? Seems like you'd be nowhere near 1.2M, maybe closer to 400k depending on your balance, what am I missing?

The notification was from automod and it said the filter could catch false positives, I guess my question is are we not allowed to shitpost at all anymore?

Calling all big dik theta gang, how successful have you been selling puts or calls? I’m think of selling cash secured puts. Worst case get assigned sell covered calls. “Wheel strategy”. Need Christmas money. Any advice? I know my risk and how much I’m willing to lose. How much cash is a good starting point? Any advice? Thinking of getting a personal loan as I asked earlier.
They are voting on a federal level week, but the rumor sell the news. Unless they pass it then this and every other marijuana stock is going to fucking Pluto
Yes, you are. At least when it comes to OEM quality processes and liabilities.  You are hand waving it away like Tesla is a victim of some third party and all’s well now that it’s been “found.”  The reality is Tesla is the manufacturer, either directly or indirectly, and are the final authority on whether something is made to their specification or not.

This is compounded by the fact that this has been a known defect for the better part of a decade and Tesla has been covering up their shit design and shit validation practices all along.  Our government entities are either so worthless or so corrupt that it took Chinese regulators to finally force a recall on this and Tesla then had the gall to blame Chinese drivers.  

Now I gotta go find the link to the Dutch taxi company that’s suing Tesla too because their fleet is down almost all the time for service with things like wishbones and control arms snapping.  Tesla there tried blaming it on it being a taxi fleet.  No fucking shit it’s a taxi fleet, they (TSLA) okayed it from the start.  Other OEMs covet taxi deployments as a torture test opportunity and a marketing testament to their products durability.  Not TSLA.

Once shorts are forced to cover if it ever happens.. Will hold till the SS happens if it doesnt & the hype dies down I'll just exit and move to the next meme stonk
You are about 3 years late to this trade.... The plan was munchkin to release them, but that didn't happen.

Cashed out all my preferred for 120% in LTCG 🤷🏻‍♂️

This Wed or Thurs deliveries release.  I am honestly thinking more there will be a run up in the days prior more than a huge spike on the release though could definitely happen. If I had to guess...5.8-5.9k for Nov and 6.2-6.3k for Dec.  Anything above those levels and could be a big pop.

They were buying at $4.  You realize they've bought back over a third of the float in the last few years, correct?  It would have been idea to buy more at 4, but we were in the middle of a pandemic with no end in sight when this was at 4.  Buying back a shit ton of shares could have put them in a bad place (cough, airlines, cough).  Reasonable business decision.

They just paid off 125 million of that debt dearly.  They made it through until console season and models are estimating them having around a billion in online sales in Q4.  They probably have more cash atm than they can shake a stick at.  The price will not be under 10 again for years, if it ever goes back there.  Within the next 6 months, 13 a share will look stupidly cheap.

It sounds like you have a vague understanding of what is going on, and follow the stock some, but you're missing the overall picture here

I like pltr, gotta say I'm a big fan
It doesn't get included until the 21 It still has room to run.
Couldn’t be, the government and gov agencies has used their software for a while

Even if Cramer started as a genius playing to retards, you eventually start believing the shit you do every day, what I’ll call the Alex Jones effect
I opened this account in 2017 and made my first buy last September but didn’t really get into it till this January. Definitely luck involved but definitely using what you’ve learned to your advantage is key. And playing simple risk/reward percentages. I have some good alerts set up to try and read things early when they hit the web so I do try some research.

But why didn't Pfizer stay above 40 on the news? Why would it jump MORE than it did on the 9th when they were the first and ONLY successful vaccine? 

There is no logic whatsoever to this play. You could say the options are cheap,  but that's based on an unrealistic expectation. They are expensive as I see it based on known performance based on essentially identical news only 3 weeks ago.

I bet you $1 PFE doesn't close above 40.5 a single day in December (break even for the 12/31 $40 call based on current price).
Imagine paying taxes.

buying power at $1.02

buying that worth in shares for you tomorrow 😫
Turns out this is possible timezone-wise if we all just move to an island in the Indian ocean East of Madagascar. 

...I'll prob just keep waking up early.
FACTS
K but 
Why
This whole post is people holding calls reassuring each other with less dd than a rocketship emoji on a pltr post
I’d wait for a breakout. Seems we are rotating away from tech and December could be volatile. Long term, with more and more liquidity, small caps would have higher potential.
Tdameritrade. 0.65 USD per contract.
Most of my life energy is being channeled to GME
Positive five? What
EU is pretty big mate, we got capital gains in the UK
0dte ftw
If you ain’t married it a big gamble for sure. Not worth the risk. Rather have actual roommates.
Try lightstream they’re from suntrust. Easy , deposit next day! Everything is done remotely.
If you want to get into the weeds of it all, there are good arguments for buying the holding company PSCM instead of the SPAC. I personally like the SPAC but will look at the holding company as well. Your comments, while important to consider, expose that you have read basically none of the arguments against your own position, which is a major red flag. Your interpretation of Ackman's most recent moves also exposes some basic issues in understanding the impact of these moves for shareholders. He essentially bought insurance in the form of credit default swaps to protect his investors in the spring. He turned 27 million into 2.6B, one of the single greatest trades in history. He then took that 2.6B and dumped it into the value companies PS was already long on (in March when they were all trading at all time lows). He not only called the collapse beautifully, he capitalized on this by buying into the companies he was long on at a record discount. The 10 companies he holds are all largely recovered save the Howard Hughes Corp (another interesting buy at present that will balloon in months to come with recovery of REIT sector). PSCM is also incredibly bullish on buy backs. To suggest he's not done well for investors really points to the need for further reading on your part, respectfully.

Yeah a lot of hedge funds have been buying up GM for this reason. Dan Loeb specifically
Let me sell you some puts
It is overvalued by every metric except speculation. I sold all my calls on the 50+ day. I went into puts. So many better plays. CRSR is not a fair investment until the 30s. I rather own the competitors than CRSR at these evaluations.
that is exactly whats happening. Casinos and hotels are just trying to keep the lights on and the only people showing up are people who would never be able to afford something like that anyway.

Technical alone, Q4 Earnings should be good as Black Friday and Christmas sales will be on Q4, Shake up with Ryan (AS LONG AS HE CALL THE SHOTS) will bring this low $30s. With the squeeze, anything is possible. I expect a dip after Q3 earnings.   


My strategy, Buy now with stop loss set right before Dec 8th. Then buy back in after Q3 earning shed off weak hands. I am not going to try options as Q3 earnings on Dec 8th is an unknown.

Margin - broker knows how much you’re borrowing and will defend (close) your position when it becomes risky (for them). 

Loan - bank has no clue how much risk you’re exposing them to by gambling with their money. Broker does not know (or care) you’re borrowing the money- will let you lose it all.
That doesnt say anything about gm or their ev batteries which i believe they make their own batteries, which in itself if fuxking massive. Gm will be supplyimg ev batteries to lots of ev companies, imo

Vale was hyped for battery day, so they failed
Hi fellow PhD Pumper, 

I wrote the MRNA DD. I've been digging into NVAX more and more since reading your posts and I am going to get rid of my NIO and PLTR positions to buy into NVAX. Those trains are slowing down.

The phase 1/2 neutralization data is pretty convincing. Hopefully the PFE and MRNA EUA boosts we will see in December will drive up NVAX as well.

I will say that I think NVAX is shoddily run and it is a gamble to expect them to follow through or be honest about what they are seeing. Everybody loves fairytales though and it will pay off bigly if NVAX can show good efficacy. You're toast if it doesn't for whatever reason. Plenty of vaccines have looked great in phase 1/2 and shat the bed in phase 3. It's also worth noting that as other vaccines are approved, NVAX might have a lot of trouble recruiting people to their trial or preventing them from dropping out.

Good luck!

Great points! I personally have a price target of 45-50 by end of year when the vaccine distributions start to roll out. Let’s face it, FDA is under massive amounts of pressure. Once they approve this EUA, Pfizer’s rockets will blast off. I think it’s a great alternative vs Moderna whos premiums are already too insanely high. PFE is a solid company and there’s no reason they shouldn’t be moving once the FDA clears them. I think it’s a really good gamble to get some amazing returns. I was amazingly shocked when I saw how cheap the calls were. I’ll take the risk on this one

I will see how the week plays out. If it gets to 18 I might sell my itm calls and then be ready to jump back in with shares after hours depending on the earnings call or wait for the dip.It’s tough because my gains are so high if I could theoretically hold through earnings and the end of year. It would make a big difference tax wise for this year at least
Item #1 on most wsb to-do lists. If market is green and enough autists buy and hold it could trigger a squeeze.
My point was that a bunch of retards jumping on the stock will make it go up and then MMs will pull the rug, not that you'll get 10,000% gains.

WARRANT EXPLANATION. Put another way, assume you buy 999 shares today at $24 ($24k). You hold through the merger. Suppose the stock post merger trades at $40 (very conservative).

With regard to the initial common shares, you would realize a profit of $15,984 (67% gain)

PLUS (due to the warrant structure)

You would realize the ability to execute 222 warrants at a strike of $23 for a profit of $3774 (74% gain).

The warrants don't expire for 5 years....and $40 target is very conservative. Ackman looking for a 10-15% stake for $5B, meaning the company will have to be worth something in the range of \~$50B. These numbers are fluid atm.

No, I don’t think it’s retarded. Because they will still use PFE’s vaccine. Walgreeend and CVS already stated that it wouldn’t have a problem storing the vaccine at the correct temperature. MRNA and whoever else won’t be able handle all of the worldwide requests for vaccines so best believe there will be a few vaccines in the mix. You don’t think a covid vaccine once fda approved will make the stock price increase by 15-20%? Not a retarded play at all but like I said it is a gamble to get a great reward with limited risks since the calls are still super cheap right now. MRNA premiums are way too high, so where do you think the next stop will be to get cheaper calls?
This is wholesome. I love you retard, I hope she likes being poor.

He must be very autistic lmao... Must be betting those charity dollars
There's a fine line between Saturday Night and Sunday Morning
Anyone else want the market to pullback 10% just to get the bears are fucked comments back when they over commit? Bears are far from fucked right now because they don't exist. Call to put ratio is at an all time low.

TLDR: Make Bears Fucked Again
Uhhh.. More like anywhere in the country outside of New York City or Los Angeles lol.. My house is in a super nice suburb outside of Phoenix. $330k for 3000 sq ft 2 year old house.
You been stocks only?
Or bought leaps tomorrow morning
Advice is to watch the price of your option relative to the stonk price and see how options pricing is diff then stonk. And be patient
Get your cocks ready for CRSR tomorrow. Maybe even get a lil pregame stroke going.
Im sensing APHA calls the move at open??

I do know a guy that uses motley fool and pays for the subscription. He's done really well actually, got ZM at $90 Tesla at $600 pre split and a few others. Word is tho their quality has slipped since they sold out. IDK tho, I'm not sure I'd shell out the dough. There's just so much info available now

 I mean I really do. But can also see a pull back scenario after earnings. The bottom line is Ryan Cohen is in and looks like he do whatever it takes to get control of this thing. And IF he does. It’s rocket city.
Into Apex for 6 digits. Expecting run to $20 - $25 in next 2 weeks.  Also into ipoc buying yhe pullback on that.

you do realize those tickers have millions in volume each day, and wsb probably accounts for like 4% of that, probably less
Do you plan to sell a portion before earnings or will you just hold.

Super
It seems extremely overvalued imo, may be a good short long term once all vaccine talks are priced in.
This is a terrifyingly account of how I and my asshole felt at that time. Fuck.

Worst thing is that I "bought the dip" when it crashed to 2 dollars. At least my average isn't 4.6 dollars anymore and my funds are too tied up in GNUS and other shit stocks to buy a rope.

God damn the pumpers are resorting to simp stories?! We have got to be near the end of this absolute madness.
Monday is 50% PLTR, 50% GME. Gotta diversify a bit, autist.
I get the feeling TSLA will tank again once we pass the 12/1 inclusion date. Yes I know funds are forced to buy the stock making it go up more. But I also heard the argument that more retail would buy in after the stock split and it dropped 30% after.    
    
Then again, might be my 🌈🐻 tendencies flaring up again. Might have to do a second round of conversion therapy.

Who was the guy that gave a step by step on how to pump and dump?
If there is low open interest, volume, and a wide bid ask you may have difficulty selling. Never assume someone will buy your option that you opened. That is why I recommend starting with high volume/open interest options.

How far in advance do they have to announce, and does it have to include the date?  I've read mixed things, but the general consensus was that they have 100 million left in repurchases approved right now.  Is it possible they cleared it previously and are just now buying the remaining shares?

This was the dip. Buy right at market open if it opens below 30. even if it dont you should probably buy. PLTR only go up

A few weeks after the covid crash I sold out 500k worth of tech and sp500 and and moved into biotech and small caps. About a month ago I moved the remaining 250k that was still in tech or sp500. 
 
Overall it has been more profitable than if I had continued to hold tech and SPY. 

Going into the end of the year I have now over 1 million betting on biotech, small caps and value stocks. Should be interesting.

I have a friend at work who invests heavily but just stocks, never plays options. He has over 480k in his account, made over 100k this month alone. He's talking to me a lot about XPEV lately.

Other picks he's big on: APTX, PLTR, and he thinks DKNG would be good for options but he refuses to play options. I know he's about $200k in TSLA and also has a bunch in NIO. Rest is diversified.

I think he also said he's really interested in DNNGY but I can't remember if that's the specific ticker.
You know I realized, this community is actually much more helpful and informative than r/investing or r/options with the addition of humour, making some great friends here, ❤️ you my fellow autists🎈

in case its not, and in case you aren't just trolling, I have done this below in comments. The math is pretty straightforward friendo, what people need help with on here is building up a stomach for risk and the ability to capture reward
I think PLTR will be red or slightly flat on Monday and definitely flat on Tuesday-Wednesday. After that who knows

CRSR is more interesting. If Monday it gaps down im definitely buying the dip.
There's no such thing as a split senate. If they vote 50/50, Kamala Harris is called in for a tie break vote. I'm sure can guess which way that goes
I didn't know he did interviews anymore? What did he say? Was it about his new desk?
Bought one with my TSLA tendies, am loving it. Beautiful car
Thanks for going more in depth. I think its good to use as a hedge. I mean this market has gone up, up, up. Just for safety, couldn't hurt to get some uvxy shares. If shit unexpectedly hits the fan there are some good gains to be had. If it stays flat then loses are minimal when compared to the options plays im used to making.
sounds reasonable to me.
Wtf is this post?? Its not even a meme its like some Indian scammer asking for bobs Ban
Well it went up 20% on a half day of trading. I would say the cat is out of the bag. The good thing is there is room to run since this stock previously did a 20 to 1 reverse split when it was about to get delisted. So it seems like the stock price is expensive but its actually not. Compare it to moderna that has the same price. Moderna has a float of 300 million shares. Nvax has a float of 60 million shares. One share of nvax is worth 5 times as much of the company as moderna. This also means nvax price is 5 times easier to move based on buying shares.

If nvax becomes THE vaccine for Corona in the spring, it will go past 200. We will know if that will be the case much sooner.
Why not ask r/stocks, r/investing as well?  


I was hoping for the big names holding millions of shares in your list.

perfect. my average is $14.97 for my 2690 shares. I am aiming to be at 3.5k shares tomorrow. i will send you a DM to update the spreadsheet when that is done.

&#x200B;

i also have 5 contracts of 22C 7/16/2021.
Why's that? Personal DD makes me feel it'll print till beginning of January. Not just because of the U.S, but Mexican legilization. I'm yoling a grand into APHA calls.

Had a date with this chick I met off Yelp years ago and on our first date we checked out some  farm to table place because she was a “Foodie”. 


She was asking the waiter about the environment the chickens were raised in and  it was just uncomfortable & super awkward. Manager got involved. It was awful. 

Told her I didn’t give a shit if the chickens ran a Fight Club. 

Was a first & last date. 
I think about it every time I buy eggs.

Bruh, I been watching snatch and run clips of porch thieves  captured on other folks’ ring cams, it like these mother fuckers are running the 40 yard dash at the combine. Instead they snatching grandma’s Xmas presents. If only it wasn’t a crime/tort set up boobietraps.

What else do they produce? Solar panels based on their purchase of Solarcity where Elon cucked TSLA shareholders to help out his family?

These brainless lemmings love the line “it isn’t just a car company”

Are they an apparel company because of their short shorts? Are they an alcohol company because of Teslaquila? 

Or are they a media company because of all the orchaestrated media hype to pump the stock price?
All the smart ones.

I'm pretty sure I'll be a whale by the time this is done, but we shall see! Never before seen such a sure win

I'm guessing 32-33 on PLTR and CRSR 42 tomorrow. What do you guys think realistically?
Yes it is hard to envisage Repubs signing favourable deal for incoming Dems. Could be a bit of a weird month ahead
Dealers will lend their shares out for shorts to borrow. We want to buy up enough shares so that the number available to borrow goes negative. Then shorts have no option but to send the price (briefly) to the moon to cover their position.

The OP here is pointing out that we need to force the situation, we can't just wait for it to occur.

Hey I opened a position that I have no understanding of and now I am returning to ask somebody to tell me exactly what to do with it because I have no idea what's going on 🤠 - Every Newtard
The fed has never used the methods they’ve recently used to keep shit floating. One consequence is this insane run. It’s just as likely it will keep going until a precipitating event. Until then, good news will continue to have at least 3x the impact as neg news on the market.
I recommend LULU bigtime, I passed one location near a popular mall, lines were out the door, people limited to the inside but people were absolutely waiting to get their LULU gear, probably gonna go tits up
I don’t really know, but I found out PLTR is another word for money, Citron is irrelevant, dd is what you have to upvote

I mean Tesla has had 5 10% days and this is a meme stock you fool, we play till we are poor and accounts are post worthy weather we are on our way to the lambo dealership or on the way to ur girlfriends boyfriends house to pick her up. Us degenerates have been talking about the stock all weekend and you think we are not gonna rally???? You are the foolish one that will miss out

I'll be lucky to get this amount of money in 10 years haha. But thanks :p

Would love to but the courts won’t force her and she enjoys using him as a way to extort money from me. Was making great head way rite before covid and now covid has halted that
I can’t read
Just invest your money conservatively and occasionally spend it on nice things directly rather than squander it on the wall street casino
Yup. Just ride the wave
ah, that explains everything. thanks!
Is that you @Yolo? 😉

In since September
I’m still rookie, got PLTR at $15 so was very happy. But sitting around Thanksgiving, it seemed all the retard subs I subscribe to were ready to use Friday open like a backwoods hillbilly uses a canoeing city dweller brought ashore. 

Friday open confirmed we were still on our way at $33 so I used margin for the first time. $20k worth at $32.50. Haha, fuck! 

(That would make a decent t-shirt)
I'm very tempted but I'm afraid of what my wife and her boyfriend will say
Dominos is a tech company that happens to sell pizzas
The thing is we've reached the same "peak" as 2000 much more slowly. It's taken us about 2x as long (5 years vs 10 years) which makes me think we still have room to run. But if we do the eventual pullback will be spectacular.
So increasing wages forced your competitors who aren’t as liquid to increase their wages as well. Media attention, where people want to work, who they support etc.
Cause they stick their whole fist up there
Went up about 200% in a month then corrected like 10-15%... don’t think that’s a crash.
Y
Yup.  Options have changed the way that I look at money.  Imagine burning $2000 in 100$ bills, it would be difficult.  But if it happens on my RH portfolio over a day I barely flinch.  I think the biggest thing is my ability now to commit and take calculated risk, that in my opinion is worth every dollar I have gained and lost this year.
Burry, while right on the housing bubble, was 2 years early so stop with this bullshit.
I just saw midaswhale30 post and I think he has like 40000 shares
This is not r/antstreetbets and this post breaks rule 7 of this sub. Ban
The brothers retweeted something making fun of traditional IPOs. So you sir, are uninformed. I’ll make sure to come back to this and take a steamy dump on your chest in the near future
Was about to give someone gold for the first time, and the payment screen come up and its $5. 5 DOLLARS for a fucking internet award???!?? Are you shitting me? Who buys this shit?
The man himself has spoken
I'm Ron Burgundy?
I feel like I'm just running around putting out pointless fires on this thread. Its a DD, and a legit one. Any fair-minded reader understands that and my comments have reflected the relative risk associated with PSTH. I see upside regardless of whether its Stripe, but the evidence thus far in favor of Stripe is my DD and the Yolo Capital Mgmt long history of posts outlining the case. Your argument is that one of the Collision Bros liked a tweet and that I don't have a long posting history. Provide some context for your well-thought out and imaginative posts. 

And btw, I've posted on REIT in the summer and was correct in those positions. But again, the PSTH DD speaks for itself and readers who actually read it and the more interesting discussion on the thread are going to make decisions for themselves. Signal >Noise>>>Nonsense \^\^
End of Jan, get Feb calls. iPhone 12 sales weren't included in the last ER, meaning this one will be a beat.

Excellent DD. Can you help us out by doing an example? Let's say psth is exactly at $25 a share now and I buy $25k worth and hold through announcement, merger, and warrant assignment. During this time the value per share rises to $100. What would my initial invest be worth with warrants etc?
Sell when you lose like 40%. You'll never make it back in time
4k is not enough to be considered gains according to rule 7. Ban

i'd say the threshold should be 2 factor anything with 90% plus upvotes and/or more than 20 or so comments should be protected from auto janitor actions.
Almost every day from the last 2 weeks has been +5 - 15% but I assume there may be a dip soon since we just had two crazy +12% days in a row
What is Zoom gonna do?
🔮🔮🔮🔮
No respect, I tell ya. No respect.
Glad to be balls deep alongside you and the rest of the GME Gang. 

May the tendies be ever in our favor.
As a simple Jack I am considering dumping 24k into GME tomorrow
You had me at GME
The mods are probably going to delete this.

I would say it's r/smallstreetbets appropriate.

You might also jump to r/pennystocks. 

They might like this kind of thing.

I imagine there are some whales on r/WallStreetBets that could buy a $6.9 million company without even batting an eye.

I will say that is an interesting idea, but I don't know enough about the industry to know the real players. I imagine that there are other companies because I imagine the centrifuge industry worldwide is already larger than $6.9 million. There's probably a couple China stonk scams in the space given that the country makes the majority of PPE globally.

PLTR is the holy grail of stocks, its set to go to $1000 a share any day now. 

Citron is company that makes lemons, but they suck so we dont like them.
Way too much euphoria rn. Yes everything is oVerPricEd but I would expect things stay like this at least till Christmas.
Nice DD, but this is a penny stock. Try r/baystreetbets
[deleted]
Why isn’t PLTR banned but every other ticker on earth is, the mod is balls deep in calls I know it
I don't know shit about calls and options whatever that stuff is but I have 500 bucks. Can I make money off this if I just buy like 20 shares of the company monday morning? How long will it take until the stock price rises and what do y'all think it's going to rise to?
Hit up NRZ if you take this route
12/4 900c
I mean this is nothing new.
For the 9,000th time Tesla is a tech company that happens to sell cars.
Thank you for your money 🤣
Are you asking if we gave up on free tendies?
Games are free, that means GME 📉
actually, that may have been last weeks play and this weeks vote is a Sell The News type event for weed stocks..
I, too, sold 12/18 130s.

We can hope. Think 620 is more realistic. But I have a shit ton of calls going into next week.
Yep i was a new investor and probably would have sold some shit, i sold off things i wish i didnt early on.. but seeing everything that has skyrocketed its so hard to not think of hindsight.
No, the GME train hasn't even gotten to the station yet

Oh what do you know you are the same idiot who was looking to get his hand held earlier
how many here bought a tesla this year?
I have two deep ITM tsla calls. Every time TSLA moves 50$ i make 10k so this would please me.
Don't buy FDs and you'll be fine. Buy calls 4-6 weeks out and you'll print
so i could just hire a data scientist instead
Hard as hell to rob people these days
[removed]
Chose APHA instead man. EOY it for a few $.
And there are people who pay that? Crazy. is there any planet on which that would be worth it?
TSLA/ NIO/ PLTR/ CRSR/ PTON/ ZM all got pumped to retard levels, so if I had a huge stake in shorting GME I’d pull out
That's why I said to keep a part for other stocks too. 1 mil dividends and 200+k on the market. Dividends will always keep you afloat and with the rest you can make more cash easier, considering your initial capital and your current one. 

Ironically this is my exact plan if I ever get that much money. Seems the ticket for an easy life, retiring when you want and still playing the market.
Must be nice. Teach me the ways

Yeah, they should remove it, or place it when a post hits (X) number of votes for example 50. Some really good content get removed

Nv too late to be a degenerate
So 6k to 1.2 mill in year yea right
I have to hit at least 36 to make money due to the price I paid for the contracts even though the strike price is 32.  The date is when it expires so if it goes above my break even point (36$) any time before that I can sell for profit or exercise the options
TSLA vs Everyone. Seems like a fair fight.
just another gay tsla bear
Nope. It’ll probably go up Monday through Wednesday. Then take a dip

Look at 6 month/1 day chart. Broke out of July-November base with huge volume.
After listening to Donnie’s interview this morning, I think there’s at least a 50/50 chance that he does something market-tanking before January. He’s throwing everyone under the bus.
Correct. But it almost really ended me. But that little hump is in fact there.
Have you guys read the S-1? You don’t get $10 back... you get $20 back. It’s not the typical $10-SPAC 🤦🏻‍♂️

You're correct.  It sounded like it was an open offer for the seat.

Do you have anymore info on the Hestia/Permit board dispute?  I'm interested to know what their beef was.
Especially when you factor in the insane growth, like 10 years ago Tesla was some project stuffing electric motors in a Lotus. Now they are a global car manufacturer. What will the next 10 years look like?

You see what dave lee posted on youtube about this? Dave lee is probably the biggest pussy in investing. If he had any real conviction or balls he would have 10 million plus from tesla like that dude emmet. I dont understand why anyone follows his advice.

Lol you silly? I’m still gunna send.
Jmia 11/27 15c had 5 traded them that Friday LI dropped 15% wanted the money for a trade so missed JMIA run to 35$ last week
I wonder if those with massive short positions view this subreddit. I know I’d get nervous the amount of dumb money that could go into that stock at any moment.
Does anyone else feel desensitized to money? I spent $1,500 on Black Friday buying all sorts of cool shit for my house - enormous TV, expensive appliance, and some other smaller stuff. Then I realized I lost the same amount and made it back last week on random YOLO plays that I barely flinched at.
I dont fuck with options, just stocks mainly...
An army of simple jack lookalikes vs short bois
Safe play yes, I agree it will climb with EC run up. But have a couple of months of dead money and possibly a market turn in there. 

If you have the cash It’s probably a good play. My small account requires me to make money between now and then
I think the opportunity will be for pltr to get more contracts from other governments.

There also needs to be some intangible value with being part of the solution to covid.

NÉE for green new deal
ACB, MJ, APHA for weed to become legal (house ready to pass bill for legalization already)
Im in as well!
Agreed
Sounds super bullish.
My other actual post was on reits in the summer (not PSTH) and made quite a lot on those positions. I let the DD stand for itself though. Do as you wish, as you were.
I mean I’ve been in since the start of the movement in July. Be careful of earnings I suppose. There 10 things in my eyes that could trigger a real short squeeze. I think earnings numbers themselves could disappoint but there’s so many other catalysts. If Ryan Cohen is ever announce as CEO I’d take as much margin as I could and go all in. Looking for the board to announce deal with Ryan or share buyback or strong future guidance. Even if it pulls back after earnings I’d buy the dip.
And how far back was that?
Dude you know that guy that was sitting next to you trying to make small talk the entire time and was leaning in closer and closer as you were drinking more and more?

Just found out I’m $48 in arrears on $6k a month child support. I’m being charged for maintenance wtf is maintenance!!???

I got one share in March for free thanks to opening my RH account
Count me in for 2,840 at about $12.5 avg
Covid was fully priced in in March. At this point, the market is acclimated to it and will not experience any dramatic swings unless dramatically different information comes up. I.e. it evolves to kill all ages of people at much higher rates or those that have recovered all develop cancer after a year or something. At this point those kind of outcomes are very much outliers and with a variety of vaccines right around the corner, JPow continuing to pursue aggressive monetary policy, and many stocks positioned to be successful regardless of COVID, we're looking very strong in the near term.
I’m never living with any woman lmao
Look up delta hedging. Also if you really want to apply upward pressure on the shares you would enter synthetic long position - the math works out to being long 100 shares. To enter synthetic long simultaneously buy the atm call and sell the atm put. You can do this at other strikes too but atm is like buying 100 shares.

Fair enough. But don't you agree this play is retarded?
PLTR is going to retrace quite a bit after its eye ripping rally. Name one company ever that hasn’t.
[Here you go mate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3dw44/citron_vs_wallstreetbets_the_movie/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
I like the premise of influencing a short squeeze, but it's, in theory anyways, easier than you lay out.  So, time to go back to your studies...  Buying calls forces the market makers (those guys who sell you the calls) to buy some stock.
I'm in on both but Nio has more short term and tangible catalysts, including November deliveries next week, Nio Day, EE7 w/ next gen FSD tech, 150Kwh battery (something like 600mi range...insane), accelerated rollout of new V2 battery swap stations - many of the latter expected to get announced at Nio Day.

Beyond this, December deliveries will be first full month running at 2x shift output (Nov about 1/2 to 2/3).

The institutional backing on this company is no joke.  The biggest players have serious serious money invested in Nio.  This is why there is so much support on EV correction days and even from the Citron report.

Yes thus House vote on stricter accounting rules could cause a bit of volatility for a day or two, but the companies have 3 years to comply.  I don't think it will be a big event.  This potential new rule has been known for 3months or more already.

Edit: from another post I made:

Nio only became a real meme stock in the last month.  Look at who invested in them from the get go...Baillie and Gifford was #1 Tesla holder for 10 years and now #1 Nio holder, Renaissance technologies, state street, Bridgewater Associates, etc etc etc.  There is a reason for this - Nio has an outlook unlike most other companies....there is room for serious upside even at today's valuation.

Baillie and Gifford put a $300bn 10Y valuation on Nio...when the price was $8.

FOR CANADIANS HERE: yolo gains in a TFSA are not taxable so if you were to do your short term yolo tendies in that, any withdrawls are free and clear.
If you have other longer holds in say a cash or margin trading account subject to cap gains tax, use ETFs or hold your underlying which back up your TFSA tendie rolls, this way you have less active trading in the Cash/Margin accounts and less exposure to potential cap gain hits. Also, maybe buy a few weed stonks to ensure you have a really good loser to sell near year's end to offset cap gains if req'd. :P

I thought you were allowed to ask others to vote? The bot even encourages it when it removes posts. Anyways, I think a permaban is a bit harsh and would ask mods to at least consider reducing it to like a 30 day. But even if not, at least clarify where you can petition others to vote.

They are working out plans with the New Mexico government on how to operate the test flight with the restrictions requirements.  Covid is not going away any time soon and the company recently made a announcement on their Twitter page:

WARRANT EXPLANATION. Put another way, assume you buy 999 shares today at $24 ($24k). You hold through the merger. Suppose the stock post merger trades at $40 (very conservative).

With regard to the initial common shares, you would realize a profit of $15,984 (67% gain)

PLUS (due to the warrant structure)

You would realize the ability to execute 222 warrants at a strike of $23 for a profit of $3774 (74% gain).

The warrants don't expire for 5 years....and $40 target is very conservative. Ackman looking for a 10-15% stake for $5B, meaning the company will have to be worth something in the range of \~$50B. These numbers are fluid atm.

I didn't assume something, you said the following:

If that's not how you actually think about it, you are free to correct that statement!
The next one:
>"Whether or not you care to admit to yourself that people die as a result of lockdowns"<

People die as a result of staying at home and minimizing social interaction? I might need a source on that one.. ;) And if you really think that people die as a result of lockdowns, why would you then "keep the vulnerable in lockdown". Doesn't make that much sense, mate.. EDIT: and if you post sources, don't link to newspaper articles. Instead, only link to scientific papers you find on the arXiv servers.

They can hit hard and fast. As long as you have spread your risk out/ further out calls. They would usually come back. Big gain days though almost certainly require a big loss day. It ain’t easy.

If my thesis is correct, I don’t see why it won’t go above 50s, as Pfizer shows they are capable of manufacturing mRNA vaccines in their facility. Then if approved, this mRNA-based treatment will open lots of new ways to Pfizer and BioNTech. Whereas, not to undermine Moderna’s accomplishment, Moderna is outsourcing its manufacturing, which brings in another third-party risk.

Lol you dick
Gamestop has nothing to do with PLTR and vice versa.  They are not remotely related.  Most of the people saying PLTR has much further to go, don't understand how market caps work. Stock price =/= value of a company.

GME by any reasonable valuation should be trading at around a 2-3 billion market cap at least, which would put them at a stock price of 30-45.  PLTR was considered fair value in the teens, and is double that now with a current market cap of 48 billion.

It is a lot easier to go up in market cap when you're tiny, and insanely undervalued for your cash flow etc.  

Also, GME is in no way similar to blockbuster.  THey were a year or two ago, but no longer.
buy/write - shares/CCs - buy call longer out lower buy back price

Perhaps a split Senate may be beneficial from that perspective.
i like you😂
Man nothing beats the convenience of a dispo tho. The price difference is at most 5 dollars per half ounce. And the quality is leagues better. But it's the convenience that really is better, just walk in and buy. No spending half an hour finding an available dealer, then waiting half an hour for him to show up. I kinda doubt you know what you're talking about considering if I was getting an eighth for 30 dollars cheaper than the dispo, than they'd be paying me 10 bucks to smoke it. No one I know ever uses dealers now that weed is legal here.

Selling puts and buying calls (assuming you’re confident and likely to win) are the way to go. Selling puts on PLTR is an insane amount of cash. I gotta check out CRSR tho. Good luck!
Tryna decide that now. Hold one of my Teslas share or cash out for Apple calls?🤔

What you don’t seem to understand is that investors in SPAC have virtually nothing to lose (if not the opportunity cost of putting the money somewhere else). They can decide to redeem their shares before the de-spac or follow through if they think the acquisition makes sense. They also do it for the warrants. It’s a “free” call option.

When it starts squeezing high I would start selling weekly OTM calls on your shares and if they get called away so be it, if not you collect a fat stack on premiums. Not sure where we go from here but up in the next 2 months

What do you predict will be sold off? The broad market indices?

You believe that this will affect all calls with expiry in early January? (I'm sure that the thousands of WSB readers with PLTR, GME, TSLA, other momentum stock calls will be curious to understand your point of view.)
Yah I’m gonna try something new for sure. I know my previous strategy of throwing money into a fire was not working. I’ll probably go short a with little on QQQ and buy calls on boomer stocks like WMT and BRK.
All depends on the interest rate on the debt. If you can make more in the market for sure. Pay the minimums and your bills but continue to invest. If the rates are insane like more than 7 percent focus on the debt, keep investing a little or build up for a calculated play. If you get a big wad that way play with that and put the rest toward debt.

My instincts were right.

Lots of downvotes means a lot of the retards on here are Uber and Lyft drivers YOLO-ing their tips.
Intraday? Closing price on 11/9 was around $37. So your $40 12/31 call makes you 100% but only if you time it within 1 minute of the top. Otherwise it expires worthless. 

Good play.
Apple was down on the week...
It means you retain the original 9 shares at market price plus an additional 2 warrants with a strike to be exercised at $23.
What type of volume and price correlation signals a buy?
Thanks. The video isn’t smooth but you can tell I started out pretty slow. As the gains came I would add from my savings using simple percents. When the crash came in March though I forced myself to go all in and that’s when I was down and had most of my life savings in it. Scary times
🍆👉🌈🐻👍👌
Liquidated all my baba before the downtrend, luckily. I hope to go back in big when things settle out or by Jan 20th. Until then I’m on the sidelines with all Chyna stonks. Baba fundamentals are too solid to make me feel ok w buying puts though I’m sure as shit that puts w an expiration right after congress recess will pay.

A lot of people are aware of this accident
Vaccine efficacy/EUA will ass blast your calls
Following you doing the same for the good luck!
WSB is a leading indicator of retardation.  I make consistent 20% scalps just following the FOMO on the opening pumps.  You just need to know when to exit.

WSB is a tool, you just need to know how to use it.  Even Cramer is starting to wake up to the power of collective retardation.  

We are currently witnessing a fundamental shift in the markets.  The democratization of the trading process that apps have unlocked, coupled with the slow the erosion of value in bond market, is leading to a new era in growth investing.  

This will continue and accelerate in the near term.  The Fed has bent itself over a barrel, and literally can’t raise interest rates at the risk of tanking the markets, and the countries collective retirement accounts.  We’re going to see money continue to pour into the equities markets at unprecedented rates.  The long term implications of this process are troubling, but the short term opportunities are massive.  

I think WSB, on some level, understands this.  There is a deeper meaning to “stonks only go ⬆️🚀” than may immediately be evident.
Getting cucked by a bum lmao, this is a fake ass post
That may be true, but I’m not in because he said it’s stripe. Lol I got in well before I found the handle

You can make fun of TA but support and resistance are real. Tons of people can tell you beforehand what levels the market will bounce off and give initial resistance before it breakout/breakdown from that level.
There is hardly any hype about this company, hardly anyone talks about it outside the SPCE and Virgin Galactic Reddit pages
Don't sweat it, when you turn 16 get a part time job to get that 1k back.
Not gonna sugar coat this one. You’re fuk.
I think I found my play for tomorrow. Going to write a couple of 12/18 CRSR 40p. Premium collected would be about 6.25 at current price so worst case scenario is you own shares at 33.75 and just sell calls. I expect a bounce on this baby going into holidays.

Isnt it 20$ per share you would get back for this particular SPAC?
Dealers hedge their short calls with long shares. Call buying puts upward pressure on the share price just as buying shares does. Depending on the strike, calls might have more of an effect, dollar for dollar.
GME was right at yearly support. Its all time low was in 2003 at 2.52 a share. It hit 2.57 a share this year and traded near all time lows for almost a year(aka it finally found support that it had not found for overall decade). When stocks find support like that people start buying because the knife catch finally seems to be over.   If anything this was a pretty standard play.
maybe stop betting all in on 0dte because you WILL lose all of your money eventuallly, regardless of ticker?
so dude wait ,, you made money on that 5k with 1000% right? how much 1k % of 5k, you fucking expect me to use my calc now, fu.. and leave that gf asap.
Okay but how much did you shot your pants when it dipped that hard on the chart
Did the waves happen unexpectedly or in small trickles? About to go balls deep in options starting from December.
[removed]
I did get margin called during that pre election day dip, but I ignored it. NIO had been steadily going up all of October and was keeping my account afloat, and then everything bounced hard in Nov.
[removed]
That’s what I did back when I actually had a strategy. I played KGC and WMT. But I got caught up chasing those 1000% gains. 

Once you hit a couple of those and turn 1k into 10k+ a couple times it’s hard to go back.  It I took a break and I think I’m good now.
Call options that you can exercise work well too. They tie up shares.

He will probably have his brain scanned and uploaded
I only come to this sub to see the gains and fantasize about if my broke ass was brave enough to jump in with my savings and get gains like this, I would still only have like $5000.

Well I care cause they banned my friend permanently cause he mentioned a $2B market cap company once in a comment about how next week people would be playing Airbnb instead (ie he wasn’t even pumping it) while they allow GameStop to be pumped for months under $1 billion market cap which they claim is the limit (up from $100M cause they keep raising it with little notice)
Can attest to this. Your mind is sharper and you flow through decisions faster when you keep the seed. I only had the balls to throw big money at options after I stopped watching porn. Makes you a subconscious cuck watching other dudes fuck chics.
Okay bro, chill
FSR has been bankrupt before too
Nahhh tbh I kinda want to buy more nio calls cause they still printing. I have a few longer calls for pltr though that I will diamond han.. no.. Netherite Hand.

Idk wtf I was thinking
The video isn’t smooth so it’s hard to see but I did take a hit. I was at 70k in March building off of 3 months of gains and lost 50% in one week. I almost called it quits right there.
If opec extends cuts then green Monday I think. If not then sideways until vaccine starts rolling out I guess.
Ticker
Except Bill said that during the investors meeting they had no intentions of straying from their original plan of announcing the merge no later than 6 months from the funds formation, which puts the deadline at Jan 22 by the latest but I’m optimistic we’re getting the announcement sooner rather than later

Guys mimosas are pretty strong no joke might get kicked out of here pretty soon
She's not bad.  Her tits are a bit too much tbh.
Why would you do this? NIO is blowing the fuck up and you’re going to bet 90K that it drops more than 20% in 3 weeks? TSLA’s pre-inclusion run alone will likely be enough to keep NIO pumping thru to 2021. Then you have NIO day. Honestly wtf were you thinking? You really can’t find a better use for 90K in this market?
If you do buy puts, I recommend focussing on one sector and buying calls in another, that way you can potentially be profiting on both green and red days
Not sure why is anyone else getting comments removed? Have been posting high quality stuff for years now and there’s a new bot now I guess?
When is AAPL Earnings report?
Made a bunch on PLTR. Lost like 75% of it betting hard on 0dte calls friday. Still have some shares, and a few weeklies. Cash out and go all in GME, or close some other positions for GME and give PLTR a chance to recover?

Edit: my other positions are GE LEAPs, and a few penny stocks waiting for big news.
I have 2k in 50/55c for 1/15
Not saying there's not some substance to OP's point but it feels pretty evangelical without factoring in some duds.
I mean, the general went blue. It’s not that far fetched the runoff could as well.
puts are 🌈
I guess the wildcard here is if the agreement has already been made. Ackman sells Stripe on these huge/stable shareholders that came on long before this $100B article came out. Maybe the valuation at agreement is somewhere between the 35 and 100b.

Either way I like it and own it but just don’t see quite as much upside of they are still negotiating at this new valuation.
$29 puts still holding.

It amazes me that ppl still consider Tesla as a car company. How ignorant and retarded they are. I think they are the same group of ppl who thought Amazon is just an online book store. In short: fuck them and buy TSLA
Idk about all that
Silicone composite materials are very promising due to their higher specific capacity. However, the anode is just a small part of the battery pack, so don't expect more than a 10% increased range for the whole EV
I liquidated chucks of my positions to go into GME during the run up to 11 and it’s paid off. Still has lots of room to run.
If you actually typed the ticker it was banned.

The million is just for basic.
Bill Ackman is a lot of things and admittedly has had an interesting course. Most importantly he has a strong recent track record, makes money for his investors and is persuading people like Seth Klarman and Guggenheim to take stock (and yes, those tasty 2/9 (???3/9???) warrants that are unlike anything we have seen in SPAC land).
The evidence is already there. This is the second time the same pattern showed across all EVs. Look at last week Wednesday's after hour drop. NKLA fell, and a few minutes later the other EVs tanked too.
my bear ears perked up, why u think so
Stop targeting indexs on puts.

did you do your dd? you spelled the company name wrong
Dude hasn’t made a public appearance in weeks.
I wouldn't be buying the 12/4s. The ER could be a bazooka to the shorts' sphincter, or could be a dip. But big money is still accumulating, so don't get shaken if we dip after 12/8, it will be rapidly bid up.
[deleted]
Start with an email, the rest will be automated
No projection but they set themselves up to beat. They real magic will be in the guidance. Hopefully MSFT deal will get explained and really hope a SNE deal is announced. If they announce a good strategic plan it will go up.

Plus I wouldn’t say P/E ratio of 24 to be high.
Sure it is. Have PLTR calls at every broker.  RH, Fidelity, Schwab, Webull.  All kinds of broker diversification.
Wait so you managed to pull off these kind of gains with just SHARES??? Wtf man I'm even more impressed now
I thought that the last couple months...you don’t wanna make that mistake trust me
I'm starting to shed tsla off my portfolio to rotate into GME. Will get back in if it dips, but wouldn't mind missing out a bit if that means i can lock my gains.
So I should sell my 12/4 calls s soon as they are green and get more shares.
I already half my portfolio in GME shares, might as well get more.
Watched the whole thing. Better than original movie 👍

They didn't even touch 40 when news broke of their vaccine being 90% effective. AND they were the first of the vaccine announcements and their anniuncrnt sent the whole market up bigly and sent many recovery/oil stocks up 20-30% in a day. 

If it didn't hit 40 then why would it now when they have the worst vaccine logistically?

Based on their first vaccine announcement it seems obvious you should play recovery/oil stocks for their vaccine approval.
roblox ipo?
42k shares at $7 no big deal.
Makes you feel any better micheal burry bought a crap ton GameStop shared
Just PayPal me the money instead
Yea I understand, I was more asking for personal speculation. Obviously we can’t anticipate the moves of millions of short sellers, just looking for an exit point
Anyone notice GameStop was below $1 billion market cap for months but was allowed here while they banned people mentioning the other small companies (including some with a larger market cap)?
I live in HK. Thanks for the plane ticket retard. Lol.
Still much harder to produce. Moderna's vaccine can also be kept at Fridge temps for a week. Send it to pharmacies in freezerboxes, they can store backstock in a freezer and put what they'll use in a fridge each week. NVAX is in huge trouble if they have less efficacy.
Pltr - its going to be a wild week but with vaccines starting to be shipped via united airlines and needing to be distributed quickly and effectively this will be pltrs time to shine.

Its healthy to buy puts when an irrational uptick happens, I bought some FB puts when it jumped from 260s to 290s a month ago, paid off well, you just have to pick your spots, BA is another good one, once it hits $220 tends to trend down, but overall, I think buying calls on dips is the way
Ban. I'm so sick of seeing this title.
I’d love to say it won’t make sense to buy a ton of calls on PLTR this week, I’d love to say that, but it does.

Bet the house, bet the kids, bet the wife. This market makes no sense but I like money 🤑
My broker has a fee of 3USD per option. Doing iron condors and spreads would kill any gains in fees.

Where do people trade options?
Good job bud make sure you don't let her drag you down
You're absolutely right. All I'm saying is that when everybody is qualified, how do you set yourself apart?

Also it kinda does sound like you need more life experience, no offense. Either way good luck out there stud
My puts hope for a crash. But I made a lot on the ride up and am prepared to buy back in so I’m good either way.

You're 50% correct.
That's a penis rubbing your prostate.
This would be a scratch off type play for me. Not holding a position for more than a week. Any share price moves more than 10% or if I see 50% profit on a call I'm GTFO.
Weedstocks had the tilray 300 bubble and pop mark the peak for the sector, then after a normal pullback from that level of intense hype APHA got hit by a short report from Hindinburg that was pretty damning at the time, putting pressure on the entire sector too from association. Both in combination brought APHA from 22.00 CAD to 4.00ish CAD in something like 2 months or so. I may still have ptsd from that, but just saying that the tilray part still worked out for this narrative and the short attack was kind of a black swan.

Yeah, I'm looking at April calls and to collect shares if the price hits \~14 again. I never hold trying to hit these crazy 1000% gains, I'll likely sell with a 50% gain for the options and about 30% for the shares. If it doesn't happen by Christmas, I'll exit anyway.

Thing is, this vaccine has been so far successfully tested on various people from lots of different geographical locations, race, gender, and age. Also, it is going to be most likely first mRNA vaccine in human history. mRNA vaccines theoretically can be developed to be cure against cancer. If mRNA vaccine is approved, Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna all will be pioneers of this biomedical technology, which would most likely be next generation of vaccines and disease treatment. EVs are future of vehicles. E-commerce is future of retail shopping. And mRNA-development will be future of pharmaceuticals.

Market will be parabolic this week, stop buying puts shit doesn’t work and Wall Street loves you shorts for making them money.
I only climax with Himax. Should be 9/10 EOY
bro, I think she creampied all those bulls, she like the Bull Queen.

Or more like the /NQ queen, look at what area she "represents"
My eyes will be peeled on a couple of SPACs as well as GME (WSB has been solely responsible for my interest in GME).
A bad news event will spike VIX, but you can’t forecast bad news. You can forecast uncertainty, however, and it all depends on what’s happening in the markets news cycle.

I don’t expect to see VIX go up 100-600%, but like I said, you can’t forecast it. The Georgia runoff could raise VIX however, but I don’t think it’s going to make gains you want it to.

Also, like you mentioned, it decays over time, so you’re risking losing money if nothing bad happens (and VIX perpetually goes lower as uncertainty and negative news are not in the market)
RE is it only tangible, but actually limited supply. So, no.
I'm curious how in depth a number like that actually goes.  I wouldn't be surprised with the 100k a year averaged out between all the branches, ranks, and locations (housing). 

The million for training seems a a bit steep depending on the job.   Are we factoring in the cost of each piece of equipment like it was new even though some of it won't be? Perhaps the man hours of every single person involved?  I'm just trying to add this up and unfortunately I can't find a modern reference.

Edit* - Not disputing, just find stuff like this interesting.

So your banking on pltr to hit 32c by 12/11 and if it does your in the green? And if it hits 40 you make even more $$? But if the call doesn’t hit on those dates then you lose or sell before it expires? Sry for all the questions, just trying be get a better understanding.

Yea, you’ll be able to sell the contract itself for a profit. Need to sell before expiration date.

Just FYI, it’s better not to buy short term expiration. Sometimes you may have to learn the hard way, but short term is way more volatile and you’re more likely to lose money
“didn’t read any of it but I’m in”......perfectly summed up most investing in 2020
No, they usually have a market cap of around 1bn so that doesn't make them penny stocks but things like FCEL, ACB, AMC, HTZ etc. 
Just one double up away from making a million though so I feel like its possible. Buy and hold the portfolio I originally started with would've outperformed my strategy by 5x though lol
You realize when you buy a call you're feeding demand for other people to buy shares to sell the calls right?

Puts are really not a good play atm, the world is ready for 😴 /Harris, there will be an additional bump when 🥭 concedes, also vaccines coming out soon, too much general optimism

I understand. The fact he said am I accounting for paying taxes is why I said that. And no I didn’t sell being down in a company then buy right back into it. Not how I play
pre-markets have recently been very interesting. For several hours on friday, PSTH was up 9%. Settled back down at the open and closed up 3%. I expect that as things have been brewing on twitter and reddit since friday that we could see a big open tmr in the +\~10-15% range.
A few stops actually. Hurry though.
Oh yes, a private accountant would probably be best just like a private investigator will get you further than the local, lazy police department lol. If you made enough gains to feel the need to see an account you shouldn't cheap out imo! Thanks for the advice, internet stranger :)

Lmao definitely not a millionaire but my favourite is APHA simply for the fact that they have 6 consecutive quarters of profitability and didn't have all the drama that ACB did (remember when their directors sold fake properties to themselves at inflated prices and acted as middlemen to their own deal only to have huge goodwill impairments and leave shareholders bag holding)
Bipartisan watchdog audit requirements could be a serious blow. Congress goes home til EOY in 2 weeks. Definitely going to be discussed, rumors will hit BABA EDU JD etc.

The valuation isn’t too big of a deal imo. Instead of taking a 10% stake PSTH would take a 6 or 7% one.  If Stripe we’re to take the deal it would most likely be for a quick capital raise and ease of being listed as a public company post merger.

Be careful when shorting companies when lock-up periods expire. I am an engineer in SV who have many friends who work in companies like ZEN, TWLO, ADBE. My own company stock has grown considerably during COVID, and I don't plan on selling a single share, because I don't need the money, and my company is a very strong company where shares will go up.

If it's a shit company, go ahead and short. But don't go and short good companies just because a lock up period is expiring. Most employees who work at good companies tend to have money too, and don't necessarily need to sell the stocks, unless they think the stock will burn and they are trying to exit.
CNBC and mainstream press are saying nothing about PSTH or potential Stripe merger. Last the MSM has said was basically months ago. Once this gains steam, Stripe or not, once the TONTINE is realized and the positions by Klarman and Guggenheim revealed this is going to pop. If the speculation is true, and Buffet is in on this, the sky truly is the limit, Stripe or not.
TSLA P/E of 1034x too low imo 😌
Yeah I agree. Calls are still pretty cheap. And we have lots of upside on upcoming catalysts. Best of luck to you mate. May we both get ten\twenty baggers.
You're an idiot.

I did the same thing. I dated an unknown to me lesbian tomboy military cadet for a few weeks. She left me after we slept together for the first time for that exact reason.
There’s always futures
Months ago management said Q3 earnings will be bad. Avg estimated EPS is -.85

The market knows it will be bad and has probably priced that in already. Investors will be looking forward towards Q4 since that is what truly matters at this point.

Management will be forced to make Q3 sound as bullish as fucking possible otherwise Ryan Cohen will come in and destroy them publicly. Numbers will be bad, the call will be bullish.

I have seen a model where GME does breakeven on Q3, so that would be a major surprise and super bullish as well.
Put 10k in NIO shares a while back and now it's valued at 40k.

Tell me why I shouldn't sell it all and put it in GME? I've got diamond hands

Market hates the 2T valuation on this. It just will not go up. May be a good earnings play (take advantage of the pre earnings run up and IV boost) but seriously wouldn’t hold through. 

That’s a few months away though so would have to diamond hand that shit for a while to make money.

Sorry if noob question, but:  

>On 12/31 if you still hold the option, there are a few possibilities:  
>  
>$MSFT  is above the breakeven, we'll say $240.0, you can sell the option for a  profit, which would be almost entirely intrinsic value, the contract  would be worth around $10.00 ($240.0 - $230.0 = $10.00).  This is per  share! So your profit would be: ($10.00 x 100) - ($167.0) = $833.  The  $167.0 is the debit paid for the contract.

Wouldn't the option expire and be unusable on that date? Thanks

just not calculable cuz he took out more money than he put in, so his initial balance is negative. when you add or take out money for robinhood it treats it as if it was added or taken out from the very beginning you set up your account

This has been done several time. At least signed, brought in for training camp and released. Just because they are fast doesn’t mean they can catch or take a hit. 

I can’t remember who the cowboys brought in several years ago but I know he was a popular runner. Felt like a publicity stunt.
No he’s making a very valid point.
What did the filter update do?
I don’t believe in the weed stock when there are still home grown drug dealers competing with states that are legalized and are making it hard for dispensaries to thrive you can get an Eighth of weed 30 dollars cheaper through your 3rd party drug dealer rather than a dispensary with high state taxes
Fair enough but imo ACB is trash
Yes of course. But it means they’re behind the stage of what Ackman is looking at. If you asked me do they ipo by end of next year, sure decent chance

Likewise with GME. IV crush is going to kill people on December 9th

Stop saying "didn't care about poor people". It's some kind of defensive thing where you're minimizing something important. Don't dismiss it because you missed it (that rhymes). Instead just go volunteer. If you can relate to people you don't like then you will sure as hell to be able to relate better to your next interviewer. 

It's almost like volunteering actually DOES make you a more well rounded person. Cray.
Infinity squeeze. As old shorts are BTFO, new ones take their place. It's like industrialized mass slaughter of bears.

gonna pull back some more, wait for a day or two or three, even.  Then buy the dip...As many have said, it will be $75 in a year, but wait for a better entry point.
Couple of weeks back I had about a dozen contracts of TSLA when it was around $500. I had things to do and was afraid of get fucked if it dropped so I sold with modest profits at about 11am. Drove to do my errands etc. Arrived, check my cell and it had risen to $591. I did the math and had missed out on about $40,000. Never occurred to me to slap a trailing stop on them instead of selling. Sigh.
Turnover on this sub is insane nobody even knows what $MU $90 means.

I’ve got oil stock calls soooooo
You're telling these guys to write covered calls when the only reason they are buying is for a short squeeze... That is a bit counter intuitive.
what stops the big hedge funds from continuing to short every stock out there and never allowing for a short squeeze to happen? its not like they will ever run out of cash
This is very useful. Thank you!

I told myself I wouldn't touch PLTR but having been in a toxic relationship myself, I will throw 10k on 12/4 calls for you. Godspeed, retard.

Long term capital gains > Short term capital gains.

Some are up big from $20 and some just got in at $25 but they’re all trying to hype it being Airbnb and Stripe despite all evidence to the contrary
Yea, it’s the amount of shares unrestricted from sell. We need a price target or institutional lockup to send it flying.
Coulda bought myself an actual tesla or two with that. Fuck.
Okay so I'm watching football and it hits me, why doesn't a team sign one of those sprinters like bolt, keep him wide and force them to play corners and safetys 20 yards down field and then keep throwing 10-15 passes in the middle forever. If they try to play right you throw to the sprinter?
Good play if you expect a 2% asap but other than that just buy some shares apple as become a slow mover

Share your trading ideas at least.
Lets hope its a full on war, and not one of those posturing wars we had last year, where Iran said they were sorry.
That is exactly what I had setup, then I will open / close cover calls.
Nothing will pass
Good job OP, you won against the market. But don’t forget you can lose it all if you’re not careful. If you’re not going to take it all out, at least diversify. Enjoy the tendies my dude.

Is this a question
There is no way you can justify NKLA of all stocks to be a market leader
He literally put 40 arrows on each channel guessing future moves. 

Proper channel TA involves the next possible move then you re-evaluate. Not next possible move then the next 45 moves.
Yeah and my first investment before wsb was SPCE from 22 to 41 u want a cookie
lol just buy shares...
Maybe if you went full vagabond you could retire on 40k in the US
No they’re not trying to disrupt the IPO industry. They are disrupting the payments industry. That’s like saying they wouldn’t raise VC cash when they’ve done it like a half dozen times.

Not sure how we get so many uninformed posts pumping this idea. No one wants to admit they bought based on a false rumor I guess
He’s right retard
So the comment level on this sub is a lagging indicator.

So what does take profit means? Cashing out?

float % are the foamy bubbles on top
Also they put months/days in the wrong spot.  I understand they go from smallest increment to largest. That makes sense for counting the actual money/value. For dates it is really stupid. Stating the month first gives you more information faster as it eliminates 11/12 of the possible dates and you usually know what year is being referred to. Stating the day first tells you nothing. Could be this month of 11 months from now.
My reasoning exactly. If this stock moves to 45-50, these calls with be worth 2000%
Get a life boomer
We need more of you retard on board. And for you dorks that won’t do shares, looks at the damn IV, buy 20 shares and put a high limit sell on them, like 100$ to prevent them from being borrowed (this is important to do dummies!!!!!!)

Then for every 20 shares do 1-2 calls out in Jan/Apr for whatever strike gets your jimmies/jillies off

I’m not doing the DD with others already posting plenty

TL;DR look at my GME YOLO starting last month (whole retirement funds) 12.5k shares & about 150 calls from Dec $20 - Apr $30

Called to try to get $50-75 in Apr strikes and the fucks wouldn’t do it
Guess who's getting reported again

It is not infrastructure. A head in engineering is the primary factor. Their manufacturing process is beyond any others.  They still have fit and finish issues.  They are operating like a tech company instead of autocompany and continually implementing updates instead of wait the next model year.

I’m SOLD on ETSY. Aside from ecom being the future, they’re gonna rake in $$$ this holiday season and I actually think they’ll steal some share from AMZN. Not that much, but enough to make people think. Also - they’re spending their marketing $$ right. Digital and TV during football. Genius.

As for the former not a chance it makes it through the senate.
Tbh I don’t think a 10% stake would be reasonable. Even 5% would be a hefty goal. I’d be happy with 2-3% personally
Or later, because you need a catalyst for the squeeze, if you intend to play it. You need something to spook the shorts such as better than expected earnings. your calls expire before a potential catalyst and you will be out before the squeeze. 

normally holding through earnings would kill your premium due to IV crush, but if squeeze pops after earnings it’s a moot point.

Did mods actually mod or has the palantir hype actually died down?
Biggest moves were option calls for DKNG ( when it was still DEAC) NKLA calls when it was still (Vtiq) and now Gme calls and shares. I’ve been in and out of a lot and found spac warrants to be a good middleman of risk between options and shares. Longer hold times though.

Income very much has to do with your chances of being audited. It also depends on other factors of course, such as if you are are filing schedule c or e, etc. Also if you fail to report income that is automatically sent to the irs too like w2s or 1099K or misc, etc. For small potato ppl auto billings might be issued to to cover obvious misfeporting but not a full blown audit.

Each agency has different thresholds, but i guarantee you there is threshold because there is a cost associated to sending an auditor out to investigate. They dont just audit ppl at random lol.

Vale had some hype to it. The stock was around 11.50, before you know it it dropped down to 10.50 and wouldn't see 11.50 for another 2 months. Now it's worth almost 15. But that's a long time to hold especially after being down 15% for so long

Indeed, I've seen SPACs where the "public" portion is anywhere from 6%-18%. Once you look at the public portion and market cap against the proposed valuation you realized most these SPACs are way overcooked - IPOB at $13.8 billion vs $4.5 billion valuation, etc.

 Like which? Most of them will crash eventually, but you have like a 1 week window to buy while they keep going up. None of them get the hype like NIO/PLTR if they don't have a long streak of uptrends and 10%+ days. Look at PRPL. It did crash, after nearly doubing in a week.

How many years you looking at? I dont see it.
People are flush with cash and looking for places to put it. Rent might go down as people work from home and move to more affordable areas, but real estate in desirable areas will always be hot.
ACB makes me more nervous as a long term asset - it’s been a pump and dump target in last - but it got pumped good Friday and likely will again this week, so if you’re only looking short term profit, probably a workable play. VFF is also on an absolute tear. I bought 30 measly shares a couple weeks ago at $6.5 and could kick myself seeing it sitting in my stock list at $10.7 now and not having more.
Disagree
Noone will be able to tell you that
If they had closed the deal a month ago it would be a great deal. But instead of buying 20% of a 35B company they now would be buying less than 10% of a $100B company. A lot more room for a $35b company to grow vs a $100b...

been through Citron's annoying random bashes for INO, NIO and Palantir but INO earned me 15k (300%), NIO now's +6k (+180%) and Palantir i bought at $10/$10.40 at IPO, now +300% 🙃 i also own AMD, NVDA and shopify which he bashed 1-2 years ago :))) moral of the story, buy whatever citron insults

>More people buying = stonks go up.

You seem to have made to leap that just because more shares are available to be sold means more people will want to buy them.  That's not how this works.

If there are 100 shares out there and 150 people want to buy them, that would exert upward pressure on the price.

But if suddenly there are 200 shares listed for sale instead of 100, the price will drop, because there's plenty for everyone.

Trevor knows exactly the shit show NKLA is, as do the other insiders.  They will be getting the fuck out with whatever they can while they still can.
the play is the “squeeze” and if it happens, share prices may exceed $100, and if it is as explosive as lesser squeezes, $1000 may occur. the idea is to just get in as cheap a possible
why?
I think you'd better buy real estate ( land ) somewhere, somehow quick. The Great Reset is here and you will either have assets working for you or you'll have nothing and be forced to love it.

Nio only became a real meme stock in the last month.  Look at who invested in them from the get go...Baillie and Gifford was #1 Tesla holder for 10 years and now #1 Nio holder, Renaissance technologies, state street, Bridgewater Associates, etc etc etc.  There is a reason for this - Nio has an outlook unlike most other companies....there is room for serious upside even at today's valuation.

Baillie and Gifford put a $300bn 10Y valuation on Nio...when the price was $8.

Ok then, a serious question: how do i track mention volumes in this sub ?
Maybe?  I sold some of my ETFs that were up 25% to double down on GME, but I didn't see the ETFs as part of my 'serious' portfolio as they were in themselves bets and don't pay a dividend.  I can afford to lose my GME position with a shrug of the shoulders so it's really about your comfort level.  

The real speculative position for GME is NOT whether GME has a short squeeze (this is icing on the cake), the speculation is whether it will go bankrupt or not.  I don't see it going bankrupt.
Do you know if there is anticipation they beat their projections? Or for fall short?

MB thought you were talking about your account specifically, some spacs don’t have options because there’s not enough volume or enough shares available to meet the requirements to have an options chain

>your take home salary will be (after taxes, 401k, health ins) and subtract your expenses. Say roughly that will be $50k. Devided by 12 is 4100 a month.  Say you live pretty frugally you spend $1500 a month on expenses, so you have about $3000 left over. I would put $1000-1500 in loan payments, $500 in investments, and $1000 in building up a emergency fun (should have about 6mo sal

22 is a good place to start with that salary. I was in school (medicine) up until I was 28, basically starting off with a huge amount of debt and not making an income. I went through residency making a little less than you're making. Now I'm making some big bucks, but still have a lot of debt to take care of. Goal is to get my first million by age of 40.

Set some long term financial goals for yourself (million by 40, retire by 50, etc). and calculate what its going to take to get there. Keep those goals as much as you can. The left over cash is your play money. Throw a few hundred at options lottery tickets. Debt is the killer. Stay out of debt as much as you can (dont carry a CC balance, avoid purchases on credit.) Take a trip once in a while, treat yourself hear and there, don't kill yourself trying to save, but just keep to the strategy.
You’re my bros, gotta keep you posted.
>they just chose -80 randomly

In molecular biology labs you have two types of freezers: -20 for the stuff you want to keep safe and -80 for the stuff you really really really want to keep safe. Every lab has a -80 for their cell line plasmids and stuff.
Mini mills are fine for construction materials but recycled metals have to many residual elements to make the proper steel grades required for high-end steel. They are getting closer, but will never fully take the high end steel market.

The Chinese have literally overtaken the market for Blast Furnace steel which is partly why all these mills are idle in the US. They make at lower cost because of cheaper labour and greater access to an abundance of iron ore and coke. The US has an advantage in recycling scrap metal because of aging infrastructure and a big turnaround in scrap volume.

GME bros, buying shares is a good idea but you need to *hedge* properly. I know most of you are new and have probably been trading for 2 weeks so don't let a play blow up in your face because you thought it was a sure thing.

Buy yourself 100 shares at a time and for each 100 shares, get yourself a put, preferably at the money. Weeklies are relatively cheap. If the stock goes up, you win, but if it goes down you are protected. Also, you can sell covered calls against your shares which will protect you even more from downward movement AND if the stock trades flat

They have a massive manufacturing facility outside of Boston which can handle the Western hemisphere. They are also partnering with Lonza in Switzerland which can handle a huge amount of manufacturing for the Eastern hemisphere. Manufacturing is cell-free so there is a lot less that can go wrong compared to something like the Novavax vaccine which requires in vivo synthesis if the protein.

If they have trouble meeting demand, they could contract out to any number or contract GMP facilities. I don't see that being an issue. They've been preparing for this for months.
Tesla is a great example of this. Ppl complaining how flat it was for weeks with IV low as hell.

Eh, like I said I have not read into detail on Novavax's offering in particular and I am not an immunologist by training, but I am a PhD with focus in nanoparticle systems, immunotherapy, and rna delivery and I work in the pharmaceutical area in formulation development. I don't read any message boards, I'm just going off my textbooks and the recent literature and my own research expertise.

See the keyword here is "adjuvant". You need an adjuvant (KLH, alumina, whatever) to get a traditional vaccine to work because you will not appropriately activate the APCs by just going in with the target antigen. The adjuvant stimulates the appropriate PRR and this will help load (an) antigen onto the MHC. Because the adjuvant is doing the stimulating, most of the presented antigens actually come from the adjuvant itself. So yes, you of course develop an immune response against the adjuvant that's literally its job. (Please see this reference: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02874/full which actually talks about the Saponin-based adjuvant system that Novavax uses and how it activates a certain pathway). This is the issue, because your B cells are going to generate type specific antibodies against what is loaded, in concert with other environmental cues. Most vaccines result in a significant IgM and IgE ... which is fine for complement, but not the best for pathogen response (I believe those would be considered "neutralizing antibodies" also). Specifically, IgG antibodies are superior for the maturation of CD8+ T-Cells as a pathogen appears, and recruitment of other professional pathogen response cells. So not all "NAb" (stupid term, but ok) are created equal. Anecdote, but from the few vaccine conferences I have attended, just getting your body to recognize the correct epitope with a traditional vaccine is still a huge challenge.

While you are correct that the NVAX might be morphologically similar, the mode of infection is not. SARS-CoV-2 is a ssRNA virus. It is literally mRNA. The process by which the infection progresses is by translation of the mRNA. The Moderna and Pfizer candidates, by proceeding through this pathway, therefore more accurately simulate the act of viral infection. And actually, I would hypothesize that this "RNA infection" is presumably activating the same immune pathways (innate anti-viral response from professional APCs like the well known dsDNA / dsRNA / TLR3 responses) as a real coronavirus infection, which would generate the right cocktail of signals for the development of a robust innate anti-viral response.

Lastly, I don't know the sequence of the spike protein, but let's say there's a glycine in the center and through a single nucleotide mutation, this glycine gets converted to a cysteine. At this point, NVAX needs to go back and assess the redox state of the peptide, then change their expression system, re-scale up their expression process, re-formulate their peptide, and then distribute. Now what if an Ile turns into an Arg? That's going to change the pI, the logP, the conjugation chemistry is going to be all messed up - again requiring a complete redesign from step 1. All Moderna has to do, in either case, is synthesize a new template to account for the 1 base change (roughly 2-3 days work), and then re-do their IVT using the exact same conditions - no change to formulation or to their manufacturing process. So NVAX spends $1B and 6 months adapting, and Moderna spent maybe 2 days and ~$0. The only sticking point is whether the FDA would consider a sequence change as a new "drug product" requiring a new review process. In the case of NVAX it is definitely a new drug product since the formulation and stability have definitely changed. In the case of Moderna, I think they have a good argument that it is not a different drug product.

The best way to get on track is to just fucking do it. Don't put the effort of completely overhauling your life in front of working out. Just go for a fucking jog. Do some pushups before bed. Same with your diet. Go buy some chicken breasts, cook a bunch, and make extra to eat throughout the week.

I miss going to Vegas so much.  Stumbled upon craps a few years back, I had always just played cards. I was walking the casino floor and it just looked like a great time, everyone cheering and rooting together.  I stood next to the dealer?? And he explained the game to me real quick. I ended up playing fpr hours and made a nice chunk.
This is the way. Plus PLTR calls and AAPL calls
If this thing can go up 5-20x+ what's the point of risking money on options? So you can make 100x? Because if it doesn't you can still hold the shares and possibly even not lose while your options, even deep on the money, can/will lose value.

I started to decrease my expenses, almost near drastically. I reframe from sending capital on unnecessary expenses ( I do not eat out or spend too much on entertainment ). As I was doing that, I started to focus on ways to increase my income (outside of just my job) through freelance work. I spend each Sunday mapping out my week, budget, ect..
I’m flipping other short term options right now with a goal of buying in huge for the long run once I’ve grown my portfolio.

and my point is that your argument is insane.

Here's a different argument. They lost 200 million dollars so far in 2020. They have approximately 350$ million in shareholder equity (assets - liabilities). Q3+Q4 will likely breakeven. They'll go bankrupt soon as they burn 200 million dollars / year for the foreseeable future.

Sometimes, egocentric pricks (that were obviously hugged too much by their mothers) wander into our sub looking for participation trophies simply for shitting out asinine questions.

Some of them actually believe they have the *right* to shit up 1.6 million people's feeds with their drivel.  Those people are the most discourteous and often have a hard time realising they're the offender.

But, please, go on.
Im seeing alot of this,

"Dont buy apple/amzn bro i bought leaps on sept 2 and im down 50%"

"Apple is a boomer stock brah"

"Bro apple has been flat since september lol"

Thats when you buy leaps.  When the iv is low. Not after a huge run up all through summer.  Weve been consolidating a huge move up for 3 months. 

Those same people probably bought Palantir leaps on wednesday
Depending on when the lease ends I'd offer different advice.

step 1. grow a spine.

With anything less than 3 months on the lease I'd find a new place. Rent it and move all my shit there. You can't kick her out and....

As soon as you break-up with her shes going to be slinging her pussy all over the apartment to find a new sucker. She'll probably tell you all about it when you get home from work. Might also spill the beans on all the cock she rode while you were at work while dating. I've known ppl who cohabitate after breakups and its always horrible.

Your financial situation might be better, but the home life is gonna get real bumpy. Ideally find a way to minimize time spent in a bad situation even if it costs a few k.

10 years ago I broke-up with my crazy gf. I moved out of our place while she was at work, paid the 3 remaining months on the lease to our landlord. Never saw that bitch again. Best $$$ I ever spent.
I mean I don't even think we're that "good" at it, it's just that the volume of posters means that every irregular movement on random tickers gets some kind of coverage, but separating the wheat from the chaff is still quite difficult. This place is like a free UnusualWhales, but way harder to sift through and slightly lagged behind.

In and of itself that's an interesting observation I suppose, but it causes a lot of unnecessarily masturbatory comments on the level of Rick and Morty superfans.

Agreed. Last time I played I had a big streak of luck. Walked up with $100. I tossed the dealers my $30 for a high, low, yo bet. Chips landed after dice were rolled so it didnt count. It ended up being a losing bet anyways. Next roll, with my chips now in play, landed at 11. 15:1 gain.  Super stoked. Didn't realize that the bet stays in play until a losing roll. Next roll was a 2. Up $700. Walked away from the table
love to get a little too heated on come bets, it’s the most fun you can have gambling
I'll just throw out a name here: Impossible Foods. Everyone thought the FMCI merger was going to be with Impossible Foods and it ended up being Tattooed Chef--a brand not many people have heard of or care about.

So while there might be "too much evidence," anything can happen and nothing is set in stone until the deal is done. PSTH has gotten and immense amount of hype and that can be a bad thing when they have such hogh expectations to live up to
You already figured it out. Buys calls, make money.
I hope you’re right my bro
You could argue that everything pumped on that news and that anything less than a perfect success might ignite a sell off.
Bought 1 share of AMD @ $10.09 and sold @ $12.14

No that's what people at wsb think wsb is doing but wsb has very little power on these big stocks. Even a smaller stock like pltr has 205m average volume. It would be hard for a bunch of middle class to a few upper class people to move that much capital. Hedgefunds don't even have to releasing any holding information if they trade under 1.5b. Do you think wsb is trading more than hedgefunds?

keep telling yourself that and find out 10 years later youve made 0 principle payments and owe more than you did 10 years ago
Depends on interest rate. Calculate how much your take home salary will be (after taxes, 401k, health ins) and subtract your expenses. Say roughly that will be $50k. Devided by 12 is 4100 a month.  Say you live pretty frugally you spend $1500 a month on expenses, so you have about $3000 left over. I would put $1000-1500 in loan payments, $500 in investments, and $1000 in building up a emergency fun (should have about 6mo salary on hand in case of job loss). You can adjust as much as your expenses change. 

The options trading done on here is like gambling. You shouldn't trade anything you're not willing to lose. Id build up a significant savings position first (25-50k) in long term investments, build up a emergency fund,  then start throwing a few hundred here and there at options.

1. Lose fat. Diet & cardio, small weights.   
2. Add muscle, heavy lifting.   
4. Tone. Trim. Fine tune so you don’t end up like a swollen gorilla (unless you want to).  
    
If you start with heavy lifting before you lose the fat, it will trap some in your muscles and will be MUCH harder to tone afterwards.
Trevor Milton otherwise known as ‘Trustworthy Trevor’ owns 91 million of those 100m that are locked up. Hes the only one who DID NOT vote to extend the lockup until April like the rest of the board members. So yeah. We’ll see if he dumps bigly this week.

Sir, this is a casino.

Don't beg for tips.
Stripe also wouldn’t ever do a tradition IPO. You know, the process that requires a bank underwriter, the exact industry they are trying to disrupt. It’s either DPO or SPAC, and there are tons of advantages using the friendly structure Ackman made
I mean, do investors want to hear revenues or engineer Mumbo jumbo. That’s my take. Simple and sweet.
From what it sounds like in this post do that and also check out r/TheRedPill so this doesn't happen to you ever fucking again brother - stay strong you got this!
Crsr is an excellent long term. I just think it has 2 years of gains already priced in and will probably be stagnant or slowly dropping towards 20s until some news.
Ur about to be broke so just buy food

They have even started their phase 3 trial yet and you’re saying they’re not far behind the others that have already released results from a 45,000 patient phase 3 study?  Wtf by the time they have results everyone will be vaccinated by the 3 or more other vaccines that are 90% effective.  I don’t see how you aren’t acknowledging this

prolly not
Seriously though does anyone want to take a moment to discuss this? I ask over in /r/realestate and they say "oh well if people can't afford a 30 year then banks will just start giving out 50 year or 100 year mortgages!". What is the end game to a real estate market that goes up 3-5% a year with occasional +10% years? The people in power dont care since they own the appreciating asset. Just like they dont care about the cost of college since they have long ago graduated.

I timed the March SPY bottom perfectly with a 20k yolo, I sold too early and only made 25k instead of 150k. I then lost that all because I was new to trading. If I bought leaps in any tech I would be a millionaire.
Any of you ever look at POAHY aka Porsche? supposedly there's an electric Panamera coming soon, it seems like as they convert more of their fleet to electric there's a possibility that they could capture a new demographic of customers and eat up some of Tesla's market share. 

obv a bit of a price difference between the cars but in general it seems like one of the biggest risks to Tesla's valuation is that major car companies will eventually build their EV infrastructure up and push out Elon... which in turn would cause the other companies stock prices to rise... no?

\-Exactly! The stock is up 25% from Nav. And yet the risk is 20% downside from 25-20.

\-The exercise and discussion is calculating the risk from 25. Which is 5 dollars or 20% from the purchase price today. 

\-You are looking at profit, a total different metric and calculation. You stated (I think) you bought at 20 and it is trading at 25. This means you have an unrealized gain of 25%. And a risk of 0

About to buy a bunch of 20 watt USB C bricks and usb c to lightning cables to replace my usb a to lightning stuff. Can't wait for the iPhones to finally switch to USB C making all this usb c to lightning stuff useless again. My charging cord situation is getting out of hand. Environmentally friendly my ass.

Repost from earlier this morning, because a few loser 🌈🐻 used the robot janitor to flag my meme as spam. (They aren’t mods in this channel – instead they’re normal users who know that giving a new post 3+ remove votes is enough to get the "automoderatorbot" to take that post down) 

**If you could click the robot janitor’s “vote to keep post” in the comments, that’d help me out so much in preventing this post from getting removed!**

*Yes, it’s pretty discouraging to have memes taken down because they do take time and effort, no matter how silly or simple they look. I just want to create a few laughs and spread a bit of positivity.* 

So thank you in advance, press the robot janitor’s “vote to keep post”, and I’ll make more memes when I have the chance! Have a great day everybody!

I actually think that's important. I can say I'm a WSBetter transitioning into value positions. I would never pay money to have this pinned. I am totally confident in the sentiments contained in the DD and the quality of PSTH as a position worth holding. The mods likely read the DD and operated appropriately. Whether this is Stripe or not, PSTH is something I would never pass up given its structuring. Anyways, no, bullish on PSTH, hoping for Stripe but not paying for pins.

State school. Don't live it up. Too many go into these field for good money without the stress of having to constantly learn or end up useless in tech.
So your argument is just because people had to pay, other people shouldn’t be freed of the burden because it’s “unfair?” What’s your solution then? Retroactive reimbursement for every single person who has paid a cent towards student loans? You realize how unrealistic that is right? It sounds like you’d rather maintain the status quo and let every coming generation suffer from crushing debt because it’s “unfair” that you had to pay yours. Fuck right off

Oh cool something I know about. I’ll keep it simple.
Cardio: 1 mile walk every day.
Lifting: pick from starting strength, PPL, or 531 for beginners.
Diet: determine your daily calorie requirements by using an online calculator, then subtract 500 from it to figure out the amount you need to lose weight. The online calcs tend to be high, so take them with a grain of salt.

If you want an even simpler method, then eat less and move more. Do that consistently and you will lose a significant amount of weight by the half year mark.

Again money is taken from us that we have no say in either. I dont support the bullshit wars the US military conducted in the middle east yet my taxpayer money still went to the military. You can’t make everyone happy and that mentality of selfishness is why things dont get better.
Everyone just buy 1 share right before close on the 8th. Do you know how hilarious that would be? Even if they bomb their earnings, we control the market and make the shorts pay us.
Over time, fundamentals will prevail. Airlines have enormous overhead and fairly small profit margins. (4-10%} 95% of all airlines that ever existed have gone bankrupt. It’s a tough sector.

Hedge funds get burned all the time especially when shorting. Wall Street loves a good story there are plenty of stocks that make no money that have absurd valuations because maybe in 3-5 years they will do well.

If a short squeeze is about to happen I reckon it's gonna be right after market open or not to long after. I live in Austria and can trade til 2 hours before american market close.

kind of depends how much money you are playing with and how willing you are to lose it.  I wouldn't put all of my money on that but it could definitely happen.

I would probably buy shares if I were you but if you are set on a short term call id do 32c 12/18

Right, like you can't hold onto it forever expecting it to go up forever. I'm reading a book about commodities investing and the author tells a story about a friend who invested in silver and had his investment double and then triple and then eventually drop down to a significant loss. He asked him what he was thinking when silver had almost tripled and his response "that it would keep going up".

People don't know when it's going to moon but everyone is getting in early.

Here's what the situation is. GME has 140% of it's shares shorted. That means that if we can jack up the price enough, these short positions need to be closed. What happens is that these short positions don't own the underlying shares. For them to close, they essentially are going to be forced to buy the stock at the current market ask.

What we're doing on WSB and other communities, is buying up GME, moving the price up a little, hoping for some coming news. The two pieces of news are the earnings as well as the owner of Chewy possibly announcing a large investment and saying he's going to turn this outdated company around.

What happens then is the stock price shoots up, all these shorts start to panic and have to close their positions which means buying shares. Since 140% of the total amount of shares are shorted, we could see volume of shares purchased equal to the amount of outstanding shares. This will skyrocket the price of the stock as the demand for the shares skyrockets but those selling is far far less.

VWs share price rose 3,000%+ in a few days time. Not because of earnings or anything, but because the shorts covering their positions bought stock at whatever the ask was. So we're buying shares, setting a limit sell to 500 dollars. If the squeeze occurs, we're hoping that there are enough shorts covering their positions that they're forced to buy millions of shares at over 500 dollars a piece. It's not about fundamentals or the stock actually being worthy of the price, but a flaw in shorting without needing to own the underlying stocks and how if the stock price runs up rapidly it can trigger this massive demand to cover positions

That's why the majority of my position is in ITM calls for January and April, however I think there is a good chance we get good news this upcoming earnings. We will surely get some sort of guidance for their plans in regard to paying debt early, using buybacks, or having a dividend.
Couple of things:

Anyone else play Craps at the casino? I go to AC about 1-2x a year and will usually throw a few hundred on the Craps table. If you haven't played Craps, basically you can bet on any roll combination of two six-sided dice. Lower odds rolls have higher return (2,11,12).  Every round is opened by the shooter (selected dice roller) rolling the dice and that number rolled is the point (except 2,7, 11,12). After the round is opened you can bet on almost any roll you like: You can bet on any 8, you can bet that the dice will not only be 8 but both dice ill be 4 (eight hardways), etc. You can bet on those low probability rolls like 2, 11, 12, etc. But if a 7 (Craps) is rolled, all your bets are wiped off the table, your money goes to the house, and the round starts again.  You can also bet on 7. It's considered playing the dark side as you are usually betting that everyone else will lose money. 

When I play I'm careful about having too much money on the table. 7 is the highest probability roll and will come at some point. You need to expect to lose at some point. You can easily start chasing hot dice and start putting several chips on the table, only to hit a 7 moments later and lose it all.

It reminds me a lot of options trading. You can easily chase hot trends and throw all your money on the table, only to lose it in a second. You can YOLO all your money on boxcars (12) and come out big, but the odds are against you. 

When I play craps I tend you not get FOMO chasing after hot hands. I try to not blow my load and live to fight another day if craps is hit. I don't over extend myself, knowing that there is always another round coming. 

Any other Craps players here?

Thanks, this is good information. I imagine it'd be tough to get it on puts tomorrow morning though? Will their shares be unlocked during pre-market or will they have to wait until opening bell? I guess I could Google all of this.

Do you really think, our lord and saviour, Elon Musk the Great would just overlook a company like QS when their goal is literally fully aligned with Tesla's? Of course not... It has been researched into by TSLA and at the end of it, Tesla doesn't consider their tech to be worthy, or just not worth as of now.

Either way, if this company was really on to something with solid progress, Tesla would've acquired it. That JB Straubel guy most definitely got free equity in QS to be a board member.
TELOS
Yeah feb calls definitely seem good but they’re a bit overpriced so not sure what to do. I’m thinking either Jan 18 117.5C, Jan 18 120C or Feb 19 120C. The Feb calls are like an extra $200 premium though

Of course playing PLTR as well lol

Thats such a huge gain and there’s no way you could have known it would keep mooning.  I had an ATM 1500c expiring two months out bought the day the split was announced, sold the next day for 9k gain, if I’d held another week it would have been a 50k gain.
Still bag holding Jan 15 125c. I need a rocket ship to take off.
I have a feeling JWN will do some crazy shit. But first it'll probably consolidate a bit after ER. Or maybe it already did, Monday will tell us.

Anyone know where on the CBOE's website we can track hedge fund positioning for the VIX, per the WSJ: *"Leveraged funds like hedge funds recently ramped up wagers that would pay out if the VIX fell. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show such wagers recently hit their highest level since at least early August."*

We might see $20-25 EOY which is great, which is why i suggested leaps and shares. Trying to time it and buying weeklies isn’t really smart. Hence calling my self retarded for trying to time it.
I have no analytics to present, I'm a mere retard

I just see the 3M chart and see the correction/cooldown is over and it LOOKS like it was oversold and is now in the process of being bought back up; it topped at $60 before so I expect that range is the resistance
It was a diamond in the rough, but the appearance of fools gold attracted fools.

i.e. from the outside looking in, it all looks like random nonsense. People see that, get FOMO, and come here spouting random nonsense. Very disrespectful

what are shares?
Student loan forgiveness is the wrong message. Let there be accelerated work payoffs. Work in government infrastructure and service jobs (not bureaucracy - wishful thinking) and pay a decent wage. 5 year payoff.

Also - military - 4 year stint in military - loans forgiven.

You won't find another broker like RH, sadly. 

They've made it addicting on purpose and simplified it SO MUCH compared to others. 

I've tried a few and none of them have the appeal that RH has in terms of breaking it down to simply depositing money, picking a ticker, buying an option, and selling it the next day or week or whatever. They've simplified it enough to attract idiots like myself while also not boring us with stupid analytics.

It sucks if you broke your PDT, but it is what it is.

Are we talking about Karp?  Did you watch the video?  He directly states hes a 'card carrying progressive' in the video.   And in [this](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-has-a-20-billion-valuation-and-a-pretty-big-problem-it-keeps-losing-money-1542042135) article says he is a 'self-described socialist.'   

Further down in the article states,  “There are lots of customers globally and some domestically who feel they do not want to be affiliated with a company that powers the clandestine agencies of the world,” he says. “We want a public  perception that reflects who we are, and not everyone will like it.”

So he is pretty unapologetic about their activities.

I do think the interest sucks, but I sort of feel like if its at 16$ and hedge funds still want to short it doesnt matter if they entered at 10$. As long as they believe in their thesis.

I don’t think this can be defined as a squeeze, but more of a reaction to the recent 7$-17$ upgrade coupled with covid optimism. It is still a good bet it will move up further for a bit.

Repost from earlier this morning, because a few loser 🌈🐻 used the robot janitor to flag my meme as spam. (They aren’t mods in this channel – instead they’re normal users who know that giving a new post 3+ remove votes is enough to get the "automoderatorbot" to take that post down) 

**If you could click the robot janitor’s “vote to keep post” in the comments, that’d help me out so much in preventing this post from getting removed!**

*Yes, it’s pretty discouraging to have memes taken down because they do take time and effort, no matter how silly or simple they look. I just want to create a few laughs and spread a bit of positivity.* 

So thank you in advance, press the robot janitor’s “vote to keep post”, and I’ll make more memes when I have the chance! Have a great day everybody!

Short term it won't affect markets. Either way  a stimulus package will be passed soon after. The 6-12 month post election timeline will be favorable. Following that gap, market will likely decline if Biden is able to pass his tax plan if Georgia race goes Dem.

Something for everyone to be aware of on this forum. Part of Biden's tax plan adjusts Cap gains to 40% for those making over 1 million as well as step up in basis. While the 1 million mark may not directly affect most of you, it does affect large firms and funds. Those big players will be watching Georgia very closely as we get closer to the new year. If Georgia appears that it may go Dem, we could see a massive sell off December 31. Be careful with any calls with expiration around early January.

I was doing nice without wsb with TSLA and MGI, but I decided to yolo on PLTR and NVAX after going through the retard recommendations and autistic advise and so far it's going really well.

This sub is,atleast for me, a diamond in the rough even though it's full of people who want to see other people to eat shit.
This guy was first. Let it be known
Big tech has been stagnant since that bullshit in Sept, it's definitely itching to go big again soon.
Don’t overthink it. Just buy as many GME shares as you can afford tomorrow at market open and set your limit sell to $500.
Costa Rica is actually one of the safest places to retire

Isn't that just an added bonus? Buy USD low and sell high if it turns around?
Are u rambling
Thanks for this. I made a lot after your original post (which helped push me to go in on this over Moderna). Wish I’d bought even more.
Not with options, it doesn't.
I'd still be up massive. Ain't mad
I was down huge on weedstocks for a while so I just didn't bring it up. At all.
Yeah they really are. Hope it goes up on monday 🚀🚀🚀
Over 100 million shares are unlocked tomorrow. Eyes are on insiders to see how they move but the stock has been eating shit since the botched CNBC interview.
Yeah man life is a tragedy LOL
wishing all of you many tendies and green portfolios this week
The 5 minutes that video takes to watch, is 5 minutes I could be losing money. No thanks

I did this with NIO calls when I joined the sub 2 weeks ago. Panic sold $-2k because the volatility made me nervous. Would've been $25k the next day lols
True but what does a brick & mortar store that has the look, feel and smell of blockbuster do about it?
Facts but Shaolin Soccer is up there too.

Sorry just saw this. I ended up making an account with Ameritrade but might consider getting on robinhood or fidelity so I can get fractional shares of Tesla, Amazon, and the like.
You don't, you just take a loan out
Check out r/stopdrinking. I’ve used it a few times when I’ve found I’ve been too dependent on alcohol. There’s also a great book called this naked mind which helps  put it in perspective. Stay strong 💪🏻
I’m not sure if I would buy LULU options. Most of Beckys list is a buy and hold for 5 years IMO.
Yup. PLTR did 53% revenue growth in 1 year. 

They project Revenue growth of 36% for Q3-Q4 2020.

Call it a meme stock but the fundamentals and value of contracts speak numbers. Like $300,000,000 contracts with aerospace groups, military, world governments, world agencies, healthcare systems, it goes on and on. It’s going up. Citron bites the dust.

For the last two years, someone shows up and says a short squeeze of GameStop is occurring. Everyone loads up on calls and shares. The squeeze never happens and then people lose out on money and sell after a month of nothing.

&#x200B;

This latest time, we're actually seeing the stock price rise quite a bit so money can be made. Still unsure if the squeeze will occur as it hasn't any other time.

&#x200B;

This explains what the squeeze it, how it happened for other stocks, how that's related.

  
The one thing that WSB doesn't mention this time is that for VW was how many stocks were locked up compared to GME.
Its never bad to take profit, especially on meme stocks like nio.

I took out my 103% gains on PLTR on friday before it started dipping and i plan to buy in again if it continues to go down to like 20-25.

Even if it doesn't and i end up "losing" gains in the future, im still fine with it. 

I'm sure that at some point in the near future i'll have a good buy in into PLTR again and i will continue to make money off it, but even if it shoots to 50 by the end of tomorrow i will not have any regrets that i cashed out at 30 because with stocks this volatile, you gotta take profits when you can.

At least thats how i see it.
Yeah unless your a beta and then you get bitches taking Insta pics with your dog while your in the background saving mental spankbank material for later as the dog is sniffing those bitches crotches.
And the people who could not afford college, they get 10k each too right?

So 10k for every citizen, but not the unborn ones even though they are the ones we are taking the cash from, so I guess them too, right?

Or are we not trying to be fair, just arbitrary and in this case rewarding a subset of people who have higher earning potential than the rest of the population.
I will.

People are courteous here.  They read posting guidelines before shitting up someone else's sub.
Exactly right. Unfortunately most will sell all their winners and keep (or worse add on to) their losers..

Lel. Snapple is ded. The premium on their leaps is better used elsewhere.
Lmao, you mean Age: 33
I'm not bearish but man is VIX low. Very tempted to just by some UVXY and hold it a couple weeks. I mean, something will spike this up eventually. If not I can just pull out a few weeks from now with minimal loses because its pretty damn near all time low. How much more could it fall 10-15% max. But one round of bad news could spike it 100-600%. Seems like the risk is worth the potential reward.
Stores cost money and they have too many of them.
yup people (girls) do this with 20-100k in debt will stay with you until you've helped pay and move on. good for you dude you are fucking winner, just leave her now

I was going to initiate a position for psth for this reason but changed my mind:

- Stripe is a company that doesn’t do transactions anything 18+, meaning alcohol, cigarettes, sex shop, gambling etc.
- All time SF favorite unicorn, no problems fundraising
- Founders are irish, probably not buying into typical bullshit

Stripe doesnt need IPO to raise funds. Only reason they might IPO is if their external fundraising cant pay out the employees’ RSUs and they’ll go to other companies.

I think Bill Ackman is a classic bait and switch guy, probably psth will end up with taking a non-unicorn fintech to IPO.
Then you definitely know at least some of what you're doing. I've already seen plenty of retards over this weekend talking about buying SPY calls come Monday.

Yep, right after we've reached ATH. 

I don't judge people for not knowing their greeks, that shit doesn't make a huge difference in the end. But buying at the top... Idk what they're thinking

Says it passed the senate unanimously and seems like they’re thinking it will pass the house vote as well on Wednesday. Sucks for my BABA calls, especially since the quotes in the article from alibaba make it seem as though they have no intentions of complying if this shit does pass

That twitter account is run by a clear idiot. I’m down for a good gamble, but investing because this dude says it’s Stripe is not a great idea.
It’s not. Someone posted an article a few days ago in here and pltr is going to help distribute and I think track the virus/vaccine effectiveness.

If the stock is 25 your max risk is 5 or 20% of the value. Your profit if bought at 20 and sold at 25 is 25%.

Should make the decision pretty easy for you.
Nope. Just an old fuck who thinks GameStop is atrocious
Although the values may be accurate, these are all very strange fields for any resume.
You're looking at the surface. Your thesis is ''Hmm i dont see anyone walking into my local GameStop therefore the company has no value.'' Wtf kind of security analysis is that?

Separate GME e-commerce portion and analyze that for a second. GME has a $1.3bn-1.5bn/year e-commerce business that makes up for around 17% of total yearly sales. The current market cap has just reached $1bn. Connect the dots. Even a blind mind can see its way undervalued. But you think its worth $5.. In what world does a $1.5bn e-commerce biz get rated at $300m. Market usually gives AT LEAST a 2x multiple. Therefore GME e-commerce is worth $30/share on its own.. Remember, it only accounts for 17% of total annual revenue.

GME has been priced for bankruptcy and they are no where close to it. $800m cash on the books. Multiple new revenue streams including digital rev sharing/monetizing customer data/online ad rev. Hundreds of millions of dollars flowing in thanks to the console refresh. Voluntarily buying back their debt early. You have Cohen who is going to force management to supercharge itself into an E-commerce category killer for everything gaming and then some. He will do it himself if he has to. He wants a CHWY style business for GME. CHWY trades at 4x sales. If GME traded at 4x sales they would be worth 20+billion in mrkt cap and $300/share. You may think that completely unrealistic but GME has the sales any entrepreneur would kill to have. GME is an easy target for Cohen because it has everything he wants and it is cheap as fuck to buy it.

GME has tons of sales and loyal customers. They are in a rapidly growing gaming industry with an ever increasing TAM. Cohen sees the potential to make GME a giant in the gaming category. He wants to make GME better than any other competitor (including AMZN) when it comes to e-commerce/gaming, and he has the skills and track record to believe in him. They suffered years of terrible management and that is why sentiment is so negative. But they have new management who has done well since 2019 in turning GME around.

Wall St. analysts are so wrong on GME. They think there will be negative EPS for another 2 years, when in reality that is not the case. Q3 may be breakeven or post a minimal loss which was to be expected, but Q4 will be explosive and shock everyone.

All the bear thesis' are wrong, Nobody shops at GME, why would i shop at GME when i can order on AMZN, digital consoles, bankruptcy. All debunked.

People hear GameStop and instantly write it off without thinking, much like you have done. Their has been lots of DD that says GME will do extremely well in the future if it manages to keep itself on track. You'll kick yourself when this is finished for looking at GME at $16 and not buying into it today.

You can’t keep hijacking the meeting
Mate, /u/Stirlingblue has been really patient with you considering the mix of crass ignorance and confidence you display. There are governments all over the world that run activities through market-based mechanisms and do it quite efficiently. And no, you didn't have a massive military before income tax increased substantially in the US. You can literally go to wikipedia right now and look at the timing of those increases. They are parallel. There are loads of historical commentary available online that describe public discourse surrounding the weakness of the US military before WW1, from internal perspectives. You just need the capacity to self-criticize and realize you might need to read more to make such rigid stances. I'm just happy you grew up an American because if you were born in Ethiopia with that IQ you'd probably have been eaten by hyenas by age 12.

And all the fads that crashed? Track the sentiment on those you coward
I say it's a $5 stock in 2-3 years because I don't believe in the turn around vision. Shorts just lost roughly 800 million dollars when this went from $4 to $16 the incentive is not to lose another billion dollars. It's possible and many people believe that GME will be bought out or turned around even if it means much lower revenue and profits. It will take time to see if the vision plays out in the mean time paying 8-12% interest while down 800 million isn't a great spot to be in.

I'm reloading any pullbacks, but my CHWY and NET positions already started hitting.
I'm happy with it. Typical FOMO shit where people are bummed out that they didnt get in on this when it was $10-15 a share. Easy money has been made and risk has jumped considerably with how high the IV has gotten. No need to get emotionally invested in it, plays are always popping up elsewhere
Why not by end of day tomorrow? It’s definitely possible with some luck

Since I've become a gamer over the past week and immersed myself in the Immoral Vader series, I've finally learned how to trade.  In the light saver dojo, you just keep throwing your sabers at shit and cut as it's going away, cut as it's coming back.. but it's non-stop throwing.  So, the way to trade is to just throw money at every ticker that WSB shills, cash out after it runs a bit, wait for a small pull back, repeat.

The one thing I haven't figured out how to deal with yet, though, are the fucking two-legged droids; my saber sometimes gets stuck in them for too long.  I guess that's the part where I lose money.  Maybe a blaster (covered call, CSP).  

Anyway, feel free to pin this comment as general DD.  Or, General Double-Dicked... not to be confused with "two-dick dude" from reddit a few years ago.  That was hilarious.
Cmon, you think the same retards that listen to Cramer and shitron do any reading into anything their selves. Their going to see China look up China stocks and sell all bc they can’t think for themselves.
If you bought in at $20, and the stock is up $5. Then it’s up 25%... so your max downside would then be 25%. Jesus Christ I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.

You folks are confusing two things. These three statements below are correct:

The stock is trading at 25. You are guaranteed 20 back. Your risk is 5 or 20%

The NAV is 20 (which you can not buy it for, since trading at 25) or a 25% premium.

Your risk if buy this stock is 20% of your purchase price if bought this stock right now at 25

I don’t necessarily think all big private tech unicorns are comparing themselves to DKNG. The other problem is right now SPACs are being heavily tainted by pre-revenue businesses. Not something a $40B unicorn wants to associate themselves with

It also doesn’t mean they won’t leave money on the table. Because it’s a zero sum game - if PTSH prices the acquisition to perfection (I.e. the valuation is right so no pop and therefore no money “left on the table”), then all it means is all the SH of PTSH get f’d because you don’t get a pop from the deal announcement

Anyway, a 20min commute and running the heat, on a full round trip we are talking up to around 3kwh for heat per day when it's very cold. I pay about 12 cents per kilowatt-hour, so you can see that saving $10 a month by not using the heat in my car is very much possible and realistic
im confused

wouldn't u make more money off the $10 call as the value of the $10 call would be higher than the $12 call, regardless of premium paid, if the stock reaches $12?

Also QLYS had partnership with Google last year, this year's partnership just seems like an extension / further development into their already-integrated cloud agent since last year

DD on this BLT?
Make it 20 and we got a deal
For every share you own and hold through merger, you get 2/9 of a warrant at a price of $23. They expire in 5 years.  The 2/9 is a minimum you will receive. "Tontine" here in the ticker refers to the warrant structure. They will provide a fixed number of shares and warrants that will go to someone. If you buy now and sell post announcement but pre-merger, for example, your warrants per share will come to me (as someone who didn't sell before merger). Therefore, instead of 2/9 I may collect 3/9 or 4/9 per share depending on who sells and when. Basically an insurance against sell off and incentivizes long term investors (Klarman and Buffet salivating). That's it.
Good fundamentals.

The company won't be Stripe, but the insider-buying alone makes this a compelling flyer.
He did that too here ya go:

I haven't verified, pls do if you look back and figure a rough timeline.
Click that all time chart, yeah, that’s why
my bet is this is a negotiation tactic

A company like stripe is expected to act extremely rationally in terms of negotiation, because it has perfect knowledge as a result of the collective wisdom of all its investors. To use an analogy, if you were going into a new job, and you had perfect knowledge about the new job and all its pitfalls and benefits, you would rationally use the full range of negotiation tactics at your disposal to squeeze every penny you can get. We should only expect the same from stripe. My bet is psth will get stripe, but on kinda shittier terms than everyone would like

You know GME was trading at $4 in August... and now its up to $16. Do the math on that, it is actively squeezing. 400% increase is pretty fucking squeezed. Literally, they didn't have calls this far out of the money for sale back in August. Plenty of people short sellers have left already, and as the price rises, more short sellers are getting on board. The squeeze we are seeing is just going to get squeezed again.

i still go to the dentist, since it’s only once a year. i was going to chiropractors because i have neuropathy and even if people think they’re quacks, if you have chronic pain they definitely help and it’s worth it. no one wore a mask at their offices though so i stopped going because i also have chron’s disease and am at risk with covid. for me it depends on how many people frequent the offices and if they wear masks

That's not true. The reason they had free cash flow in Q2 is because of a reduction in working capital. 

Let me break that down further for you. They sold inventory and they didn't buy more inventory. It is extremely clear in the balance sheet. Obviously if you sell shit that you have in the store and don't buy new merchandise, your cash flow will be positive. 

That simply is not sustainable. 

It's crazy to me that you think you understand how read financials when you can't even understand this.

Yes, IV for March $34 strike is 136%. For mid December $34 strike is above 200%. Still high for March but a move away from the strike means massive losses for the December calls. Also have to consider theta if it never reached the 34$ strike price. I'd rather stay safe even though the profits aren't as great.

Adderall. Daily. No joke. I used to take it every so often in college. It was great but I never had a script. Started taking it regularly about 4 years ago when I decided to learn programming. 4 months after starting I had an internship. 2 months after that I was paid. And a year after that I started a job paying 6 figures.

Went from directionless to 6 figures in an industry I love in 18 months. Because of adderall I was able to do what most people do with programming in 1/4 the time. On my own. And the journey all happened while being able to work full time (I was a poker player and math teacher each part time) And I loved every second of it.

Tbh I'm relatively new to the train, but I truly see it as a long term one. Hard not to see it growing especially with the companies that invested this week (Canadian pension plan being a big one) here's hoping it keeps ballooning
Sold BA calls for like $8K profit during the June spike. Could have sold for $150K had I held. Never would have held that long, so not that upset about it. But probably could have waited a day and gotten around $40K
Makes sense. I’m in.
Of course. Why wouldn’t you unless you are old or at risk or live with someone who is old or at risk? 

Man some people have really succumbed to the covid hysteria. Have to learn to live with this thing
I don’t want to insult you but almost everything you wrote is inaccurate.

The downside with traditional platforms compared with RNA/vector-based platforms is that it takes longer to identify and develop the initial vaccine candidate. But once you’ve identified a candidate the RNA/vector platforms have no advantage, and actually have some significant disadvantages related to (generally) reduced efficacy and a lack of a proven safety profile. To be clear, these non-traditional platforms are valuable, particularly in a pandemic, but the value is in speed. In our current situation the advantage in speed is very minimal, especially when you consider the supply constraints. 

Second, you have it completely backwards about IgG production - both in principle and with respect to these specific vaccines. NVAX has demonstrated by the highest NAb titers of the Phase 3 candidates by far. And it’s simply not true that mRNA vaccines have superior NAb generating properties.

Again, I don’t want to insult you, but I’m guessing you spend a lot of time on MRNA/PFE message boards bc your interpretation of how vaccines work and what’s “natural” is very flawed. For one, you don’t develop an immune response against the adjuvant - adjuvants are non-specific amplifiers of the immune response to the antigen. NVAX’s vaccine is a nanoparticle close to the same size as the actual virus, with spike protein presented on the surface of the particle very similar to the way the virus presets them. That’s FAR closer to the way things happen “in nature” than a god damn mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle that enters a host cell to and is translated into a spike protein that becomes the eventual antigen. 

Regarding mutations you’re almost entirely wrong again. Single nucleotide mutations in the virus only matter for vaccine efficacy IF it leads to a missense mutation for an amino acid on the spike protein that’s critical for antigen-antibody interactions. To render our current crop of vaccines ineffective, we’d probably need multiple single nucleotide missense mutations on the spike protein. This is unlikely but not impossible (recent human-mink-human transmission and generation of “cluster 5” mutant strain actually might have led to something like this but it’s too soon to tell). However, in the event that this happens, all of the vaccines would be potentially affected bc they all use the spike protein. If the mutation were significant enough, all companies would have to start over. In this scenario, mRNA platforms would again have a small lead in generating a new vaccine candidate but I think this lead would actually be smaller if we have a second round and wouldn’t be material either way.
IPO price was too low
Nah, i always take the stuff here with a grain of salt, i'm just mostly here for the memes and the loss/gain porn. It's just that i got a little curious about the whole PLTR thing, and wanted to know if it was actually a worthy investment.
[removed]
With a reasonable time horizon, shares seem interesting to me here. The 2/9 structure is delicious. If not Stripe, all the non-evidence hacks are clocks that are right twice a day. There could be a sell-off to some extent but again conventional wisdom doesn't work here. The quality of the investors so far protect this against being a flop. If you hold through merger you lap up what the sellers missed. If it was unequivocally stated tmr that its not and cannot be Stripe, my positions would not change. I was in prior to Stripe speculation really ramped up. The DD here is a DD showing all the evidence in favor of Stripe. Those who disagree can disagree on that point but would you still pass up this SPAC structure? With this list of investors? With an announcement imminent? And how do you argue against the evidence in favor of stripe? Hang your hat on a twitter troll, go ahead...

For real, when i discovered this a couple years ago, It led me to buying NVDA, AMD, AMZN and some weed stocks, when it started taking off, I was really interested in options, but i was actually too lazy to invest the time to learn that shit. In hindsight im so fucking glad.  Now im at +230% and its in large part due to this sub, but things could have turned out very different. 

So all i all, fuck options, just buy stocks, cant really do too much wrong and u still have a huge upside

Seems to me it's on the wrong side of the risk/reward. The stock for MGM is mostly back to where it was pre-pandemic. The vaccine news already pretty much recovered the stock almost completely.

The next shoes to drop, I think, are more lockdowns which would tend to be negative for MGM (and all the vaccine plays short term).

Who fucking knows. Biden, Trump and Kamala could all quit and the market might soar. It's all gambling at this point.
Do you have any thoughts on shares vs. warrants here?
Just a tip!
They're not mutually exclusive
Sold my nio Jan 21 $20 calls for 300k profit the friday before election.. would be another 350k to 400k! Luckily I took 100k and paid off my Tesla and put the rest into Tesla stock and options when it was around $410!! So it all worked out in the end.. but I did spend 2 weeks wanting to puke because I sold like a wimp!
I think of it this way. If someone less retarded than me wants to correct me, please do. Buying a call option is just paying for the contract that says you may purchase 100 shares of the stock at a given price by the given date. You now own that contract and paid for it. If later someone else wants to buy that contract from you, you can sell it at whatever price you two agree upon. They now own the contract with the original creator of it, and you are no longer involved at all.
Yeah I’m excited except I’m gonna wait until they port some of the programs I use into native ARM versus the Rosetta emulator. While I mostly do coding, I do play some video games and the performance of steam on the new MacBook Pro was beyond terrible. This is a software issue that hopefully gets fixed later on although this time I’m waiting since I also thought developers of games would have moved to Metal API and well that went nowhere
Investing in what, karma?

When a company IPOs, there's an amount of time that company insiders cannot sell their stocks. That period will be ending soon, which means that more than likely a huge amount of shares will be hitting the market. More people buying = stonks go up.
This IPO’d at $20, not $10... the amount of retards arguing on this ticker that have no clue what they’re talking about is comical.
Right: who needs him?
It is for Tesla :----)
I don’t believe that it would be 50K at all. I think that the government would pay off your loans up to a certain amount like a 10K cap on your loans and then for people who paid theirs off maybe a range depending on how much they paid.
Fuck. I have BABA shares. Gotta unload them fuckers ASAP. Guess the large traders are going to dump on open before I get to sell.

So far it's been working for me. I trade on eToro and still have no idea what eToro is actually. I'll set to buy PLTR for whenever markets open ( I still don't know when that happens). I just come here to ctrl+c some stock names and than ctrl+v into eToro search if it's possible to buy I'll do that. I had 300% profit on NIO. Still don't know what NIO is. I only check my portfolio on Saturdays since I'm afraid that it might fuck me up mentally if I go red in mid week.


Thank you WSB, I gained money and confidence because of you. I start to conciser myself as an investor that's a huge boost in morality and really helps to fight my brain while trying to fall asleep and thinking about all the cringe shit that happened 14years ago or so. Now I just say FUCK OF BRAIN look at me now I'm an investor gonna be big money boy one day.

It will work.  As long as our calls are the furthest out of the money and have expiration dates 1 week, 2 and many be even 3 weeks we will fuel PLTR even more for its next rocket launch into $100.

What do you think about a possibility of a Dec selloff like 2018? Obviously virus or employment data do nothing to this market, but what about Possible selloff due to change in Cap gains taxes under Biden?
If you were to take a sec a do any real research you would know this isn't going to be stripe. This will still be a good investment but probably going to be dead money untill mid January.

Agree, cope tho
You invested in yourself in hopes of raising your future earnings potential and now you want the rest of the people to pay for your investment while you reap the rewards.

Well of course you want that, who wouldn't but why would the rest of us be punished by taking out money and giving it to you?

If anyone should be refunding your money it is the school's endowments, not Jim who never went to college and is busting his ass working 9-5 at a local factory paying 24% a year in fed taxes while you sat in class improving your earnings potential.

You want the reward without any risk, worse than that you want Jim to pay for your reward because umm because umm reasons...
Yes. Post it here and hype it up. Free tendies

Hey man, I feel bad for you. I'm asking for the meme only. But the idea of short squeeze is that there are people who thinks GME is going to go down (short) but they realized that GME is going up evident im Friday.

So, this short people is getting squeezed into becoming a buyer because the force of stock is going up.

Now, as more buyer GME exist, it exerts the force of the price to go up.

Thus the term short squeeze.

APHA gonna moon so hard in the next couple weeks/months. Do you guys actually want some DD and fundamentals as to why or just 🚀🚀🚀🚀 emojis?
This is a toxic piece of the American mindset. "I worked for this so everyone else should have to."

Yes, you did, congratulations. Many people before you worked plenty hard to create a foundation that made your success possible. Now's your turn to do the same for the next generation. 

It is not a "fuck you" at all. It is an acknowledgement of how much effort it takes to do what you have done, but so many others struggle immensely with. Look at it as validation of your own efforts and an opportunity for you to help others.
I think feb calls should be best, I didnt really researched it yet tho so dont take my word blindly. I will play pltr and then switch to apple probably
I don't think you understand how a short squeeze actually takes place.
Hmmmm let me think real hard about this...PLTRc 1/21
Op said he's swing trading.
I read the post and the DD is accurate with the timeline. The guy know what he is talking about

PLTR only "dipped" on Friday because Paper-Handed Noobs didnt know that Citron makes their money playing off fears of small investors. Ask yourself why was his TWEET posted AFTER market open on a FRIDAY during a LOW VOLUME, SHORTENED HOLIDAY session? Every 0dte Call holder shat their pants and sold since market closed at 1pm EST. And in true CITRON fashion, they scooped up an insanely LARGE LONG position after price dipped. 

They did this in the past with TSLA, SHOP, NIO and others. If ya didnt know, now ya know...
Wise man, that was exactly what I was thinkgen, but did not dare to ask to keep panic low last Friday. So, is it really so?
Catchy as fuck

So here’s the problem, if everyone agrees gamestop is a 5$ stock, what incentive do shorts have to close their position? GameStop is such a small company that it’s likely a small position $wise.

There’s clearly more than enough shares available to borrow. Otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to short them in the first place

Yes, but dedicate a non trivial amount of that time finding people smarter than you who believe in your concept and vision to help execute on your plan. Compensate them very well. And most importantly listen to them, especially when they disagree with you.
Is Friday usually the day people dump and it drops? I know it was brutal this past Friday, it was a whole massacre, but is there basically a pattern of stocks going down Friday on purpose ? And which lottery puts were you thinking of if let’s say PLTR hits 35 by Wed

Bought PLTR at the top Friday at $32 in stocks. How fucked am I if I try to let it sit until 12/24? Honestly, I’d just be happy if I broke even.
Yeah but the direction change signal could be coming with the next few weeks with earnings and their response or lack there of to RC letter and what that brings.
If you could read financials you would see that they have enough cash on hand + enough future cash flow generated from this start of a new console cycle to last at least 5 more years.  The idea that they're going bankrupt tomorrow is just absurd

Just a small tip. I had the same issue, except I study a difficult course and I am actually spending my extra year at university now. What you are lacking is responsibility.

If you get something you are responsible for it helps a lot. Also, exercise is incredibly helpful, but we both know you are not getting out of bed to go jogging or hit the gym. I would suggest joining some type of fighting sport club. Be it boxing, jiu jitsu, judo, whatever. But that helps you to actually be tired in the evening. Sorts out your sleeping pattern and becomes something you get exited about really quickly, which helps getting out of bed in the morning. Even if you wish the day over to get to the club, at least you have something you are exited about.
DO I sell my PLTR calls this week if there is a huge spike or wait closer to end of December when it expires

Options with less than 3 weeks to expiry are generally just straight up gambling (but god, is it fun.) Buying options at least 45-70 days from expiry will minimize Theta decay. Once there is less than a month to go it will start to eat away at it quickly.

The money should come from the schools endowments which are close to a trillion dollars.

Paying off student loans while not paying back the people who paid their off is wrong and its also wrong to not give the same to those that could not afford school.

I wrote a very thought-provoking comment last night that got removed pretty quickly. It is as follows:
"canadians are retarded" 

Really makes you wonder what the bar is set at for quality discussion on this sub
How do you know if they were short buying?
Good question! I sold a covered call for a strike price of 20$, figuring that with the premium I'd make enough of a profit that I'd be ok with it going up more. That said, I think it has a pretty good chance of going up more from there and so I'll be holding on to my remaining shares. 

I think people predicting a squeeze to 50+ based on GME becoming an e-commerce company are speculating wildly, but in this market they could very well be right. I really trust the management of this company now though, and I think they will at least make pretty killer profits in the short term. It looks like there's unimaginable demand for the PS5, which should be very good for GME.
Lol forgot about that.
America is going bankrupt with this student loan bullshit

You don’t follow their picks because it’s usually too late to get in, yet you think them getting onto NIO means that it has a lot of room left to run? Cognitive dissonance much?

I hold some put warrants 2 months out that I bought last week, but they are more so that I can keep playing while also bag holding the rest of my bullish plays.

I'd say keep away from tickers that are included in major ETFs and stick to momentum/meme plays like weed/PLTR/GME. Feels like they would sell off less or have money even rotate into them in case of a major draw down.

Well that is a word that you don't take to casino.  
(Of course taking small puts/bears after breakout is good move to get some extra from long positions, that is what big bois do)
It cost me money. I did a buy call option of a strike price of $34 that was above the closed price before Friday’s rise and fall. I had to pay that premium. As I understood that is what I could loose if it went belly up and I let the thing expire.
I had 15 calls of Tesla around the 410/420 during the sp500 news spike. Sold at open at 455. If I’d held them I’d be at ~300k profit
I had NIO at $7, sold half at $14, sold other half $17. Thought I crushed it.
Even if they make it to 66 they'll get overconfident and -99% their accounts.
Great job. If your wins continue through the end of the year, PLEASE PLEASE put 40% into a savings account to pay taxes....50% if you live in a high tax state like NY or CA. Pay less tax by moving some into an IRA and/or giving to charity.

If you don't set this cash aside and YOLO and lose in 2021, you're still on the hook to pay 2020's tax. Losses in 2021 won't help.
[deleted]
No no no I’ll explain further, so basically you just buy a $12 call if stonk at $10 for .10 and $10 call worth .7 so basically if stonk go to $12 you like make 600% return on $12 and like maybe 2-300% on $10 dollar call 📞 basicallye so yeah there you go less complicated

In this case it's pretty irrational unless he somehow made a lot of money consistently on the stock market in the first place to prove he knew anything about trading. At no point did he do anything to prove he could turn it around, he just doubled down on a losing strategy. Probably should have just accepted the loss, started playing more safe, then amped up the risk a bit again if he actually started making some returns at any point.

A solid PLTR strategy is to purchase the furthest OTM calls and don't all pick the same weekly expiration dates of 1 week.  Buy up the calls for 1 week and 2 week expirations.  That way at the end of the week not everyone's calls expire at the same time pushing the market down.

Note that only whole warrants will be exercisable. So you need to buy in amounts divisible by 9 to get the best value.

Shares outstanding is 200M and 13F accounts for 137M so this means 63M shares are unaccounted for?
I picked BA over JETS since they also got the 737 headwind besides recovery.  I only got 30 CCL leaps but 20 SLB leaps (plus 20 Jan21 shorter term calls) and a lot of XOM/XLE shares.  Also a lot of SPG/UBA shares.
I mean even if its not Stripe (Im not 100% on anything with this level of uncertainty) the idea that this is just going to die is so wrong. Klarman, Guggenheim, Teacher's Unions, all insurance that this isnt going to flop. If the press was actually reporting these positions it would jump to $30. We are living in insane robinhood times, don't forget.

You're looking way too far ahead. I'm with you GME will not only hit $5 it may go bankrupt. But that's years away and the mistake the shorts made is they thought it would happen a year ago. Now they got caught holding 70 million shares short when there are only 40 million or less shares available to trade and the float continues to get reduced every week. Sentiment around GME has changed and for the next couple of years this isn't a $5 dollar stock the problem shorts have is can they unwind the position before it explodes in their face I don't think it's possible.
Fucking rookie. If your not taking 15 bathroom breaks at work to check on your stonks are you really even a autistic retard ?

For all you paper hands out there.  I’ve done some important DD for you.

If you start with $1,600 ( face it most of y’all broke cause paper hands )

Then you will need to make 67 paper hand trades at 10% to turn that into a cool million.

First ones free so dump all your $1,600 in TSLA and 10% guaranteed.

Fuck those cock suckers
Whoever wrote the call is obligated. If you have a call and want to close it, you sell a call at the same strike and expiration so that everything cancels out. Your broker does that automatically when you want to close that call
Long term, buying PLTR stock will be a good idea for a while. Buy on the daily dip below VWAP and RSI 30.
Learn about dollar cost averaging, and build a position over time.
Or buy LEAPS.
PLTR is more than just a WSB meme-stock.
But having retard strength sure doesn't hurt

I made 13 purchases of Nio between feb-april ranging from 2.80 to 4.40/share. I ended up selling it all at 3.87 to buy NKLA. It wasn't a total loss since I bought pre-merge (28.25) and sold at 75.51. But I'm still kicking myself since Nio would have made me more if I had just been patient.
You might wanna continue to avoid that.

Warrants have no max. If the stock is post merger, and the stock is 80$, warrants could be 40$ theoretically. However for most successful SPACs more likely 30-40$ stock and 12-16$ warrants

But if you need confirmation bias, PLTR will skyrocket and triple every year for the next 100 years.

Always thought it was an unusual job.
Yeah man, I'm in deep with shares too. The WSB pump was a bit unexpected, though I thought there would be more hype off the direct listing, the instant gratification has been much appreciated. Was a bit anxious during the first month, as PLTR spent most days well below my $10 entry point. 
Was relieved when it finally started hovering above $10, and had originally forecast it to hit $15 at the end of the year. Funny how a 3% pullback has everyone worried. Like it was gonna run 10-20% per day forever.

Mechanics over fundamentals

Demand for shares is all time high due to inclusion and limited float
For five years it has risen. Why do you think it will stop now?
They probably front run the positions before they post so they are smarter than their followers who help them make a lot of money.
I haven't gone out of my house in 11 months fuckface
I think the first option has a higher probability because it brings more demand at once, but the more popular option (what the funds want) is split the purchase into two periods (two quarters I think, so one in december and another next year). The stock might dip
Switching to theta gang tomorrow and selling covered calls on PLTR. 

I figure if the stock drops, I’ll make my money back in the short term with selling the calls. In the longer term I bet this stock will go up and either way I’ll make some money. 

Thoughts?
youre comparing a legacy business model to a different business model. you know why apple is valued so much more than even when nokia was king? nokia just sold phones and they sold them with distributors. apple sells them direct to customers and have an app store that allows them to collect 30% on everything. nio and tesla sell direct to customers unlike legacy auto companies, and they aren't just car companies, their revenue stream comes from elsewhere not just from the selling of cars
I'm long fisker with shares and long dated calls so don't get me wrong, I like the company. But while I like their asset-light plan, it makes me question their current valuation even more. I'm just personally hesitant about fisker as a short term play. Confident that even with some bumps in the road they can be a killer long term investment though.

Maybe. We already know the target won't be announced until Q1. High profile hedge fund investments could keep it up and there's no reason for Stripe speculation to die until the final word is given.
Because you are expecting a reasonably coherent and intellectual response from a bunch of retards half of whom dont even understand what an option is nor care to understand how they work other than up or down. The mere fact that you think this sub would be a reputable source of information really speaks volumes to your lack of understanding of you surroundings and where you choose to seek information.

Try google.
Say what you will, but I respect Citron’s hustle. Wish what they did wasn’t legal. But it is.
I was debating shorting PLTR, but decided instead in going to buy a few hundred shares Monday and sel covered calls. 

This has that retard strength. I’m betting to see some -5%-%10 days but either way I don’t think it’s bad for a long term hold and I’ll make my money back easy selling calls in the short term.
that’s what most Americans are dealing with. WSB and robin hood are a creation made from millennial and zoomer rage and desperation

There'll always be a next TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME, APHA or FROG...

The fact that you use the word premium worries me. Did you buy to open or sell to open?

If you bought to open you're fine. If you sold to open your loss is, technically, unlimited.

The best way to check is this, did the option cost you money or did you get a deposit in your account after the transaction was done?
I don't understand the moat of ZM. Someone in management got sick of using zoom for whatever reason, one week later everone's using whereby and no one could really give less of a fuck.

Explain
NKLA , gm announcement and Trevor can jump the financial ship and claim "the new management " or something stupid like that.

i dont have a position im just saying its possible to be bearish on SOMETHING.
EDUC.  In at $6, sold at $10.  Then it hit $18.  Not nearly as bad as your own though.
Depends what asset you use. If you buy bonds, or stocks, you can find the amount with some basic math. If you buy houses and rent them, that’s a very different calculation. 

If you buy stock that pays a dividend, you’d need a basket of different listings with different dividend payments for safety. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. You could buy, for example, a stable secure bank stock (Bank of Nova Scotia - BNS current yield 5.45%), MO (yield 8.52%), EPD (8.93%), Pfizer (4.02%). Thats a conservative Canadian bank, a risky tobacco company, an oil services company that relies on pipeline fees not the price of oil, and a drug maker that is on the front lines of covid vaccine. For simplicity that’s 4 stocks. 

If you split an equal amount into each stock, you’d pay 20% federal tax on dividends in 2020. In Georgia (where I am) there’s a 5% dividend tax at this level of dividend income. 

So for me it’s 25% tax on dividends. To reach a net of $240,000, I’d need to receive $320,000 in dividends, less tax, to hit $240K a year. This assumes you wouldn’t be tempted to sell the underlying asset ever. 

To hit $320K/year: the above stocks, in a balanced split between them yields 6.73%. Your original investment into these stocks would need to be $4,574,829. At 6.73% the annual dividends would be $320K, less 20% federal dividend tax, and 5% state (if you lived in Georgia), and net you $240K.

I bought 10 shares of pre-split TSLA, couldn't handle the volatility, panic-sold at a 2k loss--stock price was up $600 less than a month later. -2k instead of +6k isn't the worst thing in the world compared to other peoples' loss porn, but it was still intensely aggravating.

I’m torn here...Klarman, Guggenheim wouldnt put so much of their funds into this without having a good idea what it is...right? They have to know something. These guys aren’t WSBs, yolo’ing $400m on a spac rumor. 

BUT...then I think about the numbers. A month ago when Stripe was valued around $35-40B this made sense. But now we know they’re valued closer to $100B. So is it still attractive if it’s 250% higher than a month ago? 

Ugh....I’m so close to pushing all the chips in on this but that latest valuation....

Spacs goal is to buy a stake in the company and bring them public. 

Spac route they know exactly what they’re getting. If you look at snow ipo. They got 3.6B but lost out on additional $4.8B that Buffett and the banks made
What’s with all the bull faith anyways
I think you overestimate that market segment right now. AMZN is focused on Pharma and AWS which is a huge venture. WMT is focused on subscription based services now. And TGT is still renovating their stores to include liquor, groceries, and markets. All of which are way more profitable and capture more market than GME model. Plus with all shortages of consoles/PC parts, there is no benefit to move into the gaming segment now

Alright my brother this is what you are going to do:

Third theres a 5 minute stretches video on youtube from bowflex. heres a link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L2lnxIcNmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L2lnxIcNmo)

Get through the stretches and your body will already be feeling better then before. 

since you are just getting started heres what you do after stretches.

20x jumping jacks 3 sets

5-10 pushups 3 sets

situps , start counting when the pain starts do 10 3 sets

planks youtube it do em for a minute 

this whole routine wont take more then 15 minutes , seeing your upper body start to take shape should motivate you to keep upping the ante. 

January i couldnt do 20 pushups total now im doing 4 sets of 25 nose touching floor, i was where you are. Eat a shit load of chicken breast , and dont eat anything you cant identify , processed anything. Brown bread , Garlic butter , PB&J as a treat sometimes. Once your body is getting all the vitamins it needs it wont be hungry all the time. The other bad eating shit is just habitual , you can break it . Don't smoke weed, if you do QUIT it sucks for a week you become fuicidal but fuck it sacrafice now and live forever victorious.

To be one of those assholes that brag about having bought APPL at $15, AMZN at $3, SHOP at $30, NIO at $2 ... and so on; will be to have bought PLTR at $18 in a year or two.
The PLTR hype train is still just gaining steam.
There will ge inevitable peaks and valleys, but the general trajectory will be a rocket-ride.
I cut my gains unfortunately going a bit too long with puts, but still got out with a decent percentage gain. Now made a small amount with PLTR calls and got out early Friday morning. Got some more though hoping it comes back up, haha.

You are buying PSTH as it is speculated (expected) that PSTH will put a stake in Stripe (which is not a listed company) through SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company). If that happens, there is a huge upside potential for PSTH as Stripe is managed really well.

Real talk: when is it time for SPY puts? This run can’t go on forever...
I haven't followed the recent AirBnB stuff with much intent because it did seem so unlikely. The last I saw, some IPO stuff was delayed again. So your intel is good to know. This is not a valid argument against any of the Stripe DD. Its flawed to just say because AirBnB said no, another big company will say no. That's basically your argument as Collision Bros have said nothing specific publicly.

Please show us where the Collision brothers have said anything specific on this.

Ackman has also said repeatedly they are targeting an announcement in 2020 and a Q1 merger. Please correct me if I am wrong.
Hate to say it, but this is possibly true
That's kind of the way I feel. This isn't a new issue. This has been on the table since spring. Plus the CEO has already said they plan to play by the rules.

Your logic is sound except for the fact Nikola has a $10b market cap and this market is pretty forward looking.

No doubt. That’s exactly why I want to go long on NIO.
This is the most interesting SPAC by far but Pinning Stripe to it is wreckless with too high expectations and will be huge sell off by disappointment no matter how good the true target is. The mere fact that Ackman can have such a unique SPAC with $20 NAV, tontine structure, auto split of units gives me confidence in him making it investor friendly with a great target. I have over 100k in it. I want the preannouncement price increase be slow and organic rather than pumps.

IMO when it comes to meme stocks it's more gambling than investing. Always be cautious buying into the hype and never spend more than you can afford to lose.

When the stocks are increasing this fast it is a "get rich fast" scheme where as investing is a "get rich slow but for sure" type of deal.

Invest into companies you think will exist in 20 years, then it is always a safe bet  (like Walmart/Nike). It is boring but safe, the way investing should be. 

It is called wallstreet"bets". See this as a betting/gambling subreddit, not as an investing subreddit even if you can get good investing info here.

Me too. What are we buying? PSHT? Or STRIPE?   


I don't get it. The SPAC is to buy something else and then take THAT thing public under the SPAC? Or by itself? Why does the bought company need the SPAC? If they're about to go public, they're going to get a boatload of money anyway.   


What does the SPAC bring to the table other than greedy hedge funders?
Lockdowns reduces energy consumption but once there is no more lockdown, energy consumption is going to increase.  It may or may not return to pre pandemic level for a while but will definitely be more than today.  The biggest risk for energy is already in the rear mirror, unless OPEC decides to increase production prematurely.

You're rangebound on P/L but if it's a high risk stock that's not the worst position to be in. You can also roll the calls/puts, change the strikes to establish net debit/credit... Blah blah blah

I think he'd be better off with spreads as they accomplish essentially the same P/L but require 1/100th the capital.
Just wait another month when there’s still no target and people finally admit it won’t be Stripe

GME bulls are delusional, sorry I said it.
You say they will delist stocks that don't comply with us audit policy. If that's the case, what makes you believe NIO will refuse to comply?

I mean this is not only the biggest SPACE ever, its also the most appetizing (by a mile) to both short term traders that populate the swamp that is WSB as well the long term behemoths like Buffet and Klarman. I encourage you to provide some context for your action in staying away from this compared to other SPACs instead of populating the thread with what seems like just random emotion in the moment.

People gotta travel. Idk about cruises but airlines will come back eventually.
Bought zoom pre-covid due to a motley fool recommendation. It dropped around 15-20% and I was bagholding, around Jan or Feb. As soon as I got in the money I sold. Thought it was a shit stock.
R u just realizing this now?
Assuming the Europeans are holding long and that the majority bought at IPO. They’ve got nothing to lose. May shake off the bandwagon and paper hands but they’re scrubs anyway.
Yes.
Yeah that isn’t a real risk because it would fuck anyone who is already retired and those folks consistently vote.  Could see a tax on high frequency trading though.  Like half a percent or less per trade.  Wouldn’t be noticeable to the vast majority of us but would fuck with algo traders.
Broke a big resistance at 50, this range might not be the worst to DCA in. I’ve been buying since the spac and loaded another round when it broke through
I work closely with USX in my day job. Yes steel demand is up bigly this year but that company is a steamy pile of shit. I’ve walked through the USX mills and all of their equipment and processes are stuck in the stone age. They refuse to upgrade or invest in any of their facilities.
Long term, yes.
Short term, also probably yes.

Crossing my fingers for apex to moon, I overpaid for my stocks on friday
I doub't you can catch the "spike" with a market limit sell order at some online broker. Chances are you sell after all institutional trader's algorithms with lvl 1 access at the stock exchange did their thing. So uch uncertainty in this strategy. If the price target of other big traders is below your very optimistic 500, you'll never sell
...that would suck. Not saying my numbers are high, but they are above average. 

Thankfully my hands would receive support so I could offset costs.
Lmfao he actually gave gold to bot 😂💀
Read the fine print though. You have to meet certain rules before you can touch your earnings without a penalty or tax.
I ate about 5000 mg of edibles in 2 weekends.
This thing is in the news constantly with all the Airbnb and Stripe rumors. Not sure what you read but try Bloomberg or Bloomberg Terminal...

That’s why it’s 25% over NAV with months before anything substantive will be announced
the people who normally never get a chance to own something like this at such a high percentage

Normally the 'good stuff' is gobbled up by massive institutional buyers and insiders and we are left fighting over scraps (10% of the float).

Now its reversed and the big guys dont like that, they will try to shake us out over then next 1-6 months as cheaply as possible.

Some guy bought calls at a 3000 strike when they were 2200 each (before the split) not sure when they expire.
Excellent point. Do you think Warren Buffet would miss out on a Tontine structure, if we assume he has interest in Stripe? Once you assume he has interest in the company in a fundamentals and long term way, the cost discount the warrant structure provides is something almost designed for value investors like Buffet and Klarman. This is not to say they don't have private stakes at present. Both can be true. But to miss out on a 2/9 or 3/9 or 4/9 stake is not how these guys get to where they are. Rely on the fundamental facts only.
Lol for real that's one of the last places I'd want to retire.
Anyone else feel like TSLA is free money until the S&P inclusion?
Yea for sure

The only fair measure is dollars lost v dollars gained.
I very much like NIO and was playing it up until ER. I plan to get back in after the holidays and IV, hopefully, comes down a bit. I’m hoping the eyes are on Tesla.
Why do I think that every single one of you pumping up PLTR with post after post of it bought at 20+? 

And now you're worried that you won't be able to get that sweet lambo just because you trusted some Internet nephew...
Of THCbeee, PSTH, and PIC which SPAC you like best?
because?
Not really. Theta gang wins the last months with aapl
To be honest, I think airlines are dead long term. Was looking for some one to say im wrong. I live in a cruise city. If cruises don’t recover that does not bode well for my long term well being.
hmmm interesting
[deleted]
[removed]
There's the cold bite of reality. Nice analysis tho. It does seem unlikely that it would suddenly jump and there's a reason the IV is so low. Like one other commenter said, this play would've worked if you could've timed the exact bottom (108ish a month ago or 113 a week ago).

Definitely not a YOLO for me, but something small and maybe interesting if it happened

Fuck outta here 🏳️‍🌈🐻
Sweet, good luck my dude!
400 shares and a couple 25p sells here. Unconvinced it's stripe, but convinced it won't be a dud
Do you think tech isn’t also going to be in the future lol
God bless you, and the huge fucking gains coming your way
Even Ackman said they weren’t ready for it. Wake up lol
and the point is to value NIO at $100 billion NOW is to say you think they will be selling a million cars a year in what 3,4,5 years from now?
I’m holding NIO shares. Nothing in PLTR. This is just my view on the whole situation since I’m seeing a lot of posts on and outside of WSB about a lot of people being screwed last week.
The most recent shingles vaccine is two doses and knocks a lot of people on their ass the day after, and people have been getting those in droves since its release.
Airbnb rejected PSTH within a month. Bloomberg rejected them immediately. Stripe hasn’t yet. Why?
The PLTR shares are in a short or put position, right?
That’s how I started. Started yoloing $500-1000 and getting 200-300% returns and gradually getting more confident in the plays
84 by mid dec
Your cock will be so big and so heavy you’ll have to strap it to your fuckin leg

Let's go!  I'm in at 10.40 and sitting on 2500 warrants at 1.75, let's ride this bitch
Mostly because I dont know what they are trying to gain.
This is quality
People here are so confident PLTR will go back up Monday. Europeans ran PLTR up on Thursday and the U.S. sold it off. Everybody is assuming the Europeans are happy about that and will buy this up.
Can bears post more??  And more Bears DD? I really would like to see diversification in WSB.
None of that is relevant if Stripe gets this funding and ends up with a 70-100B valuation. Its not going to be Stripe

Not going anywhere
And there’s this fucking robomod to regulate content you don’t like you fucksticks.
Then just hold past Monday? Lol
I wouldn’t. Cyclical is overbought and we may see a small correction like 5-10%. Even at a 5% you won’t have time to recover if it happens. 

I think there’s more downside risk versus potential upside until the election in January is finalized. 

What is your target price for amazon at the eoy?

There’s probably other plays for you to dump 10k on a contract before end of year.

I think Nio is now up to 5000?  XPEV is 3000.
look at short shares issued. There are more short shares than outstanding shares. It’s the highest all time. Over 100%. If you know how shorts work, these people HAVE to buy back in. If we keep Gme goin up aka don’t get paper hands. It will in theory infinity squeeze out the shorts and we make a fuck to ton.

This dude is clueless. He says Airbnb is an unlikely (but possible target) when they already filed their S-1 and their IPO roadshow starts Tuesday for an IPO in two weeks. There is no chance they are using a SPAC as the news articles going all the way back to like August indicated.

Similarly, Stripe is not going to use a SPAC and Ackman and the Collison brothers have both said it’s not going to happen but you insist on pumping lies just like with the Airbnb merger.

PSTH is a fine investment but it went up too quickly on these lies. 25% over NAV when a target announcement isn’t even coming until next year (per Ackman) because everyone wants Stripe or Airbnb 😂
No... the insane valuation of Tesla of $500 billion actually implies they are projected at some point to be selling millions of cars.  depending how you value other aspects I'm sure the projection is in the neighborhood of 3 million cars a year in about 3-4 years.  Do you understand valuation?  In growth stocks it doesn't correspond to now it corresponds to future estimates in theory discounted by some factor of certainty.

No, 22 look at its debut price, it’s never even hit 20
you are again basing that on valuation solely and just outright ignoring any potential upside that Stripe would realize with not giving over controlling interest. They clearly like the private piece. This whole anti-ackman thing is also beyond insane to me. He's a relatively younger investor with an exemplary couple of years here. Yes, he has made errors but I think if you go back and watch some of the recent interviews he's given and things he's written he's like an investor AI. He touts Buffet ideology non-stop and since implementing changes that have steered PSCM back to basics has realized a 50% and 60% year in addition to arguably one of the single greatest trades in history last spring.

Your underlying logic that Stripe is even in a position to have to budge is flawed. With what evidence do you say that they have outright declined a deal? Again the timeline of Ackman's comments and the movement just days and weeks later by Stripe hiring team \*could\* be coincidence. How do you square the entire circle though - SQUARE execs being head hunted by PSTH? Further, even if your baseless conclusions (based seemingly entirely on repeating the fact that Stripe is a big company and one of the C bros liked a tweet) is correct and they declined an initial offer, we all know negotiations are fluid.

If you haven't done the necessary work of watching the Ackman Bloomberg video from Sept that outlines in clear terms why any company (Stripe, Bloomberg, SpaceX) would find interest in this set up, then you can't just spout stuff like that imo. Thats my answer.
[removed]
Yes sir! Got calls for short term gains and I'm holding shares for long term gains as well. LETS FUCKING GOOO
Possible but most holders feel GME will eventually go BK- buy, wait for the pop, then sell and enjoy- not a long term, forever hold
That flight looks like it got cancelled man. Imo shorts covered and not too many buyers left. I realize the gurus at citron gave 100 pt, but i think it pulls back to 31 at least then maybe bounce off and go higher, or it could fuxking dump. Watch out around 31 cuz if it goes lower it is going looooweer
You wanna make some money PLTR puts
The priced in argument is a meme in itself at this point. 

I agree that it’s definitely time to get some June+ calls on recovery though.
Lol hope she leaves your pathetic ass before this bull shit
Exactly. I've actually sold some over-valued calls, which are now getting close to being itm so I've had to cover with shares. I find it more probable the stonks dump than rise in January, sadly my sold calls are for dec18. :) Oh well, shares will be called away, I'll sell something like NCLH 30-35 and CCL 27-35 on the top and load up on shares when they dump in Jan...

I agree with you, people are not counting in the debt and dilution of shares they are doing and expect the value to rise to the levels before rona.
Can i be one of your friends? Or may be even family ;)
Hopefully its not homeless sleeping since no one goes there.

Hate to say this again but if you’re playing PLTR in the short term, less than a month, you should be quite concerned a singular tweet “crucified” the stock. 

I think PLTR would be worth investing, yes investing, for the long term but anyone playing anything up until EOY is now fucked IMO and no amount of rocket ships or Left memes is gonna change that.

Wait what? If I buy a call and then sell it 2 weeks later for profit can I be obligated to exercise to my buyer? What? I thought it was the original creator of the call that was obligated to do that?

I diamond hands my positions when I’m down big and paper hands them when I’m up small. Screwed me over so many times. I remember first time playing TSLA I bought 2 puts and sold them at break even because all the swings made me nervous. 20 minutes later Musk tweeted the stock was too high...
The one aking canoo public looks like it might actually catch on. Futuristic af while not looking entirely gey
Inverse this for tendies
Nowhere in any of my comments did I say it was the “only” reason. I said some of the movement during this leg higher was due to short covering. The short interest chart laid over Tesla’s chart would show it as well with the sharp drops in short interest resulting from multiple squeezes throughout this year.
It's not anytime, it's when RSI hits fever pitch, which is the signal to scale out of anything.

you sound awful
Currently holding AMZN, BABA, THC🐝, and H🍪A🍪. This week is gonna be funnn
if you use toyota then you understand that toyota's price to sales is 1:1 right.  so $100 billion market cap mean $100 billion in revenue.  that's pretty close to the industry average.  total car sales is only about $1 trillion and hasn't really increased much over the last several years.  and isn't projected to go up much either, just shift to EVs.  but still that's only $1 trllion in market cap to spread around which is why iti's ridiculous to bid Tesla up to $500 billiion and all these startups getting pushed up to insane valuations relative to production and actual projections.

Its one of my biggest positions so far and I'm pretty excited about it! May we all get tendies this week!

i think there will be a pop up.  longer term play for sure
I'm 100 shares in.  Holding long term.

You think that’s the only reason why Tesla could move not based on fundamentals lol. Really? The biggest meme stock to ever exist in all of human history and the only way it could move not off of fundamentals is a short squeeze? Confirmation bias

They did. And US administration said they are giving them until December 4 with no further deadlines. 
Although it’s technically possible it could be extended again, I believe this will be the final deadline and China will OK the deal.
The shorts don't collect premiums. The lenders do. And concerning the "indefinite amount of shares" comment: they don't need to actually borrow shares, just make a cash settled contract. That's why short ratios can exceed 100%.

This is truly the dumbest thing I’ve read today.

If I made a shit tone of money of GME id go into the store someday with a box of doughnuts and a thank you card.
Of all the SPACs, you've been shying away from the biggest with the most promise??
Ahh the decision process is still 'WSB' based in the sense that we are looking for massive growth and trying to capture it cheaply.

I made a bunch in FSLY and other stocks along the way but did not employ this tactic and have regretted it.

You are at a great age for this approach because you should be all about risk (reasonable not yolo risk) and not about cash preservation. You have time on your side.

So the goal here is to listen to all these tards, do some of your own research quickly and not fence sit and pull the trigger on these cheap stocks that have potential.

In the beginning you take risky positions and once you get to a number that you like, 1k 5k 10k 50k, then take 70-100% of the profit on those positions and immediately roll that into either LEAPS 2+ years out or shares if you want a more conservative approach. I go with LEAPS and plan to convert those to shares within 6-9 months. 

I go with ITM LEAPS not OTM LEAPS, they cost more but not as much as the shares and try to do this as quick as possible, don't wait until the stock runs up into the 40-50s because at that point you would have too much downside risk.

Notice how each step reduces risk, first 2-4 weeks is high risk ATM or OTM weekly to 60ish days out on the expirations. Then we take profits and move to safer 2+ year leaps then after 6-9 months take the LEAPs and move to shares, reducing risk further. Still at any point things can crash but they are free rolls so you can stay in them unless you need the cash which you should not be needing at all.

So nothing special, the strat can still fail miserably by striking out on the original attempts but I think it works well.

At your age you should be taking shot after shot and hustling on the side to fund each shot. The key here is once you hit a winner and convert to leaps then to shares is not to touch those winners and let them run. You will be a broke college student with 100k sitting in a meme stock and so good luck not touching it lol, you will WANT to sooooo bad, you will want to back when its 15k and 10k even.

Good luck :)

Absolutely.  I try to remember it was a good lesson in the long run, always take profits and don't  risk everything on a single trade. It's hard not to look back and get discouraged at what could have been, but that thought pattern will kill you in the long run.

Where can we find info about which SPACs are for which mergers?
If you read the entirety of the DD, I go into this a bit. The press has largely not been paying this service. This isn't really all that uncommon. I think being steered by the available facts as they exist is more important than hanging your hat on the fact that the SPAC has received relatively little press. Klarman and Guggenheim putting this amount of funding into a SPAC \*should\* have generated more news and I think in a more quiet climate (election, covid second wave, etc), it would have. Look to the next few weeks to be reading more about this. The fact that there hasn't been a great DD on WSB yet is telling.
doesn't even matter if it is $10,000 a year, he will still be stuck with the tax for 2020 and will need to come up with money to pay by april even if he loses it all between jan 1 and april 15
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board has a 6% ownership (these guys are one of the largest institutional investors in the world).PSTH has a significant 69% institutional ownership which I assume would mean that these institutions know more than we do about PSTH and if this were a shitty stock, we wouldn't see this level of ownership.

If the stripe thing picks up, the speculation alone may spike the price up.
Honestly I feel something huge is brewing. Don’t be surprised if we gap up tonight. 2020 is gonna end with a bang 💥
Can someone please explain to me what the he’ll people are doing to make all of this money?

For sure, I'm just saying Us Steel already has capacity in place to ramp up production quickly, so if for example there's a big infrastructure package in the next few months, they will go up a lot more due to significantly increased output. 

I agree as a buy and hold for 5 years, CLF will probably get there.

Yeah, exactly. The bottom here is $20. Get out of here with this $10 misinformation. Keep your eyes fixated on the facts of the case only. While I am leaning heavily towards a stripe merger here, even suppose it wasn't stripe, this vehicle is easily the most attractive SPAC every conceived. Its also the largest, most investor-friendly, and gigantic and well-respected firms are just sinking their teeth into it in recent weeks in a very quiet way with next to no mainstream press coverage yet. If Klarman, Guggenheim and potentially Buffet are knee deep, with what case do you argue against this as at least a reasonable play up to the announcement?

So many price upgrades on NIO since the Left article. I’m still thinking NIO could see $65-$75 by year end. That said, PLTR could consolidate a bit more before returning to ATH. I was assuming it would see $41 before a bigger pullback, but Citron effed shit up again, so it’s gonna need a bit more breathing room before it sees $41. Left basically crucified the stock in the short term, but he’s full of shit 99% of the time and banks know this and will probably start releasing price upgrades in the next couple weeks lol.

I still have no idea how to use the vote bot. Where is it in the app
539 people say otherwise
Check it out right. And also like, I don't want to talk politics on here but someone brought it up and it's kinda related to finance so I will. The single thing fiscal conservatives hate the *most* culturally is single parentage and the dissolution of the nuclear family. They hate this because some way or another you still need to provide some minimal form of support framework for people who are down and out, because like it or not, economic growth depends on at least a fraction of these people producing children who will go on to belong to the managerial class and many of them continuing to support the economy. The way to do this without government intervention is to find new structures that force financial support to occur within this class, which is why child support is such a big deal in the US. Well, the problem is, a lot of people just don't get married or have kids, but you still need these people to buy things. So in Canada the solution is to create a new class of unmarried but socially wedded people who are then expected to financially support each other. 

I am neither Canadian or a whatever the hell you called me, nor do I think this guy should be tied to this girl just because they lived together a year. The Canadian government is using him as a cop out from having to step in and preventing him from securing a better life as a result because rather than looking out for his individual welfare they are using him to mitigate the expense of supporting the lady, who, like it or not, is a necessary economic stimulator. 

"Fuck the lady, she can starve," you say, but the fact is the economy still grows when people like her are in debt. Fiscal conservatives depend on people like her to maintain their class.

This is a big deal bc it moves the timeline up quite a bit and I don’t think that’s baked in to the price.

People chasing such a low quality company like GME makes me convinced that we are near bubble highs.

Which is done better and faster on the market. The market determines where capital would be spent most effectively while the government can only divert wealth into what they determine it needs to be spent on while ignoring all market signals. Anything that's not a consumption tax is the government over stepping it's boundaries.
my palantir is growing at the thought of it
I think the issue with Apple, a lot of people use to be 100% diversified (I know this technically isn't diversified) into Apple. No other stocks except Apple in brokerage accounts that were between 100k - 1million precovid. This was a very accepted investing strategy I saw many people utilize and it worked great. Why worry about what stocks you own each year when you can just hold apple every year for really good annual gains? But as the hype and hype started growing over the summer for other memes and value stocks these people took notice and started selling their apple positions to buy other stocks. So now they are only say 50% invested into Apple.

TLDR: My guess is Apple stays flat until the current mayhem that exists in the market calms down.

Wellll I got to a good gains update point. And will probably be posting that today. So close your eyes.
once PLTR is back at ATHs within a day or two thats all thats gonna be posted here again. That said, loaded to the titz with PLTR.
Thoughts on 24/Dec and 31/Dec calls? I’m thinking about going all in, which is just $8K but it’s my entire portfolio.
Respect, I had a $150k crash in there over the span of a few days. Good to have perspective on the down side and how fast it can turn
They have been an utter disappointment since I jumped in. I’m banking on sne. Got a handful of 97.5 1/15 that are printing

And who are you to say hedge funds have not set a limit buy for ZI come Tuesday? If you are throwing your capital based on a DD by a random dude who opened an account on reddit 2 months ago and who has never shared their position is all I need conclude who is a sheep :)
It looks like a bull put spread so he's losing money on the spread but still up 35 dollars from the premium collected.  If AMD drops much more then he'll be in the red for reals.
Buy a stock that was high and went down last week. It’s bound to pick up the steam again.
Does this yield gains? He says he’s buying the shares then buying a call and selling a put as well. So selling a put would offsets how much of the losses?
And? Maybe now but in the future we will see.

Yeah would be nice if the experts here would give us amateurs quick run down of call options. Hopefully something like PLTR will come along for us to make some 💵💵💵.On a different note, multiple ads for montley fool have appeared.Some of them say,They found stocks which has grown by almost 3000% over the past few years. Any experience with it? Anyone?
i’ve been holding GME positions (long calls and shares) since the DD in october. does anyone have a realistic price target for the squeeze? i’ve heard anywhere from $60 to $300

what are the chances of this being like the VW squeeze?
Is it because I’m posting in all caps or are my posts actually low quality shit they’re getting removed by the 🏳️‍🌈mods

Plot twist, he's a college professor
I think you are right on the fact that a lot of companies will give more interest to remote work 
Still, to me, (and I may be wrong :)  ) that does not mean REITs are gonna go bankrupt or in a really complicated solution because of it. They are companies just like the one that adapts to remote work, they rotate their properties , the type of properties they own & so on...hence the huge variation that already happened on their stock values. people may move to other cities, yet they will still lend a flat, a house, go to hospital, smoke weed, go to stores, hostel...which could be owned by a REIT mREIT. 
Also, there are REITs focused on specific businesses ( like houses, commercial, medical, weed growing and so on...) But in the end , at the time we're speaking, let's say 90% of them basically get most of their rents on the properties they own , even REITs that own properties they rent to hostel companies ( it's quite rare that a REIT gets paid 100% each months from what I've seen so far..there's and there will always be people/companies that need more time to pay for x reasons, pandemic or not) 
So in the end , what I'm really looking for when I look for REITs (again, I may be wrong) , is it's stock price compared to it's net asset value per share , it's management discussion in the 10-Q,  and it's dividend. If the stock price is under the net asset value ( nav ) and if they give a dividend , it means that they are undervalued based on what they own and based on the fact that they make money :) .
At least it's a little less spammy

Sir, this is a Wendy's...
Yeah.
I wonder if dumbass investors see “Oope the nfl got the covid” and it dips Monday.
I have a retarded question. Never bought a put before. at what price would PLTR have to fall for citron to make money? say they set the strike at $20 are they not OTM at their current position? wouldn’t the stock price have to fall lower then 20 to make money? or is it just calls that work this way? I feel like $$20 is a retarded target if the stock price is up past $30.  Would a $28-25 strike not be better? or is because the premium they choose such a low strike price?   ITM and OTM confuse me as far as puts go,
Trust that man
Same Hindenburg is the real deal
I got MJ calls to play the weed moves the next week. Playing individual shits like this is asked to get fucked by newly issued shares. Don’t forget these Canadian companies were all but broke 2 years ago. It’s going to be hard for them to not raise capital after having the stock price double. Check out ACB a couple weeks ago. Same thing is going to happen a couple times I assume

Im saying capacity was high for what i thought it and i think the stock is undervalued but you do you.
Ah yeah cash is definitely a very solid hedge. The one I use the most. But a couple puts can be cheap to go along with it. I’d never go all in on puts with no cash (unless I was a degenerate with like $100)

I was in Vegas over Halloween weekend and for Vegas it was dead.  We stayed at the Mirage and only half the restaurants were open.  The tables were severely limited by the Plexiglas limited tables and we still had no problem finding a spot at a blackjack or craps table on Friday and Saturday night.  We waited in line at one bar and that was on Halloween.  The airport was dead, it took us 10 minutes to get thru the security line.

We ate at Jaleo in the Cosmo Friday night at 8:30 with no reservation and it was half full.  Now more and more entire resorts are closing mid-week.  Even with limited places to stay most places are almost paying you to stay there.

MGM stock price has steadily crept up and is the highest it's been since pre-pandemic........just seems like a weird time.  You almost have to think it will dip before rising to pre-pandemic levels.
Far fetched as hell
Accumulating Jan 15 just out of the money calls to play earnings, shit is gonna print
Last earnings they dropped the run up was the week before.

There was a standing military sure, but the money today is on the equipment and tech
273/288 debit spread. I'm up 20% or so but I'd like to ride it out if there's a good chance of gains this week
I check stocktwits frequently.  It's 99.9% garbage, but sometimes someone will post an important fact about the stock or link to a news item.  Like some new investment or product or change of management whatever.  Or someone will recommend a similar high growth stock they are pumping.  I'll check those out and see if it's worth following.  I wish I had paid attention to SE months ago.
It’s a meme, and it will make a lot of people money in the meantime.
I dunno but I mentioned the initials $B$T$C (in another post and without the $$) and it got deleted cuz it's "too speculative"? Isn't that pretty funny?

Yeah I think so, 265 looks like support. 294 was also a resistance that wasn’t broken at first, but exceeded now. Looks to me like an ascending triangle, I could see calls paying off.
I haven’t been following but the only thing I can see as appealing is their real estate assets. They have locations everywhere.

Just a retarded play. I’m bullish on Apple especially coming up on earnings but you really believe it’s going to go up nearly 30%? Before Jan? Adding 600 billion to its market cap? Come on bruh

diamond hand my man
I’m just saying if you lose all your money being long on a drop, you can’t buy the dip. Cash is a fine hedge too
Yeah but back then it wasn't looking to good
Great work OP. You confirmed what I've been thinking for a while now. PLTR 🚀🚀🚀
And the new Sec of State (Blinken) and possible new Sec Def (Flournoy) are on the board of Pine Island Capital Management, which just started a Defense-oriented ess-P-ay-C (ticker PIPP). I hate to buy this shit but how else are us little people going to get in on the corruption?
How the market lookin rn 

I prefer to get updates from the wsb brethren instead of googling the market
I have 90 shares on Robinhood. Does anybody know how warrants works on there? I googled it and it was quite confusing
BABA 290c & PFE 39c for Dec18

Giddy up
It's filtering out "low quality posts." No wonder it's so dead in here now
I'm europoor too, I've lost so much money on CFD it's  funny. The price is extremely unpredictable due to Fridays events so I would stick with shares imo
Well he is a man that knows when an industry is about to crash.
Ya that’s a less retarded version of buying it cash, but to that I would say, it’s retarded to buy a luxury purchase that you can’t afford 100, or 1000 of. A 10,000 Camry does the same thing as the TSLA. If you buy the Camry for 10k and invest the rest you’d have 100k+ at the end of 5 years whereas if you buy the car you’d have spent $70k and have a 10-20k car left now. 

The difference between having 100k at the end of 5 years or essentially have 0, to someone who doesn’t even have 70k now is huge don’t you think?

true I just wanted to see the different strats on one page with the price targets to help decide
Feds fucked the guy he bought the trading platform from too. Poor dude was just taking on a client and building software and then he got dragged through the mud for years.
I dunno. All the stands warehouse employees are taking over the world, what better way to shut them up than by announcing a split to give more back to the workers? 

Also I realize this is already, or was, practiced via getting shares that are fully vested after 1-2 years.
BABA to 3000!
Its fun. Its such a small amount of money who gives a shit, maybe poors care i guess.
Yeah terrible advice I am currently leaving vegas at eoy and it’s not looking good for anyone here

1. Excellent analysis but I'm a retard.   


2. Do I buy or sell?   


3. Sounds like buy but see No. 1.
I'm going to need to look into that more, thank you!
Hey let me try: Fuck China
Rh does not offer warrants anymore. No warrants can be purchased and therefore no warrants will be exercised using Robinhood. You can, however, buy common stock on Robinhood.
Well I live in Belgium so similar.

Even then, if you’re investing then you’re reliant on the US market, which is government backed, which is funded by taxes.
It's all roses and gumdrops when the government targets your enemy as a terrorist, its another when it decides you are the potential terrorist.   

I value smaller government with less influence and power.

SMIC stole TSM tech and Beijing court ruled I favor of TSM with a 10% stake in SMIC as compensation. Obviously that doesn’t make up for the tech stolen but it’s a win in obviously biased Chinese court. What I’m saying is TSM could benefit indirectly from SMIC.
Depends on your strike. BABA is not gonna be delisted. I'm pretty sure they agreed to the audit terms back in spring.
you don't need PLTR to hit $40 to leave her my guy.
You start to sound like you don't know what a stop loss is.
What’s even the idea behind GameStop right now. Dying brick and mortar model that could see money once every four years when people wait outside for consoles?
Damn good luck man
Horrible. I owned stock before the crash when it was at 60 and giving dividends. When the market crashed I bought more thinking it would return in a few years. Then came government control and profit sweeps and I've been bag holding in a cave. I have close to 4k shares if it breaks 9.25 I'll break even. I'm hoping for 25 and would love anything above 30 in the next couple years.
PSTH started at $20, other spacs start at $10. I’m saying a 25% increase  isn’t unheard of in terms of spacs.
I bought a chunk last week @$20/share. So far, other than rising up to $20.80 and falling back to ~$20, it hasn't done much. But I'm holding onto this one long-term.
You could give jelqing a shot, then buy AAPL calls
Well you guys wanted to take my post about GME being old pervs but that’s prob because y’all are too
I agree. The claymore is the best weapon in the game to me
Those dark pool buys 👀👀
That guy Nav from the " wild ride of the 50m Flash Crash Trader." video is not only kinda inspirational, he is the definition of "its just numbers on a screen bro" mentality. Was making 3 times the value of his parents house in a day and still living in the same bedroom.

Hahahahaha wait what 😅😅😅
UPWK, FIVR, and a number of privately held firms are the future.  


This work from home secular trend is the deathknell of the upper-middle, lower-upper class (i.e. "slaves in white collars", thank you Tyler Durden). Right now it seems great, get paid 75K - 250K+ doing a couple of hours of work a week on average (ex crisis or busy periods). And if you're in software dev, a PM, etc.; you even have time to pick up some extra work on the side (or gambool on 0dte options).  


But the salad days will be short lived. The next big trend will be offshoring as many of those rolls as possible to people in other countries who will do the same job, 90% as well, for 1/5th to 1/10th the salary. It's called "global labor arbitrage" and it's been an ongoing trend for decades now. It's mainly impacted the middle to lower end worker up to now, but with the sudden and rapid shift to "telecommuting" (which C-level people all agree is here to stay), hallowing out economic prospects of the upper-middle and lower-upper - and redistributing it UPWARDS - has begun.  


See you in the bread lines, gents. Careful with the "meat" they offer, heard they'd been grinding up the dead boomers and reconstituting the organic matter as "happyburger".
I'm excited to watch BABA run soon and then see everyone act like there was no way of knowing that was gonna happen.
17% no longer gets me off. I need +100%
Bloomberg probably solid but not very sexy.
wsb is bullish on tech again. IV and prices are really good on large caps.

Bruh.

Thank you.
Very pleased to see a ticker and 🚀 on top of the dd
I hate going short, but you’re right that it seems to have bounced off this level 5 times steady
Based on upvotes id say a dozen bakers dozen (rounded for simplicity..... also mafs)
You are asking a bunch of idiots who's main trading strategies consist of "line go up, I buy" or "line go down maybe one day line go back up" to explain a complex hedging strategy employed by options dealers holding billions of dollars of risk.

It's tough holding on red days, stomach churns, lose faith.  And then on a couple green days too easy to talk yourself into taking some profits and not letting the stock run.  I'm about to test myself with MGNI.  Had a nice run last week.  My friend took his profits Friday.  I'm letting it go this week and hoping to break into the 20s.  If it goes red on Monday I'm going to be freaking out all day.  I try to pick target prices and target dates ahead of time to make decisions.
Let me give you a DD. This vote isn't going to pass because this kind of thing should be done by STATE level. If CA/OR/WA want weed, they can legalize it and they did. Why would some senator from CA be able to tell an Indiana person they can smoke weed if their state doesn't want legalized weed?
I have pltr and apex, and Tesla, most of it it's on tesla
I haven't seen this kinda squeeze since 1999 when Mick Foley fought Undertaker in Hell In A Cell

Been asking this like every other day but is there still hope for BABA by 12/11?

I did the math based on a weighting of 1.5%. At the time analysts estimated the weighting they used 1.3%. But TSLAs share price exceeded BKH which calls for a revised weighting. Changes to the S&P, and each different listing’s market cap call for index funds to reallocate.

Everyone is setting this up for failure pumping it to be Stripe. It 100% will not be so it needs to stop.

Did you see all the red states that legalized? It’s really just bitch McConnell. I think if it was a fair vote there’s enough bipartisan support to get it passed. Republicans focus on guns and abortion now. They kind of stopped caring about weed because they knew it was losing them votes
I disagree, the drop gives you a better entry point if you have cash on hand but it’s difficult to time of course. With puts you even make money or at least hedge losses while it falls too
Lol that’s pennies compared to the stocks inflation. I bet a couple autists cashed out 14 million at the PLTR casino this week alone.
That’s how you trade? LMAO. 

You sell your cost and take profit and let it run.

You are only “letting it run” cause you don’t give a fuck what happens to the stock. If it goes up, GREAT, if it goes down, you’re still ok.

nothing without risk. If you are feeling well leaving that 50%-100% (conservative) behind, then thats your risk assessment. I think others view this for what it is. I also don't mean to commit an obvious fallacy here, but do you really think Seth Klarman is going to take a 200M hit on this? Here's a Klarman quote in case you are unfamiliar with his brain: 

"We clear a high bar before making an investment, and we resist the many pressures that other investors surely feel to lower that bar. The prospective return must always be generous relative to the risk incurred. "

Tbf a lot of permanent bears are looking for -40% crashes for their puts. Would take years to recover from that.
ACB will be bankrupt soon, or require more dilution. CGC is a big dog as is APHA. For US I would look at MSOs like GTI, Curaleaf, Trulieve, Cresco Labs.

I made 100% already on Jan 2022 call leaps, sold on Wednesday.  I had 500 shares as well, which I'm going to buy back.  I look at VALE as a 5 year EV/TSLA play on nickel, but if news ever hits that TSLA has invested in or made a deal with them it'll probably blast off and I'll sell immediately when it does.
Yes, goooooood, consolidate at this new level!

strike needs to be near the money or far out. If it is an FD and 50% OTM then banks will not delta hedge their short call position. they will just collect your premium and laugh at you. highest probability call you can afford. otherwise just buy shares.

I’ve been in fb 295 12/24 this week. Might roll it into 300 1/15s
Yes it has and I've avoided it for the past few months as well now. Money has been going into memes with some periodic rotation into recovery plays. Feels like a lot of memes are almost out of steam and if the general market is to keep climbing higher, I gotta believe some more money has to go into stuff like AAPL and FB

I am. I am not trying to jump too far in. I’ve been making 2/300 just the last few weeks from stock trades. Sorta how I am funding my dip into the options market. For instance I just went through the Greeks and learned the equation for implied volatility that shows me the +\- for the time span of my option. A little confusing but I think I’m getting it. Appreciate all the knowledge. Hopefully PLTR makes its way back up by the 12-11

Definitely true, and I don’t know what the exact type of stock compensation is here. Could be RSUs, SARs, ESPPs, but I haven’t dug into the idea beyond just the comment. Do we know when the $94 million vested (if it did yet)? That would help determine what the basis is (that will go towards compensation) versus what growth would either be income versus a long term capital gain if held.

I’m probably overthinking whether even this has a tangible effect, but fuck it.

Ya saw something that nclh can’t go above $40...but ccl is already talking about buybacks. To my mind it doesn’t see, like there’s anything that’s going to have the same 1 year growth.

I wonder if things are going to further explode on the 10th with vaccine approval (or tomorrow with uk vaccine approval guaranteeing us approval) or if this run up will drop because herd immunity is still 6mo to a year away.

Makes no sense. Kill yourself for 60 percent of your lifespan to gamble on enjoying the back 20 that are not guaranteed because of age and sickness. Fuck all that enjoy today cuz tomorrow is not guaranteed.
Further, the warrant has a 5 year expiry, and again, as the DD shows, is not capped at 2/9. The more buyers who jump ship before the merger, the more warrants those who stay behind are going to receive. This type of scheme is right up both a value investor (Klarman/Buffet) and a RobinHood investor's ally for obvious reasons. I anticipate that the quiet press phase will end this or next week. CNBC has barely mentioned anything since July - Ackman on record saying they are targeting an end of 2020 announcement (within 6 mo of IPO in July) and a merger in Q1.

AAPL hasn't even attempted to test $130 since the September high. IV on contracts are some of the lowest I've ever seen. And the NASDAQ is higher than it was on Sept 2nd. Any reason to think that megacap tech is about to get some love? The returns on this would be excellent even if AAPL only jumped like 7%

I'm in for commons (at 21), warrants (at 7.50) January 25c and 35c, and March 25c. Up about 25% at the moment. Even if the haters are right, the speculation about Stripe will drive prices up significantly through January. I think it's likely that Stripe is entertaining the possibility - but those IPO-related hires may in fact be working on a non-SPAC IPO, who knows?

Options and stocks are different and only correlated.

When you BUY options your risk ends at the premium you paid. You're simply paying for the "option" to buy or sell the underlying. You in turn can sell your option you already own to someone else and the risk ends unless you exercise your "option".

When you sell options for premiums its different. Just know the difference and you'll be fine. Take your time.

I believe you have to wait 30 days post merger and the stock above $36 for 10 days or something like that. We are guessing here but given recent SPACs and given the absolutely unique structure of this SPAC (HUGE insurance against sell off with the 2/9 warrant) the odds of a jump to the $50 range in the short term isn't unlikely.
IANALorCPAorACCOUNTANTorTaxPerson:

Let's say you're a total idiot on Nov 4 and buy some PLTR ridiculously OOM calls that expire on Dec 6. Conincidentally, the market forgot to take its crazy pills and the stock has basically tripled by Nov 25. You just made $200k off of the change you found in your couch.   
   
Now, because this was definitely skill and not luck, you decide that you're going to do the same thing and buy $100 calls expiring Jan 8.  
  
By Dec 23rd jt's clear that you're a dumbass and you've lost basically everything. It doesn't ruin your Christmas though because you rationalize it as "house money" since you're a fucking addict and couldn't get back up off the floor if you actually thought about loosing $200k. You let it play out until expiry and end up one couch cushion poorer than you were in October.   
   
Wrong. As far as Uncle Sam is concerned, your $200k loss doesn't count yet. You had $200k of income in 2020 and he wants 25+% of it. You're couch cushion now cost you $50k. (But you'll get to carry forward $200k for 2021+ if Uncle Sam is nice)

If you had sold your options at $.03 each on December 23rd and eaten the $200k loss, you'd be able to use the loss against the gains and have $0 income and $0 tax liability.   
   
(Also, don't be "smart" and sell then buy back to take the loss this year. That's called a wash sale and Uncle Sam thought of it long before you did. Idk how they work across years but you probably don't want to find while Uncle Sam is auditing you with a digital exam.)

All of them have raised capital by selling more shares (aka dilution).  I saw something a couple weeks ago saying CCL has increased the amount of existing shares by like 40% during the pandemic.

CCL has more upside because they have higher risk.
Probably. I remember seeing some solid DD on it 2-3 months ago and added it to my watchlist for a bit, but never played it, and eventually deleted it. Saw another DD post on it recently, so I went and checked it and damn...

u/h20man1, putting your entire life savings into Tesla right now is about the safest bet you can make. I would have preferred you do this 2 weeks ago when they made the S&P announcement. I sold everything I owned and put all my savings into TSLA the minute I heard about it.

People here probs will judge me for not YOLOing it all on PLTR... 

I’m not saying TSLA is going to explode, but if the S&P having to buy over 100 million shares on or after 12/21 means anything to you, then yes it’s probably going to explode.

Stonks only go up here but in the real world, stonks in the S&P are a whole lot less likely to not go up. If it does drop it will be to below the post 12/21 prices but I certainly don’t see TSLA dropping to below pre S&P announcement prices. 

TSLA is here to stay. It’s overvalued, sure, but anyone with money in TSLA actually wants it to succeed and wants the things it is planning for the world.

If you missed out on buying AAPL in the 80’s or 90’s, TSLA is your next chance. I can promise you that... unless daddy Elon dies of coldvid or gets pancreatic cancer. That would fucking suck. 

Do it. Go all in. Especially in terms of *this sub*, there’s never been a safer bet, IMO.

But since you’re new here, I’m not a financial advisor and you sure as fuck shouldn’t listen to me.

BUT.

No word on earnings. Est was 27 Nov. 

Keep that in mind.
I have seen this line of argument before and I do respect it. I think, however, there is a flaw to some extent. Your argument really would be made stronger if this was a conventional SPAC where you're talking about enveloping the entire (or near entire private equity of the company). The PSTH SPAC notably doesn't do that, its not fixated on control of the company and its specifically targeting companies that have their shit together and wouldn't require activist intervention that Ackman is known for. AKA, Stripe, Bloomberg, etc. The talk of valuation, while important, is also less relevant given this SPAC set-up. Both the minority stake and the Tontine structure add an angle that is attractive for both PSTH and a company like Stripe. Ackman outlines the play along these lines well here:

"Sellers are much more price sensitive when selling 100% or even a controlling interest in their business for obvious reasons. A seller’s price sensitivity declines, however, when they are selling a smaller interest that allows them to achieve other important strategic objectives. We therefore expect that a potential PSTH merger partner will be much less price-sensitive in a transaction in which it, in effect, sells a minority interest in a merger with PSTH, which also allows it to raise $5 billion of equity capital and retain control of a newly public New York Stock Exchange listed company."

The argument you are making can be made. But there exists a world where the facts you present on valuation exist, and where this unique structure is beneficial to a company like Stripe. To suggest that Ackman adds nothing though, that's just not supported at all.
No why is school your life meaning

I live in LV. I believe you are wrong on many levels.The weekend is the busiest due to all the broke "weekend warriors" coming from neighboring states looking to ball on a budget. These people are not spending money like pre-covid, and not tipping any of the industry casino workers. The hotels from Monday-Thursday are a complete ghost town with only a handful of dealers actually working the tables. There is more crime and more violence going on from these discount weekend warriors looking to flex their tiny little egos. In addition, certain casinos/restaurants just recently are closing during the week days due to lack of people visiting and spending money.

This is why poor people are poor. Faced with the simple task of getting 70k, the subject is utterly defeated before even beginning. Hypothetically speaking, if he had 70k, he would blow it on a car. So even if he ever makes any money, he’ll never build wealth, and will be stuck in the bottom floor of society forever, until he dies.
So instead of actually trying to learn you shit up 1.6 millions peoples' sub?

Very nice. What platform is this?
Yes. I am am about 100% cash now. I sold everything before the recent soaring in pot stock. Like you said I wanna focus on the next play. I don’t wanna FOMO in pot stocks. I read a lot on GME. It looks like legit to me. Cause I’m a big gamer myself. Lol.

Could there be a big short due to the possibility of hiking gains taxes in the next admin?  
 Take your gains on the current tax and start over next year fresh.  Shorting your own stock in that sense might be hindsight of a sell off before the year is up for possible tax purposes.   Maybe they have full intentions to unload to cash EOY?    Make sense or retard?   I'm no accountant.  I'm just enjoying the rhetoric and insight from the sidelines.
Yeah definitely, I’m picking up APHA calls Monday. Maybe CRON too or even MSOS for a safe play

Correct, right now it is cheaper to just pay up if your use cases aren't so simple you could just throw your artifacts in an S3 bucket.

Is UPWK just gonna keep climbing to like 200 while the autists pay it no mind

TSCM bag holder checking in. This is a solid stock that has bigger lines of clients at their door than Pamela Anderson’s Rub’n’Tug saloon. Also technically they are forerunners, they just announced 3nm chip production in 2022 and probably apple has reserved most of its production for M2. Why that matters? China, with their deep pockets, tried to spin off several foundries and allegedly stole lots of TSCM staff and all they got was 7nm, consider that as a failure. It will take years before anyone will get even close to their technological advancements. Meaning you will get annual free ride of about 50-60% gains.

Can’t say I called it but I had a feeling PLTR would crash a bit after seeing 100 comments about people telling their family to buy it at thanksgiving. Not to say it won’t keep mooning. 

Not gonna lie I made money off PLTR and GME but I’m out of my positions as of Friday until I see a better opportunity to buy more calls. Until then I’m all in on CRM. Gonna go bankrupt.

WSB isn't for learning stocks or options for that matter, tired of seeing post like this.
You are right to say there is a lot of uncertainty here. Ackman has cleared debt in PSCM and his letter cites a number as high as $30B stake. So the exact % sure, it may fluctuate. "  As PSTH is targeting a company with a post-merger market cap of $15 billion to as much as $30 billion or more, the Sponsor Warrants could become a material asset to PSH. " - his letter to investors.
If you want to take $250,000 dollars off of an investment yearly AND also keep the principal growing you cannot take more than 4% yearly, More realistically you should only take out 3% a year.

first yolo? what are you a cat with 9 lives? 🤌🏻😂
I would recommend june-ish expirations with ITM strikes. Like many stocks in this industry these companies creep up slowly, but can lose a month of gains on a single day of bad news. If something happens between now and the top of the squeeze you guys could become bagholders.

If your expirations are further out, you can wait another month and your get your gains back.
yes this is going to happen to us IF.....

here’s the thing. for this short squeeze to work u have to buy shares AND actually hold onto them.  so if it dips 3% one day you pussy paper handed fucks need to not sell and just hold onto them.

unfortunately a lot of u bitches jumping ship from pltr are proof of being paper handed bitches after that fake ass citron report. look in the mirror and tell yourself you want to actually make money and stop being a short sighted poor fuck that’s giddy from making $20. LETS GO.
How high is too high?
[removed]
It hit 15 for a couple days in oct.  then dropped back down around 10-12 and hung around there until last wk.  considering earnings is coming up in 1.5 wks, it will hold or go up more at least until then.  Since IV is up, there might be pull back, but it won’t go below 10-12 if there is a big crush.  I’m guessing if it goes up to 20 before earnings it will dip to find support at 15 at worst case scenario.   As long as GME can sustain a price above 15 beyond earnings I think it will force a lot of hands.  But who knows...we had a chance to really squeeze in oct but it dropped in price and then more piled on due to lower cost to borrow...it has to keep the price up to where it is at now .

I've been a part time lurker for years, but really got into things with you guys in March, so I don't want to act like an old timer, but this sub was a lot different prior to even just a month ago.  GME and PLTR have been meme'ing for weeks now, months even, I mean fuck guys there are a lot more than just two fucking stonks out there.  You guys have wrapped up all your capital into one fucking play while missing out on everything else.

I've been paying on my loans for 14 fucking years and still have $16k left, but I kept paying throughout the whole year because payments are going 100% to principal balance.

I pray that we get at least some kind of forgiveness because when I looked 5 years ago I had already paid what I borrowed plus about $5k. $250-300 per month for the last 5 years means I paid at least another $15k. (I had multiple loans and paid one of them off which decreased my payment at some point in there.)

Kids that are graduating now are wayyyy in over their heads. If they don't get aggressive or get forgiveness they'll be paying those things off for literally their entire life. I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here, but FUCK that shit. I can't believe the government makes so much money off students.

When you buy-to-open an options contract there are three ways to close the position:

1. Sell-to-close (for a profit when the premium is higher than what you purchased it at | for a loss when the premium is lower than what you purchased it at)
2. You exercise the option
3. The contract expires worthless

When your position is closed you are off the hook for anything.
Nobody would, except the truly autistic.

Probably. That has to be worked out. Shares might become warrants.
If they are still at big discount vs pre pandemic level, they are probably not crowded trade yet.  Crowded trade is when the tickets are mentioned on WSB like 50+ times a day.  When everyone and their mom is buying something, that's usually when you take profit.
It’s all about the squeeze.

Don't worry about it.  Once you buy to close, you are completely off the hook.  Magic fairies will take care of it.
bruh PLTR makes less money now than it did before lmao.
I was not worried, Tesla does not even advertise its vehicles and still sells as many as it can make. Unlike established brands, they don't have an expectation of selling millions of vehicles, they just had to sell \~100K per quarter to meet or exceed expectations. Tesla is also not constrained by in-person dealership networks (a liability at the beginning of the pandemic) and sells seamlessly online w/ touchless delivery. If anything, people would be more likely to invest in a Tesla due to this. Also, being able to charge at home and not go to a public gas station is another boon during a pandemic.

If you want the short squeeze to happen, literally EVERYONE in this sub needs to buy shares (a lot of shares) when they buy calls. FORCE the SP up, forcing the shorts to cover.

This is the way.

Please god make it a -40% week for all meme stocks
Here is a more clear cut answer. If you buy a call or a put, and you sell it, it’s in someone else’s hands. Im pretty sure people don’t wait til exp to sell it back to the market, at least I never have. It’s the person who wrote the contract who is responsible for the 100 shares if someone decides to excercise. If you see someone talking about “being assigned” it means that someone who bought the contract decided to excercise it. If you have positive returns on it and you let it expire, the broker will close your position and it will be sold to someone who wants it in theory, but the main thing here is you are gonna sell it before expiration unless it’s like a 0dte spy contract.

I also thought I needed to have the 100 shares initially to trade options but you only need them if you are to WRITE the contract also know as “theta gang”

People are dumb, the higher the price goes the more people have to cover their shorts. Who cares if people covered at 7. There’s people who shorted from 50 on down.
He’s electricity, will always look for the shortest path to success w/o thanking the people who helped him get there along the way.
Theres a big *if* it will pass, mind you this week it's going to Congress. Then it's got to go before Do Nothing Mitch and a currently Republican controlled Senate. At that point, it is up to the states as to whether or not they want to peruse decriminalization/recreationalization. Many, I believe, will continue with the Watch and Observe method, seeing how current states that have already done so will fair. Some I dont think will give a damn and continue current restrictions. So I'm not expecting this to be the explosion of industry everyone is hoping for. Someone did point out that federal legalization will allow banks to more easily invest in pot, so there will be an inflow of cash from there.
That’s what I’m doing Monday

> Burry is a fine guy to have on board, but the real whale is having Ryan Cohen on board (founder of Chewy). He’s pressuring the board to get their shit together and if they don’t he’ll take it over. He owns about 10% of GME.

Well, the thing to consider is that with that amount of shares, they won't be able to dump it at current market's $16 even if they wanted to, so, merely because they're still in, doesn't mean that they wouldn't really like to liquidate even at $16, because if they do start, the market will probably fall quick, and then the rest of their shares decline quick, possibly for good.

Is the stock really worth $30-$40 on "technicals alone", though?  Isn't B&M retail dead?  I assume GameStop has the brand to ease any sort of transition into the online commerce, but is the brand itself worth more than $1B?
What were they asking about

The pizza restaurant by my house is also overvalued and low margin when you exclude the pizza

That's good if you can deduct the losses. I am not from USA so don't know how it works. In the country I am you pay between 20 to 28% capital gains tax after minus the circa 12k capital gains allowance.
Yes and no. It’s trailing because they tend to get on a stock after the first increase in price... but they tend to be early adopters on these stocks which normally continue massive run-ups.

If you bought shares on most tickers after WSB first “hypes” them nearly all of them would double your money.
I never do, and that's why my CMPS (stocks, not options) are up 26% since I bought them... 4 days ago.

And then you woke up from this dream and looked at your margin called robinhood account
Expiration date? 
Type of account?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, though. You motherfuckers don’t think past “up up up” and get burned. 

It means that he took his cost out cause the stock is too high and he doesn’t believe it can go higher, even in the medium term. HE HS A SMALLER POSITION NOW and less momentum!

He’s looking to put the majority of his money somewhere else. 

THATTTTT is how he has stayed ahead of all the financial industry you damn retard. You are hearing of his trimming now, he had already planned it. He didn’t just wake up one day like you and say oh I will sell it now cause I’m happy I made tendies to pay my wife’s boyfriend, like yourself.

That’s an entirely different bet but maybe yea. 

GME announcing a strategy to restructure and become an online contender and causing a short squeeze and results in a long term ballooning of the stock price is different from them actually successfully restructuring in the long term. 

It would be either like investing in an unprofitable Tesla in 2014 or something, or, idk, investing in moviepass (if it was public). Tesla went on to succeed, moviepass had a good idea and plan, but their business model just isn’t working out and they are hemorrhaging money.

Yes the punchline was the funny part
Get LOW, get LOW
Yes, but their point here is tax years. The $100,000 realized casino win in December 2020 is taxable. You’ll owe $20,000 (roughly) on that win, and you’ll need to pay it by April 15, 2021.  If you go ahead and bet $100,000 in January 2021, then lose it all, you are -$20,000 overall. Those losses in 2021 can be claimed to offset winnings in 2021 (or later, depending on tax code changes). They cannot be claimed to offset prior years’ winnings - those taxes are already paid and the tax year is closed. The government is not giving you money back from prior tax years.
calls, late 2021/early 2022 expiration.  why?  because the only reason memecough is still being pushed is to sell doses of the vaccine.  once it's been purchased and big-pharma has made its money, this thing is going to be memory holed like an unwanted step child who went to live on the farm.  also, going to need a big rally/recovery to legitimize the election, DOW to 35k by summer.
just dont go overboard man. ive seen guys lose everything cuz they didnt know when to stop. im talking early 30 year olds with millions.

its stop being about money after a while, it just turns into people chasing a dragon.

my advice, open 2 or 3 portfolios, one for trading, the other for options and the 3rd one for retarded plays with money you can afford to lose.

Implied volatility. Basically a measure of an increase in option price as a result of expected price swings of the underlying
Ok
You have Merill Lynch who have been shorting GME for YEARS. They sure as hell won't cover until either they are forced to (Cohen might force a vote and shares will need to  be recalled) or company makes a turn around like making big $ (which they will because this is the start of a big console cycle. Look at the graph between 2008 and 2012. PS3/PS4 release date, they coincide. Gamestop is a cyclical company after all).

Also look at the short interest during those times, they fell down hard. Shorts always covered their asses around the start of the gaming console cycles, but unlike last time they thought the stock was going to 0 which it is not.
My brokerage firm (IB) has a notification for a PLTR insider selling 2.7 million shares on Nov 23-34.
You officially went full retard. $5 is a 325 million dollar market cap for a company expecting to do north of 5 billion in revenue next year on even the most conservative Wall Street estimates. They are also net cash. They HAVE $700 million in cash you retard 😂. you think this stock will trade 50% below it’s cash!

January calls aren't far dated enough to recover. You'd need leaps like August next year or further
Does anyone choose to spend money at the retailer they have calls on? Like because I have LOW calls for January of course I’m going to go to Lowe’s I need those things to print!
Fucking depressing isn't it. Lol
I think so, already recovered a bunch. I think the CEO coming out and saying BF wasn't going to have a lot of sales made retards panic sell. Not having a lot of excess to unload on BF is a really good thing, but retards be retards.

 CRSR owns Scuff now. Thats probably going to be a bigger money maker for CRSR than it was as a standalone company. Premium controllers are super hot items right now, plus Scuffs tend to be used in lots of tournaments. Plus they have at least 18% market share in the entire peripherals market while HALF of their revenue comes from RAM alone (which is not peripherals).

This is a company we should still be bullish on, their decision to put themselves on the market means that they want to make big moves and grow. And they're doing it. I don't think it's going to go over $200 for many many years. But $100+ EOY 2022? Easy peasy, just need more ERs waved in front of big money players.
Auto mods aren’t too good. Scratch that, automods are gay
What could you possibly see in a chart that shows you changes come from shorts covering instead of long investors lol. The answer is nothing
[removed]
Not saying this to be confrontational, but who are the competitors and what is their market share? The reason I ask is because PLTR states that instituions own data science and IT teams are their competitors.
Fuck you nerd.
You can man 1000% but dude it easier to get burned
Look at how many paper hands appeared on Friday for PLTR. A small percent red in GME and it will be the same. But I hope not.
Yeah I think both batches would probably be in December anyway? So I doubt it matters much
If it goes down to $15, will you propose to her?
You're only at risk of being exercised on if you sell to open. Which is something you probably shouldn't ever do until/unless you develop a much better understanding of how all this works. Once you close one, you are no longer involved.

Love you too retard
Yea same here, their earning should be on fire and the graph looks promising.But am just a retard
You are just learning this is how it works?
[removed]
I'll just go off their stated production targets:

20 Million Vehicles/year x 33,000 ASP (Conservative Guess) = 660B revenue

Energy/Solar - 400B/year - (Conservative, Elon thinks this segment will be larger than auto)

They are at 9% operating margin. Let's say once they optimize and scale they reached 15% profit margin (I think this is conservative given where they are already)

Total Revenue - 1.06T/year, Profit (15%) = $159B, 30X P/E = 4.77T Market Cap

This does not include FSD/Robotaxi revenue, software/entertainment services. data, insurance, autobidder, etc... so the numbers can really start climbing, especially considering these segments will be higher margin business than auto/energy.
Because it’s about catalysts. Consider Best Buy; also brick and mortar, but with a large online presence.

GameStop is almost too focused on brick and mortar. Shorts in the summer were certain it would not survive COVID. Enter Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy, a billion dollar pet food company that competes (successfully) against amazon. If he does a takeover or if they start listening to him it’s game over shorts. 

The landscape hasn’t changed for GameStop for several months, but the bet here is that it quickly will.
This is the best answer.
Got it, so a good strategy would be to buy the dip and hold for long term when GME gets restructured and becomes an online contender. 🚀
I've questioned this. By definition time to cover = total shares shorted / *average* daily volume. I can't assume volume will be average in a short situation. Could someone with more brain wrinkles explain why the time to cover would be less, equal, or more than the current estimate (5.7 days)?
Based on your hope? Stop misleading people

You are only responsible if you have a position at expiration (or exercise if under some very uncommon circumstances that happens before expiration).  Once you close you are out of the picture.  Also, it’s probably better to put stuff like this in r/options.

It was like 3 weeks ago but these fucking stoners can't remember.

The original author of the contract is obligated to fulfill the contract. It can change hands many times before expiration but the original issuer is responsible for fufuilling.

Cool graphs man. But isn't WSB sentiment sort of a trailing indicator here? Looks like sentiment peaks are where price momentum slows way down
The graph vodoo looks like its about to break soon, and I think many people bought apple items overall so their earnings should be on fire, i think it could get to 140ish
And if it trades sideways? Or slightly down? Riiiiiiight. No problem

A force to be reckoned with on their own soil, they don't have the resources to scale large attacks on other countries. They've been on the verge of financial ruin for a long time now.

Except in the above scenario, since the female is paying for the rented guy, he (the prostitute) is guilty of coercing her to pay him for sex that she requested.

Anyone know what the TSLA / S&P announcement tomorrow AH regarding tranche splitting will actually be about?
There are many potential catalysts.

-Buyout by Cohen
-Good earnings
-Early payment of debt 
-Stock buybacks 
-Dividend announcement
-Strategic partnerships

More positive than negative catalysts. GME is more like Best Buy than Blockbuster. Remember when Best Buy was just considered Amazon's showroom and left for dead? That is where we are with GME.

 I was holding pot stocks for years. I can ride the wave down. But when I’m in green I get a lot more nervous than I’m in the red 😂. You have any comments on current RSI? Seems a bit high on all the time frames.

Even if it passes the vote in the House, it still has to go through the Senate - which it won't even go to the floor because of Moscow Mitch.
You don’t have to all in puts but maybe holding a bearish bet with 5% of your options money is smart
Even if „most of us“ did buy at 30. they gon make money at EOY. If you short PLTR, gove your money to charity, you obv dont know how to handle it. its just throwing money out the windows at that point

I'm pulling out of BABA and doubling down on GME Monday.
Yeah well stop that shit now. Grow up
I did not use a referral code does it get me free miles
So all I see is diversify my portfolio to 50% PLTR and 50% GME right?
Genius

#SPY $369 if you’re nasty 🎅🏿
What? It’s 25% over NAV and there won’t be a target announced for months. It’s all because retards keep hyping it will be Stripe even though it’s clearly not

If you think it’s performing worse than other SPACs then you are just making things up lol. 25% premium without even a realistic rumor of a target is an insane premium
Dayum. Still gains are gains.

What's this pattern? I'm curious now. You have peaked my interest.
ACB exceeds my personal risk tolerance
Direct listing no capital raised, ipo can flop. Look at SNOW, banks “valued” them at $70B they got $3.6B in ipo and lost out on another $4.8B. Banks and buffett made all the money. By going spac, they know their valuation and the amount they’ll get before they even do it, not after.
i think sp500 reveals plans on 14th so until then funds will prob acquire more floats hence steady climb. not good old 10-20 moves though I assume
It depends on when you get out and when you get back in. IV is making premiums pricey now

I work in this space and I'm a JFrog customer and own an Artifactory cluster.  They don't have much competition, yet (Sonatype is lame), but expect AWS, Azure, Github, and Gitlab to start being a lot more competitive in the future.  Long term I think Artifactory is a good product, but it's easy to replicate and it's WAY too expensive.  The company I work for spends about $5M with JFrog per year, and as soon as we can replace it with Github we will.
Nice
Why didn’t you buy when they were low 3/4 months back?
Bro if it hits $40, I'll leave your girlfriend for you.

I'm stupidly new to investing, and the amount I can invest is stupidly low too (a few hundred 😅). I've read a giant mix of PLTR posts, most of the negative just being that they're tired of people talking about PLTR.

Could someone please tell me if PLTR is just a meme, or do people expect it to jump to some ridiculous number soon? Basic stock purchases or other investment choices? Thanks in advance.

That is some quality meme material.
Considering their last earning’s sole reason for running at a loss was the issuance of stock *to* insiders, I wonder if that’s indicative of a low volume of sell offs by insiders once the lockup occurs. Hear me out:

As Q3 2020 had $94 million in compensation, anyone issued that stock would still be taxed at the short term federal capital gains rate (regular taxable income) if they sold at the lockup date. Considering the high average salary of employees here (Glassdoor says an average of $119,969/yr with ~2500 people) if that stock issuance was divvied out evenly, each would get $37,600 in additional income if they liquidated immediately when able. They might avoid turning this into additional taxable income in order to (1) avoid short term federal capital gains and (2) continue the physical transition from California (13.3% state capital gains) to Colorado (4.63% state capital gains).

Sell offs in February would put a lot of those distributions at a 24-32% federal income tax rate, when a long term hold (around November 2021 depending on when the stock vests) would give them a 15% federal cap gains rate. 

I haven’t done an analysis of the exact tax impact of an immediate sell off after lockup for an employee, but I can readily assume that there is a large tax advantage for them to hold, which leads me to believe the sell off won’t be as significant as we anticipate.
Fuck. Who’s making the announcement? We gotta buy more before.
Government’s free money* 

And shut the fuck up then bitch, cry about it
Lol, and somebody says that markets are efficient.
It all depends on your ability to be in emotional control... too many times people hop in with big bets and then cry afoul when things don’t go their way.
Not true.

What if biden drops tariffs on China?
Obviously in your opinion, a 15 mil lock up release in this example, and it's right after earnings announcement, will have the same effect on a stock as a 320 mil lock up release 3 weeks after earnings announcement. Cool, you certainly know how to draw an analogy!
[removed]
Wtf? Isnt it the opposite? Ive been trusting autists since I found WSB
Q4 deliveries first week of January and ER probably around Jan 21. Assuming they beat delivery estimates, price usually dips and than jumps before ER. With all this new money in on the stock, it’s hard to believe beating delivery estimates sees the same drop

How do you think school costs 6 figures? The market for school is flooded with free government backed lending dollars.

If you take those away the post secondary system goes from having infinite new dollars coming in to maybe 15% of that.

Overnight the cost of college drops wildly in my solution.

Also in Cuckida your college costs more than $12k funny money. Have you ever heard of a government subsidy? It is $12k to you directly and the rest of it gets tosses ont faceless tax payers.

You are a know nothing socialist. When the western world financial system collapses (and it will in our life time) due to all your horse shit policies only then will you see the error of getting something for nothing.

Unpack how a "for profit system" is making college expensive. You cant because it has nothing to do with the free market and everything to do with government money.
Just vote to remove every time you see this shit
It's been shorted quite a bit for some time now.

There needs to be a catalyst and many think it will come from earnings. My bet is the catalyst will be a wsb hypetrain switch from pltr to gme. Either before or after earnings.
I think the important point to drive home here is the timeline. Breaking your earnings chunks into yearly slices is the taxable income. Just like running a business, all of your earnings up to the first of the year is taxable income regardless if you yolo it all on the superbowl. Still owe.
Cotdamn. 7 days to cover.   Does that mean the squeeze can potentially last an entire wk?
Not all who yolo are retards.

Thoughts on tsla and how high it can go?
Much Classier.
Who knows bro. Keep an eye on rising option iv and limp dick chart pattern
By far enough itm and you might as well just buy shares. Like that 15k a year out would probably give you 80+ delta with almost no theta but at that point why not just buy shares. 

Also you would probably automatically lose 300+ dollars due to the bid and ask spread.
ACB & APHA. Safer play is MJ etf

Just so everyone knows, there are talks in the house of delisting Chinese stocks that don't comply with U.S. audit policy. This is the major risk in all of these stocks right now. 

With Biden in, it seems thats not going to happen. But its possible.
If there is any truth to this, dude, after you get out (and get out now), look into codependency. You made a series of unacceptable compromises. Check yourself and fix yourself before you get into a serious relationship again.

If not, dude, this was hilarious.

Were you not worried about TSLA not recovering for a while since we didn’t know how long the economic impact would last? Who would buy new cars during an economic downturn? We didn’t even know if it was just the service industry that would be most impacted or if it were widespread
But you shouldn't be afraid of margin either, if your portfolio isn't just retarded FDs. Just think about what's the difference between these portfolios in the long run:

1. 100% in SPY
2. 125% in SPY

Even if there's a temporary 50% crash, the second portfolio will beat the first one, if you just keep holding.

 So far buying low and setting stop losses when it's high instead of selling has worked for me.

But yes, it's autism if you just hold while your position goes down.

Thank's for clearing that up for me.
Whatever happened to the good old days of $SPY all talk is about $PLTR and $GME. What is everyone’s thoughts on $SPY for December?  $355p 12/16.
Yeah BUT let’s say tomorrow GME goes up to $19 a share, that $140 option is now probably worth $340, you don’t hold them till expiry. Sell them on run ups for 5 baggers
Covid shut down the casinos again?

I really don’t know why people think lockup period means stock is gonna tank.

I’m a senior engineer in SV. I have friends with hundreds of thousands of equity in a single company. My friend at Adobe has been working there 6 years, and he’s yet to sell a single share unless it was used to spend money.

The people who have great amounts of stock options in these tech companies tend to be people who are good at their jobs and they tend to have higher salaries.

Not saying ZI might not go down, but basing it off of lock up expire is kinda silly
hehehh you sure woke up in a bad mood. You hungover?
This is my only concern with throwing the remainder of my account on GME. I don't think people are understanding TO HOLD. I'm seeing a lot of talk about buying calls and I'm like, no we need it to be SHARES to trigger the squeeze.

"Lemonade, Inc. (NYSE: LMND) (the “Company”) today announced an extension of the early lock-up expiration date pursuant to the terms of lock-up agreements with the underwriters (“lock-up agreements”) of its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, until one business day following the release of earnings for the third quarter of 2020."

They released Q3 earnings on Nov 11 and LO expired Nov 12. Stock has gapped up by 36% from Nov 12 if that helps you get a prospective.
No you retard a short squeeze won’t work here. Only 16.6% of shares are short positions compared to over 100% for GME.
can't believe the squeeze sentiment on GME is nearly caught up with PLTR.  algos are going to buy
How many tires did you buy?  Tell me you didn't pay $200 a piece?
I'm really inexperienced with this stuff, but should i really but PLTR stocks? I saw that it was kinda leveling off for a couple of days, but is there solid enough proof that it'll go up again?

I went from $360k to $119k in a couple of months. You have to just STOP. Take a break. Look at the market. You lose money when you force trades. If the trade comes to you, so the opportunity screams profit, then and only then should you make the trade.
Good luck bud
The ticker for us steel is X.
wow, you are new. 
buddy i dont know if youre fucking with me, but if you arent. this sub isnt for you. if you have disposable income that you can fuck around with, sure join us in our autism.
but dont play with real money. do some research first. once you at least know the lingo and have had some experience, then you can fuck around.
i know we joke around on this sub, but take my advice. 

but it literally means you hold it, you dont sell nor buy. whether the stock goes up or down, could be hours. days, weeks or for some even months.

preferably up of course, so you can sell it high.

Kind of sad you're downplaying actual dystopian government surveillance
If you lose more than $10k in a week in general, whatever you are doing is not working or market is completely unpredictable. Perfect time to sit back and reevaluate yourself and spend time with family. Come back next week with positive thinking of how I can make $1000 and not worry about how I can make $10k in options. To make $10k that you lost in one go, you might invest more and possibly lose more.

You are talking about the tip of the iceberg for options and most WSBer's never get past buying a OTM monthly call or put. You look at the break even price but most options never make it to expiration and should not. If you are confident a stock is going to go up in the next day or two a monthly call option is a great tool for that. You are leveraging your potential profit potential by 100 but that option will lose a lot of value every day it's held if the stock stays flat or moves lower. The cool thing is that you can protect yourself from big losses with different strategies as well.

90% of OTM options expire worthless and that is pretty much the only options that are promoted on here. They are the biggest gamble. But this tells you that the big gains that people post here are by far the minority.
Hoping for a gap up on Monday. Holding 30x 16.5c 12/4 exp that I bought at the top on Friday due to FOMO.

TQQQ has made me some serious dolla for a buy and hold.
Even at $50 bucks $GME is just a $3bn MC company, way below both GME’s ‘09 and ‘13 console cycle peak ($9bn). And this years console cycle is much bigger as evidenced by comments by gaming OEMs (MSFT + Sony, also New switch coming in 21E). None the less, GME trades at around .2x NTM sales (with a net cash position). This assumes no growth, which is obviously not the case given multi-year console cycle. At 1x sales you’re looking at north of $100 dollar stock, and even 1x sales is not demanding

You kiss her on the mouth then turn back to the stain above you. “I don’t think this place is so bad.”

If you gave your friend advice and expected thanks and a tip then it sounds like you were really trying to leverage your account using their money. Just be happy for your friend, dickbag, and propose a nice time to celebrate your newfound cash.

aha!  :D  OP, don't forget to send over the $20
The ratio of short positions to stock float is like 3 to 1. I’m thinking we’ll see a massive short squeeze if they blast past the earnings expectations, but more importantly, set up a plan to restructure the business to a digital market. 
If GME doesn’t restructure their business they will go bankrupt in a couple of years, and now they have attracted talent with experience in digital markets and online retail. The founder of Chewey, the Amazon of pet supplies, bought 10% of the company with the intent to be actively involved with its management. Plus, with the console sales and allready good cash on hand, plus if they liquidate some physical assets, they’re be flushed with cash to totally restructure the business. 

All the pointers are telling us that they will be try to become a growth company seeking to be profitable in the future by becoming the Amazon of gaming. This could very realistically cause a spike in shorts closing their positions, and since shorts make up like 300% of the float, saying the stock will moon is an understatement, I’m talking 500 to 1000%.
GME will be the talk for the holidaze season.

can you paste it here. It has been blocked.
GME is vertically integrated, they deliver their vaccine in their own EV vehicle with a driver that smokes their own GME cannabis.
As long as its over 50 we play. And its not too bad here in mid south.
I have a better idea... JUST LEAVE HER NOW. Put the extra cash you’ll save (by not supporting her) on PLTR. 🚀🚀🚀
The virus is going to be endemic. Basically any epidemiologist who isn’t stupid or on a heavy leash is saying this shit will be here for years. It is far more infectious and deadly than the Spanish Flu (the reason we’re not seeing similar casualties now is a century of technological development - if this struck in 1918 the death toll would have been way higher than their flu) it evolves more rapidly (vaccines will likely have to be a yearly thing at a minimum, similar to flu vaccines) and unlike last century with measles and smallpox vax there is a huge movement of hundreds of millions of people - disproportionately located in the first world, who are politically opposed to taking vaccines and believe the virus is fake even as their own family members drop dead. You’re not gonna get anything close to the 96% or so of people required for herd immunity - you’ll be lucky to get 70%, and antibodies do not provide permanent immunity as we’re already seeing people get reinfected months after.

This shit is gonna be around a long time. Smart countries which lock down hard will likely deal with seasonal outbreaks from animals or overseas travellers or frozen foods or whatever. Countries which fuck around are just gonna be dealing with it indefinitely and in the long haul will likely have perma locked down “do not go” areas.

This virus isn’t quite apocalyptic in itself - it’s a couple steps removed from that, but it absolutely will fuck up the shit of any country which doesn’t get it under control hard in the medium to long term as much as maybe a limited nuclear war or civil conflict.

Have no fear though, as the stock market will continue to rise and worst case scenario if you live in a perma do not go zone you’ll have a shit ton of tendy bucks to buy blowjobs from malnourished crackwhores for the equivalent cost of a can of beans or some shit. You may even get to play warlord with all of your stonk money which could be fun, that is if you don’t die at 30 when your lungs kidneys and heart fail after your 8th subsequent re-infection.

Now in terms of stonks Lockheed Martin is a pretty good long call.

You know what fuck it you should do it. I once had a strong feeling to put all my money into a stock play and I let my broker talk me out of it. I lost out on about 200k from not  following my hunch.

But lets be honest at the current prices its like flipping a coin which way it will go. Id put it in a SPAC

What color is Shrek’s cock?
Sell after year end to push tax liability one year or don’t sell (just hold). Long term capital gains are taxed at 17% less than short term gains. Also you could move to a state with low/no income tax such as TN or TX or FL or NV.

You can trade in an IRA or 401k account to defer taxes. If the account is a Roth, then the gains are literally tax free once you pull them out (after your 65).

If you were really sophisticated, you could open a basket swap and trade in there without recognizing taxable income. This is WSB, and you don’t have the credentials or investment technicals do this - this is not an option.

Lastly if you have an HSA I think you can invest similarly through that and gains are only taxed upon withdrawal.

*One last thing, that’s important for 401k/IRA/HSA trading: you should understand the tax implications of trading on margin. When these accounts trade on margin, a proportionate amount of income IS taxable. Look up UDFI/UBTI (unrelated debt financed income/unrelated business taxable income).

Hope this helps

As someone in the industry I will be interested to follow but disagree with what will happen in the market. The CRU (commonly used steel index) has increased sharply, and will continue. My experience with steel and stocks is steel is old business and doesn’t get the investing communities interest enough to explode. 

You’re picking US Steel to ride. US Steel is the worst ran company out of all the mill competition. The company is so poorly mismanaged they will find a way to ruin profits, it’s practically guaranteed. 

If you have to look at steel, I would suggest the Service Centers, such as Worthington or Olympic Steel. For the mills I would go with Cleveland Cliffs, who’s acquisition of ArcelorMittal should be completed January 1st and has set themselves up with a wonderful vertically integrated supply chain, or Nucor who has fantastic management.

Never give advice bruh. I have learned my lessons. Just feel lucky that he made money, if he had lost it then you would have heard back from him. Only listen. Tats wat ppl wants anyways.
Low short interest and Left probably already exited his short position.  We get it dude, PLTR to the moon and all that meme shit.  Let's stop the spam.

Thanks pretty impressive dude
I’m in law school and same here
BTW… as a side play, VALE IS STEEL.

Hear me out, retards..

Vale are THE dominant iron ore supplier/exporter to the world’s largest steel mill operations.

They took a breather last year to restructure global operations +safety/efficiency do-overs and for this have been temporarily overtaken by OZ’s Rio Tinto in terms of production.

As a result, their margins have shot way above what is expected form mining. They have coiled up to disrupt their own industry. Dominated S. America, major expansion in N. America and are main exporters to Europe and Gyna. Gyna gobbles up iron ore exponentially and is unstoppable. Nations compete for growth and infrastructure and our girl VALE supplies all sides. If X moons on this squeeze, VALE moons by association. If not, all others: US, GYNA, Aperam, EUROPOOR Steel … don’t matter.... Who wins? VALE. Let's not forget they are also the OG of nickel for EVs.

TL;DR: VALE is STEEL, VALE is EV, VALE is US, VALE is GYNA.
gg. Care to give me 5k to yolo on PLTR?
It better be because I need about 10k gain tomorrow
Ahh love, isn't it magical?
Shes trying to keep the extra 3 grand a year from taxes
I love the 174k Tesla call and the 1 share of O. Now no one can say you aren't diversified
Even if it goes back up IV is going to kill you. Imagine losing money on calls even when stonks go up
Once you stop telling him what to buy, he’ll be back... then just don’t tell him

Is GME pharma? Because I'm certainly playing that.
If anything, the IV runup to earnings would give me a really solid selling point on Friday.  Will Gauge then.
I played the steel squeeze through CLF. Nearly tripled my tendies with 15% down on FDs.

I shit you not, what had me pull the trigger was a random WSB user saying “CLF my dad just called me from work” in the daily thread. Something about scrolling past that at 2am made me think he might actually have an insider tip.

I was dying laughing. Jake Paul way too big for lil Nate. It was comedic gold.
Honestly guys. Squeeze might not happen. 
But the short thesis is very stupid. 
Company is not failing at all. Their balance sheet is really solid and they have been good at generating cash even at the end of the console cycle.
I’m in GameStop since it was $4.
I’m Certainly worried so many people are calling for a squeeze. Because they don’t know what they are buying and they might just flip for quick profit. But GameStop’s turnaround is very real. The company’s current valuation is extremely low.
Bought the top like the true autist I really am
The market is forward looking but I don’t think it forecasts 10 years ahead

That’s fair. I’m not going to lie, the whole pregnancy experience was by far one of the most stressful experiences of my life. Felt totally surreal and was a straight up nightmare for awhile. Ended up being a miscarriage, but that’s besides the point. Just keep in mind that no matter how you feel, that’s still YOUR kid, if that means anything to you. You might want absolutely nothing to do with the girl or the kid now, but you might feel differently later. Regardless, best of luck to you and I hope everything works out.

I’ve been reading through, and contemplating adding $PLTR Dec 31 $30 call on a dip, buying Jan 15th 20 calls on $GME, Dec 4th $AAPL $117 calls, or $SPG Jan 15th 105 calls. Sitting on 18k. Would like a nice double. Where would you park it?
My brain chose to read this in the voice of the throat drops commercial...
Bro ur username is sick
Wheeling Tesla would be more retarded than dumping $30k on shares. Unlike a traditional wheeling strategy on a normal stock, it’s a lose lose. Sell puts, miss out on the rally. Sell covered calls, miss out on more money and get your shares called away.

Check out thetagang. Half the posts this weekend were about asking for advice cuz they had to roll their covered calls to like January 2022 to avoid losing their shares lol.
will the people that are buying TSLA shares because they know indexes will buy it, end up selling on december 21? and those holding SPY will end up losing money?

should i sell my SPY etf shares on dec. 18?
ARK got those shares 3 weeks ago (nice timing Cathy)

I feel like I changed his life, however he never really showed appreciation, I barely got a thank you, didn’t get a tip (lol), and now he acts like he knows it all. I expressed frustration and vowed to never give him stock advice ever again.

I haven't looked into depth for Novavax, so I might be wrong about this, but I definitely would not recommend this company for their COVID vaccine.

The issue has 2 parts: 1) Novavax uses a traditional vaccine platform so it is going to suffer from all of the regular problems with vaccines and 2) reduced agility for mutations, as a result.

1- Novavax's vaccine relies upon immunogenicity via their proprietary adjuvant system, as with other traditional vaccines. Most traditional vaccines are hands down terrible at generating IgG since the route of antigen exposure is highly unnatural. Nowhere in nature is a single peptide floating around with a bunch of plant carbohydrates going straight into the lymph node. In most cases, your body will develop a response primarily against the adjuvant (because that is what elicited the activation in the first place). There is no scenario where a traditional vaccine will reach the IgG generation capability of an mRNA vaccine

2- While distribution and storage might be more feasible, the moment the coronavirus mutates, Novavax will be well behind its peers. A single nucleotide mutation in the sequence would yield basically an identical drug product and formulation from Pfizer and Moderna (and Moderna is in talks with the FDA regarding this issue). In the case of Novavax, however, a single nucleotide mutation would force them to have to re-optimize their production system and it could potentially impact the formulation and drug product stability - testing of all of these items would cost a lot of money. 

I think it boils down to this: would you rather have a few slightly painful injections but know with 95% certainty that you are immune to the coronavirus, or would you have a normal vaccination but just not be sure whether it worked for you or not? My bet is that most people would choose the more effective option.

so far i feel like there has been an overreaction because people thought it was a second 2007 crisis happenin for the real estate , but obviously it's not and people are comming back at it.

Today, most REITs/mREITs get their rents paid. they lost a lot of value because their share price is highly correlated to their net asset values , in opposite with most stocks out there....

So at the beginning of the pandemic , a lot of REITs/mREITs sold properties to get enough cash to be able to go through the pandemic ( because REITs all have huge debts owned by banks, obviously). The fact that they sold those properties directly impacted their net asset value, thus directly impacting their stock prices, and their dividends. but still, most of them collect \~90% of the loans on the properties they still own and rent.

 that's the infos i got during my DDs for the past few months... but hey, i may be wrong \^\^

You are a pot smoking idiot that’s for sure. You obviously know little about the purchasing of this product. Buying a 1/8 retail is anywhere from 50-60$. Buying 1/4 is double that.

Second, growing your own isn’t (easy). It’s not like the tard Chia Pet sitting on your desk. There is a lot more that goes into it and unless you have time, space and the knowledge, why would you? People won’t same reason they don’t grow their own carrots, convenience...

Third, there is plenty of room for growth. Legalizing/ completely decriminalizing it will lead to an acceptance and understanding of why people use it. Also allows for expansion for these established companies to move to new regions and markets. Sure the extreme rush of people through their doors first couple weeks won’t last forever. This doesn’t mean movement of product and revenue will decrease, in fact it points in the opposite direction. 

Conclusion: more revenue and growth = great opportunity to see increase in a stocks value. If you can buy in at fair price to a company that is backed by good management and strategist you are going to have a great chance of making some money!

You sound new to the stock market. Where did I say pltr is less valuable than gme? I said the stock price growth in pltr has vastly less distance to run than gme. Valuation of a company is stock price x shares. Palantir has an obscene number of shares outstanding.
66milliom vs 1.6 billion shares. For gme to have the same valuation it would need to hit like 15k a share

NVAX vaccine trials are progressing very well. They have contracts globally to distribute the vaccines. This is good because not one single company will be able to distribute the vaccine everywhere anyways. Price will fluctuate due to competitor announcements.

Black Box shows you block trade volume at various price points on the chart so you can see support levels (which is its main advantage over Flow Algo).  I believe to get DPI info for each stock you need to use Squeeze Metrics as that is their measurement that they calculate.  If you can afford it then the premium Squeeze membership with DPI and GEX for each stock would be the best option by far.

No, as long as shares are sold its not too late. I myself wont get in just yet i think, there is shorter term money to be made on apple and others and the squeeze could literally happen in 150 days
Almost all trading retail platforms are commission free in America these days. That’s not a Robinhood exclusive thing. The free share is but who cares about a $4 stock of some company your gonna sell the moment your account is up and running.

It is, but GME has an extremely strong chance of taking off because of this earnings call. There is real risk, but potentially massive reward. I'll be rolling a lot of my dec/jan to April and then loading up on the stupid cheap weeklies. For the week of earnings. They may expire worthless. But they may also go up a few thousand percent

The nice thing about staying up until right now is that I get to go to sleep and wake up when futures open and pre-market is only hours away

I read through your first entire post and this one too. Solid DD, will hold a few for the long term
I don't even know why anyone cares if MB is invested in GME or not. I honestly don't. I wish MB was not a GME investor so no one considered it a factor in investing in the company. I pay attention to a bunch of value investors who have been tracking online sales for GME and those numbers have been phenomenal so far. Console cycle + online pivot is good enough for me. And I have a very modest PT compared to the mooning that a lot of others expect here.
I invest in these tech stonks but i would never buy an oculus, an xbox, ps5, apple watch, amazon alexa (lmao), google nest (lmao) or most new tech.  The bare essentials are all i want
In the little bit I’ve read so far I’m liking what I’m seeing. I’ll continue to research for the remainder of the day and come tomorrow morning if I’m convinced I’ll probably jump in for 500 shares

GME has been in this channel since 2014. Peak here is about 18-19. Historically speaking that would be a great short entry. 

The last time it hit top of channel it dropped back to bottom of channel in 2 months. Assuming it hits 18-19 in DEC, that would put it back to $4 next Feb.

Free advice for all you monkeys that struck gold and made money:

Unless you have an existing structure (like an S-Corp, so you just add your K1 to your personal return)... DON’T GET CUTE WITH YOUR PERSONAL TAXES. 

The IRS knows what you made, your brokerage told them. They just want to see if you report it accurately. If you don’t, you will more than likely get fucked with no lube. They may not catch you this year, or next, but they will get you. They are fucking Javier Bardin in No Country for Old Men. 

PAY YOUR TAXES OR PREPARE FOR THE LONG DICK OF THE IRS. THEY DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE.
This is how you know the bubble has popped.

CPA here, just pay some local accountant $300-$500 if you have substantial gains. If you don’t then just turbo tax or something will work. Just remember this, most CPA firms give TurboTax to their employees for free. Aka “the experts” just keep it simple most of the time. Now when you’re a hedge fund manager and worth $250 million you can do interesting shit, until then KISS (keep it simple stupid) so you don’t have to go through a whole audit because your dumbass got aggressive trying to expense your car via your LLC to save $200 or some equally dumb shit. As far as trading goes, I know if you use certain ETFs they’re taxed differently, there have been some good posts on those in the past. Find those and trade it going forward. Once again, even “an expert” isn’t really an expert. PS - I work in valuation and turbo tax does my taxes.

I see your point. [u/Uberkikz11](https://www.reddit.com/user/Uberkikz11/) was doing his research on e-commerce and the numbers are very promising. Also, we are at the beginning of a huge console cycle amongst several other positive factors. 

The turnaround is not obvious, but if you do a bit of research, you might be surprised

If you're holding in a certain weed/bee stock, don't sweat it. That shit won't pop up until after mid dec. Will probably dip a bit before that.

I don't think so man. This isn't the 1920s where the only way you can make money is working at the grocery store that was within walking distance. There are a million ways for ppl to make money nowadays; you can sit on your couch and be working for someone on the other side of the globe. 

Market crashes like back in the day will likely never happen again unless there's a world war. In fact, even during war, certain industries are booming. During this pandemic, tech, pharma, healthcare and other industries saw a huge boom. Major companies who were contemplating going online are now completely online and reaping the benefits - the pandemic has made the gig economy and WFH thing a permanent reality (one that would've likely taken another decade to come to fruition otherwise).

Any government relief and shit are just cherry on the cake at this point.
Thats a brave thing to do, especially with the fact you will have to work 2 jobs after that.
It's a trap for when you're a successful day trader earning millions off your FDs.

I don’t doubt the innovation that Tesla has put forth over the years but that company is built upon the shoulders of Elon Musk....which is good. It’s the same idolization Apple got from Steve Jobs. 

As long as Musk remains at the helm, they will flourish.

And tell me what Ford or GM has done to truly stand out over the last decade other than pushing out the same models over and over with an additional cup holder.
why the fuck would you even waste your time and write a comment like this. these EXACT type of fucking self deprecating comments is exactly what is killing WSB and already killed the rest of reddit a long time ago. you my friend, need to go.

What if they restructure in a way where they sell online, but keep some locations and turn it into a franchised netcafe type deal ? Rent out stations for gameplay, host tournaments, maybe a coffee shop or some shit. Im sure by the time we get the clear to be consumers again, people will be motivated and incentivised to flood theatres and amusement parks and travel and stuff. Big maybe

This is literally the reason you stupid piece of shit. Cases always go down over the holidays for this reason. How fucking stupid can you be, dear god. If you look at the reporting data, it literally says 20 states haven't been reporting over the thanksgiving weekend, you dumb fucking bastard.

The difference between now and 08 is people have much more equity in their homes (giving them more options and flexibility) and even if we see a flood of foreclosures, short sales, or even just homes put up on the market inventory is so incredibly low that it would not affect home prices. The fed is going to keep rates low so people are ready to buy. So I do think by Q3 we will see some changes with people at the end of their rope but it will not be a “crash” in the housing market.

cz theres a chance that they wont expire ITM and u can pocket the premium. Risky eh
I did not imply that I want to buy this stock or that I have any existing positions in this stock. Infact I was merely starting a discussion as to why you think we should sell this. I didn't say I was going to sell or buy. That's a figment of your imagination or your assumption which you made in your head.

Now let me clear something up here. When you said 'sell', did you mean sell short or sell existing positions? Because if it was the first choice, that implies that you are urging people to sell this stock short, ei making a play to take advantage of the downside move. If it was the latter, it implies that you merely wanted people to avoid volatility and get out of their long positions. Even if it was the latter and you were urging people to get out, it means you were expecting a downside move, which could therefore mean you can take advantage of that with a short. 

Okay, here you got me. I got nothing to respond to your third point. If you were merely stating that as a statement, my bad. The way I understood it is that this was an opportunity for a short position as only a small percentage of the unlocked shares were required to make a substantial move to the downside. If I misinterpreted it, my apologies.

I updated my post to include a link as to where I got a list of the stocks that had their lockup periods end. You can have a look at the edit above. I'm sure you are more than capable at finding a stock ticker and looking at a candlestick chart and on the day of the lockup expiration. Validate my research yourself if you don't trust me, and you shouldn't trust me because that's just dumb. Don't let people give you financial advice on this reddit, I hope you know that. Again, I'm stressing, this post was labeled 'Discussion', not 'DD', hence I didn't provide sufficient evidence, and I don't intend to because that was not my intention in the first place.

When would that happen?
I dunno man as a relatively new investor, options seem like a good way to lose your ass (and then some). I’d rather grind it out on basic buy low/sell high stock trading fundamentals. I won’t get rich quick, but I won’t go broke fast either. TBF I’m generally a tight poker player so that’s how I invest as well.
I’m totally new at this investing thing. Should I just throw like $500 at pltr and sell when its at like $50 a share? Is it that easy?

AMZN is overvlaued  and low margin business without AWS
In this case, this actually isn't true. Because of the short interest.

100% of shares need to be re-purchased to close the position, so everyone can actually sell at a high price to a buyer if the timing is good.

Not saying that this will happen, but it is actually a possibility.

I think what u/cowboyre is saying, is that if 1million people put in 1 dollar, and the lotto winning is 100million, then everyone gets 100 dollars (100mil divided over 1mil buyers= 100 per person)

But what cowboyre isn't accounting for is that this is the internet, and one day some slimy skeezeball will probably just run off with everyone's money, or finagle some paperwork and keep all the winnings

Hey man, I know this is WSB but the numbers you are talking about sound like you're longer in the game or at least comfortable with holding LEAPS. I'm a 20 year old student, I made a bit of money and lost a bit (overall, I am up by 3% after a few months). It's really not much but at least I am in the positive. May I ask you what you take into account when buying LEAPS? Besides choosing a sustainable company and using your profits as you said, what is it that is important? I don't know much about options yet, so just shoot what you got and I research the terminology and do the rest. But really, any advice is helpful. Would love to hear this.

Not married but you gotta pay?  Man Canada does suck hard. Good luck!  To the moon baby.
That's what I was thinking, it held tight to 38~39 all the way to 1pm on Friday. Why wouldn't anyone take more profit for the weekend on Friday. OI on 12/18 45 - 55 calls were in the 2500+ range. Someone else pointed out that the float on the stock is low compared to outstanding.

If you buy calls the only thing you can lose is the premium you paid for the calls. Selling naked calls and puts is what you should avoid at all costs. Please don't be that retarded.

The **whole** market will do jack shit. What you need to worry about is if you're invested into the right sector. A lot of people are rotating away from the covid winners for a reason.
It's too late now. What's the expiry date?QQQ and growth stocks are already stagnant from Sep and probably money will move back to big tech in Dec since cyclicals and hospitality have almost caught up with nasdaq.My opinion is to sell them at a loss and buy LEAPS. In the future buy credit or debit spreads if you are not sure about sizing your position.  
You can make money off selling weekly puts to degenerates like you but you still may not be able to recover even half of it due to volatility dying in general and earnings do not start till end of Jan 2021.
Is this a real post? Why are you still together lmao
Except we'd be on public access after hours like waynes world

Man, I've read a lot of books (intelligent investor, etc) and I have to agree. This market is so overleveraged, when banks/funds start selling its going to get ugly FAST. Everyone is standing in a circle around this rocketship chart with guns drawn, waiting on the first guy to flinch, but when he does...ooo boy. It's gonna get realllllly bloody. I pulled out of the S&P entirely last week, I'm thinking about riding the smaller wave with my robinhood meme account for a few weeks because worst case I only lose a few hundred dollars, but man I've been looking, I've never seen anything like this. It's insane.
I can’t hate on them too hard they’re making SBE fly and it’s benefiting me. They just helped me get more shares of PLTR for less money. They did us a favor so we could load or some more! Blessing in disguise?
look at SPACs and bearish feels go away.
someone waived sparkly new meme (gme) around the sub and everyone has forgotten about pltr, sorry

Man. I won’t bet against TSLA because of retard powers but.. it’s solar business is in shambles it buys batteries from Panasonic and such. It’s a company that makes money from carbon credits that’s about it. Oh yeah they make a few cars and project making their own batteries in the future as a side hustle.
Feeling bearish for December tbh, just feel like when the huge spike in cases actually happens the markets might pull back a bit; probably a dip in tech because people would expect the opposite

Right, but GME is still his second largest position (in shares), third in market value.

Do your research!
Sorry guess it's not a SPAC. Can't find the article but it speculated another company would buy them out in the next year or so with their proprietary products of new chips/circuitry. Plus ARK has recently increased purchasing shares in the company.

In some airbnbs I've been to here in Italy have netflix already
Good lord. Asking WSB for legit advice. Smh. Anyways, your profits (your gains above what you put into the account this year, or had at the beginning if your account is older) will all be taxed as ordinary income if they come from the sale of securities you bought and held less than a year. They will get assessed taxes at the graduated tax rate you fall into. Google how the graduated tax rate works, I ain’t explainen it. You will know how much Sam takes as a baseline from there. Then go ahead and take 6k of your sick gains and put it into a traditional IRA. You can continue to be a moron with those dollars, but the act of putting them into a retirement account should reduce your effective income on the year by the 6k (saving them from your highest tax rate). There are tons of other things you can do to offset if your situation is less than basic, but this is what applies to 95% of our autist community. If you made like $75k plus it will probably be worth to hire a CPA for a couple hundred so you don’t screw this up and you might be able to have a real convo about identifying other tax offsets. TKW out.
I bought shared the lowest day but tried to be fancy and trade them. I made money but not nearly as much if I just held

Thank you for reminding me of this. Lost about 15 TSLA shares this week playing [with my own shares beyond just margin] and deluding myself that I could outsmart the rally. 99.999% of us can’t and never will on the long run. Losing those shares hurts more than losing money.
Studio Movie Grill is one, but I doubt they have a public IPO.
The hero we deserve!
Always going to win some lose some. Don’t get greedy, that shit will cost you long-term.
I’m just getting into call options. I am a scared retard since PLTR and all. Can I be reassured that my worst case scenario for any call is I just loose the premium I spent. I want to jump on the GME train. I know this is noob as hell and I’ve watched plenty of videos but would feel better if Random internet person gave insight.
20% shorted is nothing. That’s probably market average.  Pump those numbers up then come back to us.
Bro, no way, I'll check it out. Always wanted to invest in pre-IPO companies. Do you need to be an accredited investor or something to invest your money in these type of companies?

You can’t peel your entire profit out of your principal yearly. 7% rate of return means you can take 3-4% out yearly. Probably less if you aren’t continuing to add to the principal.
I don’t think theaters can afford to fail for the industry. The problem is AMC could survive but still need to restructure debt which would wipe out investors. 

Remember that even if everyone took the vaccine tomorrow, the sentiment of feeling safe in groups would need to gradually return. A lot of movie production was halted and projects canceled, so there would be a delay between theaters reopening at full capacity and new releases being available.

Pay off your debt, start playing options again with whatever is left over or a new amount of money you save. 

If you keep winning, you're an options master and your debt is gone, you should have no problem doubling your money repeatedly. 

If you keep losing, you're not an options master but at least your debt is gone.

Take a look at IIPR, it's a REIT specialising in leases to medical cannabis companies. Lets you play the recovery and the deregulation angle. Up about 60% since mid year.
Not to burst the bubble but MB offloaded 1m shares within the last month. Since he offloaded some other stocks, he accidently let his GME holding go over 5% of his holdings. So now since he sold enough to go under 5%, he offloaded the rest without having to report it anytime before a quarterly.

I'd imagine the major players don't go +-5% during mid quarter as a common curtesy to one another. They don't want to show bear signs in the meantime if they're pumping the hell out of a stock.

Do your research!

my 2023 $10c JETS leaps went up over 12% in a week after buying lmao
Some boomer was telling me how Tesla shouldn’t be valued like they are and that Ford, Toyota, & GM are bigger car companies. 

While their P/E is high, I told him Tesla is a tech company that does more than cars and has hit every crazy goal people said wasn’t possible 5yrs ago. People are pricing in the future car sales, but also battery tech, solar panels, etc.
I was considering a similar play but I agree, it's a risky bet.

There are other more attractive businesses that will benefit from vaccines, opening up the economy, etc.

What do you like about AMC? I listened to their investor call and I don't think I want to be an owner in that company.

That's said, options are interesting...
LOL
I won it all back on the Rainbows last night
I can’t really see it getting any better for them, they need to innovate, right now most of your Theaters that offer full menus, and cocktails menus are doing great and at the cost of food I’d go again and again, it’s not worth going to AMC at the same price for a popcorn, and a soda.

I pulled the date out to feb 15c. As the first launch is Jan 14. The merger can’t be completed before December. I believe. S. R. A. C. and momentus are using the ride share launch as the catalyst for pr for when they get listed. Like I said. Go to Nasdaq site. Type in ticker click on news. Look at all the shit going on. Space x ceo as of last week says he prefers space tugs over rockets. In September moments inked a deal to get robotic arms on their tugs. This is a no brainer and feel like people are sleeping heavily on this cause they love the next meme stock such as pltr and Nio. Lol.  I’ll be loading up on any dips I was only able to get three calls Friday before premiums jumped like 125%. I would say your postion is solid but launches can get scrubbed day if I see it all the time. You also need time for momentus to get listed just my two cents. Best of luck! Pre heat tendies

This is so true. I joined this subreddit 2 weeks ago and dumped 8K (a third of my savings) into NIO calls as soon as I could. That day was a Monday, and the chart just couldn't make up it's damn mind. An hour before the market closed I saw I was $-2,000 (lol). I panicked, sold my calls, and switched to puts hoping to regain my lost $2,000. I literally had no fucking idea what I was doing.

Unaware of how after-market hours work, I woke up the next day only to realize that my calls would've been worth $25,000 the next morning. Thankfully realizing this made me angry to the point that I went autistic, studied harder, and finally won big $25,000 by trying again with a PLTR yolo.

And now I'm hooked.
Is GME not good enough for you?!

CRSR and NIO, XPEV, LI were meme🚀 at the same time.
this must be a shit post, stock price is 29 dollars, with no P/E ratio, and no marketcap data. Majority of sound money uses fundamentals, so your expecting speculators to 17x the price?

You're not wrong, I've had both CLF and X since May. I'm sure his reasoning is that CLF has already gone up quite a bit, but X likely will shoot up a lot higher in the event of Infrastructure than CLF would. They are both great plays, but X has more upside as CLF is almost to it's highest point in 2018.

I would imagine it’s going to moon simply because everyone knows the company. So much shit we see mooning is because of memedom having nothing to do with fundamentals.

Permabear reporting in. Just waiting for it all to come crashing down. Global financial system rip. This is looking like the most speculative market in history (or at least recent history aka the last 100 years:) as you bulls make tendies with your way otm calls on companies that only exist on paper your local neighborhood bear would like to remind you to take profits. Always take profits. Cause if not My fellow permabears will be there to catch your money when it disappears from your account. Trade smart be ready hedge stop loss and take profits kids. This is a heartfelt warning. This market has gone completely cray cray. Puts on everything:) and always..... bulls r fuk.
I think the logistics of managing properties for individual guests would be a nightmare for any company, hence the AirBNB model where the individual owners are the managers as a side business?
That is a very bold statement but I will definitely look into them. Right now most of them money is tied is up in Nio and pltr but I have a couple gs left to play with so this could be the next play.
I think puts will eat too much profit. I like to sell half of the position after a major run and hold half. Especially if it doubles, then you get your money back and let the same investment ride

Good brokers allow you to route your orders and don't sell your order flow to HFTs like Citadel and Getgo and the reason is because said brokers charge commissions and therefore can make a profit. Robinhood has no way to make money other than sacrifice their customers like sheep.

I cashed out  about $80k worth of X Jan OTM calls this week right after it went up 22%. I figured since they were still OTM and who knows if it will keep going up through December that I'd sell the rip.

Definitely plan on buying longer dated OTM Calls this week. Will probably put $20k into something for Mid 2021 around $22 or so. Something far enough OTM where Calls are still really cheap.
This is a amazing and a greaf gift my man.

I totally agree. This sub has grown and mods should get more mods to help out. Also its up to use to vote to remove shity posts. wsb use to slap bans out for any shity 1k gain because we were degenerates chasing that 10 bagger. I honestly think if mods start slapping out weekly bans for low effort shit posting that clearly is just new profiles spamming the same "im new guys..what stock should I buy" we would see a improvement. Like posts breaking rule 7 slip by all the time. It won't ever be as good as it use to be because of the size this sub has become but we can still limit the amount ig garbage that gets posted and slap temp bans on people to rain in on the people flooding in and breaking the rules with there posts.
Or sell all that and buy PLTR and GME
So much new blood in here. I stay far away from this sub during market hours for that reason. Reading your comments makes me panic and want to sell or my brain gets ironed out and i want to fomo into dumb shit. When i take a step back i remember that is how i reacted when i was younger, and when i read your thoughts it takes me back to that place.

This ticker keeps getting mentioned. Such low volume. That DD is pretty weak it doesn’t mention why it’s worth investing in, just that it has similarities to Palantir. 

Palantir was worth the investment not because of the government contracts, but because they were branching out into corporate clients who would produce a growing revenue stream. Telos has predictable revenue through federal contracts but don’t seem to have a clear plan to achieve corporate client growth although they claim they have the capability.

That’s why you buy ITM, not OTM.  100 shares of MSFT is ~22k, ofc a 3k option that gives you 100 shares of leverage needs huge movement to break even.   Buy an option that cost 15k and you probably only need 2% movement in 2 years to start making money.

According to iborrowdesk.com there are only 93 shares left for short to borrow, let just say the site is off by 1,000. If people buy 1,000 shares on Monday then the price won't be manipulated by shorts. Aka if the stock truly have not run out of steam, we will see another run up next week

He's probably happy that the stock pumped, even without a squeeze so far, because of WSB, and is taking some profits so he can finish the play with "house money".  He gets a free shot a genuine short-squeeze and won't lose a penny if it doesn't pan out now.
he did not dump GME. He trimmed profits because he's a hedge fund manager who has to act logically dealing with his clients' money, a concept obviously unknown to retards here

in fact, his GME position increased from 3.79% to a bigger 5.26% of his portfolio (from Q2 to Q3) despite trimming. You can check out the 13F yourself before you spout your retarded misinformation

Foxconn is a Taiwanese company. They own the factories in China. Huawei chips were made by TSM before the sanctions, and China has no ability to produce any chip under 7nm, and the industry is at 5nm now.

Vietnam and Chinese ASSEMBLE the phones. They don’t produce the chips. China was chosen because of its geographical location and cheap labor, not because of their technology. Apple would choose any cheap country for its assembly line, but Apple can’t switch from TSM at the moment since TSM is the leading chip manufacturer, even Qualcomm chips are made there.

what does a lockdown mean for Pltr?
The Big Short or Uncut Gems
I can’t believe it’s been 3 months since September
This is the post i needed to see because I fomo hard when I see people’s gain porn. I started investing in March when I saw the buying opportunities. Tesla and Amazon were my strongest players. I turned 9k into 15k with only stocks. Then against the advice of r/investing, I went to r/wallstreetbets and kept seeing this word “options” every where. I then yolod $1000 into a Tesla FD and lost it. Then I lost 3k more. Infact i lost almost all of my profits. I since then devolved my own set of rules which took me to almost 17k but it also prevented 40k in profits. Here’s an example. 
Rule 1) don’t buy calls less the. 1.5 months from expiration 
Rule 2) don’t panic sell. 
I bought 2 Tesla 435c expiring in Jan 2021. I panic sold and they are now worth 17k each
Rule 3) don’t buy options before 12pm. 
Fomo is a strong emotion. I bought PLTR NIO and Tesla at open on Friday and saw a 1k loss. God knows how much more I’ll lose Monday. 
I have other rules to protect me. Like I refuse to invest more money for options. I’ll invest for stocks but not options. All my option plays are only with profit money. I enabled margins but I’m about to turn them off because I don’t trust myself. I’m addicted to the high like you. Remember one thing: nobody knows what they’re doing and the market is not predictable. Also plan an exit. My goal is to make 100k to pay off my house and live for free. I accept that I won’t make millions but I’m satisfied with free living. Also stop being a pussy and take what’s left of your money and yolo on Tesla at least 6 months out. Literally free money
He's going to campaign for both of them. It would stun the country if the Dems win both.
To anybody playing pot stonks. Acb has iv over 200% while mj is 60. I get thst individual tickers have more potential for crazy moves, but if any of these catalysts work out, mj or whatever other etf will move, and iv wont smash your balls
so everyone on here is a bull?

Yea. Your biggest growth / tech stocks have now all far exceeded pre-COVID levels (most likely). All of the positions I'm in currently, I look at as value plays - they are below or at their pre-COVID levels with a near-term catalyst of the world returning more back to normal soon (much like what you were thinking in your original post).
[removed]
I would go with shares because it will be hard to time the short squeeze. Might take a while, maybe even past April, and theta will eat at your option value. Plus, when it squeezes, it might be difficult to sell your calls. Buying shares also means you’re doing your part to squeeze the shorts. 

If you really wanna go with calls, i would say April calls would be better. Whatever strike you can afford. I usually go one strike out of the money
Just lose the $55 dude and it will be ok for sure.  Why risk it?

PLTR doesnt data mine. Its a software suite that ingests tons of different data and allows analysts to examine the data in a more productive way.
vaccine is coming. 

markets are forward looking.

> A postponed vote on landmark legislation ending the federal ban on cannabis will take place within a week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Friday.

> &quot;By advancing the MORE Act, the House of Representatives sends an unmistakable signal that America is ready to close the book marijuana prohibition and end the senseless oppression and fear that this failed policy wreaks on otherwise law-abiding citizens,&quot; said Justin Strekal, political director of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.&quot;Americans are ready to responsibly legalize and regulate marijuana, and this vote shows some lawmakers are finally listening."

> A vote on the bill had been scheduled to take place before the election, but House Democratic leaders delayed it to avoid the optics of appearing to put a vote on cannabis ahead of passing a new coronavirus stimulus package.

Same. Second half of March and April destroyed me. Whenever I try to buy puts now I have a mental breakdown and cry in the shower for an hour with my clothes on.
There’s only one answer: PLTR
I’ll bite a double barrel, sawed off
It’s to the point that even if this doesn’t happen the stock is still going to rocket just from pure speculation so you may as well just buy it now anyways. I’ve seen this DD on multiple other investment platforms from many other people.
The US house votes. Senate won’t do shit.

I know people like to treat it like a meme stock but look into Nio. They have a lot going for them and 2021 looks to be a big year for them. I definitely see them being a triple digit stock by the end of 2021 and probably $200-300 dollars within the next 5 years.

If you think these casinos can survive off a sportsbook app,  you're even dumber than I thought.   Vegas needs people in their resorts,  they don't want you sitting at home gambling $30 on the Raiders from your phone.

They want you sitting at their penny machine, losing the last $100 bill that you brought.  They also want to charge you the $45 resort fee for free internet.
I really appreciate your insight. Disney+ is the real growth factor that I don't give far enough credit too. They could really drive growth and probably hold the parks with that engine. Still kinda rich for me and I don't like playing near 52 week highs..but actually when I think about it, my biggest growth stocks I purchased at 52 week highs.

APHA/ACB, congress votes on weed legalization this week. Mexico will legalize weed before Dec 15
Even if it becomes federally legal , there is already an established market for it . Why go buy a 1/4 from a dispensary for 50$ when my neighbor sells em for 25$ ? Idk about the new states that legalized it but in the past legalizations, you can also just grow your own( it’s east af) . There are no brands like ciroc, ketel one, or crown royal to be attached to. 

There ain’t much room for growth either. people who smoke weed , already smoke weed . Hell , I saw a study a couple of months ago that showed legalization actually decreased the amount of kids smoking weed 

I’m just a pot smoking retard who used to live in Northern California but I’d say if you’re going to invest in anything in the weed industry , let it be companies that produce grow lights

Agreed that is has run up a lot recently, but my perspective is as follows on DIS (if you buy shares): in the medium-term, pretty good risk-reward. 

It is only trading at pre-pandemic levels - none of its assets have been impaired long-term by COVID (unless you think people don’t go back to theme parks / cruises ever), you get exposure to high growth through Disney+ which they own a massive library of movies / content for (Disney, Pixar, Fox, Marvel, LucasFilm). 

The risk is that COVID is around longer than expected, and their theme park business (which is 1/3rd of operations) continues to be a drag on business longer-term. 

In a world where interest rates are near zero, and historically DIS has paid an annual 1.5% div, this seems like there should still be upside. FYI - Disney cancelled their dividend in 2H 2020 after activist investor Dan Loeb urged them to in order to invest all the money in Disney+. Not sure if the dividend comes back - but if they can continue growing Disney+ rapidly, they should see multiple expansion (Netflix trades at 10x revenue and 80x PE)
Momentus position has me convinced I will beat this fucking game come 1/15/21. Dead serious.
Why would Cathie let go of Tesla in the ARK fund? It's their number 1 holding by over a half billion and has made them a ton of money. So many people like ARK simply because it has TSLA. But I do agree with LGVW. Solid spac
3 month account, yeah ur right dude....
A squeeze doesn’t have to be immediate. Some are slow burns. If you zoom out on a Tesla chart for this year though. It does look like some of the momentum is short covering and longs that just never sold.
This is the way

Honestly as long as it’s shares and you’re not leveraged you’re fine. They’re both really good companies with high growth prospects. I’m doing the same and have turned 25k to 65k this year

What in the literal fuck are you talking about?     I am leaving the Bellagio on my way to McCarran airport in 11 minutes.  

Not only is this the most empty I've ever seen it here.  Park MGM, and the Encore at Wynn are closing down midweek,   Linq and Planet Hollywood are not even accepting reservations anymore.

Now that I've covered the first time in decades that Casinos have shut down on the strip due to lack of people,  I will give you the one metric that can't be beat to judge Vegas crowds: 

The wait at Gordon Ramsay burger.  No wait last night.   On a Friday night I walked up to their 25% capacity regulated restaurant and was immediately seated.     25% capacity,  immediately seated.  Friday night. ..

The only people in Vegas right now are those who are jumping on the $20 room deals.   Trust me, these are not the people who are losing $100k at the craps tables, not the people buying $400 dinners,  things that Vegas needs to survive.  

These casinos are fucked. This is the worst advice I've ever seen on WSB.
Yes - people who day trade for a living do this. The key is to obtain [Trader Tax Status](https://greentradertax.com/trader-tax-center/trader-tax-status/how-to-qualify/). You can do this as an individual or under an LLC or S-Corp. I’m not claiming it for this year as I didn’t have enough expenses to make it worth the IRS snooping around (they like to audit validity of TTS, so you need to make sure you have a rock solid case). But I will claim it for next year as well as 475 MTM. I’m not setting up an LLC for myself (just yet), but I will set up a joint LLC with my brother to trade under.

We don't need a new meme stock, this baby (/me slaps Palantir's roof) has room to run.

yeah i'm not familiar with that one but I always get downvoted or ignored for it but i've mentioned a handful of times that 2023 ITM LEAPs on JETS (airline ETF) will likely see great returns. I bought two just 1-2 weeks ago that were up over 12% so i just bought another. LEAP calls in this case are better than shares because you're getting way better leverage per dollar you spend and two years for airlines to come back up is plenty of time and there's practically no theta involved

I do not see airbnb taking off really. Possibly they'll eke out a living though. 

The ""service fees" and "cleaning fees" are insane, sometimes $300 to $500 dollars.  That puts nice places in line with nice hotels. The cancellation policies are draconian, you are at the whims of the host if you cancel, they can refuse your refund then rent out the same room to someone else to double dip $.

Also more and more cities are banning airbnb style rentals specifically.

SNOW. Everyone will continue to question its valuation while it marches towards 1000.
If you go to a casino in December and bet $5,000 then win 100,000 you owe taxes on that 100,000 because that’s income. If you wait a month then bet all that 100,000 at once and lose it you don’t have anymore money but still owe the taxes on that income. It’s not that hard to understand.

I don’t understand why people keep saying after the Dec earnings there will be a dump.

Can’t got wrong with those
Imagine the chaos when the vaccine is ineffective because we can’t distribute it widely enough and rates keep skyrocketing. Hospitals overrun, many areas still in partial lockdown, millions kicked out of their homes while a republican senate blocks any meaningful stimulus. 

I hope none of this comes true but if 2020 has taught me anything it’s that nothing is off the table - and expect the worst lol
That's why you are here looking for advice instead of just doing stocks on your own right ?

Like not even trying to be remotely funny but value investors are literally retarded.

Now they are wanted to buy in at ATH. also this one dude on there yesterday wrote this sad piece about how his father died a couple years back and left him and his brother like 100k, his brother invested all in shit coin and tesla and he did like silver and value. His brother is now a multi millionare and he's still poor lmao

Nah GME aint doing shit after the holidays. If you all actually believe it will then let the gay bears take you down with the ship

I'm not exactly sure what I just watched...
Jan 15 $20 calls or Feb 19 $20 calls?

Not sure which one to pick....

January is more aggressive and about double the profit and risk...

Insiders are allowed to sell their shares, like employees for example. Usually means insiders are selling and tutes are buying the dip. Whether that also applies to PLTR is to be seen. There are arguments that insiders will not sell a lot due to the huge potential everyone sees. But please do your own research on the implications.
They should do an update on this guy's life. He could be here among us right now 👀

Dont be. My husband never wanted to get married because of his crazy baby mama's behavior. Then He met me.

 I'm chill, I use power tools and chip in 50/50. We are a team, I have his back he has mine. Baby mama finally lost it and offed herself. We finally got full custody and raised kid. He loves being married. I love my bonus son. We have a dog. Life is awesome.
Careful, volume was that high for a few days during/after the MSFT announcement and shorts only doubled down. Definitely wait to verify the SI is down or find someone posting S3/ortex info.

I can't believe that the Capital Loss Deduction has been $3000 for like 35 years. Should be $10,000 at least based on inflation. People lost houses in 2008 and businesses now during covid and the only thing they can write off is a lousy $3K a year. This deduction needs to go way up.
Facts.  My biggest loss (thousands and thousands on SPY puts when I was a homo bear) was because I refused to cut my losses.  When I was briefly in break even territory it validated my theory and I didn’t want to lose out on additional gains. Since then I’ll shrug my shoulders if I miss out on making extra money, but ill never lament taking profit (IE: Poor timing in Black Friday brought my profits from 6.5k down to 3.8k.  My wife thought I was going to be upset, to which I said if i make almost 4K a day I’d be happy AF)

Yeah, honestly, I'm quite confident about this company for the same reason I'm confident in BA. - Government backing is a huge fucking asset.  


Military contracts are steady lucrative income.  
Now they're getting more government contracts, in other areas, such as vaccine distribution, and they're trying to increase their commercial clientele.  


However, I've never had such a huge percentage of my portfolio in a single company, and it makes me nervous as fuck.  
I'll probably sell a chunk when it reaches $40, just so I can sleep better at night.
its okay i am sorry you majored in something useless. Please dont fuck up my latte order next time i come through the drive thru window
So here’s my question:  what happens in 6-18 months when Karen and Chad, who have been staying home and jerkin’ it on zoom over the last year, realize that keeping up appearances is now a thing again?  No probs, I’ll just sell some of my all-TSLA portfolio and go on vacation.  Market will correct because white collar people will revert to usual undersaving
Lmao
Thank fuck
Long-dated expiration dates. No one can time the short squeeze, the longer the date the better chance you get of benefitting from the squeeze.
They where given a fair market valuation of $25 from Goldman and Morningstar. Upjohn and mylan merger.
Actually it is only too late if you are betting.  If you are investing I can confirm way better results after 1 year.  My 50% gains aren't WSB wins, but they beat the pants off the old advice I was taking.  

Some of thst gain has been meme stocks here, but not half of it as I don't bet most of what I have.  And options playing has been a net 0 with a lot of excitement both ways.
Oh i remeber a time whe a lot of people came together. Just to watch a movie on a laaaaaarge screen. There was popcorn and coke n stuff ...
Glad you came out of the closet
Yes we did? We just didn't have it ran by the federal government, until they got greedy.

I loaded back into pltr after the dip (35 30C May)... But god damn the people here talking about having 35C for 4 December. At this point I hope it goes up just because so many of you autists going to be talking about $Rope
Even when there’s adultery!
Not to today’s levels you didn’t, nor did you have the social nets that we all might need to fall back on when we back the wrong horse
I am the APEX 🐝.
can't help it, when i see something stupid i have a massive urge to jump in and say something
It's too bad, I have to stop using reddit due to horrible investing ideas.
You can use options in a less autistic way to get the equivalent of shares for less than buying the actual shares.  When Tesla was at 430 I bought several max dated leaps (800ish DTE) for 27k per set.  This gave me a delta of 97, essentially the same as stock ownership, for about a 36% discount compared to shares.  

I’m up a nice chunk of change on them, but some of my more WSB plays (530C 49 DTE) are up much more significantly as far as ROI.  But the key is balance, and cutting losses.  Most importantly, no weeklies— ever.  That shit is 100% lottery ticket gambling, I’ll only do it for shits and giggles with a few hundred bucks to feed the degenerate beast.
Haven't listened in a little while. He does have a calming voice though
See that’s the type of autistic shit I like to see!
Rented dudes? Instant cancellation. There is  no relationship if you sharing. You could date whoever and come home to peace and quiet, Just think of the lights that are not on all day, the extra groceries you not buying and so on.
English plz
Best play is hope for a dip as a huge run right to 200 would be profitable but at these premiums it’s nuts
What? I feel like it's no secret that options are HELLA risky.

Setting t shirts and trading cards won't keep the lights on.

Your savior is just a millennial who has more money on his hands than he knows what to do with. And if you look at his filings, the majority of his shares were bought at around $4.50 and his most recent purchase which was only 100k shares was at $8.5. At this point he has nothing to lose in comparison to the retails who get on board now.

Maybe if you'll bought at $10 I'd say go ahead and ride this thing out.
What’s the point of being in WSB if you are not going to YOLO fully? The entire point is to win really big or go home with nothing but your socks. Right ?

[removed]
Nah that’s just bad economics. 

20% of tax spend is on the military, do you use less or more of that depending on what you consume? If anything, the steadiness of the US market that we all play on is backed by that spend so you use it more than most

PLTR TO 300 EOY because 🚀🚀🚀
Men cannot both have a family and move very high in their careers without a traditional wife who takes care of the other important aspects of managing a home.

Likewise, mother's can't both work 40 hours a week and be as involved in their children's lives as much as they might like.

Expecting everyone, or even most people, to be completely independent is not realistic. Cohabitation breeds *some* dependence, unless both people are just especially individualistic, and there is never talk of starting a family.
I didn’t have a savings account when I went from 3k to 17k to 25k then lost it.  What I did was take a break, learn, study, and figure out what I did wrong.  I make significantly more from options and trading than I do at my job and have now recouped my losses.  If you can admit you have a problem, maybe you can learn what you did wrong in terms of strategy.
Bluecrest added 7MM shares, Mizuho 1.5MM and BMO 2.5MM as per the latest filing.   


I would add under 12.50 again but anything over 13 before Dec. 3 may be above most's  risk profile.

I’ve modeled out Tesla to trillions in market cap over the long term, depending on different things manifesting, to upwards of 5T market cap in 2030. I don’t plan on selling any shares unless the fundamentals really change or they stop innovating.

HOLY SHIT let’s bet on sports

Doesn’t work that way my dude
Exactly my point lol. It takes time for any company to get recognized by average retail level people.
I may eat it, but with copper prices going up everyday. I got a couple close to ITM for Jan15 that are still priced reasonably that I feel pretty good about churning out a gain over next few weeks. Probably not like it was with jump last week, but see no reason to lower FCX value now so should be low risk play (I hope!)
What’s that mean

Wsb, where autists with gambling addictions offer to pay for other addicts to go to gamble.
I have 0 investments rn and I'm waiting till monday to see PLTR lol.
Ikrrr samee
Ok I’ll buy Monday and hold till Friday and watch it moon
Was this made in Microsoft paint?
if you read it on WSB...
you would be buying into GME one week before earnings

you wanna play GAMESTOP earnings?

also very very very unlikely that it short squeezes despite what everyone tells you, most people don't understand what a short squeeze really is
*its?
Idk how else to reach you simps but go watch the limiting factor video for Tesla on silicon anodes. 

Basically, if Tesla solves using silicon as an anode, the resulting battery will have similar performance aspects to solid state.

I’m gonna yolo my 12k savings on GME Monday morning because I hate working.
" The trade date, Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said."  

oh shit TSLA on Quad witching sounds veryyyyyy spooky.
Upvoted for saying two areas of growth and then numbering them both 1.
I am going to suckle all of these out of X C’s like it’s my mother pig and I’m just a baby piglet hungry for the funds
GME squeeze doesn't need to be real if we will it into existance
When we load up on options >they have to buy shares to cover > stock price goes up> tendies and tots in our pockets
This is a casino. Not a fraternity.
Why not yolo half into PLTR and the other into GME come Monday morning?
[removed]
Yeah story just feels so fake, atleast he make a 10x return on Reddit karma

You would lose everything if you bet against it.
I remember when they had ipo and alot of 'analysts' were saying they liked frog better than snow. Thx for the heads up bru
Yes I follow it and it's way better than WSB as there's less gimps with "PLTR GO BRRRRRR" posts every 20 mins. There's also more discussion
Lol upmost, dude wtf is wrong with you. Utmost, please read a book.

Stock Exchange doesn't have enough volatility for me. Anyone else want in on APLL? Not AAPL, APLL.
Pull out half once it doubles and let house money ride.
Recall news already came out friday morning didnt it?
That is probably the most interesting post I have read here today.
Collectively if everyone was on board, 20 shares a person. But only a few individuals, going to need a few thousands shares.
Tragic is a better word.
I don’t see PLTR or TSLA on there, so i have to short your entire portfolio.
Works until it doesn't, that's how bubbles work. As soon as a stock that's hot around here goes south, people move on and forget about it. If you can't recall anything that people piled into and then it crashed, you either have terrible memory or haven't been here very long.
35
As so somebody who runs with scissors, I congratulate you.
best of luck haha

it hurts that i sold my $440 call like two weeks ago
Looks like I still have time to yolo
This and GME, I can't keep taking out loans on my wife's boyfriends house
This is the play now.
Yeah, I make 6 figures so options was just a way for me to gamble and hopefully come out ahead. 

Taxes? You pay those? Just kidding. I take a percentage, of my winnings, and set it aside for the tax man. People get in trouble when they say "I made $20k off this option" and forget that they really on made a portion of that because uncle sam wants his.
AirPod pros for sure. Apple stock is worthless.

Np!
Proof that triple leveraged options that expire in an hour are less risky that women.
Has anybody used sqzme for dark pool indicators? Any success/recommendations/alternatives?
So if the earnings are dreadful then the speculators will sell off until the price is low enough for the short sellers to be comfortable buying back, meaning the price could tank? 

Or is it more likely that the short sellers will buy at any sign of a dip keeping the price afloat?
im retarded right, is the gme squeeze real or what, i could put 25k into it if it is
It would be funny if ARK went short on TSLA.  Free money for them if they do.  Switched over from spy and qqq to the ark funds in my retirement account that doesn’t allow individual stocks or options.

What a bunch of pussies over on r/stocks. If he posted that over here we would have helped him lose it all and then some.
If they still takin profit ima buy another paycheck of shares
Just here to say I'm a complete and total degenerate gambler.... I know this. I also have multiple accounts to keep my yolo tendencies within some boundaries.  I have 2 accounts I do not touch except for S&P market-weighted DCA investing.... and 2 others in which I can be an unhinged manic gambler chasing WSB shit.
My thoughts too. Hopefully these paper handed lads can drop it to $25 tomorrow, then I'll get back in for some $30c monthlies.
Gotcha, so we just keep buying and buying!
No, buy low, sell high. Then buy even higher and sell even higherer.
Too many good plays to mess with CRSR right now. Even if drops slow, no real possibility for big gains.
NOK has been shit for a year, and will continue to be shit.
It's going to jump and crash and swing 5% maybe 10% first hour.

I've got 2 contract from friday I fucked up. Bought at 800. Worth about 250 eod.


Ideally you buy a 12/4 33 call and sell 2 12/4 31s to not have a crazy risk exposure.

But you could just buy calls a little above the strike price at market open and hopefor Wednesday again.
Why that date? If the earnings on 8 dec are good shouldn’t we expect to still see some good growth by 31 dec and see some of those premiums increase?
Consumption taxes make sure you're paying for what you use. Taxing income is just government being greedy.
I don’t think Tesla will as rewarding for the next year or two as it was from the March lows and till today.
That’s what I like to hear bro!
think so
I'll join ya on Monday. 

I just read that S&P will have to buy 100bn worth of Tsla lol
Yes to georgia. They won't get 1 of the seats for sure, likely to lose both. So no tax increase

Yeah I’m pretty sure people aren’t being clear about this. You owe taxes on your **realized gains** for that tax year. If you don’t sell you don’t owe tax (on those unrealized gains cuz it’s still just riding the market).

you'll need a big upswing to print and it just had a massive run up, but it's TSLA so i guess it's possible

On your calls, prob not.  By your boyfriend last night, probably.

Right. That's exactly what I'm thinking
A similar play is there with Alcoa (AA). Stock is up over 50% through November.

Aluminum outlook for 2020 was already very bearish with very low demands and very high supplies. COVID hit and put a wet blanket on manufacturing metals like Aluminum/Steel.

I tried making a couple plays on Alcoa this year and if I had timed my expiries better I'd probably have over half a mill on only a few thousand in options. I wasn't as interested in X.

But I second the general outlook of there being more room to run in a short time.

X getting to 20 and AA to 30 by next summer seem like great bets.

Put more simply, these are manufacturing stocks that were already suppressed by high supply/low demand and COVID put a drag on the recovery. Demand is starting to creep up from the lowest of lows and will make up for lost time in the stock prices.

as long as you remember that, you'll be fine...

start thinking you're the shit, and you'll get smoked
Most likely, yes.  Higher stock price increases SBC of currently issued awards which decreases profit.  However, I imagine they have some sort of adjusted GAAP metric that pulls it out to impress investors.

I think the most appalling part of all this was the “spousal support” BS. You’re not even married and don’t even have kids. Fuck Canada. And don’t overthink it, just leave. Kick her ass to the curb. Change the locks and change your number. Get a doorbell/outdoor cam to record who’s coming and leaving your place. If her crazy ass tries to break in, file a restraining order.
Why didn't you leave her the first time she brought a male prostitute to your house? I don't see how money is stopping you considering she is just a leech anyways. Weird!
Am pumping as hard as I can xD 
But it's quite expensive when you consider that I dont live in the states and my monthly salary is around $1200 ( which is pretty good in my country ). I'm not poor, I just dont often buy myself expensive things so a $1000 watch is quite expensive in comparison haha
Balls deep in PLTR 12/4 33c’s. Am i fucked?
Y’all really think weed is going to the moon? I’d definitely invest the growing side of it rather than dispensaries
Gracias. I see that, but I do think some of the current runs are premature. There will be dips along the way till at least Q4 next year.
I bough shares. Have been hearing a lot about calls, what is it exactly?
Lol. Cute

Your girlfriend sounds like the type to go to the police and accuse you of a crime you didn't commit after you dump her. Good luck.

What does that have to do with anything?
Maybe budget airlines for vacation travel will rebound a little. As a left coaster that used to commute every week between Seattle and SF for work and every quarter to Europe, it feels like it’ll be years before business travel gets back to what it was pre-COVID. Zoom might just kill my airline miles altogether.
I don’t know if I would say all EV’s by 2030 is “all in”. If they were going “all in” they would have announced an aggressive phase out of all ICE vehicles across all of their brands much sooner than that and would have to start pumping majority of money into EV. The sad truth is they need the ICE for the time being but in essence, that is taking away time and money from full focus and expedited rollout of EV’s.

A more difficult decision than whether to invest in stocks is whether to invest in your relationship.
I've taken $150K to $5K and I know I don't know what I'm doing!
More or less I agree. I don't usually follow their picks because by the time they pick them it's usually too late to get in. But I know a lot of people follow them and if they're finally getting onto NIO then it's probably got a lot of gas left.

This is the way
I like your dd but is TLDR something like buy any GME C at least a month out?
Buy a call, if it has a 50 delta, bank buys 50 shares for every contract they sell you so they take off risk.  Stock goes up, they buy more stock to take off more risk.
Buying something unnecessary I can afford with excess cash vs. Going into debt for something unnecessary. There's quite a difference.

Well done man. How long are you planning to hold Tesla for
This would be the rotation from growth / tech into value that has been happening in the past 6 weeks. Markets are forward looking - so it's already looking at what the world would look like 6 - 12 months from now post-vaccine.

See the tremendous run-up in movie theaters, theme parks, travel (airlines), hotels, leisure, retail, energy (oil), basic materials and interest-rate sensitive businesses (banks). I still think there is room to run

Positions: VALE, CNK, BAC, JWN, UAA, XOM, DIS
Thanks !
No, that some companies with good IP/products actually do moon eg Tesla etc. What's to say that PLTR isn't similar?
It was $19 when that guy was pumping it a few months ago and it's $30 now. So that's 50% in four months. Sure, PLTR did that in a week, but I think we have to put PRPL in the win column.
Like seriously what is wrong with those people. They treat the stock market like it's a savings account when it is obviously a casino.

True. Bought a PLTR 22c 11-2021 call for $650. Sold it for $1500 on Friday before dip. Really low risk, considerable reward.

This will be a wildly growing space as thawing permafrost exposes the world to long-dormant pathogens.
Further, the mRNA vaccine process truly revolutionizes vaccine development like nothing seen before. With COVID, this went from unknown pathogen to finished pre-clinical work in four months.  That's a process that normally takes 2-4 years.  This vaccine methodology is billed as a "plug-and-play" vaccine delivery mechanism, with infinite reusability.  Some are saying flu pandemics will never happen again because of how fast we can now go from sequenced genome to created vaccine.  There's also HUGE applications for agriculture, where we may soon see a time where herd cullings for disease control are a thing of the past because of this tech.
BioNTech, the group that developed the Pfizer candidate, was originally working on cancer vaccines, as I believe was mentioned elsewhere.

Just from what little I know of the actual science, which is probably more than average, but still not very much, I could see this being greatly applicable to modern genetics research.  If you want to preview what a DNA edit would do to a protein and the resultant change in function, before permanently editing the DNA with something like CRISPR, you could, I would think,, use this process to introduce the mRNA you'd expect your DNA change to produce, to see the change in a temporary form.  /u/Promo7 can correct me here if I'm wrong, they seem more well-versre in this than me.
You’d need the destinations to be taking vaccines as well for it to work. I don’t count on Belize getting the vaccine any time soon

If you aren’t lying then $23 is a comfortable place to be in. Actually a really comfy place. I can see it bouncing back and hitting $40 or $50 by EOY. 

I do not own any PLTR btw. Just sideline analyst.
Just because WSB is meming PLTR doesn’t mean it’s worthless or a pump and dump. Do some DD on the company my guy
[removed]
None dude your legit dumb if you think this sub has many pull in the market. 99% of people holding PLTR here are going to lose it all and for weeks we will see fat loss porn because they diamond hands and never sell and lose all the value in there contracts. Kodak, Nio, spy puts, quad witching hour, RKT, purple gang. The idiots find a good stock, but fail then2nd vibe check and that's timing. Thats why we see so many portfolios with massive 10k 20k spikes than it imminently drips into the red.
It'll be interesting to see what RIOT opens at on Monday. I loaded up on 7$ 1/15/21 calls on Fridays low and seeing shitecoin bouncing back from last week makes me think RIOT will as well

Make sure they get COVID first.  I don’t taste or smell a thing, but I sure as shit am not going to eat my own shit to try it

Rocky road between now and the vaccine. Some lockdowns are a near certainty at this point and they are not baked in. Hard to say what that will do to airlines and cruises. Airlines could get a bump when stim talks get rekindled this coming week. 

I think there will be a buy-in opportunity with these in the next several weeks. If you’re buying to hold until retirement then go for airlines anytime.

Dividend coming back. EU partnerships accelerating. They are priced at basically half of their peers despite sales growth in EU China and India. New board and their old giga-chad CEO is back

Downsides: monolith of a company that won't make an agile moon mission. This is a 5- year play. Buy shares, turn on your DRIP once the dividend comes back, enjoy the ride.

Trevor sounds like the kind of guy who tries to make out with his guy friends when he's drunk and then plays it off like it was just the alcohol, it's no big deal and he's definitely not gay
Pretty sure its only realized gains. So it would be on 5k. When people get fucked is if say they make 50k, don't pull any for taxes, and then lose it all January 1st. They still owe taxes for the previous on 50k

Here's what you do. Make another 50k in Dec then lose the entire 100k on Jan 1st. U will reallly get to experience bbc porn in real life

It's all fun and games but when these stocks go steady eddy, there's gonna be a lot of people holding out on the hopes of it going up more and the real tears will flow as people cash out.

I appreciate your post OP, I'm looking at major gains people are making and it's reinforcing the idea that these are outliers.

Premiums so high right now, 12/18 short strangles on ACB pay out $370 premium for only $472 buying power reduction on Tastyworks for about a +75% return on BPR

Breakeven points right around $15.20 and $6.80 with a max profit in between $10.50 and $11.50

Honestly tempting 🤔

edit: that's when you sell to open both a call and a put both OTM. You can do it the naked way or the pussy way and buy 100 shares beforehand

Ok so I’m new to Wall Street bets and kinda new to trading in general, how does stuff like PLTR happen and why are people so optimistic with GME, I’ll gladly help out it’s just I want to know more about the process since I’m new, and how much do I have to put in to see big gains? Thanks man
Time decay vs IV. The battle to ER.

Nevertheless if I were to do this I might miss the pump. And look at the run up to last ER. Didn’t now work out week for them.

Yes, fatality rates could be declining by as much as a third. If rona rates spike to 3 times previous levels, what happens to the total number of deaths? What is the added effect of full hospitals on fatality rates? How many dead patients can hospitals deal with before they need to increase storage capacity for bodies?

If you won 10K, wouldn’t you only have to lose 2K to counter the taxes. I’m next level autist but I think you can deduct 100% of your losses but only have to pay 20% on gains. As I’m typing this it seems wrong, but that’s what my brain has been telling me for some reason. Maybe I’ll spend the same amount of time typing this to research, nah fuck that.

Short squeeze, the stock is so shorted that it just takes a little bit of wind for it to explode.
And now how far do you ride that baby up? My pullout game will be put to the test.
Look, everyone makes their own choices in life. I was happy with PLTR at $13.5, then look what happened!

Gme might literally be worth $50/share soon. It might go to $0, it depends on you. I think buying shares Monday and holding through January is once in a lifetime money 🤷‍♀️🚀🚀🚀

Koalas eat their own shit, so that must means PLTR is going to hit $40 for that one idiot
Exactly why you should invest in DKNG right now. But anyways if hotels take a dip due to another lockdown it’s still a great play, regardless of Vegas or gambling.

Is someone gonna tell this autistic mfer? US steel is dying because of inept management and the failure to update its tech and process. Arcelor is running regardless of Covid infections and as long as Biden doesn’t mess with the tariffs then they will benefit when things pick up. If you want in on steel then I highly suggest investing into Cleveland Cliffs.

If you guys want to see your stuff get pumped, then hope these guys give it a buy rating.  Every tine they send out a buy alert they are also buying the stock themselves with massive cash.  Each buy notification is an automatic bump to whatever stock within 20 minutes of notification.  These guys are like an inverse of Citron and they do real DD so they have a strong subscription base that also follows their buy recommendations. 

TLDR, the motley fool pumping your stock is a GOOD thing.

I’ve heard of bear, bull and kangaroo, but what does a koala market look like?
Here's a idea. I think there is a chance that like Disney, Netflix or amazon buy the theatres. They will show there movies there before it will come on the actual streaming services. This would be a subscription for like 20 a month. You get both Netflix and a Netflix movie theatre pass. Just spit balling here but doesn't seem unreasonable
I hope OP listens to you. 




I also hope he posts his positions or gets banned.

Good points, but I wouldn’t try to time the top with calls. I would sell a little earlier. More likely to sell that a way, and still make more since option leverage. Its likely the squeeze could last a few days or more. Plenty of opportunity to sell.  But who knows, I’m in on shares.
Pltr has to go up 35.6% next week for me to make $28 dec4 33c
Is Urban Meyer going to coach Michigan?
The argument could have been more nuanced, I agree. I wanted to make a point about the overvaluation. Unity has a decent balance sheet, but the 40B valuation is too high atm.
He’s going to sell calls on those shares and make 100x
Epic DD and people moan, I suppose mindlessly jumping into a certain stock is more simpler.
So since this sub has been flooded with PLTR, any other decent tickers to look at?

This doesn't check out.  The logistical cost difference between transporting at -20 and transporting at -80 is astronomical, and would make it exceedingly difficult, if not completely impossible,  to reach markets where advanced refrigeration is scarce.

Buying Amazon 10 years ago woulda done something too. Retard.
I don't care how many DDs I see on GME, or even if you fucks get rich on it. There is not a single part of me that thinks that piece of shit is worth more than the butt chunder I'm analy vomiting into my toilet right now; and for that reason, I'm out.

Shits going to be like the lights coming on at 3 AM at a nightclub
For sure. What I'm wondering though is if GME will cash in on the recent surge and unload a bunch of shares. They bought back at around $5 so they are already up 300%.
What the fuck did I just read!? Your girlfriend is renting other men? You have to pay spousal support to a girlfriend because of a cohabitation agreement? You think PLTR will only hit $40!?

I want to cry. I thought today was Monday 🤡
That’s not why I recommend GME. A lot has been written about it, but they have great revenue, great margins and a huge amount of cash on hand. They are worth 1 billion now, but if they had the same multiple as CHWY (they got the similar revenue and margins) they would be worth $30 billion, or $500/share. 

Also, the CEO of chwy just became the largest share holder of GME and is threatening a hostile takeover. This is once in a lifetime money, watch 🚀🚀🚀

No it's called bag holding for a reason. But then you are reducing your base capital, so it's one step forward one step back, as losing trades cut your liquidity ~30% at least if your risk tolerance includes all in plays

Usually it refers to people who sell out of fear of losing their money rather than understanding and accepting the risk associated with their position. Ideally, you want to have a system in place or at least an understanding of how much risk you are taking on. If you suddenly exit a position because you can’t stomach watching the volatility then you either didn’t understand what you were doing or you didn’t accurately assess your risk appetite.

Yes, but in the same way Apple makes their iPhones. Tim isn't rolling up his sleeves in Cupertino fitting tiny little undersized batteries into them...
You'll get there. I was you 12 months ago. Just looking for enough to pay off everything but the house. 

The key is to take profits and minimize loses. Paper hand everything. I'll quickly cash out if I'm up 25%-50%. Am I getting rich super quick? No but I'm also not losing it all cause I'll cut kisses after I'm down 10-15%. Sure you could be missing out on some massive gains but if you are really in it to pay off stuff then play smart.
Fidelity is awful.  E*TRADE is better esp if you have access to their Power E*TRADE platform (desktop version). Trading view is a pretty good app for charting if youre using iPhone or iPad
Agreed dogshit or not we're buying in. NIO is dogshit too lol I still made 30k off that.

 It's not December 31 like most people think. It's three days after they REPORT for that quarter. Feb/march timeframe. Just watch for their earnings date for Q4

What is your time horizon for needing to withdraw? You can contribute $6,000 a year into a Roth IRA. Earnings are never taxed, and I think you can withdraw contributions without penalty. But if you need the cash any time soon that might not be the best solution

I feel you man, I brought a very high strike price debit put 330/325 put debit expiring 12/18 last Friday. But gonna see what’s gonna happen on Monday. But usually cloud stocks they are over priced when it comes to actual earnings. (Just look at fastly, but NET went up a lot in its earnings so hmm)
It doesn't track the big index proportionally and that makes me not trust it.
Hotels have have actually started to make a small comeback and many motel 8 type places have done very well throughout the pandemic due to truck drivers still needing places to stay while on the road. There was a huge demand for those rooms because that sector of the market skyrocketed with everybody home. Edit: as far as i’m concerned about movie theaters I think you’ll see an initial comeback when restrictions are let up but they’ll die out soon when people realize again that they aren’t fun and way too expensive and you can rent the same movie from your apple TV for $4.
wait what? i'm confused

Are we the only guys that have actually shop at gamestop? They are atrocious.

No amount of leadership is gonna save a company stuck in the past. If they focused more on selling hardware and repairs then. I wouldn't short it.

The money they make is purely based on a lack of competition
 It is a good brand but they are really riding on faithful customers(with nostalgia) who have nowhere else to go.


Its good for a pump tho, but i wouldn't buy leaps here.

As we head into the start of holiday shopping season, we are seeing a surge of consumer demand for Apple’s AirPods Pro with some good discounts on the horizon. We estimate that Apple is on pace to sell over 90 million AirPods units in 2020 and is now on a trajectory to potentially reach 115 million units in 2021, with a new version slated to be unveiled in the April-May 2021 time frame. Attach rates for existing iPhone customers remain extremely high around the new AirPods Pro, with our estimates that Apple will sell roughly 18 million AirPods during the course of the next month, with this product on pace to yet again be a clear star of Black Friday and the holiday season. While AirPods today are on a trajectory to represent 5%-plus of overall revenue, this product category continues to speak to the unparalleled flywheel that CEO Tim Cook and Apple have with 950 million iPhones worldwide under its belt and 1.4 billion active devices to tap into around the world and thus further monetize through products/services, as we continue to see with the Apple Watch, as well. Price target: $150.

I'm astonished that Canada's common law marriage goes into effect after 1 year. In the US states that have common law marriage (only 8 out of the 50), it usually takes something like 7 years of cohabitation.

Don't take anything from me because I'm retarded, but perhaps it could be due to China not recognizing Taiwan as a country and the rest of the world not trying to step on the dick of China.

Why has this post been removed?
Either of us could read the S1 to find out. There are many flavors of stock comp, and how to account for them. Companies used to give out options because there was no cost associated with at the money grants. I am not sure how that change has impacted how companies incent workers under the current rules. You may still be able to account for expected forfeitures under RSU’s, but I am less certain of that without more research.
"Real shit" didn't you read the part where they have crippling debt? They're in some real shit.
I’ve used it, and it is ok, but overpriced is what I’m saying. Look at why certain arms of US military dropped it. I’m not saying people don’t need data lol.

Dunno. Its all open sourced info from various interviews and various youtube videos. People just arent that into research.

For example how many people dont even what their product is? I found in depth examples in minutes on youtube (seadch "palantir iran", check out GovCon7).

Not sure what this dude is looking st to claim their spend more in sales than in revenue, but im guessing hes looking at the operating costs and not understanding whats he reading. IIRC (and my numbers are probably off), they previously spent 75m on sales when dealing with gov contracts. They recently spent 250-300m due to expanding to commercial sector. Definitely not "more than they make".

Algorthimtich warfare is the future. Entire DOD and all our allies are investing heavily into it. Guess who is the leader in that industry?

The insider sales argument is a weak as well. Cohen is the only questionable one as he has almost liquidated all his shares (from 3.5m to 500k left). Rest of all the officers sales are minuscule in terms of their outstanding holdings. So they are probably just taking profit and retaining the majority of their shares for future growth.
But it's already 25.4. Will you be able to call for the current price or low even if the premium is high? How does that work?

I tripled my life savings IDGAF xD It's just funny how financially illiterate the average person is
You think? I'm seeing things look like the early 90s as far as commerce. My thought is that this will drive a cultural shift where people will actually start to miss people.. I think there is even a potential for a more solid placement of brick and mortar retail in the future..but that's probably because I am really depressed and want that.
Explain like my brain is smooth as an egg. If days to cover is based on current short float divided by average daily volume, then all we have to do is drastically increase the daily volume to drastically decrease the time to cover? Doesn’t that sound like a short squeeze situation—volume will not be “average” during the squeeze.

They spend more money on selling their product than their whole revenue, see my source. 

The moment they stop spending so much money on their sales, they stop selling and increasing revenue. 

Show me a source that they barely spend money on sales, because I showed a source that states the opposite lol.

choices are limited: integrated steel (X, CLF), mini-mills (NUE, STLD, Big River Steel (in Australia)

X has highest cost structure  => ops leverage, profitability sensitive to price upswings 

X has highest financial leverage => change in profitability, most impact on equity

if you are bullish on cyclicals, bet on the one with the most leverage. Period.

Had a discussion with a similar young kid, who asked to buy shares on monday. couldnt respond at all.
I hope everyone going in on gme makes bank, but I will not go near it lol. In my good for nothing opinion, I see it going right back down to like 5 a share. If you want a reason as to why I think this, there's a few. I'll give a couple. One being my dick is massively girthy. Two being Microsoft helping them and some fuckwad saying gamestop could be this should be that, means nothing lol. This type of busy selling everything out only happens when  consoles come out. Other than when there's a new release, gamestop in my area is legit dead. Some days they won't even be open on their scheduled business days cuz you guessed it.. no business lol. 

I get it. I want it to work. But I had the chance to go in several times this past week and I couldn't do it. Didn't feel right. Hopefully I'm wrong and people continue to get rich. But imo gamestop is dead, this is just one last attempt to revive it, and it's not gunna work. No, I dont have puts, every dime I have is in the company who must not be named.

This is tangential to tech, but automation is going to be a big theme in the next 5-10 years. Control theory is a relatively unexplored field in terms of speculation and real world application. This extends to HVAC, which is due for a global rehaul in the West (more efficiency -> green).

EMR, ABB (process automation)
CARR, JCI, IR (hvac)
WM (spec play, waste management is under good stewardship and could use more investment in automation)

Some more safe plays in infrastructure would be Lyft/Uber as urban planning is reconsidered.

I'm also watching the drone space, as shipping becomes automated (commercial), armed conflict heats up, I run with AMBA here (good stewardship, market segments in asia and US, broad market application) and Boeing has a good moat as well.

Finally, audio processing is going to be hot imo. Again, automating audio processing in the commercial space, as in on demand processing, is a latent field. My play here has been Dolby (DLB), good leadership and broad market application, huge moat.

Not all of these will be winners, there will be gems and duds. Cheers

From what you've written it really does sound like she's using you. Mental health issues or not, you're a person, and you deserve to be with someone that makes you happy. You are not her father. She is not your responsibility.


I just got myself out of a bad relationship. If your situation is like mine, be prepared. She is going to fuck with your head in so many different ways, and you won't realize until shit has died down.


I hate to say it, but if you've let it get this far, you're probably a compassionate person. It's a complement not an insult, but people like us are a lot more susceptible to emotional abuse. Naturally we put the feelings of others above our own, and that's a hard habit to break. 


I seriously recommend hitting up YouTube, and watching videos on how to deal with a narcissist. 


I don't know what your girl is like, but my ex is relentless, and it honestly fucked with my head. There are so many different methods of manipulation, and she would never just admit to the truth. She'd make it seem like I was the problem, or suddenly she'd have a big crisis, and I would need to come to the rescue, or shed half admit to the truth, and pretend to change, or she'd become super affectionate, or she'd just straight up deny. Deny, deny, deny.


Worst is when they make you feel like you're hurting them by standing up for yourself. 


Good luck, and forget the idiots calling you out. They're programmed differently.

We are talking about gamestop and you are a retard. I'm jumping in on this at market open. Probably with an April expiration.
10%? That’s like making an excuse to go home during a date if she laughs at your jokes 😆 Not a bad strat if you don’t have any extra money to invest in the future, but assuming you have steady employment and you bought into a solid company at a sane valuation, I’d hold at least some of the shares.

I don’t put so much money in an individual stock that I can’t afford to loose it, I don’t buy stocks who’s company I don’t firmly believe in, I don’t buy stocks when their valuation is insane (I’ll still hold though) and if it goes up 50-100%, I sell the initial investment (or just part of it if I think it’s truly mooning) and ride the houses’ money. This way if the stock is a bubble, I can use that money to buy in at a lower price, and I’ve mitigated my risk in the unlikely event the stock crashes, and in the less likely event it delists, I don’t loose my entire portfolio, all while holding my lunch bag under the tendie printer.
I worry for my positions when all you autistic fucks start posting DD on it 3 months after me. Fuck you cunts stay away I was making bank.
>that is still not profitable

Why is that an argument in this case? A lot of companies take years to make a profit, Amazon took 10 years to make a profit for example.

30k for this week WHATS the play?
Your DD game is weak.

- They make money. I assume you mean they have never been profitable which is true. Looking to be profitable within the next two quarters.

- PLTR has historically had barely any expenditures in sales and marketing. Not really needed for gov contracts which was their forte. They are increasing it now  as they expand to commercial.

- nah its not an easy to replicate product. Its also not easy to replicate the fedramp process and the lettered agency connections. They also have on site staff for their clients (forward deployed engineers), which is unique in their industry and is a great asset to the clients.

- Truth. Ive been watching institutional ownership creep up but id like to see it higher. Not sure it has to do with the direct listing or what.
That is what deposits are for.

There is a concept in stock comp accounting called anticipated forfeitures. This is already baked into the calculations. Any new grants will be at the current market rate and are costed similar to a 10 year leap. With the increase in IV you autists have effectively increased future comp costs. As noted elsewhere, this is a non-cash cost, but any options exercised will dilute your tendies.

You’re not wrong, and personally I think the stipulation Theil and Karp (tried to?) put into their listing that would allow them to sell all of their shares without losing control of the company has major “dropping these bags” vibes. A lot of people are making money on it right now though and as long as you are riding the momentum and don’t look at it as a long term hold it’s a nice gain. We’ll see how things shake out for those holding PLTR for years, it might surprise us both.

I do wish there was less spam by people that have no idea what the company does or the industry it operates in, tho.

Same thing happened with FUV bought 600 at $6 and it shot up to $17 but already sold everything at $7 cause it looked like a shit stock. Now Im in FNKO and Im just waiting for this shit to pump like never before.
It gets more realistic if it involves cuckoldry though.

How did you calculate p/e of 55? It’s 155 according to my calcs
No bro read a book
Idk but the legend of u/analfarmer2 lives on
i was just talking about one-letter tickers with someone today, lol, and was surprised by US Steel's very low cap for its stature (or I guess former stature) and the fact that its ticker is one letter, lol. i guess actually in general that a lot of them were just random companies. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

anyway, this is good DD. nice. i definitely didn't expect an old, grizzled, "classic" company like this to be featured here - let's see if it becomes the next meme stock, lmao. i doubt it, though, but hey, good DD.

Edit: i just reread this and i can tell i'm not making much sense at this hour lmao
Hmm yea understood. But eg for example if GME moons up to 1000++ won’t MM’s know it’s just temporary and thus they won’t buy the options?

And as for exercising them you’d also need capital and I guess reasons we do options is cause most of us don’t have the money to buy that much of the underlying

Errr no it’s not... forward p/e is around 155

Fellow Canadian here. Hang in there man, PLTR will skyrocket and you'll be the one that got away.
Why zero? Seems pretty well supported.
you could invest in my very own personal savings account with negative interest!
You Europoors are weird
This question makes 0 sense. How the F can stock comp impact revenues? It can’t. Stock comp can only impact cost,which in turn decreases the gross margin. It is a non-cash transaction, but dilutes the value of your tendies through the increased float.

You are ignorant to the language of business. Please just go buy a stable ETF and retire in 40 years.
the odds of winning the jackpot in lotto is extremely small. for Mega Millions jackpot odds are 1 in 302,575,350. If every single WSB subscriber bought a ticket (and no ticket numbers were the same) it would cover just over 0.5% of the possible outcomes.  


there have been numerous moments in the past where groups have gotten together and created a strategy to ensure a win: They watch for the JP to reach the magical number where the jackpot is bigger than the cost of covering every number combination, pool their money together and strategically play every combination possible.  


Even then though it's a risky play because multiple people can win at which the JP gets divided equally between them, causing a 50% loss.  


These groups often operate silently to avoid attention, but some have been open about it

Theoretically options. But in a squeeze spike, they are less liquid, so selling them is harder to time.
TSLA is still going up to ATH.

I'd say half back in
I really just trade on sentiment, macro speculation as I size my plays at a 5% cap and my attention is divided. 

Commodities are difficult to game because there's pros who watch this stuff all day. So it's more buy and hold for me

So no metrics. Really just waiting for Biden to indicate infrastructure projects, then making a larger play. Good luck

Options. But it’s hard to time and could expire before the action.
I've been having to take it slow and miss out on some of the rockets.  I could afford put in 350. Have had to do some smaller plays as premium on some of the memes is just outside of my comfort with such a small accout.  Which has been working, have increased it to up over a 1k now on just a couple weeks.  Also fairly diversified so I dont get wiped out with one bad play.  Taking it as a learning experience.
Do you guys even know, that this year was a year of the Rat by Chinese calendar? You know when was the previous year of the Rat? 2008. And guess what the next year will be? The BULL year! I shit you not - check it.

Also note, that the Chinese New Year begins not on Jan 01, but somewhat later, that is why the bottom of 2008 crash ended a bit in 2009.

Boys, I am a bit sad that I missed the PLTR train, but how dont you see these red flags?

* PLTR never made money
* PLTR spends more money on selling their product than their whole revenue [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/financials?p=PLTR) 
* The principle of their product is easy to copy and improve by others. (combine all available data and help companies make decisions based on that.)  
* Stock is owned mostly by retail, while it is a b2b consultancy firm in a not so transparent industry. That does not make sense.

I didnt say this. I said you should sell or buy according to your own belief. And it seems you want to buy. Go ahead.

*" all the paper hands investor pussies at the big banks are gonna sell and take profits "*

I didnt say this. I said "if only 0.5% people take profits, it will create a selling pressure larger than a day's trading volume"

*" tracked the movements of the last 10 stocks that had their lock up period end "*

Apple is moving their manufacturing from China to Vietnam. Not Taiwan.  Apple is keeping the same Chinese manufacturing company, they're just changing the location from inside of China to outside of China to avoid the Mainland China trade sanctions.  Apple is still going to use Foxconn which is a Chinese company whether it's made in China or made in Vietnam.

Huawei doesn't pay TSMC or any other company to fab their chips because they have their own fabs in China.

The only thing Huawei buys is stolen intellectual property, and they buy it at a tiny fraction of what the stolen intellectual property is worth. For this to work, another company needs to create it first.

I learned how to actually find if there’s some truth to stuff instead of following my gut
ya i moved out in july and live in a much, much better environment with cheaper rent and i actually have a yard now

you're right haha, i do not know how to fix a door, and my roommate was the one that installed it actually
500 "for sure" is the short queeze scenario (or some tesla-hype regarding e-commerce for gamers) but here is a inaccurate explanation (maybe you can call it autistic conspiracy):

GME stock is heavily shorted (for years) but now change is possible about to come to shift their strategy (and thus might increase stock prices due to positive perspective in the future)

compared to other stocks if this one gets pumped it will get pumped a lot because the short sellers are forced to buy at a certain point to cut their potential losses therefore you cannot compare them to anything else

if we reach a certain level we can take the rocket emoji literally as in a short squeeze scenario noone will satisfy with measily 30-40% profit
You don't buy two minute options? You are missing out!

Hello, does your statement mean that GME will drop in april?
Rip my 12/4 40
Thanks for this. Though re catalyst timings, this late October press release stated early Q1 2021 for interim UK data, is the sooner update due to UKs second wave accelerating the 66th case occurrence?

Everyone thinks it’s going back to 13k-14k, which is why that won’t even happen.
Then your are in the right place
No thanks I’d rather get fake rich on Monopoly money
Yeah but you also don't hear about all the times this shit fails. once I was up 300% on a share (only 10k to 30k but still), and I didn't sell it for tax reasons (needed to wait 6 months). 6 months later I was down 65% of my initial investment. I still have this piece of shit stock 3 years later, and it's done nothing, still at half the price I bought it for. 1 day it will moon again, 1 day...
Why so?
Because of one guy, matress king

Get a job
I wouldn’t worry too much about it
1: Get a wealth management advisor, 500k is a lot of money and it might be enough for you to live decently without working. Advisors can tell you about annuities and other forms of passive income.

2: Spend it on high yielding dividend stocks that have a potential for future growth. Something in the energy sector, tech, etc. 500k wont get you alot, maybe 20k-25k per year from dividends if you pick the right ones.

3: Depending on where you live, learn to flip houses, condos, apartments. Do it for a while make a profit.

4: My personal favorite. Yolo it on some crazy play of the month.

So total return is based on current price of the contract less the original purchase price of the contract * number of total shares?

Hell to the no. Gme is def a shorter term play if anything
It'll get rejected and go lower than it did the other day, hopefully 13K. Then it's calls on RIOT and MARA and electric lambo to the m00nie m00n time

News outlets like Benzinga and CNBC should be held liable for giving a man, who has lost all credibility in the market and hides behind the guise of his one-man lemon LLC with a shitty website that a toddler could outdo, a continued voice to inorganically disrupt the market with no fundamental basis. Because without those news outlets publishing his unfounded opinions, I can guarantee you that nobody would give his tweets or "reports" any time of day.

Some states have it where they treat you almost like you’re married if you live together for like 7 years, but not fucking 1 year lol.
means lockdowns dont affect it. can it drop 10 percent after earnings? sure but it wont crash because "bad earnings" were forecasted in the previous earnings for the quarter.
Sober you needs more confidence.  Instinct is pretty decent, roll with it.  Cover them bitches in your Alpra\_Creem!
Anyone playing with SNOW puts of any kind soon. Their lock up period is almost up and the stock is like through the roof right now.
Imo the tech is finally getting ready to be actually useful, the -80% for the last 5 years didn't have a solid product. Rumours suggest they are building next gen printer currently, ready for q1/q2 of 2021 and supposedly working with spaceX and tesla. None of this is confirmed as of now but if it was, thus stock would be 60, not 6.

You think GME chatter recently was bad? You couldn't go half a page without seeing shit about the short squeeze a month ago. I own GME stock but I wouldn't buy in at this point.
I feel like it’s no different than the other meme stocks. It’s just kind of a life cycle in this sub of one ticker being spammed, small gains then huge losses lots of crying and deflation of comments as people lose everything, then new ticker comes along and cycle starts over

Potentially GME when it hits $20 this week

Context plays a big part of it.

An online matress company in a sea of exactly same comps?  Probably pump and dump

EV companies, as more countries ban the sale of new gas vehicles? Possibly has legs

PLTR? No one knows what they really do, but they simultaneously do everything.  Also with white Obama's election everyone knew PLTR would flourish

GME? Time will tell but shutting down cost center stores and transformation to e-commerce, ride the hype.

Not all wsb memes will continue with strong momentum after initial pump, but all pumped stocks were wsb memes at some point.

At best, there will be a dollar or two squeeze. I just don't see momentum happening enough for a short squeeze. There would have to be a catalyst, some insane news. All the big or at least smart players in here are buying shares. That's the best I could recommend and set a limit. Enough people buy shares, maybe by some miracle a squeeze might happen.
Not much if it just long but if it's thick as well, then oh buddy.
Only you know when to pull your chips off the table.
Facebook collects all the data and does the douchey shit with it - they write the algorithms that indoctrinate. PLTR builds systems to organise the data that their clients collect. Not even a contest.

If you wanna go SJW, blame the government, or legislators, or the military - they're the ones enabling or collecting data.

3D printed circuits isn’t their invention or very original. If they can dominate the market they have a good future - but that is probably unlikely. There are tons of 3D printer manufacturers out there and eventually they will democratize the tech and their value will fall. That is unless they can maintain market dominance by printing smaller and smaller structures. 

So for now it’s an entirely speculative play - if they show traction and evolutionary performance in the Z axis and in resolution that outpaces competitors then they have a future - otherwise it’s a dumpster fire.

If you don't know what a short squeeze is then look it up. I wasnt joking about the catalyst
Friday started it. The bounce Monday morning will be from all these retards thinking it will rally again. Then it will fall further to like $20 imo

Even Tesla didn’t rally this hard week after week. It needs a couple months break and then maybe it will go hard again
why set limit orders? how much time generally does a short squeeze last

This is a really bad place to ask financial advice. You should talk to a professional who will set you up with what you need.

That being said, they usually suggest the 4% rule for retirees. You invest your money conservatively, and take out 4% in the first year. Then give yourself a 3% raise each year. Your money should outlast you. Since your 30, you might need to reduce your initial withdraw to 3 or even 2%, so it lasts long enough to carry you through.

I didn’t realize how many people on this sub lack the basic fundamentals & Knowledge of the Stonk Market 😂
makes sense if your putting the immune system into overdrive, could cause collateral damage. know nothing about it though, just speculating
High enough will create margin call to get the ball rolling on it's own snowballing the over burdened short position.  Otherwise the erection is for ANY positive outlook on the eighth report that is coming out.  If that has any rosiness (early suggests that they are going online like CHWY and AMZN to try and take that gamer space)  If that is the case and numbers are not awful that too could create the trigger for the avalanche.  

However you are correct.  If margins do not trigger or exp do not pass then if there is negative outlook with larger than expected financial loss the shorts will win as people slowly begin to roll out of position.  Like anything in the market, anything can happen.  You just play odds and leverage to get to target.
Hence why I’m surprised more haven’t added them to their trading account. I guess they just haven’t had their time yet but at 50B and an almost 100% increase this year, is it too late?
Amzn stuck. Don’t think it moves

I just have a bad feeling about the vaccines being rushed. And we’re giving them first to first responders, the very people who know how to help. If the unknown side effects were say zombinfications, all the doctors, nurses, paramedics, would turn first.  Would make an interesting movie plot but not something we want in real life.
Well, if by whales you mean billionaires, they're not here bud. It's a meme stock. GME might put some effort in saving itself with e-commerce and specialty/exclusive sales but other than that there's a reason it's being shorted harder than anything. If anything, the people with money are holding the short positions. But it's 2020. So fuck it. I'm not touching it.

Umm there are more red flags here than on a Somalian pirate boat.
I'd agree, except that we are a community of a collective which would already move the market as a whole anyway, while Citron is an individual company that watches what we do, very likely buys the gayest of bear puts, then throws out a hit article and makes bank. We're just a bunch of retards that wanna share the muns
[deleted]
It's called a catalyst. Look it up retard
Nio is definitely not a scam but aight lol
It's more like the other way around.  Stocks get hyped on here because of their good performance. They don't do well because they are hyped on here.  Also, people hype for stocks and the hive mind doesn't predict when they will crash.
Yeah the shorts just keep throwing money to hold their positions up and drive price down as people give up on holding calls and stock. Same thing happened a month or 2 ago but it only got up to $15.5 and was on less significant news. I think it could happen soon but if not this will only strengthen the next attempt/earnings news
got a couple of those myself, but lol comment allowed on same thread.

You should leave her ass if PTLR drops to $1 or hit $100. Can’t have gains with that girl weighing you down
Here's some i've noticed just breaking out on Friday, look for Monday for confirmation: Nflx/Amzn/Jks/Lac. One's that are close : Apps, Pacb, Jd, Adbe, Apple (if it ever gets a move on)
Yes, it’s retarded, imagine trying to do accounting there.
Thank you! My bad, I’ve never really understood how to search for posts within a sub on mobile.
Nice try, liar. No one on this sub has a girlfriend. We just have wives. Their boyfriends wouldn't be caught dead here with us.

Roblox will probly be a big one. Seems to have serious meme potential
Honestly, Monster Hunter World is a gay ass game where after a lot of grinding you get nothing in return and you just gotta keep going. Kind of reminds me of real life. I basically paid $30 for a game that says "fuck you" to me everyday just like life does.

> he's ignoring how much more expensive and annoying to store a protein subunit vaccine like NVAX is.

This contradicts every other source that says NVAX vaccine is easier to mass produce and store with pre-existing vaccine protocols. To compare PFE/BNTX vaccine requires freezers at -94F and MRNA at -4F, while NVAX stable in a standard fridge at +35F to +46F.
It’s only a loss if you sell. Never sell never lose 🧠👈
Yolo pltr and turn that to 400%

MRNA is literally the most bananas hype meme stock in the history of animals. How retarded do you have to be to post DD like you just discovered it? It is pushed so fucking hard over the fundamentals that nothing is holding it up but pixie dust and memes.

Sure PhDs like the mRNA tech, but actual pharma business people know that there is no path to profitability for that tech. _Maybe_ they get a big one-time revenue hit assuming Pfizer doesn’t outmaneuver them for government contracts. But that is it.

Pharma companies get rich by patenting cancer drugs or boner pills then selling them to insured boomers for criminally insane prices. They are allowed to do this because they have captured the US regulatory agencies that block price gouging in all other countries. 

This is just basic Shkrelinomics - WSB knows it well. None of it works for MRNA. They can’t sell the same vaccine for 20 years. They can’t price gouge on the vaccine because people are watching. A few billion in revenue for one year is fucking peanuts. A good pharma drug makes billions per year and has no competition for 20 years.

There is nothing here except hype from retail retards. This stock belongs at 70-80 and will be back there soon after the media gets bored of vaccines.

You misspelled PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Dunno rly, has huge potential
PLTR just IPO'd, so it's hard to tell what range it will end up in. However, both realized and implied volatility have been rising since the election, so it could easily go higher. If you look at PLTR options several months to a year out, you'll notice that the implied volatility is lower as you go further out, so the market is betting on lower vol in the future.

I'm on and off Reddit, but the PLTR hype I've come back to in the last week has been intense. They need to grow extremely quickly to match the price they've been given, so I'd be wary of earnings. PLTR only has around 150 clients (but they each spend millions), which means that it's earnings will "bunch" together more than other tech companies. That could mean more volatility to come (but also watch the vol crush if you wait through earnings...). The best thing to do with this environment would probably be to go delta neutral, but that strategy requires full time attention and at least $100k for portfolio margin. 

IDK, my gut tells me you gotta be careful riding the PLTR wave, it's gonna be bumpy.
👍👌

Might have to do with Spotlight competition and Tiktok getting another extension for US sale? 47.27 is hoy with 47.02 being the 2nd pivot resistance.

Most people here are younger than the average hedge or pension fund managers that have access to fat stacks of cash and since they have grown up using the internet and social media, and being the next gen, it makes sense that they can identify stocks that, even though they might be losing money right now, could become profitable due to developing global trends. So while the sub probably doesn't move prices, it identifies stocks well based on mid-long term trends instead of fundamentals. I am an idiot so what I have written is probably wrong anyways.
Seems like a lot

Monday probably.  but who the fuck knows

I saw the spike so i just bought as many as i could in 10 minutes.
What would need to happen for GME not to sqeeze? Is that even a possibility?
I didnt.
goddamn the matrix fucking rules.
I actually made a playlist after I woke up in the morning.
It was right after the news of ARK buying them. I expected a pump from that but there was none so I got out. I didn’t buy high and sell low, I bought high and got out when it dipped a little after not doing anything all day.
You're well diverisified I see
QS was valued at $3.3 billion when it signed its LOI with KCAC to do a reverse merger. This was based on the SPAC trust value of $10 a share. Now that the merger has finished the new ticker $QS is at $38.65, which values the company at $12.75 billion, which is retarded. QS is incredibly overvalued and will go the way of HYLN and NKLA  in due time. Good luck trying to time your puts as Citron is absolutely drafting up a short report.

Sold 2 months before they were bought by microsoft and their stock doubled. Made a bit of profit, but man that hurt.

I think they are doing a lot of research into graphene and batteries, and they have a ton of patents related to communications, so they might be a potential good play, or to put it in WSB-terms, a rocket-ship to tendietown.

Everyone is talking about it like it’s a certainty but there must be a scenario where it flops
Market is forward looking.  the fact that it's as good as it is right now bodes well for its recovery. by the time it is actually as good as it was, sports betting will have taken off and the stock price will be up and the tendies are gone.

Also you forgot the part where school costs like 6 figures lmao, which is actually the much larger issue. School isn’t free where I am but we aren’t free market cucks so one of your beloved science degrees doesn’t cost more than 12k. I went to school with Americans who came up because our schools are still cheaper with international fees (aka not subsidized by the government). I for one am happy that basically all universities where I am are somewhat publically funded. University was a great time, and I’m already done with my student loans lol. Which not only were backed by the government, they came from the government. So your argument kind of falls apart, you’re using the absolutely retarded quasi capitalist current America as a starting point and not even realizing the multitude of the ways you’re getting fucked hahaha. It’s not the women’s studies majors that make it cost 100k to get a degree dumbass, it’s that everything in your country is run for a profit and for some reason you just can’t get enough. Lol real cuck hours 

Also, lol do you go outside ever? Graphic design isn’t on par with ventriloquism. Also, also lol at calling me a child. Writing a short essay for this grade school, rehashed analysis tells me you are closer to high school than 30. Hahahahahah go deepthroat Adam smith or something

Yeah i feel ya. A relative in my family caught it in NYC and since there’s practically no way to socially distance from your own family all of them got it . They tried doing things like Saran wrapping a room and all that since a lot of people in their house are old and have preexisting conditions. But ultimately really useless. Thankfully they all recovered without an issue. So maybe that’s something you can be hopeful for at the very least.
Thank you, I was aware of all that. The person I replied to made it sound like they weren't gonna touch GME as Ryan Cohen is involved and they "can't say more". I know it was bs lol
Do $1k then see how you feel. I would advise against giving out $10k just because you are up $50k. If $50k is life-changing money for you, then maybe think twice. If you were up $1m, then sure, give out $10k.
What country?

Dude you need to get the fuck out now. Man up and stand up for yourself and your pride my dude. Who the fuck cares about Palantir
Its clear you have no understanding of options so Im not going to continue this argument

ok here's the best advice that I could ever give on women.

"idgaf."

that's how you approach that situation. made her a playlist. she doesn't reply. who knows why? idgaf.

you'll be happier spending less time trying to figure it out.

so just let them do what the fuck ever and just be chill in the process.
Umm there is no chance its going that far ur way high bro !
Autist confirmed.

 if you divorce she's gonna get half that money, better get it into a hw wallet asap if you know what i mean.
Canoo van ugly or nah? Looks similar to a VW bus and people seem to love those so idk.
Just look at PLTR's CEO. Massive fucking douche. Idc tho if I make money lol
sounds like you need a vacation or a hobby
Congrats man, that’s a big accomplishment. Health is wealth
Interesting option activity on SNAP for this week. Lot's of volume on the 12/4 51 and 12/4 48 calls. Some news brewing?
Of all the things to be nostalgic about, those are the things you miss?

Heard this many times with TSLA
😂

some real shit, if you want to keep making more money do not listen to what WSB tells you even if it might be convincing, go do your own research and be smart about it

most of these fucks don't know what delta, gamma or vega is and i'm sure many don't even know what theta is
Wrong company retards
That video has got to be dated.  I'm telling you there are people here and the place is packed.  I'm currently in the nugget (that's where I'm stayin because best rates😎) but we went to the strip earlier and it was crowded (not like it was a year ago but for the new normal there were a shit ton of people). 

But you do you man. The main focus of my gamble is the sports betting aspect
I wish I can stop being a slave to my human desires. Stop being a slave to my addictions of lust, drugs, money, just stop being addicted to all that and be in nature or some shit i dont know. 

Those of you who cope with with whatever, weed, alcohol, gambling, nicotine, porn, random hookups, speed, cocaine, clubbing, whatever etc, don’t you feel after a certain point, it’s just tiring. 

I fee like humans weren’t meant to just be in boxes all day. It gets exhausting sometimes
arent they all shilling pltr like this sub tho lmao
[removed]
Well you could still sell those once it goes up in April-July you should still make a decent profit
That’s what she said
Did you see Friday's big dick volume on a half day
I had a 02/19/21 10c from October and rode it to 17

Then I got a 12/18 19c and sold at 20 bucks after it had been pounded by short sellers all week. I also saw it was moving with SPY and once SPY dropped 2 points in about 2 minutes I got out. Don't hate yourself
I closed the short of my PFE $37 5/21 calendar spread late October when the stock was down, and sold the long leg the next week at open on news of the vaccine. I anticipated the move when they announced they were nearing completion anywhere from early to mid November, but it felt great to actually catch the timing.
[deleted]
I have 30c January 2022 leaps but honestly, I'm kinda regretting it. Think GME has more short term potential (April - July max).

The worst are the comments. Buncha sheep bro I literally don’t know shit about stocks and I’m up 2k for the month because of WSB knowledge lmfao
That’s just the kind of math i expect from this sub, keep it up brother
no but you do you
Rn pltr is basically having a black Friday sale since citron called it a casino, should be back up this next week, apple is just vibing but if you buy options now, in a few months they'll be worth something, and Activision should be going up since CoD cold war is now their highest grossing game of all time
Are you retarded? The IV has been 200% for the past 2 months.

thats probably going to double day before earnings.
got webull so i can have 6 day trades a week between that and robinhood. only have like 10 dollars in my american bank account though so i’m gonna buy a few shares of HEXO and ride the wave into earnings, sell and buy whatever calls i can afford. it’ll be cool if i can turn 10 dollars into like 100.
Tried this , All meats sweats didn’t help at all with Tesla but now I’m fully invested in weekly BYND puts.

leverage is fun
I had another 1k at the time that I put on Nokia instead, and only ended up making 200 bucks from selling it. I wish I put that 1k in NIO as well. However, when I bought it NIO was so close to bankruptcy
Bro I did just that a few hours ago. Need to see my PnL graph move over the weekend. Made a couple hundred already. Without options it doesn’t swing wildly enough so I yoloed all my remaining buying powers (juiced to the tits on tsla and tlry calls).
What does It mean if the market is long

don't even bother with season 2 (but you will). Season 3 is pretty good imo.
it might not die on bad earnings b/c it's not an earnings play

GME BEARS_R_FCK
Do you guys think leaps on GME for at least 2022 and strike price above 40 will print?
DMT
that's a killer return, fuck i wish

i know my dumb ass would've sold that by now
This won't be a pltr gain.  anybody who says they saw that coming is lying or lucky.  I'm just speaking from on the ground experience and investing in what i see
Make no mistake, we are not investing.
I’m gonna cum when I see TSLA and TLRY gap up on Monday
Season one is amazing. Don’t watch the rest, seriously..
thx. ya afaik they're ok so far. it's that Tokyo is dense as fuck. exposure would be so easy. like I'm actually living in an area that's getting hit even harder but I'm not as worried because here it's easier to socially distance.

but Tokyo. fuck. you just *can't* socially distance there, y'know?

so like my situation is easier to control. so I'm more worried about their situation.
Yes it’s gonna go new ATH and higher

You’re forgetting about project overdrive or something I forgot the name of their proprietary software. They just got a contract with the government to use pltrs software to distribute and track Covid vaccines. Just announced and laughing but very serious if you google it palantir to the moon 🚀. Such a huge partnership
Not going to happen till the dems control the senate.

yeah i tried finding stock/options content on tik tok and it was all fucking dogshit, never again
I only put in 1K, but it's about 13K right now

Edit: haven't sold yet
Hot tip, drop that virgin galactic shit before their aircraft blows up again.

Shit is unsafe, terrible design. It will kill people mark my words.
That’s $5600

Where’s the other $144,000?
I tend to give this an serious look at. My Moderna shares jumped by 14 percent on Friday. Overall performance is like 32 percent plus since I bought for the very same reason op stated and I am not in the field.

Doesnt take a genius to recognize that distribution is a key factor on selling the vaccine if the other properties are more or less equal.
What you think about catelent op?
Casino stocks are held by institutions and other MM, they are not held by 98% private like $PLTR. A lock down or another travel restriction will tank it. You can diamond hands of you buy LEAPS but if you wait a month then you can get it on a big ass discount.
Hmm I was eyeing to sell 12/18s but now you got me looking at April’s 🤔
Yeah...sooooooo busy.

https://youtu.be/tg3lEj8YHQM
what part of 'wait till it dies after earnings' did you not read?

people here think earnings on 12/04 is the time that this stock is going to trigger a short squeeze where 140% of the shorts are going to cover or something 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Same. I've been bagholding 600 shares on margin that I accumulated couple months ago in the $100-$122 range. Only reason I didn't add more when it dipped below $90 was I used the remaining margin for PLTR, NIO, and GME, all of which have earned me some $20k this month.

Vaccine stocks will be the sector play in December. PFE/BNTX and MRNA will see some gains, but NVAX is currently the most undervalued at the moment given they have the best long-term vaccine. I expect a lot of funds are waiting for next round of interim data in mid-Dec, by then the FOMO will already be in full swing to $200+.

Thanks for the research! Sage this thread 🤡
Season 1 is outstanding. The later ones not so much.
The first season is definitely the best first season of a show I’ve ever seen. HBO max gives a free one week trial so no reason not to watch it, it’s like an 8 hour movie
Between the police surveillance and powering ICE immigration raids resulting in children being torn away from the families, PLTR is scum of the tech world. If you thought Facebook was bad, this is exponentially worse.

I don’t quite understand the wsb full tard way yet..what’s the legit advice
Delete this.
how much did you buy when it was so low?

over the summer i sold a $12.50 put to open but i ended up buying it back for over a $100 loss when it drilled and i hate myself 🤡🤡🤡
I’m jacked to the tits on TSLA and TLRY. Gonna ride weed news for a few days then load up on GME
Jesus Christ Stock traders on TIK TOK  are soooooooooo fucking corny and all Frauds , everyone in the comments be agreeing with them too, smfh hate to see it. Thank god for y’all retards here. We may be autistic but we not as autistic as these “gurus”  imagine listening to their advice and not listening to Wall Street bets ... HAAA
Zero. I just had that dream and I'm not leveraged
1st law of thermodynamics. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy changes from one form to another. Therefore, death is the rebirth into the afterlife. 

Brought me so much comfort, just think of it in terms of energy. I don’t fear death.
Keep drinking. I’ve called it the Don Draper method. In fact I’m doing it right now. Can’t get hungover if you’re drunk
I’ll try to pay more attention and maybe it’ll click better then. On a side note, hope your family in Japan’s doing well and hasn’t been affected by Covid.
sir, yes!  I too jack on the tits
market is forward looking though.

GME is not an earnings play
I've just recently started reading posts from Wallstreetbets. Luckily I've had enough experience in casinos to have identified these internal mental patterns before starting in the market.

The best advice I can give to anyone reading this thread is that you at the end of the day will both reap the rewards and suffer the consequences of your bets. It is important that YOU place your vested interest where you believe there is money to be made.

**Remember that majority of the people in this thread are just as clueless as you.**
yes I’m here for free tendies?

Can’t sleep right now because of some series I watched called True Detective, finished the 1st season in 2 days 😐10/10 show though

Some real fucked shit happens in the show towards the end and that show has been on my mind for hours and I still can’t sleep it’s 2:30am.😐

Anyone who’s watched that show knows what I’m talking about, like holy fuck that shit really does happen and it’s just impossible to get rid of all those people. Fuck 

I need the market to open so I can stop thinking all the time😐

i've never smoked a cigarette ever (SO much weed though) but i started vaping in college and i cant go without it anymore. i did quit once for 10 months but just felt like doing it again

one day i'lll quit but not today and not tomorrow and definitely not the next day 🤡
I Shouldve bought more weed calls on friday before close.
The reason to get GME involves chatter.  They are currently shit long term, if that changes the over 100% short will squeeze.  the more that get in on it the more likely it is that it would squeeze.
An Intel company suing the fucking army so they have to buy their software. What a dystopia we live in.

How tf is pltr unethical?
Sorry for your loss, I know addictions can be really rough, but your Intel play especially really shows the weaknesses of investing based off of market information rather than the good old buffet "pick a company who's product you understand"
I mean, I blasted every penny I earnt aged 16 to 25 on drugs and booze. At least if it had been options I would have had the slender chance of success.
Got in on NIO at $3, held strong till now.
Now, I got PLTR at 20, I can see it go up to 500 (eventually...)
[removed]
This.
It would be cool if this market could fucking crash already. Like let my puts print and let me buy the dip. But everytime I buy the dip, it just keeps drilling, and everytime I buy puts, we get the greatest rallies ever. 🤔🤔🤔
depends on context but if shit is bolded I noticed something.
Ain't no fun if the homies can't have none.
This is the way
Honestly u don’t need options on that shit the volatility is enough
i know we only talk about PLTR now but weekend dow 81% long wow
This looks like shit and I don't even know where would you use it? Is this meant to be the logo for wsb? Because then I'd like to short your idea. Looks like a pile of outdated trash that's reusing different unrelated designs.

Your parents were right to disown you
Kcac/qs?
We all wanna get rich, but I will never buy that usurious ass company
BitterCoin seems to be making a comeback?
Well you already addressed the biggest problem that goes against a 100-1000000 squeze, namely that retail will sell of their shares once they see like a 100% increase to  30 or 40. It would require an incredible amount of cooperation from all retail to not panick sell once they see a wiff of a gain. Pls tell me if im talking shit, but as I see it the problem is that the stocks are owned by too many different institutions and retail to make an infinity squeze possible. However earrnings is going to print no matter what and a small squeze will also certainly happen just not the one many make it out to be. Still I hope I am proven wrong and this baby goes to 1000 I got some shares and would love to get my first 10 bagger
[removed]
If this isn’t fake, then this is the weakest shit I’ve ever read online.
Yeah. Thanksgiving was super busy. /s
Yeah I know. And probably best that people don’t try to get in positions that reverse quickly during the day and before you can even warn them of what’s coming. Another stupid question when delta or gamma are highlighted, should that mean something important all on their own?
RIOT
bro its gotten so bad  some of the questions people here are asking make my brain go in circles.
i assume it works like tastyworks but RH is kinda garbage idk, i like tasty way more

you can close your positions but not open new ones

if it's the day of the PDT and you haven't been punished yet you can still keep day trading a bunch but it's sunday so you already got fucked but that's just a fun fact
Simps buy PLTR calls, knowing it’s an unethical company. Then, they cry about Citron being unethical with their hit piece.

That is what we call karma.
i hope you buy house after cashing out, Q4 should be juicy with the new consoles
Convince me and I’ll do it
Respect for posting. Theres a very thin sometimes invisible line between investing and gambling

Whats a good buy in for dpw? I love the company
Cant stand the volatility of it lol
Bruh Palantir literally can’t collapse... if Palantir collapses the govt and all the systems will collapse. It’s that simple.
I think long run it's a great play, and yeah they seem to be killing it on the weekends. But remember most of the strip is closed Monday through Thursday and there is 0 convention traffic.
there are options on it out there but the volume is probably micropenis i assume

never looked too hard into it myself
No seriously. I live in Vegas, I know dealers, I know people effected by the shutdown. Wait. Wait for that dip. Its coming for the casinos. They're talking about shutdown part 2 electric boogaloo and its gonna make em drop good.

Half of my father-in-laws coworkers have covid and they're restricting how many people can be in a building (leading up to second lock down in nevada).

Wait for that hard hard dip and then buy calls to the moon
Yes 🚀
Of all the gold in this thread, this is the comment where I lost my shit
[removed]
It's hilarious because it seems like none of you have ever actually walked into a gamestop. This is the next blockbuster. I won't even say like it or not, because the market is the one who will prove it.

I think there are way better companies to invest in than GME.
Yeah bro you should probably leave her regardless. But I digress. PLTR to the moon. I'm depositing my meager earnings (<1k) and buying shares to help moon this shit for you brother! Godspeed, and god damn leave that bitch.
Well done King!

Oh yeah I have some 19c I’m gonna wait for the run up sell it off and then buy back in when it evens out
Who the fuck would buy car insurance from a cartoon general
On a normal day. Not in the weekends.
You haven’t met the right cat
I did +50% this week only with stocks lol
wait till it dies after earnings and you can get calls for cheap with IV dead and all the retards here crying that they lost their money
weekends are so gay i might start trading fucking shitcoin
Why is no-one jumping on this
If I got the 90 day buy restriction, am I still able to buy back the covered calls I sold? On RH
Are you a multi- millionaire now?
ya it's ok. I get that they're hard to use. otherwise more ppl would do it, y'know? bold is that I'm trying to draw your attention away from the other numbers.
We do not allow these questions here, punk.
for real, it's painful sometimes

from the point where i was seriously interested in options to my first trade i spent two months learning everything i could find about how everything works and i was still nervous AF to try it
Not at open, wait for an hour or so to see momentum.

Small cost to wait versus the real losses if you're early.
If they come here and win because TSLA/ PLTR/ MEME go brrrrrrr and it does, then they are doing it right, without really knowing what they are doing.  But like the blind kid playing football memes, eventually it catches up with them and they get blind sided.

i started smoking a pack a day as soon as i turned 18. switched to vaping full time around 25. I'm 30 now and I've been nicotine free for about 3+ months now and it's wild the difference it has on you. My resting heart rate was like a full 10-15 higher that entire period of time and my anxiety finally started to get a bit better. 

i still smoke weed every other night just about but i mean it's quarantine time everyone needs one kind of vice. 

i thought i was cutting back switching to vaping but in all honesty it just supercharged my habit. high nicotine content, being able to puff it any time i want without having to go outside. quit vaping if you can guys, your body will thank you.

She got in that much student debt and then she didn't even have the nerve to finish it? Nursing isn't that hard (to study, not the job).

Thanks, I really believe in the company. Wish I could’ve gotten to TSLA in March, but this is the next best thing.

good job squeaking your pawn through into royalty.
I thought I was solid in my marriage then she left me in January after 15 months. Now all I have is STONKS and hoping I die on the moon someday

Oh shii my bad.😂
I got AAPL 115C 1/21.
I can't fucking sleep tonight. Had this issue twice now this past week and never had it before. Wtf.
With ACB my intention was either selling on Monday or closer towards Friday. The way this shit drops is scary but maybe this time its different.
This was the funniest part. long ass post about how he's out of the market, and then at the end "oh yeah, but I'm still buying stocks." 

And just FYI, if you really want to buy SPY to hold long term, get VOO instead. Essentially the same thing, but the fee is smaller.

That was nice of you to share your story. Others might learn. 

But that was some of the most moronic things I have seen in a while. You clearly don't have a handle of yourself and your emotions. And you shouldn't be playing with life savings like that. 

I am sorry, but when I read that you have poor parents but chose to sht on the whole cash by throwing it into something you don't fully understand makes me not like your face. A disgrace for your parents. Learn some responsibility and learn to control your emotions. The only person at fault is you. I hope you get that.
I have not related to any comment on this sub more than this.

I had a head injury and my brain mri shows hyperactivity in the medial orbitalfrontal cortex which has to do with my insomnia and some of the worsening symptoms, it fucking sucks. My anxiety and depression and insomnia have also gotten worse since the head injury, some of which I’m sure is my fault.

Theoretically I know I should improve with time, according to both my psychiatrist and neurologist, I’m just all fucked up.

At least insurance paid me the 100k uim.
Why does this mean they will moon?
Jim Cramer banned you...

I honestly hate most cats. Most of them don’t give a fuck about people and owners still glorify them. At least dogs will have your back if shit goes down.
We have broken 1 year resistance and stayed above that level... There is no significant resistance left... 1st target $20 then $40...

Objective trash.
Taking the time to learn option trading instead of yoloing is the way to go.
wow did he shit the bed.
doesnt sound like you have a lot to lose my man, so pls be careful

for context, i have 38k deposited to my account, ~7k emergency fund in my bank

my 38k was split around 50-50 with shares and options, which is a risky play for the majority, even people on here

now my portfolio is just ~70k but i had readjusted and bought almost everything at the bottom, and i have no meme stocks whatsoever, my options are going well and give me the majority of my gains (around 24k atm)

You forgot SHOP
The $1,000 - $20,000 was crazy,  and everyone wishes they got in on it. Now all the bagholders are trying to get newbies to buy it to increase the value of their bags based on the FOMO.

Every time it goes back to 19-20k a bunch of people who didn't get out in 2018 will sell.

It's not going to $100k, you have a better chance in this casino than that one.

Bro bro I used to be the same 10 different drugs everyday. Get rid of the Xanax Asap ! Switch to low dose Valium and taper off that shit will kill u.

So volatility and velocity should decrease? And maybe if I’m lucky not a selloff?
ask is what people are asking for price wise, bid is the current best offer people are making(to buy). Trading platforms will estimate a good bid for you to place in order for your trade to get filled first but it isn’t guaranteed, same with selling.

Idk what i mean. I’m new to this lol.
Well done asshole. Excellent stock selection. What did you buy on the dip?
Probably true. I’m following doctor’s advice but for the whiskey which is my dumbass way of potentiating the effects.

Maybe we change things up, I’ve just been through other anti depressants and I fucking hate the side effects. Trazodone does help me knock out without bad side effects except fucking my sex drive.
I bought in at 32 I feel your pain
They’re zombies now
yep, i actually bought 400 shares at open on Friday not knowing about earnings and before WSB was boners over it this weekend, but i was originally planning on just selling weekly covered calls for a bit

I'm gonna try and find a good exit point this week, hopefully the retard strength is there and hopefully there is some mooning

That's what I'm saying, there's no way. Earnings is going to be shit with as little stores as they have left open. If there's momentum and velocity and an actual squeeze happens...the dumbest part of my brain will think it's because of the meme status.
It's a fascinating social study in real time.
I'm sure soon some papers from universities will be written about his place.

You can hedge your shares with some good option contracts.
Options trading could be used as a tool to make your stock portfolio even safer.
People saying it's riskier are just ignorant.
If you know what you are doing, you can make sure to make money whatever the stocks are going up or down.

Thanks, I'm not really a trader yet per se, but I've studied it and the psychology of charts quite a bit.

Why should the future be any different?

Been holding this since August and kept buying the dip down to $85. Holding this at -30% was rough, but it's proven worth it, as I was confident in prospects. Good to see someone who did more DD than I did also feeling as bullish.

Intrinsic profit of your contract, yes that number is correct
please update us what'll happen
BUT THE KEY HERE: if you buy shares, you need to hold them once the squeeze starts because THAT drives the price up.

If you sell once the squeeze starts, you let the short sellers off easy and we get NO MOON
Am retarded but where do you see that
Oh ok. Another thing is there any part of the reads that is critical and should be obvious? Asking because I may or may not be bagholding CRSR by attempting ,incorrectly at that, to interpret your read earlier 😅.

What? Are you saying that PLTR call holders or stock holders do not care about the money? And that they gladly lose 50% of their positions? Because, I mean, that's what the joker does in the scene.

This post makes absolutely no sense you fucking dingus, and the only reason it's upvoted is because it relates to PLTR. Fucking retards.
it means you can get your dick wet for cheap, too bad black friday was two days ago
Wait... you can take money out of your account?

I'm dumping the rest of the cash in my portfolio into this stock come Monday morning.  Institutional investors have been buying this up all of last week. They too obviously know something's up.  The price is going to go up and retail investors out of the loop will inevitably FOMO in, driving the price up even more.  Then their quarterly earnings call will come, and GameStop will obviously post higher revenue than that of their past quarters because of the scalpers scooping up their entire stocks of new consoles, and the continuing strong sales of the Switch.

AND we have the short squeeze to look forward to, if everything I predicted turns out right.  Thanks, man.
Ok. So about half the size of the pandemic stimulus.

Got it.

capital gains is 30%  that is what you need to give uncle sam.
This could be done with just stonks and patience with a stroke of luck
To which direction though
I’m from Germany and the customer service here is excellent, if you have a problem they are super friendly and take back things without complaining. Never had any issue with them, whether things arrive one or two-day isn’t that important to me but free delivery and the security that it has a reliable customer service without the small/medium-sized business screwing me over if I have a problem is worth the 35€ per year (student). That’s why I don’t even buy from those small businesses online but instead order from Amazon directly.
.maybe you should just leave regardless

Dude. I was investing in GME years ago before the last cycle when it got hit because everyone thought it was the next Blockbuster Video. It did well then and it has already done well over the last several months.

I understand it. I don't understand what the f 'COVID resiliency' is. Sounds like some heavy rationalization a la CNBC Cramer.

Clearly you're not open to other perspectives and got blinders on. Good luck.
Please learn what options are before you do some retarded shit
[removed]
Hey thanks for all the info. I’ve been meaning to get off of RH for a while and this just confirms I should. I can see why you’d use both. I just googled “best brokerages” and TD Ameritrade is supposedly the best overall whereas ETrade is best for options - both are 0.65 per contract. Tradestation is only 0.50 per contract.

The math seems pretty straightforward - if RH makes you pay 0.10 for an option that is 0.08 then you’re effectively paying $2 per contract. Even worse when you sell to close, as you have to sell for $0.05 and lose $3 a contract, or 38%!

Paying 0.65 seems like a no-brainer, if it gets filled.

Also USD is super low. Don't start investing now unless you already own USD. It will kill easily 10-20% in gains if USD turns around eventually
Yeah this seems like it could be a big sleeper.
The 25k minimum requirement for day trading is also the main reason of my huge losses, SEC says this rule is to “protect” investors, I don’t really see how it does so, I could have limited my loss to few k only without this rule

WSB reason: short squeeze make stock go moon

reality: gamestop has had a ridiculous amount of short interest for a very long time and WSB tried this last month and forgot about it i guess, maybe all those people got wiped or something

but GME has had high short interest for many months. it needs a powerful catalyst to actually short squeeze and i don't think it's going to
Yeah I know you’re really active here.

my fear with these SPACS is it gets pumped, it merges, get diluted instantly, then tanks.  assuming it went from $10 to $15 and the SPACS share of the merged company is only worth $10, then you are instantly 50% overvalued, plus how much the SPAC founders 20% extra shares or whatever are worth.  So unless everything is perfect perfect, u can get F’d.  But what do i know...
yea honestly better shares because no one knows when its going to happen. Though calls would still make a profit as gme has been steadily rising
When did you read that ? I did it like 4 months ago and it worked
Now this is the retard we all inspire to be..
Good stuff
you never wondered if some dude has cum in his balls and paid him to prove it?

I will bet you it does not go up 6x in a month.

Also there are better returns every single day in options.

I'm with you for $1000 Monday. We moon or burn together.
Even that’s risky though, a ton of companies go down for x point and then don’t get back there for years. AMD for example went from like 5 dollars a share in 2004ish to 40 dollars a share in 2006ish, then dropped all the way down to 2 something and never got back to 40+ until 2019. Any and all options bought around 40 back in 2006 would have been worthless.
Atleast you guys knew it was citron tweet! I didn’t even know why my dec 31 40c went from 200% to breakeven when I checked between open and close lol

With options you have to guess the direction and time. With shares you only guess the direction. It’s already hard enough
Yes of course, just as a customer it's a step down from previous levels. Yet I still order there as it beats having to visit 5 different shops across town to get those 5 things I need.

Brick & mortar stores had 10-15 years to adapt a new strategy, so I feel no mercy with them.

That said - it seems to be coming back on everyone's radar, after about a 3 year downturn and trading sideways for much of that time.  


I think it'll really start to pay off somewhere in 2023-2027.  If you can hold long and get in at a good price (discounts may certainly be available again in the coming months/years), I recommend it.

“I will never financially recover from this” this weekend

I’ve used other brokers, and I just don’t like the interfaces. Robinhood also has instant deposit cash so I can make bad decisions quicker.
Why
have an inventory of over 700 pairs of shoes
This is the same formula for all new stocks, it will dive off a cliff, sit low for about a year+ then recover over the next year.  Don’t feel bad this is the way it’s always been. Don’t get trapped I’ve been trapped and it sucks either waiting years for positive price action or cut the noose and take a lose
I have a really wonderful story about Tony Hsieh. I emailed one time out of the blue at a email address I found on google. He actually called me 10 min later and invited me to come hang at his trailer park (I was in Vegas for CES).. the next night we were hanging out with Lamas at Container Park. I was floored he was so down to earth and while I sure he would have never remembered me I will always remember the kindness he show my wife and I.
this guys the truth. do what he says. will buy another call on monday to hedge my gme yolo lol
I mean soccer is a word from England, and if you don't like it, change your language because you made it up so own it

Also the shitty played out boomer joke is about gridiron football is calling it "handegg", not egghand.
You don’t have to pay her debt. Save the money for the next chick. Oh also, chances are you’re going broke because way too many lemmings have been chanting this weekend and mr. market likes to push them off the cliff Sparta style.
Yo why do you delete your posts? I swear it seems like you make a comment and they just disappear a few minutes later.
Give me 1 reason why We don’t just take all of our money out of stocks and options and buy as much of shitcoin as we can?

People keep saying it will go 100k+ this year
You can easily plug in your position vs shares vs ITM LEAPS and then put in your price target and get the results.

If you do that you would not being doing the OTM call spreads.

But that will take 15 minutes to enter it into excel and enter the formulas...so most people won't do it.
Hopefully it goes well
Same here. Bought January calls worth $32k. Already down $15k by close. I need that shit to go back the fuck up.
Holly shit nice man. How much did you pay for those 2023s? You profited from the underlying moving up and prob the IV went up as well.
Shares are borrowed by short sellers, as the price of the shares rise, short sellers continue to lose money. For various reasons, mainly to stop losing money, short sellers may reduce or close their positions especially if they think the stock will continue to rise. So they need to give back the shares they borrowed by buying up shares. So when you have shorts 'covering' by buying and other people buying, it can basically start to force all the short sellers to buy and then the stock price could go past the moon outside our solar system, and maybe to a galaxy far far away. Hopefully I didn't fuck the explanation up. But that's the jist of it
I’ve read like 5 posts here. That’s enough research for me
No answers I was looking for truly. Insightful for sure. I just continue refusing to believe god is confined to our understanding. Like you said, having a personal relationship is ideal.

You should absolutely bang one of her family members and then tell her about it. Preferably her mother or sister.

I’m sitting on a handful of calls. Robinhood executed a sell on one of my calls Friday for $400 less than what it was worth. 
Hoping we hit high 600’s or more this coming week
Actually a legit observation. You think at least half the Autists are involved in other, perhaps more legit "investment" sites?
but how many did you get?

Yo guys, somehow my brokker just shows that the PLTR options is dead: like, they are not even traded frequently. Just a High open interest. Some strikes is dead (30c) , while others are more alive (32c)
Interesting

I just watched two videos since I posted that, I'm starting to understand

So if I buy a call contract of Cinemark at a strike price of $20, with an ask price of $0.45, and an expiration of 12/18/2020, it will cost me $45.

So then say Cinemark's price goes up to $25 on 12/18/2020. Can I buy and then instantly sell $100 shares of Cinemark? Or if I don't have the cash on hand to actually pay for 100 shares at $20 a share, is my only choice to just sell the option contract itself?

That's my main question now.

I think part of why I devote so much time to trading is because it fills all the empty time I have, and because it gives an element of realism to my pipe dream of making enough money to actually be able to pursue what I want to do in my life. Outside of WSB I have a dwindling social circle, I’ve been severely depressed for years, have anxiety, haven’t had a girlfriend in so long that I feel like I don’t know how to anymore (took a long time to get over “the one that got away”). I’m at the point where either I become rich trading and have a shot at fixing my life or resign my existence.

Gay porn stars are into escorting & so are a lot of “Instagram” gays. Sugar babying is huge in the gay community. If you are young and attractive there are multiple men who will spot you cash when you need it. I myself have a couple of older established dudes who take care of me when I need it. I’m not dependent on their income but yes a $350 venmo is certainly nice when you don’t expect it. And it’s definitely not transactional. I’m nowhere near the level of some boys lately. If you look up Aaron Schock, the gay ex republican who just came out. He is rumored to be a high class rent boy, he hangs out with a bunch of pretty rent boys who are flown all over the world & get 10k for a weekend.
Which calls? I'm holding a decent amount of stock because the auto-warrants.

Well if you asked that question to someone who is very by the book Christian, they would answer that the devil is pushing you towards making bad decisions that god may not like. 

My entire belief is based off what god has given me. I believe that the things we do as people is all apart of the righteous path to success, prosperity, and happiness. It all leads us down the route god wants us to go. 

I don’t believe In going to church, I don’t believe In following the Bible word for word. As long as you are a good person, do good things, and treat people with decency, you are destined towards something, it’s almost like karma. The closest relationship you can have with god is within yourself, what you think is the right thing to do is ultimately what god wants you to do. 
We are given these intense and powerful emotions for a reason. 

I hope that somewhat answers what you’re wondering.

That 1st episode was horrendous😢. It had a dead guy falling from a top story, which is a cliche of wall Street (trying to depress losing traders.) Plus it had mention of Huntington's disease, another depressing subject to try to depress traders that aren't performing well. So basically, episode 1 convinces traders to short stock markets of countries with rioting and then get a disease or die from a top story height after you lose from shorting. LoL. Cliche and wack garbage.

First time?
Literally all my (former) friends indulged too deep into drugs or alcohol and now question themselves why they got shitty jobs as gas station clerks, operating heavy machinery at night shifts or just plainly rotate from the mental asylum into joblessness and back again.

Meanwhile I just drank when I was out with them, smoked some pot while caring to never get caught and filed with the police for some stupid reasons and did the literal bare minimum to graduate some Euro mid-tier school. Then they got mad at me over time as I got a comfy office job that pays good cash while I'm able to slack off most of the time.

It's like a literal computer game, they all played that shit too, why don't they seem able to connect the dots? Somehow I'm glad that I didn't meet them for ages now... Instead I travel the world on my own and just not give a fuck.

So happy to hear your grandma is doing well today’s and that you are convinced of Gods existence. I believe god can see the good in people. 

I just want to know more. I feel like the abrahimic god is too humanized for an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. I don’t doubt some of the things written are experiences so out of this world they just tried their best to describe them with words. I wonder with it showing us in the Bible times where good men chose to disobey/do their own bidding, and god didn’t stop them because we have free will; I wonder if man added/edited gods original message and it’s something that also has been permitted because of our free will


Idk I could be totally wrong but the god I’ve encountered, is all love. Pure peace, tranquillity and security he brings. I don’t really think he would care about things like eating pork/being gay. Again, idk

How/where did you get that figure of 156M shares? I'm trying to learn.
Please elaborate I’m straight up retarded
That's the most retàrded thing I've read all night
I think that eventually we will have an AI revolution leading to a tech singularity and that there’s super intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and that possibly life as we know it is simulated (and the tech singularity has already happened). But shit man. Who knows.
lol stochastic and rsi indicators....such fancy words for a fancy smancy smarty pants like you. if you were really smart you would be in the sciences but instead you're just another degenerate gambler
Seek therapy. A professional will understand what you're going through and provide guidance.
its still a profit if you got in before july 2019
I am in, I am pretty sure all PLTR call holders may have the same exact description
Nope, seems exactly the same as before. All the "experts" were saying it would hit some ridiculous number (like a million or something) by 2020.
Okay. 

My entire life I never had religion pushed on me. I was extremely atheist, rude, spiteful, and empathetic. 
My grandma got breast cancer and I was extremely worried about her health, she meant everything to me, practically my second mother because my parents were always out working. She dropped everything in Ukraine to come help and raise me. 

After that, I don’t know what it was, but I slowly came to terms with god and accepted him into my life. I began praying and following my own perception of what I deemed the christian religion to be. My belief is so strong because it didn’t get pushed on me, it came to me. 

Anyway, I began praying for the health of my family and grandma and now my grandma is one of the healthiest old people I’ve ever seen. If you saw her, you would have no idea she’s in her 80s. 

There are also numerous times after I began wearing a gold cross that I’ve seen god in my life. He helped me get through hardships I would not be able to on my own. 
For example, I almost died riding quads, there was some force that caused be to jump twice instead of once when the quad was coming for me rolling down the hill. If I didn’t jump a second time, I would’ve gotten crushed by it.

That is why I believe there is an afterlife. These hardships we go through are helped by god to remind us there is someone watching and there is someone waiting.

Truer words never been said man.
This sounds trite but do you get outdoors a lot? I mean like, into nature. You don’t need a ton of traditionally “successful” things to feel like life is worth living. Go for a wilderness hike/camp. The kind of beauty and the awe you will experience is all you truly need in life imo - and so far from mediocre
i went there from chicago though and i lived in a pretty bad area. my next door neighbor got robbed at gunpoint on their own front porch once lmao

but i noticed right away that berlin was unbelievably cleaner and safer, especially at nice

ya if you go to the areas where people are partying, events or the night clubs then it might be a little messy, but if you think berlin is a shithole stay the fuck away from chicago
I am using Tasty for 1 year now, and it is just the best.  Customer service is just perfect - fast and knowledgeable.

I am using currencyfair to send money, since this is the only weakness IMO - the whole money transfer from Europe. But if you have big amounts 1000 + I think it is good to use - since you have like a 20 Dollar fee. Write me if you need detail info and if you will also use currencyfair ask me for promo link. We will make both some extra money for it.

I am certain tastyworks is the best options trader platform.
It’s kind of unfair anyway. Ideally you never have to support her because she makes good $$, but having to support her while together and after as an extra penalty is just retarded.

You can shield against this filtering out women who don’t work, which I do anyway.
I hit six figures last week, let's get it
Thanks. 

Although 3 years later there are times I wished that was the end. Gotta keep on keeping on though. I’m off drugs and have a future now so it’s not all bad
I peaked rank 201 in season 8! But I'm sure other people will take you up on that

yup slightly over 40%. No choice mate, must account for the volatility of Tesla. With such a high volatility, if your stop loss is too low, will get whipsawed. Nothing is sadder than selling when your stop gets hit only to see the price reverse shortly after!

First world problems
In a way, you are gambling that no fucking pandemic happens.
you have 300 dollars and you're bitching about not having enough options? you're dumb af for not putting it all into a cheap stock w/ lots of room for growth like PLTR (or Nio 4+ months ago).
How do I know you’re not some fucking weirdo tho 🤔🤔
Hung out with my friends recently. We’re all 24-25. We all have significant savings from living at home. Had to sit down and explain to them why they need to take advantage of free money. Think bank account bonuses for keeping a certain balance (chase), using credit cards to receive point pay outs (sapphire was a free 25% off $4,000 of spending if you redeemed points) or even just taking advantage of employer 401k match. 

These fools won’t even consider any of the above because “it is too much work.” THIS IS FREE MONEY. They complain about the PS5 being expensive. Chase fucking paid for mine + a game and a year of PS+ because I’m not poor and could afford $15,000 in an account for 3 months. I know what they make and know they could do the same but they’re just lazy fucks and it drives me nuts. I offered to do the bank account for 10 of them and I would keep $100/$600 and they said no. I then said $60/$600 and they declined. If they are so lazy they can’t do it themselves and then they won’t do it when offered a free $500 for zero work it blows my mind.

The war machine is back. The military industry will be so strong for at least 4 years. *Other than PLTR,* what other stocks can benefit from brown and black countries being bombed to smithereens by the next administration while leftists continue to cheer 'BLM' in the streets?
hi I'm Angel. this sub has called me a sociopath, genius, and some... other... things.

LET'S BE FRIENDS.
And I’m all in on PLTR
Idk what I'm talking about but looking at the average volume and shares outstanding I don't think there's anyway this group is making stonks move like that unless we have some really ballsy hedge fund managers in here. 

I think we should though with smaller stocks. The people getting pissed do this shit everyday. They are so big their farts move the market and they are mad is little guys have power now. They can F off. 

Everytime you see some big name tell you how great some penny stock is with the little disclaimer saying they own stock that's exactly what they are doing.

So the issue with nuclear powered rockets is if the rocket blows up on the ground, itd basically be a nuke. 

So why not use a massive fucking spring, I mean ducking huge, like MASSIVE AS FUCK and then putting the rocket on top of the spring, pulling it down and then letting it go so the rocket goes up into the sky and then at a certain height, the rocket turns on the nuclear reactor and if it blows up itll be so high and hopefully over the sea so it does very little damage to the people.

Best 12/4 yolo position for monday?
12/18 may be early. Sell as even as possible if possible and invest in SPXS.
Berlin's a shithole tho and everybody not living there thinks so deep into the whole germanosphere.
that's not how it works. the employees are unlikely getting the stock up front. they get a contract that basically says "we'll give you 20k shares per year, over 4 years". If the stock price goes up or down doesn't really matter since those shares are already earmarked to go to employees.

If the employees performance starts dropping tho, PLTR can likely get out of it and just terminate the employee and pocket 3/4ths of the shares it promised if done within the 1st year of employment. 

the stock booming is going to only increase productivity within the engineers and especially sales org.

I’m bullish. I think it tests ATH before EOY. Currently have a 3215 c expiring this Friday. Every week it doesn’t break out, i buy another call. Going into week 2 lol. What do I know.

LMAO! I looked up the CA spousal calculators because I didn't think that was even a thing. You poor fucks smh. It is even worse when I figured out most the payments are made to women. You dumb ass Canadian cuck simps are just getting fucked up north. You make 50k/year and get in a one year relationship, she has no kids and refuses to work for zero reason, you pay for housing/food/everything else, then you still have to pay her for over a year after you break up. That is so insane, I would honestly rather kill myself on principle than pay that bullshit socialist wealth distribution scheme.

The only way anyone makes money on a call is for the price to move higher than the seller anticipated. I'm just saying your window of opportunity is much better spanning a year than a week.

You might do better buying calls on newly IPOed companies where the price movement and "top" isn't well known yet.

For older companies like Microsoft, the volatility and growth expectations are pretty well known, so call sellers aren't going to undercut themselves. Premium is just a product of volatility and whatever price range movement market makers expect. You're not going to get AT&T call premiums on an underlying like NIO or TSLA.
Buy a PLTR December 24th call with. 35 strike price.

Merry Christmas and your welcome

Watch YouTube videos to get a decent understanding. But just think of it as risky leverage position. But one call contract is like buying 100 shares. It’s cheaper but  price fluctuates a ton. Most people can’t really handle all the red days cause you’ll see -30% or more causing you to panic sell.
Fubo, GMHI, U and a lot more...this sub is the best but PLTR is getting a bit much, in a weird way I hope it wipes out a lot if these annoying autist who feel entitled to their PLTR posting as if there wasn't an open discussion already.

Institutions bought it when it was $10/share. They won’t care if it goes back to $20, they’re holding for the long haul. Most of WSB won’t.
It's so shitty that they got rid of that combined shipping in as few parcels as possible.

Just tossing this in, you need to factor in potential negative impacts of other drug manufacturers making a “better” covid vaccine. AZN might be close — it’s not mRNA but if it comes out with their second study that the dosage error actually reliably gives 90% protection in addition to ease of production, cost, etc. it could pull back MRNA *short term*

I’ve been on MRNA and I agree there’s 20% left in the tank until EOY but just tossing this out so you don’t paperhand something good

Youve been tired before and gotten through it. Youll be tired again at some point in the future. Embrace the suck.
The main guy has been deep in purple mattress for years and was mostly shares. The stock did pump for 2-3 days and if you were in and out within this time, you made out like a bandit. Unfortunately too many people 💎🙌🏽 after the first dip believing they could will it into profits. I actually learned a lot from that experience. Not saying I’m smart, but I sold Friday morning because my options were at 250% IV and I had a bad feeling about holding through the weekend. Couldn’t have seen the Citron report coming but I had made 150% return and was happy enough. It’s the people that think these things are tickets out of poverty that get burned the most. I think PLTR will rebound. But I also see some sideways trading next week and people will get burned bad on theta decay.
I’ve never lived in a big city so maybe that’s true. I just find everyone to be somewhat narcissistic. I probably am too. Maybe it’s just human nature.
How do u know
they offer me 2 day shipping on all these items because i have prime so i ordered 18 things (sorry delivery man) on black friday then today they're delaying a bunch of my orders

so much for 2 day shipping 🤡
I'm already up 13k elsewhere so I'm good for now. Might buy back in if it dips

How is there more shitposting on the "new" submissions than on the weekend thread?
You shoulda waited for NIO day 1/9/21
This guy fucks, and trades. At the same time.
Ur gonna lose money either way lol
Im just learning to use the links so bear with me. I dont post much.
Try screaming random off the wall or horrific shit. Something like "pepperoni ball lickers Hasselhoff's anus!"That should get their attention.
Couldn't justify losing the gains. Was up around 14k. Now onto the next

Wait!? Isn’t Robinhood a stock video game?
I knew it was fake when he said he had a girlfriend.
Bruh you put money on intel. That’s your fault. Always bet on red.

If you zoom out for the year. AMZN is doing amazing well. 

I trade amzn daily and would be a bit more careful.
You should move to a big city, everyone is nice and likes to party there.
Sir, put that 50k on PLTR calls and just buy the NIO company, fix up their stochies and RSI's, make them oversold, then have fun
They do say you can get the speed upgrade for $2000 but I dunno what that actually does on the LR
December 1st, 2020 for founders. For other investors, who are not founders, lock-up is 180 days. And for VectoIQ and Cowen team, there is the additional requirement of keeping the price above $12 for 20 days. This requirement doesn't exist for Nikola team who hold the vast majority of shares. The 180 day limit arrives on Nov. 30th. But my understanding, based on how Worthington handled it, the lock-up is still in effect until the end of the day. You get to sell the next day.

Which is December 1st.

There has also been an amendment november 9th filed to allow a lock up of 136.5 million shares to be locked up until  april 30th of 2021. But there are STILL 166M SHARES that become available to sell on December 1st! 

I've linked the old sec filings (except the november 9th  one. Im too lazy too find the link right now. Its late, just google it fucktards).  Ive also linked a great comment by cheema42 who had one of the original posts. But the way he took his time explaining it was fucking golden DD. Check it out!

I bought too early on all of these except that 13. So i paid too much. But im looking to break even or print atleast $600 from all of them and cash in on the 13 puts for 12/18 22.5. See you at the finish line.
Why’d you sell
Nope, brown guy and I've never had issues with dating, but I just got out of a 10 year relationship and haven't started looking for a relationship yet, so maybe things have changed since I was last dating.
You’re not dead, yet you speak with certainty. Every experience you’ve had has been an experience of being alive.
His 2021 calls are pretty good. We're talking about vaccine approval and stimulus bill with fat renter's assistance program and probably another round of PPP loans. REITS will probably issue dividends again.  IVR will recover, probably $6+ as a temporary pop due to the catalysts I mentioned.  It's a good play. I have MITT and IVR calls myself, so confirmation bias. haha.
The amount of euphoria around here for PLTR is disturbing. No logic, no reasoning, just "PLTR $100 EOY".
Interesting choice. With the violtility of that stock I've decided to stay away. 50k is a huge chunk im excited to see what happens i hope you end up rich.
I sold mine at 55 last week. Had 450 shares at 12 average. Now all in apex
Haven't look at my all time in the last 3 months and last I checked it was like -43k 🤡. Only difference between me and you is I don't have a good paying job and I'm still throwing money into it and haven't stopped yet.

So for most of your positions, do you only get out when it hits one of your stop losses? Or how do you know when to sell?
Can someone explain calls to me please?

To the guy who asked before, yes, there is an afterlife.

And there is a supernatural realm, even if you don’t want to believe it exists.

I’ve seen some crazy stuff...
Can confirm Seattle is nutty. First house I put an offer on was a 1905-built 600sqft 2/1 in Ballard on 3000sqft lot (small even for Ballard). Listed at $475k, offered ~$515k. Winning bid was ~$620k. Pretty nice house, tbh, but it's probably a developer who bought the place to teardown and build bigger using the whole lot.

Pattern kept happening, until I think COVID managed to help land us the place we're in now. COVID and some weird deed restrictions that kept developers at bay.
But he did it quickly tho!
Dw I bought my first option for 12/4 35c right before the dip on fri. I’m a retard

Football also sucks and is just as boring as egghand*

But yeah i agree
Wait, then that would mean Girlfriend is available?
what did they increase wages to? i tried googling before asking but can't find anything
Honestly guessing a bounce up to 18.6k and if it can break that resistence -> ath if it doesnt we test 14k (previous peak). Really hoping we test 14k because some consolidation would be good in the long run and we need to test some support if this rallys gonna have legs
pretend you are a double agent for the other team and win

I think options have a place, but I have learned that buying short term options (weeklies or less than a month out) is more gambling than anything.  These fucked me hard this year after hitting one during the circuit breaker days.  Felt like I knew my shit and then pissed away most of my gains trying to recreate the luck I hit on the first one.

>:(
This is awful advice. Shitcoin hits highs then tanks for YEARS at a time. People who bought in 2017 are still negative.
If the people you speak to ignore you or cut you off, stay the fuck away from them. You may think that it's acceptable because of low self-esteem, but it's not. There are people out there who will appreciate you. They may be far and few between but quality is far more valuable than quantity.

Value yourself.
The infinity squeeze is not going to happen lol, VW had 1% of outstanding shares out of all shares... stop being unintentionally retarded now yall
I don't really see where GME can go after the holidays. Lockdowns will likely continue, people have made their large console purchases. Some decent game sales in the months after the holidays but what after that? 

I'm holding shares and either getting out early next year or just holding for years or until they go bankrupt.

Perhaps you don’t respect yourself. When you speak, you don’t speak in a way that demands respect for your thoughts. Your thoughts and feelings are important. Understand that.
isn’t this exactly what WSB’ers joke about? 😂 their wife’s bf letting them in the house again? and this dude is living that lmao
I’ll take the cash and use the entire money to buy TSLA calls that expire the next day and give you half the money.

other competitive games i haven't really enjoyed enough to be able to consistently try to improve over time
Then again, it already run 350 and rests at 250% up now... 

I'll monitor it, but next week I'll stick to news driven MJ plays and GME.
yeah, you can be a pussy and open a TDA paper trading account. Or you can be a real ~~retard~~ MAN and buy FDs and watch them expire worthless. Watching them expire is how you learn, little boy

Got my PS5 today. Dumbass GME took a week and half to send it to me even though I paid for faster shipping and then they STILL fuck up and send me two copies of Spider-Man instead of dark souls. Might buy puts just because of that...
Good time to buy? Or is it going to crash more
It's way better to be by yourself instead of hanging out with people who bring you down. Also you never know where you'll meet people; i'll be your friend

It’s time to learn other option strategies to manage your risks. 

Options is more than just buying way OTM FDs hoping to win the jackpot by buying as many calls as possible hoping to convert your calls to having close to 1 deltas (equivalent of controlling 100 shares that option price will move just like the underlying) 

You’re basically gambling with leverage in hopes to achieve the most deltas. 

Using your example of buying 10k worth long stock say $100 per share and risk of 50% downside (which is insanely volatile), consider buying Deep ITM LEAPS call option with strike prices closer to 1 deltas - this will be like owning the 100 shares flat out but will not cost you the initial investment of 10k. (given the strike price will not be zero but will be less than $50 as if you assume 50% is max loss you think will happen) 

This overly simplified scenario is already safer than buying 100 shares outright because of your capital is less even with the higher premium for LEAPS (talking from 1 year to 2.5 years and not the WSB 2 months out and assuming not crazy high volatility) The option will move like a stock if your strategy is strictly stonk directional play. 

Now combine this with spread, collars, hedge and you’ve limited your potential downside (and upside as well) even more, making it less risky. 

How you got so many upvotes is beyond me. After all, I know this is WSB but don’t misinform others about options. 

Can options to more risky if not managed properly? Of course but don’t generalize.

This is an amazing post. Listen idiots, you dont have to buy shares like this retard says. Buy long term options or LEAPs. Not your stupid PLTR 12/4 FDs. Yes, Palantir will be 200 by end of next year, but buy fucking 2022s or 2023s Palantir contracts.It is much cheaper than buying 100 shares and less retarded than fucking FDs.
It probably plays a huge role. I just have trouble taking care of myself ya feel me?
1) certain cancers could have cancer vaccines developed for them, but I don't see much upside in that space. It's an idea that has been around a while and hasn't had much success.

2) Sepsis broadly is any immune reaction to an infection which is so great that the inflammation in response to infection actually begins to cause organ damage. Crohns or MS are a bit different. There your immune cells are attacking the body and its more of a long term chronic conditions. I wouldn't call it overdrive.
It will go up. Remember, STOCKS ONLY GO UP.
It's not about feeling validated man. It's just the sense that I actually exist to someone outside of myself. Damn, I guess it is about feeling validated.

How can you check the pro forma outstanding shares?
Also consider he had 3M shares in Q1 (12% of SCION portfolio) and has since reduced to 1.7M (5.3%) as of last reporting.
Your biggest gain was marrying that wife of yours. Treat that one good.
sell puts on stocks with insane premiums...TSLA, NFLX, NVDA, SHOP, etc. wait till you get assigned (might take awhile), buy 100 shares, sell covered calls until you get assigned...at this stage, you’ll have a lot more money than you started with. keep running this or once you’re assigned and have cash, just YOLO on PLTR, TSLA, or whatever the flavor of the month is. not fool proof, but could turn that 400k into a couple mil if you play it right
Don’t be retarded.  I was audited twice in my 20s when I made less than 40k/yr.  Income has nothing to do with your chances at being audited.

The bad thing is if you make 1 million in Dec and lose it all in Jan you are fucked. A guy was gifted a bunch of 'things' in Dec when those things were very valuable and by Jan they had crashed in value. He owed the full 34%ish on the value they were at in Dec.

The family guy quote is 100% correct. Politicians specifically republicans but deff on both sides repeatedly used 9/11 as a talking point for increasing their own corrupted wealth instead of actually learning from the experience and changing the policies that created 9/11. 
Politicians knew that if they brought up 9/11 it would appeal emotionally so they milked it.

>$ABNB- read the S1. They stopped all marketing and still got 80% of last years volume, IN A PANDEMIC. Their user base is extremely loyal (most of their guests are acquired without spend).

This right here. Along with the fact that I personally love AirBnb as a service is the reason I will buy into it. From all the companies IPO'in the recent months only Airbnb has a product that actually attracts me. Travel will never go away but hotels can, people will always rent out short term, Airbnb is the way. They get free adverts from all those travel youtubers so they never need to spend anything anytime soon. + Covid depression is temporary so if Airbnb ipo's at the current situation, then the undervalue given to it is enough to buy.
When all of this is over no one will ever want to look at zoom again. They’ll still need this type of service, but zoom will end up triggering everyone too much so something else will take it’s place.
aapl is going to hurt over the next 6mo-1yr from the antitrust stuff.

the <$1m rate cut shows they are feeling the pressure and its widely seen as a joke from the big tech companies.  it wont be enough to stop the criticism and they're dependent on massively growing services revenue.  All of the changes in big sur are going to exacerbate this, and they have very little they can do to mitigate it now.

Not at all. That’s the cycle though, right?

I'm not talking about PLTR. PLTR is an entity of it's own and a totally different discussion. I'm more or less wondering if WSB is an oracle of sorts that finds rocket ships like PLTR and simply brings them to light for the commoner? PLTR was always destined to rest on, or beyond the moon.

For one the brokerage rates for businesses are significantly steeper than for retail.  All of that free stuff they give your retail account requires you to sign an agreement saying it is for personal investments only.  The instant you have a business you have to pay for all of that stuff.

Yes absolutely, it's just like in here, more money = more losses.
I went deep with PLTR, 10,000 shares at the IP for 9.95. I was going to sell when it hit 26.5, but something told me to hang on for $30... I legit think we will see it Monday.

Hell, I'm actually thinking we'll see $40, but I don't know if I have the courage to hold on to it for that long. I don't actually know much about PLTR other than its one of Peter Thiel's companies. Holding AMD was easy for me, I have a deep understanding of the semiconductor industry, CPU design, etc., but Palantir is quite literally a black box company.

He’s selling covered puts. 

So he collects the premium, and if it drops and gets assigned he’s already got the shares and he makes money off the put he purchased for free from credit.
The premiums are fucking nuts, decent way to reduce your costs and or get a very quick 30% win (capped)
If you have a net capital loss of 15k this year (your losses exceeded your gains by 15k) you can take a 3k deduction against your income this year and 3k each year until you used up all 15k of your loss (3k this year and 3k for the next 4 years)

You asked why should anyone be responsible. Im telling you the spirit of the law: sometimes individual sacrifices must be made for the good of the couple. If you agree with it when the decision (of one partner not working) was taken, respobsibility of picking up the slack falls on the entire couple.

I still don’t get it. What are you selling and what do you want to buy? You want to buy calls expiring 12/4? For what ticker?
"Idk, my dropout girlfriend has male friends & often invites them over without my knowledge while i'm working, one time it caught a scrappy looking street person leaving the house, very scragly, looked like he'd been on a million drugs, like a male crackwhore & he told me she pays him for company, she gets angry and says it's my fault for never being home and says I always abuse her, you'd need a little more to be suspicious than just that"

I suspect GME will become similar to what Humble Bundle is today but with a merch store.  GME can add some sort of subscription model and members can rent any game at the stores.  Add a premium plus model to include consoles as well. GME has to be smart about it though.
Well if she would at least bring in some money...
Or we just continue to live semi normal and not give a fuck about the virus.
So, hookers it is, have to support service industry in these hard times and not support polluting the planet by buying more stuff to myself or the others.
I thought that too, but I don’t really have extended episodes or anything. My emotions come and go relatively quickly regardless of external stimulus. And I’m never really feeling anything too extreme that it’s difficult to handle, just uncomfortable.
its a book is why

Both are pretty extended on the chart but these puppies are still ripe after a pullback as they are early in IPO phase

Was gonna make a post but essentially CRSR has 17 mil shares float compared to PLTR 1 billion. CRSR can fuking fly with ease 🚀 I'm all for PLTR but this looks juicier for lift off. I do think PLTR is better long term though. Obviously PLTR has meme strength so as u can see the charts are actually similar. CRSR had monster good earnings too with gaming now mainstream. Thoughts?

You got your roth with Vanguard? How are you able to trade options in there. I tried and was unable to.
It's crazy how TV always equates riots with drops in stock markets, when in reality, it's quite the opposite. Riots and unrest always cause massive upward stock spikes📈. You can see it in all of the charts.  We've lived through it, time and time again.

Sell stocks on Monday and buy calls for 12/4. Then after selling stocks.  80/20 GME PLTR after.

APHA is strictly a play on everyone hoping the government reclassifies cannabis.  I plan on getting a bunch of calls Monday with the only intent of holding long enough to sell it back before it tanks again.

Sorry for your loss.  Lost half my savings when I was starting out because I foolishly decided to trade penny stocks. Never ever trade penny stocks.

(Yeah, I know, NIO was a penny stock at one point and almost went bankrupt same as AMD but those are exceptional cases)
Where do you find a horse drawn carriage to sit in
My average buy price went up to 24. Do you suggest me putting a stop loss or nah.

I actually recommend against that. And not just because I’m trying to give you the boomer advice you want. Do half in AAPL if that’s how you feel. That’s basically a VR/AR play for the next few years.

Likely a small dip, but NIO will recover. There’s a ton of people waiting to pounce and buy shares when it goes down. More and more major institutions are jumping in now.
Soccer also sucks and is just as boring as football.
Wait so your telling me if I lost 15k I can claim 3k loss this year and next year another 3k?
Depends on who is in the white house.
Leverage just means you "borrow" money from your broker and invest that. That basically results in much higher returns/losses, because you invest much more than you have.
Any particular reason, or just hoping to make money fast instead of slow?

I just use their website if I really want to dive deep into the chain. The app is fine for trading and monitoring (which is all I use it for), but you're going to have to use a separate source for any analysis and strategizing.

Mine too, all I mentioned was Wahmen.....
I don’t know about you guys, but my emotions will fluctuate so much throughout a day or over a couple days. I’ll wake up, go to my girlfriends thanksgiving, and just feel fucking anxious. Don’t really want to talk to anybody, kinda just run off and sit in a coach and hide away. Give me a couple hours and I feel good. Not like manic happiness or anything, but I feel confident and I’m enjoying my time and the company of others. What flips the switch? I’ve tried a million different mental strategies and what have you but I’ve never really found a way to control how I’m feeling. One day I’m feeling good next thing you know I’m feeling kinda overwhelmed and anxious. Although it feels like I have no control and nothing that I try works, gradually, I feel like I’m gaining a little more ground every day. And then the next day my head feels fucked. The mind is a maze.

Gonna regret it when PLTR is gonna be called by boomers "the new tesla"

spousal support? its a gf not a wife. just dump her and leave.
I'm super curious. With 2% stop losses, I assume you're never long on a stock? How long do you typically hold?
Gotcha
Well, you can either offset other capital gains (No limitation) or offset $3,000 in ordinary income (wages and shit) per year. So if you don't have other capital gains, you will be carrying $5,500 to 2021.

Referring to (u/Trading-Resources)
I would advise on going short with $ROPE, if too long the leverage dissipates and you’ll be left hanging without concrete results/profits. But I think if I’d lose $1.2M I’d short $ROPE, but can’t speak for him tho.
Because it doesn’t make economical sense especially when they can run an online platform
I got the best idea. What if we never sell PLTR and just borrow against it from Margin account. Never need to pay back since it’s always going up as no one sells. Post pandemic recovery secured
Does RH still give you a free stock of your choice for joining? If so I am going to join so I can get another share of PLTR for the upcoming moon mission.

In October DKNG hit $60+ with 19 states that allowed sport betting. Since then 5 more states have legalized with others close behind, and Canada is looking like it’s close to decriminalization. 

My bet is for this thing to hit 80+ EOY, but it wouldn’t surprise me to see ATH within a couple weeks.

(1) So its pretty much all infectious disease? Nothing outside of that like cancer or autoimmune inflammatory disease like Crohn's or MS?

(2) I am not talking about systemic sepsis when I refer to immune system going overdrive into an autoimmune disease. I am talking about a disease like Crohn's or Multiple Sclerosis. These are diseases where the host immune system attacks the host digestive system or nerve cells respectively. What does that have to do with systemic sepsis which is related to pus-forming bacteria in blood/tissue?

pussy paper handed bitch. do you even have a GME position?

Guess what gentlemen and lady. On Monday I’m not going to buy PLTR or GME. I’m not even going to buy a retarted SPAC. I am going to buy QQQ, ARKK, MSFT, and AAPL. And I’m going to hope my INDA and EWS print. 

Fuck your two tickers.
Set a bunch of limit orders. Sell some at 200% gain. Some at 250, 300, 350, 400, etc. I have started putting in some orders. Just have 80 shares but intend to buy a lot more.

Out in orders to sell 10 shares at 50, 10 at 51, 10 at 52, and so on. All the way to 100 or something.

Just so you know, you entered the market at literally the best time in modern history, maybe ever. Simply buying in near the bottom of the march crash would’ve doubled most portfolios at this point, just as it nearly halved them on the way down.

Valorant isn’t that fun anymore. League of legends is ok but I still don’t really play it much. I just bought a new pc but I don’t really game anymore.

buying shares is what we all need to do to try and trigger the squeeze. so yes buy shares.
not really, you just make sure you can cover it with capital losses (not ideal) or sell to cover at the end of the year if your still up (or keep trading and hope you dont lose it all and cant pay your tax).  The balance in your robinhood account is the same as a balance in a bank.
all in pltr until it's at $50 min

These replies are pure poetry
If my firm ran an index fund I would have already bought the shares I needed for the fund. I’d buy them and hold them in a ‘house’ account. Then as we approached the inclusion date I’d ‘sell’ the shares over to the index fund I managed at the current price at that time, booking the profit to my house account. 

These investment companies aren’t going to forgo the profit to be made by waiting to purchase. Those investment companies are sophisticated and have very low cost of capital. Whether it be options or shares, these firms have positioned themselves to benefit from the current gains in Tesla we’ve been seeing. While this may not be true for 100% of the shares needed for the index funds, I find it difficult to believe that a very large number of shares (possibly thru calls) haven’t already been purchased.
It's designed that way to make it seem exclusive. You need someone more experienced to show you how to use it which in turn makes you think all the knowledgeable folks use it.

Before everyone says that NIO/BABA are audited by PwC and will be fine — please consider the fact that PwC China has not cooperated with PCAOB in the past, and thus the US is unable to verify the procedures of Chinese auditors.

In fact, BABA has this explicitly in their annual reports:

PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.

This is an issue between PwC China and the PCAOB. There is no doubt in my mind that if it comes to it, NIO/BABA/etc. will all push for compliance... whether their Chinese auditors follow suit is unknown.

The IRS treats it as one big income at the end of the year, as long as everything is realized before Jan 1st. So if you make 100k in March and lose 100k in April, you owe taxes on $0, because your income was $0.

Have you paid taxes before?

Caveat; wash sales. 

Edit: if this was not the case, no one would be making money except the IRS. Just make sure you realize your losses before Jan 1st.
Quality comment, bro. This is why I come to this subreddit, lol
Yup. You get taxed on sells, not withdrawals.

that's for the tax rate on short term gains.

>Can I deduct my capital losses?
Yes, but there are limits. Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.
Okay, noob tax question...

Do I owe taxes? Yeah I've made money, but I've fully reinvested all of it.. like i haven't cashed anything out.  I've definitely closed a bunch of positions, but I immediately open different positions back up.  Am I still going to be taxed on this 11k gain even though it's all fully invested right now? I have no cash on hand

I'd pay for Snoop Dogg to be on Fast Money
Profitable, they land big corp and gov contracts, long contract dates.  Since they're not SaaS, there's probably less interest from tech investors and the company probably looks too "safe", so this might take some time take off.  Once options are available and we see some of the newer contacts posting profits, this could run.
this isnt how it works

Since I was 16 I started smoking weed daily and it was no big deal. After doing psychedelics I’d smoke weed and it would trigger psychedelic episode where I’d hit start tripping the fuck out and basically have an anxiety attack at the same time. But I didn’t stop smoking so this pretty much happened every night for  at least a year. Don’t ask my I didn’t quit smoking. I also was extremely sleep deprived for years on years. The house I was living in when everything went to shit was an extremely chaotic environment with no real stability, but this was mostly my fault. Shortly before I had my mental break I got nose surgery so they had to completely plug my nose so I literally didn’t sleep for a week. It got to the point where it felt like I was tripping when I was completely sober and I barely slept. I think all of this reached a pinnacle which is what caused my episode and years of this type of kind experience along with the episode is has done some fair damage to my psyche. Honestly though I’m just so fucking thankful I’m sane. For months after my episode my head was pretty much fucked and I thought I might be that for the rest of my life. The most terrifying thing I’ve experienced was being completely fucked in the head, knowing I was completely fucked in the head, and just praying that it would get better eventually

As long as you don't get too crazy, calls are good for the occasional plays that you feel really strongly about where you don't want to commit so much capital that it throws your diversification ratios off ( if you have any ), but still want exposure to the type of upside a heavier investment would grant you.  As long as you view them as just a few of a bunch of tools you have at your disposal to execute your plan, they can be used responsibly without turning your balance into a bankroll and the market into a casino.

A board seat would appease someone seeking personal validation. RC wants the board to capitulate to a new vision and direction. I would not be surprised to see the drama of a vote play out. He’s already tried persuasion and has no reason to be patient. I think he’s wargamed this and has an established timeline of events. Black Friday, the upcoming earnings report, console releases are all factors which he can use to time his moves and increase his influence. He’s not doing it for us, but it seems we are welcome to ride along because we can be a force to aid him. I’m fine with that.

I mean I think its fair if its a normal couple that break up for normal reasons like "maybe we aren't made for each other." Or "my career is just really getting in the way"
AND the one person was entirely financially dependent on the other.

But having to pay for someone who is "renting out" other dudes....you shouldn't have to do that, come on.
Its like paying alimony to a cheating ex-wife. You shouldn't have to.

Edit: unpopular opinion which is understandable.

It's just imo, if you date someone who doesn't work and you both have a verbal contract to rely solely on your income, its kinda fucked to kick them to the curb all of a sudden when you both come to the adult conclusion that you should see other people. 

What are they going to do, file for unemployment? They thought they could rely on your income. Most decent guys would offer them a place to stay for a few months untill they find a job and new place,  but i guess the law was passed because there's people out there that are dicks.

Dislike it all you want, its the moral thing to do. How to get around it? Don't date housewive, jeez
Imagine how bullish it would be if the cia disappeared Andrew left?

when you get your 1099 it will have you loss and gains at the bottom and thats what you’ll pay taxes on this is the way my tax guy did it.
Nope. That’s mine, and so far it’s not working so well.  I’m thinking of changing to buy low, sell high if this one doesn’t pan out soon.
The difference between short-term and long-term capital gains taxes is incredible. If I sold now I would need an 18% return between now and May to make up for the difference!

Quick question about taxes. If I buy an option and sell a week later and make $10,000 but then I put that money in another option and it expires worthless the next week, I owe $0 in taxes right? Or do I still have to pay on the trade that made 10k?
Because people give up their jobs to look for kids. This causes a disadvantage all throughout life because you'll never have the same financial power as your spouse, that works. When the two people separate, they amass their net worth and income and divide everything 50/50. This make sure there is no imbalance of power and prevents a lot of marital abuse because humans are trashy.

Maybe you hit your max annual contribution already
I’m a noob can u explain
Agree. However, arent their brokers already asking all these questions about experience and knowledge as required by the regulatory organizations in every country? They all have cute videos explaining it all.
To be precise, uncle Sam doesn't know until your broker reports your annual profits, loses, and whether they were long or short term. It's up to you to claim the same numbers on your return. You get caught if you are audited. The penalties for lying are severe, even if you didn't intend to make a false claim.

Open up a sole proprietorship(a small business without the llc or inc).       

Pull money from your sole proprietorship into your solo 401k. I think you can go up to 50k before you have to claim income from your business.       

Use your sole proprietorship to pay for rent, internet, software, analytics etc.        

Max out your health savings account.    

If you have kids, open up a child savings account but be aware of the rollover dates as it will go back to 0 on the rollover date.         

Give gifts as payment for “analysis or doing a specific job.” Make sure they know they have to claim it as a form of income and not a gift(tax write off as business expense).      

If you don’t have enough money to run your own hedge fund(llc or inc your business is $2k and a business expense write off) then you probably don’t have enough money to worry about burying your taxes.

I've done leaps and medium term options. It isn't worth it. For example it's 3k for an atm msft call for about 6 to 12 months. That means msft has to go up 30 dollars atleast to break even. If you buy more volitile stocks like tsla or nio then chances are the premium is already too high.

Seconded. It's all about communication. I'm at the tail end of dissolving a marriage that was amazing at first, but a lack of communication on issues we apparently had ignored because we weren't comfortable discussing them resulted in long-standing resentment under the surface. Those stereotypical arguments over trite bullshit only ever blow up because they're a conduit for every other grievance that hasn't been aired. It sounds really lame to literally say things like, "hey, let's just talk about our feelings for a minute" but that's the kind of thing that keeps you in sync.

Good luck OP, hope it goes better than mine.

I for one, embrace the "get rich quick" crowd because of reasons.
I want to get into options, but I have a lot more to learn. Honestly, I wouldn't buy it either. I would focus on much cheaper options. Especially after it has already shot up so much. It could shoot to the moon tomorrow, I just consider it as not being my money. 

I like this sub, but I have my own trading strategy that I'm trying to perfect and yolo plays don't really fit into it. I'm just here for the yucks, and gain porn for motivation. I usually skip the loss porn. But I can still make a lot by trading penny stocks, so I'm not completely without risks. They have proven very difficult to trade though. I'll keep practicing, and only use a few thousand to play around with after I can be consistently profitable paper trading.

Any bets on the top? Lockdowns are somewhat predictable based on death rates and shocking news stories that show stacked bodies and refrigerator trucks. Politicians will be inclined to react. Planet fitness will plummet in nearly the same time frame than the rona stonks like zoom go back into the stratosphere temporarily. 

Based on a former career in research, I would guess death rates will hit the “terror threshold” in about three weeks, give-or-take. That leaves many green days and a few flat days to profit. SPXS and UVXY leaps are dirt cheap and probably will be for another week, maybe more.  This week will be weed, Amazon, dkng, etc. Don’t hold so much that you can’t get out fast. No need to be cashgang yet but cash is better than scrambling to liquidate positions in a rush. Make a plan, make some money, then get the fuk out and reassess. Best of luck, retards.

Yeah and if we all bought lotto tickets every week, we'd have some winners every now and then!

I've bought and sold stock at various times. Selling the news and buying back in after the hype wore down. The average basis for my 20 shares right now is $105, but I've probably profited twice that in various trades as I'd previously bought in at $80.

At this point, I think good news is going to keep pouring in. You'll have the EUA, then order after order and shipment after shipment. Revenue will be pouring in and you'll have earnings per share north of $8. It's going to be disgusting. I'm jacked to the tits.

Bro I use webull and day trade constantly and I'm below 25k. You just need to use a cash account, not margin.

You use +90% of your account on trades, you're sol because of the T+2 rule.

Absolute crazy shit lemme tell I remember the entire experience it was wack. Anyways, I’m 21 now and ever since that experience I have an altered personality. Nothing crazy, but I’m much more anxious now, and things just generally aren’t very smooth. I feel like psychedelics have just upset my sense of reality in general and even though I don’t really have any mental issues now or problems with dissociation, my psyche feels scarred, hopefully not permanently.
30->150 is way more likely to happen then 140->540

especially with the relevance of PLTR in this pandemic starting in 2021

In America, for a court to find a cohabitation agreement, you generally have to have either an explicit agreement to support your spouse or an implied agreement (which can be inferred from the circumstances: for example if you have a shared bank account or one spouse provides for the other for a long time). 

Common law marriage is a different thing and can only be effectuated in less than 10 states now. Common law marriage requires holding yourself out as married to the public as well as (at least intermittent) cohabitation. I’ve heard the 7 years thing too, but you’re right that it’s not quite accurate. I’m pretty sure that’s either just a myth or archaic law. 

Obviously this is all governed by state law so jurisdictions vary, but those are some general rules. 

US courts will bend over backward to find a marriage if a relationship looks like it could’ve been one, but Canada sounds bonkers.

If there is any advice I can give, is don't let things fester. If theres an issue, confront it head on. Little things add up. Reflect often on your attitude, and how you approach issues. Marriage is not the end result, it is the beginning of a new foundation, one in which you will both continue to grow in. Embrace the growth and support each other emphatically.

1) Other vaccines in their pipeline include CMV and Zika mRNA vaccines. They are also working on personalized cancer vaccines. With the mRNA platform being essentially proven, these are something to be bullish on as there is time and now substantial revenue that will come in to help improve them. The COVID vaccine we are seeing data for was designed in 2 days since all they needed to do was clone the DNA into their construct. An mRNA vaccine is just mRNA (disease specific) and a lipid carrier. The carrier can be used with any mRNA from any virus and we're seeing now that this system is proven to work in humans.

2) What you're talking about is systemic sepsis. That is overdrive way beyond what I'm describing here. With a safe vaccine dose like the 100ug dose established in this trial, you'll have a strong immune reaction which will result in a lot of T and B cell proliferation (the cells are multiplying and learning to recognize the coronavirus). You might feel pain and fatigue, but it will subside in a few days. Then you're protected. The response is specific and targeted at the virus, so there isn't danger of self-attack.

So is gold correlated to USD or does gold gain equity over time?

On a half century time horizon gold an oil are two overvalued commodities; they have uses, but will 1.) No longer be remembered as the currency standard of "the good years" and 2.) No longer be the energy standard of the West or East...basically Africa and Western Asia might still be generating demand for oil as energy.

Gold has inherent value, but so does wheat. Will gold drop to wheat prices? No, of course not. Can you make money trading gold futures? If you're good and lucky. Would I invest in Gold over the long term? Maybe a little bit for diversity but certainly not a large portion of my portfolio.

Remember, Palladium was discovered less than 200 years ago, Platinum was discovered less than 300 years ago. Both really saw their usefulness be realized industrially in the past ~40-50 years.  Gold is as old as human history. If scarcity is your metric there are a dozen or so elements that more scarce, some have more industrial applications than gold.

True, did this with PLTR call for March. I sold close to the top but even with the dip in Friday it was still up $125 compared to when I bought it. Probably would have destroyed any gains and gone negative if it was a weekly call.

They are an AI company. As the tech advances over the coming years they will be situated to dominate the field.
I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying. I'm saying that people have been covering their short positions, and the same, or new people, have been buying new short positions. I'm sure there have been millions of short positions covered from $11-$14 but then more people bought more shorts.

Someone asked way up earlier in this comment chain if the short squeeze was already happening to an extent and I was trying to say that yes, it is happening because people are covering their positions, increasing the price of the stock. 

There is STILL a large portion of shorted shares because people have been buying new short positions as well. 

>What's likely happening is that people are buying new short positions at a higher price keeping the overall short position high.

I graduated from UWEC in may. Finance + Acc double major. the thing I didn't like about the fin program there was that it was sooo focused on markets and banking, but the majority of finance roles are actually in corporate fin planning/analysis. So if you're thinking about dropping because you don't like your classes, know that your career will probably be different. That being said, electricians w/ good experience absolutely rake. And it's a trade where you'd be able to start your own business pretty easily, if that's something you're into.

I have a dream of building an EV. 

when I was 9, a classmate/friend of mine have a family business of selling hardware part. We like futuristic robotic technology and cars, typically. We joke a lot about making EV based on parts that can be found in his store such as using the cordless screwdriver motor for each individual wheels of the vehicle. Of course, it's all just joke and banters for a bunch of 9 years old. He even invited me to try it out during the break but I turn it down cuz 'mom wouldn't allow'. 

However, now that we see the rise of EV, I wondered what if I accepted his invitation? Of course there won't be a real production model out and it would probably be just a lot of glued mess and we may get electrocuted a few times but maybe it'd spark some interest in me to be an engineer, mechatronics perhaps. How'd my life be when compared to now since I'm still just a boring pharmacist student. Would I enjoy my life more since I like wiring stuff cuz I've installed a lot of LED strips on bikes as hobby and I like it when I was 16.

A big issue I have is I’m a finance major and I can’t see any career path that doesn’t involve a desk job and I’d rather jump off a bridge. Also I have a horrible work ethic when it comes to school and I’m struggling to stay afloat and pass my classes school makes me want to jump off a bridge as well
The question is who is buying these weeklies from you?

The strike price is the price per share you will pay to buy the stock. The break even is the strike plus the amount you paid per share for the options contract. You’re contract will be exercised if the stock is above the strike price if it’s a call or below your strike price if it’s a put assuming you have the buying power late in the day on expiration. If you don’t have the buying power to buy 100 shares than your contract will be sold automatically.

Assuming college isn't ruining your mental health & considering it's free, I'd stay in because 1) degree is better than no degree 2) your major allows you to learn things that'll make you a better trader/investor

To answer your question beachedpail, I think dropbox is already worth it, I’d buy it if it was at $35 on the increasing revenue alone, but the fact that they could implement features that made Slack so popular and still be a cloud storage company reassures me that they will be successful in the future

Buying back of shares reduces the Float and makes a stock MORE susceptible to sways in the market. E.X. it's easier to herd 22 cows than it is 1,000 of them.
Buying back shares is usually a confidence play. A company is saying; "we think our shares will go up in value, you should too".

Two questions:

(1) Is there any particular reason that you have confidence in MRNA and mRNA technology to make a huge impact in something OUTSIDE of coronovairus? If so, what? I'd buy shares if it can make a big transformation in another disease area that has not been solvable.

(2) Isn't there a negative side to making the immune system go into crazy overdrive such as auto-immune disease where the immune system starts getting to aggressive and attacks the person's organs?

You gotta play options to make the big bucks.  Big rewards don't come without big risks/losses.  Otherwise, you have to invest A LOT of money in stocks you think will go up by 1000% (they are very rare and impossible to predict) before seeing returns like that.

99% of the stocks that get shilled here are only shilled after an initial catalyst has already occurred, so the plays are mostly riding the wave up of a stock that's already on the way up.

I’m no rocket surgeon but my understanding is the multipliers they use for heavy R&D companies are 5-8X what they use for traditional firms. On top of this, Palantir’s software is designed to optimize a company’s operations/expenditures. I imagine this will make them even more profitable than we can currently imagine as AI tech explodes in its capabilities over the next decade. Just my amateur opinion. Take it with a grain of salt. I just started investing and Palantir makes up 60% of my meager portfolio and WSB makes up 60% of my research.

If you still have the contracts open, you can exercise it and hold the shares for a year to get taxed at long term rate (assuming you have the cash to exercise and want to hold the stock for a year).
If you have unrealized losses, realize them to offset your realized gains, but don't touch the stock again for 30 days to work around the wash rule (assuming the stock isn't rallying anytime soon).
Otherwise there also like tax deferred trading accounts and retirement accounts like Roth that you could find beneficial. You could also look into registering yourself via LLC to get business tax breaks.

what? I saw earlier that sales were down 50%, we are not hitting a record...
I made that mistake once before with PLCE. In their Q2 earnings they said their next earning will be very bad, but it wasn’t, it actually turned out to be great! The sign that I missed was exactly the fact that not only they didn’t sell their position, but they bought more! I sold my PLCE position too early and missed a 2x run! Not gonna make the same mistake twice!

Edit: generally most recovery stock I’m following expected to have bad Q3 earnings, but almost all of them beat their Q3 earnings by a long shot.
[removed]
What's the downside on GME? A pullback after earnings to $14? $12? And then what? Look at the fucking e-commerce data I've been spamming on twitter, their e-commerce business alone is on track for more than $1.3-$1.5B in 2020 revenue. THE ENTIRE FUCKING COMPANY STILL TRADES FOR $1B MARKET CAP.

As a retail investor I think it makes more sense to base our judgements for these types of companies off of the actions people who know more than us, and use that as a proxy for performance rather than revenue. Look at who's invested, fund inflows and outflows. Read research and look at ways they have an advantage in the industry/economy. The tried and true method of using traditional ratios doesn't really apply in this realm.
I bet on both. But Tyson loss is bs. Good thing I also bet on $DKNG Calls.

I think GME won’t dip after earnings for two reasons:

1. If people on BoD knew the earnings are bad, they would trim their position, none of them did.

2. When a lot of people expect something will happen, it won’t.

Well, if the trend continues and people keep favoring Playstation over XBOX.... this deal might not bode well in the next decade of console sales. (best selling PS, the PS4 sold over 2x as many units as the best selling XBOX, the XBOX 360)
I agree PYPL could do everything SQ is doing, but SQ has a much larger focus on the retail side of things (e.g. they do physical payment processing, do loans, manage payrolls, etc), and they and stripe are eating into the online segment that paypal used to dominate. But I think PYPL still has lots of room to grow. I own shares in both, but I mainly play SQ options.

I think we’re currently at the beginning of a shitcoin bull run. Once it reaches ath again, I think normal people are gonna fomo into it again. I’m expecting it to reach 100k before it crashes again. Any blimpto the gov would establish would be a stable coin, which shouldn’t affect shitcoin’s price too much (think of it like a slightly more useful gold).

You really can’t go wrong with either of them. I would recommend playing both if you have the money. They did about the same last week too, so you really can’t go wrong.

PLTR was friday profit taking, it's nothing new, stocks don't always go up.

But yes, bought at 563 @ $20 and planning to hold longer term, might sell before xmas for a holiday season cash injection, might sit on my hands through next year.

Can you comment on why I would want to buy a position like PLTR 2 years away? I was deep ITM on some 11/2021 calls and so I sold and bought OTM call spreads over the beginning of 2021.
consider the preferred shares. They currently trade around $18 and have a par value of $50. I bought a bunch at $12 when Corona hit

This is a retarded way of thinking of things. I could understand if there was a clear pattern of one person demanding the other stay at home for some reason (cleaning, caring for animals/kids, etc) such that that person couldn’t earn a wage, but if it’s just that your partner is a lazy fuck and you’re too much of a puss to kick them out, that shouldn’t mean you have to support them like you’re married.

>terday—MRNA up like 14%, NVAX up 22%). Plus mRNA vaccines are super painful

are mRNA vaccines painful, yeah huge pain in the ass cause technology is so new and still developing. mRNA vax tech was developed knowing that this would eventually become a vastly cheaper way to treat disease compared to current methods. This is due to how cheap mRNA sequences can be produced... we don't need to incubate in fucking eggs. We haven't had the time to figure out how to improve the cost of deployment (the current downside), but we never thought we would need to do so this soon. The fact of the matter is this, if we were dealing with a virus similar to many we have dealt with before, using an adenovirus delivery system (vector) wouldn't be a long term problem. Fact is, the 'Rona is not inFLUenza. We will need to revaccinate every few months to maintain antibody levels (aka protection). With such frequent immunizations, it is highly probable that our immune system will recognize adenovirus payloads. It will destroy them faster than they can deliver the payload. To dumb it down a bit, our bodies are under attack with a next gen-bomb. This is a war we are losing, and one that we will continue to lose due to short-term antibody loss prompting the potential for reinfection after a few months. Additionally, our current line of defense will likely be overcome after a short while and we will get rekt. Also, we don't have the data to know how often our bodies can sustain repeated infections. Hell, we are just realizing that this virus is also a cardiovascular virus. Rather than wait until we can find a costly solution to fixing the deployment costs, we are going all in and deploy mRNA... I'm talking balls and all. The government realizes the costs/logistics of deployment but knows it can't keep pumping trillions into stimulus until people get their shit together... not just our government, but every place in the fucking world.

This is no different than VCs dropping coin on a company that is massively unprofitable. They know the tech will become industry-disrupting eventually. The only difference is, we don't have the luxury of time, and governments of every fucking country ARE IN THE SAME BOAT. They know mRNA will save them in the long run. Eventually, the smart money will be investing in companies that can fix the deployment costs of lipid/mRNA tech, but they have been so few because there wasn't a need. Never have we had an issue with a virus like this. 

Here's the kicker though.... mRNA is without a doubt the ONLY solution to resolving the crisis we are in. Currently, the deployment costs are through the roof due to the transportation and temperature requirements. Who do you think is the only company in the US that can build and deploy the massive refrigeration and transportation requirements our glorious next-gen defense requires? Who is going to land that government contract? 

My guess: 

**CARRIER GLOBAL CORP (NYSE: CARR)**

Take your gains guys, if you think your so good, you shouldn't need to leverage more, but rather consistently win.
Your port is like 6548. I don’t understand why you tried to hide it? r/babystreetbets
As a day trader, I can say that Halts often have the reverse effect. People chase Halts because of FOMO when they see something skyrocketing. I've seen things halt going up 9 times, and vice versa.

Halt threshold is 20% for tier 1 stocks, 10% for tier 2, in a rolling 5min period. But Halt levels are DOUBLED at market open. No halts pre and aftermarket.

The bill is going to fail and weed stocks will take a hit.

I bought into weed stocks years ago when they first came out thinking they would be a home run.

I lost thousands. Most weed companies are running at a loss. Legislation will take a few years to pass and then few more years for weed stocks to build back up.

If you want weed exposure buy something like constellation brands but idk

I think weed still has a ways to go before it booms

There are better places to make more gains out there like meme stocks and tech
If there’s a price spike, and your contracts soar in value, take your profits and run. Don’t get caught up in selling on the expiration date. Expiration dates are most important if you plan on exercising your options, which most of us don’t care to do. Getting assigned shares can get messy...avoid the drama.

 The Video Gaming Industry is now estimated to be worth **$159.3 Billion in 2020**, which is a sizeable increase of 9.3% from 2019. This is a marked difference in what was predicted for the industry with 2016 statistics forecasting a total worth of $90.07 Billion for the same period – a huge 76.8% difference between the two figures. Current forecasts estimate the video gaming industry to be worth $200 Billion by 2023.
stocks are priced based on covid resiliency.  regardless of stimulus game systems will sell out and games will sell.  stimulus is irrelevant as well as lock downs seeing as they can sell regardless. gme is a heavy cyclical , most people dont understand that concept which is why the price for dated calls was heavily discounted in june. dont think hard about this, its not hard
Yeah, it detracts from my day trading.

Is it better to buy GME shares after their earnings? Why hold through earnings when the company is on life support
This is Wall Street bets we never cut our losses we just yolo and double down. But now would be a good time to cut your losses.
Thank you for the replies bro, I really appreciate that.

Dec 8th seems like make or break to me. Video game sales are at an all time high this year because of Covid and the new Consoles. People are camping outside of gamestop to get PS5s and XBOXs.
Earnings should push it over the edge.

No one mentioned the unusual options bought on Friday, so you can find that here:

  
[https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks?orderBy=baseSymbol&orderDir=asc&page=5](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks?orderBy=baseSymbol&orderDir=asc&page=5)

By my count, if they were purchased at the ask there was about $14.5M calls purchased to $2.6M in puts.  Excluding the 0DTE options it's about $9.6M in calls to $2.6M in puts.  


Biggest purchase were for the $17 calls for 12/18/20.

And if you're into astrology, looks like it's breaking out of a cup and handle formation which usually brings a substantial jump.

It's a cycle. It's in the shitpost phase and in a couple months it'll be a too strict phase. It's a momentum thing that can't be rapidly changed
>Actually, even if PLTR doesn't hit $40 I'm STILL going to leave her ass.

Damn, I got hard reading this.  Kinda laughing at you for getting suckered so fucking hard, but I will masturbate tonight to the thought of her face when you tell her.
/u/notashypotato curious about how why you have PLTR in the "safe and less return" category with TSLA and AAPL. I could see TSLA and AAPL because of the OP having limited funds *and* both being expensive to buy. 

But with PLTR being so cheap, the OP stands to make a much bigger return on their money in dollars and percentage of investment, it would seem.

Unless there is something that I am missing.
Holy shit you’re a naive idiot.
The amount of GME posts this weekend = Moon Monday, right?!
> 3d printing was supposed to be a huge thing that never really panned out.

3D printing is panning out in the industrial sector. The dream of a machine for your home that works as easily as a microwave oven is still a long ways off. We're right around where people were with personal computers around 1975 or so.

>"There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home."
Ken Olsen, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) 1977

The reasons are the same. It's too expensive and the capabilities needed to fulfil the vision of the idea are still being discovered.

But trust me, entities who can make use of and afford 3D printers have them.

I don't know if this company will be a leader in taking 3DP to the next level, but someone's going to.

I was all aboard in 11 calls for 12/4 until Cramer had to ruin it and say he would think it’d go up.
Lol no. It's going to get pumped because everyone is going to 🤡🚗 at 12pm before RH open trading. Then it will fall like 30 percent.

I know, PYPL is already 2.5x SQ’s cap. But I feel like they are already positioned to do everything SQ does and more. I haven’t done much research on SQ yet tho. Do you think the shitcoin run is legit? I’ve heard the gov’t is discussing establishing a blimpto. What if it isn’t shit curn? Wouldn’t you roll with the company with more blimpto exposure?

yep. My memfolio went from 200k to 5k and my dont touch portfolio is well into the 6 figures. If I didn't have a memefolio and put it all into my actual portfolio i'd be close to 1M right now.

Doesnt matter really, spy was created early 90s
They just try to take stocks that are booming and due for a 5-10% correction but scare the shit out of all the boomers when they say sell so it falls double what it should’ve they are frauds and market manipulators
Let's work though this from the perspective of management.

Assume you're the CFO and you see sales are good on Black Friday but you still have several weeks to go in the year, do you really want to sign up for an amazing couple more weeks?

How about the same for Q1? Say that he sees a blow out Q4 but is concerned that Q1 will be bad because you have a new president, no stimulus, and a ton of people lose their unemployment $$$ at the end of the year. Why would he start selling a huge Q4 beat only to have to report a weak Q1 possibility?

It seems to me that the best move is to just keep is on the DL. Say that you're confident in the company and think you'll do well...and with a conservative estimate.

Nice website, thanks
Also. Not all options are risky. In fact, there are strategies involving options that are safer than buying shares. For example, you can sell puts and basically get paid to buy shares at a lower price as long as you're willing to wait a given amount of time and are willing to trade upside for safety.
I have such a hard time actually holding long calls. I don’t see the point. If a stock starts dropping why not sell your calls. Then buy back in at a lower price? Why hold on, watch it drop and hope it comes back?
This is the way

For everyone in GME, how do you plan to sell your calls during the short squeeze? Who’s going to buy them? Will the squeeze last long enough for you to off load them?

If she truly expects to get 40k from anything out of the blue, your best bet would be to “seriously” ;) link her to this sub and let the world crumble around her as she pulls bitch ass stupid moves.
I’d say Q4 will be very good, worst case scenario we get a slow squeeze after Q4 ER imo
Asking the tough questions and showing the associate producers his PP when he masturbates at them! He’d be a good member for this sub

I just have a bit more than you, almost all in GME lol. 

If you want to have easy money, you could sell the $15p (selling, not buying) and you'll get around $300 for every $1500 you put towards it as long as GME stays above $15 a share in January (very likely and you break even as long as the stock stays above $12).

If you want more risk with more reward but a degree of safety, then buy the April $15 calls. Those cost about $550 and you profit if we go north of $21 by April which is likely. 

If you don't want to worry about figuring out how options work, just buy shares. 

By the way, the options prices I quoted are as of close on Friday. The prices will be different on Monday.

Key point to note is that RC is at 9.98%. Sitting under 10% is important because he can quickly exit or load up his position.

 “Section 16 of the Exchange Act applies to an SEC reporting company's directors and officers, as well as shareholders who own more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities registered under the Exchange Act. The rules under Section 16 require these “insiders” to report most of their transactions involving the company's equity securities to the SEC within two business days on Forms 3, 4 or 5.”

Dude, curious. Still pretty young but I see a lot of this and wonder what makes people choose someone for the rest of the life that that they can only handle in moderate amounts? Is it some later realization that they don't mesh well together, or some sort of gamble you make with the person because good chemistry ≠ good at living together?

You sure you want to throw in 50k as a rookie? Be prepared for a rough ride, don’t set stop losses. Shorts are really good at what they do, they will absolutely mess with weak handed shareholders by pushing the price down and fishing for stop losses. They usually start the morning off covering a million shares to make it look like it’s spiking then short it back down again and then either close on the afternoon or morning after.

Did I miss something entirely? I thought dbx was just storage... a service to backup files mainly
Right now they are doing pretty much the same thing, just letting you buy and sell coins. SQ only lets you trade shitcoin and you can withdraw your coins directly. PYPL has a few other coins, but you have to sell (and pay taxes) before you can withdraw. Next year, PYPL’s going to let you make purchases using it, but i’m not sure what SQ is going to do.

I think PYPL is actually doing a better job at integrating it compared to SQ right now. But SQ bought 50 million worth a few months back, and I find that it correlates more with shitcoin’s price. I also think SQ has more room to grow (it only has a 100b market), but I think they are both good investments.

Generally speaking I think your logic is correct. However, Retard strength has blown away logic all year, and for that reason I think you might be wrong here. My counterpoint is that RS is presently in PLTR corner, if it wins that battle and juices that orange, it'll swap back to it's silver princess the GMEslut.
But from 1980 - 2000 it went up like 10,000%

You have this way wrong, I’m assuming you’ve never bought options before.

Yeah I want to know this, too. How far out are we looking? After the December 8th earnings call, for sure, so does that mean the December 24th call option?
It is actually around 130% of the available float.
Honestly, it’s all in our personalities. When I was that young, we didn’t have Robinhood or WSB, but I was throwing hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars around playing poker. I’m sure if I had access to options back then I woulda been doing it too.

The best thing for a chronic gambling personality to do is to set up systems and rules to avoid going completely broke in a session of rage.

For example, when I turned 21 and started going to casinos, I had this problem of going to the ATM multiple times if I was having a bad gambling session. Eventually, I put a $500 daily withdrawal limit on my debit card so that I couldn’t just donk away all of my money anymore.

It takes experience to learn about ourselves. But the people who have gambling/addictive personalities can’t just stop cold turkey. If it’s not options, it might be sports betting, casino gambling, or DFS. But the most important thing is to learn how to separate money out of your bankroll that you’re not allowed to touch (money for rent/mortgage, bills, and food).

Um I’m pretty sure a bunch of autists jerking each other off over it daily on Reddit would qualify as a catalyst. WSB rules the world bitch
Also mexico is doing legislation dec 13? Around then. Likely going to pass. Apha is the main company there for legal bud.
These mods are absolutely garbage. If PLTR hits $40 by Friday I'll buy them each off to quit their mod positions. Won't be much anyway as they all seem to be broke ass 🌈🐻.
He should be paying you for this golden info.
Seems pretty high for a short term play. Vaccine was priced in over the past month...
Shares are probably safer at this point
ah back to talking about gme. lmao all these retards are going to get wiped out by gme when we hit 18$ then go back down to 13$. 

leaps are the answers please dont lose money on weeklies then blame this subreddit for MeME sToCKs
He got knocked out by a no look overhead haymaker. Peak boxing.
I’m sick and tired of reading about PLTR on this sub! aren’t there any other pump n dumps in the market?!?
PLTR is going to hit $40 by the end of this week or the next easily.. remaining optimistic as for a $50 EOY 
🚀🚀🚀
GE is a good long-term play, but short term meh. If we don't see a major breakout on Monday with the wind turbine news that came out this weekend (unlikely), it probably won't print. 

Company has been on an uptrend but until it gains more momentum from vaccine deployment news and better PR, it's gonna stagnate a bit. We MIGHT see $12 by EOY, maybe, but I'm not certain. 

That said, I have 20x 12/4 12.5c lottery tickets in the event some boomers decide it's safe to invest again.
Christmas, birthdays and high school graduation party. Can't forget the last one.

Burry is a fine guy to have on board, but the real whale is having Ryan Cohen on board (founder of Chewy). He’s pressuring the board to get their shit together and if they don’t he’ll take it over. He owns about 10% of GME.

Actually was down 6k prior to last week got some gains off of PLTR by YOLOing my entire check. Hoping ill see green in the all time soon though but definitely don’t feel right posting gains if yall don’t know how much of a beta bitch I was before. 🥺

Nice job op. Fuck all these guys telling you to cash out. They’re the ones that would’ve told you to cash out when you hit $10/20/50/100k. Way to go man.
Already got tricked into seeing one dick pic today. Hard pass.
I’ve googled and can’t find anything.
Like I told someone else... premiums for the next few months have gotten jacked because of IV so it may be better to go further out in expiry

A vaccine in 8 months is impressive as fuck, two or more is crazy.
You're a fool if you think it's going to rally every single day. When something has this much hype, it _always_ collapses in on itself. Not to say that it's a bad buy, but your expectations in the short term are too high.
They could be looking at this uptick as a Bearflag, just another chance to make money. They pump it up a little higher with the small float but keep a Net-short position. That's what I would do.
PLTR 12/18 25c 12/32 25c bought when they were at $18

if there are any losses should hurry and realize them before the year is up and don't buy back any for that specific stock for say 31 days.

FUTES BLOOD GREEN
*you’re
Someone’s jealous. I mean you’re totally right, but this is WSB so suck it
No, there is usually an option to bet on the tie
See this is why it’ll drop when weak hands sell their shares because they think it’ll squeeze within a week or even a month. It WONT squeeze this week, and it PROBABLY WONT squeeze this month/year. Once you realize this, you’ll all sell. Which is the worst thing to go. It’s a mid to long term play for the squeeze.
GME doesn't even need a short squeeze. $30/share is now only a 2 billion market cap after GME's massive share buybacks last year. That's still only a valuation roughly around 0.25x of TTM revenues

It's definitely still a value pick right now compared to its peers in retailers. It stopped being a value trap after Cohen woke the market up and people started realizing how huge the console cycle is. The old bear thesis was that the new console cycle would actually be a bad thing for Gamestop, but they didn't know that Gamestop would pull off that Microsoft digital revenue sharing deal and that digital consoles are not widely popular in the first place.

If Cohen gets his hands on it, valuation in the multiples of at least 1x if not more might not be impossible either given how CHWY turned out (valued at \~4x of revenues)
I got Jan and Apr $20s and $25s. Adding more next week too.
Idk about that, the VW squeeze was a perfect storm lol. There will be stories of our autism tho.
That is literally the worlds dumbest game.

take cash out. figure out how much tax you owe on those gains, and take the cash out to pay irs, best to just pay right away as it hits your bank account as ACH payment with the IRS webpage; select estimated payments for the current tax year. don't forget state tax as well.
You are going to clear a million within the next week or two. early congrats on that big man

Since aug 2019 GME short float was around 53-70 mil, you are saying 200k share green candles... which is very insginficent and it would need 6 whole days of trading volume just to cover the shorts and the float is just 41 mil. Cohan already owns like 6mil shares and he would Fuck the shorts easily if he wants to be announcing buying stonks for a merger or something. 

Also, GME has just become a 1bn company when it hits 16 dollars, if it goes back to half of what it used to be (3 Bn) it would mean it should be around 50
What’s the math to get that number? If that’s true I may have a heart attack

How does draftkings even profit from a draw? they dont take a position at all but instead make money by the slightly lower payout in regards to the real odds. The more people bet, the more money they make however the result wouldnt matter.

If out of 100 people only 5 win, but you have to pay them $19 for the win it would be the same cost as if the other 95 had won $1. Isn‘t this how sportsbetting works?

You would think but there would also need to be some sort of not draw bet line as the counter party to the draw bet.

Having the counter party be the sum total of all the bets on each boxer would work but they already have the live hedge for that with the betting odds in flux.

So they can just throw up some number to entice the draw bets but it does not need to be a direct hedge.
So is jake Paul like a professional boxer now or what’s going on?
It means draftkings to 100 thats all i know

You’re thinking of parimutuel betting where odds constantly change and are only set when the event starts. Most sports betting is fixed-odds where the payout is fixed at the current line the moment the wager is placed.

The difference here is there is a bigger learning curve for options.  YOU NEVER  HOLD THROUGH earnings. IV will crush any possible upside even if you are right.  You have to learn the greeks and understand how IV changes based on timing etc.

Too many people play options and can't explain anything about them. That is their fault, same as making bad buys on penny stocks.

Lots of people that make good money on this sub are smart and just talk it up for attention.

I was essentially able to recoup all my losses about two weeks ago. I kept telling myself that I would stop if I recoup, but my dumbass kept chasing on some dumb FDs immediately once I was in the green. Back in the red now. Haven't touched an option since that day. For my financial and mental health, definitely wont for a while. Just sucks when I was really in the green, like you said. No need to dig myself deeper in the hole. Got to focus on my career too.
Not just that; their reputation would be fucked beyond repair. Hundreds of thousands of morons have paid $7k a pop for a promised FSD software update. If people realize they’ll never be able to make good on that promise, I don’t think it will be pretty

Edit: I will say though, that with the retarded valuation of their stock they could pull off a secondary offering if necessary to raise cash to pay off those pissed off buyers, or something like that.

Should be tagged as a shitpost...
I don’t know mate. 

If I was on my deathbed I’d be thinking, “shit, if I had just stopped fucking with FDs and just YOLOed that money into PLTR LEAPs I’d be dying in my own mansion with hot nurses and my family around rather than alone in this county hospital”
Depends. If it’s gonna go up, go all in.

But if it will go down, dump it
Never bought neither during that period, somehow I managed to put up with it
Absolutely, Tesla should be concerned. Just because you are first, doesn't mean you will last. Tesla didn't quite corner the market. Plus, there are EVs for various purposes. Ford wants to create EV equivalents of their Ford Transit vans, which are mainly used for city deliveries or last-mile deliveries, so range is less of a factor. Porsche already makes a much nicer electric sports car.

Tesla would be more profitable if they licensed their battery tech and autopilot for all of these car companies (making money through licensing and not spending money to produce cars) and creating the infrastructure for recharging stations. Instead, they chose to compete with all of the car manufacturers. They could have been the Luxottica of electric car engines. But that wouldn't fit Musk's personality since he wants to be in front of the cameras and not behind the scenes.
I need to start calling people mongoloids.

You need diamond hands and a big dick to hold GME. But it will pay off handsomely.
May be 100x is stretched but is not unusual for just IPOed companies that are on crazy high growth. AMZN and APPL are mature with positive earnings so probably not the right comparison. I would put PLTR with ZM, SNOW other high growth stock that recently went public. Also negative earnings skews the EV/EBITDA ratio it does not have any meaning.

ZM is trading at EV/Revenue=100

SNOW trades at EV/Revenue=300

Currently PLTR trades at EV/Revenue=50
Consider stand up
All I gotta say is if it hits 40 don't blow all that shit on Genshin Impact.

Are you worried that the next meme stock or a RBLX IPO will get enough WSB people to drop GME before the squeeze can take place?
That was a good 1
Nah DraftKings to 100

For bi weekly updates. [http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2](http://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch) for the dates when they publish. It is 2 weeks delayed. There are other services that are available that gives estimates but those are paid and I'm not sure where to get them myself. Easiest way to see is to look at volume. Normal volume is around 8-10m and when it goes above 20m that is when something is happening and big institutions are getting in on the action. 

But expect volume to spike to 80m when short squeeze happens.
are they? link?

just nio for now, i was interested in RIDE but it just feels too speculative with no product delivered and a proper review yet; im eyeing rblx and robinhood ipo, still looking, hopefully they don't ipo until after february, not sure what i will do with feb calls yet, will wait and see
But why? It's already masterfully automated, so that's one thing less for us to care of.

Assuming that she isn’t on some sort of pathological care (shrink or psychiatrist):she’s a coo-coo’s nest.

She should be taking care of herself with medication if she’s going to that extent. But given OP’s post, I don’t think that’s in the cards for her in her lifestyle.

WSB is gonna trigger the short squeeze on GME this week. 40$ by friday
It's fair to say everyone on WSB along with all the lurkers are piling into this stock
I'm sure there were people noticing a decline in the subreddit around the time I joined, too. It's largely just evolving from what it was when I first joined. Not a big deal.
Lmao at losing money on a stock that’s tripled its price in a month
Right there with you. Never thought I’d start hating the weekend.
TLDR: I’m buying PLTR hand over fist as long as it’s on WSB and wsbtrack.net says it’s the top holding

Not when you can bet the draw.
Just getting warmed up.  2021 will be the year EVs and green energy will take off big time.
Just getting started nkla ran for a few weeks
Why buy with such a short term expiration.  Buy options at least 6 weeks to 3 mths out.  That way if it moves against you short term you have time for it to move the right way.  Also set % where you will sell no matter what.  My rule is 40% down on options max depending on additional factors.

I lost about $35k on options that expired on 11/20 that I had a chance to sell some break even 2 weeks before and others I could have sold for 40% loss a couple weeks earlier.

Taking an option to 0 is stupid.
I swear only this thread cares about the betting and money implications of the fight lmfao

BIG FACTS. “This has been removed by automod for blah blah blah blah”
[removed]
Because Tesla has spent a metric shitload of money on marketing, and Redditors are mostly hivemind retards who lap that shit up. But those established companies are too responsible to have their clients beta test their software - once they release, it will be close to game over for TSLA imo. Their FSD tech won’t be able to compete, not having a dealership service model is a huge drawback for anyone who’s not a yuppie living in SF or LA, their fit and finish quality is decidedly subpar for the price range they are targeting (low quality interior materials, panel gapping, shitty paint), aesthetically some of their vehicles are ugly as sin (Cybertruck)...

Thank god saying mods are gay doesn't get deleted. Otherwise you couldn't even state your despair.
This.
Guidance will be more important than earnings.  Gme could have decent earnings, but if they don't tout their debt repayment and flex on their online sales improvement we could see a post earnings drop.  

If you're worried about earnings, you can "hedge" by buying half your position now and half after earnings.  Shares only, no weeklies.

I sold my NIO call to buy more PLTR calls. Although I wish I would have waited for NIO to report there November call deliveries, stock seems to rally after they do (I have shares).

I don’t even know what an option or put or whatever is. I buy shares. If they are at a loss I hang on to them for long term. As soon as they  make 10 percent or so I sell them. I do not make a killing, but I beat the inflation. I am a slightly gay bear I guess.

what were the odds for a draw? how much would the payout have been?
Another part of his problem is retardation.

Might as well make it $1000 and let us run a train on your mom.
yea Er is a complete coin flip. I personally think it will dump, but who knows. And yea those are some main bear cases, imo the ER dump will happen, and the second case is what I’m afraid about... longs selling, however if Cohen buys, if enough longs recall shares, there should be a significant squeeze, but that’s also quite unknown right now. And then yea, if Cohen leaves the situation is fucked, but I don’t see him leaving tbh
My last girlfriend tried to say I was abusing her. Which she already claimed before and I spent time for. Then i realized I was done, threw my shit in a laundry basket, the tall one, and dipped the fuck out of there. Get out while the getting is good.

If there is a draw option to bet on then you do not get your bet back iirc. If there isn’t a draw option then you get refunded. Someone correct me if I’m wrong, there’s no way they pay out all on draws and refund the rest.

No, when the pandemic started I dropped like 350 at GameStop on a switch lite, ANCH and link’s awakening for my gf to help her cope with the pandemic. I also bought a digital copy of ACNH with Nintendo online for my friend. The switch was constantly selling out and hard to come by. I also noticed Employees were complaining about working and being considered “essential.” It just reinstated my belief that GME was a good buy

Best of luck to you.
I think people are hoping GME will _"pull a rabbit out of their hat"_ and become relevant again. Personally, with the Nintendo Reggie guy on their board, I think they might have one last trick up their sleeve.
Im waitin for it to drop big time, or once they pull out their earnings , I’ll throw 500 and go on from them. But y’all got me hyped to throw 1000. We’ll see ⏳

Oh shit, I did not know that. Calls on this dude for bringing the real DD
So you sold the first one for 350, let's say you buy it back for $83 (current price), you made $267 right there and are back to just owning shares....  You are then free to do whatever you want, including selling another options and earning a couple hundred again to wait another week.  Or you can wait until close to the 4th and do the same thing, or if it goes over $40 then someone has the right to buy your shares from you at $40 a share, unless you buy back the call you sold before then.
What you mean
You have a job that allows you to lose 400k so that's good. You also have a wife that will support you through this and honestly my friend that is invaluable. Don't lose that.
Thats what she said lol
Agreed. I definitely see it running up to ER, especially with all the Black Friday news reports. 

ER...oof. It’s a coin flip. It usually dumps. And since it will have run up huge the expectations will be there. But if the call is good they may provide some assurance that things are turning around. 

The bear case IMO is:
- bad ER call that spooks people & they dump

- massive institutional ownership who will be rebalancing next month for year end. It’s gone up so much that Fidelity, Blackrock etc will be dumping millions of shares just to rebalance their ETFs. Shorts will have no problem covering. 

- old school CEO & board don’t listen to Cohen, stick to the “vaccine is close/retail will bounce back” mentality & he bails to focus on something else

Will Meade after seeing Tyson vs Jones:

Huge call sweep DKNG 120c 12/04 for $2 million
That's where things get fuzzy for me.

I think the outstanding shares are the total number of shares; but some shares can't move. A significant amount are probably stuck in stuff like [10b5-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp) rules and other vesting contracts that prevent them from being sold until a specific date that may be months or even years away.
Yeah, they just started letting users pay using it. It’s usually pops whenever shitcoin pops, but i find that SQ usually does better.
Let's play chess
If that was a draw Biden 'won'.
add a 0 to your shares and you good fam
I know how a short squeeze works. I just don't think it's exactly applicable in this case. I mean I've seen companies where 60-70% shorting activity literally battered the stock down to all time lows. If everyone is hoping that papa Cohen has enough influence with the board of directors to initiate a share buy back and kill the shorts, that's a bit of a long shot.

How you gonna quit when you got 9 freakin thousand left to lose? And an average rate of return of 14 percent a YEAR is some small dick energy
Like playing Baccarat having a draw pays out bigly 8x
Fake news, go look at most or the earnings call, you'll always see chinese writings in the company names. You just listed a few. Although, there are tons on wallstreet.
Yeah but tards now saw how easy it is to use the app. The fight was legit basically a promo to get people back into sports betting for draft kings lol. Shits perfect
Tyson is a weird fucking dude but gotta love him
Calling a draw for a clear victor in a fight that can be bet on should result in refunds.
Yup I did
Mods confirmed gay.
It’s gonna be fine. Cases don’t equal death
Hey can I remind everyone here, that if you haven’t sell your stocks, the amount is not yours yet. It is still with the company, PLTR in this case.

That shares still have a lot of dependency, if anyone is willing to buy from you, if the stock price is not going to drop, etc.

So please be aware that ‘The stock that hasn’t been sold is not your money yet’
Pltr, Ironically.  I woke up after earnings, saw it went from 14+ to 13.5 and decided to dump my spare cash in it for shits and giggles.
As long as you’ve learned your lesson, and change your behavior going forward, then it’s worth it.  Expensive tuition, yes, but you should recover assuming you focus the same energy on your work and just get a few promotions or two down the road.

I also lost a few hundred thousand a few years ago.  Wasn’t 95%, but close to half of my retirement savings at the time.  It drastically altered the way I approach option investing and my account is now much higher than where I was before throwing money at options.

You’re still young.  You can make it all back and more, as long as you change your behavior.  Remember this feeling, the next time you want to yolo into options - stop yourself unless you want to feel like this again.  Be better, you know you can.  We believe you can.
Yea there are a few dumpster fires. well I say a few....

people psyched about PLTR tells me the stock is fucked or will trade sideways. It has a market cap of 48 billion with negative revenue.

Remember Rocket when it crashed? it still turns a profit with a PE ratio of 3.
what's your cost basis
This is the most bullish thing for DKNG they get to keep all the money lmfaoo

They were def putting on a fight just for show, but there were a few moments where Mike forgot he was supposed to be holding back 
I was laughing my ass off
Not to brag, but ive literally never lost a game since I first picked up chess at age 6
Shiet was rigged, no way that Mike couldn’t beat Roy’s azz, I guess they made a deal to call it a draw, and give money to charity and their pockets! There is no way some1 bet on draw for this fight!
He’s a humanitarian now, though.

Nah I mean about not going for performance xD. I know I won't regret my M3 purchase, I just feel like I'll be missing out on some of that power for not going with performance
Tyson was ready to run it back again meanwhile Jones Jr was asking his family. lmao this draw

This is such a hilarious scam, glad i streamed this shit for free and didnt bet on this. Once i saw the scorecard in the sixth round and that one judge was scoring it so lopsided i could see it coming.

Even the way theyre interviewing these guys at the end looks fake. Honestly going to make draftkings look bad for sponsoring this shit.
Tyson’s goat impression before the fight made that whole thing worth it.  🐐
Tyson could have killed him if he wanted to
I like PYPL, didn’t realize they were that big into it. Thanks for the info
Nah everyone I’ve heard says Tesla model 3 is the best car they’ve owned so I’m not worried
More publicity perhaps? Controversy drives views.
This whole “if PLTR hits $40 I’ll...” is so cringe. This isn’t the next TSLA folks
\#2 is partially incorrect. Yes, it is true that they are audited by PwC in China, but that is not the issue. The issue is whether PwC is willing to undergo PCAOB inspections/audits, which they are not. This is an excerpt from BABA's annual report:

*PricewaterhouseCoopers, our auditor, is required under U.S. law to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, our auditor and its audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.* 

The issue is because the PCAOB cannot inspect the work of PwC China.
VFF too I like that hydro
Mike Tyson = PLTR

Roy Jones = CITRON 

Some people still think it’s a tie smh.
why would gme drop after earnings? they are gonna forecast a high breakout 4Q earnings profit. this is a no brainer hence price action run-up toward earnings.  unless stores burn down it is only going up next week likely to 20 dollars+
Ah for like a higher premium?
This is the way up

You're selling calling without knowing how it works? Also yes you get everything current-40 but they get everything over 40. You always keep premium it's already in your account as buying power. However since you haven't closed the contract it's not shown as positive. However as they slowly expire their worth diminishes and you keep the difference if you wish to close them.

Wtf, imagine betting on that fight and they called it a draw
I think that was the point
You can’t buy it directly, but you could get gbtc which is a shitcoin trust. I wouldn’t recommend it though since they charge a large premium. Also, there are no options.

If you want exposure to it, try SQ, PYPL, or MSTR, who all have large investments in it. Alternatively, you could try MARA or RIOT which are mining companies.
Well why aren’t my puts printing??🤬🤬🤬🤬
Duh.
Yeah the PLTR hype needs to die down so we can focus on all the other gold mines laying around
I can’t wait to hear DKNG earnings calls with all the “surprising” profit they made this quarter.
This is the way.

Call me retarded, but according to your link, the shorts only make up about 60-70% of the outstanding shares? I mean that's a significant amount, but they haven't shorted more shares than the actual common shares available.

That should be your signal to GTFO if they put their remaining cash into buying back stock instead of fixing a broken business. 

The fact that Cohen had to publicly publish that letter because the directors aren’t listening to him is a giant red flag. 

Could they turn it around & build a profitable business? Maybe. 

But they need to do a lot more work than just getting employees to use Surfaces behind the counter.

> $30-$40 based on technicals alone. $100-1000 if it squeezes. Also, revenue for the console cycle won’t reflect on December’s earnings, it’ll reflect in March’s earnings. This is at least a 3-5 month hold. But the upside is enormous if it squeezes.

Is it the same situation as with VW, though?  Are these institutional investors so stupid that they'll have to buy shares at $100 for a company that's clearly not worth as much?  Aren't console earnings already priced-in at $16?

Scion has been long on it for a few years, but I'm curious whether or not they've liquidated their position by now.  Any idea what Burry's target for GME is?

ACB really is garbage lol. APHA is a real company lol
GME only has to beat an EPS of -0.85

If they still can't beat that, I'm calling bullshit because even Nordstrom is back in positive EPS with their Q3 earnings (they had slightly more negative EPS than GME did through Q2) as well as a lot of other retail, even Party City. More people are shopping online because they can't spend their money on vacations instead

There's also more to it than just beating estimates. Regardless of whether it's good or bad, it all really depends on whether GME gives a good guidance. There's also the Cohen thing to address. They can also reveal they used up its remaining share buyback authorization in Q3 (they have \~$101 million left over), but this one is not likely since it seems they used up their extra cash to pay off most of their 2021 bonds early first
It’s 100% cucked if anyone has done it, and likely unenforceable.

The response was to counter the incorrect statement about Palantir making money.

Regarding Netflix, they have their own challenges. I am a subscriber, but not an investor. Their biggest challenge is creating content. It is very expensive to create content, but relatively cheap to distribute it once it is created.

Palantir has a similar problem. They have a software platform that can easily be distributed. However, it is very expensive to acquire a customer (i.e. write custom code to ingest data). Then their developers need to maintain or modify that code in the future.

The stock went up because of hype and some people don't fully understand their product, and will likely go up in the near future for the same reasons. They hear government contracts, big data, and all of these keywords, but it is not a scaleable product. Palantir is trying to modularize their product so that they only sell parts of their software instead of the entire platform, but this is going to be messy and difficult to maintain. Imagine if you had hundreds of software developers supporting thousands of customers, each with their own custom code to ingest data and custom modules of Palantir's software. Nightmare.

Only way this goes south is if the GM deal gets announced before the Dec 3rd deadline. I'm thinking that even if the deal deadline gets extended by a few months, this thing will drop 50% easily and hover around 15-20 range in anticipation of a potential deal.

Add on the fact that GM really doesnt need to rush the deal as they can easily renegotiate better terms and should actually appreciate NKLA's stock price tanking. Furthermore, Trevor is free to sell 91 million shares on Tuesday so whether or not he pulls the trigger will determine NKLA's fate.

People are buying and selling shorts all of the time though. Those short numbers are as of a certain date. The average price per shorted share has gone down as the price went down, and as the price went up the average price per shorted share went up. I just meant that a lot of people who bought at 14 probably covered when the stock dropped to 11, and then new people bought new shorts as it was going up.

Mods solution to low quality comment was to make the entire thread low quality
Mods are banning people and asking for help in reporting those that purposely dodge the filters.... like you just did
“Get outta there Roy! Get outta there!! Sheeeeiiitt!”  

Snoop has BIG money on Jones. It’s hilariously obvious.
That's coward talk.  Only reason to buy shares is if a security doesn't offer options, you're too poor to sell to open a single put contract, or you want to sell to open calls.

WSB has been talking about a GME short squeeze since at least a year ago. The fact that people keep on saying the squeeze would come in the next month/week/day/hour and turned out wrong naturally makes me skeptical of this play.

wrong sub??? This is the boxing general thread
I did some napkin math watching the price spikes and volume traded, and right now it looks like 1mil share volume moves the price by about $0.50.  I expect that to get bigger as the squeeze happens since it seems reasonable that it would be based on % of share price, but assuming that it doesn't and that 60mil of the 66mil short shares are forced to cover then that's +$30/share.

That would put the share price at a $46, conservatively.  Just under $50 is a reasonable target simply because a lot of people will probably start taking profits there, but it's hard to predict.  We have no real way of knowing how many of the outstanding shorts will be forced to cover, or when whales will take profits.
Thanks bro!
Permanently lock all gambling accounts and do what it takes to make sure this never happens again. With a good paying Bay Area job and friends and wife you’ll have a good future. The number seems high but this is far from life-ruining.
Worked in over 7 restaurants from high school to college, managed one myself in college. Started as a bust boy and worked from waiter all the way up to cook and manager. To this day I still don’t believe in use of waiters. Many places don’t have waiters and they work great. Don’t play dumb about people exposing themselves to food. Food comes out of the kitchen and ready for pick-up at the front counter. The Black Walnut is a great example of a restaurant with no waiters or waitresses, no need for them losers.
I think we will all know when to sell.

Bro don’t be mad, be glad. She showed you who she really is so you could escape dirt cheap and share none of your tendies. Don’t tell her about any of them. Send her packing in peace. A girl like that isn’t worth any tears, unless they are tears of joy you get to move forward in life with some worth your time now she’s done wasting it. When you are a PLTR millionaire and she’s still not doing anything with her life you will be so very glad you don’t have to share half of those with her. If she simply lied and hid who she really was you could have gotten screwed into marrying her and then she puts the screws to you. That’s how most guys end up. You got so very fortunate this happened way before it got expensive.

Their logistical efficiency program is being used to tackle the greatest logistical problem of the modern era. 

Getting a vaccine into 350 million American bodies within the same 4 month period in order to give enough immunity against covid to remove its ability to spread. 

If successful, they will become the backbone of every manufacturing and logistical company on the planet. Amazon sends their delivery trucks out at 20%-30% capacity. If they have the option to optimize and use full vans that would reduce their delivery costs by 70%.

Think about that. 
That would apply to FedEx, UPS, Sealand, DHL, USPS, Hasbro, Walmart, Krogers, Costco, Military etc. 
Everyone in the business of moving items from A - B.

Does that sound like a $30 stock?
How about their other programs as well?

They're not in the business of collecting data like Google, Facebook or Amazon. 

They answer the question, "What can that data tell you about the future you haven't thought about asking yet?"

Everyone better long the fuck out of this stock. 
In the future, no big company will be able to operate without their technology. 

It's more valuable than Amazon or Tesla. 
Both Bezos and Musk will NEED Palantir to manage their logistics and efficiency. If they don't, they will get their assholes blown out by the competition. 

They are just starting to enter into the commercial world.

\*US deaths increase by 1\*

Cause of death: Tyson-20
makes sense
Definitely learned a lesson. Cautiously optimistic for next week.
A Call is the right to *buy*, but a Put is the right to *sell*. So if you have a Microsoft put with a strike price of $210, you have the right to sell 100 Microsoft shares at $210 each. If the actual market value of Microsoft is $205, then that gives you a guaranteed profit of $5 per share when you exercise the put.
I might make this it's own post, but the tl;dr is that there are more shares shorted than thr compant even has so no it may take a week for them to all pile out as fast as they can.

And it's only voluntary for the first ones to get out. After that the one's that are left aren't selling because the chose to necessarily, their broker is selling their shares foe them because their accounts have been wiped out and they're margin called.
The bot deleted my last comment because it was "low quality?"

In a twist these are both the same person with two accounts
Big call positions open in january. Up 40% in the last month. Still has room for year end growth per usual for the industry, Elon hunting for nickel miners, and premiums are stupid cheap. A January call breaks even at +7% stock price when the stocks been up 40% in a month.

Hell yea dude, fuck her. Take a good chunk of cash out now, leave her ass, and then get back into the market when you're no where near her.
Sold some pltr 40c’s when they were 350 each for 12/4. If pltr doesn’t hit 40 by then I keep the entire credit, and when it does (lets be honest) I just have to sell my shares for 40 right?

I was waiting for this day lol
OP is on the right track but he forgot the most important part of the lipid vector. NO BULLSHIT. The real reason why mRNA vaccines have a vastly superior edge for this virus because of the lipid vector is because of this:

1) most of the competitors are using an adenovirus, a couple of companies are using a simian (chimp) adenovirus. These are typically great methods of transport, \*but\* all studies show antibody levels last for about 3 months. This means we will require repeated vaccinations in a short period. Adenoviruses aren't foreign to the immune system. Repeated injections mean that there is a high likelihood that our bodies will recognize the vector and destroy it after several doses before it delivers the payload. This renders the vaccine useless unless the vector is constantly changed to a different adenovirus which costs $$$. The simian is more foreign so it might last a bit longer, but ultimately they will both fail since we likely will need revaccination so frequently.

2) lipid vectors are simply fat surrounding the payload (mRNA) they get readily absorbed and the chance your body will recognize it and destroy it is virtually nil since fat almost exclusively \*not\* considered foreign.

[https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GME)

Those figures don't get updated all that often, but I think the % used usually is "percent of public float", which according to my link is about 139%.  It used to be 144% so it has come down some, but if you look a the chart you can probably tell when those shorts covered.

I imagine the public float number is used because there are shares that are locked up and can't be traded by insiders.

This is the first time I've played a short squeeze, but I've read that above 40% is high, so this is extremely high even if you used your 70% number.

Dude, you were just 10k from losing 420k.  Such a loss!  Maybe just 10k more to try a 42x comeback?!
Who cares if you jumped 3 tax brackets. You take home what one pharmacist makes in a year in 15 minutes.
Pretty over extended on daily, but could make big moves if $75 is printed. Retracement more likely in my opinion but who really knows anyways 🤷🏻‍♂️
Tyson is retard strength embodied, he is all of us on this sub
Brave of you to go against the full force of WSB downvote
Mike could hold his own even at 53.
Lmao Tesla is far from the most advanced player in the FSD game. Hell, even Super Cruise is better than Autopilot right now. Chauffeur and Guardian from Toyota will also undoubtedly be impressive, and Waymo will also be worth watching.
Is your girlfriend hot tho? If she’s hot you might re-consider leaving her and talk to her more about it.
I think it's the 19th but can't find where I pulled that number from
I still don’t really get what a put is. Why would you want the option to buy MSFT at 210.00 if you think it’s gonna drop to 205.00? Doesn’t make sense to me 🤔
Lol this fuckin retard literally catches his girl in the act of fucking her boyfriends, and is gonna use the little he has saved up to visit a casino

If he isn’t the poster child of this sub then I don’t know what else could be
he’s still got it omg what a legend
I’ll be back after palantir god damn. Don’t care if I miss gains. I wanna watch it crash just so you people will shut up.
Yo wait does mike have a chairman mao tattoo?

bought 140 shares back when it was 2.37.

Sold 40 of it when it hit $5, was a nice boost, kept the other 100.  Wish i would had went in on a full 1000shares instead of throwing pocket change at it

Been a nicer boost though

They did their direct offer at 100mil shares at $4 and it spiked pretty quick right after.  So it will dip on the next offering but dont expect them to do additional offerings below $5.  That's probably a pretty secure base right now for them

Ayyy i just bought myself a model 3 too with my TSLA teddies. 👍👍
but.. wouldn’t that have happened a long time ago? I have no doubt that the only way people lose a lot of big money while “investing “ is 95% down to playing the lucrative game of options.
Wait how do you know how high i am right now. And if im third i want what the first two are on.
Mike gonna take that ear off if Roy keeps locking him up and using his head.
mike tyson lookin worried .......that he might kill his opponent

Fighting your emotions and not panic selling when your bet goes upside down patience really
If it’s up fifty percent on Monday, I will yolo into whatever stock you guys pick
I’m the same way. I have zero drive, no motivation. On weekends I usually go out with close friends and have a good time. since the gym closed I’ve only left my home a couple times besides work. 

It generally just puts me in a positive mood, keeps me on point and leads my life in a positive trajectory. Without that checkpoint I’m lost.

It’s sad to admit but my life literally revolves around it and I need it to be optimal.
Your step dad was having a 🌈🐻 phase... 🎵 that is why your mother, did this, that, and the other, with some younger brother who was fly. Riddle me this, if a bear takes a shit in the woooods! Would a bull fall astray, and turn right-fully gay, rather holding the line cuz the shorts ain’t got time, until GME Squeeezes, we’ll leave them in pieces, soon we’ll be feasting upon their demise! W-S-B, is 2 times as trusty, and citron lemons make gay pie. Palantir turkeys and tendy beef jerky, herpa dee derpa dee, bye. Retard united
Said the paper hands
All of these factors are why I believe this squeeze is a total pipe dream. 

Nobody actually gives a shit if GameStop lives or dies. As soon as the cocksucker doubles overnight, everyone will sell because they don't want to baghold some dogshit second-hand video game retailer.

I also believe that they have intentionally misled investors about the nature and character of their revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft. Microsoft doesn't do anything for free, so the idea that they would slice off some of their margin for no apparent reason is extraordinarily suspect.

The real winner? Michael Buffer.

I keep thinking of maybe trying a couple options from reading WSB too damn much but everytime I consider a stock people are talking about and look at options availiable they don't seem worth it at all.

Like people are talking about GME, a GME 12/11 20C is trading for a $1.40 right now. So I'm betting $140 a contract it hits $20 so I don't lose it all, and $21.40 to break even and if it hits $22.40 a share, which is a bit more than $6 in what like 2 weeks, it makes $100. 8 shares would cost like $130 and make $48 if the price went up $6, or make $0 if it doesn't move instead of -$140.
First sentence is text book definition of FOMO
You guys let me know when it actually is stripe.
Wow Its more cost effective to just kill the bitch then, interesting?

NIO and PLTR are the only 2 stocks you should own.

Mike Tyson’s 1000yard stare is scary as shit. And fuck you automod if you delete this
I've been involved in so many stocks where people claimed a squeeze was coming because so many shares were shorted.  And then the stock went down... not up.

I'll take a chance on GME's short interest but not PLTR.
Hahaha I forgot Mike has tattoos of Che and Mao Zedong 😂😂😂
