I think you misunderstood what I meant by athleticism. Anyone can become leaner, lift heavier, put on muscle but some peoples genetic potential is more limited than others. No matter how much you train you will never be as fast Usain Bolt or as big as Arnold. Your limited be your genetics. And statistically speaking 50% of people are below average and at a disadvantage from a genetic standpoint. You can become the best version of yourself and still not compare to someone with better genetics who does nothing.

Depends on what we‚Äôre talking about and why. The short answer is yes. The longer answer is yes and no. And the long answer is physical beauty, depends on what. Generally yeah, but sometimes the face can‚Äôt be fixed with diet and exercise alone. Surgery can help some. Personality is not easy but can really make up for other areas. There is definitely a curve though with physical beauty where if you fall into a certain area you won‚Äôt attract a certain % of the population no matter what.

The personality matters myth has some grounded reality in that if you‚Äôre not bad looking but are a genuinely amazing person then you‚Äôll likely rise above whatever beauty points you can‚Äôt make up are. And some people are extremely attracted to certain personalities. I‚Äôm very sapiosexual myself. Intelligent women are a huge turn on for me. It can completely transform the way I view her even physically (in a positive way)
You can always improve your appearance by having good hygiene, better haircut, fix your diet, exercise, etc. but when it comes to your facial structure, height, athleticism you either won or lost in the womb

Pretty sure what‚Äôs coming is UBI. My argument for anyone who wants to argue we aren‚Äôt already socialist is I challenge them to go start an airline, automobile or bank. It‚Äôs not unfortunate that we tax the rich more along with corporations. They should‚Äôve been paying their share this entire time. It‚Äôs bullshit to say you can‚Äôt pay taxes and decent wages and then do neither. 
My wild guess at what happens next is 12.5m or so jobs are never coming back that‚Äôs the new baseline and will only grow larger as AI and Robots get better. UBI is coming sooner than later and these corporations who have been to big to fail will happily pay the UBI tax bill to cement their businesses as monopolies forever. That UBI tax will come right back to Amazon through purchases anyways. The 1% separated themselves forever during this lockdown. Killed any smaller competition there was and are richer than ever. The stimulus money should‚Äôve went entirely to citizen in a capitalist economy not corporations. Small business owners could‚Äôve survived and the economy would‚Äôve decided which corporations survived.  Blows my mind how they are trying to make shutdowns happen again when they already wiped out the majority of small businesses and the ones that are left are barley making it. They fucked everything up with handling this virus and now we have to lose jobs, businesses, livelihood and money. Really shocking to me how many people are going along with it and accepting being told you can‚Äôt go out past 10pm or have friends over or work anymore and also you still owe all your bills. I‚Äôm lucky to have not been financially stressed many of my friends weren‚Äôt.

I'm bearish on SPY - at least for the next month. I have SPXS calls for december and january - most of them for january. However, I'm not betting on a crash, I'm betting on a minor correction down.

If SPY moves down 5% in a week, SPXS will move up 15% and my calls will go up even more. I don't need the market to crash, but a little downward volatility will be fine for me. Then if it settles off, I'll wait for a reversal and get SPXL calls. 

But these people who want a blow off top or a 1/3 crash in the market are just insane. They're pigs.

There is no good evidence for ultrasounds causing cancer. If there was, then pregnant women wouldn't be getting them like they do everywhere. The amount of time the US is on at any one scan is extremely unlikely to lead to any issues related to temperature.

Diagnosis of things like pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade is far easier than relying on your ears in a likely noisy environment.
You can hear heart murmurs with a stethoscope but you can't quantify the severity of the lesion with your ears - you can grade it out of 6 in a subjective manner but ultimately you're getting an ultrasound to assess the issue in detail.

The only reasons it wouldn't replace a stethoscope:
1. cost
2. required training to interpret

Part of the reason is that the Department of Education is an executive office, not a congressional one.  This is why Trump could suspend loan interest and payments until December 31st.

Shitty comparison. Nuclear tech hasn‚Äôt evolved that much in 10 years. Small safe reactors had known benefits even 15 years ago. If they were truly financially advantageous you‚Äôd see more of them, but guess what? The static costs of a nuke plant are prohibitive so developers naturally go for scale. The UK reactors are getting half a billion pounds in subsidies to buy material from RR. 

Remindme! 500 days 

Ttyl in 1.5 years we can revisit
so true, let the dip come
Carvana offered me 13.5k, Vroom offered me 14k.

It really is that easy. It is a little sketchy as I had to send my title off before I received the check and I called customer service daily as I was a nervous nelly but it did all work out. Fun fact, I actually talked to the same CSR every time I called; they somehow routed me to her and she was somehow available every time I called.

The worst part was the freight hauler couldn't get down my subdivision so I had to meet him in a local parking lot. Yep, that was the worst part. He was very very nice.

I bought the car for 16k new in '18. MSRP of ~20k.
I sold to vroom for 14k with 22k miles on it. In the middle of a pandemic I thought that was pretty good for not having to deal with craigslisters, test drives, etc.

It's a seller's market and carvana & vroom are now offering 15k for similar cars as mine. 

I don't quite align with the business model of carvana/vroom as I'm more of a haggle with salespeople kind of guy vs pay a premium for easy service kind of guy, but carvana/vroom are like a better CarMax and I can see how consumers would want that.

We actually broke out of our range these past two weeks. From September to Early November we were range bound between 320 and 350. So long as we stay above 350, the more likely we start to rally higher
Imo forgiving student debt increases the wealth gap allot more than leaving it be. Not between the 1% and 99% but the 20% and 80%. Those who felt they were already in a good enough position or who were just plain reckless enough to strap themselves to that debt get to retain a significantly higher value in the workforce at no cost. Reasonable poor folks who decided not to take on 80k in debt when theyre already living paycheck to paycheck sit by with nothing but resentment

Verification and an emphasis on eliminating spam accounts. Interesting because gov has been talking about limiting big tech to curb fake news/censorship (ironic imo) and it‚Äôs arguably unconstitutional to put any limits on fb twtr etc which would impact speech. Therefore, unless fb etc implements their own changes (which they‚Äôve been resistant to) fake news will continue to be a problem, and parler solves that problem from what I know.

yesÔºåit will be launched next year, but the specs are mostly available online, also if you just looked at the specs it is superior than Tesla‚Äôs fsd chip launched last year. Another point is Mobileeye is now an intel company, so I would assume the development is seem less, Tesla relies on Samsung to make their chip don‚Äôt know what kind of impact it will have. It‚Äôs like apple‚Äôs system, apple might not have the best technical specs but the sub unit inside that system works much more efficiently because everything is designed around let‚Äôs say the M1 chip. So we might see Tesla facing the biggest challenge they have seen for far next year. The China EV Trio though, they are just not competing in the same level, I don‚Äôt know how they can catch up on Tesla or even legacy auto makers such as VW group whether it is scaled production, R&D or cost management.

Time to move on. The IV on FCEL got incredibly high. FCEL hit a high of 5.99 or 6 on Thursday and instantly sold down to 5, but it looked somewhat stable in the 5.50 area. The buying on PLUG was looking exhausted Friday imo.

The easiest gains are past imo. The market has actually been fairly decent at stopping bubbles from become too retarded. Megacap tech hit highs on Sept 2nd and hasn't been back there since. Solar was on a ridiculous tear in Sept/Oct but also calmed down into somewhat more normal trading patterns.

I think PLUG is probably the best of the hydrogen companies and I can see it continuing to go up, but not mooning constantly. FCEL is a wildcard lmao.

Get a better job
I agree. Only thing with the student debt forgiveness is that it wont get passed because of "moral dilemma". That's the excuse they will claim. And if it somehow does get passed everyone will pay for it through unessesary tax or inflation just because they can brand that as an excuse. But the funny part is they can print 6 trillion to hand out stupid 1200 checks and eliminate retarded debt for companies like Ford and Boeing that should be allowed to fail.  Not to mention the backing of financial assets through spv's which should be illegal. 

A more realistic approach to the wealth divide is unfortunately tax increases for the rich. We are at a point now where if the top percent earners arent taxed more we will face a lot of problems common in third world countries. 

I hate it but it is what it is. And with automation wiping out jobs, it's not looking good for the blue collar working class. This is just purely the financial aspect of it but when you get deep into conspiracy theories and the "great reset" it truly is frightening
All in on 50% otm calls
Super interesting. 18% of profit spent on commissions is also interesting. I might need to ramp up my put selling. I wonder what the return is from selling daily straddles instead.

I think the idea is that routine ultrasounds can cause issues. Repeated tissue heating can cause cancers and other problems, as far as i understand.

The other guy made good points about this being much lower power but I'm still skeptical. Why replace a cheap passive system with a less cheap active system? Even if the risk is reduced active systems add complications.

I'm sure there are many uses for the tech, but to say it's replacing the stethoscope seems out there.

‚ÄúIn March 2019, Tesla sued Cao Guangzhi, a former Tesla employee, accusing him of stealing its Autopilot source code and bringing them to Xpeng. Cao denied claims of intellectual property theft, but admitted to uploading Tesla's source code to his iCloud account prior to leaving Tesla while he was still working for Tesla.[15][17] In response to Tesla's accusations, Xpeng launched an internal investigation and said it ‚Äúwas not aware of any alleged misconduct by Mr. Cao.‚Äù.[15] In April 2020, Tesla made new filings in its lawsuit.[18]‚Äù

It's a microcap with very small quarterly revenues (1 million range). They did an equity raise back in June for $10 mil, so they have cash. The key will be execution. They need to land contracts for their charging stations. If that happens, they can drive down costs (economies of scale) and increase gross margins by raising prices on their units, which are currently being sold at 20% margins in an effort to introduce them into the market. Blink & Switchback are also in their markets.

True. I worked at a production plant as a supervisor for a couple of years and there was a few guys that had worked there for 30+ years. I was making around $30 an hour. Two of those guys started as forklift drivers making TWENTY FIVE and hour 30 years ago. There‚Äôs very few people who can live a middle class life (house, car, family, one vacation a year, food and weekend entertainment) without going in debt.

SF is all a dream for the Jones. its overrated and youll find out everyone there is miserable. unless they inherited their house, and get the cheap city discount, and they can live a life without being stressed out paying bills. The locals dont tell that to the tourists who move in. You pay a different price from them. But you need to prove your family has extensive history living in the Bay with papers to get that hometown discount.

Ive met so many young successful couples who make so much money but are chasing the city lifestyle and they end up not handling the work:life balance.

I don't think this de-escalates anytime soon. Market may have to react to this increased uncertainty about the near term.

Replaces the stethoscope? My god WSB is definitely retarded. Dont listen to ppl who have no medical background or idea

It‚Äôs a portable ultrasound that connects to your smartphone. It has nothing to do with replacing a stethoscope. This shit is NOT going to replace any ultrasound machines at the hospital. If you are in need of an ultrasound then you should have one in your unit already - in the ED or ICU unit

And this shit is not new tech. It has been around for years. Is it a game changer? The answer is NO. I know a handful of cucks at a hospital who walk around with a butterfly in their pocket and all the other docs at work laugh at them. What‚Äôs the point? You are never going to need an emergency ultrasound ‚Äúright this moment STAT - get the butterfly!‚Äù bc if you do, you walk around the corner and grab the portable ultrasound machine on wheels.

2 ways AFAIK:
1: Some brokers from your country will have a partnership with US brokers so you need to open an account with them
2. Some US brokers (not robinhood) will allow you to open an account with them.

but the brokerages will be higher and there'll be a limit on the amount of cash in usd you can trade per year (250,000$) in my country

They're under half of what they were pre-crash. Unless you think they're going to go bankrupt, this is priced in
It‚Äôs 1.5T worth of debt. Do you know how minuscule that is in the grand scheme of our government spending? The only reason it hasn‚Äôt been erased yet is because a large portion of those in debt are struggling through life and still paying. Minimum wage hasn‚Äôt moved since 2009 but they‚Äôve expect students to pay 2-7% interest on that debt is absurd. Not to mention housing has gone up 4.2% on average per year and food 3.9%. Wealth divide is already long gone and it‚Äôs coming to a final point soon imo. You can‚Äôt strap two generations with debt, increase the cost of living 40% and eating 39% while paying the same wage throughout. I‚Äôm not for ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù but we are socialist economy for the top 1% and get out and earn it economy for everyone else. We‚Äôve done bailouts not once but twice now in my 30 years of living. Neither of them helped anyone that wasn‚Äôt in the 1%. Things will get real chaotic if some wealth distribution doesn‚Äôt start flowing back into the other 99% of America soon.

Market cap is 1B and that is much higher than some of the SPACs out there. Appears that some of the funds are behaving like retail--buy at low and dump it when the merger is announced/ticker is changed. They're not in for the long term. I am actually eyeing FEAC for some time. Missed buying at 12ish. Not sure why people would buy this instead of Palantir which is more famous on reddit. Of course, Skillz is growing faster but that does not guarantee that the market is wiling to reward them for it. Regardless, I will start a small position and add on dips.

But I don‚Äôt have confidence in my ability to get lucky many times and I know I won‚Äôt get rich by taking small profits repeatedly.

One more fun fact, the US ran a $280 Billion Deficit in October - an absolutely astounding number.  Against the October revenue, we spent 30% on Interest expense.  As debt levels expand, the Interest expense as a percentage of revenue will only rise.  This is why rates will never rise - because if they do, eventually we will spend half of our revenue on interest.  We have to 'pretend' this debt will eventually be repaid. Inflation to the moon.

The student debt crisis is a bubble waiting to pop. It was already coming and now with the pandemic causing students to reconsider 40k a year for zoom university, its inevitable. This will be an issue for decades to come. The worst part is, it only contributes to the increasing wealth divide.

Once you get up on your option sell another one for the same expiry farther out of the money to lock in a portion of your profits without selling your position. If it drops you keep some of the money on the option you sold and if it rises you continue to make the difference in the delta of the contract you sold and the one you currently own.
To me that just means you're not really confident in the plays you're making and you're being smart and taking profits before potentially losing money. I've been on both sides, I've taken profits too early only to see the position become way more profitable as well as getting greedy and seeing profits slip away into nothing and trust me you'd much rather take profits early.

But that being said, when you're confident in a position you should let it ride.

Interesting. Thanks for your thoughts. Definitely not worth jumping in any time in the near future, but I really think the potential may be there.

I still wonder if there‚Äôs any merit in playing GM in the somewhat more ‚Äòmedium‚Äô term (ie the 2023 window). I still really believe that the EV companies barring Tesla will get massively squeezed out, even if it‚Äôs sub-par quality. Either way, that‚Äôs still something probably not worth touching until at least another year or so.
Any thoughts on CREE? Thinking about picking up some March calls.
U dont pay taxes until u sell it though right? So just some of ur proceeds go to taxes. And it will be long term capital gains if he‚Äôs been holding TSLA for that long so who gives a shit.

No one goes broke taking profits. 

That being said, one thing you can do is put larger stakes into your plays so you can ease out of them to your comfort level instead of it being a binary event. Upside is not as great BUT you can still get some thrills without getting totally blown out.
Just curious what happens with all that debt then? Not looking like it‚Äôs going to get paid anytime soon and at the rates they lended (way higher than what they lend money to apple at) its going to strap an entire generation for their lifetime. Hard to get the economy ever going again when you‚Äôve got 12.5m unemployed and 44.2m strapped with debt. Genuinely curious as to what you think happens not trying to troll. Imo it either gets forgiven or paid for through the eventual UBI that‚Äôs coming.
Boomers easily have 6-7 figures into mutual funds and blue chips. WSB teenagers have like $40 in their Robinhood accounts.

First, by definition, the long call has to be ITM to be specifically a PMCC and the short call is OTM. You can most certainly do any combination of functions but for a PMCC specifically be constructed this way.

IV crush can hurt you any time that IV of the call is less than when you bought it. It does not have to be some ridiculous shift and actually can erode over time which is a real threat with LEAPS if the stock loses momentum or public interest. Of course the inverse is also true; if you buy early then this works in your favor, but regardless, this is not a vega neutral strategy. 

The fact that you had to sell further out when IV dropped is my point. It is not a guaranteed consistent function; in long shares you do not have to worry about this, it does not impact your bottom line, it does not adjust your cashflows and it most certainly puts you at no greater risk nor does it lend itself to the complexities of how these things actually work.

Can anyone help me with some advice? I have a problem with taking profits to early. The last few trades I‚Äôve made I‚Äôve opened them planning on staying in for a longer period of time. But when I see profits I get scared of losing it and close the position. Only to watch it become more and more profitable. It‚Äôs incredibly painful to exit a position to early and watch potential profits slip away. But even after seemingly learning this lesson I still continue to do it. Taking small profits on positions that would‚Äôve been huge gains if I‚Äôd only held for a few more days. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone I know or family about this without sounding like a douche. This is a serious question. I need help.

Also you're only taking in the idea that only America generates revenue  for Orladeyo - your 200M as a peak is not even close period.  200M could  be a restrictive and a conservative estimation for America only sales  but this is not getting approval in only America.  Also I say conservative because this medication means people don't need to inject oneself for a medication anymore!  This is huge for patient access, on  avg across the world/regions you will find 30-50% of people have adverse  reactions to needles.  This means up to 30-50% of the HAE patients of  the world only use the current medications as an emergency rescue  measure along with hospitalization (ER's). You're also assuming there's no PE above 1 ever possible to this stock after the HAE approval which  is absurd to believe it will remain at 1.

Listen you degenerates.  If any of you remember my drunken $500 bet on Indiana +21 against Ohio State today, I won and pressed the winnings onto Oklahoma -7 and it looks like they are gonna cover as well and I will be sitting on $1,700.  

  
Next bet:  $1,000 on Atlanta money line +170 over New Orleans Saints.  Win: $2,700.

They should ban you for even asking this question.
Then explain a meme stock that shoots up and drops a short time after. I would assume most people would buy in thinking it would keep going up so they‚Äôd keep purchasing it which would prevent a crash because of FOMO

You aren't weighting the entire strategy. You've weighted the cost part but not the profitability or asset risk part. For instance long shares have no greeks so value is consistently 1:1 meanwhile even a deeply in the money absolute bottom tier LEAP is always has some lesser value than 1:1 and has greek risk attached.

The PMCC is a good strategy to build capital but it is also not inherently cheaper just because it cost less to immediately implement.

As much as I know many stand to benefit from this, I seriously doubt it happens.

No way in hell they figure this problem out in his 1st term. The only way I see something resembling forgiveness is in the form of ‚Äúhere is 5k stimulus,‚Äù pitched to lawmakers as a means to spin up younger American spending, which has (according to a few reports I have read) historically seen more saving.

Yeah, I don't deny this, but here's the problem: Trump didn't want to pass that stimulus because he wanted to help you or the American people. He wanted to send another check signed Donald J. Trump so that the American people would vote for him.

Pelosi, also a politician, is not stupid. So what did you think she would do? Dems kept the stimulus bar too high for the more fiscally conservative republicans, but it was really because no one wanted to hand Trump a win right before the election.

Now we'll have to wait until spring and then we'll get a much lighter bill, too.

I made a post like this in /r/options back in September explaining why I thought we wouldn't get stimulus and I was laughed off as an angsty teen.

Feels good to be right now, though.

Hmm.. on the surface when you buy in a market, the bid-ask median should be shifted higher. Option volume is probably a bigger deal on expiration days
I‚Äôm in Texas and only ever lose money in the stock market how should I feel about this
You got it opposite. Bright red blood is good. Black is bad.
I know right? You don‚Äôt have to say *US* dollars. People will always assume you‚Äôre talking about big boy money.

It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre European or anything else you have to make the distinction so people know you‚Äôre only talking about toy-money.

There are many reasons, but probably at the top is T shareholders expect fat dividends. Content expansion is expensive and their peers like NFLX and AMZN don‚Äôt make much money.
That being said ive had quite a few times where if I had held id bank but you gotta weigh risk to reward
Both. Gotta do what you gotta do.
I also think AMD would definitely be a good candidate. I want to be more hype on Microsoft, but they‚Äôre already almost at 1.6 trillion dollar market cap, and I just can‚Äôt do it without some major catalyst coming in the next few months. They‚Äôve been yo-yoing for the past 6 plus months as well. I‚Äôd wait on them.
GameStop 01/15/21 30c all in
F is several years out still. Probably why people think they are behind the curve. They are the opposite of GM in that they are engineering for 2030, not 2023 ish. They don‚Äôt care about ev sales rn because they know they can‚Äôt compete rn with some half ass product like GM and the volt. They are instead developing to introduce something really good when evs get bigger. GM is on 5 yr old battery tech at this point. Probably why they thought they needed NKLA both for image and tech

Fact that ford bought the old train station in Detroit and is turning it into the ev and autonomous vehicle headquarters says a lot
too. Meanwhile GM has ev engineers stuck in cubicles in the GM building downtown.

I have no plan to invest in F for years but long term they are my bet

Yeah I plan too. I‚Äôve been thinking about buying leaps 1-2 years out and hope they announce it by then. I have some shares but they go up and down pretty regularly with no real catalyst right now.

Theta is why hitting the strike at expiration is worthless. Everything has decayed and the option has no value. Why buy an option to purchase stock at the price you can get on the market?

You have $5000. Your goal is to make 1 million by the end of next year. What are your plays.
How many shares?
Won‚Äôt happen. Console developers are now eating into profits of game developers and publishers (which Sony and Microsoft get a cut of sales from). From standpoint of Sony or Microsoft, they would rather keep devs and publishers happy than trying to make money from GME. Also, whoever does it first would be at a huge disadvantage. For example, if Sony started allowing re-sale of digital games - you would see developers shift resources and interest to Microsoft only titles (and vise versa). That‚Äôs how you lose the console wars
Of course it‚Äôs Florida. This country is royally fucked.
The stock might not move at all when someone buys if the prior transaction was already hitting the same ask price. 

Depends on the number of shares beings offered and your order size (and order type) as to whether the stock price will move based on your transaction. On highly liquid stocks with a lot of volume your transaction will have no impact. 

On low volume stocks (and low volume options) whales can move the price significantly

Soon we‚Äôll be able to trade from just thinking about it. Back in the day, you‚Äôd have to call a broker to execute your trades. It was that or you had to walk in with a suit to Fidelity and tell them you want a buy two shares of Microsoft. Lol
Why isn't HBO following suit then?
This is the best sub on the internet.

Also. SPXS calls for january and december. I don't think we'll crash, but I think if we get a good dip (maybe 5%-10%) I'll have myself a nice little Christmas present.
And bankruptcy.
You retards will never believe me but it‚Äôs Ford. In all my research I‚Äôve never seen a company like them. That being said, they don‚Äôt play the marketing game well. They are as old-school as old-school gets. Wouldnt take free money on the auto bailout. No desire within the company to be cool or appear to follow trends. They fucken own a million acres of commercial property around Detroit. No exaggeration, one million. Crazy assets. Not worth playing options but as safe a long-term stonk as you can find.

Since you're here, my guess is that you're young and otherwise healthy.

Most likely an anal fissure after a particularly firm BM. Does it hurt when you shit? Is the blood mainly on the toilet paper, but not mixed into your turds?

Pick up some Restoralax, and have every shit you take over the next month be peanut butter or toothpaste consistency. That'll let your asshole heal up right nice.

Bro this is 2020.  I buy on my phone, watch instantly at the 30% gains and then I watch them go down diamond handing it until it‚Äôs 10%.
If you buy stock at 1.00 from someone selling for 1.00 the price of the stock is 1.00 until someone else buys from somebody for < 1.00 OR >1.00
Same. I don't even have holdings I just think SQ is awesome.

Yeah especially now. Just finance at 2% or whatever and dump the cash in spy and take your 8-10% guaranteed. Even after taxes you‚Äôre still turning a profit. Add some leaps into the mix there and you‚Äôre well in the green statistically speaking
I think the outcomes are binary. If the bears don‚Äôt win, that will print. The only way to keep the market afloat is to keep going hard.

Advice: Don‚Äôt say it next time, also make comments on how poorly women are treated, buy a book on women rights just for the show. Keep it ‚Äúhidden‚Äù somewhere you know she‚Äùll find it, put the bookmarker towards the end, read a summary just to be sure.

Anal fissure or hemorrhoids probably.  If the blood ever comes out coagulated or black get your butt to a doctor ASAP.
If ur serious that‚Äôs actually a big problem. Not as bad as if it was black dried blood but still nothing to fuck with. Defo something to go to urgent care to get checked out

I like running covered calls on stocks I don't care about at all. That way if I get run over, I can justify it with the logic that I wouldn't have bought them unless I wanted to wheel them (and maybe let them go).

AMRN is my current fav. Sure, they could put out good news and I'll randomly get fucked, but I would never even care about them otherwise.
me wanting to Long ROPE and it don't even have to do w the market
comment what stock has made you the most money
[Kelly criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion) is a formula for bet sizing that leads almost surely to higher wealth compared to any other strategy in the long run. For any probability p of an event occuring, bet at most:

fraction of portfolio to bet = 2 x p - 1

This means even if you feel it cannot go tits up, you should still only bet a maximum of 50% of your portfolio to maximize your likelihood of increasing wealth.
Give it another try, the beginning is kinda slow but oh boy does shit get wild!
I could get behind oil the commodity but not the drillers. I live in Texas and worked the oil fields here, in Canada, Saudi and Africa. Current rig count is 310 compared to 802 this time last year. Storage in west Texas is full to the brim and already not expected to be burnt up until 2023. With more shutdowns coming and the popularity in EV booming I don‚Äôt think oil companies every return to their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Oil was already dying this just sped the process way up.

We'll have low "inflation" in CPI absolutely. Assets are soaring though, as long as it's not commercial RE. From the POV of a poor or a rich, there won't be much inflation, but if you're middle class, the 'inflation' you're going to experience will be hellish.

I don‚Äôt know if HBO is considered hyper valuable, it‚Äôs owned by T which trades at a pretty humble valuation. But they have more mindshare, nobody is cord cutting via showtime.
Difference is, the people who are investing for a 12% yearly gain have several mil in the market, so they net hundreds of thousands. Then there‚Äôs us, trying to turn 10k into 100k and usually failing

Yeah that is the other side of the coin. Personally, I would be willing to take on a little more mental stress to maintain a mil or so in liquidity but if you‚Äôre worth hundreds of millions, the value proposition changes. At that point tho, you probably have a firm managing your assets who are paid to stress over pennies and squeeze the most return out of your bankroll.

Personal preference ultimately, just depends on how much you value the mental space it takes to run the numbers and manage payments.

I live in Detroit and no one here really believes GM is long term competitive with Ford in this sector. GM had sacrificed long term innovation to be first. Ford is really trying to work on groundbreaking stuff, their electric vehicles division is actually made of good engineers unimpinged by bean counters. Mary Barras GM is too corporate and too focused on cost cutting. FCA is asleep at the wheel and just stroking profits from 10 year old vehicle designs while they can. We will miss them.

Edit: source: family in the industry. None of them want to work for GM or FCA. One works for Ford, very competitive to get into.
I just realized something. Summer was ‚Äúhot‚Äù for bulls. Then came fall and there was a drastic ‚Äúfall‚Äù in profit for most people here.  Now winter is about to arrive. Does the ominous ‚Äúwinter is coming‚Äù hold true and our portfolios will be devastated by the white walkers? And by spring, we will ‚Äúspring to action‚Äù once again. Holy shit I think we are trading according to the seasons. No need to thank me for my amazing DD.

I finally had a good week, straight stock (SBE) - finished up 7% overall (small holding on SBE)

Trump desperately wanted to pass a stimulus bill before the election because he knew it would help his chances to get re-elected. Pelosi isn't an idiot and knew this too. She had got him to go from 500 billion all the way up to over 2 trillion. The only way such a huge bill would get any GOP support was with Trump bullying them. Now he doesn't give a crap since he lost and he's more concerned on throwing a tantrum. She used us as leverage and political pawns to her partisan games and now we will be lucky is we see anything south of 500 billion. The GOP will never judge without someone pushing them.

Checking this post for swing trading NVAX. 

About NVAX 
1. What are phase 1, 2 results? 
2. Phase 3 results timeline is early 2021 (Jan/Feb)?

Vaccine to public
No matter what, increased cases going to push FDA for fast approval for Pfizer/Moderna approval.by Christmas. Both already signed deals and way to produce 21 million doses. If FDA approved, first priority will be given to frontline, sick folks then general public hence by june or july it will be considered for public.  By then NVAX shiuld have solid results from phase 3 if successful. Their tie up with Indian gian largest in the world vaccine maker Syrum institute, would be ready to make billion doses. 

So, my stance is, take position in NVAX in 2-3 months.

I agree the downside would be its much slower but I think a lot of those little 2-4 hour flights get replaced with driverless taxis. It will be a lot cheaper too. I meant due to AI less people will be working, therefore flying less. I believe business passengers make up like 60% of airline revenue if I remember correctly (don‚Äôt kill me if I‚Äôm wrong). Still going to need cross country and international flights just a lot less of them imo. Might be wrong though!
Are you even a chemist? Cause acetic anhydride is a (*very* cheap) super generic chemical used in the production of a lot of pharmaceuticals, even aspirin.

The concern with this quote of his is that on one hand it shows that XPENGs tech is a step behind, but on the other hand it gives it legitimacy because it's TESLAs old tech. That means it's not some chinese quality software in the car's brain, it's tried and tested. Some people may think that it's 'good enough' and then all that matters is sales. 

There's plenty of room for everyone in China, and if XPENG undercuts TESLA on pricing while it's working to steal the next source code version..I mean, it's not a big problem being a year behind on software on cars if you can churn out cheap models subsidized by the Chinese gov. It'll be like getting a 2019 TESLA in 2021 but for half the price won't it? (in layman's terms)

Yeah I don't know the specifics of the billing, I briefly looked into it during residency when I did an independent elective in POCUS and thought I wouldn't be able to make it work. If I got good enough to rule out DVTs that would probably be enough to pay for it assuming I can get reimbursed... hospital system might not be as happy with me though since they might not get their higher billing with a formal u/s study.

I had 2020 and 2021 2.5 calls at a cost basis of around 2.5 per, shares were about $4 when I bought it. I had a few thousand enph shares with a cost basis all below $5 a share. I have had to sell it all to afford to live my life and do what I want to do. I sold the 2021 calls when shares were about $37. I sold many shares around the same time. First share purchase was when enph was $1.42. If you go deep enough in my post history you will see I was trying to sell enph to everyone years ago.

These are my only two open positions
No no no no no no no. The world is vastly and infinitely better with the internet, just not in its current form. The golden years of the web was between 1995 to 2000, where information was readily available and there was no censorship. You could literally find out anything you wanted to know and there wasn‚Äôt a bias-bent like there is today. Before the advent of google, we were in a new frontier, and the the internet was as open and free as our own galaxy. But now information is suppressed at every turn, and you are only given the search results that the puppet masters want you to see.
No people have to starve if you remove profit and the myth of scarcity. J/s it would be easy to end poverty and hunger under a new more evolved paradigm/system that properly shared the earths resources with all of humanity. The only thing keeping us from that reality is the belief in the current reality...

Another strategy, though often less profitable up front is the calendar verticle spread. I usually sell the weekly call high enough that I make 150% of my bet if I get assigned (or 101% of the total cost if I bought a strangle).

Idk who spotgamma is but that answers my question essentially if you‚Äôre inferring it yourself or have a good source to read.
You write calls when you have the stock. Puts when you have cash. I'm assuming you'll have less cash after purchasing stock though. That's just why I was confused. 

Good call though. I think being theta gang is a lot less stressful
I mentioned the three million in debt before. Don‚Äôt believe I mentioned being a millionaire before though.

Yep because we all know hitlers life was so long and cool. Lmao
No....just....no. 

So much of this post is wrong. You do not have to be ITM to use this strategy. I've been selling $14 & $15 C weeklies on a 3/21 VALE $13 call I've owned for a few months. It does not need to be in the money.

Furthermore, IV crush only hurts if you bough at the height of the IV. If weekly IV goes up you profit more. Again, on that $13 VALE call I'd been selling weeklies at $14-$15 for $1 - $7 depending on IV. 

When IV dropped a few weeks back I had to sell further out, but then opened up a second spread when price & IV dropped further, and then started selling weeklies again when it went back up.
Gotcha, with these plays i feel like we are pretty much gambling, so might as well go for that high reward high risk, hence im only gonna throw like a thousand or two. Might do less with CLNE then, thanks bud.
How can you you find all that? You have that FBI ‚Äúenhance photo‚Äù software?
Played with them a bunch at EMSWorld last year, they have a ton of reasonable protocols that can be implemented into practice. Easy to use, relatively durable with an EMS specific case. Now, both of us playing it have 15years of experience with both field and ER, so already had decent US knowledge, but would be easy to teach.  Yes, we're god awful underpaid, but I think most medics would love to have a confirmation device for traumas, solid organ damage, intra-abdomenal bleeding, pneumos, difficult IV access and more. 

On a stock level, I'm not drooling over this. The Butterfly IQ was cool to play with, but really doesn't make sense when not everyone uses the same personal smartphone. So now we'd have to buy a good smartphone to go with every said US, so it ends up being closer in price to implement several other dedicated EMS specific US devices. There was like 4 different company products to play with last year, would expect even more this year.

it went down bc daddy xi was big mad at jackie for complaining about regulations and stopped an ipo of a baba subsidiary (ant group) I think ppl realized that this was a performative move and a short term roadblock rather than something that would inhibit long term growth. and now that the baba bus is rolling, it ain't stopping

1 call reserves 100 of your shares. Since you have 150 shares, you could only have 1 call and then you'd have 100 of your shares covering that call and 50 free. If you bought 50 more shares, you could sell another call.

And yes, generally covered call is a good idea. The only issue is of course theoretically limitless "losses" (which I see more like unrealized gains). Imagine FUV shoots the fuck up to 100 or more. You'd be selling your 100 shares for 20 each at some point on or before expiration. You have no control over it UNLESS you bought out of your call, which would cost (100 - 20 + whatever option premium remained if there was any) x 100.

TLDR; It‚Äôs new technology that complements the stethoscope. Doctors and vets like it. The revenue model is a subscription, meaning a constant flow of $$$.

If you actually CNTL + F "PLTR" it's only been mentioned twice in the last 20 minutes or so.
Basically, yeah. I guess it will come down to the side you fall on. If you're worse off because of the rapid advancements in tech (lose your job to robots, forced sterilization, genetically targeted with diseases, etc.) it'll suck. If you're on the other side, where the advances in tech work for you and keep your competition ("the great unwashed") at bay, it'll seem great.

How difficult was that?
Pelosi, Lacqua or Lagarda?
Market cap is how much the company is actually worth in total. Share price is just some varying percentage of that total. 

XPEV share price just went above NIO but NIO still has a higher market cap so the company is worth more.
For me it was a car company that never made a car. And the market cap was the same as Ford. Yes I was losing money holding shares of Ford. Still Salty.

Yes, using your shares for one call and your remaining calls for the others checks out. 

You‚Äôd do this to lower your cost basis and reduce your overall max loss. The trade off is you cap your max gains.

This is what I love about wsb. One minute I‚Äôm explaining what IV is to a college freshman who just yolo‚Äôd his student loans on far OTM weeklies, the next I‚Äôm getting first hand DD from a trauma surgeon.

Fuck so many tasty IPOs out here.
I‚Äôm not sure about covered calls but do I have this right?

I have 8 FUV 7.5c 1/21 (up 626%) And 150 shares.  At the moment the cost of 20c 12/18 are 3.45.  If I sell 9x 20c 12/18 I‚Äôd get a premium of about 3k for a month expiration and if it goes way past I also get the sell of my contracts at the 20 strike?
So the biggest issue is if it crashes but I still collect premium.   Any reason not to do this unless I believe it‚Äôs gonna rise way past 20 by january?
Check out e-bay, lots of first gen probes there for half the cost

the annual subscription is pricy, but much of that easily countered tax wright offs, and the probe requires a data plan and or wifi, so that‚Äôs a business expense now as well . check with your tax professional

> only US who had an issue with huawei and it‚Äôs was because of trump

Actually most of the western world, due to the high potential for espionage and backdoor from a state-run Chinese communication company. The risk is less from western countries companies since they aren't state run and even if backdoors are in place they're owned by allies.
Did it guys. I hit the bunny slopes for the first time. This is the way.

Not all people are bad. A lot of them are but evil has not yet completely overtaken the world. Evil has become the easy way out for most people and it is a successful strategy for the weak who cannot fight any other way than behind schemes, but there are still some people out there who are worth fighting for. Do yourself a favor, forget about the numerous amounts of petty people in this world for they only serve to make life more challenging so focus on avoiding them and finding people who can give your life meaning. In a way our lives are our relationships with other people and while it‚Äôs a shame most people only look for people to use there are still some wise enough to be aware of this truth that they still find people they can love instead of bringing ruination on themselves by giving a damn about the ones who don‚Äôt give a damn about them.

I‚Äôve actually been going through tickers this weekend. For my shares I‚Äôll probably buy DRIV. They should kick out Intel and Cisco and pick up some hot EVs. For my LEAPS I‚Äôm going with FSR.

That way if any of these unproven cars/companies blow up my account doesn‚Äôt go with them. We will need the charging stations, batteries, cables etc. no matter what.

Careful guys, this fucker is thinking fast and deep!
Two years ago, I had appendicitis while living/working in Belgium. I‚Äôm covered by Cigna International, so no worries. The entire bill ($6K,fully covered) for ER, surgery (it had ruptured), and three days hospitalization was less than the deductible for stateside coverage on the same plan. If this had happened stateside with the same insurance, I‚Äôd have paid the $6K out of pocket and the total bill would‚Äôve been north of $40K. 

Lambos and all other fast depreciating assets are overrated. Freedom is priceless. A good BJ is pretty nice, though.
Volatility spikes are not good for option sellers when holding a position.    Option Buyers should Buy options when volatility is low and options sellers like to sell when volatility is high.   Buy low, sell high (option Buyers).   Sell high, Buy back low (theta gang)

Yea I‚Äôm sure within our lifetimes we‚Äôll experience virtual reality that‚Äôs nearly indistinguishable from real life. But just imagine life where there‚Äôs really nothing to do, yea we‚Äôll be going around exploring figuring out what the universe is and how time works etc. 

But most humans will have no purpose, they‚Äôll be able to do anything they want, but what if you‚Äôre born into a world where you never have to worry about anything, every medical illness (physical/mental) will have remedies.  It sounds great, but humans have evolved over 100s thousands of years living in the real world, our brains are hardwired for life on earth. 

It just seems like a very serious problem we‚Äôre gonna have one day. We build AI using quantum computing with advanced machine learning algorithms and we write the code saying something like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hurt us please, let us be happy‚Äù, and the AI does exactly that. It fixes everything and then we become obsolete basically, that causes severe mental illness and we start killing our selves or some crazy shit you see in the movies. So the AI follows the code it‚Äôs programmed to and determines the only solution is to replace parts of the human brain that are causing the issue with artificial ones. And then we‚Äôre not humans anymore, we‚Äôll look the same and everything, just that part of the brain (our soul or conscience whatever you call it) won‚Äôt be there anymore.  And that‚Äôs it basically.

The CDC came out with a study that said the virus mortality rate is .2% which is way lower then what the WHO or what dr Fauci predicted of 2-3% originally.


On top of that the .2% is contested to be inflated. Anyone who dies in a hospital is tested for covid, and if their corpse has covid they are added to the pool of covid deaths. Like if a motorcyclist dies in a crash and they find covid pathogens in his body he‚Äôs considered a covid related death.


This entire lockdown was pure hysteria and will go down in history as one of the greatest retard moments of our time
The threat has been exaggerated imo and the damage done by the lock downs will be detrimental in the long term to the economy.

i don't see how the pump would make sense, but its an emotional market. i didnt read shit, but its a covid treatment, so it only helps if youve already caught it, right? i dont see relieving the pressure of covid much, especially if it still requires a hospital bed and staff to administer it. it will be good to lower deaths more though!

A scenario of a US double dip recession without major fiscal intervention, stimulus and easing that will be a misfiring bazooka of a response at best not priced into markets at the moment. Q4 until Q2. Without two consecutive quarters of expansion, technically speaking it won't even be a classical double dip. 

The lack of congressional response in a second stimulus package is going to hurt and cost much more than this could have been. They've had 4 months to get something together with an economy that started recovering faster than projected due to immense fiscal support. And the lack of response will have economic consequences going into a bleak winter.

we're advancing so quickly, stuff is changing so rapidly, it's nearly impossible for the overwhelming majority of humanity to keep up. we're approaching a point where there will be a true breakaway civilization, we'll return to a modern version of Cro-Magnons versus Neanderthals.

Don't mention it.

Depending on your other risk factors, they might consider HCTZ 12.5mg as a first line choice. Amlodipine 5mg is something I've used first off, but only in very specific cases (typically in the elderly without a history of CHF, PVD, in the context of advanced renal failure and previous potassium abnormalities caused by HCTZ).

Amlodipine is an "acceptable" first line agent, but it's definitely not the best.
According to Wikipedia, it's unscheduled, and can only be synthesized in a lab. So... Probably coming soon to a plexiglass case behind the counter of a shady convenience store in a rough neighborhood near you!

Today I had an epiphany. Life is made up of a majority of jackals. Not wolves. The jackal is a craftier animal that scavenges anything they can find. Occasionally they will attack a weak animal in groups and packs. They are an opportunistic animal, just like the majority of humans. You see, most humans are weak, relying on others to get what they need. Humans operate in cliques and packs much like the jackal. They will stab you in the back whenever they get an opportunity and will hoard their resources so that no one can share in the spoils. They will try to keep you from advancing at every turn, and will despise you if you show greater strength.

See, again this is not for every physician - hence why the orthopod in this thread didn‚Äôt appreciate the utility of these devices.

Like I said before - for a hospitalist or an intensivist these are invaluable, esp in the unit.

People need to understand the role of POCUS and for anyone saying the stethoscope isn‚Äôt dead - the further through residency I got through residency the more you realize that most diagnosis and management of a majority of issues that people believe require a stethoscope to diagnosis can be done without one. The ones where it may benefit, can be done better with POCUS, aside from a PTX.

Not true. The state will no longer exist at that point. Once we switch to a resource based economy where the myth of scarcity no linger blinds the plebs from the truth that there is plenty for all of humanity. The state will be unnecessary. The purpose of the state is actually the opposite. It‚Äôs purpose is to protect and serve the corporate capitalist class.

true, things have been relatively good, people have seen a point to invest in something in the hopes it pays off for them, but I think those days are going to change in the U.S. (I hope it doesn't), but there is just something fundamentally broken in our MMT that I think is going to be the tipping point that motivates people to do things very destabilizing because they have nothing to lose. The boomers were truly the last generation that I think had genuine happiness without the aid of medication, or virtual/augmented reality. It's not enough anymore to be smart, educated (advanced degrees) and healthy, you need to be gifted, born wealthy, or just extremely lucky to afford a comfortable life free from indentured servitude forced by the need to take on debt just to afford basic necessities.
Yeah, I get that you think that you are playing with house money, but that is beyond stupid. This is your money now. Don‚Äôt throw it away like an idiot. You got stupid lucky and it took no talent. Don‚Äôt overestimate your abilities.

ACE-Is or ARBs are a much better medication than any calcium channel blocker. The cardiac and renal protection that they offer result in far better long term outcomes than amlodipine.

The ideal stock you are talking about had terribly low option prices. I've looked at T for example and selling covered calls wasn't going to make much happen. Now look at TSLA and the calls are a money maker. It's of course more risk, but it's easy to be long TSLA as it's treated holders very well.

Keep it to weeklies just to make sure you don't loose the bus.

Go on Amazon and buy a pullup bar, those ones that you can just put on your door no installation required. Search up ‚Äúiron gym pullup bar‚Äù

I went from doing 5 pullups in march to being able to do 30 now. Once you get over 15 pullups, add a backpack with heavy stuff. I look better than when I was weightlifting. How do u think all those prison dudes get ripped, just pushups and pullups

Look up youtube videos on calisthenics, and tutorials on different pullup positions and pushups, dips. Other things that are good is a dip bar, pushup handles, and ab roller. All those things are under 50$.

The irony is that if you're not taking in electrolytes, wether it's through food or fluid, you can easily dehydrate yourself by drinking large quantities of water.  You just piss and piss and piss and don't retain any of it.  I've been there.  It's not cool.  I did find, however, even a small snack can negate that.  I used to go 24-36hrs with nothing but water while I was "working" in the oil field.  Until I realized how much better I stayed hydrated with a bit of jerky or really any-fucking-thing.

Yes but that doesn‚Äôt change he‚Äôs a registered republican and in federalist society.  I‚Äôm sure he was just viewed as a good, level headed judge. 

If you want to see real court packing, look up Sen Sheldon Whitehouses 30 minute presentation during the Amy Barrett hearings. It‚Äôs on YouTube. He breaks down how the Trump judges are being hand picked by outside special interest groups. Sheldon was a former prosecutor, so he did his homework and it‚Äôs a very detailed explanation. 

That‚Äôs the corruption right there. And you can tell by Amy‚Äôs facial reactions during his presentation she knows it‚Äôs true.

SPACs are more equitable for retail than IPOs. Bill Ackmans SPAC is a revolution in equitable investing, as it loads most of the warrants onto those that actually hold the underlying company, instead of those that just ponied up the capital until acquisition.
If nobody is buying it that‚Äôs better? ENPH is a great play for the next decade. If he‚Äôs going the options route I was going to recommend buying 2022 LEAPS and average into them once a week.

Enph will not make $16 billion dollars worth of parts- enphase market cap is reflective of the creditworthiness of the company as it needs that line of credit to create the number of micro inverters necessary for the amount of solar panels we will be using. Also look at competing companies solar edge (inferior product) and kulicke and soffa (klic) which manufactures the microinverters we were using before sedg and enph. Klic is a good (cheap) investment currently

They develop solutions they do not develop software.

There is a difference between developing something like apache spark and using it to setup etl pipelines or models.

If the core of what you present is open source you have nothing proprietary implementations are not protected material.

It may seem like im splitting hairs but I want to emphasize they are not a tech company they are a services/ solutions company that is selling itself under a false label when you look at the industry it actually works in its a consulting firm at best.
You know how parents say, kids have to make mistakes and hurt themselves to learn not to do it again?

Really?
It's an SPAC so never count them out after they pump for a day. SBE has been pumping for weeks, KCAC weeks, etc. As of late, many SPAC's have actually gotten hammered post-merger, though. Each one is a separate case of course, though BFLY will not enter until 2021 so it still has tons of room to rip if you want to hold it and dump it before the merger to play it safe. LGVW is only trading at $12.5 right now which really isn't up much considering most acquisition tickers hover around 9.75-10 before any news. I can't tell you what BFLY will be at in 12 months, but I can tell you i'm extremely confident LGVW has TONS of room to run and I think $22+ PRIOR to the merger will happen easily
Now we are talking!

The hydro homies are wrong.  If you drink a lot you shouldn‚Äôt just water, you need electrolytes too. So drink Powerade zero or water + potassium, sodium and magnesium.  I had a friend in college who got super wasted.  The next day she was severely dehydrated and every time she drank water she would throw it up.  Thats because she didn‚Äôt have enough electrolytes.  My friend quotes idiocracy every time I drink Powerade zero, but that‚Äôs what it good for.

They would license their software to OEMs and operate on a SaaS model. The end user, car owner, would likely not see this and software costs would be built into the sticker price of the car. This could change as over the air updates become more regular in newer cars though.

Well let‚Äôs take it one by one, do you think old white men in suits should decide what women do with their bodies? No of course not. Do you believe GOD should be in our government, even if you don‚Äôt believe in a Christian God. Of course not, you can practice all the religion you want anywhere you want, but it shouldn‚Äôt be forced on us by government. Do you want a world with more guns or less. Less of course, we should definitely move that way. Do you trust Americans with loaded guns, but not a joint? Of course you should have the freedom to smoke a joint in the privacy of your own home. Do you think police are too quick to use deadly force? Of course. Do you think we need more stimulus? Of course you do, the economy was shut down by governments, so the people should be compensated for this. More stimulus until we get a vaccine. Do you believe USA should have immigration pathways to citizenship,...OF COURSE, Otherwise we wouldn‚Äôt be here. These are all common sense points the world is moving forward with.

Are they tho? They still have the best selling cars at this point. The Bronco was sold out instantly. But I think it would be the scale at which they can produce. Spitting out hundred thousand cars onto market. It'll let Aapl become an auto leader overnight.

Plus, Tesla actually looks ugly.
lol dont think you're smarter than everyone else. i can almost guarantee you that you're not going to make that much money if any at all doing this. Eventually you're gonna get wiped. The only reason why you're getting any premium on SPY is because of the volatility. What if SPY goes flat all of sudden then you can't sell OTM premiums anymore because it will not worth it so it's unreliable. Since you're trying to time SPY trades why not just buy puts and calls since the volatility is there? You're gonna get reamed with the bid/ask spreads on spreads and high volume contract commissions will add up. You haven't figured out anything new that no one else is doing so you're not going to profit from this. I could go on and on about this...

Well boys, i think doing the inverse of what people think will print tendies. That being said whats something entirely autistic?? B t c going to 25k by eow. For that reason alone i have went all into riot calls. Last 5k ish. 197 of them. Wish me luck
To be fair, I have AMZN calls that got super profitable and then tanked like this, and I even had a limit sell price and they never sold while I was busy working. So that "profit" came and left before I could even think of selling.
I‚Äôm thinking about some leaps too, just waiting to see if there is gonna be a drop.
Very.
Free calls for everyone
$45k was my number and I hit it. Student loans covered within a year of finishing undergrad, without touching inheritance (and being able to have a good down payment as a result). I'd love to hit $100k for the cushion and wealth growth but it's not going to happen again this year (diamond hands turned to paper hands too late in September). Zero debt is fine alone.

Existing federal law allows the secretary of education to decline to prosecute debts underwritten by her department.  Just as Trump was able to divert funds for a wall never authorized by Congress under the umbrella of natl security on discretionary pentagon appropriations, so to will Biden's secretary be able to waive debts with respect to various eligible federal student loans.  What goes around tends to come around and Trump/SCOTUS just spent the last 4 years pressing the gas pedal on executive/unitary authority.

tl/dr: take out max student loans and throw them at TSLA asap.

maybe some other things, I don‚Äôt work on scene.

They're selling out immediately but everyone is. Which is not great, but on the upside it means attach rate is going to be through the roof because they're basically ONLY selling consoles as big bundles.

Not airlines or cruises, they're saddled with debt and cant be considered healthy. Industrials would be my go to sector, followed by tech and financials. Tech has great value companies like SNX and EBIX (who rose 40% on that value rotation tease last monday).

About 75% of my portfolio is growth but I like to throw in some undervalued stocks as well. I often screen for pe <25, forward pe <20, peg <2, net profit margin >5%, and positive EPS growth next 5 years. Those are some of the best options. You'll find winners like DECK who are doing well in this climate and have miles to run.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm an alcoholic or my friends are just lame but we got fucked up last night and now I‚Äôm the only one drinking tonight cause they all feel like shit. It‚Äôs a fucking Saturday and we are in college like cmon. Either way puts on my liver.

Right, which really makes me have doubts about my own barstool idea.

Staying with your parents for college is a good way to save money, but if you're a guy you will have a hard time dating and having the social life most people your age will have. Up to you on how much that matters.

Not trying to get rich. Just trying to save up more for a house down payment down the road.
I jolted awake. I heard the talking first. I saw the yellowed drop ceiling, then the red-brown tiled floor. Slowly, steel appliances came into focus. Was that...fry oil I smelled?

Suddenly, the sound of a Karen ordering a four for four snapped me back to reality. I looked across the floor with horror to see my hand underneath the prep station - my wrist, only a bloodied stump.

The restaurant had been busy. It was the lunch rush during the annual Cuyahoga Valley accounting conference. I was chopping lettuce as fast as I could while watching TSLA moon on robinhood. The knife must have slipped while I was distracted.

TSLA! I panicked as a reached for my phone. I wiped blood off the screen and squinted through the pain...

+500% on my TSLA 500c! I panicked and went to hit the sell button only to smash my stump into the screen. FUCK! That had hurt, but the calls were sold. I could finally quit Wendy‚Äôs. Losing my hand was worth it.

This was a smart play, and you called it. The US and China economy appears to have a teeter totter effect. When one goes up the other goes down.

On Friday it looked like the area around $5.50 became a battleground. Might chill there for a bit. It tried to hit 6 on Thursday and got rejected hard, selling down to 5 within an hour. It's probably done going up 30% a day, but it seems okay.

Sounds good to me. Stay with parents as long as you can to save up money or until you just can't take it anymore. I regret not doing that when I got a job right out of college in the same city as my folks. 

You're young and probably have more saved up than most 18 year olds. Put some of that away in an emergency account (I know boomers blah blah blah), and then play the stock market if you want with the rest.

Or you know what fuck it spend it on hookers and blow. Seriously you're young as shit man enjoy life.

The real puts, were the friends you made along the way.
It's a defined risk strategy.  How would he be "fucked"?  Max loss is cost of long call minus premiums collected.  If you are calling a losing defined risk trade "fucked", what do you call a losing stock holding position or a naked contract that moves against you?

In my mind - you would be "fucked" if you are holding an undefined risk position and it runs away from you.  This is not that.

This doesn't have to do with stocks, but do you think you'll see these in the prehospital setting in the near future? We've talked about it in the past but the price point has always been its downfall. That and medics are underpaid and trying to convince them to add another skill is difficult without an increase in pay
Why even gamble the chance? You're talking $3 bucks.. just buy and hold. Everyone said the same about NIO when u got in at $15. "I'll wait for the dip". The same people are now texting me, "bro should I just buy NOW?!". Chances are you're buying a few hundred shares. Just buy and hold. I've made shit tons just doing that 1 sine strategy.

Local prices vary obviously. The actual service rates aren‚Äôt that much more than any other dealership, the parts are far more expensive though.

You just keep feeding her the same meat every day. If she accepts it then she loves you, then you start getting deeper and deeper into strange kinks trying to get that excitement you had the first time. It never really works, but its different.

And eventually youll be back into it, until the pattern repeats.

PMCC and stocks are my main strategy when I'm not gambling.

Be careful selling calls on memes. I usually stick to boring stocks I'm bullish on, WMT, JNJ, ABBV. But that juicy IV is so tempting.

For memes, sell above the big walls. I made out ok selling TSLA 525c and 505c for 11/27 but it was - real - close on the 505. At one point I was down $1000 on my 'easy' $200 PMCC. But MMs were not going to lose big on those 500c and kept the price low. Now I have sold a few 600c for next Friday. This is all against my 2022 leaps at 450 which are now ITM.

Your short call needs to be above your breakeven, not above your long strike.
You would need 1x LEAPS for each covered call you sell, otherwise you‚Äôre just selling naked calls.

I am wheeling 400x AAL shares in my Webull account and 1x PMCC in Robonhood. It comes out pretty close to effectively owning 495 shares and selling 5 covered calls. The premium adds up. It feels much nicer to be getting those $80/week in Webull to buy shares with than the $20 PMCC, but it‚Äôs still pretty nice overall to take that cash.

How's it going dude. Welcome back.
Here's why Vroom shit the bed. I was about to go in hard on calls a month ago, but thank god I did some DD.

VRM was positioned to moon massively, but made a catastrophic fuckup. When Covid first hit, their move was to significant reduce their inventories as a "hedge". Well.. used car demand fucking mooned and they missed the boat because they didn't have enough cars to sell. Used cars became very expensive to obtain once dealerships and the big boys realized what was going on.

Their ER was horrible and they basically crippled themselves for all of 2020 with that move and the market expects a shit ER in Q1 2021 as well. Huge potential imo and should moon at some point, but that mistake really set them back.
U posted it on social media or here? Cause if its the first one...
They've been going the opposite recently so you'll likely win on both or lose on both.

Grape flavored drink and hot pockets
Pfizer getting approved December 10th, buy calls that week and get free money
what's the catalyst
I do a similiar strategy.  The problem here is that you won't get the direction right every time, and the times you don't you are left with a situation where you do not want to close the spread or buy back the option at a loss.  So you hold too long to an option and watch it become worthless in your 2dte time frame.  

So I have moved on and I do mine 2 weeks away. If I am feeling very sure about about the move that it is but accidentally caught the top that day.   

I have also learned that I need to have a planned stop loss so I don't go full retard and watch worthless options expire.
I want to believe the markets open up bigly on Monday but my gut tells me it‚Äôs going to be a bloodbath so that all stocks go on discount on Black Friday.

I just put myself in that position intentionally. The worst that can happen is it stay flat. My long option will cover the difference plus some of it goes up. My short 100 shares will cover my losses on my entry point for the long option if the share price goes down more than $0.30

2. forgot what i googled but probably "how to buy leap options." Search results told me the best LEAPs to buy have a delta around .80 or are near the current price. So that is exactly what I did by buying the $100 option when the price was $90
Give it up you fucking wash up retard, go write an essay on why you think there‚Äôs voter fraud and how Trump actually won the election.

This guy is.  I remember watching coronavirus news as it spread across the world, and the market boomed completely ignoring it and thinking what the fuck.  Then, bam.  I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve listened to what Rudy and company have to say, but if there‚Äôs a speck of truth in there, what they‚Äôre saying is like, a really really big deal.  I couldn‚Äôt imagine the chaos that would ensue if they gained some legal traction and it looked like the election could be, or is overturned.  Markets don‚Äôt like uncertainty, frankly I‚Äôm dumbfounded that it‚Äôs all being basically completely ignored.  Craimer is concerned.  And me.  I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of Vix calls and/or SPY puts as well.   I‚Äôm just waiting on the bellwether, like that first significant sell off of 3% or more. That happens, I‚Äôm going 75% cash immediately, and buying vix calls.

Not necessarily true...our institution just committed to Butterfly purchasing both their device and the tablets to attach them to.  Their images are fully PACS integrated via a secured cloud client to upload the images to the patient's chart without ever storing anything on the device itself (they also utilized deintified images for some kind of AI they're working on, which is the future of medicine).  POCUS is also reimbursed...not well, but it is a billed service ([https://www.pocus101.com/complete-ultrasound-cpt-code-list-and-reimbursement-rates/](https://www.pocus101.com/complete-ultrasound-cpt-code-list-and-reimbursement-rates/)).

You think rescheduling is still unlikely? Even with a probable decriminalization or legalization under Biden? I‚Äôve been looking at IIPR for weed plays. Seems like a safe and possible lucrative way to go as far as weed goes.
The $5c was like $900 when I bought it, but like $750 of that is intrinsic value, so it is not a big deal. The $13c usually awards between $12-$25 premium, so enough for 1-2 shares a week. Won‚Äôt make you rich quickly, but it‚Äôs a dime bag to go on top of the LEAPS.

You can't. It's done automatically sometimes. That is why you should  close spreads before expiration yourself. I don't care if you have another 15-20% profit left to go. You do not want to wake up on a Monday morning shitting your pants due to margin call.

I have become financially and mentally ruined thanks to finding this sub.
Simply because your call has to be ITM. This means that with the shares no matter what the stock does you can always sell CCs meanwhile if your call falls OTM you can't sell against it because it isn't worth anything at all. On average, over time, unless you're basically delta 90+ on the ITM call you'll likely experience a point where it is actually OTM. 

Furthermore this strategy expires so the price is subject to non-fundamental elements such as IV so in an IV crush even if you do stay ITM you lose the leverage you would have had with shares because shares don't experience IV crush, i.e. when a stock goes up but the options go to shit.
What are you looking at? You certainly won‚Äôt be in danger

I'm sticking with the boys like NIO and Charge now. I think shit like SOLO could go down in flames. Even still, the IV on solo options is fucking absurd now and you'll get wrecked if you don't get huge movements in your favor.

I also think the market is a bit more cautious about this stuff than they were in the days of 2000. Back in the late summer solar calls printed constantly, but once valuations got high, they started behaving like other tech stocks and stopped being guaranteed tendies.

You jump from your computer chair and turn around. Someone must be dying.

Instead you see your wife, hands over her mouth, hiding laughter. Your one-year-old baby girl found crayons, and then she found a wall.

‚ÄúWell, stop her!‚Äù You lunge for her and rip the crayon from her meaty paw. ‚ÄúWhy would you do that!?‚Äù

Suddenly you‚Äôre aware of how loud you are. You look up from the red crayon in your hand and see your wife crying. Baby, confused by the moment, starts to cry, too. Your wife scoops her up and wordlessly retreats to the bedroom.

The RoseArt ‚ÄúRed‚Äù crumbles in your clenched fist. As you look at her art project, you start to cry also. There‚Äôs something familiar about the jagged but descending red line.

Your pocket begins to vibrate. Margin is calling.

You would be selling your time premium at that point. Ideally you want to avoid this to gain as much from upward movement as possible. When I'm about to get assigned on a covered call I will buy back the call I am short and roll up and out to a higher strike in the future. This can often be done at a credit.

Their timeline may be substantially shorter, but they need the pandemic to be over just like the rest of the hospitality sector to get back to over their cash burn rate.

APHA or CRON offer high risk high reward plays. If Biden reschedules marijuana it will make medical marijuana legal federally and legitimize the industry. Anything better than rescheduling and these stocks could10x. The issue is even rescheduling marijuana is unlikely.

Most people lose money in the markets at first. It‚Äôs called your tuition. Take a break and you‚Äôll come back wiser.
It wont be a ban like a reddit ban, youre going to have to buy positions you dont need to close the same day though. You should be fine selling the next day but dont play yourself buying weeklies with no way to dump it.
Bro how are you this dumb?  You wanna yolo tesla 12/31 690c but you dont know how taxes work????

You get taxed progressively.  Biden tax only applies on anything made over 400k.  So if you make 500k, only 100k of that is going to get Biden tax, the other 400k is taxed normally.  This is how tax brackets have always worked.
Gotta be reliable it‚Äôs a DD
Probably stick to these since I understand the products and do or plan on using/owning them. You notice the most profitable regular people here usually only trade in businesses they understand and stick to them for a while. e.g. The purple guys actually own the beds and intimately understand why people would buy them.
It's WSB, so all your options expire worthless anyway, so 0 tax.
How is end of COVID not a catalyst? Unless some data was hidden from public at least 1 vaccine, probably 2 will be going into people's arms and in mass production by next month.

So let me try to get this right. You started by buying two months out options. Then as the stock goes up, you roll up and further out. If stock goes down, you hold until it goes up. 

Can you explain what you meant by the last sentence " Basically the only strategy I used was to..."?. 

1. Can you clarify "roll out to an option 10% of current price"?
2. How do you google best strike price for LEAPS?

Thanks in advance!

What‚Äôs wsb getting
Im in med tech and they just got a shipment of these at the Mayo Clinic I work at in MN. This is going to be a huge medical breakthrough in my opinion, the cost/functionality in POC is what makes me think health care will adopt this tech as a norm like the stethoscope. They were running them off iPads and the system itself is powered separately, so basically the the iphone/android/ipad whatever you choose to use is simply for image through semiconductor chip. Its fascinating because I thought it would be poor quality but found it to be better than our GE Vivid which is a portable ultra sound that sells for around $30k I believe. The Butterfly is selling for $2k!!! This could be a really good long term play.

Serious question on Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), why isn‚Äôt this an obvious long-term play? I‚Äôm looking at 2022 or 2023 LEAPs, the company has:

‚Ä¢	High quality investment grade balance sheet

‚Ä¢	Very liquid, 2B in cash

‚Ä¢	Recovering faster than peers

‚Ä¢	No international exposure, domestic only, I would expect domestic to recover faster than international because you‚Äôll be quarantined for 2 weeks

‚Ä¢	Mgmt. believes there is significant pent up demand
No point averaging down on a stock you're not even sure will survive.

They have to become available.  Not exactly sure how it works, but RKT IPO for instance took some weeks to offer options.  And initially it was just monthlies, then they got weeklies eventually as well.  

People have to buy the stock first to be able to sell options against them so that might have something to do with it.

Cuts? Cuts? What cuts? Presidents don‚Äôt set budgets and they don‚Äôt initiate legislation. 

OP‚Äôs use of the word ‚Äúdespite‚Äù shows a lack of familiarity with history. Both military and social program spending will increase. The president can set policy and priorities. That means the military will spend more on social engineering and less on border defense. Defense contractors respond to RFPs and provide requested mat√©riel and services. They will also collect fat checks for canceled orders done in the name of ‚Äúmilitary spending cuts‚Äù. It costs a lot to save money.

Uh no, they don't. They fine tune a single device for a single purpose. I also work in the industry and do electrical engineering/circuit designs as a hobby. 

They just have the luxury of fine turning the hardware/software for a single purpose. No one else in the industry has that luxury. When something is built for a single purpose it's always better than something built for universal uses.

BABA & QQQ
Been in the option game long enough that I've pretty much ditched theta. Most of my bread and butter trades are now based on stat vol / price forecasts utilizing butterflies. They're good for short-vol after vol-spikes, isolating skew/convexity and have a very decent R:R on any price target.

Right now I'm heavily in some december NIO butterflies that will pay massively between 35 - 55. The R:R is something like 10:1

IMHO it's all about making small bets with outsized returns & predicting price / vol rather than following systemic theta-strategies.

Yeah that's the 409a price which companies keep low so that they can give stock grants to employees with a better cost basis. The most recent 409a price is $34.88 but the realistic company value is at least $30 billion (\~$50 per share) to $40 billion (\~$66.67 per share) before it starts trading.

Yup, 0DTEs and 2DTEs were insanely profitable right after the crash. But look at a several year timeframe before that. They were not very profitable. And it's dubious they will be that profitable going forward either.

We'll all have 180 year life spans, be riding around in 0 emissions autonomous vehicles, shit will instantly show up at our doors before we even knew we wanted or needed it,  benevolent robots will be doing most of the manual labor and the youth of the era will be recruited into exploration and settlement missions for space.

we're reaching the top of a major trendline that goes back years. it's not gonna be easy to break and will likely require a catalyst. as a bull I'm optimistic that we'll make it. if we repeatedly fail to break through then the probable outcome will be a major pullback.

When selling covered calls the assumption  is that you are long on the stock. You don't care if the stock drops in the short term because  you have done your own analysis and believe in the stock long term. Everytime you collect premium  you are effectively  lowering your cost basis to offset the short term dips. It also helps if the stock you are holding pays dividends. 


Normally if you buy calls you have to be correct that the stock will go up and it will go up enough.  With covered calls you profit if the stock trades sideways and if it goes up. It's  all about minimizing  risk. All that side fucking retards right
See you in the night thread
Boys lemme explain why DKNG is the cream that will rise to the top. First of all, states all across the US are legalizing online betting. 2 new states, Virginia and Michigan, will be allowed to be starting January. Perfect timing for the Super Bowl. Also know what else will be happening between January and March? Stimulus checks. You know what people who are addicted to gambling will do with those checks? Put in into Draftkings. Secondly, analysts across the board are raising their price targets as they realize how big of a market online gambling is. Jim Cramer is pumping it, taking a very bullish position. I mean look at us? We are basically betting sports teams, the sports teams are just companies. This market is huge and increasing exponentially. You know how many upper class white chads like watching sports and gambling with their degenerate friends? A metric fuck ton. 
Third, states will propose new meaures beginning the middle of 2021 that will introduce the idea of online betting. Increasing the market share. 

DKNG is the new ü§¥üèª

I've been advising caution for months on GME, while being about as bullish as it gets on the stock.

This is a legitimate strategy. The biggest downside is that you generally want to protect the LEAP until it's expiration to get the most value from it. Getting a LEAP called away costs a lot of time premium.
Afghanistan will continue, yes, as will most war things. But the Iran saber rattling will end. And the progressive wing aka a big chunk of liberals will still disapprove of more military spending and action, while all conservatives will continue wanting more military spending and call Biden weak for not bombing Iran‚Äôs generals

Correct on the buy, but I sold most of the position on Thursday when TSLA was $500+. Contracts were total of $50k for $40k profit.
you are in Europe
$500 max loss for each of them - that is if you close it early before expiration without letting your broker fuck you up the ass by exercising your short leg early. Those screenshots where you see a -$30k loss around here is how that happens btw.

This. Google "Poor man's covered call".

&#x200B;

The risks are exactly the same as a normal covered call but the rewards are significantly lower and if you're using RH I don't think you actually can do this very well.
Makes sense. To underscore that theory, where I live we have a saying, "sun's out, guns out"
Hope the EV run continues until Friday wait until 3pm and then put 10k in 0DTE OTM puts or ITM if there is a large sell off you will make a few hundred percent or more if not you lose it all. You will lose it all anyways so this will save you time.
its the thinking of pumping it after they get in cheaper, buy at IPO, then tell everyone about it so it pumps. If you tell people before IPO and word gets out, it could get hyped and at IPO it goes nuts before they can even get in.

Sorta. 

So if you had 10k in cash, you could buy 10k of stocks (if they had a 50% margin requirement), which would leave you 5k of cash buying power.

With the remaining 5k he could buy options.

But! If the value of his stocks drops at all, he's going to get hit with a margin call because he'll have no extra cash to satisfy the margin requirement.

Conversely if his stocks value increases, the actual amount of cash needed to secure the margin will go down a little, increasing his option buying power.

It's a lot harder than it looks.

If you started with 25k and only wanted to trade options, you could buy 25k worth of contracts, and no margin.
BUY HIGH, SELL LOW. RINSE AND REPEAT.

1/15/21 $5 calls were $0.8 to $1 in mid March. Current price $57. $1k then = $57,000 now. Although the highest they were during the September run-up was $74.5.
I don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre saying. If the stock price jumped $10 he would be looking at a net loss to close the short calls. The short calls would move up more in value than his long call. So it would be a net loss. Like I said, I explain it more fully in the comment on the top of the thread. I use dollar examples of loss and gain
I think it is a strong company in the futuristic sense. The decentralization of commercial real-estate is simply a real occurrence.

Too bad you live in California. Taxes are going to end up being around 50% once you factor in the extra 13.3% California charges on top of the 35% federal if you were doing options plays.

They needed to do this online only thing to beat other companies to the punch but they did not, now for physical there's walmart, target, best buy and plenty of other minor players and for digital there is steam, epic and all the other exclusive brand digital only stores.

The only way they can survive is by beating prices against all these stores while providing better service and I don't see that happening either, not to mention the gaming community mostly remembers GS for the predatory trade in business it had that made people happy to have alternatives to gamestop, I feel this company is dead and everyone but the ones tied to it have accepted it.

The butterfly isn't generally paid for by the hospital. If purchased, it'd be for personal use only and since most hospital systems are pretty resistant to putting images in a pts chart from an unsecured device (docs cell phone). They're pricey, unreimbursed, and difficult to bill for. They are super cool. 

Docs are trained for this, but special trained ultrasonographers are better at making the dx. When it's critical almost every doc will opt for a formal Sono. 

Really great product though.

You can make them look like mountain tops and steep valleys by buying options, although you may want to become a savvy stock investor that knows how to rotate before jumping into options. You can still make 1000%+ on stock within a few months if you time the market right.

I'm not sure, I'm retarded. I was just saying if they transition to mostly online sales and set up a legitimate e-commerce website where they sell stuff, couldn't they work with Microsoft (as they already have a deal) to literally play cloud games linked from their website with maybe a timer or some shit. Then kids go to the website and play a Halo Infinite demo and afterwards there's a huge clickable button that says "PURCHASE NOW FOR 5 PERCENT OFF" and then they run and tell their mommy to buy it.

I spent lots of time backtesting selling spreads at different deltas (including what you're suggesting) 45 days out on SPX and the results were abysmal.

You are better off just longing the SPX or selling puts naked.

The wing hedge on the spread costs too much because of the positive skew inherent in the SPX vol surface. Kills all your profits.

Gov takes away x% of your taxes per year because that‚Äôs how much it should cost each individual to pay for nation wide healthcare. 5 years later, prices increase. So gov says we‚Äôll now take away y% of taxes. This goes on year after year(price increases), much like military spending, necessary but Ill defined. This price keeps increasing despite the rapid increase of efficiency and technological advancements which is due to competitiveness in the capitalistic market. (Best non-government entity wins contracts). This is the best way to bleed power (which is money) away from people. (People‚Äôs right to use money how they see fit = power to who they see fit. misappropriation of those funds = power to whom its directed it to). If government takes control of the funds of the people it will be squandered to enriched whoever is in power of the lobbyists who put the policies in place. And whoever is enriched is empowered.

I mean, no doubt, I love hype. But the iron is already hot on this one. In this scenario, the hype is what *hurts* you as an options buyer now, becasue its sold to you at a premium. So when you turn around to sell it, you can only profit off of price change, assuming you get that right  and have the right timing.. Now, this thing can move, for sure. But any fall in hype will hurt you immensely as an option holder, and its already at what, an 8 or 9 out of 10?

So take those negatives (change in hype and time) out of the equation, man. Buy the stock on margin if you want leverage. The other factors are not in your favor.
Honestly dudes,  here is the easiest way to make money.   Get a real broker.   Deposit $500.

Wait for red day.   Look up symbol $SPX.   Sell spread with .20 Delta, 45 days out.  For instance,  right now,  You can sell Dec 31 expiration, 3320/3315 will give you 70 Dollars per spread (credit to your account).   You can sell as many spreads as you want.   45 days gives you a bit of time for your play to materialize and theta to do the work.

Once you start selling calls and puts,  you will realize how dumb it was to Buy them.   Buying options has its special day and unique moments when market is clearly heading a certain direction.   Otherwise,  its just bouncing in its place.  

 Free to ask any questions.   The reason I like spx is its cash settled and you dont have to worry about assignment.
PLTR given free
But you're paying $0.25 for $1.00 ? Why don't you want it?

I'm not asking why it won't tank or stay flat, I'm asking on what precident people believe we will blow the +1% monthly out of the water and hit 380-400 by EOY.
RKT is a TERRIBLE stock. It is going absolutely nowhere. WHY are so many people hyping this up?
Eh....Honestly, I'd hold it at this point and wait until it raises a bit before rolling it.  At least wait until mid/end December.  I agree that a strike of 31/32 in March would be better, but wait until you're back to 2k or more before doing so.  It should see 30 I think by New Year. or close to it.
Met one of you degens on COD the other day, who was it?
This is nonsense. The NHTSA already dismissed this defect as being immaterial in the states. The only reason for the recall in China was political, according to TSLA, who didn‚Äôt dispute it since doing so can jeopardize the ability to operate in China.

Theoretically you could short one further in the money on occasion if it were within your risk profile. I did this on Friday and got assigned. The most I can lose is the option exersise fee for my long position. The gains could be massive if the stock dips next week.
If you go up to the top comment on here I posted an explanation in that thread. Honestly, I‚Äôm no expert on options but I‚Äôm pretty sure my math is correct. Since OP is selling calls $15 below his LEAPs strike price he is about delta neutral or maybe his LEAPs has a slightly higher delta than the short calls. But the gamma on the short calls are much higher. This means that if the stock makes a big upward move the delta on the short calls increases rapidly while his long call has a very small change due to the low gamma. It‚Äôs unrealistic but just for example‚Äôs sake, if PLTR jumped up to $50 dollars on Monday OP would be looking at an enormous loss on each of the short calls because of this

This just seems like a lack of bad news that would point toward us returning to the +1%/month growth that I mentioned. Counters:

(1) This really only applies to a couple sectors. And I agree it is only "potential". (2) Anything related to the Pfizer pump is over with, it was over the Friday of that same week. (3) Not good, just lack of bad. (4) Priced in. Only a few media outlets are blowing this up as a contested election. The only people who actually believe the results have a >1% chance to flip is mango and his followers, even Fox has eased off.

Doctor and orthopaedic surgeon here: there is maybe a place for this but it will NOT replace larger, more sophisticated and detailed US machines. That cost tens of thousands each. Small US units or probes like the one outlined are mainly useful at the bedside for putting catheters in blood vessels. Checking pulses and blood flow.   


US is HIGHLY dependent on user interpretation and it is NOT possible to acquire this skill easily. It takes a LOT of time and practise, and some people never quite ‚Äòget‚Äô what they are looking at. The images are grainy layers that require 3D spatial skill to interpret and ‚Äòbuild‚Äô into a recognisable shape.   


There is a minefield of medicolegal risk attached to making erroneous diagnoses or assumptions based on US, which is why many clinicians will continue to rely on trained AND SUPERVISED imaging departments / practitioners rather than ‚Äòhave a go‚Äô.   


US is only accurate for a SMALL proportion of imaging: CT or MRI are the gold standard for most imaging. US is only reliable, as good or useful as CT/ MRI at liquid/ tissue interfaces: hence the usefulness in obstetrics and blood vessels - deep vein thrombosis, aneurysms, cysts etc. US has nowhere near the detail of MRI or CT in most other soft tissue imaging applications.   


The bane of my life as an orthopaedic surgeon was woolly and vague US ‚Äòdiagnoses‚Äô made by US, which then required CT or MRI to confirm / disprove.   


The hype here is overdone. It is not time to rush in. US will NOT replace the stethoscope! The latter is useful for a different spectrum.
Ultrasound also has the side effect of heating the tissue.

Actually EU has issues with Huawei too, and draconian import quotas for non EU cars.
So there‚Äôs a bit more to this to be honest. On th√© surface it seems to get the general idea but there‚Äôs important points that are missed here. Snowflake is both a partner and a competitor with AWS. We know AWS provides a TON of services and Snowflake currently partners with AWS in terms of using their EC2 instances as their backend but AWS have their own data warehousing capabilities in the form of RedShift which as rightly mentioned, directly competes with Snowflake. If you do a bit of reading, you‚Äôll see that Snowflake is actually quite a big part of bringing users to EC2. Snowflake is 100% cloud native but is built on top of AWS, Azure and GCP primarily (that is, they don‚Äôt have their own cloud storage backend yet), all of which have competing products with Snowflakes primary capabilities. 

PLTR on the other hand, as you‚Äôve said is a consultancy for big data analytics. They go and learn about client specific problems, provide a proof of concept before they commit to contracts. If you look at job postings for data engineers for PLTR, you‚Äôll actually see them mention that proof of concepts as part of the job description. Being tied to government is an issue in the sense that a lot of their revenue is from government, but they have products that are not tailored to government related tasks. They are being used in hedge funds and also in the aerospace industry. Growth outside of government contracts might be slow, but it‚Äôs certainly not impossible and they‚Äôve already demonstrated they can tailor to industries.

On th√© surface, Snowflake looks like it‚Äôs getting the rough end of the stick, but being the first mover helps a lot in that industry. PLTR have potential for massive growth, there are not many (public) companies that have the kind of network they‚Äôve already amassed, not to mention, having Peter Thiel can be a massive pull for Silicon Valley and beyond quite frankly. I‚Äôm personally very bullish on PLTR but I‚Äôve been buying shares since IPO so obviously very biased

Wrong. If you‚Äôre doing it like OP is (incorrectly) your short call can end up outpacing your long call if the stock makes a quick move up. This play has everything to do with the Greeks. Delta, gamma, Vega, and theta all play a huge role

You can shoot for 2000% gains in 0dte SPY options into the final 2 hours of trading. There's really nothing more surreal than watching the 100 contracts you purchased for 0.02 start whipping around in 0.20 cent swings (2.00-2.20) the final 20 minutes of trading.

Cars are a very expensive product. People usually avoid risks with buying stuff that's not guaranteed. And it's not easy to make cars that just work like it's generic toilet paper vs triple play.
Three negative reviews in 2020? Whoa man. Guess that refutes the fact they sold 20K homes and are growing at a triple digit CAGR.
THAT is unlikely to happen. TSLA is definitely overvalued but I don't see it dipping down under $100 unless someone absolutely catastrophic happens to the company.
You dropped 100k on short term SPY calls your very first time trading options? You didn't think, "hey, maybe ill buy one SPY 334c and see how it goes" ?
Let me drop some knowledge. It's not dead, but it's not exactly alive right now. When only a small percentage of the market is growing at a high rate that makes growth extremely important to investors. That's the market we're in right now. At some point down the line, maybe late next year or 2022, the entire economy (the real economy) is going to come surging back. When that happens the premium we place on growth will dwindle to nothing. That's when value will come rearing its ugly head. This often happens after heavy government spending on infrastructure (like biden plans on). Best find a few good small/mid cap value stocks for the explosion that will happen in a years time.
Good call. I have some IDRV calls too, but I literally have 40% of the OI myself and there‚Äôs no liquidity (yet)
That‚Äôs funny you think China is the tech innovator and not a thief. 

Tesla will hit the breakthroughs first. China will steal it, fuck up the reverse engineering process and Nio cars will be driving families off of cliffs.
You should. The first one is a bit slow (similar to The Bade Itself) the second one is great. Really unique and entertaining characters. simpler plot than the first trilogy, but overall really strong.

Do half of you work corporate jobs or work from home? Confused how y‚Äôall are able to piggy back your trades all day. What‚Äôs your secret.
Exercising an option is not the only way to close a position. You can also ‚Äúsell to close‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy to close‚Äù depending on whether you bought or sold the option (e.g. if you bought one call option, you can sell one call option to close the position). It effectively works the same way as buying and selling a share, but technically is quite a bit more complicated. Just Google ‚Äúsell to close‚Äù option if you want to try to understand it.
Well, perhaps you should make that clarification before posting that Amazon is out of TP. At first read, it implies the ENTIRE site is out of TP which can be misleading.

I just don't see a catalyst for a huge sell off, unless something big and unexpected shakes out the market.
Lmao that is not how it works. A PMCC is a bullish strategy ONLY because the delta on the LEAPs is supposed to be significantly higher than the delta on the short calls. Even if your LEAPs has slightly higher delta than the short call, look at the gamma. If PLTR makes a big move up you are going to be losing a ton of money. Just do some simple calculation on options profit calc. I deleted Imgur so I don‚Äôt feel like linking the pictures. But based on some rough calculations if PLTR gaps up to $22 on Monday your long call would be up $186 while your short call is up $206 putting you at a $20 loss. If it keeps going higher you keep losing even more money. By selling x5 20c 11/27 you‚Äôre pretty much putting yourself at huge risk for $265 in premium. Not to mention Vega is much higher on your long call than short calls. So if IV drops as the stock rises, you‚Äôre going to be getting fucked hard

Thing is, with spread bets, I pick the risk. If the vix is 15-20, I can bet on going broke at 5, but doubling my money at 30. If it spikes, we can see multiples. If I bet on a VIX of 30 to go down, doubling my money at 20, if it spikes to 40, I'm dead in the water.

When I buy stocks I try to limit my risk and maximize my potential upside. That's why I use a screener that sorts by stocks that have suddenly, and inexplicably, dropped in price significantly and then buy them up and wait until they go back up. They almost always do, sometimes in the same day. I won't get every 10 bagger and I'm OK with that. There are thousands of stocks out there. 

PLTR may very well be $25 by December but that's 100% a gamble. A guess. Because if it does reach that price it won't be due to any changes in the company itself but rather fleeting sentiment. I don't want to risk my money on fleeting sentiment, irrational exuberance and FOMO.

Same, whenever I see a post talking about "undeniable pullbacks" I just sit, think, and remember selling my tesla stocks at $200 per share, I remember not buying back into Tesla at all, I remember not buying into NIO earlier, I remember losing a thousand dollars on puts, all the missed opportunites. Never will I ever be bearish ever again because being bullish is so much more lucrative that even if you lose money you will get it back 10 fold. Currently up $1500 in nio stock and 1k in nio options. Just bought pltr options last friday.

I expect a week of insane moves; just crazy fucking shit. This is the week that Wall Street let's go of the reigns and let's retail traders take over.
Can someone give me a good case for being very fucking bullish(?!) In the short term, on the overall market right now?

We are officially hovering around the price that SPY would be if we did not have a pandemic, and if it continued it's average yearly growth on the 5 year and 10 year graphs. If anything spy will return to a growth of ~8% to 12% and we will see spy moving +1% a month. So, my VERY BULLISH scenario is SPY holding in the 360 range for a quarter. I really cannot comprehend anyone saying 380-400 by EOY. Anyone have a good case?
calls?  

i dont bet on calls or puts bc i do research and buy in cheap... and i dont need the money im betting with bc im long term.

if anything just to give you an idea by 2023 in Jan Nio should comfortably be sitting at 450 while Tesla will be around 1300-1500.
SQ leaps are what I‚Äôm considering. Imagine if it followed the same path as SHOP.

Yeah. Try to sell me a short squeeze thesis on the basis that GME will gain some temporary steam from new gen console cycle? Maybe....

But as a long term prospects? Don't see it. The fundamental difference between something like GME and Chewy is that pet owners and gamers are different demographics. Chewy filled a niche that didn't exist because other pet retailers didn't have good e-commerce presence.

GME is not at all comparable, even if they shift towards ecommerce in the 11th hour, what could they offer over Steam, or the native game stores for consoles? What could they offer over Amazon for people who want physical disks?

I could see maybe shifting to a games for rental or streaming thing, "Spotify for video games" subscription based library being cool. But I don't think GME is going to do that.

I got out of EVs and Renewables positions yesterday, waiting for the pullback of a lifetime from the big boys taking in profits. Some of these companies are pre-production, going to $1B valuations on $6m in R&D and 6 vehicle deliveries (SOLO)

If the pullback happens I am buying the dip. If no pullback occurs, I'm reentering my positions. Any calls 180d+ on the EV sector that's pumping. Might pick some specific tickets but all of them will continue to return for a while as we see the new ADMIN in the WH and we see the market literally start to move away from non-renewables in a significant way. But these valuations are still absurd for the products being produced, meaning that years of work to be done is already being priced in. 

Be careful with this segment of the market imo. Will continue to rise on hopes of new tech and the technological revolution creating more sustainable companies. Also, riding the tsla wave up. $51b purchase of tsla soon,might kick off another $10b buy.

Edit: Tldr: Any EOSE calls out 6 months are printing presses

Well, if you margin, that's 20k so you need to make 5k within 3 trades to day trade so that's about 1.6k per trade so just ride the EV boom. Solo will do it.

I lied, you only need 12.5 so you need 2.5 from the trade so a single day SOLO will get you there if you're using margin.

So my brother had a paid off condo, took a line of credit, and bought like $100k+ worth of coins at around $7k (years ago). 

Rode it up to when it first cracked 20k. Sold it right before the new year. It kept rising to he panic bought back in. However, his broker was going to be closed the last two weeks of the calendar year. 

Proceeded to tank uncontrollably. But he also ended up creating a massive capital gain to report. So he owed a ton of money in taxes (on like a $300k gain) and the coins dropped in value. 

I‚Äôll give him credit Bc he held onto to them and is riding it back up now, but he ended up paying a ton in taxes and is paying interest in that line of credit. 

Who knows how it ends up now, three years later
Wonder what the ipo price will be ... I just don‚Äôt see how this doesn‚Äôt go insane

I have been long since January in shares and have been snagging calls since September.

I honestly do not think a SS is possible without a crazy news/PR catalyst in or around Q3 ER. Just my humble two cents. I would prefer it to happen earlier. In the hopes of a SS, I am still holding a few calls for 11/27, 12/18 and about 80 contracts for Jan and Apr 2021. But if no SS at all, I can still see a ton of upside for holding shares (god it is hard to type out ‚Äòshares‚Äô like a boomer) through April/May.

Imagine not getting the vaccine approval news on Monday. Everyone keeps arguing we will see a reversal / rally once we get the vaccine news again - but we are already anticipating it, and hence it's already priced in. I think if we don't get the emergency approval news then we're going to continue down. I'm not a bull or a bear, but "buying the dip" at all time highs and trying to pump the market over a rumor of an announcement seems insane to me.

Positions: SPXS 6 calls for december and january
I mean attractive people leads to the narrative that it is a good business. Have you ever seen attractive people work at a dump?
They need to go digital and touchless within the next 3 months.   You don't have to close all the stores either.   You can still employee kiosk/vending type local transactions.  No cash transactions only.   Use the store space solely for inventory swap and kiosk style purchases.

Which is why this is done over time. They can't just buy a bunch in a day without price spiking so they spread it over weeks, months, or sometimes even years. If prices gets too high, they sell to push it back down then rebuy.

Sometimes, bad news will conveniently come out shortly before they decide to let it rocket. Price will often break through some "strong" support due to it before heading back up and never looking back.

Same thing happens on the other side too.

I get you, so essentially you buy in at a strike for a low price, wait for it to rise, sell a similar or same strike for the a much higher premium. 

Difference in premium less difference in strike = tendies? 

Sounds like a decent play to me - especially if volatile enough!

For credit spreads you are laying odds, so you are more likely to make on them than lose, but when you lose you lose big.  You have been doing this for a "couple weeks" on the "5 minute time frame."  That is not a sample size at all.  Eventually you will hit a bad losing streak and give up all the gains you had and be stuck minus the commissions and the arbitrage you lose against algorithmic flash traders.

**hype**  /hƒ´p/  *(noun)*: A company with $67B market capital, trading at 42x sales, with increasing net losses in the billions - and has never made a profit. Ever.

While I agree with everything in this post, I don't personally think there's much hope for GME at this point. Brick and mortal can go for sure, people can have consoles shipped to their door. However GME transitioning into an online store doesn't help with game sales in my opinion. People can already buy games from other retailers like Amazon in particular, as well as any other gaming related gear... So what exactly do they expect to change in GME to beat what is already beating them?

yup. frugal living will make you rich. When I was coming up I paid $400/month in rent/utilities to share a house in a low CoL area and $200/month in food. Car insurance was 50/mo for a piece of shit paid off $1k car. When you make $3500/month, total expenses are less than 1k a month, and start investing that money you're already at 6 figures in 3-4 years. 1% on a 500k pot is already more than the average american makes a year. Anyone can be rich - most are just too lazy/stupid to devote 5+ years to a plan and stick to it.

It's called legging in. Like all things it works until it doesn't. You could just cut the extra step though this works because the underlying went up so why not just sell the original call you bought. Make tendies and risk is gone. Usually people do this on longer dated trades. Once it goes up and you sell a call further up the chain for more then you originally paid or you effectively make a very cheap debit spread with big upside.

One of the effects socialized medicine will have is growing costs of medicine. Under the current standard we should see a lowering cost to patients because of technological advances. With a socialized medicine healthcare can ONLY go up. They would never decrease the taxes for a socialized medicine. Only capitalism could do that. Sure the government could be paying for all of it but the cost of the tax payer would increase year after year regardless of advancements made. This is because of the corruption socialism causes. Not to say capitalism is perfect or even uncorruptable, but the socialist ideology is inherently PRO Corruption. (because the infastructure  is there to manipulate).
Here I am wondering where the fuck people are going to clubs or strip clubs during a global pandemic.
bro he started the whole trickle down economics trend which is way worse. why is this bad? because companies dont actually trickle down their big profits down to the poor WOW big surprise who wouldve thought....
I mean they literally develop and sell software to analyze data sources.  They use open source libraries, bit did anyone not?

**How much $15,000 invested in SPY at the bottom in March is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 11/20/20 $300** strike calls was 1.51. Lets say we used $15k to buy 100 contracts to hold until expiration.

SPY 11/20 $300 calls are at the price of **55.70** which gives us a total value of:

#$557,000

no TA, no DD, no need to monitor Elon twitter, just blindly invest in a boring index on a dip and you can secure your retirement. All you need is luck and perfect timing. üåàüöÄ

Yeah I'm acquainted with their shitty business practices. They're basically the opposite of Amazon, they don't give even a single fuck about their customers. I'm not saying this is a good company. I'm saying they make tons of money and could be profitable tomorrow if they wanted to be. 

And honestly, they aren't any worse than AliExpress when it comes to scams and fake products. People don't mind getting scammed on AliExpress because the stuff they buy is so cheap, if 3/10 things they buy don't work as advertised, they don't care. All that matters is that you can buy a functional xbox controller knock off for five dollars, which is amazing. Even if it has a 1/10 chance of not working when you plug it in and it'll break in a year, who cares? Shits cheap yo

Penny stocks have pump and dump scams run on them all the time. IVR in particular.. no reason for it to spike.  Better off finding EV penny stocks.

Fair value for IVR is 3ish, and it would 3-5 years of not paying dividends for it to be worth 5.
why do you think south american countries are so poor and shitty?
But I‚Äôm doing this with credit spreads, and I only do this on spy so it makes it really easy to do this and I‚Äôm okay with putting up say 10k to buy calls and then selling my other leg getting that back right away and putting up a tiny collateral but that trade alone being 200-500% the next day is worth it
[deleted]
RTRD
this is definitely what I do. throwing around 10-20k on a monthly/quarterly that's in the money already takes a lot of risk off the table w/ theta but even selling out early on a +$1000 intraday lucky gain is more than enough to make a trade successful -- or if it goes sour you can average down/sell out since this is only \~1-5% of your portfolio.
Good point, i have ge calls for jan already up 60% so maybe some monthlies for that would be profitable
I'm trying to get to that number, how does this made me feel ......... Like my Gut in my stomach disappear and yes I know it's just one thing.

No sir I am talking about credit spreads, I understand the risk of the underlying going against me on the first round but using basic support and resistance for the past couple weeks has worked perfectly for me on the 5 minute time frame, the beauty of having unlimited day trades, if the trade does go against me I‚Äôll immediately turn it to a spread which would start making money right away, again my spreads are usually 15-20$ in credit so even if it does go down I‚Äôll still be fine, if it does start going up like I was hoping I‚Äôll just buy back the leg I sold for no to small loss but it‚Äôll be made back from the other leg or when the underlying starts going down after I collect more credit from selling the leg at the top.

In the beginning I hated myself for selling too quickly but I learned that a) losing sucks a whole lot more than profiting and b) there‚Äôs no end or reason to thinking in terms of ‚Äúif only I had‚Äù. If I had held longer that one time I could have made another $2k, and if I had held and made that $2k I may have hated myself for not holding even longer and making $5k. 

In the end, the longer you stay at the table, the more exposure you have and the higher your chances of losing.
Agreed. He claims peak was 150k. That makes no sense since he still has 48k now. The graph is not proportional. Ban this mf

[deleted]
Be kind. Say please and thank you. Remember that you‚Äôre objectifying someone‚Äôs son/brother/father.
The only issue with that strat, is you actually need the larger amount of cash up front. One big bonus of credit spreads is being able to play high premium options for cheap. So a stock having big run ups, will have high IV for puts, making it hard to win on strait puts without a big drops. Where as a put spread will let you bet the stock will drop like 1%, and you can make 50-100% easily.
Imagine still believing this
Anyone think IVR will go above 5 in the next year or so??
Never understood seeing Wish on the Lakers jerseys before. I was like, they‚Äôre such a scammy company how are they even legit tf?
Nah, if you don't hold till expiration you don't have to be that perfect. I try to sell with at least a full week left, if not more.
here's a guaranteed play - IF roblox or airbnb dip right after their IPO, buy shares because they will go up soon after, guaranteed.
Continually go long until you hit 25k

First of all, I believe you are talking about a debit spread.  Second of all, this doesn't negate any of the risk.  You may just have the underlying move against you and lose on your first round of purchases.  Your sample size is also most likely under 100.  You need to learn the basics about variance.

Sure, but different cities have different personalities and different merits/downsides to living there. Someone might prefer a coastal city, or they might not care about that. Some might prefer a very culturally diverse city, and some might not care. I‚Äôm using them as the most common examples and because those two cities were specifically called out.

I‚Äôm just tired of redditors acting as though everyone has the same priorities with respect to how they want to live their life and then proceed to look down on anyone who thinks differently.

Don't touch the girls.
I have been trying to spot fairly consistent patterns with certain stocks and playing on that. For example, people have been hesitant to leave money in Carnival stocks over the weekend for fear of bad covid news.

Yes, I recall. That horrified my puts. 

It just flip flops. There was a relief rally and now we are sobering up apparently. Nobody really knows yet where we will go, but so far buying has picked up and there is a lot of growing confidence that things will recover, despite the intermittent jitters. 

I still expect some volatility in December because there will be some fund rebalancing. That was also mentioned by JPM. Something along the lines of 160-300b selling in the broad market.

Only major advantage I‚Äôve seen is selling covered calls on tickers that are so volatile you would otherwise not choose to own them. For example covered calls on BABA or TSLA might make sense for someone that wouldn‚Äôt outright want to hold either stock.

If you are gonna dream, then the stock market is the place to dream. In 2020, not a stellar year, but I am learning to dream bigger than ever. Working on a company called Addepar, and it could fulfill that dream. It's not easily purchased now, but remember that company down the road in 2021. That'll be my dream.

I did research on newegg and they bought LLIT basically and LLIT is spaming out more stock. they are offering 1% of newegg for the previous owners and the expected mkt cap of newegg is 800ish million maybe more. 

So LIIT would have to be worth a mkt cap of 8mil for the stock to be worth it when picking up, obviously you can speculate that maybe newegg will open at 1billion so you could say its worth picking up at 10million mkt cap, but right now LLIT mkt cap is currently at 18.236m at price of righting with 4.74m stocks outstanding x 3.88 price. So newegg would have to open at 1.8236 billion for it to make sense buying now.

Unless i'm completely wrong obviously this is just LLIT example, but i'm unsure if the blank check company is restricted in any sense to offer any value to the people who bought prior to the merger. They might fuck you over way worse, or maybe they offer you a way better deal, but there has to be some way for AFFIRM to make their expected funds from IPO, they will be targeting some $ figure and they need to make that, so it has to come from printing more stock and the current market cap of this blank check is no where near what AFFIRM will be targeting, they will likely target like 6Bil

PLTR must have made you a mint this week.
Your calls are expiring worthless, I guarantee it
You poor bastard
Yes of course, for example on Tuesday spy is at 355$ using TA I predict spy will run up a dollar in the next 10 minutes or so, I buy a call 5-7 points out of the money for this example it‚Äôll be the 361$ call and then when I hit resistance or price target I will sell my second leg which is the 359$ call both exp Wednesday so 1dte this let‚Äôs you sell the other leg for more credit which lowers your risk to reward ratio spy next day then let‚Äôs say it dips in the morning I‚Äôll close my short leg and then if spy runs then I made some money from the call, so I always get more than the credit i was supposed to get resulting in 100-500% plays twice a week, I never hold over the weekend and usually play a Quicky 0dte

i live in cali so its worth more than that, and its way less than rent. bought the home for 750k in 2012 and its worth 1.1mil now. property tax is ~9k a year. rent would be 3500/mo for a 2k sqft house in this area. by no calculation was renting even remotely close to cheaper, even factoring in the property tax and insurance i still only pay $3300/mo, and thats ignoring the fact that the equity is going into the home, not the landlord.

Two big things on your thesis:

1. A lot of the recent growth in the industry has been driven by rapid growth casual gaming (phones, tablets, etc.); I'm not saying more hardcore gaming on consoles and PC haven't grown, but just wanted to put this out there
2. The other big trend that isn't talked enough about it the movement towards game streaming - know there are latency issues today, etc. etc.; but your nuts if you don't think they're going to be able to overcome some of these technology hurdles in the future with advancements in internet speed, CDNs, edge computing, etc.  Think literally, Netflix for games - potential for no hardware and no physical software (or DLs) in the future - everything done steaming; this absolute kills GME's business model

You know that NIO is going to the moon, but you're a poor degen and don't have the money or patience to buy shares like a pussy.

But you're also not retarded and you know it may take some dips along the way to refuel, so you're not gonna buy weekly FDs.

So you look at the 1/21/2022 exp date. you can spend around $1900 for an ATM($50) call with a delta of .69. Meaning of course that for every $1 the stock goes up, the option goes up $0.69.

This basically like owning 69 shares,  except that instead of paying $3450 for those shares, you only paid 1900. And the more that option goes ITM, the higher delta goes, which means that option gets closer to representing the movement of the full 100 shares it controls.

Also fyi LEAP stands for "Long-term Equity Anticipation"

The answer to your question is no.

You can't post comments about millennials - they'll downvote you to hell and vote to remove your post.  Doesn't matter what the question or topic is.  When they don't understand the question, they'll assume you are making fun of them.

I think it's because of this (source: Wikipedia).

> In March 2019, Tesla sued Cao Guangzhi, a former Tesla employee, accusing him of stealing its Autopilot source code and bringing them to Xpeng. Cao denied claims of intellectual property theft, but admitted to uploading Tesla's source code to his iCloud account prior to leaving Tesla while he was still working for Tesla.[15][17] In response to Tesla's accusations, Xpeng launched an internal investigation and said it ‚Äúwas not aware of any alleged misconduct by Mr. Cao.‚Äù.[15] In April 2020, Tesla made new filings in its lawsuit.[18]

Yeah this is a diagonal spread, but if he‚Äôs selling the lower strike its delta negative, which is not how this is generally done. Usually you‚Äôd do this and leave room for the underlying to go up before hitting your short strike, but op is betting the price of the underlying stays the same or decreases and he profits off theta. Also it doesn‚Äôt sound like he knows what he‚Äôs doing. The position is crap if the underlying goes up a lot and if you want to profit off theta theres many better possibilities

How one novice on Reddit collapsed the whole EV market
It's November 2023, after the second Pandemic killed off most of the human population, and the alien invanders forced the survivors underground, the last tuna cans left on earth expire, and a young man ventures above his sub-terrainian dwelling in search of supplies for the winter. 

After finding an abandoned Wendy's, he looks through the already ravaged storeroom for supplies to keep him warm in the upcoming cold months.   As he searches he hears a whisper, "Hey, wanna buy some Tesla calls?" The young man says "Who are you?" The man responds "OP".

LOI stands for Letter of Intent (i.e. intent to sign the SPAC deal with GIK). Once the letter of intent is issued, GIK and Lightning will work out the details of the deal and your shares of GIK will likely be converted into Lightning shares upon its closing. 

If I wasn‚Äôt clear, the ticker on Robinhood is $GIK (GigCapital3).
Burry is irrelevant in a RC takeover/consulting narrative. Since they have diametrically opposite reasons for entry in terms of GME (value in buybacks and dividends vs value in company growth.) Burry pulling back may be a signal that Cohen is getting a firm grip on the trajectory. 

For me it‚Äôs a bet that Cohen‚Äôs work ethic and personality compels him to take over. Timed right the squeeze is viable. Either way the short thesis is mostly dead, I have no clue why they‚Äôre still balls deep as the price could very well be in the 20s soon.

Tech stonks aren't representative of SPY. SPY 's healthier looking when it gets to \~340, overbought right now with everyone jumping back into value.

December is known for being the time of year when small caps come alive too. 

Check out $CHWY and $NET. Chewy's been getting some accumulation and has a low RSI, I think we jump back to $70. $NET is wedging, keeps trying but just needs a catalyst.

If you have a cash account, no, but if you have a margin account and also buy options, it‚Äôs possible you could get into a situation where you may have a margin call because of options.
Of course, that‚Äôs a typical outcome for most healthy people. But for unhealthy people and for a meaningful number of healthy ones it‚Äôs much worse than typical flu with effects that last a lot longer.
Good luck
This is is the only acceptable answer.

To get from 10-25 you're going to need to get lucky and do a lot of doubling.

Since you'll be day trade restricted you'll have to turn every profitable "day trade" into a spread. So you can hold it overnight and close the next day.

Most people aren't that disciplined, and you'll see your gainers roll over on you, leaving you holding the bag.

I don't get the value in this business. What efficiencies do they bring? The real estate market is currently very heated, what happens to their inventory of homes when prices drop or stop increasing?
Quick question. What the fuck has the entire last year of market movement been then?
Similar experience, except it was a drunk friend who had gotten a bunch of lapdances and no money to pay for them. Dumbass stripper shouldve gotten the money up front. He stood up pretending to go get money and after about 4 minutes we realized he wasn't coming back and booked it out of there.

No, that‚Äôs just the entirety of Reddit, except minus the emo girls and the femboys
It‚Äôs most likely trump will seek a pardon (pardons only work for federal crimes, states can still go after trump and his family). So trump needs additional leverage so they can he negotiate immunity for him and his family in state courts (mostly New York).
This guy probably has ass burgers. A true gold medal retard.
I can't believe the amount of people who are planning on normal Thanksgiving and Christmas. Bringing their grandparents from nursing homes, etc. It's going to be the worst the virus has ever been. I work in a hospital and it's already worse than it was in late spring/early summer
I think it‚Äôs suspect that people would actually think it‚Äôs no worse than the flu, and feel the need to spread that perspective.
Yes, it was much better when I passed 25k. 

Can take more chances on things that are ripping and not get locked in overnight.  

My gains started going up more steadily as well. 

Biggest advantage is you can get out if something starts moving against you too fast.

Nah dude.  I‚Äôm a lawyer and just to let everyone know ‚Äî‚Äî trump is fighting to keep himself and his family out of jail right now.  Everything else is, to use trumps words...‚Äùfake news‚Äù.  

Trump is trying to gain as much leverage as possible so that he can get immunity for his family (he really only cares about Ivanka).  But this is his strategy.
Is this 1 Million in options?

You guys want a lottery ticket I'll give you one being that I've been right on like I don't know a gazillion things on Reddit even though I get downvoted out of existence every time I'm right for some reason.  

I was right on covid-19 too but everybody got angry and downvoted me out of existence saying that it would become more and more lethal overtime and the cases would absolutely Skyrocket beyond belief which now they are skyrocketing beyond belief and it's becoming even less lethal if you look at the numbers.

Old Dominion Freight Line April is the month and 240 is the strike price.   You can pick up each call for $4.40.

One time I was up at a strip club with a couple friends. I only had a hundred in cash. This stripper came up and talked to me. Sat on my lap talking and flirting for a couple hours. By the point she was going to give me a lap dance. I needed to go to the atm to get cash because I was buying so many drinks. The strip club‚Äôs atm has a forty dollar fee. When I saw this. I cancelled the withdrawal and went to smoke a cigarette, leaving the stripper inside waiting for me for the rest of the night because my friend was too drunk to be allowed back in at that point so we had to leave.

I want one. I did 30 days this summer for mentioning mango and probability of sleepy winning.
Depends on what you did to get to the 25k mark. If you constantly day trade but only when you have day trades left then you'll be able to make more day trades. If you mainly swing trade then not really. 

It is good to never have to worry about whether you have any day trades left before getting into a trade though.
This is the right time to YOLO it again on slightly ITM PLTR calls for like Febraury.

Is it still possible to make 20k back before jan ?
And why shouldn't it be?  

Amazon is getting into last-mile physical stores in high density areas. Gme already has a physical customer base, in fact too large of one and could do with fewer stores, but a distribution network nonetheless. It should be much easier to break into digital. The hard truth is that non-enthusiasts (I.e. Normies) do not buy 10+ games and so do not see value in digital only consoles. Msof is trying to FORCE digital only through the big price drop on the digital version, which these normies will not get at the Microsoft store but gamestop. Reading the past several months, its very clear how out of touch wsb has been on gamestop (cheap used games! They ripped me off as a kid!) where the truth is, they are still seen as THE place for games. All that's needed is to get people used to in-store pickup (already ongoing with pandemic) and start a last-mile delivery option. Gme's position as the gamer store is already inevitable and if mr chewey is gonna get us there faster then good for him
This is true

>Definitely due for a pullback but I doubt it will just collapse from here unless the market crashes again. Also, Cathie Wood just said she thinks it could go to 400k-500k under the right conditions. She also sold a portion of her BABA holdings at the bottom so there's that.

The problem isn‚Äôt the leap, the problem is PLTR. Anyone who knows won‚Äôt buy the stock til after January. Ppl like Soros hitting them and Citron hitting NIO make ppl wary of investing for now.

This sub is being duped into a pump and dump pltr isnt worth more than 12$ a share unless they somehow double or triple profits and provide a dividend.

No, as long as the strike for the calls you sell are equal or above the strike of the LEAPs you own, no additional collateral is required. 

Think about how it works. The call you've purchased (the LEAP) entitles you to purchase 100 shares at the strike price. The weekly you sell obligates you to tell at the strike price. So as long as the strike of the weekly is equal or higher, you can always exercise your LEAP to get the shares, then sell them to the guy who bought your weekly if they choose to exercise.

[calendar spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calendarspread.asp#:~:text=A%20calendar%20spread%20is%20an,%2C%20time%2C%20or%20horizontal%20spread.) Selling weeklies at the same strike as your LEAP.

[diagonal spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/diagonalspread.asp) Selling weeklies at a different strike from your LEAP.

In their pockets?
all the tech companies back in 2000 had products and services that proeple could use and they were projected to grow massively over the next ten years and they did grow massively. BUT this doesn't mean these companies are not overvalued. They can have great future prospects but trading at PE in hundreds with absurdly inflated valuations while they are not even making money is not sustainable. The bubble will pop as it did in 2000 for tech, then gradually rise over the next decade if future indeed is ruled by EV.

The future of pltr? Game stop? Ev‚Äôs other than tsla? Or are you sticking to these?
I‚Äôm getting in Monday. They just announced supply‚Äôs are way higher than expected because nobody‚Äôs using NatGas this is massive bullish news. Look at oil after lockdowns started back up and storage is full to the brim and not expected to burned off till 2023!

Carvana is the perfect example of how dumb people are. Spot checked a few models and the cars on there are consistently 15%-20% overpriced.

I'm thinking of getting in at 20c 12/18. How does that compare to 22c 12/18? I imagine chances I profit are higher, but my profit could be lower? And that comes from the fact that my contracts are just more expensive.

I made 2 trades to lock in profit because I thought it was better than holding. Happy I did because it tanked. Then when I realized I would be banned I went all in used my margin and traded in and out the EV stocks early Friday. Basically they kept telling me I was banned from day trading but obviously no one at RH looked it over yet. Ended up getting to 25k by EOD and thus, no day trade ban, I‚Äôm still here motha fuckers.

See what stocks are making a run for the week, see which one is flat on Thursday and buy just before close. Then you pray.
I mean the current market is too volatile and we can t expect it to go up exponentially continuously. At some point investors need to realize their gains.. The market has been too volatile and as u see spy500 it‚Äôs not going further up anymore.. vix is too low and at the same time gold value declined..

You realize the current studies indicate the virus makeup is EXTREMELY stable in nature meaning a vaccine would effectively counter it.

This. 

I bought in two years ago by putting my entire Wendy‚Äôs paycheck of $215 on the line. Today I have $235. It‚Äôs literally just free money.
Two weeks ago the agument wouldve been for a pullback and we never got that, instead we got a new ATH.

Tho i guess now that we're after the fact we can say we got a big excess high and now confirmation that there are sellers sitting at the start of that excess north of 3620 and that's even with another dose of vaccine pump.

So now of course i believe we need to dump to find more buyers to push through these prices. They couldn't have a close below last week's VPOC 3557 until friday so that's clearly bullish consolidation. That being said we stopped the one time framing higher on the daily and weekly, it restarted on the monthly tho after 2 months of consolidation and this consolidation seems to have resolved to the upside so even tho we might pullback some short term, the longer term trend is very clearly still up.

You're pointing to a 50% retracement but the VPOC is at 3375, another scenario would be a retest of 3505 and that's it.
 
Other markets really didn't give anything back which is why i'm remaining very bullish and am skeptical this goes much lower than your target or the VPOC. 

Looking at MMTH, IWM and RSP also signals this rally is clearly broadening out and they also didn't give back much, in fact IWM is up on the week.

I think we'll see both bonds and stocks rally after stocks find a momentary support most likely early next week but what do i know the market will probably humble me as always

How about we do since it's largely the cause of suffering in our world. There's literally no reason, as a globalized near-hivemind species that has the resources to take care of more people than we have now, that we can't provide universal access to all basic human needs: shelter, water, food, internet, clothing, healthcare, education. We also need to understand how our individual uses of shared resources impacts the whole, so money should be taken out of access to common land, water and air.

You downvoted me and proposed the opposite without presenting any logic or plan for the matter. I'm tired of having pissing contests with children on the internet. Global Warming isn't just coming, it's already here and while we are technically already "past the point of no return", there still is time to at least reduce our speed before we crash into the brick wall.

It's time for us to grow up and fix our shit, and learn that the dumb little games we/others play with money can seriously impact lives.

USA is going down hill. Invest in your own country.
There should be a "chance of profit" percentage as well that can help guide you. You can compare the chance of profitability between both stock options.   Also remember the Greeks when making a play and each of their roles. Its not just important to pick the best call price point but it's also important to know when to take your money and go. Which one is better ? That depends on how much you know and how much you are willing to risk/ gamble.  I have more of a bearish outlook sometimes but I wouldn't go out of the money unless you know/willing to gamble that  a stock will go to that price. Gl!
I knew I could call this place home, thank you.

Options are insurance.  Sellers provide a service that reduces future uncertainty for buyers. Buyers receive value whether or not the option expires worthless; just like you receive value from owning health insurance even if you do not go to the hospital.

You may not realize that benefit while speculating but many participants in the market are willing to pay premium for the service. This could be a retiree paying premium to protect against a downturn, an HR department reducing the risk of their ESPP program, etc. etc. etc.

This is why in the long run selling options is more profitable than buying options all else equal.

Cs is hard starting off, especially with no prior knowledge because it‚Äôs mostly just understanding how everything works and developing some coding knowledge which isn‚Äôt really easy to figure out. It gets easier the more you code/as you go along. You also learn what to copy and paste from github and that really simplifies things when actually writing code.

Wrong.

When I sell a covered call and it executes, it‚Äôs win/win. I get my premium and preset profit goal. The buyer bet right and wins.

How many ways do you have to be proven wrong?

Just stop already.

Excellent advice! Ya, I plan to get out if there is a large spike. But I just love the returns on a $5k call instead of just $5k of stock. Larger returns in this bull market!

What happened?
What is your goal? Think about what you expect the stock to do. Look at the history of it determine what are the key levels and decide for yourself what strike you are comfortable buying. For example if it fell 10 dollars would you regret buying a call that's barely ITM? What I would recommend after choosing your strike is to sell covered calls on it but ultimately depends on your assumption and how bullish you are. If you want a profitable outcome you need to do your DD. Good luck retard

Thank you for your sacrifice
Don't worry too much about the break even, look at the delta. 

And please don't hold for the full two years, get out when you're happy with the gains, on a big spike or something. The longer you hold the more you're getting theta fucked, leaps are good for protection. Sell them when up and rebuy at a different strike/expiration. Nobody ever went broke selling for a profit.
I don't even know what pltr does
I‚Äôve been a transportation manager for about 5 years, have overseen probably total of 2-300 truck drivers in my career. How much you make is highly dependent on your attitude and work ethic. My highest performing drivers in terms of earnings have always been the guys with positive attitudes and that take safety seriously. They put in a couple more hours than most per week to max out their utilization and they don‚Äôt do stupid shit like hitting parked cars or driving under low bridges. At the other end there‚Äôs sadly a lot of guys that are just always pissed off, lazy, and don‚Äôt care about their own or other motorists safety. They spend extra time correcting dumb fuck ups or just not effectively managing their HOS, work less as a result, and when combined with lack of money management skills, they typically struggle financially. 

Put in the effort and it can be an easy $100k per year after you get 3-6 months driving experience.
What in the cousin fucking hell is a ‚Äúprofit‚Äù?
Selling covered calls on stocks you own is reasonably safe. 
Just be prepared to sell at your strike price if the stock shoots past it. 
Don‚Äôt FOMO for it back. 
Don‚Äôt sell calls below your cost basis.

1. Pick a number of tendies you want to gain.

2. Calculate which retarded OTM SPY put you have to buy to turn your 20k into the desired amount. 

3. Stare at charts at every timeframe with every indicator and find one stupid indicator which says there is a chance that your target will hit.

4. Convince yourself that this will happen by browsing things you want to buy with your tendies. Keep looking at over expensive things till you are convinced that SPY will have the amount of circuit-breakers you need to hit your retarded target.

5. Spend your 20k on these FD's

6. Double down on margin when you are 50% down.

lol let‚Äôs go, i bought ccl calls last week
Short term call is a yolo scenario, better to do it on a meme stock. I've lost my ass on SPY too often. Got a 10x bagger and lost it reinvesting it in spy short term contracts. Should've just had it in TSLA or NIO for 8 months and would've made like 100k instead of losing my ass.

It sucks because I got so fuckin spooked by the drop at the end of the day and the fed changing the rules on lending I thought for sure it was gonna have an overall market impact and I thought I should just take my profit and run at the bell. I was already over leveraged so a full on crash would have seriously fucked my account up, so I let fear fuck me out of big gains. Gotta remember to not overleverage and over trade because if I had been following my rules I wouldn‚Äôt have shook myself out of some decent gains. Aaaah! Fuck ü§°

If SPY was really at 334 early in the day he could've had like 1 chance to offload it at some price, not like breaking even at all but some asshat would be buying a FD on the same day. Better than expiring. Gotta be lucky tho.

Tesla, NIO, ChargePoint all have products people use and will continue to grow massively over the next ten years. There‚Äôs no bubble here right now, just a shift in the world that some people are catching onto and throwing all their money at before anyone else realizes what happened. 

Obviously there will be companies that fail like pets.com did with the .com bubble. But Tesla, NIO, and SBE seem to be past the point of potential failure. Nikola on the other hand.

Yeah, ChargePoint owns 78% of the U.S. charging market. I have been driving an electric car for over a year and a Tesla since March. Super Chargers are obviously the best experience for anyone with a Tesla but ChargePoint is a very close second and the best for anyone without a Tesla. None of the other chargers out there come close with overall user experience and branding. ChargePoint is going to continue to be the dominant player in EV charging and in the long run this stock will go to the moon. It‚Äôs a ten year hold for me, so I‚Äôm trying to get as much as I can at this price while it lasts. I which it would go down again, but I doubt it ever goes below $18 again.

>really build out the Game Trading as a Service model, put out an app that let's some guy here arrange a trade with some guy over there.

This would be the area they would have to build off of (digital game trading reselling).   I haven't been in gamestop for years now, and digital downloads are taking over the market.  I think the only thing that might get me back to a brick n mortar is if they started carrying a decent selection of table top games or something.  Now, if their online market could give me the option to sell my digital downloads to other users for X amount to be credited to my account, THAT would get my attention (obviously there would be some hurdles to get over with Sony / xbox)

We're coming up on about a year into the start of the TSLA bubble, and now that the last big news event us underway (inclusion to 500) it should mark the top of the bubble.

This is like in 2017 when shitcoin peaked right as the CME futures contract for it was being released. Essentially, the second shitcoin became "bonafide" it tanked 80 percent and got crushed. Also, the problem with TSLA becoming included in the sp500, is now that index can take TSLA down with it if the markets were to have another crisis. TSLA has been able to enjoy it's status and growth independent of the index, which can often act as an anchor in bad times (which we're in, despite the FOMO).
Realistically it should take years. But this is WSB. YOLO it all on PLTR calls and get rich or die tryin.

I guess..  you can always lock it in and grow 380K into several million much more safely. Also assuming you're trying to provide 30-40% for a down payment, the house price is 1-1.5mil ish. That's fair. I still think you'd be better off growing this using safer investments, but hey you do you.  The buying power just worries me a lot since these gains mean nothing til they're locked in :/ good luck though

Buy opposite to the trend  on volatile liquid stocks 1.5-3 months out expiry and premium is relatively cheap. Eg stock tanking, when it hits low stochastic rsi on weekly candles I buy calls. Also leaps on liquid ETFs 1-2 years out and wait.
Were just talking about the stock price going up for the near future,near even meaning 2 years considering how low the price is
Why did you buy in so late with such a tight expiration? You know people don't have to buy the stock until december, right?

 Chimera Investment Corp. operates as a real estate investment trust. It engages in investing directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries, on a leveraged basis, in a portfolio of mortgage assets. It includes residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage loans, real estate-related securities, and various other asset classes. The company was founded on June 1, 2007 and is headquartered in New York, NY. The listed name for CIM is Chimera Investment Corp.

I think anyone who thinks real estate backed loans during a pandemic and global shut down is a good idea deserves to invest in this pile of dog shit. Commercial real estate is going to get ass blasted when all of these empty businesses and offices stop paying the rent and they go tits up. Think 2009 but on a larger scale.

Sell puts instead and pick them up for a discount in June 2021

Do I understand it right, you bought 10 option calls for TSLA to hit 455 USD at 27th of November?   
One contract being 940, so 10 were total of 9400 USD

And since TSLA is right now around 489 USD, those contracts became worth approx 60K, so minus your purchase price, you made 50K on this?
Nah fuck Tesla I lost 4K on them this week

How do we buy puts on people?
Thanks! So in the example photo, lets use the $70call as an example.

There is a $16.45 fee per call, the call is ITM at $70, it is break even at $86.45. It requires the stock to rise 30% in order to reach that break even price right?

&#x200B;

If I plan to hold for 2yrs, is the $60 call better (with a break even of $80.70), or is a $80 call better (with a break even of $93.75). This is all assuming the stock ends at $100. Which technically makes more money?
The best job to have is no job at all.. i tried looking for a job thinking the grass is greener someplace else/in a different career then i realized having to work in general sucks massive cock.. the best goal for me is to just grind at my current job for the next couple years then retire fully..

If you are making 0.5% every single day, it means you know what you're doing. 

In any other job, doing something ten times and hoping it goes right once means you're not reliably good at it. There can easily be a data set where you miss 10 out of 10.

Put it this way. Which of these two scenarios would a bank lend to. There's a reason why.
Because Fuck you, that's why!
Don't buy options on this. Options prices factor in hype and volatility to their price at double or quadruple the effect of the same hype you see in the stock itself. You are truly paying for the hype, at least in part. That is how they are priced. So you have to ask yourself: in x days/weeks/years,  will there be even MORE hype on this than there currently is? If yes, buy options. If not, or you don't know, buy shares.

This doesn't even factor in the option price decay which occurs from the simple passage of time.

Smart money buys shares on this.

Am I the only one who is thinking about buying 30k+ in tsla 300p for around september-december of next year?
I feel you man. If we put it on Monday at $33 that day for $1K we would have made around $330 (from what other people calculated and commented).

I feel like it's still a decent chance to still buy CRSR on Monday morning and looks like PLTR will be a good option too. I put $500 in my account but that will be coming in next Friday so most likely the Monday after I'll have to put in PLTR. It's currently $18 so hopefully it doesn't go over $25 at the end of the week and just keep there for the possible long run.

I know people are shitting on me but idc I'm still a retarded first time newbie here still learning haha. Best of luck to you of course

I was just joking. What I really want is for it to be pumped lol. 7 contracts. 10C 1/21/2022. 3 days ago I was up bigly. Now I'm just up. Gotta look. 33.6% which is still nice but if I can make 10k in this account I'm leaving and getting me a new car lol. When it dropped a bought another contract. If on Monday it drops below 11, I'll buy more. The IV was stupid high on Friday so I only bought one because they were way more expensive than when I bought them 3 days before that.
SOLO will pump to $30 then you‚Äôll probably never hear of it ever again in your life
I would be interested in hearing more if you can share.

thanks broo
need a screenshot of positions
If you live in the UK - 20% (Contracts are classed as assets so subject to CGT tax)

If you live in the US - around 39% for short-term (less than 12 months) and around 20% long-term (if you held options for over 12 months).

But with people playing weeklies that's around 39% no doubt (In the US)

No, you don't understand, you won't be able to open a robinhood account in your country, whatever it is.


Individual Requirements

To apply for a Robinhood account, you‚Äôll need to meet the following requirements:

Be 18 years or older;

Have a valid Social Security Number (not a Taxpayer Identification Number);

Have a legal U.S. residential address within the 50 states or Puerto Rico (we may make exceptions for active U.S. military personnel stationed abroad); and

Be a U.S. citizen, U.S. permanent resident, or have a valid U.S. visa*.
Yea, that‚Äôs it

What did you do when pton dipped from it's high of (140 I think?) To under 100? Do you roll to the same strikes with more expiration? I understand to roll up and out as it goes up, but what do u do when it goes down?
Basically, yes. But I think we go to 3350 before the climb to 4000-4150.  


Once you see 3800 on the SPX, start shopping for 3000 puts. You'll want a vertical debit spread that pays OVER 20 to 1.

Hey, that‚Äôs a really good point. They still produce 250-300mbbls/d in light. But closer to 500 for heavy. And like you said, the market is far more limited for heavy, but Suncor is the lowest cost producer in a country that holds 70% of the worlds bitumen. And bitumen demand continues to grow.

Related to this. It‚Äôs funny reading people‚Äôs doomsday scenarios. They come around every few decades/ centuries in the energy industry. In 1850s, everyone thought coal was gonna be gone by the 80s. Then in the 80s they said no by early 1900‚Äôs. So on and so on.

I wasn't giving advice. I wouldn't do this for sure, and even said that. But I'm saying the risk profile can make sense for someone that sees stocks as a lotto to become independently wealthy rather than seeing it as a grind to becoming independently wealthy.  My personal opinion and advice is to never yolo anything and learn to be an actual investor, regardless of your bankroll. But to each their own. I wouldn't criticize people that bought bonds or 0dte options on EV stocks. Just hope they all know what their risk/reward profile is and what their goals are.

Prediction: Biden's first "test" as president will be handling a stock market crash.  


Scenario: Biden will come in talking "money for the little people", "pro-union", "higher taxes on the wealthy".  


Wall Street will tank the market 40%, putting the focus back on the financial sector which will then be rewarded with 100 to 1-sized "handouts" ( in the form of transferring all junk corporate debt onto the tax payers ) relative to the common person.  


This will happen in October 2021. But the cracks will begin showing in late summer 2021. The SPX will collapse from 4000 to a minimum of 2900.

> Why are we even considering sacrificing American lives (at minimum $80k a pop) to interfere in some tribal conflict halfway around the world?

morals, for a start. ghadafi and saddam were not particularly better than hitler. when genocidal leaders are in power, its the duty of the democratical countries to intervene. and of course, to keep the oils supplies steady and under control, and strategical positions out of the hands of american rivals. again: if american doesnt gets involved, someone will - and that someone will be holding warm water ports, important oil supply points and routes, and so on. keeping those under america's control its in the best interests of american people, and in fact, of democratic countries in general.

>For example: Syria annually imports less stuff from the US than the Biden Transition will cost. And that is ignoring the net; the things the US imports from Syria.

i never implied that the us was intervening in syria to keep good relations with syria (?). keeping syria stable and its strategical mediterranean positions away from al assad, and consequently, russia, are in the best interests of america's european allies. leaving syria by itself was a betrayal of the interests of american allies in the area, including turkey that its part of nato. not to mention how lessened american military presence in the area opens up space for an isis ressurgence, something that partly lead to mattis resigning.

>For the record: Trump "left" the Kurds high and dry because we had US troops supporting the Kurds and US forces supporting Turkey (a NATO member state) and the Turkey and the Kurds had decided they were going to start shooting at each other.

turkey started to invade kurdish positions. this is from fucking lindsey graham: ‚ÄúI blame Turkey more than anyone. Turkey‚Äôs invasion has put at risk the defeat of the caliphate‚Äù. instead of protecting a people that were they allied for years, trump abandoned them to not bother his buddy erdogan - whom he loves because he is "though and mean":

> "I get along very well with Erdogan, even though you're not supposed to because everyone says, 'What a horrible guy,'" Trump told Woodward in one of 17 interviews for the journalist's new book, "Rage."

> "But for me it works out good. It's funny, the relationships I have ‚Äî the tougher and meaner they are, the better I get along with them. You know? Explain that to me someday, OK?" Trump said, adding: "The easy ones are the ones I maybe don't like as much or don't get along with so much".

he is clearly starstruck by "macho" leaders, hopes to be seen as "one of the boys" and lets this dictate his foreign policy. his abandomnent of the kurds will ressonate for decades and make it increasingly harder for the us to find allies amongst 'tribal peoples' - being an alliance breaker fucks up your credibility, [something every diplomat or general worth its salt knows already](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/james-mattis-resignation-trump-erdogan-phone-call). the US's best hope is that the rest of the world ignores this trump presidency as a fluke and completely erases it from their memmories, but we all know this won't happen - specially after this close vote. the us will take decades of decent leadership to stop beeing seen as a potentially erratic country and as an unreliable ally.

Because at expiration, you have no more extrinsic value. If the price of the underlying is right at the strike, you also have no intrinsic value. A lot of guys here seem to choose strike prices that are where they think the price will move to by expiration. You want to choose a strike that the price will move far BEYOND by expiration.

I enjoy lotto options.  My ratio is 4:1 this year.  But that one gained some 1000% return, so I'm happy with it.  

Options are best to hedge your portfolio, or sell for small profits.  

But you're in WSB... so lotto options it is.
Let me kick you a scenario. 

Your wife‚Äôs boyfriend gives you 250k to invest. The deal is, if the value of the investment is worth more than 1m by the end of the year, you can keep it. If it is worth less than 1m, he keeps everything as well as your wife and he may use you how he pleases...

Here‚Äôs the catch, he knows you‚Äôre retarded with options so you‚Äôre only allowed to buy SHARES of 1 company. 

Where do you put the 250k?

When I was around $500k it happened to be the ideal time to get into real estate (2010). I used $100k on two down payments on two rentals ($100k turned into $600k today). Of course the rest of my portfolio has also done well since the market has been in bull mode since then. Wanted to mention real estate because it should always be considered too. Not right now thought, it is also in a bubble right now. I'll sell my final property (other than my own home) this spring. I'm rotating into what I think will be a cheap stock market in later 2021. 

The general answer on passive returns is to invest in things like SPY. A good investor can easily beat spy, in my mind. I am a minority around reddit so don't want to say too much about what I do but I'd say I'm a value/contrarian investor. Buy when things are way oversold, short when there is way too much euphoria buying. But even then only safe plays. I bought BABA last week at $253. Looks like a lucky catch at its bottom in hindsight but I miss more opportunities trying to be patient than I catch at incredible entry points. I'm ok with that. Truly passive is just index funds and even they will take $500k to $4M in 20 years (10% per year average, 7 years to double, need three doubles). If you can average 20%  you get three doubles in 10 years or so. Depends if a deep recession falls in your timeline, which I think is about to happen. I worry the markets will have a huge drop on the next year followed by a slow climb out (because fed overshot covid relief). Spy might end up with flat returns from 2021 to 2026 (with a big dip in 2021/2022 and a climb back the following years).
Ya I am sad too. This will barely cover a downpayment on a small house so unfortunately it needs to stay in play.

No. But they are hoping it falls out of the money by then.
No. At least for now. There is new money continuously being pored into the market and limited money being withdrawn. I can sell a CC, win on my position that I bought lower and the person who bought the CC can win because it hit their price target and then some. Hedges technically are loser/winner, but that‚Äôs their purpose.

I believe this was created after the 2008/2009 mortgage crisis. Instead of holding banks accountable they just allow them to charge us more because a bunch of retards foreclosed in 08/09.
both sides are equally responsible for this clusterfuck

the problem isn't democrats or republicans, it's that we are so polarized

i wonder who we can thank for that
Put everything you wanna invest, into pltr. Come back in a year. Thank me and gimme money.

I sold my car to vroom. They sold it shortly after for 2k more. 2k or 15% seems to be their margin on sales. You should be able to scrape their inventory daily with a script and see how many cars they are selling. I'd assume they put about $700 into each car for parts, labor, detailing and other misc and that's maybe a bit high. Their offers are usually the middle between kbb dealer trade in and kbb private sale.
It's been hovering around 18k for a few days now like we are around SPY's ATHs. Uneasy.

Yes and it really works you won‚Äôt see 20k+ in one day but I‚Äôm up ~50k since this post = 32k in 37days just by reinvesting my winners. 

I‚Äôm using CFDs still trying to build a portfolio. Have 12 companies in my current portfolio I‚Äôm Long on 4 of them the others I try to profit in the midterm (2-6 months) 

No doubt the covid drop might have sped up the process I don‚Äôt know if these kind of gains are normal. I started mid July.
EV f150 is gonna moon, not to mention their new EV van. They are putting giant batteries into the van as to allow contractors to use them to power jobs it's.

It'll be a slow adaptation, but once small contractors catch on its gonna boom. I know a few guys who run their jobsite while idling their diesel truck to run an inverter, this will revolutionize that concept.
Zm fill gap to 500, no doubt. Too cash poor to buy tho
a kickinthedick for sure. Large shareholder here, which is why I was curious of your bear position. I would look into the bull case a bit more before shorting again. Yes, it is ridiculoualy highly valued for its current output but their growth trajectory is on an exponential curve. They've been talking about the competition coming for years.

I was in jail once and in a temporary holding room with about 15 people total and a toilet in the corner with no divider or privacy at all. Two Hispanic dudes had been caught by the Federales and turned over to TX Rangers for walking off a low security Federal facility so they could run to Mexico and see their family who was sick with swine flu...

When you're in jail or prison, there is an unwritten rule to not watch other people take a shit (maybe just a rule in life?). In one split-second I accidentally looked over at what I perceived as a strange motion around the toilet area...

Hispanic dude had taken a shit and when he wiped, he half stood up and dove down between his legs to wipe his ass back to front, repeatedly. Then the next Hispanic dude did that too... is this normal? Asking for a friend...

This. Autists will options are gonna get chucked for weeks on theta
You keep bringing up "insurance" which is a simple way of saying some options trades are tied to stock trades. But then that money is in stocks, not in the price if the option. Options, exclusive of any underlying shares, is entirely zero sum. There is one party and one counterparty to every options trade. The fact that a market marker might then offset the sale of an option to make themselves delta neutral doesn't change the fact that the option they sold will change in value and whatever they lose the other party will win, and vice versa.
Poopschtick
we will see look like it move already started best is to enter when the red line above 0.8-0.9 on the graph so top traders have already gotten in
Idk man Halloween in Austin was crazy. I was driving for Uber that night making over $50/hr
Makes sense why they were welcomed into China with open arms and able to operate without any taxation like is typical for foreign automakers. Eron finks he sooo smart. I can see China being the reason tesla takes a tumble of they ever do. Its their invading Russia in the winter.

They have to abandon gasoline and focus their engineers on EV vehicles. Or invest heavily in the sector to stay competitive and on par with companies that are solely EV.
You‚Äôre gonna lose a lot of money and then make a lot of money.
Valid argument. Could be seasonal or could be a paradigm shift of shopping. I think it'll signal a paradigm shift; near term options probably aren't the right play but once it's evident that people prefer to shop at home post pandemic it'll drive past ATHs.

Wouldn't be surprised if Zillow is losing money doing it. 

Opendoor utilizes a proprietary technology approach to price homes. If they were ripping people off, they wouldn't be getting consistently good reviews and really positive NPS scores comparable to NFLX and others and growing rapidly. Opendoor arbitrages the cost a seller would have to bear by doing repairs/renovations, hiring a listing agent (5-6% of the home value right off the top), and going through a 90 day process to sell your home (which then you incur thousands of dollars in mortgage, taxes, and maintenance costs while you wait for your home to sell). Note Opendoor generates low gross margins (5-6%) which tells you they are not ripping people off. While margins are low, the market is so massive that the ultimate profit opportunity is substantial. 

If Opendoor captures 10% of the home market share, that would equate to $130B in annual revenue, $5-$10B in annual EBITDA, and a $100-$200B enterprise value (compared to about $5-$10B value today). 

Opendoor generates positive contribution margin on their business - they do not yet have enough volume to cover fixed overhead but that is anticipated in the next 3-5 years.

Personally, I would roll any January calls that are over 20c out if we don't move up substantially this coming week (estimates from crayon magicians are that we will sit between 12.something and 13.5 for the week).  I have a pile of 30cs, but those are going to start getting eaten by the greeks soon. Holding onto everything 20c and below for now

They are the PERFECT play going into a continued economic downturn - banks aren't lending and restricting credit but after lockdowns people want to travel and buy nice things though they cannot afford it. Plus their Peloton partnership has been wildfire. I am going heavy into them and am a user across multiple retailers since it is 0% interest for most of them. They even expanded into airlines recently.
So much potential for tendies. Sad...... wait, theyre blowing it all on tendies. Fuckers.

Or, in stock terms: It's options with an expiration date that is AT LEAST 1 year from the day you purchased it. Not 1 month. Not "next year", when it's November and you purchase one expiring in January 2021.

If they are at the money or ITM, they behave almost like the stock in price movement. There are some nice perks about them:

* Sometimes you'll actually have a positive small percent gain on a day where the stock had a small negative day
* Since they are so far out, once they are ITM, they have a good instrisic value
* They are much cheaper than purchasing the underlying stock in a block of 100 (of course, you can lose the entire premium)
*There stood a strange cabin made of toothpicks and honey*  
*Where lived a country boy named JOHNNY B MONEY*

Dudes easily maxing the 401k and spillover to a post tax brokerage, likely after max cont to a roth ira and possibly hsa too. The 300 is out if his post tax brokerage fun account
Didn't Tesla basically steal that software in the first place?
How long you boys think this EV craze bubble goes?
You think I sleep. Nice joke you got there.
Fuk brah keep it under 400k so biden dont take yo money fam
In 2020 tesla only had 1/10 of the top selling EVs world wide. Your statement is actually very true. Why would the legacy automakers care the last ten years when EVs accounted for less than 1% of global vehicles sales. You think Ford and gm, makers of the highest selling cars in the world, are going to shift resources overnight to even bother with it? Maybe if they told them they could have been a meme stock they would have done differently but theres no way they are changing entire drivetrains for 1% . Now because of legislation there's real motivation to enter the space. 145 new EVs are launching in 2020/2021. Elon been winning at a game no one else has even bothered playing until now.

good point. maybe they were waiting for more complete data?

Thanks for the advice.
Bro stfu up about SPI and be a man and buy $BABA
High score is in dollars, not %. Remember what game you are playing. But I get your point.
yeah ACB easy 10k
If its near a power line you might be able to complain to the power company and have it cut down.  I  had a tree that was way too close to my house but the power company cut it down because it was also a risk to the power lines.  saved me 3500 dollars.
Yessir!  Inst started rolling in, in force during the big election dip so I don't think it really matters that much, but retail can and has moved the needle on this one before

Family member of mine drives long haul for UPS. They can bid on there-and-back runs or do work in the yard moving trailers all day. They took a yard work run and have been regularly getting into 60 hours a week making time and a half ($50-$60/hour) in the last few hours of each shift. They said they are usually very reluctant to allow this and pay that much but right now, they are practically begging them to stay late.

The question though: Is this priced in? Will the stock actually make a move upward due to a seasonal demand while it's been hovering around it's ATH? My guess is, if it does, it won't be by much.

You son of a bitch I‚Äôm in
Their technology sounds like something that could make money. My buddy who is very competant got a job there. Based on that I bought 100 shares at 2.22. Im not exactly a sophisticated investor but im up 50% on those.

Ok great, thanks man.  I got a Jan 2023 $215 so I think I‚Äôll enable level 3 now and sell like a 220 for friday.  So the leap would be the collateral then? I don‚Äôt need 100 shares or the cash to cover 100 shares right?

Tesla's whole upbringing was touting the car of the future for people that hate cars and driving and its like an appliance and mirrors your phone and blah blah blah. Oh how the turn tables.
That‚Äôs 17% short of what you should have put into it

500 shares of tesla. Docu options since april, PTON options since june. Everything still in play, check my profile for pix
Looks like you are betting TSLA to take a dump next week

Vroom vroom. Stonk go VROOM. i cleek crawll on robeenhoodah
Yes, Zillow and Redfin are trying to get in the space. 

Opendoor has 65% market share and has been on a huge growth ramp. They slowed down and saw a COVID decline (as they pulled out of the market due to uncertainty) but are now back in it. 

Tight housing inventory has been the case for the last 3-5 years and hasn't stopped their growth - there are something like 5-6mm homes sold a year and they are only at 20K / year at this point. Less than 2% share in the markets they are already in.
The stock is up a lot in the last week, but thats following a month long skid.  My feeling/hope is that the previous highs allow room to continue running up.  

Plus, revenues being what they are would seem to warrant setting new highs.
What is the actual deal with FTIV anyone know who they are looking to acquire/merge with?  There‚Äôs got to be a rumor no blank check company goes up 100% without a catalyst.
FCEL is the next meme stock. gonna run to 10 next week
Friday I jumped on BABA randomly. Obviously I knew about the company but never bought into it. Up 133% by end of day.
we didnt moon when it came out before because it doesnt matter

I think, from what I‚Äôve read, you have time to get into Fisker.  Still very young with majority of their fleet not expected to debut until 2022 from what I‚Äôve read.  I could be wrong though.
50, and don't be gauche about it.  Nobody likes new money.
Who's heavy in TWLO? Big ups for ZM Friday but TWLO needs to move.
Telos is not in the same business as Palantir. They are in the cybersecurity and cloud biz. That being said, I have almost $40k (2000 shares) of Telos. With cloud data becoming increasingly important to society, Telos has and will continue to grow at 30% YoY or more, and they are just now breaking a profit, too.

No options (yet), no meme shit. In for a steady upward ride over the next three years.
Idk man buy some NIO or something

Bought in ASO at open, sold the other day at around ~17. I'm not sure if I want to get back into them, tho. Do I think they will be $20+? Yes. But I'd rather YOLO on things I actually don't know anything about.
The more posts I see here about pltr the more I believe I have made a mistake putting 83% of my portfolio in it.
I sure hope so
My 1/15 70cs are -90%...
I mean if you look at Zillow they lose like $40k a house when you add in all the tech and marketing costs.

Supply is really constrained too and it‚Äôs not coming back anytime soon. They don‚Äôt have houses to buy. Plus their business relies on lowballing sellers in order to make a decent margin when they sell. If sellers are in control and not totally desperate I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd pick the Opendoor offer.

Try going short. I see trumps stupid ass shenanigans crashing the market come January. Him and his cronies are fucking things up on purpose
I will say Webull‚Äôs customer service is literally nonexistent. Took me four emails and four weeks to get a response on some technical issue w a deposit. Never using them to trade again. 

That being said the UI is fucking BEAUTIFUL. I use it purely as my watchlist app.
Around $18k and took out over $20k. So this only profit, probably why the graph is negative.
I'm on the fence here. They are much more mature company compared to NIO. Their products are already sold all over the world, including America.

I guess my only gripe is that they don't really have any technological or economic moats. Electric scooters are not that hard to make. If they become popular someone else will just make a copy. At that point it just becomes a war of pricing attrition and expensive marketing campaigns.

NIO, Tesla, Xpev, on the other hand still have a lot of challenges ahead of them. Who will unlock the next milestone in battery efficiency? The first fully automated auto taxi? Or maybe even clean hydrogen? Each of these milestones can unlock untold potentials in the stock.

Not saying you can't make money in NIU. I still might buy some. But given a choice between money here or money in other more transformative companies I'd have to think more closely about it.

Honestly didn't read the whole thing because I probably know/agree with most of it, but based on the tone I'm going to throw this in.

&#x200B;

Current management is actually really good.  They are making tons of right moves and the stock is going way up from here with or without Cohen.  Cohen getting involved would of course be ideal, and would take the company to the next level very quickly, but it is still a beautiful stock to own even if he bounces.

Edit: I probably will come back and read later, but I'm exhausted and have a huge migraine atm, lol

I'd say it's priced in at this point. Dick's isn't doing anything new to warrant a real jump. 

If there's a similar competitor I'd look into, it's ASO (Academy Sports and Outdoors). Dick's is the Target version, ASO is the Walmart. ASO also sells guns and ammo.

Do you not think there is good reason for that? Software is eating everything thing my dude. Bits scale so much better than atoms. The biggest tech companies have so much cash on hand their biggest problem is figuring out how to spend it.

Think about product cycles. Bits allow you to iterate towards profits much, much faster. FB ships new code multiple times a day. Tesla ships updates to cars they‚Äôve already sold, sometimes charging a premium for new premium features.

The fact that explosive growth demands a much higher premium is an obvious extension of bits based vs atoms based companies.

The company planned to IPO @ 75-85. Instead the IPO range raised it to 120, and then on the day of opening, it went to 245 giving it an insane market cap. Many retail traders like you and me wanted to buy in and had set a lower price target but none of them got it, it was all bought up by institutional investors.

PLTR, imo
It'll be play-doh when I'm done.
What is the PT to you? I have no idea what that company does but chart seems interesting
At this point people would be buying GME on dips. The volume finally showed up and a nuclear holocaust couldn‚Äôt stop the shopping season.
Yeah I feel you, but you can‚Äôt eat IRR and I‚Äôm not willing to put large amounts of capital at risk when I don‚Äôt need to
looking forward to the next update post from the guy that YOLOd GME now
361C 11/23. I‚Äôm scared lol

Nice brah. What kinda positions do you play?

Meme it out bro ! And don‚Äôt forget to rotate your tendies back to SPI also for a pre break out stock ! I‚Äôm in with you on FCEL as well
I can see when you learned to buy options AND when you learned to trade options. Big difference lol nice job
Half of my portfolio, 1k shares for me at 18.20, but honestly you throwing pearls at swine. 

RKT will grow to $40 or 50 a share in a couple years, but since it has not gone full retard meme +1000% in 3 months since going public, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù stock for WSB.

Thanks for the advice I will make it to at least thanksgiving. End goal is to go a year without it and reboot my brain‚Äôs perversion. I really want to and need to change
Check back in around late December. We‚Äôll see if you still feel the same way.
I truly believe GM will emerge a winner in the EV market but by 12/24 seems risky. Anyways, good luck.
Baba
When u deposit another 20k
Dollar amount is meaningless. % is everything. It's insane how many people don't realize this.

Erry damn day some gain post gets pushed to the front page of WSB because someone made $50k in a day or some shit, but it's like a 5% gain on a $1m in leaps.

It's like, cool, you have a lot of money. But you can make 5% in 5 minutes with options, so it ain't really front page worthy. 


Anyway well done bro.
Mother fuck... ok, buying more on Monday.
Anyone here yolod on Spy?
FCEL on Monday.  Who‚Äôs with me?
Pretty sure the point he's making is that you can easily make way more than 1% safely, more like 5-7, which is easy living money.
Finally someone on this sub who understands that pumping up retarded options calls on Chinese EV stocks that don‚Äôt even have a product let alone a profit is not a long term strategy

The fundamental business proposition of a GME is from a time when kids were leading their parents into something new. They were a retail brand that made it easier for kids and parents to connect. Problem: those kids are now the parents. They don‚Äôt need a GME to provide brand confidence. GME has been obsoleted not only by online but by also by a change in their customers. They‚Äôre infinitely more sophisticated about it all now. Nobody needs this type of middleman to explain or provide anything any more.

Well first of all, Warren B or Lil war is a fellow genius of mine but what he does not take into account is that the market have changed from a market of wall street guys to autist that THINK they are wall street guys.

It shouldn't if you have been paying attention. PLTR is about the long calls, continuing to roll them as they inevitably assimilate the rest of the federation.

I learned this lesson much cheaper than you did. Take a screen shot and send your gains after you sell. 

I had 10 puts that dropped during February and I got all excited because I made like 2k in a minute. But then I missed out and sell 8 of the 10 because I took time to dance and take screen shots.

Fuck, is this going to fuck up my calls?
Yeah it really doesn't make sense. Once I built a gaming PC over a decade ago, apart from Steam, I'd get the odd console game from Amazon because it's faster and has deals. Controllers, chargers, a clip for my PSP? All from Amazon. There certainly is a niche market for that stuff but BestBuy could steal that thunder whenever they wanted to.

 I think they need to pivot, give up physical games and start doing everything but games - sell soundtracks, artwork, collector's items, accessories, and vintage stuff like arcade machines and upgrades, board games, card games. They can even keep consoles because that's usually what brings people in, and really build out the Game Trading as a Service model, put out an app that let's some guy here arrange a trade with some guy over there. Partner with Steam and Sony/MS and setup some way to trade and share digital games copies. But alas, that's too huge a pivot for a dinosaur like this to pull off.

Can you point me to the fair value of their R&M assets on their statements? All I saw was cost. 

The R&M segment produces ~$3B from $9B in assets. Highly doubt these assets are worth $9B? The fact that IAS has a revaluation method is irrelevant to our discussion.

Cool to hear you get paid! I hope you don‚Äôt talk to clients like this.

You're still talking about put spreads right? It sounds like you don't quite understand what writing a put does if you think having shares will affect it.

Remember that selling a put means you guarantee the guy on the other side that you will buy 100 more shares at the strike price. So it doesn't matter how many shares you have, to secure that put you just need the cash to buy all those shares as collateral.

Generally companies have a compliance team which has policies on employee personal trading. Depending on the company, if it‚Äôs too strict you might loose your job if you do not follow the rules. Trading does not mean you will make profits and there is risk of losses. So don‚Äôt be in a hurry check with HR and only start trading. Stock market is not going anywhere and neither are you.

It's hidden in your post that GM is entering the EV game late. It's beyond slapping a battery in a car in existing models and deeming it an EV. And converting GM existing auto plants to rapidly produce EVs is an illusion of a catch up strategy. This is not turnkey. 

GM lack of R&D in previous years relative to Tesla will forever haunt them in the form of lost market share. It's the software, chip and transition to a whole new auto segment in autonomous driving. This is why Tesla is not valued as a typical auto company. Yes, this is sounding clich√© but it'll be clearer as the years go by. GM is in the 1st inning, Tesla 8th inning 

Tesla has solidified a first mover advantage and unsure if prospective buyers will buy a GM at the same price point as Tesla. This will esp be the case when a $25K Tesla is released. This is just car buying. As mentioned there's more hurdles. FWIW the Hummer EV is a mere design and literally an inoperable EV atm

Ok, that's right, Z is less than Y but the delta on this new sale is profit for you, PLUS the underlying stock gets you profit. So you can keep doing this process until you're comfortable selling the underlying. And, you should be able to do the exact same using LEAPS as the underlying

No joke here. Do your DD on PLTR. Don‚Äôt just look at their charts, look at their contracts, look at their business practices, understand that you‚Äôre looking at the future. 

We‚Äôre riding this to the moon. Get in.
Nah this would just give Congress a chance to try and break up fb for censoring free speech lol
The use of the word "rocket" in the context of where PLTR is going scares me.

You guys remember RKT? The company that was supposed to be $23113212 one week after IPO? Many bag holders on that one. Thank Lucifer I didn't go balls to the walls on that one, like I have on PLTR....
Position?
memes will be reality
I expect a general IV decline in major indices, but not as rapidly as the last two weeks in which we saw VIX futures curves, yield curves, and IV in various equities options out for several months shift drastically.

This is a wild guess. IV in various indices and equities is difficult for me to get a feel on at this point compared to a few weeks ago. Index volatility and IV seem to be diverging from equity spot vol and IV.

Plus, retail is bidding up prices like crazy (but now in specific names) and even watching UOA. Najarian can mention an option, Will Meade can tweet, or WSB can spam one and the prices erupt within seconds.

So, my wild guess is IV for indices trends down relative to the equities in the indices, but I think IV in some equities is generally cheap at the moment (like TSLA a few days ago when I picked up calls and spreads out to 2022), and we will see another massive IV increase with underlying price increases in some names that have been neglected since the same thing occurred in September.

Thanks for the correction bruh. lol. üòéüëç
TSLA doesn't have LIDAR. It has shit image sensors.
Haha man idk if we‚Äôll see it in months or years, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in shares and not options. Good luck!
Thanks for the video. I've seen it previously and took it as speculation. The most liked comment also points this out. The hummer's timeline has shifted with COVID and such, but GM is a well established company (unlike NKLA).
ZM is either going up or down on Monday. 

Either direction I‚Äôm buying weeklies for the gap up to 500

Bought 1/15 300c on BABA about 1.5 weeks ago when it tanked after ANT IPO debacle.  Got scared when it kept dipping and went down -23% and bailed.  

Waited a little bit and saw BABA starting to go back up, and then reinitiated 1/15 calls at @ 275 strike this time.  Baba then started to immediately dip again to the 250s and I bailed again for a loss.  

Got frustrated with BABA and decided to avoid after the WSJ article about Xi making Ma his bitch. I then rolled what I had left into TSLA after the S an P 500 addition. Bought Dec 460C when the stock hit 450. As soon as I open the stock starts dipping to high 430s and I bail because I thought it was gonna get dragged down by MM trying to get in for a cheap price.  Literally the next day after bailing TSLA goes full parabolic to where it is now. Now fuckin BABA is gonna go back to 300.  Fuck fuck fuck. Dont gotta inverse WSB. Just gotta inverse me. I would have raked if I had diamond hands.
I've been in for 3000 shares since last year (avg. cost $13). Regret not buying more as it dipped in the $8 range, but already reached my targeted exposure. Thankfully been selling covered calls and collecting the dividend in the meantime so I am only down $3000 or so (planning on loss harvesting after the ex-dividend). I'll then buy back in and hold at least another year to see if the turnaround plays out.

They can sustain the dividend and pay down debt pretty comfortably, so no real risk of this going to $0 anytime soon. Debt is cheap, and refinancing their current debt can save them $300M+ per year on its own (which they've started doing this past year).

If they do manage to turn around things they could easily be $20/share, but obviously lots of concerns around the health of their revenue streams. Fiber is extremely valuable, but not to the regular consumer yet and there will be widespread 5G internet from other providers for half the cost soon. The irony is that 5G internet relies on Fiber backhaul, but the economics don't favor the fiber provider nearly as much. 

Enterprise and smb is the big opportunity here, so I'm just going to keep collecting my dividend while writing OTM monthlies. At this point the biggest loss is the opportunity cost for me - and the asymmetry of returns is attractive enough.
The bear, it's coming from *inside the rectum!*
I am sorry but you are quite wrong in interpreting the standards. You can revalue above and are required to (less depreciation and what not). If it is revalued in excess of its depreciation and impairment charges (and previous revaluation prior to this revalue), then the impact goes to OCI. Once in OCI, you can elect for a transfer directly to retained earnings. 

Anyways, I normally get paid for this shit so I'm not going to continue to entertain your shit accounting knowledge. 

The second point is more important to the analysis. If they are or have taken impairment charges to their refinery at any time recently, then you are categorically wrong in saying their FV is much > than their BV. Recall that you consider value in use and fv before booking impairment. I'm trying to find source that they took impairment for certain on the refinery, but if they did literally throw your analysis out of the window. 

For more points, see my initial response. Your head isn't in the totally wrong place but you're not realizing the macro factors for an undiversified oil company. Running an oil company now is like being a traditional auto maker...still big demand? Sure. Certainty of less demand in the future? Undeniably yes. Until they diversify they will not get a moonshot. Their best hope is oil goes back, they get more stability in their main line, then branch into alternative and green energy.
lol well if it goes down you'd win still?

Has the news being dropped or it will ideally be dropped on Monday? I yolod into spy
The share buying spree by these index tracker funds has only just begun volume has been up but nowhere near where it needs to be to match Tesla's size when it gets included.

The only thing pushing Tesla down now is funds having to sell Tesla shares after hours because the increase in value has caused the position in the funds to become too large.
okay yes makes a lot of sense. When do you think recovery could come in? I was thinking like april/summer with springbreak etc etc. well hoping for the best for both of usüòÇ
Lol nah this is basic as hell, level 4 is typically naked options sales.

You're not naked since your (hopefully ITM leap) is higher delta than your sold option.

Calls on UPS/FedEx

Everyone knows Black Friday is going to suck this year but I think Cyber Monday will be unprecedented. UPS and FedEx have been hiring a fuck ton. I am on a UPS training route and we have a new driver every week. I haven't seen my wife's boyfriend / father of my children (UPS man) in months until a week ago and he spilled the beans on how busy it is and how busy they think it's going to be. I showed him pictures of his kids. A lot of people are struggling economically but many more people aren't struggling economically and this year on Cyber Monday they're gonna buy a bunch of dumb shit to make up for how shitty this year has been and make Christmas 'special'.
Make it happen, Zuck. I'll keep calling you ü§° until you do.
The very possibility of good news is the catalyst. Any good word about the ant IPO would be huge.

Technically they all "only risk your initial investment"... unless you retardedly buy a spread with inherent risk skew. Aim for 1:1 risk or better...
I love your bullishness, but there is just no way.  A huge part of why those %s are so high are from synthetic longs.  A stock can go over 100% short interest, but it can't go over 100% stock ownership, which it would based on the numbers shown.  Also liquidity, we had 70+ million share trade days in october

&#x200B;

Really though, even if it were possible, the low case scenario on this is so incredible, going conservative is probably better, disappointed retail investors panicking is why we fell so hard from 15

I don't see GM surpassing Tesla anytime soon, or frankly anytime in the future. Tesla makes the best EVs and will continue to. I'm a firm believer in the company and will keep my Model 3 forever. That said, GM shows promise in both design and battery development- something lots of new companies lack. GM is already established within the automobile industry, so the transition to a 40% electric vehicle fleet with 27B means they are positioned to enter the market in a strong way.

Last Friday when Nio dumped, I bought as many 0dte Nio calls as I could afford, about $1 OTM, and managed to time the bottom perfectly. They were super cheap, so even though the stock only recovered a tiny bit, I doubled my portfolio value in about 20 minutes.

Unfortunately I have most my money in a robinhood account, so this was done in my TD Ameritrade account which is much smaller. 

I look forward to doing some day trading with  0dte options on robinhood, since they're the most bang for your buck, and I'm not planning on holding them overnight anyway.

Whoever was asking yes we are bullish on BABA as well . There isn‚Äôt a catalyst yet but based on the chart and possible reversal on a lot of volume this tells me that this may be a new support / inflection point because of volume at the is level . I think we see some fomo and IV Increase along with the price in the next few weeks and then maybe we hear from jack ma a possible catalyst .
How do you just check the current general market trend? What do you look at?

Both companies can be insanely profitable dominating their own countries.

I just looked up the chart on RHT because I remember telling my dad to buy the IPO. It went $40 to over $100!

Then down to $4. Oof. 

Eventually climbed back to $187 in 2019 & was bought out by IBM, but if you bought at the IPO peak you were bagholding for...17 years? Brutal.

Excellent choice. The margin requirements should be definite. Do you have margin enabled? What did the Margin Summary look like when you held both stocks and a spread? The Net Liquidation Value should have counted against your Margin Requirement afaik.

I think we consolidate to December 10-12, when the vaccine gets approved for emergency use AND congress has its last chance to extend Feds programs in the omnibus spending bill. 

If McConnell drags his feet and doesn‚Äôt extend, market goes down. 

When Vaccine gets emergency approval from FDA, big spike, maybe a day or two. 

Conclusion: 3730 on vaccine spike, then to 3430 after no stimmy in omnibus bill and turkey day COVID surge.
Pretty sure they announced an EV subsidiary and everyone went bonkers

SPI warrants are trading around $26 . I think based on the chart and technical we can easily see $20 by the end of the month on SPI . Super low float , and a great chart set up. Tons of accumulation and basing going on . Finally broke out .

They‚Äôre actually not very complicated at all. Just watch a video, it‚Äôll explain things better than any Reddit comment.
Most of my selling was after the initial rebound in like mid April, just wanted to take profit after it ran from 7 ‚Äî> 18 iirc. I thought RCL and CCL both had a higher chance of folding, but that would have probably caused a sell off for all cruise lines. Now that we have a pretty good idea of when vaccines will be rolled out, it looks to be a safer recover play than it did a few months ago. I‚Äôm still holding a few hundred shares because of this, and if there was any significant dip I‚Äôd probably pick up more

Correct
Spreads as well. Just close them before they expire
I love all of you 20$ Monday or I‚Äôm committing
Correct! Though if you‚Äôre messing with 0dte, be careful about time decay. Also since you‚Äôre working purely with gamma any move in the other direction will eat your premium up. I‚Äôve been trading 0dte profitably for awhile and at most I‚Äôll hold those suckers for a few minutes.

Delta = whenever a stock moves $1 the contract changes that much, example stock moves up $1 and delta is .25 the contract goes up $25

Theta = how much the contract loses value every day, ex Theta -0.15 loses $15 a day

Gamma is how much it'll change delta up or down depending where the stock price goes example delta is .25 gamma is .10 if the stock goes up 1 point gamma is added to delta making it .35

Vega is how much the contract value increases or decreases per 1% in the implied volatility ex. Implied vol is at 100% if it goes up 1% to 101% and Vega is .05 then you gain $5 on the contract

Rho.... dont worry about this greek

Implied volatility= IV = is how volatile the stock is and affects Vega based on volume
So buying not writing

There is far too much of 'you need a college degree to succeed" non-sense directed at kids.   something like 30% of all college graduates are psychology and sociology  majors.   And they re just about totally useless.  Also if you are doing internships or undergrad research or something other than the classes you will not get hired doing the thing you studied.  Almost no chance.  No guidance consular will ever tell you that because their job is to get you to graduate not to help you get a job. 

My cousin makes like 90k a year repairing jets on a two year AA degree + some training from her job.    Lots of people go to college because it is the thing you are supposed to do but with no plan or ambition.  Honestly if you had to write an 800 word essay about your plans for after college to get student loans it would make that program about 1000% more efficient.

Yes you'd buy to open a call option. If it goes up then you sell to close for a profit. If it goes down, you sell to close for loss. 

Shares and options are two different classes of securities. The "do not own" only applies to trading securities of the same class. You can buy and sell TSLA options without ever owning TSLA shares.

There is no risk, the caveat is if the strike you sell is in the money on the expiry date and you haven‚Äôt bought it back you will have to close the longer leg. Which should be fine because at that point it should be profitable as well. Spreads are tools to cap your gains/losses (limits your downside but your upside as well) and are a great thing to learn about.

This is a low float stock that has been basing / accumulating last few weeks , should push higher next week easily based on technicals alone .

Stocks are regulated so you can‚Äôt buy and sell as part of the same trade. Theoretically you could make multiple accounts and try to do it but it would be linked to your social security number and also most stocks have way too much volume so you would end up trading against Goldman Sachs or something

With shitcoins, you can literally place a sell order at a certain price and then place a buy order and buy it. This allows for easy market manipulation by ‚Äúwhales‚Äù

Nah, these loans are being tossed out to 18 yr old kids with no credit check.

If you can get in, the student loan will cover the cost no questions asked.

Hey, brother. Welcome back. 

SPX options traders have been backfilling collars at major strikes (3600P, 3550P, 3750C, 3800C) into the next major OPEXs. Huge put walls may prevent passing through 3500. These large OI put positions will be Vanna'ed and Charmed out of existence as IV trends down and time passes, causing a slow melt up if buyers and sellers are evenly matched. 

We might be pushed through major put walls by institutions on thinly traded futures, but /ES 3-week positioning change was a fairly historic -26 billion. One positive catalyst and we'll see a major short-covering futures rally (again) pushing us yet higher.  

Counterpoints: large equity portfolio rebalancing to the tune of a couple hundred billion may have not occurred already, and negative news catalysts are a huge wildcard.
No spreads in a cash account- ouch. Good luck going long calls and puts only.
Would be nice, but it probably won't, and whether it does or doesn't it doesn't make a big difference to investors long term. Especially with fractional shares these days. 

Long $amzn for me, here are my reasons: https://youtu.be/TY7DKSlon90

It's not just about Financials with Amazon. The company does things differently and is such a unique bunch of companies under a single umbrella.
A lot have already semi pumped tbh, Cinemark was my value buy move but I missed the pump went from $8 to $14.5 in a couple weeks. It was $30 before covid though, so still has room to grow. October was the last chance to buy value at an extreme discount I think.

Yeah, bro. Middle school was the time I discovered it too. I‚Äôm 35 and very successful based on outward appearances. It‚Äôs been my biggest skeleton and ongoing specter/challenge of my life. I often wonder how much more successful I‚Äôd be if I never got involved with this shit as it really fucks with your motivation.

I think student loans should be forgiven for the top 10% scholastic achievers, plenty of people already don't take college seriously even though they have loans to pay off. I'd be pretty pissed if the workforce was diluted with free college grads who never had any stakes in their decision

I would recommend fully understanding margin requirements when doing this. They can definitely require the cash equivalent of 100 shares. Sounds like you might be using Robinhood. If so I would strongly encourage you to choose another broker for options. Professional brokers have strict rules for both themselves and you, based upon explicit margin requirements. Another note, due to recent volatility in the markets, most brokers have significantly increased their margin requirements. 

For real brokers, they should recognize the spread and not require any margin over max loss. A percentage of your held sotcks value should count as 'marginable securities'. If you are using a real broker, you need to read and understand their margin disclosures. It is not easy, but is very important. I would expect you could call them to discuss and ask questions as well.
Use potential profit from leaps to lose it on FD's
Buy to open = it means you start the trade as a buyer (aka going long). Its the same logic as buying shares of a stock. 
You exchange your cash for a security (stocks and options are called securities). Ideally the security will go up in value at some point.

Sell to close = this is when you close a long position. So you already owned shares/options, and now you want to exchange them for cash. Ideally the securities went up in value and you are now taking your profit.

Sell to open/Buy to Close = this is when you do not own the stock/option, but you want to exchange it for money (aka going short). So instead of spending your own money to purchase the security, you will receive a payment upfront for the sale of a security you do not own. Because you don't own the security but you sold it to someone, it means at some point in the future you need to deliver the security to the person you sold it to. In order to deliver the security, you would buy to close. Ideally you buy to close at a lower price than you sold it for.

so you are against any bail outs? You assume that forgiving people of 200 plus dollars a month for over a million people wont benefit the economy greatly. YEs the US deficit will rise but fuck if we can give out help to big corporations then why the fuck not bail out the people as well.

Buy to open --> creates a positive +1 position

Sell to close ---> closes out what you open to go to 0

Sell to open --> sells the position putting you at -1  
Buy to close ---> closes out what you got open to go to 0

If you are wondering why someone would sell to open, it basically means they are taking an opposite view of what someone buying to open would be thinking.

You know what? GameStop was the middleman before digital games were released on major gaming platforms. 

I think that they have missed their chance or a great portion of the market in failing to ramp up their e-commerce presence. Like another comment stated, they have become or a close to become blockbuster. 

While I do give credit to them for somewhat-trying to stay alive, I think they need to open their fucking eyes. They need to look at 10-15 years from now and ask themselves if they truly think GME will be alive.

Man I just don‚Äôt see it. The only real market for this from an e-commerce perspective is hardware (console, controllers, headsets). I‚Äôd imagine the lionshare of that market cap estimate is in the purchase of actual games which is dominated by the PlayStation network and comparable direct platforms for Xbox, steam, etc. How long before those platforms offer e-commerce for the hardware side?

As an avid gamer I just don‚Äôt see an e-commerce push helping gme.

TO THE PEOPLE SAYING AMAZON IS ALREADY THE AMAZON OF THE VIDEO GAME WORLD: 



Amazon: I'm a customer, and customer is always #1! So lets try before we buy! We'll buy the game, play it for 30 min, and return it because because we can and this is amazon. 




Gamestop: You want to return this $59.99 game that you bought from us 2 days ago? 

Oh, you meant *sell it back to us*

Sure, I can give you $3.84







Yes, amazon has a "restocking fee" for video games, up to 100%. 

But have you ever tried returning shit on amazon? 

Do you think they'll know if something is activated or played? 

Most importantly, do you think amazon gives a fuck about the businesses selling on amazon? (in this case, the game makers?) 


I sell on amazon too, and I believe me, I get some silly ass returns. Returns with shit missing. Brand new - "I don't want this any more or I ordered it by mistake" type returns, where that shit looks used. Returns where they use the item past the return period, and as a retailer you're at the customers mercy anyways - because the pain of a bad review is not worth whatever value of the product. 


Don't get me wrong, Amazon is still awesome too - because sales are much easier to acquire and most amazon ppc advertisers suck ass, in comparison to fb/ig/pinterest/etc... 


But think about bottom line. My autistic guess is that if I were a video game retailer, my bottom line is better just using amazon for visibility and gme to make the sales. 







Look, whatever you want to do - all you boo - and I wish you luck. 

**Just know, I'm just an autistic guy shilling gamestop, trying to do my part for any other autistic brethren in here waiting for gamestop to make them bigly, disgusting, orgasmic amounts of tendies.**

Bro thanks for the meme you made my day
so in that scenario, you sold your $20 call for X premium, and then later you rolled it to a $21 call for Y premium, which nets YOU (Y - X). In my head this scenario has Y being lower than X every time, which means you have to burn money every time you do this. Is that not the case?   

I hold gme shares and I'm confident they will rocket above 20 at some time in the future. So I don't want to sell calls because I'll lose that potential. So if I sell $15c for a month from now and it hits $16 next week, will the IV have gone up enough that I can roll the 15c to 20c and still make money? 

 I guess I'm not considering the fact that as you keep rolling the calls higher your underlying stock gets more and more valuable so while I'm not happy selling at $15 I WOULD be happy spending say .50 in premium to sell at $20 later?
Good
Friday lottos
Not suggesting anything, but in this case it would be cash secured. If you have enough money for 100 shares, and want to buy a stock, you can just sell a put. If it gets executed, you now own the stock you wanted anyway, plus the premium. If not, the put expires, you keep the premium and you do it again. Problems are: stock plummets and you have to buy it for more than its worth, but supposedly you would have bought it and held anyway. Problem 2, stock skyrockets and you only made the premium on your put sell. So you generally want to do this with more conservative stocks you want to hold for a long time. This is part of "the wheel" strategy, that I dont necesarily endorse, but its good to understand. I have started doing this with stocks I see as trending within a stable volatility band, selling puts near the bottom of the band.

What I've heard called lotto plays.  If you can grab an option on something moving in the last hour, cheap enough, the winners can pay out enough to cover the many losers doing this.

The way I've conceptualized that in my head is that it's the people taking the opposite trade to those who let OOTM spreads go into EXP on TSLA, SPY, ect and get wiped out once in a blue moon.
There is a metric fuckton of money to be made with this shitcoin run. RIOT is going to run to 40+ again when this shitcoin run starts picking up in mainstream media coverage. Calls like 2 months out now and puts when it it peaks at 30-40.

I worked at one of the companies early on that announced an IPO this past week (no longer there) üéâ

Yeah I like to talk about money with my friends and coworkers. It lets me know when to ask for a raise, how my salary compares to other industries, etc. I will ask most coworkers who I get close with how much they make and some will share and some prefer not to. And for options, my friends would probably be jealous over a large win but I text them anyway (no single win has been huge yet, but at my high point this year I had 90k accumulated winnings) ... so far no hint of annoyance or jealousy. Maybe I‚Äôm just autistic and cant detect it üò¨... but they also saw me lose 30k after that high point so maybe that helped lol
1. If you have shares and sell a CC and the shares don‚Äôt move, you make the premium
2. If you have shares and sell a CC which goes ITM, and you get called out you also make money.
3. If you have leaps that are ITM and sell a CC, it‚Äôs basically a calendar spread. You have tons of ways to close the position making money.
4. If you have shares, and sell a CC and it goes ITM, but you don‚Äôt want to lose the shares, you can roll the call you are short.

Example: this week I sold a CC against a stock I have called MPLX. They had a fantastic week and the CC went ITM. I believe the stock started around $19.59 and I sold weekly $20. The stock got close to $21 and I didn‚Äôt want to get called out, so I rolled the Nov 20 20c to a Dec 18 21c. Now that is ATM. This was basically an even exchange.

If MPLX continues to run, I probably let it get called, but if there‚Äôs even a little bit of a pullback I can buy the CC back cheaper or even roll it down to collect more premium.
[deleted]
Lol.

Every time I read about the outstanding revenue, partnerships, acquisitions and ass-kicking that RKT is doing in the mortgage industry I get really excited  and convinced that they will fly.  I then buy shares and options only to be disappointed.  Share price takes 1 step forward, and 2 steps back, Fuck RKT.  

Is this stock just not popular, or is there something bigger wrong with it?

Is it not the right time because of the impending defaults coming from COVID?

Is the amount of shares available keeping the price low?

What if the mystery company buffett is buying shares in is actually Tesla?

With so many other great return tech options, no one has any reason to buy RKT right now.  PLTR has had more than 100% return since IPO, RKT not even 15%, how about Tesla, NIO, Li, XPEV?  A bubble you say?  That‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll ride it up then down because at least bubbles move up, RKT is stagnant

Idk LEAPS are pricey as fuck but 1/15/21 is looking juicy $67.5 going for $2.42. I‚Äôve lost a shit ton on open calls though so I‚Äôll probably do a few spreads instead.

+$67.5C 1/15

-$72.5c 1/15

I‚Äôm buying Monday as long as it doesn‚Äôt rocket. Or tank. If it does I‚Äôm adjusting up or down.
You'll hit it one day
None of them were forced to do business in China.  Our CEOs knowingly and willingly chose to chase extra dollars by outsourcing labor to a foreign entity that doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of US law, rather than just kept everything in the US, and therefore, under US protection.  They're just paying the consequences for it.

Not a buyer of Gold - look at 2012. Had the exact same run up. Sure you might bounce off the bottom for what - 2-5%? Whew, my dick don't even move for that. It's not going to pass it's most recent top (again look at 2012)
myself and friends that i know have had their original delivery date pushed back. also i was not a fan of their delivery system. the guys kind of just showed up. no email or text the night before or day of. literally called and said were 5 minutes away (but they were within the two hour delivery time frame). things could just be smoother with more communication.

SEDG\* and I know of it because it's in ICLN, TAN and QCLN. It's not a bad price sub 300 and looks like it's beginning to pull back up. I still recommend these etf's so you don't eat a massive loss like when it dropped from 300 to 200. I recommend you take a look at their competitor Enphase (ENPH) too. They focus on personal all in one systems and micro inverters

So does this mean I could just buy .0001 shares of Tesla 100 times on Mon, sell on Tuesday. Buy .01 shares of Nio 100 times, sell on Wed. Rinse and repeat? 

Thats not how day trades work, plus no day trade when you sold the day after you bought big brain.
Just google zero sum and stop talking..
I‚Äôm impressed the screenshot is at the absolute peak this happens so often we should learn by now
Is this supposed to make money, or does the call you selling going itm always a losing scenario? Because rolling it would be buying it for more than you sold then selling another, which is going to be cheaper than you just paid. I guess you keep going forever until eventually one of the calls you sell expires worthless? It just seems like a really expensive way to make money with very high risk. If the stock keeps rising like mad you don't even get to profit because you keep selling calls. Why do this over just selling a spread?
Cramer loves BYND
Wait, you make money?
Same. $20 is a key support but if it does fall under, the low to mid $18s would be a great price to buy.
Well if I‚Äôm day trading on a margin account I obviously need quick settling of funds

No, tesla went 250 to 2500.
 Tesla is still at right about 2500


(they split shares 5x and it dipped but it's about 500 now, so 5x that is 2500 since you're retarded.

IBKR is my go to.  While Robinhood has zero commissions, their routing sucks and no analysis tools that I know of.  I could be wrong as I have never used it, but I haven't seen anything for it. I think the commissions are worth it for the products IBKR offer.

Edit:  I should caveat that with it depends on your account balance.  If it is low, use Robinhood until you build up 50k, then go to IBKR.
no no.. this retarded op has it right.. yes buy 0.00006 tesla 1000 times and then sell it the next day to avoid PDT.

i have 35k portfolio and i do exactly that to avoid pdt. that strategy works. i havent been marked as pdt since doing the 6% rule.  hes on the right track

True, but at this point, how much is the company directly affected by Ma's presence nowadays? I believe BABA's been oversold in reaction to the Ant IPO falling thru, and any future negative news regarding Ma will be oversold. If it happens (kinda fucked up to think about) that will be a good time to dip in and ride BABA back up because the company is overall still on solid ground IMO. That said, better play might be Alibaba competitors because retribution is more likely to come in the form of antitrust cases, and there's a handful of competitors like PDD that are already prepared to take a slice of the pie whether or not BABA gets slapped with antitrust charges.

Why is this a retarded question? It would work right? It‚Äôs just increasing my trading volume to day trade more.
Honestly with short interest and institutional ownership this high, a more realistic and less conservative price could be 10.000 or up to 50.0000 dollar per share, albeit briefly.

You can make a ton of money trading options the way quant funds trade options, but you will lose most of your money eventually if you just long calls and puts with no alpha.

I‚Äôm 30. A gain worth texting about would be like 5 to 10k I guess, with 90k accumulated gains at one point. Nothing too crazy. Same for loss. My friends all have decent paying jobs I guess so there isn‚Äôt any large inequity in wealth, except for one who makes significantly more than me. But I was the only one messing around with options during the post pandemic crash, made quite a bit and texted a few of them every time I had a green day, showed them my accumualted gains, none of them batted an eye. We talk about money a lot and know how much each other make.

The recent booming interest in it scares the crap out of me and makes me believe it is going to drop significantly soon. Always happens with meme stocks regardless of the quality of the company.

I'm going to buy once it gets under $15 again but not before that. The price doesn't reflect the value.
And ARK buying in also had no effect. The stock was basically flat/slightly up this week.

With the lockdowns, it's a bit iffy buying it in the next month or two in my personal opinion as they still will not generate revenue. Could be wrong though and the fact that we have vaccines may be enough. 

Issue w/ leaps on this one is that IV is pretty high, so you don't get that much leverage, but do take on a lot of risk. I'd do shares or ITM leaps

If OP is right, this flat ass action is due to the big boys keeping shares low while they accumulate. If OP is wrong, then it's due to the big boys preventing it from dropping further so they can sell off their shares. 

If they're accumulating, we might see a drop under $20 to get people to panic sell before the rise begins because there are likely a lot of stop losses right under $20.

It‚Äôs entirely possible for GME to be a premier gaming destination. You don‚Äôt need to take out Amazon, Target, or Wal Mart. You just need to be disruptive. Gaming is projected to be a $200b industry. What‚Äôs wrong with trying to be a $10b player in that world? The pet industry in North America is dominated by PetSmart and Petco. $7 and $3 billion in annual revenues respectively. Cohen comes along and over the course of about 7 years he turns Chewy into a $3 billion entity. So what happens? PetSmart buys them. GME can be that premier player, but it is going to take better management to do so. A younger, more digitally focused team. So, it will be interesting to see the CEOs response to Cohens letter. We will have a better picture of GMEs future with the upcoming earnings report and managements response to Cohen. Cohen didn‚Äôt send that letter, hire an M&A law firm that specializes in this situation, and amend his 13D filing to sit by idly and go ‚Äúoh well I tried‚Äù and sell his position. It doesn‚Äôt help that GME rarely puts out PR or news. He has a plan and is about to force something to happen. Unfortunately, depending on how management responds, it could get worse before it gets better.

Yup this happens. I had the same experience but came back after I started lifting and getting in good shape, getting a university degree and having a decent job. Seeing my old high school friends who are still working minimum wage jobs, no degrees and I instantly felt a shift in energy as they were more ‚Äúintimidated‚Äù from me and pretty much ghosted me not feeling like hanging out. At the time I was upset but you realize that there‚Äôs some people that just don‚Äôt want to see people advancing them and want them to maintain at their level.

As a key ingredient in the pie, may I suggest you look at Solaredge, SLDG. They make/dominate inverters, changing solar DC into AC. In a (domestic) PV setup, this is typically the first unit to need replacement/has the shortest warranty (five years v twenty+ for cells) = repeat sales. Stock in a bit of a sale itself atm.
Loving it. Trying to hold because momentum is to the upside. Limited selling as it breaks above whole and half dollar amounts. I would buy if it dips below 15.50 and start selling at around 25

There are three possible outcomes:

1) You take a 50% profit and see it run up 250%

2) You don't take a profit and see it plummet

3) There is no profit to begin with and you got fucked from the get-go.

I think you should not overextend your odds. Making a profit from buying an option is not a guarantee. In fact, option sellers are much more favored to win.
I tried to do that but I'm just as much of a pussy with the so-called YOLO account as I am with the "normal" account.
Give it another thousand. But this time be smarter, cut losses. Make safe plays. Don't do risky things like holding over weekends/fighting the trend. There is always a 10 bagger out there like every day. Just gotta find it.
Today it's scratchers, and in December it's casinos. Good luck!

Yep exactly and because of the length of these contracts I will still maintain theta value if I decide to exit early. And I don‚Äôt mind limiting upside (beyond my thoughts on value) to make this a cheaper trade. I don‚Äôt see CHGG going beyond 100 by April. But if it does I will still 3-4x my 1.5k that‚Äôs at risk here. This is by no means a yolo but my strategy is to have 3-4 high risk low capital plays to compliment my core holdings and theta plays.

If you buy a call, someone else is short that exact same call. Your call appreciates at exactly the same value dollar for dollar, cent for cent as the call someone else is short. The only loss is in the transaction fee itself to open and close the position through your broker.

All over really
I'm shooting in the dark here, but I'm going to guess anything nuclear power related. Oil/gas are being shunned fairly hard around the world and it isn't going to get reversed. Wind/solar isn't enough to supply the much higher demand of electricity caused by EV's and growing populations into more suburban areas. 

Obviously this kind of thing wouldn't happen in the US without some sort of removal of the restrictions surrounding nuclear, but once some of the red tape is peeled back, I think all nuclear power related companies will shoot up in value. 

As for right now - EVs, 5G, renewable energy, entertainment stocks in like 5 months (once the vaccine is out), gaming peripherals (CRSR, LOGI, RAZFF, HEAR), data storage... etc

Premiums are nice and juicy, and the US / China conflict volatility is prevalent. I think ZM earning won't be as much of a surprise as the last one. And NIO is built on a house of cards.
People keep talking about this Amazon company.... never heard of them
I hope you don't have call bags. It'll probably get better eventually.

Sir if your order is complete please drive to the next window
Most reasonable brokerages charge $0 per trade now (used to be like $5-10) and $0.65 per contract

Some are free per contract too but slower to execute
I don't know, I'm interested in it. So much of this sub is just an endless series of posts about the same meme stocks that are already up 1,000%+. Some possible future trends to look into is better than that.

Lol
I'd agree with you if they had any concept of risk management on even a per-trade basis, but 98% of the people that make it to the front page with 6 fig gains made it there by yoloing 10k on a meme stock, get hooked on the rush of making 10s of thousands of dollars in seconds (which is literally better than cocaine) and then blow it all on OTM options expiring the next week. By your metric, that's like telling a guy that won the lottery to spend all their winnings on more lottery tickets, its shit advice. 100k isn't that much money when you have it.. but when you lose it, 100k becomes an impossibly large sum.
I‚Äôm agreeing but I do plan to do something about the 30-50% selloff that‚Äôs coming. Maybe I sell or buy a put, but I‚Äôm doing something.
Haha yeah I was just gonna buy some long calls with prob jan or later exps. I haven‚Äôt got into wheelin and dealin yet.

Real UE is like 25% + ...  most people in USA have negative net worth..  Banks are tightening credit.  So many stocks have went 3x + since the lows for no good reason.  Institutions are selling to fomo retailers who will be stuck holding the bag.   - Cashgang
I was trying to say telos is the pump and dump riding the success of Palantir. However one government contract doesn‚Äôt mean this company is going to 10x, if you think that then you‚Äôll be waiting the better half of a decade. Just a fair warning that when you get a group of retards all pumping up a stock in this herd mentality will equally be likely to dump it when the price is right
This is exactly type of info that'll get people fked. The puts were at the bid meaning a bunch of institutions were selling the puts as entry into the stock.

One can discuss that by 2025 a good percentage of the world's car will be already electric and probably this rush of money into battery will consent the development and adoption of other battery chemistry.  Maybe more advanced.

I agree- sort of. I think PLTR will go generally up until around Christmas, then as you say, down for probably a month.

But for all you know, it hits $30 on the upside and then the selloff only takes it back to $20.

Real talk. I noticed the 10/15/21 420c BABA strike has OI of 38k+. Two gigantic orders $10M and $29M (8k contracts and 30k contracts aggregated). Is it an obvious bullish bet or a ridiculous hedge against a bearish bet? I haven‚Äôt noticed any matching bearish bet from my research (yet). The positions were opened when baba was at around 298 (after the ant news dropped). I‚Äôm just wondering if I should follow the money here or is it some absolute titwanks with $40M to spare and wager?

Stocks are not zero sum because shares are made out of thin air and have value added out of thin air as well.  But options are tied to a buyer and a seller so when your call goes up whoever sold you that call their end of the contract goes down.

Huh? Zero sum is just describing the net profit of all the trading counterparties in the market. It has nothing to do with whether an individual person makes or loses money. An individual person can make money, can lose money, etc...and so can a group of people. 

But the net profit of all market trading participants is zero (if we assume no commissions - technically that's why it's negative). The easiest case if there are two people in the market. One buys an option and the other sells. One will make a profit P and the other will make a profit -P. So it's 0 sum since P - P = 0. You can expand this case to a market with a ton of participants. As I said it's actually negative sum if you want to be technical since it's really P - P - commission = a number less than 0.
End goal for people should be closer to $4M than one million. If you want to bypass decades of working I think this guy is taking the appropriate risk. I don't advocate this and certainly wouldn't do this myself but I think him taking extreme risk at the $100k level can be justified. $1M isn't that much money. There is a lot of emotion tied into the millionaire word from decades ago. Be aggressive to $500k, slow down and turn that into $4M over the next decade.

I think it's still hot.
depends on how you count it, but basically no.

theta gang situation:

say you sell a covered call and the underlying rises above strike plus premium.  now you and your customer both made money.

economists might want to compare your gain to an opportunity cost of if you had just held the shares and say that you lost, but that gets a bit silly because if you consider your opportunity cost to be the most profitible move you could have made in hindsight we're all losing billions.

whole market situation:

because of its transactional nature, the total amount of money being put into the market equals the total amount being taken out, adjusted for dividends, buybacks, IPO's, and dilutions.

but then there are unrealized gains/losses as well as bankrupcies.  if you count those values as being real then it stops being a zero sum game.

and if we tried to liquidate the whole thing (take everything private), there's no reason to expect the liquidation value to resemble the total investment.

My PLTR 1/15 $15 calls still printing. At 90% just waiting for it to hit $20 by December. 
Also bought in on the UTZ hype 1/15 $22.5 calls
I've been trapped between -40% and -80%, I hope I'll get back eventually...
Even 10% is a bit high

You know spy was at $222 right? And the only reason it raised was because the feds turned on the money printer. They turned it off on friday so I see a huge tank incoming.

Exactly
Shit you're right
Doable. "Palantir it announces it will be using Big Data to help manage the US Covid-19 vaccine rollout" PLTR up 300% in minutes.
Dang. I feel ya. We had a lot of this stuff at work recently. Honestly it just seems like a white guilt fest. Like the whitest most suburban morherfuckers talking about privilege and they seemed absolutely disconnected from reality and the very people they are talking about. Someone literally said they had not interacted with people of color until highschool. And I was like. I get it.... But you don't have to get all gas no breaks on this shit.

next week lets crash down to $325, fill all those gaps, then December head back for ath on positive consumer news and emergency authorization for multiple vaccines, federal budget passing, stimmy hope, and hope for a better 2021. all those gaps going to keep me paranoid until they're filled

This is true. What this sub teaches is not to be too uptight about money but to have fun with it. When you're not uptight about money, you can be not uptight about a bunch of things. It's super liberating, not even bullshitting, and that's after blowing 70% of my portfolio on SPY put weeklies.

Pick a auto stock and hope they mention the words EV in the next week.
I would also add toyota into the mix. They probably know that EV is the future and should come out with an EV in a year or two. Then its a question of who of those three falls vis a vi market share. Nio has china, nikola is likely a farce so tesla could lose some market share to toyota
It‚Äôs the definition of dangerous as fuck. Say it‚Äôs PLTR and you have a 30c leap and sell a 20c weekly for 0.50.

If it goes to say 25, you have encountered a roughly 8-1 loss ratio.

Your balance is roughly close to your investment? I suspect you will endlessly beat yourself up for this. Best to erase memory/history of this except lessons learned about options risk/reward profile. It isn't like real investing. You have a decent amount of money to start new today and be a real investor. 

In case this helps, I keep the bulk of my investments in an account that I don't allow myself to buy any options. I sell covered calls when I'm pessimistic on a long share position and even rarer will sell a put if IV is high and I'm on the fence about buying shares at the current price.  Aim for 25% annual and you retire early. I have a separate account for higher risk options plays (even leaps are in this account). It amounts to 3% of my total funds. I ran it close to zero once and re-bought with funds. On a hot streak I pulled out a lot from this account to rebalance into my normal investing goals. It's a way I can play the speculation game (on a small yet volatile way) while the bulk of my accounts stay the course (need less attention on them, too).
This is literally a Robinhood glitch lol

Margin trading gives you higher buying power. 
And withdrawing lowers the number at the top left.
Most creative? Buying some calls. Seeing them pop, holding, waiting to go read, panic, sell to break even or a loss, watch them go up 2500%.
How??
NGL I like the gerber baby food ones. They are like crack. The "adult" ones are too salty for my taste.
you dont want a submissive gf let alone wife. You will feel she doesnt contribute to conversation or ideas and thats going to lead you to despise her but subsequently feel bad and be stuck in a revolving pitty hate relationship. Been there done that with a ltr

The other end of the spectrum will keep you on your toes but sometimes too much and if you get lazy she will probably cheat or leave you for someone she percieves as a "go getter" but thats only because the first 6 months- year everyones a fucking a go getter.

Rare earth anything is completely fucked. It's one of the dirtiest mining operations you can do. Neodymium magnets are easy to make by anyone once you have the materials. Environmental regulations make rare earth mining impossible in any first world country. So basically you're getting an investment in 3rd world rare earth mining companies with a massive multiple markup because of the SPAC. This going public with the SPAC is other people unloading their bags on you. It's a clever deal for the company and SPAX. Get rich off a one time event of multiple expansion from unloading it on price insensitive public investors.

i‚Äôve researched this as well, and most people think options is a zero sum game where stocks arent. however, this is most certainly not true. assuming there are no dividends or ROC or some other special clause that benefits the shareholder for holding the stock, both options and stocks are zero sum games. 

‚Äúone person‚Äôs gain is another person‚Äôs loss and the sum of all gains and losses that has participated in the trade should equal 0.‚Äù is what zero sum game is.

options, it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs a zero sum game. stocks, however, people argue that the stock market isn‚Äôt. but there‚Äôs a easy way to prove that stocks are a zero sum game as well. with the assumption that ALL companies eventually go bankrupt some time in the future, you can assume that the market value of any stock will eventually go to zero. this can include aapl, amzn, msft, etc. eventually all these companies will go bankrupt and people benefitting from the rises today will be someone else‚Äôs loss during the downward trend. for ex, when you‚Äôve calculated the net profits for all MSFT shareholders from the inception of the company to the death of the company, it would equal 0. hence, a zero sum game.

I see you‚Äôre somewhat newer to SUMO, it‚Äôs had a few 10% rips and some -12% cliff dives on zero news and mild market days so my guess is a good ER will be better than more than 10%+ and a bad ER... yikes, could revisit $16

SRAC 5 min google DD. Launch in December, official listing in March. Will be launched in defense and satelite etfs. Does not expect to generate profit until 2023 at the earliest. My biggest takeaway: compatible with SpaceX rockets who I feel will control the commercial rocket launches in the future due to price. They create and control a 3rd/final stage vehicle with a rocket that is responsible for separating multiple satellites at different trajectories. It gives multiple satelite companies the ability to piggy back with each other and save money on the launch price.      

Spacs and etfs tend to have a pretty strong first day depending on who is listing them. Personally, I‚Äôve been invest in them since someone posted something about SRAC and PSTH 1 month+ ago. I plan on selling slightly OTM covered calls on open when they get listed and I do enjoy it as a short/mid/long term hold.

Just a reminder, with lower exponential growth rate you guys wouldn't be in this situation right now, which this post doesn't take into account.  With an R0 of 2, each 1 person infected will go on to infect 2 more on average in two weeks, and then those people will each go on to infect another 2 people all the way until the end of the pandemic (another year?) for 134 million additional cases.  Lowering R0 to 9.3% of its value is huge my guy.  You can get back to your fucking Coachella and still infect a couple other retards, but those retards don't spread it to anyone else.

no doubt clean energy is the future and will it be affordable for the masses sooner rather than later. As much as America loves the idea of energy independence so does the individual. Here in the mismanaged state of Florida Its already more economical to add solar to your house than to continue to use the grid power. Companies like Next-era energy (NEE) have developed lease to ownership programs that make you money. You read that right solar gives enough to your house and the grid to pay for itself and for some drinking money on the weekends. 

As for the Tesla's Nio's and Nikola's of the world it's more speculative as to who the winner will be. As of this year sales of EV's has surpassed the sales of diesel cars for the first time ever. Will they surpass that of gas pre 2025? Maybe, maybe not but I'm willing to lean towards the idea that they will, with the help and adoption by the legacy car companies. The pure EV companies do have the advantage in tech and the idea behind most of their valuations is that they will always be the leaders. Thats a harder bet for me to believe in and that's why I like the beat down legacy car companies.

I‚Äôm exaggerating a bit, but I think that the smart analysts think that it‚Äôs priced as part of FAANG as a monster tech company, but it‚Äôs really just a content company. It‚Äôs got no structural advantages over competitors, in fact, the opposite. They are good at what they do though, and maybe they have other plays in the works. I‚Äôm just saying that the stock has downside risk, so invest in a way that limits that (otm calls, shares with stop loss, something like that). Don‚Äôt sell put spreads, my man!

So what is physics
I don't mind but I'm completely new. You should head over to r/thetagang for some more in depth answers. Basically it works much better on highly volatile stocks.

It can go wrong if:

1. Your stock TANKS. Sure you get to keep the premium of the call you sold, but it's outstripped by the loss in stock value. This is more of an issue if your avg. price on the stock is high, and you can always just hold the stock long term while selling more CC's to slowly DCA your stick price , but you might be bagholding for a while

2. Your stock MOONS. Your CC expires ITM or gets exercised early, and your stock gets called away at the strike price, and you lose out potential profits. This isn't a big deal if you sold a CC at a strike you'd be happy to sell the stock at in the first place. Example of this would be PLTR, say you got in at 10 share price avg and started selling CC's at 12. It works out for a few weeks, when suddenly PLTR moons to 18 in like a week. Your CC is now way ITM, so your choice is either to buy it back (for a loss) to keep your stock, or you could roll that CC forwards/upwards, or if you're not attached to the stock, just let it get called away, so your total profit is (avg. share price + the profit your stock gained up to the strike price + the premium you sold). This profit will be potentially much less than if you just held the stock from 10 to 18

Personally, I'm a degenerate so I'm currently buying lots of 100 in stock that's meaning upwards aggressively (example FCEL). I wait until the stock rips up like 10%, which drives the premium up on calls. I sell a CC at the peak of the upward momentum, preferably in the beginning of the day/week when volatility is high.

If the stock drops back down that same day from +10% to flat, the CC you sold might already have lost 50% of its value (meaning you've achieved 50% potential profit). Here is when I would buy back the CC I sold, instead of letting it ride 30+ days. 

If your stock is particularly memeworthy (cough cough EV stocks) you can get away with doing this up to 3-4 times a week

Wedgies. Wait for the macro/weekly consolidation and place monthlies going both ways if I can find a low IV stock. I pay .15-.75 for .50 otm $15-75 stock with shit IV, then I‚Äôm able to play the wave(I usually play everything as a headfake followed by extreme rebound in the other direction).          

Wanna see something scary? Look at the flag for spy and QQQ. That thing is going to moon or fall soon... my play on that is be short large caps and buy calls on small cap/oil.

I‚Äôm not expecting mid 20s but I do expect 21-22. I mean fair value is hard to determine as the bigger you are the harder it is to grow. In this case you have a very strong regional brand that is turning into a more diversified national brand. In Baltimore, utz outsells Doritos by about 25%. That is impressive. I think long term you will continue to see operational efficiencies, improving market share, growth in e-commerce and further penetration into the boutique style chips. Utz is also a good acquisition target IMO. Analyst on Wall Street agree.

Merry Christmas.
No it isn't. It's $50 a month for 40 months or so with 0% interest. If you think that's high, you need to re-evaluate your life.
I'm new to investing, but have been in clinical trials for a while. Pfizer is a shit company. They have the worst trials, high turn over, and their protocols are terrible and poorly thought out. Their drugs, as least in my therapeutic area, are always second rate, theyre never the top competing ones. 


They made 12bn last year and its estimated they could make 12bn on the vaccine. But, with this being a pandemic I wonder about the push to lower the price to make it more widely available to everyone. Im not sure how other governments are funding getting it to citizens. And don't forget they will likely be splitting it with Moderna.They were able to get the covid vaccine opportunity, but this one thing won't make the company any better. If they had decent management and employees with half a brain they would be higher valued in pharma already. 


I dont know about stock potential, if someone wanted to tell me about how this situation relates that would be cool... but I thought I'd pipe in about the company itself since I've worked with them for a few years. Hope the info is worth something.

Weird fucking comment even for wsb
Tell everyone you're gay, that's the latest fad
Haha yeah. It‚Äôs kind of silly at times but overall it‚Äôs really good compared to 90% of shows out. And the numbers back it up. There was a map I saw of most watched Netflix content in the world and money heist at the time was every spanish speaking country and even much of the Middle East.

first find a watchlist of 10-20 stocks you love.  play some of them and watch the others.  sometimes they'll just present you with obvious plays.  like when teladoc got pounded down to $180 just recently.  fuck yeah I'm getting a piece there.  diversify 5-10 plays at a time as well.  play quarterlies and LEAPS.  you can also sell PUTS on stocks you love that expire in 1-2 weeks.

Exponential growth my dude. The first thing to do is make a small goal of going to the gym and working out for 10 minutes. Then next weekend go for 15 minutes. Then 20 and then so long. I feel like so many people want to jump into things and have it be correct right away, when in reality they should start small and build up a habit. Or keep lying around jerking off three times a day, the choice is yours
Sounds hot. Tell her fam to fuck off
You‚Äôd be surprised how much impact this sub has on driving up meme stocks. We can probably rocket it 25+ within a month
Why would you pay that much.. I got mine from humane society and he is a god damn genius.
I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt see color anymore
If you use a strategy of setting limit buys to pick up cheap stocks when they dip below a certain price, you might want to dip your toes into the seller side of options. Say I want AMD at $75, I could either set a limit buy, or write a $75 put every week until I get assigned. The outcome is basically the same, but selling those puts gained you hundreds in extra income.

It's good. The voice acting they do over the Spanish is really good. It's one of those shows where you have to sort of suspend disbelief with all of the events that happen, and the potential for plot holes, but the characters and story are good enough to carry it despite that. Watched all 4(?) seasons pretty easily, and I'm pretty picky about what shows I watch.
Hahah üíé‚úã my friend. I may reduce my exposure a little bit just before earnings, if it‚Äôs already above 15
Its not that simple. Autists can also be retarded
Do you even know what each of those companies do üòÇüòÇ

By the time retail gets in its already the top, I would wait a while
I really like foreign shows these days as I‚Äôve run out of American content. I think it‚Äôs produced pretty well. I know a lot of my fb friends were watching the previous season heavy. 

My thought process was an increase in viewers would result in a increase of price. Thought this happened when tiger king and a few other shows/movies were released. Could be wrong.
FDs are a gamble (expect to lose it all) on calls or puts that expire that week (<=7 DTE).

Yeah - that's what I read, which works out great as long as Peloton keeps growing in the lockdowns.
You're right at the support line. And judging by my calculations, if it breaks then it will continue downward, however there's a good chance it'll retrace and go to the moon.

Only acceptable if y‚Äôall do m/f/f threesomes.
exactly.  I've posted this same thing several times the last couple weeks.  once your a made man stop doing stupid shit.  $100k is a plenty big bankroll to make strategic plays that generate meaningful amounts.  I understand not wanting to put in the effort to make smart plays that net you $200.  But you can make those same smart plays and make $2000 once you get to a certain level.
Anyone got a good resource on leaps? Leaps for Dummies?
Yes

This is the best answer. Do not invest for your family. Don't tell them you invest. It's not a good idea.
Yenna da!
Lol I‚Äôm 5k in was buying more every week since opening day, this shits a heavy hitter
It was a real aha moment when i learned that many people finance their PTON bike with Affirm, which makes me even more bullish on pton. The fact that people buy a pton if they cant afford to buy it with cash is baffling to me but w/e.
Peloton is their largest customer? Lol wouldn‚Äôt have guessed
If you have an older sister with money, I would suggest offering to suck her toes.

Procrastination/motivation solutions? Like between working a day job and trading while working.. i like to just relax on weekends but there's always stuff i **should** be taking care of.. no issues getting motivated to go to the gym, but never any motivation to get stuff done that i should be..

You realize COVID helped them right? The hotels had to lay off employees, downsize the number of properties, and take on huge debts to pay for empty buildings and unneeded staff

Meanwhile everyone is renting Airbnbs in rural areas or vacation destinations (Palm Springs, Lake Tahoe, etc) for weeks or months at a time to work from home and stay safe

No one is choosing hotels over private houses any more

My dad is a janitor at SPY headquarters. He agree.
playing charts and trends is monkeys throwing darts at a dartboard of stocks level shit.  its ok as long as its balanced with real knowledge about the stock and you're not just playing numbers.  and the yolo plays on here are for retards gambling their paychecks.  once you have real money to use you should never do weeklies.  I generally do quarterlies and LEAPS.  I will sometimes make plays 6 weeks out anticipating a run up for event or news or into earnings but never through earnings.
Bro where else can u suck cock in a gentrify neighborhood for 20$ in a apartment
Tell them you're autistic, and yolo fd's. Remind them stonks only go up, and can't go tits up.
It's just risk priced differently, it's just a way to make interest rates more attractive. I actually don't understand the hate, if you suddenly came into a windfall you can just pay off your 22% and you suddenly save a bunch of money. Rather than having locked in higher interest rates or variable if your a moron for the life of the mortgage.
Try holding it...it's like watching paint dry

Circuits can only get so small before quantum tunneling makes them useless? That, at a minimum, information being destroyed necessarily generates heat and that heat must be dissipated?

Uber starting a network of mobile logistics. RIP Amazon
ABNB IPO feels like a super gamble. IPOs have extra retard strength on top of this market's retard strength, so that's bullish. They're also a household name so robinhood idiots are going to fomo in. But covid fears and shutdowns and such might spark a selloff in the travel sector and anyone who bought on the day of the IPO could end up holding some heavy bags.

I that show good? I watch a couple episodes while I was really high and I just remember it being weird, but not bad weird.

Yeah I think Airbnb going IPO when its valuation is most depressed is a huge plus. Has a lot of upside.

Why even bother with the "egg" in egg nog? Are there other types of nog?
I will keep this in mind - thanks!
I think banning posts boasting penny gains is the way to go. A Minimum of $10k bet on stocks or $5k on options or you don't belong here.

This is a great way to make $100 instead of a $1000 on a stock like palantir. 

Do this on boomer stocks with little daily growth but still are long-term bullish.
There‚Äôs some serious retards in this thread smh. This is just a regular old diagonal spread. You‚Äôll need spreads enabled on RH (which you can get by just making any 10 options trades and then requesting it). To leg into a spread you have to buy the long leg (in op‚Äôs case. a LEAP) first and then sell to open the short leg, which must expire before the long leg. If the short leg isn‚Äôt fully collateralized by the long leg you‚Äôll also have to post cash collateral of the difference between the strikes. And if your expirations are on the same day then you need to understand pin risk too.
That Tesla spread tho

I like to jerk off when my options go down 50% or more to take the stress off and then I make my decisions with a clear head. My wrists definitley hurt more but my asshole hurts less so its basically a win.

I mean the problem isn't options. The problem is that you seemed to have yeeted your entire portfolio (or most of it) into options. On your first try, no less.

Both can be true. I doubt long term investors are missing many features within the app. As long as you can buy the shares and sell them when you want out, there's not a whole lot to request.

Sure it is, when you sell the 20c you‚Äôll just have to put up the difference between the strikes as additional cash collateral. The 20c will be collateralized by the 35 and the cash.

Clean energy is the future but today it's a product of when it's palatable and affordable for the masses. Green electricity is available and there's some market share v normal generation routes 

But the better question is clean energy what tech was in the 1990's-- something that's inevitable but too costly to adopt mainstream? The tech bubble burst in part because there just wasn't the capability for everyone to need all those companies services at once-- even though we had stuff like email gaining wide adopting (basically the green generation that's gaining traction today). A decade later once the cost to own tech went down people adopted full scale. 

So again the question remains do you think in today's economy people will jump enmass into ev's and electric everything absent any mandate or subsides? Or is it 2030 or beyond? If it's the latter then ev's that are pumped are basically dead money and could fall back hard (like anything tech in 2000) and rebound a decade later
Omg I did that at the Orange County convention center one time for a $300 parking fee as well. Said I lost the ticket and it was $36, then I complained that that was expensive and the attendant let me out for free. Big üß† move!

Bought them at the bell along with 50 shares at $525. For my sake, I hope you are wrong about that but if it dips Monday, I will be there with dry powder.
It's so obvious but timing a downturn is much harder than just riding the wave. "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"

I'm standing on the sidelines but I doubt the pop will happen in December. At this point any play you make is retarded and it's better to just sit cash and wait.
I bought right around open and got in at $11. Should have let the morning settle before getting in, could have gotten it a bit cheaper. but I knew once the reversal started, it wouldnt make a huge difference either way.

Last 2 weeks, we had two vaccine pumps on monday. Now that they are seeking approval, I believe that FDA will grant it on Monday morning at 8:30 Am, giving us another green dildos. A couple of weeks after that will be stimulus talks restart. Boi, I love this shit.

A) GE is phasing out the coal business.

B) Did you forget about healthcare? Performed fine this year.

C) GE Aviation is bigly profitable in a normalized environment. High recurring revenue through maintenance contracts.

D) GE is doing a sale/leaseback w/ airlines backed up by fixed income behemoth PIMCO. Aircraft leasing was extremely profitable pre-COVID.

GE is one of the best plays following a vaccine story and easily has enough cash on hand to service its debt. Frankly, your timing could not be worse. There will be a massive bounce in FCF in 2021.

No problem brother go yolo all those tendies you are getting from pltr into tesla =)
I sell weeklies, I sell them every Friday for the extra theta then if there‚Äôs some big dips during the week I buy them back for 80-90% profit and do it all over again.

> the us gains significantly more than those countries by their good relations

Lmfao

Just how much stuff do you think countries halfway around the world with preferential trade deals with the EU and GDP per capita figures that are 1/5th of the poorest US territory (American Samoa at $11k) are buying from the US?

For example: **Syria annually imports less stuff from the US than the Biden Transition will cost.** And that is ignoring the net; the things the US imports from Syria.

Im just going to stop there. I should have known that seeing someone try to talk about the actual numbers and cost/benefit of foreign relations and military interventions on the retardsub wallstreetbets would disappoint.

I'm not usually this mean, but your fact base is entirely divorced from reality and this has led to the opinions you have based on those "facts" being completely baseless. (Much like Trump's lawsuits).

&#x200B;

For the record: Trump "left" the Kurds high and dry because we had US troops supporting the Kurds and US forces supporting Turkey (a NATO member state) and the **Turkey and the Kurds had decided they were going to start shooting at each other.**

&#x200B;

Why are we even considering sacrificing American lives (at minimum $80k a pop) to interfere in some tribal conflict halfway around the world?

&#x200B;

Remember the some of the last times the US government interfered in tribal conflicts?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Indian\_Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars)

Yeah.....that worked out well for those tribes we allied with, didn't it? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

I see no rational news why we pop this coming week.  COVID wont help holidays.  Mitch will limit stimulus.  and the vaccine isnt as amazing as everyone thinks it is.  PFE has huge distributional and storage problems with needing freezing temp storage.  COVID is ramping up more and more.

The bad side has more potential than the good news.

It's amazing how much confidence first time traders have.

Are you deep inside pltr or is pltr deep inside you?
OP did amzn 0dte calls.

Apparently RH added them recently. 

Let's see, piss poor fills, bid/ask spread that's usually $1-$2 apart (or worst at $3-5 for OTM low liquidity shit).

Definitely recipe for amazing outcome for WSB right?

Anyways been scalping amzn weeklies for probably 9 months now to modest success. Trading a lot less this month tho but I'm still getting drilled by theta/greeks lately cuz amzn (and big tech) has been flat as fuck.

Think I took a minor 1.5K L on Fri after amzn started fading from 3130s. This is even after gaining some back from 0dte puts towards end of day. Just wasn't moving enough to make much out of it, unfortunately.

Are you going for a small quick gain or planning to hold till expiration? 

What‚Äôs your price target?
Posting same thing in two different subs, you must be really mad you missed out on the gains lol
what about square?

Im so deep in PLTR, but i decided I want to hold it for awhile.

Where should I go for a second account so I can throw some money in there just to play with
You had me at TSLA is a blue chip.
Should of held my baba call. Sold for a small profit. Good for you though the bottom was easy to spot.
While I did find debating entertaining I was unaware of the downvote consequence. I'll be sure not to waste time defending my honor to morons in the future.

If I made 100 dollars this year selling rubber bands, and the bag of rubber bands only cost 10 dollars, would you invest in my company?

If there are way more buyers than that, but that's all the rubber bands I have right now, would you invest in my company?

If I take out a loan to buy 100 bags of rubber bands, would you still invest in my company?
That was hilarious.
What do you guys prefer? Sell weekly calls or monthly‚Äôs?

It‚Äôs not gonna be about earnings as much as the forward looking guidance and what‚Äôs generally happening with beer bug. If they‚Äôve done really well with online sales and announce a ramp-up of their e-commerce, expect upward movement but also look at TJX. It was sideways mostly because of the state of the market last week. A couple of lottos if you want and then track movements to decide on some longer dated calls. Good luck
Why buy ev car when you can buy ev charging station
I wish her many pennies to her name!
Needs it to drop closer to 8.8% to be profitable by expiration (if he plans to hold)

Different story if he is just looking for a small gain on any pull back - in which case this has a decent chance of making some money 

Question is whether he is trying to get a multi-bagger versus just getting 10% on a quick movement
Not saying I disagree, but more broadly I do think this contributes to a weird culture that doesn't like talking about money, which in turn contributes to america being generally full of financially dumb people

Gather around I have a story to tell. Back in the winter of ‚Äò20, I sold some TSLA call spreads. When the ol‚Äô rona showed up in the spring, the market crashed and the spreads were worth probably a penny at one point.  I pretty much forgot about them and the market came roaring back. I logged in one day and couldn‚Äôt believe it: the spread was complete in the money and I had to sell for nearly maximum loss. Once you can sell for > 75% max profit, do so.
At the time I read this and thought I had switched to the discussion thread, but just decided to leave it..
With that said, RKT gang soon to be taking a job at Wendy's so no arguments there....

Honest question: How do you cashout options with a big profit?  


I just started trading options ($30) and it made some money. I wanted to exercise my option but didn't have quite enough money in my robinhood account to cover (had to do another quick transfer). So what happens if someone has a options that have made thousands of dollars but they dont have the money to buy/exercise their option? Is there an immediate buy and sell option to cashout?
SPY OTM calls EOD Friday is a reasonable gamble though. One hint of vaccine news abs we shoot back to 365

Damn man. You‚Äôre really saying what I need to hear . However I don‚Äôt understand the whole strategy part of it yet I guess . Also in this market with the different iv how do you make a plan to sell at a certain percent when it hits it at open but then climbs the rest of the day.. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt really know where to start. But I do like reading what you wrote .

Sell poots. If stonk goes up and you lose your shares, you can get them back on down weeks by taking assignment

Favorite indicator? I like using the Chaikin Money Flow. Chaikin is a volume-weighted average of accumulation and distribution and is very popular with analysis firms. 

The daily money flow on FB on inclusion to S&P went from -.3 to almost .4. TSLA is currently -.2. Which tells me the money hasn‚Äôt even begun to flow in yet.

Have you heard of NIO?
I added some tech calls on Friday after a long while. Hoping for some rebound. üò©
I've regretted it in both cases... but I can say from experience its worse to hold too long and lose gains vs selling early (for a profit) and seeing it go up more
Not enough times because you‚Äôre gonna keep going and we‚Äôll wait for the loss porn

But until then, congrats

Probably because they know that they can demand you to pay PMI, so they're willing to take a risk on you *because* they know they'll also get PMI payments. Maybe otherwise a risky borrower wouldn't be approved for the mortgage. Not sure

The share price is a reflection of the value of the company when multiplied by the number of shares. Most often dividends are cash payments from the company to the investor. Since the company no longer has this value, that drop is reflected in the stock price.

Start by not giving him/her the boob milk.. water only
Look at the price comparison between these contracts and the other ITM contracts for 2023. They have the best value. As this goes up and more investors start buying, the price for these contracts should inflate and catch up to their intrinsic value. If that‚Äôs the case, and I decide to sell beforehand, I will be better off than having actual shares. It‚Äôs not too risky as I only have 7 contracts, which could be sold quickly. (there‚Äôs usually at least 300 contracts with bids for this strike/exp.)

Idiot! STUPID IDIOT! This is in Chinese currency. Are you really that autist to believe that we will see an estimated 800% increase in the next year? Wow, dumb fuck.
No book. Make a trade check list. Stop buying naked calls and puts for a while. Find a couple of strategies and master them. Is it a sound strategy? How has the underlying been performing at 1 week, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y and 5y.  What is profit % that you will exit at? What is loss % you will exit at. What is the planned time period. Make a bunch of small trades. If you do a strategy that is 70% successful. Do ten small trades , 7 out of 10 will win and the three that lose? Well it's ok cuz you expected it. After getting a mechanical strategy and accumulating some money dont change your spread width and go "big" or anything like that. You coupound those small trades by doing 2 contracts instead of one and then three instead of 2. Approach it with seriousness!! Keep a trading log and analyze what works and what doesn't. You can't half ass option trading and be successful

Someone smarter than me (pretty much anyone on here): need help.

Crossed the 25K mark and want to preserve it before I lose it all...again. But I still love to play.....

Lets say I sell some puts that end up being way OTM.

Is is wise to buy them back to negate any sudden movements when they go OTM..for instance those contracts are now worth 5 cents... to just lock in gains minus the 5 dollar loss on each contract. 

Seems worth the 5 dollars/contract

Am I missing something? Is there some caveat to this I'm to blind to see?

Also if I buy back the same amount I sold can I consider the position closed no matter what happens?

Basically you locked in a 17.50 price for 2 years...it‚Äôs a good play but couldn‚Äôt you have bought the 700 shares at the same total price and held 2 years at an equal or lower risk? And you can sell calls on the shares ?

I want to put money on Monday but I put $500 in Robinhood but it says it will be delivered on Friday (idk if it will be morning or not). I put $1K on CRSR, when it was $36 something, on Thursday morning and I made over $100 which I think it's not bad for 2 days haha. If I did it earlier like on Monday (it was near $30 and now it's $40) idk how much I would have made lol.

I even thought about putting $1K again but I also want to take it easy because I'm not working I'm currently studying but I have money saved haha. If I have to put in on Monday Nov 30th and the share is below $25 (kinda doubt it) then I'm putting the $500.

Sorry for the long ass comment I'm still new to this shit lmfao. Best of luck of course.

They doubled the price of SNOW at the last minute which took away the retail profit. It‚Äôs pretty unusual though and unlikely to happen again this year

I decided not to buy SNOW after they raised the price for that reason. Too much success priced in.

Airbnb will easily beat their numbers for the next year or two since country borders are literally closed right now. Considering they are already tracking on plan for the year and made a profit last quarter despite the shutdowns, they are clearly on a solid growth trajectory and the stock will be rewarded as they hit solid year over year growth numbers

Yes, that's the most easiest comeback like "Visionaries create trillion dollar company" while we minion critique them as if they're worthy of being labeled as "visionary". 

Creating billion dollar companies is not all about vision, it all requires environment, government policy, and as I said before, protectionist policy in place to nurture them to grow. 

Ask if someone in Vatican city if they're for energy efficient and environment friendly consumer products. They will say "Of course in a heartbeat." But to make a billion dollar company out of Vatican city is not as easy as labeling some dude "visionary" on the street. There's no visible platform to begin with. 

Alibaba is not a copy and paste of Amazon for sure. But Alibaba is not doing something that is totally new to life style on Earth. That's my point. 

I don't want to get into "Travel outside of the US" retort like everyone who get annoyed every time anything related to China is critiqued. Who do you think I am actually? 

I'm saying what it is. 

I said Wechat is changing people life style. That's unprecedented and never happened anywhere on Earth. It's the apps that does everything for you, paying bills, rent, buying grocery, transfer money, literally everything. 

Does Alibaba change life style of people in China? Of course it does. But it's not unprecedented and it's not new. It happened in the US already. That's the point. 

The same for iPhone as well. It completely changed the way people interact via phone. It introduces phone, internet, music all in one. That's my point. 

To make a billion or trillion dollar company, it's not somebody's vision. It needs government protection. 

Have you ever heard of "LINE"? 

If you have, ask why it didn't have a huge impact like wechat. 

If you haven't, then don't tell me "Travel outside of the US".

I work in the industry too. Margins are based on cost or efficiency of the process but are also based on demand. Lenders are raising margins during this time because they can't handle the number of customers coming in.

Rocket's LOS is the best. The other ones people use are kludgy and terrible. That's a fact. Encompass is bloated and has a bunch of extensions for different types of businesses. Rocket built it for themselves. When times are lean they can easily lower their margins to keep their employees busy. Unlike all the lenders that folded up shop in 2018 when refis were dying. 

Based off of their deal volumes they get lower rates on their warehouse line of credit and can also package their loans and save some bps when they are selling it. 

They are absolutely position to do the best regardless of our economic environment. If you think the reason they have captured more market share and have such high NPS is purely because of marketing when they are selling an entirely fungible product, you are deluded.

I got burned on solar by JKS (I didn't start trading options until late in the year, so I missed the amazing run-up after the March crash), so I'm staying away from that, but I have made some significant gains off of the back of EVs and hydrogen alone without really understanding the market much. But now that I have some capital back, I'm thinking that having some fundamental understanding of the market would be good, haha.

At face value, it seems like a good idea to invest in some of the people actually building the infrastructure - SBE, BLNK, PLUG.

I purchased AMD for around 1.70s avg, sold for profit. Had 10ounces of gold avg 450 an oz sold at 900. Had TTWO for 18, sold for 28.

Larger hurt was not throwing 10k into amazon at 88 a share as I thought the price was too high.

Sorry for your losses brah. You seem so triggered for others success sad life
Throughout the rise of industrialization, there have been many visionary companies that completely change people life style. Some stay dominant and some got M&A by newer companies. That's the life. 

I don't know how much longer Apple will dominate the tech life style.

Generally yes because I can cut out when I feel comfortable with the profit or loss. It helps me be more disciplined too because ToS has more tools that RH and I find it easier to use. Also, it‚Äôs better to hit sustainable gains over a period of time rather than hope for those home runs. You might be successful once or twice but it costs big every other time

Finally have enough money to day trade. Started this journey in December of last year with $390 bucks. Now I'm up to 26k. If a retard like me can do it, you can too. Now with that being said, any tips on day trading? Good links, videos, advice, etc?

2016 after a lay-off and I'd burned through my emergency savings. 

Figured it would've dived as they were getting negative sentiment towards the RX 480 drawing too much power potentially damaging mobos. My better gamer buddies confirmed at the time that AMD was still subpar and shit.

Eventually they patched it, but the price was sketch at the time as people were euphoric over the rise from sub 2 bucks, and no one had expected to see it break 5 anytime soon. 

I was fine with the sale as they'd bee purchased for around 1.70 avg.

The vast majority of doctors are spoiled toddlers outside of their area of expertise. And because they are good in their area expertise, they think they are good at everything else, when in fact they need to be constantly hand-held by others around them, not realizing just HOW MUCH hand-holding they have been relying on to seemingly function as well-adjusted adults.

Well, if it was insider knowledge that he'd accomplish it early in 2021 and apply those taxes to 2021, then it would make sense that knowledgeable rich people would cash some out in 2020

That‚Äôs simply untrue. Selling a house with a traditional agent will literally never be below 6% and it usually in the 8-10% range or even higher. Opendoor is 6%. That‚Äôs it. They add repair costs if there are any major repairs to be made, but you would also perform those when selling your house normally, or accept a lower price. Add to that the convenience of being able to move out immediately rather than waiting the average 2-3 months on the market while potentially paying two mortgages... I don‚Äôt know how you don‚Äôt see the potential.
Is that to loosen your boyfriend's butthole?
If you are on the receiving end I understand it works. If not just do it normal, that should be enough

Assuming you‚Äôve enough shares of SPY or TSLA or non penny stock there‚Äôs absolutely no reason you‚Äôll go collecting pennies on the off chance that they‚Äôre gonna get called away at almost break even for you. 

Selling weeklies is the absolute minimum you need to do to make money. In fact I think theta gang sells like 30dte at 30 delta or something like that.

> The part that's shitty to me is that everything seemed cool until I actually showed up with the work from home gig making more money than them. Over text and phone up until that point they had been super cool. It was when I arrived in town that they were distant.

I‚Äôve heard a few pro athletes who have come from poor areas saying this but when you come from a poor background, a lot of your old friends who are still stuck in that same situation see you and your success as a mirror for what their life could have possibly been (whether this is true or not since not all of them can become athletes or have success in the finance world, etc.). I imagine this probably makes them feel pretty miserable, although to no fault of the successful person at the other end of this equation, obviously.

Not even considering either companies as a whole and just based on stock movement itself. BLNK‚Äôs run up this week was a 127% gain compared to SBE‚Äôs 53%. To me, the former is not sustainable.

A brief dive  into company‚Äôs growth outlook. Chargepoint has already established its network of charging stations. Revenue for the company in 2020 is expected to be about 135 million just slightly from 2019. It expects to be profitable by 2023. This past week, it announced it was teaming up with Apple to integrate its [‚Äúintegrate a wide range of EV charging information in Apple's CarPlay infotainment system.‚Äùhttps://www.reuters.com/article/electric-vehicles-chargepoint-apple/apple-chargepoint-team-up-on-electric-vehicle-charging-info-idINKBN27X1LF



&nbsp;


Meanwhile, BLNK despite a $900k higher in revenue this year they posted increased losses of $1.3 million. The only thing I found on BLNK‚Äôs growth outlook was an interview from their CEO that said he thinks prospects looks good.

I got you fam. 20C 11/27 is an option call that means you are betting the stock will rise to at least $20 by November 27. C(calls) give you the right to buy a stock at the strike price ($20). So if the stock is 20 dollars or higher by that date then you are good to go, otherwise the option expires worthless.

Hmm so I‚Äôm guessing it stands for *something* mortgage insurance. I never knew that was a thing. If they‚Äôre approving you for the mortgage, why the fuck are they making you pay the insurance since they decided to take the risk on you? I really don‚Äôt know anything about housing or stocks for that matter.
Tax expert here just trade in your Roth IRA lol
Lol no
experts? lol
250 in 2022 looks good. I got 230 for June, not a  leap, but I think the fact MSFT has been lagging for three months they will be rotation back into Tech. Also, MSFT hit 220 last week. It looks like whenever MSFT hits 200 it bounces back-up. So see how Monday is if it starts to move-up wait and then if it dips again to 200 or lower load up for 2022. 

What are your thoughts?
The collapse. VIX almost dead should mean risk on investing. Still thinking we might see 3450 before it shoots up in Jan

S&P thing will only cause a squeeze in the 12/14-12/21 week. i am waiting for this dip to occur in the next 3 weeks so i can reenter with a LEAP position
Any tax experts on here? If Biden becomes  president and increases capital gains taxes...when would that likely go into effect? 2020, 2021 or 2022?

This is like the 4th time Goldman has downgraded apple this year. Once at $277 for PT $233, once at $370 for PT $299 and once recently at $120 for PT $75.

If you have under 22% equity in a house, you pay the banks insurance against yourself that you'll pay the loan. Mine figures up to about an extra $100 a month on to my house payment. Once you get above 20-22% equity, you call them and they ditch it. But the entire idea of it is stupid. Banks are federally insured, I'm not.
I sold calls on Friday so naturally it will outperform all week and I‚Äôll be fucked to buy back

Yes actually. Most people are happier without it tbh
That was absurdly ridiculous editing.  Ma is absolutely correct on numerous issues and way smarter than Musk in many regards.  I.e. on AI replacing jobs he is 100% correct that we are HORRIBLE at predicting the future and that new jobs will ALWAYS be created.  We went from 90% of people working on farms to very few people on the farms today (due to automation), all while many today are making money streaming themselves playing video games for fuck sake.  After ATM's were introduced, banking jobs actually INCREASED.  Automation merely empowers new forms of industry and jobs, all while reducing costs so consumers have more disposable income for new types of products and services.  Musk is a total moron on this point and many others.
I would have agreed but there are currently external forces at play with the S&P thing. A.) This changes the dynamics and B.) TSLA is notorious for ignoring technicals.

Many time and every time Jpow said more fiscal support is needed 

This came and Fed is done 

Fed can only keep rate zero when there is inflation  that itself is bad and artificially inflating the asset prices

buddy, i'm a huge tesla bull, my entire portfolio was TSLA till i cashed out this week. it has to retrace back to 460 levels before next leg up.
355p lets gooo
It's really too volatile to predict atm. Could shoot up to 7.5, could dip below 5. 

If it dips below 5, sell puts

If it soafs above 7, sell CCs

If it consolidates at 5-6, buy shares and long calls
Yup and everything else was a fraction of their current price back then too
What would fool most market participants?

A rip roaring rally to 3850?

A end of year collapse to 3200?

A flat, 5% range bound market until end of Q2 2021, slow killing the VIX to 14-16?

It‚Äôs not bullshit news , at least do some actual DD .

It‚Äôs about president XI and his ongoing fued with MA . 

As well as his disinterest in in big private businesses that have amassed capital and influence , this challenges him as he is a communist .

Still it‚Äôs not a bad play
It‚Äôs still lower that where it was in Aug. TSLA is undervalued believe it or not. You can‚Äôt value them like an auto analyst. That would have been like valuing AMZN as a book seller. There are like 12 different businesses / startups within Tesla rn.
once they decriminalize drugs shartcoin will fucking collapse

The spoon hitting the inside of her coffee mug as she stirs is deafening. Your head is pounding.

‚ÄúWent a little hard last night, huh?‚Äù She asks this playfully, with zero sense of how right she is.

‚ÄúYeah, I guess so.‚Äù She puts down her coffee then kisses you on the mouth. You can taste the half and half and her love for you.

‚ÄúWell, you earned it. I know you‚Äôve been working hard.‚Äù

Earned it. Earned it. That‚Äôs the opposite of what you‚Äôve done. You‚Äôve lost it. Everything. The money you saved for the wedding. The money she saved for the honeymoon. The money your grandmother gave you in her will to pay off your student loans. All gone. On calls and the booze to forget the calls.

I'm just doing a PSA man, to withdraw your principal if you start to do well
Extremely high risk because options out of the money by even a small amount will become worthless very quickly. The benefit is that if something crazy happens on the expiration date (for example, if TSLA had been added to the S&P 500 in the middle of a Friday), then you could catch a MASSIVE upswing. 

I don't recommend you go with weeklies with 0DTE, especially if you had to ask this question.

More concerned with how it performs in the 2 weeks leading up to Dec. 20 when funds buy $100b of the stock

No. Tendies are to sprout little seeds to grow future tendies. Jfc. The nerve of some people.
They might just wait until they have to.  It‚Äôs not going to be a panic buying spree, it‚Äôs big banks who sell the fund to clients, they don‚Äôt care what the price is.  I already had calls that expired worthless this week.  The majority of funds may have already bought.  I think it‚Äôs likely you at least break even, I mean you need a 12% rally which we know is possible over the course of a month to break even.

I think there is bigger risk of market pull back which may affect Tesla though

Oh right, sorry I thought you were replying to my original post

What I'm suggesting happened this is that institutional players who control most of the stocks did not behave as rational participants. They can control or at least heavily determine the price by controlling the supply side. This was all part of a plan they'd cooked up some time ago about how to best handle a crash for their own security and profitability. My guess is something like:

- The initial crash is caused by normal selling pressure and lack of buying. At this point it is mostly smaller participants leaving the market. Pension funds are staying in, they always do. ETFs and mutual funds are mostly staying in although discretionary funds are leaving. Investment banks and hedge funds are mostly staying in, closing a bit here and there but nothing dramatic
- March 23rd. The smaller participants are down below some key number. Now the big boys put their foot down. Selling is restricted. They're not going to behave as rational participants and continue selling because they know what is coming next
- April - Selling continues by the remaining smaller participants. Smaller buyers enter. The institutions are not selling and so the pressure is on the buying side
- May - At this point they could resume normal-ish activities, but now the rally is igniting buying and they want to draw money into the market, as well as improve their own assets of course. NB. The money coming is not enough to propel what happens next (under normal circumstances
- June, July, August - The relative lack of selling propels us to all time highs. The rally continues to draw buying liquidity into the market
- September - Now the institutions do start to sell. They partake in profit taking per their usual plans. At this point they are completely secure
- October -Some buyers are still entering the market but not many. Now the institutions are starting to find it difficult to trade normally without affecting the price. Sizeable volume is having a dramatic effect on the price due to lack of liquidity. Inside the consolidation pattern it's chaos
- November. Election. One last inward pump of buying and it shifts the price significantly. Profit taking ensues
- Now. There's hardly anything left to come in. Nearly everyone who was interested in partaking has done so. Now there is a lack of liquidity. Now the institutions are struggling to find people to sell to and need to be extremely careful. They will tighten selling again in a bid to avert a price drop

Here's how it could blow. The price is very sensitive when liquidity is low. It is possible that smaller participants could trigger a decline. Maybe hedge funds will be quietly trying to sell too. If new buyers cannot be found, and a price drop occurs that causes alarm, it could trigger all kinds of selling from people who profited in the rally and wish to exit in the green.. leading to another blow up

The problem with the coronavirus is it is just serious enough to warrant things like the lockdown but at the same time it‚Äôs mild enough for there to be a real case against locking down. Scientists still don‚Äôt understand much about the virus and a lot of people that catch it have serious  long term side effects. But at the same time it‚Äôs basically a bad flu for the large majority of people that get it. My doctor friend said it‚Äôs like Russian roulette with a 1/100 chance of dying.

Hi! Yes I sold my options Wed for around 1300 profit (around 42%) currently holding 250 shares. I got in dumb early and ended up avg down - had around 80 contracts lol 

I was hoping for a run up to around 47 when it became clear that wasn‚Äôt happening I decided to sell Wed and lock in whatever I had lol after the beat I picked up shares - in hopes of a Costco like performance where it climbed a couple weeks after ER

Didn‚Äôt know it was 99% institutionally owned - makes sense though - why it traded sideways through ER.

He‚Äôs looking for massive value, which still exists in a lot of areas but nobody is noticing because everyone is busy chasing cloud and EV stocks. 

LUMN has a $11B market cap and they make $5B revenue per quarter, if they can get their shit together they should be making at least $1.5-2B net income per year.  Dividend needs to come down. I would put T in the same category, eventually people will realize they are a money maker and deserve a higher premium.  Im buying cheap 2021 calls on T and own 550 shares.

NVDA $530 calls exp 11/27 üôè
YEET
!remindme 11/27
Bearish.  I think it will pullback a bit more this week before going back up.  Remember, it still has the ARM acquisition hanging over it, and their guidance included a decrease in data-center purchases for the forseeable future.
Lmao I'm loving all these memes. Solid work
You should only be trading options with a very small percentage of your portfolio. I only trade options with like 4-5% of my portfolio with the rest in shares, and I've been doing fantastic.
NIO is going to open at $52 on Monday and I know this because I didn‚Äôt buy calls on Friday.
Apha is the outlier in weedstocks since September as it didn‚Äôt skyrocket off the election.  

But more to my point you could buy Apha  1/21 4c for less than 30 bucks each.  If you spent $400 on those you would have about $2700 right now which is almost a grand more than you would have made buying 100 shares of green thumb.  

Like I get where you are going but that is more a strategy for buy and hold folks.
What was the play?
S&P500 inclusion means ETFs have to buy shares
burrys fourth largest position is PFE calls...that really speaks to my soul
Got some 12/18 130s
That‚Äôs exactly why you should buy calls, the consolidation is almost over and

Get a part time job while pursuing a college degree that can eventually earn you a decent salary (engineer, business, etc). Work in that career for a few years and start building up your 401K.

At this point, you will be on the path to a comfortable life. But, also at this point, Space X will be public and surely very overvalued. Throw all your 401K into SpaceX puts and lose everything because stonks only go up. Post pictures here

Yes it was the 2012 one. Got a few of my roommates a bunch of cash too.
It's also just good portfolio management. Insiders usually have way too much of their wealth tied to their company, especially when it's private. Your company fails: you lose your job *and* your retirement all at once.

In general, insider selling has little informational value. Insider buying is a better signal. It's asymmetric, but that's the best you're gonna get.
lol.

Probably not a bad idea. I'm thinking if it does get to that point a cash-out makes sense and perhaps grabbing shares with the profits to hold long term.

He wouldn't be paying the squeeze prices. If he tendered $25, that's what he will be required to pay. If it briefly shoots to $100+ he can sell his 9.98% stake and use the profits to fund his tender offer.

Big data has a real possibility to be the next revolution. Plus with the advancement of 5g, even more things will become connected and more and more data will be generated and collected. These companies love collecting data, I read the jetblue terms and conditions last time I took a flight, they wanted you to connect your phone as a remote for the screen. Once you connect it, they'll take your fingerprint data, facial recognition data, voice data, location history, embed cookies into your phone that exist even after you leave the plane that track what you do on your phone. These companies are amassing troves of data that are all fingerprinted (your devices fingerprints, not yours) to you, they just havent found out how to use them yet...500b in 5 years would probly put it at say 20th most valuable, not entirely unrealistic just slightly improbable
Could be a pullback. I‚Äôd keep buying on the way down with longer expiry tho they have a lot of potential

DevOps engineer here, 60-80 hr work weeks are pretty standard for me.  Also salary but on the bright side I get to work from home.

Sorry bout your situation bro, sincerely hope it gets better!!!
not particularly  

BABA's problems are political between Ma and Xi/CCP.  

a 5% bump in price isn't a sign that anything has changed.  

If you look at BABA's price chart, the runup from August (260s) to the October highs were in anticipation of the ANT IPO, and the unlocked value that would generate for BABA.  

ANT is looking at serious headwinds now, not just on coming back to market, but much stricter capital controls for loans they originate.  That will severely cut into it's profit margins, making it harder to justify the $30 billion valuation that was estimated before the IPO was scheduled to go through.
Because they make money?

MSFT is going to 220 by Dec.
You know what the biggest problem with this company is?  their HQ and Their primary product teams are all in total backwaters.  They're not in an ecosystem of innovation.  It reflects in their hires and in how they build new product offerings.  And it's not something you can easily change.  Management actually seems completely ignorant of this problem.

When your pool of engineering talent is primarily sourced in, say, St. Louis, what you end up with is quite a bit different than what you get in SV, or Seattle, or Austin, or a number of other places.

The reason why it went up is because it most likely reached the bottom. There was no news. The other Chinese giants recovered quickly with the exception of BABA because Ma couldn‚Äôt shut his mouth. JD was free tendies last week, BABA is probably gonna recover hard this upcoming week/week after like the other stocks did.

I can see it going back to 290 very least or back to ATH eventually. Not too late.

Just pick some overpriced shit, buy a put debit spread with a few months on it  and a few calls just in case and make the gainz.
I don't need robinhood, those guys are a bad omen
It's rallying because it dropped over a bunch over superficial issues

I don't know if it's done but it's only made up a small part of it's overall drop.

Hey, I used to work in the software engineering department at CenturyLink.  
The Level 3 merger really shook things up, both in a good and bad way.

The good being they're more prevalent in the commercial space.  
The bad being they've brought some fucked up management (who have ousted the legacy CenturyLink leadership).

It seems like everyone these days wants to re-brand themselves as a 'technology company'.  
Lumen is still nothing more than a telecommunications entity.  
They do have their IT consultancy arm, but that is very small and riddled with shitty H1B and/or other outsourced 3rd party bottom of the barrel resources.

If I had to guess, I'd say LUMN stock would go up due the entire industry making gains.  
Maybe it is no different than picking American Airlines over United.  
Overall, LUMN is still trading near its 20-25 year low and really has no where to go but up.  
I do see a lot of runway for this company and I think Covid will be a catalyst for the entire industry. I'm thinking this could just be a value play more than anything else.

TL;DR LUMN seems like a decent long term investment with a lot of runway.
I am not entirely sure how to interpret this, yikes. Does it mean my calls have some hope lol?
Airbnb is best bet during Covid. More locations in vacation areas where you are isolated and you don't need to share a hallway and air vents with a bunch of randos.

Pre Covid I actually thought airbnb made hotels up their game and hotels were pretty nice most of the time tho

looking at gain posts and hoping i get dumb lucky someday
I‚Äôve heard that somewhere else before
No stimulus is better than a bad stimulus, that i'll be paying for over the next 30 years.

The fact is, they could easily give immediate relief to US families, but Mitch and others demand X amount of funds for corporations, the military, and other special interests before they'll even consider helping out average Americans.
I'm very much into it too, that I'll have to admit.

Any exact date now? I'll guess I reserve 2 batches of cash... 1 for getting ripped of my institutionals and the other for optional dip buying.
From a technical standpoint yes, we're at the bottom of the range and there will likely be a bounce given the strength of this market and the abundance of liquidity, I'm looking at a longer time frame however.

I took a more macro perspective on the recovery and believe the transition period between the current administration and the next will not be as smooth and there will likely be some nasty headwinds headed our way. Mnuchin clawing back the credit facilities is an example. I do believe he was pressured from up top and it was politically motivated. It's the first of many during Trump's lame duck presidency until Biden takes over. Restarting those credit facilities will have to go through Congress and the Senate which is currently split in half.

Moreover the data provided by Pfizer may have actually proven to be more bearish than originally though. The subsequent actions of the public who believe the vaccine is around the corner will also force state authorities to mandate harsher actions to protect public health imo.

Took a leaf out of Ackman's hedge. I'm still bullish on equities long term but at this instance, I can not justify these valuations by any means given our future economic outlook.

Expecting the exact opposite pending some PFE emergency response news. 
I think it's violent up or down monday with any development
Damn igga
Any of this:

‚ÄúWhat I am suggesting is that the rally was created by a deliberate absence of sellers, with the intention of popping the price back up and pulling all available buying liquidity in the market. Now rather than holding stocks which are down 30%, the institutional players have them at +20%. In fact I think they've been part-selling during this consolidation period, taking up the remaining buying liquidity coming into the market, exiting some of their positions with a profit when 'normally' they would have to take a loss‚Äù
With this now on WSB, now I have to do the opposite of this post, meaning I follow exactly what WSB tells me to do... someone has to change the meta

Ending December lower than where we are now is incredibly unlikely now.  Letter has to be responded to during the call.  That means we see a strategic review, guidance and how console sales are doing now.  Very few companies run on EPS anymore anyways, they run from the call.

What information are you basing these ideas on? The third and fourth paragraphs.
Zoom is CCP certifies, it won‚Äôt go down
So you‚Äôd rather have no stimulus than a small stimulus?

Wow
You're probably not doing it right
No it can't.  It is way too liquid for that, even in the perfect case scenario where cohen buys more and then forces a vote.  2-3k is about as realistic as me being able to run 75 MPH.

200-300 is probably the absolute top end.  I'd expect 60ish for a slow squeeze, 100-150 for a vote induced flash squeeze.
It means $100 share price ain't happening.
Bro get on a dating app to find a girl who is actively wanting to date. You could try to ask her out but after 2 years you should know if she wanted you... she would hit you up individually, gravitate to you when you're in the group, etc.

The longer you keep yourself confined to your group the more you falsely believe there aren't thousands of girls out there that would make a great partner. Pretty similar to the stonk market and getting stuck on on company tbh
I don‚Äôt think so. I personally don‚Äôt like fds. 

I tend to go 4-6+ months out near or at the money. Yes sometimes it‚Äôs more expensive per contract but I‚Äôm looking at solid gains over time. 

For BABA I started buying last week and early this week. I went hard on the 290 2/19 calls. Cost average 9.16. Right now I‚Äôm +44% and very comfy knowing I have plenty of time that if it sideways trades I‚Äôm going to stay up for a while. If I get bored I can sell and most likely net profit. . 

I can‚Äôt show you multi 1000% baggers but I‚Äôm churning through 30%+ gainers (sometimes over the 100% mark) and with each subsequent trade increasing position size. 

You probably weren‚Äôt expecting this long of an answer but I‚Äôm just writing the post for people out there who are struggling gaining traction or blowing up their accounts. This strategy is a slow and steady grind up over time. Don‚Äôt worry about the cost of the contract, just how much $$ you are willing to invest in a trade. 

(Another example- bought CF 05/21 $30 calls on Nov 10th and am already at +73%.  I still have 6 months on them!)
They were the options that provided the best value. I got them when the contracts were $1500 each. $15 + $2.50 = $17.50 so I‚Äôm still better off
National debt, especially when that nation is the _world‚Äôs reserve currency_, is wildly different from personal debt. If the US ‚Äúpaid all of its debt‚Äù tomorrow, the entire global financial system would collapse.

US debt is how large sums of money move across borders through the economy.

Best tip i got last week was from someone here saying to get Fiverr and that it'll be at 190 by end of week, fucker was right.  If anyone else got any autist plays, plz share, need me a big win.
Don't sweat it man. Profits are profits, but learn from it. I definitely get nervous when I'm up big on something, but before you panic sell, ask yourself why you're doing it. Has anything changed? Is there a reason to think a hard selloff is more likely than a continued rally? One little red day isn't necessarily a reason to panic either.

I've been getting better at this, but it's still hard af. Not too many people knew BLNK was gonna do what it did, so don't beat yourself up. My goto is having enough cash in a position where I can sneak some profits out early and let a portion of it ride if I feel like it still has legs.

Anything like this is a double edged sword. The silver lining is that you both would have found out eventually if not for those incidents, and the takeaway is that both of you have real friends now, or at the least better methods to protect yourself from fairweather friends.

Sucks though. I‚Äôve been there. Friendships like anything else are an investment - you cut your losses and dump your stocks even if they performed well for you in the past, because you should be making these kinds of calls based on present, up-to-date information. I know the nostalgia factor tends to colour that.

>None of this means the Fed is out of ammo. Mr. Mnuchin has extended for 90 days four Fed facilities that were set up with pre-Cares Act money in Treasury‚Äôs Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). That includes the commercial paper and money-market programs. The ESF also retains some $80 billion, and $50 billion of that could quickly be used to leverage as much as $500 billion in lending if need be. The Fed will also retain $25 billion in its facilities that it could use to leverage another $250 billion

Covid is real and serious; basic precautions like masks and avoiding large indoor crowds should be uncontroversial and universally adopted.

You see all the covidiots online because they‚Äôre the most visible. But on the other side, in my circle at least, there are lots of people who are paranoid about leaving their house, haven‚Äôt been in physical proximity to any friends or family and have been miserable for nearly a year now.  

And in terms of tangible cost, there‚Äôs mass unemployment, economic hardship and a generation of kids falling behind in their education and psychosocial development.

We have tragically lost about 1/4 million people to this virus in the U.S.  That is about 1/1000 Americans.  What I want to point out is that we have collectively decided the reasonable trade off here is for 999/1000 Americans to endure economic pain, educational / psychosocial regression and general discomfort for a year.

Maybe this is currently the rational trade off.  But there *is* a point at which it becomes irrational.  Avoiding Covid does not mean you get to live forever.  And life lived incompletely is loss of life, too. 

I feel we need to be more explicit about the exact trade offs we are making. It‚Äôs easy to be affronted when deaths are discussed in cold economic, terms like this.  But consider that you may have the luxury to be offended and say that ‚Äúany loss of life is too much‚Äù.  Doctors and medics must triage all the time.  Judges and lawyers put dollar figures on death regularly.  Public health officials weigh costs and benefits with no illusion that resources are infinite.
Anyone short over the weekend?

I went short on SPX futures and made some gains EOD Friday. Sold like half of them but held half, in case the drilling continued. Looking at the chart, though, I feel like we might bounce on Monday... Dunno. 

At least they are futures so I can panic sell Sunday night if need be.

What? Your first one free. So your supposed to go big on your first one.
If you have an option where the bid is 10 cents and the ask is $5, it'll mark the price at $2.55 even though there are zero buyers at that price or any other. And then it'll show you on your fancy graph your account value at a mark of $2.55 even though your shit is going to expire worthless.

You‚Äôre paying for the privilege of waiting up to 9 months for a 20% move. AMD is fickle, it could go back into the 70s for a few months and your calls will just be stuck in the mud burning theta while casino stocks are mooning. The true long term play is NVDA, which could be a FAANG-level company, especially if they get ARM. AMD should be a strong competitor, but the upside is more limited. The entire semi sector, tech sector generally, or equities market could be deprived in the next 6 months, and AMD is not gonna reach $100+ if the surrounding market is down 20% against the dollar. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a terrible play, but those are my arguments against.  Sue Bae is bae tho

Not OP but pltr is a unique company that is well established with high value (read: "big spender") customers like the US military, intelligence agency, etc. 

This on top of their insane cuatomer retention rate means once you go PLTR you don't go back. So PLTR is unique in that it doesn't need crazy customer growth as each customer is retained (compare to FB that needs 3 customer to keep 2). 

I think once people see the potential for significant client accumulation they upgrades will start rolling in

For real this.  I blew up one of my accounts then got stupid greedy with it.  I'd be up 20-40% on a day but look at the $ amount and be like nope, not enough yet, only for it to disappear a day later.  Had I just sold at 20% and kept my focus on the %, it would have went way better.  Doesn't matter if the 20% is $75 or $7500.  Keep focused on the % it will eventually get there.
Ordering is pretty easy, although multiple orders is a bit tricky. I usually just buy long calls and then add in some short calls later to offset some of the theta. If you‚Äôre focused on spreads, desktop app is probably better for that.

Oddly specific
TOS interface is intimidating but I‚Äôm getting the hang of it. I find the phone app easier for monitoring, but the desktop app is ultimately similar. In the ‚Äúpositions‚Äù tab, they list each underlying stock you are invested in, and each option is nested underneath. This makes it very easy if you have multiple options in the same stock, since everything is grouped together and there are subtotals to see cumulative p/l on each ticker.  

The ‚Äúp/l open‚Äù is a bit misleading because it (obviously) excludes the profits and losses from options/shares you have already sold. If you have taken profits and/or rolled up options after a move, the p/l open will exclude those profits and show only the open positions, so it‚Äôs basically just the sum of all bags you are currently holding. The p/l day is good for monitoring and the p/l ytd helps put the p/l open in the proper context.

would make sense for it to reach 560-600 i think

Dude it's a fucking leap there is very little theta burn for a long time

By then  PLTR would be $5

True, but I think there‚Äôs still some juice in the run up post-merger. Price is being held down as insiders and early investors take profit.
The same can be pointed towards the other side. Stop being so closed minded and understand for the most part both parties truly care about representing their constituents. What matters is who are their constituents with the most pull
Agreed its all about the %. My advice, buy into leaps and take profits at 30%, sell and repeat. I've been messing around with weeklys on a small account (1000) and I'm up over 100%. However it has proven to be too risky I've gotten burned to many times. Go with leaps, This strategy works but takes time, it wont make you a million over night, but i think over a year with this strat you will do very well.
The tda web portal is garbage. It is so bad it keeps me from over trading! 

For example I use robinhood to figure out the option price before entering it into tda.

I hear good things about tda with tos buy haven't decided to pill the trigger.

Change my mind: considering dumping 5K into PLTR 19c 12/24 calls.

Would this money be better spent on a cheaper growth stock calls like FCEL or one of the EV‚Äôs like NIO?

this would be my first leap experiment - anything to know about pros and cons for leaps instead of weeklies? obviously the prices are way more expensive - but should definitely pay off, no?
With all the negative news this week the market has done pretty well. Do we expect this resistance to push us to ATHs in the next few weeks?

CEOs, look under your chairs!
Ark has sold Tesla shares again. Last time they did that at $500, things didnt go very well the following 10 days until they bought again.   


Tesla seems to have special autist strength though, but low volume on friday.
Get on youtube and watch a lot of videos. It's not hard to learn but will take some time to fully understand. What people are talking about are buying call options. Options are contracts for 100 shares of the company. You normally don't have to buy the shares, 99% of the time you will trade the contacts like shares. If you think the price is going up you can buy a call. So let's say the price is currently at $15. And you think it will go up to 20 or higher. You can buy a call option a 20c.it's also very important to know that these contractors expire ( unlike stock) so you will see a date next to them.  Something like 12/ 4 /20 20c.  The option price depends on a bunch of factors but basically the price will be cheaper for a shorter expiration and more expensive for a long one. It will also be cheaper for a call that is extremely out of the money. For example you can buy a call for Apple to be at 300 by  nov 23. This is extremely unlikely to happen so the call will be cheap. Becareful because if your option reaches that date and the stock price has not exceeded your call price your option will be worthless and you will lose that money.
Turned $8 call into $200 with this stonk. Also the 3 wheels cost 20k you could buy a Honda Accord with that and have AC and go faster then 70mph. Shit company great stonk
Every time I see a dip to buy, I turn into SUCH a pussy...
Make money
I went deep pockets on this one.   


I kicked myself for not buying Tesla at 300 pre-split. I was to stubborn to get into NIO because Chinese company bad.   


I'm gonna sit on PLTR till my bones rot. It's my last sliver of redemption. It it goes tits up, fuck me I guess.   


But I believe, and what's more beautiful than that?

The people who buy and the people who sell are not legally allowed to talk to each other ever since that whole Silver thing, so you‚Äôll get random shit like them shitting on a stock and then buying it

Definitely not them trying to buy shares for dirt cheap before raising its price target because that would be illegal and banks listen to laws

There was alot of 11/20 calls making the stock run hot. Calls die down the following expiration dates and then alot of $38,5 / $39 / $41 puts on 12/4.

Imagine how much that shit would print.

It's no secret they're hiring the best engineers they can find en masse. They don't have enough liquid from contracts to secure that talent, so they promise stock compensation and all their employees are fucking elated after the IPO.

So if you had $200k sitting idle what would you start doing with it. I checked out your post history and you don't seem like a classic shit tier memer.
I never dream.  But the other night I had a very detailed dream of a small town on the sea, built on a cliffy island peninsula. The town was small and quaint and looked to be built upon the remains of an extremely old Greek or Roman palace. The island was very steep on all sides and the only way to the village was a large bridge connected to the peninsula's mainland. On the mainland side a waterfall fell into the ocean. I remember standing on the bridge, just wide enough for two lanes of traffic, and looking towards the city built upon the crumbling ruin. There was a large bronze door set in the side of the steep island and to the south the channel flowed out into the sands of a perfect yellow beach. I don't know what this dream meant but the image is seared in my brain. Pointless post I guess but I am pretty surprised at how perfectly I can recollect it.

here one for you if we're talking about dreams. i dreamt last night that i was in a watch club. every meeting they had a flyer saying what the agenda of the meeting was and on the back showed a chart of what every member was wearing on their wrist that evening. it was cool going down the chart and seeing who was wearing more expensive watches and less expensive ones and matching them up as i met people that night. it was the raddest dream. just talked all night with people who love watches and the conversations ranged all over the place. From shooting animals in Africa, to sailing the fjords of norway on a mega yacht. all this while enjoying the company of beautiful women around us and the best food/drink we could imagine. i wish this dream becomes a reality one day.

A call option with a $20 or $15 strike price. You buy call options if you think a stock is going to go up.

Edit: it‚Äôs straight up gambling
Options are never a sure thing even when it shows a profit. You still need enough buyers and to hope whatever pricing algorithms are out there don't suddenly fuck you.

Unless you have ADD you should be able to hold it long enough to take a profit. If you want a safe play but don't want to buy stocks go for 280c Feb should net a good profit as the stock is likely to be at $300+ by then, maybe even $320+.

But Mr. Mnuchin has acted in the best interests of the economy and the federal fisc, and the facts of the financial markets and politics explain why. Specifically, Mr. Mnuchin asked Mr. Powell in a letter Thursday to end the facilities that the Fed stood up with money under the March Cares Act. This includes the state and municipal lending program, primary and secondary corporate credit facilities, the Main Street facility for businesses, and the program for asset-backed securities.

This isn‚Äôt popular at the Fed, which likes its growing ability to allocate credit and please politicians with loans to their allies. It also won‚Äôt go down well on most of Wall Street, which loves the Fed backstops. And Democrats are unhappy because they want a long-term call on the Fed for their own political ends.

Averaging up is definitely discouraged on this sub. Even though you‚Äôre way more likely to benefit from buying on the way up than waiting for a dip. Averaging up is NOT buying at the top it‚Äôs elevating your average cost on confidence the stock has more room to grow.
By selling the options on, sure. The instrinsic value of the option is the difference between current share price and strike; that part is fairly obvious. The extrinsic value will decay with time/implied volatility changes. It wouldn't make sense exercising the option early; selling the option on would yield more - people will pay a premium for the chance of further gains, well, if there is enough volume to find another suckered to pass them on to.

The late, great Milton Friedman used to say that nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.

During the last five trading days, volume in put options has lagged volume in call options by 61.19% as investors make bullish bets in their portfolios. This is among the lowest levels of put buying seen during the last two years, indicating extreme greed on the part of investors.

I learned trading strats from retired hedge fund guys. Selling options is solid, but there are better, extremely high win-rate trades that require a good bit of capital to put on and adjust as needed. Higher capital also gives you access to more trading markets, and as such, more trade theses, like futures arbs.

> First off it‚Äôs commodities, which give you little return compared to better plays in the market. 

Market is consolidating into industrials and "value" names.  Tech and growth names are experiencing a cooling period, if not a full bear market.  

> Secondly that mine has been on and off operationally since like the 1950‚Äôs.

Yes, they got it on a steal.  The last owner over leveraged their operations and had to have the mine sit idle during bankruptcy.   Now the millenials have the reins... 

> Thirdly, all the executives are finance guys, no real exposure to the mining world. 

...but Gen X and Boomers have the board.  The corporate governance  is fiscally minded to avoid the failures of previous owners.  The operations management/leadership are all mine operators and mining folks.

>Fourthly, they still have to send their shit to China to process it which can deal things and give the Chinese an opportunity to fuck with it since they own the rest of the market.

Where did you read that?  Biden's big plans for infrastructure spending are including keeping all that industrial processing stateside.   Competition to China, not partnering.

Over the past few years I've been working on raising my tolerance to foodborne disease by eating all the out of date food in my fridge.

Once others discover my secret i imagine it will hurt the bottom line of food markets since people will realise their best before dates mean nothing as long as you train for it. Puts on food stores

Solid hold. I'd have sold at 20c and then cried.
Still do.
So the serious answer, now that I've sobered up and understand the point you are driving at - is that these past events you mention don't have any relevance here. They were different events, in different times, and the market behaved differently

Generally, in the past, when there was a sudden event like this which was widely expected to cause a profound economic shock - the market behaved 'more rationally' - i.e. took a relatively sharp dive and then years to recover alongside the economy. In the current case, we had the first part.... but the rally was surprising to most. For the price to increase like that, you must have a serious imbalance of buyers and sellers

So it's tempting to look at it and conclude tons of fresh buyers piled in.... but, did they? Some did, retailers, other opportunistic investors who happened to have cash for this. But I don't believe that money would be enough to shift the market on this scale. What I am suggesting is that the rally was created by a deliberate absence of sellers, with the intention of popping the price back up and pulling all available buying liquidity in the market. Now rather than holding stocks which are down 30%, the institutional players have them at +20%. In fact I think they've been part-selling during this consolidation period, taking up the remaining buying liquidity coming into the market, exiting some of their positions with a profit when 'normally' they would have to take a loss

They don't want to crash it, they want to see it continue to go up. But I don't know if they can push it any further. There might simply not be enough buyers to play this game anymore

We will see what happens once we break out of the consolidation
no, fuck ipos tbh. always pumped and dumped immediately.
Wait you're serious wtf.

It isn‚Äôt really difficult to outperform S&P 500, but it is on a risk adjusted basis. For example you could just buy QQQ and expect greater returns, but this is riskier and more volatile. 

So an advisor helps align a strategy to your financial goals and risk/volatility tolerance, which can mean deleveraging into stocks and bonds, or diversification into US and foreign investment. And figuring out tax beneficial approaches

If my friend told me he'd won 100m then I'd feel happy for him too as I know I'd benefit some way, free holidays etc.

No one wants to hear how much money someone makes if you're not going to gain from it.
Funny you say that.  I originally went to school to become a pharmacist.  After chasing all the nursing students through all the chemistry courses for about a year, I decided I didn't want to work in a hospital.  I wanted to OWN the hospital.  Let's just say I made the right choice. :)
If you get a dividend of $x.xx per share, when that dividend is paid out, the share price drops by $x.xx. This is why if you are doing certain types of spreads ATM, you need to be aware of when the dividend date is.

Nope gottem when NIO was $41. I just didn't trust the stock enough back then. Didn't know what would happen at/after earnings, but still wanted some gains.

Will you buy airbnb stock when it goes public?
Care to explain what you mean?

As far as I'm concerned this company pays 0.25 USD of dividend per share every quarter, so 1 USD per year. This absolute number is independent of the share price. 1 USD per year is 10% of the price of a share, so the dividend payout is 10% yearly. Obviously if the stock goes up, the 1 USD per year will start to be less than 10% of the stock price, however that doesn't matter to me if I buy it at 10 USD. Then I'll just have both the dividend gains and the gains from the stock increasing in value. Not saying it's a lot of dividends, but that's not the point.
Yea, I know exactly what you mean, I've been wondering too, but I refuse to believe that fuv or solo were actually part of a "planned strategy" plan. bbby jd and msft might fit a pattern profile, I dunno. 

The whole thing looks fucking crazy to me, if real, might be the biggest returns we've seen. Sure, I've seen people make a couple mill in a week here, but they started with a couple hundred k, this is different.

You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. Margins in relation to mortgage terminology literally are the costs the borrower pays set by the lender. Quicken/and rocket dominate the market share simply due to their marketing and branding. They are primarily a direct to consumer lender though, so if their technology is so powerful why are the majority of their loan leads solicited and paid for by their advertising on these websites like LendingTree/bankrate.com? They haven‚Äôt positioned themselves yet as someone sustainable once rates start going back up. Sure they are doing well right now, but so is every other financial institution in relation to mortgage volume right now. I‚Äôve been in the industry and they‚Äôve been trying to grow out to wholesale lending but United wholesale still owns that market share. Hell I‚Äôve seen a few major banks have lower fees then Quicken for the same mortgage products, and every other direct to consumer mortgage lender has lower fees. You have to understand the only thing that set lenders apart in relation to government backed mortgages are the fees and costs (margin). Rates are the same with every lender. They have the highest costs in the industry to sustain their massive marketing and advertising budget. They spent a billion dollars last year alone in marketing. Making up 70% of all mortgage advertisements on TV. Sure the company may catch Johnny Smith who is doing their first mortgage, didn‚Äôt research anyone else, and saw their commercial. I assure you that anyone that actually takes the time to shop around will find you‚Äôll be paying 1-5 thousand dollars more for the same rate and loan product with quicken/rocket mortgage than the majority of other lenders out there. I have a position simply do their market share, but imo their growth doesn‚Äôt seem feasible to the level a lot of these other pumpers think they are once rates start going back up, and we‚Äôre back in more of a home purchase market and not a refinance market. Back in 2017 and 18 when rates were much higher they were struggling. This is why it‚Äôs key for them to diversify more now. Their technology alone is nothing special, a lot of other lenders have similar technology, just doesn‚Äôt advertise themselves near as much.

I went through the exact same thing as you, just when I was 20. I got very sick and all my middle/high school friends were not there for me. Spent 21st bday in hospital alone. With lots of time to introspect, I realized we were friends because a shared experience that was nothing more than seeing each other and _living in the same town_.

 I have much more in common with my friends now, including how much our friends matter to us in daily life. We are all over financial spectrum, from me with more saved than anyone I know, to one of my closest friends who is a college researcher with barely a penny to her name (but one day will have many!)

You know, I was actually wondering about that, I'm not 100% sure, I think if it all expires at once, it's counted as 1 trade, but if you try to sell them before expiration and they get partially filled and sell a few at the time, each sale might count as 1 trade.. again not sure about that.

These were guys I grew up with from middle school and high school and I moved back when I was about 34 when all this happened.

I guess you're right in that somehow the friendship we had growing up apparently wasn't strong enough to weather that situation but the thing is, I genuinely was excited to be back hanging out with my dawgs and it became apparent *very* quickly that they....they weren't excited.

The part that's shitty to me is that everything seemed cool until I actually showed up with the work from home gig making more money than them. Over text and phone up until that point they had been super cool. It was when I arrived in town that they were distant.

As I mentioned above their ‚ÄòGotham‚Äô product can do this prediction, but it‚Äôs already been in existence for more than 5/6 yrs and if it was such a game changer it would have been already crushing all other companies and would already have a solution for COVID tracking. We are now 8 mts into COVID and if they were that good and easily implementable, wouldn‚Äôt we already have a robust solution? I guess this itself should answer your question if it is a game changer or not. Again it needs to be mentioned that someone needs to still give the algorithm for what and how to track and identify, maybe the government is not able to do that. Pharma companies do everything and come up with a vaccine. But Palantir is not such a company, they will give a heavy data crunching product which you need to decide how it will be used. They send their consultants who by the way are crazy expensive (heard from our management and no hard figures).

If they come up with a product after 6 or 12 mts it won‚Äôt change anything. Vaccine would have come already. Maybe it will help for future pandemics. But you need to again change algorithm, but should be easier. 

The IPO price was worth the risk reward ratio. Current price and the hype doesn‚Äôt look good.

Meh, don't give up yet, options can be really interesting. With a port like yours I'd say 80% shares 20% options, or something like that. Learn about spreads, and fuck with ITM leaps, see what happens.
Annnnnndd, heres depression‚ò∫Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt think this is true. _you_ had to make new friends because the things you shared with them clearly weren‚Äôt important as money. I‚Äôm open with my friends about financial standing (and everything else) and they are too. We are in very different places financially and that‚Äôs ok. The most important thing (to me) is trust loyalty and brutal honesty. If you‚Äôve got that the rest falls into place imo
$SRAC is gonna fuck you man
I have an idea of options are by definition but I now there‚Äôs more to it. Other than full immersion, where is a good place to learn? Specific YouTube channel or website? Beginner to advance.
And we all learn it the hard way.
Usually given to them by their parents.

Well then, look at it this way, as far as overall investing, 20k + a few (depends what a few is) hundred a month, to 50k in 3 years is actually not that horrible. Haven't done the math yet, but probably just a bit less than just holding spy would yield.

Good morning ladies and gents! It is another beautiful trading day. Can't wait to make some good tendies. Any good pre-market movers today?
Wow so brogrammers get millions at the expense of WSB crowd. LMAO UNDERVALUED.
I don't know too much about options yet but i feel like for example if I'm just holding a stock I'm confident in long term, aren't leaps already better than shares?
Fucking close
that's the spirit, dude. So many people get into the markets and look at it as a sprint. You would get maybe one winner in 10,000 people sprinting. 

If you want to make real money and not lose it all, you should be looking at it as a marathon. Don't over exert yourself, take it nice and easy and make sure that everything you do is adding to your wealth.

For reference, I went the sprint route early on and lost a shit load of money, settled into marathon mode and have been essentially raking it in since. And the plus side is my risk is incredibly low by comparison, but my profit isn't that much lower. And the cherry on top is that I'm spending less than 10% of the time i used to spend watching charts and plotting moves.
i wish you guys would just give me your money lmfao
And poor
Still waiting for it to dip lol
League One and League Two seem to always have more goals in I‚Äôve found, and more clumsy red cards etc.

I feel l‚Äôm still not ready for trading options. All my gains were from trading a mixture of growth stocks. I think this was one of the first times I was buying options. And yes it was a short term call.

That's actually something I have on my list.  A friend of mine from a country in Africa essentially said that for 3k a month all in, i could live in a nice villa and cover all my expenses.

Short options on my portfolio right now allow me to hit that amount monthly. Once i can get to double that reliably with short options, i plan on travelling through third world countries just to explore.
It's me, don jr
Is it luck though
He didn‚Äôt take out 300k from his 401k. He took that out from his brokerage
There are many theories of time and why it flows or seems to flow, but at the end of the day it comes down to entropy and the nature of observation. In this sub's terms it is reduction in volatility as more becomes known.
I keep thinking 1/15/21s are LEAPs when I buy them and they are most definitely not

Also a friend of mine moved to somewhere in california (i think sandiego), bought a 500k house, put 100k down, left his job 1 year later and sold his house for something between 600k and 700k. 

Essentially after repaying the bank, he made off with 100k profit on a 100k investment pretax. Dollars to donuts also says he did a housing swap to avoid paying cap gains.

THIS. And they WILL be envious, it's just human nature. So then you have all that negative energy being directed your way, it's best to just keep it on the low. I've lost friends because they hated how our lives had gone different ways and how I'd changed dramatically from what we'd all started out as.

I grew up in a small small town in a poor poor state and I moved out of state to a major city and worked for an investment firm and then Fintech firm and I came back to my home town to live for a year working remotely and driving an expensive luxury SUV. My "friends" were commuting like almost an hour to and from work each day and were still making shit money with shit lives and acted *super* weird at first and got to where they wouldn't even really talk to me.

I moved after my 1 year lease on a house and never looked back to that area or the douchebags living there. As you get paid you have to make new friends unfortunately.

I‚Äôm living in America and I had the same question. It held me back, though, made me jealous. It wasn‚Äôt until I threw that out of my mind and started playing competitively (every dollar I make someone had to lose) that I started to profit. Already up 10% total in a month after being down 10%, and I stopped caring about perfect trades anything that gets me even one dollar can get me another stock so it‚Äôs all worth it. Now I‚Äôm just envious of their easier starting position, I mean my entire portfolio was bought from my stimulus check, but the competitive view that my profits = their losses (not in reality, I know, but still)  makes me feel a little better lol.

Eh it's alright if it's a couple grand or you have comparable wealth to your social circle. It becomes a problem when there is a large economic divide between you and them. When they're struggling to make rent and you have 100k chillin they will not look at you the same.

For me I got a quarter mili and I don't think anyone I know has more than a few K, most talk and act like they're in debt actually. No fucking way I'm telling them how much I got.
I thought it felt way more bullish in here
I don't like the colour red though :(
Oh yeah... Im wanting to mix it up and add back value stocks to my current tech heavy position. Stuff like airlines LUV, banks, energy XOM, retail,etc. I really think market will want to start bringing those back up. Value went up hot lately. Hoping for their pullback.
Yea i got 3 shares at 260
Then 7 at 270 should make a few bucks
Yeah robinhood can't handle mergers. Same thing happened when solar city turned into Tesla.
Well, RC has told management to fix their shit and threatening with a takeover. You can read the letter, it was from just a few days ago (tactically, he is forcing management to respond with guidance by/during earnings). I think a risk is if management declines the tender offer, but RC really wants in and shareholders will likely be on his side as well. The current management saw their share price drop from $60 to what it is now (well, lower, it‚Äôs gone up now since RC). But RC is smart, I‚Äôm sure he will find a way with his lawyers to make a good enough TO or find another way to gain the 50% needed. All in all, I think the risk is with the unlikely case of declining the offer. This‚Äôll all be more clear in the coming weeks. 
At the end, it‚Äôs speculation but seems likely, so I‚Äôm in it with shares and no options. Should the offer go through, the shorts would be in a very bad position.
I was thinking WTF! RUN is up only 1,500% from all time lows.

Cunt must be a wizard or I am retarded. Likely both.

If you get BABA Jan calls Monday, I think it's best to have enough back up money to add more if it dips again.

I'm sticking to the positions above for now (and have a few others like JD calls and nvda shares), and will make further moves when we see more  clearly where the market it is headed next. If SPY Goes up big again, I'll start adding spy puts gradually. If market crashes, I'll pounce and buy what I consider bargains.

You lower it to the min amount to receive the max match, then you take the money that you woulda put into the 401k and save it for the down payment. You would have to pay taxes on the withdraw when you take it out and you loose potential gain on asset price when you take out the money. And why would you even want to move out of equities and into real estate when equities are clearly going to produce a higher ROI.
If you only had it for five minutes you can't really say you lost it.

That said I actually have lost 30k thanks to WSB and it kinda sucks.

‚ÄúMore‚Äù is used for adjectives with three or more syllables.

2014 Reddit you could have a dialogue if you chose your words carefully, showed an open interest or willingness to change your mind and fluffed them just a little. Now it seems you'd have to chat directly with members there because even a hint of challenge to a belief is met with hostility. I think it's the sheer size of the general ideology subreddits. Back when they were smaller they weren't so hostile.

BABA weeklies and SPY put weeklies killed me Monday. I added 50% more SPY puts believing the chance of SPY crash was even greater than before because of Monday rally. That, and BABA januaries and ZM call and ZM shares saved me.

Yes, just minutes before telling a man literally pouring millions of his personal wealth into interplanetary travel that he ‚Äújust came from Mars‚Äù and is not interested in it.
I gained a lot when I started options trading. Then I got too cocky and started losing most of it. Now I changed up my strategy and started buying mostly shares and I‚Äôve been green for the last 2 weeks. Might go back to options again ü§ï

Maybe I should post a bull's guide to deciding when to invest to balance things out.
Just slow down. Like reduce your positions when things aren‚Äôt going your way. Don‚Äôt be afraid to look at your positions and ask yourself if you had cash, would you buy back into the same exact positions? If not you need to fucking sell.

What the hell does Warren Buffet know

I live by rule #3:  never sell when you have made a profit, hold until it dips and buy more to average down then hold until it‚Äôs completely worthless
Low price+clean energy+wsb pump= mooned meme stock
This is the meta
Because you might think it‚Äôs not going to go up during the time of the option but want some dank tendies anyways!
The good thing about working nights is that when I fall asleep at 8AM it's too early to freak out and fomo TSLA FDs. Plus I have green dreams.
You‚Äôre on tilt. Poker term but applies 100% to options trading too. It clouds your judgement and you just run on emotion and make bad decisions as a result
HBIO
Still low volume. What‚Äôs the catalyst for it to go up/to meme?
I see. I guess I will throw in with the retards, it's cheap and funny.
What whack ass language is that?

DONT BELIEVE THIS GUY. He has proven to be a pumper. His last DD on AES was a failure. This guy is a certified smooth brain and has multiple alt accounts pumping these posts.
Yea true, avoid big cap stocks for now and just ride the chinese wave
Unless Zoom can expand their business beyond primarily video conferencing, it‚Äôs just a after of time before somebody beats them. 

Apple, MSFT, Google and everybody else all expanding their own video software as we speak, they‚Äôll undercut zoom education/institution pricing and that‚Äôs it. Nobody‚Äôs gonna pay for FaceTime
Maybe that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt get a 2nd term!
Yes, indeed, I do spend a lot of time scratching my balls. It calms me, centers me, helps me focus. And I‚Äôd appreciate you keeping your judgement to yourself. I thought this was a safe space.
Warren Buffet said 2 key important rules

Rule #1: Don‚Äôt lose money

Rule #2: Never forget rule no. 1

His tip to you is to not lose money
Yea.. i started paper handing way too much, afraid of losing even more, been wrong almost each time as i saw it reverse back up later.. sheesh. need to play longer term plays and just forget about them honestly.
Securing profit on meme stock is always a good choice.
Weeklies in the meme stonk of the week and cocaine. Also obsessively checking your ticker to the point of interfering with your personal life.

Because Cohen is making moves now. Just a few days ago he sent a letter to management saying either get your shit together or I‚Äôm buying you. It‚Äôs very probable he will send a tender offer the next few weeks. Q3 earnings will be the start of the catalyst, where management must show their future guidance. The short interest is massive, so once it starts going up, or if RC buys out and calls for all shares, it‚Äôll be quite chaotic I think (as shorts have shorted shorts)
The fact that they renamed and rebranded century link field so quickly tells me the stock will do well. Theyre gonna pump the everloving shit out of lumen with marketing

Mostly bought shares because this is going to be long term burn upward.  LEAPs are possible but I also wanted the shares.
Why is it that when you start losing money, you lose it much faster?
Your account flipped faster than a burger patty.
Let me tell u a story some time back I had 1000 nio shares. It was going up I kept on accumulating. Avg price 23. Stock goes up to 27 I am like it running super hot let me sell some calls sold 5 calls strike 
35. It crossed it I am like this is crazy sold another 4 strike 42. Stock kept on going up. Sold last call strike 55. 

Guess who only has 100 nio shares now. 

When u sell covered calls u take all the risk of owning the stock and have minimal upside. Why buy a stock in that case ?
Was almost in until you started using non-gaap and EBITDA aka cherry picking around the fact they're probably not making money due to debts or r&d or whatever they're mismanaging revenue on, won't spend my time finding out

Seriously, all you people what do you do to be this rich?

I am from 3rd world country, started investing US stock market with a small amount, seeing good progress so far.
why do you say that
It's a long time between now and early 2021... I think I'd rather park my cash in $PLTR for now and consider this stock in a few months :)

Thanks for sharing though! Looks really interesting. Here are some of my notes

* "semiconductor-based point-of-care ultrasound (‚ÄúPOCUS‚Äù) devices and related imaging and workflow software "
* Total investment of over $400 million with first product introduced in 2018, 700+ patents and 2020E revenue of $44 million, projected to grow to $138 million in 2022E

I'm going to pick up a few shares now just bc FOMO.

I'll buy in more once the FOMO bubble dies :)
FUCK, whittling

How do we get this option enabled on Robinhood?
We would need another new, massive, and sustained ‚Äúuncertainty‚Äù to appear between now and Mach 1st to achieve those levels. Especially because of the ‚Äòbuy the dip‚Äô mentality that has been reinforced after last March. 

Think about it, the market massively rewarded investors who bought on the way down, and made those who were extra cautious look foolish. People will not miss the chance again. 

The only foreseeable event I can think of would be a start of another war (Iran) or widespread civil unrest domestically.
This is the way.

Dont know what you're average price is. I got 150 shares at 14.20. The spac ratio is not that important. They set a price for the spac compared to a valuation of the company. The market can than adjust that price then with a cash secured backstop. Right now the market pays 2 times the set valuation. So I think were good. I am long on this shit. Will see what happens over the next 5 years. 

But is you are a true degenerate, all the ev spacs and small caps are getting pumped after Bidens victory. If you see the macro collapsing, do your think and sell low.

Nope. Still too early to go full bear. Between 0% interest, killing the dollar and bond market, and possible stimmy, the fed have made it to where the only place for investment growth is in equities.

I doubt the bubble will deflate anytime soon.

Not saying youre gonna go broke going for a longplay w/ puts, but theres gonna be a lot of heartburn. Better to snipe puts.

Everything at that level is done with intent. They wanted to show weakness. You shouldn't allow them the benefit. It's all a ploy. They spend tens of thousands on hair and makeup and shit. It was planned.
What do y‚Äôall think of DKNG 11/27 $51.50?
I think they are right on PLTR, but i mean, the massive boredom of having to wait a couple months while doing nothing because all your money is locked in stocks/long calls is unbearable. I started trading options on tuesday and shit is financial crack, i day traded like a lunatic for that sweet 25% profit, made a 50% on FUV in a couple of days and now i too have PLTR calls (slightly ITM exp April) and stock. I know it will moon but i also want to trade in other stuff because it's fun and profitable, fuck in this 4 days i made what i make in 2 months at my cuckjob!

TL;DR: options are crack, people want to do it more and more
but why
STANDBY. GAY BEAR TRADE IDEA TO FOLLOW. READ NO MORE IF YOU LIKE TO MAKE MONEY ON STONKS, MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENT ON TIME, AND ENJOY YOUR WEEKENDS.

Shit is wild right now. This bubble started when Cathy wood called for Tesla $4k or whatever the fuck a year or so ago. Many laughed at her but then amazingly enough Tesla did go to like $2500. This made the Tesla bulls look like geniuses which caused many people with no experience trading to start following Cathy‚Äôs other moves. The emergence of commission free trading on Robinhood and the like was a major factor here. 

What happened next was pretty amazing. Everything ARK bought the noobs bought. Everything the noobs bought ARK bought. Many ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù gurus emerged and began recommending stocks as if they were Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett‚Äôs love child despite not having any prior experience in tech, cloud, streaming, social platforms or any of the fundamentals that they were now experts in. But price is an amazing sentiment driver. If I buy stonk because I believe fundamentals are strong and it goes up, I attribute my gains to my amazing foresight, not mere randomness or luck. And so I am further reinforced in believing my retarded fundamental story.

This has created an enormous feedback loop that has now become a bubble. Because many of these stocks are relatively thinly traded, retail can cause a major spike in price which reaches escape velocity after this loop gets going. I do believe that in the next few months, possibly sooner a series of events are going to happen which will cause said bubble to burst.

I still believe Tesla‚Äôs breakout is the main creator of this bubble and we are in the late stages. Would not be surprised to see Tesla be the stock that leads the way down. I have much puts on $PINS, $FVRR, $PLTR, and will probably be adding more to $ARKK, $TSLA, $ROKU and some of the cloud names soon. IV in these stocks is extremely high of course but even so I believe this will be a hugely profitable trade it‚Äôs really just a matter of when not if this ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù trade crashes. üåàüêª

Lol no. Don‚Äôt take that self drive data at face value. Nearly 95% of accidents occur in parking lots. Which conveniently, self drive just cannot do right now. Obviously if you take data on highways and compare it to parking lots you‚Äôre going to get these skewed data sets that look like AI is safer but in reality it‚Äôs not. 

Im sorry but the google AI was a super limited type of experiment. But again, humans were the ones that created the AI. The AI could only output data that a human already imputed in.

I think you're overestimating the potential way too much. Lower your expectations significantly to stay grounded.

As for Oraldeyo, Takeda and CSL have most of the HAE market, which is around $2B now and expected to grow. Takeda's (Shire) big product is Takhzyro, which is injectable, but patients can administer it to themselves. Takhzyro is doing over $600M in sales already. $200M for BCRX could be a reasonable peak sales number, but it'll take a few years from launch to get there, and they will have significant sales/marketing costs so earnings won't be $200M. Maybe you can assume 30% of $200M at peak. But my guess is that if things go well for BCRX the price target is probably $8-12.

Additionally, if approval happens, you'll get a step up in valuation, but then the company likely raises more capital, and then you see how commercialization goes. Maybe they acquired right away and you get an control premium on top of the normal valuation step up. If the company gets a distributor, they'll split revenues but you'd expect a lower risk  commercial launch.

> Palantir designs data amalgamation software from the ground up for its clients, imbedding quite a bit of clever machine learning and artificial intelligence in that software. They hand the finished product over to their customer, they don't gate behind a shitty "products as a service" model. 

So its a services company valued at 30x revenue which spends 2 dollars for every dollar they make. Seems to me like the founders couldn't make this work in the last 17 years and are offloading it on the public markets.

Yeah, if it is ITM on your short position, you start losing money and risk assignment on expiration. If you play otm, you can still handle and downward movement as long as it's not too far down.

In my case, as long as NVDA doesn't drop $30 or more by expiration from the price I buy it two weeks ago, Ill get max profit.
When was that but for brief periods before crashes? Super low Vix as well as super high Vix makes me nervous
If you're really confident in your play, a real man would get SQQQ calls, on margin. Max leverage.

The market is on hard mode recently. Swinging randomly with long periods of flatness.

I had to leverage my entire portfolio into risky shit today just to break even EOD. And next week will probably be even shittier being a short holiday week.

The immunity seems to be a Thing that needs to be tested more in order to be sure. On the one hand other Coronavirus diseases create an immune respone that is measurable for Up to one year, on the other hand there seem to  be cases where people got Covid 19 twice in a Short time span. The thing is that the two vaccines that seem to be almost finished are mRNA based and thus they behave differently than normal ones and you will have to get them twice
so I wouldnt call it a conspiracy, it's just how vaccination Works. people get the flu vaccine every year e.g.

You know it's funny, we've priced in a stimulus because "talks going well" literally like 30 times over the past 6 months.

I'm gonna laugh my ass off if we approve the stimulus and somehow injecting money becomes a sell the news event. Just because it would rek all of us and be the most 2020 stock market shit ever.

You are still a moron even if you have a reason to be a moron. And he is an idiot regarding this specific subject/area. The whole talk he basically underlined how dumb he is. Dunning Kruger 120%.
So is SPI
Failed to execute ITM calls. Are you retarded?
This didn't happen. They issued a do not execute. Because they are a dogshit brokerage.
Thanks for the laugh!!

Why would Stripe do a SPAC when they could pull off a direct listing?

As someone who helped raise and close a SPAC (won't say which one), IMO Stripe is one of the least likely SPAC candidates I've ever heard. The promote friction is far, far, far more than any value Akman could bring to the table.

Airbnb, now...that's one I could believe.
That was one of them I would have bought more than one of on the way down. 149 every week. The 6/21 220s were cheap even leaps. TSM 96 and AMT 235 free next weeklies. Also MRVL 12/4, SWKS 5/21, TSM feb and spring. VZ spring and leaps  etc etc
The catalyst is that it was mentioned in WSB as DD.
They will execute if you can cover
All in on poor is the WSB way!
held my  485c's
Had more contracts than I could cover. They issued a do not exercise, making the entire batch expire worthless. Switch to TD.
Every Friday is gay Friday to me
Ehh they made a profit last quarter
In the military. Gov contracts come and go so rapidly. All this stock needs is a pullout from the government and they are gone!
The gold was more of a suggestion rather than anything, but you're right, it will not be safe to the dollar. The point is try to keep some chunk of money safe for a crash, and that the imagined infinite returns aren't real and aren't worth it.
Yeah Google is showing it too
Bro what you mad about?  Tell us what they did to you.
Hero. I applied to play him in a college role playing assignment. Teacher gave it to some wonder bread looking kid with a bowl cut. I got selected to play some random npc character and got reprimanded for giving an impromptu speech about weed...in a role playing experiment with no rules set in 1968
Pull out game doesn‚Äôt matter
Ah right, i dont have that view. So i feel vindicated:)
Will it drop to 17$ today by any chance? I thought it's a good pri3to get in
You‚Äôre retarded. Most companies working on developing a vaccine have stated that they will not take profit from it. The government will buy the vaccines to distribute it, but those companies will only take as much money as needed to cover the R&D and manufacturing
Not with that mentality bro. Gotta stay positive. Just went back into the green after being red since June. Put good vibes out there. Oh and don't be retarded.
I thought they did automatically if you had the funds to cover??

\> Says equities are in a bubble

\> when the market crashes, the dollar will rise 

\> says to buy gold

I agree with you on the bubble, but buying gold to insure against the market crashing (and the dollar rising as consequence) is like buying gasoline to insure against your house catching on fire.
Wait till this Berkeley retard makes that wrong move trying to be big brain and all his loser friends do the same and end up in debt and lose everything just to blame trump.

Hey, quick question because I'm to lazy to search for it myself. 

Does anyone know how long people get immunity from COVID with the vaccine?

Because the smart thing to do is to the company's selling the vaccine to create one that gives short term immunity so they can continuesly sell it.

If so, then when a company starts to launch the vaccines than it won't be too late to fomo in even after the pump.

Am I right or is this too much off a conspiracy?
Federal courts, recounts, audits, e.t.c

Jumia only goes up bro...
Something for the people here to mull about. Nearly every other post on here is about random stocks mooning: NIO, PLTR, CRSR etc etc. Mostly, the growth is driven by FOMO, almost like a gamma squeeze after gamma squeeze. Fundamentals don't matter, earnings don't matter, TAM doesn't matter, etc etc. There's a powerful feeling that if you don't throw money at it right now, you're missing out on unimaginable gains. We've been through this before, this is a classic bubble. It might pop tomorrow, it might pop next week, next month, or sometime next year, no one can predict it. So by all means play the FOMO and make money, but realize that if you over-leverage yourself, you aren't safe to a rug pull. So take profits once in a while, and put that shit into gold or whatever. You'll thank me later.

Honestly man I'm all for LUMN but the market is a unique animal. This isn't a 100% sure thing. Id do your research  on how to play options before you make a trade.

As much as I love trading options, you can lose money fast if things go the wrong way. Im betting pretty heavy my calls will print, if you really want to buy in, I'd go for the closest atm and the farthest possible date you're willing to buy. They'll be more expensive, but there will be less risk. January 2022 12c is probably pretty safe, try to get your fill closest to bid as possible, dont buy ask or mid.

Anyone know the strike price on his calls? Are they itm or a FD?

I'm so pissed I was out of service for almost all of the final 90min plunge. I saw that 3k of weekly gains were (temporarily) lost at like 320 and immediately took profits on slower plays to end up only snagging 50% of the dippingtons as I lost service as soon as it was filled. Those s3mi and fiveG companies were handing ITM 11/27 weeklies for heavy OTM prices. Best dip I've missed on buying in (with means) in months

I dont care about the money, I chase the thrill and being able to have something to do everyday. Thats the only reason I dont go yolo mode on weeklies everyday. If Im able to grow it to my goals, thatd be very nice. 

No I dont assume its easily accomplished. Ive been in this game for a while now, I know the survivorship bias, Ive also seen all the loss porn. I play believing that I can turn this into 6 figures, but I also deposited this money and every dollar in my options account is worth 0$ to me because gains are not realized till its back in my bank account.

You forgot la ganja.
Note that PLTR's business model is more similar to consulting-heavy companies like IBM than companies you may think of when you hear the phrase "tech" - FANG, etc. This difference is significant because they have a much lower margin on sales. Eg Facebook doesn't need to put in new effort for selling an additional ad or servicing a new user, but Palantir has to do a bunch of product & integrations work with their "Forward Deployed Engineers" each time they close a new customer.

That said, I might be mis-understanding what you are referring to by "tech" since the other company you listed sells mattresses. You're not wrong, technology is a huge part of that industry as well; it's just not normally what I'd think of when I hear the term "tech."

Man, I have a tiny portfolio right now. (only 20k). Im not rich by any means  but I have no sense of money and could care less about losing all this. 

I am already losing my mind, and without the markets I dont know what I would do with my life right now. its literally the only enjoyment ive had for the past 5 months. So I refuse to lose it all, i just want to keep playing.

Because of this my portfolio is literally the definition of kang gang. I wish i could show charts but my broker doesnt have it like robinhood does. It would literally just be a fucking heartbeat.

I remember it like it was just yesterday...

I jolted awake. I heard the talking first. I saw the yellowed drop ceiling, then the red-brown tiled floor. Slowly, steel appliances came into focus. Was that...fry oil I smelled?

Suddenly, the sound of a Karen ordering a four for four snapped me back to reality. I looked across the floor with horror to see my hand underneath the prep station - my wrist, only a bloodied stump.

The restaurant had been busy. It was the lunch rush during the annual Cuyahoga Valley accounting conference. I was chopping lettuce as fast as I could while watching TSLA moon on robinhood. The knife must have slipped while I was distracted.

TSLA! I panicked as a reached for my phone. I wiped blood off the screen and squinted through the pain...

+500% on my TSLA 500c! I panicked and went to hit the sell button only to smash my stump into the screen. FUCK! That had hurt but the calls were sold. I could finally quit Wendy‚Äôs. Losing my hand was worth it.

"What are you drinking?"

You choke on what you're drinking when you see who asked the question. She's tall, taller than you, and her smile has more upside than SPY.

"Uhm..."

"Sounds good." She waves the bartender over and orders both of you shots of tequila. You parrot her as she licks the palm-end of her thumb and forefinger and pours salt on the wet spots.

"What's your name?"

"Uhm..."

"Okay, 'Uhm,' what do you do?" After she asks, she takes the tequila shot without a blink. You follow and cough. As she sucks a lime wedge, you feel a forgotten part of yourself stir.

"...I day trade...like stocks and stuff." You smile proudly. This week was green. Between your well-timed Palantir and Draftkings calls, you turned $300 into $500.

"Really!? I made $4000 on weed stocks last week. I don't even smoke." As she opens her Robinhood app, you wave the bartender over and order two more shots.

A while back, some news came out and the stock tanked to like 35 cents or something at the end of Oct '19. I bought the $2 call I think. It was an over reaction and the stock itself ran like 700% over the next 5 trading days. I sold some on that run but also held some until it went near $4 a few months later.

Riley Reid always. She can take a pounding
I mean, if you got an actual solution or alternative go ahead and share. But public market means people buying in will cumulatively decide the value of the company. Ideally off of those yields or reasonable forward looking. But obviously the public determination of a company's value is often wildly wrong, and such things generally pop eventually if something becomes too overvalued.

I‚Äôm a partner of a Restaurant company with over 100 Restaurants‚Äôs not a single one of our locations nationwide uses it nor does a single Restaurant that I know. Never heard of them until today. They are probably backed by a couple known restaurant brands whose owners started the company. Their business model does not differentiate from Grub hub or Uber eats, door dash or Post-mates. They stand ZERO chance of competing with those companies. Their web traffic is down by 30 percent since May which gives us an idea of if they are growing or not. I‚Äôn comparison look at web traffic of ZM which is a completely different industry but has thrived since May under covid. Stock price is a lot based on future growth and revenue and this company will not compete with the big boys. Appreciate the DD but this is not  the one

I feel you. It's frustrating because they cannot understand something that is so obvious to you. I love Elon, dude is a role model. I wouldn't  take Jack as my role model, but you have to be inside your own little world to think Jack is actually retarded. Find out what you can learn from these people. God I wish people would be more aware of  own projections. Sure getting a chance to call someone more successful than you an idiot will makes you feel better about yourself, but be better than that.

I didn‚Äôt suggest it‚Äôs well thought through. But I do think there‚Äôs something to the idea that the goal of investing (in shares) should be in hopes that the company has an actual yield. The current system does not really achieve that.
You‚Äôre responding to a post where you cited NASCAR lynchings. Do I really need to show you‚Äôre bringing up random unhinged stuff from right wing forums? Normal people aren‚Äôt talking about nascar lynchings.

You started this whole thing by claiming the ActBlue campaign donation was a GoFundMe to Biden personally which is of course absurd when your candidate literally put an asterisk on his donation page that says 50% of every donation goes to his previous debts LOL (you have conveniently ignored this point of course even though it was the main point originally)

What does a stock broker or whoever people hire to invest their money do for the average Joe that invests a few hundred K with them? Just occasionally rotate between sectors? I bet a lot of them just put their clients money in SPY or VTI
Same thing happen to SPI as happen to SOLO last week . Last week solo was $6 and was basing / accumulating and nobody liked it . It was trading at like 1mil volume or 5 mil max then suddenly now it‚Äôs at 200 mil volume and at 12-13.50 today .. get in before the parabolic move y‚Äôall.
Viacom might be an interesting play because they own pluto tv which has oann. If there's a massive exodus from Fox news from their viewers Viacom probably gets more ad revenue through their free service which has that channel.

As a reference point kfc man's twitters seems to be retweeting oann clips over fox news.

How the hell can you have options, ie the right to buy or sell shares at a certain price by a certain date, if there's no damn selling of shares? And absolutely no way holding for life makes sense. What's the fucking point? It'd take like 20 years holding a 5%divi stock to get your money back, plus inflation. There's no reason at all to buy equities you can't sell. Or anything sensible for that matter. You want to buy a house or a car that you could never sell again? Why the fuck would you want a tiny percentage of ownership in a company you can't sell and maybe when you're 70 you'll have beaten inflation?

Wirecard is a bargain look at his chart!!!
Calm down too triggered
What‚Äôs up boys it‚Äôs time for the 2am shitpost, today I wrote a story many people are saying is the best, and it‚Äôs not even close. Get your popcorn and enjoy:


Steven was new to options but had been doing well, very well. He knew himself as the smartest in his friend group. This was reinforced to him by the fact he was up 300% all time and his stock-playing friends were up a boomer-esque 6%.

He had a thing for tech stocks. It seemed like every stock he picked he made money on. Lately, he just couldn‚Äôt lose.

His had a very unique edge. He used his own life experiences to pick his stocks. This is how he came to settle on Microsoft for his latest options play. Steve used Teams in school and Windows on his wfh laptop. And, lately, his girlfriend had started a job selling software or something online. He never really listened when she spoke, but her newly purchased Peloton spoke for itself.

Steven looked at the charts. The 1D, then the 1W, then the 1M. He looked at how low it fell during the crash a month prior. Finally, he felt confident. Microsoft was reporting earnings in a week and was going to rip. He bought 2 MSFT 180, a safe bet considering it was at 171 already.

Several days passed, his position slowly remaining steady. People on the sub whined about their calls losing value and something called theta. Losers, he thought. That‚Äôs what they get for listening to TA.

The day of reckoning. He woke up excitedly but a little late to check his good fortune. Microsoft was up to 177 and climbing! He was going to make serious money. He opened robinhood and - this must be a glitch. Robinhood was red, how could this be? He‚Äôd never seen the red theme before. He checked the sub, more people taking about bullshit TA now, IV crush or something.

Fuck! How could he be bested by TA! Then he looked closer...Fool! He had bought 180 puts not 180 calls! His account was ruined! No wonder it was red. Forget IV crush and theta. His account might be red but at least TA still means nothing. To think he had second guessed himself.

Oh well, there‚Äôs always next earnings to make it up; Steven thought he would just have to double down on calls. He went downstairs to ask his girlfriend for some more money to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù. She agreed and started transferring the money.

He looked at her phone and caught a glimpse of what looked like her transferring money, but... instead of Venmo... it was some app called OnlyFans. Fuck! He thought. Another new payment transfer app, that‚Äôs a bad look for his PayPal calls. He was gonna need more money. ‚ÄúDad... yes I‚Äôm doing fine... she‚Äôs good too... listen, what if I told you I could guarantee you 20% returns...‚Äù

Last flu season was 22,000 deaths. The US has 300,000,000 people so 1% dead would be 3,000,000. 22,000 is not even close to 3,000,000. You‚Äôre off by 99.27% LOL

COVID deaths are at 254,000 so far this year and the flu season isn‚Äôt even bad yet. COVID will get worse in the winter when everyone is inside too. So you‚Äôre off by at least a factor of 10x between the two with the year not even over

But sure make up some numbers that are completely wrong so you can deny science. You seem like the sorta person that is never convinced, no matter hot many facts. You must be so proud

"U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has decided to cancel the Antimicrobial Drug Advisory Committee meeting tentatively scheduled for January 14, 2021 to discuss the New Drug Application (NDA) for Defencath¬Æ.  When the FDA accepted for filing the Company‚Äôs submitted NDA and granted priority review, it set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of February 28, 2021 for the completion of its review for approval of the NDA.  The Agency noted that it was planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application for Defencath to be used as a catheter lock solution in hemodialysis patients for the prevention of catheter related blood stream infections (CRBSI) and that it had not identified any potential review issues at that time.  CorMedix has been notified that based on the Agency‚Äôs ongoing dialogue with the Company, discussion at an advisory committee is not needed, and it will continue to work on the application with CorMedix during the remainder of the review cycle."




Basically the fast track to FDA approval is going to happen and their product is clearly the best at reducing catheter infections. Several analysts have 20+ price targets

I chose excel because they just added the stocks data type and I want to explore it with this completely meaningless project but I didn't think I was going to end up explaining any of that to a gatekeeping fanboy.
so what you're saying is that if I make 100 calls I'll win?
Of course. Examining downside is part of good DD, was glad to contribute to your solid foundation. Hope others continue to add to it. 

I am cautiously bullish on PLTR. Name brands are big, and PLTR is _the_ name brand in the industry at this moment.  I see Fortune 100 companies unnecessarily outsource work to ‚Äúbig four‚Äù firms all the time, not because the quality of their work is necessarily worth the cost or better than the in-house work or a smaller consulting firm, but because the executives feel at ease with a name brand. I can see this effect happening to PLTR, too. So while other companies can do a better and cheaper job than PLTR , the fact their brand is so big and their clientele is so prestigious will help PLTR‚Äôs sales team a lot. 

I also like Thiel‚Äôs role in the company. He‚Äôs a controversial figure, but I think he has great insights and can see around corners.

It's a strategy where you collect premiums from selling cash-secured puts on stock you wouldn't mind owning. What you're seeing are the puts he wrote that expired worthless. What you're not seeing are the premiums he collected at the time of writing those puts. If, however, you get assigned then you sell covered calls and collect premiums until it gets called away. Which is what happened to his CRSR call.

And the customers also have unlimited contractors. Works both ways. We have no way of knowing how really important palantir is for nsa/Cia etc. Apart from what pltr says itself.

I can't be bothered to look in detail as I'm not interested in the stock. However this fool (I don't like fool, but it was a quick source) article:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/09/28/3-red-flags-in-palantirs-upcoming-direct-listing/

Claims that in 2019 palantir paid $240m in stock based comps, out of which about $55m went to the top 3 execs.

I doubt much has changed this year.
You hear the crunch of her avocado toast and laugh. "You know, that's why our generation can't have nice things." You're in your favorite breakfast spot, a few blocks from your condo. It's annoying that they only serve poached eggs on their sandwiches, but you forgive it because the coffee is great.

She doesn't sense the sarcasm in your joke. "Yeah, that's what they say. Meanwhile assholes half as smart as me get to play with thousands of dollars on Wall Street every day."

You put up a finger, about to correct her, and she surprises you by leaning forward and biting the upraised finger. With a wink, she leans back and takes another bite of her toast.

And in that moment you realize you don't deserve her. You are as poached as these terrible eggs. Your portfolio is soft and runny. Weeklies and leaps bleeding like yolk across a plate.

In desperation, you ask, "What would you invest in if you had those thousands of dollars?"
don't underestimate what might happen

1 freaking billion dollars of stock based compensation in 2020 alone?? In a company that couldn't turn a profit for 15 years? 

BTW, have a look at reported salaries. They range at $150k-$200k..not high but not low either. 

What happens when all those people cash out (I doubt that the amount is equally distributed as opposed to concentrated at the exec team, but anyhow). 

Wouldn't they all be waiting for this thing to go public so they can cash out? 

Investors in pltr have been writing off their investments year after year after year, and now it's ipo with a golden chance to exit. 

I got no idea what it'll do. I hope you all make money, but there are plenty of red flags on this one. 

Good luck. Do your research and be confident in what you invest.

Edit: also, if they meant to retain talent they wouldn't be slashing option values year after year either. That certainly doesn't retain anyone.

What do you do in IT ?

Bro why does our life suck so much that we're on wallstreetbets on a Friday night? The market is closed and there's literally nothing going on....but here we are refreshing every 2 minutes.
Like $1500 or something
The fact he‚Äôs backed by so many millions, hedge funds and it jumped to $25 makes me think they know something I don‚Äôt. So I threw $10k at the calls fully fine with losing the $10k. If it is Stripe, my thesis is it will definitely go above $35 by June. If not, then I lost $10k which I‚Äôm OK with. It could also be that I lose $10k on the calls but in 5 years, I make more than $10k on whatever PSTH becomes. But it‚Äôs a good risk to take because if it goes to $50, I make a decent $50k. If PSTH fails, I lose $10k on shares because of the 25% premium and $10k on calls which is also fine by me.

I did something similar with PLTR. I really really wanted to work for them because they pay their software engineers really well. I bought a TON of shares and calls when it was at $10 even though everyone was hating on it. I basically moved all the MSFT stock I get from my job into PLTR and made 6 figures in two months because I bought early.

I think for me it‚Äôs all about risk and reward. 80% of my portfolio is stocks. I like to play really risky option plays with the remaining 20% for fun. If I‚Äôm fine with the risk then whatever honestly and sometimes it pays off really well. Good stocks like PLTR will average out in years. And I‚Äôm fine holding for years, no rush.

I don't even have a view on palantir, but it's worth putting some facts out there that keep getting ommited from all those speculative posts.

You (all) need to do your own due diligence. Spend a few hours to read up the 10q and look at the Financials at least. You are putting your hard earned money into it, so at least do a bit of checking for any glaring issues.

If it doesn't "feel right" just move on to the next stock. There are so many, and many are bound to be good opportunities. Yes, some rallies will pass you by, but at least you will reduce the changes of getting recked.

At least keep and eye out for SPI next week y‚Äôall , if it ends up popping past $11 again or even $12 I would think it would run to $20 in an instant . Had like 8-10x volume today is a sympathy play for SOLO and NIO / XPEV / LI and TSLA. It is EV and also solar so a double whammy . Double attention . The people buying SOL will also buy SPI and even the SOLO people will get in if it pops . Huge sympathy play if we continue EV and solar run next week .

Edit : TSLA is also cross over EV and Solar

It‚Äôs literally illegal for them to manipulate the markets. Also the banks don‚Äôt own market makers. Market makers either work independently, for exchanges like NYSE, or for brokerage firms.

Not to mention that failing to abide by the BBO is a serious offense. You seriously don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, and now you‚Äôre doubling down into your conspiratorial bias.

So something that I've been hung up on prior to going hard on AMZN calls is stimmy news. 

Anyone know the timeframe congress has to reach a decision ? I know that "talks have begun" but how long do they have before going in recess?

I'd imagine a significant drop in retail if no decision is made, while if there is a confirmation of stimmy AMZM is gonna rocket to 3500 again. 

Plan is to listen for confirmation/denial and if there is a confirmation of stimmy just buy as many at the money weeklies as I can get
Or older than 70
Better than making a vague request to stop voter fraud and then pocketing most of the money

You are not even partially correct. The venue was an investment last year, and it was a mansion estate I bought and turned it into a venue, and it‚Äôs centrally located for serving 4 wedding markets. Do I regret buying it, no. Is it a difficult time for that business, absolutely. See, back to my point, which is you assume too much. The other description is, know it all.  And, the other businesses you also assumed for me to own, way off, like your original reply up top.

Its pretty funny how one  women can change a man. I had hit rock bottom this time last year and contemplated $ROPE with $40k in debt and no job, no real skill to dig myself out of it either. I was almost  certain this was the end of the road but somewhere along the way my buddy got me a job serving tables and I met this girl, super sweet, smart, pretty, all  around amazing human being. We got along great but as soon as she passed her bar exam I knew I was way out of my league so out of embarrassment I cut her off and never spoke to her again.  but she gave me a clear path on what type of man I wanted to be if I ever were to encounter her again and I picked myself from my boot straps, looked up highest paying jobs without a degree on google and found "sales" so with no sales experience I watched a dozen sales movies and read a ton of articles, I was ready, made a resume, sent it out to every sales job in my area on indeed and only was able to get 5 interviews. the interviews where brutal in one I sat in a room of 11 people and they asked each one of us what made me better than the guy next to us. I crushed it apparently because I got the job and so did one other person and you know what they say the rest is I history. this year was able to pay back significant part of my debt, move into a luxury apartment, finally buy a car, have some saving and food in my fridge. so for anyone having a hard time NEVR EVER GIVE UP! now if I can have the balls to message this girl again.

This stock ipo'd at 20 and got hit hard by a short piece not long after and dropped all the way down to 10 dollars a piece. I do believe at this current price, the stock is still undervalued for what they have already put on the table and will be putting on the table. The revenue of this company is set to explode from 2.3m quarterly revenue to 13 mil per quarter in the next 2 quarters with the increased capacity. The profit margin of the products sit at 30%. The market cap of this company is only at 416mil and could still easily be a multi bagger at this point.

Notable highlights for this quarter:

\- secured 100 ev stars order ( valued at 100k each car so 10m in potential revenue)

\- secured 16 school buses ( valued at 300k each bus so 4.8m in potential revenue)

\- able to produce 20 ev stars a month and 5 beasts a month starting next quarter

They have wide range of products from the transportation buses to school buses and to cargo vans. The Beast, the school bus, has been getting a lot of attention lately because it simply has the best specs out of all the ev school buses at a cheaper price point than most competitors. Its all cool and all but the real gem of the company lies upon their ev star series which is the only vehicle in same category that passes the Altoona test with a whooping score of 92 meaning that they are the only eligible vehicle of the category to get the 80% subsidy from the FTA fund. The ev stars is super flexible, customizable and can take on payload up to 5000 pounds which blows all competitors out of water. The ev stars are up and running at the San Deigo airport and have been the only operating transportation vans that they have been running since the pandemic. Green commuters initially placed 100 orders and went in for another 100 after the positive experience they have. Overall i am really bullish on this company and what they can put out in the future. Truly an overlooked ev company that has been delivering solid products and results.
Yup. I have never played them before but they almost doubled on vaccine new and cant have a good outlook for holiday season

Nerd
I already sold it cuz Cuck Schumer was trying to pump and probably bought calls.
While this is true, their stock is shit and almost doubled on vaccine news. Fat runup+poor sales+ poor holiday outlook = 12/4 15 puts
I think typical CC is 45 days ish out and 0.3 delta, close for 50% profit if reached or roll with 21 days left if not quite 50%, or if in the hole than roll 4 days prior to expiration. Think tastytrade had an episode on that. 

But i‚Äôm probably just gonna pick a strike price i‚Äôm comfortable with the shares being called away, and see what the premium is like on the weeklies or 12/18, cause im looking at these as a short term trade, im honestly not that comfortable holding them longer than a week or two, whole small cap EV feels like a bubble recently due to the crazy mooning. Or i will baghold if this thing drills into the earth. The IV on these are super high, as is expected with these stocks that have been super volatile and speculative, so i might as well sell some short term CC on them.
I have to let unaware gay bears know just in case they are lurking on the sidelines letting the tendies pass them by.

I have a screenshot of what I have left in my positions if you want the amounts, they're all still red:

TRST: They got delisted and now trade on the OTC for pennies on the dollar. The company was selling cannabis from an unauthorized warehouse and there is/was a class action lawsuit against them.

TBP: dropped as well, supposedly will have FDA approval soon on a cancer treatment drug for pain.

FLT: When I first bought Delivery Drone Canada it was at a dollar, I've been averaging down since. I still actually believe in the company long term, it trades on the TSX and I think OTC.

Plug gonna be $50 in June. Get ur calls further out mate.
When I started in 2018 I had invested into 2 penny stonks nvcn and jagx. Very terrible moves. About 2grand each...

After all that about a year later I stumbled across options... did solid that year made all the money I lost on those penny stonks plus sum with irobot and Activision.. but then this year was something else during all this covid shyyyt bought alot of calls trying to catch the rebound but I think I bought way to early and didnt give my calls enough time to play..

I was a plug option player before it exploded and was constantly playing weekly's there.. 

I now see my major problem was weekly's.. I lost about 60 percent of the time I played weekly's, not taking profit when I should have.

I will be back next time I will buy 8 - 12 month options. Enough gambling I'm going for real money.

Amen. The only thing that saved my account was two YOLO calls into Tesla which kept my account even at the start of the dip. But I got in halfway through the run up, so the gains were only baby gains.

Of course I have bias like everyone else. This sub is 70% posts sucking Elon off. I think Elon is brilliant but I also disagree with your idea of what vision means and the people who say Jacks a retard that the CCP found in a school and decided to make into a tech billionaire. Alibaba is vision, he founded it in 1999 when amazon barely existed so don‚Äôt tell me he saw what Amazon was doing and copied it lol

Cheer up. I feel your loss.. I also experienced lots of money loss. If you are really not good at trading, please don‚Äôt come back to stock market... some people are always just losing money unfortunately... save money and invest for housing or funds.. something more safe.
Word. I've got shares and a range of Jan/Apr (mostly Jan) calls and have been on the fence about what to do regarding earnings. Guess I'll just keep an eye on things the next two weeks. If we get a good up day, maybe I'll roll some of them out. Love your posts, always appreciate your insight!

Depends at  what time you bought today....for a second I thought I was a smooth operator buying SPY calls on that 3:30 dip, but then ten minutes later I was depressed doubling down in AH.
Just had a single put to have some skin in the game for fun. Definitely bearish but would be happy for people to win on this. Personally? I think the company is doodoo. Certainly a small element of FOMO since I had been looking into FCEL and chose to pass. Really would just like a bull thesis for it that is actually convincing.

I legit like your particular play, though. It is tempting.

Having lived in China, I recognize what you call "cultural difference" . It's self important arrogance. Listen to how Ma speaks, always talking about himself and how he sees things. This is very prevalent in "one child" China. And since he's so rich, he's used to people taking his word for holy scripture. Know that to be succesful in the PRC, you have to incredibly corrupt, so perhaps, more than hard work or tech knowledge, that's how he got succesful.

Althea Spinozzi

Summary:¬†¬†Investors crowded the issuance of euro-denominated Chinese government bonds yesterday, pushing yields of 5-year notes below zero. They might be betting that the People's Bank of China will ease the economy further even though it seems on the way to recovery. Indeed, some signals in the corporate space point to troubles ahead. Industrial corporate yields spiked this month signalling more defaults, which might ultimately weigh on the financial system. At the same time selling momentum in Chinese government bonds is picking up. A spike in government bond yields might deteriorate further corporate spreads, and the central bank might not have other option than intervening.

The delta on the lower strike ITM call will be higher. So for every dollar movement up on the underlying, you will gain more for the lower strike call. If you have to sell, sell the OTM and let the ITM run.

The theta is also lower on ITM call and benefits you.

Why not both ?
First off it‚Äôs commodities, which give you little return compared to better plays in the market. Secondly that mine has been on and off operationally since like the 1950‚Äôs. Thirdly, all the executives are finance guys, no real exposure to the mining world. Fourthly, they still have to send their shit to China to process it which can deal things and give the Chinese an opportunity to fuck with it since they own the rest of the market.
im ex military i can assure u nothing is going to happen. If the United States election is found  to be compromised by cheating of corruption or any high official is ever found guilty of corruption the United States would lose face and the world would be scared shirtless. America is the world's police if we are compromised by corruption  and tyranny the world would go up in flames.

Even if they find wrong doing they will sleep it under the rug. Its all about perception. Even if there is wrong doing its better to hide it and act like nothing happened.

GameStop going into digital service is a no brainer. Also, people who say wsb can‚Äôt move the market? Well, if 1.6m people threw in 1k that shit is more than GameStop‚Äôs market cap. I don‚Äôt think the institutional shorters understand what retard strength can accomplish.
Good analysis. Downsides I‚Äôve read about:

* Large amounts of PLTR revenue are tied to COVID-affected businesses, like airlines, and their total number of accounts is not huge (they focus on landing big contracts instead of lots of small ones)

* Some say their tech is old and there‚Äôs nothing special about it  

Many companies _claim_ they do machine learning. Not many can do it well. It‚Äôs only been in recent years that corporations are truly understanding and appreciating services like what PLTR offers.

you have limits on how much loans you can take out each semester, so 5k-7k depending if ur < or > 24 yrs old

So at most you can make a 5k-7k bet

If you TRULY believe Biden will accomplish 50k student loan forgiveness, 5k-7k is probably worth it

But then your gonna go out and invest AGAINST the market?!? That‚Äôs where the autism comes in

FFS just use that 5k-7k in long term calls on your favorite company on a day we see a dip

here's my list:

Band of brothers, Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders, Better call saul, GOT, Ozark, Rome, True Detective, The Witcher
One Piece
probably will have one and this will be the last one 

once vaccine is officially out tech will crash
Apple is trash
Hey guys, serious question about NIO ... like what are we buying shares in?  These are ‚Äúdepository shares‚Äù.  What does that even mean?  Do we have any ownership rights at all or anything?  Couldn‚Äôt Xi just yank it from the market at any point and what recourse would we have?
So, every single thing he‚Äôs invested in is morally sound? Bull.

Anyone who is mad about $18.14 is really going to enjoy Googling what lockup expiration is next month.
What happened to your bag holding positions? Did they ever turn green?
Do you have some yourself? I think with the sp500 hedge funds are gonna buy in by the weeks right?
You‚Äôre racist
So you‚Äôre a gay bear that won‚Äôt make money, the worst. Or are you just waiting for an IPO?

Like the whole chicken? The drum stick, I mean, sure. Who hasn't shoved a drumstick up their ass?
I have two in mind......

1). You pull a trevor milton with some company dealing with artificial intelligence. 

2). Launder money thru churches and religous organizations.
I‚Äôm feeling QQQ may not hit 300 again until 2025. Theta gang and their meager disgusting existence may be the only viable one for some time. QQQ will not give itself up so easily, so puts are also not the play.
Shoulda rolled it. No point letting the shares go
Not what is being said behind the curtain over there, gonna last a while
Just ordered some to try
Fucccck you
weekend dow blood green

How can you say that, there will not be ripple effect of tourism/realestate/aviation going down? In 2008/09 housing market showed the same isn't it?
Because the answer is always: TSLA.

That‚Äôs why they call it following the smart money
stocks only go up dumbass
No, your brain just doesn't work as well as others.
OI is aggregate so you‚Äôre probably missing the price move. Eg: If the options were purchased a week ago, your timing will be after the stocks were purchased and the price will have already gone up.
I would but you've probably seen it already
Daily reminder that we've loaded up the next 4 generations with a colossal, *civilizational* level of debt all to protect the boomers 401ks and so they can afford second homes (to rent to gen Z), and afford their annual vacations

Don't worry about next week, feel secure in knowing you bought BABA at a rare discount. And if you haven't, the answer is yes, this is a rare opportunity.
This ^^^ this is everything.

Seriously though, Jordan Peterson interview on Joe Rogan. Also, Tulsi Gabbard on JRE
Yeah tbh I wish I was in solo. I really gambled my money putting it in blink today.

You think buying into solo monday open is a good idea? It looks down 5% right now after hours
You can say that about Elon. If not Elon, someone else woulda had their EVs at the forefront of the transition to clean energy. The world was always inevitably going to realize it needed to find a renewable way of living, Elon didn‚Äôt start that
Long term (1-3 years) yes, the music will stop. That won‚Äôt stop the fed from being full retard and pumping this shit to 400 by February. Don‚Äôt be a cuck, ride the waves both up and down.

Yeah more normal finally.  Can always tell who the tourists are and who are the locals.  Locals will be hearing hoodies when its 65 degrees out and tourists will be in shorts and t shirts.  Hopefully don't see very many next week.

Do you know how much of the $847.8M went to employees? I'd be a bit sketched out if a big chunk went to few senior members
Haha, that was a twist!

That line of xpevs the xpeng posted on Twitter looked nice af. Nio doesn‚Äôt look as good

Tests don‚Äôt work though, Elon got 2 of 4 positive in same day.

Also, the Tanzanian president tried those tests firsts, a goat and a fruit tested positive, so they reject testing

Google ‚Äúfruit tests positive covid Tanzanian president‚Äù
Basically magnets are types of materials that are easy to align atoms. Atoms have positive and negative charges. Likes repel and opposites attract. Magents have a lot of atoms that are aligned in the same direction and some are better at holding this charge than others.

Not all contracts require buying shares. Some entities will just buy shares once to hold and sell covered calls continuously on them
So my 21 Jan 22 $12.5 calls that are already up 35% will print even more?  Sweet.
 I did listen , but I cant trade US calls on my broker, discovered that after doing the retard test
Just need 180
Why would a company spend 15 years in R&D only to sell out the moment it direct lists? I work for a company of similar size and economy that is going public soon and most of us employees would buy and hold, not exercise our sell options ASAP. A company of 2500 employees is much different than a stock market or this sub. It's not gonna come crashing down, there too much C. R. E. A. M in their customer base.
No, I bet you retards will sent dick pics first chance u get. But serious, 40 guys in a snap group from WSB is fucking golden.
great job now for some serious advice portion 20% of that into options trading. leave the rest in long hold stocks from now on
Or a bunch of people know there's more to the story than we know...
Exactly. It‚Äôs hilarious when 16 year olds on Robinhood say the CCP just decided to make Jack Ma a tech billionaire instead of a school teacher like he was. Then they wonder how they lost all their money on weekly calls
Looks like my twitchy finger history of cancelations and re-orders. Without the massive gains.
Just make sure you go real big because its only the small time peons that actually go to jail.
Let's not forget his multimillion dollar purchase of tlrd shares at about $6 recently trading at 4¬¢.
Next week it'll be 70 every day
Lol. There is no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù source here. Just all the Chinese forums and chat rooms, if you speak Chinese.
Every firm manager I‚Äôve spoken with disagrees. Currently 6T$ sitting on the sidelines that will be pouring into stocks once the vaccine is being distributed. The markets do not perform rationally. Everyone is anticipating a crash. That is not how crashes happen.

Legal team teasing too much info, I'm not thinking about it until it gets to supreme court
Price action this week and all catalysts point to us going down but seems too easy. So prob another rally. Plus low vol 3 day week is easier to pump
Op said 1% is 14 million cars. NIO don‚Äôt sell to poor people, their primary market is the top 20%
With those gains, I would honestly pull out and wait til February or March. Much bigger risk of a correction than continued record highs in this climate
Shameless is fun and has 10 seasons.
If PLTR is going to be a company that hits $100+ per share, there's no way that employees will sell at the end of the lockup period. The employees out of all people should know how well PLTR will do in the future. If they dump it all at the end of lockup, it means they don't have faith in PLTR. If PLTR is dumped on 12/31, PLTR has no future to begin with.
