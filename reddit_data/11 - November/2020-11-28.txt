Goddamn options. They are the worst if you don't know what you are doing, and I didn't either. Quickest way to lose money.

The more people try to run away from the responsibilities of marriage, the more the government realizes society will fall apart without people taking up those responsibilities. So now those responsibilities are gonna be forced on you if you been fucking for a while.

Don't fuck people you don't wanna take care of lol
There is no "in America." There are 50 states, and each state has, if any, it's own statutes or case law. In most cases, unless there is huge differential in income and wealth, there is no legal basis for support in cohabitation. I was with my ex for 11 years unmarried. We went our separate ways. I owed her legally nothing, and she certainly threatened. I owned the house, and she was legally a tenant paying rent in California. She had no fiduciary interest in the house which was my main asset.

I do want to point out that I paid off my SO's car, credit card debt, and $5k to find another place, but I did that because I am a nice guy, and I like her, but  I had absolutely no legal obligation.
Yes lol

And, all gamma squeezes end eventually when the market makers decide to dump all those shares.

As I said, OP is a retard. They lived together, but that doesn‚Äôt mean a cohabitation agreement is warranted. My best guess is that his GF convinced him to sign it when they moved in together because she planned to pressure him into staying with her. He could probably get it dealt with in court and have them rule in his favour, but obv he doesn‚Äôt have money for that.

All of 2018 was pretty nuts.  That was my first year trading, and in my opinion, the hardest year of the last 3 because it was so volatile, what with the Fed raising rates and causing corrections, yield inversions, etc.  I lost my ass that year.

To be fair, I lost my ass this year, too, but not from the crash... I lost my ass buying puts after the rebound, expecting another big dip.  This was more stupidity on my part than in 2018 though.

Anyway, all of the last 3 years have been pretty wild to me. Can't speak for before 2018 but I imagine the 2016 and 2017 were about like 2019.

And for wandering eyes- it happened to me. Twice. Total loss just shy of 6 figures. Took 6 months off-ish. Became self aware of my nature and would let the impulses dissolve before I made my moves. Basically let emotions die and let intuition take over. It dug me back out. Don‚Äôt chase losses. Accept them. Learn from them. Or in the words of this place - don‚Äôt doubt your vibe. But this isn‚Äôt about me and this is all I‚Äôll say about it. OP is really doing a lot for rookies and veterans alike by putting out the raw deal of things.

Feel free to add on and elaborate
‚ÄúA cohabitation agreement is a form of legal agreement reached between a couple who have chosen to live together. In some ways, such a couple may be treated like a married couple, such as when applying for a mortgage or working out child support. However, in some other areas, such as property rights, pensions and inheritance, they are treated differently.

A cohabitation agreement contains documentation for a couple who want to live together in order to protect themselves from unnecessary cost and litigation should their cohabitation break down. They can clearly regulate their property rights and what arrangements might be made for mutual financial support, dealing with debt, caring for children, etc.‚Äù

Any normal online broker will show you the new strikes being added prior to opening bell.

They are normally added as the result of a run up so if PLTR runs to $35 them may open up all the strikes to $50. Then you try and beat me to the punch as I buy them right at open. I play the front week not anything months out.

Will it always increase in value? Nope and the initial price you get is a total gamble, the prices can be brutal. Its a crap shot but if you have the balls to jump into the fire with zero ability to shop for a good price then you may win.

I do these on stocks I already made a lot in and don't mind risking a few grand on a sneaky 5 minute scalp.

Honestly, It is what it is. Can‚Äôt go back in time.  Calculate your net losses on your entire trading and not just what you blew this past year. That helps mentally.  Then remove yourself from anything market, wsb, or money related.  Find a hobby, read books, exercise, remember how much nicer it is to not worry about 9:30am to 4pm every day.  That comes really quick.

Sounds like you have a good job and can recoup which you should feel proud about that. Focus on  the mental comeback as thats 100x more important than the money right now.  Just get your confidence back and DON‚ÄôT compare yourself to others.  You‚Äôre not a degen once you stop being a degen.

I like these stocks under $10.  Ive been working a stradle strategy.  
Ill sell 1/15 the 7.50 put for 2.58 and buy the7.50 call for 1.73.

I have to set out 750 collateral but ill get paid 86 to take this position.

Heck maybe ill take a leap on the same concept.  
May 15 2021 7.50 put is 4.10 and the call is 3.40 so id be paid a credit of 70 for taking that position.  

Once and if it goes over $10 those puts will keep very little value. If you closed them around .70 youd get a free call to ride to üöÄ.

Roy Jones going down faster than PLTR at open
Well, I think people pay what they are willing to pay, and what they are purchasing is generally sexual attention as well as interpersonal connection (particularly one-on-one sex work like escorting, stripping, private camming). Value is really subjective, and it may be the case that you get an unattractive (or untalented) stripper demanding expensive tips before she will interact much with customers, but likely she won't get paid by many people. In this case, I find it particularly unbelievable that a woman would hire an unattractive male sex worker, especially since (looking online real quick), I can get a really fucking hot, nice dude who will apparently also go down on me for less than $300 usd/hour, and that is sight unseen. Noted; the world is a beautiful place. Maybe I'm starting to understand the appeal.


Anyway, women are also statistically less likely to hire a sex worker, by a lot. So yeah, maybe she is straight up paying GooglyEyes McDrugNose for sex, with the little money she has, but I seriously doubt it. There is probably some other bullshit happening. Which is my point - op needs to proceed with some fucking caution. I mean Jesus, this isn't exactly an odd opinion, if my dude had some questionable lady over to our house three times and she was his sex worker and he had emotions blah blah - NO. Lmao, NO! I'm all for sex work, but that's a conversation we should have *beforehand.* Especially before inviting someone to my house. If a dude or chick did this to me, I would smell bullshit no matter what. There's an additional layer of bullshit for OP's situation because it's an anomalous situation on top of all of that.

But who the fuck cares about the Greeks anyways, certainly not retards that go all in on calls for a single stock. You can usually infer just about everything about an option based on its price and how deep in/out of the money it is anyways. Unless you're building a hedge strategy where you need mathematical precision, which again, no one on WSB is.

>If you use that 10k to buy slightly OTM options for the same ABC company two weeks from now

#STOP BUYING WEEKLIES.#

God damn. It's the same fucking story every time, just like OP who lost everything on 0DTE lottery tickets.

If you retards would make your expirations a minimum of 3 - 6 months you could use the leverage options provide to hold through volatility as you would shares, and not have to worry so much about timing things.

I sold a $50C on CRSR expiring next summer to someone for $1k right before it dropped to  $40. Now had that been a weekly, the guy who bought it would be fucked. But it expires next summer, so even though he's taking a hit now, I'm almost certain he'll wind up positive before expiration.

If your money expires 30 days or less, that's your fault. No one is forcing you to buy FDs.
Great point. If you made big gains this year but lose them next year you still owe on those gains and the IRS does not accept promises.

I think you're oversimplifying the market though. I agree that a straight transition into e-commerce fulfillment isn't the long term winning strategy. But there's a reason a company like Chewy could succeed in a world full of physical pet stores and giant retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Targets. It comes down to specialization. Whether that's in store customer service for a confused mom trying to buy a gift for her son, or someone trying to find out what to trade in their Last of Us 2 copy for, there's demand for a specialized distributor of video games because the reality is, the products require someone who has expertise to market it  properly. I'm never going to walk into a Target and ask their electronics guy on what the newest game releases are for PS5. I've done that enough times at GameStop. Now add in specialized rewards programs, targeted and relevant marketing, and potential digital revenue streams (PowerUp rewards in-game items?) and I think you have a player that could carve out some segment of the market for itself. 

And look, I buy my dog food at Amazon. I get it, that's probably a good chunk of the market. But for every one of me, there is also someone (or half of someone) who prefers the Chewy experience.
You are jealous ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
High risk. No factory to mass produce these batteries yet. It is scheduled to start breaking ground 2021-2022 and first product release is scheduled for 2025. Also, what is the plan? Only sell to VW or license to other manufacturers as well? I am interested, but waiting for a pullback from Friday.

Lol I have been holding the opposite 364c 12/18. It's gotta break resistance and go to ATH for the callside to work out, where yours is a bet that it will bounce from ATH and return to previous support, probably 358. While your scenario is more likely, we've bounced off 364 quite a few times, and with increased FED buying I think Monday will be green, particularly QQQ. How green, and whether that carries over throughout the week is anybodys guess.
Part of me is scared for Roy Jones Jr's life but the other part thinks mike sounded high as hell.
Yeah the first month in which weekly holders have made money on PCG :). Otherwise for 2-3 months after its bankruptcy exit it would go up a bit only to reliably trend down completely screwing over call holders. The hate it gets it totally justified :)

Also gonna be selling most of my GME before Q3 ER on the 8th. Last ER they dipped about 13%, so I'll be buying the dip around 5%-7% drop and roll my calls  out to my April "safe zone" with also some FDs. Been on GME for a while and my only regret is not getting leap calls earlier. The immediate return of getting FD the rocket is to good tho since the last time it happened.

Not really, we are talking about 67 mil shares being shorted and in fact in nov the shorts added 1 mil stocks to be shorted from 66 mil.

Before the takeover they generally paid $2/year in dividends. So I‚Äôd say yes- but if it starts paying dividends again the boomers are gonna want all of it.
They have so much respect for each other. 

Unlike WSB and Andrew Left.

Usually pops up Sunday night or Monday morning.
It‚Äôs a written contract that touches on how two non married partners deal with living together, as well as what happens when they stop living together. People act like this is a Canadian thing, but it exists in the US too. 

Basically he signed a form that says he has to pay her money when they break up, which is something he went out and did voluntarily, and is not a legal requirement.

Yes. Consider what an option is. It's the "option" to buy or sell stock at a certain price any time before a certain date. You buy them because you're hoping the stock moves a certain way before expiration. The further in the future the option is, the more time there is for the stock to move in the direction you hoped.

You do have to pay more for options that are further in the future, so you don't get the same insane returns that you can from very short dated options which can go from like $0.05 to $5 overnight in some crazy cases. But trying to predict when a stock is gonna do that is just strait up gambling.
Server just crashed on crackstreams. Any other options?
I‚Äôm never wrong lol. That‚Äôs why I get paid by Wall Street lol
Luckily Virginia is the lowest child support
You‚Äôre supposed to take the number of pro forma outstanding shares and multiple it by the share price to get the market cap.

447.6M shares x $37 (Friday‚Äôs close price) =
$16.5B market cap (aka equity value).

Not sure where you are getting $1B from.

PLTR is looking at a short-term dip, then steady climb.

If you're long, plan on holding for a week.

He signed a cohabitation agreement with her. It‚Äôs not like you are forced to pay spousal support to any woman you happen to be with for a little while. He signed a contract, and now he‚Äôs paying for it
Congress bill still gives like 3 years before they need to delist. Plenty of time for calls to print.
damn bro umm you could always do the instant deposit for ANOTHER $1000 and then do TSLA $1 puts to get the money back anyways good luck and remember to live stream the results op
If you haven't watched it I HIGHLY recommend watching Mike Tyson's Mysteries on Hulu.
You got on the trend way too late that‚Äôs why the calls were hella expensive. Better luck running away from the feds!!

I think that if u dump her you will save a 10bagger.

However, she tells a different story to her friends. " My boyfriend is better than $PLTR bitches, see ya"
Yeah my father just retired at 31 years. The infantry is definitely different then other jobs in the Army, and living in Alaska (especially Fairbanks) takes its toll, and your unit can have a big impact too. For example we just got back from an Iraq deployment, were denied the opportunity for block leave to the lower 48 due to COVID, and jumped right into another rigorous training cycle (normally you‚Äôre in a red cycle, or a severely lowered operation tempo after a deployment). I‚Äôm planning on trying out for special forces this summer, and if that falls through then civil affairs or something. 

Yeah im trying to grind hard. I finished ranger school last year and am gonna attempt SF next summer, that has been my end goal for years. My body already feels old with everything. 

Advice is welcome from everyone. I can learn something from everyone on this planet, im sure of it.

Waiting for the video of Tyson (PLTR) uppercutting Jones (Citron) once this fight is over.
Wow - this is the first PCG post in a while where everyone isn't shaking their pitchforks! I was convinced PCG was one of the least loved stocks in WSB. 

Anyway, been in a position in some form in PCG for at least 6 months now. Currently in 2023 leaps - add whenever I can. It's my calm steady no rush at all play. I honestly don't think weeklies are good for this one.

Anyone wanting to play this, I'd urge you to get leaps. They are a steal, give you a good 3-4x leverage and peace of mind.
Solid gains on AT&T... any thoughts of dumping it and yolo something else? Great job; super envious.
Third highest comment? This subreddit is wack, even the comment section is going to be a gambling casino now
literally the worst. people really listen to that shit?
Citron going down like Nate Robinson on Monday
Dude I don't want to go to Vegas, I just need $350
aight respect to snoop at least for spitting some lines
I disagree. Options are a low risk strategy with a potential for big gains, if you understand what you‚Äôre doing. the downside is capped unless you‚Äôre writing naked options and even then a basic understanding of spreads is all you need.
Nice

So in the example you would pay $3200 for 100 shares of PLTR. All you really need to ask is if that is cheaper or more expensive than selling your option (is it truly worthless) and just buying the stock at whatever price it is currently trading at. My personal thought is it‚Äôs highly likely you can sell the options and make a little back, then buy the underlying, but that may not apply
to your position.

Tyson needs the money, and it's amazing how fit he is, but I dont see him lasting. Jones Jr. just has to make him run around the ring and he can knock him out later in the match
Earnings 12/8 if RC doesn‚Äôt act then it might stall out and the squeeze will either be lonely delayed until next earnings or it will happen slowly or not at all. Either way, try to get in on a dip but don‚Äôt wait too long, we just had a long consolidation period so if the dips come they may be little and short.

Step 1. Don't buy stocks based off of this group. Do your own research, don't rely on others to tell you what is a good investment.

You could form a hit country duo called Almost Mexico Canada Line
You don't understand options at all. You're comparing 10k worth of exposure via stock to 1M worth of exposure via options. (Only an approximation but 10k x 100 = 1M since options are leveraged 100-1 instruments). If you use 10k worth of exposure using options then your risk is down because your max loss is much lower.

I just joined to WSB community a week ago. I'm learning a lot. I finally understand what options are... sorta of. I have yet for my RB account to get approved.

But I understand if the share price goes below the break even price my contract becomes worthless and I potentially lose everything I bought into that contract. Right?

I like this post because of confirmation bias. I do not like it because it feels light on information. 

Here's my feelings on DKS. They are on track this year to have their most profitable year in the last 7, despite their Q1 being one of the worst they have seen in the last few years (can only go back so far in Webull on mobile). At the end of their Q1 earnings call, they expressed that they were positioning themselves well to capitalize well off of the new COVID landscape, rapidly ramping up online ordering and curbside pickup programs. There was a strong belief that by the winter they'd be kicking ass and that winter sales would also be extremely good. So far, this appears to be playing out. Q3 earnings were excellent. 

I believe they were also able to renegotiate many of their leases to be more favorable. Combine this with the above factors and Q4 should also prove excellent. They have brought expenses down while revenue has been increasing slightly. If revenue pops like they expect over the next quarter, they should finish with record earnings for the year.

DKS definitely has a few more dollars to gain. Maybe even more once COVID is under control. Unfortunately, this DD may be a little too late. The dip to low $50s a few weeks ago was the time to pick this up. DKS has a history of 10-15% run ups to earnings, dumping a bit, then receiving another, more gradual boost. I see DKS at $62 or $63 by EOY. 

My suggestion would be to wait until about 2-3 weeks before the next earnings and wait for any significant down day to scoop calls with strikes 10% out. Sell them the day before earnings, unless your  expirations are for a month or more out.

Full disclosure: holding 12/18 60Cs that were rolled out from 12/18 55Cs.

id say mma fell off first, then boxing followed falling once the hype of wilder went away and he got beat. i think theyre both dead now more or less. mma died with mcgregor going away and boxing died with wilder getting beat . the apex of mma was mcgregor vs aldo and how insane that knockout was and how hyped that fight was. nothing came close to that since.

Guys, youtube will still be here when you turn old. You are only young once.
AVXT - it‚Äôs AvePoint. Going public through a SPAC. That‚Äôs really the only one I‚Äôve been looking at. They have moved 28% last time I looked. Once they merger I‚Äôd suspect they start to take off.

Referrals are relatively easy to get these days. You might know a friend or you can straight up buy a referral. I'm not saying that individual didn't get a boost in the process but it was very slight compared to the actual interview process. I'd say it's 90% interview, 10% getting the interview.

If you're in the industry, you know that one of the primary benefits for mRNA vaccines is streamlined manufacturing. You can make massive amounts of the constructs with cell-free, in vitro transcription (plenty of established GMP facilities doing this...) which is much easier to set-up than a lot of other vaccine technologies. They've done it for over 60,000 doses for the clinical trials, and they are already scaling up and making millions of doses as we speak. 

Moderna isn't working out of their garage. They have a 200,000 square foot manufacturing facility outside of Boston that's been open for over 2 years. Lonza is going to help, but they aren't doing it all.
I think something is brewing. I'm just going to keep buying calls and see if something pops off. Making good money on these slow steady increases every day
Wife did a 500 share buy on FNGU for $38 back in March. It's over $200 right now. Hit over $240 in Sept. She tells me she ain't selling anytime soon. She would of had an easy +100k but I believe in her and she knows what she is doing.

so if roy isnt even taped up yet, this fight isnt starting for another 2 hours or something. how many fights are up on the card till the main event?
Any current plays you can share that we can jump in on?
this was the first boxing match I watched live but this really piqued my interest as someone not much into watching sports
No one here thinks they‚Äôre outsmarting Wall Street, WSB is just so retarded that anything big money predicts is the right move we do the opposite. Sell nio shares and take profits off a 100% price increase, no we hold and wait for even more tendies. Listen to multiple sources tell us Tesla is overvalued and could plummet soon, we buy options

>  If you want to see a recent example of short squeezes (with lower %s than GME), look at Tesla or OSTK (best example).

If it's so easy, where are the market makers?  Is the whole idea here that we're going against the market markers?  Does that not have the possibility of ending badly for us?

Do we just put market rate buy orders before opening on Monday for best results, or what?  Do you have to put any limit, or just straight market rate?  Thinking about possibly getting between 2 and 5 k$ -- all of the pay that goes into my brokerage on Monday!  YOLO!

Yes it's best to diversify. I learnt it hard way too. I went from 40K -> 95K -> 35K -> 80K -> 50K -> 175K. From 40K->95K it was pure luck and then i screwed up by betting big that brought me down. Then i started small and diversifying and got some good luck on the way. I also started cashing on my profits so as not to lose.
But he made a PLTR options play (call) that expired Nov. 27, 2020 AD. Oct 30, 2020 year of our lord.

Seems legit to me....

Thanks for posting. Your loss sucks, but it definitely serves as a reminder not to gamble what your not willing to loss. Given my recent winning streaks (from conservative put/calls not exceeding 1k), I was itching to invest more of my money that's in my savings and already invested in index funds. But your story just reminded me not to get to caught up in the euphoria this gamified day trading trend. Sticking to my strategy of staying conservative until my profits can cover any larger plays down the road.

And take this shit elsewhere. No one gives a fuck about your shitty relationship
Gay bearsüåàüêª puts aren‚Äôt safe but your virginities sure fucking are.
I loaded PLTR shares when they listed. When they started moving 5% a day up I loaded up on calls. Made about $11k this month. By far my best month ever. I even had spy puts in March and made about $5k. 

When 2020 started I had about $2k in my account. Now it‚Äôs at $25k some are deposits, but my return shows 101%.
I agree this whole card is a bad look for boxing tbh man

I work in the sector. The technology is good, moderna was a steady company. Now they are hyped like hell with all the pressure on getting the vaccine manufactured BUT without manufacturing capabilities or know-how for large scale they need to rely on eg Lonza. Mistakes will happen, Shit will hit the fan and they will get crushed. Shame they jumped on the PR game with PFE and AZN. 

Hope for the best, but beyond the great technology there is a big ask.

So if I wanted to yolo say 5-10k into PLTR options, how do I do it? I never bought or sold an option before btw.
Up here it's just something that happens after you live with someone for x amount of years. Often people aren't aware and get screwed when a break up happens and the other person is entitled to half your shit. I've heard some horror stories

Jake Paul took down Nate and crackstreams lol
Dude be strong. Don‚Äôt take the bull from your colleagues and friends that you HAVE to live within 30 min away from your company. There are always ways to find cheaper housing. You can commute and save tons of money. Yes commuting will suck but man‚Äôs gotta do what it takes. You can listen to audible or some other shit you like. Once you get used to it, time flies. 

I‚Äôm with you on this. I‚Äôve gambled and lost all what I had as well. I came from a rich family, but I decided to take on all the shit on my own. I also make good money. I now live somewhere in greater NYC roughly 1.5 hours away each way from the city (work) just to save on housing. My place is only worth $250K, less than my annual income. I spend <15% of my income and save and invest the rest. It snowballs very quickly. 

Gambling is all fun, but trust me take on shit hard on is even better.

Idk man. I had visions of grandeur and idealistic intentions when i first joined, but sometimes this organization makes me wonder. The pay is good, and i know i joined for the right reasons but the job im in isn‚Äôt right for me. I can always leave the infantry to do other things (which i plan on doing). If i had to say right now i am not staying in, but who knows i might love my next assignment. Also if i keep up my ridiculous returns then i might get out and be an entrepreneur and start a business.

Huh fuck
Let‚Äôs face it, GME services can be automated entirely. Consumers do not demand physical products outside of hardware and delivery fulfillment services are going to be the norm. I think much of GME survival will have to do with how their ‚Äòcompetitors‚Äô react to GME theoretical transition. Transitioning to e-commerce brings on a wealth of new competitors to their existing markets. Also what does GME offer exactly that can‚Äôt be replicated in other well established e-commerce services? Have they established a culture or social function or are they just pure play retailer? If GME can corner a segment within the already crowded e-commerce market they will have to create an entirely new experience or face being wiped out.

I'm in the same boat honestly. I've been convinced on this play by the fervor of the couple of big holders around this sub, and general concensus as far as I can tell seems to be: buy shares, don't risk it with options on this one.

I got some 15c options last week expiring 12/4 and they're up 120%. I'm planning on exercising them, as well as buying some calls for Jan-April.

Thanks. Appreciate the comment.

I want to believe wsb takes care of its people better than other communities around here. Call me naive?
Can I ask a dumb question here? When you say they opened new strikes, how far out do you mean? And where are you looking at these? I'm looking on RH (I know, I'm a noob tho) and some of the highest strike prices for say, Dec 31st, didn't even have a change in price in the last trading day. Are you saying that as soon as a new contract is available, it will immediately increase in price?
Just leave her. I‚Äôm buying more anyway on top of what I already have üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Is he still holding it?  I saw something about being required to report position changes if you own more than 5% of company, but it looks like Scion doesn't and/or no longer owns more than 5% of $GME.  Any evidence Dr Michael Burry still has the just-under-5% position open in $GME?
I‚Äôm starting to think Nate has no clue how to box and has no business being in there even though he‚Äôs against fucking Jake Paul

We know PLTR is volatile. So when I say ‚Äústay above $28‚Äù if means it has to go up early in the week or get out.

I would be looking to ditch if it wasn‚Äôt $31 by Thursday. Most of the decay is the last week.

Your just stating 1 of the very many outcomes that could happen if a manager starts paying his waiters.

How about luxury restaurants where price is not really a concern and most waiters would benefit from getting a wage. Also why would good servers make less than bad if everyone is getting a wage? Managers need to manage their waiters to make sure they are working.

Have you worked in a restaurant before?

This may be just the start of a never ending bubble- we have more people who have more access to the markets than ever before.  Accounts can literally be created and funded and trading options within an hour. 


Not to forget that the entire workforce is now shoving money into 401ks.  That wasn‚Äôt always the case.  Stocks and options have become way more common place and the average joe wants a piece of the action.  Even people with $50 are jumping on robinhood.  There‚Äôs no way 15 years ago, anyone was taking $50 dollars to a bank and asking to open up a trading account or mutual fund or accessing the market at all.
I just wanna point out, that you yourself actually voted it for spam! Not saying you‚Äôre wrong though!

Tesla factories are beyond what anyone else is doing. I believe the CyberTruck is a beta test for that type of manufacturing. If the process works then there could be a whole series of Cyber vehicles. With the new battery system built into the frame, the front end and the rear end being stamped out of one piece each, the body being folded out of a few pieces of stainless steel, and no paint shop needed, these cars are gonna roll off the press so efficiently and at such a low price nobody will come close. 

But aside from that, the EV market is so small right now and he so much room to grow, none of the competition matters that much right now. In 2030 when there‚Äôs a clear competitor to Tesla and the market has matured, then maybe we‚Äôd have to keep an eye on the competition more? But I mean I‚Äôm just gonna own their stock too.

Dudes just a boomer with a lot of money
Buying 200 shares of spce earlier this month.. 


Actually, probably spy puts in march
Same. Was down $1600 on spy puts and way out of the money Tesla calls lol. I was so pissed I deleted RH but didn't sell out of the nio stock I held since 1.60. figured I'd check in a couple years and see what happened. Then I made some more play money and am now back up $400 on a PLTR call, nio/tesla stock, and some airline moves. As long as you're still in and only 50% autistic, you have a chance!

It's not a lie. You can buy and sell spreads with long expiration. You can reduce the delta of stock positions by using options. Options can be used as a hedging instrument with lower exposure than a plain long or short position.
I didn't watch many Roy's fights, just relying on my logic. So you think,  if Tyson fought until 2018 (he was 52 then), he'd keep his average record?

12/4 42 C, 5/21 40 C.
I told you all about ASAN, but no you‚Äôre stuck refreshing your PLTR options.
PLTR is dropping next week and definitely not shooting up $40/share next week
It‚Äôs definitely possible to make very high returns on shares if you use 4 times margin. That‚Äôs what the 120k to 4.7 mil guy did.

CVS, Walmart and Walgreens all have initiatives and mechanisms to bypass MCK, they deal directly with generic manufactures for example.

Amazon has Pillpack and Haven Healthcare.

Just saying be cautious with MCK long term.
If PLTR hits $40 in three months, I will do not a damn thing. I promise. I miss the Tesla pumpers. They didn't seem as desperate as the PLTR crowd.

really? I looked at ur post history and you say you are a data scientist. Maybe you just aren't familiar with stats used in physical and biological research.

Radioactive decay, the example I give is **exactly** modeled by a Poisson process, unless our current belief in quantum mechanics turns out to be super wrong.

See here: https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/user/biyeun/Public/8.13/poisson/poisson_statistics_biyeun.pdf

For something like the price time series of a stock, geometric brownian motion is the "default starting" point for a mathematical model. But it's a shitty model for a lot of reasons, empirically we know the distribution is fatter tailed than the lognormal distribution. We know events on certain days will make certain day more volatile than others, etc etc.

All of those information and more can be incorporated into the formulation of a fair price, but it's impossible nor is it desirable to incorporate all the information available into a forecast of the fair price. It's undesirable because there's way to much information out there, it's impossible because of insiders will always have access to info that you don't.
"Heard"
Yeah man that was basically all he told us about, which I didn't mind. He had some awesome stories. We didn't have much to do in my engineering class that day, so we watched his ESPN 30 for 30 Segment with him commentating on it. It felt pretty special because the dude who was the star of the documentary... was sitting right in front of me.

It does make sense to cap how many people talk about a certain stock if 80% of the posts are about that stock and you‚Äôre going to claim you want to stop pump and dumps. Even if you don‚Äôt think this sub can effect the price of PLTR despite thousands of people desperately buying shares at the Ask price, it makes it impossible to talk about literally anything else and you know that 90% of those posts are just rocket emoji and ‚Äúwhen 40?‚Äù type posts and nothing of substance

Let me give you an example of a smaller company and the double standard you all are enforcing. The THC stock that everyone was mentioning is listed on Google as $862.36M but after the merger will be worth over $2B. Meanwhile there are tons of posts about GME and have been for months at this point. Google shows GME at a $1.05B market cap right now at $16.08 which means it was under $1B market cap this entire time until one day ago

My friend literally made one post where he said the sub may be about that THC stock this week but next month will be all about Airbnb. He mentioned a stock one time that is arguably twice the market cap of GME and he was permanently banned with no way to appeal.

You must admit GME has been one of the top stocks pumped here for weeks and it‚Äôs been under a billion market cap. I understand moderation can‚Äôt be perfect but a permanent ban for mentioning a ticker once that he doesn‚Äôt even own and wasn‚Äôt pumping seems quite ridiculous given the flagrant pumping of GME (and PLTR despite a larger market cap)

It‚Äôs the fact that everyone knows you all let things like GME stick around for literally months while having zero tolerance for other things that are similar. It feels extremely unfair to see people get a permanent ban with no warning for behavior like that. And I‚Äôve seen numerous reports of it in the sub.

You would never want to exercise a contract where the premium is almost worthless because that means it isn't ITM. If you want shares of PLTR, sell this contract and just buy them outright. 

Or you can wait a few days, see if it recovers this week and hopefully sell the contract for a profit.

Hey bud, I discovered options and took $80k to $18k at 26 years old. The principle was contributed from hard ass work grinding, no handouts, nothing like that. It sucks. It was all I had that was an accomplishment and I blew it. Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs on the same scale but just wanted to let you know as time goes on it eases and you feel better.
Go for 20. 5 isn't diversified enough, 50 is likely too much to really keep track of but is better from a risk standpoint.  If you don't feel like spending the time researching then go the ETF route for sectors you want to invest in.

Where you invest is your business. But there is zero reason MCK is the eighth largest company in the USA. They don't innovate, discover, develop or actually own products.

The current attack on pharma and price controls is misguided unless you also include PBMs, insurance companies and the distributors. 

Hopefully a holistic approach will be progressed to eliminate parasitic business models and rebates.

I don't get the obsession with them "dying". What points to that? Games are not going 100% digital in the next 6-7 years at minimum, since we know 80% of the new gen consoles will have discs. Will the next gen go from 80% disc consoles to 0%? Highly unlikely. 


There clearly is no bankruptcy risk for the next 3 years at minimum, and there may be some risk after that, but not a clear path to bankruptcy either. 

It's not a binary story. Given the valuation today, the revenue they still generate and will continue to generate, and the acknowledgement of the problem they have (as pointed out by many), there's enough evidence that there's a decent chance things could pan out for them. How that world looks like no ones knows yet really, but it's not one where GameStop ceases to exist. And I'm willing to take a chance on that because if right, the payoffs are generous.
maybe a different company then. but I thought they made a filing for a share buy back by x date (in the coming months)

Nah. Actually happy for him. However, the OP is maxing our credit cards, borrowing money, eating ramen, and refusing to sell a decent position. The person is incredibly over leveraged and has struck gold. Why hold out for another million? Cash out half and if it goes up you still have half there. Goes to zero (which isn‚Äôt crazy for a Chinese company) then you still have almost a million cashed out. Gambling at its finest.

They wouldn't be better off, they would never make what they do now and you would just pay more. The company would would need to increase prices by 20% + sales tax where ever you are to make up the cost. So let's say 26% increase food and then 20% would go to the server. The good servers would make less and the bad servers might make slightly more. 


Either way I've never understood people like you, if you don't want to tip just don't go out to eat at places that have servers. It's really not that hard to do. Or just go to buffets, you are using every justification possible to just be a cheap ass and you're proud of it.

I have some calls that would love that.
That sounds like a good plan, your post actually just made me think about my strategy and my plan kind of came into place.I have a couple questions for you if you don‚Äôt mind. 

What do you use to monitor volume and price? 

What do you typically stop out at? Have you ever had a big gap down trigger a stop that lost a significant amount? 

I just passed the $25k mark last week so since I can day trade now I don‚Äôt see any reason to not have super tight stops and then just buy back in if it looks okay. Any potential issues with that? 

So along with the tight stops. I‚Äôm going to give myself $4,000 a month to make plays with, ideally between 2-3 different stocks. I‚Äôll have a few different criteria for cashing out. 50% return, $1,000-$1,500 return, 30 days after opening a position I close it out no matter what (give or take a week if something is popping). 75% of the profits go to pay off my credit cards, the remaining 25% goes into Tesla.

My Fidelity account is at 200K rn. Found out once you have like 500K with them you get special pricing on IPO‚Äôs.

You're a fucking liar like everyone else on this subreddit you dumb fucking retarded piece of shit

What‚Äôs a play this week other than PLTR and GME?
We aren't talking about options and your point is still irrelevant. OP said he was buying shares and going to sell them in 2 years, meaning he would hold them through a short squeeze in the near/mid-term. If there is no squeeze, then yes, sure, sell them in 2 years and it will probably be an okay profit. But that isn't the scenario anyone is talking about here.
This is one of the most retarded posts I've ever seen

Most investors are worried about downside risk which would be a) another company having a better vaccine (unlikely when mRNA is king) or b) Moderna not getting the EUA (it's a pandemic. unless this vaccine kills grandma, it won't be stopped - and it hasn't killed any elderly in the 30,000 person trial).

If you're on WSB you're ready to gamble. This shit is going to fly when that downside risk dissipates.

No margin or anything stupid like that. It‚Äôs really not that hard when it‚Äôs compounded. You can see I‚Äôve made the majority of it in the past few months while I‚Äôve had a larger account. Same percentage but more $$
Ok... So, lets say the PLTR trades sideways for the next two weeks and I hold the option until expire date while watching the premium slowly go from $10 to $7 to just about worthless now... Can't I still purchase the underlying stock for the $22 call option? 

The reason this is a stupid idea is that I am still losing the cost of the option play and just buying the stock... correct?

Basically buy GME and hold till next year. Im all in on monday with 20 shares üöÄüöÄüöÄ
No options for a couple weeks but then I will add calls to my shares
I totally agree with you, but it's really hard to time when they are going to tank.
We don't know when the GM deal with go through or die.

I guess you have more shares coming out of lockup, as a catalyst for your Puts?

You paid a premium of 10 for the right to exercise a contract with a 22 strike. Effectively making you pay 32 per share. You‚Äôd end up paying more money this way than by simply buying 100 shares right now

Yep should be a good affect. 
They caught the manufacturer defective swingarm before it killed anyone. Toyota, Ford, Fiat and Nissan would have waited until there was 100 deaths to fix a known issue. Anyone remember the Toyota carpet disaster? 

Point is Tesla found out it was a manufacturer defect of material. Chances are good by the end of 2025 they will manufacture 95% of their products in house if no other reason than to eliminate as many manufacturing variables as possible.
Woah
It seems a little too late don‚Äôt you think a lot of people already piled in
I suppose for longer term plays it's not too inhibitive, but definitely hampers for short term plays or options
This is so fucking dumb y‚Äôall are outta control over here.
Not too late. News driven rally should be at least a few days. Sell on Wed morning
[Here](https://youtu.be/5ejzJikeKGU?t=653) you go fam. Personally, I think GM is still desperate enough to have an EV sub-brand so the deal will likely go through on Dec 3rd.
That's why I'm going $499! Tendies!
Anyone thinking the stripe rumors are true
I like their chocolates you son of a bitch.

Well certainly it‚Äôs a big account but yeah they‚Äôre dicks

They usually require $500k not including 401k unless the underwriter is KKR or something and then it‚Äôs $100k

I expect the $500k cutoff for this one since Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the main underwriters

FYI Schwab and TD sued Fidelity for blocking them from accessing IPOs. It‚Äôs purely some bullshit
Yes, you will gain $576 from the shares but lose $705 by exercising the contract 

You will lose $129 dollars overall (the remaining extrinsic value on the contract). Study up on intrinsic/extrinsic value.
Yeah running is awful. Definitely puts are warranted. Also puts on my success in completing this marathon in spring. Lol.

lol selling at the top is so easy but 99.9% of you guys struggle to do it. This is the top.
Hmm I think it would still make sense to sell and then buy the underlying. If you have lost money on the option then that means the underlying has lost value. I think you would still be losing your money from the contract fee, whereas if you sold you would only lose the difference in the fee.
Am I the only one that's gonna jump on this?

I‚Äôm in. All you had to say was a non pltr pitch. Only got $100 to put in unless I pull out of Tesla though.
Drugs will do that.
I like that it's flaired satire in case someone didn't mistake it for DD
Has he ever done this or mentioned that he would do this though? If not then that‚Äôs just another big if out of many for this to make us any money.
Sure, but the chance of a squeeze is significantly lower than the chance the price is higher in 2 years than today. Sure you could buy options to try to capitalize on a squeeze that may never happen, but you assume way more risk than investing in equity with decent potential for upside. And if it squeezes, great, get out when it's $100+
üíØ agreed, but I sense a surprise factor this time with PLTR. Even wsb is behind it, I got in at 10s & 12s and not looking to sell anytime in the near future.

 You are right, Left gainedüöÄüöÄShorts with Tesla & nvidia for a brief moment. He had breathing time to get out. I doubt he will this time with PLTR, I don't see stock offering, fed rates, covid recovery, growth invest holding PLTR, everything looks positive. With Biden winning we will see more contracts being awarded to pltr, Insider sentiment is strong and the last time I spoke with folks no one is looking out. Citron is betting on dec 31 (PTON comes to my mind), my money is earnings beat & a stronger forecast. Ark holds a million shares and I'm sure after earnings will increase stake.
Valuations are based on more than TAM. Otherwise if I were to submit an application to a DoD contract I would immediately be worth $225B üòÇ

I'm not gonna lie, for all of those trades you listed above I thought ppl were dumb for investing. Then when they started to lift off, I jumped in and was able to get a lil juice out of them, but almost always missed the huge run up. I always kicked myself for not investing earlier or even more. Not this time! I'm gonna get in on this ASAP, cause why the F\*&K not!!!!

Wouldn't buying 100 shares at $22 be a net positive purchase if the current price is 27.66? Aren't I gaining 5.76 worth of value per share? 

Maybe you've missed this - but I am down on the contract as I purchased the contracts Friday morning for $10.00 premium and it's currently at $7.05. 

I'm clearly missing something - if you'd like to help me understand better, that would be nice. Thanks.

Sept. 3 #neverforget
When you donate money to less fortunate, it also serves as a reminder of how dumb our anxiety is. We're up here worrying about whether we're going to make $50,000 on Palantir or merely $5,000. Whereas if you give some family $200 they can probably eat ok for a month.

It relieves stress and also when the proletariat revolt comes they might kill you last.

WSB people seriously need to start investing in cryptocurrancies. That shit never sleeps.
Lol what I was trying to imply, Cohen has more money than this sub..combined...10x over, at least. I think he will protect his investment and will buy any dip in the short term to start the squeeze. They don‚Äôt give a shit if some WSB and robinhooders paper hand.

probably fake story
It‚Äôs like buying deep itm leaps
I think we will get a little squeeze next week, some shorts will likely cover if prices keep rising
A major investor picking up a sizable stake 10% or more could be the catalyst. And no clue, they could transition into a far more online version of themselves which I think would be successful. Remember even at its current price its only worth 1B. So announcing a transition that could make it a 20B company would shoot up the share price 10x or more without a squeeze, 50x with a squeeze

short term OTM calls
I bought an option that is ITM but I'm net negative as I purchased it Friday morning and it's down. I was thinking, if it's down still next week, I'd just buy the shares outright and wait for the stock to rise in the next few months... perhaps I'm missing something.
The market is closed
You really shouldn't be doing this shit if you have no idea how it works. 

Your call option still has 2 weeks of extrinsic value left so it would make more sense for you to sell it back into the open market and then buy shares of PLTR at the current price. 

PLTR closed at 27.66
Your option is worth 7.05

If you exercised, that contract disintegrates. You would have bought 100 shares at $22 for a total of $2200. The stock is currently 27.66, a difference of $5.76, which is less than the $7.05 the contract is currently worth (contract has $1.29 of extrinsic value which is what you are literally burning by exercising)

You‚Äôre confusing my intent with this post. You can sell at any point. I‚Äôm referring to ways in which your shares would be lent to add to shortable supply, that doesn‚Äôt do dick to your ability to dispose of your shares.
Is that the audit stuff that came out yesterday? That's all I'm seeing.

No options a deal breaker for me. 20% growth a week max, and 2 days settlement after sale on cash account. Nah, I'll pass.  Its weird to see these boomer gains being pumped on wsb. Kinda fishy
Others are right, the bill won't pass the Senate. Forget about it.

Furthermore, this bill is to decriminalize rather than legalize. They are not the same thing. Do some DD on that. Legalization would be a whole lot better than decriminalization.

convince me that buying 1k of shares of GME and picking up $40 Jan 8th, 2021 leaps is the way

I have been told buying alone will help contribute to this feedback loop of what is estimated to be the already low single digit percent collective ownership that wsb has over the total number of shares
I agree, better to invest in a company that already has an established product, customer base, and sound business model. When it comes to EV‚Äôs Tesla and NIO are my top picks.

What resources did you use to teach yourself
It‚Äôs funny. In September I thought this company‚Äôs IPO sounded like we were going to pick up Thiel and Karp‚Äôs bags. The more I learn about it the more I realize this company is skynet with a higher margin. And for that reason I‚Äôm in.

Positions: 1 lot with covered calls, but I think I‚Äôm going to add a hell of a lot more after this video.
I'm very glad that you are leaving her ass regardless of what this meme stock does. Here's hoping it hits 50 instead.
Thankfully this sub is slowly but surely easing out of the PLTR hype, was scared of a sub wipe tbh
Major distribution yes 3-4 months out, but the market is generally forward looking, so I anticipate once the media and market focuses on vaccine logistics, this is where the play will be.


Do you buy and hold or are you doing options?
Where are the mods? 2 months old account, mostly deleted posts including "how to open account without SSN," and recently only PLTR spam begging us to invest so his shitty position springs back.
Let's say you do believe ccl will recover.. or atleast still be around in 2022. If I was as fortunate as you are to have 50k to drop, then I'd tell you to. 

Buy 2500 shares and sell 25 calls on a weekly basis for a minimum of 50 bucks.. 2 years later.. $125,000. Plus if ccl does begin to recover, you will be able to sell more than 50 bucks in premium much easier. Also, if it does reach 70 again, your stock value will more than triple. 175k in stock plus premium,.. 325k +++++

The only way a 2022 option with 50k will net that would be a close to the money option going from the current 8.00 a share to 52.00 a share, or a way otm going from 1.00 to about 7.00

If you wanna yolo otm options, please do, because my idea is prolly dumb
Just think, your loss was somebody's gain.
Market would throw a tantrum
FWIW, there is only one thing that is certain in the Street. If you think NKLA or anything is going down for sure, it does the opposite. You can bank on it, IMHO!

What is that infamous saying?  Markets can remain irrational lot longer that you can stay solvent. Yeapers, that is it. ;)

Also could you wait and sell the options 1/1?
Tell me how dumb this is: 

I purchased PLTR 12/11 22C for $10.00 premium on Friday morning. 
premium is now $7.05 due to PLTR having a red day Friday. 

The call is technically in the money but I am down 28% on the trade. I know I have two weeks to regain it's value but I was thinking about "worse case scenario" in just buying the underlying stock as a buy and hold asset. 

Tell me why I'm an idiot.
Do you think GME will dip before it rockets? I'm hesitant to buy at open because I'm thinking it will.
Thinking of taking profits from PLTR, moving a chunk into GME (only for the squeeze, the company is dogshit otherwise) and setting a trailing stop loss. What do you think?
Just buy all the warrants around 0.5 for 1k and sell them after 2 months for 2$ a piece! Rinse and repeat!

To be real with you, whether PLTR goes up or down .01, you need to kick her out fast. If she‚Äôs throwing abuse accusations around just between you and her, imagine what she may be telling other people. That is shit no one should deal with, and I don‚Äôt want you to spend your gains on lawyer fees.

Makes sense that they are trying to get the refrigerated version. Dry ice is the key here, we need an operation warp speed of ramping up dry ice production as i hear it will be in short supply. It would be insane that we pump billions into research of the quickest vaccine to market and have it rendered essentially useless if we cant figure out the logistics involving cold chain management. I know nothing about the production of dry ice other than it is CO2, so not sure if this is that challenging of a problem to overcome.

Thank you for this post. 

As someone who was investing at the time, a bit more background color on the great VW short squeeze:

(1) It was the great recession of 2008-2009. Car companies were going down in share price around the world. GM eventually bankrupt, F went to around $1.70). It seemed like a no-brainer to short VW also, so many did.

(2) There were suicides from managers who shorted VW and then faced infinite losses. There is a line in the Big Short from Brad Pitt about not dancing, it is applicable here.

(3) The VW squeeze was so bad that it risked tipping major financial players in a fragile time. My impression is that a smoke filled room convened and decided it was in the best interest of the world that some shares be made available from the large VW players to allow the short positions to unwind, and Porche released some. Hence the shares were only at 1000 Euro for one single day, then down to the 500s by the end of week.

(4) Mentioned in the linked source, but worth highlighting:The squeeze on share price made VW the biggest market cap public company in the world.

This vaccine will be a boost to distributors until at least April.  


Not sure McKesson is going to make that much from it.  Our healthcare facility is under contract to pick the vaccine up from a distribution center directly.  


Wag, CVS, are good plays.  Not only will they make $$ from the vaccine administration, but they will make a ton of money from increase foot traffic. And when real shopping resumes, people stop at Walgreens for sales or snacks etc, so when retail comes back around in 6 months, they will be booming.  Don‚Äôt act like in person shopping is dead, there are so many people who want to just get the eff out of their house after all this.

Anyone hopping on GME? April 30c (even tho it's literally as far OTM as it goes) is still kinda expensive. If the stock were to actually almost double to 30, the contract value would maybe triple.

 It's almost more worth it to buy shares.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-proctergamble-results-idUSKCN1UP1AD](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-proctergamble-results-idUSKCN1UP1AD)

"Net sales in the grooming business, which includes Gillette, have declined in 11 out of the last 12 quarters."

[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/procter-gamble-writes-down-gillette-business-but-remains-confident-in-its-future.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/procter-gamble-writes-down-gillette-business-but-remains-confident-in-its-future.html)

The consumer products giant gave two reasons for the write-down.  First, the company said that currency devaluations since the carrying  values were first established in 2005 played a significant role. Over  the last decade, currency has hurt its global business.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve  got here a business with a very broad global footprint, and particularly  with the year that we have just been through, that impacts that value  assessment,‚Äù Moeller said.

P&G‚Äôs second reason for the  write-down is the market contraction of blades and razors, primarily in  developed markets. In countries like the United States, growing beards  is more popular, leading fewer men to buy razors. Gillette held a 52.8%  market share of men‚Äôs razors and blades in the U.S. last year, according  to Euromonitor.

Citron is all about the long-term game.  The collective attention span of this sub is about a week.  It's foolish for them to try and predict the date for when it will drop.  

It's not going to drop instantaneously.  Peloton is still coasting to its apoapsis - you can't stop it.  Like all exercise equipment, it will fade away and you will find them on the side of the road.

If you really want to own PTON - go buy a bike and ride it for 100 days.  If you're still into it after the 100th day, buy the stock.  Otherwise, short that shit.

Sir, this is a... this is a... wait, WTF are we now?
This might make me seem even dumber than I am but I just set ridiculously tight stop losses bro. I risk like 2% on my trades and just balls deep. Like 25% of my portfolio just pumped in on a spike. And if it rips I just go brrrrr and take profit. 

Look at the monthly chart on my account P/L. There‚Äôs no dips. I just risk it for the biscuit and I always eat the biscuits.

Intel specific advice, the writing was on the wall on the first AMD pump from $50-$70 from negative INTEL news regarding 7nm. Apple is also going off Intel and making their own chips. 

This means paradigm shift, short Intel on all pops and buy AMD which is going to be 100+ soon.

I suggest making monthly reports to your partner, that will stop losses quickly. I'm in the process of reporting end of month for accountability.

When your account reaches a max monthly draw down then it's time to kick yourself off and stop for a month entirely. Easier said than done yes.

Also with that amount of capital can't go wrong with properly or gold physical, why is property good (even if US may be in a slight bubble) it's highly illiquid. Essentially a forced savings scheme by the govt.

~~You bought shares, of the stock.~~
Question for option experts, so let's say i bought 10 PLTR $20 Jan 2022 leap calls. If I believe PLTR will go up even more and that my calls will become more ITM, would it make sense to "roll" my calls by selling them and buy $-equivalent amount of OTM calls (so maybe 15 $30 calls) since they would have more upside and should net me more gains if PLTR does go up?
Uh oh
This is why I never regret spending $40 after busting in a girl to buy her Plan B lmao

It does to a degree. There are cohabitation agreements for every state that can be just a legally binding as any marriage. Hard to do if you actually read it but...

Etsy already is on a huge rebound I meant to buy it last week it got punished after the vaccines were announced it looked cheap as s*** and we're going into Christmas where people are still going to buy s*** ton online are going to want special gifts at sea is going to kill it but it's also up now like 20 25% in the last week probably will keep going a little more
Dont play. Get checked
Hard to say because it would depend on the terms of any settlement or court verdict. The Trump administration recently finalized a rule that to privatize, they need $280 billion in capital. Sounds like a lot, but they have over $60 on the books now. Even if they bottowed say $250 billion at prime (2%) bonds, that‚Äôs 5 billion a year in interest and they make 2-3x that now.

Let‚Äôs say they pay 10 billion in interest. That leaves them with say 5 billion in profits. Bank type companies trade at 8-15x P/E. So 40 billion-70 billion.

That‚Äôs 20-40/share maybe.

Again it‚Äôs highly variable based on the court case but remember Mnunchin wants to privatize these entities.

I'm okay with losing the shares though. Earning the premium would be nice in addition to the increase in value of the shares.

Tell me why doesn‚Äôt the manager pay the waiters a normal wage instead of forcing the customer to make a decision.

I‚Äôm not going to the restaurant to pay a waiter, I go to get some food. If that place has good food I would like to try it. Unfortunately if it has waiters I am responsible to pay them a percentage of the total bill and to judge if the service was good?

Trust me the waiter would be better off with the manager paying them a wage then allowing me to make that decision.
I see you are a man of culture.
Wow. We must have been reading the same stock strategy book.
It sounds like the best is option is to sell puts and buy equity.

Have you seen their order rates through their e-commerce biz? US online is averaging 75-95k orders A DAY. This accounts for less than 20% of their total sales.

Lots of people buy from GME don't be stupid. Stores have been packed lately.

This is why I NEVER take women seriously when they claim to have an "abusive" bf or ex bf.   Because 99% of the time, it's BS.

If you try in some brokerages, Fidelity for example, they will not allow too high sale prices. Not every brokerage will allow this.
Otc shit, fuck that.

Also I think more than the lawsuit, the speculation is they may return it to private ownership on their way out of office.  Which would be good for shareholders, bad for the mortgage industry.

Also, $190B of that $300 was paying back the bailout... Another $110B probably covers interest at the least.

No, that wouldn‚Äôt protect them from spikes in volatility or massive moves in the stock...the MM delta hedge which basically means if a call has a delta of 0.51 they are forced to buy 51 shares of stock. They are constantly rebalancing their positions based on the changing deltas

My grandpa didn't give a fuck about getting banned, you know what he did?!?!

Killed fucking nazis!
I‚Äôm not familiar with their density in SF specifically, but as you know (I‚Äôve seen some good GME posts come your way) the store de-densification is accretive to earnings since they‚Äôre achieving sales transfer rates >40%. These fucks see headlines like GME closing stores and assume it‚Äôs a bad thing without understanding the GameStop Reboot strategy.
You guys all max your 401k and Roth IRAs before buying PLTR weeklies, right?
Got it at $10 was really expecting a dip ( because they haven't shown shit) so I sold on Wednesday....then Friday happened.

Fuck my life
Yeah I don‚Äôt have the balls to do options, shares at least have value options can become completely worthless within a week.
is dec 21 the day it gets in SPY?
Oh y‚Äôknow cmon
News flash: the majority doesn't give a shit about your snowflake causes and any corporation will censor you when you threaten profits.  Market wins, bitch.
Yoloing on 0DTEs was what killed you bud, if you had so much capital just play monthlies and LEAPs
Just ditch the bitch and put cash on pltr. Stay pumpin and pimpin.
20p 12/4 printing? Yessirrrr
you don't seem to understand how the market hates uncertainty. that's what causes drops. not "oh we know this is going to happen now" plenty of stocks have sat around because of uncertainty. look at Disney. they sat at $90-$100 for 4 years because nobody knew what would happen with ESPN and the onslaught of streaming services.
Where can I watch then fight at for free?
Good thing they aren't wrestling
This is my everything
Well, i see the point. Cause they dont want risk. So they own shares and sell calls at a price thst if assigned, they make a good profit on. Selling a naked call has unlimited risk, if i remember correctly? had a 550 and 555. Sold like a bitch for a small profit. Knew i should have held until this coming monday. Gotta do my shit with more conviction and let it play out
Throw her**
This would kill me

yeah and make them short DTE, 12/4, risk the gamma, the theta and IV crush is worth it. Hold the IV till EOD Tuesday it‚Äôll cut in half

i would do the same play but capital tied in PLTR CALLS TO THE MOON
SPCE 1000% I thought it was cool
CRSR will drop to 35 and lower me thinks. That run while great TENDIES was just not healthy. Once it hit 50, I bounced tf out.

So if I own GME shares in RH and its fully cash secured and margin is off, I can assume my shares are not being lent out?
N1gga I ain‚Äôt worried about nuthin
I love you. Can I suck your cock?
I'm gonna level with you, this was a roundabout way at to generate discussion around all the GME posts as many people will want to FOMO into it, and I believed the time to buy in was months ago. The deal is not a sure thing.
Not much but NIO 300% bc it was a flashy ev stock
Yea thanks I'll probably try it with some really wide strangles just overnight and hope to collect like 3k overnight for a few short wide strangles. I've never done it before but might try for one that has the highest earnings IV of all (I know it'll realize a lot too but I'm hoping for less than the IV), and we'll see. I'm mostly a buy calls type of guy who belongs in wsb but trying to expand, especially since I think without Trump going forward, there's more selling options opportunities.

Dude prenups will not save you, millions ways to cancel prenup during divorce ie: she says "i felt pressured" that is enough for family court ; 

another example: she finds something valuable that you didn't list during divorce, like a rare comic book or a expensive tool in your garage. She will say you are hiding assets, that's is enough for prenup cancelation.

Did anyone chime in with the laws of thermodynamics? A BTU is a BTU. The answer is whatever the cheapest BTU available is.
Calling someone an idiot for thinking this can go "under" is equally moronic. They're not fucking apple or Google. The idea of them going under is as feasible as it is for any company this size.
For sure
Oh I know I stepped into a degenerate cesspool here. Appreciate the feedback, I‚Äôm buying some LEAP bullish risk reversals Monday

Same, I blew my wad on paying off the house.  I wasn't willing to risk losing everything in a second leg down when I was so close to paying the house.  Trying to figure out the play now, have around 45k to play with.  The fear and greed index is almost maxed on greed so I'm worried there will be a correction around the corner.  Don't want to get clapped when I first jump in.
Cohen makes it an absolute no brainer to go long. I don‚Äôt think it necessarily breaks this. He‚Äôs still a 10% investor. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll leave till a squeeze happens. Or he just continues to buy shares and it happens.

I took a bunch of time to consolidate all my Robinhood statements yesterday and found that I made about 500 buys and 500 sells from Feb-Sept. 66% stocks and 33% options. Almost every position I had was right and now ITM, just traded too often and didn‚Äôt buy far enough out.

Fully aware. It's a constant battle against myself and sometimes I know I'm bumping up against addiction before I take a break and then repeat the cycle. It's really hurting my profitability. I lost my job in March and still might be shit out of luck for a bit yet.. too much time to watch things. Gotta find something productive to do during trading hours.

Guess a room mate just needs to say you ate meals together and fucked. Classic he said he said. Or he said she said, I don't judge.
you are right.  i misspoke.  they aren‚Äôt technically on time out till 2023 but that is when PGE believes they will be able to report 6.2B in earnings. it‚Äôs just an estimation but according to articles it‚Äôs PGEs estimation.  sorry don‚Äôt have the link but you can google it. i‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs sooner than that obviously.  i have 20k shares in my personal equity account.

Yep, just got one yesterday. If bars were open, I could definitely have my pick right now.
Welcome to my hell
Yes but that's precisely why I was interested. It's so wild the 20% OTM 1 week calls are going for over 1k each just because of earnings. Hence why I'm really interested. ZM can go up like 15% and I'll still be safe. 

If it works it's about 47.5k margin for 2 options (broker offers 50% maintance margin for ZM). And I only have to tie it up overnight 1 night since mostly everything will be decided for the earnings date. I know all the risks but I wanted just to learn more, and it's hard to find a place that will teach me since the one sub I thought could seems to be just against any selling of naked calls haha.
Shit so tempting. But so many uncertainties.
They‚Äôll go up until Mitch McConnell says it won‚Äôt get a vote on the senate floor. Then they‚Äôll come back down.
Yeah I mean short term yolo gains are certainly their own beast. I just hope no one plans to baghold this black hole of a stock after it's all over.

Dude trying to look at the fucking option chain on the Fidelity mobile app is cancer.  If I'm not on active trader pro I can't do shit.
I would recommend giving to one of givewell.org's recommended charities. For approx $3500 you can statistically save a life in Africa buy buying malaria bednets, or vitamin A supplements. Or you can deworm 3500 kids from parasitic worms. There are other causes you can explore too. Givewell goes beyond charitynavigator.org's service of just evaluating the finances of a charity and how much overhead they have (although Charity Navigator is working to catch up by making an impact score). Givewell evaluates how inherently efficient a cause is at helping. It doesn't matter how financially efficient a charity is if their mission is to give donuts to cops, as a contrived example. All of this goes along with the philosophy of effective altruism: doing good most efficiently. If you are interested in maximizing your impact, look into "Effective Altruism". There is an EA group on Facebook. You can also check out Will Macaskill. He has been on Joe Rogan's Podcast, along with Sam Harris's podcast, Tim Ferris's podcast, Lex Fridman's (one of my favorite human beings) podcast and many others. I would recommend listening to him on Tim Ferris's podcast for a good introduction. I don't know as much about openphilanthropy.org, but I know they are a name that gets brought up a bit in the Effective Altruism community. They have some overlap with Givewell in that they try to identify effective ways to donate money, and then they donate lots of money themselves (they are funded by a co founder of Facebook and Asana). Also check out givingmulitplier.org, they will match a percent of your donation. I have no affiliation with any of these groups or people other than that I would like to help others and donate some of my time and money.

If you are talking about COTY then what you talkin about?
Yeah no problem, but honesntly if there's one thing I wish  knew when I was a beginner, is how much the deltas matter. I strongly consider watching YT videos/ reading more about options, because you can easily lose money by not knowing what you are doing or paying attention to the deltas
That was my face following the memes back into PLTR at all time highs

Just $70 is more than I‚Äôve ever spent on memes in my whole life when I think about it

Gamestop is a meme that can take my money if it needs to.

My portfolio is so wrapped up in the virus crippling the US I never know what‚Äôs being bullish. If the Dow has a kick ass day I‚Äôm usually down. If the NASDAQ is having a kick ass day I‚Äôm usually up.
I wouldn‚Äôt bet on it. I would be surprised if it does. Last weeks selling just seems like profit taking and people refusing to buy at those high prices. Probably some panic selling from people who bought in the 50s also. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt chase after it‚Äôs run up so much. You don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs gonna be hit with red
You‚Äôre right, excuse me. *clears throat*

Hope for the best and hope you‚Äôre able to move on.

After a loss, it‚Äôs HUMAN NATURE to increase the risk because you start framing it as ‚Äúwell I can make it back it this idea hits‚Äù. But it won‚Äôt and then the loss becomes greater, and humans are wired to come up with something even more risky to try to break even. From shares, to options, to 0DTE options. Be careful out there Mates

Great advice. I enjoy seeing this kind of post. I don't talk to my family about my earnings in the market but I share the earnings with them by taking them on impromptu weekend trips etc that they would never take and I just tell them not to worry about paying me back. I also have a high income job, so they attribute it to that.

Citron originally was a joke in the 70's for little companies the big guys could "shit on" and take out of competition.  Using cash to essentially buy another businesses bankruptcy became successful enough they turned the shit on joke to citron and continue to this day to buy negative ads, false marketing, etc to short and shit on good businesses.
Can you show me something official on the 3 year time out because thats what was originally reported but in the final agreement it was changed to just 6 billion in earnings.


This document mentions nothing about 3 years, just the earnings.

Good post - for IBKR you can opt out of your shares being loaned out. They will also pay you a portion of the short rebate if you allow them to loan out the shares (so it is normally in your best interest to loan them out)

On Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs purchasing-managers index of manufacturing activity will be released, followed by the services index on Thursday‚Äîthey‚Äôre both expected to dip‚Äîand then November‚Äôs payrolls report this coming Friday. Payrolls are supposed to increase by just 590,000, down from 906,000 in October, and murmurs of a big miss have been circulating, as have concerns of a negative number in December.‚Äù

Watch we still be green af if these numbers miss.

Me too.  Bought shares
hey im bullish but not this week. maybe in 2-3 weeks. if the put call ratio / fear greed index wasn't so fucked up and begging MM's for a (minor) correction, we'd be there faster. but likely they'll shake a lot of people out first
Well the general theme I got is literally I shouldn't be selling any naked call...but that's a big part of theta strategies. Spreads would reduce the theta by 80%, and I'm not interested in that lol. I mean I already sell naked puts (and buy calls), wanted some opinions on selling naked calls and a lot of people just mention "stocks can go to infinity so never sell naked calls".
Not saying I don‚Äôt believe you, but where did you get those dates?

Fomo pressure got me sweatin
i dont have a roth ira so im clueless on that, just know i would be way more ahead right now if it wasn't for all the taxes ive paid in the past. i hear td ameritrade has roth ira option. not sure about daytrading in roth. but im not a strong proponent of day trading to begin with; i feel trading in the time frame of one week minimum to months gets better success probabilities
Im not in that gang. But zm is wild and before earnings it would be super high risk. So maybe they just have less risk tolerance. And you would tie up like 475k to sell those calls. Right
Edit 47.5k
Your composure is actually astounding. I'm proud of you my boy. I know in that situation it woulda took alot to not start putting heads through walls. That being said around here renting a dude would be grounds to have the contract annulled

Great choice. I was in the same situation and blinded with hope. Some people never change.  My wife did that during school. Paid tuition and never showed up for class. Then got her masters extended to 5 years paying tuition each year.  After she finally got a job, it was too stressful and worked only a year before mental health breaks.

Allow me to elaborate, since you don't seem to appreciate the delicacy that is the fig.

I love figs, but in particular there is this one man's figs that I crave above all others. I used to live in the southeast U.S. where fig trees are abundant and produce well, with quality fruit. Every other person in my area had a fig tree in their backyard and when they came into season in the summer we'd all sample each others figs, make fig jams, swap buckets of figs, etc...

A couple years ago I visited near where I now live. It was a family vacation and we took the people who don't come up here often on a jet boat trip down the Snek River. As a break the tour stopped at a historical site where some settlers had homesteaded back in the day, farmed, fucked their cows, etc... What people do when they live down at the bottom of an 8000ft ravine with a raging river on one side of them and an unscalable precipice on the other.

There was a caretaker for this particular historical site, and he oversaw an orchard of a decent size. Keep in mind this is not the climate, latitude or terrain you would ever expect to see an orchard in. Most of it was scraggly, hoary crabapples and a few wild plums, the sort of stuff you'd expect to see an old gray man such as himself tending to and fawning over.

However, there was a particularly prize specimen that stood out from all the rest right in the middle, with a stream sprouting from beneath it's majestic trunk. A Fig tree three times the size of anything I had seen in the south, hanging heavy with fruit and bursting with sap. I checked with the grandfatherly figure and he said it was fair game, to gorge on the bounty as much as I wished.

Paying no heed to the children running about betwixt the twisted trunks of rows of crabapples I snatched up a fig the size of my fist and stuffed it in my mouth and it was absolutely divine. The fine hair on the skin of it didn't distract from the juicy meat, it was sweeter than anything I had sampled in the south and just melted in the mouth.

Not wishing to seem greedy I satisfied myself with just the one, wiped the dribble from my chin and positively skipped back to the boat where I shared the story with my family. Being from the south themselves they were astounded to hear of such a prized specimen in such a location and went to partake of it themselves.

None of that is innuendo you sick fuck, and it's a true story.

I watch support levels on daily charts. Which again is elementary when it comes to trading so I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a genius. But I watch for blue chips to approach daily support areas and I can get in heavy on those and bounces off support with a really tight stop loss that‚Äôs not likely to be hit. Then I swing for a few days and take profits periodically. I‚Äôm also trying day trading and options but only with $1k because I‚Äôm still figuring this out. 

But golden rules I‚Äôve found so far:

#1 Always make sure you‚Äôre getting a good deal

#2 Always take profits periodically. If you don‚Äôt have a profit price target wtf are you doing. 

#3 hold winners after taking profits. I‚Äôve made my best gains off holding stocks that continue to rally for a few more days. And I don‚Äôt mind the little dips because I‚Äôve already taken profit and I can move my stop loss to break even and ride it out risk free
Fuck. Why does this weekend have to be so long. It feels like the market has been closed for a week.

I'm so confused. I thought r/thetagang was about selling options (that's what their banner even says). I ask about selling a ZM call like 20% OTM and they are like "no you will go ROPE...", "this isn't a theta strategy", etc. so what options are they exactly selling there? I'm honestly confused lol.
For me something around the 70-100% range.

Yes Cohen makes or breaks this, and I can't recall where now but id read before that the board of GME are dinosaurs and set in their ways, so while changing up the business makes sense it's not a sure thing. I also think that we've probably peaked and there's only risky FOMO gains left to get (this week).

If their plan to reshape their business goes ahead I will dump a whole paycheck in GME.

Whoops. No BRAINER
i have no roth and really regret it because i didn't know enough about trading back then, so i can't answer you that well since it's only based on what ive read. i dont think there are trade/transaction limits for roth, not that im aware of, just that you can only contribute $6,000 a year to it, and you can't make too much money annually to contribute to a roth. you put in money you already paid taxes on, but while you are trading in the roth ira there is no taxing; if you want until you are like 60 and retired to take it out all the gains are not taxed at all. but if you take it out early before that then it's taxed like it is normal income plus a 10% penalty. but that 10% penalty may even be worth it to not have to pay tax every year and slow down your growth. so it's best to have a roth ira to do short term trading, you can do options and normal trades, but no margin. and have another separate account for long term trades that get taxed favorably. basically day trade and swing trade the crap out of your roth using shares or options, also call debit spreads that gets taxed heavily if not a roth.

I would do something like buy the January 40 call and sell the December 45 call.  You‚Äôll limit your upside by your breakeven is around $35.

Or just sell a 30 day out put vertical.

IV is really high so it‚Äôs risky to straight by a call now. If it goes into consolidation IV will drop and kill your premium also there decay will hurt
Well, it clearly worked out for him. No guarantee that it would‚Äôve worked out the same way if he just sent an application, could‚Äôve got lost in the thousands of applications those companies receive. Especially for Google, at least (whereas Amazon is less picky about selecting interviewees).
Same.  Been here since 2017 and it's so cyclical. I don't come in here when it's euphoria, like the Palantir spam. The daily spam always goes away after a week where the market drops 7%.
Following as I‚Äôm thinking the same thing. Taking some calls for positions in 2022/2023 seems like a no browner? But if it was, everyone and their wives boyfriends would be doing it right?

Edit: no-brainer not no-browner

$40k ready to go, mix of shares/calls
All the best üåàüêª
Thanks but that makes it worse.

Look again at the volume. You have an up green day on large volume heading into earnings hoping for good news.

Then, a miss and gap down. The shorts hang around a few days to see if it goes lower. Maybe 4 days later they see it level and close their positions at a profit. The 2nd recent ‚Äúup‚Äù bar is probably a short covering rally. 

When shorts buy to cover, that pushes the stock price up some.

Then, the next day, either people put on new short positions and/or people used the small price recovery to exit at close to break even on the most recent bar at high volume.

I would say it at least tests the island bottom again soon.

It‚Äôs going to sound really stupid but I just watch volume and price. Because that‚Äôs all that really matters from what I can tell. I get in heavy on what I think is a good move and just set a really tight stop loss. And in a few days I can make like 5%-10% and if I‚Äôm wrong I stop out soon and it doesn‚Äôt matter. I want to say again I‚Äôm not saying I have this figured out. But I‚Äôm learning that the biggest fundamentals are making sure you‚Äôre getting a good deal, and take money off the table in pieces. Don‚Äôt be afraid to hold on your winners, but take profits periodically.
This is amazing
No shit, its obvious we were involved as well. But Iran is making the strategic choice to only blame Israel, likely because it puts the US in at a strategic disadvantage if anything comes of this.
I only lost money on short dated calls due to bad timing. There is no way to mitigate losses. Itm money calls have intrinsic value and will follow stock price more closely than otm calls. The market we are in has so much uncertainity. Black swan could happen any day thats why im playing csp. I at least get the shares.

Sorry, what‚Äôs there not to like about PLTR fundamentals? 

Their revenues have gone up 52% in a year. They expect 31% revenue growth in Q4 2020. They have tech and software contracts with major governments (Canada, USA, England, Columbia), various world bodies and agencies, will be handling the Covid vaccine data and distribution tracking, works with countless Fortune 500 companies handling their entire value chain from procurement to distribution, top pharma uses their tech for trials, us armed forces, police, ICE, NORAD, public and private healthcare systems, it goes on and on. 

Buying more Monday morning. Citron is wrong every time they open their mouths. Used to be called ‚ÄúStockLemon‚Äù. His ex wife is pretty hot. Hopefully she‚Äôs holding PLTR too.

Can confirm. Am bull. Get a low fade.
13? Not sure trolling or being serious.
Nvm I see how screechy it is. Still agree with their philosophy tho
Everyone knows its a bubble, but I think people are underestimating how much longer it will last. The .com bubble lasted in a state of utter mania like this FOR YEARS.

To me, it feels like the bubble has just began. I think we have time to make life changing gains in 2021.
nio houses were horrible in 2018 and 2019, they were such huge loss leaders to get people interested, the nio spaces make more sense economically, and they can strategically build more nio houses but it needs to built where there are a lot of nio owners; it's like opening a bunch of members only starbucks shops, if not enough people go you're losing a ton of money, but once enough exclusive members go at least it will cover the bill to run that store. people spend money at nio houses, drinks and merch, etc. the biggest moat is the battery swap though, being able to buy an EV now and not worry about being stuck with a crappy 80kWh battery down the line, can already pay to upgrade to 100kWh right now, and in a year upgrade to 150kWh, forget being able to ugprade; Tesla and Xpeng won't even give you the option of a sedan with 150kWh because majority of buyers won't want to pay that much for a car so it doesn't make sense for them to deal with that option on their production line, but nio it's just a swap away... imagine offloading your second hand car where the new owner can just pay an upgrade fee to a brand new fresh battery at higher capacity, the resale value is going to be so much better.
I think NewEgg is a better comparison

Yes. Do the math on how much alcohol your yeast can ferment vs what your brew is calculating near the end. 
I think I used regular wine yeast and just let it ferment for like 6 weeks, transferred it sterile a couple times to clear it up. At the end of 6 weeks damn near all the fermentation capabilities of the yeast were used up, so I bottled it then and none popped.

My man! Please post here when you buy.
Everyone should just place GTC market orders or limit orders above the current Ask.
I day trade and only deal with short term trading. A play for me would be to ride the squeeze and hopefully get out a little early, before everyone starts mass selling and it'll be hard to get out where I want. Then I would stay informed on Gamestop, follow earnings and see if they have any major changes to compete in an increasingly digital gaming environment. If I see good news, I'll test the waters and hold for a couple of days (starting at a good dip) and see where it goes following that news.

I was in for a taste at 10.16 for these same reasons. Should have gone heavier. Just a sneaky grand or so.

Thank you for asking this, in this document it says in 2018 & 2019 they made 2 billion each year in non-GAAP earnings which means its really really really fucking close because it would be pretty safe to assume they made 2 billion this year. It might even happen at their 4th quarter filings

3 years of learning = TSLA just goes up?
True. Depends on what you want out of your "investment" at the end of the day a company is worth what people will pay for it. Which for some boils down to the NPV of future cashflows PE is handy for that for others this does not apply.  I'm holding calls in TSLA and pltr just like everyone else.

If it's that simple and ever worked, then it became priced in and lost it's alpha as tards copied it into oblivion.
I'm holding 1k at 13.51.  I rode 2k shares from the high 9s to the 12s then dipped out for a bit before i got back in.   I'm half GME, half CNK right now.   If I feel like the squeeze is happening i might sell my CNK and average up on my GME for a day or so.

It's probably already priced into MSFT and SNE. Also, GME can be pumped easier since its market cap is 1552x smaller than MSFT and 113x smaller than SNE.
This is a really good guide written by another degenerate like us so it makes it very easy to understand

People sleeping on this, 2.4B valuation is peanuts at the moment for a company with such a great team and a pretty promising product (esp for ride share market). Sure, any other time it would be a retardedly high valuation, but we‚Äôre in EV-hype-land where NKLA is worth 10B so that needs to be taken into account. Hoping for some big catalysts (b2b announcement, maybe a partnership deal or 2) in December.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree with all of your analysis and I am also in on calls, but this is not a mover or indicator of success.

People don‚Äôt add hops to beer because cannabis is illegal, hops are added because of its specific aroma. Adding cannabis to beer, other than to add THC content, is throwing away money and anyone that does this is dumb.

I have also ‚Äúfresh hopped‚Äù high ABV ales with freshly cut cannabis colas, and while it is interesting, tasty, and gets you fucked up - anyone doing this on a commercial scale is losing SOOOOO much money on the cost of growing weed, just to dunk it into a vat of fuckin stinky beer.

Are u guys using pltr ?
An app where in order to post in the anonymous forums/discussions (for different careers and industries), you need to sign up with a work email and they label you as where you work. You then engage in discussion about all sorts of things, like workplace environment, salary and compensation (usually this is all people talk about), and compare jobs/companies.


It‚Äôs great because of the email requirement, so annoying students can only view and cannot post (otherwise they‚Äôd constantly beg for referrals and whatnot). 


I‚Äôve learned so much about how absurd the salaries are in SWE/DS, and it‚Äôs honestly the most useful app I‚Äôve ever downloaded as a student (I can‚Äôt post, only read but that‚Äôs fine). 


It‚Äôs very common for people to make a post like ‚ÄúHey can I get a referral for Google‚Äù and depending on where the guy works (if it‚Äôs reputable) and what skills they say they have, people will flood the comments like ‚ÄúYup we have an opening at [insert team], DM me‚Äù

But I‚Äôll ride this one. It‚Äôll be in 100s this time next year.

Yea I'm very bullish on GME. I currently have 100 shares but keep seeing all these retards making all this money with options so I'm deciding to give it a try.

So price is 2.45 for 1 contract $20 call on Jan. 15. Which means I'm risking 245 (I lose this if it's not above 20 on Jan 15h correct?)

 Let's say it hits $22 on Jan 15.. I could sell my 1 contract (100shares)  at $22?

Well you have at least 3 big guys that the hospitals, retail chain, and retail independent use.  Cardinal health who I use and I have been getting 3x weekly update from our center contact about them providing them when available.  There is also McKesson as you stated and AmerisourceBergen.  Apparently the immunizations will be rolled out in phases. AFAIK retail will be last to get them. 

Most are trying to source the refrigerated ones as the certified freezers are about $15k a pop and a lot of pharmacies got rid of theirs when the shingles vaccine Shingrix came out.  Higher efficacy, lower side effects because it isn‚Äôt live like Zostavax and doesn‚Äôt need to be kept frozen until reconstituted and administered.  Distributors should only be making distribution and holding fees on the shots. Pharmacies will only make administration fees if a patient has insurance.  Those fees are only to recover costs of administration such as time and ppe

Buy gme shares. This is literally once in a lifetime money. Don‚Äôt lose it on weeklies. Shares are the way! üòéüòéüòé
Management openly stated investors should expect a poor Q3 months ago. They have been priced in. There is no need to speculate on poor performance, only on the chance they did better than expected.

Ryan Cohen will make bearish statements about GME all day long. He wants to take it over and the cheaper the better.

GME is simply undervalued. Slowly rerating from being priced for bankruptcy. It doesn't need to run on any other reason than the fact that it is undervalued. You can call it meme strength but it really is just finding its way back to fair value.

I'm super bullish on GME and Cohen making a move sometime in December is likely in my eyes. PR blitz and letter in tandem with poor Q3 report makes mid December a prime opportunity for him to strike before GME gets too high priced by Q4 earnings being a colossal beat.

Long 6k shares @ $7.16
If I had to guess. This week leading up will run so I‚Äôd get in Monday and depending on price maybe out Friday on gains and reposition. Because yes I do believe earnings is going to disappoint but the actual numbers for this quarter don‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs whatever the board has to say. If they say they have been buying back shares or have a great guidance or say anything about working towards and alliance with Ryan. All of those skyrocket this and probably force the squeeze. If they don‚Äôt it will be the bears last chance to drive down price ( and Ryan‚Äôs if he‚Äôs thinking tender offer or hostile takeover) and I can see a decent pullback. The stock is shorted over 100%. It‚Äôs not worth the risk to not be in and miss the opportunity. If I had no position. I‚Äôd get in a variety of calls this week the safest ones being April or June. Others being more risky. Around earnings. But then Being ready to average down or get in once the bottom is in after earnings if that path happens. It would be the last bad news for months.

wouldnt be surprised if it took a while tbh.
Agree. I work for a fortune 500 company. We used webex pre covid, then they changed to zoom during covid b/c cisco blows and we were getting security breaches on webex. We also migrated to teams shortly after zoom rolled out. Only a matter of time before IT folks get teams fully integrated and our company sits back and says "hey, why do we have two video conference platforms? Get rid of one!" Zoom will certainly lose given teams covers so much of everything else we do with it.

Oh there will be, and then a just as swift dump shortly thereafter in the crap ones (the good ones like APHA and GRWG will be fine). So load up while the loading is good but set a stop loss because this is a vaccine pump situation that will die off quickly because ultimately it‚Äôs going nowhere for now.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying lol
Honestly Jan/Feb is perfect. It will at the very least get the Libervant approval. 

I personally have 2400 shares at $4.75 average and ten 12/2020 7.5c contracts. I really should move it out further though. I probably will next week.

Hey man. I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about this. I hope your story can serve as a lesson for others here.

At the end of the day, there is little value in money itself. There is only value in it because we have decided there is. Chasing it will never bring meaning to your life.

This is a good first step to take off the hedonistic treadmill the rest of us are always on and may spend the rest of our lives never getting off. Win or lose, this lifestyle cannot possibly fulfill you.

Remember to take care and be kind to yourself going forward. 

Also: you have a good wife.

Look at the volume along the bottom and reference the candlesticks above. About a week ago, you have an up day on 3-4x normal volume. Great sign.

Then you have a gap down, but not a lot of volume. Not ideal, but ok.

Then 3 or 4 days later, it moved higher again on large volume. This is potentially a very bullish island bottom.

Then as soon as it filled the upper gap above the island, everyone said ‚Äúthank God, I‚Äôm back to even and I‚Äôm outta here.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how I see it.

Look at the daily patterns on GME, it can swing within a 5%-10% range in the same day with how volatile it is. Avoid buying on the intraday spikes obviously, that happens like almost everyday on GME

Ok so forget the money situation. This is definitely something that is going to result in her saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kill myself without you‚Äù or some other variation of that statement. She‚Äôll more than likely try to guilt you into staying with her. Make sure she has access to absolutely none of your money/bank accounts. Or just make a new one. Kick her off any of your credit cards and don‚Äôt tell her about the gains. Even if you‚Äôre lying about the whole situation, leave her anyway before you end up stuck in a relationship you hate. And go spend a couple of your new dollars on hookers and cocaine.

TAN making me so much more than ICLN.
My entire point is that you're trying to protect someone from selling naked options. Stop, it's not necessary. The SEC has procedures in place to stop people without experience from being approved for level 4 options trading which it required to be able to even do that. Get off your high horse. GTFOOH.
Degrees are only worthless if you're bad at convincing people they're worth something. Start off in a tangential field and just throw your degree up in your interview as an inconsequential thing, then flex it's usefulness in unexpected ways as you work.

Watch yourself get promoted ahead of the people with relevant degrees because you "showed initiative" and "brought valuable insight where others didn't".

Plot twist: OP's gf is the rental.  That's how she is making extra money.
It all depends on what you‚Äôre trying to look at and how. Most technical analysis is trash because people have no idea what they‚Äôre doing. TA can tell you support/resistance levels, when something is overbought/oversold, etc. It‚Äôs a useful tool, but you need to know how to implement it. It‚Äôs never going to tell you exactly when or at what price something is gonna be. But if you‚Äôre daytrading, figuring out how to read intraday RSI, and support/resistance, and key patterns (ESPECIALLY bull flags) can be extremely lucrative. Just never go full retard.

Honestly fuck the casino. I probably have a problem but at least with stocks I have some kind of control. Lost a bunch of money today and all I'm thinking is that it could have been an option play.

You're like the king of getting in too late.
1. Buying cheaply enough to cover their shorts
2. No 3. No
4. No 5. No. Prithee, do tell.
I'm just saying that perhaps the play is to sell some of gains and lock them in.

Then if it falls after earnings, roll your gains back in.

I highly doubt Cohen would let them just give bad earnings and thats it, especially after that angry letter... either they give good guidance about ecommerce and transforming the company and shit, or Cohen will be pissed and very likely step in in some way, both would make shorts panic imo

ENPH, but it's hilarious overvalued right now and needs to drop a bit.

CSIQ is the biggest value, been holding a while and I think it finally broke out just now. My PT is $50 soon
shit--if it pops up 50 bucks on monday that means i missed out on something like 4 grand. LOL!
You bought it OTM I‚Äôm assuming so it was all time value at that point. The further ITM you go, more and more of the value will be intrinsic until it basically moves lockstep with the underlying. Theta doesn‚Äôt mean shit for the intrinsic value so you may as well hold. I‚Äôve got some 2023 20C‚Äôs and I‚Äôm planning to let them ride for quite some time as well.

Nothing is safe.

Investors are not going to wait for things to get delisted.

You can expect a mass exodus with the first sign that a company is not cooperating. If the first audit doesn't happen - people are out.

He's referring to the current auditors in China, who tow the line.  China is not evil - they just have a different way of doing business.  It's called [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanxi).  The auditors will report whatever their told, for guanxi.  This is the whole reason why the US is passing this bill.  They don't trust those auditors - so they require that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) perform the audits.

I lost all hopes when it went at 7k but got lucky finally
Nothing, we said the call was going to be ass two months ago. The big boys accumulating millions of shares know this as well. I know WSB is all short term plays but balking due to earnings is short sighted. Any drop afterwards may be the last shot at entry but there will be no ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù

Gamestop is still in the middle of a complete overhaul to their business model. The gamestop in my town just finished remodeling this year. This shit takes a while, it won‚Äôt happen overnight. 

As of this moment, gamestop doesn‚Äôt offer much, you‚Äôre right. 

6 months from now? I have no idea what they‚Äôre gonna offer. A year? same thing, no idea. 

I think the hype surrounding gamestop is more about what the business will look like down the line, with major changes to the business model. It‚Äôs clear that gamestop‚Äôs current business model is shit, but Chewy‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt. 

To me the hype is about the fact that someone who knows their shit is trying to turn this company into something competitive. Whether or not that will actually be accomplished, your guess is as good as mine.

Do you know the 'short selllers' personally? Do you know what they're in for?

You do realize there are tons of reasons why you short a stock right? Did you realize there are long plays where you also short a stock as a part of your trade?

Your loss sucks, it really does. Many of know we are gambling addicts and degenerates and will probably lose thousands as well. That is the risk we take. I would press F for respects, but fuck Ford.

Thing is around these parts, when people have loss porn to post, they feel the shame and duck out. But those that want to thump chest with gains, encourage others to lemming. Which continues the cycle. 

So other readers/retards - post your loss porn when you have it. To show the two sides of our gambling addiction. The possible gains and the possible losses.

I went to visit my 98 year old dad in the nursing home today. He's got advanced dementia and can't really get out of bed. He was trying to call a Drexel broker on his slipper. I told him "Dad, they don't even exist anymore." He said "shut up üåàüêª". I asked him what he was trying to buy and he said "PLTR 50c 12-4 and I ain't got time to wait". I said, "dad the chain doesn't even have a 50 yet". He said "it will when I get through with it."

I told him that even an extreme bull case doesn't make it likely this is going to 50 in 4 trading days. So he reached under the bed and hurled a full bedpan at me and screamed "THE MAN IS GOING TO EAT HIS OWN SHIT IF IT GETS TO 50"

So yeah, the word is out at this point.

No, but it will pass congress and initiate good movement on weed stocks. After that it still needs to pass a senate vote which is more unlikely. However, with Georgia potentially turning blue there is a small chance. There is also arguments that the senate may adapt a weed legalization bill even if still controlled by the republicans as it gives them an opportunity to manipulate the bill in their favor. Mitch McConnell will likely not be around to see another weed legalization bill, so this is his last opportunity to at least control the direction of U.S. legalization

I closed one position friday for smol dick gains and opened like three more so... ya same I agree
Really the only ones you'll be able to afford are gonna be weeklies that could easily expire worthless if GME pulls back this week. If you wanna be smart, just get 2 shares.

If you wanna put your plums on the table (and lose money unless it squeezes this week) get 2x $28c 12/4
So when it IPOs you don't think the banks and big players aren't gonna inflate the price before it's available to us? Or is wsb the only ones that knows about Rblx?

Bro, I read your post and thought you were seriously joking. I am glad you are here because you belong with us, retard.

We all trying to give you solid advice and worry for you man. All love bro! Only want the best for you and your PLTR gains.
Just fucking leave her, and take your damn tendies as a reward.

Considering that it's up to $16 now, I can disagree.

In all honesty, probably not. He's definitely watching this sub, he knew we were gonna fomo HARD on the dip Friday with limited hours.

I'm guessing he already bought in and is waiting for Monday to watch PLTR explode from us using our weaponized autism.

You think it's any coincidence that NIO is still hovering at $54? That the general sentiment around PLTR is "buy on Monday before it takes off again"?

I MEAN FFS JUST LOOK AT NVDA!!!

Left knows what he's doing, he and his following have enough money to manipulate a stock. He chooses when he wants it down.

That being said he's the biggest fucking cigarette on the planet and people like him are why I won't buy into options with less than 6 months expiry

Buy stock. It's cheap, and the squeeze is more likely to happen if we all buy up stock. Particularly non marginable stock. And then you hold it. 

Squeeze will happen soon either because we retards launch it or the Dec 8 earnings call is good. If neither of those happen, squeeze is still on but needs a catalyst, so it may be next quarter when the console earnings are included. 

Buy and hold stock. 

If you absolutely must buy a call, I'd say mid next year expiry. You're on your own for strike price.

Could be fun, but broke people like to drink away the losses
Bruh they locked down on this one Fr lol
Yes. Except more than 100% of outstanding shares are being shorted and about 3x the float are being shorted, so this causes a huge short squeeze because not everyone will be able to buy in, thus the price gets driven up due to demand outweighing supply.
I think you mean joe rogan
Well shit Shkreli got away with it
The retard strength behind PLTR is much greater than it was/is with NIO. That is why it will succeed. That, and having a figure like Thiel and incredible tech.
Damn, send me some money if you're a millionaire.
xpeng needs to be at like $105 or something to have same valuation as nio, so it definitely has room to grow, but you're a young male aren't you? the kind xpeng's cars are made for. which is why they have low sales. nio and li have much better sales because their cars aren't gender specific and are mainly targeting families. nio's cars are popular with female drivers.

There was a [petition](https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2020/petn4-758.pdf) earlier this year made to the SEC to enact a policy for short sellers and negative activists to disclose when they have closed their positions. So if the SEC does enact this policy, someone like Andrew Left who announced a short position on PLTR with a $20 2020 target would easily be found out to be illegally conducting short and distorts for quick profit taking when he is now liable to disclose his closed position (most likely to be same day, instead of going bankrupt waiting for the never-coming $20 price target). Same could be said about his $25 price target with NIO. 

Right now the only thing holding Citron by a thread is the fact that a policy like this is not yet enacted which gives them the upper-hand by posting a disclaimer as a loophole to not be held liable for any losses that occur for listening to Citron.
This was funny af.

I think the more likely scenario is you see people stop chasing value and rotate out of it into tech again. Lockdowns and death potentially doubling in the short term is going to change sentiment in the very short term (I think).

I wonder what he'd say if he knew what they were and that's mostly what I trade

Take a spoon, and shove the spoon end up your pee hole. Flick it three times, run around the block 2 times, then shove the metal end into an electrical socket 1 time for exactly 420.69 seconds.

Anyone else notice that VALE gang actually ended up being right? Anyone who bought into contracts expiring this week or later has made like 10x more than anything from PLTR has thanks to the retardedly low IV that VALE had back in September.
My price target for Q4 (March 2021) was originally $20 without a squeez, keep in mind this were my thoughts when GME was still under $6. I initially didn't have any hope for eoy because Q3 only goes up to October (doesn't cover Black Friday and consoles) and after Q2, I have no hope on Sherman actually giving a guidance

but after Cohen's threatening letter, I think Sherman is incentivized to pump up GME during earnings and basically say all the good things he's done and how on track they are to a turnaround. I'm starting to feel greedy and I might not start trimming profits until $40 at this rate.

keep in mind I don't keep the short squeeze as part of my projections at all. The short squeeze is just a bonus. If it happens, fantastic. If not, I can still cash out by March 2021 with a nice profit.
No. Covid makes the feds printer go brrrrrr.

All in for NIO day

- Battery upgrades

- New Sedan Models

- Obvious impending results of NDRC investigation into EV sector detailing NIO is a 100% legitimate company

- American investors learning that TSLA and NIO are audited by the same company so they will not have problems with being delisted like some other heavily govt owned chinese EV's. *cough cough*

WE'RE üöÄüöÄüöÄ GOING üöÄüöÄüöÄ TO üöÄüöÄüöÄ THE üöÄüöÄüöÄFUCKING üöÄüöÄüöÄ üåï MOON üåï üöÄüöÄüöÄ
everyone gangsta until they get hooked to a ventilator
I mean honestly if you believe it'll keep mooning just roll it out to further expiry and slightly OTM as these are like what? .97 delta calls deep ITM shit at this point?

They're gonna move as close to 1:1 to the underlying as it gets and its not going to be very exciting. So you can just take the profit, then be "conservative" and take half (or all) and roll it to like April 21 $50c or $55c etc. Gets you more upside (and risk) and bakes an extra ER in it for IV pump as well.

This gives you more room to run and defend your position too. Say NIO gets a random 20% day and shoots back above $55 and you feel like its just a wee too much but you don't want to take gains on the April calls, you can sell weekly OTM $60c~$70 (to fellow WSBer) against the April calls to generate extra income.

I know you've been taking profit on your previous ~70 contracts already but just food for thought on the rest.

Absolutely you aren‚Äôt wrong,  but By design fracking isn‚Äôt inherently bad.   It‚Äôs bad actors,  companies not following best engineering practices.   The biggest problem not talked about by fracking opponents,it  is the millions and millions of gallons of potable Water that are used.   I‚Äôm an industry insider an that has to stop.  Once you pump potable water into a hydrocarbon bearing formation, you virtually remove it from the water cycle or water table, because it can only be disposed of in disposal wells far beneath the water table.    I‚Äôm still extremely bullish on fossil fuels.   There isn‚Äôt an argument out there that defines a clear transition off of them with current technology.

While I think this is the way.  There's the smooth part of my brain that says maybe Trump wants to take the "credit" for it so big brain biden can't.
I don't particularly disagree but it doesn't make a lick of sense. It went up like 30% on the anticipation of S&P in June. Now it's going up another 30% on the idea of actual inclusion. It was at about 900 in old money(~180 now) and now it's beyond triple that on inclusion hopes and a split in anticipation of inclusion.
maybe you can't read. this has been in the news since early in the year you fucking reject. will it happen ? probably not. but it's uncertainty. if BABA shoots up tomorrow come here and call me a fucking dumbass. otherwise fuck off and stay quiet child.
Webull is amazing, best app ever IMO, only problem is that the movement of money is slow. Takes 7 days from the time you deposit to be able to buy options. If you get a profit from day trading options, you can only use the profit the next business day. Withdrawing money takes a while. If you're not looking to access the money immediately then the app is insanely smooth, intuitive, and gives you a boatload of information including comments, financials, analyst ratings etc

The government still has to put out bids and for the most part, give the contract to the lowest bidder. Sounds like the Army wasn't going to go with them and Palantir had to sue to win the government contract.

The reason Palantir works for intel community is because of the random data they receive in different formats. Palantir helps put that information into actionable intelligence. Same with Airbus. Airbus is a conglomerate of different countries and companies producing the parts for each airplane. Again, Palantir used to analyze data from various sources to find supply chain issues.

Specialized software for organizations that have unique problems with scattered data they don't have control of. I still don't see this scaling. Having worked in consulting business, it is limited to manpower. This isn't a buy software and install. This is a write custom code per client to ingest data, install Palantir platform to analyze data. Now you need the manpower to maintain or modify the custom code per client.

I‚Äôm nervous about everything too connected to the reopen or continuing plague trade. With cases at all time highs and vaccines arriving this week it‚Äôs all too volatile. Selling calls on cruises, banks, oil, cloud. 

Probably the memes continue to go parabolic. NIO, PLTR, JMIA, and maybe SPCE. NIO has price targets at the low end up 25% from current price. JMIA is an 8billion market cap African Amazon so there‚Äôs still some run in it.

I'm just trying to understand. So what your saying is that by someone putting a limit sell order on their shares, it makes it so there is a restricted supply of shares to be able to buy for shorts to cover right?

If that's the case, how come there is 125% institutional ownership of the float per TD Ameritrade? How could institutions buy and own more than 100% of the float unless a single share can be sold at least 2 times to 2 different buyers?

Again that‚Äôs exactly what they told Ryan Cohen about chewy. ‚Äú Amazon has all that‚Äù ‚Äú you can‚Äôt go up against the big guys‚Äù now it‚Äôs a 26 billion dollar company. Gaming is the future and GameStop has a huge opportunity to take the majority share of those sales. There‚Äôs no other major store who takes in old consoles on trade like them either. They have 55 million rewards members.
That‚Äôs genius. Haven‚Äôt thought of that before, will keep that in mind.

Love the post. My chart looks a lot like this. For many, they are starting recently meaning they got beginner's luck from a historic bull run. Things will be bumpy in the future, but they need to stick with it because investing is how you retire early and get to do cool shit that you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.

Random showerthought on RBLX. It's going to get its fair share of haters, with people calling it anywhere between a joke to a scam to a doomed and dying child project.

Then WSB and various other Robinhood People buy in by the masses after doing quick DD (which consists of Google Imaging "Roblox"). Inflated valuation and questionable business model doesn't even matter, as this becomes the new PLTR and the meme stock of our times.

You son of a bitch....take my up vote
Realistically, 50-60 a share. If you trust yourself to babysit it every day and not miss the squeeze, it could go way higher than that, but that's super gambley at that point. If you really want to go big or go home then I could see setting a limit sell at 100, but anything more than that is probably just fantasy. Possible, yes, but unlikely. 

A trailing stop of -20% would be ideal imo if your broker allows it. Thay way your upside isn't kneecapped but you'll still catch the squeeze whether you're paying attention or not.

Will someone infinity squeeze my short dick? ü•∫
My minimum target has been $25 by summer, but I could see us there by Christmas. I see many ways we go up. 

I think if shorts don't cover and we hang in the 20-25 range, management will eventually buy back more shares and shorts will become a higher percentage of float plus the price will go up. 

If Cohen buys the company, we go way higher.

If shorts cover, we go way higher.

If management allows Cohen to create their strategic vision, we go way higher.

Minimum target is $25, more likely we go higher towards $50. If the squeeze happens, I can see us north of $100 for a few days.

I don't understand why anyone would pay a dude for sex. Let alone an unattractive Canadian... I mean, it's completely unbelievable to me, it is the easiest shit in the world to find a guy to have sex with, especially an unattractive guy. Was this guy actually her drug dealer or pimp, and wanted to cop to a lesser crime so OP wouldn't suspect a worse crime? Was that her boyfriend, and she's been giving him money, and he was worried OP found out, so he wanted a non-emotional excuse that put the blame on her? Jesus, I am so curious. Some definite fuckery afoot.

I understand the legitimate concern about raising covid cases, but at this point the NFL looks hell bent on pushing forward. Also, with news that the first doeses of the vaccine will be in Washington DC by December, I think that sports teams should have access to it in the not-so-distant future. On top of all of this, you got the NBA returning in a month. Any one of you guys have thoughts? Very happy to hear any take, regardless of what side you're on here.

Your math is gaey bear.

Doesn't mean shit if e-commerce is 10x the volume of brick and mortar.
you did. What I stated was a fact. You‚Äôre just trying to put it to your wrong narrative. you assumed no one makes mistakes and no one would ever read ‚Äú8k in shares‚Äù as anything other than $8,000 worth of shares. Nice one proving your fallacy.

Thanks! I'm new to GME, but I'm surprised earnings calls have that much impact for this industry. I would've guessed that there'd be leaks to sales data about how well they did since these console releases are highly watched not just by GME, but also by the console makers themselves, and probably by the semiconductor industry as well. 

Gambles aside, do you think GME has any hope of turning their business around?
Lips are getting raw. Even tried growing a mustache to protect them, didn't help.

Is there any DD on fisker that shows the company is on a turn around, because they've been making shitty cars for a while now and I'm sure their new one will be a steaming pile.

Looks like mainly EV hype, which is like 75% of my portfolio, so fuck it I'm in. But why should we invest in a proven loser when there are other companies with no track record whatsoever. Does fisker have any partners worth mentioning?

I'm talking about right now. Where does the business go in 2021?

Yeah I remember it was like.. $2 or something earlier this year? I remember thinking "lol what if I bought $500 and it mooned for no reason". 

IMO, the time to make money has come and gone, but look at all these posts about GME. I don't think the price will remain on an upward trajectory.

PLTR is both a good long term hold and a good one to swing trade

It‚Äôs such a stupid prohibition. They‚Äôre stocks! They‚Äôre worth $10 minimum and their mergers are as valid as any other merger! 

The hype is what it is, and yes some people pump their favorites, but it‚Äôs not different than any other $10 speculative play.

I‚Äôve read it bro. But GME is outdated. I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to buy this stock for $5. The new guy bringing chewy makes sense in the pet market.

Nothing here about "virtually unlimited liability". If anything the analogy is that you are picking up hundred dollar bills off of a busy train track, or $10 bills off of a less busy one, or $1 bills off of a virtually abandoned train track.

What is false is that you moved the goalposts and used a shitty analogy.

Peter knows he doesn't have the online social media game like Musk does but that doesn't mean he can't hire some people to start stuff.
Get the fuck outta there man, that bitch is crazy. Canadian brother here tell you to also grab you sac and man up.
Yea i guess your right, the phrasing of the tweet/article is unprofessional and inflated, not to mention its a copy and paste of the Nvidia  article they published lets agree to disagree though. Seeking alpha, market beat are valid sources of information to me. I really started using this sub yesterday idk what they are talking about half the time.
How far into the future should I buy the calls? And do I buy just slightly above current price? (Newbie at options)
Their breakfast baconator is bomb as fuck and they're one of the few fast food places that actually serve fries for breakfast so fuck yeah if you dont like Wendy's let's throw some hands

How can you compare a fucking ganja company to software. Are u dumb ?????
Yo dawg. I‚Äôm 30. It only gets worse.
If you want to gamble sure, but who knows when it would actually hit, been in for months and the shorts hit this hard. Dated calls and shares are the safest. I'm also playing FDs weekly but the long term stuff is covering the cost of gambling for me.
Sir this IS a WENDYS.
MSOS. Has options. Gives you exposure to US cannabis stocks that are traded OTC, rather than just Canadian companies.

Pretty sure you don't. If you live with someone for 3 years you're "common law" married and would owe them for sure. Maybe the length of time differs per province, but I've never been aware of spousal support after a year long relationship that presumably hasn't produced any children.

At first I was like "Ban", but then you mentioned PLTR.
Bought in at $10 sucka

The market overall is fine. We are back to the Feb highs for the most part.

There are some pockets of exuberance and hype but they will sort themselves out. Extract cash where you can but don't risk it all for hype.
I am all-in on GME, moving funds around to get more next week.
It's okay, but too tropey to be top shelf shit.
110 contracts (mostly Jan/Apr) and 1500 shares.

Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me

you can wheel but youd loose out bigly if you were selling covered calls cuz youd essentially miss the squeez

Gold, no. Thats boomer shit. Palladium, Platinum, Silver, Copper, Tungsten, all are much valuable industrially (like terraforming mars once we arrive there with our PLTR calls). Cobalt, Manganese, and Nickel are limiting battery production.

you can sell a call at $25 and buy 100 shares and it would be the same as selling a naked put at $25

in other words, a covered call is the exact same as a naked put at the same strike

yes. or 2021 calls. but shares.  imagine being able to say you were apart of a short squeeze.  just the possibility gets me excited.
Yeah I suppose that makes sense. Like after you get some ez gains first thing ppl do is look for more gains with stocks they know less about, more risky as such. In my instance I think it was just the timing of my investment as apposed to the fundamentals or anything. I‚Äôd definitely like to read into this more see if this is like a mental or straight luck thing more tho if only acting like a beginner would grant you infinite luck lmao
Do something esteemable and it may help you feel better, like a selfless act for someone else. Def don‚Äôt kill yourself.
I‚Äôm doing well in PLTR too. What new technology has GME patented Im unaware of?
Fuck that. Calls are great, and I have a bunch; but this is clearly a shares play.

Even if you can only pick up a few, this price will shoot up enough that 50 shares will make a nice payday. Any shares not available for shorts to cover during the squeeze only makes it go higher.

Cool story bro
200% gains on your puts perhaps. No product no pump unfortunately
I have like 1k shares, smol pp position
I bought these calls back when their stock was $40 I think so that‚Äôs probably why. I put $90k in net stock at $16 and $15k in those calls. Calls are up 65% since purchase.
That sounds exactly like me minus the millions. I pick my spots where I believe in a stock that's on cheaper side so high upside with little lowside risk and don't trade a ton just focus on getting in at decent price in stuff you believe can take off. Got in at 12 for PLTR bought more at 14 and 16, never looking back.

Fuck Citron. All my homies hate Citron.

People only react like this to Ackman headlines without listening to his whole argument.

In March, he predicted a crash but also a V shaped recovery longer term. The headlines left out the recovery part.

Lately he's been saying short term rockiness justifies a hedge, which he recently took, and again, even in the video linked above, that next year will see a huge recovery *in the second half of the year*.

It's not his fault people snip his quotes into soundbites that don't reflect his whole view.
Its the 'smart' thing to do in a sane market, too bad we're in a retarded market where nothing makes sense.

I am speculating there will be people taking profits and selling their shares to the indexers when inclusion begins which will result in a pull back. Part of me wants to hold out till June because Q4 and Q1 has high likelihood of exceeding expectations where they might report profit not relying on EV credits.  If TSLA reaches 1000$ share price (i'll be a millionaire), that means it will have just shy of 1 trillion dollar market cap and I don't think a lot of people will believe that unless you're a TSLA bull. Although TSLA has the potential to exceed that 1 trillion dollar market cap, people think right now will be too early for it to be in such a position.

but i agree, the amount of buying from investment banks and other funds will be HUGE and i think people are underestimating how much it can run.
Gay bears will hate on PLTR hype and say nothing about the GME shit which feels more like a pump. At least pltr has potential in the future GME refuses to change. Rn its the "i cant find consoles anywhere else so they might have some at GME" never again will you ever think about that shit place. Its the blockbuster of gaming retail. Yall will literally be sitting there waiting for some legendary short squeeze. I mean, cool but its still a shit company

If it passes the House it still will need to undergo time for review of the actual law contents itself, and then signing by the president. Trump not likely to be the one to do it.

Lol I took my 120% profit over 7 weeks and will laugh at all the people still buying. Will it go up more? Probably, but I'm out, I doubled my investment.


Edit, I'm probably buying it back for a long term hold but this shit right now is too fucking crazy. Citron being assholes or not there's a legitimate chance it burst in the next month. And if not then I buy back in at a higher price than I wanted.
Calls maybe get yield much more profit, but it also riskier, not really sure  the squeeze come before the earning and the calls are expensive now with the upcoming earning IV.

basically yes, but only works short term. You see, women are much more full of themselves than people think, and they love to think they make a man change solely out of love for them. So bad boys attract a lot at the beginning, and don't giving a fuck makes them essentially double down on their bet they can change you, that's when you get the most because they are really trying to make you fall in love. Once it works, then you are fucked, because they have succeeded and by then every little thing you do is a reason to leave you. Power has shifted

You‚Äôre not on Robinhood, I‚Äôd say you have a pretty good idea bruh
You're missing the point. Will GME be higher in 2 years than it is right now? Sure, quite possibly. Will it be higher in 2 years than it will at the top of the short squeeze? Absofuckinglutely not, there is absolutely ZERO chance of that. The squeeze has potential to take GME over 100, potentially as high as 500 a share, because the price will be driven by shorts getting margin called and being forced to cover, NOT by fundamentals or speculation. Fundamentals and/or speculation could certainly drive the share price much higher than where it is now, but fucking $500? Are you actually insane? Zero. Chance.
Yep. All in GME.
Pretty sure they are the ones betting against it
Go and watch The Lord of the Rings, it will teach you how to pronounce Palantir and also you get to watch some great movies.

This doesn't work. The only way to buy shares that can't be shorted is to buy them in a retirement or cash account.

Black Friday sales at retailers were down 52%...online sales were up 20%+ 

Your post is factually incorrect

GME earnings will be dogshit - just look at the last 2 quarters
Whether intentional or not, those posts inform algorithmic trading models which results in further pumping of PLTR. So it's dumb but also very clever.
I agree. But this conversation is about a stock without options available. Each transaction effects the stock directly at 100%. 

If it‚Äôs cheaper to short a stock with options to make a metric shit load of them expire worthless there‚Äôs a greater chance of that with PLTR than a stock without options being shorted. 

Any given Friday you will see this happen at ‚Äúcommon‚Äù high volume strike points.

Yes, though it can be arguable that transitioning to an OTC market comes with its own caveats - lesser trading volume due to more limited access, lesser premium for being in a non-US exchange/not as regulated. May or may not be a big difference over the long run if suddenly all Chinese companies are moved there but it also remains to be seen.

You understand basic Supply versus Demand, yes?

Selling a stock short creates an artificial demand at a later date because you have to return the shares at a later date.

Currently, over 100% of the entire share base is owed, meaning that there potentially can be a huge demand if the price goes too high.

There have been several big fish purchasing shares to simply lock up as that decreases the supply overall. 

If the share price rises too high, the investors that are short shares have to buy them to return them to their borrowers. 

If this occurs on a large scale, you will see an drastic price hike. That is why people are saying they are going to buy large swaths of shares on Monday, to create this very situation.
Based

Ok well if we‚Äôre doing ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù Palantir hasn‚Äôt picked up enough corporate clients to justify the current price nor is it aligned with their own timetable of earnings projection. 

Citron makes a TWEET saying that the price is due for a correction and everyone loses it. It‚Äôs not even a long position it‚Äôs by year end. Stocks with steep rally without clear justification always draw the attention of shorts. Not sure why the word casino is so offensive unless you‚Äôre taking as a slight towards this sub.

I meant as throwing the suggestion out there for people to jump in, it‚Äôs been on a tear the last few months.
You can sell shares you don‚Äôt own by borrowing it. E.g. I borrow FOO at $10, sell it, then the price drops, I buy it back at $5, and return the shares to their owner. If the stock goes up instead, the owner may want their shares back now. That means the borrower needs to buy them back at a higher price for a loss.

This is shorting a stock.

So many people have done this to GME that if the stock goes up it could cause these shorts to start covering (buying) either to stop the bleeding or because they‚Äôre required to via margin call. More buyers forces the price even higher.

There‚Äôs currently over 100% short interest on GME, meaning every single share been borrowed and then the borrowed shares were lent again. Any uptick in the price could trigger a chain reaction of shorts buying back the stock, thus squeezing it to insane heights.

Look up the Volkswagen short squeeze to see what‚Äôs possible.

Mid December start buying weekly puts. Jan 2018 we had a -10% due to a large equity sell off because of all the rebalancing asset managers perform.

I would do both, but I am mostly in calls.
I don‚Äôt mess with calls. I only own stocks and I own significant amount of each so I may be biased but 1) SFT will catch up to CVNA unlike VRM 2) SPCE has a launch coming soon and the chart is breaking out 3) LMND is a long term hold but chart also breaking out too near term

True but my point was for stocks without options available. They do have potential to run up faster because every transaction effects the stock at 100%
I dont see the value long term personally, if the concept takes off im sure big insurance will run off with the idea, maybe turn it into a big marketing shtick like "now introducing pay by the mile" with huge television ad bys. 

On the other side of it it , getting in early might be a good play as it will initially disrupt the industry. 

I think short term it looks good, long term depends on their customer base, if they are able to undercut their competitors while staying profitable.

They definitely have brand equity. It will be interesting to see them turn around. Definitely an uphill battle but the gains could be amazing. The gains usually are in turnarounds. 

I wouldn‚Äôt count too much on the rev share unless they announce it‚Äôs a decent %. They haven‚Äôt announced one with Sony either, which outsells Xbox 2 to 1.

Citron didn‚Äôt even say anything bad about Pilantir, they were getting in on the profits - it‚Äôll probably keep going up until lockout ends when people get scared again.

> I 100% wrongly think Palantir has to slow down for a few day. Nio did same thing at around $20 for like 2-3 weeks, I sold all my positions and then boom...$50 while I watch.

üëÜ you‚Äôre making the same mistake again bro, there will be a morning pull back Monday before shooting up again.
You are the problem

I‚Äôm thinking about selling my NVDA and TQQQ shares just to buy more GME. I‚Äôve got 200 shares, 15c for Jan 15th, and 12c for April 16th.
those are call women and pussies
No thanks

Either result is the same
Only difference is the amount of dopamine you recieve from altruism

Highest short interest.

Many people have puts, MMs are selling these puts and don't want them to be ITM. They drive the price of the stock up to let all those contracts expire worthless.

Or a short squeeze

1/15 $23c GOLD, bought a decent amount of stock on Tuesday for 22.89(for the .09 div). Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it go down on Monday-Tuesday and then start to transcend above $28 again by 1/15. I plan on holding the stock until it gets to the $35-40 range, or 18 months after Yellen takes office. 1/22 calls are also relatively cheap, and you can get 1/22 or 1/23 UUP calls for pretty cheap as leverage against your GOLD positions.
You bastard, I‚Äôm in for 200 shares on Monday. 

What kind of window do you expect for the squeeze? Will it peak for few minutes, hours, days?
INSG good long term...as 5g grows it will too
You're an idiot. This is a good thing. WSB is finally making things move. Once this place settles into a meme stock it goes wild. We all make money. There will be another after PLTR.
Zm will run up monday. And when earnings come out Tuesday it will most likely crash
Like 40-60%
I have 3 shares of Tesla at $408.. want to add 1-2 more shares but was waiting for a pullback. Should I just buy now or wait? Been seeing a lot of people saying there won‚Äôt be a pullback for a few weeks most likely

Hmm good to hear. I only have Nio and was trying to decide if should get some XPEV or add more Nio. Saw some XPEV videos and it looks pretty appealing, car is nice and seems to get good reviews. New scisssor door model could also be unique for people that have always wanted a lambo etc

Buying in with low IV is ideal and IV crawling up while you hold. This makes your far OTM/ATM/ITM calls more valuable. 

Find a stock you like with low IV that exceeds EC buy a couple months, hold until EC run up and sell before earnings you should be able to make good money.

Yeah, just trying to point out why I think there actually *is* a decent chance of a turnaround in the long term. They have 55m customers. In a growing market. They have brand equity over retailers like Walmart and Target. COVID showed that customers still want to buy online through GameStop. Disc consoles won't go away entirely for a large number of reasons, and the current mix looks like it's 80-20 this cycle. They're getting rev share for digital sales on Xbox's sold through them. It's another 6-8 years before another console. While the path isn't easy, there's at least several potential avenues to go down that can turn them into a sustainably profitable retailer that should be worth more than a paltry $1B.
no surprises is the ultimate feels song
Hey guys, Andrew Left of Citron Research ^^TM here.  Just wanted to pop by and see if you guys took my advice?  The stock market is not a casino and you should all sell your PLTR now when you still have a chance.  
  
  
Just kidding I'm a massive cuck and just wanted to buy in under 30 before it moons.
Yes
What are the extraordinary claims? Starting TC of 70k and current TC of 150k with 10 YOE in tech is on the lower side of the curve. 1.6 million over 10 years of savings along with a wife who works and seems to have no kids isn't beyond belief on that income, especially if he invested in Tesla and shitcoins like every other redditor.

I got in this week, will add more next week. Tracking traders positions, every day there are more and more people in GME. Looks like the squeeze is about to get going.
That S&P inclusion, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering about most. But I don‚Äôt see the negative side of that, especially seeing investments banks, etc getting into TSLA once it becomes available in the S&P.
Calls will force the squeeze more so than shares bc market makers will be forced to delta hedge which drives up the asset prices

When it expires ITM. If it expires worthless those shares are sold back on the market. 

20% does help move the stock price. But 100% moves it a lot more is all I was saying. 

I guess if the point is, options let‚Äôs more people buy in causing more stock purchases. That is correct my only point was that 100 shares effects the price much more than 1 call.
Yes. I am a big believer in GM and shifted some of my earnings from TSLA into GM.

> Calls indirectly effect the stock but unless ITM it‚Äôs only 20% until it expires worthless and the hedge is sold.

Yes, but when the price keeps going up as MMs cover, more become ITM, which causes more covering, which causes more call buying, which causes more covering, etc etc. It snowballs. It keeps going up because people are buying calls, and people keep buying calls because it keeps going up. It's a positive feedback loop.

That's a gamma squeeze, and it's why PLTR went vertical.
I‚Äôll chime in and say pretty much this. If you think it‚Äôs shit and you should leave, it‚Äôs shit and you should leave.
This is why the most important thing is that you start out with loving yourself fully and without judgment first.

I apologize if you covered this as I didn‚Äôt read most of it, but I just want to mention that selling puts is VERY underrated. If a stock has a lot of volatility but you like it as a long term buy ‚Äî what are the potential outcomes to selling puts?
1. The shares tank and you buy the shares at a lower price...so what? You were going to buy them anyway, so you just saved yourself some money
2. The stock goes up or stays flat...in which case you just collect the option premium

Very, very rough estimate of YoY black friday sales, using this survey:

[https://blackfriday.com/news/cyber-week-survey](https://blackfriday.com/news/cyber-week-survey)

And the 21% increase in online sales (assuming phone is online sales) and 52% drop in in-store sales,

44\*1.21+39\*0.48+17\*1.21 = 92.53% (YoY -7.5%)

This does not account for the differences in items usually bought online vs in-store, ie more premium items could be sold online etc.

Because those calls weren‚Äôt even written offered until Friday market. The $40 was there a few days before.
Because of RH‚Äôs shitty UI. They use mid price, which depending on OI can be out of whack with reality. The price is in line with others so most likely a lower bid on 40 dropping it down

It does from covering. 20% of the option goes into stocks which is why Fridays the stock moves so much AH covering ITM options. 

But the bottom line is it‚Äôs purchase of stocks that move the underlying la price.

No yoloing is the way. I just think it‚Äôs so many posts today that is doing it. Honestly I haven‚Äôt followed Tesla close enough. It was my first ever trade a little over a year ago.

Probably because the first thing a beginner buys is something they know and understand. They bought it because they had some level of knowledge to indicate that owning shares of xyz company would be a solid investment. They were right. They then don‚Äôt know why they were successful and just know that they can make money doing this. They want more so they experiment with how to get more out of the market and try to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù as much as possible from people with more ‚Äúexperience ‚Äú. Most of what they pick up is standard BS put out there to take advantage of them. Diversified balanced portfolio this, options margin that, analyst price targets this, yolo that. It‚Äôs all bs. Think back to what you bought and why. Did you understand what you were buying from a business perspective? Now that you‚Äôre not doing as well, why is that? Do you understand the businesses that you‚Äôre buying and what‚Äôs going on with them? How‚Äôs that first business you bought doing? Still going up? How would your gains look right now if you were holding just that? Wsb isn‚Äôt really the place for this but Charlie munger probably has the simplest most consistent, effective investing mentality you can build a foundation around.

Right but they are covering 20% of the option, fridays see a larger pump but this is because actual stocks are purchased. Calls indirectly effect the stock but unless ITM it‚Äôs only 20% until it expires worthless and the hedge is sold. 

Correct, it‚Äôs low volume covering buying shares which moves the stock price. But shares move the stock price.

Ah makes sense, thanks for clearing that up! So ultimately, we‚Äôre hoping for linearity to be proven in the next few months, and if so, tendies. The farthest out we can go with options is May 2021 as of now. Is it even worth it to go that far out? Or are you sticking to Jan/Feb $7.5C?
Friend of mine who is a programmer mentioned them as a place a friend of his got a a job at. A few weeks later I hear about IPO. So, I research the company, see massive growth and fundamentally sound company. Ran by two really smart guys (Thiel and Karp).Huge goverment contracts with multiple software platforms (streams of revenue)and now they are eying the private sector. Company seemed pretty unique doing really cool stuff that only they could do (moat) .Read examples from palantir how they help companies find cost saving in patterns of information. Seemed like pretty cutting edge futuristic stuff that if adopted by a few companies within a particular market the others would have to follow suit due to pricing pressure (having to stay competitive on price).**Basically,** **cool futuristic company that also happens to be well ran and competitively positioned.**
So I agree that Cohen is a catalyst. I was only repeating cohens claim in his letter to prove a point. I also think the new management has done some good turnaround efforts regarding working capital. 
However, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be able to turn it around enough to survive long term. You can check my comment history for financial reasons, but ultimately, this company is dying as games go digital and everyone who is bullish long term believes gamestop can turn into steam and compete with Amazon. 
Anyways, I mostly posted cause that dude was being an asshole  and referring to financial statements without posting any actual financials, because if he did look at them, he would understand the financials are shit.

If you sold shares of PLTR on Friday you‚Äôre an idiot with paper hands just like everyone last Friday when it had a bad day. If you read about them it‚Äôs really a no brainer that they‚Äôll be triple digits in 5 yrs, especially if you know Thiels business philosophy. I bought at IPO and made a thousand bucks a day Monday-Wednesday, Friday was a healthy pullback after insane gains and didn‚Äôt even pullback much considering citrons hit piece. Fuck, just seeing citron short it on Friday made me buy a hundred more shares on the dip.

He was shitfaced too.
I agree overall, but it‚Äôs just a result of the state of the market. Here‚Äôs what I think we‚Äôll see after the inevitable crash: all of the small account people who have no idea how markets work will magically disappear after their accounts go from $300, to $2000, to $0. Everyone jumps on the ship when meme stocks shoot up 50% a week, collecting tendies along the way. I think six months to a year after the next crash, the only people left on WSB will be those who have somewhat of a conscious grasp on valuations and we‚Äôll be right back to quality DD. Only smart people make money when markets go down, or stay flat. Here‚Äôs the thing, for this last bit of the bull run, jump on a couple memes, make a few tendies, and enjoy the ride. We‚Äôll get our sub back soon enough.
You bought the dip and still losses 400... the theta is super high even if it goes up by 2% tom.. the price of the contract is still the same.. goodluck

did everyone remember to participate in small business saturday?
Don't agree. Go read up on the changes that are happening. It's fundamentals are going to improve with a refreshed board, getting a share of digital revenue with partnerships with Microsoft, increasing e-commerce sales (500% growth last quarter), closures of hundreds of stores, and then finally, a potential activist in Ryan Cohen. RC has stated they offered him a board seat which he turned down because he wants more (aka run the damn thing). But either way, over the next few years they will turn a profit with the new console cycle, and depending how they make strategic changes, could turn into a long term profitable retailer. At $1B market cap, plenty of upside. This is also reflected in the way their debt is priced -- finally trading at par.

Nah. That's all I got. Everything else I have is invested in my business in the form of equipment. It's just been tough to find gigs lately so I've been investing in stocks.
Why everyone keep hyping this one article where only 6 people stood on line?
More stimulus = more printing = more inflation = dollar down

But with the previous stimmy setup very little of the printed money actually left institutional vaults,  which delays the incoming inflation.

So dollar down, but could be a while before you can feel it.
They‚Äôll back it back at $0 when they go bankrupt

Depends what you consider to be long. LGVW is a good buy now when there was a dip on Fridays. They'll be going through a merge soon. Hold for a few months and there's pretty high chances of it going up.
We know.

I've been lurking on this sub and kinda posting since like 2015.  

This sub has always spammed the shit out of the meme stocks of the month or quarter. And guys like you have always posted that it used to be better.  Tsla, amd, nvda, gme etc etc.  

The difference is there is no down time between memes now. It's just one after the next each week.  And people are making money off them. 

At this point if you're not smart enough to get on the pump in a market that has no real world basis any more. Than well sir you are the actual retard.
In other words, a bunch of people switched over to selling calls, no one actually purchased shares and that dropped the price?
This guy says TDA told him the gme squeeze is BS. is this true and if so why or why not https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2ysrf

Thats seriously retarded why wouldnt you wait until before earnings
While I agree that Cohen has been a catalyst, we are seeing a ton of evidence of a turnaround. A refreshed board including ex-head of Nintendo Americas and several activist board members. They closed several hundred stores this year and plan to close hundreds more. E-commerce revenues up several hundred percent (it may or may not stick, time will tell). And new digital content deals with Microsoft. Then you add in an epic console cycle and you have a business that very well could turn into a juggernaut in the gaming industry. Cohen just thinks they could do a lot more, which I also agree with. But it may be the difference between turning around the business into a slightly profitable, $3-5B retailer versus a $10B+ retailer. Either way, it's a ton of upside.
How do you think options dont affect price? I think you are maybe simplifying it a bit too much

I honestly have no idea. Will there be a squeeze? Probably. Historically this has ranged from $30-$100/share however the underlying analysis of GME's potential squeeze is different than past scenarios....have to wait and see ;)

The 0.001% rev share on xbox's purchased in store ain't doing shit to move the needle. They're bankrupt in 5 years max.
90 shares at 13.9$ I can send screenshots if you want. I sold it all...
What‚Äôs the reason behind the slap?
didn't expect it to rise so fast, was expecting 50's maybe Q2 or Q3 next year. didn't want to risk higher strike prices as well as lose long term capital gains tax rate. told myself to not get greedy, just hold the $3 calls as if they are shares, and being call options i can't use margin on them, so prevents me from using margin and risking margin calls.
I mean compared to ‚Äústonks only go up‚Äù, it is pretty big brain stuff
VW is actually going all in. By 2030 they will be mainly electric. VW just gave a company called QuantumScape $300m for research on solid state lithium batteries which are better in every way than what's currently on the market. The problem is the technology isn't scalable to full production yet. In my opinion, another big player will eventually knock Tesla off it's pedestal.
Or you can just pretend to short GME and call in and ask for the inventory. If you‚Äôre in Canada, most of the brokerages only borrow stock that was bought on margin from margin accounts.
Uh.. look this is great and all, pltr memes and all that.. have some fucking dignity and leave tonight. God damn.

New York, London, and Los Angeles were the top-selling cities worldwide on Black Friday, with top-selling countries including US, UK, and Canada
Mobile sales on Black Friday were 67% compared to 33% of sales made on desktop. In 2019, 69% of Black Friday sales were made on mobile and 31% on desktop
Top product categories globally during Black Friday were apparel and accessories with health and beauty and home and garden following

14% of cross-border orders placed on the platform on Black Friday
20,000+ tonnes of carbon emissions offset from the delivery of every order placed on Shopify‚Äôs platform on Black Friday

I agree on all your points.   Been in the oil and gas industry for 13 years now.   Seen fracking/horizontal drilling go from a ‚Äòwildcatter‚Äô game to now a big part of the majors future production strategy.

Something just seemed off when I drove past. I don‚Äôt think he just fucked up and crashed. The roadway there is fairly flat and was pretty smooth then. Two lanes wide and the exit ramp wasn‚Äôt anything crazy. Just a slight right bend uphill to the road. And he had a GT2 or GT3 and wouldn‚Äôt have had to lock up the brakes like he did unless someone wasn‚Äôt letting him go where he was trying to go and couldn‚Äôt correct the car quick enough to just go straight past the ramp. 

I don‚Äôt know though. Just sticks with me for some reason.

I don't care if it happens. Honestly, what I do know is that my shares are going up by about $1/week right now, and I got in around $10. And you're assuming it's institutions only driving the shorts, when that may not be there l the case. Ar one point, market cap was only about 60m. What is it now?
Holy shit you actually listened to that dumb ass that posted his play on a short squeeze in GME?

Get fucked man. I'll go ahead and copy/paste my response to his 4 point DD.

1- this is just fucking retarded. You realize that volume on thi is option was like 16 today? Who woulda thought there would be 16 other people this stupid?

2- this stock isnt htting $30

3- there isnt a hard and fast rule of 20%... if by chance you're assuming the market maker is risk neutral and delta hedged, the delta on your option is 18.xx not 20. 
There was 1600+ contracts traded today. You're 25 isnt moving shit.

4- GMEs all time high is what ~50 bucks back in 2013 or something? When the company was doing like 3 billion more in sales and was actually profitable?

**GME is nothing like the porshe/volkswagen debacle. VW has/had an extremely complex capitalization structure that leads to limited float. The increased position in VW by porshe resulted in an available float of like 1%.

GME by contrast has an available float of like 65%? Did you miss that very important aspect of short squeeze plays?**

OSTK was not a short squeeze in the traditional sense and it's stupid to frame it as such. The initial squeeze was brought on by their stupid ass digital token dividend. The continued rally was due to market forces. (You know tje whole covid thing and ecommerce thing).

Risk Mitigation- ... so you own a shit ton of shares from before the run up. That's not relevant to the outlined strategy.

Short interest- the short interest is record breaking because this company is 3 years away from bankruptcy lol.
I mean. If u look at chart its not that crazy. Still waaay over its moving averages. Im no so smart but it prob bounce off like 30ish then go back ups

A free roll (has a few different meanings) but I use to to refer to playing with house money.

In this case, I scored profits on earlier positions, took all the money off the table then put only the profits back into a long term position (in this case LEAPS). I mapped out the cash tied up with different plays vs the ROI at different price targets and landed on ITM leaps as my final resting place. Also I needed a couple grand to shore the position up as a full free roll meaning I still had a couple grand of my own money in them so I wanted that out via a small scale quick strike that has worked for me many times in the past.

Thanks for the detailed response man. Yeah this is a wild one for sure. Especially Friday going into Monday like you mentioned. I just feel like it'll make a pretty solid run by January 15th at least. 

I think PLTR will do well under this administration, Biden has mentioned them by name in 2010 and he also picked Avril Haines (previously employed by Palantir) for director of national intelligence. If they have a hand in COVID tracing and are involved in this administrations health care plans that could be big. I'm very bullish on this company long term. Just a gut feeling and if I'm totally wrong I won't be surprised. I am just a WSB retard after all lol
I was thinking about grabbing some PFE leaps monday but yeah the company moves so slow sometimes lol

[removed]
true. but if you are that bullish in a short amount of time, theta decay wouldnt even matter at that point because the premiums that you miss out on from a regular call would make up for it.

So many perspectives to look at honestly, makes my head spin

Pltr is going to be used by every nato allied nation to analyze tons of data. Sounds like a huge market cap to me.

Correct. In this market you can‚Äôt short dog shit as people are buying it.
Well of course. I was just offering a safer investment strategy to someone who is asking questions in a meme sub rather than simply Googling. 

I think everyone here heavily underestimates how much people actually research before blindly dropping large amounts of money. Any joker with a few bucks made big in the last few months. That means nothing outside of a quickly growing bubble. Let's not act like these last few months in the market were normal. The reality is that most people lose most of their money most of the time on options.

They lose 100 mil / quarter right now. They have 350 mil in stockholder equity. I would say they survive 3 years max
Tell me how I lied. I said writing contracts can create virtually unlimited liability. Please tell me what part of that is false.

Look into warrants. Ofc not exactly options but they give you the right to buy a share at 11.50 after the lockup period which is usually 30 days. Also warrants are usually 1/3 share so you need to buy 3 for 1

Shares effect stock price. Options do not. Option premium takes stock price and volume into account. 

That‚Äôs why AH trading makes stock price move so much, no options. But the stock price can move wildly with low volume.
I will buy put credit spreads\* OR sell a put and collect the premium.
That should work. I‚Äôll roll over those 12/4 next week probably to something around that range too.

if these are all realized gains then you need to be sure to take some out before january, because if you lose it all after december you are still stuck with a huge tax bill for this tax year.
If it's becoming increasingly clear that GME will keep going up short sellers will want to begin closing. I don't think anybody believes GME is a good long term bet so I would assume they would wait out this temporary hype.
This is NOT the way
Margin call
Andrew Left left
Why is it not reasonable? In this Quarter ER Palantir raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.07 billion  and $1.072 billion, which would represent 44% growth from a year  earlier. Most Tech companies trade at 100x. It is still in customer acquisition mode. If it continues to grow at this level it could get to $150B by 2025. Short term there will be some volatility  but overall it's a solid company with niche products that cannot be easily duplicated.

Ah 12/4 is a little ballsy, i bought 12 5/21s 44$ cause my 6 5/21 35$ were doing so well. Fundamentally i am a fan of the stock, in their scaling and their reach im sure they will reach 60-70 by this time next year assuming there are no data breaches. I see the appeal of PLTR as a growth with unique positioning in the market, and has an enormous upside once it fully scales into commercial applications. I dont think this is a pump and dump unless ur focusing on weeklies and monthlys. Long term i think this stock legit has value.
I was just about to comment about the fight tonight

Whats the point of a 3500/3600 spread though?

If you are that bullish on AMZN wouldnt it be better to just get a regular call?

Im still noob to spreads so im curious. Like if im overall bullish on apple would it be better for me to do something closer? like 120/130 ? I mean it does increase my profit. I guess the biggest biggest benefit is no theta. So if you are bullish theres no point of doing a ITM call on your legs...?

Most of the panic from PLTR is from folks buying calls expiring next week. They panic sold. What do you think is going to happen to Joe Tard once his 500 shares go down 2%? He's going to panic sell.
Probably lmao 
He‚Äôs a sneaky motherfucker that would do shit like this just how he did it back in March
if they borrowed shares, they are paying interest on the borrowed shares. So it costs shorters money to borrow the shares. Eventually most rational people close the trade if they are paying interest and the trade is not moving in their direction.
I drove to west Chester two days after that accident. Was a pretty fucked up feeling. The skid marks looked like he was racing someone and the didn‚Äôt let him take the exit ramp. There was no way that Porsche he had couldn‚Äôt take that ramp at 140 at least.

People want to hate on you but I think you have some great options here. 
 
They have not lost their touch. This consolidation has been since their last earnings, which didn't have the iphone sales on it. 

Plenty of analysts have AAPL at 140+

Holiday season is here, people are buying apples products just like every year. I actually just switched back to iPhone from Android, and my iPhone 12 pro max has been on backorder for some time. The demand is clearly still here.

Now they've got plenty of new in-housw hardware, new macs, 5G iphones, etc. Jusr because they've been sideways for a few months doesn't mean they're done for. They will pop and it will be awesome. 

I've held AAPL for years, and in its history it has never been a bad buy. If you're short term like most of the retards giving you shit, sure you could have bought at the top in August and still be bagholding. But if you plan on keeping those diamond hands, this will likely pay off.

Good play man fuck all the people telling you otherwise. Be patient and get rich

üòÇ it‚Äôs a circle story
I‚Äôm in at 5.34, I plan to sell around 8, but it also depends on the rate of growth because it‚Äôs grown a large percentage in a short amount of time at this point, if it hit‚Äôs that price before it dips again or if the growth stagnates in the upcoming weeks I‚Äôll sell what I have, either way I‚Äôll buy the dip, i can‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôll raise to 8 before a dip but if it does I‚Äôd imagine a dip is even more likely. At the price that I have my shares at and how much the price has rose since then which was not a large amount of time, I‚Äôm confident that I bought low enough for a short or long term play. I wont say that I guarantee it‚Äôs a good short term play at the price that it is now, however it may be a good plan to buy some shares now as the play will be there either short or long term, if it dips you double down if it doesn‚Äôt then it‚Äôs money in the bank, only way to miss out on the gains is to not be apart or to buy too high which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too high for the longterm move so even if the short term doesnt work out like it‚Äôs showing to, it‚Äôs still pretty low risk. The risk level is low enough compared to the potential rise in price that to me it‚Äôs a no brainer for anyone, the only thing to decide is the degree in which you‚Äôre willing to invest, in my case it is a lower percentage of my market value than it couldve been which means I‚Äôm missing out of a lot of money with how much it‚Äôs grown since I bought not very long ago, however I‚Äôm content in the prospects of my short or long term play in this either way, I dont see why a large growth in price in a short period would give any indications that it wouldnt be a good longterm play when the price is still valued pretty realistically.
same, econ degree is worth dick

I think earnings will likely be good, but ZOOM will dump all the same. There‚Äôs no future in ZOOM after COVID in my opinion. And MSFT Teams is becoming a part of MSFT office making ZOOM irrelevant. Companies are going to go with what they got. And they all already have MSFT Office. This thing will likely fall like a rock after earnings. Market Makers will cool this thing down quicker than you can hit the sell button on market open after earnings.

You see, MMs get to create imaginary shares (sqroot(-1)), so GME is actually shorted in 5 dimensions (our 3 spacial, time, and the imaginary dimension).

So if we all buy calls/shares, we make the stock go tangential to positive infinity as it approaches a certain price which we will call G.
This place is like ANTIFA.

There are no leaders, there is no organizational structure. 

And if you think some moron with a shit post about lets all put our nickels and dimes together to move a stock on the market will actually do anything, then you are truly retarded enough to belong here.
THIS DUDE IS ANDREW LEFT!!
Yeah might be a little too late to the party is all I'm saying. I'll toss a few thousand into it and expect it to go down.
No AI would ever make the same kind of trades I do. No reputable tech company would make a robot that buys 100s of  20% OTM weeklies every week hoping to become a millionaire in one trade.

Yeah, and I should be clear, that it's specifically the Black-Scholes model that only works for European options.  The variables of it were called The Greeks because they were obviously Greek letters.  However, since then, we have developed pricing models that use those same variables to a degree, to price American options.  examples would be the Binomial or Trinomial Pricing Models.  It's just that "The Greeks" usually refers to the variables of the Black-Scholes.

Debit spreads don‚Äôt negate theta. They have more effect on other Greeks. Most importantly they reduce IV. If IV is high, a spread can make option play cheaper and thus more likely to profit.

Whats the point of converting a long call into a spread to lock gains if you dont have PDT?
They buy back shares when it's either 1) a profitable trade, i.e. the stock has gone down enough or 2) it has run up so much that they are forced to cover if the stock has run up or risk financial ruin
Anyone looking at SOL? Or thoughts on it? Pump potential?
1. Maybe. They can decide to take up cases or not.
2. Technically yes

Everyone expecting apex to moon like PLTR don't realize that there are no options for apex, so it literally can't gamma squeeze like PLTR did.

I mean it can go up, and it almost definitely will, but not like PLTR.

that sort of meme strength requires options leverage
No clue honestly. I would have sold Friday and rebought Monday after you get an indication of the direction it‚Äôs going to go. You have likely already lost a lot of value so I may hold just to see how it goes and possibly (if it were me) sell after the morning pump before the morning dump. 

Rest of the day could bleed in either direction honestly will really depend on how the rest of the market feels about PLTR. 

I will note PLTR was going to dip on Friday regardless. People profit taking and not wanting to hold into the weekend where theta eats away your profit.  I fall under this category. My plan was to buy back in Monday during the post pump dip (at a cheaper price than fridays sold options) for the afternoon run up. Now I‚Äôm likely going to sit in the sidelines and see how it goes. Because really have no idea how this is going to shake out, not in a hurry to hold another autists bags.

Both are in contracting rather than expanding industries.

People need to realize there's some sense to "inverse WSB." The way I gauge it is by emojis. The more posts of tickers that are followed by emojis, that shits entered into pump and dump territory. If you think this is stupid go back a few months. VALE, NKLA, GME, JKS, APHA, PLTR, etc.

Once there's a pullback and the emotional stop, then think about getting back again.

I know all of you are hoping on the GME train now and me and some others have been riding this thing for a while now so don‚Äôt fuck it up for us
If you want the squeeze to happen and want to make a lot of money with it BUY SHARES AND DIAMOND HAND
If you buy shares than there it will trigger a larger squeeze because no one will see the short retards their shares back causing GNE to moon to 200+ 
If you buy calls nothing changes and may lead to manipulation of GME until all of your retard calls expire worthless... then the squeeze will commence without you
You‚Äôre not a cheap retard, just a poor retard.

It‚Äôs incredibly stupid that in my state (CA) I can go to a card room and play poker 24/7 but I can‚Äôt do the same thing online ever unless I drive across the state lines to NV.
Buying in a marginable account will not help the cause. Brokerages will automatically lend the shares to shorters . 

To be effective for a short squeeze, GME shares should be bought in a cash only account and not in a marginable one. This will effectively reduce the available shares to short. The only way they short your shares in this situation is if you sign an agreement to lend your shares in return for some interest. 

Right now the interest rate is 7.3% and you get half of it if you lend your shares.

EDIT: Changed a auto-correct typo. Shifters changed to shorters

Well, the average yearly hospitalization amount for flu in the USA is ~500,000 and right now we have had 564,952 hospitalized with COVID. 

Flu has a average yearly death count of like 40,000 and COVID is currently at ~265,000. 

Plus, there's a flu vaccine that's been readily available and adapted yearly to the flu strain. Vs COVID, there isn't one available and won't be widely available to impact numbers until the spring.

The winter running gear has been amazing so far. My performance not so amazing. I got 2.66km in 0:16:31. Then I was totally fucked because my heart rate averaged 176 bpm. Shit.

I had double those positions, but I sold half of each to roll over into April 2021 30$ calls just to be safer. With an average cost of around 9600$, I am up over 100% currently at around 21000$. When GME hits 30$ I'm selling half my position and letting the rest ride.

I'm 45 and never married. I used to feel bad and drink a lotta beer. I quit drinking beer, saved my money & invested. I started playing piano for a hobby, and I have money now. I wish I would have given up on women sooner. All my broke, divorced friends are envious of me now - I would not change a thing. I'm very comfortable and secure.
the shorts are big funds, they would lose wayyyyyy more money covering, they can short for a decade paying the borrow rate, GME will go bankrupt, it is a dog shit company.

You think the shorts don't know how much short interest there is? They are doubling down.

You should read up how VW short squeeze happened, the shorts have to be FORCED to cover, when there aren't enough floats. It won't happen this time.

They've had the ability to do so for awhile along with ICBM tech but haven't, because of compliance, NATO regulation, the IAEA. Bunch of shit.

Should‚Äôve bought actual shitcoin instead of buying something that tracks the price of shitcoin
I noticed the bot language when they started using exclamation points after saying PLTR lol nobody is that enthusiastic here. I sold PTLR at peak and when everyone here was hyping it up more I bought calls on MGNI instead and banked. I agree, be careful. Sadly many people here will go down with the ship before selling.
can we be friends?

nah im not pulling after that, just that it could go higher and set a new floor after that. but i will be exiting my feb calls after that of course, haven't decided what to do with that portion yet.
I don‚Äôt doubt Tesla hitting $700 in a couple months.  When you have mutual funds trying to figure out how to incorporate Tesla in blocks,  then the limited amount of shares out there in the float;  it‚Äôs a no brainer the price targets are high...  just need patience

Death of retail. So many going to go bankrupt. Doesn't matter if gamestop goes out of business last, because retail shopping won't exist for anything that isn't custom or urgent. Shoe stores, grocery stores, medical, flooring showrooms, restaurants and bars call, anything that is identical to amzn is lol ok sure, puts on M, BBY.

No, pure euphoria to 370. Get in losers
ahh yes, it gets funnier and funnier every time one of you pathetic retards reposts.
GME def has redeeming qualities about it, this ryan dude is also highly regarded. The short squeeze is honestly a bonus but there is no denying that there is a positive outlook for GME.
Stocks is better if you want to stick it to the man. And also options might expire before the squeeze.

I didn't realize I was talking with the great Bernanke! I had a zoom meeting with you recently. I don't think you're wrong about best buy, but gamestop has it's own merits and I believe it will achieve more positive price action and faster because it is at a critical pivot point in its turnaround.

From Quora:

"This  is completely untrue. As others mentioned, you must request a  certificate of your stock in order to be in possession and keep them  from being borrowed. Most brokers do not do this because the make a  percentage for the transaction. Otherwise, with a fully funded account  you can collect these interest rates/rebates yourself. Your broker is  the holder of your position and reserves the right to loan your shares  at any given time. This is written in your brokerage agreement and if  not readily available you can give them a call.

Setting  a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your  broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your  position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to  continually sell and buy back, some times hundreds of times in a matter  of minutes, your position. With high frequency trading this often  happens from algorithms or a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù.

Furthermore,  there are plenty of contractors and promoters working the chat rooms  and forums telling people falsely that if they set high limit orders  they will protect their positions. But actually, they are misleading  them in order to scope their possible exits for the reasons previously  mentioned and put selling pressure on the order book.

Many  argue that these practices are a conflict of interest and rightfully  so. Beware people on reputable sites like this that carelessly give you  false information because they may have different motives than ‚Äútrying  to help‚Äù, especially if they think it doesn‚Äôt affect your position. When  brokers negligently loan out shares that aren‚Äôt available, it can cause  a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù that could send a Security to extreme highs (DRYS  2016)."
We already established that market is closed and that there's no more cocaine, bored af, but yet not really down to like, make an effort.
LOL, look at GME's short float. HOly cow.

It breaks sec law for financial institutions. We are not a financial institution. We are a rag tag group of loosely connected retards. Those laws don't apply to us.

WARNING: Those with autism should not buy this stock. All others carry on as scheduled.
SPCE could be good for a momentum trade but I wouldn't hold it for too long, and certainly not long term -- it's very volatile and there aren't any fundamentals behind the company. It's mainly just been getting pumped and dumped repeatedly since early this year. BABA could be a good longer term hold if you caught it near it's bottom the past few weeks, but there's a lot of political risk so I would sell pretty quickly if doesn't establish an uptrend soon from its lows.
Company way overvalued and it's a P&D. Short term gains, sure, if you have a day trade available, otherwise really volatile and gone up too much over this year to sustain growth

NIO has $3B in cash, a megafactory that they currently use costs $1B. the tiny factories that Xpeng uses costs $300M only. Nio makes their own powertrains and batteries at their own factories. The factory used for assembly is a joint venture which they have a stake in, that factory alone will be able to produce 300,000 vehicles per year as soon as Q4 next year. Until there is demand to exceed that number it would be pointless to build your own factory. NIO has a moat, Xpeng and Li have no moat. BaaS makes Nio cars very attractive from a value perspective. BaaS is key, and so far Xpeng and Li don't have true BaaS.
you can eat my ass too if you want to
They‚Äôre not worth more because people don‚Äôt believe the rally so they‚Äôre not willing to pay super premium. It‚Äôs almost like downside risk because it‚Äôs longer from expiration so there‚Äôs a chance nio goes down

And I would not exercise.  Really that‚Äôs just for show for you to look at a nice cost basis. But other than that you get no benefit in fact you lose the $6k of premium on your options (based on your math of 70k option value minus 64k net profit on shares. 

I would sell when you think you‚Äôve reached max profit (now might be a good time cuz premium decays faster in the last 45 days generally) and buy as many shares as you want with your newfound cash

You lose the cool looking cost basis but if it‚Äôs going to $100 then a $50 cost basis still looks cool

I mean I see what you're saying but the information that person brought up in their post is already public.

Furthermore, attempting to convince others that a position may be profitable due to an impending short squeeze, can hardly be argued as stock manipulation. They are simply explaining what would be required for a short squeeze to be triggered in the case of GME - with an example to demonstrate that if 'x' number of people bought 'y' number of shares each, a short squeeze *could* be triggered.
Called TDA just now and made a post. This will not prevent the shares being lent out. Only in a cash account will the shares not be lent out.
People betting on a shitty obsolete Blockbuster-esque company hoping for some lucky short squeeze within the next couple months instead of betting on a company with huge future potential that will weaponize all the data that governments and corporations have collected on citizens the past decade to further control their lives and make them consume.

Hyped about SEARS! I'm so excited I need to stock up on lube!!!!üí¶üí¶üí¶
This. 01/21 2022 leap holder here already up 220%. It was 320% before Shitron started manipulating the price.

This thing is way too volatile to try timing. Plus the spreads are beyond ridiculous. One bad attempt can cut your holdings by 30% if you try to get back in.

Just hold. There will be an insane amount of volatility with this one. 

One thing I see holding PLTR back is adding new revenue. Sales lead times are very long in government and with all the hype, revenue targets are going to be raised too much by analysts. PLTR is the long game. Think buying Tesla in 2011 if you could have. That‚Äôs where we are.
People have been shorting millions of shares since it was sub $5. Months and months of paying borrow rates trying not to capitulate at $10-$15+. Eventually shit comes to a head I guess
It kinda seems like squeeze has been happening slowly all year, no?

Anyone invested in shares or leaps from basically any point this year until now is up huge. And if you are in that position and come on here to hype the squeeze and sell FDs to ü§° WSBers, you‚Äôd be doing even better...

GME is likely to dump on earnings in December.

This is completely untrue. As others mentioned, you must request a certificate of your stock in order to be in possession and keep them from being borrowed. Most brokers do not do this because the make a percentage for the transaction. Otherwise, with a fully funded account you can collect these interest rates/rebates yourself. Your broker is the holder of your position and reserves the right to loan your shares at any given time. This is written in your brokerage agreement and if not readily available you can give them a call.

Setting a high limit order gives the clearing firm or third party that your broker may or may be under contract with the ability to see where your position will possibly be sold and gives them the opportunity to continually sell and buy back, some times hundreds of times in a matter of minutes, your position. With high frequency trading this often happens from algorithms or a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù.

tbh i love wsb but this gme short squeeze thing is kinda hard to wrap my head around.  

doesn‚Äôt really make sense because it assumes MM/otherside of trade needs to gamma hedge but what if they decide its just smoke and doesn‚Äôt care? Or they dump on you and take profits.  

pls ELI5

I think you're significantly undervaluing what the DoD can pay once you're on a Program of Record. Yes Palantir could compete in the consumer space with their tech and they likely will. Getting on to something like a program of record though is a huge defensive moat - they take at least 5 years of contract winning and lobbying and then they secure 5-20 years of $1b's of spending on products/services that get set aside in future budgets. Getting them is difficult but once you're on one your revenue becomes as secure as treasury bonds. Also being on a program of record makes it easier to get on more and they can now partner with other companies that want exposure to the DoD but can't get through FedRAMP and PoR. The DoD will not spend significant amounts of money on private sector companies unless they go through this process. Look at how much Elon complains about what SpaceX had to go through and that's just for NASA. It's a terrible system and it's why you see so few DoD startups but it makes the winners filthy rich.

&#x200B;

Combine all that with a software business with typical high margins \[\~80%\] (unlike all the traditional hardware defense contractors) and I'm not sure if you can come up with a better business to make more money.
I think this comment has a negative impact on quality. I expect it removed by automod.
hold until the financial report if they show future potential growth their stock will rise.
I called TDA. Setting a limit sell order does not prevent the brokerage from lending the shares. Only a cash account will prevent this.

Basically people are freaking out about nothing, BABA, nio, xpev etc are fine. This only matters if companies dont wanna cooperate. Baba has already pledged to cooperate. Only chinese state owned companies might be in a bit of trouble. But even those have 3 years before they need to decide.
Remindme! 1 year
If you sell 27 contracts you'll have a little more than your initial investment back so you literal can't lose. But I know you won't do that lol
Alright you degenerates, maybe one of you can help me figure this out. 

I‚Äôm jacked to this tits in NIO calls expiring 1/15 with various strike prices (7, 13, 14), 16 contracts.

I did the math and these calls are currently worth 64, 704. 

1600 shares are worth 86,400. It would cost me 21,700 to exercise the contracts. This equals 64,700 net profit currently if i exercised. 

Why are my options not worth more since they are still more than 1 month out? Thanks. 

Also what would you autists do? I genuinely think this company will see 200 in the next few years which is why im exercising.
Only on WSB do people wish that Monday will come sooner than later. It‚Äôs like living in an alternate reality here

Nah, it's all about the double-down now. Literally a situation where the first one to pull out loses. The more they hype it the better, they just need to understand that when they buy in they're buying in for a year, not a week.

0 positions in GME myself, but I'll cheer from the sidelines if they do squeeze the cucks.

Well the ‚Äúinsider trading‚Äù in particular shouldn‚Äôt bother PLTR gang much. 

This company went to direct listing instead of flashy IPO so employees who had long-standing company shares the opportunity to cash out. It‚Äôs not indicative of how the employees view the company they work for.  

In an interview regarding the sell off after the partial lockdown ending the Palantir rep said as much, the employees had been very patient and earned the shares and their right to enjoy the payout.

This would be a good start.
percentage growth just shows they were doing very bad previously, im more interested in nio reaching 100,000 deliveries or more for 2021. xpeng only has one model that is selling and will be getting competition from nio's sedans soon.

Buying GME at open just so we fuck the shorts

Fuck Bears
Why dont you dab a little in Krypto...?
I agree with the analysis. The environment surrounding GME *could* lead to a short squeeze. However nothing had systematically changed at GME over the last few weeks, the hype that this is something we should expect in the ST is misleading. Fundamentally I‚Äôm not bullish on GME LT and holding a position to bet on a short squeeze that could take a year + to happen doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
I remember that post. I always wondered what that dude did with all his oil.

Btw KOLD is short on natural gas. If you think natural gas is going up then you want BOIL.

But uhh yeah they keep saying that Gold has been beaten down too much and is due to pop "any day" now. When will this happen? Will it go down more? I honestly don't know. I keep hearing that banks are buying or will be buying Gold up and the price is expected to go over $2k next year. Tbh, I know nothing of the gold market. It all makes sense, but it could get worse before it gets better. Maybe you could go really long on this position, but idk.

Great DD. Got into RVLV back in July. Was annoyed when it tanked in late September but I held strong. 

I think it's poised for a very strong run over the next 6 months. I think it will get to 27 by EOY and 32+ by the spring. 

There's also the chance it pulls an SFIX or FTCH and runs up into the 40s or 50s, which I'm very hopeful for, but 30+ by February would still make me happy. 

What are your price targets??
shares or 2021 calls for GME. don‚Äôt waste money with weeklies.

Well I think GME might go low 20s before reality that it is a 20th century company staying afloat in a 21st century world. Selling games for $75 and then buying them back for $1.50 to resell them for $25 was really genius in the 1900s. But a really dumb idea in 2020 and beyond.

Lol. Same
Maybe they're not doing anything because there's not much of a precedent for a single online forum of retards manipulating stocks? Idk I guess the dot-com trade forums were similar but maybe it's also because the sec is underfunded and there's honestly way worse shit happening. This is also a fucking pittance compared to the wealth people hoard and manipulate so it's probably just not that big of a deal. 

 PLTR 30-40c 12/18.
KBIO squeezed 10,000%, just sayin
This short squeeze is going to be hilarious.
Same as when a hockey team pulls a goalie.  Ain‚Äôt nothing bro.
People have been expecting this shit for several, several months and "the signs are always there" despite short interest being so high for so long, there have been some pretty  positive events that caused GME to moon but it still never short squeezes. Like their partnership with Microsoft. The only thing coming right now is earnings and do you really want to play GME earnings? Think they're making money? ü§°

With that said I do own 400 shares

A few other "non-core" but still important principles

6. Momentum for a trader is comparable to an investor's "fundamentals" -- riding the momentum wave can be very lucrative if you're disciplined with your entries / exits

7. Remove emotions from trades and don't "marry" any of your bets

8. Wealth is built through concentration, not diversification. If the trade checks all of your boxes, make a very big bet

9. Do **not** make too many trades. Be disciplined and selective. Preservation of capital is rule #1. The more trades you make, the greater the chance for you to blow up / make bad trades.

Look at this dudes post history about NIO üòÇ
improving margins, increased demand, a show of demand for their 2 new sedans due to roll out in coming years; nio house unveil for denmark and norway, demand in europe; robotaxis for 2022 made for intel by nio; announcing they are going to build a factory would make it pop $10 to $20 alone. crossing $80 by jan 2022 is pretty likely

Buying the stock works better if you have the cash. If you buy up enough options though and the price rises enough they‚Äôll buy the underlying. So it‚Äôs kind of a way to get your MM to throw some weight behind you.  It‚Äôs what SoftBank did to the nasdaq in august and September.

Y'all need to be careful with this GME sHoRt iNtErEsT oVeR 100% stuff. That's been the narrative for the past 2-3 months. GME has popped off multiple times since then and fallen back down.

Remember NKLA rode the EV wave along with XPEV, LI, NIO etc. The EV hype has lost a bit of steam now and NKLA followed. We all know Trevor is gonna dump out a majority of his stake come Tuesday. Just pray the GM doesnt actually announce the deal before then (which I see no incentive for them to do anyway).
You also have to realize that Peter Thiel has absolutely not a single fucking moral. That is good for a company like this. He will fuck everyone including your wife's boyfriend so that he can profit so he can stand behind the length of Hulk Hogan's massive cock and needlessly try and eradicate any company that has bad press of him. All that's enough to fucking YOLO into PLTR.

Looking for ideas. Last one was ETSY 140c, which I dumped on Friday.

The ETSY one was a no brainer to me because it became ridiculously oversold when the vaccine pumps started killing Covid stocks. I try to look for solid companies that have been pushed down too far because of a market overreaction. See ZM below $400, SQ at $155, etc.

Other way is trying to identify a shift in market trends as soon as it happens and jumping on board. Most recent example is the obsession with EVs and green energy. Then you have your rising stars/memes if you can identify them early enough -- CRSR and PLTR, hop on board and ride some of the gains, but don't get too greedy with it.

I'm a little unsure right now. I don't know what the next trend is exactly. I think the EV/green energy shit is losing steam and we've seen many of stocks stop mooning constantly. The market has also been showing periodic rotations to oil stocks, financials, and "covid recovery" stocks, but those are tricky to time because they'll have huge spikes and then trail off a bit before having another big pump.

Yes, QRD

- More shares short than exist

- Ryan Cohen is a baller who ONLY goes all in (he got $2B for selling Chewy, the madman put $1B in AAPL and $1B in Wells Fargo)

- people camping outside gamestop for two days during a pandemic during November to get those consoles lol

- market cap only $1B ‚Äì big room to grow based on current revenues

- online sales up 800% year over year, now >20% total revenue - take that blockbuster

They state 4.9 APY on their capital (doesn‚Äôt say how, but they should just put it in shitcoin instead), and today‚Äôs daily payout is 12,720. So with some very retarded math they‚Äôve got nearly a million dollars on hand? Why are their donations goals at 30k/200-300k then?

EV sales will be bearish for oil companies, but big time bullish for pure natural gas plays.    The fastest and cleanest method for rapidly increase megawatts (charging EVs), is nat gas.

All my accounts are cash. I don't use margin. I realize there is interest collected in lending shares and that's what I take issue with. Since it's fully my share they shouldn't be able to lend it and collect interest on it. But you raise a good point, maybe they can't in a cash acct and I am simply mistaken.

One random example of the kind of stuff us actual retards would never know to show the kind of things that only a few short months ago were common topics on here. A guy was just bitching about the pains of having gone through the school of hard knocks to get to stable trading level. mentioned getting himself into options in low volume, illiquid markets and couldn‚Äôt get out of his position. 

I was like, oh shit. I bought an option like 3 months out for a small company I had worked with as a consultant. I liked their management and just wanted to have a little piece of vested interest in their success. That company probably has no volume. Sure enough, checked and it was like 80K shares a day. My option was about $.80 in the money so I decided to cut bait...or try. I had to drop my ask a Nickel a time down to $.50 above strike to get an algo to pick the damn thing up. Only lost $30, but it could have been a lot worse if I hadn‚Äôt seen guy talking about issues with that. (could have just waited and exercised option I suppose, but stock was $90 and did not want to sell everything to free up $9K over a $30 kick in the dick lesson) just one example.

There are thousand of those little tid bits that are, at least for now, gone and drowned in ‚Äúyolo donkey stonkie palantir.‚Äù It‚Äôs always been like that - god with a whole year of Tesla shit that still hasn‚Äôt stopped -  but it‚Äôs no longer in good fun as a bit. These dumb shits are for real.

You have to assess risk. Is the risk macro level (all travel stocks fuked over COVID) or company specific (FSLY shitting the bed in its latest earnings). I stay away from macro level risk. If it's micro level, you have to try your best to understand if the market has over-reacted (BABA's recent lows at $259, FSLY when it went down to like $60 or whatever it was at).

> so can Tesla adopt replaceable batteries if they're proven successful by  NIO except the market will already be made ready for it by NIO 

Ain't gonna happen any time soon. Tesla tried replaceables and gave up on them (safety issues). Not to mention tesla and nio use completely different types of batteries. But what they have in common is that both nio and tesla have their battery housing integrated deeply into the body which in case with the replaceables will require redesigning the whole thing. Ain't gonna happen anytime soon, since tesla is already up for their gen3 mass-produced vehicles for the next two years.

But fair points.
What kind of work?
it's either that he saw himself on live tv.
Pretty sure they buy the number of shares based on the delta of the call you purchased from them. So if the delta was .02 they bought 2 shares not 100.
$40 XOM calls 1/15 sell when bond rates hit .94,         
$23 Gold calls 1/15 sell when gold gets to $28-30 but if you‚Äôre buying the stock hold it for a couple years. Wait a couple years after Yellen becomes Treasury Sec to sell.
Sounds good, good luck, keeps those returns coming!
Perhaps, but I'll probably YOLO into Sears instead.

How do you differentiate a stock that's in a dip vs. a beat up stock?
Better ones like...?
Ill go with you. I need to cash out anyway and take a break and enjoy these tendies and go on an adventure and clear my mind. I‚Äôve summitted the highest point in Thailand, climbed the worlds largest boiling lake in the Caribbean, and traversed through the mountains of Dahlonega. When do you wanna go?
Monday night s the best day of the week Friday is the worst!
I‚Äôm still crying about the 1932 Emu war
QS up 60% since opening.  Going to scoop up Jan $45 Calls on Monday.
Dash n go is the new pump n dump.
tl;dr a bunch of PLTR people with underwater contracts are pissed the attention is moving elsewhere and ruining *their* attempts to pump
I‚Äôd be willing to buy if it came down to 3.60 again, until then I‚Äôll wait if a solid break about $7 or a return to 3.60
that wouldn't do anything
just wait till you try the CASHews.
You think that‚Äôs out there, try onion futures.
upvote my comment if u actually buying more GME on Monday, im too hyped for this shit

At 80 she can bring a friend

I want a stress filled life where I‚Äôm wearing expensive button up shirts and being irritated by my too hot for me girlfriend cuz I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs making millions a year who tf does she think she is voicing her opinion? Is that so much to ask?
but they did! up up and away!!
Interstellar
Probs grab one call not spending over 1k tho
Scalp. If you‚Äôre messing with options hold that shit for like 15 min. Take your 5-10% wins, rinse/repeat. If you‚Äôre holding weeklies overnight that‚Äôs a 100% roulette spin
We‚Äôre you able to roll the cc to next week? The premiums were mad high!

A really nice house is less than 200k where I live lol
Look what happened to SPI a couple months ago

Went up 1200% in a single day

There‚Äôs no way PLTR is getting short squeezed tho

Yes

You‚Äôre ok either way.
Sell OTM weekly puts.  12/4 26P premium is 1000, break even is 16.  If you were planning on buying in Monday and get assigned, you pick up a .44 discount per share on current market price.  If you don‚Äôt get assigned you have an extra 4K to buy in next Monday.  Only way it can go tits up is if GME moons past 26 by next Monday, and you still want to buy, which you can mitigate by buying calls and rolling profits into shares.
Why aren't more people downvoting this cuck? Everyone knows you don't encourage mods like they're real people.
smart move PLTR will go brrr too

U mean gme?
7 stonks @ 13.53 is my position.

Gonna orbit the MOON if I am right.
It really does help your mental well-being. I used to be a delivery dude for pizza. I hated getting stiffed on a delivery. I try to help out any gig workers I can with a dope tip now that I have a better job.
I thought citron was the car company and I thought y‚Äôall was dumb as fuck for worrying about it üò≠üò≠üò≠
if baba dips u can bet your ass im buying more calls. currently holding 9 atm
So you are telling me you are NOT going to be buying more PLTR on Monday?
I'm a newly minted retard, what's an IV crush?
It'll usually always take a slight dump after open before going back up.
you would think this sub would be clamoring over OpenDoor because of the crazy rise of home buying since march but no
the gentlemen - netflix
The safer bet although IV is starting make things pricey
Happily. If anyone wants to short GME, go right ahead. Step in front of that freight train.
Everyone starts somewhere and some of us have to throw everything we got even if it‚Äôs practically nothing at any opportunity we can.
7 stonks @ 13.53 is my position.

Pretty legit usually
See my response below to a similar question:

Over the summer: CCL, XOM, anything in the travel / leisure sector, retail, Macys etc. Don‚Äôt buy stocks that are down 60%+ just because they seem cheap. They are cheap for a reason. Even if they trade flat, your investment in them will have an opportunity cost that you are paying by missing other winners.
The hyper modern Wyckoff pattern.
Shit I sold 228 shares Friday to fund my PLTR rocket
GME when it was $5
Not RH. (It‚Äôs Fidelity)
Just started trading November 23rd. Was doing pretty good until I found this sub and went full retard
There will be a dip
Good stuff. Looking out for the little guys
Market cap is too small and is too easy to manipulate
That just means MM who sold those puts will happily destroy them. Thank god i bought spy calls when it dipped below 363.
Lol.
A limit sell order, right?

But for what amount? I've seen people talking anything from $100-1000 

I gather this is because they may not catch the squeeze in time because they aren't looking at the market all day, but since I WFH I'm looking at it constantly so is a limit sell order necessary in my situation?
[removed]
Invest in themes and think about the long term if you can.

I believed in electric cars since I saw the film Who Killed the Electric Car in 2006.

Knew about Tesla since 2007.

Bought 5 days after the IPO. Never sold.

Of course PLTR can go to 100, it will just take time.
Some of us aren't complete retards. I have been following palantir since July and waited for it's IPO. Always knew I was going to buy several hundred shares (can't afford more, I'm poor) and always knew I'd hold for long term. I never expected the crazy meme nature behind it but people are underestimating how much palantirs climb isn't just hype. This is an excellently managed company by a group of brilliant entrepreneurs. Feels good to be early to the ballgame for once with tendies locked in.
Market cap too low. Under 1b is banned
I started with \~100k
Because they generally don't give a fuck. Happy people generally don't search for solutions to things they don't view as probblems.
You're not going to get any legitimate examples because short squeeze doesn't make sense in this context.
Bold of to assume they haven‚Äôt figured it out. It‚Äôs just corruption worse than mexico lol
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüìàüìàüìàüìà
Ban emojis and the phrase ‚Äúto the [stellar object]‚Äù.
Is anybody else here thinking about playing the DASH IPO? Looks like it‚Äôs got good meme potential.
Background checks to the FBI are up 70% this year. Coupled with the fact historically gun manufacturers do very well when a democrat wins.  I think 75 is conservative.

OLN, an ammo manufacturer, is another one I've been eyeing for calls
will be overweight from day 1
Not against either of these at all. It's just too irritating to have only a few stocks being pumped when there is even greater money to be made elsewhere. I also don't want my portfolio riding on one or two memes in case something blows up on us.

The other part is that people always think they found the next infinite tendie printer aka TSLA, but TSLA was truly special. Most of these meme rallies end with the early adopters making huge bank, while the last group of FOMOers often get crushed.
Going in for ~130 shares Monday AM depending on how much I can unload my FUV and NIO for at market open.
Ya, apparently some right wing vigilantes threatened some employees over it and got their asses arrested by the FBI, lol ... there are some fucking dumms out there
Jury is still out on what the stocks going to do Monday. I‚Äôm hoping for some horror stories from people who made their family members start a robinhood account on thanksgiving.

I am down voting any PLTR shit post I see,(all of them) feel free to join me.
Once the PLTards get burned after buying the top I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll learn a valuable lesson about thinking they could outsmart the market.  Just kidding, one of them will probably physically threaten Andrew Left and get this sub sued out of existence.

I understand what you are saying. I just believe it will carry a little longer and trend a little higher than usual. But mostly on the same page.
[deleted]
Because Citron ain‚Äôt shit and no one listens to them
Yeah the sub has noticeably declined in like the past week alone. Basically the sub lately just takes whatever stock moved the most in the past day or two and all the posts turn to pumping it. The contrarians are what make any investing sub great and increasingly there are none to be found here. 

If I wanted to hear yesterday‚Äôs hottest stock pumped as the next big thing I‚Äôd watch CNBC. Wsb needs a reboot
LEAPS can be very profitable with the right research. Way less risky than weeklies, nowhere near as fun lol

They're in debt billions to the IMF/China/other globalist orgs, the people are brainwashed and bigoted to shit, and the governments are mostly corrupt warlords who pocket all the tax revenue for themselves and friends and spend almost zero for the actual country and people

Shorts are shorting on GME to the tune of 297.13% of the float sold short.  I don' think one more short report is going to make much difference on this one.

I cried when he died irl.
Everyone talking about the PLTR Short Squeeze, Can you autists give me some more recent examples?  I am aware of CHK
They‚Äôve been talking about this mystical short squeeze for months and it didn‚Äôt happen. 

Don‚Äôt believe the retard hype. It‚Äôs like Quad witching all over again
If you are actually up $1m+ consider donating 5% to a food bank
Less than 1b market cap, a rule the mods have futilely created to prevent pump and dump schemes.

wrong, Nio has $3B in cash in their hand right now, it only cost $1B to build the megafactory that Nio uses, the small factories XPEV uses only cost like 300M or something, can't remember. they could literally build 10 of xpeng's factories with cash on hand. the current factory Nio uses is a joint venture called JAC NIO, so they do have some stake in it, unlike Fisker and Magna's relation. also JAC NIO has been producing high quality cars, Nio has been rated with best customer satisfaction and least complaints about quality from owners. Both Xpeng and Tesla that build their own cars have been riddle with quality issues.

Help me understand this. How did the PLTR short volume not skyrocket after the Citron report? It stayed consistent. 

Someone smart help me understand this but only if it tells me that PLTR is going to skyrocket on Monday.

The most sensible reply here, thank you!

What is the rationale behind waiting 45 min after open, just curious?
Sure! There are a lot of consequences: Socially, legally and financially. But in the end, it's just ethical prioritization. Human life values more than anything and anyone wo disagrees should readjust their moral compass. And to answer directly to your statements: Your way of handling is doing pretty much nothing to actively protect other people("let the rest of us roam free")? And to ask you again, do you think about how you yourself can help to reduce stress of others and to contribute to a healthy society?

Everything becomes a sport given enough time. Humans love teams even if it's arbitrary. There was a study a while ago where people were given teams it was something like red vs blue but were given no goal. For literally no reason they hated each other. Group bias think is probably the genetic basis for racism too. Some research shows babies are racist and have biases even before understanding human language. Humans love teams and categories.

i‚Äôll check it
About 600 shares
 Timing is impossible to figure out, you will never *know* when the bottom is. If a company is fundamentally sound and has good things going for it, buying during a down trend is ALWAYS better than buying during an upward trend. Buying during an upward trend can be good too but it will never be as good as during the down trend if we assume the stock is going to go up in the future. If you buy during the start of a down trend you might get 1% of the available dip on your side. If you buy halfway through you have 50% of the available dip, and if you buy at the exact bottom thats 100% of the available dip.

But you gotta let out your self importance by making a post a about PLTR to complain about posts about PLTR.

I guess I'd suggest to not get involved in a short options position, even if it's part of a spread, unless you have enough capital to exercise the long side of the spread.  If you follow that advice then you can hold up towards the end of the expiration day and then close the position.

Apparently options retain the right to exercise even if the underlying is halted, and the underlying can be halted right through closing, leaving you with the possibility of being assigned and not knowing it until it's too late: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/options/if-youre-caught-holding-halted-options-10186936

Note that this is limited to American-style equity options.  Index options and European-style options are an entirely different beast.
fr, yolo some profits but shit. 2x30% which is duable with you fucktards on 10k portfolio goes a long wayyyy for a youngin like me and prolly him. Absolutely no need for yoloing in expectation to get 3000%
Nickel and EV aren't having any influence on it, it's been behaving exactly as it always behaves.

I'm not talking about crashing down to $10 again or anything like that, it might at most dip to $12, but it's still going to dip. For a slow moving stock like this with small price actions though that's a pretty big hit to take over a 60 day period.
Thanks for responding
I would thank him for the opportunity to buy more cheaper

$30-$40 based on technicals alone. $100-1000 if it squeezes. Also, revenue for the console cycle won‚Äôt reflect on December‚Äôs earnings, it‚Äôll reflect in March‚Äôs earnings. This is at least a 3-5 month hold. But the upside is enormous if it squeezes.

because the outlook on the company failing hit a wall 18months ago when they brought in a new ceo. thing is, the banks flew right over that wall and are still expecting it to fail thats why its so incredibly shorted. confidence is extremely high since end of summer when a big money investor basically said hes going to take gamestop and turn it into a ecommerce monster, which he is already responsible for doing in another market sector. combined with the positive outlook on a new console cycle and a hybrid reimagining of a business plan that transforms what they are now into what they need to be to survive going forward......and you no longer have a failing company.

The proof will be comparing the times between when SS2 SN02 (Unity) and SN03 enter commercial service. I suspect it'll be much faster! Then SN04 should come online some time after that. At that point we'll have three data points to compare with. Colglazier has put the promise out there of 400 flights per year per Spaceport, so that production rate will have to increase!

They take advantage of people who don‚Äôt know any better. 

TL;DR if you need to ask Reddit for stock advice the. You are better off keeping your money in a HSA at your bank.
They're counting on retail to both not have the capital to force a squeeze and/or lose patience and move on to another stock.

Best buy came off a high. Gme is coming off lows. Gme already has same day delivery and likely better margins and attach rate (not 100% sure on gross margins). The the biggest thing is current share price relative to ATH. Gamestop trades at 0.1 p/s, what's best buy at?

It's not a block of cheddar.  The entire aroma pop of shaving the truffle was lost in front of the chef, and the flavor is just a smash in your mouth.  Maybe you'd do this with some inferior black truffle, but white?  Amateur hour. Slices aren't a visual choice, its the best balance of aroma and flavor delivered to the patron and as you eat the plate the truffle flavor builds and builds.  Maybe spend some of that money visiting Piedmont and learning something.

So: 
look for....
Where does the option sit on da option chain? 
ITM: Slowish
ATM: Probably changes fast 
OTM: Probably slow 
Now- on a certain day- you know it as expiration date but whiz kids like me know it as X day- these changes speed up. Why you ask? I don‚Äôt know but check the Gamma for an idea of how fast the delta will change. 
Maybe a total newb could think of gamma as the stability of the position. Low gamma would be stable. 
High gamma would be unstable.

I‚Äôm in ICLN as well, which already gives you PLUG exposure but it‚Äôs definitely one of its strongest holdings. ICLN doesn‚Äôt give you much wind exposure so I might recommend FAN too. TAN, also highly solar, is basically a more risky ICLN (at current price) but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that either, and QCLN is your highest risk highest reward clean ETF.

I think we‚Äôre going to see a couple very green weeks December/early Jan for all of these but ICLN is my pick. You could individual companies but it‚Äôs soooo much riskier higher IV to do options on them. Not to mention hundreds of times more research and work to maintain such positions. It‚Äôs all basically speculative and political anyways, none of the reactions to earnings make sense so I just let the ETF take care of that

Edit: cuz I actually don‚Äôt fully understand it
MrZackMorris is a good one for NIO type of plays.
ya maybe if you got in @ 32
Yes they are. Dumb fuck WS HFM think they can use bots for reports and go off that. You think these fucks are scrolling on WSB?

Shhh the palantir fanboys will come for you

is this the dude who's gonna eat shit?
No news regarding the starting price.
But in the same month we should have 3 important IPOs so, pretty sure I will get in at least 1 with good price
What not to do? Don‚Äôt do what this sub does. Inverse wsb
I know GME will probably have a short squeeze, but I feel really uncomfortable buying into a company that I know will be bankrupt in a couple of years.
Can confirm. Would usually spend around 800-1000 per week just doing random shit
Do not invest into the garbage RBLX IPO, look out for $SEARS BIG MONEY.
First thing Monday morning, hate selling on Friday‚Äôs

Theta doesn‚Äôt do anything if you don‚Äôt hold over night! Made a killing last week using my three day trades on Amazon
Can you draw lines on the graph to show how this is bullish
If 800 is alot of money to you, then no but if it isnt then yes.
780s expiring 12/4?

I wish I could post a chart of my portfolio for the last 2 years.. dead nuts..

From yolos and pot stocks....
to selling premium, accumulating shares of actual established and successful businesses, buying options for protection, with a healthy sprinkle of gut feeling large option buys.
I dont think classic boomer is able to short anything. People shorting also read wsb.
Ill eat your own shit if this shit goes to 500
You're forgetting the increased alcohol ( and other substances ) consumption that come with having to cope with captivity.
Uhh so when did you start shorting because it closed the highest it has been in 2 years on Friday....
The bullish DD on $BBY that was hilariously wrong has me thinking maybe that.

Also Zoom has no practical purpose in a post-pandemic world.  When it crashes....it will be spectacular.

PLTR is a shit company though. Everyone of you are buying into false hype. This stock is going to shit on all of you. Save yourselves before its to late. Itll be a penny stock by the end of first quarter of 2021.

I told my friend about PLTR and he went and bought 0dte calls on friday.

I dont think we're friends anymore.
Best part is no one can articulate why it‚Äôs a buy. Must be the lack of social skills.
If only I knew how to read.
Cuz they are boomers. Get with it bud
I blew up my account by putting more than $5k in ATVI earnings calls a while back when this sub was extremely hyped about it and dd was everywhere. Proceeded to get wiped off the face of the earth along with half the sub at the time. Calls were down 90% or more in the morning. Just now recovering and back in the game, but it makes me extremely hesistant on memeboy plays like PLTR because it‚Äôs the same euphoria.

Am I to late? I got buying power but I dont want to chase!!!! :(
solo is pure speculation though, it's a total gamble with much better alternatives that can be imported any day once the trade war ends. i probably would have exited at 20% just like you if i was ballsy enough to go all in on something like SOLO that don't really have much vehicles if any on the road yet... SOLO and FSR are both very risky gambles that may end in bankruptcy one day.
How long will this $5/week pattern continue?
Lol if it goes to 500 i will unironically eat my own shit that is the dumbest thing ive ever heard
Selling contracts is literally the other side of buying them and on average you break even as a buyer and seller under the Black-Scholes model. You're so wrong that I have to think you don't understand how options work.

burning through $250 million a month and three consecutive quarters where its losses exceeded $1 billion. Even if it does return to a more normal cruise schedule next year, analysts suspect it will be several years before it's operating at pre-pandemic levels.
GME might have a squeeze next week, some shorts will start covering and hype is blowing up, then it‚Äôll come crashing down after earnings = WSB paper handing, then moon mission confirmed

Nope, Tesla is just too ahead of the game
Biden will be big on clean energy
Doesnt work the same way on options and its possible the dump post squeeze could come AH.

Plus, its not weird for there to be substantial dips during short squeezes. It would suck to get exited out early. The above method involves just riding out the calls through big dips because you've already locked in plenty of profit.

If that happens you can roll them. Buy them back at a loss, sell with an extra week for a few bucks higher.

Not that I‚Äôd be mad with 300% returns in a month either.
How should the GME short squeeze happen if all the www and wsb is talking about the percentage of shorts, the cycle/catalyst and buys like crazy - why would anyone that is short still hold position instead of getting out? Its basically said everywhere?!
Hmm, maybe it‚Äôs the 97% revenue growth or the fact 70% of kids aged 8-12 play the game.

Thanks to AvePoint that data can now be pushed to their cloud, allowing a data analysis company like Snowflake or Databricks to use it and gain insights to help the business.

The received and CRL from the FDA in regards to their NDA for Libervant. It was not a rejection but it is generally not a great thing.
9/25/2020
[CRL]https://investors.aquestive.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aquestive-therapeutics-receives-complete-response-letter-fda)
10/2020
AQST submits meeting package for FDA review. Meeting scheduled for November.
11/12/2020
Type A meeting with the FDA took place.
11/18/2020
Results of Type A meeting announced.
[Type A Meeting Results](https://investors.aquestive.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aquestive-therapeutics-completes-fda-type-meeting-libervant)

In preliminary comments provided by the FDA prior to the Type A meeting and again at the Type A meeting held on November 12, 2020, the FDA confirmed that the issues identified in the CRL may be addressed by utilizing modeling and simulations based upon the information provided by Aquestive in its FDA meeting package submitted in October 2020. The FDA requested in its preliminary comments that Aquestive confirm that Libervant is linear across the potential dosage levels. Aquestive believes that this information is available based on previously conducted studies and will include this information in its upcoming resubmission of the New Drug Application (NDA) for Libervant. The FDA also recommended a follow-up meeting to review the final modeling and simulations, as well as the totality of safety information, prior to resubmission. Aquestive plans on scheduling this follow-up meeting with the FDA prior to resubmission.

Based on the FDA‚Äôs preliminary comments and the discussion with the FDA during the Type A meeting, Aquestive continues to believe that no additional clinical studies will be required for the resubmission of the NDA for Libervant. Aquestive will work to prepare the analysis requested and schedule the follow-up meeting with the FDA as soon as is practical. The Company expects to resubmit the NDA for Libervant as soon as possible after the follow-up meeting, which has yet to be scheduled.


It is my belief that the FDA will say their is no need for further meetings and
that AQST can resubmit their NDA next month as long as they can prove that the dosage levels are linear.

The company is currently valued at $237M.

AQST-108 is the thing that will make this company worth alot of money eventually. It was granted fast-track designation by the FDA. Those results should be announced within the next couple months.

Also, they won a case regarding some IP infringement.
Whats the name of the game? "Lets make money". AND how do we play. "Buy more PLTR"
Yeah, week stocks rally because people are dumb and everyone buys calls. People remember that the Republicans have the Senate and the bill fails... your calls go to shit
Haha very true. A year ago I would have laughed at anyone saying GME was the safest bet out of any comparison. Now its basically the safest high return investment

[removed]
what is ur avg
[deleted]
Will go all in with on both (selling all my other positions to do it).

Here‚Äôs my DD

$DASH- I think the biggest thing they have going for them was the supply side increase that the pandemic created. More than just consumers turning to delivery, almost all restaurants finally caved in. Regardless of the virus-free future of indoor dining, these restaurants got a sweet taste of what it means to sell meals without having patrons using expensive real estate, so they are not going to turn away from it. Consumers may retract a bit, but millions of new users signed up for it, something that would‚Äôve taken several years to accomplish and doordash can now milk.

$ABNB- read the S1. They stopped all marketing and still got 80% of last years volume, IN A PANDEMIC. Their user base is extremely loyal (most of their guests are acquired without spend).

Both of these may face regulation. I don‚Äôt care too much about it, they had faced it in the past, and every large tech company that IPOs has this issue.

Both of these are good potential meme stocks, especially Airbnb (young user base and that is loyal to their brand and identify with the new form of travel)

Both of these have easy to understand and MASSIVE potential markets (restaurants and travel) that they barely made a scratch so it‚Äôs easy for investors to value them at 10x IPO price given.
Due for a dip in December though, don't buy on this high.

The mods fucking banned me for posting that $VALE is up 40% and there‚Äôs 100k call options on 1/15 and 1/8.


‚ÄúNot vale again‚Äù was the reason against calling out super low premiums, unusual option activity, and large upward trends. 

This is the kind of shit that‚Äôs going to get WSB shutdown in the long term. Mods holding positions and trying to shut down opposing information.
And hasn't turned a profit in 17 years. It was considered well valued in the early teens and has since doubled. GME is an epic turnaround story with a super low valuation. Best of luck though!
We can‚Äôt just make decisions based on our personal experience. We need to also look at the data. 
Based on what you said we would assume Doordash and Uber esta are declining in users. But the data shows that they are both creating more users year over year. 
It is true that prices for delivery are higher but you underestimate how lazy people are. They‚Äôre willing to spend $5 to stay home instead. 
I don‚Äôt just go off of personal experience. I look at data as well to make sure my emotions are aligned with reality. 
The truth is you don‚Äôt have to like a company to invest in it. I sure as hell don‚Äôt like Uber but they have made me some money in the past. 
Amazon is terrible to their employees yet people have become millionaires investing in that company.

defo so it, its very low rn. Most people on here dont do DD, they just saw ‚Äûoop,no more green. red bad‚Äú Its just a normal dip in a uptrend. Also PLTR resisted pretty well even tho the citron short etcetc. Also other than most shit stonks PLTR actually has values and is not just a bubble. They had some good news come out since market close so this is going only up from here. Buy shares, not calls. See your money double until EOY

Selling cash secured puts is fine as long as you put enough room between the price and strike.  I sold a bunch of Dec 11 20$ PLTR puts last week that should expire worthless, but if the price keeps dropping I can  always roll my option to a lower strike.  However, if it somehow does indeed drop to 20$, I wouldn't mind picking it up at that price.

The point is to do it on stocks you don't mind owning.  I would hardly categorize it as picking up pennies in front of a train unless you're doing straight up naked calls/puts.
Sell $250k worth and take the hit on tax. Let the rest ride out. I believe NIO will shoot higher especially with how long dated your calls are, but you're RETARDED if you don't take some profit. 

At least put $250k into S&P500 if not your bank.

It's legitimately fucking annoying. And it's even more annoying because if you ask people to stop incessantly talking about PLTR, the response is always "SoMeOnE MiSsEd tHe rAlLy lMaO" as if they are clever af. And as if someone can only dislike WSB going to shit if they are poor.

I made solid gains on PLTR, and I also legitimately never want to hear about it again.
Someone with money pay for a cameo addressing all the WSB autist to unite this Monday morning, buying atleast 15 shares of GME. This will be insane. The power of this group is unmatched and unparalleled. The world has never seen so much influence coming from one specific subreddit

Shitty posts attract shitty comments.  Removing shitty comments is not going to fix a shitty post.

I have also found that this sub dislikes meaningful comments.  If a solid DD goes against the popular opinion, everyone dog piles on the downvote button.  People have stopped offering meaningful advice as a result.

Ok the way that i see it, is if NIO can get gassed to a 50$ price range, PLTR can get gassed based on the fact that they actually provide more value to society (allegedly) when fully scaled, vs nio who will still have competitors in the field will have to start to rely more and more on branding. 

Side note it's interesting that PLTR does not wanna operate in china, for this reason i think the proximity to the us govt will def increase its value as they know that state secrets will remain state secrets.

The only downsides i see to PLTR are the pr ones, or if there is a data breach of some sort, but since they already worked w the govt they probably have good infrastructure in regard to security.

Alright you autists, you‚Äôve convinced me. I‚Äôm gonna throw 50k into GME shares at market open on Monday. Ive seen lots of posts saying how we might get to 500 if this thing squeezes but that seems farfetched to me. For the more conservative people who are in GME, what is a REALISTIC SP that I can aim for to sell my shares? I know if you all say 500 ill never sell and be left bagholding because it ain‚Äôt going to 500. 50-150 seems more realistic to me. I welcome all input, jabs, and insults.
I would prefer it on a helmet.

Hell I bought a $70 PLTR FD on Tuesday worth over $1100 Friday. Clean energy is where we‚Äôre headed next I think, maybe after PLTR, GME and before Roblox. ticker scrape data says it‚Äôs quickly on the rise here on WSB, 4chan biz & twitter
Is this actually subliminal messaging for Roblox IPO? Good question.
Thanks
I still feel uneasy about GME.
Damn that's fucking brutal.
Yes you still own the rights to the warrant. I wouldn't worry about Microvast and the SPAC not coming to an agreement. These companies are MADE to bring companies public with hype. They have so much INCENTIVE to get this deal approved. Everyone knows how hot the market is for EV companies and this one already has 100m+ revenue and government contracts up the ass.
Why these people will buy hundreds of something instead of just 1 when they are learning I will never understand. 

I used to feel bad but now I view it as just natural selection and free money for us.

When I started I never bought more than 1 share or option until I figured it out.

Why is a brokerage allowed to lend shares you own to someone else to short. This indirectly hurts you as a share holder, and at the very least if you do choose to lend your share, shouldn't you be given at least some of the interest incurred? What am I missing?

I think NNDM is an easy buy low sell high situation, I dont think OP is saying to buy now, he references the upcoming dip and that‚Äôd be a very good time to get in on this, and it‚Äôs a pretty safe bet to buy the dip for a short or long term play imo. I chalk up the 800% decrease to the fact that it‚Äôs an overhyped industry that retail thought would be a good move when 3D printing was first being introduced. However, it is still a very valid industry and NNDM seems to be a leader in it with a decent head and investors backing them up. Low risk high reward imo

Go in at like $20, maybe 30.  50 is a little high.  Buy a couple as lotto tickets.  Don't get over your skis.
Only vehicles which have body-on-frame are trucks and truck-based SUVs. There are zero cars that are body-on-frame. The trucks that are body-on-frame are just a steel frame, and have components built on-top or attached to it. This has the components built INTO it.  


For example, every other car has a HVAC system with all the ductwork, blend door, blower and etc built into the dash. This is now built into the skateboard, freeing up a lot of space inside the vehicle. This is why it's a Class 1 vehicle in size with a Class 2 cargo volume.

No it isn‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre buying you should be buying because you‚Äôre confident it‚Äôs going to go up. If you aren‚Äôt confident it‚Äôs going to go up you shouldn‚Äôt be buying. 


Every day you have a 50/50 chance of a stock going up or down. If you decide to buy a set amount at the same time every week over x weeks you have an equal chance of paying more or less than you would have if you just made a single purchase for the full position. Although if you did your research and went into the position well informed you should have a greater chance of it going up thus costing you more and reducing your profits with each subsequent purchase.

If you manage to save money with a DCA it‚Äôs because you picked a ticker that has lost value since your initial purchase and you‚Äôve already lost money and are still putting more into it. Did someone say ‚Äúthank you sir may I have another?‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôm confused about this stock market thing but I try to cut a position that loses money over time not add to it.
The short interest is actually insane, it‚Äôs legit.

Is WSB secretly planning to all buy GME on Monday?
And they'll be back with their "Drill Team Six ready for action!!!" Thanks but no thanks i'll pass
This is pretty cool
Yeah I mean other than put holders, if you‚Äôre not smart enough to add after a crash there‚Äôs nothing more to say.
I have multiple positions, most of them are now long term holdings but I still rip small chunks into short term burners.

For instance I saw they opened new strikes on Friday morning, so I kept refreshing at open until I saw the prices for them go live and I bought in. I then instantly put in a sell order for 35% over my purchase price. It filled 7 minutes later.

There are sooooo many ways to play this, had I been on the ball I would have also played a 20x 0DTE but I was too tired at the time. I will not miss that chance next time.
When I have nothing to stress about for 2 days it stresses me
Curious who your team is.
Only $3 for a Skynet mask? Take my money.
He dare defile the transport to thine heavens!! Blasphemy!
You‚Äôre correct, bought about 2 weeks ago, up 75% roughly 10k. I‚Äôll hold until Tuesday, market red, I‚Äôll sell, market green I‚Äôll hold. Won‚Äôt loose money regardless
I will issue a Fatwa against this blasphemy

Yeah, when ACB dumps back to like 7 or so, buy the 10C Jan 21. IF (big if) the Georgia runoffs surprise everyone, the whole sector is going to blast off even harder than Biden's election win. It's absolutely worth the gamble in my opinion.

Yeah, and I totally understand how hard it can be to mod this stuff. I just hope that this stops before too long before too many people think it is okay and just increases the amount of the low effort posts. At least with secondary popular ticker posts like GME and others have at least a shred of useful info in them. I hope that the rocket emojis stay on PLTR and don't spread to every other ticker. 

Might have to eventually consider banning emojis in post titles and phrases like 'to the moon' since those are pump and dump hallmarks.

Although it's kinda fun being super horny, maybe I should try to bust a nut before reaching the 12 day mark in the future(got a fantastic workout today though).

Look at a graph, most of the time the economy spends hitting ATHs.
They had $200 million direct offering planned. So far they've done one for $50 mil and another for $100 mil. They have another one for $50 mil coming. Im also in on NNDM. They can print multilayer circuit boards in under a day whereas the competition takes multiple days to weeks. I wanted in with 5k shares at $3 but all my money was tied up in NIO. Now I'm only holding 100 shares. Was waiting for it to dip back to $3 but it's steadily climbing.
I have no part of this stock so the only one to blame is yourself!
We are in the "infinite growth era". 
2014-2015 was the "hot ipo era" where a shitty companies like gopro was trading for 90 and shake shack and chipotle were trading for insane amounts. Yea we might be in a bubble but i dont see it ending for a yr or two min when all these ev and fintech companies fizzle out and there is a clear dominant player in the industry. I think for the next 6-12 months this gonna be the meta.

They would just have to comply with US audit rules and would have 3 years to comply. BABA has already said they would comply. If it does dip at all it would be a good buying opportunity.

He‚Äôs not putting his career on these random outlooks he‚Äôs just talking about stocks and saying where he‚Äôs got a good feeling or if they‚Äôre under/overvalued whatever. 

People love to say he sucks but for instance he randomly said ‚ÄúI think ulta could run another 20-30points‚Äù after the target news and guess what it did just that. Also had corsair and lemonade on recently and they both did great after the show. He‚Äôs great at exposing different companies and sectors and giving a quick opinion then you make your own bets.

Lovely write-up mate
Pay the PMI and use the money to invest. You just need to clear more than you pay in PMI. After a few years PMI goes away. Do a 30 year not a 15. Same reason.
Congrats on locking in the gains. Were these shares, or calls that required selling before expiring? 

I ask because I own 5,400 shares at $15, so if you sold shares because you know something I don't, then please advise. I also already own a Tesla Model 3, otherwise I probably would have done what you did too. You'll love it!

I turned 100k into 1.4mm since March without buying options. If I can just do that again I‚Äôll happily retire with 20mm.
I would bet all the money I have, all or nothing for only +50% gain that you absolutely cant do that
Does the stock have the potential in the near future? Yes.

Is the options frenzy and 100 eow trumpets getting outlandish? Also yes.

1/15 20, 25c. 2/18? 30c. And started 200 shares to my forever portfolio.
Sounds good. I don't play options myself but i don't see any reason why it shouldn't reach at least 45$ in 6 months time.
If you're scared being rich will ruin your life, stay away.  
If you don't want relatives asking you for money, stay away.
I hear you. Usually these trends don't last this long, or dominate as hard, but PLTR is certainly a special case.

No doubt this will come to a head soon. It simply cannot continue growing at 175%+ per month. When it starts to go flat, people will move on. In fact, you saw a lot of that already on Friday. 

My bet is by Wednesday - Friday of next week, you'll be seeing 1-2 top level posts about PLTR at most.
I actually still got lost
Calls or shares
If there‚Äôs one thing you should know about your short time here so far it‚Äôs that it is a uniquely euphoric hype period. I wasn‚Äôt around for the dotcom euphoria but if you cant imagine stonks going down right now, that should be a sign that a market you aren‚Äôt supposed to beat as a retail investor is on easy mode

SPY 370 11/30s because fuck this guy
Most autists look at their own feet when they talk to you.

Cramer is exceptionally outgoing - he looks at your feet when he talks to you.  Solid guy.  I trust anyone that stares at my feet when I talk to them.  I know...that they know...that my foot is going up their ass if they're lying to me.  They've studied my foot extensively.  They don't want it up their ass.  I know that they know this.
Im waiting for SEARS
difficulty in timing is the biggest problem, meaning shares or 6 to 12 mo out for calls is the higher probability play
If you had to set a limit sell for a potential GME squeeze, what would you set it at? $500 seems way too high for me as well, but I'm thinking of setting a limit sell @ $60 in the case of a squeeze. Thoughts?
he's got the spirit though
The only reason I can think to not invest is if you don't like money.
But we hitting 69 friday bruh
APHA is more diversified, recently bought a large brewery and has pathways for distribution across NA. Idk about acb but I‚Äôve seen other people here say they‚Äôre retarded. I‚Äôm also retarded though so do your DD
YESSS PLTR WOW
What price did you buy the option at ? Also what was GME at when you bought it ? Looking to get into the 12c's for 04/21 too, but wondering if it is too late already. Many thanks.
I've been seeing swings from 115% to 130+ over the last few months. The recent institutional shorting is what's been really adding volume. I wish there was a clearer picture to the block movement.
True but put to call ratio on spy is high af rn. Not sure if MMs will let that many bears eat.

Perhaps.   I fear the inverse WSB effect and the lemming nature of this board.
Lol no.

They're not going to go all in.   They're barely considering going half in.

Even if they did, they don't have a chance.    I paid Tesla $10k for software.   They've got nothing on the horizon to compare to that.
I thought it was Sunday. Fuck. I was so excited to see my gains on Monday.
Short citron research
I am referring to nvax, mrna, bntx. prices since feb.
That‚Äôs grim man. I don‚Äôt wanna think about that
yeah for sure--that's my take on their expectations too. My ONLY fear is I'm being brought into an oversaturated demand for loans that will dry up within the next year or so, which could result in *lots* of lay offs

Someone mentioned it to me before the Xbox news and I FOMO‚Äôed some calls after that pump and lost a bit. It‚Äôs hard to bring myself into doing that again. Still like the price of the shares for a long but not sure what the catalyst is on monthlies right now, or am I missing something?

Yes lol then when they're pregnant you fake your death
I sold a covered call which would be deep ITM right now. I bought it back at a higher premium than I sold it for because I want to keep the stock which is starting to moon. I'm still in the red because I bought the APHA long ago at a kind of high price.
LOL. Epic.
And before that we blamed it all on the Tesla nerds

Okay I'm seeing too much positive shit for GME, what're some reasons not to invest? Is this short squeeze bs?
Nothing

Simply send money to my cash app and u will have PLTR
17c 12/4 just to have for Monday, maybe Tuesday. If profit is good, then I'll snag some shares and 1/15 calls just in case it takes a little time for the squeeze to start. If the squeeze starts early then I'll churn OTM weeklies as it goes up for maximum gains.
do i sell these pltr calls for gme calls ? man this is so hard
I expect things to cool off this week (looking at you, IWM). Possibly into week after as well. 

After that, markets will be driven through the roof by vaccine approval and first doses.

Looking into it. As you can tell by 2/3 of the choices i laid out I kind of want to dip my dick into these spacs.
Over the past year has the market ever been reasonable? Everything gets to pump until there is no where left to go but down. If you look at the market charts for the past two decades we are riding an exponential pump like no other! And people think the world is in debt and financial ruin. I can tell you right now, none of those people own PLTR.

Guys, don't forget, buy some goddamn SHARES too when you buy your calls. Keep the underlying price up!!!!
I mean you it's only 140k and has two other 3bdrm units in a decent neighborhood. Don't see where I could go wrong.

Should just save for 20% but I'm young and dumb and think I could just refinance after 20% to get rid of PMI
Assuming this isn't the worst troll job ever. Open a brokerage account. Fund it. Buy shares.
 ''stay mad that you missed the china pump train, despite it still being stopped at the station for all to jump on ''

I literally have calls and 50 shares. im just mad i didnt wait to buy the dip next week.

Big Short for sure. Revenant is just Leo getting hypothermia for an Oscar
have the bears fully capitulated ?
look at how well PFE did between summer and after they made the world's biggest vaccine announcement.  vaccine plays are best made in leisure and travel not the pharma side
That‚Äôs retarded.
I'm holding shares at originially 17, now im at 26 average after putting in more.This dip was ineviatable and is ok. CRSR had no place being at 51 this early.

My assumption is we tread the 30-40 zone for a while now and then slowly climb back to the 50 zone. Earnings in March 3rd may be a catalyst for a break towards 60+
Love the rockets towards the end
Salesforce wont buy Slack, they simply dont have enough money to buy it
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt tell anyone about your gains. Here‚Äôs another quote for you.

‚ÄúGreedy men were always greedy, generous men were always generous‚Äù
Otm weeklies 20-25c
>all we need is a change in business model to trigger the squeeze.

They have the wrong real estate for this. Gamestop is a boutique store people run in to buy games for their kids during errands. Newbury Comics is an experience store in high-traffic malls.

GME has the wrong business model, the wrong real estate, and nothing proprietary.

This well-timed next-gen console release is the last crutch keeping this company afloat. There will soon be zero reason to make a special strip-mall trip to these stores because everything they sell will be transacted digitally.
I meant toy scissors!

Holding long term seems pretty viable. I pussied out on the IPO and it proved me wrong 7 weeks later. I can see CRSR becoming a very valuable stock in the next 12 months. I'd go as far to say, Calls aren't even risky at this point. CRCS to the moon bby

My car had the same issue. It‚Äôs a leak from the drain tube from your sunroof. The tube got mildew and would clog up and end up in my driver side floor mat. Took it to my dealership and they replaced the tube. Tried doing it myself but the screws to get to it were way too small.

I have puts, there's no way this deal will be worth 23 billion.
If you think that gives more ammunition for Ackman to acquire Stripe, your mistaken. PTSH raised \~$4B. Stripe's latest funding round was at a $36B valuation, and they are now talking about raising a new round at a $100B valuation. At those valuations, the PTSH SPAC would only own 4% of the the shares. Not going to happen

I lost $4k because of the PLTR and CRSR dip Friday, it hurt because I was only up 5k or 23% overall lol. Back down to 6% overall.
Because all we need is more PLTR or GME post....
My less complicated answer is Total Equity (305,200) - total return (285,200) = initial (20,000)
One thing about WSB that will never change; when a stock takes off and there's nothing but memes about that stock, posts like yours follow. The cycle will continue. Look for the gaps in between. üòâ
Ok good not bad.

I'd seen people quote short interest from the previous month and they dont know it but they're kinda retarded
Why do I have a feeling that GME can easily go tits up. Hope im wrong though.

Yeah not really. At most *some* retail trims their positions, but once they see the lack of a -10% drop at open, they're gonna hold. Institutional investments aren't gonna pull because they actually read the article.

I think new highs, imo. they've re-tested IPO prices like 3 times. sounds like it depends heavily on what interest rates do. also, they have quite literally a million companies under their umbrella-- 40b MC sounds like a wicked under-evaluation.

Agreed regarding the level of the CEOs you mention, web dev plus some fancy search engine and graph traversals is 10 levels below our dear Musk.

I also recognize the need to have someone provide functionality such that if someone runs over my brother and the plate is captured to be able to alert as many cooperative agencies as possible to be on the lookout for that plate. What I don't want is to have all license plates captured forever so 10 years in the future someone can recount that I was at Mcdonalds on this date and time. Unfortunately satisfying the first scenario makes it defacto possible to solve the second scenario.

I think one thing people are missing here in the comparisons is that VW had a really really low percentage of shares available (around 1%) for buying after porsche jumped in because of ownership from other institutions.

I'm curious to know how much is left for trading for GME. I'm seeing the average volume is enough to cover shorts after 2 days but that doesn't say much about what is left.

In a sense, yes. You will see severe logarithmic growth due to scale and what likely would happen is the SPY would break up.  It is very unlikely to occur though because it's 500 companies and so the idea that they will all do well is pretty rough since it naturally trades probably below NAV like close index funds do.

no it means that if GME goes back to its 2013 market cap, we get $100/share instead of $50/share

\~$50/share right now is more achievable than what people think because all it takes is a 3 billion market cap, not 6 billion.

Emotions. You have to not be emotional about the money because you will make mistakes. You most certainly will make shitty calls. You cannot avoid that. And if you have your uncle's cash he's going to want it back; they didn't give it to you for you to "spend" as a lesson.
So your saying this is not a pvp game? Instead of hp bars, we have Tendies. 

Of course some are gonna lose money. Its the nature of gambling.
Puts on that guy. He ded.
That article is clickbait.   Whatever the manhattan project pltr is working on is, it isn't assassinating people with drones w/ ai.   Early in the pandemic, there were videos from

china of drones telling people to social distance and monitoring there comings and goings.

I assume, and i have no idea really, that the ai will integrate contact tracing, virus levels monitored in sewers, vaccine transport and logistics just for starters.

It will also be integral in monitoring the public temperature and tolerance for whatever "dark winter" will be in reality and virtually.  So the company will become a cash cow but it will be hard to manage some of its public relations possibly.  They may come out of the pandemic with a much better image or worse.  Most likely it will depend on who you ask.

palawhat?
And then what?
Good lord the laziness is at an all time deficit. Low effort is extinct... it is now no effort posting. Zero fucking effort.

I got a better idea, just give someone else your money and have them invest it for you since you can't be bothered with googling definitions.

RC could buy GME after earnings, but like, that situation would be very confusing. I‚Äôm thinking it will squeeze to an extent after that, but it depends what longs do. If a lot of Longs recall shares to vote, it will squeeze since all those shorts would have to cover, could be a liquidity crisis for shorts, but that‚Äôs only if enough longs recall and dont sell right after the tender offer is announced. But, new shorts would enter the stock at insanely high prices and would not move, since they can just short it there, then cover when the price drops back to the acquisition price after it‚Äôs completed
üò°
Ricardo is in your bed.
Problem with talking about a squeeze is now that's the expectation.  It's the only thing being talked about. That's a problem.

We need to keep GME pure potential play.  The moon is the limit.  Pile into GME and this thing will be 25 by 12/4, guaranteed.  So much potential, they're basically a start up at this point and just need to monetize.
Imagine this much shitposting about one stock over 1 week, except the same amount over 2 years.

headline: that's what I just laughed at you for
You're correct that they are a bit overzealous about the company *but* the company does do some very important things and likely will be, due to the funding poured into it, expanding from the IPO. Still I have to admit that I don't think anyone actually knows why it caught on so much. It just ... did. Any explanations are usually past-perfect 20/20 types because there are a lot of the stocks that went up way more and no one cared.

Even when repositioning and losing 70 percent per trade eventually a string of losses is going to cut into your profits and capital.  However putting 20 percent of profits this strategy would work. 100 percent of profits is to high for it to work properly.  Check out both of those money management strategies from people who have run the numbers and get a better idea of the risks.

I don't have an issue with any particular ticker being mentioned, but when the same ticker is literally in 30+ posts, which all but 2 or 3 containing content worth anything at all then that is when that ticker needs to be managed. 

Posts with no DD, gain/loss porn, or nothing but emojis should result in temporary or permanent bans. The rocket emojis and fuck the bears posts are burying everything else.
$CCL or $NCLH. Also, the guy below us is right - LEAPS are at least 9 months out. You don't have to use \[month\]/\[day\]/\[year\] to describe your June options, because we know if you have June options they are in 2021.
Lol, good job on explaining how little you know about international companies that have had EVs either prototyped or released for decades.
This seems bearish actually. They y/y sales are supposed to be up more than 97%. And compared to their stock price run up.

it was hyped up early in the summer and has tripled since then and anyone that bought it and held then made bank.  i'd say the DD was good, the big question is whether or not there's more to squeeze yet

kind of hard to teach identifying a good stock. it's best for most to invest in index funds and actively managed funds like SOXX, BRK, ARKK. if you must choose your own stocks then it's good to learn options and how to use it to your benefit in different situations instead of just using it for gambling like the so-called FD's...

I have plenty of cruise LEAPS expiring Jan 2022, at least 30% OTM. With the current vaccine outlook I think we can expect most cruises to be back in full force by late Summer 2021. At that point, cruises would just have to get back to over 60% their 2019 value for these things to print big...I also commented earlier about the FDA approval (or non-approval) for the Pfizer vaccine on Dec. 10th, which should alone give a 10%+ swing in either direction. What do you think?

Absolutely 100% keep it local! Be it food bank, shelter, community outreach, needle exchange, soup kitchen, etc... Keep it local. I guarantee there are dozens of them in your area that you never even knew existed.
Yes, Fidelity is a fine broker. I would recommend setting aside some money (maybe in its own account) that is earmarked for options trading. Once this money is set aside for options, assume it is gone, so only put an amount in that you are willing to lose. 

To start, don‚Äôt buy options that expire any time in the next 6 months and don‚Äôt buy an option with a strike price more than 5-10% out of the money. So if $ABCD is a company you like that trades at $100, keep your strike prices under $110 and your expiry dates June 2021 or later.

You also want to start out trading more established companies where the implied volatility won‚Äôt be crazy, bid-ask spreads will be reasonable, and there will be enough volume to get in and out of positions.

Your yolo is already incorrect. This flair is for someone DOING IT.

As in you should be posting proof of your purchase NOW.
Not talking about something that hasn't happened yet.

So ban.
When I say you stop at the first trade I don‚Äôt mean stop trading, I mean reposition and start the cycle over. Using your example, let‚Äôs say you initiated a 5k position at a 10% portfolio proportion, so a total starting account value of 50k ( 45k in excess after initiating the position). You Hit a string of trades and grow the position 105k, and then you lose, dropping the position to 30k. At this time, you reposition. Your account value is now 75k and you start over, allocating 7.5k to your next trade, up from the 5k you were originally able to... 

With these trade offs I doubt you even need to win more than 50% of trades to be profitable. Again, this is theory, but in theory it makes sense. I hope I cleared things up too, I don‚Äôt mean u lose once and stop trading. Lose once and start the sequence back at step 1

Misleading title.  Shit, I thought this was for 230k shares of GME and not $230k spent on GME shares.  Huge difference.  I was hard for a minute then when completely soft when I saw it was 17,000 shares and not 230,000 shares.  $230k spent on calls is risky.  $230k spent on shares is just normal bet and nothing to get excited over.

You retards do realize that for GME to infinity squeeze, there needs to be a massive unforeseen catalyst, right? When Volkswagen infinity squeezed in 2008, the catalyst was a newly disclosed majority stake that Porsche had taken. These 10% GME days aren‚Äôt going to cause a squeeze...need a MAJOR catalyst. If the Microsoft partnership didn‚Äôt cause a squeeze, not sure what will. Also, you realize that for the squeeze to actually work stockholders have to diamond hand on the stock pop so shorts can‚Äôt cover?
What time?

They're just stocks I'm seeing starting to get the twitter/wsb pump love and I'm trying to get in early
Well what can't be denied is the momentum WSB can influence. If you catch the wave at the right time it's easy money. Just as long as you don't end up bagholding.
i‚Äôve been trading it i don‚Äôt hold...profited around $14k this week by just swinging i just sell for profits and rebuy more contracts rinse/repeat

The risk being they don't find a merger in their allotted time (usually 2 years, dunno how old it is) and dissolve. Share holders get their money back, I mean depending where they bought, they'll get the $10 or whatever, but warrants will be useless

This sub is 100% pump and dump. Someone with a position in PLTR, someone not living in his mother's basement, is manipulating this to make some serious tendies.

I support this. For the last 5 months I've been buying meme stocks based on your blatant pump and dump schemes and simply placing stop losses at -5% each morning. When the stock starts to dump, I get away with top gains - 5%. It's like having access to Jordan Belfort's schemes without having to actually tie yourself to market manipulation. This is all public information. There is nothing illegal about it as long as you're just looking, observing, and buying. Whoever is using WSB as a market manipulation tool, keep it up and keep it obvious. I'd like at least another 5 years of 100%/year gains because this is absurd.

Which are those?
Index funds actually cannot get too expensive. What I mean by this is that their NAV is a combination of other catalysts, so for instance SPY has Amazon and 499 other complete and utter losers in it. The weight of those worthless companies keeps the price low. In a market that is clearly on fire it might go up but SPY will not be able to be 600 or something ridiculous, ever.

GME float is at 35% 

The short on the float is 292% 

That's quite the uphill battle. A battle only a meme stock has the ability to fight. Because it sure as shit won't be earnings.

They turned off all the filtering and other auto-mod shit just weeks ago. Now we already have retards complaining about it.
what they need to do is pump ICLN

If you really are in a tough spot, turn on Robinhood Gold for a free 30 day trial. Then turn on "Margin Account", and win back your family's money. It can only go tits up.
I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd love to see some real data about under what circumstances a call option triggers a certain response from the market.
If WSB can pump PLTR 16 billion market cap then imagine what they can do with GME
ya i needed to slow it down so you could see some numbers instead of it just kept rolling like a slot machine, and then i wanted to show the million dollar crossing from october to november lol
I‚Äôm in lets fuck some üêª
Anything to bring oil prices up super majors win.
GMEs not a play about screwing your fellow retards over. It‚Äôs about fucking the dumbfuck shorts over. That‚Äôs something we can all get behind since stocks only go up.
Holy shit. An actually intelligent reason to YOLO pltr!
Maybe. But its possible that tsla "investors" have bought 420B worth the stock from lowa in anticipation to sell into passive flows on highs, and if the passive flows are only 69B they might ultimately sell lover than their lovs. But who knows.
Quad witching aftermath got me hooked to browsing WSB

Can you short sell a share without borrowing it? 

Not trying to be a dickhead. Last I checked GME had 138% of *the float* short, which is still pretty substantial. 6 days to cover IIRC.
I don‚Äôt think you are fucked, but they are.

I hope you‚Äôre not Italian.
so GME gonna be down 20% on monday?
SNAP 51c 12/4 gonna print?
Alright since we're gonna be blindly mooning for the next foreseeable future (Biden Hug Pumps), help me add to my list of June 2021 leaps. Yes, every single leap will be at minimum 20% OTM.

Bruh! If by ICLN you mean GME, mad respek
Unless they have shorted it
Pros: it could go higher
Cons: it could decrease in value, it is going to shed extrinsic value as you get closer to expiration.

Hey, thanks for the info! This was 18 premarket Friday and then had a pullback. It‚Äôll reach 20s on Money most likely. Could end up over 30 in a few days.

You got any calls on at the moment?
I don‚Äôt know what any of that means

GME may squeeze but it‚Äôs utterly ridiculous to use the VW price movement in Oct ‚Äò08 as a comparison. The two situations are nothing alike. Maybe GME can hit $40-$50. Thats IF it squeezes at all, which is not a guarantee without investors finding a real incentive to buy and hold this stock long term.
You just want a reason to leave.

Warrants are like options - except they're handled through the company.  If you have a good broker, they'll take care of everything for you if you ask them to.

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you are using RH.  They don't let you trade public warrants.
Thats great timing, congrats on the trade. I always jump the gun and sell covered calls too early, not capturing nearly enough premium, sometimes only 40-50%.
Do you know how many MMs have short sold it banking an bankruptcy that will now no longer come?
Alright, what's your price target? I didn't see any positions you intended to take. I may have missed them.

Thanks buddy

That ruger position is interesting. Nice and bold!
And if we‚Äôd listened and thrown 10k at their position they‚Äôd still be right and we‚Äôd be doing coke
Here for 20k as well. Doing 75/25 shares/calls cause I'm a bitch.
It's the difference between theory and practice.  Even with a 70 percent win rate which is the best in the industry you're going to wind up with at least 6losing trades in a row.
As a simple example say you started with 5k and after a string if wins you're at 105k in your account the next trade you put 100k on and lose 70 percent you're down to a 35k account in 1 trade. I doubt most people would just stop trading and the psychological factor of losing that much in a single trade would lead to revenge trading or forcing trades.  If you took a second losing trade using only the 30k profit you'd lose another 21k assuming a 70 percent stop.  You're now down to a 14k account in 2 trades.
like I said it's different if you're in the 20's but I still wouldn't do it. but whatever you think works for you.
Would be awesome if it lasted a week! But I think anything 3 days or more is unlikely, only due to the amount of people who will be trying to lock in their profits on the way up.
So you are just saying just limit sell 500.
Yep.  

I played college football.  The toughest girl on the planet (or even a normal dude) would get absolutely fucked up on a normal kickoff had she actually had to take on a block or make a tackle.

This was PR.

>1. Any stock such as PLTR that is trending should be a pinned post and all comments regarding that can only be made in that post. Any new posts not worth adding valuable information about the same stock should be deleted.

Simply not enough stickied threads, as someone else mentioned. In addition, that's what the daily discussion is for.

In the past, we've had megathreads, and they actually do work pretty well, so it may be something to look into where we pause the DD stickying and add a megathreads, but that would have meant over a week of PLTR megathreads and some would see it as explicitly supporting the stock, so the drawbacks need to be recognized.

>2. Fellow retards must have at least 10-20 posts before they are allowed to post in WSB. This would prevent people from creating new accounts and spread misleading information.

I don't think any other sub has such a strict requirement, and this is something that would actually harm the quality of the sub imo as it would be much easier for a bad actor to submit 10-20 posts in other subs before visiting as opposed to the average wsb user.

>3. Flairs must be respected and properly adhered to. If a post is flaired DD, the post must contain proper analysis of the original poster's position about the underlying.

Yes, agreed. We hand out a lot of bans on this from 1 day to permanent. 

>4. Posts that just say buy this and that should be removed. It violates your own WSB rules.

Sure, but how would you automatically catch these? Actually, maybe this is possible. Let me think on this.

>5. Personal gains/losses - create one stickied post where people can show off. Personally speaking, I have not had any losses through WSB but people showing off their thousand percent gains post after post is very harmful for many autists and retards here. 

For a lot of reasons mentioned in this thread, it's simply not a good idea to consolidate them.

>Sorry about offending fellow members here. It is okay if many of you do not agree with things here and are liking the way how this subreddit is going. 

We're on WSB, we have thick skin. The moderators have received feedback like this since the sub was created nearly a decade ago. 

>My intention to write about all this was to encourage everyone to use this subreddit as an important resource in making their investment or gambling decisions and if we can eliminate some stuff as I rambled about above, I believe we can all help each other more productively.

Feel free to send me a PM or send a message to modmail with any ideas you have! Remember the mods here are volunteering their free time to improve the sub, so we really do appreciate well thought out recommendations.

GME was never meant to make it this far...all the short sellers were hoping/praying it to have filed for bankruptcy last year or this year.  

If you believed a company was going bankrupt, you short it.

go all in. got it.
This sub is turning into StockTwits. Bot city.
So.... Did you buy those contracts tho.....
One thing I love about this sub is that people invest thousands of dollars based on what someone says on here, without ever double checking it. 

I'm here to save your dumbasses from this.

The bill, if passed, would give Chinese stocks **3 years** after it passes to get their accounting audited by the US. If, within those 3 years, they do not submit to an audit, they will be delisted. 

The worst case scenario in the immediate future for this is if China stocks, in retaliation, pull their stocks from US markets. 

Which they'll never do, because US investors make them a fuck load of money.
Just said that today to my friend üòÇ
I'm dumb. Can you explain when this is going to happen?
>True, but is palantir selling exactly what they‚Äôll sell in ten years?

Also imo PLTR a company ppl are gonna wanna hold so longer calls are more safe to me. Someone prolly know more about it than me though just minimizes risk more ig.

What software company?
There's only one way out of this jam. Less than a year ago our üåàüêª God Andrew Left brilliantly predicted Peloton shares would fall to $5 in 2020. I know they've only gone up since then to current levels over $100, but we still have a few weeks left of 2020 for this üåàüêª prophecy to come true. Buy Peloton puts and no doubt you'll make back your family's money in no time!
Realistically no. I still think you gave yourself enough time. The stock will recover. If NIO, TSLA, SHOP and so many others recovered and boomed after Citron Hit pieces then there is no way a company with the potential PLTR has will plummet. Institutional money still holding so will I. Data analytics and government contracts go together like pbnj. You got time man see how next week goes. What is the stock market without belief
Can't decide personally. But Stinkz only go up, right?

At this point, gme is getting pumped hard. We all know the citron strategy is to short then put out the hit piece. The galaxy brain move(if you are listening left) would be citron to go all in calls and shares and put out a positive piece on GME and it‚Äôs future. 

TLDR: GME to $1000, and citron is on our side this time.
Maybe I‚Äôm thinking about the NIO of summer when it went from like $6 -> $18 over a couple weeks. The recent NIO is pretty gay, I‚Äôll admit.

You mean the mods who tried to sell us off? Do you suck Jarteks cock for free too?
Bots pumping GME so hard is all the evidence I need to stay away.
400 contracts * avg cost of .50 = 200

Each contract is 100 shares so 200 * 100 = 20,000

Or 

400 contracts for 50 bucks a piece is 20,000
It‚Äôs been that high for years

That's a great place to be.  Most people unfortunately are much worse off long term.

I've been paying into a 403 for a long time now and while it won't ever cover my actual retirement needs it'll certainly help.  I'm only looking at working another 11 years max, 9 if we don't get a certain contract so that might explain why my thinking is bit different than yours.

Yeah i agree, and its even better since PLTR is a stock i dont mind taking assignment on. I like its prospects long trrm.
THIS ISNT PLTR, $DLET
I love Palantir as a company, and I was supportive of anyone buying them between $9-$16, but I think anyone getting in anywhere near $30 is in for a rude awakening. Only 20% of the shares are trading right now, and when the lockup ends people buying in high are going to get battered worse than Floyd Mayweather's wife.
Do we know *why* this has 130% short interest?
gee if only there wasn't an army of wsb retards posting DD if you search for it
No, having 75% of the posts about GameStop is legit. There are only like 4 or 5 other stocks out there.
Bankrupt? I'm surprised they're not more popular on this sub
Hmm nah the list might be endless then cause i'm sure other oil conglomerates could aslo be added then for any small EV effort. I did go through the list earlier but can't remember seeing a "suppliers" section? Might be useful to add Stocks of companies that supply Tesla, Nio etc. Like lithium mining companies (Piedmont) or Nickle miners. Up to you though. Nice work üëå
Im not reading this shit. Just go all in PLTR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Shit I remember making money on RCL 40c‚Äôs back in late spring.
You‚Äôve got time, but if I were you I‚Äôd sell those calls when palantir has its next 25% growth day
[deleted]
Tesla supply chain for ev components leaps above these other companies. Also as you said, the a.i tech is suppose to be very innovative. Not only that the branding for tesla is very strong. Id say when tesla stops innovating ( i.e apple) it is gonna start to loose its luster but until then i would say its solid.
so are 12/ and 12/11 calls fucked?? how low do we think palantir can drop?
Bruh Nio was cringe as fuck. People were thinking it would hit 100 and were buying weeklies
Tesla will likely issue a capital raise. The question is when and what price.
BAC apparently is short GME. Is it possible that BAC can see all the payment transactions and use that for their trading activities? That would obviously be an unfair market advantage, but perhaps the SEC doesn't count that as illegal. 

During the pandemic, if you are a bank, and you know what sectors are doing well, that's extremely valuable information.

nothing as long as he doesnt find out ;)
Selling 1/15/21 puts at $25 gives you almost $500 bucks. This is nearly 25% return on risk, which is rare for a naked put position.

Premium on PLTR is way too fucking high not to sell it
103% of outstanding shares are short? That doesn‚Äôt compute.
Fr tho is there any place you can ominvest if you are from eu-greece?

Still kinda new at this but since you‚Äôre talking about it...

If you have a 10c with a strike of 10.5 but the stock is now 20, so you‚Äôre deeper ITM even though you‚Äôre ‚ÄúOTM‚Äù...?? So the option price will only go up higher as long as the stock doesn‚Äôt start dipping even if it‚Äôs WELL above your strike

Welcome aboard! You have the 6th largest GME position on WSB I‚Äôve tracked so far, but that will change next week. 

I am all-in on GME and will add as much as I can next week.

Nobody likes not being able to be a retard and lose their money either.

here's an upvote
Nah. NIO is just like SPCE, TSLA, APT, and all those that came before. PLTR talk is actually cringe and annoying on a different scale.
No one is buying one share of an index fund, and most trade in fractional shares anyway.  I keep some money in a vanguard index fund as a savings account, and they do fractions down to 1/100, which makes reinvesting dividends easier I guess too.

Why is there so much short interest in the first place for GME, a company that goes up with console releases?
It‚Äôs a unicorn bro
Same. Might be flat short term, but I think it‚Äôs a good hold. I‚Äôve taken profits multiple times up until now, but bought back on Friday and will likely let it run long term.

Yup they have about 40k chargers installed... BUT I can't add Shell to the list. An Oil and Gas company, most of the revenue still comes from the fossils. NewMotion itself would have suited fine...  


I have intentionally left out also other carmakers that are making EVs but aren't focusing on EV only. Should I put another table down there with companies that are making moves towards EVs?

WHY AM I DEEPLY INVESTED IN GME??? Short squeeze. VW went from $200 a share to nearly $1000 a share on their short squeeze during a matter of DAYS in 2008. Look it up. It looks like it may happen to GME if enough people buy and hold shares.
GME short interest is 137%. Not saying I know anything but.... short squeeze may very well happen.
Let's all buy 100 shares of GME at open. Get this short squeeze going
Okay so if I bought 1k worth of GME calls for april and it hits $500 what kinda gains am I looking at

Thats not the short squeeze happening, but indicates MM's are looking to get out of their short positions. We'll know when the short squeeze was only after the fact, for all we know, it could've started on this latest run-up
We will see how jacked I am

Too expensive now.
The only risk I see is if you‚Äôre unable to cap losses to 70% or succumb to the psychological pressures that you highlighted
Sounds like you fucked your family
This says that buying options gives me the right to buy/sell. It then says that selling options obligates me to buy/sell.

Say I buy calls and they go up in value, and I don't want to exercise my right to purchase stock, can I sell that option to someone else? I think sell is used two different ways with options and that's what is confusing me.
It sprays over their balls like a piss sprinkler
I heard about it before IPO. Tried to get in early by buying mass amounts of SSSS calls for mid November expiry. They all went to 0. Bought more for December now they‚Äôre up 600% (18 DEC 12.5C). Also holding PLTR shares and calls (19 FEB 21 17.5C).
So wholesome this is the way
Do you happen to know what the short ratio was for VW back then?
And he stops hating him after, getting kicked in the face should make him hate karate kid even more lol.

People are realizing that AI is going to have to play a huge role in the future marketplace especially when companies are going to be competing over efficiency Palantir allows companies like Boeing to make more efficient and cost-effective repairs it also allows governments to better position troops in warfare or like this year vaccines in counties, The potential for this type of market place to explode which is basically just AI consulting the upside is massive and PTLR the only company so far to do it, not to mention it is an established company 18 years in the running it already has an established customer base and an established vision, it‚Äôs management knows how to run the company and run it successfully as they have for the past 18 years now with public support in their new IPO and the coronavirus accelerating the move from in store to online only increases the value ability of this company
true.  this is the meme shit i don't like to touch here.  seems like actual trash not just hype galore.
I‚Äôm glad this subs posts are something other than PLTR. I‚Äôve been bullish on GME since August. Bought 1k shares at 4$/ share and been holding since. Just took some profits and loaded up on 1k in options let‚Äôs goooo

Not reading all this shit. I saw PLTR tho, buying more calls
No guarantee. Pray that Ryan increases his stake.
That‚Äôs interesting :

Sure, you will eventually lose *profits*, but if you‚Äôre stopping at the first loss,and capped at a 70% loss, you should never fall far below what you originally put in. So there‚Äôs no such thing as a series of losses in this framework - you stop at the first loss. This is key. Pairing that with the fact that any sequence wins that you do have (2, 3 in a row) will make your account value go parabolic underscores why it makes sense from a risk/reward standpoint.  

That being said, if you‚Äôre on a bad streak and continually losing then this isn‚Äôt gonna help you, but it also won‚Äôt hurt you.

WSB is now a pump forum
If you get caught, send us a modmail and we'll help you out if it's truly good.

Our process isn't perfect, but it's get a huge amount of garbage that you don't see. Revealing what makes it tick will only make it ineffective.

Ticker banning process is simple. Anything below $1b gets autoremoved. There is some lag to this because the filter isn't updated constantly, but PLTR is $50B and did $6B in volume yesterday so we assume it's something that WSB can't pump and dump.

I don't have those moderator permissions, unfortunately. But I do agree that such a change would be helpful. Adding karma requirements (> X post karma and/or > X comment karma) can be helpful as well. 

But ultimately a lot of content moderation comes down to the users. Those karma thresholds I mentioned only work if crappy content is not getting upvoted. But beyond that, crappy content won't reach the front page if users downvote it in the first place.

I helped found /r/neoliberal and watched it grow from 200+ members to tens of thousands. The hard lesson that the mod team there learned is that once a subreddit becomes sufficiently large, cultural changes from the top-down become next to impossible. WSB is well beyond the threshold that the moderators here can have a substantial effect on the culture. A lot of it comes down to users policing their own, and influential users stepping up to post good content and set norms.

Well that's basically happening with PLTR right now, it's an obvious pump. Why do we care what people blow their money on? Gains and losses are all the same at the end
I'll probably add AQMS to the list. CLSK is a bit far from EV's though and more on the Solar/energy storage market. I might make a resource to check those some time too.

holy, fuck. buying another 100 shares Monday. brilliant.
It has a 20% (was 100% not long ago) short interest so people are banking on the short squeeze. Also console sales?

I'm not in it, but I'm guessing that's why people are all about it.
I'm going to keep trying to time the market with my IWM puts this week.

I've got 12/11 $177p's, which I'll dump on Dec 4 (Friday) regardless of price. I also have some 3/18 $150p's that I'm going to dump mid next week.

Plan then is to use the freed up funds to buy some OTM CCL 12/18 faggy dee's.

Hopefully I've have $40k left from my ill-advised puts for that retarded cruise ship play.

Its just a bunch of institutional investors cashing out at 40-50 who bought at IPO for 17-20 a share, because 200% gains are above their bullshit "risk tolerance" standards. 

They can lick my risk tolerance nuts though, corsair to the moon.
What about the number of shares short falling by roughly 3 million comparing Nov12 numbers and Shares short month prior Oct14 2020?
Jeeez dude is there still time?

Investopedia: ‚ÄúA short squeeze occurs when a stock or other asset jumps sharply higher, forcing traders who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to forestall even greater losses. Their scramble to buy only adds to the upward pressure on the stock's price.‚Äù
We already have 2 millionaires with their entire ports in GME. So they‚Äôve already made up for roughly 180k shares. Too lazy to do any more math than that.
@OP how much is ur PLTR portfolio?

Gonna buy GME shares and do my part by selling call to one of you autists
$40!
Not exactly. If the trend starts pulling upward, the shorts could decide to cut their loses and exit the position.

The Porsche situation was quite a bit different in that there was a direct catalyst to create the squeeze. If there is just a general upward trend of buying, it could be the catalyst all on its own.
Fuck, he‚Äôs good.
Ironic, because this comment was autoremoved.

You do know ToS has a summary that shows how much you've paid in commissions right? This is not hidden. Click on Account Statements and Account Summary at the bottom. Total Commissions & Fees YTD. 

Plus you can download every transaction you've made from the website and you can easily see how much you've been paying. 

Just cause you can't figure it out doesn't make it TDA's fault.

Because it's considered a pump and dump is why. Imo it's one of the best hedges against inflation, and it might not be a bad idea to have some for when the money printers circuits finally blow out and the brrrrrrrr stops, but that's just my two cents (also the balance of my robinhood account)
>a small amount of people need to suddenly buy or close the shorting positions. For the price to start going up. Then here is the best part. GME earnings are happening on the 8th of December. Two things can happen either they ace it and people start buying or they screw it up and the price goes down.

I bought my shares and set my sell limit.  gonna leave this one alone for a while now.
Imma short them by not brushing my teeth
I do ban quite a few users for evading the filter. Please PM me if you see any.

PLTR is like myspace. GME is facebook.
If that‚Äôs the case, the squeeze may well be underway and accelerating
I‚Äôm poor. I can probably only buy $1k worth of shares which would be around 60 shares if the price stays like this come Monday morning. Will this be enough to change my life at least a bit ?  Also would leap calls be worth it ?

Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior". The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value, and thus comprises the branch of philosophy called axiology.Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime.

I'm in agreement. There is a chance there might be a short term squeeze. But they'll keep disappointing earnings. They keep closing hundreds of more stores.  Digital copies have been the future and console sales are nowhere near enough to surprise earnings. 

I could be wrong though. It's 2020 and GME might have another meme run

There is no doubt that there are many people that only have mild symptoms. BUT there are also thousands and thousands of people who have more severe symptoms and many of them die. The fact that you don't want to help your fellow human beings and help to get everything under control is horrifying. In these times, one needs to be empathetic, just think of hospital staff for example, don't you want to help to relieve just a little bit of pressure?
just accepted a position at RKT, should i pad my paycheck with shares?

Many of the autists on here who are sensitive will think otherwise though
Soooo expensive.
I don‚Äôt think we drop at all this week. There‚Äôs gonna be tons of buying and not too much selling. Along with some shorts covering, out of both losing too much and the fact that earnings are near, obviously some will cover before then. Technicals are bullish. I think we drop pretty good after earnings
Weird flex repeating someone else's comment
The last 6 months?

Quiz: Chad buys a $10 ATM call on XYZ stock expiring in 2 months for $1.25. Assuming all greek variables remain constant, how much would Chads call be worth when XYZ stock goes up to $10.08. 

If you can't answer this question, you need to read more about the greeks and do some more practice on cheap stocks before making any expensive options plays. Practice and observe by buying some cheap calls on Ford or something to speed the learning curve, but don't go balls deep into options until you know what you're doing.

Thanks for taking the time to answer this. It really puts things in perspective and I understand this is not easy to do while juggling other important things in life. To your point about having more moderators to make this subreddit relevant, I am sure many good Redditors would be up for a challenge. 
Would it be hard to implement allowing posts from people who have 20-30+ posts? That would at least be a start towards better things and eliminate the throwaway accounts for pumping purposes?
Thanks again. All the best managing this.

ok lets be real for a second, MMs are probably going to try to create some panic at open to scare as much as possible and to exit some shorts at a lower price + we are sitting at a resistance zone around 16.5, so expect a drop, and that's when we enter. Of course if we blow past 17 in pre-market forget about everything I said, just FOMO at that point

In my experience Chinese commercial leaders will casually violate FCPA and finance leaders will take aggressive accounting positions varying from borderline to outright financial statement fraud.  I will not invest personally in Chinese businesses, but I won‚Äôt advise anyone else not to because growth potential is still massive.  My experience limited to my own Chinese colleagues at a large multinational, but enough to see how Chinese business culture operates and it ain‚Äôt for me.
Very interesting how gme comments are eclipsing pltr comments... that means its probably too late to jump in right?
Plus with how quickly a squeeze can occur, would one be able to exercise an option and be able to then sell the shares back fast enough?

don't forget that the number of outstanding shares have decreased from \~100m to \~65m. 

When GME was $16/share in the past, that was at a \~1.7 billion market cap. GME is barely 1 billion right now
That would be nice

What do you guys think spy will open at? It rejected 362 everyday for the past week the question is will it break the channel and blow past ATH.
They can redeem the warrants only if shares are trading at above $18/share for 20 days of a 30 day trading period. You get a 30 day notice they will be redeeming them.  They have the right to exercise on a ‚Äúcashless basis‚Äù or, you can choose to if you don‚Äôt have the cash to buy shares.  So, if shares are trading at $25 and you hold 100 warrants, $25x100 = $2500.  Then, you would subtract your cost basis for buying the shares at $11.50.  $11.50x100 = $1,150.  2500 value minus 1150 cost to cover shares = $1,350. So, they would take your warrants and give you $1,350. 

Warrants closed at $3.20 Friday, so 100 warrants would cost you $320. 

So, that would be $320 investment turned to $1,350, assuming they redeemed warrants while trading at $25.

maybe only tell her about half depending on her own situation. Some women it just makes them feel bad about their financial status, and like a failure. If they are in a good position in life or decent in terms of debt and savings then there's nothing wrong in letting her know you're financially stable, but yeah don't use it as a bargaining chip. let her know your full account size when you're both comfortable. of course i'm 36, so if we're talking about girls in their mid 20's it's different under 30 i definitely wouldn't divulge anything over 10 or 15k

Sell sell sell sell
Options require being able to make good entries and exits. If you aren't comfortable with general charting and watching for momentum moves without fomo then you id suggest you practice first. 

Charting previous key levels and trends and using info rods (i like to call them) to make entries is a must. 

Then, being able to control yourself on buying as you watch things break is a whole different monster. 

Good luck.

I hear yah.

I joined the mod team a few days ago after appealing to the mods to let me clean up the DD flair. I was reporting 5+ posts a day (and that was just the really egregious ones) so I just asked them to let me do it myself. 

But this shit isn't easy. During trading hours it is not unusual to have 30+ DDs in an hour, with 25+ of those needing to be removed. I have a full-time job, I can't be refreshing DD/new every five minutes. Handing out temp bans doesn't seem to work, there are just too many shitposters here.

The two issues as I see it are that 1) There are not enough active mods and 2) Users don't report content or they abuse the report button. The second one is important. Every fucking front page post here gets reported by people who are trigger happy or think they are funny, but actual shitposts with a DD flair (for example) don't get reported. Having to go through every post manually is a chore if we can't rely on the report function to be accurate. 

I wish there was an easy solution, but unfortunately, there isn't.

I believe this is similar to the Martingale money management system where you take bigger bets when you're on a winning streak and size down when you're on a listing streak.

Although i usually get the Martingale and anti-Martingale strategies confused because I don't follow either strategy. 

It can work as long as your wins are larger than your gains and your strategy has a greater than 50 percent win rate. Although the drawdowns would be ridiculous and most people psychologically wouldn't be able to handle it.

If you're putting in 100 percent of profits you will eventually lose most of it, even capped at 70 percent, you will have a series of losses that will drawdown a large portion of your wins.
When someone says ‚ÄúCash is King,‚Äù they are over 40 and probably don‚Äôt have/trust bank accounts or banks.

The more their shit predictions are wrong the less people will care what they have to say, or even inverse them. They profited already, but if its up 20% eod monday or tuesday people who left because of citron are never going to forget how dumb citron is and that will make it harder for them to do this shitty manipulation when their reputation is that they are wrong all the time.

Nvidia was changed to a buy in 2018 so they were not wrong. They bought the dip.

Oh yes we will! We're gonna turn Citron into Lemonade! Buy Buy Buy. PLTR to the moon!
^^
Facts
I‚Äôll get the right then
I‚Äôm actually getting kind of pumped to join the GME squeeze. I‚Äôm planning on putting 20K into the cause on Monday
yeah, I'm buying 100 shares on a ticket. Then I wanna sell options on those shares. Collect the premium, then buy more shares or options
If you need charity, there are places you can apply.
What? It will only go up so he doesn't really need to worry about things like that.
Oh yea does that make you feel good about yourself, downvoting everything, you fucking retard
Rumor is they‚Äôll announce it this week, which is why it started to go up on Friday. This is going to fly!
Is there a reason for that?

Good God, what's the size of the long position they're hedging??

Sir, this is a casino.
doesn't pltr also do data from internet companies? idrk tbh
You will pay capital gains tax on your 80k and then you will pay sales tax on your vehicle purchase
he's gonna say "hey motherfucker I saw that 80k in ur account that one time and you withdrew it all, that's capital gains! gimme like, 20%."

ICLN has been great for me if you're looking for a slow and steady sure thing. I've got some calls for January and April
Or just start doing push-ups every morning.  Its cheaper and more effective.
honestly. its the same for SPCE, \~50% of volume are short. but yes, we need to pump it up and squeeze the motherfuckers out and bleed them dry.
It is actually a solid company. If you think of their competition, say other consulting companies, they are not public and PLTR is more than a consulting company because they have a scalable software, just that a small team needs to go there for implementation. And they have many many top level contracts which other sweatshop consulting companies cannot even dream of applying for. $30-$40 is a fair price for this, AS A START. IMO it should be much more.
Just give me a brake baba, from the moment I owe that stock, its only bad news
If GME hits 400 I‚Äôm getting the wsb baby tatted on my left ass cheek
I want Mexican cocaine legalization this week
If I make quite a big gain on PLTR this week I‚Äôll probably buy my first pair of Air Jordan 1 for myself
Because if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll be cursed
pretty funny.

They were long nvda in November 2018 also. So their outlook changed.

Depends on the broker but usually they require some collateral to be tied up when you sell the option. The premium you get on the option is yours to do whatever with.

Sounds good man. As long as bitch ass andrew left doesnt mention our stock, moon mission should resume next week. These past few days was just profit taking after a 14 day run up
just look on the front page of WSB theres like 5 posts explaining it

Stonks to collect 100k in weekly premiums if you sellin covered calls?
Bought calls an hour before the pop. Checked my phone and was like whaaaaaat!?
The objective is maximizing your risk to reward ratio, and this should do so effectively. 

Do you still need to pick the right positions and apply proper risk management at the onset? Yes. I‚Äôm not saying that this is the key to tendie town, but I do think it‚Äôs one of the pieces to the key.

Anyways, fuck it, I‚Äôm incorporating this into my trading starting next week.

Only thing is PLTR from what I see is actually not a good company. Doesn't make money, draws ire from customers, lies and or misleads the public, and it's products help deliver dictator powers.

It's like buying stock in Death Star suppliers.

That dudes short squeeze DD has made its way to every stock forum and people are buying up gme like crazy. Why would short a stock who is already shorted enough to cause the squeeze that we‚Äôre anticipating?
>Yes I only bought shares, because I'm going to hold until GME is valued as a e-commerce company in 2 years.

Holy fuck, DO NOT DO THIS, YOU FUCKING ACTUAL RETARD. The entire point of the GME hype is not that there is genuine excitement about it transitioning to ecommerce. The hype is because of a SHORT. SQUEEZE. Meaning this shit is going to skyrocket and then *fall back down to Earth* as quickly as it went up. 

You will have a brief window of 30x returns before it crashes back down to reality and the stock will likely never be that high ever again. Please, with this amount of money invested, I'm begging you to spend literally just 5 minutes researching what a short squeeze is. When the price shoots up that high it's driven entirely by the fact that shorts need to cover, NOT based on even the most outlandish speculation possible. If you hold onto these shares for 2 years you will end up with like a 10% return at best, and potentially will lose everything because GME is a dogshit ass company headed toward bankruptcy. There's a reason why it's so heavily shorted right now, you fucking retard.

I swear, some people on here have a remarkable ability to take insanely profitable plays and ride them into a complete loss while screaming "DIAMOND HANDS!!!!!!!" the whole way. If you genuinely believe that GME will be worth more in 2 years than what it will be at the peak of the short squeeze within the next few months, then you need actual help and honestly someone should have power of attorney to manage your money for you before you ruin yourself.
Will definitely take your word, hell if it‚Äôs that good I might even tip
Say I hit a 10 bagger right now and make 80k from 8k. I then blow it all on a Porsche and have $50 dollars left in my bank account. What is the tax man gonna do
so what if I collect the premium and it's enough to buy another 100 shares, can I write options on those shares? and so on and so on
Pltr is stonk!
Yeah holding hundred shares i bought at dip last week
It‚Äôs fine our bb pltr needs a weekends rest
If Citron research do a report on GME it would be game over for all those cucks who have gone short
Yes
Supposedly
Worst case is hitting 32-33 before going back up.

Yeah I would buy some gte on Monday but i hate too much this fuckjng company and how they relate to clients.

Why not try to help trigger the squeeze?
I agree it'll be before March - with my positions I've been playing it thinking the lockup will end around the beginning of February.
It‚Äôs a spy company that sells to the CIA, their network is so expansive it will be used to distribute priority doses of the Covid vaccine to Americans.

People have been expecting a short squeeze for several months, you will probably lose that 5k. If you bought like 300 shares at least you could keep selling OTM covered calls to make your money back eventually if shit the bed

Those hurdles are being taken care of and they are certainly profitable right now. Management has done a great job executing their turn around plan. They are in fairly good shape at the minute. Cohen is pushing them to be even better or he will just do it himself.

I definitely could but it would depend on where PLTR opens. Because they require much less upfront capital and have the potential for much larger gains if they become ITM. They are also much riskier because you have to go further to be ITM. So lower strike calls are much more reliable.

I don‚Äôt think they EVER will. Google, the Amazon stack(looker+gbq), snowflake/tableau/altyrix, Litterally, DOMO, sisense, they are all arguably better at doing what palantir does and have been doing it for 1-2 decades. I don‚Äôt think Palantir‚Äôs goal is to move into the public sector, but rather just keep pace capability and performance wise while securing more and more ‚Äúpast performance‚Äù to keep driving gov contracts their way. The only scary part stock wise from palantir is that one year you could have 2B in gov contracts, while the next year maybe it‚Äôs a slow year for the gov and they only see 200M. They are at the mercy of the taxpayer and federal dollars. So that‚Äôs a big sketchy. But we are so very early in the government using data/big data that there isn‚Äôt much in terms of downside on the palantir front. For heavens sake they just spun up a sales team in the last 18 months. It‚Äôs my understanding that up until then these contracts got done from the C-suite alone. Like HOLY SHIT.
GME going to be short squeezed harder than Volkswagen in 2008.

What stocks do you guys like?  What's getting the most action from this sub right now?  And before you ask, no, I cannot read.
A ton of shorts have already covered. I can guarantee you that when we see a random green candle of 200k shares when all the other candles are 10-40k, that's someone covering. What's likely happening is that people are buying new short positions at a higher price keeping the overall short position high.

Also it's worth noticing that Scion Capital, aka Michael Burry, is already selling a large chunk of GME shares.
Did that guy really cause the drop single handedly?  I mean he Fucked my 12/4 probably beyond comeback if that‚Äôs so but surely there‚Äôs other factors at play.
Bought premarket Fri for $14.50 then it dropped, so I thought I was following the way. Now I just checked my account and it has popped to $15.27, so I realized it was the way.

What they don't understand is that all these shorts will come off without it even hitting $25.

Gonna print
retail doesn't move shit.
No way they were shorted at that high of a price and then NOT bought back. There were probably a ton of new shorts when the shares went from 6-14 and that's likely the price everyone has at the moment. You gotta remember that the vast majority of people that shorted it long ago when the price was higher aren't degenerates like us who hold until they have 3000% returns. They'll take a far smaller return like normal people.

No one cares about covid. I mean this as an objective fact. Masks only help somewhat. If everyone actually wanted to end this they would distance, mask, glove, face shield and stop touching one another. I've been working with people infected with covid since 4 months ago in hospitals as a military operation to keep hospital numbers down. Not a single god damn person in the hospital other than me is following protocols. I haven't touched another person other than my GF in months. I have tested negative around 16x. Basically the people being infected are the people who only bathe once every other day, the ones who touch the most and the social ones who go to parties every day. Old people have problems bathing every day, so they get it and die more easily on top of needing help via physical contact. The covid fatigue is also a huge problem. The waves exist due to the lack of caring. People would rather go out with a chance of dying every day than waste their entire young life inside. It doesn't help that doctors keep saying the masks and stuff would last 5 years in the minimum. At that point people just stop caring since it's so long term. People shouldn't have to destroy their own lives and jobs because lard asses who didn't exercise got asthma.

all you retards keep forgetting that the reason why VW share's jumped so high was because the amount that Porsche had was relatively unknown and it was only during the squeeze that it was realized how many shares weren't available. 

if you're talking about an infinity squeeze on GME, you're already too late.
Some would argue it should be at a $50 billion market cap.   Based on economies of scale and then running a fleet of spaceships out of New Mexico, Dubai and Italy.

Hey did you buy PLTR calls?
Im in and have been in GME for a fucking age.

My optimistic question, is **when this happens**, whats the best way to time the peak to get out?
[deleted]
Yup
you might be then only person who actually watched it
PLTR is just FOMO and price hunting. It hasn't settled into a price that people are comfortable with and since no one knows what that price is, they're just FOMO'ing like crazy. I have a feeling it will settle around $25 after dropping far below that.
Swipe left. Ahaha.

The implied volatility was a lot lower on Monday.

The calls you were short were always the ones you'd be assigned , the calls you were long would be the ones you exercised. Somebody else exercised the 22.5 calls , and RH should have exercised your 22 on your behalf, leading to somebody else entirely getting assigned at 22. 

You should contact them to make sure the 22 you were long can be exercised.

Everything goes up for 2 days as methed up citizens think they're killing it at trading. Day 3 of no sleep and people start hallucinating. Paranoid delusions make them sure a crash is coming. Softbank's CEO liquidates everything in a methed up paranoid frenzy. Crash below March lows.
Beautiful post OP. I‚Äôm in for 1000 shares with an average cost of $13.90. Gonna dump my PLTR on Monday and use those profits to buy more GME shares. I also have ten 30c expiring 4/16. See you fuckers on the moon. üöÄüöÄ

Not necessarily saying it's true, but the principles of both can be true. PLTR is looking at artificially inflated demand, GME will be a case of restricted supply.

That‚Äôs a really good arbitrage idea imma check it out
I feel like the market has been closed for a week, even though we had a baby friday day
Its up from 11 to 15/16, cmon now.
line on chart went up
Tesla did not go up 10,000%
Ban
lower your expectations
if you want to know for sure, call up your broker and ask them
Invest all in genius brands
That's exactly what I think.  Did you see the statistics on how much of the trading volume of PLTR was from individual investors and not institutional transactions?
Please remember to apply a cold compress to burn affected area. If you need assistance, we can have a prepared ointment bath for your misguided boomer ego. 

Analoghogdog ftw
Prob shares at first. Maybe even sell puts to shares if it works. Then will look to entering calls.
It will probably dip you can wait 1-2hours after open and buy the dip
12/4, maybe 12/11
Ask yourself, can you turn 10k into 100k (30k-ish for living expenses, 10k original investment which was loaned is put back into the bank for securities, 10k for profit taking, and 50k reinvested). If you can do that through stock market you can retire. Where the 10k come from? Working for one year rent free from your parents. Poor people buy stuff. Rich people invest.
Find a rich old man and suck his dick
So PLTR had it's most bullish options day ever Friday.... if u think there isn't significant market manipulation ur brain dead.  PLTR 40c 1/21

Cheaper route with nearly the same 1 to 1 movement in the underlying.

PLTR has done the same since $18 and has been tracking well 1 for 1 or close to it (the bid ask can get sloppy).

Just a way to up your ROI while lowering your capital investment is all.
Honestly, if the institutions want to go to 200% short float fucking let em. Literally selling em ropes to hang themselves. All it will do is make the squeeze harder in the end.

Cohen will squeeze em when the time is right or Q4/Q1 will do it for us. Either way the shorts are fucked in the next 6 months
Yea i remember this summer when SLV was supposed to hit 50 eoy maybe even 70

Just put in a buy order of 25 shares
Need to flip the 1.4 to 5+ right quick. I‚Äôm thinkin Sears...
Having some fun with thinkback today...

If you had invested $1000 into 11/27 $20 PLTR calls on November 1st and held until 11/25, you would have been up $89,500. Fucking crazy lol. If you held until 11/27, your total profit would have decreased to $77,500.

By the same token, if you had bought 11/27 $30 calls on 11/23 and held thru Friday, your profits would have looked like this:

11/23: 0
11/24: $1,500
11/25: $19,500
11/27 @ open: ($500)
And obviously -1000 at close

Can‚Äôt imagine the rollercoaster someone would have been on trying to hold over thanksgiving
I bought in at open yesterday, and I‚Äôm sitting here hoping that wsb pumps the shit out of this stock to unheard heights, finally proving wsb is a part of the big boy club. 

If that doesn‚Äôt happen I‚Äôll be pissed, grumpy, and poor, but for now I‚Äôm stock full of adrenaline and pumped.
I don‚Äôt know how you can bag hold empty bags. But okay... be angry.
Get an 11 pro max for same price as iPhone 12
You're the best kind of retard on here!
Of course I'm all in.  The delta hedge is for the banks because they can't stomach a 1000% loss like we can because we're built fucking different.
We need everyone to sell PLTR and move to GME. We can win this together
Now
In!
Just looked at AQST. What‚Äôs the bullish outlook on that? I saw that their latest medication for seizures got rejected by the FDA a little while back, but nothing significant besides that.
Do they own the stores? I thought it was all leases with average 2 year contracts?
\>$1bn in annual sales from e-commerce and growing.  They generate more total rev than CHWY right now. Except CHWY is worth 20bn more. Maybe GME is mispriced because shorts pushed the bankruptcy narrative too hard... maybe that is why it is exploding now.
Anyone in on DraftKings?
This and VGAC are my moves for this week
AQMS, CLSK
My bull chad cock will keep buying. Im doing my part
I think it‚Äôs something to do with the float. Very low, their Jew of a CEO is hoarding all the shares. You‚Äôre better off buying shares than anything, but they‚Äôll sit there and not do shit for a good while. I had to sell.
I‚Äôm really considering it.
How do you guys not be so cynical? Like it‚Äôs not even the doom and gloom of the internet it‚Äôs interacting with people in the wild. Makes me lose faith in everything.

How far out did you go?
I am not a big PLTR bull, but PLTR is much better than RKT. RKT is primarily an advertisement/mortgage company. Saying they are a tech company is really pushing it.
yes because this is a company I actually know something about
Isn't it possible that GME management decides to mint new shares and kill the whole potential short squeeze? They get to sell shares for a higher price than a realistic price and any upside of this trade is eliminated. 

That would only require someone to be friends with management. 

Or is raising new capital without a good reason also illegal?
FSR is better than PLTR join the wave

Yea I bought 100 more shares at the dip yesterday. I probably should have bought more calls expiring in May or later tho
As I sit diamond handing my calls on PLTR, I watch these and wonder what the fuck I'm doing not taking my profits and exiting the room full of you degenerates lol.
So why is it 16 now?
$108 call, exp. 12/4. Anti-maskers for the win on vaccines
In for 30 shares
No, the short % of float hasn't drastically changed for it to have already happen. Of course some shorts might've already covered, but not that many. When the short % of float drops to 200% or 100% thats when the squeeze has begun

Imagine being the team that is shilling this pump. You were in at the ground floor, probably sold off Friday, and now you sit back and watch a bunch of autist break their accounts Monday morning
Hasn‚Äôt the squeeze allready happened to a degree. 

People/institutions are looking at it in exactly the same way as you, looking back to VW and Porsche, and buying up the stock, pricing in the chance of a turnaround and restructuring. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs up a whole fucking lot. Sure a lot of it is based on console income, but that contributes to the restructuring potential in the long term, so it would still be a part of pricing in a short squeeze scenario.

Would market makers even bother hedging when all the institutions are mega short on this anyways?

Shares are a sure thing IMO
100 Shares, and sell weekly way OTM covered calls to lower your cost basis. Once PLTR rocket booster stage 2 kicks in and shares get called reinvest in LEAPs.

It puts it into perspective when the DoD, the largest data organisation in the world (1 min into video) chooses Palantir to help them make fast decisions. I mean it would just be a mammoth task for DoD to even think about changing from Palantir in the future.

Having decent ML-powered software services and going to intelligence instead of enterprise was just a nice way to grow a durable niche market with a lot of longterm upside.

It might also be the case that this is the smartest retail trap ever created by a bunch of hedge funds that wanted to offload their shares for the highest price possible.

Ha! If you're getting that much return consistently, then why change things? I bought 1 contract of SBE $30 Call with a May expiration for $188 on the 9th of Nov and sold it on the 24th of Nov for $1330. That's just one trade, imagine having 10 different companies with the same amount of return. I risked less than 2k all together and got 700% return. For me the leverage of options is worth it, but obviously you need to do your own DD. The advantage of LEAPS vs. Short options is that you take Theta decay out of the equation.
It was cute and adorable ngl. Glad they‚Äôre done for now.

I get it, I'm with you, and that would be great.  But numbers don't always transfer to stock price.  In GME's case, they have significant hurdles to clear before they can justify a cyclical comparable to the last two they had.

I think it's worth coming from an 8. Could always get a used 11 or 11 pro for cheaper if you want. Not much difference between those and the 12 except for 5G support and marginally faster hardware. Getting a phone with 5G support would make it more future proof though.

Let me rephrase that, it's incorrect that a limit order does nothing, you've placed a limit order and that either ties up money or shares. While you have that limit order you cannot use that money or those shares while the limit order is in place. Clearly that does something. If you have nothing to offer just say that, I'm genuinely asking if you actually have some insight.

But maybe it‚Äôs smart? If you list it at $500 -> your broker can‚Äôt lend your GME shares to shortsellers -> who then will have to pay higher fees to borrow shares to short GME.
what GME calls should i buy
It is safer than buying a call. You can collect $200 premium selling a put vs a call that may well net $1000 (5x potential). That said, if you are bullish on GME but you don't think the short squeeze will happen soon, then this is your 'riskfree' play for some free premium. Think though, if this is a cash secured put you're selling, you're locking up 1500 of buying power for that 200. that 1500 in shares or calls could net 2-3x if you truly are bullish on GME.

Underrated comment üëÅüëÑüëÅ
I'm all for the short squeeze, but I also think they're not going to crash because they brought on talented people to shift their business model to not solely depend on brick and mortar.  The Chewy guy and the Nintendo exec are two solid hires and I think they can make this company relevant regardless of the short squeeze situation.  I don't see them going the way of the dinosaur like Radio Shack or Circuit City, I see them more as a Best Buy situation where they turn it around.
This shit isnt happening. GME has been supposed to be short squeezed for months and months now. They do absolutely nothing well other than own lots of stores. Their business model is trash and they have lost revenue and sales this year. Amazon, WMT, or fucking target could demolish their entire model in weeks if they wanted to. My favorite thing about their financials is their BLPS instead of EPS
Count me in!
Im dressed in a bull suit riding tsla, will be back jan
Best workaround is to have multiple brokerage accounts and cycle through them. Also, when I was below $25k, I was religious about writing down the dates and times in which I made round trips, and writing down the date when my next allowable day trade was. Kept track of it in a journal beside my desk. It sucks, but honestly beats a NINETY day restriction on ALL trading, doesn't it?

Nice uptrend lately
Please address me by my formal title: retard
You don't need to learn just be a good fortune teller
You sir are a retard. I'm jealous.
I've mentioned this elsewhere but there's something that a ton of you aren't considering.  I've seen so many people saying "I'll buy shares to help out" but you don't need to.  If you buy options, the banks that sold you those contracts will delta hedge their short call position by buying shares of GME, therefore causing the price to rise even more.

The fact that so many people have a potential infinite-loss position on a GME short (of which the only way to close their position is to buy GME) is just the cherry on top of the fucking cake.

And one more thing, the market cap of GME is 1/50th that of PLTR.  If GME hits 30-50 dollars within 2-3 weeks I would not even be a little bit surprised.

I'm buying calls on Monday for 3 weeks out.  I also expect theta to be negligible because as the hype builds, IV's are going to rocket just like they did for PLTR.  We sell in 2 weeks or when the price hits 30 dollars.
Elon has his child and determined grimes is now obsolete

Ryan Cohen has 9.98%.  Permit Capital 4.79% (Sep 08, 2020), and Hestia Capital 5.08% (June 12, 2020).  All of these people have expressed displeasure with the Board, on the other hand, an agreement reached with Permit & Hestia may have mollified them.  

Scion had 2.75m shares (roughly 4.24%), this is now down to about 1.7M shares.  Scion sided with the board members at the time Scion had 2.75m.

Who are the whales involved? How does Glass Lewis and ISS tie in?

Surely the short sellers have borrowed shares at much higher prices they are now ~50-40$, so the price would need to rise way higher than that to trigger a buy to cover their positions...

Can‚Äôt wait for the Reddit ipo so I can short WSB
He has 1000 shares, so he makes $1000 per dollar increase in share value. So buying at 11, he would make 19k if the stock hits $30.
Both things can cause a moon for different reasons. GME also has a tremendous number of outstanding calls as it happens.

The difference is that gme is severely undervalued and has massive room to run from here, while pltr is much more limited
Lot of short sellers in the company, I believe it‚Äôs the most shortest company out there.  

The short squeeze will get worse as they have a very important test flight that will happen in December and if successful will lead to FAA certification for commercial flights

Would 500K be enough to buy land and build a custom solar powered house off grid by a lake in the Midwest? Kinda wanna get away from the noise and do my own thing, raise some animals, enjoy nature.

They have every reason. The market priced it for bankruptcy and they didn't expect a successful turnaround. Do some qualified DD and it's an easy spot. This will keep going much higher as it rerates to fair value.

Not really. Wait until everyone tries to cash out
He seems to think that he will have enough time to sell the options, but he forgets that corrections happen in a blink of an eye and usually in the after hours. I can't fathom his inability to gauge the risks associated with holding, just the other day the price was downgraded and it plummeted.

Normal people can make those gains, anyone with half a brain would have held as long as the narrative was still in their favor. The idiots are the ones who think the party will continue to go on. I bet theres some speculators that left the stock around the 45-50ish mark. You cant have FOMO when you've already won the game. This guy is ridiculous.

What is that?
Nah Mr Robot has hacking scenes (as realistic as it can be) but it shows great character building and development. Stellar music, great acting, fantastic cinematography etc. Even tho award shows are pretty trash the final season of the show not getting any noms at the Emmy (idk about about Golden Globes) is an absolute war crime. 

I loved the 1st 5 mins of the show because they show the one scene that are usually easy to just put in later on in movies/tv shows and gets rid of it so it doesn't come up again. 

S1 is great, S2 1st half is good but a little slow, 2nd half is great again, S3 is excellent, and S4 is phenomenal. I absolutely advise you to check the daily discussion of each of on Mr. Robot sub. 

I can't praise this fucking show enough.

You hold the leaps betting that the squeeze will happen before the options expire. Stock squeezes, and you sell while it's going up. A short squeeze is a temporary jump, so it's all about timing. Hold to long with either shares or leaps and you miss out on everything

Everything in between is flyover state territory.
You would borrow the shares from a bank and immediately sell them at the market price. Then when your loan is due you rebuy the shares at the market price and return them to the bank. If the price went down you profit, if the price went up you make a loss.

Or, you would buy put options.

This is true to an extent. Im sure there is a point where it gets closed for them but it would be pretty high. They should have risk management teams though, that would be encouraging them to trim. This squeeze could bankrupt smaller inst if they arent careful.

But ya, I would aim for mostly April calls in the short term for the above reason.  They can hold through temp run, but when we hear about the current quarter either verbally dec 8 or in the eps in march...they will realize that long term they are fucked and holding a steadily increasing negative balance while paying a ton of interest on it and try to get out.

Most large SI squeezes are mainly shorted by inst I believe, and short squeezes, especially lately are a dime a dozen - this one is just a much larger powder keg

Is their a genius in these parts, knowledgenate? No. No theor is not. But the great thing about options is the dif strike dates. So... If u think somethimg go up 1% in 1 day buy contract that reflects that. If u think it move 10% in one direcrion or the ither over a 1 month timr, place your bet accordingly. If over longer period, then go longer. Knamean?

I don‚Äôt disagree, but one thing I find interesting is that this sub says GME is going to moon because of how many people are short, but this sub also says PLTR is going to moon because of how many people have calls.
Totally the same thing. Nice try
I can tell you are a CBT connoisseur

Give it a bit of a gargle as well

It‚Äôs definitely fun riling up PLTR people who bought at the top. The PLTR elite who bought in at $11 wouldn‚Äôt get that pissed so the bagholders are easy to spot.

There is no argument against GME we are a more refined club who only know success.

Vanguard holds all my boomer stocks. I do my trading on RH and my TA on WeBull.
For context what is your NW and equities. I would do the  same but I'm too broke and young...I like bigger numbers on my screen lol
God I hope so, looking at my CRSR position this past week has been depressing.
You are literally proving my point you fucking moron lmao
You're in the wrong place go to r/thetagang

Its actually a really good watch. More a documentary tho. And why Im not touching NIO
God dammit you're good. Someone get this retard a drink!
I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm still getting a piece of that economic growth over there. Maybe the peso will be worth more then.
alright guys count me in for 2k GME shares Monday  (2k shares not $2k)   


lets do it
Positions or ban
throwing salt on his pussy lol so mean
> Food banks depend on PLTR

üòÇüòÇ
Depends what the run up is liked probably hold 3-6 months after
It would be huge and you could probably hold for 5 years and not be wrong
If you bought HYLN puts you will be happy Monday.  Exercising the warrants so definite dip coming.  Might still be time to get in at market open.
Shares even dropped 20% from the high to close. That‚Äôs a hefty loss. 

I get why people are salty about the loss but that doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else should get back to to switch places with them. 

Reason people are mad is they didn‚Äôt get out in time. If they cashed out at open and waited for a good re-entry to jump back in they wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as upset about the drop. In fact it‚Äôs just discounted contracts on Monday.
damn that lambo just went up *another* thou
As long as you‚Äôre good with the inevitable 100k down days. Where one is the other isn‚Äôt far behind

pretty sure it has less meaning than that my friend
Same, I feel you there. It‚Äôs made for a rough weekend honestly, not having that winning feeling. That was a bad Friday all across the board pretty much.
This is not happening.

Poor guys... first rodeo huh
Not for gaming. That's closer to 2k. But for running a trading platform $1000 is sufficient. Not including the cost of the monitors. That's another couple hondos.
Probably true if the US places everyone on house arrest
Crappy manufacturing letting the magic smoke out smdh
Have enjoyed the runup from $11 to $13
I felt the same as you. Check out the Americans if you enjoyed the wire. Also breaking bad seemed a little too unrealistic for me to believe so maybe that‚Äôs my problem. The wire and the Americans have a very realistic and gritty authentic feel to them that mr. robot and breaking bad don‚Äôt imo.
Nice work
> That's incorrect. Setting a limit order allocates the shares for sale. So they are locked to be sold.

It's absolutely not incorrect.  Call your broker and ask them yourself.  It doesn't do anything
So what? 60% is 60%. Flex raw numbers if that‚Äôs what you want.

That's a possibility. And so is the cross happening at 22. We will only know it in hindsight.
Blows my mind how tons of people trade options without understanding how shit works and are content putting themselves at a disadvantage when they have thousands on the line
Yeah. I actually look forward to Mondays now
I got in at $20 per share lol
This was the worst and best week to join this sub. Good because of PLTR, bad because of all the waiting. This is how I cope

LOOL all good and yeah of course they aren't the same just like how any country has its own. Like WireCard in Germany was done by EY Germany and that was a huggeeeee fraud. Same with Enron , Theranos etc, accounting firms and auditing firms actually aren't even supposed to look out for fraud, and people misunderstand that. They are meant to just check the validity of the info on the statements, how those numbers got there a lot of the time is hard to find and not even in there power.
Citron also called TSLA a casino btw, and then after, TSLA tripled!
well shes probably winning. most of these bitches waste most of it on rent and cars. i feel if ur on onlyfans u probably dont have enough foresight to invest

CRSR trading below $40 for the last time ever on monday
Nice
why GME again? has there been good news since the microsoft partnership. I don't think there q4 sales are going to be anything to write home about with WMT and AMZN being the bullies on the block
That‚Äôs a very detailed and great analysis. Thank You! Almost makes me want to ride out earnings on Tuesday, but maybe I‚Äôll chicken out and sell before then. I got burned on ATVI earnings a while back (wiped out half the wsb sub haha) and it took ages to recover. Definitely a gamble here, but your comments sync up really well for CRM‚Äôs future. Hoping for a little run-up on Monday at least!
Perfectly timed at the end. Masterpiece. TO THE MOON PLTR üöÄ

You kill the joy of those who don‚Äôt know what to do whether they are up or down on their options.
This is not the way
Also spreads are fine, they are a fine way to minimize risk and what I typically do. You cap your potential losses, but you also reduce potential profit.
my piss smells like gravy
Trust me. You will know.
Actually, the chart is terrible. You would want an entry after the 50d crosses the 200d probably around $9-12.
Someone made an interesting point that institutions will hold a lot of the short positions and will be able to afford their margin calls to avoid buying at crazy high prices, thoughts?

Didn't say you claimed they were always wrong, but if you look at the other 'Hot' post, people in there are saying it like that, when it's in fact not the truth, so I posted the counter to that.

I have no positions in PLTR, or any of the stocks associated with Citron (whether bullish or bearish).

I'm simply providing the other side of the story - WSB gained like 600k+ users this year, a lot of them don't know the full history of Citron, so they can easily be misled. That's all.

Good luck with your position.
Dude not fucking one. We have been in a deluge of PLTR spam.
Go all in on ACB

nah they are not pissed, it worked, small risk with a massive payout
Selling contracts is like picking up pennies on a train track ‚Äî not worth the risk.

Of course you could sell far out of the money contracts, but look at what happened with PLTR. If the guy that wrote these contracts that OP bought hasn‚Äôt suicided yet, then I‚Äôm surprised. You‚Äôre basically writing a blank check in the hopes that someone doesn‚Äôt find it and cash it.

Especially with the questions you‚Äôre asking. If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre not prepared for the risk.
except they have risk free reward, while guys take risks. So they're actually making more money than us wtf.
You make me proud

Your 12/4 is a little bold for me but i am also a pussy

I did a similar move, cashed out an 11/27 and got into a 12/11 33c at premium. I watched it dip and immediately deposited into my account, grabbed a discount 12/4 31c almost right at the bottom. We‚Äôll be good.

I think it‚Äôs going to pull back a bit. If you think about the current demand due to S&P inclusion, that big money demand will drop quite a bit so the market will need to adjust the price. IMO of course. But longer term Tesla will go up.

Real talk, what would the SEC repercussions be if someone started ‚ÄúPalantron Research‚Äù and put a press release out saying that PLTR has a target price of 50 by EOY? Any retard can push out a press release if they have the money.
So, say I can trade on margin in Robinhood, would having stock and options be wise for the squeeze?
Correct. But gotta get it there first.
Singles day was crazy big, I hope you have longer dated ones and you'll definitely be fine.

GME can be profitable becoming a good e-commerce, changing the stores to a service place for gamers (e-sports, trying games before buying) generating revenue with deals like the Microsoft... So yeah, they can be profitable, or they can go bankrupt. TSLA can be at the future the biggest producer of Cars as the market is pricing in or the other companies start producing more EV Cars and TSLE tanks 99%

First, its really nice of you to take that time and do what you are doing.. 

You need to just start complimenting the parts of her body that shes insecure with.. not just the face, titties and ass but everything else.. even if you dont think it is a big deal.. 

If she is insecure, anything you say will make her feel really good about herself :)
i invest with 5 figure sums atm. Would so i get 4 figure returns per trade normally if it icreases by 20-30% like it usually does before i sell. Would Options or leaps still make a lot more sense at that point?
Same. It will do the numbers people want it to do, just maybe not as quickly as they think. Or maybe it will! But shares are the safe bet.

What you are suggesting is even more retarded. Most likely the 420c was loaded weeks ago, and the guy is already sitting on a good profit. I'm up 100% on my ZM 600C for 12/4, which I entered a week ago. You'd be a special kind of retard to consider going in on options day before earnings. What is IV crush?
Oh my, a random employee with an attitude and a random dissatisfied customer.

Thank you for fixing that ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù analysis
69 filled orders in last 7 days. Nice.
This was my thought too but I‚Äôm nervous
I‚Äôm only buying shares. Options is a quick way to lose all the money you borrowed in the first place. PLTR shares are 4% dip-proof. Wait, and it‚Äôll be fine. 

Same with everything else we see a huge return coming from. You can‚Äôt time the market, but you can call a winner when you see one coming. Shares are as close to guaranteeing money as you can get, if you‚Äôre not a total retard.
taste it, dont plunge it
Some of yall in this thread about to catch a case pumping  PLTR so hard. SEC in this bitch be careful
But weren't those small companies? This is BABA, the 9th biggest asset by market cap.
Great, now I won‚Äôt be able to stop worrying and enjoy myself next time I‚Äôm using a glory hole

I'm getting down voted but I dont care.  I'll make money on this whether people want to tell me "iTs A rEaL CoMpAnY" or just admit it has retard strength right now.  I dont care what they do, I dont care if all they did was sell adult coloring books, I am riding the power of positive market sentiment as is everybody else on this sub.

As long as retards around here are responding to every post with a ticker symbol and rocketship emojis I'll keep holding my calls.  I dont give a damn how seriously anybody thinks we should take TSLA or NIO or GME or anything else riding on meme power.

It's a meme.  Treat it accordingly, take those +40% days and dont sweat the 5% drops.
Congrats. Easy 16% gain in a day if you were to sell at the highs of \~$27. I am still holding, up about 25%. Maybe it can fly.

Or are we REALLY saying that Roblox, (the thing every single kid knows about) is a worse investment than sears (that company that is closing down stores because it's dying...)

I'm not saying Roblox hasn't gone to the shitter as a game, but that's in response to managing things like this (more moderation ingame items, no more tix/robux exchange market) - if anything it's going the way of Minecraft and becoming "less cool" to older folks while completely making up for it with the next generation.

Front page of wsb has some options learning posts on it now i believe.
And the US has fucked countless countries markets and bombed people back into the stone ages too. The US can't afford to fuck with China anymore unfortunately, look at how massive the trade deficit is, China controls the world's base pharma materials, manufacturing and key industries.
The R K T problem is the high inst ownership, they control the stock. With retails traumatized, they won't be pouring back in anytime soon so the price will continue to tick down until a real BB and or Inst run out of shares to buy, then they'll rocket it.

Kinda what happened with gme, inst bought 100% of the shares at 4 bucks and are now on a money making spree. Maybe they'll walk it up to 30 before shorting it into oblivion, who the hell knows.

Good idea, I'm doing the same and I just started digging through some 13F's to see if I can find some steady uptick gems that haven't doubled in price YET this year. No more WSB ideas for this idiot.
lets say i have a 12/4 call at 45 for pltr, i see oh shit it might not hit 45 but it wilm hit 40. can i sell for loss or is it just worthless at that point?

I feel like when bitches show their buttholes, their should be a warning or something.
That's incorrect. Setting a limit order allocates the shares for sale. So they are locked to be sold. Can you set a limit sell and then sell a call on the same shares? No. Now I have read things suggesting they are still able to be borrowed, but it's because whoever your account is with will just use all the shares of a stock as a pool and pull from it. If you could elaborate why it could be beneficial.
I sold my short term positions when we hit $33 and used the profits to shore up my LEAP free rolls (getting their cost basis to zero).

I still have smaller scale short term plays in action.
Well, in February it was trading at almost exactly 1/4 at what it closed on Friday. You can't just look at one aspect that's unchanged and say that everything is unchanged.

"My apple tree didn't produce apples in winter, only fall, why? It was made of wood then and it's made of wood now."

The context has changed massively. Float, institutional ownership, console cycle, etc. Not saying it's guaranteed but widen your field of vision dude.
This is... not a bad idea
Many big players are betting on BABA, I don‚Äôt think it will get delisted.
Yea but I'm in GME. Investing in PLTR is DIVERSIFICATION. We don't do that on r/wallstreetbets

Their all time charts show them falling since being traded. No noticeable events other than terrible earnings each and every time. Looks to me like they got evaluated way too high and never made money. This COULD be a positive if it's been due to technology limitations, but that depends on what they've done to over come those. 3d printing was supposed to be a huge thing that never really panned out. If they got caught up in that and survived 12 years of negative cash flow they could easily turn it around. Alot of if's and could for me. Nice write up though.
Im still retarded, where did this number come from? I multiplied a bunch of things and I cant see how it was calculated

Glad to hear others use this strategy!  Was super hyped when I sort of accidentally ran into it.  How to ride GME with no idea how high it could run is a daunting proposition, and I've avoided many momentum plays out of fear of getting caught with my pants down at the end

It's flavor of the month! It will change to some other random soon. I predict that there is day when WSB goes 100% long $WHEAT in future too so... just roll the dice and buy those calls.

fuck PLTR! they're helping governments and law enforcement agencies perform mass surveillance on its citizens, which affects all of us. by investing in them you're helping them perform mass surveillance on you quicker, which is NOT in your best interest. are all of you too autistic to realize this? plenty of other companies to make tendies from which won't help governments spy on you

The only reason people are saying that they will have never been activated is because they don‚Äôt want to know what they are saying and what they are doing.
Just designate wsb as MMs and then it's all good.

The GME squeeze
Did you liquidate for the tesla payment or will you get a loan and use the pltr investment to pay for the car payments over time?
I actually only worked the higher paying job for about a year. I didn‚Äôt build up the kind of money that can really generate its own wealth but I‚Äôm comfortable where I‚Äôm at. Accepting or turning down a job just based on money is subjective. Personally my free time if more important than a six figure salary. The only thing that made me happy during my time at my previous job was when my direct deposit hit, besides that though I was miserable. Couldn‚Äôt train, couldn‚Äôt play games, couldn‚Äôt spend quality time with my girl. I would get home and be exhausted and just want to shower eat and sleep.
Sometimes your brokerage will buy 100 shares to hedge against you buying a call, this could in turn have a greater influence on underlying stock price.

They've been around forever though? Why now?
Is it realistic to put limit share at 1k instead of 500?

Basically. The funny thing is theres a quote from a former exec in there about mba's and evil etc and he worked there. Basically everyone gets their hands dirty, leave, write a medium post about how corrupt the world is without disclosing they contributed to it.

That's the thing. If Citron are complete morons, that means they will sometimes be right and sometimes be wrong, randomly.

So, inversing them also makes no sense.

Look at the Sec filings on GME investor relations page. Burry wrote two letters to the Board encouraging their $200m share buyback this summer.  The board still has $100m allocated to buy back shares.

In what universe can GME be profitable? They won't even be profitable if they designed their own games or rented all their stores to billionaire strippers. Tesla leads in EV, has auto pilot data, has factories that are making the manufacturering process more efficient, and is profitable in sales.

You sound like you explain Rick and Morty episodes without being asked.
This app / website looks like https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/pltr-stock
Definitely
honestly, Amazon is not a competitor. The real competitor is actually Walmart followed by Bestbuy/Target. Gamestop and Walmart have the largest allocation of the new consoles. Amazon is not even mentioned (which would explain the delays to Dec 31 for Xbox X preorders, or heck people receiving dog food or an air frier instead of their PS5 preorders)

[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27O0XR](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27O0XR) 

and you have to remember that Gamestop doesn't even have to dominate the market. People keep forgetting Gamestop is only at a $1 billion valuation, heck it was like $400 million when I started buying in. It only has to do a bit good for retards here to get another 2x, even fucking Nordstrom doubled this month, value trading is in now with covid vaccine on the horizon

Yeah that's fair game my man, I commented from a place of assumption for what I know/knew Gamestop to be. Certainly open to hearing something like this, I hope they can adapt their model successfully

Would you mind explaining please. As far as I can tell if they were allowing borrowing of the shares in the situation as stated, it is the company just grabbing shares from a pool so they may be caught with their pants down because the shares technically should be the same as sold.

Preach. Everyone crying about Citron, but they're breaking rules 2 and 3 of this sub by spamming it nonstop. I was in it since IPO. A lot of us were bullish on what they could do so we bough shares and some bought LEAPS. We never imagined that it would grow this much this fast. We stayed at around IPO price for a month before tripling in the next. 

A lot of us early adopters started exiting or trimming down our positions this week. As much as we believe in the company, there was clearly a pump going on.  I wish everyone the best that are still holding, but there's clearly manipulation going both ways right now.

Sir, this is a Palantir sub.
Unless you have a good amount of capital, shares aren't going to make you a ton of money. Let's use Bank of America as an example, if you have 500 dollars to invest, you can buy a whopping 17 shares at the current price of $28.97. Now if you buy a $30 strike call that expires on the 21st of January 2022, it would cost you $330. Let's assume that the price for BAC went up to $35. Your total profit if you sold your shares would be $103. For the options, your total profit if you were to sell it would be $380. What about $40? Shares alone would net you $188 and options would be $781. Looking at those examples, I would choose options all the time.

Rough math: GME makes like 50 dollars off a new Xbox. But with revenue sharing for online services, they make another \~30. So that's what, a \~60% increase in revenue on consoles alone that are brought into the online ecosystem, both analogue and fully digital?
[deleted]
His whole take here was that it's overvalued.

As for my post being stupid, I'm just providing the flip side to this echo chamber. You want noobs to stumble upon the other post and see "Oh, here's 7 instances where Citron was wrong, they must ALWAYS be wrong!", and keep blindly buying?

Literally just providing the counter to "They're always wrong", because they're not - in fact, they're right more often than not. Not saying they're right with PLTR, but just playing devil's advocate.

How hard is it to understand they release hits on bubble hype stocks after shorting and enter long on the dip. Calling them names and shit just shows how fucking dumb wsbers are. 

Citron creates better entries to fuel more hype. They are doing you a service. Learn not to buy fd‚Äôs and you won‚Äôt get burnt.  Don‚Äôt sell low and you won‚Äôt get burnt. Stock market always goes up, hype always dies down. Trade accordingly.
TSLA is another pump and dump then, they are always loosing money on the promise of a future where they are profitable. GME promise that they are changing the company to become profitable again.
yea I see what you mean, they just post it with no context, which is bad. I‚Äôve been GME since around $8 so I‚Äôve been thru the whole way. And yea, his Twitter is fucked, idk what‚Äôs up with Burry, he preaches Qanon shit, lost a lot of credibility
I only go long on uvxy for very short periods if I expect some volatility.
Unless you‚Äôre panic selling on a dip or waiting until the contract is literally worthless you‚Äôll have no issue selling your contracts. There‚Äôs a difference between holding until the day of expiry and trying to sell it at 3pm the day of expiry.

Copying this comment I posted on a similar thread:

I‚Äôve been following GME for a while. The Ryan Cohen letter that was published in the WSJ and attached to his 13f is hugely bullish bc it‚Äôs setting the tone for a takeover/buyout of the current management. Next earnings is 12/8, speculation is that RC will make his move then if earnings are bad as evidence that the current board isn‚Äôt transitioning fast or well enough into an e-commerce platform that‚Äôs also ‚Äúthe ultimate gaming destination‚Äù. If shares have to be recalled for a vote then all of those 66m shorts will have to cover.

Even if this doesn‚Äôt happen, GME has been making leaps and bounds away from the model they were operating basically since the companies inception. The MSFT revenue sharing agreement on all digital purchases on all Xbox‚Äôs sold, same day shipping, bundles with new consoles being available at GameStops by walk in customers when they aren‚Äôt available anywhere else, recently started selling PC hardware. There are a lot of big things happening with GameStop in lieu of the huge SI.

Either this thing will gradually ramp up to 30+ or it will explode. Timing it is tough, I bled calls -50% for 6 weeks on this due to the shorts grinding it down and soon it‚Äôs tendie time motherfuckers.
We need some regulation here. Everyone was so busy spamming Planatir you fucking missed QS. An EV company started by gates that just went public Friday. Its up 56% already. We have to stop the fucking spam. For all we know it could be an organized effort to pump a stock. How easy would that be? EVERYONE would fucking fall for it.
Honestly incredible

I agree, leasing has benefits - but they are certainly not economic. But it is convenient and you do get a newer car more often.

I get that sometimes you could get a lemon and end up costing more than a lease but I think that's very unlikely. I would advise anyone in a financially tight situation to look for a Honda or Toyota and I don't think they could ever rack up enough in service costs to lose out on owning.

Oh yeah oil has been killing it lately. Oil, retail, and green energy stocks have been on a moonshot lately. I was pretty confident in my dd on retail, so that's why I went with that, and I think it will continue with GME. I don't know enough about the oil sector or any of these green energy companies to make accurate predictions, so I've stayed away a bit. I will definitely have to do more research though. Demand for oil stabilizing could be a huge money opportunity so I'll have to get on that asap.

AMSC is a good green energy stock to check out if you're interested btw. It's not very option-able so you'd have to go with shares but I think it could make a big breakout soon. I made some $ off it over the summer, and even had my mom buy it in her ira lol.
Yeah it is, but until then it could still rise.

Yet no one mentions that he‚Äôs not buying, he‚Äôs selling. 

His twitter feed does not inspire confidence IMO. Dude seems to be drinking the qanon koolaid. 

Like most plays on WSB - early adopters made money. But by the time half the sub dives in, it‚Äôs too late. It becomes an echo chamber of bulls pumping & the vast majority end up bagholding.
[deleted]
It was never even this bad with TSLA, the ultimate WSB meme stock. Which has run up 50% over the same period and hardly anyone‚Äôs talking about it.

I‚Äôm just hoping this isn‚Äôt a sign of things to come where this sub turns into a pump and dump factory and laser focuses on one stock at a time. It‚Äôs so much more fun when people are playing a diverse set of tickers and actually trying to convince people on plays.

In order to short sell stock, one has to (1) borrow the stock (2) sell it (3) buy it back later (4) repay the debt i.e. exactly the same amount of SHARES (not dollars) + interest. This all happens automatically, so it may not be obvious. But that's important because in order to short sell a stock, you have to borrow it, sell, and buy back chipper. If you sold a stock and it goes up, well, too bad for you, the clock is ticking (interest + unlimited risk the higher the stock goes).

And how can you sell at a higher price and buy at a lower price, if everyone who could sell has already sold all the shares that are in free circulation, and those shares that are not sold are loaned to someone who is trying to short them?

Some of you will argue that if someone sold shares, then the other party bought them, that's a fair point. But I can say with 100% certainty that whoever bought Gamestop shares for $3 will never sell them cheaper, but on the contrary, will buy even more shares if the price falls below.

The only question is whether there will be enough buyers for the price to rise so much that at least some of the shorts are forced to close their trades by stop loss (that is, buy shares), which in turn will cause the further increase of the price, which in turn will (1) increase the temptation of tendies' lovers to sell their shares with a small profit, and (2) increase the temptation of some other short sellers to cut the losses.

Whoever has bigger balls, wins.

Another thing that way too many people don't understand on this sub is insider selling. Do some research kids, these guys don't get to sell when they feel like it.
Inversing WSB is generally accepted as good strategy. WSB is generally late to the party and is losing money. How many times wsb was hyped over something and it turned out to be trash?

I bought PLTR shares when it was in its 20s, and I want to hold for the next few years. I already signed that petition a few weeks ago, and when I heard about Citron's attempts to get PLTR down I spammed stocktwits with the link to the petition. Looks like it was worth. It's getting closer. By the way, I also found this -> [https://www.change.org/p/xavier-becerra-have-the-ca-attorney-general-and-others-investigate-andrew-left-of-citron-research/sign](https://www.change.org/p/xavier-becerra-have-the-ca-attorney-general-and-others-investigate-andrew-left-of-citron-research/sign)

yeah

whoever bought them on Oct 15 is down at least $10 million already (lol @ Melvin Capital). Whoever sold it will pump the fuck out of GME so those expire worthless, they can sell it back at-cost to short sellers who need to cover.

the people who aren't already underwater (short sellers) will have an easier time pumping the price up compared to short sellers who can barely find any shares left to borrow

There's less time to hit the strike, or to keep gaining above the strike for more profit.

You're totally right. Every time I go into a coffee shop I'm shocked at how much I end up paying. It is crazy how many people have that daily routine.

I think if people truly had the ability to self-reflect they would see they could start to save money and not be poor forever - but it is far easier just to blame rich people and the system for keeping them down.
Is there a way to calculate what the spike will hit?
It goes up 50 cents a day. Take out calculator, do the math

It‚Äòa good news that you don‚Äôt have radiating symptoms. Could just be a sprain or strain which will get better in weeks usually.

It‚Äôs also likely your discs are degenerating. Happens to everyone with age. 99%+ of people will never need a spine surgery though, it is what it is.

However that disc degeneration can make you more susceptible to injury.
Wat, I said when you have half a mil to eat there, not eat there and pay me half a mil

Why would you buy at all in the midst of a clear downtrend? If you feel like it‚Äôs on a downtrend wait for the bottom. 

I understand DCA out of necessity because you‚Äôre using your paychecks to build a position but I don‚Äôt understand intentional DCA with cash on hand.
Just curious on how you are negative this year? You could‚Äôve literally bought anything in March and doubled your net worth.

You need to start your own subreddit and give free daily recaps. Would draw a lot of attention to your site. This idea could be huge.

Yes lol but shares and contracts are not the same life wise. Bag holders are shares that are have Plumed to the bottom and instead of selling at a loss you decide to hold your empty bags. Once contracts hit bottom and expire you‚Äôre not holding anything but air.

I am 85% with you about the car! Only good thing when you lease a nee car, is that maintenance and service is on free while having older vehicle that you paid off, you have to cover service and everything! I have ford f150 2015 (paid off), last year I spent more than 7k on service (new transmission, alternator, tires, oil) I preferred nor owning money to a bank but it comes to basically same shiet at end!
5% down and 2.5% up AH is not comparable to down 92% over 5 years retard
Started with 1300, have 7k atm. On Friday‚Äôs high it was worth 12k
Any trade with the potential to triple in value has a significant chance of 100% loss.

Second, his public letter to GME management is right, fuck brick and mortor, master e-commerce.

this squeeze is inevitable, the uncertainty lies within what will be the catalyst. what are the chances GME management takes his advice?

‚ÄúResearch done in 51 Swiss homes with cats has shown that when humans sit back and wait‚Äîand focus on something else, like a good book‚Äîa cat is more likely to approach, and less likely to withdraw when people respond. (This preference explains why so many kitties are attracted to people with allergies‚Äîbecause allergic people are usually trying to not pet them.) Another study found that interactions last longer and are more positive when the kitty both initiates the activity and decides when it ends. Play a little hard to get, and you might find that they can‚Äôt get enough of you.‚Äù

Same rule applies to women. Everything we do goes back to evolutionary behavior.
We don‚Äôt go easy on FD‚Äôs
Because options expire worthless if your gamble doesn‚Äôt work out. Shares, on the other hand, are still worth something so long as the company doesn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt go bankrupt, and even then, you may still profit or take a loss smaller than 100%.

TL;DR: stocks are safer.

People always get mad when someone says skip the morning Starbucks, but unironically buying coffee from Starbucks in the morning is expensive as fuck. $5 a day is $150 a month. If you're barely making rent while dropping $150 on starbucks then re-evaluate your budget. A massive tin of folgers coffee is like $15 and can last a month. People make horrible massive financial decisions like new cars but they also don't comprehend how the little things add up. 

Everyone is conditioned to eat out all the time too. Drop $15-$20 on a single meal when $20 can get you at least a week's worth of chicken and rice. Yes, there are massive issues with minimum wage not rising with inflation and the like, but people also make stupid financial decisions that don't help.

Pete Davidson is that you?
No. Low volume expensive ticker. If its expensive and you pay 1 dollar per call option the seller of the option has to pay alot to buy the underlying stock to cover your call. Meaning you effectively turn your 1 dollar call option you buy into a 70 dollars that actually buys into the the underlying stock

PLTR is good, but GME is a pump and dump.
I didn‚Äôt. She was the love of my life. She and my sister were going out to a Black Friday sale three years ago and was struck by a drunk driver. She suffered a lot of internal injuries and died on the operating table. This leaving me a single dad of two kids. 

Since then I‚Äôve not dated and spend my time and energy towards my kids. Lately though I‚Äôve felt really lonely so yeah I‚Äôve look at naked chicks on a sub here so shoot me. 

Seems creepy that the dude is sooooo interested that he checks out my other posts? Kinda creepy to me.
super possible
some more than others!
Really need the irrational market to shine this week on BABA
TH CB and Kandi.
They will release good headlines and market is going to buy up shares and warrants accordingly. This deal with Microvast has more potential than almost all other recent SPACs. 

Merger with Chinese EV battery company that already has 100m+ in revenue along with government contracts? I mean they supplied the batteries for EV trucks in the Winter Olympics in Beijing. 

This play has insane potential IMO.
I have smartly used my trading funds swing trading and theta gang with some calls in the mix to get $50k in gains since June realized. 

I put that entire $50k into shares this week on PLTR and $10k more on calls because the next $50k ain‚Äôt gonna take 5 months gnomesayin

I'm down a bit on some 12/18 110c that I've been bagholding for a while but my girl cathie has my back
I bought into their spac KCAC at 20 dollars and sold end of day after it popped. The company looks promising and is backed by Bill Gates. However, their batteries won't actually be placed into Volkswagen Cars untill 2025.
Next week is crucial, I‚Äôll get as much as I can.
It depends on the technique. I‚Äôve found jelqing has helped my AAPL trades immensely since I started.
Look at QS stock that doesn't make EV batteries until 2030 vs this one with 100 million revenues and awarded batteries.

Up 160% on these calls
No, the whole huge vagina joke
Me after my fractional share of BRKA goes up 40 cents.
no one knows when the fuck the squeeze will happen, the only thing certain is that GME can actually go to $30 without a squeeze on fundamentals alone ($30 now would be like GME being at $20 in the past because of share buybacks) but no one knows if that will be January or April or longer so why waste your money on lotto tickets? Just put more money in slightly OTM calls instead

even deep ITM calls would be cool to leverage your position, only paying for the intrinsic value and none of the crazy IV. Like the fact that 30c's are even this expensive is hilarious, you double your money when it hits what $32? Everyone else with 15c or something will have quadrupled their money or something by then

but what the fuck do i know, im not greek
I totally agree with you if you are buying one year out leap.

However, I personally buy 30-60 DTE, and getting in on a dip helps maximize the profit/loss.

Nothing more painful than a 20 year bull trap
Copying this comment I posted on a similar thread:

I‚Äôve been following GME for a while. The Ryan Cohen letter that was published in the WSJ and attached to his 13f is hugely bullish bc it‚Äôs setting the tone for a takeover/buyout of the current management. Next earnings is 12/8, speculation is that RC will make his move then if earnings are bad as evidence that the current board isn‚Äôt transitioning fast or well enough into an e-commerce platform that‚Äôs also ‚Äúthe ultimate gaming destination‚Äù. If shares have to be recalled for a vote then all of those 66m shorts will have to cover.

Even if this doesn‚Äôt happen, GME has been making leaps and bounds away from the model they were operating basically since the companies inception. The MSFT revenue sharing agreement on all digital purchases on all Xbox‚Äôs sold, same day shipping, bundles with new consoles being available at GameStops by walk in customers when they aren‚Äôt available anywhere else, recently started selling PC hardware. There are a lot of big things happening with GameStop in lieu of the huge SI.

Either this thing will gradually ramp up to 30+ or it will explode. Timing it is tough, I bled calls -50% for 6 weeks on this due to the shorts grinding it down but soon it‚Äôs tendie time motherfuckers.
I'm hoping so!

PLTR or GME?
So you don‚Äôt understand how gaps in stock price work, do you? When a gap gets hit it always fills. So when $18 gets hit, it‚Äôll fill the gap that was left there. And for every dollar that GME goes up the shorts  are losing dozens of millions of dollars. Also anyone that shorted when GME was at $9 will be margin called when it hits $18. 

Unlike a lot of people in this sub I actually follow TA and do research on the stocks I‚Äôm playing. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù $18 to be a special number, it‚Äôs special because of the TA and fundamentals indicate that GME will get a strong boost at that number

Ok, that's enough of all of this - go to your room
I am too foreign for this was that meant to be sarcastic or real hope.
Nah instead I made a huge return on my MJ and U leaps I bought 4 months ago along with winnings from Cresco shares that i bought in September.
I shouldn't have laughed at that reply but I did. Take this upvote.
I just passed the consolidation phase and finally up nicley on my account.  Thanks JMIA, OSTK, JKS, ENZC. Still holding all until I hit my goals. Got in late PLTR and PSTH but expect nice movement.

This is the stupidest thing I've heard all day. You definitely belong here.
How can you sell shares to somebody?
Guys, look. 

What if we all went to PLTR shop and bought that black cap or steel bottle? EPS would fucking skyrocket, and we'd get +200% Q4.

Not even necessarily a 6 figure pltr holder. Each call you buy the big corps need to buy a share to cover that call. And the share price is actually kind of high. So technically you can force them to pump the stock if wsb starts to buy calls
The more people starving to death the less cost to government in the long run
This post is stupid. Anyone who‚Äôs done even the smallest bit of research into Citron/Left will see that when he was right, it was because he found clear fraud. Valeant had insane levels of fraud and was using shell companies and all this other shit, literally a pharma Enron/Herbalife situation. The important thing to note is that when he finds fraud, Left makes that known to the public when he announces his shorts. He had literally zero insight into his ‚Äúposition‚Äù (that may or may not exist) on PLTR, which gives me a lot of confidence that he just wanted to create a dip
Ah yeah I was talking about on shares but yeah. Buying on Monday, here‚Äôs hoping

Did not know you were the one and only businessman China and know how everything works. I have friends there in tech and I have no idea what your talking about.
Warning - huge generalization incoming and rant on why people are poor:

To all the retards in the media justifying the $40k vehicles in the food lines -
Only a tiny percentage of the population should be buying new cars. Everyone who is leasing a car is making an awful financial decision. I see it all the time - people using fucking 50% of their paycheck to lease a car because "I can afford it lol, the monthly payment is lower than buying lol".

There is a reason the poor tend to stay poor - they don't save any money and only buy new shit. 

Here's another anecdote: I recently bought a quite expensive (used martin) guitar from someone on craigslist who had just bought it new but ran into unexpected bills and had to sell it. He used one of those payment plans and will be paying it off for the next two years, but literally lost $1000 to own that guitar for a week. No joke, after the sale he told me "It's okay I'll probably buy another one in a month or so."

 I'm not poor, but I still buy everything used and save so much money and it always seems like it's poor people on the losing side of the transaction.

tl;dr: If you show low monthly payments poor people will throw all their money away
Bro why does guy sound like the CHAD?
Who are the mods? I‚Äôd be down to be one. I‚Äôm on here all the time. I bet I‚Äôd make a huge dent in cleaning things up. 

I have my fair share of hyping things up if I think it‚Äôs worth it. I was on the PLTR train early on, and still am, but have to agree seeing every other post mentioning it is annoying. If I see one more ‚ÄúPLTR TO THE MOON üöÄüöÄüöÄ‚Äù post I‚Äôm gonna be nauseous.

Fundamentally, no.
You're right, and I don't blame you, but you probably gained that luxury from making \~$130k/yr first.  You can work a dreadful job for 5 years making that much, save a quarter million pretty easily, and then do whatever you want from there because you can have your capital work for you.  But if you've worked your way up to $60k/yr, turning down an intense job that pays $130k/yr would be pretty damn ridiculous.
Lol... and financials matter because? Apha has good numbers but dumps lol. So you're point is useless

Honestly it could squeeze but the fact that everyone is in it only for the short squeeze is dangerous. Gme is a dying company and anyone investing in this is just looking to flip their share for a higher price before the company‚Äôs inevitable collapse. If a short squeeze doesnt happen eventually people are gonna get tired of waiting and this thing is gonna bleed out. 

Think about this: Everyone is expecting a short squeeze...plays that seem super obvious or shilled as ‚Äúwithout any downside‚Äù are always big red flags for me. This play could work out but im skeptical

I care only because some fucks will tell you one of your plays is a piece of shit, write some nonsensical DD, and gloat about their 60% win and say everyone should have listened, then you find out it's on a fucking $300 account and you're playing on a $100k account.
I think you're missing the point. Government contracts are secure and print $$. Government contracts require a certain level of security and experience. Government contracts are on a bid basis so they never go for the more expensive bids. MEANING there are always better companies with more quality data but the gubment ain't interested bc they're on a budget. Go watch War Dogs...its generally the same idea.

$20k in 12/31 32c on Monday open for me.
you paid over $1/share on 30c calls holy shit what the fuck

use that money to BUY shares and sell the 30c calls, and then you have your other half shares you don't fucking sell covered calls on just in case it goes to $30 that early, especially in this clown market where Corsair goes to a 3 billion market cap even though its revenues are only 1 billion (Gamestop has \~7 billion in revenues with better margins btw, also a clean balance sheet so don't worry bout that either)

Cut my steak into pieces, this is a plastic fork
sure, because boomers and algo bots trading GME are still not appreciating the impact of this console cycle. I mean what algo can even account for cyclical shit like this? The algos can't even appreciate the impact of the share buybacks (what used to be $25/share in the past will now be $50/share if it reaches the same market cap)

good thing we're not fucking boomers and can see this shit coming a mile away. The new consoles are going to be more massive than the shitty PS4 and Xbox1 (AMD before Lisa Su) because these are all on AMD Zen 2. Amazing price performance, can't fucking beat it with building your own PC on a $500 budget, and the Xbox X dev mode can even run Retroarch to emulate old consoles

Boomers have fucked up on their GME, this is going to be a 2006 pattern, not a 2013 pattern for GME since people were speculating and burning shorts as early as 2012 for that cycle. GME is just getting started
I‚Äôve been doing it with PLTR all week.  Check out the daily chart each day for the last 2 weeks.  Notice anything?

The key is to not be constantly checking this shit  i noticed i held on to pltr during its dips whenever i wasn't actually checking it every minute, once I did that on Wednesday I ended up paper handing and sold at 28. DONT CHECK THE DAILY SUB EVERY 5 MINS YALL
Aww you missed out on the tendies üò¢

Apha will always have dumb fan boys and will never pump. Example, friday ACB up close to 20% vs apha like 7%?

I did this with TSLA and so many others.. and on the flip side, when I didn't sell AMZN, I regretted not selling around the peak..  trading is stressful.. no matter what you do, you're wrong.. 99.9999% of the time..  as long as you made money, be happy.

Aye I‚Äôm in but I only have one question. Does this happen with every failing company? Or what makes GME different and more susceptible to a squeeze? I‚Äôm just tryna understand why it would work now in this situations vs when it wouldn‚Äôt work in other situations.
What?! No... üôÑüòÇ
Calls on stoppage time penalties
I wish Tesla would figure out a solution to this. Tie it to your account and allow you to apply it to one car at a time. But that‚Äôs a very valid point. Also, it‚Äôs $10k now which is insane. However I can add additional ‚Äúmodifications‚Äù to the insurance to insure it for the additional cost. I‚Äôm not fully convinced I‚Äôll actually buy it yet until I drive it but we‚Äôll see.
I'm OOTL

Are we messing with algos with the off brand lego game stock?
Lol but am I wrong? How exhausted are your pockets of PLTR calls right now? Do you even have more money to buy the "dip"? What does the company do, and how does it make money?

I'll get off the stage now.

Even if nothing happened with Man U I‚Äôd still get puts because fuck Man U
Alright, so they need a SPAC extension so they can extend life span of THC ü©∏, so they can merge with microvast! Tricky thing is if they dont extension approval, spac company will die and shares will be restored for 10$ and something but warrants will be worthless (i will not keep my warrants trough a vote)! Good thing is there was only spac in last year that didnt get extension, so odds are on our side! Also whoever has main shares, he suppose to get extension meeting invite so they can vote
My understanding is they are kinda like an offering, it's another way for companies to make tendies... Could be totally wrong

It will hit 50 by end of December

Positions on GME?
I didnt lose my job, i can work from home, im saving a ton of money each month not buying gas or fastfood lunches or going out to movies or whatever. Also no vacation this year. Ive saved 10k since march and invested it all in my robinhood acct. 

Before the pandemic i didnt have extra money to invest because i was spending it all.
As a newbie medical school student, I think mass vaccination wouldn't happen until next summer. 

Also, if there's any issue with fast-track approval by FDA, distrust of vaccine would be huge in America and further dealy herd immunization...

Also nio imo is purely a spec alternative play from tsla. Id be careful as Chinese stocks usually swing extremely wild both ways.

I really struggle to grasp how a company like GME recovers former glories within the same market. The gaming world has changed. What are Gamestop doing to 'get back on top'?

Obviously just my opinion but taking the stock trading out of it, what the hell can Gamestop do to recapture the market within their industry? Or more importantly, what ARE they doing?
I bought at 33.00

Look, I'm retarded as the rest of you. I see PLTR, I bought some. To this day I don't know or care what it is, I'm up about 40%.

PLTR $50 EOY FUCK GAY BEARS
In the article it says the direct offering was on Nov 23rd, so does that mean the dip from the offering has already occurred?
Somewhat inconsistent but there are some really funny episodes in there.
When people short the stock and the stock starts moving upward, the shorts have to cover by buying back into the stock before they lose their asses. It then puts more money into it and sending it higher
Yolo retard buy more pltr calls
Open multiple accounts using different brokers.
Well unfortunately this Audit story could put pressure on all Chinese stocks so we‚Äôll see how nio responds
Depends on the premium, or if Corsair keeps dropping buy some stock or calls if they are affordable. If not, keep your account balance for the next time pltr is sold off and buy back in 30 or 32 and so on.

I‚Äôve been saying this for a while - the lines for food banks aren‚Äôt indicative of economic health.

Of course people will wait in long lines to get boxes of food loaded into their trunk no questions asked

Adding: SAS hasn't been above EUR 1.3 since early 2010.
Damn that‚Äôs something I need to consider then
It‚Äôll be interesting. For PLTR I can see it sitting at 27 for a minute tho. I was doing some analysis on GME after hearing about it on here. That shit moonin
I prefer my tinfoil in the oven w/ tendies not on my head.
This reminds me of the guy posting Verizon $70 calls were a good idea.
Not gonna lie. This brought a tear to my eye.
So, in simple terms, when people are shorting a stock they are betting that it‚Äôs gonna drop in price. If a stock starts to rise, they start to lose money, in order to stop losing money they have to buy the stock they are shorting, which in turn ramps the price up. It becomes a loop.

I‚Äôm planning on doing it Monday, gonna flip the premium to shares and April 2021 calls.  When put expires worthless, which I‚Äôm fairly sure it will, I‚Äôll use the freed up cash to buy more shares.  Still gotta math it out to figure best strike price to premium in case of assignment, but looking at the 12/4 26P, $1000 is a juicy premium, and $16 break even wouldn‚Äôt fuck my cost basis too bad in case of a dip.
Dollar dollar bling bling.
Says the guy on wsb during the weekend
Gotcha. Thanks for the input.
Its impossible to say for sure what will happen but from my vibes wsb is not fully in control of this beast. Alot of investors outside of wsb hyped in and 99% are short term traders. Not to say it can't keep going but nothing is holding this up besides hype and momentum.  Unlike tsla which went fully retarded and has even cramer behind it.. pltr has a way to go to prove itself as worthy of the run
Learn cause and effect retard. Just because something happens doesn‚Äôt mean it did because  it hit the number in your head.

Nordstrom basically doubled with its Q3 earnings. Same thing with Bed Bath Beyond. These retailers are priced at basically bankruptcy valuations, so any hope will make them skyrocket. Surely Gamestop right before a massive console cycle has better prospects than these retailers, and funny enough, Gamestop's revenues are still valued lower than all these retailers

Like you see a shitty $1 stock that gets oversold to $0.10 because people thought it would go to $0, but then it turns out it's still worth a shitty $1 so holy shit the people who bought at $0.10 suddenly **got a fucking 10-bagger from a shitty stock** (see PARTY CITY this year, also TUPPERWARE stock going 20x)

Just buy April calls instead of December calls to be safe lol, or just buy shares

This is the way.

My guess is the crew buying because Cramer gave the thumbs up got scared because the Corsair CEO said that Black Friday wasn‚Äôt going to be anything special. 

I think it‚Äôll keep rising but I sold all my calls and most of my shares until i see it gaining more as I need that capital in other stuff. I‚Äôll probably rebuy the 50c or 55c expiring some time early next year soon

I feel like DKNG is a nice play. I think it might touch it's all time high levels in the coming weeks. I understand the legitimate concern about raising covid cases, but at this point the NFL looks hell bent on pushing forward. Also, with news that the first doeses of the vaccine will be in Washington DC by December, I think that sports teams should have access to it in the not-so-distant future. On top of all of this, you got the NBA returning in a month.
Look at this guy not being a fucking retard snd bragging about it.. wooo hoo good for you. I bet you don‚Äôt lick windows or get cucked either. What a bad ass.

üòÇ
Why?
YOLO DKNG
it just needs to reach a 3 billion market cap to reach $50/share. Burry the original autist pushed GME to do massive share buybacks, so now each share is worth almost double (if GME goes back to its 2013 market cap, it'll be $100/share instead)

Do you think 3 billion is impossible in this clown market? Even Corsair did it and their revenues are like 1/7th of GME's with lower margins

Also **short squeeze**. Have you ever seen a pick before where there are more shares shorted than what is supposed to exist? We are just playing with shares that short sellers borrowed and sold to us, and someone will eventually want them back if there's a shareholder vote or if they sell. Institution ownership is at \~90 million shares, and there is only 65 million shares outstanding (including insider shares, so float is "supposed" to be like 40 million shares if there were no shorted shares floating around)
Got back in town like 6 hours after my plug left for 2 weeks. Rip in peace brothers I‚Äôm gutted.

Short squeezing is on buying. You might want to learn what terms mean.
If you felt the need to post this then you are probably not well liked by anyone you've encountered throughout your life
Definitely!
Let me know what you come back with pls

Are you going in with shares or calls? If calls, what positions?
Because I was a noob back then
Do you still have positions in PLTR?

What was your low?
Thank you sir/mam, you made the right choice
Don‚Äôt use results oriented thinking. You had a much higher change of losing 4 k and still having 4K in debt.
Dear fellow tard,

You made it to promised land. You don‚Äôt need us anymore. Please sell, pay taxes, and if you must gamble just put it all into SPY on margin and sell covered calls. 

Sincerely,

People who actually kinda but don‚Äôt really care

I posted a comment about $600 12/04 when it was around $2 a contract and most people thought I was a retard. I mean I am, but a broken clock is right twice a day
The short squeeze, the percentage isn't high as it was. 19.5% short interest, which is still good. Shorts still have room to cover
Going crazy here like a fiend , thank god Shitcoins never sleep
Why are ppl disliking this they had a major run up the last week
Hahaha I like it!

The thing though, is how do you know when to pull out on something like this?  No one can really guess how high it will go with fomo and squeeze in one.  Tesla ran what, 25x on 30% SI, but it is obviously better positioned for the future.

There are estimates from 400 to 5k.  I you sell at 50 or 100 and it goes to 250, its going to suck balls, even if you average out.  But with this method, you can keep riding it without fear, because your riding on your profit's profit's profit at some point.

Short squeezes have lots of little dips that look like reverals on the way up
Overrated
BofA deez nuts bitch
I‚Äôm optimistic as well but the huge drop the last few days has me worried it will level off for awhile. Hoping it bounce back up a few $s next week
Oh so it's just riskier compared to options closer to the stock price if the stock tanks. Thank you!
Why do you listen to them? Hindenburg is much more reliable. These guys don't so much investigation other than arbitrary analyst stuff.
Just depends what your comfortable with and what your short and long term goals are concerning locking in gains. You may want to use different trailing stop losses but be careful they‚Äôve saved my ass but also knocked me out of some beautiful gains because of a short term (30 minutes) dip.
‚ÄúPLTR babe, I bought the dip.‚Äù ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yea, it's brokerage specific, or, BS for short... At the end of the day this is a free market, so you should be able to put in whatever order you feel like. Whether it get's filled or not is another question, but you should at least have the freedom to put the trade out there.

I use both RH and TD and noticed this problem a few weeks ago. I think the decision-making for RH is: with offering free options trading (vs. TD who charges something like $0.65 a trade, so $65 in total fees for a batch of 100 options contracts), RH can't really price those YOLO penny options without losing money on their end as a brokerage. So from my perspective, RH offers a massive advantage through free options trades, but the own downside is you don't have as much flexibility entering trades sub-$0.05. When I do want to make those trades, I have to weigh the pro cons of much higher fees with TD vs. the potentially asymmetric payoff if you hit.

If you're curious see this [link](https://imgur.com/a/PUJaaXS) for proof using the STWD trade you mentioned as an example. First pic is RH rejecting my attempt to buy 100 STWD 12/18 $30Cs for at $0.02. Second is a look at the STWD 12/18 options chain through TD, which shows last trades for the $22.5Cs and $30Cs at $0.03 (albeit with a pretty wide spread, so unclear how much volume you could get at that price). Third is an example of what the order looks like on TD, priced at $0.03. Again, not sure if this would get a fill, but at least you have the ability to put it out there and see if anyone bites. And finally fourth is a pic of some of my sub-$0.05 trades over the last few months. I'll say SPY options are the most liquid and easiest to get a fill in the $0.01-$0.02 range, but as you'll see I've priced plenty of these trades with other stocks.

Hope this helps. Remember it's a free market, so these brokerages are going to push whatever helps their bottom line the most, regardless of whether it's right or fair or "market" pricing.
I have 1/22 calls on the hopes of cruise euphoria at some point once a lot of boomers are vaccinated

You bought into PLTR at $30 yesterday right before the drop. Inversing your plays would be a good move.  
Thank you for adding to my DD.
Lol!

What happened to it previously? I see it was trading at 80$ a few years ago. That‚Äôs what kept me From buying when I initially read about this a few weeks ago from someone on here.
I got in some TRNE about two weeks ago. Another SPAC, not very hyped on forums. It‚Äôs been on a steady uptrend for a week or two. Merger vote on the 8th, that will almost certainly be approved. Possible catalyst on Wednesday. Not sure what it does after the merger but I expect it to continue climbing this week. I‚Äôm just on warrants and commons.
Oh I'm happy with the $25 call for sure, but it's selling the 14.5 for a loss of 50 instead of cashing it for a gain of 13k that makes this whole last couple weeks feel like a very toothy blowjob
Right next to your vagina if you don‚Äôt buy
[deleted]
Yeah get your calls in before Mossad kills another scientist
Same
Why 12/4?
god, you make me want to hold onto my puts with last hope ...
If you don‚Äôt know how options work, just buy shares.

Buying a call does not obligate you to sell the 100 shares.  It gives you the right to purchase the shares at a specific price within a specific window of time.  If the equity rises above the strike or break even price of the contract you purchased it is advisable to either sell the contract at a gain, or exercise the option, which allows you to purchase 100 shares at a current discount.

You should really learn how options work before trying to trade them.  You‚Äôll lose your shirt otherwise.
2 more hours
This is what happens man. Buy shares, instantly red for a month or 2, green surprise
Yeah I would like to know what‚Äôs up with this. Might research later
Usually takes time. I have Jan & April calls.
The sales are for 4Q announced in March. 3Q has 3.9M gross e-commerce orders on their US site, of which a chunk were preorders that also are recognized in 4Q. 3Q is the ER on 12/8
Lol... you're retarded. Look at the dollar volume needed to move it to 145. But go ahead and play Appl.
But look at the financials.  They're 5 years+ away from bankruptcy, and that's low-balling it hard.  In no world do they go bankrupt in the near term
If you haven't decide on what to do with the last 2k. Consider jumping on TSLA Dec 31 800C or 850C. 

Both PLTR and TSLA have terrible premiums at the moment (too expensive) because of their incredible run the past few weeks. So they are both dangerous to play with. However, if I have to chose between the two, I'd choose TSLA. 

Reason: I don't know much about PLTR and don't know any upcoming catalyst for PLTR for it to continue pushing higher beside WSB community YOLO continue pushing it up. TSLA on the other hand has a catalyst of S&P500 inclusion where there will be an unprecedented amount of shares that indexers HAVE to buy in. TSLA has already run up quite a lot because of this news, but I think it's still has room to run up when indexers have to buy in. The amount of shares to be bought by indexers is HUGE and I believe it will drive TSLA up to 800 if not more by end of December.

I currently have June 18 2021 800 Calls (expensive at this point). I plan to sell most if not all by end of December after the inclusion.

Play at your own risk. Not financial advice. Just my train of thoughts.

Ok then...
bestbuy only gets 15% allocation of the new consoles, while Walmart and Gamestop are estimated to get 30% each. Bestbuy is already close to 0.7x of revenues while the contrarian swing play on GME still remains as they're at 0.2x of revenues (since some boomer retards thought the new console cycle would kill it???). GME is still the value play here, along with the short squeeze meme

They are not the play if you want to ride the console cycle hype. NTDOY is better because most people are sleeping on them without realizing that Nintendo Switches are going to outsell both the PS5 and Xbox X this season because timmy still wants a new console but mommy can't get timmy a PS5 because of bots

NTDOY still at a reasonable valuation, remained consistently at 4x of revenues (the price increases this year was all organic growth) while all the other shit are in a small bubble. NVDA is now valued at almost 25x of revenues compared to 10x previously
GME has me üíéüíéüíé right now.

GME already up 2.5% premarket.  This week we're sending it to the moon, like NIO last Monday, and PLTR on Friday.

Guess which day this week GME is doing it's 20% intraday?

Keep an eye on the bumper
Yeah RKT has high trade volume but no upward movement. I'm currently watching GME to see if it goes anywhere. Honestly I can't believe it's gone from $5 to $15.

I can't understand what's happening so I'm keeping my money away outside of small bets here and there. Just piggybacking off the market momentum.
How much do you need a year to pay your bills?
boo
I mean, PLTR doesn't have any real reason to keep running beyond momentum.  It could easily stop here.  I mean shit, NIO still hasn't recovered to the 55-56 it was at pre citron report and it has insane market share potential

&#x200B;

But ya, paper hands get fucked in GME.  Holding through the last month was brutal.  Thank god I bought the fucking dip daily that whole time!
 Lol I‚Äôve made 15k from my NIO position that cost me about 4K vs if I had paid off the 4K in credit debt I would not have made the extra 11k. Also I have the intention to pay off the credit card completely. Just want To let my money make money for me first.

Start preheating you're oven cause you're taking home mad tendies üöÄüöÄüöÄ
They could go up more but the risk reward is better in many other stocks rn... especially if playing options due to the iv increase of nio and pltr. I was in nio from 30->50 but pulled out because i felt there were better oppertunities elsewhere
overvalued
Don‚Äôt panic sell, and you‚Äôll be alright. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road but this will be worth more than 33. People here are tripping because they have otm weeklies expiring soon. You have shares so chill out and enjoy your tendies in 2-3 years.

Looks like you‚Äôre still valuing it as a brick and mortar and not an online retailer with logistics and economies of scale. If valued at B&M you could say it‚Äôs fully valued, but it‚Äôs not B&M any longer. Change your view and you get your incredible Wall Street rerating cycle.
Exactly
Real truth? They do fundamental research driven by facts and data which is completely useless in today's autist driven meme stock market bull shit that we are currently in.

You don‚Äôt know when they will release Dec 31st earnings. Year end earnings take longer to come out and it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôll do so. I do wish I could edit my post title to read BEFORE March 29, 2021, but I can‚Äôt. Institutions have algos in place using the 180 day period. I would know, I work for one.
Their new direct offering is just another company about to invest at a discount.

Less risky than tesla at these prices. Welcome home my fanciichild
If PSTH goes to $40 before June I will dye my hair silver like daddy ackman
Or you're in awful shape.
This is most likely the way
Yes Biden won the presidency. If Dems swing Georgia in the runoff then they have full control of Senate as well.
Where were you when GME bought AMZN
Fucking christ lmao. Don't retards know that when an option goes ITM is when you start making the real dollas? Now if it's a stock that you feel is getting weak or has no upside left that's a different story, but damn.
Maximum retarded. Fortunately so are the rest of us you‚Äôll fit right in

Fuck Citron. We are gonna be billionaire because of PLTR

Buy the dip!!!!!!!
I'd like to order some Palantir tendies
PreCovid (and QE) they had good interest rates on a liquid FDIC backed product.  

We have a diversified portfolio; 7 figs in RE, 7 figs in equities.  Approaching 7 figs in bonds/savings.  

Just because I like playing in our retarded subreddit, doesn't mean I'm a literal retard and am not diversifying.
Is RKT ever going to go anywhere? I bought a 12/4 $20.5c yesterday out of boredom. Seems like this one is overdue, can we make this a meme again?
Super expensive, and if the price falls or stays flat you're still going to lose the same amount of money.
Redditor for 307 days
alrighty nerd
Well it has gone from $4 to $16
Everyone said to add it after you order and pay for it so you don‚Äôt have to pay taxes on a software toggle, makes sense to me
Why do you assume the GME market makers who keep the option chain liquid are the same institutions shorting the stock?

That‚Äôs a weird take.
Basically when Citron releases short position:

buy puts immediately 90% of the time you make money.

sell end of day and buy calls.
Kudos on wasting his time
[deleted]
Someone goofed bad and let one of the ITM covered calls expire instead of assigning. I thought thebrokers made sure ppl couldn't fuck up like that
Fuck alright I guess I gotta see a doctor
Lets not forget arkq bought 1million shares on the dip and another company bought 5million shares on wensday. Cant wait till it hits $100
There was a dude saying to not put preorders in for shares, only buy them when market is open. It allows the short sellers to see the volume and then fuck us bulls in the ass
Thanks mate.
Directions unclear. 

Do I need to buy 100 shares of GME?

What happens when my call gets ITM and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have 100 shares lol‚Äù. How do I avoid getting Franklin Delano‚Äôd here?
When I saw the losses I incur buying high selling low I said fuck it and quit my job todo that full time.
they just have to beat an estimate of what, -0.85 EPS or something? if Gamestop seriously can't turn a profit or at least give a good guidance, then I'm out because apparently I mistakenly bought a Funko pop retailer suffering from reduced foot traffic due to covid instead of a video game retailer finally dipping into e-commerce out of necessity

I was going to trim profits right before Q3 (note I've held through Q2), but I've changed my mind after their news that they're paying off most of their 2021 bonds early. If Sherman uses covid as an excuse to not give a guidance again, I'm just going to hope Cohen kicks his ass then

fucking boomers i swear
damn alright. I usually just buy shares...
GME 30$ leap calls and bulk shares are the moov üòò‚úåÔ∏è
Dont buy it lol notice how ppl are suddenly talking about it after the price has mooned 50% in a week... what does that mean? Youre gonna carry the bags
The memes are just getting better üòÇ
I think so, shows they‚Äôre close to a deal and just need some time to put ink on paper
Same!
APHA
Plenty of other subs for that
I‚Äôll average into your mom. 

Do people really still do that? DCA? If you like it at today‚Äôs price buy it at today‚Äôs price. Why would you go ‚Äúhey this looks good. I think it‚Äôs going to go up. Let me buy a little bit now and then pay more for it tomorrow‚Äù?
Don't know about that. But I lost a lot. üòÖ
Oh an engeneer? In this i trust my life savings

Short squeeze potential
That being said, there is already a "counterpart" to Citron Research. It's called WSBTronResearch: [https://twitter.com/wsbmemes](https://twitter.com/wsbmemes) Fairly new, so that' why OP didn't mention it I suppose.
I actually think the long form makes it funnier. When I first came here and started watching meme videos I thought it was hilarious how long they were.
The backorder is an interesting tidbit. NLS has been looking like a snack, given how far it fell after earnings. Have been planning on getting in soon.
Could someone explain why you wouldn't just buy an option that is farthest in-the-money? I understand that you are putting up more capital but wouldn't you be making more profit for the same stock price? Are there more benefits to this? Please and thank you!
Lol you you're fool, enjoy that dough buddy. Love to see you get to splurge some. Congrats

Nah you good
This is the way. I am 100% in GME.
Crying a bit on the inside for selling 1000 shares of  APHA at $5.10 and thinking I had a deal in August. Then watched it stay flat at $4.45 a few months ago "waiting for the next  dip" to hop back in and ...Dayem :(:(...I need covid cases to lower this  week. Blessings from any religion appreciated

Puts on English teeth for sure.
max GME option price is $30 lmao
Still to volatile for my taste. Ready to play after earnings for sure.
What news?
Can‚Äôt believe you fucks are close to convincing me to dive into GME

I'm very new to all this, will move to options and a better platform when I'm braver lol
Short term ACB probably outperforms because it's got a low share float so it has bigger swings. Long term APHA is the winner though it's due for a big day soon.

Good read!
Yeah absolutely. There has been a lot of great DD by some fellow autists. Moral of the story is they are enormously undervalued. Even if it doesn‚Äôt moon, a fair share price would be around $40 especially as they transition into an e-commerce company rather than a retail chain. Buy a couple 100 shares as a hedge if you aren‚Äôt a believer.

How much risk is there buying GME shares now with earnings coming up....did I miss getting in at an earlier price

 The content of the earnings call doesn't matter. It will be a win either way. Go read Cohen's letter. He filed a copy with the SEC. He  laid down a gauntlet. They better report good news or he is going to  step in to take control. So the call will say "everything is great and  here's our plans for the future" or Cohen says "you guys are shit, I'm  taking over the company to make Chewy 2.0"

PLTR did not IPO, it was a direct listing.  The lockup period ends 3 days after the 2020 full year earning report.  It should be way before March, although I don't think the date is set, yet.

It's okay to be assinine and continually post "PLTR to 500" spam, but now you are actually posting incorrect information.

Probably couldn‚Äôt understand anyways. We‚Äôre retards.
You‚Äôre absolutely correct, and in that case they were pretty spot on - from what I read. My theory on these short sellers is that a good 50% of the business they take short positions on are actually decent business, but with questionable corporate governance arrangements, or poor accounting procedures (for example) but are ultimately generally solid growth stocks. They short and make investors shit their pants and make $$ from the sell off, then get back on the stock at a lower price, for a decent long position. Genuine short positions on LK for example help build their credibility as a short selling firm. (They didn‚Äôt even write the report on LK - as far as I understand!)
It would make more sense for every state to use the distribution system already set up for booze.   Just increase their salesforce to include cannabis.

The guy above said IV is 15%. So you get a 3% discount if drops 12%. Best case is open green on Tuesday and fades throughout the week. Buying before earnings is a huge risk and very little does it payoff

Anyone can announce anything lol. I can make a post right now to try to stir some random stock, but there‚Äôs no guarantee, and about as effective (probably less than) any other article on the internet saying a stock might go up or down, or talks about short squeezes.

Just because it all happens to be the same stock on Reddit is literally the flash mob/hive mind effect of Reddit.
That is also a fantastic way to make money on this with the IV being so high!  You just don't have the unlimited upside that calls do
You close your robinhood account and move the money to a broker
Someone bought 16.5k calls @700 sept 2021 on Friday. The MM will want to cover that and never mind the funds needing to buy more shares for Dec 21st. I don‚Äôt except it to tank until after that date. It will pull back like Friday but will still trend upwards overall. IMO :)
He bought $20k worth of 10c back in May when the stock was around $5. Now the stock is about $16, so the intrinsic value is way up, and there's still time left on these, so plenty of extrinsic value left as well.
Congrats !!

It's only illegal if some shit snitches. Fuck snitches bro.
it doesn't matter. GME was already given a lowball price targets like $1.60 by salty analysts and no one cares because GME is/was at literal bankruptcy valuations (with a clean balance sheet) so everyone's basically like wtf you on buddy?

Some institutions are also buying into the GME meme and have been accumulating very hard at the $10 range based on the 13F filings. Burry was just too early (again)
Pltr
Yes they are, because those sales will appear in Q4, not now.
$500? $1000?  I'm thinking of setting sell limits in tranches, starting at $100 (enough to cover initial investment), then $500, then $1,000.

I don‚Äôt get this either. GME clearly has strong support at $10. So the shorts have had multiple chances to jump out around $10 on dips. 

But they seem to keep loading up. So I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre expecting ER to be trash &/or the market as a whole to dump? 

We have so many GME bulls pumping this daily for months now. And nobody ever posts the bear case despite clearly millions of dollars staying firmly on that side.

One method uses terminal value + discounted cash flows to calculate the value of a company. Then it‚Äôs market cap divided by valuation to get your ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù. Companies in similar industries with similar growth prospects should get a similar multiple (usually its range based on how much your discounting future cash). But like I said, it‚Äôs basically impossible to accurately calculate these for high growth companies.

I‚Äôll do one better, I‚Äôm in for 1000 Monday. If they think WSB pumped NIO and PLTR, which have over 1 billion shares, imagine a 22 million share float. Sounds like free money to me. I‚Äôm in.

If I knew that I would be in a different place. No one knows what a stock will do. Everyone here swears GME will moon. But it can very easily tank too.

I‚Äôm too pussy to invest in GME cuz of earnings
Positions:

NET $70c 5/21

PLTR $25c 12/31
PLTR $29c 12/31
boutta throw my life at it on the next dip, i will be those lil green candles on a knife down, trust
The point in buying $GME is to force a short squeeze, don't fall about the earnings, good or bad. -20% or +20%. Keep adding shares to get this +3500%

It's already so stupidly overvalued that I doubt we can pump it.

Also it's product is bland and tbh nowhere near as good as BigQuery (which Snowflakes product is a copy of).

This is different to shit like PLTR which people don't understand at all, most people "get' what SNOW does so it's harder to pump based on "well data derp".
Plus it has an amazing algorithm, basically letting it target users with ads at a level that other companies can only dream of. Add in its enormous user base (top person has like 100 million followers) and the fact that much of its zoomer user base will be coming of age in the next few years and it‚Äôs a gold mine waiting to happen

Do you really not know how warrants work? They're callable. If the stock hits $30, they'd have called the warrants way earlier... Probably somewhere around $18. If you really want to maximize upside, you'll have to buy calls.

Don't be a retard. I don't know if your dad gave you that 30k or what, but DO NOT YOLO IT. Unless he was born into a shitload of wealth he worked hard for that money, so don't set it on fire.

If you to trade and try to make money from this, start very small. Put most of your money in some kind of gay ETF or buy some dividend stocks that don't suck complete ass. If you're really set on fucking with options, start by watching the market, doing some research on a possible play and then put a small amount of money on it. Don't do more than a couple of these at a time to start and don't FOMO into something just because you see it mooning.

they would have, but the FED saved them by buying their corporate bonds, only placing them in even more debt. 

And the stock market crash of 1929 was due to over leverage and excessive debt across all asset classes, and the economy needed de deflate basically.
There's no world where that happens. It's gonna squeeze, but 50 is an optimistic prediction, let alone 1000.

Oh btw, on GME there‚Äôs a gap between $20 and $18 that hasn‚Äôt been filled since it gapped down a year or so ago. So likely when we hit $18, we‚Äôll rally to $20 hard, and shorts will start getting margin called. $18 is the magic number

Their 10K does not look like they have a lot of runway, but they can always raise more money. People getting in now should expect some bumps and swings. The gamble is that it has large squeeze indicators and could have a huge pay off, but there is definitely short term risk there /w earnings. Don't play if you can't risk a short term loss. Or, if you did get in early(ish), take some profits from the latest interest, and diamond hands the rest. My 2 cents.

Fuck the SEC!

I mean, it‚Äôs true, but you can also think of me as a market maker - I‚Äôm allowing you to buy a call and I‚Äôm forced to buy shares in order to delta-hedge my position. I‚Äôm essentially betting against the short squeeze happening over the next few weeks and selling CCs allows me collect more money to buy shares. I‚Äôm selling 50% OTM and if we grow 16% a week, I keep my shares and everyone happy. We go down, I DCA, we go up, I buy more. I‚Äôm accumulating shares anyway, but my risk strategy is different.

There‚Äôs too much hype on PLTR. Don‚Äôt get in front of a freight train bud.
yeaaaa no, do not trade low volume garbage pump and dumps
The reason people around here are getting hyped about gamestop is because of the short volume.

Shorting a stock is borrowing a share, selling it, and hoping the stock goes down so that you can buy it back for cheaper, and return it to the person you borrowed it from (you also pay the guy you're borrowing from a bit of interest). 

More than 100% of the shares of a stock can be shorted, because someone can short sell it, and the person who bought it can have it borrowed from them, and short sold again.

Now if the stock starts going up for whatever reason, the people with shorts outstanding will start getting nervous and want to buy back the share they borrowed and sold, so that they aren't forced buy it back for way more later if it keeps going up. This drives up the price, which can make other people who are short start buying up shares too. This is called a short squeeze, and can cause the stock to shoot up quickly.

Gamestop has a crazy 160% or so of its shares shorted, which means a lot of people are going to need to cover their shorts. People are thinking the squeeze will happen sometime between January and April.
Works for me. ü§™

on Monday I‚Äôm going to sell 100 puts near the money weeklies.  If I get assigned, that‚Äôs cool, as I‚Äôll just turn around and sell way OTM calls for earnings on the 8th.  The outcome there is going to be much more probable.
The squeeze that will happen Monday will be glorious. Something we haven‚Äôt seen in a while. Either bulls drive their own üöÄ to target or we see massive bankruptcy filings. It‚Äôs going to be quite beautiful. One way or another, someone‚Äôs losing a lot of money. ü§§

If I was playing for only short squeeze, don‚Äôt you think I would have December 40c instead of 30c. By definition a short squeeze happens instantaneously and if it happens will rocket gme to 100+(likely 500+), even if it is just momentarily until supply calms. For a short squeeze to happen there has to be a low supply, and a catalyst. Supply isn‚Äôt low enough yet and who knows when/if a catalyst is coming

The brand value of GME is negative. Just read the forum to see everyone taking a shit on them for awful trade in offers

No one actually likes GME. They only go there when they have stock
If you dont see the opportunity in PLTR and you‚Äôre still working your 9-5 job in 5 years i honestly don‚Äôt feel bad for you one bit.

this isn't a real company lol
Wait are you talking about SEARS thats now trading at 0.17USD? Or am I on the wrong stock

Good to be alert to the PLTR lock-up.


Broadly, lock-ups on IPOs are optional, their terms negotiable, and can be linked to performance or other metrics.


PLTR placed a lock-up on 80% of shares. It will end "at the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of [Palantir's] financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020" -- the exact date is not yet known. It'll probably end before March 29th.
It's not even funny anymore at this point. It's insufferable

Yea man I feel you. Don‚Äôt get me wrong the money was great but not being able to train, see my wife or have any time to relax minus sleeping just takes a toll on your body and mind. There is always time to make money but you just can‚Äôt get your youth back. Plus the job I have now allows me to take as much unpaid off time as I want so for someone like me who has their financials in check this is huge plus for me. I told my girl I plan to travel about 3-4 times a year after Covid clears up

Guys, you don't need to buy shares.  If you buy calls, chances are you'd be buying them from a bank that is delta hedging their position.  This basically means that if you buy 100 contracts of a call with a delta of 0.4, the bank will buy 40 shares (0.4 \* 100) of GME to balance out the effect of movements of the stock price.  

&#x200B;

This means that if we buy a geometric-shit-ton of calls on GME, the bank will buy GME for us.  Then, when the options get more valuable, the delta of those options will actually go up, forcing the bank to buy more GME than they previously had.  THEN, as the price is already under the effects of a positive feedback loop from the sheer retard strength of WSB, all of the people with short positions hitting stop-losses will be buying GME as well to close out their POTENTIALLY INFINITE-LOSS positions.  

&#x200B;

So yes, if GME gets 1/4 the hype that PLTR did, it will hit $30-$50 in a matter of weeks.  And one more thing, the market cap is 1/50th of PLTR.  Take from that what you will, but I'm opening positions on monday.
Witness me!!!!!

You over leveraged your coke and hooker money?
I think CRSR will recover on Monday personally. Most likely will hit 40-41. Not sure if it would go that much higher since investors are spooked. The call volume has been increasing throughout the week and the line at 39 held. Others say it'll keep dropping to 30s... but I honestly don't think so. Gaming is hot right now. While Corsair doesn't control the monopoly of PC peripherals, they've kind of established themselves as the premium brand when it comes to PC gaming. Their PSUs are probably the best on the market with EVGA lagging behind. They also have that streaming software for twitch that allows you to use your iphone as a camera. everyone knows every lil retard wants to be the next fortnite rainbow color hair streamer. corsair allows u to be that retard

They limit your gains yes, if stock is at $20, you sell a $35 call, you get the premium, and $3,500 if it exercises, if stock goes to $70 you gain no benefit past $35. However, when IV is this high, debit spreads can make sense. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm running, and this is considered quite conservative around here:

This ones a bad move. GME has a dinosaur business model. Those other companies rose because of future speculation
Thanks for the insight
Bags of dicks
Considering Wall St. analysts don't predict a positive EPS for 18-24 months (btw they are terribly incorrect), I would argue that nothing is priced in...

Business is valued at 0.16 p/s.... That is painfully low when you have a >$1bn/year e-commerce biz. That alone is worth $30/share.

You cannot write off GME because 'bestbuy/amazon'. That's like saying SHOP was a bad investment early on because AMZN existed.

Huge TAM (and growing y/y) for what GME participates in and they are starting to improve on how they get their piece of the pie.

This is literally the most asymmetrical play in the stock market right now. GME valuation is so low that there is incredible downside protection at these levels. Not very risky.
You ever use Salesforce? That shit sucks and the company is worth $225B
One 20k long dated play seems like a better strategy than twenty 1k weeklies

Ride the wave, autist.  Sure the sub has skewed recently toward retards pumping small cap shit.  If you‚Äôre nimble, and follow the FOMO, you can usually jump in and out to scalp ~20% gains.  I use most WSB posts as a leading indicator of retardation.

It ran up to the 20s on value.  It ran from there to 54 on FOMO.  Maybe it is fairly valued in the 40s/50s, but it got there because it had momentum and everyone piled in.

Being a meme/momentum stock doesn't make it a shitty company.  Tesla is a meme/momentum stock, but it is and will continue to change the world

What people should understand is that the content of the earnings call doesn't matter. It will be a win either way. Go read Cohen's letter. He filed a copy with the SEC. He laid down a gauntlet. They better report good news or he is going to step in to take control. So the call will say "everything is great and here's our plans for the future" or Cohen says "you guys are shit, I'm taking over the company to make Chewy 2.0"

Maybe, but there isn't unlimited upside in PLTR and it is a massive market cap that WSB has much less influence over.  GME is tiny with huge squeeze potential.  It has a vastly higher return potential than PLTR does.  Once a squeeze kicks off, PLTR's moves last week will look cute in comparison.
Then they sold giant barbie doll houses that were life size that people could build and live in during the 1900s
Only on WSB is a drop after a week of 51% gains a ‚Äúbeating‚Äù. I swear you pussies see this stock drop 5%, panic sell, then act like it‚Äôs the Great Depression then go downvote everyone in the Monday daily discussion thread because you didn‚Äôt buy on the dip.

How about this then: It is very unlikely that he does NOT receive at least 2x his money.

BoD is now highly motivated to shake off the short interest after the call out in cohen's letter.  The company is now experience what is likely their best quarter ever (with numbers that support this).

Company is extremely undervalued for their size.

Turnaround story.

FOMO is strong, and while it shouldn't be relied upon, GME is on everyone's watchlist and moving a few bucks will definitely lead to retail piling in as we have and continue to see.

On top of that, Cohen wants to run the ship, which creates added incentive for Sherman to show stellar results if he wants to keep his job.

This is easily a 2xer if you're in shares.  If you're in calls you should be several times over that by now.
Why?

Reading DD here is so risky. Some people are   well spoken enough that once they use enough buzzwords it sounds like they know what they are talking about and you can get baited into following "DD" that's completely baseless
It‚Äôs public knowledge, once you own a certain % SEC rules you must make it known. Burry‚Äôs company passed that %
Cool. At least you're a knowledgeable person who made money off Tesla. It's hard to make money off a retard play when you know what you're doing.

I get that there are a lot of smart bulls who seemingly believe in Tesla (before and even at these levels). It's an investment strategy based on belief in a macro trend without much fundemental support.

Some smart investors have used that strategy to do well across investments like that. Amazon being a good example.

Sorry you missed the lottery ticket, but since you worked on Wall Street you probably understood that the convertibles were the linchpin of the bull / bear risk over the last year.

A speculation over the last 12 months pushed the stock beyond the risk of the convertibles making it a win for bears. If it wasn't for Coronavirus, Elon may have had to face significant dilution. It was a similar situation for a company like Netflix years ago. 

Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. Or to be disciplined with macro strategy based on broad rules of when you will add or reduce to your allocation or cut bait. (I think ironically Cathy Wood is a contemporary example of this strategy. Even though kids think that there is some magic fundemental analysis that is reasonable supporting her underlying valuations. It's essentially castle to the sky stuff combined with general calculations on what could be possible using basic extrapolation and scenario analysis assumptions.) 

Congrats on your win. Don't feel bad. I believe there is a 99.9% chance that you'll have an opportunity to get some really great deals after investment markets crash sometime in the next 5 years. Markets from real estate, to equities, to sports cards, and art are all in historically high bubbles driven by massive speculations and unpriced risk / interest rates. Just because sovereign debt continues to rise doesn't mean that rates will stay near zero forever or does it mean stimulus will be infinite.

Good luck...and I'm sorry you have to deal with the torment of watching retarded kids yolo thier student loans on trust funds into massive gains that they don't deserve because they don't know what they're doing. Remember it's the law of large numbers and a ton of them will lose a $#@&ton. These things don't last forever.

(By the way, saying that the inclusion was front run is not an insult. That is a debatable data point.)
Don‚Äôt sell. Solid company
If it short squeezes yes, if not you‚Äôve just made money by owning stock
Was this really worth a post?
It SHOULD be adjusted. Some less popular, small cap stocks go unadjusted for months
Bullish sentiment is growing rapidly with the rising share price. If it continues this way that could be a catalyst all by itself. Could see a slow squeeze similar to what happened to OSTK over the summer. Waiting for Q4 reporting in March will be a death blow to the shorts. I'd imagine GME would be much higher at that point though if nothing changes from now until then.
Unfortunately I don't know if any of the current holders are either working with each other since they all bought their shares at 4 bucks or if any of them truly believe there's value in the stop... 

One thing I do see is this though " Though Burry sold 38% of the fund‚Äôs Gamestop Corp. (GME) position, the game retailer moved up to a #3 ranking in Scion‚Äôs portfolio. This was due to substantial selling of other holdings. "

I can't believe serious long term investors like myself would still listen to a company that basically means "lemon" in French and has acted like one since I can remember... They shorted some of the best performing stocks in recent times and are now shorting PLTR lol. All jokes and memes aside, that is an idiotic move. Not only are the fundamentals fantastic, the hype and demand are out of this world, and that can last a long time, as we see with TSLA, another company they bet against. They should be out of business and can suck my cock.

GME rsi is in the 'make money' zone
APHA looking juicy for this week
No minimum, just depends on what you‚Äôre comfortable risking and losing. Most people spend thousands buying lots of OTM lotto tickets when buying just a few ITM or ATM calls will suffice. Obviously the more contracts you buy the more lucrative the gains. Stay small, learn the behaviors of options and how you react to said behaviors before buying multiples of a contract

DFEN calls first thing Monday.
Ok so VW had a 13% short level before the squeeze, with 37-40%% of shares held outside of the main 2 investors. This made the shares shorted about 1/3 the float. This isn't even counting the number of shares held by passive investors, which was listed at 5-6%. Porsche had announced they were exercising options to buy basically the remainder of VW's shares (31.5% of the float). 

&#x200B;

Upon this announcement, short sellers realized that once these options were exercised, there wouldn't be enough of a float to close their short positions, so they all tried to buy the shares at once, before the float was reduced by Porsche's options. This drove the price sky high. 

&#x200B;

For GME, the context is very different, you have a highly beaten down stock with a much much higher short volume, but also a much higher float. If there is a short squeeze like VW, it could be insane with prices rising to 1000 a share easily, however it could also just not happen. This all depends on GME's upcoming earnings (for the next several quarters). If GME can demonstrate that its business model is stable and that it has plans to survive and grow, the squeeze will happen. If investors think that it'll end up going bankrupt in the next couple of years, it won't happen.
you retards go to a store, purchase something, then report back here saying "calls on xyz just made a purchase"

and i honestly like that energy
Fr I can't wait for the actual PLTR motion picture
Please elaborate. Oneblank asked if he can exercise the option before the expiration date which you can. 

Didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the recommended method of how to handle the contract(s).

Would love this "Iran Deal" and the "Paris Accords" be challenged in the court system.  

These are fucking treaties.  Submit them to the Senate for ratification or stfu when an executive of a different party says "This bullshit, fuck this" and leaves.
You‚Äôre an idiot
This just seems risky as all fuck. Surely the share price for the console sales is already factored in? On top of that, even if GameStop were to diversify their e-commerce business with TVs and PC gaming parts, the margin on those items is so low that I just can't see them being able to compete with the likes of Amazon or best buy. They're way too late to the party, even with Cohen. I think this is going to be a flop. The only thing that could happen is the squeeze but I'm too retarded to know enough about it, let alone put money on it. I hope you all make mega tendies but there's just not enough reason to throw money at GameStop alone. Feel free to correct me with earnings p/e ratios and the like.
Because they collapse in on themselves, yeah?

Oh for sure, but people weren‚Äôt buying stocks. They were buying options and if they tried to diamond hand they went down to pennies. I‚Äôll
admit, you‚Äôre advocating shares, I respect that. It‚Äôs just the sentiment that strikes me as wild.

EDIT: thought you were talking about how you‚Äôd be up if you bought early 2020. Talking about the 2000 bubble is a deep cut... I hope you don‚Äôt plan to hold GME to 2040 lol
Once you‚Äôre rich off GME it won‚Äôt be as stressful watching one of SPCE‚Äôs shuttles explode. Whoops! At least it was some other millionaire inside and not you.
You can sell anytime before market close on 12/4. The day of 12/4 is fine just has to be before 4
you mad you didnt get on the train
The deal is only with msft
I'm a simple man. I see pltr, i downvote. I see GME i upvote

To be a meme stock territory it has to be a company that's average 7% up a day and make no profits. That's nio but not xpev, pltr but not sono, etc.

What customer base?
They are closing underperforming stores. It is bullish. They are trimming their SG&A by 27%. Less operating costs and more online focus. 

Management clearly outlined the necessity to close unnecessary stores that are costing them money. This will increase their bottom line. Most cities have multiple GameStops.

Cohen wants to close even more stores and sell off aussie/eu division, but that must be bearish as well right?
That‚Äôs why you shouldn‚Äôt take it as real advice.
Yeah not sure on the actual process there. I'd imagine this isn't an old problem and theres a way to exercise for profit even if you don't have the cash to exercise. Something to look into with your broker.

No. You said state level. Look, lots of folks get off on the idea of lockdown for reasons unknown to me. I‚Äôm not one of them. I think it‚Äôs really fucking gross and takes away from actually addressing issue. So get off on it if you must, but don‚Äôt manipulate data set to try to spin a story to get you willies off again. Lock down season is over. COVID season most certainly is not. And that a problem. But gtfoh with lockdown fear porn.

I've thought about it. I guess I like the simplicity of a flat cash back rate on everything. Nothing to think about. I think I've also read that the rotating categories tend to be things you won't spend much money on that quarter anyway, like gas in the winter when you drive the least. Though I'm not sure. I'll look into it.

XPEV will be over $100 a share EVENTUALLY, short term it is hard to say, their G3 is getting killed by WM's EX5-Z, their P7 is having okay sales, still losing to NIO and LI on sale volumes; and their P7 is getting chipped away in sales by MIC Tesla Model 3; it could be very dangerous for XPEV when NIO starts taking orders for their sedans. a problem with the P7 is it's targeting young males; NIO and LI make cars targeting families and a neutral for singles; NIO's cars are very popular among female drivers

The calls should've been automatically excercised. they assigned me on the calls that I sold to someone else. The call holder should've been assigned at 25.5 but I was Instead, and the calls i should've been assigned on 25, were voided. Robinhood is fronting me 255k on calls I was never holding. Even if I was pinned properly I would've been assigned at 25 or a share not 25.5. This is a big fuckup.

Travel credit, 3x restaurants at places we knew the Amex Gold wouldn't give us 4x made it worth it imho.  

Chase + Amex gave us unlimited airline redemptions (we used points to upgrade to business on international flights on either Korean, Al Nippon or Emirates).  

We topped off our Emirates account using Amex points to fly 1st on an Emirates A380 one time.  Was insane.

Which one? Some are behind the stock, others are shorting it. Institutional ownership went up a net 5 million shares last report. Cohen's fund is buying it, Bank of America is shorting it. I know BoA makes some stupid decisions so I definitely wouldn't follow them. They were on the wrong side of Burry last time and lost billions after buying Countrywide Mortgage.
GME fucked me last month. But I think PLTR is done for right now. Going all in on GME at open. Also PLTR puts

Thanks for the link, I will have to sit and look through that last year or so worth to see how things look for my investments. I still think its unethical for them to post about a stock with no report or explanation. The market for PLTR may be built on future speculation but there is an underlying business model, its a problem investing when their product and client use isn't transparent due to the nature of it. The short list of ones they've got right werent exactly the huge hype train shares that have had this following, aside from maybe NKLR? The next few months will be very telling.

GME business plan is successful omnichannel with meaningful participation in digital game sales and DLC. Digital ad revenue, reduced store fronts, e-sports integration, PC hardware, customer data sales, successful same day delivery. Overall retailer that sells anything electronic.

Plus GME has already been squeezed. The giant bull run in August had GME at under $5. Shooting up to $9 was already a massive move. 

The October 1 day massive volume squeeze from sub $10 to $15 was a squeeze. 

Is there more to go? Maybe. I hope the company turns around too. But expecting it to hit $100 solely based on shorts is insane. 

They‚Äôve had declining revenues for years now. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre getting ready to issue more shares & raise cash.

He wants to buy a company selling physical media when the clear direction is digital delivery (so much so that they have digital only consoles)? GME has 0% market share of PC games and that‚Äôs where it is headed for consoles now

Here for comments
It depends on the amount of blocked funds you have in relation to to the total amount of funds in your portfolio. Another way of looking at it is that you need 2.5x as much money in your account to keep the same percentage on your margin. If you've invested less than 40% of your portfolio into positions you should be fine. Otherwise they'll close

>In U.S. financial slang, a¬†bagholder¬†is a shareholder left holding shares of worthless stocks. It can also refer to the holder of any financial instruments that become worthless, such as the¬†junior bonds¬†of a defaulted company or the coins of a failed¬†cryptocurrency. The word is derived by combining¬†shareholder¬†with the expression "left holding the bag." [Wikipedia] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagholder).

I don't think buying shares that dip some percent in the same day qualifies as being a bag holder...

Lol it‚Äôs pretty common for big firms like this to sway the market artificially. a good investor should ask themselves, ‚Äúhas anything structurally, organizationally, etc.‚Äù changed with company X?

Even in a theoretically ideal scenario, there is a probabilistic effect. I.e., if the odds are 80% A 20% B, then the market position should reflect that. Since basically nothing is a 100% guarantee, there should always be some effect though it may not be significant.

No , robin hood is fronting the 225k to cover 10,000 shares of spwr. If the long call had been exercised , they'd have bought for 220k , kept the $5000 difference. Instead they have to buy the spwr at market price on Monday , for $234,300 give or take.

PLTR hype is genuinely terrifying, all the people who usually say "be careful, it can plummet as fast as it rises" are saying they're selling their other positions and going all-in to ride the PLTR pump to 54 EOY. The bullishness on this company is off the charts, if only they had started with fewer shares like TSLA it would be truly a pump to infinity.

I personally have been preferring mid term plays lately. Like a month or 2 out tops typically. I realized there was a trend going on where pent up demand in retail was going to lead to better than expected sales. First this happened with Party City. When they absolutely smashed earnings, I knew I was on to something. So I played Kohl's earnings, and the same trend appeared. A few other retail stocks have also reported fantastic earnings. Based on what I've seen, I think Gamestop is going to also smash earnings. I've scouted a few gamestops out, and theres always multiple customers in there. I saw there were "now hiring" signs up at multiple locations too. This was before the new consoles btw. I expect their sales were already doing exceptionally well, and now they're going to get a huge revenue boost from the next gen consoles.

Got a little side tracked here, but I believe the setup for GME right now is a recipe for tendies. Analysts keep underestimating retail, and there are a bunch of idiots still denying this trend.
I see this a lot on stocktwits, but also just look at the massive short interest on GME. These shorts are in for a wake up call if I'm even remotely right.
I'm in great idea

Has anybody actually explored the GameStop app? It‚Äôs... not so good. As more and more people turn to buying games digitally and cloud gaming matures, how will GameStop adapt? What can they do to incentivize people to buy games from them rather than big box retailers, independent game stores, other digital retailers, and the console manufacturers themselves? I‚Äôm trying to find a strategic path for GameStop to adapt and grow but it‚Äôs hard. It also doesn‚Äôt help that gamers‚Äô sentiments around GameStop are not the best. A lot of gamers refuse to shop there. Anyways, this is just food for thought. Would love to get your thoughts and discuss.

Sad to say, Africa means jack shit economically.  It's a basket case, poor governance, bad infrastructure, and an incredibly poor population.  

On top of that, the company isn't even making money, without an AWS like the real Amazon.
I won't make a prediction but if one were to skim charts for the retard ticker basket of tendie babies for the period you are inquiring about in prev years, (i.e. TSLA, AAPL, AMZN, SPY, etc.) one might find that the period of the 20/Nov - 1/Feb, with a target pullout at mid Jan peak; would easily, leap the dips - pun intended; and likely allow the stacking of kraft slices at some point before or at the apex value of those times.

Im suggesting this just to screw citron. So price stays up and they lose their 20$ per share bet.
It‚Äôs not going to a $100 billion over night or even at the end of the week. I don‚Äôt think you know this but this stock wasn‚Äôt  a IPO. It was a SPOC, meaning no bank is the owner of this stock. Investors from SEED round can sell their shares. The founders wanted a $100 billion dollar evaluation, but due to covid no one wanted to IPO a company at the price due to their losses. So they said fuck you and just entered the market super undervalued at $20 billion. This justifies the run up to $45 billion. But if you look at other IPOs regarding datadog/snowflake. We can see wall street values data, thus the future has a $100 billion market cap, if PLTR can reduce their cost.

Bruh the heat in your car is free.
I'm in the camp that says you have to follow the price action and follow the trend. The trend is bullish. Very bullish. If you are short when price is moving like this, you will typically lose money. 

That said, fundamentally something is not adding up. Gold should not be dumping with the dollar. Credit is contracting. The housing market has to slow down. Huge chunks of the country are locked down and we are trapped in a lame duck political situation with a bitter outgoing president. I wouldnt be surprised to see some kind of major insolvency crisis that topples the markets. 

I think instead of trying to short the bubble, you just make smaller, more aggressive bullish plays with tight stops and try to raise money on the way up. Day trading is also a good strategy. We could easily blow through 300 on QQQ and melt up with no pullback for the rest of the year.

Also he declined multiple offers to be on the board, he obviously wants a big role. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but it seems very possible that he‚Äôll buy it

Citron is run by a man whose wife was so disgusted with his beta cuck ways, she dumped his ass and married an alpha bull.

Andrew Left is short boy mad he has to pay his wife alimony while she gets her back blown out by someone without a micropeen so he tries to fuck Chadly McBigDong by tweeting that NIO wasn't a stock, it's a casino (sound familiar?) to try and fuck with it.

Hey man, Thanks for the guide I appreciate it a lot. Now its time to sell the PLTR stocks like a dummy and buy calls like a true autist. PLTR 12/4 30c to the moon.
A million shares would hardly affect the available float enough to matter with short numbers so high. Also, why would they want to dilute the shares and make their numbers look worse? Plus Cohen and Furry wouldn't be in favor of it.

A few of the $PLTR analysts are my former colleagues, I know they are in a tough spot. Especially if they think the stock is only worth $20+$22.50 in 3 yrs. 

However as tesla has proved stocks can stay wildly overvalued for a very, very long time.

Why would Cohen want to buy this company when no one wanted it at this price in early 2019 when sales were much better?

Everyone talks about a Cohen buyout when it makes zero sense unless he wants to set his money on fire

Gold traded outside its 5 year bollinger band this week, which didn't even happen during the crash in March. Yearly RSI is lower than the crash in March. IMO a metric fuck ton of firms shorted gold this month which will result in a short squeeze soon. Gold needs to hit 2k by mid December just to rejoin the 2 year trend which it broke from on vaccine news. 

The miners all beat earning and increased dividends this month and as a result dropped 25%. Suuuuuupeer oversold. 

Even if you don't think gold is a good investment, the technicals are indicating a big recovery in December.
Just so Im clear how this works. If I were the guy with tons of money what positions would I take to short pltr?

GME is valued at $1B.

What do they have in common with GME? They are ecommerce category killers that compete with AMZN. 

I considere GME a potential category killer. Known name in their industry. 

IF COHEN can get GME to be pivot 100% into ECOMMERCE AND be successful then you are looking at potential 10 bagger here.

No argument . My theory is based on a reduction in supply.  My plan is that we buy and reduce supply by our ownership. And we just hold. We can keep options into play but make it more for them to cover. Plus i dont think they buy the stocks to cover and just hold. After the option expire wouldnt they just sell them or use them to cover next options like a pool to use from. I dont want to change the world i just want to screw citron.

Goldman is bullish on palantir. The offer to help palantir to go public in 2016-17 for a valuation of 40 billions. So I think palantir should be worth a lot more right now, if they are not pissed at palantir for going direct listing instead of going through investment bank

First of all people that buy Gucci and shat like that will continue to buy dont worry. I agree that the Revolve segment might get hurt but so far it hasn't, well not as other retailers. They crushed earning estimate by almost 100% this Q. I personally think that the people who spent money there will continue to spend and as the economy will recover they will be positioned very well

If you agree with the OP on how things will probably unfold if the stock price rises after the earnings call, then the only thing you have to resolve is how confident you are that the earnings call information will result in increased demand for the stock... right? Or are there other factors to also consider?

What information should one get familiar with in order to gauge expectations on how the upcoming earnings call needs to go (if the data from this call influences if someone wants to get in now)?

BABA has a lot of gas in the tank for a "safe" play. (also it has historically returned double digits each year it's an excellent portfolio stock)

JD is new kid on the block. Their financials are nowhere near as good as BABA but their have higher growth potential and are more of a pure B2C play than BABA.

SHOP tbh noone fucking knows. It should go up in theory but who the fuck knows with current market.

Personally for long hold it's BABA all the way IMO.
For shorter term growth without exposure to China/Trump fuckery SHOP, if you don't give a shit about said fuckery (i.e you will hold atleast 3+ months) then JD will likely have higher returns than BABA but with more volatility and stuff that comes with it. It's also more sensitive to earnings because of it's thin profit margin so keep that in mind.

Positions: Long BABA and JD

Girls make me depressed. How to stop this?
Buying pre-market is putting your buy order in when the markets are closed.  If a stock closes at 10 dollars and moves after market to $11 and you put a pre-market buy in, you will be in a queue to buy.  So you might think you are getting shares for around $11 where the after market closed at, but if there are a lot of buys in front of you...you might get in for $13-$14-$15 a share if you have a market order open.  Much smarter to make limit buys or buy when the market is open to control what you are buying in at.
Just buy the dip.

YOLO 1K first. If you make 2-3K on the YOLO, you‚Äôll feel better about parting with 7K to pay off the debt and you‚Äôll have a good base to rebuild from. If you lose the 1K, then invest safely with your 7K until you make an extra 1K and start the process from the top.

Look into AQST when you get a chance. Buy some calls. Trust me.
That‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs damn fun. I throw about 50% of what I make at VTI and maybe another 5% at playing around with calls and individual stocks. I consistently beat the 10% on VTI but my luck will run out one day and I will have built up plenty of NW value through VTI. Easy peasy

It depends on how quickly the price rises. If the price rises very quickly shorts will need to close positions, they start closing positions forcing the price up higher, chain reaction as the higher the price goes the higher the pressure on the remaining shorts.

It might not see the super spike but the price is definitely going to be driven a lot higher over the next couple of weeks/months. Retail investors are on our side, MMs are going to be in a ton of pain. This makes me happy.

Oh. Do you work at a children's dentistry? Those are the only one I know of opening weekends.

There you have it, you make enough that your wife can be a stay at home. If she worked you would get another 120k-150k in income, but I guess she will wait until they are teenagers?

My father had a reselling business for computer parts and a printing business. He literally left for work at like 8:30 and would come back home by 4:30-5. He pretend to further his education to get a engineer degree before this but never finished after 8 years. He is the laziest POS I have ever met. My grandparents took care of my siblings until the youngest was in kindergarten. They left actually thinking my father would actually get his shit together and rely relying on handouts. His parents gave him monthly money until then. In my high school days, my mother finally said he needs to close up business since it was just a money pit. He didn't want to buy conceded.

These days he is even lazier. I have no affection towards him. I really could care less if he died or not as bad as that sounds. 

My mother worked two full-time technical jobs. Before she took out a second job, her brother told her he would cover anything to make up for the financial losses if she divorced him since the house was my father's since his parents paid for it (overtime the equity in it was less and less to pay bills).
His wife?
Yea your right, it‚Äôs very different from VW, but a little similar to KBIO, since if Cohen does buy, a lot of longs will recall shares to vote, forcing shorts to cover

GME is dying bcus its a dead business model. Everyone shorted it bcus its shit. Microsoft bought up GME saving their ass. There is a ton of shorts. Shorts have to rebuy shares to avoid getting their ass railed. Hence, short squeeze to infinity.

You can prevent your broker from borrowing your shares, at least IBKR lets you do it.
Get a dog, it makes these walks even better
Yeah. This is now about 50/50 my strategy, after learning I was not smart for gambling on weeklies. As my gains grow they tend to go into LEAPS or at least things a month or to out so I don't have to piss around with watching my phone like a hawk.

I don't even let myself buy weeklies anymore; if I buy an option it has to be for next Friday, at the earliest. 

Got lots of NIO and AMC for mid to late 2021 that're making huge gains and I don't need to worry they're going to disappear during a 3 minute peak.

Everyone's out getting 'rona, I mean "holiday shopping."
You can think of it this way. There is around 140M shares currently being held by longs. There is demand for 140M shares of GME when in reality supply should only be 65M. In order for the stock to return to normal, you need 70M buyers.
That's what I do, I always try to make my life more efficient. Hell I drive without the heat on going to work in the morning even at -20. I only turn it of if my windshield frost over. Save around $10 a month on my power bill.  I also keep my thermostat at 58 overnight.

It‚Äôs probably RKT. Buffet owns Berkshire Hathaway Home Services (a Real estate brokerage). It makes sense for a mortgage company and a real estate brokerage to team up. RKT has already been testing the waters with smaller, regional brokerages, but hasn‚Äôt connected with a nationwide brokerage, like Buffet‚Äôs. I think the story goes... you call RKT, apply for a mortgage, get connected with Berkshire homes, and all the money stays in the family. They have a similar setup with Charles Schwabb too.
Congrats and yuck fou!

Damn. You‚Äôre not messing around. Nice.
I think shorter term options or closer you are to expiration date, for call options that are out of the money the premium is lower due to higher risk as there‚Äôs less time for the share price to get above the strike price. 

No problem. Don‚Äôt know much but been watching YouTube tutorials recently to learn a little more.

I think Fisker is getting slept on. Its never going to be a Tesla but I bought it for sentimental reasons, I really loved the Karma when it was first released. I suspect their car this time around will have a lot more success even though I would never want it (it's too normal, the Karma realllly stood out).

Thing is there aren't many other US pure EV plays, not like what we are seeing out of China.

Fisker has a long time until it ships a car but I will hold and see how the ride goes.
I‚Äôm balls deep in PLTR, so I wish it does, but nobody knows.
$ASAN calls for 3 reasons:  
Recently went public through direct listing, just like PLTR. I think this means they're underpriced, you get ability to buy in alongside institutionals  
$CRM buying $WORK, good for entire SAAS productivity space  
If you google ASAN, the first thing that comes up is "[Autistic Self Advocacy Network](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/)". If that's not a stock for WSB, I don't know what is.

On GME, I don't really know what im talking about, but I don't see the comparison people keep making to VW and KBIO, where single holders forced a squeeze and basically controlled the price by controlling the supply of available shares. GME is held by too many of us. We're dumping shares hard on the way up. I'm thinking we could instead see sustained buying pressure long term, like what TSLA did to shorts. Is there a better comparison? OSTK?

GME shills, am I wrong?

Yea and the senate also wont pass a single clean energy bill, we both know this.

Maybe we can blame it all on robinhood, but there's lots of money to be made on stupid people who don't understand politics.
Because it impacts their margin requirements, if say you are short 1000 shares and the price goes from 10 to 50, your initial margin requirement is multiplied by 5 (so 10.000 to 50.000) and if you don‚Äôt have the assets to back it up the broker will force market-buy you out of the position to protect itself, driving prices even higher.

So they are hedging their entire company on a basically a loan for a ps4 and Xbox? Yikes. It‚Äôs not like those things cost enough to warrant that at all.

I put 2400 on 30C jan 15 and then was up 70% on fridays spike but still up 25 right now. Hoping for a few hundred% here minimally
>Yeah this seems reasonable. Only reason I'm not starting a position is because I think it should tank, but every time there's news of increasing COVID cases or lockdown talks etc people instantly equate this to ZOOM mooning despite it's already bloated valuation. So maybe it tanks after earnings but the next day lockdowns are announced in a few states and it moons again. Basically, I think it'll drop but it's hard to time in the short term.
Wouldn't there only be seconds to sell though? What if it never hits 500 and you miss the squeeze and are left bag holding?
Look. All options account usually trend to 0. Don't do it.

I totally get this is being pumped from a social standpoint FYI. Not denying the FOMO factor. That same FOMO factor is a leg driving TSLA.
Yea I was a dumbass that held and was just so shocked when it went from 32 to 28, because I had calls expiring 11/27 and went from like 1.6k to like 395 and I was just so stupid, so I just hope for a boost for my 12/4 callsüò≠
Yea, you can exercise the option at any point or sell the option back to the market at any point before expiration date.
Scam
Yeah what happened
Don't worry they'll either lose all their money or win big and blow it all in Vegas, either way it'll be over soon
Thank you and fuck you too
Think of it as short sellers not owning any stock so when  they sell it short they have negative shares and they have to to buy it back at a later day to cover their short position. Theres a ton of short open interest so lots of people need to buy it back. If the stock has some catalyst that gives it retard strength and keeps going up, those short sellers will stop their losses and cover their short position by buying shares to neutralize their position.

If it moons but short sellers all expect it to go right back down very soon, they wont panic to cover their position, they expect to buy it back cheaper in the near future

MMs that sell you a call need to hedge against price movement of the underlying.  This can be accomplished in a number of ways.  The most common is to buy shares (usually ~20%) of the shares represented by the option.  They can also buy a longer dated or further OTM call to balance.
Then there is even less reason to do it as it doesn't gain you much time.  There is a reason the Concorde failed and it wasn't the crash.

Congrats and fuck you
Shit if I could make 1k a week following these trends I‚Äôd be set.. leeeeets Fuking goooo
Yeah if you exercised those options, and held shares, you would reduce float since you hold shares which you won't sell. But the people who sell large amount short call options usually have shares they are selling the options against, like covered calls. Which locks up those shares. Example if you had 2022 calls, the shares that represent those calls can't be sold because they're held up through the call options. Tho i guess they can be naked, but that usually doesn't happen for large investors. This is just my assumption based on how options works tho, I'm not really 100% sure, but it makes sense to me.
Nope. Im in with equities and therefore i dont care at all.

Not against any of them but to be honest I left the market when I quit my job to finish up my last year of grad school. Anything that gets momentum here I expect it to rise. I ignored the talk on PLTR and missed that. But I bought RKT and that hasn't moved at all since IPO. So it's tough to know which ones will actually move.

Watched it twice. Still pretty confused lol.
We're already here. In the solar system lol
Legit pay it off. That's like minimum 12% instant return on investment
So, the situation is similar, how?  Because you're relying on WSB to lock up 75% of the float?

Yeah.  Totally similar.
S&P price target 2060 for Zoomers?? Prolly 10,000 if we keep this QE up.

The UK is poised to become the first western country to approve a Covid-19 vaccine, with the independent regulator set to grant approval within days.

Deliveries of the vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer would begin within hours of the authorisation, according to Whitehall insiders. Individuals with knowledge of the process said the first injections could take place from December 7.

400 shares here, figuring if it end up dumping I could just sell covered calls forever until I get my money back
Do you know the outstanding shorted shares?
About to go into lockdown .... ReTaRDs with Calls On gamestop.... if your buying a game online is it from gamestop???? Or is it off of Best Buy or Amazon ?
Yeah IV crush way too common.

If you stillwanna gamble but not like a dummy...IC's on high IV earnings have been really good to me
Options have intrinsic value. If you exercise, you lose the intrinsic value. That's why it's better to sell rather than exercise.
Upcoming IPO news. I knew about PLTR since before it started trading and recommended it to my buddies when it was around $11 because it was a very well anticipated IPO.

Also Twitter has better stonk news than wsb, wsb is a laggard on things you see on Twitter weeks before. You just gotta follow the right people on Twitter.
For anyone that transferred their stocks from Robinhood to Webull, how long did it take ?
It's tradition at this point
I can't stay on gamestop. They have no reason to be pumping this much.
Nope, it's not December or even January that lockup ends. Reread the disclosure statement and do some searching thru this subreddit, everything I see says late Feb to mid March is when employees can sell their positions, but they have had back channel abilities to do it for years so there might not even be much of a sell off when it happens.

Im a noob, did this guy risk $5000 to get $285,000?

Yeah this will really help your cause. Hey guys did you see? OP wants you to stop, so stop. 
I tried
Just don't buy FDs. To make their trade neutral they buy the same amount of shares as the delta. So they delta neutral 30 delta 30 shares etc and they add
I bought at 11. Sold at 12 ;(
if you want to lock your gains without selling calls why not just short the stock and keep the calls as they are. I am not from us but i would guess that u dont pay capital gains tax in such a setup
Put it all in PLTR FDs
Should I continue to baghold OPE S? Keep waiting for the merger, but I feel like I can pick some other spac that has more news hype rn.  Yesterday brought me to about break even
I feel like they would have came to that conclusion when it was around $11ish why wait till they are totally fucked? Not saying this play won't work I'm going to buy a few shares myself just in case but they aren't stupid retail shorts they can see exactly what we are seeing and are not going to let themselves get so fucked they have to cover if it pumps to 25...30ish or maybe they are that stupid and we will all get really lucky. Either way hope it works out lol.

Not a üöÄ in sight and you expect people to listen?
GME has an >$1bn e-commerce biz that should be valued at $30/share just on that alone. This makes up 17% of overall sales, so you can see how undervalued GME truly is. GME also meaningfully participates in digital revenue now with MSFT deal, online ad rev, customer data sales.

TAM for gaming industry is exploding, so competitors is not a huge issue. GME is niche and good at what they do. Vendors like them. Just had poor management run them down for years until 2019 switched it up. 

I suggest people read their turnaround plan presentation and see how successful current management has been so far.

I'm long GME since early September with 6k+ shares at 7.16 avg
I didn‚Äôt know I could do that
GameStop is so fuckin dead I don‚Äôt know why any of you are buying GME. That shit is cap for the birds. Don‚Äôt get left holding the bag.
There has to be something happening... stock taking a nice 2-3% uptick everyday.
[removed]
You might be asking for too much
This is only true if you buy shares in a cash account.  I can assure you that RH or TD or whomever is lending the fuck out of your shares. Options volume and price both impact the share price as well.  Buying calls forces the MMs to buy shares to stay delta neutral.  Stop spreading dumb incorrect shit in all caps.
goldman sac = piece of shit
That‚Äôs compound interest mate...that‚Äôs investing.
Depends on premarket imo I sold Friday morning and waiting to get in. AMZN is my favorite because such small movements are huge returns
I honestly don't know if we will get a squeeze like VW. At some point the shorts will cover, but they will do everything they can think of to get out of their positions with minimal losses. Would I love to see $1000 a share, yes. Do I hope to see $1000 a share, yes. Will it happen? Who knows, but $100 is a reasonable amount with a short squeeze to model on. I'm playing this in a way to make money no matter what, but the squeeze to the moon is the most ideal outcome. I've been in position for quite a while and watching the GME ticker daily let's you know how bad these shorts want to keep it down and how they are running out of time, but I'm not going to bank on the moon and at the prices calls are at now someone looking to get in should have a strategy to turn a profit other than a moonshot squeeze. Now when I bought jan 15th $13 strike calls for $0.15 premiums I threw money into what I knew was a sure thing, and the squeeze is just an awesome possible outcome. I'm definitely rolling positions and holding stock for a while though, the shorts will have to cover and I'm diamondhanding till that happens.

Can't agree more. Rest of reddit is to PC or full of themselves.
It's a self fulfilling pyramid scheme.

It was flat for too long and calls were too cheap to pass up. Once I saw boomer stocks growth slow I felt it was coming back to tech. I would have 5x my account if I bought at the perfect time. I was a day late
I'm dumb and retarded but it's a long term play. I'll go back to options now and hang up my investing play.
I just own the stock outright, if the pattern is true then I'll start lookinng at long dated calls with puts around earnings.

I‚Äôd YOLO the 1k tbh
PLTR dropped, AH it was back up to at least what it was the day before?

RSI needed to be reset and the citron catalyst was perfect for large position holders to take profit, and then buy back in for a nearly 20% discount on the dip.

also, would you mind going deeper in to your decision to buy GME calls a year out? i think i sort of get it but would love to learn more. i‚Äôm getting a little confused at the idea that I am assuming GME would take a dip after holiday sales, therefore wouldn‚Äôt a call closer to the holidays (just before / after) make more sense? you clearly know more than i and made the right call (pun intended) so I‚Äôd love to understand the thinking more. and THANK YOU for sharing this

Twelve days later, he sold his 10% share of the new company back to Jobs and Wozniak for US$800, and one year later accepted a final US$1,500 to forfeit any potential future claims against the newly incorporated Apple, totaling US$2,300
$100 on roulette has me sweating tits for whatever reason but losing $1k on options in a day I dont care about anymore
Options have a gamma and a delta.

Gamma means that as the price of the underlying asset changes, the delta of the option will also change. As the delta of the option changes, MMs have to constantly buy / sell shares in the underlying asset to maintain an overall flat delta.

Yes. And Rockets

Not necessarily true for GME.  In most cases you would be correct.   But GME suffers from shorts being able to create synthetic shares almost at will.  

Also...last week I purchased 50 0.02 calls for GME (as a fun/stupid gamble).  Had I purchased 10k of these calls, would I have reduced the float by 1 million?  Because that's something any millionaire can do...just buy all the 0.01 calls to wipe out the float.   

BTW Those calls actually went up to .05 cents which I sold.
No not really. Funny enough it was my first ever stock purchase though which opened my eyes to continue to put more money in the things I believed in. I held onto one share for nostalgia purposes (now 5) with a average price of 45$

How did uk to buy?
For max profit obv itm. I think you‚Äôre confusing lots of things. Sell to close (get rid of your contract/position) ‚Äî> nothing to do anymore.  If you sell to open (you are selling the contract without having it first) then you‚Äôd need to buy the contract (premium) back). To get assigned the call is covered call / naked calls (I think? I‚Äôm not familiar with them). Someone wrote a great options for beginners, you should check it out. 

TLDR: if you only have a contract from (buy to open), when you sell to close you take your profits (or losses) and that‚Äôs it.

Just to add on to that, the number of stocks they buy is determined by the delta value of the option contracts bought. If the delta is, say, 0.2, they would be 20 stocks for each contract sold. That's delta hedging.

As the delta increases or decreases, they adjust their existing hedge to match. That's gamma hedging.

I know this is retarded, but what would it take to trade like an MM? If you had a few million bucks, could you provide liquidity to a low volume option ticker and make money off the spread, maintaining a delta neutral position?

In terms of degree of difficulty, is this almost impossible as an individual or realistic with effort?

This is the way.  Hoping for a merger date to be announced 12/4.  Went all in on Friday for 12/18 and 1/15 calls.  Only EV that hasn‚Äôt popped 100-200% in the last month.  After the ticker gets unbanned it‚Äôs gonna meme so hard.

Beyond meme potential, I‚Äôm looking at it as a long term buy and hold (gay, I know),  they have a solid business model that gives them great exposure to ride sharing companies.  I think this one is primed for liftoff üöÄüöÄüöÄüöå

It's honestly hard, but I've been getting better at it.

My AMD shares were my baby and I sold them all at the end of Aug. I also have really feelings strong feelings about CRSR and PLTR, but I made my profits there and let most of what I had go. I'm always tempted to rebuy these kinds of stocks, but I stop myself from doing it unless I think I can bank. I have 1 share of AMD, just so I can look at it and be happy.

But now, I generally buy anything that I think can make me the most money, but I'll still hold on to a couple shares of my favorite memes or attachments for sentimental reasons lmao
Didn‚Äôt look into rules prolly trash huh
Tyson. And DKNG
oh no, found an angry one
I think 40s is realistic, I don't know if you are into technical analysis but there is a gap in the chart that could be filled at $44. That's my personal target to take profits.

You could get them a big company like 1 or 2 apple/Microsoft shares each or more shares of a smaller company. Over the years there are usually stock splits so they'll likely end up with more. They might not think it's that cool now but could be very happy about it in 5-10 years. Maybe AMD would be a good choice.

I am retarded and afraid of heights. So ur question
Is dumb.
I don‚Äôt want to discourage you from donating to a charity, but that‚Äôs not how taxes work. The brackets only effect income above a certain threshold, so if that top rate is 40% starting at 100,000, only the money above 100k is taxed at 40%.

Also, if this is an employer sponsored 401k, they should already be withholding that 401k contribution from ur taxable salary meaning that‚Äôs already baked into ur tax bill.
You my friend are about too CRUSH IT! GL!

>Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and Regulation 13D thereunder require beneficial owners of more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a publicly traded company to file a report with the SEC.  
  
Probably that, but it's OP's retarded hypothetical so you'd have to ask him.
Alright, so we‚Äôve kind of established we are on the same page. That‚Äôs good. progress.

So this sub just needs to buy shares so there‚Äôs none left for the shorts to cover with
not sure if you‚Äôre playing semantics or genuinely believe trump will have enough electoral votes to remain in office
Remember that GME bought back almost 40% of all their shares. So the $50 price range of the past console cycles will be more like $70 this time.

Also GME is a much better company now moving forward.

When you buy calls, the MM you buy it from will delta-hedge his position with shares, thereby influencing the price.

Don't yolo. ONLY if you have a stable income, and low expenses, should you be willing to make risky trades even on a 5k account. Invest some in boomer ETFs just for safety, but if you're trading options be ready to lose some. But that's normal, you can't win all the time. 

Tldr get a job commie and yolo small amounts while making sure you keep expenses low

I‚Äôm just learning about this stuff too so hope this is correct. 

Expiration date means last day to either exercise the option (buy the 100 shares at strike price for a call option) or close your position (sell the call option back to the market). 

At the close of market on expiration date if stock price is above strike price I think some platforms exercise the option automatically. If stock price is below strike price at close of market on expiration date then option is worthless.

How sure are you it‚Äôs going to 30? 

More sure than you were that it was going to go higher than 46?

If so: sell your shares and buy puts for $37 you‚Äôll recoup. 

Unless you‚Äôre doubting yourself.. in which case 
‚ÄúPretty sure this is going to 30‚Äù carries more doubt than you‚Äôre voicing. 

Just buy the dip with your first thesis or buy puts with your new thesis.
Did not expect someone on wsb to ever mention the word dividend
I did my part, I bought 400 shares on friday
Each time they have done this past 3 quarter's is it's dumped, then it's silently rose. Something like 36% this year killing the sector. They have converted certain stores to hubs, half delivery pick up locations half stores. With less overhead and shorter hours they are still smashing numbers. I have been in since last year, but doubled up in my 401k when it hit low of mid 40. Long calls on this one are preferred though it's been raping me on weeklies. Slight boomer stock but will be for sure going up after this last dip.
Bro, 50k. Jesus.
Not bad 

friday doom monday moon mf
Tldr: buy calls

Agreed.  Some needed rebalancing after ‚Äútoo much, too fast‚Äù.  Personally, I‚Äôve been buying the CRSR drop.
Been wondering that myself. What would stop GME from announcing a new offering of like, a million shares, and sell then to institutions which will then cover their positions and dump on retail? That thing has been going on for too long for MMs to just stare at their screens and think of nothing.

Hindsight is 20/20, but knowing this was a console release year and looking at how GME has historically done during those years should have probably been enough for anyone to roll the dice when GME was trading below $5.

Saturday hours are common in dentistry some even on Sundayüò≥Yeah man-My wife and kids give me the motivation every morning to grind for them to be comfortable and happy. My wife is a biomedical engineer but hasn‚Äôt worked since the kids were born (lol lucky me). But I rather suffer financially for my kids to have a mom stay at home and teach them and look after them-they are doing excellent academically in large part to her. My mom and dad worked full time and I was pretty much a latchkey kid or had my grandparents look after me-it affected my future and left alot of void in my life. It sounds like your mom had quite the business mind to be the sole breadwinner for a large family like youra-btw what kind of fake business did your dad have?

Honestly, I think you're right. Pretty much every post is now about PLTR and posts not about it are spammed with PLTR comments. I'm pretty bullish on PLTR and have a heavy position (just shares) but wouldn't mind another dip on Monday just to quiet the masses.
For your sake, I hope you're right. I'll set a reminder here

Why use lot word when few do trick.
Yeah but the stocks switch out. PLTR has only been the meme stock for less than a month now.
But we were already in because we, the collective autists here, knew better than they did. We saw the potential 
 before they did. We, however, have no clout as a research/analytics company, but they do. So regardless of whether or not they are good at what they do, what they do is underhanded and is frowned upon by the majority of people. Generally speaking it's not ok to yell "fire!" in a crowded theatre, which is what they do, for their own benefit at the behest and financial loss of others who are smarter than they are. Why couldn't they have seen the indicators like everyone else did and play it straight and make their money and be a standup company? Why did they have to cause a panic? Could it be that they're immoral? I think so.

You had my support until you told me to diversify
Share holder vote.  SEC filing.  Merger or acquisition.  Hostile take over/tender offer.   Share prices growing up to $30 organically. Any of these can cause a trigger.   


At the current rate GME is going up, the squeeze will happen by the end of the year (if not sooner).  $1 increase in price every day will break the shorts within 2 weeks.  But a short attack (like what happened in Oct) can push it back a month.  That's the danger of holding calls.  The shorts have every incentive to keep this from happening.  But they are the ones on the clock and not us of we are holding shares instead of calls.  They are paying interest on those borrowed shares.  They are living each day waiting for the guillotine to drop (in the form of a catalyst).  

The console release was the catalyst we waited for.  Just let it do it's thing naturally.  Every console release caused GME to go up to ~$50 within months.  Taking into account COVID, digital download games, etc... GME can still go up to $35 all on it's own. Maybe not to previous all time highs...but conservatively $35 isn't farfetched.  But trying to force the shorts hand with reckless gambling on weeklies won't do it.  

So 2-3 weeks at current trajectory.  I have a feeling we are in a better position than in Oct because we made it to console release, money is rotating out from other meme stocks by whales, and Cohen is making waves.   That being said, don't discount a trapped and cornered animal (the shorts)...they might pull a Citron and launch an offensive to shake the paper hands.

I love the wide range of personalities on this site.

One one side you have gamblers and alcoholics celebrating paying off their 10,000 on credit card debt.

On the other side you have socialists blaming the system because they took out tens of thousands in student loans and cant afford a house.

On the other side you have someone deciding what shed to buy so they can sleep in it and save money.

And then you have this guy spending $30,000 on sprinkled flakes just because he clicked a few buttons on a phone and profited off of a rising IV.

I guess it do be like that sometimes?

To be frank : some selling on the table . I had to tell you an observation when sell off started on Friday from ATH 33, wsb went from public to private for few hours and only came back when it is at 26. So if you are in green , take some profit out. Let the price hold 30 and you can buy more when there is momentum to move beyond 33.

Just wanted to say thanks for the knowledge dump and helping us newbie retards understand the hype. I'm looking forward to finally dipping my toes in. Very much appreciated.

Quick questions...

When buying calls, essentially your losses are limited to whatever the contract cost is right? So contract price x 100?


However, when selling puts it's much riskier because a buyer can exercise said option and you then owe 100 shares to the buyer right?


Lastly, regarding buying calls, essentially the profit comes from selling the option if the underlying increases in price close to the expiry date. This seems to be the most common approach but is it more profitable than to exercise the option (buy shares then sell them) if the underlying goes above strike price? Or is selling just the option more profitable because A. it does not require the capital of buying 100 shares, and B. You can purchase multiple options contracts for more profits?

Normally yes. However saying a bunch of anonymous people from around the world suddenly coordinating is more like an unintended flash mob than coordination.

If WSB starts to hive-mind coordinate, there‚Äôs nothing the SEC can do. Not only there‚Äôs no way for them to prove who‚Äôs who, people are also from all over the world (out of reach of US jurisdiction), and even if someone is caught there‚Äôs no way they would‚Äôve known their random post on Reddit could‚Äôve worked. They‚Äôre just trying to persuade a bunch of randos on the internet to do something. That‚Äôs not coordination, that‚Äôs a flash mob.

Yeah it seems like it‚Äôs more of a PR stunt than anything. Practices aren‚Äôt usually even held on Monday and Tuesday as it‚Äôs more meetings and players go for injuries to team doctors. 

They are playing Sunday so don‚Äôt know what the monday and Tuesday really accomplishes of limiting virus if players are infected already on Sunday.
For real. This is GameStop. They sell consoles and a dying form of video games. Disks are becoming irrelevant. They‚Äôll be a console store exclusively eventually.
So what is your best, most honest to yourself, guess that GME will spike at?

I use the shitty stock steward apps and all 3 times ive placed an order at open, it lags they wait 8-12 minutes to fill my bid and in that time it surges, it places and fills bid at the top, and then it dips and i miss all the opening gains. I will never place an order at open ever again. 

I will hold my 2k this monday and watch for 15 minutes for a dip - then im bidding.

So you lost money FOMOing into PLTR, and your new plan is to FOMO into GME?

Here's a thought, maybe pick a company that hasn't been spammed about for months? Maybe one that didn't run up 200% in the months before you bought it like GME?

so, the earnings don‚Äôt have to be good to on the 8th, the guidance we get leading into Q4 from it could be enough of a catalyst even if the earnings weren‚Äôt too good. alternatively, cohen can also try to make some moves to take over the company after the 8th, which could also be a catalyst

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt mind if EV valuations are overinflated so long as you make money on both sides. Increase in population and money printing to me just sounds like less money to go around on an absolute price basis with even more concentrated towards the wealthy few. Trickle down economics is a joke and rich people aren‚Äôt going to buy 3x more Chinese EV vans per household to make up the difference.
Shares will cause the squeeze happen sooner rather than later, options could potentially make you more money. So do 50 50?

 buying call options also reduces available shares. If you have 100 call options, that's effectively reducing available shares by 10k shares. Someone will owe you 10k shares at expiration. So the short who sold you the calls will have to provide you shares which means they have to sell back to you at a loss. It's the same thing as shares more or less. Like what happened to VW. Porcha bought like 70% of shares via call options which reduces available shares since porcha can exercise and they wouldn't sell.

Ah I was thinking law or medicine. You have your own practice or you moonlighting? I never knew dental offices opening weekends. Your wife doesn't work? 230k is doable. I grew up in a single earner household (mother worked two jobs bringing in 200k -> $350k in today dollars but my father took a large share (probably 33% of it to support his fake business which never turned a profit and was used to escape fatherly duties and escape having to actually work) with 6 siblings in an affluent city in Orange County. It may suck for you personally since you aren't able to save/invest as much, but it should be still comfortable for your wife and two children.
Too bad my FPL team is fucking shitting itself.
More option noob questions: 

when you buy a call/put what is the minimum investment? Say you buy a call @3.50 that‚Äôs 100shares at 3.50 so that‚Äôs $350 investment at risk right? Or am I completely not understanding this?   

The expiration date is when you are forced to sell? But you can sell the call/put at any time before that?

Disagree. Even industries that have been absolutely fucked by COVID are way too high. 

Even airlines are only down like 20-30% this year, despite their industries basically getting assfucked in the short-term, and long-term being about "all business travel being virtual moving forward." Half of them are likely going to close their doors in the next 5 years, but their stocks only have a flesh wound.

Everything is overbought. Everything.

I appreciate your response. It's good you have a strategy and plan for study. It's hard to know where someone is over the wire, unmet, so forgive me if the generic stuff above did not add value to your current plan.

Dude please help me understand this.

When the % of shorts was let's say around 70%, do more people start shorting knowing that this might end up as a short squeeze? I guess they start shorting it confidently that maybe a squeeze won't happen but the stock price keeps going up and more shorts join in because the price went up so maybe more profit and chances of a dump? Did I get this right?

Does every stock end up having a short squeeze when the % of  shorts becomes high?

I got 30c 1/15 good shit man. We're all gonna make it
Different situation. Market dumped like crazy that week, GME followed, also there was little volume so shorts had complete control. Also that run up was mostly retail FOMO, this one actually has big buying going on. Also we‚Äôre going into this week with some good news on Black Friday sales in general in the US, GME will benefit from This. I do think next week there will be some coverings from people who shorted at 10-15 during that dump, and there should be some heavy buying. Going into ER week I think we will dip either Monday or Tuesday from profit taking, since GME earnings is always a risk. I also think we will dip after earnings somewhat
2020 Q4 earnings will likely not happen in Jan.
Hm good call
This is a little beyond what WSB is about....

How do retards get off on standing at the edge of a cliff? Do you feel euphoric because believe you wont die?
If he's in california, they'll still try to come after that I think.
Its true but i feel like this is probably priced in based on the 50% run over the past week
You must be from r/investing or a boomer if you think it‚Äôs all priced in.
I am balls deep in this stock. Not with options because it's hard to foreigners to buy calls. But I would be with Jan and Apr 21 calls OTM.

That said, I think the stock can at least double to the fair value of 30-40. And, if that happens, I'll have a hard time thinking the short squeeze won't happen.

Is there a legit concern with taxes? If he really didn't want to pay em, why not just put profits into shitcoin or other shares?

Here's the problem - just in with shares now or after earnings?  There's no way this earnings is a smashing success the new consoles aren't even in there.  I want to wait for a dip but I believe in the squeeze.
I feel like this would open up alot more legal liability. I could see the court case now ‚Äúyour honor he sent üöÄüöÄüöÄ and as we all know anything over üöÄüöÄ is market manipulation.‚Äù
I got in because retail shopping boom around holidays, earnings approaching, new console releases
I set a limit to what I will pay. There will be people who sold at after-market price. I might get lucky and grab that price. Same thing happened with PLTR few weeks ago for me.

If I don‚Äôt get the price oh well.

I‚Äôm still thinking about the dude who has 2m in NIO calls and won‚Äôt sell because taxes. Literally moving states to eeek out a little more. Had to sell some because he needed $300 for bills. It‚Äôs like ascended ‚Äòtism.

Like one said here. Happiness is reached by totally separating gambling and long term portfolios. Incl only having the wife hold the login to the longterm under her name.
So, I wouldn't count on that stimmy any time soon, not before Jan 20th for sure. And even after that, cocaine Mitch might decide he doesn't want to play ball with the people who were holding the ball over his little head just a few months prior. I hope you're able to get into a position where even if something you're invested in goes to zero you'll still be okay. My advise is make small gains until you can pull all of your initial investments out and be just working with profit. Maybe diversify and not be reliant on one stock. Just a suggestion friend, I dont want to see anyone struggling during the holidays.
As far as the meme is concerned .. the volume dropped dramatically and the crazy gains sentiment is slowing. People are way more hesitant to hop in for the short term. Long term, I agree definitely going to be a top contender in the tech world

Hypersonic flight is literally retarded. You can already get anywhere in the world in 24 hours. You want to increase risk 100x to get there in 12 hours instead once you add all the logistics? Your local 20 gate airport isn't going to have hypersonic flights. So unless you live in a major city you are still going to need to make a connection. And there will still be security (like 2 hours at a major airport). Possibly even more because a hypersonic craft is a weapon in itself, moreso than a regular airliner. And you can't go hypersonic anywhere near a major city so you will have large portions of your flight at normal speeds. And hypersonic aircraft are far less flight worthy at slow speeds (think take off and landing), which is the most likely time to have an accident so your chance of dyimg are yet higher.. Still have all the logistics of luggage, travel to airport.  Unless you have your own hypersonic aircraft and airport the dream of getting anywhere in the world in 90 minutes will always be just a dream.

jokes aside, this market has literally priced in the best case covid scenario across the board. Full recovery, no shutdowns, widespread vaccines, employment slingshot recovery, stimulus, economic boom.

Only options are "maintain with good news" or "drop with bad news."

Trade price action. The rest doesn't matter. Price is the key definer in everything even mrmoneymustache said so!
A covered call is a financial market transaction in which the seller of call options owns the corresponding amount of the underlying instrument, such as shares of a stock or other securities. If a trader buys the underlying instrument at the same time the trader sells the call, the strategy is often called a "buy-write" strategy.

More details here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covered_call

If pltr goes to 90 like everyone here says it will I won't even need that!

It's only if it goes to 0 I may have a bit of an issue.
I beleive you will recover by wednesday by just holding the shares. However opportunity exist to make another 2.45 share as i dont beleive it passes 35 by 12/11. So if your shares do get called away you make 35-31= 4+ 2.45 = 6.45 share profit if it hits 35. Win win in my book.

On the Canada one I saw a thread about what method to use to heat their house in the winter.  I cant imagine being that tied down by practicality.
Yes, my shares are for sale at a minimum of $1000 until I cancel it pretty much. Since my shares are for sale they also cannot be used by short sellers to borrow and sell.
 If the company is set for bankruptcy, then why would Microsoft parnter with them and offer they royalties on their sales?

Well orchestrating market manipulation on large  scales (e.g. a pump and dump) is illegal and I think this treads close to the line if it‚Äôs facilitated by say the mods or a group designed for that singular purpose like a separate subreddit. That being said spreading the info isn‚Äôt. Either way, borderline illegal is generally very lucrative so load up.

It's an interesting conversation with these three. I work at one of the big 3 cloud providers which work heavily with splunk and snowflake. I also have a data engineering backgroun. Splunk has a market cap of 32B and snowflake is 90B. Snowflake is definitely big and a lot of companies are using it. I do think it's a bit overpriced to be honest, but I could be wrong. If PLTR actually does what it says it does, successfully, it should be worth more than snowflake, especially if it begins to partner with Azure, GCP, and AWS. The value of unstructured data integration and interpretation is huge, but I'd have to see exactly how they are doing it to be a good judge of character. I'm optimistic about all three companies for sure, based on their use-cases.  Splunk has good competition which makes it less valuable in my eyes, like data dog. The world of data integration is a tougher problem to solve, which cloud providers have addressed, but still limited due to their inability to put tons of resources into just that problem. Companies like oracle and SAP do this, but they are clunkier/lagacy (however SAP is EVERYWHERE) Hadoop tools do this, but with a lot of manual work. I'm definitely keeping my eye on PLTR (and holding) to see if they live up to their promises because the upside can be huge. with a market cap of 50B, I could see it doubling if they are very good at what they claim to do.
So what calls did you get üëÄ

A short squeeze is when gay bears get super gay and get what they deserve. They all have to buy to cover their short which drives the price up / squeezes other gay bears to bite the gay bear bullet and do the same. Silly bears

The FDA decides on approving Pfizer's vaccine on Dec. 10th. If its approved, we should expect another 15-20% day for recovery stocks. The question becomes: do we think that there is a greater than 50% chance of approval? Based on the 90%+ effectiveness, I'm led to believe yes. Thoughts?

Technical risk is priced in. That's why low market cap. If no ris then market cap would have been already pricing in commercial operation and would be sitting at 30 bn

Sure you too. If you want to better understand this phenomena I recommend reading numbers 9 & 11 here https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/hcja2q/the_ultimate_quick_resource_for_the_amateur_trader/ particularly number 11.
And if they wanna pump and dump at least make the sub or post private and give us a strategy for when to dump. Not just ‚Äúbuy this stock it‚Äôs totally good trust me guys I looked into it.‚Äù Too many people have gotten burned on this sub from shit like that and it‚Äôs been going on ALOT lately. I won‚Äôt even buy a stock if it gets hot in this sub anymore.

Had a 565/570c tsla spread let it expire friday for assignment (less fees that way on TD; assignment has no fees)

they're both ITM so as expected i bought shares at 565, but to my surprise, did not sell at 570. i wonder why, did the other guy not want to get his shares? this is good for me (a 1500$ gain) but i'm cautiously optimistic. either there's a mistake or the other guy knows something i don't (like is tesla going to tank hard on monday, better not)

I could sustain it without tenants for around 2 years before I'd have to liquidate the actual properties. The net cash flow is pretty good as I'm in a high-yield area.

Worst-case scenario, property values decrease 40%, I'm left without tenants for 2 years, and I have no way to get a job again to keep up with mortgage payments and in that case I'd have to liquidate.

I cant even tell if this is satire or not anymore
Iv crush happens around earnings and other major events. Volatility rises when the direction of a stock is uncertain. Volatility will cause your options to gain value. When earnings gets reported the stock can drastically rise or drop based on the report. After earnings the direction is no longer uncertain and volatility drops drastically causing options to lose value. Even if the stock rises your options could fall in value. 
Many people sell their options the day or two before earnings are announced to take advantage of the IV.

Because after 15 years being gainfully employed as a software engineer I have rarely actually needed to implement those algorithms from scratch on the spot while someone watches me type, it's not an accurate representation of how software engineering is practiced.

no way at such undervalued pricing; Q4 ER will be good from just the artificial accounting increase in margins due to BaaS alone; but in the long term BaaS is going to create recurring revenue even from Nio owners that bought their cars 10 years prior. imagine if Tesla was collecting monthly subscription money from 30% of all Tesla owners since they IPO'ed

It's been shilled here for a long time, people forgot though until its recent run. A lot of us have been holding leaps and shares for quite a while. Don't be discouraged if it dips this week. Shorts aren't gonna be happy that this broke $16 and are gonna want to get people to dump it. Last time when we hit $15, GME got destroyed for a while, dropping down to 10.50 before making this recent rally. We must stay the course and buy dips

Big if true!!! I‚Äôm in
Not necessarily. Most of the market makers selling such options will have to hedge (due to very stringent risk management measures) by buying the underlying (stock), so this pushes up the price.

From the POV of the market maker, they will make money as long as the underlying goes up, and they also have a buffer (your premium that you pay) that guards against some downside risk of the underlying. In other words, hedging allows them to have both limited upside and downside, as opposed to unlimited downside (I.e. naked calls).

The reason why the VW squeeze isn't possible is because for VW you had 2 companies that owned over 95% of shares....they said they wouldn't sell. In GME you have dozens of institution and a huge portion of retail. The chances people sell is higher. Also with HALT they would just halt gme every $10  up if they catch it and and more people who own shares will sell.  Just my opinion tho
I‚Äôll be with u

fair point. it's neither inevitable nor guaranteed during the immediate future.

what makes this a prime time to get in is:

* short squeeze fundamentals are still there
* potential catalyst: new console generation release historically pumps GME
* potential catalyst: earnings/guidance on 12/8
* potential catalyst: Cohen swings his dick around a bit
Should I set a sell limit order? And if so what price?

How briefly will the squeeze happen? 5 min? 5 hours? 5days? Don‚Äôt wanna miss it
The human population in 2007 was 6.6 billion people. In 2020 it‚Äôs estimated at 7.8 billion. By 2025 it should be well over 8.1 billion people. More people means more money more transportation more shipping. Especially how e-commerce has transformed the entire world since 2007. It may seem overvalued to you because those valuations are not accounting for the overpopulation of the world. In order to keep the world from chaos and hyper inflation more money has to be in circulating which is why I feel like these valuations are being justified by investors.

Still waiting on this bs yall speak of. Lots of hype but I'm not impressed yet
That‚Äôs a pretty weak sauce argument my dude
I do not. Care to share?

I was talking about past experience with calls, I think it was for Apple. Buying shares for GME and hope we get to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
TSLA is at its all time high.

NIO can rip from a $58 (ATH) to $65 breakout pretty fast. Results of the vehicle deliveries, as long as it surpasses 5,400 for the November month, extremely bullish if it goes above and beyond 5500-6000 deliveries per month would be insane.

Also sometime in March their ER that includes new gen consoles gets released, and so far everytime that has happened (ps3, ps4 release) gme goes to 40

He/she has no actual idea. Just likely wants to be contrarian because they dislike the idea of meme stocks. Plus they also already admitted to having a short position. 

My guess is the governments and institutions buying 10s of millions of shares know more, and this person is sweating about their short position backfiring and trying to create more panic selling.

imo order doesn't matter, coin on the spectrum of risk is pretty far to the right, so coin down means de-risking is happening, meanwhile gold is signaling, while TLT has been making steady gains this month.

not that we're going straight down or anything, but de-risking is going to happen eventually. The bullish case is DXY continuing downtrend, I'll hold longs until this reverses, but I'm trimming.
This is the way

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/palantir-insiders-struggled-to-sell-shares-because-of-software-glitch-.html

Employees and alumni of Palantir can use the Shareworks platform that Morgan Stanley provides for share sales since PLTR listed on the NYSE last month. 

One of the benefits of debuting with a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO is that existing investors can sell some shares rather than waiting for a typical 180-day lockup to expire.

If there was big insider selling it didn't show since going public.

I did look at using splunk at a previous job but decided against it. PLTR certainly has a splunk type data ingestion/storage layer in their stack, I think it would be impossible to offer the end product that pltr does without it. At the time I looked at splunk they were mostly advertising log data capture and analysis from devices like routers and network equipment for threat analysis and auditing. I would guess they have expanded that options by now
CRSR! CRSR! CRSR! CRSR! CRSR! CRSR! CRSR!
options make the market makers buy the underlying stock, therefore affecting the price. Probably more than you could do with buying stocks. If you buy 100$ stock, thats that. but if you put 100$ in calls, the underlying stock value will be much higher than that, and thats what the market maker will buy. (correct me someone if I'm wrong)
There's no loophole.

That's when I got in, courtesy of this post (user deleted?):https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jq3om2/ely_callaway_golf_golf_during_pandemic/

Bought shares at the time because I was in a hurry and didn't want to try to time options, so I got the move but didn't leverage it as calls.  Still, after spending some time with it, I think the value this merger is going to create isn't priced in.  The market has had such a run in November that I expect to see some form of pullback in the next week or two, and it's on my list to add to the position if/when that happens.

And to be honest, Given November's run, I'm not sure there are many items left in the stonk bargain bin.  Pullbacks happen.  Make your list and be ready.

Friday was market manipulation by Citron, a company that bought short positions on PLTR, then Tweeted it would drop. Who stood to gain by that drop? People who shorted PLTR, hmm ü§î Also with the direct listing they got to set their own price and I believe WAY undervalued it so there would be forward momentum before lockup ends next year. If your portfolio can't handle at least one down day a week you should probably get out of options all together, but there's no reason to not be bullish on PLTR, especially long term.
PUT HIM IN A BODY BAG!
So in a nutshell, is it healthy to wait until couple of weeks before the orig investors selling their positions because of the potential Bearish on those days?

short squeeze not happening, it‚Äôs prime for bankruptcy, which will soon be announced, shorting is the play you should be in.
I see that you are able to correctly interpret basic business analysis. 

What are you doing in this subreddit?

A hit job on nio essentially "because model y", when demand for tesla was down and their lowering price of model y to remedy this didnt have an effect on nios deliveries after the first price drop, ok!

I'm down for any company to shit on a stock, take the hindenburg article, but having a huge audience to just say a stocks value is going to drop more than 50% because of teslas model y.

Shitron is cringe, at least hindenburgs document on nikola was vast and substantial, backed with evidence, unlike a 2 page word document made by a pa under 5 mins?

"I'm shorting nio because the other company tesla,  which I'm also shorting has a car (model y) is just better" - this isn't good research that anyone should listen to.

Headlines are impactful and can kill a stock and they know this.

taking shares out of the float will help set up the squeeze better. although MMs will usually buy about 20% of shares to hedge a call so if you can do 5x calls for the same price as shares, go for it.

personally I've got some shares already and will probably pile in on some LEAPs this week if PLTR cools off and i take some profit

Wrong. If two autists walk into an auction bidding for a pile of shit, they can drive the price of shit to all time highs. For example:

Auctioneer: we will begin the price at 20 dollars

Autist 1 shouts: 50 dollars

Autist 2 shouts 80 dollars

Autist 1 shouts 150 dollars

Autist 3 walks in and shouts 1000 dollars

The auctioneer yells SOLD

&#x200B;

Just like that a successful bid at 1000 dollars is made, driving the price of shit up over 4,900%. JPM, Citron, Goldman Sachs, Vanguard, etc all bitterly shout -- BUT IT'S SHIT, IT'S NOT WORTH THAT MUCH. In the same breath Autist 3 turns around and asks who wants his 1,000 dollars of shit? 100 more autists pile into the room and all begin screaming higher and higher prices.

GME is going to let us all down, isn‚Äôt it?
I got the impression that they and the large search providers optimize for worst case 1%, "one of our core search algorithms suddenly performs poorly, go debug it"

Those type of problems are all algorithmic in nature, so for PLTR, Google, Amazon or any company that relies on fast accurate search for information discovery I think that an algorithmic interview reveals a lot about the candidate and give them a pass on prioritizing that skillset. 

But for the other 95% of software engineering positions a focus on textbook algorithms results in passing on a ton of great engineers who might not be able to reverse a linked list or implement djikstras from memory. I do find that most engineers could acquire that type of knowledge fairly quickly.

There might be some concern because they will reach a point where their hosting costs will choke their revenue.  But this is way off, and i am big believer in PLTR (9.90 was my price), security and data will be big for a long time. But Amazon, Microsoft, and google own the compute / storage for now.

PLTR is a nice confluence of "haha memes" and "HYPE, BILLIONAIRE FOUNDER WHO USED TO WORK WITH MUSK" and "this company is literally a puppet of major governments and their intelligence/information-gathering tech is terrifying from the perspective of an average person but has a 10-trillion marketcap by 2050 when considering what it can actually do", which is more impressive than the logic behind people dumping money into TSLA which is mostly out of a deranged belief that Musk will use it to fund electric spaceships. PLTR will always have business, because the CIA and Pentagon will always want to spy on your browser history.
Not sure.  Maybe on the actual website?  Webull makes it easy, and thats where my shares are.

If more than 100% float is short doesn't it mean more than 100% is also long. So it would be difficult to find buyers if the stock goes down.

I'm actually a Nio Bull. I agree with the foresight. I also am excited for Nio Day; positioning for the momentum two weeks prior as I see a run-up. 

Seeing Nio swap batteries is a thing of beauty. The  BaaS program is great. They're stranglehold is real and love the plan of battery subscription and putting these swap stations at strategic highway exits. Also local Chinese govt is buying Nio vehicles. I think these are all legit differentiators.

But your situation is unique, even with a heavy bullish bias, I still would trim profits, maybe 30%? Some trimming address both ends: you're still long while securing profits.

At least over 370. Good chance of hitting 380. As we break more resistances there‚Äôll be less sellers and we‚Äôll start rising faster. Upper limit would be $400-$410. When we break through $380 I‚Äôll start to slowly take profit on calls.

Won‚Äôt be able to help with the current situation, but next time you can close the leg even though they aren‚Äôt recognized by robinhood as a spread. Just go into the tesla option chain, and go to the top right and click select. This will let you close more than one option at once. If you click sell on your long and buy on your short leg, you can close it like a spread. Your total will be cost of long subtract cost of short leg.

You can just as well say that buy riding a balloon. Tthere us no dividing line between the atmosphere and space. Even the International Space Station experiences atmospheric drag and needs to reboot itself to avoid falling out if orbit.

[ISS Orbital Height vs. Time](https://heavens-above.com/OrbitHeight.aspx?satid=25544)


Since there is no line, it makes more sense to only say you are in space if you are in orbit. SPCE is a decade away from being able to send humans to orbit. 

SPCE doesn't go to space. There is a reason John Glenn was hailed as a hero just as much if not more than Alan Shephard. Shephard and Gus Grissom didn't orbit. Glenn did. 

Technically we're all already in space on a massive spaceship called Earth. That's pretty rad. I don't need to risk my life for that.

I've been an active investor and trader for over 26 years now. As a newbie I am sure you are aware by now at just how much reading one needs to do to do proper DD. But I'll be honest, I always turned to stock research companies as my first step for a great set up. There is just no other way to go about finding leads. Why? Because that's what everyone is doing. Sure you could find hundreds of undervalued companies, but without the blog hits no one else is going to find that special company you bought on the dip, you could ne waiting MONTHS before you see any movement. Yet everyday there is a stock up 100%. What a waste of time.

That being said, there are good stock researchers, and bad stock researchers, and it's hard to sift through the sand to find the gold. Citron looks like gold, but everytime I have taken their advice I have lost thousands. Citron is fools gold. They waste your time trying to find the real truth. They always end up doing the inverse of their advice so they can profit off of your blind allegiance. Take it from me, a self made millionaire investor, inverse citron. Or better yet, ignore them. They are always so wrong.

True. But remember that even if a merger completely falls apart the SPAC model means price can only fall to $10, limited upside on puts.
I bought after-market.. order should be processed as soon as the market opens. Price will open higher Monday so I bought in now.

I hate you because I'm not you
I specifically said not that statistic because it‚Äôs true for now. It also completely glosses over how many have been infected. .08% would be insignificant if 330 mill Americans got it, but they didn‚Äôt. 

So onto your lie that you didn‚Äôt want to back up ‚Äúmore people dying from economic consequences‚Äù. You think more than 260k Americans have died on top of Covid because the economy took a turn in the last 9 months? ü§°

Where‚Äôs your facts for that retard? None. There are not facts to back up that ridiculous statement.
Because they're currently pumping the stock so they can get out with maximum profits and go short?

Unless you have a better idea? I'd love to hear it.
Fair enough! I literally can't see anything to justify it going up.

https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-ipo-lockup-period-and-how-do-you-trade-it--191018

"The end of a lock-up period sends a strong signal about the confidence the largest shareholders have in the company‚Äôs prospects. If institutional investors decide to dump the stock once the lock-up period ends, then this suggests they have little faith that the company is worth holding. If a relatively small number of shares are sold by these investors, then this shows they want to retain the shares and are bullish on the stock‚Äôs prospects."

For 17 years this company has decided to stay private, and avoid short term profits for long term goals. Their approach of focusing on people and creative solutions instead of the fast track to go public will pay off in the long run. 

Palantir Technologies pays its employees an average of $124,703 a year.¬†For the third quarter of 2020 and the first public earnings report, the company reported an operating loss of $847.8 million due to an $847 million charge for stock-based compensation.

Given time and dedication, doesn't faith come naturally?

TLDR: Good.

Kind of what all the PLTR pumpers in this sub do
Yeah, the issue is tipping itself. Fucking pay people enough to want to live and not die. Sad state but it's true.
I am definitely not doubting you. This is why i put it in discussions. All this talk about  "to the moon". I wanted to formulate a strategy . Something more then impulse buying 0dte.

Are there some good EV plays that haven't run up yet in price?
you will make enough to buy out Playstation
I agree but it seems like a nice loophole is all.

Also you might be able to go with a 5k bankroll and still get returns that keep you interested. So maybe shoot for a 3x return instead or maybe 3 50% returns in a row even (those are a LOT more common).

Then from 5k to 30k its a 6x over the course of a year and that is doable as well vs having to try for a 40x shot all at once.
I think this is fairly reasonable

What made you decide to YOLO the 20k on this stock ? I‚Äôve had plenty of friends who‚Äôve yolo‚Äôd this much in piss poor tickers like this and then lost it all. Or is that you speculated that the money printer would eventually spill over any name eventually? (It did )

Wtf is with retards ignoring profitable US companies like Cresco labs in favor of hugely in debt Canadian companies?
Normal person takes out a million in loans for a PHD in memes and then demands loan forgiveness. Bugfuck crazy gamblers take out a million in loans and bet it all on a meme in hopes of making 2 million dollars before selling their bag to a sucker to hold.
Yeah man it‚Äôs like I go to the front page of WSB and there‚Äôs 0 threads about PLTR amirite??
I‚Äôve been trading options for about 9 months now and still haven‚Äôt graduated to writing/selling calls and puts. Always confused on if I need to own 100 shares in order to do so and how much collateral you need. Probably safer that I don‚Äôt but feel it‚Äôs the next level to making more money through options.
Awesome job üëç

Real question is what kicks are you going to treat yourself to when you cash out?
With all of these joke titles I'm honestly wondering how many degenerates who only look at the titles are going to think WSB is actually done with PLTR and bail early.

Given his recent take on the air industry, I'd say Boeing is definitely off the table.

I'd probably toss Discovery or Verizon in that mix.  Discovery might be too small, though.

And there are some interesting candidates in insurance, and Buffett loves that shit.
I sold 2 calls at open on friday for like 2.80 each. ( already had the shares )

So i got 560 american dollars. 

Stock was dropping so i bought 1 25p for like 1.50

Then i bought another otm call for like 2.00

Means i have about 200 cash left. I bought the calls back i had sold for  .9 at close.

So im down slightly on the shares, but the put is up. And i can again sell calls close to the money for another 500-1k and put that premium into more calls.  If it moons i get exercised but my otm calls are banging at this point.  If it tanks the otm calls go to 0 but i am mitigating my lose by being short calls.

I may sell a cpl 20p also here at shitrons price target and buy calls w that also.

So double down on life.

Don't move out pouting, waltz the fuck out with your dick hanging out your zipper and go do something she'd never do with you like a week long camping trip in bumfuck nowhere or something.

If your parents start dragging you into their fight, tell them to shit or get off the pot; that you're not going to be the crab in the bottom of their barrel. They need to fix what they've got going on or get something new.

It sounds callous but it's not. Misery loves company, and just playing a passive role in your own or other people's misery is participating in it and perpetuating it. Shoo them dickbirds off and play to win.
Not sure where I would have used the word ‚Äúand‚Äù. Certainly not in a sentence like ‚ÄúPLTR and GME‚Äù because whatever money I was putting in GME could be going into PLTR instead.

We need to pile more retards into the market. It's not pretty, but profits have to come from somewhere and it's much easier to beat newbies and FOMOers than seasoned traders and groups with billions of dollars

Brilliant. This, and the üöÄ dds is what I come here for. Thank you for your service.
From what i know, when you buy a call your brokers buys 100 shares to make himself safe, so in case the stock really ramps up, he wouldnt have to buy shares at a high price and so wont lose all that money.Might be bs tho.

Yep - Basic trading psychology here - keeping it all in will pretty much guarantee the next trade won‚Äôt work so well.  I would take some gains - especially since that thing is going to trade sideways now.

Yes.  Most likely they will once they come to the conclusion that their short position is finished.   

The shorts are probably biding their time and seeing if they can cause another drop (like in Oct).  But IIRC large option purchases are already being made (a huge put order was purchased for March...I'll have to dig through posts to find it).

Where are you?
Been shitting on gme lately but I'm bored and the gme squeeze comments are kinda annoying. So earnings on dec 8, they have gone up almost 200% since last earnings and console sales will not be accounted for on these earnings explain how it doesn't dump without using the word short?

You're right. It's actually .08% of us population.
I'll have u know that the palantiri were crafted by the elves and were used to communicate over long distances to fight the forces of morgoth and sauron.

They're not inherently evil, but falling into the wrong hands make them dangerous.

if a short squeeze were to happen, who would even be buying the calls that went from $300 to $50k+ (in the event of a squeeze to 600/share)? Wouldn't they just wait? Or would it be realistic that enough people would buy those contracts in order to exercise and sell the shares?

Yea the decision I have to make is, do I want to be disciplined and increase my chances of making my money back but in a slower fashion, or do I wanna risk this last 1.5k and try to get a head start on making it back with a yolo, I‚Äôll see. 

Yea I think LEAPS are the move, gonna try and build up 10k first tho. 

Not sure about that question regarding the wash sale rule. If I had to guess I‚Äôd say prob has to be the same exact instrument for the rule to be applicable, but that‚Äôs a guess at best.
Yes then we killed another whole crew in 2003. Hate to break it to you but people actually in the astronaut corp are different than you or me. They know they are risking their life and dedicated their entire life to being an astronaut knowing that risk.

Punishing our politicians for profiting off of non-public information and steering public policy toward whatever would be most profitable to them personally would probably be better.  

I mean, I serve as a volunteer board member for a small local not for profit and I have to disclose any conflicts of interest.  But our politicians are allowed to do whatever they want
The market is already expecting an awful earnings.

Scat clips exists. Even on a vanilla website like twitter.
Your fucking generation simped for the the powers that be and got your labor rights get eroded away by big corporations like suckers. I bet you kissed the foremans hand when he decided to extend you a measly shoveling job. If we millenials dont like a job we either demand to it be made suitable or invite the employer to try doing it by themselves. Also, ive worked construction for many years and hard physical jobs, difference is they dont pay shit but still break your back just like the good ol days. Maybe if you showed some backbone and stood up for yourselves like the workers in the 30's did, the corporations would have not wiped their ass with the social contract and i would be getting a fair wage right now and have a house and family worth standing in the cold for. I dont know you and you might be a good guy but dont glorify your eating with a smile whatever shit the powers that be handed you and expect me to be impressed.

Montrose use to be a warzone now it‚Äôs become a quaint spot for millennial restaurants. I should of bought land there when I had the chance but that‚Äôs when I use to tip...

That's because you don't need to know any of this shit.

Knowing this shit just you makes you hesitant in the beginning of the fomo because it makes you 'think' the contract is too expensive, because you're subconsciously stuck in previous option pricings. 

"Oh lord if it only goes up 3% tomorrow I lose money"

Meanwhile the said stock goes up 20% and you realize you woulda made 400% anyway.

You're either right or wrong. 

Generally at 10% out strike,

Weeklies are 1-30 leverage

Monthly is 1-10 leverage

Yearly leaps can be like 1-5. or barely double.

As in for every 1% move, that's how much the contract moves. The amazing thing is unlike forex which is also known for insane leverage, the worst that can happen to you is 0.

If you're just longing calls or puts, that's all you need to know. If you're looking at something more complex, don't bother.

Nothing beats long calls during fomo weeks.

Clearly the autists on this sub know nothing about Buffett if your guesses are Tesla and PSTH. Buffett and Musk are basically enemies. They hate eachother insofar as Buffett who avoids all conflict at all costs can be publicly feuding with someone. Tesla is also far from a value stock company. PSTH is also not going to be it. Why would Buffett, the best investor in the world, give his money to someone else to YOLO on an undefined company thinking about IPOing. If he wanted to scoop up a company on the private market he could just buy it cash.

Palantir is incredibly unlikely but maybe not the most unlikely of the 3. Still pretty damn unlikely though given his avoidance of new tech.

I would guess maybe Visa, Disney, Google or an outside chance of Boeing.

My favorite way of dealing with it is just to carefully select counters that are so blatantly obvious that even an adolescent child can intuitively understand them.

Just post them in reply, and let them embarrass themselves trying to refute it, and don't make any further counters. They'll eventually publicly shame themselves to the point where other friends and family start ostracizing them and have to change the cut of their jib or lose everyone.
Solid dd
Oh fuck you‚Äôre right
I think conspiracies appeal to the lower IQ and less knowledgeable. It's incredibly hard to attain an extremely high level of understanding in almost any field since humanity has piled so much knowledge up from generation to generation. You either have to be gifted beyond belief or devote hours and hours of study to become an expert on something.

Everyone thinks they're above average intelligence though and know better than the "next guy". Conspiracies are great because they give you the delusion of having access to a deeper or truer level of understanding that few possess and provide proof of your superiority.
4% loss when it‚Äôs up 157% in the past month is hardly a beating. Rounding error.

I see them as intrinsically linked. If we‚Äôd have taken it serious culturally from the start and gotten people in masks and being careful the economy would be better for it through being able to open up more businesses. Instead we did the worst of both choices (shutting things down while half assing behaviors).  Now we‚Äôre in the tough spot of many businesses being fucked but staring down a potential million deaths if we open up everything.

A share is shorted more than once. 

If one borrows a GME stock from an institution and then sells it for another institution, now we have 2 institutions long at the same share.
this is the answer. not even on a dip though.  Half these people will dip out and profit take at $20 if a squeeze starts.

He is correct in that users should pay for the service they enjoy. If they aren't willing to pay, it's probably not a good service. Twitter's stock will take a hit when they attempt to transition toward subscription. They're working on a secret project right now called Gryphon that is attempting to get the subscription details right.

I disagree with your buddy's assertion that people have a problem with "all these streaming services." I think they get tremendous value between Netflix/Hulu/YouTube for a fraction of the price of cable. 

Also your friend is probably a retard just so you know. like, actually definitely. Google is super helpful and if you can type decently fast you can find out anything you want in the entire world. Stop listening to your friend and start getting autsitic.
This is absolutely correct. My devils advocate argument-Cohen and company have 10x (minimum) fire power of the WSB collective. He‚Äôs not dumb and knows he has these guys strung up by their nuts. He‚Äôs playing the squeeze.Stock price goes down, I would buy on the dip to protect the investment, short term at least. He has them SWEATING and close to folding....I don‚Äôt think he gives in....it‚Äôs to close to being on the brink of breaking... this is just my opinion.
I hope you all you retards are buying PLTR puts.

Correct. They have been closing positions over the last month. 

I think it needs to pump to over $30 with high IV to kick this bitch off. 

We are half way there with the 27% boost in the last week. If we boost this like PLTR it will burst in short order.
If I got that much money every month I would tell my boss to go fuck himself.  I actually really like my boss too.  But when you got the fuck off cash I be tellin people to fuck off.
From their blog post on Medium: 

Palantir is not a ‚Äúdata broker‚Äù or ‚Äúdata aggregator.‚Äù

Unlike many tech companies, our business model is not based on the monetisation of personal data. We do not collect, store, or sell personal data. We don‚Äôt use personal data to train proprietary AI or machine learning models to share or resell to other customers. We never facilitate the movement of data between clients, except where those specific clients have entered into an agreement with each other.

Palantir is a software company.

We build digital infrastructure for data-driven operations and decision making. Our products serve as the connective tissue between an organisation‚Äôs data, its analytics capabilities, and operational execution. Palantir‚Äôs platforms tie these together by bringing the right data to the people who need it, allowing them to take data-driven decisions, conduct sophisticated analytics, and refine operations through feedback. We license this software to organisations, who receive secure and unique instances of our platforms in which to conduct their own work on their own data.

Chwy‚Äôs last earnings had a big run up about 10 days before earnings which was partly due to the GameStop news i think.

Then go in with a long term strat, you have the knowledge so there is no need to yolo.

Also those 2 month position can still turn to shit so the sooner you can move into leaps or stock itself as the reward the better off you will be.

Any idea if the wash sale would apply if you sale deep ITM calls then move that cash directly into stocks? Or does it only apply to the exact same instrument.

Do you not understand what a true short squeeze is? by this comment I can tell you don't, not if but when this thing squeezes the price will literally not make sense. Look at KODK earlier this year for an example.. this thing will go fucking bonkers,1k very possible

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

btw, kodk only had 20% short interest, this has \~130%
Can happen
Big crazy
Easy solution depending on where you think stock price will be in 1 - 2 weeks. Using 35 strike price as example. STO 12/12 35c for current prem of 2.45. So if you paid 31 for shares your cost basis would be 28.55. Stock closed after hours at 28.30. Please note week of 12/31 orig investors are allowed to sell their positions. Look for price drop some the week before. So i believe your 35cc would be safe from getting shares called away.
0 correlation my guy

I‚Äôll save you time and help you make a lot of money over the next few months with this three step guide:

2.) Hold the shares. Feel free to look out the window and see the stars as you ride the üöÄ to the moon.


3.) Tendies, post gain porn, make fun of the gay bears.
I don't know if there's above 24 pricing in the horizon, but I definitely think there's above 16.44/share this holiday season.
Assume Christmas week and beyond is out, no one wants to deal with this shit in Holiday times. At latest should be week of 12/14...meaning news of the date next week?!

>$1000 might be high, but $100 is not. With the amount of short positions  that will have to cover there is not enough stock available to purchase. So if it starts to get out of hand you'll basically be able to dictate the price. I've got a limit sell placed at $1000 a share just in case, if someone has to buy ill have it available.

It comes from the fact of those who deal with : finding out they got fake friends and or family since money came in the picture, it came from those who thought they would earn status and get disappointed because it‚Äôs not hyped to what it‚Äôs supposed to be. It comes from those that thought they felt that their underlined value in life would be full filled and yet still failed.

Probably not too long anymore. Social media allows like minded people to congregate. Unfortunately this cuts both ways in terms of intelligence.

This report is misleading. The Finra reporting on shorts sold is generally not speculative short sellers, but rather market makers trying to provide liquidity for traders. Most of these are covered as soon as possible and it's not a good indicator of short interest.
The filings are disclosed with a delay, in a hard to find, hard to track, and hard to sort manner.  We take on the organizational and administrative burden so you don't have to.

The conversation around the Pelosi CRWD report originated from [congresstrading.com](https://congresstrading.com) a few weeks ago. We watermarked this one to ensure future conversations about BEEM are correctly attributed to it's original source of further attention - congresstrading.com

No way, those are way more than doable. Should‚Äôve already happened but the market got manipulated. I‚Äôm not sure if you know but 60+% of PLTR is owned by us (general public) from what happened on Friday. We have the majority now, and a few corporations have the rest. We control the price, just hold and you‚Äôll get your gains. But when you sell those calls, just know you‚Äôre limiting the stock from going over that $35 cap. Profit off the calls and buy more stock. That‚Äôs the only way this will rocket.

ELY- Calloway Golf.  They took a massive hit when they bought TopGolf.  They've recovered most of that, but TopGolf is a great re-opening play that also unlocks value and gives real growth prospects for ELY going forward.

This one still has room to run.

Correct. Hidden expense in other words.
We're going to be seeing as high as 4k dead per day in the US within the next month.
They spiked on the sept 18th announcement and fell right back to $10.  Take luck, they don't appear to have support at the current level.  But if they pull back a bit, i'll hit it with full retard strength.
if you're worried about feeling depressed today, I know it is very hard to do so, but you have to get the ball rolling. And that means to DO things. Not think about them, just fucking do it. Decide for yourself that you're doing it because it's the right thing to do, and you're in charge. Doesn't matter if you've had a hard day, or didn't sleep that well, you're still going to actually do things. You get to decide what the things you do are and what things are worthwhile to you, but you have to just be doing things. **If you're trying to find out what makes you happy the only way you'll find it is by looking (and testing things out), not by considering what you maybe should try, or by doing the same things that currently aren't making you happy.** 

And the easiest way to reconcile with the past is to realize "What are the things that I could have done better?" Nobody is perfect, and you can't realistically expect yourself to do everything perfectly, but understanding the mistakes you made and how you can do better in the future to prevent those same mistakes allows you to move on and not dwell. Most people get stuck and anxious because they're terrified of it happening again, and because it was a scary and unfamiliar place to be in. But if you how to do better next time, then you can relax some. It's like studying before a test, now you don't have to be so worried if you know everything to do the best of your abilities. Then you don't have regrets, or nerves it's just "well I've done everything I can do, all that's left is to do my best when I get into the real-deal".  


If you felt like you were blind, realize the signs, realize what you could have done better to be a better partner. And if you do that, i'm sure the next girl you're with will feel like the luckiest girl in the world to be with a guy that puts effort into making her feel special and loved.  


As for things you can try right now: going to the gym is almost universally always good (taking care of your health: drinking water, getting enough sleep are also big deals if you can). read some books on interesting topics or people, keep playing the piano, maybe get a dog, maybe join a martial arts gym or something. And if you're unsure then pick something and do it. You never know when something you weren't that interested in might surprise you and be really cool. So if you don't have something, doing anything is better. Maybe you don't like cooking but you take a cooking class and meet some really cool people or meet a gorgeous girl, or find out it's not as bad as you thought and if you don't like it you don't lose anything because you weren't doing anything else at the time. **And if you're really stuck always be learning.** **You'll never regret knowing something.** So if you're stuck between spending your time for something you're not passionate about where you won't learn anything (like watching tv or sports), or learning about something you don't have that much passion about... pick the learning, it allows you to do things for others and for yourself as well.
I still see it as a 40+ dollar stock with future upside. Sentiment gets fucked pretty hard though after blowoff tops like this. Picked up a few shares at $38, but would really like to get in below $35. I think it recovers, but might take time since people are probably scared of it right now. 30 - 35 is a buy for me
*at this moment*

Its all temporary and things will get better

Also what the fuck is your posting approval process. I make a quality OC meme and post it and it never shows up but some retard reposts the same shitpost that someone else already posted and their post appears.

They can exit their positions several ways.   To them, it's a matter of greed.  Can they bankrupt the longs by just outlasting them (max profit for them).  They can exit now (and probably break even or pocket some profits).  Or they can wait and get squeezed. 

If the squeeze happens, the institution last left standing will bear the brunt of it all.  Imagine you have 10 huge companies/funds getting squeezed.   They all scramble to cover.   The smart ones, let's say 5 companies, will try to pass off their lossess as gains (profit from the squeeze itself by buying calls during the initial ramp up).  Then once they've secured their long position, they unload their calls on other 5 ill-prepared companies.  It's a corrupt system.  Somehow I feel like these shorts will escape relatively unscathed and the general public ends up paying for this entire mess.
Leveling the playing field of Congress' asymmetric access to information by posting Congress' trading reports to a database is good for America.
Realistically, the only direction from there if the ER is absolute shit, is up. Even with the current retail model, it's a new gen console holiday season, and they don't come around very often, comparatively speaking. Even with online sales from other retailers, GME is still going to see people flocking to them in droves for the holiday season, so short term, I don't see it as a bad play. I'd be wary of post holiday season though, anything past that, and you're milking blood from a stone. People will take their profits and move on, just like everything else. Long term will be contingent on how well they transition to their digital market. A bad ER isn't going to scare those with positions away, and I'd dare say would even bolster some to double down.
Time in the market beats timing of the market.

Way off, it's probably getting over 40 and coming back down after the squeeze then working back up with the rebuild and console cycle. This started out as a squeeze/console release boost play for me and the longer I'm in and doing research the more it seems they legit have a chance to turn the business around and prepare to have future success. GME has turned into three plays for me now ideally, selling my current positions after squeeze, riding the stock down post squeeze, and potential long term business turn around after the dust settles from the squeeze.
And they have options, FUCK YEAH

For investors in PLTR stock, the Tiberius project could be a major catalyst. There has been much attention paid to Covid-19 plays like with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX). But there are considerable risks, in terms of whether a vaccine will work.

This is not the situation with PLTR stock, though. The company will benefit regardless of who wins the race for the vaccine. Project Tiberius will also be a showcase of Palantir‚Äôs capabilities ‚Äì and this should help boost business in other areas.

Which is fine, I‚Äôm not particularly bearish on GME, but this is a bit unfortunate to see in there: ‚ÄúRevenue is expected go from $5.7bn (FY Jan 2021) to $5.8bn (FY Jan 2022) to $6.2bn (FY Jan 2023) and generate EBITDA of $73mn in FY21, $160mn in FY 22 and $160mn FY 23.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not...much growth with their current trends, though, is it? 

And although their ‚Äúbond market, as discussed, is relaxed on the company‚Äôs credit position and the rating agencies have upgraded it during the summer...The current market cap is $900mn and the company has $735mn of cash on the balance sheet and $1.1bn of debt as of the last quarterly update.‚Äù 

And that‚Äôs cool their bond market isn‚Äôt super concerned with their debt, but *someone* should be concerned, especially with how little growth they project. **AND** such little growth all rides on *IF* they can find relevancy in the e-commerce sector with MSFT‚Äôs All Access payment plan system.
You show me 500k in shares, I quit my job and work for you.

Exactly how is $100 retarded?

GME would be valued at 6.5bn at $100/share. At their height they had a 9bn valuation. They revenue that much in a year with their older business model. Their new business model will generate much more than that over the next few years.

You have to look at market cap and not share price because they bought back 37% of their shares. $100 is very realistic with their turnaround and Cohen's involvement.
No. As long as your ass is covered toure good
Case in point... recently I bought SOLO shares... with all my retirement account. 20% later, I sold! I was happy for a day! And solo went another 300%+ from there !

The boat? You mean the freaking rocket? Tons of people are shitting on PLTR right now because Citron said it would fall 30% and then it lost a whole $1.39 on black friday. Stock is up 183% since listing (the company purposely listed it WAY lower imo so it would have room to go up) and the last time üåàüêª Andrew Left did this (with NIO) price dropped 1 day then went back up. This was a black friday sale if anything. Citron is a company that shorts stocks, so if they shorted PLTR (you can bet every dollar that's NOT in PLTR they DID) then they stood to benefit if the price went down ü§î Large firms and even the Canadian pension system bought shares of PLTR. 

TL;DR: No it's not fucking too late to buy PLTR.

The next morning I had the intentions on buying that back and selling the $470, but TSLA continued to rip and I didn‚Äôt have the money to buy this contract back. Yesterday the short leg was exercised and since I‚Äôm on robinhood I‚Äôm pretty sure they trashed the long leg. I think I‚Äôm fucked pretty bad. Yes?

You're not the least bit hesitant about taking a new type of vaccine that has never made it past human trials and was rushed through a 10 year process in 1 year? I understand the need for it and if I didn't have the luxury of working from home, I'd take it in a heart beat. However, because I have this luxury, I'd rather everyone else take it first and wait a year to see if there are potential long term side effects. If you read any of the literature on this, you'll see that it's pretty universally agreed that we don't know if there will be long term side effects or not but that the trade off of rushing it out now to protect the vulnerable in our society outweighs potential long term side effects.
Yes brother, it's our time to go to tendie town! Already up 1k on my calls!

They're still confident in their short position, that GME will fall before they get margin called. They have a lot of earn if it happens, so they don't want to trade a big win for a small loss.
Not your fault that someone ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt trust‚Äù the market because they made a bad investment
understandable, explain the short interest tho?

No. It has a reverse effect because shorts are technically buying the stocks by borrowing from the bank, which increases the value of the underlying at such high volumes. Perfect example is Tesla. Before the split Tesla was being shorted the moment it hit the 700s and kept getting shorted and still hit 2K at peak.

But will they be asked about holiday sales and the transformation of the company to digital and e-commerce on the earnings call? Absolutely. Strap in and hold.
What's funny is people actually think the fucked up scenes are real. But the thing is... if they were, they'd be classified as CP and the director would be jailed for owning and distributing it.

Yes sir! Sell your calls and buy shares.üöÄ

Are you planning to keep holding this for a while or take profits soon?

So you retards get pissed when Citron shorts the stocks, takes all your money, and buys back in at a lower price.... so.... you think by pumping it even more that sticks it to Citron....THEY BOUGHT BACK IN AT A LOWER PRICE!!!! You are just making them more money. The way to get back at them is to pick a completely unrelated stock Citron is not in and pump that. When you see them jump in you short it and move to another stock

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200929006146/en/Palantir-Announces-Additional-Update-Regarding-Outstanding-Shares-of-Common-Stock-and-Shares-Permitted-to-Be-Sold-Under-Lock-Up-Agreements

The outstanding RSUs, which are held by current and former employees and other service providers, are expected to vest and settle into an aggregate of 68.1 million shares of Class A common stock in connection with the listing. Of these shares, approximately 25.8 million shares are expected to be sold throughout the first day of trading to fund personal tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the RSUs.

In addition, certain record holders of Palantir‚Äôs common stock and stock options that are subject to market standoff agreements with Palantir have not signed Palantir‚Äôs lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period, which is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir‚Äôs financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the ‚Äúlock-up period"). If such record holders sign the lock-up agreement, as of September 28, 2020, up to an additional 13.3 million shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, would be able to be sold during the lock-up period, subject to certain exceptions.

Yea, making 150% on one of the only weekly plays I ever made that was profitable has made me break even on all the other weekly plays I made that cost me. I can say that weeklies are a lot more profitable before earnings but outside of earnings it always feels like russian roulette. 

Unless its APHA, I've been weirdly correct in my APHA plays, by either timing pumps, earnings, or black swans properly.

pltr does what the cia does with big data, but for everyone.
I‚Äôm a retard so help me understand. 

The bull case is that the stock picks up momentum, speezes the puts and causes the stock price to sky rocket.

The bear case is that the stock does not pick up enough momentum to squeeze the puts and ends up stagnating or falling. 

If I understand correctly there needs to be a catalyst which will be the earnings on dec 8. 

I am struggling to understand how good the earnings needs to be to cause the squeeze that everybody is talking about.

This right here is the main point why you should be dumping your life savings into Palantir. The tech is cool but not new. They're just the first major SV startup to successfully break into the DoD space and IPO which is incredibly difficult and kills most other competitors. 

The revenue streams here take 5-10 years to setup but once you've done it you have a consistent firehose of income even if you have a bad year.

Nah bro.  You need to find a real mans game.  Let me introduce you to Baccarat.  Just walk up to the table and bet on Banker.  $800 on Banker then of course you want to put $100 on each dragon bonus. It‚Äôs roulette without the green.
$1000 might be high, but $100 is not. With the amount of short positions  that will have to cover there is not enough stock available to purchase. So if it starts to get out of hand you'll basically be able to dictate the price. I've got a limit sell placed at $1000 a share just in case, if someone has to buy ill have it available.
This is ultimately where GME is going. Cohen see's this opportunity. That is why he bought in and is swinging his dick around. GME has the potential to become a massive company with diverse revenue streams.

I'm deep into GME since the start of September because I realized the same potential in GME while everyone was calling it blockbuster. The fact that mgmt bought back 37% of shares really helps with the valuation for GME. I can easily see this going into the $100's/share range in a few years.

There was a guy who once stopped me on the street to ask for monthly donations, I was in hurry to catch a late bus home, at first I was reluctant, then I heard Yemen and I told him basically to get to the signing up part already (although I am a self supporting student). After, he was asking me what made me to leave everything I was doing and accept, and I was like " man, I heard Yemen, there is not much to think about"

Also consider the app ShareTheMeal, you can donate to various causes related to hunger, you insert the cards details once and the donation can be as low as 70 cents with a click, if you have a slower day at trading it's still good to make you understand that gains are gains and they can really make the difference for someone.

Cashed out a call yesterday, been riding this since 11$ share price. I think it's about at it's height for now, maybe not. They don't have a working product yet, they're acquiring needed production equipment this year. Shits going to go crazy once they have a working battery. I'm all for this stock tho.
I've been a Nio long ever since $4 but I got off at $16 since I thought there would be a major pullback. I could never imagine the EV bubble mooning so hard and I regret hopping off a company I believe in the long run. But EV companies are way too overvalued right now, look at TSLA, Nio, Xpev, Li. I agree with you that Nio like all EV companies are way too overvalued rn but claiming that you give factual information is just bs.


Nio was the company who suffered the least when the Chinese car sales crashed back in Feb/March. When automotive makers' sales dropped by ~80%, Nio only dropped by ~20%. This signals strong demand for the domestic brand and contradicts your statement. Your statement about Chinese people loving foreign brands over domestic ones doesn't stand when looking at the smartphone industry either. Can you explain why Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo sales have surged so much in contrast to foreign brands in these recent years?

Believe it can get to $30-$40 near term around/post merger. Forward 2021 revenue of $3.5B, comps RDFN, Zillow, and CVNA trade for 6-7x. 

That would imply a TEV for OpenDoor of $20-$25B, or $35-$45 a share just based on where it is today. 

Add in meme factor of being a first mover in a $1.3T market, digitally enabled, and market share leader in ibuying segment, it could go higher than that.

Also, this is a bit unfortunate to see in there: ‚ÄúRevenue is expected go from $5.7bn (FY Jan 2021) to $5.8bn (FY Jan 2022) to $6.2bn (FY Jan 2023) and generate EBITDA of $73mn in FY21, $160mn in FY 22 and $160mn FY 23.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not...much growth with their current trends, tbh. 

‚ÄúThe current market cap is $900mn and the company has $735mn of cash on the balance sheet and $1.1bn of debt as of the last quarterly update.

It's an earnings report. They will be reporting results from the beginning and ending of their third quarter. They don't just print of a quick books p&l statement on Dec 8th and say here ya go. They have accountants and auditors who prepare it. That takes time. Their last physical quarter probably ended a month ago.

I see that you found it on Morningstar in this particular case. Had to find the right tab to click on though so I googled to see if there's a site to mainly search for # of shares being shorted and found this site: http://shortsqueeze.com/

Gave the same number but oddly doesn't provide the shares float, at least not for GME.
My guess, two possible triggers. The earnings on the 8th or any next vaccine related news.

You guys are dummies short interest is 2%
Covered only refers to selling contracts as far as I know. You buy to open call contracts with money you have in your account, and you don't have to have any other money available because they either drop in value to zero (never negative) or they rise in value to infinity and you make sure to sell them rather than exercise.

I think it's triggered when you use the word sticky or stickied
If you buy call options the seller (usually MMs) will need to delta hedge their position.  This is usually achieved by buying ~20% of the shares the option controls.  Options can be a more effective way to control float, albeit indirectly.
Ahh so you have barely any earnings too

Thanks. Fair point about PLTR being the flavour of the month but a lot of people here are not prepared in case the stock tanks (which is perfectly normal in the short run). 
Diversification is also important. I would like WSB fellas to point us towards 3-4 (or more) stocks which has due diligence done with recommendations. It would be safer, in my view, for a lot of people here to put their eggs in multiple baskets than just sell everything for one stock. PLTR is not the only stock in the market that will hit the moon (even though I wish it were true).
Citron tweets "We are going to short to 20 dollars" - One retard trying to convince thousands of other retards to do the same.

WSB "We are going to the Moon" - Ten thousand retards each trying to convince one or two other retards each.

There is no head here, No organization. Just a bunch of what ifs. Now imagine if our retards where on the NYSE floor. Well, the internet is our floor.
lmao u came here asking to be spoon-feed. do your own fucking DD, there‚Äôs at least 10 good quality DDs on GME here, let me j say blackfriday isn‚Äôt even one of them. 

and i‚Äôm going to answer your question because im feeling nice today. it won‚Äôt be included bc thats the fucking q3 earnings report.

inferring your trading experience, you are probably going to panic sell on a -5% day, please don‚Äôt.

Serious Question:
How exactly is a company with such a poor track record still around? And why does the market still follow their analysis(As in dip when they say a stock is overvalued)?

Is it just an unfair representation and they are spot on otherwise? Or do they have some sort of legendary status? 

For years all Ive ever heard about them was how they make up bullshit hitpieces and the stocks rise afterwards, so what am I missing here?

-6 my new high score
See you at $5 üëãüèº
I bought 14 weeklies last Monday, I figured the earnings run up would trigger a squeeze, which it did but I've been burned enough times in the past just buying GME calls already so I was expecting it to go nowhere, until Wednesday. I was up 150% when I sold, but I only put in 5% of my portfolio because that was all I was willing to lose. With earnings there could still be more run up but when it hits 17 I would expect a lot of selling and resistance to get over it. 

I am definitely holding onto my shs, I joined the party late and got in around 12/share but I'm not complaining if I don't sell it at the top and it only falls back down to 14/share again. Selling 15-15.5 CCs on the weeks where there are some pumps has brought my cost basis down a lot.

This is what I don't understand about the short squeeze thing. Why wouldn't the shorters just close their positions for a small loss now?
Well we closed 28, so hoping to get to 30 by Monday

no its a great mobile app if you aren't day trading and want a nice interface. Esp if you are just doing stocks / fractionals (which is most people)
their fills are crap though

try putting orders at midpoint for the same contract on both RH and another broker like TD or IBKR. compare it side by side. it's pretty much guaranteed the other broker will fill you first, whereast RH will only fill you if it goes massively against you. or it will run and you miss out completely.

people get hung up on the "freE cOmmiSions" without realizing that a round-trip cost is much more than commissions. shit aint free and you gotta pay somehow.

What makes you say that? Shitron pretty much gave up and brought the dip. All the boomers are gonna come back and buy the dip after their massive sells Friday.
I did Jan and Apr calls.
What you are talking about is restricted stock units (RSU).  It's just given to you on a monthly/quarterly/annual basis depending on the plan.  Most tech companies vest over 4 years.  So if you had 200 total shares that vest quarterly for 4 years you'd get 12.5 shares every quarter for example.   

An option as part of compensation is a bit different.  You have the option to purchase stock at a set price for a certain amount of time.  I have no idea what the deal is at PLTR, but they may give you the option to buy 12.5 shares at a set price of $4.50 a quarter.

There is no such thing as buying a naked call. Buying a call is a 'long call'. You cannot sell naked calls on RH. 

Covered calls is writing a call when you own 100 shares of the underlying.

Yeah that‚Äôs true, it was brief. However, when it was happening, very very few people expected it to be brief. By April I think most people thought we were in for at least a repeat of 2008-9. But it‚Äôs true basically nobody here has traded through a war of attrition on the bear market side. I think people would still be trying to make meme plays, they‚Äôd just be different - there are always ways to place risky bets with low probabilities of high returns, and I think the sub has a critical mass where enough people will still hit those small probabilities and post gains, making the sub as a whole seem successful. At some point, the retail trading mania will end in that environment, and possibly at that point the active users would dwindle to a point where it‚Äôd get more boring.
Places do that when they they try to go ‚Äútipless‚Äù since people are too stupid to be like ‚Äúthis plate costs $25 but at this other similar restaurant it‚Äôs only $20 (plus a $5 tip) so I‚Äôm going there instead I‚Äôm so smart!‚Äù Until you change the shortsighted attitude people have about costs of plates in restaurants pretax and pretip, they have to do that if they want to stay in business.

I deliver for all the companies you mentioned. I often wonder how they can ever be profitable in a significant way without being predatory to restaurants or drivers. Autonomous delivery service maybe, I just can't figure it out.

Yeah man I‚Äôm a big believer in the company an tech, I‚Äôm just worried about the legal part falling through and then you own a bunch of shares of Stable Acquisition because Momentus doesn‚Äôt go public. Calls for days
Yes
The warrants typically execute a few years after the merger. They‚Äôre pretty much like a call option. The ticker typically changes once the merger is finalized, and then you make a ton of money as the stock rises.

I‚Äôve gotta second this. Momentum tickers can defy this type of TA - the order book, market depth and supply zones are what will drive price action. 

Also OP, you can pull fibs from 10 different places to find a narrative that matches your bias. Buyers and sellers all have their own entries and targets and it‚Äôs not likely that you‚Äôre going to hack all that nuance and sentiment with this type of forecasting. I‚Äôve been burned several times trying to short momentum names - when the assumption doesn‚Äôt pan out you learn the hard way to just respect price action.
Long term, who knows if they‚Äôll get their shit together.

Next year, probably won‚Äôt do great.

But for the next month, hope + shorters = highly profitable short squeeze.
I'm seeing a real lack of PLTR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
If the autists here keep saying GME short squeeze like they are into something that the big funds shorting it aren't on to, I have my doubts about it actually happening
Trying to decide if i go all in.. or stay all out
PLTR is just the flavour of the month now so you'll have to make do with it being all over WSB until 2021 where a new ticker will come and take over.  I however agree that it's annoying some new account comes in with no post history and tries to sell us their garbage penny stock. Could use like a minimum karma rule for posting.
It‚Äôs an entity which takes a lot of neutral or not all one directional trades (not just long Tesla, maybe running pair trades, straddles, weighting strangles).. if their optimistic they‚Äôll still have short and commodity plays which will limit their risk.. but get them along for the ride on upside.. I‚Äôm running a hedge strategy, I‚Äôm long volatility (like a Stanley druckenmiller) vs short volatility (selling puts, buying calls, 100% to upside like Warren Buffett).. druck made most of his $$ in bear markets..

This sounds like something Dwight Shrute would say from The Office
I'll check the OI/volume on March and April options and probably consider a bunch of 20/25 spreads.

A bit annoying watching your net liquidating value oscillate wildly tho lol
This is not the way.
Yes. It could be a while before it really pops though. Once all the Covid scares are officially over it‚Äôll moon but as for now the NFL just disallowed in-person practices on Monday and Tuesday and postponed/maybe cancelled a game this week.


On a separate note, the NFL is fucking retarded if they think taking 2 days off will do jack shit

Pretend I am Citron for a bit "I am one retard trying to convince ten thousand other retards to do as I say."

Now come back to reality, this is WSB "We are ten thousand retards each trying to convince one or two other retards to do as we say"

Its the exact same shit. And seeing as there is no real unity, leader or guidance here. Just a bunch of retards shouting.

Why do you have your watermark on a public filing?

Anyway, I sometimes follow Iron-hands Pelosi with large amounts. She doesn't usually call the bottom well, but her husband buys calls with serious time. So when CRWD dipped on 11/9 and 11/10 with antivirus news reopening fear, I built a large position in CRWD.

So in the 80s, quants with computers revolutionized trading, now it's the autistic millennials' turn
Why try to talk yourself out of something?
Mate it will be bouncing a bit over the next month as the short levels are huge... I mean potential for a short squeeze as the meme is strong with this one. However it will likely have a pullback before Feb as that‚Äôs when the lockup expires and insiders can sell... I‚Äôd expect a lot of insiders to sell and make some money given the price spike.
So my car caught on fire... I‚Äôm watching police and firemen put it out. What a morning...

One of the most overvalued stocks on the market in terms of p/s, but it‚Äôs cloud and riding Buffet backed hype.  I really dont know much about it but it‚Äôs a $90B valuation on like $400 mil sales. Dumb imo but what isn‚Äôt lately?

Biggest kunt to be involved in TSLA stole Left‚Äôs wife and is money making her a rent a hoe. 

He just mad at the $$$Krew.
I‚Äôm just partial to the debit spread because depending on the strike price, a straddle has to move a lot to make money. You can set a relatively conservative strike price and as long as it‚Äôs over your short let at expiration you make max profit. You could even go slightly ITM for some downside protection too.
I think the article as a whole is a great one tho.  Suggesting that these new trading platforms are allowing millions of everyday people to trade from home thus manipulating the stock through social media posts without even knowing it.  If y‚Äôall want a stock to go to the moon......  well, just ask your fellow redditors and they can make it happen.  This also says a lot about panic selling and who are the ones doing it.  When shitron tweets bearish news they know whose gonna panic, the kitchen table traders that‚Äôs who.
1680 for me and still ain‚Äôt enough!
Very sure don't be insecure buy more shares, and more calls.

Was referring more to market valuation. Totally agree that EV % of market share likely to grow but not anywhere close to justify the astronomical $$$ price for some of these companies currently.
Straight from your article there: ‚ÄúThis means that 40% of the register are large active holders that *may not* sell. Who is the marginal seller?‚Äù

Having that much ‚Äúbig money‚Äù into it, and the way he wrote that is all way too generalized and iffy, IMO. Might as well have said, ‚Äúthey could short sell this, but they won‚Äôt...maybe.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm not trying to having a competing view, I‚Äôm being a devil‚Äôs advocate. Like, that‚Äôs *great* but what is gonna get people to do the All Access payment plans through GME and not some‚Äîany‚Äîone else? What‚Äôs their hook? 

I read the whole damn thing, unlike most people, and it‚Äôs just not terribly convincing‚Äîwhich is why the article *is* a part of the point. No, it‚Äôs not the entire point, but the author wasn‚Äôt very convincing and glasses over some very key aspects with wording that sets this all more in *theory* than reality. ‚ÄúIf‚Äù the don‚Äôt sell. ‚ÄúIf‚Äù history repeats. ‚ÄúIf‚Äù trends hold. ‚ÄúIf‚Äù people buy all access from GME.
Ok bro your money but I‚Äôm telling you . But hey man I hope you make money!

XLE just had its best month OF ALL TIME. Literally...best of all time. And I bought leap options on BP at the exact right time a few weeks ago. Up 440% with 5 months until expiration. (April 21) I am already flat on my investment as I pulled out the initial capital and sold. I originally had 275 contracts at $.15 apiece. I sold 50 of them at $.80. Holding the rest. Strike price is $25. I‚Äôm already 4K‚Äì>22k...this could be ‚Äúthe one‚Äù...one more thrust to $25 and this is about to go parabolic. At this point I‚Äôm selling calls or buying weekly puts. Bought 2 week out $20 puts and already up 200% on that as well. Going to do this the whole way...I‚Äôm riding this bitch both ways now! Wish me luck

Problem is there is no real moat. Doordash, Grubhub, Bite Squad, Uber Eats, plus individual delivery people (like pizza) but what differentiates them? Anything?

I remember when TA was useful...
Yes and much more. We are expecting a huge squeeze. I‚Äôve been tracking large and small GME positions across WSB and it looks like it‚Äôs starting to snowball.
Earnings will be horrendous and won't include any holiday sales. Whether that effects the share price, who knows.

This is a long play. No one is saying buy FDs, a lot of people projecting April . Cohen is the wild card. 

But stock is trading above the short order so shorts are already losing money. If this gets pumped to $30 a share and has high volatility shorts will start looking to close driving the price up which is where the squeeze happens. 

The stock has rose 27% in the last week. Will rise at least another 30% leading up to EC. 

Now, if we get a huge pump, NIO/PLTR style this can blow in very short order.

According to [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) , shares were expensive to borrow earlier this year so of course short was down, especially with the price battered. So now, they lower the borrow price to nothing, let short guessers pile in to lose a ton, give up and buy in their shares at an even higher price.

Unless someone can tell me how this doesn't look like a pump and dump?
Great long short though eh?

Stock options for employees are not the same options that you retards gamble on. Usually they will give employees 1000 shares, but they are only vested in a schedule. For example every year 200 vest which then you own and so on for 5 years. If you quit or get fired 1 week before the second year vesting date then you would only get to keep the 200 shares from year one
if i‚Äôm selling calls, do i need the capital to buy and then sell 100 shares?

I have family in the health arena in my area, and thats the same here, just the only thing that made no sense to me was,  If you don't take the flu shot you have to wear a mask, but because of covid you have to wear a mask in the facility regardless of taking the flu shot, so why even get the flu shot when you have to wear a mask regardless right now
Is this a politics sub or are we here to make money?

This woman looks like a stupid fuck given these comments were made when PLTR was 9.70.... and now it‚Äôs 28.70.

Also, grand piano in the living room? You might be a boomer cuckqueen.
Well I have 3 Dec 18 40Cs for Pltr. After watching my 5k account turn into 900 while I was showering at that 33 to 27 drop. Figured I‚Äôd play safe
Ahh I sleep like a baby, I sold all at 30
That...expired worthless
You put $11,000 in right?

If this stock gets to $30 how much would your investment make you?

Yeah I‚Äôm not against jumping on a hype train but PLTR just seems like another defense contractor.  Long term things might be awesome as these companies get entrenched but buying December calls deems autistic, so perfect for this sub.

The big dollars are in consumer products (Tesla, Nio) because they have billions of potential customers.

There is a lengthy Seeking Alpha article laying out the case.
Yeah, I've been lurking web for a while but only started really reading in late March.

March was def a crash. What many have yet to experience is a true blue bear market. There's a distinction between a sharp, short buy the fucking dip crash and a 12-18 month grueling and frustrating downward trend in overall prices.

But maybe the Fed has somehow managed to eliminate old school bear markets and / or information moves so quickly these days compared to times past that prices just reach equilibrium with less lag
they about to loose their fucking socks
If it matters, most of us wont be touching that. They have almost no growth potential. Any money they raise will be to pay off in coming lawyers. If you are looking for something similar, wait for AirBnB and see where that goes. But I, Teh Conglemerate of Ouchies, plans on shorting that one.
PLTR has negative profit, which means it's a pure play.  The potential is endless once they monetize.  $1000 by end of next year potentially

here‚Äôs the thing. for this short squeeze to work u have to buy shares AND actually hold onto them.  so if it dips 3% one day you pussy paper handed fucks need to not sell and just hold onto them.

unfortunately a lot of u bitches jumping ship from pltr are proof of being paper handed bitches after that fake ass citron report.

What does it mean not to buy during pre market?

I had my eye on this stock at $10 but hesitated about it and it went up to $14 (I think I purchased when markets were closed) at $14 thinking it‚Äôs still has room to grow. 

I only hold 52 shares should I go in more if we think it‚Äôll go up to $30 by end of year?

GME is just nuts, the pullback made so sense fundamentally and was probably just to fuck over 11/20 calls and give their dumb buddies who shorted GME some time to execute their exit strategy (it would explain the call sweeps) to switch to a long position

And weeks later as expected, GME is back to a new 52-week high. And it's still only a 1 billion market cap company with around 7 billion in revenues. Compare that to other retailers like JWN, BBBY and BBY. I'm just hoping the CRSR profit takers start moving into GME now when they realize CRSR is at a 3 billion market cap with only 1 billion in revenues, then see the obvious opportunity in GME as a value pick with actual growth prospects in the 3 year outlook (so it's not just a value trap)

I wish I was richer because GME is so fucking obvious (I'm 100% GME right now on low 5-figures)
If I had a crystal ball, that would have been an amazing trade.

Since I‚Äôm not a person that knows the future, I wait for extremely bloated prices and jump in. $27 is bloated, but it‚Äôll run more IMHO

The problem with being a bear is when the market is up, you think that is when it's about to crash, and when you think it is down, that is when you think the crash is happening.

When you're a bull, you always think the market is going up. And the market is always going up. It just makes more sense.

Everyone is missing the point a bit on palantir. I work for a data company that does the same thing as palantir. And I would argue does it MUCH better, and so do half of our competitors. Palantir is not special in how they process data or do anything. That should be clear.

What they are special for, is something called FedRamp. This is a security clearance and process for putting data in government employees hands. As well as using federally secure data to accomplish what you outlined. The trick here is that in order for a company to achieve fed ramp status. They need government sponsors. Seeing as Palantir is already there and has beat most of their potential competitors on that one piece. This makes is very likely for them to win more and more government business. Because when contracting with the Gov. you need past experience that is outlined in RFP Responses to win more business. This all adds up to a near monopoly on all things government and data analytics. So while palantir is sucking on the tit of the taxpayer. Other competitors are banging on the door just trying to get fed ramp approved.
Hopefully. I'm banking on the fact that he was 100% right about Herbalife, it absolutely was and still is a pyramid scheme - just one that managed to lobby enough fellow grifters in Congress to stay afloat. So hopefully he's right again and being right works out better this time.

You guys see how PLTR got fucked by some lame hit piece by Citron? That was because it was literally looking for a reason to pullback because it was so overextended. Now take that logic and apply it to the entire market. We better hope it's all unicorn farts and sunshine in the coming weeks. I don't know about you guys, but I'm way too over-leveraged to the upside with barely any downside protection.
*some say his entire body was made of paper*
I‚Äôm glad I decided to buy for January. Regret that I bought it on the way up to the peak though. Could have afforded to double up if I bought at the bottom, and my graph wouldn‚Äôt be so ugly lol.

How is this legal?
Okay, (also, I wasn‚Äôt being sarcastic, byw) so yeah, *bbbuutt* they are a premium dealer of premium parts in the industry, RAM, PSU, cases, coolers, storage, etc., all sorts of gaming peripherals, prebuilts, software, and the like. 

They have a pretty solid market share of a lot of PC comments, and it‚Äôs not going away. 

They are *VERY* good at what they do, I follow r/pcmasterrace r/pcgaming and the like, and 8 of 10 times of someone‚Äôs built they have *at least* CRSR RAM if not also a PSU, and periphs. 

Yes they do, they‚Äôve just barely IPO‚Äôd and I see them being within the ballpark of major players within 6 months to a year. AMD, INTC (when $60, haha) etc.

You‚Äôre missing the point- Boeing 737 max had tons and tons and tons of flights. The failures were due to the software not being understood by the pilots. Essentially the software had to over compensate for the larger more powerful motors being fitted to an older body. The powerful motors caused handling issues that were controlled by software.

Lots of people died and it has created havoc for a company that has transported billions and billions of people. Imagine a failure like this happening to a company that has 3-4 planes a limited customer base.
You do appear to be correct and the daily trade email seems to not be thorough.  I concede and take back the bullshit,

I get your point. Like I said, it could be a cash cow but they are resource constrained and any hiccup is catastrophic for a startup like that.
It really doesn't matter wehn you've been in since IPO. Their hit job only took out 4%, the stock is pretty much a vertical chart still.

In the grand scheme of thibgs, nothing really changed fundementally about the company, just ignore the price trends and do your own DDs. If you believe it's a worthwhile company to invest in, it'll go up.

The article itself is not the point - the information about the bond pricing is. Right now no one's assess are going into any brick n mortar store in decent numbers. But they have expanding e-commerce, a console cycle that's historically been great for the stock and an activist investor base.

Also for those who argue that e-commerce is a winner takes all with Amazon, please explain the monster rise of Shopify which is a tool for smaller e-commerce players. There's room for everyone, and there's room for Gamestop too.

Edit: And frankly, there will always be competing views on how a stock will play out in the future. You might want to buy puts on GME if you are convinced they are going to fall near term.

i sold my 16$ 11/27 call on monday after being up 300%+ and i know if i waited til at least wednesday it could have doubled and then i saw that those same contracts were up 1000%. 

never beat yourself for taking profits but for my first option it wasn‚Äôt a bad play.

i just want to know how theta would play when your contracts is up 100%+ near expiration and when your contracts is so far ITM is that a risk when trying to sell it close for expiration?

if your worth ten million not a problem. It has increased around 40 percent since the S&P news. That is approximately what it gained after it announced the split. I think it continues to go up in anticipation, but not sure if we see anymore 7-10 percent days.

Once you buy your options position, the greeks don't count for shiite if the price moves against you strike price(s)....oh, wait....that's Delta, isn't it?
here‚Äôs the thing. for this short squeeze to work u have to buy shares AND actually hold onto them.  so if it dips 3% one day you pussy paper handed fucks need to not sell and just hold onto them.  

unfortunately a lot of u bitches jumping ship from pltr are proof of being paper handed bitches after that fake ass citron report.
Did you really just bring up an MSc like it makes you a deep thinker or more insightful?

Um, leaps have high delta. If shares fucking moon, leaps are going to increase as well even if the IV does fuck all.
You left out the ticker so we're clueless as to who the company is...
I have dude. And it‚Äôs not a fraud company or anything, and I agree Citron is running a classic pump/dump, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that in the short term this stock will continue to tumble. 

We are in the ‚ÄúIPO era‚Äù, similar to when all these rando companies popped up during the ‚Äú.COM‚Äù era. You may or may not remember that, but it feels incredibly similar to what‚Äôs happening now. 

This stock has been manipulated already, and Citron with their credibility has swayed people to take profits - as they should be. It‚Äôs irresponsible to keep holding when the stock has ONLY gone up and has ONLY been in market for 3 months. 

Open your eyes man. A steep correction is dues and all technicals agree.

All joking aside, I do have confidence enough to stake out with them. I think it is low enough to buy and they seem ambitious enough to where it seems worthy enough to hang with them for the long.

Again, all in the hopes to buy more PLTR in 2050.
Like I said, do your own DD. If you wanna miss out on ignorance that‚Äôs on you guys, but you‚Äôre making a whole lot of assumptions right now that simply aren‚Äôt true. This is the most you‚Äôll get from me lol

Yeah everyone here is saying it so we all buy, it goes higher and they get short squeezed and have to buy.

This is the way
How do we know this? Granted I think most people have smallstreebets sized accounts but was there ever a survey or something?
its look great, thanks a lot
Even if you do trigger a wash sale, you still get the basis carried into the next year so it's not a huge deal. But ya just don't buy anything in January that you sold in December, or if you are planning on that do the math and buy on the 31st day.

Not paying more than 10% taxes. The government doesn‚Äôt care unless it‚Äôs millions in gains which apparently I don‚Äôt have
Well, seeing as it‚Äôs unlikely that PLTR would pay their employees puts for their own company, I say this is awesome for us WSB bulls because the employees also want to see PLTR go to the moon so that they can get their tendies.
Next? It's been here for a while
Yeah I getchu what plays you have rn?
So do you make a lot less money when you buy further expiration? It‚Äôs just safer right?
Duuuuuuude. Cash out... paying taxes means you made money and that‚Äôs a good problem to have. Better to win and pay the tax than regret the loss forever. This big of a potential loss will literally haunt you for your life. Congratulations though that‚Äôs amazing.

Dude, chill. March is so far out that you should just sit on them. Market can be temporarily irrational but it will get it's shit back together by then.

The House bill like most China related news is all noise. The rules wouldn't affect BABA even if they were to come into effect. AND assuming any company was affected they have 3 years to fix their shit before being delisted.

This is mostly a means I think of removing smaller, scammier Chinese penny stocks from the US exhanges it's not at all targeting any big boys.

Is that what‚Äôs happening to you right now?
Please tell me more about your "interviews and research". It looks like you got into gme with the recent momo fomo after seeing a few other large wsb positions. If you actually thought 50 by eoy, your 20 and 25 strike targets make no sense. 30c are the highest strike so why not at least pick the best bang for your buck?

Do 80% shares and 20% calls.

Short sellers can drive the price down and kill your options!  That's what happened the last time in Oct.   Once they collected your fat premiums they can exit their positions once they tank the price.  So don't be an idiot and go 100% calls.

Take a look at iborrowdesk and search for GME.  The shorts keep reloading with borrowed shares to sell.  The way to break them is to make them pay that interest over time.  But if you keep feeding them premiums, they can/will outlast you until your options expire.
You tipped the cashier at Popeyes ? Wtf
IPV, InterPrivate Aquisition is a SPAC that's going to merge with Aeva which is a company that makes lidar. Lidar are car sensors for autonomous driving vehicles. Currently trading at around $10 and only up 5% within a week and 13% since SPAC began. 

I'm gonna do more little research on this company before putting a small position. This company is similar to GMHI (SPAC) merging with Luminar.
Lol no worries,  skinning cats and all. At least you way you are locking in some profits! Ha
Why not options expiring mid next year?

Yea no shi, they hate that we have to pay no commission and it‚Äôs free. F*ck em
Called a vertical spread, and yes you can.  The 15s you sold are covered by the 10s you bought.   Your profit is difference between the 2 strikes if stock end ITM.  Max profit would be if stock price closed at like 14.99 because you would then get the profit on the 10s and presumably the 15s wouldn‚Äôt be exercised, I.e. you get to keep the premium.  

There are also diagonal/calendar spreads.  

But you‚Äôre on the right track.

Convenient of citron to publish something about PLTR when PLTR was already ripe for a pullback due to an RSI being around 90.

I think a meme stock is something that had no business being shilled in the first place but it still takes off.

PLTR has potential for long term steep growth, just not the current rabid value pumping. GME has proven itself, people FOMOing in now would have happened without wsb. The squeeze theory was being offered for the taking awhile ago.

VALE, PRPL, and SPCE are the types of focused retardation I would describe as meme stocks.

I bought more NIO the day shitron on dumped it and I‚Äôm already back up. I bought pltr at open Friday for $31.45 average and I‚Äôm holding till $200 minimum
You sound full retard when you can‚Äôt even read his post....
You're looking at vaccines wrong. A vaccine is a public good and isn't just taken to protect yourself. It's taken to protect society (your gamgam and poppop might not be able to get the vaccine because they are immunocompromised or some shit). This is one of the reasons I'm so torn about this. I realize why I should take it but I just can't bring myself to do it.

Unless you know their roi you have no leg to stand on. Short bets pay big when they win so yes, they may have more losses than wins. Some of the stupidity on here is fun, some actually intelligent; this in not the case here. Gl bud
This guy!
For instance on GME you can see $17 currently holds the most open interest for the next big options exp. on 12/18 https://imgur.com/VmMuNlb

Then $20 and $25 ‚Äî expect defense to be played around those levels and people to buy back the calls they sold forcing MM‚Äôs to increase buying if price breaks past them 

Could be missing a huge part of this that I can‚Äôt see but it‚Äôs helpful for me.
Thanks bro

Look any questions up on investopedia. Also, put all your money on PLTR 45 calls for next Friday.

If you guys seriously think Palantir will be green next week, then this is absolute confirmation that you guys have no idea what‚Äôs going on. If you haven‚Äôt locked in profits, you‚Äôd better do it IMMEDIATELY. 

You‚Äôre treating this as though it‚Äôs a casino. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll do black if everyone is telling me to.‚Äù There is some research you can do, and short term technicals still work to gauge trend direction. 

Jeezus Christ help us all.
That's what I'm betting on.  I don't trust Milton to hold his shares, that scammer is going to sell hard and dump the NKLA share price.
Buying calls will b cheaper for us and the mm will hedge by buying the shares
Their pdf is not updated atm.  But I am fairly confident they did.
No, market manipulation would be if we all decided to buy shares locking the market up and not selling.

This is literally what is going to happen. There's a squeeze happening soon you I am just warning you before we take off.

Do you know any doctors who are being forced/pressured to take it, or is that an assumption you're making? Once one is approved and starts getting administered, it shouldn't be hard to find medical professionals who are getting it and ask their honest opinion.

It really isn't hard to separate what actual professionals/experts in a field say vs what people with an agenda claim those experts are saying. If they say the benefit outweighs the risk only for at risk populations, okay. If they are willing to administer it to themselves and their families? Probably gonna be good enough for me.

It's a great way to tailor the size and duration of your position with limited risk.
Sometimes teachnical reasons don't work as you expect them to work. It's good and important to read charts, but sometimes you need to look around you. If charts would always give a 100% right strategies, it would be too easy and everyone who would have that knowlege would be rich. Sometimes it's more than charts, but it's good to gather any kind of information. Information is what makes us money. In my opinion we won't touch your predicted price. üöÄ
Massive?  Look up SBE/chargepoint and load up before the merger
Will you give me $20 if I am right?  Lucid gets their info before the pdf is updated.

Hard to say. Google didn‚Äôt go public until years after the dotcom bubble and people still loved Yahoo at the time. Amazon sold used books online...that was pretty much all they did for a long time. eBay would have been the one I thought had the most staying power if I had to go all-in at that point in time. 

EV won‚Äôt be going away but their market size could shrink significantly. In the 2008 crash it was shipping and transportation companies that had the high ridiculous valuations. That market has still never recovered anywhere close to its all time high.

Cracking up last night watching VanEck on cnbc talking about how he's worried that the autists are taking too much risk by buying individual stocks instead of etfs. Worried about his expense ratio more than maximizing tendies is not the way
Yup. It‚Äôs always been slightly volatile, but it‚Äôs gotten unreal. They let retail buy up a price during day (which is fine and the way markets should work), and then dump the absolute shit out of it pre market and take all our profits out and destroy all the options they sold. Complete scam of a law so we don‚Äôt all dump every stock we own at close everyday.

Yeah if you can the best way to greed this is shares on margin. Risky AF but could be big if you are right about the squeeze.
Of course not. I firmly believe 95% of the people here do little to no research before buying options on RH here. The fact that this sub is raging hard against Citron makes me believe their jacked to the tits on a decision they made either on impulse or FOMO

I don't understand these analysts revenue projections, and I keep thinking I must be overlooking something.  Given that PS5 will become the best selling console of all time, and given the production numbers coming out of Sony, it seems like these revenue numbers are too low, *just* looking at PS5 console revenue, assuming GME isn't getting a much smaller allotment than in previous cycles.  And I see little reason that would be the case.

The thing that makes me question my own assumptions is because over the last few quarters, the analysts have been far too *optimistic*, not pessimistic.
Funny how people think NIO seeks to sell world wide or even to half of China. Chinese people love foreign goods tyvm, especially cars.

It‚Äôs impossible to convince WSB idiots with common sense. Tell them that GME is a 0 revenue Chinese EV company that is planning a commercial space travel and has a partnership with Palantir.

Everyone knows GME is a legacy dinosaur brick and mortar failure. But what exactly does this have to do with a companies value to the stock market? Nothing.

If there are as many people buying shares as there are PLTR posts in New, the company will have a trillion dollar market cap by mid week.
It will be an unpopular opinion around here but with spacs, ipos, and meme stocks growing 50% in weeks who needs options? I got tired of being a week off on expiration. Stuck to shares and leaps starting in October. It's so much easier and consistent and I should have done it months ago.

Also what I like to do is find the S/R levels on the chart and then check the open interest for the different option expirations around those prices. 

Very helpful especially when you have a new ticker without any chart history such as PLTR. Then you are just looking for where the big money is active and/ or psychological levels $10, $50, $100 prices like that bc at that point nothing makes sense except price
To be honest it never really registered until now that it wasn‚Äôt a binary between stocks and FDs

Theory is he may buy/is buying a controlling stake in GME, and if he calls for sweeping change via his controlling stake it would necessitate a shareholder vote. In that scenario, institutions who have lent out shares will have to recall them, forcing the shorts to buy back at market price and therefore instigating a positive feedback loop on the price. Ergo, short squeeze.

Fellow software engineer here, I disagree with on this but I sincerely appreciate the skepticism, more people need to deeply consider stuff like this before blinding getting it injected into their system.

They extended it that long just in case. I have no doubt it will be announced before Christmas. They don‚Äôt want to miss this EV euphoria
This one is special and 300% should not count.
Squeezes can happen faster than selling can occur, bc shorts are institutional and have very large positions. A short covering 2 million shares will drive the price way up. There are 65 million short shares to cover
It's not the console sales helping GME, it's the shorts that are going to need to cover. Nothing regarding sales or performance is the reason for GME rising.

Lots of investors on this sub were like 13 when it happened and are unlikely to know.
It's an established company with real estate all over the world and large earnings, and its current market cap is around 1 billion, while some rinky-dink "company" consisting of a 10ftx10ft office and 3 employees is valued at 10 billion. The only reason GME fell from $50 to $5 was that people thought it was going bankrupt. Well, it's not. Not even close. That there's a good chance that things will get really good if Ryan Cohen guy (who has purchased 10% of the company shares) takes charge in some way.

I'm a software engineer with an MSc that has always prided myself on being a critical thinker. I've always looked down on conspiracy theorists that believe in shit like chem trails (I believe in some conspiracy theories, like we're being controlled by global elites ect) and antivaxxers. This year has shown me I'm just as retarded as everyone else though.

I can safely say I'm as retarded as an antivaxxer now. There is no way I'd take a new type of vaccine that has never made it past human trials that has been shat out in a year. I'd honestly rather forgo another year of my life than rush to get this vaccine. I'd rather every other retard out there gets it and wait to see if there are any long term side effects.

Imagine being a fucking doctor, knowing that a vaccine typically takes 10 years to produce and review, and being forced due to the requirements of your job to take the vaccine. All you have to do is take a look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA\_vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine) to see that it might not be a good idea to be first in line.

The barrier to entry is massive. The Chinese company comac has been basically replicating Boeing products and they began the process in 2008 and they haven‚Äôt even Brought their flagship products to market yet. If you think virgin galactic can compete with the likes of Boeing, Northrop, state funded programs like comac, then you are crazy.

Virgin galactic might do well but their limited flights, limited aircraft and lack of engineering resources will ensure business problems if there is even a single significant issue. Just my two cents.

It just had its first sell off. It hovered at and around DPO price for a while then had a rise, its 2020 so rises are meteoric now, and then a calming of the waters. It absolutely could settle in the low 20‚Äôs for a while before earnings and a ramp up again. That first dip is typically the early investors cashing out, which we may have just seen.

‚ÄúThe Big Squeeze‚Äù about GME
Holy crap bro how do you know my name
My conservative short-term price point is $48 or 93 bn marketcap. If it beats my price point, great. This will obviously go up or down depending on news and performance. But I'm buying all I can so long as the share price is below $48 how everything stands.
I've seen this movie before. NKLA should have been dead and buried a long time ago. Not going near it. Best of luck boys.
Bought 200 shares last week. Already up 1k
Definitely somewhat from the most recent volatility just off the chart but the huge amount of outstanding short interest everyone keeps doing DD on is why it hasn‚Äôt really happened yet. 

Like has been stated elsewhere: safest strategy just buy and hold and set your target. But these are the levels I think momentum traders will most likely jump in at/ any news catalyst
Yeah that was 6 years ago and the company is ultra safe because of it.

Nope, he is quite right! Gme depends on gaming cycles and they can definitely make over $7B in 2021. Why? Check their earnings reports  and net income from from 2013 to 2019, and find a pattern. Gme is a cyclical company and 7 years is a long time.

If they don't change their business model, they won't last long, but even new console release will give them 2-3 more years.

What is different from last console cycle is that they bought back around 50% of outstanding shares and that means more EPS, and higher stock price especially after 1Q2021 earnings.

Whether it has or hasn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt mean it will again. 

The biggest monkey wrench now is the vaccine. Guidance is always the factor that determines these bigger spikes. That guidance for 2021 and beyond isn‚Äôt going to be in ZMs favor like it was in July when uncertainty was still a big thing. 

My advice? If it dips Monday morning, ride the intraday spike up into closing and sell beforehand.

I think it's obvious at this point any pullbacks in the market will be minor when compared to what we have seen since March. The put upside just isn't there especially while premiums are high. What possible news can bring this market down at this point? Even vaccine failure would only temporarily pull the market back, as there are dozens of other vaccines.

I am more worried about the market becoming flat tbh. I think we can ride hype and euphoria until the end of spring but at some point life gets back to normal and markets lose some of it's participants' due to the flatness. The over dopamined riddled wsbs user will need to turn to hard drugs to get the rush they are use to.

They pick poorly very often. It's likely that they are attempting to manipulate the market with their nonsense articles. If they say go short, go long and collect your breaded chicken.
They're basing it off the current short interest % and comparing it to other stocks that have been shorted in the past. GME is 100%+ short interest, while others were 40-60% and shot up 5x. Not saying I agree though; although I am long GME, I'm more realistic lol.
I see you are a technical Analysis guy. Your analysis shows a bunch of bullish signals and two arrows pointing to the price you want it to be. Without you explaining your thinking it makes no sense to just post a screenshot of some random indicators.

That literally doesn‚Äôt matter though. They‚Äôve conducted market research on several thousand people worth over 5 million, and found an interest rate of I believe 39%.

Furthermore, they‚Äôre working on hypersonic flight which is expected to be a 500 billion market by 2040. Even just 10% market share is a large piece for like a 4b company.

I don't know how valid it is, but I've heard that the government doesn't give a shit about day trading at all for rrsp since if you go 10x they still get 10x taxes since it's pre-tax money. Makes sense to me, but yeah, I'd say you're at risk for tfsa. Hard to say how often it actually happens due to fear mongering media maybe greatly exaggerating the frequency.

Makes sense - good response it‚Äôs nice to have some more substantive discussion on here
can i have one too?
I‚Äôve learned to never guarantee anything to anyone but I would feel comfortable with that position to say the least
I am personally not comfortable with a 7-10% assumption on gains (at least, not enough to make a major decision like retirement on) -- while this is historically accurate, I don't think the future will replicate that past, and so I assume a 6% return in my calculations, with a safe withdrawal rate of 3%. I know that's pretty conservative, but it helps me sleep at night without worry and also likely will be the basis for the philanthropy I'd like to do near the twilight of my life.

Are you saying you didn't know the market closes early the day after Thanksgiving?
Your max loss is the debit you pay for the option. If the debit is below your account balance, you're fine. Do some simple math and stay on top of your account balance and the options you're playing. If you are Buying to Open calls/puts you'll be fine. Selling to open or playing with margin is where people get themselves in trouble ie u/controlthenarrative. Hope this helps.
I definitely have some money set aside to sell naked calls -- definitely some idiots are going to buy calls on RBLX and lose bigly, I intent to profit

Maybe it was a value play at $4 - it isn‚Äôt at $16
Like I understand PLTR to some degree as they are getting nice government money and they‚Äôve sucked them into their platform. So yeah if you take $10B in future cash flow at 80% margin...okay I can rock with that. Should the market cap already reflect that future business iono..but I can see it. Now telling me Nio is ready  to be given that multiple as well..that‚Äôs just delusional
It may be $20 at end of year but it would create buying opportunity that would be gobbled up. I mean if pltr was $22  share i would buy everything i could on margin.

1/20/23 15C checking in... its like a millennia away
Yea same here, invested in PLTR sub 20 before I learned about this sub, was on r/stocks and saw this sub mentioned and its given me a laugh. PLTR has checked all the boxes in what im looking for in a company honestly. Customer base, proprietary tech, i dont see any competitors which mean they enjoy monopoly profits for maybe 1-2 years before a disruptor (if any) emerges. Its a solid company, a unique company, has a close proximity to the us govt and opening themselves for commercial use will net them even more profit.
I dunno, the holiday surge in cases and deaths are going to push ppl over the edge. Governments and local officials are having a tough time asking ppl to stay isolated with another lockdown. Noone wants to deal with this shit anymore. The thought of a vaccine being approved before the new year = a huge relief for everyone. It's quite a historical feat to develop a vaccine in 4 months for a global pandemic.

If you want the shares because you think they're going to increase in price you absolutely should exercise the option. You could also sell to close and open another call. Your choice. That's the awesome thing about brokerages now, we can completely control our own investing strategy and do it daily with our phones. Develop a strategy, try it, refine it, continue to execute. If you're going to exercise just make sure you have the capital to do so, and I wouldn't recommend doing it on Margin. Cheers.

gains and losses should definitely NOT be all put in one thread

they deserve their own threads
Estimated TAM of 2 million people and they can halve the price and still have decent margins...
Hold them til February/March  - gonna be a lot of bulls hit from both sides until then- future should be clearer after that.  But looks promising

Citron makes bias confirming research to justify/rationalize their positions.  There is a large amount of evidence and numerous formal complaints that they do so maliciously to profit off the people who follow their advice.  They tend to dump them in their DD in order to make money off the people who follow them.  They turn around on a dime to purchase the lower valued shares.

These guys need to be put of business.

Well I clearly missed the point, and it was a good one.  Thanks for breaking it down for my dumbass.
This guy simply ignored the many times where citron was right. This post is completely bias and a meme but it's funny to see how many people think it's true

Look at SOLO after last week citron's tweet (13$ to 8$) Nio was also already at 54$ before the tweet
That's just a multiple based on growth (which is going to be pretty meager, probably for 2022).

I don't think a 15x multiple is overly generous.
Lol this description
you guys should look at how much money it‚Äôs pulling in

 Zm earning predictions are so low. They are gonna crush it. But may still have a sell off
I honestly don‚Äôt see why everyone on here is so scared of PLTR now. Options exp on fridays, that means people sell. We all knew the price had to consolidate. People are gonna take profit. None of those statements mean the PLTR tendy machine is broken. 

What a bout citron? Fuck them. Not to get too tin foil here but maybe they want to tank these new stocks so boomer hedge portfolios can buy in. 

You want some free advice? If you see a stock run hard for 3 plus weeks, pick up some OTM puts for Friday‚Äôs. It‚Äôll hedge those meme portfolios.

Are we gonna see that one dude eat feces next Friday? I doubt it. Should you have bought the Black Friday sale? Yes. Expect monday an Tuesday to pump along with vaccine news. 


Tl/dr: if you sold near the top Friday, nice. if you didn‚Äôt buy the dip you a bitch.

You don't put it market orders, limit orders, etc. you put in the price you want to pay (bid) for the option or options and the brokerage will fill it when it finds someone willing to sell it for that. If you want to buy the thing 100% regardless of price bid the ask. It might be a few dollars, and might be worth it with slippage, but that's why the market is against traders like us. This is millions of dollars for Market Makers and huge funds so they won't budge, they make us budge. Hope this helps.
Inventory is the big question mark.  It's hard to know what sort of allotment GME gets on the consoles versus other retailers.  And yes, margins on the consoles are slim compared to everything else.  I took that into consideration.

20k for 400 x 10c at 0.50 for April 2021...  

You need to learn delta, theta and gamma, those are the most important when trading options. Think of yourself as Keanu Reeves in Speed, every option you trade is the bus (your premium) you‚Äôre on if your bus drops below 55 mph (your strike) the closer you are to blowing up (0). The speed is delta, the acceleration is gamma, and theta is the friction between your tires and the other cars ahead that slow the bus down. The higher your delta (the speed) the more your option(s) is worth, thus your vehicle doesn‚Äôt blow up. The closer the stock price is to your strike the more it increases in worth via gamma (it accelerates the change of speed/delta). If your speed doesn‚Äôt hit 55 you never make any money so theta are the cars that get in your way or the friction of your tires constantly taking you away from your speed (delta). The more time you have until expiry the less theta matters, the converse is true the less time you have the more that theta eats at your profit.  

I spent 20k back in May on 10c for 0.50/contract. At one point due to combination of theta and wide-bid ask spreads it went down to 0.33/contract. The closer it got to $10 the more it was worth, when it got to like 10.50 my option was worth about 3.68. But now that it‚Äôs way above my strike of $10 it‚Äôs worth way more
Hardly.  See my other comment.

Lick my dongus you fucking nerd.
Did... Did i just learn something?

MAAAAAAAAAAAAM!
Same - and all of them will skyrocket.

Postions: I have exactly 2 shares in each of those.
You realize that hedge funds and mm's don't just sell naked calls to people. Most institutions buy shares to hedge their position of short calls. Buying calls is a cheaper way to get shares bought, but it's just an institution buying those shares, not you.
As stock price increases, option price will increase. You can sell to close the call at any time for a profit. As it goes past strike, delta will go up, and the option will increase more in price the deeper ITM it goes. Hope this helps.
Yes, just find spreads you think are high probability 2-4 weeks out for 100-200% upside
Could be right - but I think their gains from the console sales are going to be short lived and they are constrained by inventory.

Margins on new consoles are small and they don‚Äôt have a competitive advantage against AMZN, WMT, BBY, TGT or anywhere else that is getting a console supply
Shut the fuck up... you don‚Äôt force a meme stock it just happens now go buy pltr calls.
PLTR closed at 46$ usd in European markets
But like let‚Äôs say the acquisition price for GME is $24. Then the next day it opens at $24, the 30c‚Äôs would just go to 0.01 no? Since they will be gauranteed below that strike by the end

I mean, I'm no expert but I guess they could. There are so many SPACs out there right now that it feels like anything could happen with many of them. The ones I listed all have either a known target company (Opendoor, Butterfly) or are led by someone like Ackman (PSTH) who I'm willing to put my faith in as far as choosing a good one.
Learn from it, shake it off, and pray PLTR moons next week.

Don‚Äôt swear off options because of some bad plays, swear off fomo-ing and FDs.

A baseball player who swings at terrible pitches expecting a HR doesn‚Äôt swear off baseball, they wait for the really ones next time. Wait for great set ups and options will reward you accordingly. 

People are successful with stocks because they give themselves time to be right. Do the same with options, it‚Äôs not necessarily that they are totally different games.

Also maybe learn some more complex options strategies, naked isn‚Äôt always the way.
Oh so now there is passive funds? I could have sworn you said there wasn't.

Oh look, here is your quote, "Yeah, show me all these passive ETF holdings. Because none of the Blackrock, Vanguard, or Fidelity funds with any sizeable holdings are passive."

Welcome aboard! You have the fifth largest GME position I‚Äôve tracked on WSB so far. I got in because of the three super-traders with 7-figure GME holdings. Yesterday found another with a mid-6 figure holding.

Here we are months later and this fucking spreadsheet is still cranking along the trajectory I originally laid out. I‚Äôve anticipated the vaccines beginning to ship since May-June. I‚Äôll stick with my original projection. This thing is going to heat up between now and the end of the year and peak as projected. 

MLK Day
Valentine‚Äôs
Ides of March
Easter
Tax Day

Peak? I think MLK is most likely.
Materially burned out? Easter.

Between the peak and seeing it tamped down to a smoldering level of background noise, it will be on a ‚Äúglide path‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúsaw tooth‚Äù gap down sort of thing. 

Even with a sudden change in social behavior, anyone living with a family member or a roommate will have several weeks of problems. 

The shift has already occurred. It‚Äôs not necessarily your own behavior. Your #1 infection risk is a family member. The virus will be wildly distributed by year end. Contact tracing will be impossible because each person will have so many possible sources of societal infections. 

Still think I need meds?

i've extensively backtested that, and the conclusion is spreads make your equity curve look like shit because the wing-hedge kills your profits. that included iron condors

the best equity curve i saw out of all the strategies was from systematically selling naked puts around 45-days out, preferably a bit below the market where skew is higher

About a year ago you could actually learn the Greeks from the daily thread.  Used to be a guy who had a really nice shorthand definition that would post it when it came up.

Pretty much the only reason why I'm so bullish on GME - the bond market knows what the equity has only started finding out. Bonds were trading 70 cents on the dollar - now over 100. Their liquidity ratios are as robust as can be. This is a fundamental value play

Some thoughts:

- I'm not sure what the benefit to the sub this is. Feels like larger attention just makes us more a target of the pump and dump schemes (granted they're all blatently retarded and easy to shoot down). More attention/ability to move markets will create a greater incentive to phone farm manipulate things. 

- All the accounting can be outsourced. I interned with a VC fund that went that route. Will look up the firm's name.

edit: Bridge Investment Group based in Sandy Utah, didn't hear of any issues with them. Had lunch with them once.
Don't worry. They will buy back in at a higher price. Buy high sell low. It is the way.

Once the extension happens (and it will) we‚Äôll see some more upside rolling into the merger. Once the merger hits sky‚Äôs the limit. Microvast has tech recognized by the American battery consortium. Awards for R&D top 100 and has personal investment awards by the likes of Ford and GM. QS will be small beans compared to the growth and outlook for this company
I‚Äôm slightly confused, when is it worth to sell calls vs just letting the option go through and purchasing the 100 shares?

If you sell the call, aren‚Äôt you simply going to start losing more money in as the price goes up? I don‚Äôt understand how people who but like 70 contracts which are probably naked call are able to profit so much :s
Yep search for one of the top ‚ÄúSears‚Äù posts here you‚Äôll see it at around 1.4k

People die everyday. Hes important because he created a huge business?
I'm gonna drill your mom with these puts.
Elaborate please. I made 100% on some calls last week on VALE, where do you think it'll end up?
I know everyone here says they‚Äôll buy way OTM GME calls in the case of a tender offer, but if the tender offer price is below the strike, wouldn‚Äôt the calls just go to .01 the next day and all IV would diminish?
Telos
Why not be a bi sexual and make spreads?

Good points.  I'm long, but have been since before Cohen stepped in.

I also don't see how any private equity investors would pay any sort of premium right now for GME.  I think even if Cohen had a plan for that, he's probably very dismayed at the run-up, because he's stuck now.  He can sell for the gain, but he's (or an investment group led by him) not going to pay $20/share for the rest of the company.

I think he would have paid $12, maybe.

But, I don't see it going back to $4 in the next year.  The console refresh gives them way more runway than that.  Just on a cash flow basis.
If the dems win georgia the algos will react so fast there is nothing we can do about it. Best to just stay long with some hedges

Robinhood does not support naked call selling. You have to own the shares to sell covered calls.
You can buy call options if you have options trading enabled on your acct. If you do this you can also sell naked puts but capital know as collateral will be held by robinhood.
Fuck! Looks like everyone sold their PLTR calls

Pricewise, yes. Percentage gain-wise, no. GME's gone up 6-8x from its lows from earlier this year. PLTR has gone up \~3x. Not discouraging you to make the jump, but just wanted to point this out.

Got positions both in GME and PLTR btw:

100 PLTR

this is literally the type of posts about cryptocurrency
Gotta maximize "profit"!
i am no expert either (like the most wsb autists here) but from what i get is that they already sold the position months before but the earliest news about ryan cohen stepping in and major changes possible are in september (?)

you can see on [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1618531200](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1618531200) that options being available for january 15th and april 15th - so they sold the position already. With a short ratio above 100% it is impossible to hedge and unwind their positions completely. I think they wont sell short (especially after friday) unless they perceive the whole ordeal way differently then we do...
Who knows what direction they will go with SweetWater though, hm? Perhaps they will find a way to avoid the gimmick with however they utilize it. Regardless, it is a weed company that is pursuing acquisitions. And that my friend, is as legendary as a Viking who lusts for what‚Äôs beyond the horizon. Why specialize in being the best baker in town when you could own the best baker and the best blacksmith and have them do your bidding for all time?

Not even close to the scale of AWS capability and market share tho.

I mean, either way I'm still moderately bullish on BABA as well but it's not really a value argument
There was similar news back in early or mid October that had no effect on Baba's stock price. I think it gets talked about so much, it's a show me the proof type of story. If the bill gets passed it could cause a sell off though, but seems unlikely.

There is some thought put into this. It‚Äôs purely psychological. I watched every type of asset explode in price due to extreme interest and not actual fundamentals.
Damn she must‚Äôve upped her prices
Swings picked up: Bili 12/18 75C (4875 basis), Tdoc 12/18 200C (4300 basis), Xpev 12/4 65C (4700 basis), Baba 12/4 277.5C (2275 basis), Ipob lotto: 12/18 25C (1250 basis).
Look at the IV.
i would feel foolish selling nio before they overtake toyota and sit second to tesla :). $150 is the very minimum

Congratulations. I tried studying engineering at a top 10 university but couldn‚Äôt keep up so I changed my major. I am wondering what your goals are in life, and what kind of lifestyle you want to live. You don‚Äôt work in engineering for whatever reason, which is fine, but you have a broken phone, old laptop, and eat ramen and borrow money for meals all while making lots of money in the market. Even if NIO does as well as you hope it will, how will you change your lifestyle as a result of your success? It seems to me like you are obsessed with the high of being right about NIO‚Äôs stock rising and don‚Äôt really care about the rest of your well-being. Is there anything you‚Äôd like to accomplish in your life? You won‚Äôt get a wife or have kids if you keep living at a bare minimum level. Just something to think about, finding sources of happiness other than seeing your stocks do well.

Depends on how you want to play it and how badly you want it tot close.  slippage could absolutely fuck you. But when you put in an ask that is essentially putting in a limit.
Shame, you picked poorly.
Are you sure about that? It does make sense but how are you sure? Everything I looked at is where I normally get information and it didnt say anything about that. Like if I'm looking at a company in Mexico their number are not in peso. So I'm just wondering how you got that info?

you need to be capable of making foresights, or at the very least listen to foresights of others online and be able to call bs for bs and agree when they make a legitimate good foresight. warren buffet doesn't understand a lot of the companies he invests in, he has underlings that report to him and brief him, and he calls bs on them or agree with their foresight. but you can't make foresights on your own if you're not consuming massive data, news, reviews, interviews on the company you're investing in

There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhigh chance‚Äù of a takeover. This is a myth made up by bulls with no basis in fact.

GME tried to sell itself in early 2019 and no one wanted to buy it. At that time it was trading around where it is now. And at that point it had a higher book value and sales that were more than 25% higher

Anyone who buys this company would be setting their money on fire. It might make for a quick trade that now tards are piling in but it is going to be back to $4 per share a year from now

It‚Äôs a fair point. Most reliably profitable company stocks that pullback, as $STMP has, dip into the oversold zone before busting back up. A stock can only go down so much before the institutions see a bargain. And they‚Äôll be tripping over each other to get in before February earnings. I think above $200 is a safe assessment in the next month or so.  I believe $STMP‚Äôs pattern is fairly clear in this regard. This quarter will be the most profitable quarter in $STMP‚Äôs company history. And the expansion into China with BABA using their subsidiary is perhaps the tip of the iceberg as to expansion to come. $STMP seriously outperforms her sector peers.

All the same, there are options strategies we can use to hedge against the risk and profit no matter wha she does
The revenue estimates for next year are quite a bit too low, at roughly $6B.  I think that'll be close to $7.0-$7.2B  but is partially offset by a revenue mix consisting of lower margin sales (new consoles and new games have lower margins than their big cash cow which was the resale of used games).

So, I put earnings roughly in the neighborhood of $1.50-$1.70.  That's going to be front loaded into the first half of the year.

That's all predicated on no substantial changes to their current strategy.  Assuming they listen to Cohen and pivot in a meaningful way, that could change.
Fuck you I came here for that. Imagine the interest rate and foreclosed price rn.

My options can't go less than 0 right ?

I bought a shit load of calls but wasn't sure if if I can lose more than what i invested.
Their market cap is only $1B and their financials are surprisingly nice. Not a solid long term play, but certainly undervalued at the moment.

Yeah or ghetto spread but it‚Äôs not the same date. Ideally I‚Äôd want to collect the premium from the weekly and still keep the January call
Because it‚Äôs cuck, what they do
Will make for an interesting life in 20years when they buy ancestry kits!
you're right: $50 will also do for me
Question: you said RH will automatically sell options if you do not have the money in your account to exercise and it‚Äôs close to strike on the day of expiration...
How do the 0 DTE work with RH? Can I purchase a 0 DTE hours before market closes and at what time will RH automatically close positions?
Right? Cause if we knew we wouldn‚Äôt be here. So what‚Äôs TSLA eow?
gotta love how they bitch about bears lacking DD, but their DD consists of   
"It GoOD IdEa. MoOn hAve GraVitY toO"
The lack of PLTR talk is worrisome
Yes. Again proof that inversing leads to the big gains!

Honestly though, the DDs seem to play out alright. Its the shit in the daily thread that consistently fails. Maybe this one will work lol
You said huh when that guy just explained it to you

Citron literally raised their price prediction for PLTR from $15 to a higher value, and people got mad.

My understanding is they suck the dick of the intelligence community for the scraps that Booz and Leidos, formerly SAIC, doesn't take, but they wrap their ````import scikit-learn```` and sharepoint formatting around some "data science" buzzwords to be a tech company instead of an IT services company.  
Still potentially going to the moon though.

Any company that adheres to an external audit can stay. Any that declines was probably bullshit to begin with.

Skeptical 20X was possible holding ITM LEAPs but I was too busy white knuckling my mouse trying not to sell off my equity portfolio to even open the option chains.
better reasoning than any kid had who was bearish on PLTR. gg
No one mentioned webull?
I don't see unethical behavior. We just try to do our job.

It is scalable because surveys were conducted for high net worth individuals worth 2, 5 and 10 million. The results indicated a large portion of them were interested in suborbital tourism and many said they would pay for the experience. Given the numbers they would have a strong demand for many years that they alone would not be able to meet. They decided to stop ticket sales at 600, when they were available.

This was only the in the United States, there is likely demand in other contries and their CEO has alluded to plans to expand  into other countries. 

Their ultimate goal is not space tourism but point to point travel, but this is at least 5 years away. 

However the current model is projected to be successful.

Well I understand that and you understand that, but the kind of people who follow conspiracy theories don't and a lot of people in the MAGAverse might not either
im nervous about missing out on buying more PLTR at market open
The lockup expiry will be another catalyst
This mans just getting started, set a goal to a million and then pull out
Damn alright yeah I‚Äôll wait till new games come out

Bitch why does every shill have to assume I need a fucking tasty trade video to learn something...your wife‚Äôs other boyfriend taught me the Greeks after finance class...
A lot of people are going to get wiped out, options traders and stock traders, quit the stock market because it's bullshit and the self-fulfilling prophecy of wealth gap and low market participation will continue
I'm pretty sure it's going to reach 40$ Monday.

PLTR is going to master UI against the gay bears
Ohhh ok. I see where you're going with this. This might actually work!
IT WILL BE PALANTIR DAY
They call that a dip smh it got bought so fast
Because it borders market manipulation when they dump it just to get in at a lower price. Did the same shit with NVDA. Always coincidentally timed DD
Take your dick out like a man and buy it. PLTR is üöÄüöÄ come Monday.

I‚Äôve got 1,300 shares and 30 35c 12/24s so I think I can weather a dip and still expire ITM
I‚Äôve been a big fan of team. Currently holding a lot of shares since $170. I‚Äôm a software engineer and I‚Äôve been using the atlassian stack for about 5 years. Great products. They are like the Microsoft office to running software teams and IT teams.
...
Nice find. Looks like early week volatility for the Gyna shares. Marked Wednesday down on calendar.
This. 

OP gunna lose it all and turn into a bearded alcoholic who never leaves his basement going nutso over how rich he could‚Äôve been.
hell naw. If imma subscribe you just do gain porn on PLTR . Would get me hard errryday
knee fluid.... the fuck?
Exp?
I bought them yesterday at 15.25 with 1/15 expiry
Im fine with that lol, may the tendies rain down on you and your loved ones
His mom is going down????

Pics of mom.   Or ban! 


PUTS on his mom?   Doesn't that mean the underlying stock is going down?  Sooooo
Pretty sure OP is talking about the fact that a PA judge upholds Halt to certify election and says that mail in voting violates the constitution of Pennsylvania. With the same violations and ignoring proper processes for changing the rules of voting. With that coming out there is a real possibility that the other litigations find the same.

If that we're to happen, what would REGN do?
Time in the market beats timing the market
Nio was up 300% this year at one point when it hit $9 a share. It's now $54 a share so what's your point? GME has more room to run
[deleted]
You should know that in retard land it absolutely does and $27 is low brb nerd company with government terrorist contracts trading 1/8 of a really not good tasting fake burger company
That is part of the reason the ss isn't going to happen. Shorts are covering. Its not like that have been short since $4 and waiting to cover. GME does enough volume to allow many shorts to cover intraday.
They make a lot of their revenue now on merchandise, their stores are packed with minatures and stuff now. Also have a deal with microsoft to take a percentage of all digital sales related to Xbox.

I still don't believe in them, but just pointing it out. The cringe is still palpable when you walk in with all the neck beards working (both male and female).

 If they'd just exlusively hire big tiddy goth girls for working the counter, 500 a share would be simply the first stop on the moon mission.

1117 shares at 27.3 usd - im not fucking selling
That's quite possible but until I lose all my money I'm still long baby
Yes they do, it‚Äôs called Alibaba Cloud
I don‚Äôt have any positions and this still made me hard
Ah yes, buy Sears, the delisted bankrupt stock
I want you to consider this: slowly liquidate your position over the next couple of weeks, take these gains to a financial professional, and ask what's the best way to diversify. Even $1 million in SPY will yield $15k a year in dividends right now, and that's not even the best yield you can get. There's a couple of high-yield ETFs that would pay $55k/year with $1 mil invested. That kind of peace of mind means you can buy anything you want outright, not have to worry about losing your job, and still have a stable income. Hell if you want to leave 10% in your position for fun by all means, you earned it. And if NIO goes to $200 by expiry like you think that's another 600k for you to fuck around with.  


Or, y'know, shoot for the moon. If it crashes to $15, I'm sure you'll have no regrets.
I meant dips on the price of his mom.
Martingale strategy.
I sold pltr at the top yesterday, tempted to get back in at a cheaper price but every time I double dip i lose all my profit so for that reason I'm out
During the initial lockdown period, there was less work. People werent' going to the doctor as much and it was nice because we weren't working late nights. Things have picked up since. Lots of covid samples.

From a specific social perspective he's right. As far as the french nobles were concerned, anybody descended from peasantry with no titles or birthright that had money was living above their means, because you couldn't buy lineage, only hope to marry into it. The rich commoners using their money to buy influence and trying to get their sons and daughters wed into the olde garde was the very definition of "living above your means" to the nobles of the time.
Hmmm, now that's an idea. Maybe I can get people to subscribe to see my Plasma Donating skills.
This is the way.
85. You have to step up to 99 series if you want 75inch+ I believe.

And 99 series is super expensive and not worth the bang for the buck. 85 series is slightly dimmer, but it has everything the 90 series has.

Sky is literally the limit get in
If I buy a call and put for the same price and expiration, I literally can't lose money, right?  It's like betting black, red, and green at roulette!
nah they good
what about young studs with money?
Might retest 50 first

Changes all the time. Monday, PLTR has the most spotlight after Citron called it "no longer a stock but a full casino." There was a descent selloff for it yesterday which leaves a lot of people wondering what will happen on Monday. Otherwise SPY is always a good one.
This just got me so hyped.   I‚Äôm selling my truck and buying $50,000 more on Monday.   Love techno Viking.
You are in the denial stage üòÄ
What do you think of Covance? Had a job interview to be like coordinator there.
Ya I am. Lots of people get upset when I say truth. All the pltr cucks looking for 50 but theyll see teens prob.
Exactly, everyone makes fun of the ‚ÄúGME SquEeZe aNY Day NoW!!1!‚Äù But if had bought the stock or LEAPS at any point this year you‚Äôd be up bigly
Because they put out ‚Äúresearch‚Äù to make the stock drop and then buy the dip. They own over 1% of PLTR. Market manipulation at its finest
Jan 20C , the squeeze just began.
You can take your morals and shove them up your butt. Invest with your autistic brain, not your heart. ü§ô
technically yea

even without a squeeze there is a high chance of a hostile takeover and ryan cohen is really prominent in that field (visionary/e-commerce) and not only is GME heavily shorted but also really undervalued

even if there is no squeeze but ryan cohen steps into the company and pulls of chewy 2.0 for gamestop we will talking about lots of tendies possibly like in the style of tesla? i mean we have seen crazier things...

&#x200B;

/edit: bad wording maybe... the business as it is now does not justify the price

what we are paying for right now is the chance for tendies (there are EV companies not producing and valuated quite high...)
Go Pack Go, we support palantir
The put premiums are ridiculous too, at least on Nio anything a month out the stock needs to drop at least 15% to 60% to be at breakeven.
Hell yeah. 

Cyber Monday now renamed to pltr Monday 

Let's goooo baby
Bro I wish I bought pltr. I read it as plantir and I thought it was like a potting soil company and was like dam that‚Äôs gay

She likes to pull back after ER‚Äôs. Market makes take their profit and wind up for another quarterly run. Usually takes 15-30 days or so to reverse the trend. It‚Äôs getting to about that time. And the holidays in the COVID environment will be huge for $STMP
extra money to buy pltr
I'm getting almost the same amount, but in CAD.

The Canadian government is offering some money to anyone who get's covid (who doesn't have sick leave benefits at their job), so it would be nice if the virus struck me sometime.
How very wallstreetbets of you, please bang my wife

You gotta just smash the ask when it starts ripping like that
ok lets say the short sellers feel the danger of a squeeze and already buy back little by little in the next weeks. then the squeeze wouldnt happen right? it would still increase prices tho, right?

the only way to loose money is when the shorts are right and gme fucks up.

also to what price would it need to go to scare the first short sellers?

Bro I buy weeklies
Yeah I think people are grossly overestimating the GME squeeze. VW was an entirely different beast because Porsche owned so many shares the liquidity plummeted. They sold around 5% of the float after the squeeze to let shorters out their positions which is why it only lasted a couple of days. Given GME has a huge retail ownership I doubt the squeeze will be very dramatic

This is exactly what I thought on Wednesday, and so I sold. And guess what happened? It fell on Friday.

You're right, most people have it. PLTR will only go up if

a) People who sold, buy back

b) People who bought calls decide to buy shares

c) People who own shares simply purchase more

Exactly, both companies are bets. NIO just so happens to have a greater risk reward. Always put in what you can lose and not cry about afterward. As always, $65, $70, $75 strike prices are also available for lower risk / reward.

Starlink is supposed to provide internet to rural counties and the boonies where they don't even get reliable 4g yet and where the natives will actively rebel against 5G because they think it causes cancer.

Starlink will also be big outside America in less developed countries that definitely don't and won't have 5g for a while.

Just throwing this out there, but the Chewy founder has publically stated that his entire portfolio (including savings) is in Apple stock.

Tbh, its going to come down. I plan to enter around 20-25 mark. Set a 5% stop loss and wait for it to bottom out. Then re-enter at a more sensible price. Unless this is money you're happy to invest long term but if that was the case you would not be sweating. Not a great entry price for a swing trade but if you have any more cash on hand you could also dca down. Ultimately JMIA is the AMZN of Africa and will inevitably sky rocket.

With that said, a lot of the top comments here are really childish such as: "XYZ stock to the moon! \*rocketship\* \*rocketship\* \*rocketship\*" Really weird.

my idea is that PM's are down recently due to bullishness in equities and overall sentiment since PM's are viewed as a "safe haven".  Even though they do benefit from dxy crush.  Makes sense that the more industrial metals are green as hell.  If you think of it this way as people are all in on economic recovery right now and they'd benefit.

It could also be PM's leading a downturn in equities, but if this were the case I'd expect the other metals to not be so fucking green.

Anyone sell calls against their last couple PLTR leaps? Sold a 12/4 36C against my January 23C on Friday. If it expires ITM I‚Äôm fine with that but wondering if I should buy it back for more upside
lol daug anything that isn't the quo here gets banned and hated on. but if u just give a couple raesons for analysis it will def get more respect, like bringing in gamma's or something. personally PLTR is a toss up short term, but LT theres just no way it won't be up. good luck g

Yo, share that position! I actually was contemplating this strategy
What are the most solid public companies doing automation related business?
I don‚Äôt doubt what you‚Äôre saying but they‚Äôve been in business for years and this IS their business.  Sure, they may be just saying dumb shit for shock value BUT we‚Äôre a bunch of douche bags on Reddit who do little more than google our plays.

Confucius say:  When old wise man speak, always consider what they say.
My uneducated guess would be that not everyone is buy and hold, so even people that are currently invested will continue to buy back in as they sell off options or roll into later expiry‚Äôs. Everyone that cashed out last week on 11/27C‚Äôs are still likely to have bought further out at close or waiting to buy back in on Monday.
Sure but you are also forgetting EV is a hotter trend in 2020 arguably than 2015.

NIO doesn‚Äôt have to be superior in tech. It can sit comfortably at #2.

Also, NIO is rumored to announce 2 new sedans in January 2021, which can honestly be real Tesla Model 3/S competitions. This can easily increase deliveries as well.

Also if NIO is open to Baas for all EV companies that want to license their battery service. Who know what the CCP will allow it or not ?

In my opinion, Tesla to Nio, could eventually be Uber to Lyft in comparison. Both thriving their individual ways & both with their own cult following to the brand. 

As for shorting the stock, yea you can do it but when do you stop shorting the stock? Just like Palantir, can it be a $50 stock then we short that? Entry is just as important as the exit.
Thank you retard

I think we essentially agree on the major points here. I don‚Äôt judge people for prostitution, drug selling or anything like that. Fuck it you gotta survive, and no one can pick the circumstances they‚Äôre born into.

In a better world we‚Äôd redirect money to help improve the lives of people born into bad situations. In this one we just call them had people and throw them in jail so it makes it harder for them to ever climb out of poverty. 

The money angle is just to be financially secure. Life isn‚Äôt about money to me, it‚Äôs about being financially secure enough to not have to work.

I resent the fact that if I didn‚Äôt get up every day and work, I‚Äôd eventually end up on the street. If I could become wealthy enough to not have to work, I‚Äôd probably still work, but it would be nice knowing I could stop if I wanted to
Maybe it costs a couple million dollars - that's chump change - in all honesty theyve probably already started reserving for this so it wouldn't even hurt earnings.

Good , insightful write up

As someone who already had the general gist of everything you explained , I do have a question. 

When I‚Äôm scrolling through the list of options for a stock , why are some green when others are red(different % change) ? 

Isn‚Äôt the only variable strike price ? So shouldn‚Äôt the contract furthest from the strike price have the least beneficial % change?
Don't get me wrong, because I love solar, but it's been on a fucking moon mission for months now and is getting pretty overvalued. A lot of the gains that happened in the earlier part of the Fall were because the market anticipated a Biden win and then further gains have happened once this was confirmed. My fear would be that it's gonna basically be "sell the news" after this and any disappointment is gonna hurt.

I agree about Georgia. If this happened we'd probably see a huge surge because it'd be such an unexpected outcome. I've been slowly taking gains from the sector and moving on. My last play is CSIQ and I'm looking to cash out within 2 weeks.

I've had my head up my own ass for most of this year and am new to this whole SPAC craze.

Essentially, can't a SPAC spend all of their raised funds on an empty shell of a company then declare bankruptcy?

Example of a traditional company that fked me. CALL/Magicjack had something like 60m in cash and had a mkt cap of 70m, so I figured hell, this seems like a bargain. So what they did was spend 50m on a business down the street from me. I went to the VOIP business they bought and it's a single floor of a dilapidated office building.

Do you catch my drift.
Lol no. Thnx
Put it in PLTR weeklies 20% otm...it will be more then enough by then
Also look at share liquidity
PLTR is going to be worth more than amzn one day
PLTR is not very coherent.
yes PLTR Formula
anyone know how much more TSLA index funds have to buy?
Link it
I am very dumb and very new. If I was smarter, I would have resisted fomo and simply rode my other call (12/31 21c @3.40) to sweet, sweet profit. The big brain moment where I started to feel like I could be one of these idiots posting green all day every day is when I realized that the call itself has value and could be sold at a profit or loss. Doing that does not require exercising the option for $3100 and then selling the stock. 

So, my plan was to buy high and sell higher like everyone else. And that's what I plan to do because PLTR is actually a good stock - which is to say it is peak dystopian capitalism and will probably literally an evil movie corporation in real life, a al OmniCorp, Cyberdyne, or Delos Inc. It should be higher (üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ). 

Now, my other call at 12/31 21c... That's actually is something I am considering exercising like a chad. Again, I believe that the underlying company is a good one. At $21, it is a tempting long term investment (I also hold 10 shares outright that I bought at $15.80 when I first started looking at wsb and wimped out on buying options). On the other hand, that sounds a lot like r/investing and so no. Some retirement firm should definitely do that and buy my calls from me at a profit when this turns around, but I am going to keep an eye here and jump in on other things like $SEARS.
It sucks for the people who went in on Friday opening at 32, only for it to drop down to 27.5 by end of day.
23c and 35c 12/18
tempting idea to go put spreads...
The numbers are insane here. The stock price is close to what the company is worth in CASH!

To squeeze the juice out of this Citron.
Look it up, PLTR only has like 20% of the total shares trading I believe, then after next earnings the shares will ‚Äúunlock‚Äù meaning the insiders holding them will be allowed to sell, we might see a drop then but we are talking jan-feb when earnings come out... Until then there are less shares available on the market and high demand, that can make prices go to crazy numbers...
I bought more on Wednesday $9 and $10 strike just for fun.

Agreed. The tricky part is that Citron is not always wrong, one out of 50 times they might be right once. So I generally ignore them.

Guys, i actually think that i have a problem. I've made so much good money from this, and i keep checking this sub/RH/bank account every 10 minutes, i need to stop im addicted
I'm deep into this one, but I admit the squeeze hypothesis is heavily contingent on Cohen. Think of it like this: ignoring Cohen, GME has risen and then precipitously fallen around the past two console cycles. Would the shorts rather weather the storm for a couple quarters and lose X dollars on lending fees, afterwards making absolute bank when the company crashes again like it always has, or lose 10-20X dollars trying to cover their position?

Shorts stand to lose far more money in a squeeze situation. Who's to say they don't pay Cohen off NOT to instigate a vote/takeover? Who's to say that wasn't his plan by publicly putting on a show in the WSJ, surreptitiously gaining the attention of banks who stand to lose significantly in the squeeze scenario?

Ergo, I think the squeeze is almost entirely contingent on the hail Mary of Cohen buying a controlling stake and calling a vote. I'm hoping for the latter, but I'm nervous we're so heavily relying on a single person.

&#x200B;

Position: Shares and calls, various strikes and dates.
Doing my civic duty. $SEARS
This is probably the only thing that kept TSLA from breaking $600 honestly.
$Sears longest expiry highest strikes available on THE FIRST HOUR options begin trading. I‚Äôll be posting as soon as I see, same as I did for PLTR.  Still own at least some of my day 1 leaps.
Just ban them instead of wasting time removing posts.
If everyone is already all in on PLTR how does it go up? If the rest of the world is like "nah, it's too high" where are the new buyers coming from? Are we banking on people FOMOing into PLTR? What's the goddam plan!?

God I love this sub, the autism runs so deep that people throw their whole Wendy's paycheck into a company and dont bother to visit it's website.

Here's a real answer; Palantir is a company that creates software that integrates data.  The focus is on making all of your various systems talk to each other.  This has obvious uses for the US government (COVID shined the spotlight on how disjointed a "state by state" aproach for anything can be) but there are lots of applications in businesses also.  

Basically, their software makes it so the USER doesnt do anything different, but management can see an integrated view.  Think each manufacturing site for a big company getting to keep their dumb ass excel files, but regional and global managers seeing everything racked up in a meaningful view in a mouse click.

The best part for Palantir is that unlike most of their competitors, they dont treat your data to fit their software, they apply their software to your data.  Meaning that your contract is up, no problem, they walk - keep you janky ass data the way it was 5 years ago, CEO's LIVE to learn new software packages.  Their solution is very sticky for this reason, meaning once they have you, they dont let go.  

Does this kindergarten view of the company translate to gains?  My retirement sure hopes so, but thats your call.  I think most people on this train are looking long on Palantir.

Short interest was over 100% as of 10/30. Before the recent 60% jump. When they update the short numbers on 11/30 I‚Äôll take a look at it. Shorts could be down to 30% at this point for all you know. 60 million shares outstanding and 7 million in volume daily, lots of chances for those shorts to get out this month. The shorts exiting wouldve only been about half this months volume. The key to a real short squeeze is no liquidity. And you guys pumping it has given the shorts all the liquidity they need to exit without pumping the price
Fidelity won't let me place a limit order more than 50% above the current price... Is this a common restriction, or just on Fidelity? Can't find info on Google :(

Boomers have been looking for a reason to short the shit out of it and I see that continuing into Monday morning. I think PLTR will rally when the detractors have moved on and WSB bulls continue to meme it. If Citron is right, might buy March 2021 $30 calls if they go on sale

I know a way many of you autists can make guaranteed tendies on UPWK. They are the biggest? or one of at least the biggest freelance marketplaces online. They also are the only one that has a section where only US citizens are allowed. This creates an opportunity for enterprising autists to create an account where they lie about their skills and claim to be a skilled senior programmer who is good at lots of languages and specialties. Using their fake experience they can get contracts to do various tasks or jobs and outsource that work to Indian programmers or other similar low cost of living places who are better than most of the US  programmers on the site and are happy to work for a cheap rate to get access to US clients. I did this for a while and kept around 25% of the profit after taxes for doing nothing except applying to jobs and handing off the work. Sometimes I would take a job paying $1000 for a simple website and get an indian to do it for like $200. Its free money

So don‚Äôt buy PLTR then, if you short it you will get scorched.
Depends where you buy. Online retailers (apmex, provident, etc.) are usually the highest, eBay is better but you have to put in the time to make sure it‚Äôs legit, then if you‚Äôre lucky there are brick and mortar shops with good prices
Nope
PLTR has no correction ;)

I had an interview with the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the interviewer was a first rate cocksucker, and not like Mike or Steve at my local gloryhole.  

He started puffing his chest about how they do all this shit to protect both the taxpayer and soldiers by preventing fraud. 

The next thing I heard in my brain was ‚ÄúKOBE!!!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, such as the findings by the GAO of inappropriate relationships with prime vendors such as Boeing?  Or only evaluating about 1% of contracts?......‚Äù

If this happens I‚Äôm shorting the fuck outta it the beginning of next year

Tesla back in 15‚Äô averaged about 15K deliveries and was worth just under 40 billion. nio last and best quarter was 12K deliveries they valued at 73 billion

in 2016 Tesla was averaging 25k deliveries and was worth almost 60 billion

If it hits $90 a share imagine paying triple than what Tesla was worth in 2015 double compared to 2016 for a shitty company like nio, worse financials than Tesla, less deliveries than Tesla did in 2015, larger float, shitty car with inferior tech and just straight up a knock off version of Tesla.

Puts on PLTR
3 years of growth. No corrections at all lol
Yeah idk about their finances but GameStop sucks cock. Every mention of them in the past is how awful their customer support is, their prices for buying games from you and how they manage to not have stock of the next generation of console or certain games when that‚Äôs literally their only fucking job. 

All that said I‚Äôm gonna buy some shares because FOMO :(

[deleted]
I mean analysis says buying PLTR is a bad move. I think there are just more buyers than sellers in general. Market participation is at all time highs.
It‚Äôs been a month when they told me to call them but I haven‚Äôt and they still haven‚Äôt approved me for options trading.
People playing these meme stonks thinking they are all ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù or going to ‚Äúchange the world‚Äù weren‚Äôt around for the @LT coin boom in 2017. 

Every week there was a new flavor with government contracts, corporate backings, and tech that was ‚Äúunseen‚Äù before. 

Some of those are still around but the price targets NEVER came close. 

Moral of the story: play the swings but stop losing money diamond handing your shit til expiration.
I'm enjoying it. Lots of game modes and it looks real pretty. It is, at the end of the day, just another COD tho. Havent bought one in a few cycles so I said fuck it.
Which SPACs are the Best Buy rn?
I‚Äôm here for the tendies
To a point, yeah. Idk how much gamma squeezing there is on this one tho since retail is selling a lot of covered calls lol

I actually love the GME play and got in  latea in the high $9's. Cashed out the day after Microsoft news. Back in now let's ride
Government contracts, big data, only $27 wtf??? If freaking PTON and CHWY and every other dumbass company can make it to $70+ why not a company full of freaking nerds with government contracts.

Also the fact they don‚Äôt make money is super bullish. Snap finally reported .01 eps and doubled its share price overnight. Just hold PLTR forever or at least wait for a bounce and leave with a profit. Never sell for loss.

Why are people guaranteeing a weed moon Monday?
Good man. I got in too tho 12.98 in premarket Friday
I wouldnt be shocked if it opened Monday at 30 and dipped, because it has tended to do that prior to mooning. For Monday though, I‚Äôm concerned that if it dips too far, the fear caused from the Friday correction could cause some more panic selling. If I get back in Monday, my timing will have to be perfect.

I hear ya. I made a lot on tesla last week and beat spiderman already, so I said fuck it. 70 is steep af for a video game.
I like this idea dude. Also since people here have trouble managing their gains and diversifying you can make a nice little hedge fund- it costs $100 per month or whatever, dividends paid out quarterly, use it to buy the underlying meme stocks where everyone has calls like SoftBank. If everyone on this sub made gains and bought in we‚Äôre talking $100 million per month. $1.2 billion isn‚Äôt a huge swinging dick but in a world where everything is passive it‚Äôs enough to move the needle.
You know i got the exact same results for all those months!! WE ARE RIGHT üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

With a minority or even a bare majority it will be hard to get a huge spending plan through. I'm still bullish long term but I think before the Georgia election is a good time to close out most of your positions. Maybe just have a little open to catch the brief euphoria if somehow the Dems win.

I'm all about trading the high volume meme stocks for profit.  I just like to fully arm myself by understanding the underlying realities of the stocks I trade.  I have more confidence then sitting in some stocks longer and others I try to pick my exit points out early before support falls out and the stock corrects hard.  Good stocks tend to bend and go sideways.  Other stocks that have clearly blown past realistic valuations or are fundamentally dogshit are the ones that correct hard and wipe your short term option plays.

Crazy thing is their CEO actually looks like the kind of guy that would be pumping young peeps blood. He‚Äôs straight out of a movie or show.
They are all going to get a bunch of attention when they complete their mergers and the stock tickers change. If I were going to buy puts I would wait until then and buy after that pop.
If you are patient I think you can get back in cheaper then 29-30$ honestly... And the only thing Citron said was 20$ price target for 2020... that‚Äôs it...
I predict them getting delisted due to the bill that‚Äôs getting voted on next week.

This is the way
these new ev companies don't have unsold inventory, they're built to order, customer customizes how they like their car and the car is assembled and delivered in 3 to 8 weeks. but nio does pay a penalty when they sell not enough cars to their joint venture partner JAC, that's why had such huge losses in past years, once they are selling sufficient cars not only are they no longer paying the penalties, they are simultaneously making profit on the vehicles. im making my valuation of nio by comparing it to Toyota's valuation; I see Toyota as Nokia for phones; and Nio as Huawei for phones.
clowns like you said the same thing about NIO yet the rocket kept going...
Severely undervalued??? The fuck?

There's a bull case for BABA but it's not value lol

There's this online gambling thing where you hold until the number crashes. If you click the button before it crashes you'll get x times the money. 

But if it crashes you're fucked. 

I don't see much difference between that and what OP is doing.
[deleted]
Depends what shows more potential, weed or PLTR.
[deleted]
Honestly, use it as a compass for day trades. 

Did I play NIO? Yup. 

Will I play PLTR? Yup, if it gets back down around 20-23. 

Will I hold longer than a day? Not a chance.
How‚Äôd that work out for ya?
My point is, a lot of their predictions continue to rise long after their short. Their shorting tweets cause only short term damage, the stocks that continue to go down were going to anyways. They don't have a good track record and shouldn't be relied upon for long term decision making. Their tweets are not indication of the future, many other factors are though.

Forreal it‚Äôs so bad I‚Äôve considered buying pltr so I can stop being annoyed every time I see it
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, especially with a strong shift to PC hardware and PC gaming in general.  I‚Äôm an idiot (as is tradition on this sub) and trying to buy everything for a proper PC build in America is a horseshit process. I don‚Äôt know what the hell I‚Äôm doing and it‚Äôs so hard to get everything purchased after you use the PC builder website.  If GameStop could combine those and actually have the logistics figured out they‚Äôd be BLOWING up. Business is simple - take something that‚Äôs hard/complicated, then make it stress free and easy for retards to figure out. And make sure it‚Äôs super accessible to buy. 

I was thinking the other day, it‚Äôs kinda lame the only way to buy games on my Xbox is through the Microsoft store. There‚Äôs no competition. And I‚Äôm not some stupid fucking boomer still buying disks.  Does anyone know if there is a pathway where 3rd party retailers could become a digital purchase option on the new consoles? If so, that could be their ticket to a modern transformation. 

Problem with that though - what happens to the used/trade in business? Not sure how that‚Äôd work with a move to digital.

Just accept the fact that this sub sucks ass now. Even if they had a huge team of active mods they would be removing posts constantly. There's so many users posting constant shit about YOLOing their Christmas money and rocket ship emojis, it's just beyond saving.
what the fuck is lucid trading
Yeaaaa
so yea it has dropped 5 % now it's time for its 14% rise

Who else is buying some more PLTR first thing monday?
Me as deadlines continue to come crushing down
Bonus points with TSLA is, that it only needs some desperate idiot claiming it was with FSD to try cover up his own fuck up.
now thats a fucking throwback
Sounds good, bought more PLTR
I said it in the other thread but if we hit $40 by dec 18 I'll donate $500 to my local food bank. Mark it.
Sounds like a 10% profit to me

Ill place a 10 share limit order at my BE for my 12/4 call ($28.50). It aint much, but its literally the rest of my buying power.

Great question. See the ‚Äúwar‚Äù section here: https://www.tradinganalysisresources.com/2020/06/event-driven-investment-trading.html?m=1


BUY/LONG: Gold (GOLD/GDX/AUY/GLD/GDXJ), Volatility (VIX/VIXY/VIXM), Cloud Security Firms (HACK, CRWD/FEYE), Oil (USO), Government Defense Contractors (XAR/NOC/GD/LMT/RTX/ITA).
might throw a $100 at it.
Even if you are form a business and say the car is an expense- you can write the whole cost off this year.
what he said isn‚Äôt true, people say it a lot but it‚Äôs just a misconception, a sell limit does nothing to stop your shares being lent out.

Ok?
Yea but options and hold thr earnings? Tell me your experience once you try it jf you insist lol
Is it higher than 100% in real float. Yeah probably. The buyback, bullish options and a potential proxy war are all enticing. 

Is it 12:1.  Not a chance. 

Based on VW, you would need a 33:1 to reach $500. 

I'm bullish on GME but I don't think that price is realistic.

Manage your emotions. No point in worrying about things like that you cannot control.
I don't doubt that NIO is a decent or even good company long term.  We're not really debating that anymore.  It's established lots of good things that will grow going forward.  It's now a debate of what is fair valuation.  What are the estimates and what does that actually translate to in revenue, and how reliable are the estimates, how much should we discount them, and what are competitive threats.  And it's valuation today November 2020 vs valuation November 2025.  These are still fundamentally CAR companies, bending steel, low margin, long term expenses repairs/recalls/warranties/unsold inventory.  Not high margin, rapidly scalable tech where sometimes you can establish moats.  A car is a car is a car.  Switching cost is near nil.

‚ÄúLittle late‚Äù, valuation is only around $800M still. Honestly if Nikola can run up to a $10B+ valuation I don‚Äôt see why QS can‚Äôt, both no product or revenue but at least QS isn‚Äôt being investigated by the SEC and DOJ for fraud.
Well, if the head of GM wants to keep her job, she'll have to dump more money into a semi and pickup truck that're missing drivetrains. I don't know... the gamble is cheap I suppose if you're buying the puts and not selling them.

I bought them and been selling option premium. I checked their financials and they aren‚Äôt terrible. I think they survive in the near term at least. Heavily shorted stock, so there is good potential for a short squeeze.

Not really, we are talking about marginal tax rates. Though it would be less if OP is already a high earner, sure.
Yes and I‚Äôm waiting with more to get in on any big dips... my average is around let‚Äôs say 20$
Personally I don‚Äôt see this dipping that much, maybe 10%-20% monday. People talk about how they won‚Äôt be scaling their battery tech for several years, but that clearly doesn‚Äôt matter when a company like Nikola can run up a $10B+ valuation while having no product or revenue for several years as well. They will also be paying GM to make their vehicles which means they‚Äôll have garbage margins, whereas QS will be developing and making their battery tech themselves.
If I do it im yoloing
Set up another account on a different app and be conservative. Even with a cash account, if you use unsettled funds to buy a new stock, then sell it before the funds from the former stock settles (2 days) it's a violation.

Man, wsb has devolved into one-track posting - first it was NIO, now PLTR - yeah we've had trends before but it's kind of obnoxious when almost every single post on the first two Hot pages is the same ticker day after day, until it runs out of steam and people start losing money.

What I think will be a huge boost is Biden‚Äôs pick for National Intelligence, Avril Haines. She was a former consultant to PLTR. And knows it‚Äôs value. 

Not that the government isn‚Äôt already using PLTR technology. It‚Äôs been the only reason ICE can conduct massive raids and take huge swaths of people at one time. The data mining technology analyzes people‚Äôs interpersonal relations. And the CEO just signed another controversial contract with ICE for 24 mil.

Nio‚Äôs hold at $50+ range is awesome. It‚Äôs a legit company with the sky as the ceiling. I expect a bump when November delivery numbers come out. Probably mid to high 50s. Unlike the earnings hysteria, I don‚Äôt see people hyping the Nov deliveries, so there‚Äôll probably be a bump. 

Then it‚Äôll trade sideways for a month or two. Trading sideways is good. That hyperbolic growth we saw from 30-50 is not really healthy. 

The growth going forward for this company is strong. Granted, the mid term future is priced in, but if projections hold true and NIO continues to makes the projected 1500,000 deliveries for 2021, I can see $100 eoy 2021.

Anything we do actually get is going to be a watered down version of what people are hoping for. Solar and these green energy memes will peak very soon and will tank once people start to realize the reality of this.

I would generally sell calls to make it as a spread and take profits.
All these little bitch babies telling you to take your money and run, ignore them.  I think your on the right mindset with wanting to let your money grow.  My suggestion to you, move to that state with lower taxes (nevada or texas? sorry I'm canadian)  Sell enough contracts to Exercise the rest NOW! and sell covered calls.  If you plan on holding, the stock has really good IV with all the exposure.  Your smart but time is literally money and if you just sit and hold your missing out on free cash.  Write a detailed plan on what you want to do with your money and who you want to help but dont give handouts, people will come out of the woodwork asking and begging year after year.  Fuck you and Good luck brother.

even sideways wouldn't hurt. they're forecasted to sell 100,000 cars next year even without their two new sedans coming out. intel's robotaxis made by nio will be rolling out in 2022. they'll have a production capacity of 300,000 per year before the end of 2021. they're going to test out the markets in denmark and norway soon. their baas system, charging network and battery swap stations will soon be generating recurring revenue; car owners that bought their cars today renting the batteries will be paying $150 to $300 USD a month in battery rental fees even 10 years from now; as the company sells more cars they will create more and more future monthly recurring revenue from previous owners. their margins are going to continue to improve, they can announce they're building their own factory any day and the stock can go up another $10 to 20 just from that news alone, they're sitting on $3B in cash, it costs $1B to build the megafactories they use. If Xpeng or Li ever join their BaaS system it will be a proof of business model and will give the company even more value; right now no other ev companies is using specifically Nio's BaaS, but they are however using Nio's charging infrastructure and paying to use it; Nio is open to other EV companies to join their BaaS

250% on calls. It's all been sold. Still mad though, because the first call I had on it should've been like a 10 bagger, but I didn't think it could moon as hard as it did.

I paper handed puts during the initial covid crash. 

Could have x20'd my money if I just held the SPY puts I originally bought rather than  sell/rebuy puts during the whole crash a bunch of times. But I still made money and it did me well.
why 20% discount rate?
I sold 1k worth of covered calls. Therefore I have 1k to yolo. I missed buying FSR calls EOD Friday so what are some stocks that you'd get into if they dipped at opening like NIO has done multiple times (already in NIO so I'm not buying it).
Should I be throwing all my money into Roblox or SEARS???
When they gonna announce merger?
How much did you start with? If you started with like $2000 or less, then yeah I would deposit $7500 into my bank and bend over for taxes. Use the other $2500 to keep playing

Another thing that I always do is, I‚Äôll make a shit load of money‚Äîlike ill turn $250 into $15,000 in a month. I‚Äôll withdraw $10,000 into my bank and play with the other $5000...but I *always* lose for like a week straight after I hit big. Everything I touch for like 5 days turns to shit. That $5000 always turns to like >$1000. So now, when I hit big and start losing a lot of money. Ill just stop trading for like a month and come back to it.

can't trust me, or don't want to trust me because it fucks with what you really want which is to believe in PLTR.  So let's start with where the FUCK did you get $795 million in profits last quarter!?!?!?!  They had $289 million in revenue for the quarter!!!  Jesus H Christ.  Can't trust you dude.  Seriously, go check your numbers or your source. 

 

Here are the key numbers:

* **Earnings:** Loss of 94 cents per share vs loss of 24 cents a year earlier.
* **Revenue:** $289.4 million vs $279.4 million expected, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv.

For the third quarter, the company reported an operating loss of $847.8 million due to an $847 million charge for stock-based compensation.

Palantir raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.07 billion and $1.072 billion, which would represent 44% growth from a year earlier. The company previously said sales for the year would reach $1.06 billion. Adjusted operating income in 2020 is expected to be between $130 million and $136 million.

&#x200B;

Also, there's a huge difference between free cash flow or a positive operating income and ACTUALLY MAKING A PROFIT.  and this will be the FIRST YEAR they will be free cash flow positive in 15 years!
i'll eat my shit. i'll do it. but how will i show this.....or how am i gonna be held accountable?

My son loved the game,  but after watching him play some creep kept following him around asking if he liked boys. 

My son didn't know what that meant.  I made him delete the game and he cried because he didn't understand why. 

I told him there were adults on there that were saying bad things to kids,  and I didn't want him playing the game. 

Now he has a Switch, and he's forgotten all about ROBLOX.
I keep adding to psth hoping we get stripe the payout will be insane.  Even if it isn't stripe it should still go up with a merger

Most people don't or they'd only be here for a week or two and then be able to retire. Don't let anyone fool you, PLTR was almost universally trashed and laughed at when it first came out. Of course there are always a few autists who went in anyway and it paid off big.

You can try to guess based on future market trends or you carefully watch for new stocks that become big gainers or that generate a buzz and you jump in. Never wait until the entire subreddit is pumping a stock and random people on the street are talking about it. That usually means the top is very close.
Im in 15c 2/19 im expecting tendies
I understood everything, but the mistakes just made me twitch.
I get why people are so emotional over PLTR. You make +300% gains, probably the biggest success since you started trading, and you finally think you'll make it out of the hole. Then you got greedy, held too long, and watched *some* of those profits wash away.

I get diamond hands, but y'all should just sell when you're up, and move on.

Salesforce (CRM) is the perfect company to buy during a tech bubble and is riding the COVID wave.  Their e-commerce platform, which is has about 3x the market share of the closest CRM competitor, is benefiting from the shift from Brick and Mortar to online sales.  Humana is now using Salesforce to deliver telemedicine.  Salesforce has a tech focused investment fund that is making big tendies.

Imagine the typical Black Friday.  Crowds shoulder to shoulder to get the best deals.  Thanks to COVID that‚Äôs not happening this year.  Those sales are shifting online.  Salesforce (CRM) has a 21% share of Customer Relationship Management market, which among other things, is the e-commerce platform for online retailers.  Salesforce is taking a tiny % of online sales from each retailer.  You know there‚Äôs going to be a crazy amount of emails sent out this holiday season.  Guess who gets paid based on volume of emails?

Salesforce (CRM) has a technology focused investment fund.  During a tech bubble, you want to own a basket of smaller tech companies, especially if there are IPOs and acquisitions.  CRM made a bunch of money from the NCNO, ZM and now the SNOW IPOs.

I own CRM for the Q3 earnings announcement next week.  E-commerce had a big quarter.  The internal investment fund should be strong.  Headlines will be full of stories about online retail.  The stock is taking a breather after the huge post Q2 earnings run up and the WORK news.   I‚Äôve got a January $250 calls.  Investor Day is December 8th, so two upcoming events that could send the stock soaring.
It‚Äôs up to nearly $16.30. Still worth jumping in or wait for a dip? I am absolutely keen on buying, but just unsure straight away or after a dip. It‚Äôs been growing a lot the past days
TLS looks like dead money currently but I'll take a position in PSTH and GIK.

Some of those aren't up by 50% for YOU but they are up 100% so far this year.

Do you know how stock buybacks work to increase price ?
Dartboard Logic

Let's say that Citron judgment is a binary event meaning that they are either right or wrong about a company. In such a set of events there are odds that they're correct being slightly tilted in recent years (longest bull run really does suggest overvalued companies) so that works in their favor.

The problem with this is that in the case of dartboards choosing popular companies actually adds to the odds; for instance saying something that's run up 10x is "overvalued" is *likely* true. 

Then we complicate it with time. Citron can actually be correct "today" but not "tomorrow". This is a key murderous point towards all analysis; showing them right or wrong can't actually be done after the fact; that is, Cotron saying something will die eventually and then looking at it today may not make proper sense in the long run, at the time with Tesla for instance maybe it actually was overvalued, but now it isn't, because things fundamentally changed.

Bah. I'm just tired of this silliness.

great post
ur the only smart one here i think.  we're in the minority on this sub
>what‚Äôs right doesn‚Äôt always succeed, and almost never makes you money.Instead of whining about it they need to get out there and grind.

A lot of of people have that attitude in the hood and that's why they turn to selling drugs and other legal activity. Truth is we do not determine how and where we are born. You could have been born to a crack head mom with 9 kids in poverty in the streets of Chicago. You could have been born without a drop of water to drink skinny as bones in the Ethiopian desert. Maybe you would have made it out of both of the situations boot strapping it. But a hell of a lot of people wouldn't. We should do what we can to change those conditions that future humans are born in. Even if all we can do is just vote. 

>We only got one life, and we don‚Äôt owe anyone anything.

Just depends. I won't be satisfied on my deathbed simply saying hey  I made a lot of money here. But that's just me. We have different experiences that shape and make who we are. I was born in a middle class family. Started with pills, tried heroin and lived on the streets of Chicago for 6 years until I was given not just a second but a third chance. My uncle has a successful plumbing company. I worked with him and I knew the job and he took me in when I had nothing.  Was doing well for a while then then one day I stole some tools and sold them heroin. After that I got even another chance. He said if I go to rehab he would hire me back if I use my pay to pay him back for his tools. That was 7 years ago. I have my own condo, car, over 13k in the market, money in savings. Most everyone can make it if they have a chance and someone to believe in them. I want to give back in any way I can to make that happen for someone else because like you said you only live once and we all deserve it.

The idea is if you aren‚Äôt in the market at all you take zero risk and therefore have zero reward. If he‚Äôs still bullish; long term I think most of us are hoping for a Tesla type move in the coming years, then there‚Äôs nothing wrong with keeping ‚Äòsome‚Äô money in the markets. 

He‚Äôs already made a trade of a lifetime. The goal is to keep/protect those gains more than grow them.

Valeant isn't around anymore because of him:

"Left's 2015 report on Valeant Pharmaceutical (later known as Bausch Health) accused the company of channel stuffing[30] and using sham transactions to inflate drug sales. Left's initial report focused on an investigation launched by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings that examined Valeant's business model of massively spiking the prices of drugs to which it had acquired marketing rights.[31] Left followed up with a report focused on pharmaceutical distributor Philidor RX.[32] Left called for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the issue and referred to the company as the "Pharmaceutical Enron".[33][34] As a result of the report, Valeant shares dropped after a five-year peak,[35] eventually falling more than 90 percent from its peak in August 2015, and announced the resignation of longtime CEO J. Michael Pearson the following March.[36][37]"

Check out their market cap history - they were worth triple what Palantir is now. At the time they were one of the most valuable companies in the world.

Banks make a lot of their money, most of it for banks without trading arms, on the difference between the rates at which they borrow money (short term interest rate which is zero now) and the long term interest rate. Thus, we usually see long term interest rates and banks moves together but the opposite happened last week

Idk man. I flirted with GME last week and made a few hundred bucks, but I honestly don‚Äôt see GameStop surviving over the long term. The new consoles definitely help, but we knew these consoles were coming like two years ago...there aren‚Äôt ANY games out for them, and both of the new consoles are starting to shift towards digitizing games and buying them from home, which cuts GameStop completely out of the equation.

Also, GameStops aren‚Äôt getting a lot of these consoles. For Black Friday, they literally had a handful at every location...every single GameStop in the country had TWO playstations for Black Friday.

I do see short term money to be made, but as a business model, how can anyone be confident in GameStop? I know big money is dipping their toes into GameStop, but I personally don‚Äôt see it...though, I‚Äôm a retard, so who knows.

I'm in,got burn marks from $300 entry, I'm not leaving. Coming up a new IPO, and BABA adjust for the antimonopoly rules, just like other big companies do. Still there a dip. 22 buy rating 1 hold 0 sell
Is DFEN banned? Why?
You aren‚Äôt living unless you have your entire portfolio riding on highly volatile meme stonks.
PS*TH
It‚Äôs pretty much BA and RTX, BA is way overvalued right now. I made decent $$$ on DFEN in the June run up, now is not the time to buy into it.
I'm in MP and LAC. Somebody has to provide the raw materials for all this shit! Maybe Tesla will buy them both!

Honestly, if you read white papers and watch interviews of hedge fund managers, these guys have no idea what they are doing. 

We are smarter, better informed, and more nimble than the competition!

you won‚Äôt see no gay bears doing this.
It will peak so hard that everybody on WSB is going to feel it
No. Fuck you
just get shares bro. but thats long enough so ur probably gonna make money on it
HEXO calls will moon
That fear-greed index seems made up, I don‚Äôt see any risk of a pullback, maybe we trade sideways at worst but no sharp moves downward

Nivida? Tesla? How dare they. Isn't Citron a vodka anyways? They drinking way to much and yoloing way too little.

Not if you‚Äôre buying. Naked calls are only relative to the person selling the call options
KCAC to QS being an insane exception
Hell no. It's almost back up to 500 and the market basically demands incredible results from it. Even the slightest blip on the ER/guidance will probably dump it
98% cash with half a mil portofolio, small gain each day is better than no gain, slowly but surely is the name of the game.
ino tanked because they had to put the vaccine trials on hold until September....
biotech/pharma is a free 50/50 shot at calling bullshit and nkla was a legitimate FRAUD

they had nothing up on pltr besides ‚Äúuhh price too high‚Äù
Honestly probably going to go lower at least for monday. Citron hit pieces take a couple days for stocks to hit their floor. I would guess close at 25.5 monday and 23.5 tuesday. After that it's straight to the moon.
PLTR had $795 million in profits last quarter. They just ended up giving $800 million in bonuses to offset it. So I cant trust you since you don‚Äôt even know the basics
exact same thing people said about Chewy
Anybody besides me actually manage to get a ps5? If so do you have COD cold war and feel like carrying me?

You guys won‚Äôt have really made it until some fool gets a visit from the SEC
Just a heads up. In the section ‚ÄúFor Puts‚Äù right before the example on Microsoft I think you made a typo in the ‚ÄúIn the Money‚Äù explanation; instead of stock price you say strike price (the second one)üôà(9:44 am est 11/28)

Edit 1 - this might‚Äôve been the first reading I have done in years üôåüèΩthank you for the knowledge üåàüêÉ
Right on. What do you think about Bleu de Chanel for every day? I like the scent but I don‚Äôt know how long it lasts.
It's only a loss if you sell.
The thing is you need to pay attention to understanding volume for the underlying stock. The big money players will just sit all day on volume stocks algorithmic buying itm options, exercising them, and flipping them for easy profit. It is much less risky than them buying otm speculation options that may or may not be itm. They have the capital to exercise and they use it strategically. So, if there‚Äôs enough volume there will be a buyer. Pay attention to ‚ÄúOpen Interest‚Äù in particular as that is a good gauge to see if there are people willing to buy and sell.

As for what happens if you don‚Äôt have the capital on expiry depends on your broker. Look up how your broker handles itm options on expiry. But basically, you really shouldn‚Äôt hold an itm option to expiry unless you are confident the stock is making big moves and you are sure there will be a buyer because theta decay will eat away your profits a lot in the last two weeks leading up to it.

Also at some point, the delta for itm option will decrease to a point that it is no longer profitable to continue to hold even if the stock makes big moves. At that point, some will choose to sell and buy the same option at a higher strike maybe with a later expiry, called rolling an option.
Poor ernest.
no. gamestop literally has a revenue sharing deal where they get a % of ALL revenue from those digital sales. So GME isnt cut out of those sales, theyre actually guaranteed revenue from them.
Look, boomers don‚Äôt know that. They think it‚Äôs a cool game for kids. Why not fuck them and pump it?
Im glad someone posted this, im watching from the sidelines, screeching austist bagholders who keep posting buy, buy, buy.
[removed]
Compared to daddy musk and bezos, basically the same
Nice, may get in that, I like the strike and expiry
It's stocks, relax. Go to sleep. Cancel your loss stop, look back at JMIA in 2 years. Now go get tendies on PLTR you paper hand pussy.
Quantum means sort of like quantity/quantifiable (it surely comes from there), scape makes me think of a scene or setting similar to the word 'cityscape'. Putting those together, QuantumScape is imo a pretty cool name. Like it means maybe the scene/vision of things quantifiable (maths/physics?), but future looking. Idk maybe im insane

citron negging it may have capped it.  they did it to NIO.  NIO hasn't been the same since citron came out saying it's valuation could never be justified.  NIO in 5 years could justify it's valuation so it probably should just go sideways.  PLTR?  they called it a pure casino play.  and they're right.  this is so detached from reality.  PLTR highly unprofitable company and it only went public so founders could cash out.  they were tired of it and wanted to move on.  it was questionable at $17 billion valuation.  now at $51 billion.. what a fucking joke.
So is quantum trading a scam too?

Yeah it was the best performer in Nov, I believe. Historically Dec, March, and April are the best months for XLE. I gotta believe it has more room to run tho
A mutha feckin‚Äô space casino!!!
I feel like this post was made to be overwhelming
based on the %changes of short squeezes in the past, based off their short interest. look at VW and KBIO
May 20th it was $16.92 and in the months after it went to $31 and dropped all the way to $8.2, over 50% drop from the time they made their price assessment.
For any pussies from r/investing here, a safe bet for the next year or two is MSFT. 

With their new consoles, they are focusing on a subscription service with the Games Pass, and it could bring in a shitload of automatic revenue from little 7 year olds playing the next Fortnite until 2030. Imo MSFT will double or triple in price over the next two years
As long as they‚Äôre not 12/4‚Äôs you should be fine

People are saying buy a fuck ton of shares.. the suspected short squeeze would raise the stock price to a value of +$500 for a LIMITED time.. so remember to set a limit sell price above that.

An explanation of something is not enough to act on it. You're better off just getting told what to do than to receive useless conceptual information.
Funds have to buy up over 10% of the float over the next couple weeks. Calls calls and more calls
The meme energy is too much. A lot of us just want to focus on the next big thing. What do we move onto after PLTR, and put our profits into?
If you want an instant trade, place the order when the market is open (2.30 onwards) and it‚Äôll not be queued. However, the price shown tends not to reflect pre-trade prices so you‚Äôll find the price changes on the app at around 2:32/2:33 which will generally be the price you buy or sell at, give or take. Good luck! (You can cancel any queued orders without penalty)
Shares are what help the squeeze, calls are the gravy on top.
Narrator: "but, of course, he never did cash out. 'I just knew it would go back up to at least $12000 if not the entire amount if I just waited' he would tell his ex-wife's half lesbian lover years later"

January 2022 $12.50C. 

Have owned them for a month. 

Pleased. 

And will sell them at expiry or when PLTR hits $100. Not before.
Looking at other stonks besides PLTR, BABA pops out as severely undervalued, anyone in this
Yep, they aren't right about everything, but there's a lot of fucked up stuff going on.

I don't make the rules though, but I do have to play by them. You can talk your shit about resisting and "fighting the man", but you'll only make it harder on yourself. The idea of the stock market is pretty retarded and it's obviously corrupted by insiders and big money.. but whatever, if I can use it to get a piece of the action then that's what I'll do.
He invests on value and historical ratios.  Wsb invests based on memes.   He‚Äôs not wrong saying nio and pltr are inflated, but as we‚Äôve learned with Tsla it doesn‚Äôt mean the price will go in his direction.
Currently reporting all their tweets as terrorism
Stocktwits, follow who seem to have gotten things right and copy paste
And then the market crashes and the dollar losses significant value. This has happened before and will happen again. What is always available and valuable? Property. I feel like I'm beating a dead horse with value asset borrowing, I've already said it and you seem to have no grasp of the implications. You can literally leverage a property you own to put into any and every other market out there, including the stock market. It is a value acceleration more than any other means. Seriously take an economics class, and I say that with love.
Still pumping MGNI.   This stock is a direct comp to the trade desk which has 20x their valuation. $40 billion vs $2 billion. but only 4x their revenue. $732 million vs $188 million. both expected to keep having great growth. forward revenue for ttd close to $1 billion, mgni $260 million. so ttd price/revenue of 40, mgni price/revenue of only 8. TTD maybe a little overvalued, but MGNI way undervalued.  Once some analysts start pumping this thing and upping price targets or some yahoo goes on CNBC and mentions it it is going to grow like wildfire.
I‚Äôm in 5 percent for me cause I‚Äôm poor but I‚Äôm in.
My PLTR exit strategy is death.
I am by no means a video game nerd. I play my xbox for like two weeks every couple of months.

I also wake up at like 2:30-3:00 every morning for some reason.

So I figured I‚Äôd do something productive with my time awake and get my hands on a console. I deadass went to stand in line at GameStop at 3:30 yesterday morning to get a new Xbox and I didn‚Äôt even end up getting one

There were over 150 people in line, I was like the 15th person and they had TWO playstations and FOUR Xbox‚Äôs lol shit was so embarrassing. I can‚Äôt believe I did that

If you want to buy the shares then you need the money. You can sell the calls that you have and make money without exercising the options.
How did it hold 60+ for so long and now sub 20? What catalyst would drive it substantially higher again?

GME will go bankrupt before it hits 500 a share this is the most retarded post I‚Äôve read today. GME needs to reinvent itself to grow, and you‚Äôre assuming they will do that successfully. That‚Äôs a lot of faith in a company that has had like 10 years to adapt to these trends and hasn‚Äôt yet.

The next gen console sales bump is a perfect exit opportunity and is obviously unsustainable. A good number of ps5s don‚Äôt even have a disc drive cutting GME out completely from future sales. Don‚Äôt bag hold this one.

Feel bad for taking 300% on pltr calls on Friday. That definitely could‚Äôve went to 1,000% probably.I know greedy
Cook, he goes hard, just look at his app store negotiations - take it or leave it, we own the platform
I don‚Äôt know if RH Gold allows it, but a typical Level 2 RH account cannot sell naked calls. You have to have the underlying stock to sell the call. Similarly with selling puts, RH requires you to have the cash to cover it in the event it gets exercised.
I won't sit through earnings anymore. Have literally not had a SINGLE good earnings. Regardless it dips after earnings and if the earnings was good, it starts to rise shortly after the haircut.

PLTR is TAKEN Mr. Liam
> 306 $30c 02/21
Sold to buy 194 $40c 01/22

What would you search in there? I tried searching, but what you find is nowhere near accurate because $30c or 30c is too specific enough to give general results about what it means. Until other commenters pointed out that it was "a $30 call".
I thought only mericans can buy options, not Greeks duh.

Why would I buy anything from Gamestop when I could just go on Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc....this doesn't seem well thought out.
It sucks so bad. I'm making tons of money in retirement funds that I can't withdraw and spend.

And discretionary income is going into life stuff like building a house.
I'd say around that, I'm good with it staying flat for a bit honestly or it can bounce between 20$-40$ and that's great! I know it won't go to 200$ now, but honestly to people this this is going back to 10$ or less...?

Thank you! Yes, I've already got that Khan Academy course pulled up and on my To-Do list. 

I've been active in the PF community, finance podcasts comprise 90% of what I listen to, and I'm a proponent of the Buy and Hold strategy for S&P 500 stocks (almost my entire portfolio is VTI). I'm the one everyone in my circle admires when it comes to money wisdom. 

All that said, I don't know a ton, and I need to invest more. We don't make much money, we do have a healthy Emergency Fund of 6 months of core expenses, but we won't be able to purchase a house within 50 miles of where we live unless we make 4x as much as we do now, and my kiddo is only getting older. I want to at least be able to travel more and not have to worry about retirement. We can spare a few hundred bucks every month or two to try this out.

You have 1.8m in options on a crazy volatile stock. 

In the same sentence you're also literally telling us you're maxing out credit cards just to live, living on ramen, and scrounging to pay your 300$ rent.

I wouldn't wait that long if I were you. I would literally sell as soon as you qualify for the long term gains rate. This amount of money is literally life changing. I'm assuming you're in your 20s. You could literally choose not to work for the rest of your life.

Unless you're going to avoid realizing the gain for a very long time, you should realize (160k minus your income) before the end of this year. That leaves you in the 24% bracket. If you take the money in the next 2 years, that money will instead be in the 37% bracket, which will cost you more than the 9% state tax
up 400% since march.
Very interesting read, That was entirely new to me so I am going to do more research. One thing that makes me think that its unlikely that we're seeing that en masse with gamestop is the fact that it isnt an emerging company, as are most of the described companies in the article, and that cohen sniffing around and likely announcing a tender offer is enough to scare away those shorts
I was going to buy it at 11.  Got busy that day and missed out.  Risk/benefit shifts as the stock goes up.  I also am not crazy about buying a stock that just goes up 40%.  Too much risk of correcting the next day.  I will buy it if it corrects back some, otherwise I'll just move on.  I feel good about it going to 20 in the near term.  30 is a long term projection for people who want to hold 6-12 months.  I don't hold shares that long.  I would only buy $50k in shares for a quick run up and then sell for profit.  I trade mostly options and rarely hold anything more than 3 months.
This.  The greatest bull market in history and I‚Äôm down since Marchü§°.  Edit: I bought TSLA calls on Friday.  Either this will change or we hit the top bois.

I have some shares in Telos (TLS). Has some similarities to PLTR and hasn't gotten any real attention since IPO.

Also PSTH, if Ackman is able to close a big deal (I seriously doubt it it going to be Stripe at this point but as long as it is something interesting), will jump hugely. Only up ~7% since I bought a few weeks ago. 

Others I hold that are up but not by 50%+: IPOB, THC(B), FSR, LGVW, GIK. Lots of interesting stuff out there right now.

Dude, Citron has been shorting TSLA since 2016

[https://fortune.com/2016/03/01/tesla-stock-slide-citron/](https://fortune.com/2016/03/01/tesla-stock-slide-citron/)

 

Tesla Motors shares fell more than 6% on Tuesday after an influential short-selling firm sent out a tweet announcing it had taken a short position in the all-electric automaker‚Äôs stock. Investors who take short positions on a stock are betting the asset will fall in value.

Tesla shares did rebound to closed at $186.35, down about 3% from its opening price. Citron Research said in a tweet it expected the stock price to hit $100 a share by the end of the year

\-- Fortune March 1st 2016. Citron has a price target of $100 pre-split on TSLA and TSLA has gone up 2500% since then
PLTR is a legit company I agree. But its mkt cap is already worth 50 bil. What is a proper target market cap in your opinion?
I vested vertically and had RAD for an extended period of time. Unfortunately for me Lampart didn't want to come and rape RAD so I could have a total loss.
So many gun haters. I own guns and no not because of my dick size. In fact I don‚Äôt even own them for protection except for my pistol. I own them because they‚Äôre fun as fuck to shoot. I love seeing how small of a target I can hit from a long distance. It‚Äôs a sport. I tried fishing and totally suck at it. Also fishing in vastly expensive if you actually wanna catch them. Shooting is a lot cheaper. Ever watch an old milk jug explode from several hundred yards because you actually had the skill to hit it? Totally fun
Oh yeah
If you had to pitch some sort of business presentation to a CEO of a tech company which would make you most nervous? Musk, Cook, Bezos?
No you are taxed as soon as you close it. If you roll into something else and lose it all, then it offsets and you aren‚Äôt taxed on anything. Make sure you don‚Äôt do this across years because then you owe 800k for the previous year but lost it all on the next year
Fellow retards blame the Twitter algo that take cuckolds posts seriously.

Wow that‚Äôs so bullish
I know, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt fuck with it, but I hate it lol. I‚Äôm just gonna enjoy when it falls but I‚Äôve got no position in it
Correct. It sucks hard. I have exact same issue with the $25K thing. Between my account and fairly accessible savings could make it work, maybe even do $30K without causing divorce, but I‚Äôd be on pins and needles about losing any money on a trade because right back in timeout you go.
Just depends on the dealer and month. Best to negotiate at the end of the month because they're all trying to hit sales goals and will give deeper discounts.
Please do this and get some sort of proof if possible. If you can get it recorded, you would go down as a bloody WSB legend.

Long established companies don't seem to be going past pre-pandemic price, from what I've seen so far. Hopefully for your sake I'm wrong.

Yeah the people in this thread would've never gotten to the 2 million in the first place.

I actually kinda agree with OP here, even though I think he's a degenerate. He's already this close to moving from the STG to the LTG tax rate, might as well wait. If NIO drops he could lose that much money anyway, but that's the risk.
But from my limited research, this isn‚Äôt allowed or possible on Robinhood? I‚Äôm new. And I bought and sold some calls so of course I start to worry

Given your background, isn‚Äôt building a product at scale with a revolving door of short term contractors a recipe for disaster? The best engineers want the best compensation and they‚Äôre not going to find it as a freelancer on Upwork.
I think a large part of it is also because many of them buy calls that expire within a short period of time. Nothing to worry about if you believe in its potential in the long run!

Bro this is so fucking stupid. Why don‚Äôt they want me to make money???
One important point to add about the squeeze is the float is roughly 39 million shares these are the shares not locked up by funds or insiders. Not every share holder can or will sell so 70 million shorts will have to buy back the float almost twice over to get out.

Also, can do the take half out, leave half in... take out a million and be a "millionaire".  But why the fuck do you think NIO which is up 17x this year is going up more????  Why do you think a CAR COMPANY with a market cap of $74 billion who barely sells any cars is going up?  And if so, where is it going to?  Because it's a lot harder to go up from $74 billion than it is from $7 billion.  It's worth more than GM and twice Ford.  I could see it going up a little more from here, at most hitting a market cap of $90 billion, still ridiculous, but most likely going sideways.

And yeah, I can y'all love to show these baby boomer "analysts" a what-for when they short the current loved stock.
You know... if TDA wanted us to be able to really get our heads around "the greeks", they'd show you what the stock price was when you purchased that option position from which you're now trying to extricate yourself.

...but like a bunch of stuff with TDA, like not showing you how much you've spent buying and selling stocks/options, they only want to give you enough information to keep you hooked and trading frequently (like how do you turn off that god damned bell that ring periodically to make you glance at ToS because you've had enough bad experiences to know that when the cow moos, you get your milk bucket ready otherwise it's going to kick over a god damned lantern and burn down your city).
370
I mean, the point of your post was that they do a bunch of due diligence that ends up being right. Except in this case, he posted no dd. Out of the 10000 posts at least some try to justify a position. So many times people are like, oh the price is too high and a stock will run way past it's current price.

The issue is how it will scale, software and tech companies scale bigly because costs don‚Äôt ramp with sales. You get outsized returns on your somewhat fixed costs.

And yeah, Buy low Sell high definitely makes sense. But I know I'd be a fool to sell too soon, of course. So I gotta figure out how to recognize when a company is going to start climbing so I'm not buying $29 PLTR again, and then how to recognize when to sell.
The short to float is about 1:1, and there are plenty of long positions not "locked up".  Like, way plenty.  Only about 30% of the float is "locked", *if* you count Cohen's shares as locked.  I'm not even sure you can count the other 20% as truly "locked", since they are in positions that are the *most* easily lent out for shorting.  Passive funds are the easiest place to get borrows from.

In the VW case, the short to float was about 12:1, and about 97% of the float was locked.

In the KBIO case, Shkrelli locked about 76% of the float.  And there may have been other locked shares.  And the short to float was enormous.  Maybe 8:1 or 10:1.
Now lose it all with options

A naked call is when you sell a call option to collect premium from the buyer but you don‚Äôt own the underlying stock. So whoever buys the call from you is paying you for the option to buy 100 shares from you, but it‚Äôs ‚Äúnaked‚Äù because you don‚Äôt own 100 shares to sell them. If they end up exercising, you‚Äôre forced to buy 100 shares at market price and sell them to the buyer at the strike price, likely resulting in loss porn.

Yeah, sorry, just not 100% sure what to look up at the start.
I worked at Citron Research as a junior analyst for 2 years and I can tell first-hand that the practices of this company are nothing short of tactical value destruction. They seek out companies that have great potential only to run negative ads, downgrade their stock value and cause panic for shareholders‚Äîthe kicker: Citron then proceeds to purchase these stocks at a ‚Äòdiscount‚Äô for short-term holding. 

The research this company does is an actual joke. I spent 6 hours of my day looking through Reddit and other forums, recording every stock tickers mentioned and frequency. This combined with basic google searches on the targeted companies to find any exposed flank to be exploited. The research of this company is completely baseless and conducted by high-school graduates that have no or limited financial intelligence. Do not take this company or their irrelevant shouting serious.

> Shorts just collect premium over and over to wear down the bulls. Buying AND holding shares is the way. But this being WSB...yeah, that's a battle on of it's self. Greed will drive people into calls instead of shares.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMENT IN THIS THREAD.
I don't like making retard SPAC/options trades in my taxable accounts.  

Short term capital gains are murder come tax season
Just dont sell it till next week and then sell and buy calls.
The point is that short sellers at that point aren't scared so much as they're getting their accounts wiped out and have to buy whatever is available bc they're margin called.

Dude this is Reddit. It's fucking internet ! You don't know anything about anyone here buddy!
If you don't wana sell, you can lock in some gains selling call's to convert these to debit spreads (not all, but maybe 80%), that way if it tanks, you'll still keep most of the money.
If there's an *agreed acquisition* price, it's not gonna go much above that, unless there's the possibility of another higher offer, which would be exceptionally unlikely in this case.
If you‚Äôre using a stock broker app it will encrypt your info and passwords properly.

I got popped the first week of September. Didn‚Äôt trade for a month after (largely cos I had lost so much money that week though) and slowly started back. Get out of timeout next week. It‚Äôs like having to get in a boxing ring with your hands tied behind your back. You‚Äôre not gonna win, all you can do is bob and weave and be very, very smart and very conservative and try to keep from getting your ass kicked. I won‚Äôt put more than $500 into any stock under $10 in value unless it‚Äôs at the very end of day. Can‚Äôt buy a batch of options until end of day. Can‚Äôt try to buy the dip, cause what if that mug ain‚Äôt the dip and it starts drilling. No shot at a big pump and dump win. Not exactly helping you feel better but laying it out there. You can trade, but yeah, you‚Äôre absolutely fucked.

If you can‚Äôt make it work without the safety net, only option is to swap platform altogether I imagine.

Well, everyone calculates flit differently. Everyone on WSBs who has a limit order of $500 is counted as part of the float. RC prob has a ton of options he has not disclosed that are still considered part of the float.

Gme is authorized to perform a 100 million buyback. Until it formally reveals that they completed the buyback, those shares are part of the calculated flor.

Real float is probably much smaller than these MMs understand. This is why they have not already closed their float positions.

I wouldn‚Äôt compare PLTR to TSLA. More like KODK IMO.
Shut the fuck up you cringe ass retard
GME or GME.MX ? Sorry for retard question
All trades take 2 days from the sale date to settle.  Robinhood makes these funds instantly available to you through instant settlement.  This is a type of margin.

If you turn this off them you can day trade, but your trades will take 2 days to settle.  Both options suck, so I'd recommend keeping instant settlement on and limiting your day trades.  

Also people have pointed out that if you are buying and selling options, if you buy and sell at different strike prices, that technically isn't a day trade and won't count against the limit.

Toyota and Honda are the go-tos, can‚Äôt go wrong
2019 proved to them that they weren't as invincible as they thought when they took a major hit in physical sales.

Remember when Covid first hit and Gamestop tried to claim they were an essential business so they could keep their storefronts open because if they closed them they were gonna go tits up? I think that was finally the eye opener they needed to show them they quiet literally need to adapt or die.

Q2 of 2020 their online sales jumped 800% and they decided to close 600 more stores. This is when it looked like to everyone that the company was on the verge of collapse and probably when the short sales started blowing up.

They announced also that they are planning on continuing to close storefronts in 2021 because they 
But...maybe those closures weren't the signs of a company on its last legs doing whatever it could to stop the bleeding, maybe it was part of a larger strategy to restructure their business model to, as they put it, 'will allow us to more effeinciently and profitably reach our customers'.

Then you have the fact that they knew that there would be 'digital only versions of the next gen consoles and they knew that a sizeable portion of their customer base will now have hardware incompatible with the physical games they sold....and the deal with Microsoft 

It doesn't look like a company filled with misty eyes boomers longing for simpler times, to me it looks like a company that is doing whatever they need to to climb back from the brink
That is incredibly sad
Haha this is gold.
It already popped 60%...
Last week I lost tons of money buying puts, this week I will try to lose less buying more SPY puts and shorting the NASDAQ

Of course when you don‚Äôt have something to say you resort to insults.

As for the lasting conditions, it would come to no surprise that older people are more likely to experience it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean young people won‚Äôt. There‚Äôs not a lot of stats out there besides reporting of lasting conditions, but that‚Äôs to be expected because, well, when working with long term conditions, you need long term studies

https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351

As for your plan of just quarantining, how the fuck do you expect that to work? Let‚Äôs just say for a second everyone 65 and over quarantined. Now we have everyone else spreading the fucking virus for at least another 6 months. Even if the rate of death is low in younger populations, people with pre-existing conditions, or people who just are fuckin unlucky are going to die.

He sold to open, meaning he wrote the calls and sold them. If they expire ITM, he is obligated to sell his shares at the strike price of the call.

When the stock goes up, the calls he sold get more expensive. He bought it back "to close" so that he wouldn't have to sell his shares, but it was more expensive than when he sold it so he took a loss. 

You usually do this when the stock unexpectedly becomes bullish and you realize you'd make more profit by keeping the shares

I think you have other potential issues if you are worried about selling those calls right now
You‚Äôve gotta daytrade the contracts. Once you net a profit, sell the contracts and buy back in when the price drops. Amazon will see 2-4 big intraday bumps every week. Just sell at the top of those and buy back in

Yeah, I mean I‚Äôm not saying the OP is wrong or GME is not gonna squeeze again. I was a retard and bought because of FOMO, thankfully I decided to not baghold and bought NIO when it was low. But what I want to say is that the current price is not good to buy and ‚Äúwait for a squeeze‚Äù, it might do the same thing that did in October. I would definitely buy it if it went back to 11 or 12
No problem sped

"bought to close" meaning they sold calls

You won't get 0% on Toyota/Lexus/Honda/Acura's..
You either pay taxes now or later.  WTF.  you don't make decisions like that.  you make the right decision for right now.  the taxes thing is fucking with your brain.  you need to get that cognitive bias to the side and figure out the right decision.  because if NIO tanks then you'll lose a hell of a lot more than you would have paid in taxes.  not saying it will or won't tank.  I personally think NIO has hit the wall and will go sideways.  you need to figure out what you think it will actually do.  it is xmas and santa claus rally coming and plenty of dipshits thinking like you who won't sell which causes upward pressure on the market.  BUT, you're leveraged to the tits.  gtfo and diversify.  you're rich beeyautch.

If I understood the verbiage/remember correctly, the warrants can be exercised 30 days after merger, regardless the price.  Obviously if it‚Äôs under $11.50 you wouldn‚Äôt want to do that. 

The $18 mark you‚Äôre talking about is a forced redemption. So if merger completes, shares close above $18/share for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days, the company can force redemption of the warrants. So, they give you a penny a piece and you buy your shares for $11.50 while they trade at above $18.  If you do not have funds to buy the shares, they will settle on a ‚Äúcashless basis‚Äù.  If I understand correctly, that means they‚Äôll basically take your warrants and give you the cash you would‚Äôve been left with by buying your shares at $11.50 then selling them at the current share price.

Edit:  they don‚Äôt give you cash for the ‚Äúcashless‚Äù settlement, they give you the amount of shares equivalent to the sum described above.

Oof yea you‚Äôd be much better off have one singular position 12/11 closer to the current price.
Yeah, just because we did not see +20% one day it means that stock is dead. After citrons tweet in the end of the day it still did not drop. Are you completly retarded or stupid?
End of May, I think it was at 4.5

Quit being a gay bear. Pltr will continue to moon.
Literally my entire portfolio. 60% PLTR and 30% GME.

Represent son!
You know I really love the idea of squeezing the shorts out of GME with the homies
Are you talking about early October? You bought after a squeeze and lost when it sold off.  I‚Äôm leery of the infinite squeeze everyone‚Äôs hoping for but it‚Äôs worth a small chunk just in case. If you had bought in a few days or a week before you did, you‚Äôd have a different perspective.  Don‚Äôt let one mistake keep you from another one and don‚Äôt listen to mofos on the internet either.

Stop talking dirty to me.
Unless AMZN opens up 1% or more green. Which is possible. I plan on holding them until Tuesday regardless. I think we will see a $100 bump in price overnight sometime this week

Cool just checking! I believe PLTR is a legit company. For sure the run was nice but yeah a pullback is healthy! But its not like it‚Äôs going to crash either! I‚Äôve seen way bigger runs on other stocks! So yeah some are salty they missed nice gains I get that !

I think with the charge point deal, the warrants are trading with the assumption (or fear) that the stock isn‚Äôt going to maintain its current price by the time they are exercisable.  Kind of like VIX options.
No counter argument, but if I was a fund manager I would have slowly loaded up on shares in a separate account once the announcement came out.

Then the index fund I operate would absorb the account with the Tesla shares.
Not a bear by any means, just making sure that the newer traders aren't  misinformed by one graphic on another post - I'm providing the flip side.

I have zero positions in PLTR (short or long), nor have I ever had any.

"I don't like what you're saying so I'll insult you" is a valid counterargument tho I guess.
+1
I want to say AMZN options weren't quite as expensive until anticipation for earnings fired up. Premiums were baking in pretty heavy swings even if the strike wasn't that far off.

They've stayed high, probably because holiday season is gangbusters for them. I bet we see a cool-off in the spring, especially as vaccines are distributed and a general pullback from tech occurs.
Boomer backing, U lost me there
For what?

Look at Nio and what happened to it lol
Enron was rated investment grade until they filed for bankruptcy. Enron was a real compny too.
You barely made it, just UNDER 100% so far this year. By today's standards, it's still a prospect.
Bcos their companies will be growing much faster than us in the coming years. Ours is a developed country, indexes and most cos excl. TECH move slowly like 7% in a normal year. Wouldn't you want to be able to participate in much faster growth

Honestly don‚Äôt blame him too much. If he sold everything now he‚Äôd be left w just under a million after taxes which would be due that year. If he waits a couple months he‚Äôll save hundreds of thousands on taxes and put off the bill another year. He‚Äôll save that ‚Äúlambo in cash‚Äù in taxes alone. However I would certainly sell some contracts to pay my fucking rent and credit card bills. But if you‚Äôre that close to having held the investment for a year, why eat another 15% in taxes. Even if the value of his contracts drops 10% in that time he still comes out on top

You can hardly call what the majority of people here do ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù and if you do lose all your money you‚Äôre gambling because part of investing is hedging your bets so you don‚Äôt wipe yourself out on one bad play. Some people get lucky and going all in pays off but most of the time you‚Äôre going to end up hurt.
I‚Äôm not all in still got loads of cash, lots of people I know like me, Citron can suk it! PLTR is a legit company dude

Thanks. Looks like he‚Äôs right about once or twice a year despite tweeting one or two stocks a month
Difference is citron has a following and is "respected" among traders. Dudes just trying to short reddit memes and when he cant do it he'll call Cramer and the boomer army. His 3 tweets against Blink were fucking hilarious.  You could tell he was getting madder and madder when the stock wouldnt drop
Don't be so sure
lol went to a top 10 university with 3 engineering degrees.
Citron's post is basicly:   HEY YO -  RETARDS, MATH!

They didn't say this is a shitty company, a fraud etc...  they are saying

hey stocks pull back.

I think PLTR will be insulated from a lot of the bad press it has had the last ten years

because of it's efforts at: vaccine tracing, integrating sewer analysis of virus clusters in communities, synchronizing local state and federal response with military distribution

and management of vaccine efforts, tracking all the "radicals" on both sides of the aisle

as the honeypot tech platforms propel people out in the streets.  This is the time for 

pltr, for better or worse.   I have to believe, despite the dystopian bent of this company and our times, that people involved have good intentions no matter how obsessed they are with

their own personal privacy and power (theil).  I believe it is easily a $50 to $100 stock at current valuations in the market.  Should be noted valuations in the market could drop across the board quite severely, bears are right sometimes.  I think pltr will rise above those ashes quicker than many companies after the fact.

oof
Just grow balls and get PLTR
She looks like the child of a horse and a donkey
Don‚Äôt know why everyone keeps bashing gravity. Shit fucking works.
So he‚Äôs about right once maybe twice a year?
Listen one shitty way to win an argument is to start by insulting the other person. You wanna challenge my argument, fine. But don‚Äôt call me an old people murderer. This largely affects the old and weak and vulnerable. When those people are placed into a hospital for care, they are isolated or quarantined for their own protection. They make up a smaller percentage of the population so it‚Äôs just stupid to shut down our economies and kill people‚Äôs livelihoods rather than protect those most vulnerable.

In terms of lasting health risks to younger healthy people show me the actual proof and statistics. I know plenty of people old and young who have had covid and experienced no symptoms or a mild flu. And they feel completely fine now.

So spare me your bullshit virtuous signaling please. I‚Äôll stick with science and evidence based logic and reasoning and compromise.

So why does Elon hate them so much and why is wsb and the market shitting their pants about pltr?
Can it be Monday already...
then my 17,000 shares would have been worth less in March... unless I was able to predict the future and sold in January and decide to buy shares in March.
Sorry, i didnt mean to upset your majesty in any ways sir.
Oh dude I was being sarcastic haha. I‚Äôm not defending their short either. I‚Äôm sure PLTR is a good long hold based on their activity  

But I hope they crater and drain the proverbial swamp WSB is currently in.
You had me at Bears are gay
If you own something that a short seller comes out against,  just be happy it's not Muddy Waters.  Carson Block doesn't f around.   They are literally the opposite of Citron, they will do years of research and present exactly why they are shorting heavily with tons of research to back it up.  Citron will drop a tweet calling a company a "casino".      Big difference in these short sellers.

I know they are expensive, but why aren‚Äôt AMZN calls mentioned here more? They move thousands of dollars a day. A 1% bump in AMZN stock price can turn a $2000 contract into $4500 easily in a day. It‚Äôs like the ultimate balls move to go all in on AMZN weeklies

Or at least solved it for the wsb community!

Actually it's only on money earned over $1 million. The first million you earn isn't taxed as highly.

I know!!! Growth is important and it‚Äôs probably the new thing, but what I was trying to say is that yolo calls, like 80% of people are doing here, are highly dangerous compared to value investing ...

Use the ‚Äúfind on page‚Äù search function and search for keywords like ‚Äúwarrant‚Äù. 


This has the answer to anything you could ever ask. The ‚Äústrike‚Äù is a set number at $11.50, so it‚Äôs not like you get to pick like an option.  

How long I hold is 100% dependent on what happens with the price action.  If I can make 400-500% in a month I‚Äôll probably sell.  50% gain, I‚Äôll hold until at least after merger completes.  The warrants were up about 50% in yesterday‚Äôs trading I believe.

How do you think funds are going to balance their portfolio to match S&P? I have a wild idea, by buying what the index holds. And index will hold TSLA after 12/21 so do the math.

Edit: It's up just UNDER 50% for the week, before I got to it, smfh.

The $TSLA run began a couple weeks ago w/ the announcement. You‚Äôre missing out on the entire run if you wait until Dec 18th. In fact after Dec 18th you‚Äôll most likely be buying the shares and calls that I am selling at hugely inflated prices so I‚Äôll just thank you now.
Ah yes ive been looking for you.

Just use in-flight wifi you normie
If the SPAC is successful after merger, then the expiry (of sorts) is much closer than 5 years. After the warrants become exercisable, usually bound to some rules like stock price must be > $18 for 20 days out of 30, you have 30 days to actually exercise them. Then the remaining warrants are redeemed for $0.01.

Worth noting that this is not trading like an American option at all. Look up Chargepoints SPAC. Stock trades at 37, warrants at 13 or so. 37-11.5=25.5 though. Warrants can also go to 0 if the merger falls though and doesnt happen for some reason.

If you're buying warrants you should always glance over the S1. Search ticker name + S1. Then search for "redemption" in the 100+ page document.

Yup. The funny thing is even if it continues to drop, you could probably play the opening bell with it all week and still see good returns. My guess is there‚Äôs going to be a lot of averaging down. 

You should be nervous if a tweet from short seller takes you down 19% from your high to close. That‚Äôs absolute lunacy.

First of all thank you for this in-depth guide of option trade. I‚Äôm new to this and still trying to comprehend everything here, but I‚Äôm still confused asf like most of us here.

Here‚Äôs my question. If I buy a call, let‚Äôs use your example $MSFT 230c 12/4 and it hits the strike price before or on the date that it expires. What do I do? Do I sell once it hits the strike price to make profit? And what happens if I don‚Äôt sell it and the expiration passes?
Simple:

TSLA Strike Price $650 for Dec 18th, if it hits $700 by Dec 18th, you're looking at 83% Gain

NIO Strike Price $80 for Dec 18th, if it hits $90 by Dec 18th, you're looking at 1036% Gain

I'd pick 1036% over 83% all day. Also, NIO is trading 3x the Volume of TSLA. When **volume** increases, you **will** have the **potential for** a multi-bagger, which is every investor's dream scenario
Hey guys. I know many of you forgot about NIO. But hope yall ready for this shit to blast the fuk off.

This one's hard.
who said I can't pay rent? lol. I take out money from stocks when I need more cash usually, I'm out of cash lately because I bought more Feb calls and don't want to cash out on those until Feb.
No. It ppl will want to load up more for quick buck and the funds will buy more. So more demand.
My calls are dated out tk feb for 15 I think bht are you adding on any dips? I think I‚Äôm going to I don‚Äôt see how this won‚Äôt be 20 in the weeks leading up to merger.
Not defending their short position whatsoever.
Just pointing out that they're right with a lot of their short positions, since a lot of WSB is 2020 joiners (didn't sub grow from 1m to 1.6m this year?)

Someone made a post that showed 6 times they were wrong, and that's probably all the research the new guys will do.

Who is buying PLTR next week? All the retards already went all in. We‚Äôre due for a correction due to a lack of institutional buyers
I think what's madding about this is this was just a hit job. No report or anything. The NIO report was a crock of shit too. No hard evidence. Im sure the guy is right on occasion but this isnt some well researched report. Guys just looking for ways to pay his 50k in alimony/child support this month
So basically shorting is bearish position, where you borrow shares from a lender, sell them, and since you expect the stock to go down you‚Äôll buy the stock back at a lower price and the difference in prices is your profit. So theoretically, since more than all of GameStop‚Äôs shares are shorted, that means they‚Äôll need to be bought back at some point which will make the price of GameStop shares moon.

I don't see why short sellers are actually a bad thing for stockholders? It's kinda like short term pain for long term gain. Their initial sell obviously reduces some liquidity but they then essentially are then obligated to buy more shares in the future. 



So if the price goes down, the shorts lock in their gains and buy stock. If the price goes up, they get squeezed and buy stock... both are positive headwinds.
it includes all of their funds. Where did you get this picture?
Why would we see a run before it's added to the S&P?

If it is a cash account then yes.  As soon as you hit sell it is either a gain or loss.   Held less than a year held then short term tax rates.  If it is in RH they only have cash accounts.

The REAL QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING:

When will the Fed be buying PLTR calls?
keep trying new things. eventually one of them will turn your gears
They are NOT looking to move away from brick and mortar. Their investors want them to. But the exec leadership considers that their competitive advantage and refuses to move away from it.
Ahhhh so you‚Äôre half the notifications on cheddarflow
Question on bid, ask , and mark.  When you want to buy something how can you ensure it gets filled?  Would a market order automatically just go straight to the ask price?  Is is prudent to just put the limit order in at the mark?  What purpose does the bid price serve?  You hoping the sellers get desperate and lower their ask?   If you want to swoop in and grab some calls, can you afford to set a limit between bid and mark?  Help us with the strategy here.

As an autistic retard, I am a little suspicious of Citron's timing. News of institutional money flowing into PLTR prior to Thanksgiving indicates the big boys know what's up, then Citron tweets about shorting PLTR on a low volume holiday? It's fucking obvious these lying pricks wanted a lower entry point to go long. In an era of infinite money printing, the only fucking way this retraces to $20 is if we have economic collapse. PLTR to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

looks like shit
this aint DD this is shilling

I am absolutely not a business law attorney but I think

1) We need to collectively raise money and pick a state of incorporation (the total cost is...low) which more or less requires a board of directors and other generic 'corporate' stuff. We then more or less are set up and everyone 'works' for free.
2) We get a website that looks professional and lets our analysts post with some kind of voting/comment system built in. This cooks for a few days as people post and it is shown to be 'serious'. It also should allow for videos so people can do powerpoints/ interview like things *because of covid no one being in the same room is completely expected*
3) We do a bit of marketing (aka alerting Cramer) that 'this is a thing now' he will inevitably comment that we have come to some level of order (we could even make a point to thank him for mentioning us/giving us the idea)

then we see how things are playing out after christmas to come up with an initial long term plan

Does this mean stuff is in motion?
There is almost NO margin in consoles for GME. There never has been for any of the console HW cycles. Their cash cow has always been their Buy Sell Trade model around preowned games. Digital downloads and digital edition consoles get in the way of that significantly. So new consoles have previously fueled a frenzy of buy sell trade, however that is going to be a lot harder now with digital downloads + CV.

Short interest is shares short divided by available float so actual short interest % is way higher
TLDR-Top is in
Because most people don‚Äôt do their homework. Here are a few of the most common types of traders:
1) technical: looking at charts and trends.
2) fundamental: looking at company performance and macro economic trends.
3) bandwagon: looking for a good story.
4) value: looking for cheap stock.
5) growth: looking for steep return curves.
6) cream pie eaters: this is me. We like to have our cake and eat it too meaning we like to tick off all the above boxes 1 through 5 before jumping in.

PLTR is doing so well because it ticks all the boxes!

Cake eater stocks are amazing with high growth potential but two fundamental problems: 
1) work - inorder to have your cake and eat it too you need to bake two cakes. It‚Äôs twice the work to find and research these stocks.
2) high volatility - the attractive thing about these sticks is there are many reasons for different types of people to get in. Conversely there are many reasons for them to get out.

So what happened here? Well citron scared off many value (4) and bandwagon (5) investors.  Bandwagon people are easy to scare but they often jump back on at high prices but some of the value guys will be out for good.

But not all of the value guys will leave. All the value guys love to talk about Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett preachers value he also buys a lot of companies (e.g. aapl most recently) at all time highs because he‚Äôs looking at long-term value.

Now the good news: A lot of people with BIG $ just don‚Äôt know about this company yet and while Citroen research has a relatively low number of followers compared to Wall Street that has a much higher percentage of large institutional followers.

These guys do their own research. The fact that citron has reported on it means they have to do their due diligence on the stock. Once they do this due diligence they are going to come to the same conclusion‚Äôs as many of us have and buy.

It‚Äôs these large institutional by-ins that are responsible for the biggest tendies.

Serious discussion - well, why is Alibaba at risk of being delisted? They also use PWC as their auditor (HK branch) but they don't allow the PCAOB to review these audits to be compliant. Along with most all other Chinese companies listed in the US, they are all at risk of being delisted no matter if they are using big 4 or not. This includes NIO too.

Look it up yourself -- https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international/denied-access-to-inspections?pg=4&auditorlocations=China

In general, it is China's directive to not comply, citing concerns of risk to revealing 'state secrets'. However, there are some workarounds that I do hope NIO can do, such as using a "neutral third party" to review the audit material that both the PCAOB and China agree to.

If not, hey.. we still have 3 years' time for them to find a solution before they are delisted for not complying...

I think PLTR is a solid company with huge growth in next 4 years.  I believe the stock will hold up after the holding period ends on shares.

The danger to the stock is not Citron research but bad press surrounding it's services.  Alex Karp, the ceo you tards, said as much in the investor presentation.  He says it over and over again.   One example is a piece that came out in 2018 bloomberg, "Palantir knows everything about you".

For a more recent critique check out any of Whitney Webb's reporting at unlimited hangout, the last american vagabond. or on youtube at slowdaynews where she is occasionally interviewed.
What other automaker has a beta of level 3 / 4 autonomy with the  EV cars that have 400-500+ miles of range and the largest network of charging infrastructure in the US, while having automobiles that cost less than their competitive counterparts?  Did I mention they‚Äôre also becoming the largest institutional and residential solar supplier?

Is it Ford?
This entire sub is trading on emotion regarding PLTR.

They're short sellers. They play the odds. Losing a bunch isn't a sign that they suck. The point is to bet when others are assuming incorrect odds (or in this case incorrect valuations). If the actual chance of winning is 2% but the payout is representing a 1% chance (AKA a payout of 100x instead of 50x) then you should ALWAYS bet. It's the game theory optimal strategy. It doesn't matter if you lose most of the time since when you win you more than makeup for it. 







/r/wallstreetbets never ceases to amaze. You can't tell the success of a firm strictly based on the number of successful investments. The magnitude of success is obviously more important. This is basic probability and game theory. Everyone here should be smart enough to understand and if you don't then you're too dumb to invest and you're even too dumb to gamble in the traditional wsb fashion. I could explain this concept to elementary schoolers and they'd be able to grasp it.

Happy to help! Cohen exaggerated, they are doing really well with e-commerce. Huge growth the last two quarters and q4 reporting March will be massive. Uberkikz11 on stocktwits has a model for estimating q4 volume in the US (based on order numbers since they are sequential per country). Its looking like around 800 million to a billion in online sales. I believe total sales in the last ER was 983 million, online and brick and mortar...and including other countries sales as well.

They could be moving faster, but it isn't slow!

Very. Very Very well   

All in all went up about 10k in the past week and I‚Äôve finally pulled out of pltr so I‚Äôm happy with my gains and now I‚Äôm addicted

Yup hoping it goes up next week so less money lost at least. GL to al crsr holders!

They let everything go through nowadays.
PLTR only has 20% of its shares available rn. The other 80% is locked for another month or two and not available for purchase.

Everyone and their moms are buying calls, which pushes funds to buy shares to balance their sheets. This drives the price to the moon.
Yes! Its totally authentic as an experience

Good news: PLTR is probably going back up

Bad news: your $5000 all-in play will be insoluble for a month until you break even
Not to mention games are moving to a downloadable format. You don't have to visit the store when you can get COD on the Microsoft store.

That said don't underestimate concentrated autism. There is enough money in this sub to SERIOUSLY influence a stock.

If you want to counter, buy a few long dated puts far out the money. I'm trying it with this stock GME $4 Strike exp 2022 they sell for 90 bucks and that's a level of risk I can take for a solid return. Just don't yolo into them.

No. That would mean I might have to buy to cover.

I'm an autist that has been in the market for barely 6 months and playing with options for less than three weeks (up 250% so far), and still i'm good enought to know not to:

\-buy calls expiring the same day

\-buy weeklies

\-buy more than 15/20% OTM

\-YOLO everything on a single date/strike

Chasing easy money is good, it's what we are here for, but there is easy money and there is complete utter insanity. Take your 50-100% and avoid the temptation of those 500-1000%, you might get lucky once and lose everything the next time.

The only time i would play a weekly is if i'm considering buying 10k of options and wanted to spice thing up with 500$ in a stupid play, knowing the rest will still net me enough to make up for the loss of those 500$.

Be autistic, not retarded guys!

Your question presupposes that there is a signal here as opposed to all noise.
This is the way.
>If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or drop in price, you sell calls.  
>  
>If you believe a stock is going to trade sideways or raise in price, you sell puts.

&#x200B;

This is not accurate.   When you sell calls , you expect the price to still go up , but slowly over time.  And when you sell puts, you expect the price to drop although not as fast drop .

&#x200B;

Call sellers are bullish, although not as bullish as the call buyer

Put sellers are bearish, although not as bearish as the put buyer.

No. I‚Äôm working on scraping and analyzing the YouTube data now. My theory is that there are probably some super stock spreaders. However, the original ideas probably come from users on reddit / twitter which lay the ground work.
I agree dude, the IV levels are insane right now. That being said - IV could go even higher. If you're super poor and don't have margin to buy stock, calls are probably the only choice you have ü§î

For anyone interested in where GME can go and if they don‚Äôt think a short squeeze is possible go look back at 2013-14‚Äô 

it‚Äôs almost likely that when some of those boomers take their charts out to 10 years and dust off their crusty nuts they‚Äôll realize the opportunity of it heading back to the $50 range.

For those not watching CNBC they had basically set up a ongoing commercial on Black Friday and Cyber Monday is going to likely have some crazy GME deals too.

Literally. Just bought a house with a 2.75% interest rate, 0 down 7/1 arm. Could rent it out for more than my mortgage right now. Will sell and move on in the next 7 years so I‚Äôm not worried about the adjustment. Pretty much free money. The property will appreciate way more than 2.75% per year so it‚Äôs free money, in addition to having all that cash in diversified, safe investments instead of tied up in the house.
Well duh
[deleted]
Okay I‚Äôm not an expert but if you look at the Volkswagen 2008 short squeeze, it happens really fast. Probably much faster than you can sell the call options since options are a much smaller market compared to stocks. Hence OPs suggestion of limit sell with stocks, so it can be executed when OP believes to be the height of the short squeeze.
Is this Andrew L.?
This is the right advice. It's much easier and better on the emotions to think "Damn had I held longer all in I would have more money" rather than "fuck I have nothing wish I would have gotten out" This dude is straight greedy and not in a positive way. He is having trouble paying bills and has almost 2 million in the stock market. I'd pull out of NIO by 75% and keep 25% if I was confident it could go high. Then I'd be at r/investing for advice.

Thank You!!!!!!!
Wrong. Micro planing gets more aroma and flavor out of the truffle. A slice isn‚Äôt as good but people think it looks better.
Read it faster. Read a book every week. Make notes on the margins. Underline. When you‚Äôre done with the book, write a a short summary on Google docs. Review that summary whenever you‚Äôre waiting for an elevator, etc. Discuss the book‚Äôs ideas with anyone who‚Äôs interested. Find a subreddit. Implement those ideas in your daily life if possible. Gift the book to a friend/colleague and discuss with them. Try to link what you read in that book to other things you‚Äôve read. Then buy another book that‚Äôll help you build on this book and repeat the process. That‚Äôs 100% effort in the context of reading a book.

Bro you are 18 I‚Äôm 24 just slow down. No need to yolo your paychecks. Slow and steady this is no boomer shit this will reduce the likelihood of you going broke and become depressed.

You have 500 focus that shit is fine but don‚Äôt do options you lose it too fast 1 bad trade and you are out. 

Build a portfolio. Focus on one company you see potential go balls deep. Hope they grow -> reinvest -> reinvest profits over and over 

Eventually you will have a portfolio and make thousands a day just by a small percentage move.

You started investing in 2008 and eating ramen and borrowing money from your brother in 2020. Instead of cashing out 90% and making enough off of low risk investments to not work for the rest of your life you decided to max out creditcards.

You do you and good luck gambling. But your twelve year struggle tells me you can‚Äôt justify your actions.

I have a question. I am a retard who bough PLTR calls with 0 option trading experience. I bought 3 calls. 1 12/4 30c and 2 12/4 33c. If the stock price rises above the breakeven point do I have to exercise the call to make money? Aka do I need like 10k to actually buy the shares.

The market reacts like crazy to anything- even craziness.  His opinion is obviously often wrong on meme stocks. They are a phenomenon that took me a couple of years to start to understand, I‚Äôm guessing he totally doesn‚Äôt based on his history with them.  (I wouldn‚Äôt say I fully understand then either).  


You can have politicians, who are never right about what they tweet, send the market up or down like crazy on a tweet.  It doesn‚Äôt mean they are credible.  Maybe it‚Äôs down 10% the next two days, but then something else will happen and it will run 15% a day for the next week.  


The market reacts to everything, but whether it reacts stronger and longer (insert joke about wife‚Äôs boyfriend) to good or bad news simply depends on the sentiment around it.  If the general market sees a stock favorably, then it will react longer and higher to ‚Äúgood news‚Äù than it will to bad news.  Good news can be a green day, or just no bad news when the market is in a good mood about a stock. 


Ans i don‚Äôt think this left dude has really changed the market sentiment about the stock

You find a way so that the latter gives you the former. Otherwise those are just two completely unrelated things, even opposite eachother.

PLTR is a great company to short. It's not like NIO where the soaring stock price can be backed up by fabulous earnings reports showing staggering growth and a market of hundreds of millions of consumers that has suddenly been mostly required to buy products like yours over the next 15 years. Citron can attack NIO all it wants and only scare out the cucks who didn't know what they were buying.

PLTR is different. It's been around for 17 years and is soaring on meme hype. It's made for shorting. Also, if you're investing in PLTR, you're gambling on the meme pumping working. You may as well stay in and hope that carries you.

Most people sell their calls here.  You have to consider to buy 100 shares at 31 its $3,100 plus whatever their contract price was.  Sure plenty of people have money and exercise their contracts (aka buy the shares) but the people with big accounts are not the majority.  Also if you are yoloing usually you are buying a few contracts so maybe you sell some and exercise some.
Wow don‚Äôt be ridiculous. You overvalued this by at least $7...maybe $8 and some loose change.

Great posts Panda, I think sometimes people are getting confused between ‚Äòselling‚Äô an option vs. ‚Äòwriting‚Äô an option. If I buy a call, and then sell it, my only obligation is to explain to my wife why IV crushed me. If I write an option, my obligation stays with me, but I collected the premium. I doubt most of us learning from your wisdom here are going to start writing calls, so no worries. Thank you for your time.
I don't gamble. I invest.
Short interest compared to available shares seems pretty low (especially compared to the likes of VW) but on the other hand WSB could maybe initiate the squeeze. 

Im wondering whether stupidly high calls wouldn‚Äôt be better as they‚Äôd force MM to buy the shares to hedge and multiply buying power. For an infinity squeeze to happen the shares available to short sellers to cover must go down and I don‚Äôt think WSB can do that without leverage on 1B market cap

What? It‚Äôs making a minor correction, and also responding to shitron report. It did not ‚Äútank‚Äù.
noone believes in their business model (CURRENTLY)

ryan cohen might step in soon and change a lot (which should yield good returns already)

on top of that the possibility for a short squeeze is super high due to the circumstance i.e. GME is being shorted so hard

You bought and sold NIO and PLTR, you made money, great.

No need to shitpost cuz you got off the rocket too soon and now feeling hurt with price going up.

Bit naive to believe that 1) markets are rational 2) WSB is the reason NIO and PLTR headed for moon.

I can‚Äôt watch the market all day long. It‚Äôs not my job. I set a stop loss so that I sustain losses I‚Äôm comfortable with as opposed to riding the roller coaster all they way to the bottom.
3+ months before inactivity fee and its like 12 ‚Ç¨ (i think) and they have 4000+ cfds if not more. And they are a secure broker with 20 years. Go to their site and youll find more info that you need.

Oh you trip‚Äôn.  WSB is all there is now. Do or do not there is no try.   Or just space jam?
That‚Äôs actually pretty lit that you got all of those in leap calls. That‚Äôs what I want to do.

What is the benefit to using leap calls over just buying shares out right though? The ability to buy more shares for cheaper later?

Taxes really aren‚Äôt gonna make that big of a difference to you once you‚Äôve made this kind of money

Lmao it‚Äôs still terrible investing advice. Let‚Äôs say you bought a 500k property outright in cash in 2018, the average house increased in value by 3% in 2019 - leaving you with 515k (house value)... whereas if you put down 50k (10%) on the property and invested the rest of the money (450k) in the stock market (31.5% return), you‚Äôd have 592k in investments... while still owning the 515k property (75k in equity)... get it yet?

Because in a short squeeze, funds that owe large swaths of shares use market order for their outstanding position. They buy whatever they have to to get out of the position. You want to sell there and not during the fall as the purchasing price will fall just as fast on the way down. See Kodak earlier thus summer.
So did a lot of people... if it was this easy to find big tech stocks than everybody would be a billionaire... looking at what he has accomplished shows what you can achieve through value investing. Calls are fun and everything but they are not safe at all and people fucking murder themselves because they lose money off it.. value investing over a long period of time brings you money 10000%, calls don‚Äòt

Get just a little consolidation, then confirmation to the upside this thing will catapult based on Shitron‚Äôs terrible market analysis.
Thanks for all the replies!
You may have had a good experience hiring... but it‚Äôs a shit experience for freelancers. 

Remote work becoming the norm is bad for upwork. Their niche just got gaped by the norm. With remote contracts becoming the average, why would quality a freelancer want to give up 20% of their take to upwork. I‚Äôve done a couple jobs on upwork. My first priority is to take the job off upwork. If I give the client 10% discount by agreeing to that, I get a 10% raise as well.

Next time you put a job on upwork, try it. Offer to take the job off upwork and you and the freelancer will both have extra $$

It was also the only one he said would go up.
ye, i see that. Just i dont see the need to even question if PLTR goes up or not.

I think the trend of the traditional workplace transforming will continue.  COVID made this faster. 

Some professionals would prefer to be their own boss with flexible hours.  This is a play on the "professional gig economy".  

Employers have figured out it's ok to have people do work remotely, why would we carry payroll on employees when we can hire contractors just for the work we need?  

I have no idea what the future will bring, but that's my thought.

Good point. I have both calls.
Yes, absolutely. It is the single biggest expense item in a person's life and life is unpredictable. If that is an issue one never has to worry about again then that prepares that individual to be able to take on a lot more of what life can throw at him/her. It is also a tremendous way to ramp up asset value and leverage to buy/borrow against for even greater money making opportunities. Look at human kind in it's entire history, even present day. Whoever controls/owns the land will always be the one who has the most stable wealth generation and power. Businesses rise and fall, stock tanks and moons, all unpredictable. Land control will always be constant and consistently the power bringer and wealth maker.

I'll hold PLTR as long as it keeps mooning. I think the GME squeeze will start without WSB and I really cannot tell you when, but when WSB joins, it will be the most epic thing in the history of the market
In the Long run value investing brings so much more money than gambling yolo calls on fucking Meme stocks... has nothing to do with timing ... if you invested in value during the crash in March you could be richer than gambling with calls all day

Nah, there still a whole bunch of paper pussy hands in WSB that folded for Citron. We would've crushed Citron if all WSB members didn't fold.
I mean, if there **is** a short squeeze then even a small number of shares will yield a decent bit of profit. Even a couple hundred could turn to a couple thousand, a couple thousand into tens of thousands. I think buying shares and waiting this one out is the way. A lot of people are gonna miss out because their calls expired or some shit. I'm just holding shares like a lot of people. Not selling till I know for sure that majority of shorts have likely covered.

This sub needs a war, a nemesis, Cramer can only take it so far, it needs to feed on fresh retardation.

Absolut Citron it is.
This is the way.

You need to learn about business and how they work on the macro and micro levels. 

Learn how to read financial reports.

Find a good source for business news, especially the specific sectors you're in. 

I happen to work for big three auto so learning about EV companies isn't a huge stretch for me. When they talk about productions numbers it actually means something to me. I know how much a plant of x size should be able to produce. I have in the know information about typical margins you can make on a vehicle. I know about vehicle design and manufacturing. Etc etc. All of that info really bridges my understanding of this particular sector.
Nah, but OP will definitely be cumming in the baguette

I agree with the part that Unreal is better in some respects, but Unity also has some advantages like less complexity and the ability to do faster development.

Latest results showed a 45% growth in profits compared to the same quarter last year.  It is a very strong company and it is investing in some aspects such as cinema and automotive sector. The fact that there is another competitor in the market does not mean that Unity will not grow. Also, there are many indie developers using it for small creations (there are also big games like Rust made with Unity)

The reason that I compare Adobe with Unity is because both are software subscription based companies and both has a similiar potential, each one in its respective area
1 trillion don bucks per share EOY
Oh no, don't misunderstand me, if you are long PLTR then you are going to be fine, I know about the yoy growth potential. I'm speaking on behalf of the newer investors on this sub who are buying short dated contracts and screaming it will hit 100+ by eoy.

Nah it's the squeeze play. Look uo  short squeeze on google. They dont come around often and can give a stupid short term boost. Look up VW short squeeze for an example.

Basically, the shorts on GME are gonna have to leverage their loss very soon which will cause a huge short term disruption to inflated stock prices. There will be a day or 2 where the prices bounces. Some are predicting the shorts demand for shares to cover their loss will drive the stock to $500 for like a day or two.
Holy shit
So you think when mortgage rates are below 3% you should buy in cash? Rather than putting as little money down as possible, investing the money you saved (by not buying outright in cash), and then refinancing to knock off PMI?

Nah, just let every moron here post about their $20 gain or the only two stocks they know 10 times a minute
See this is how I know you're not a big thinker.

You give collateral to cover that cost.

It should have purchased 300 shares at $25/ea and resold them for $24/ea using the collateral. Max loss should be width of spread-premium received.

The problem is it says voided for some reason. More than likely I'm assuming it will work out and its robinhoods shitty client bugging

It's coming. I don't know what, but something is about to happen.

What date you got on the squeeze?
Value investors are fucking stupid
Ok, I have read OP. I have a strategy question:

Specific to PLTR (but can be applied to any option). When buying short term options such as ones ending less than a week away. Does it make any sense, if you‚Äôre super bullish and holding calls to pick up a cheap put in the event that the stock drops (ie on Black Friday)?

Example: PLTR $36c 12/4 but also buy $15p 12/4 in case the stock tanks? Like, there isn‚Äôt a whole lot tied up in a $0.01 put but if it goes down then it‚Äôll probably rocket.

Somebody come explain how incredibly dumb this is.

So you bought the 25 and sold the 24, call credit spread is bearish isn't it? You wanted it to be below both strikes and it's above both. Seems like the person holding the 24 exercised cause why wouldn't you, so you lack 300 shares and broker exercised your purchased call, you didn't have enough cash to cover 300 shares so you got margin called. Though You're right and your max loss should be the width of the strikes minus the premium. But you're obligated to buy those 300 shares at market price in order to sell them to the person that bought your call. Did they not hold your collateral? Or maybe because it's margin you only had to pay a portion upfront. 

It bears repeating, don't hold spreads to expiration. Hope your wife's boyfriend has money you can borrow!

I mean even then I don't see why their growth would stagnate, if we look at the place they fulfill in the tech industry.

Sure it might dip temporarily but in the long term it will likely knock customers off AWS/other cloud services when they figure out that in-house data science is too expensive/complicated.

WSB thinks it holds all the power but the reality is that this is a solid company that is going to grow significantly regardless.

Buy anything, I'm all in GME. SIR JACK OFF A LOT never loses.
Correct. They trade just like shares.  1 warrant gives you the right to buy 1 share at $11.50. 
There are some stipulations. 

They can not be exercised until 30 days after merger is complete, but, they can still be traded, so the equivalent of buying an ITM call, riding it up, and selling the call rather than exercising at expiration (yeah who does that).

CFDs are much simpler. If the leverage is 1:10 you throw in 1000 bucks and the platform backs you with another 9000. So you can buy 10 000 bucks worth of stoonks. And when you sell your stoonks at moonbase trading floor, they just take back their 9000 bucks and you keep the rest

People who use the term ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù like this guy have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about. I feel embarrassed for people who use that term out of context like this.
A stock going up isn‚Äôt manipulation, this is PLTR not a penny stock with 2 employees.  We aren‚Äôt manipulating anything, we‚Äôre only buying options and shares.  You don‚Äôt see us releasing news on stocks saying how crappy they are only to see us take the opposite position.

I'll break you the news about the euphoria going on in this current thread, it's not going to last. I sold about 10 40$ calls at 5.00/contract and I was confident that wsb would be wrong. Do your own research and don't follow these sheep. Citron has been doing this for 19 fucking years, but if they didn't some other hit company would first. Institutions love this because it signifies an exit for the big money to pile out and these retards to bag hold and whine and bitch on these threads. Downvotes inc.
I had a couple cheap 0dte lottos that were actually looking real good. Was thinking PLTR had room to $35 till Citron ruined the party. That's twice they ruined a nice little lotto play for me. NIO being the first. I actually made profit by flipping my position but still should not have gone down like that. Feels shitty to have a good play clipped like that. As for your 12/4s at this point fuck it diamond hands.

Just remember you always have a home where you can be insignificantly significant here :)
Yes. Then if you get a stock that just constantly goes up, you‚Äôll profit much more with a long dated option than just owning the stock. But if it goes sideways for a period of time it‚Äôs value drops. The key thing to know is: sell when there‚Äôs a market frenzy, when there‚Äôs a pop for a couple of days an IV is very high, that‚Äôs when you get the best return

If you think it‚Äôs going $50 plus you gotta leverage up to get those gains. more OTM to get  gamma on your side and potentially spread it short term to hedge for when IV collapses as the moon mission continues and Vega bends you over

Use BUX for CFDs. PLTR leverage is limited on 2x.. but it‚Äôs better than nothing. There are groups you can join, reading news, join battles.. it‚Äôs a cool App for losing money.

They should have. Talk to your broker if it  doesn't auto resolve by Monday but spreads will usually just cancel themselves out automatically if both are itm. Sometimes the AH trading can cause one to fall otm and cause funky shit to happen but that doesn't appear to be what happened here.

Most likely I believe they exercised one leg of the option ITM and not the other, which technically they're allowed to do. Make sure you close out options before they expire or you risk this happening again. JWN also had an ex dividend around this time, but luckily it's suspended (traders can execute the option leg you sold for this reason also).

Alright. Can someone tell me how I fucked myself today.

I bought a pltr 24c expiring yesterdayay. Long story short I'm retarded, out of day trades and ended up selling a  25c. This should have created a spread, correct? 

I was assigned after hours on the option I sold, and now I have a big fat -100 shares at 2830. 

However, in my notifications, it says my 24c expired, I was assigned on my 25c, and credited 2500. Above that's, it says my 24c was exercised,  subtracted 2400, but then says it's voided.

I don't completely understand pin risk or if that's what happened to me here, but how does one get assigned after market close, and I got the email at 12:15am the day after expiry. And why did both options, which were in the money at time of close yesterday, not cancel eachother out?

We can pump whatever the fuck we want and crush the short sellers. We will force the pltr short saueeze. Citron will be buying shares of PLTR like andrew left is the new CEO of PLTR to cover their short losses. Really excited for the madness next week!
Where the fuck are the hookers?
Just sell the underlying asset come Monday morning
Exactly!!
It's an absolute no brainer which is why it's already had such a positive effect on price. Even after inclusion it's going to be locked in at the higher price because all the funds buying these shares have to hold them lol so you're getting massive buying with very little selling.
No... what I'm saying is that due to the reality that the big 4 have audited every single company that was eventually revealed to be a fraud, they have zero credibility when it comes to discovering said fraud.  And really what we're talking about is adverse incentives meets the principal agent problem.  The SEC is gutless and incompetent, but if they really, really wanted to, the big four could *probably* identify frauds very early on (and by "wanted to" I mean got paid for all the clients they would lose if they did).  The fact that there are **KNOWN** fraudulent companies still operating and still being audited by the big 4 just shows how corrupt the entire circus is.

China is so corrupt that Apple, one of the biggest global American companies, simply cannot do business in China without surrogates on the ground who make sure everything runs smoothly.  And even then, Apple is forced to audit their surrogates at every step.

how are they gonna distribute the super crack to the hood without pltr?
I dont quite fully understand SPACs, its kinda frustrating. Their purpose is to exist as a "blank check" company and their job is to buy/merge with other companies... so when they aquire a company, what do they do? Do they literally just provide a platform to help the other company list onto the public market and gain funding? 

Well then how the hell does the SPAC get listed? I just see it like its a few dudes that say "hey people give us money so we can buy a company, but we're not gonna tell you shit about it until we feel like it. who's in?" This just seems so non transparent.

Wouldn't the company that actually does  something have an easier time listing than the SPAC? I don't get why they don't just do this in house. I can't believe this scheme even works.

And after the mergers/acquisitions, what does the SPAC do for the other company? They just own it now?

 I'm so confused. Any help would be much appreciated.

They say stocks are not world and they are forward looking.    
    

Then they say it's just an ordinary war, people die of wars every year.   
    

Then they say we are going to develop a nice peace treaty end of year.

If you could do maybe 1 inch worth of research you could see that NIO is audited by an American big 4 firm. They just need to transition from IFRS to US GAAP I assume as well and not use non US GAAP measures, which are certain ways of capitalizing costs, showing ratios and displaying other financial information.

3 years ago, I was thinking that this company was awesome but it wasn't the right time for it to go big. But now might be the perfect time. My company is almost 100% remote due to covid and we've been told that they plan on staying close to that permanently. We've been more productive than ever before, employees are happy, the men have been able to grow their beards out, and the company has been seeing booming business to the point that they have to turn down a lot of business.

Uhhhhhh being a millionaire in a third world country (not like a shithole like the Congo, like a Vietnam or a Paraguay) is way better than being lower middle class in America.

Stock screener. Honestly it doesn‚Äôt take much to find a pattern/movement/change in trend.

Started with 4k up to 80k. I‚Äôm 100% sure I got lucky a lot and the pandemic helped too I guess.

But I had a lot of winners very little bad buys.

Learn about technicals and you will have an edge to the others who follow news and analysts (jump on stocks when they are already running up) it doesn‚Äôt take much I‚Äôm very dumb and use 4 indicators to find stocks.

CFD is the best. Started with 4k mid July I‚Äôm up 80k‚Ç¨. Just make sure to know when you have to exit and when to let the winners run. 

I would use CFD to build wealth. Take 4k like me buy few shares weekly on a company you see potential and once they take off build a portfolio with the gains reinvest reinvest reinvest. 

Trading212 had 1:5 leverage now they will change it to 1:2. Unfortunately now I have to cash out many stocks I wouldn‚Äôt like to. 

Maybe it‚Äôs for the best because it‚Äôs a lot of money and otherwise I would‚Äôve never cashed out. 

It helps you to make a lot more than you have. It‚Äôs also higher risk and you can lose it faster. Although in the current market you will make money with almost everything.

You won't be able to buy so many options contracts because the price of those contracts will soar to such heights that it won't be profitable to buy them. Imagine the price of  $30c 12/04 to be something like $20, so you would need to reach the price of $50 by 12/04 just to break even.

If they pass it then federal decriminalization can become a key issue of the Georgia senate race, which was already tight.

> Alas, there was not a happy ending for the couple, because they separated in 2006 and divorced in 2008. Andrea was engaged to be married to another man just six months later, but her ex must‚Äôve been jumping for joy on his breaks from rolling around in money. Before the divorce was finalized, Andrew agreed to pay Andrea $32,547 in monthly spousal support and $14,590 in monthly child support. If Andrea got remarried, he wouldn‚Äôt have to keep shelling out almost $50,000 a month in support payments.  
>  
>But as frequently occurs in [divorce train wrecks](https://abovethelaw.com/category/divorce-train-wrecks/), not everything was wrapped up in a pretty little bow by the time that Andrea was supposed to get remarried on May 2, 2009, and Andrea didn‚Äôt want to involve her soon-to-be husband in pending litigation. So, like any former lawyer would do, Andrea neglected to obtain an important legal document that would‚Äôve sealed the deal. From the California Second District Court of Appeal‚Äôs [opinion](http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/08/27/Left.pdf):

Historically, investors flocked to gold during economic crisis... but that was a boomer play. Everyone failed to predict that TSLA would be the new commodity. People invest in it because it's a valuable safe haven, which makes more people invest in it. When this feedback loop gets broken we are going to see a crash of epic proportion.

I had 60 $250 (pre split) calls on Tesla in October 2019 and sold them at profits from 100% to a max of 1000%.. If I was a retard like this above guy.. I wouid have just kept them rolling and today had 1 fking billion dollars.. 

It is impossible for any sane or rational person to hold so many calls on a bubble company like NIO. The above person is a true Autist and belongs here. It is not like he held call on Apple or even Tesla.. He did on A fking Chinese company which is KNOWN to have several issues by those who follow electric cars. 

I dont wish him loss porn but he should lose at least some of this just as a reminder that this was pure luck and a lottery ticket with some retard thought process..

Congratulations and FU true autist!!

Today i learned Japan surrendered after the 2 nuclear bombs on the SAME conditions that they were already willing to surrender under before the bombs were even dropped. All that because in order for the cold war to have any effect people needed to understand and fear the effects of a nuclear bomb otherwise they would not be as scared and it would not justify the military expenditures.

It looks like they might be in the process of being bought out by some dude who actually knows how to run online retailers and they have a sweetheart deal with Microsoft. They are going to be pioneering a monthly subscription service for the *actual hardware* where for 30 bucks a month you get an Xbox and Xbox live which is going to bring a ton more people into the Microsoft ecosystem that they had lost due to the increasing prices of consoles. In exchange Gamestop will get a cut of digital game sales, microtransactions, and subscriptions, letting them profit on the very thing that was driving them out of business.
The peak hasn't even begun yet. We all buy at the peak at some time.

I do agree that they all could be dodgy.
Nonetheless, misinfo needs to be corrected.
And if they all can be dodgy, many other non chinese companies audited by them can be fraudulent, and they have been proven to be in the past. Not specific to chinese companies.

The point im trying to get across is that the fact that Nio is independently audited by pwc should prevent Nio from getting delisted, not that pwc cannot be dodgy.

>I don‚Äôt understand any of this shit about how they stopped leverage on stocks. Don‚Äôt I decide how leveraged I wanna be?

No the broker decides pretty much

>Also, I didn‚Äôt do it through the ‚ÄòCFD‚Äô option on the app, there‚Äôs a separate section which is ‚Äòinvest‚Äô and only talks about stocks - like real stocks

Oh then you actually just bought 100 euro worth of shares instead which unfortunately isn't going to make a lot of money

For example pltr goes up to 50 dollars per share you will only have made 60 dollars profit on top of the 100 you invested

While with an option if I bought a contract call at 30 and the price went up to 50 I own 100 shares because an options contract is to buy 100 shares which means I just made 100 times 20 which is 2000 dollars. Minus the initial investment of like 400 dollars i made a net profit of 1600 dollars while you only made 60

Even if you invested 400 you would only have made 300 something dollars

Stocks really aren't worth it if you aren't dumping in thousands, even if pltr went to 80 dollars you still aren't making much

Now thats not to say options is easier, its actually much harder and your rate of return can be zero in some cases while with stocks you generally aren't going to lose your entire investment

The entire "unless audited by American big four" is such a load of bullshit.

Behind ever single massive fraud/ponzi/pyramid scheme, a big 4 accounting firm has reviewed and approved their balansheets and regular submissions to the SEC.

There are many *active* frauds/ponzi schemes still operating without being flagged by the big accounting firms.

After you understand this, perhaps we can have a talk about the current CoViD GAAP carve outs or maybe we can reach all the way back to 2009/2010 suspension mark-to-market accounting (still in play over a decade later).

That said, China is an entirely different beast.  I remember listening to an NPR piece about a guy from Africa who's family has saved up for *years* to go to China and buy a container of clothing and appliance products.  While negotiating with one of the Chinese companies, at their factory, he was robbed at knife point and has his entire savings stolen.  He tried to file a police report, but the police just laughed at him and said he "should have known better".  China is currently laughing at the world waiting for the inevitable moment where they tell everyone that they "should have known better".  When you're dealing with that level of fraud, the American Big Four aren't going correct the situation.
depends where you are, in germany i think it's illegal if you blow at least a .05 if i remember correctly

probably depends on the state here too

Bought 395 shares at direct listing for $10. Sold at $12. Then saw it kept going up so I bought in at 13.75 for 1000 shares. Got spooked on earnings so sold at 15.50.  After that saw it go up and up and now I'm sitting at 350 shares at $27. I learned my lesson and will add more if it dips more. My prediction is it will hit $24 before it moons to $38

Dropping 100k when market opens
That‚Äôs the big question I guess. The reason many tech/cloud stocks got boosted during covid is because their sales cycles got pulled forward a couple years. 

Will they be able to continue sales at a higher pace now or has demand slowed due to the surge during covid? Since the vaccine news many of these companies have been trading downwards

It‚Äôs the same question for many companies and industries eg TDOC, ZM etc

Fair enough. When you do look at the investor deck though they only show historical revenue for half of 2019 and 2020. The 2H 2019 growth was still good, but less than 2020. It would be interesting to know what their actual growth was prior to 2H 2019 to actually have a reasonable baseline of what to expect. It could be that recent quarters are an outlier for all we know.

Though as you say these stocks trade more on hype and sentiment these days anyway so who am I to say what‚Äôs fair or not

Yeah, right around a month ago GME bottomed at near 10$ after dropping all the way from 15$. GME sentiment was at an all time low around here

I mean yeah maybe if a console has been out for a couple years already you'd be right. But we are talking about the *release of the next gen*. 

Do you go into your local Walmart 6 months before the release of a console and say 'hi id like to pre-order a ps5 and ill pay in full now' and then whip out a wad of greesy $20 bills on the counter? No you go to gamestop to pre-order it like you did for the ps4 and the 360.

The people who are dead set on getting these consoles have forked over their money for them ages before the consoles ever arrived.

They've lent shares out short which have been lent out short again. Just a big chain of people lending borrowed shares to eachother to sell them short

Quick question, I have a level 2 options account on etrade, can I sell covered calls at that level?
But with dividend paying companies esp around 5% or greater perhaps this risk is a little more mitigated. Also tbf it‚Äôs sus af cuz there‚Äôs too many Chinese finance companies with such low valuation but trade flat. Makes no sense for them to be trading like that.

Instead of buying a put, or a short position, you can sell one on the market. This gives someone the right to sell 100 palantir shares to you at the price you have set in the put. When you sell one of these contracts you will receive money for it. This money is called the premium and is the price the buyer of your put has paid for the right to be able to sell you 100 shares at the defined price. The premium is made by calculating a price per share for the rights. Factors are: the implied volatility of the stock, the time the contract is running for and more. 

By selling a put option you get the premium but run quite a bit of risk. For example: you sell a put option with a defined share sell price for palantir of 20 dollars a share, the contract runs untill january 2021. For this contract you will receive a premium of 2,33 a share so 233 dollars in total. If the price of palantir stays above execution price + premium = 20 - 2,33 = 17,66 you will make 233 dollars in this time. However, if during that time the price drops to 10 dollars a share you will get 100 shares of palantir for 20 dollars while the current market price is 10. This would (if you want to sell these shares) mean a loss of 100 x (20 - 10) = 1000 minus the premium of 233 = -766 dollars loss. Hope that wasnt too difficult, if it was dont do these kind of things.

Facebook is more into this sort of things. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll acquire. Too much antitrust scrutiny as is in both the US and the EU. Google is in the same boat. 

It looks to me everybody‚Äôs hyper focused on Palantir‚Äôs capabilities for government agencies. They‚Äôre is big play in the private sector, namely legal. eDiscovery is massive and has been putting lawyers out of commission. AI allows one or a few lawyers to read say 100,000 emails very efficiently as opposed to going through all of them. Google: Predictive Coding. 

This relies on the AI being able to process unstructured text and extracting context. Not the same as structured Big Data. Any shit company can do that. 

If PLTR has good AI in this area, they‚Äôll allow any company with cash to play with data like Facebook.

Your missing the point, they are looking to move *away* from brick and mortal retail sales. They are launching a program where you can basically own an Xbox for *2 years* for only like $30 bucks a month.

Do you know how many fucking 14 year olds with their McDonald's paycheck would go do that as soon as possible instead of begging their parents to give them one for Xmas? Also, there are a lot of people, entire demographics even that straight up can't afford to own a next gen console even if they want to get one. In exchange for getting the console into the hands of as many people as possible gamestop will get a cut of all digital game sales, microtransactions, and subscriptions from Microsoft.


Gamestops biggest problem was never online retailers, it was the fucking Playstation and Xbox stores on the consoles themselves.

With this model their overhead drops substantially as they wouldn't have to have nearly as many retailers and would not have to aquire physical inventory to sell. They will be offering a unique service that there will be a higher and higher demand for as each next gen console becomes more and more expensive, and they'll be making money from all the transactions that people are already making that have been *the reason* why they've been flailing.


This will get investors excited enough to trigger the squeeze.

2/3s majority needed. There should be enough institutional lobbying to prevent that which means the stock could surge. If not it‚Äôs three years notice. But will keep an eye on it thx.

Nah man. Q4 and Q1 are going to be massive with the new console releases. Plus Ryan Cohen is telling the board to get their asses in gear or else.

The video game market has exploded this year with the all the lockdowns. Even if GME is getting a smaller piece of the pie than they used to, the pie has still grown significantly.

Second question: if call option is losing and there are 2-3 months left until expiration any other strategy to cover up losses or buy put?

FWIW I think they are already trading at a historical P/S of 20. So I think it‚Äôs likely priced fairly now. 

Also their growth of 25% in 2020 is probably largely driven by a covid move to the cloud - is it really likely that they would replicate this?

This isn‚Äôt to say the stock can‚Äôt run wild. I don‚Äôt think most spacs these days are actually trading on fundamentals haha

Because it would likely still have extrinsic value before expiration which is a big chunk of the cost of the contracts that you bought, unless you bought ITM at 0.99 delta.  If you were to exercise, you should probably have a good reason to do so.  Otherwise, you‚Äôre throwing money away.  People rarely exercise their options here.
People that do this probably had plenty in the bank to begin with
Any similarities to what Splunk (SPLK) does? I know nothing of PLTR but your description of it just reminded me of working with Splunk

With 737 fiasco in the rear mirror and vaccines coming out and life starting to get back to normal, I would not bet again BA.  It was $400+/share pre 737/covid so it still has a lot more room to recover.

Europe is awake
My dog passed away this morning :(
I would say go apha or Weed
I agree. OP is too optimistic. I have a hard time seeing this hit more than $100. With a short interest much lower than VW‚Äôs and the fact that people know about this in advance, the chances of the squeeze happening aren‚Äôt even on the same level, let alone a 3000% jump.

Energy stocks have been doing well. GPOR was on my radar but I didn‚Äôt touch it. Potentially big gains on this one if it can pop.
just pick a far enough date and a pretty deep itm call (anything april and beyond should be fine). even if you miss the squeeze you still bank from appreciation in share value and then re enter the position.

Oh very nice. Milton's shares are also out of lock up on the 1st. Def worth a put i think, ima consider a put for next week. 
Don't say forget PLTR though, that's crazy talk!
Yes i know. So im thinking this news shouldnt affect Nio or Baba.
Idk some stocks are still pretty volatile so may be not as much assuming you get off when you make a decent return. 

Cuz im assuming the fact that the market bounced back so fast caused a lot of volatility, the only way there would be IV crush is if stocks leveled out and didnt move drastically. 

Which really hasn‚Äôt been the case.

They might ban chinese stocks who refuse independent audit. Nio is audited independently by pwc zhong tian.
Obviousely the biggest downside to options is the theta molesting you slowly each day, and with CFDs lower and more meme-potential stonks have higher spreads and lower leverage posibilities. So its not a yes no easy answer but I would like your opinion on this.

The theory is correct. Normal people can't fucking make these gains because we'll sell when it reasonable. Fuck i would have sold once i doubled my money, probably tripled. 

This fucking retard is going to diamond hands it just so he doesn't have to pay a little taxes off his 2 Mƒ∞LLƒ∞ON dollar profit and i can't be any more mad about this.

I fucking hope NIO tanks just so I can see the loss porn now. It'll all be worth it.
Lmao, if he pulled out right now he‚Äôd legit have to open 10 different bank account for his money to be fully insured. Imagine opening 10 bank account and buying a Ferrari in cash TOMORROW.

Selling right now would be 37% and selling in a year would be 20%. That‚Äôs a difference of about 300-400k. If Nio stock drops and shaves 500k off your gains you‚Äôre still paying 20% of 1.4m which is 280,000. That 20% plus the 500k you lost from the drop amount to 780k which is similar to what you would be paying right now. The difference is... if you sell **right now** you can‚Äôt possible lose more than that number.

People believe it has high valuation because it has gone up so much recently. 

The company had a failed launch of one of their games in one of their markets. The so called efficent market then sent the stock tumbling down to 23$ in March, a valuation not far from their Net cash position of around 20$. 
So at that time you could buy the company and get the business for free.. so. This company is still cheap.

Is it the best investment, im not sure.

Cool write up.
Agreed. You can always leverage the equity in your home through a HELOC at the same rates you would a mortgage. You have access to cash anytime but you‚Äôre only having to pay on what you actually use/borrow. 

And really take a look at your mortgage notes ladies and gents - rates are the lowest they‚Äôve ever been, sure, but if you break it down during the life of the loan, you‚Äôre still paying 33% of home value towards that interest. If you want to by a $400k home, paying cash saves you $132k in interest alone.

And look at amazon now. You do realize that this is what investing really is? Because now we can hedge our bets so it doesn‚Äôt matter if the bubble pops. NIO isn‚Äôt going back to 5. Never will. I doubt it sees 20 again, and more likely it stays above 30 or just flat at worst. So the real investors are going to hold, and we‚Äôre going to stay rich. Meanwhile, this is a legit company. Everyone seems to forget about that with their rocket ship emojis. Same with PLTR. Saying it‚Äôs total bullshit is just as misguided as the retards here riding it to $1000.
You have to start answering those questions yourself. No one has an answer for you.
Hahaha let me stop laughing then I can speak. It‚Äôs just that WSB has come so far. A few months ago someone asking this kind of question would have been mocked and shunned until they deleted the post and never posted here again; but alas times have changed.

Depends on a few things, IV is important to the value of the contract when you are trading it and is relative when speaking to the difference between buy/sell timing. Yes you will make more money if you start with an ITM contract in the first place but it will also cost more, and if you buy ITM at an expensive premium and it drops and you sell OTM, then you are really gonna sit on the Washington Monument

My guess, it will probably go steady until people start speculating about making quarterly/yearly numbers in the last few weeks of the year.

Unless he releases Autonomous driving level 5 early.  But when he released electric all wheel drive, the stock dropped, so idk if the announcement will have any effect and it probably is mostly priced in now because he has already said he will release it this year and we only have 4 weeks left.  The thing to keep in mind is that they are consistently a bit late on the tech release timelines.  

Usually it‚Äôs just the delivery numbers people pay attention to anyway.

Do not set it at $500.  If all the autistics do this, guess who will be left holding the bag?  Those who DIDN'T set it at $500.  Imagine all the shares sold at $400...$425....$470...$498... then $480...$440....$300...$100...

You get the picture.   Don't let greed rob you of this opportunity.   Be sensible.   Set it at a more realistic number that you'd be HAPPY with....like $100?  Or $160 for a 10 bagger?  Just saying...
Thanks for the post. I've been wondering about buying calls. I've been wondering if you think that MSFT is going to go above 230 why do you not for example the $225 Strike and make more per share?

Cool. Thanks. Have read up on this before. Enough medical and physics knowledge to think ‚Äòthis cannot be right‚Äô - it‚Äôs a very clever fraud or hype of something not quite yet ready.

You seem smart. I‚Äôm dumb and new. Can you please explain your position? If pltr goes beyond $31 by 12/31, will you exercise your call and get 100 shares of pltr at $31? Or will you sell your call?

Buy and hold SHARES. 

Don't be a pussy and try to ride the coattails of others and buy cheap weeklies that will expire worthless. 

The shorts will give up when they can't afford to pay the interest on their borrowed shares.  If you keep feeding them weekly premiums, they can hold out indefinitely.
What‚Äôs the point of using 3 brokerages instead of just making 3 portfolios?
You capped your gains at $50... and had huge loss risk.
Grand!

HOWEVER, i do hope they hit the nail on the head re. JMIA. I think they'd predicted $100 a share.

people short if they think a company is going down the drain

\-GME was not innovative and old (despite gaming/e-sports growing)

\-corona also hit them hard because they aren't popular online and shops had to close

\-it was a safe bet the last 5 years - what could possibly happen?

circumstances do matter (those examples are still good to look up). But we need ANY catalyst for the price to go above a threshhold so the shorters are forced to buy (afaik) which sets a chain reaction. Possible chain reactions:

\- earnings: if good => good for us, but only a small catalyst, if bad => cohen has to react (in any way... we are hoping for a hostile takeover)

\- king cohen himself: let's face it... he has to be a kind of a maniac (like elon maybe?). he might make a hostile takeover no matter what but i can't imagine him being tame and going it slowly or being a gay bear and sells his 9% and ruins his name

\- WSB: yes you heard it right - I think if we go full autist like on PLTR it is almost certain that a short squeeze will happen. Now that we gained some attention on friday and those post rise up the chance is even higher now. I can fully imagine this sub not only joining for the tendies and the YOLO but making this short squeeze to make the world burn for some people

Is it even possible for this to be capitol gains? I thought those applied to stocks and not options. And unless he's holding these options for a year (or is it 2?) it is still income the second he sells it unless he actually buys those stocks with the money they apparently dont have.

If the share price on 12/4 was $30, then you could exercise the option and buy 100 of them for $28... so you'd buy 100 @ $28 per share costing $2800, and be able to immediately sell them for $3000, so you'd have "saved" $200 (and I guess your profit would be 1.05 x 100 - 200 = $95 because you had to pay $105 to buy the contract). 

But today even though the price is $28.30, the contract itself is now worth $3.25?????? So that means it's worth $2.20 more than what you paid. The whole contract is worth $220.

So if you sell it now when it's worth $28.30, your profit is $220, but if you wait till the last day and the underlying is worth $30, your profit is only $95. That sounds weird, it's worth more now when it's worth $28.30 with an uncertain final value than it would be worth on 12/4 if exceeded the strike price by $2.

Huhhh? Sounds weird, am I getting this right? It's like a really exaggerated profit.

One problem that bothers me (I'm in GME  with 2k shared, 50 calls) is that the amount of available shares to borrow never seems to run out (check https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME).  Even with what happened this past week, somehow the available shares keeps bouncing up to +1,000,000.  It'll take a ton of money to reduce the float because these short sellers seemingly have an endless supply of shares.

Maybe someone is laying down a trap for the short sellers and plan on recalling these shares?  Or the retail buyers are allowing their shares to be lent out by the brokers?  Each month the amount of outstanding share increases and that's with the rising GME stock price!  

So there's definitely illegal stuff happening to suppress the squeeze because none of this makes any sense.

That being said, the battle (and yes it's a battle) between short sellers and the bulls is one of attrition.   Paper hand retailors don't help the cause with their weekly calls.  Shorts just collect premium over and over to wear down the bulls.   Buying AND holding shares is the way.  But this being WSB...yeah, that's a battle on of it's self.   Greed will drive people into calls instead of shares.
Wtf we‚Äôre selling the premium before that

Seems unlikely. Those engineers are writing ad-hoc code to load random crap ("unstructured data") into database tables to allow fusion. The bulk of their product will then be fairly standard stats, graph inference and other ML goodness. Their advantage is being in a place to write the data conversion. This used to be called munging. Sometimes it will work and find useful insights at which point they have customer lockin and sometimes it won't - some companies will live the results and some will drop it and call it useless. This is consistent with reviews of their product. It will generate a lot of cash and grow quickly. It won't hyperscale like a startup.

Great guide but I'm still not clear on why I would want to buy a call as opposed to just going long. 

If I'm bullish a stock and I have available cash to buy the stock (I don't require a loan to buy the stock, have plenty of available cash in my brokerage just sitting on the sidelines), why would I buy a call?  

Let's say I'm really bullish on PLTR, and I think it's going to go up 30%... but I also accept that it may go down 30% too and if it does, I'll sell it. Let's say my goal is to make a 30k profit, but I'm also willing to accept a 30k loss. I buy 100k of the stock and if it goes up 30%, I make 30k. If it goes down 30%, I lose 30k and close the position. If it doesn't move in either direction, I had no gain or loss. So my max gain is 30k and my max loss is 30k, and it's possible for me to wind up with no gain or loss at all. 

If I had the exact same outlook on PLTR but wanted to do it with options, how would I be better off? Does the option allow me to do something like, if PLTR goes up 30%, I make 30k but if it goes down 30%, I only lose 15k? If it stays the same, I lose nothing? 

Another related question, what is the hypothetical scenario where I want to just buy the shares and another one where I want to buy the call.

Normal. I recommend reading some books on mindfulness. Meditation. Enlightenment. Self realization stuff. Stay away from new age bullshit selling you a ‚Äòbetter you‚Äô down the line. Frankly. The holy grail - money or not- is within...and again not in some new age ‚Äòchase your dreams‚Äô way.  - there is just a place underneath the numbness that you will come to remember. You must feel to heal. If what I‚Äôm saying resonates. Chase it down. It‚Äôll naturally just sort itself out.
I fuckin died lol
Why do you think they have an advantage of LI and XPEV? XPEV in particular I think has a lot going for it like already having their own automated factory vertically integrated unlike Nio depending on a govt entity etc. Nio will need to dilute shares to raise capital to build their own factory
Remember one thing and this will dispel you of all fucking notions of depression and other dark thoughts. Time is a gift. You know who the most fortunate being is? Dracula.

tell us after you do it

just know if you decide to cut your losses and walk away you're probably going to watch it sky rocket 5-10 minutes later

also if you hold it's just going to keep losing money

welcome to options

good luck

i can't remember exactly but i'm pretty sure my first option I bought a BP call and was down the first day, but the next day i sold it for $40-$60 profit. Got hooked, no looking back. Waking up to gains and losses of thousands of dollars at a time doesn't even cause you emotions eventually. First $500 loss hurt. First $1500 loss also hurt, but i got over it when i made $2300 the next day and sold literally everything less than an hour after open
Is this a real question? You just buy it and it goes up
Been in, and am on the same boat friendo. Live to fight another day, shit gets better if you make it so

Accept the fact that it is alright and natural to feel how you do. 

Dont stress about feeling better quickly. 

Dedicate time to read and walk. 

Follow tickers you want to play. No trades, just follow. Fundamental / tech analysis + level ll tape reading. 
Hunt trades (not chase) plan an attack and execute

In the meantime, learn your self and come up with a manifesto or declaration of intent. Pick a task, anything. Bring your fam together ? Own property ? Start your own family ? Anything 

Outline your boundaries, plan offense / defense. And execute when the time is right

Books i recommend;
Art of war.
Book of 5 rings.
Care of the soul - thomas Moore.
Range - david Epstein. 
Thinking in bets - annie duke. 
Pimp - iceberg slim. 

Podcasts i recommend;
Jordan b peterson, especially the biblical series but he speaks gold 

Chat with traders 

Manly p. Hall lectures

Additional notes;
There will always be another opportunity / trade / girl. You have choices 

Cut out sugar and processed food 
Meat is essential (i personally dont like it but i realize the more consistently i eat the better i feel 

Vitamins + supplements 
Take care of your teeth and skin. Hygiene basically 

Exercises and stretches are not optional 
Reading and learning is mandatory

Be nice but dont go the extra mile for just anybody

Last but certainly not least, cum less often or not at all. You need that man juice in your system, that testosterone works miracles for your health and good mood - trust. 

Today is where tomorrow is made friend, raise yourself like a predator

Agreed.  Blue should be an enum

Isn't the longer term thesis (not saying it will happen) that the platforms will evolve alongside AI advancements and get to a point where they can diverge from their current strategy to a more scalable / automated one?  
  
To me, they seem better positioned than the firms you mentioned to take advantage of said advancements.
no ur good. it would be a bad idea for the person who sold you the calls if there was a short squeeze.

mostly agree and lots of autists in this sub already jumped onto the train with our whales

one point though: usually we go full yolo on our plays with options however for GME shares is the way because 1) it's hard to time the squeeze and 2) buying out shares just makes the squeeze more likely (if whole reddit bought GME like it does PLTR we have a squeeze by the end of the year)

Would've had last couple of test flights this past weekend if it wasn't for covid. Also, good news is coming out of New Mexico where they're based in regards to their covid shutdown.

I‚Äôve been following GME for a while. The Ryan Cohen letter that was published in the WSJ and attached to his 13f is hugely bullish bc it‚Äôs setting the tone for a takeover/buyout of the current management. Next earnings is 12/8, speculation is that RC will make his move then if earnings are bad as evidence that the current board isn‚Äôt transitioning fast or well enough into an e-commerce platform that‚Äôs also ‚Äúthe ultimate gaming destination‚Äù. If shares have to be recalled for a vote for a new CEO then all of those shorts will have to cover. 

Even if this doesn‚Äôt happen, GME has been making leaps and bounds away from the model they were operating basically since the companies inception. 
The MSFT revenue sharing agreement on all digital purchases on all Xbox‚Äôs sold, same day shipping, bundles with new consoles being available at GameStops by walk in customers when they aren‚Äôt available anywhere else, recently started selling PC hardware. There are a lot of big things happening with GameStop in lieu of the huge SI.

Either this thing will gradually ramp up to 30+ or it will explode. Timing it is tough, I bled calls -50% for 6 weeks on this due to the shorts grinding it down and soon it‚Äôs tendie time motherfuckers.

Yeah but that literally wasn't good enough as a business when they came to market.  Everyone questioned it.  What do you make?  Where is the value?  What is the product?
Yes, we know now but back then...

imagine winning the powerpull and throwing it all on one position that ends up being a 20 bagger

The stock market is a funny place.

A person can make incorrect predictions 90% of the time and still keep his job and people still hold his opinion in high regard.

Imagine you are a meteorologist and your weather forecast is wrong 30% of the time.  You would be fired so fast.  

The logic is simple and can't be disputed:  If all these analysts are so good, they would be billionaires on some private island w/ 5 wives.

It's about time people stop listening to these crooks.   They are nothing more than paid shills working for the elites.
I'm 30 now and have lived a moderately successful life and I think what you're feeling is perfectly normal. Trading hours for dollars feels really empty once your Amazon wish list becomes fully purchased and you're not sure what to do after binging the tv series you've been waiting for the past 6 months.

I'm trying to fix my empty pit of nothing by taking a backpacking trip that'll have me alone and outdoors for 5+ months (Pacific Crest Trail). I don't think you need to do that, but I would strongly suggest you think about doing something very drastic and out of your norm up until this point. Experiences are what bring happiness, not things.

You got this bro. Follow the memes
Get Robinhood on your phone and then when you download it say I referred you so that we all get free stock


Hook up your bank account, tell them you know how to trade options, then go make a PLTR 40c on 12/4 once you get to the trade options screen. Buy as many contracts as you can afford and then wait til your screen has a green graph instead of red by 12/4 and that's pretty much how you join the retard club.
What's EA?
No one got rich avoiding taxes. Pay your taxes on your earned income and treat your brother AND his kids. 

Gift tax concerns? Get out.
Is there even buyers for these? You might need to trickle out little by little  so you don't saturate and the price for these specific calls go down.
Alright
Yeah. Basically it's a matter of reaction rate, controlled in a large part by surface area. For example, you can burn a pile of table sugar and it will just slowly burn away, but combustion of sugar dust suspended in air leads to powerful and dangerous explosions.

Same concept with ammonium nitrate/ fertilizer, but even more dangerous.
At his wealth level, him missing out of some of PLTR shares doesn't matter considering he probably still have a very large stake in it. There's something called prudence.
They believe in a world where the government monitors every single millisecond of our lives with 0 privacy. They literally want access to our inner thoughts and actions.

$SEARS you mean...
The real answer is comparable multiples of revenue, cash flow, or discounted future cash flows. But like... none of that matters. You can‚Äôt even figure out future cash flow for something like PLTR, NIO, these SPACs. These stocks are creating markets that don‚Äôt exist so don‚Äôt follow the linear growth of boomer stocks. 

So buy PLTR, üíé ü§ö üöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Fuck dude congrats. Good job not losing it all like I do time and time again
I agree, my love for pltr is getting a little too unhealthy I think.

I‚Äôll say that AMD is something I could see holding onto whether that be calls or just shares. What it‚Äôs been doing with its new products and the way it‚Äôs going can hit 100 but you have to give it some more time. 

I‚Äôve owned MSFT for the past 2 months since I was playing things cautious and thought it was safe. Right now it seems like a glorified savings account with what it‚Äôs doing. Hard sell and move into AMD

But what do I know, I‚Äôm just a 23 year old and still have a lot to learn about this stuff
I am so closed from hitting jackpot. I made some really good plays but sell too soon. I am down some money but the experience and shit I learned is priceless. I am so fucking close to getting it.

He thinks he can squeeze the shorts for every last drop.

If the company was burning to the ground and all its staff died of the bubonic plague tomorrow would not have an impact on the price at this point.

If all the share holders would collude and write a contract among each other that they won't sell below a hundred billion dollar per share, that's what they are going to get (not sure whether that is legal, however). They could even agree to split whatever payout remains when all the brokers (or whoever took the short risk in the end) are bankrupt, to make sure that this is more profitable than actually selling stock. The interest rate for shorting will go to infinity too if that were to happen.
You're correct üòÇüòÇüòÇ

TLDR on my AAPL DD that was removed.

Monthly fucking EQ (I had retarded pictures)

Daily/weekly equilibrium will break this week. IV is sitting at 40% for Jan 15 $140's.  This will double once the EQ breaks and smooth brains get interested again. 

$107 support breaks the trade has failed. (very fucking unlikely)

Res is $125 then ATH.  Premiums will pay for lambos on this one.

Jan 15 $140's were 0.70 cents today.

After reading this whole thread I have deduced two things. 1) I'm incredibly jealous. 2) OP is fucking retarded.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been depressed before until now. I have been homeless, a drug addict with nothing, yet I still didn‚Äôt feel sorry for myself. Right now I have a stable job (luckier than most), and I have more money than I‚Äôve ever had before in my life thanks to you guys. This last year has just been downhill, my job has lost a sense of purpose for me and I have little motivation, no real sense of purpose or drive anymore. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do with my life anymore. My girlfriend of 2.5 years made the decision to leave me, I was just so blind that I was steadily losing her. I have never felt so alone in this world before, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My family is scattered all over and right now I live in fucking Alaska, and the 6 hours and decreasing amount of daylight probably isn‚Äôt helping. Any recommendations or insight guys? I‚Äôm 26 and I have never felt this way before, I was always full of drive and purpose and life, and now I just feel dead and empty inside. The little joy I get now is really trading (when I‚Äôm making money) and playing the piano.

Also, btw, saying they have cash so they won't go bankrupt/ business model is much stronger now, is kinda waste of time. This market rally gives 0 shits to fundamentals and earnings per share. If panic hits the market again, there's no reason people won't pull out cash to lock in profits or prevent deeper losses. The algos sell faster than our RH fingers and to think a meme stock won't be part of such panic selling...is bold

Stakes are different this time. The EV revolution will increase the demand for NdPr which this mine has an abundance. People are overlooking that the Chinese will consume much of their domestic supply when their EV demand goes through the roof. Once MP has their processing back up, it's margins will increase dramatically. It's already posted impressive profits and that will see an increase as early as 2021 due to projected doubling of NdPr market prices.

OOM calls are cheap and if you buy them close to expiry they offer an unprecedented chance to make tendies IF the underlying goes up even a little (you don‚Äôt hold them to expiration so they just get more and more valuable during price movement upwards then you dump them). True autists buy FDs which are basically lotto tickets (you only have less than a week to see huge price action or you‚Äôre an idiot who wasted thousands of dollars).

Basically, we buy OOM options to risk our entire life savings on a ‚Äúbet‚Äù so we may one day own a yacht.

It's kind of funny how many people in this sub think buying ITM long dated LEAPs is retarded. This is a real example with current data straight from my portfolio right now

# hint: L E V E R A G E

# 

I bought three Jan 2023 LEAPs on JETS last week and I paid an average of $1237 for each of the three LEAPs totaling a cost of $3711 to enter the position

The delta of all three calls is 0.93 right now so for every dollar that JETS goes up i gain $93 x 3 = $279 profit

If I decided to waste money buying 300 shares instead around the time i bought the leaps it would've cost around $6,600 to enter that position for $22/share. If the stock goes up a dollar in this case then I gain $300, simple.

So if I'm holding LEAPs, when the stock goes up $1 then I make $279. In the case of buying shares you're paying $2889 more to enter a nearly identical position that earns $300 instead of $279 for the same movement in the stock. Fuck the $21 and spend $2.8k on something else that isn't retarded.

Also there is practically no theta fucking your option's value doing this.

I'd compare ITM LEAPs to OTM leaps but this shit is already getting too long and none of you would want to read it.

ya dig?

^(rant caused by too many people telling me that ITM LEAPs are retarded, no YOU"RE retarded)

right now no other stock with such strong convictions. xpev, li are good, RIDE has potential but is speculative with no deliveries yet. i still need to research more on Roblux... but I'm definitely interested in Robinhood's IPO
Why is the latter option of getting $3/share on a contract for a stock which moved up $6 bad? Is it because even though you get the premium but there's opportunity cost in the capital required?

PLTR isn‚Äôt for weak hands, you are not worthy to own it.
Anyone who doesn't like them is not a solid programmer. Source: am software engineer and that's how I hire people. You can tell the good from the mediocre very quickly.

Edit: a lot of people are misinterpreting what I'm saying. I'm not saying you should memorize a specific algorithm or something. I'm saying I will ask a candidate to write pseudocode, on the fly, for a particular problem we make up. To see their thought process and give us insight into their problem solving ability.
Great fucking idea. 

Also homeless shelters often have lists for kids that are staying there with their families.

So what does he do--tell all of yall to short ZI or buy puts.

&#x200B;

**I am warning you now----ZI is on an uptrend with bullish cup and handle. Your puts will expire worthless and you shall loose that hard earned $ thats better off buying calls on PLTR.**

&#x200B;

Also, ZI is no meme stock. Their earnings were phe-fucking-nominal and margins are comparable to TWLO and ZM. Find NKLA or other shitty stock to short.

&#x200B;

Also remember, Lemonade's lock up expired last Wed and it basically rocketed by 20% upon expiration. There is still time to cover your position or sell your puts and avoid the loss.

What if you regret your purchase and try to sell it right away for 215? Would you be able t resell it straight away for 1,67 anf regain most of what you put in? If not what would be the immediate reseale worth of the contracts for me right after i bought?

Im sure actually trading options would answer this on the first trade but i cant yet so :s
Dude im gonna need an AMA or something, your investing style is one that I couldn't fathom following no matter how hard I try. I will sell out of a tiny position for a slight gain in fear of losing it. I know its a terrible mindset that is really going to hold me back so seeing your investment thesis and general attitude on such a huuge portfolio being so completely on the extremes of the other side of my flawed approach is pretty inspiring.

A PLTR love story
XPEV is good long term, all four EV startups in China will be successful in 5 to 10 years, short term is a different story. I think XPEV could be dangerous in the short term, their G3's are being destroyed by competition from WM's EX5-Z; and their P7s are doing well for now while taking a small hit by Model 3 MICs; but once Nio launches their sedans it could be dangerous for Xpeng and will need to hurry and export those to other countries. Xpeng does have one of the better self-driving tech right now since they actually use Lidar, they do have room to grow, they can go to $100\~110 just to match Nio's current valuation, but can they go beyond that? I'm not sure. Xpeng and Li are just EV companies; Nio is more than just EV.

Palantir has repeatedly stated it will NEVER work with China or Russia and will only consider working with governments & companies with the same liberal democracy ideals. 

This is the reason palantir firmly believes it maintains a $170 BILLION dollar addressable market(according to their latest data). Palantir has China shook. Don‚Äôt kid yourselves.

The only thing China has going right now is it‚Äôs success in luring western banks into allowing CCP members to become analysts. China then makes those analysts release price targets on Chinese stocks like Xpeng, Li, and Nio with the benefit of it being tied to an American bank ie:JP Morgan, BoA, etc. 

It‚Äôs a pretty cool idea, until they are forced to undergo formal accounting audit and the CCP runs out of scams.

Edit: someone go copy and paste the name of every recent stock analyst linked to a Western bank that released price targets on Nio Xpeng or Li. Now go look at that banks recent news regarding operating in China. 

They aren‚Äôt even hiding it. It‚Äôs like Xi is working with the US in some crazy double agent reality.

Going ITM wasn't much more expensive?
it would only go to that during the squeeze, which will be incredibly short, (no more than a trading day, if not minutes) and that price has nothing to do with the company itself; it's purely a consequence of super high demand and there being *literally* no shares to buy to cover, so demand begets demand and the price skyrockets, temporarily.
Congrats and fuck you very much!!!

....got any more of those stock tips?
I'll put my 2 cents into this since I am familiar with the Industry (ecom and gaming).

They need to digitally transform. What does this mean? Focus on Ecommerce and less on brick and mortars.  This is where Cohen comes in. He is an expert at ECOM. take the Chewy model and apply it to [Gamestop.com](https://Gamestop.com)  Make it a Ecommerce Category Killer. If they did this they would be part of TWO secular growth trends, Ecom AND Gaming.

What would I do if I was the CEO of GME and wanted to save my ass from Cohen and the board firing me?

1) Ecommerce needs to be their #1 focus. Ecom sales up 800% last earnings but Cohen doesn't think it's enough. 

2) Grow Product assortment in PC gaming hardware  They need to diversify away from consoles and their down cycles. their rev was down 27% in Q2 and first reason listed was the console cycle.

* their PC assortment is garbage. They need hire a VP of Category Management and grow gaming PC, gaming laptops, video cards,monitors,gaming hardware, mouses, keyboards, gaming chairs, cams, headsets etc.  Compete with The Egg. Be the Wayfair, Chewy of gaming. A Category fucking killer "Gaming", Consoles AND PC.
* Assortment in PC stuff would also give them exposure to WFH shift. shit is exploding. There is a reason Logi and CRSR are mooning. 

3) I would not close the brick and mortars. I would use them as pickup centers for Ecom sales. Save on distribution costs for best sellers.  Also increase conversion as customers dont want their $1k gaming laptop being stolen from their porch.  

Oh and guess what happens when customers come in the store to pick up their items? they buy more shit they dont need like collectibles. why u think kohls partnered with Amazon?

&#x200B;

TLDR : Focus on ecommerce, grow pc gaming hardware 1000%, use stores as pickup to save on distribution costs and sell more shit to customers when they come in store to pick up, be the chewy/wayfair of gaming.

I think you have to see it as a kind of legal extortion play.

It doesn't matter if the company were to set fire to all of its assets tomorrow, because the price is determined by how much of a dick people holding the shares want to be; if they would collude by registering all their shares in a single company (I don't know whether this step is legal) and acting as one, they could in theory bankrupt the brokers worth billions and do damage to the insurance companies. (Actually, I am not sure whether this is correct. Can someone tell me?.)

That data,  Privacy International and No Tech For Tyrants write in their response, ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] could enable Palantir to experiment with, learn from, and improve the product‚Äôs ability to integrate with multifarious AI models, and to apply data transformation and normalisations in different ways.‚Äù 

In the few Palantir contracts that have been made publicly available, the company has consistently used ‚Äúimprovement clauses‚Äù that essentially allow the firm to train their algorithms and statistical models on customer usage data. For example, in a 2019 contract with the United States Department of Defense cited in the report, Palantir is granted access to collect ‚Äúanalytics, statistics, metrics, or other usage data related to the Customer‚Äôs use of the Products [‚Ä¶] to monitor, analyze, maintain, and improve the Products.

Higher volatility, thus, higher profit percentage. If the stock moves 10%, your call could move 100%. Atleast I believe this is how it works. 

Also if you don‚Äôt have enough to say, purchase Amazon stock. Allows you to make moves with less capital, but higher risk.
Yes
wait why soros fund still there, i thought they sold last week because ethical issue? fuk this shorting might be real now
Any way to calculate how high the stock needs to go to trigger the squeeze?
there's a stock i like that has growth potential and has like 4% dividend last time i checked, i prefer to go with that when i do diversify

Will this go down as one of the best Novembers in wsb history
Aside from the usually pltr and gme. crsr looks ready to rebound.
Cool down a bit if it runs up again after earnings just be patient and short it then otherwise maybe find other companies to trade on
I don't remember the last time that all of WSB has been singularly focused on squeezing this fruit. NIO got many people mad, but PLTR that's a bridge to fucking far. Monday we ride, the early WeBull battalions will open the attack, follow by waves of early brokerages, TDA, ET, FT then at 9 AM we call upon the HIVE: Robinhood (picture the ghost people from lord of the rings) it's on. Let's make a statement.

Hei, I'm copying here what I replied in a different post about FINV:

" 

Well, you were right yesterday it went up almost a 9% hahah.

I feel like the reason it is so cheap is because it is in a heavily regulated industry in China. Realistically if the PRC gov were to introduce heavy regulations on their business model their profitability could heavily suffer.

At the same time I feel the stock is so cheap that it is already sort of priced for the worst case scenario when it comes to regulations, so there is not much downside on that end. At the same time I've been reading their statements and it seems they are rotating towards 'higher' quality customers, with less interest pay, but less delinquency and due to that their cost of capital is being reduced aswell."

&#x200B;

As for it's balance sheet you should be careful not to mix CNY and USD numbers, they have 3 billion in cash and cash equivalents (in CNY)  which is around 500M$.

ya a friend followed my trade and exited nio when it was crashing hard. when nio was $1 he asked if im still holding, im like ya for sure, so he changed is mind and bought back some, when nio recovered to $5 he said if im that sure about this company, ya man, so he bought back more and held onto 10,000 shares when he originally had exited at a loss.
Not this fucker
I know a few employees and I‚Äôve tried to get a read on what the company is about years before ipo. It‚Äôs tricky, they hire geniuses to solve software/data problems for government agencies/corporations that wouldn‚Äôt normally have that level of engineering talent in house. Simultaneously they try to make customers dependent on their suite of software products so that they‚Äôre hooked into long term contracts. They add a lot of value and they‚Äôre very expensive. They‚Äôll grow, probably grow to a couple hundred billion but I doubt they‚Äôll ever be $ trillion+ primarily because they‚Äôre a consultancy. They‚Äôd have to provide services to a significant proportion of the world at which point those institutions would try to figure out how to bring the consultants in house. Only way they reach 1 trillion is if they change their business model from selling geniuses to selling more standardized products, which they are actively working on, but that‚Äôs a big challenge. If you have trouble understanding what they do, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs very complicated and they don‚Äôt want you to understand what they do; they want to be opaque, it‚Äôs part of their marketing strategy.
Name checks out.
 There were days were you could read decent DD on 3 different companies on the front page. It just get buried under the newtard sperging over PLTR and mountains of my wife's boyfriend jokes, but let's be honest, it's been heading towards this direction ever since PRPL. And now apparently millionaires making 40k on a few percent gain is considered gain porn. This used to be a sub of actual retards yoloing their life savings and getting that sweet FD or $ROPEing. Now it's just an average shitty stocks discord channel. Most of us have left for another smaller community anyways.

a dip to 30 is short term, this stock is a growth stock, it won't stay at 30 if it dips to 30
ZM fucking infuriates me. They make like $600M and then rally to $100B+ market cap. Now we have an earnings on Monday.


My prediction? However much they make would be a small and shitty amount that should 100% be waaaaay more than priced in but the stock will still hit 600-700. It‚Äôs fucking annoying.


This fucking piece of shit has a PE ratio of 1600 or some shit (makes TSLA and PLTR look rational), and it‚Äôs still gonna rally with less than a billion dollars in revenue. Holy fuck I‚Äôm heated.


Edit: for those who are new, the shitty $600M earnings took ZM from 300 -> 450 and made so many idiots rich FUCK, **but this was two days before the Sept. 3rd crash so clearly that move was so autistic that it caused the bubble to finally pop for a bit**

tesla to 700 this friday fucking easily
up?
nope that's gay, here's the math

i actually bought a third LEAP i forgot about today at its current price so it lowered my return % averaging them all out, but I paid an average of $1237 for each of the three LEAPs totaling a cost of $3711

The delta of all three calls is 0.93 right now so for every dollar that JETS goes up i gain $93 x 3 = $279 profit

Buying 300 shares instead around the time I bought the leaps would've cost around $6,600 to hold that position. If the stock goes up a dollar then I gain $300. 

So if the stock goes up $1 I make $279 and if I spent $3000 more buying stocks instead I would make $300. Boo hoo that's $21 less dollars in my pocket when I can go spend $3000 on something else that has a lot of leverage

ya dig?

Fine. The explosive element in fertilizer is ammonium nitrate. When ammonium nitrate under enough heat and pressure experiences a catalyst inflow of energy it undergoes a rapid exothermic reaction as it decomposes into superheated, rapidly expanding water vapor and nitrous oxide.

a bit dangerous now with current price for calls expiring so soon, my $38 calls are pretty safe, should be able to keep most of the profits from that; but my $50 and $55 calls are at risk, so we will see. hopefully november delivery numbers next week push us to 60

i haven't done it before but based on what ive read in IRS publications is when you exercise the call options no capital gains is realized, instead it's as if you just bought the shares using a coupon and the cost of the coupon is added to the cost basis of the strike price; so you have to hold the stock for another year before you can sell it for long term capital gains tax rate.
Great guide.

Usually
Congress got old whites so they probably gonna vote No.


What do you need to know about options? Calls if you think going uppies, puts if you think going downies. Watch out for theta (time decay), and find a balance with expiration date and how far out-of-the-money you go.
Is that a SEC trading rule or is that just based on you building lending systems at brokers? 

It looks like this GME squeeze has been widely advertised for months (7 to be precise) and even YouTubers (ugh) have advertised it. 

It's almost like a hedge fund paid various influencers and writers to talk about it. 

I think I am too late for this particular trade, but if I had understood the trade 7 months ago, I would have pulled the trigger on it.

It's kind of stupid of me, because I was too arrogant to not consider the short squeeze play as a serious thing. 

It's the first time I see it play out in real time and the environment in which it happens. 

To be fair, I think playing short squeezes is fairly advanced trading considering that you are basically trying to attack hedge funds, which typically makes it a David vs Goliath.

I‚Äôm a retard, 2022*
they got enough cash to build 3 megafactories, if talking about the tiny factories xpeng has, then they can build 10 of those with the cash they have on hand right now... building factories before you have demand doesn't make sense, their current joint venture factory can produce at max capacity 300,000 a year once it is fully expanded... once they are delivering 150,000 cars a year then they can decide whether to build their own factory or not. not having a factory right now is a plus... you get to get the share price gains when they do announce they are building their own factory

Im taking u had a bad run with JD?
No. Citron research is very bad to rely on. They have been bearish on some stocks that went to Andromeda. (NVDA). Basically, they scare the market to pull out so they can get a discounted price when they want to buy in, PLTR today 11/27/2020. Citron Research should be looked at for stock manipulation. WSB cannot be eligible for this because we are just saying that this stock (PLTR) is going up because of the company‚Äôs history as well as it being very undervalued for the type of work that they do. Also compare it to $SNOW. They do the same thing but PLTR does it better, so PLTR will definitely go up and the message from Citron was to scare people into selling for their gain, while in the meantime, when this stock is in the 3 digits, $20 buy or $30 buy in will not mean as much as it does right now. 
TLDR: Citron should be BANNED

Good to know, puts = bad, calls = good. Fuck gay bears
Wow either way I didn‚Äôt expect them to take that much in tax but I agree with your decision to hold if you believe in the company. I‚Äôm not aware of NIO TBH, but everyone is saying it‚Äôs a meme stock with no factories, production, etc. Congrats man this is a dream gain... if you feel too much risk don‚Äôt hesitate to pull out half lol.
I don‚Äôt understand the tax implication of exercise and then hold one year. Can you please explain? And congratulations üçæ you did it!
So, if I buy a $31 call on PLTR expiring 12/4: 

- I lose all my money if the price stays below $31 and I let the option expire worthless on 12/4

- I lose some of my money if the price stays below $31 and I decide to sell the option early at a lower price than I bought it

- I gain money if the price begins to approach $31 and I sell the option at a higher price than I bought it (taking into account the loss in value over time/Theta)

Does this sound correct? I think I understand this but I want to make sure before I bet a couple hundred dollars on my first option. 

Also I understand the concept of limiting myself to +100%/-50%, basically if I watch the option price go above +100% or below -50% (or whatever personal limits I set for myself) then I sell it to minimize risk. 

If I don't have the capital to exercise these options, it's still safe to buy and sell them, correct? Robinhood's risk management might take over for me if it gets to the last day, but the "worst" that could happen is I lose the full price I paid for the option, I can't somehow end up deeper in the negative?
Maybe some weapons. From the soviet era would be a preference.

Okay if you‚Äôre doing a call then the format is $8.5C 12/15 

The strike price followed by the expiration so we know your position. I thought you bought $100 in shares and were aiming for a 5% return

Also. Check out optionsprofitcalculator.com and plug your contract in to see when you want to get out. Theta is the silent killer.

PFE has too large of a market cap to be worth your time, but BNTX is looking quite juicy.

I'll be loading up on BNTX 120 EOM calls next week.
Thanks, this is very helpful. Let's say you have about 200 dollars to spare every month that you wouldn't mind losing. Would you recommend buying calls of  smaller, more volatile stocks to gain maximum value? Like say a PLTR has a much higher chance of moving significantly than say an MSFT. Is the higher volatility of PLTR priced into the option price? i.e. would a slightly out of money call on PLTR be more expensive than a slightly out of money call on MSFT given PLTR is more likely to see swings and thereby more likely to be in the money during the term of the option?

no, it's about progress, their net losses have been dropping significantly quarter over quarter, and they haven't cashed in on their carbon credits yet, they'll be profitable within 2 to 3 years if not sooner. net losses were horrible in past years because they had to pay a penalty to the manufacturer if they didn't have enough orders, same thing AMD went through with Global Foundries in the early years of Ryzen

I think the GameStop of yesteryear is over and not coming back. Right now, they have a lot of money and a tremendous market opportunity (online gaming). For me, the main question is will they shift to online or try to make the store model work (try to do what Best Buy has done). I think if they shift to online, they have a chance, though not guaranteed. There's reason to believe (recent board additions and pressure from shareholders) that they'll make the shift. If they shift effectively, they could go big.

I'm a 22 year old autistic student about to invest 800 in pltr on Monday shots gonna rocket
I want to make an Oscar winning movie about investing... but all the actors are gonna be midgets.. trying to SHORT the market.

‚Äú They‚Äôve been calling us short our entire lives.. maybe it‚Äôs time we show them how short we can really get ‚Äú

This is a boring play but AAPL new macs are killing it. Earnings at the end of January should reflect the increase in revenue from personal computers. The market may interpret this as Apple taking market share away from google. And ofcourse the pre earnings run up and option premiums increase due to IV will be good. March expiry calls with high delta is what I‚Äôd shoot for.
That's not a horror movie, just a pseudo-snuff film.

Alright I‚Äôm in on Monday. It‚Äôs at $28.50 now already up. Pre-market Monday will c where it‚Äôs all. Buy a call and the rest be shares like 10?

Personally, fuck NVDA, marry AMD, kill INTC.
That is odd.  Hopefully by Mon - funds are ready to go.
I have seen funds not available on we bull and then at market open, they were magically available.  Did not help for the pre-market...but better than nothing.
i was just thinking this today
Exactly. People need to understand we have to buy shares to create the pressure for a squeeze
This isn't autism its straight up retardation
The only reason I don't think we will see an infinitum squeeze like we did with VW in late 2000s, is because there is no catalyst. 

As it sits currently, gamestop is a failing company with largely tons of money tied into their retail locations. Unless some type of buyout or incredible shift from Gamestop within, I don't think these "market makers" are going to let this ride. They might just take the bunt on this one. 

Cheers
So sell everything and buy pltr at opening ? Got it.

This comment is scary
It will still exist to a capacity, ET exists and is doing great dividends-wise, ZNOG is "searching" for oil in Israel in order to create oil independence for that country, and GPOR is a total guess, so I'm sure what you said applies to some capacity, but not wholly.
Ooooh... You just gave me a great strategy to test. If Citon downgrades a stock, just buy it up with leap calls. Thank you!

The second is NIO will still be a force to reckon with in China and hold its share value compared to rest of China EV and TSLA.

I assume this is what you mean.

$240 - $215 = $25

$240 - $230 = $10

So if you bought 1 contract you net more cash wise but less as a percentage because you have to put up way more money on the $215 strike price vs the $230

Assume you paid $10 for the $215 strike price that $230 strike price is maybe worth $2.5

Assume you have $1000 you can only buy 1 contract at the $215 strike price. At the $230 strik price you would be able to 4 contracts

Now do the math

($240 - $215)x1 = $25

($240 - $230)x4 = $40

The further otm you buy the more theta works against you it‚Äôs riskier but the better the rewards are. 

I‚Äôm assuming I answered your question

Intel is insanely undervalued‚Äîbased on all of their trends, they should be shooting up soon (review all the previous years charts for Jan-May).  I have a ton of calls lined up for early next year.
OP so worried about paying taxes it‚Äôs like he‚Äôd prefer to end up posting a loss and pay zero taxes than diversify his stocks and pay short term capital gains. I do agree with his move to wait until he can avoid short term capital gains to realize any profits, since he‚Äôs only two-ish months away and the difference in taxes will make up for any likely shifts in the market. However it is a Chinese company so I‚Äôd move 40% as soon as 1 year hits.

Ok got it buy more PLTR
"c" means call. so in this example of:

> PLTR 18 DEC 20 32 C

He is referencing a "call" option for Palantir (PLTR) with a strike price of $32, and an expiration date of December 18, 2020. If you own such a call option, if Palantir is at or above $32 on or before 12/18/2020, you can "exercise" that option to buy 100 Palantir shares at $32. So if Palantir is actually at $40 on/before 12/18/2020, for example, you can buy it at $32 and immediately sell at $40, making a guaranteed $8 dollar profit per share, minus the premium you paid when you bought the option.

On the other hand, if Palantir closes below $32 on 12/18/2020, your call option expires worthless and your wife will probably leave you.

Personally, fuck PLTR, marry SPY, kill TSLA.
We must make the boomers pay
Throw 250k into boomer blue chips and start playing with 50k again.
I took my February-September Robinhood statements, converted the PDFs to Excel, cleaned it up, and found:

-$10k principle,
-High: 16k (net +6k),
-Low: 2k (net -8k),
-Stocks: 387 buys, 278 sells (net +2.5k),
-Options: 176 buys, 133 sells (net -5.5k),
-Present: 7k (net -3k)

-Biggest Winners- CPRX, NIO, AA, ZTS, MRO stocks. SWBI, BABA, and FB calls,
-Biggest Losers- UCO, USO, HTZ stock. FSLY, SQ, AMD, TQQQ, NCLH, and SAVE calls.

Biggest fuck up was insisting on value stocks early on when everyone rode tech. Then finally got on board with tech right as things rotated back into industrial. Almost all of the options I purchased are majorly ITM now. Buying way less, way further out, would have made me a lot of money.

However, $3k for 8 months of entertainment and some good lessons isn‚Äôt terrible.
I got hit by a car a few years ago and woke up in the hospital. I have had healthcare for the past 8 years through the military.

On another occasion some crazy guy spilled a scalding hot coffee on me.

I totally recommend insurance.

I used to have none as well... I pulled my own tooth once.
Penny stocks? Ban
Please let me know if I‚Äôm reading this right:
A few weeks ago you ‚Äúbought to open‚Äù an OTM call. Shortly thereafter you ‚ÄúSold to Open‚Äù a further out of the money call. Today they both expired ITM with the call you bought being further in the money than the call you sold. I don‚Äôt use Robinhood, but to me this sounds like this trade should be in the green.

Were you intending to ‚ÄúSell to Close‚Äù your original option but screwed up?

Thank for for all the replies and info, really nice of you and appreciate it.
Sounds like you‚Äôve figured out the problem all by yourself
What if she‚Äôs an enigma machine though? Sus
How much did the calls cost in total?
I did this too but a little higher strike price. You keep the premium from selling if assigned. E.g. if you sold a $25 put for $300 credit you are effectively buying shares for $22 if it closes under $25.
Lmao it was trading at $1 last year and you think $30 is your guranteed support? During a pandemic the world has not experienced in a century? When food banks can't handle capacity and global leaders are fueling the wealth gap? I mean it's not like volume of the market is at all time low in FAANG and TSLA is literally the only stock propping the market up! And yeah man you're fine, Chinese company means chinese guranteed success or fraud whatever same difference. In March it was only down to $2 so you're totally in the clear, no bubbles ever burst and 2000% in less than a year is most definitely not a bubble haha right? 1.8mil and you can take out 1mil, pay heavy tax and live a comfortable life with 800k kept as fun money in nio and if it goes up more you only benefit, if it drops you still have 500K  from earlier pull and post taxes. But that'd be dumb man just keep it and use hope to cash those gains in two years.

Wasn't talking about point to point, or the future hypersonic vehicle that VG is advertising, but hey that will be pretty badass if either company can pull it off. There will be a lot of technical and regulatory hurdles to jump through (how close to Sydney will they be allowed to land? How prohibitive might the costs be for all the infrastructure needed to service, maintain and fuel the vehicles once they land? etc) but betting against Elon generally doesn't pan out so well. 

Again though, starship's possible future cargo flights doesn't negate VG's potential customer base. 

Also, VG flies passages from New Mexico now. More SS2s are being built in Mojave to build up a fleet. In the future, you can imagine more facilities throughout the world where SS2s can take off from. Italy has expressed interest in one even. https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17541834/virgin-galactic-space-tourism-italy-altec-siteal-vss-unity-grottaglie-spaceport

I believe it's PLTR (stock ticker symbol) 18 (the day) Dec (the month) 20 (year) 32 (the strike price, since it's a call.. They believe the price of PLTR is going to go to at least 32 or higher) C (for a call)

Ever tried debit spreads? Refocuses the option play on guessing the right direction when the premiums are high.
I don't get it. They were in bad shape almost a year ago. Could we be witnessing the last breath of life before this stock falls flat? I see what's going on as a perfect storm of hype. I could be wrong; I know it might be a good play short term for maybe the next few weeks or even months. What are the biggest warning signs for you?
I‚Äôm going to be completely honest: I hate when the main topic of discussion is stocks like PLTR, GME, AXPT (whatever it is), etc. because in playing those stocks, it‚Äôs just pure dumb luck. Like, we can‚Äôt even begin to guess what key levels are or whether a dip is a good dip or if the stock has gone up too much.


With the classic AAPL, AMZN, AMD, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, we know of key levels from past months and earnings reports and what makes sense and what doesn‚Äôt (TSLA less so, but even that makes more sense than PLTR). Also, we understand how macroeconomic indicators affect them. I miss when the daily craze in WSB was what AMD or AMZN was gonna do next.

Are you telling me that‚Äôs RH specific and I could get it for 8 cents on TD? What the actual fuck?

You kick ass. Your post is incredibly helpful. Thank you and award given.

I have a wife and 4 kids, so no FDs for me. I'm learning options and interested in 6 month options or even LEAPS, since they will give me a longer time to gain value and sell the option back for profit. I try and find a growing stock at a dip and buy a call. I haven't really wrapped my head around the greeks yet, so I'm just hoping that the stock will increase enough in value to make theta, delta, gamma variables irrelevant. I think I just need some experience in order for the greeks to make more sense.

If I have 6 mo to allow a stock to gain in value, I've been tending to pick a strike price a couple notches OTM, since the premium is lower. Am I on the right track with that or even with my general approach?

I only have 2 options right now, and they are my first ones.

NIU 6/18 35c

COST 12/31 382.5c (breakeven price of 397.45, so I think I might actually get screwed on this one)
Fuck you
It‚Äôs crazy they haven‚Äôt been required to thus far. But on the real though, will those audits need to be conducted by PCAOB member CPA firms or some Chinese equivalent? Because if it‚Äôs the latter than it‚Äôs no better because they‚Äôll just bribe them for a clean opinion.

Also,BABA is audited by PWC ( a PCAOB registered American CPA firm) so even if the bill passes the house and senate and is signed into law, BABA will still remain listed since they already comply. This is more for the NIO‚Äôs and similar Chinese stocks.

Nio is audited by PWC zhong tian, a Chinese audit firm not registered with the PCAOB and not under American oversight.

hope my Pltr shares and thiccboi shares can make up for it
You can make whatever move. Sell or Hold. Either way you're gonna sell eventually because you're gonna be honed in on not losing your millions now. 

How I see it is this 

Sure, the market is fine and you can bet on "Nio Day" you'll get more.

I was like that with Cannabis . I owned good portion of CGC and Aphria ..crashed and fucking burned. I thought "hey America is gonna legalize weed, to the moon"  . 2019 was the worse for Cannabis and it went down. My shares went into the red. 


What if on Nio Day , it isn't what you expect ? This will be the same for other investors . 

What about COVID? Yes there is a vaccine but we are still in a pandemic. People's view can change if you show the right "news" . Sometimes it can turn everything wrong . 

I would play it smart and just sell enough to pay all your debts (taxes , housing , everything ). You can keep SOME shares but sell the fucking calls dude. Calls and Puts can make you super rich, of course, but it changes drastically and can twist your emotions and reasoning. 

You got 7 figures. Your future is literally here knocking dude. This is your opportunity to change your life now! Put that money in a high yielding savings account and just leave it there bruh. Let the interest do the work . You don't need the stock market anymore or just put it in a strong ETF that survived through recession stages of the market and just leave it there if you want . 


If you really want to do those crazy calls and hold onto Nuo and hope for billions or zillions to show your "clout" then I hope you do and we could be wrong . Eventually you HAVE to sell and you WILL. Emotions are high right now . Savor it but don't let it consume you. 

The market will have winners and losers but winners can often lose if they wrapped themselves into winning.

Do you guys think Peter Thiel planned for this to somewhat of a degree? Serious answers only. I mean after sitting for 17 years and then doing it NOW (even before the other companies planning to IPO), seems very specific and targeted. I just pray that the billion dollars worth of employee stock given out last quarter motivated their entire company to absolutely destroy Q4 sales projections. You‚Äôd be surprised what top end sales people can do when their commissions are basically uncapped (in this case, instead of $$$, they‚Äôre commissions is tied up in shares/pricing).

This time next year, PLTR will be over $75 a share.

I was just reading about it 2 days ago, If ur a margin account ( Robinhood instant or Gold), then u need 25k to freely day trade,if u don‚Äôt have 25k, then ur only allowed 3 day trades, if u day trade more than that, u may be marked as a pattern day trader, which can freeze ur account I guess 70days.. if U have cash account, u can day trade freely but u won‚Äôt have access to instant deposit or instant settlement [More info](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/pattern-day-trading/)

Starship is being investigated by the Air Force for point to point cargo delivery ‚Äì and on the longest routes it's cost competitive with airliners. SPCE can offer you a flight above the Mojave and back to the Mojave, Starship will enable suborbital flights from New York to Sydney. Virgin's one big shot is the fact that they'll come to market first.

He thinks everyone has an island tho.
Honestly just make it so it doesn‚Äôt include options priced at $0.01 unless their spread trades in penny increments. Those calls with $0.05 spreads showing movement from $0.01 can‚Äôt actually be bought for $0.01. It just is priced at $0.01 because volume was nonexistent prior to same day of trading, or because the spread is $0.00-$0.05, and price shows $0.01.

Also RH spreads are fucked too.

Overall nice work but I‚Äôd skip the penny options with $0.05 spreads to avoid this issue

No because i sold like 30 minutes into the day and then made 300% on weekly puts
Wow this is a retarded take.

You saw 'retailer selling merchandise that the demand is so extreme for they can literally not keep them on the shelves for more than a couple of minutes at a time' and saw that as a *bad* thing for business? This is their current cash cow, twice a decade they have been the *first* place people go to when looking for a console. That will keep them afloat while all of the things OP listed will spark confidence in the markets and cause stock prices to rise, triggering the squeeze.

People are shorting gamestop because their current business model isn't relevant, once people get the consoles they really have no reason to go back to the store, so they think that it will eventually inevitably plummet.

If they restructure from the top with a dude who became a billionair going head to head in an online dick swinging contest with Bezos. That will inspire confidence in investors, short sellers, not seeing this rather unlikely turn of events, will be completely fucked up the ass.

who actually has health insurance making less than $40k/year but still making far enough above the poverty level so you can't get free government handouts?

Nobody wants to pay over $1k/month so i can get that $20 co-pay if i want to go to the doctor twice in a calendar year when i'm only making $35-40k. If i just don't go outside nobody is going to hit me with a car or beat my ass and i can stay healthy and not broke. All i need to do is not get cancer

I don't ever throw good money after bad, I've seen wayyy to many guys throw 1k, 2k, or more.... or worse yet, the entire 686.75 or whatever their paycheck was... 100 at a time, every time they lost 100, just broke out another.   I LOVE gambling... but I'm able to be disciplined about it.

Stocktwits.

The whole game is a big rope a dope. They've got 75%+ inst ownership which is selling worthless options while the stock is slowly being algo to death.

The most recent earnings call they announce a 1b buyback as an incentive for retail to sit around and watch the bleed from the front row.

In retrospect none of it sits right. Instead of the fake buyback they could've as easily did a quarterly 75div and drove the stock through the roof. With 30% short, they'd cover 30% of the div payout, 75c per q x 75m shares is only 225m per year which is less than the 3 years of 1b buyback.

Imagine a 15% yearly dividend being advertised everywhere, the stock would've jumped to 40 in a week without the short squeeze.
I hope, got in at 264

Oh no, I do totally get how awesome and paradigm shifting a fleet of reusable starships will be. It's a different ballgame though. Tourism and joyrides are just not in Elon's plan, not the same way VG is trying to capture the market.

Milk first? I bet you face backwards on the toilet too!
Citron knocked NIO down a few pegs by randomly claiming (with no evidence) that the price should be a gazillion percent cheaper.

Rumors of them getting delisted, by the actual SEC? Imagine those toilet paper hands.

1.5 is rough to play with, anything you do is nearly a yolo

To get back to 30k you need a 20x return and that shit is HARD and has a 99% chance at failure even over the course of a year.

You either say fuck it and yolo that and when you lose it then you start saving up 10k and then make plays like I mentioned.

Trying to do what I said with 1.5k is going to take a long time to be worth it is all and you won't like the returns for months.

Good job OP, now cash out JFC why do you care so much about tax when you have 1.8 mil? Pay the credit cards that you have apperently maxed out and buy something other than Ramen. Live a little. This 1.8 is just virtual money. I had 11k in my RH yesterday now I have $10,500 today. That stuff can evaporate especially when you are dependent on the long term success of NIO... NIO isn't a stable blue chip it is a meme stock meant to be pumped and dumped. Don't fuck this up...

i had the order open, ready to send it at market open after i did the numbers and talked some shit thinking it really seemed like easy money with 25% upswing movement of leeway to break even, but i ended up pussying out

Yo... I learned options trading by sitting for the series seven. After sitting for the exam I opened a paper trading account and began to play with it. But only in like increments of like 5k at a time, my goal was to treat fake money as it were mine. I did this off and on for about a year and half while still understanding the basics. Then I finally started an options account and wrote some covered calls to get comfortable with and help build my account up, all while investing into SPY and QQQ. I finally started to buy calls 2-3 months out and even began to ‚Äúroll up‚Äù. All in all it took me a good two-three years before I was really worth my salt. And now I have been trading off and on for some 10 years now. It‚Äôs great way to make phenomenal money, but it takes time. 

Ultimately you don‚Äôt have to sit for the series 7 to trade options. A great place my just be leaning the fundamental from various book, and there is no shame for ‚ÄúThe Dummies...‚Äù series. After reading that book you would know more than 95% of the people that post on here now.

It's kinda funny how it changes. Summer was like constant hype and TSLA pumping. Then September hit and it was doom and gloom. In October this place was quiet as fuck (assuming people got wiped) and bears were more vocal. Then the election/vaccine pumps rolled through, wiped out the bears and gave birth to a new generation of tards and autists.

And will it go through when the market opens? I‚Äôve bought calls before open and there have a few times and it wouldn‚Äôt go through. Bought 113 shares
From one of the article: 

‚ÄúOne of Palantir‚Äôs product demonstrations, as described in Bloomberg Businessweek‚Äôs 2011 article, presents a fictional example of the software‚Äôs capabilities: A terrorist leaves a trail of data across Florida, including one-way plane tickets, condo rentals, bank withdrawals, phone calls to Syria, and security camera footage from Walt Disney World. Taken separately, these details don‚Äôt add up to much, but Palantir‚Äôs software ties together thousands of databases across various agencies and helps clients see connections across them. In this case, actions that are innocuous on their own are much more suspicious when combined, and the CIA could identify and stop a terrorist‚Äôs plan to attack a theme park.‚Äù
Problem is if the stock doesn‚Äôt move quickly you suck. Is the issue cost? So you can buy more?

952k is a pretty good amount and is practically 1 mil too so yeah maybe, esp if things looked a lil more hairy. Still life changing money right there.

Even after tax that amount could easily be turned into 1 mil+ in safer stock picks or ETF/Index funds or provide good income streams in safer dividend stocks. Don't even need to play options at that point to make good money from your capital and early retirement is still pretty guaranteed.
In case any autists can't read between the lines: a client of PLTR.
I'm creating call spreads right above the money to gain more contracts for less cash. I'm doing this in underlying stocks I'm bullish on, obviously (I just listen to what you retards tell me to do and make money, I don't ask questions.)

So in the Porsche case, they were acting like a hedge fund for a while buying up VW shares and then surprising everyone with the acquisition over the weekend.  (I think, might have paraphrased wrong)

In the KBIO case, Martin Shkreli is a fraudster who corners the market on shares and then announces some faux good news for the company, that was probably a bluff.

Do these unique circumstances matter?  Will a positive earnings release be enough to trigger the same reaction?

Why is GME so shorted to begin with?  They had 1.6b in cash last quarter and positive free cash flow. 

This all seems super compelling.  I'm trying to understand why this hasn't happened more often.  What's the catch here?

It doesn‚Äôt matter if GME is going to crush earnings. What matters is GME executive‚Äôs response to Cohen‚Äôs plan on earnings. 

Option 1. Either they listen to him and GME begins their restructuring path and GME shoots up like crazy, forcing shorts to squeeze

Option 2. GME doesn‚Äôt listen to Cohen and he forces a shares recall, causing shorts to squeeze instantly

Cheers. Yes, your ability to sell the option depends on whether someone is buying...if no one is buying, you may have to lower your ask price in order to avoid holding it at expiration.

One approach is to aim to nail down free rolls.

A free roll meaning you are playing with house money.

The goal is to either buy 2+ year out LEAPS or just shares of the target company and then once that is done you ignore it and move on to the next hot thing.

So for PLTR I did moves and hit scores when it was at 15-16ish and then took half the profits and moved into some 60 day calls and then risked the rest on shorter term ones. 

Once those hit by $18 I pulled the trigger and moved 70% of the winnings into $10 PLTR Jan 2023s

Now those positions are just pure profit and its house money and I ignore them.

I did the same with NIO as well and now I have chunks in that and its house money and I ignore it.

You said you had points where you were winning and up. That is when you take half of the profit and push it into boring ass long term plays.

After months and months of this it starts to add up and you can even start to farm covered calls on older more stable stock positions to juice the gains on a weekly basis from those as well. The risk with the CC is you may get assigned, but if you like the stock still then buy the calls back and roll out another week (its only happened once to me so far and it was worth it).

There are soooo many ways to play this market, you will have to decide for yourself. Hell you can do great with just doing pure stock plays despite the shit that gets around here.

Note: sometimes you may need to follow up with some smaller daily scores on a stock to fully clear the cost of a longer term position and make it a true free roll, the good thing about these smaller daily score is you don't need to make 5x you can should for 30%....continued

2. The only other stock ideas are in the 5k post daily thread.
3. The tips from those obscure post are already up 100% in the past 2 weeks.
4. Find my own stocks. Once a stock is publicized, it's a bear trap waiting to happen, especially when retards are ready to pounce.

FFS I‚Äôm ecstatic with a 20% gain for the month and I don‚Äôt try to manipulate the market to make money, I just try to pick successful companies with bright futures.

Speculation? $BABA, the Chinese $AMZN, is already using $STMP‚Äôs wholly owned subsidiary, but we‚Äôre splitting hairs. Will $STMP or won‚Äôt $STMP be consistently profitable? Sure it will. You‚Äôre taking issue with the speed and size of profitability. And consistent profitability = increased BVPS = increased share price. Will $STMP post COVID profits be less than CoVID era profits? Very well might. But they will still be growing, expanding, profiting, and increasing market share. However I‚Äôm telling you, and you truly know it, well above $200 by next ER.

OPs gains made me think ‚Äúhmmm... maybe I should look to this sub for investment advice‚Äù. Thankfully seeing your comment seconds later has made me realise how erroneous that line of thinking was.

Do you know why GRVY has dipped so hard a few times the past previous years? I agree that it can 10x but I feel like gaming companies can easily flip flop since they need to consistently do well with every game they come out and keep its userbase alive for a long time with which is hard

Zynga has fallen from grace, Blizzard keeps fucking up their new games, and Riot Games is still unproven so I feel like gaming companies are really risky
Mad helpful. I'm bookmarking this and will print later. Thank you for taking the time to do this - I've been interested in exploring options, but have been hesitant to do so because I don't know how they work and I have very little capital to work with (not if I sold my PLTR, but that's not happening).

/r/options is the best source, the closest "math" there is is probably links like this: https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/ but basically it's just speculation about what people **think** will happen versus what **actually** happens.
Hmm, we‚Äôll see about that.
Buy shares and January/April calls. The squeeze is inevitable; it‚Äôs been steadily going up, they have earnings coming up which they will likely crush, and they still have like a 140% short interest.

No you don‚Äôt, no one knows, don‚Äôt you get it??? So you have done this before? Made millions on other stocks as well? You can totally do this again right? You just have other winning picks too, right? You found an opportunity that few others did but you did it when the stock market is at an all time high. Why didn‚Äôt you do it in 2017, 2018 or 2019? Because you got lucky but of course it wasn‚Äôt all luck, but luck that it is currently worth millions instead of thousands. 

It looks like you are reading all the comments, even replying to comments like mine so hopefully that means you are self aware enough. 

I am NOT saying you are wrong and doomed but just wanted to try my best to make sure you are seeing everything, again good luck and hopefully it‚Äôs $10M when you sell.

Your argument is basically the same as "Why pay to go to an amusement park when you can get a Ferrari and go 200mph on the Autobahn?" 
Lower cost, higher volume, and both markets can exist simultaneously. Ferraris aren't putting roller coasters out of business.
That‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs a sale. But if it‚Äôs a legit short, like there are actually research behind it I‚Äôm all for it. When it‚Äôs just some guy shorting a high flying stock with no research whatsoever, fuck him.  Look at all the stocks he shorted, it‚Äôs not like Hindenburg shorting nikola, they actually did the research.
yes, i've seen it often, usually within a few cents though - nothing crazy. I've sold deep ITM for less than intrinsic value to get my capital out and redeploy in better ways.
This is great, thank you. So the further otm my strike price is the less likely ill make money, essentially. Also, lets say i get in the green with theta left, can i sell my contracts and if so, are there times where you cant sell bc noones buyin?

The success of international expansion is speculation, cant really say its undervalued because of that. Under Armour said they'd push for international expansion 1 or 2 years ago, hasn't done the stock any favors. The trade you are suggesting is basically a bet on the company being a success abroad.
You‚Äôre goated

Yeah I‚Äôve hit 30-70% gains pretty consistently on those trades using 5% OTM calls expiring about a month or two out
FCEL OTM covered calls.  It‚Äôs been pretty solid to wheel the last month.  Low cost of entry, can pick up consistent 150-200 on the CCs, set ask to 20-30% above basis.  Sell puts if it looks like you‚Äôll get assigned.  It‚Äôs been my income play while I wait for my YOLOs to pay out.

Also PLTR has been pumping for the first 10-15 minutes every morning for the last 2 weeks.  If you time it right you can jump in and out to scalp some tendies.

See this kind of line of thinking is dangerous. You seem to think you‚Äôve did some big brain analysis and that your gains are warranted. My man, you rode the stock during a highly speculative EV market fueled by rampant retail trading. Don‚Äôt kid yourself. Not saying Nio won‚Äôt ever be an amazing investment, but don‚Äôt forget Amazon also went to shit after the tech bubble popped in the early 2000s.

Isn't short selling a good thing for efficient pricing the market?

E.g. those that bought Tesla when it was shorted two Years ago were highly rewarded (10x return) if they didn't sell.
Not true. You can trade as much as you want using settled funds in a cash account, no account limit.
This allows me to day trade right?
i'm been very consistent for the previous month buying stocks with high premiums in the price range of $12-$24. I sell covered calls and collect the premium. roll out weeklies monthlies when the premium has 90% evaporated. if you look at my small account you'll see a small steady rise 9 out of 10 days. 

what I've seen thus far is stocks with high option premiums have a tendency to rise in price.
Wait.  Doesn't that describe since the fucking stone age?  But I guess now to a world wide audience.
Buy more calls. Shitron is trying to manipulate prices. No such thing as bad marketing.
So in other words Vietnam?
Username checks out
doesnt changing your account to cash make it so you can day trade but all your transactions take 2 days to settle?
This gain is from my 30C 1/15/21 PLTR calls. Bought in at 300$ per contract.
It's gonna go up or down. I'm gonna bet the down because that's the way stocks go. Only if you own them though. I'd recommend 2 accounts. One to buy low, and when it dips, buy high. A recommendation from a comment on wall street bets. I trust that man with my life.

Bro, share price and market cap are two different things. There are companies where a share price is 4,000 and they don't have a 20 billion dollar market cap. It can easily hit 1,600 share.
You buy when it drops below 0.70?
And virtually everyone is waiting for NIO day. It‚Äôs going to tank the day of. TSLA stock split, every AAPL event, etc.

Because its like 2k
When combined with foreign expansion and consistent revenue growth can only drive the price higher. I believe what you speak of is very recently priced in. Mark my words. $STMP will be well above $200 by next ER. No doubt about that!

YeH mate the other guy said it if you‚Äôre worried about the losses to PLTR today you definitely deserve them, not only because you‚Äôre dumb and investing money for no reason, but because you‚Äôll learn from the mistakes.

Only problem is PLTR will rise a lot again, so they‚Äôll probably become ‚ÄúMY STOCKS WILL JUST GO UP again SOON‚Äù crew.

It's scalping, anything that moves decently during the day will work. I think there's a guy on here who only scalps Apple. Might've been swing trading as well, I don't remember. TSLA options could work as well.

Well you would seriously benefit if you were assigned between the strike and the break even price. But it would be hard to believe that you would be assigned considering that the shares would be cheaper on the market than buying your 100 shares for the strike and paying a premium to do it. But I guess if you‚Äôre going to pay the premium anyway might as well exercise the damn thing .... though there‚Äôs no need to. Personally if I held the call I would rather purchase the shares and sell it.

A lot of it is just smart people here being troll-like for fun. Really what I'd suggest is watching WSB for the general sentiment of a stock, and cross checking with your own research - like with news articles, basic technical and fundamental analysis... I'd definitely look into japanese candlestick patterns too. But don't tell the SEC I gave you advice, because this isn't advice. 

For fun, I'd look up 4chan lingo too. It seems a lot of people talk that way here. I still don't get it, but it's still fun to post and watch here. They're not as bad as they seem!

So, broadcomm always drops on acquisition news because it hurts there short term. In 2018 broadcomm bought... Something and their stock dropped to $200 and now they're doing very well. If I remember correctly, it's a slow, steady rise up to make sure the acquisition is integrated correctly. I wouldn't buy calls, unless their really cheap and triple what the stock is worth now..... Just kidding, buy cheap in the money calls for 3 years from now if they're cheap and you'll do well for the next 6 months to a year... My advice to someone. I'm a stocks guy... Not wsb guy...

This is from Investopedia about B/V and intangible assets:

‚ÄúIntangible Assets
Also, book value ignores intangible assets such as a company's brand name, goodwill, patents, and other intellectual property. Book value does not carry much meaning for service-based firms with few tangible assets. For example, the bulk of Microsoft's asset value is determined by its intellectual property rather than its physical property. As a result, Microsoft's share value bears little relation to its book value.‚Äù

Newbie options question, don't kill me pls! What's the different between having the 310 call options or having the 17,000 shares? If you bought the 17,000 shares for say $40, wouldn't that be the same as buying an equivalent amount of 40c or 45c? Or is that not how it works? Wouldn't just holding the shares for $40 be the same as exercising the shares for $40 if they're an equivalent amount? Also congrats on the gains!
Please ban
I think its because these retards (me included) yolo all of their shit into calls and when this shit dips we potentially lose every penny.

Personally, I'm holding strong and firmly believe that PLTR will fuck gay bears in the pussy, ass and mouth, and every other orifice imagineable come monday, and I think everyone here does too, but its just fun to make memes about losing everything.

So GRVY to 1000$. Even WSB believes in some type of reality.
why do we think that all our thoughts and actions are ours and not a part of a dialogue with those two things that are battling it out, or at least pretending to be two things battling it out, by using us, humans and animals and things, as pawns who are imprisoned in time, those things communicating with us 24/7 using all of our individual thoughts and intentions, paralleling them as a multiloge of thoughts and actions in our individual and collective minds and bodies thereby connecting us on many planes, one of which we call ‚Äútelepathy‚Äù, those two things that script our lives or at least make them appear scripted, those things that have been called good and evil throughout time, god and the devil, angels and demons, light and darkness, love and hate, knowledge and ignorance, good aliens and bad aliens, etc, those things are not who we humans are, we are not equal to them because we‚Äôre limited by time and our physical life form while they are not, so humans who are aware of this phenomenon have to look out for each other against these outside forces, at least the evil ones, instead of working with them against each other by hating and doing evil, we have to help the good side take over so that .. it‚Äôs all good, we have to help each other, which is why i‚Äôm here to tell you to get leaps on pltr

That 30k is a lesson is all.

Will you be smart enough to figure out what it is telling you? (You like to gamble and can't or refuse to do any risk mitigation. Most likely you barely have a plan when you enter a position.)

30k is expensive but its time to grow up and put in the hard work and stop putting yourself in position to lose too much.

Restraint, planning, executing a strategy, then you win. Or keep doing what you are doing and you might make 30k this month or lose it all.

3. you make sick stock plays and turn 1000 to 0, post your losses here, we all give you high fives, and you start saving from 0 again

If an option expires between the strike and the breakeven, doesn't it still get called away? Even if they aren't making money because it's under the breakeven, don't you still lose your shares? Or does it only ever exercise as long as the breakeven is reached?

You buy ITM money options to gain leverage but with little risk. It will still retain some value, but will give you less return. The 230 call is in retard words less likely to occur so it will give you a greater return if you‚Äôre right, but if you‚Äôre wrong you lose everything.

Also, go to r/stocks or r/investing don‚Äôt post this shit here
Wow, I really appreciate this detailed and well thought-out response, especially regarding retail vs institutional short coverage.

I think the way I'm seeing it now is as a good long-term investment with the added possibility of a short squeeze.

My only concern is them not pivoting effectively to e-commerce, but I guess we'll get more of their intention in the next few weeks. If they do effectively pivot, they really could make a killing.

Thanks man. Yea I have about 1k per month of disposable income right now, so I could build up some money slowly.
I donate mine to the IRS.
first, thanks for this info! very informative.

so how would i go about closing a spread like this prior to expiration? is it as simple as buying back the sold call to close it and then selling to close the bought call? if i wanted to switch to a more bullish strategy, i.e. if the underlying overshot my price target and the sold call was approaching ITM, i could buy it back to close it out and then let the bought call run until i was ready to exercise or sell it for a profit?
oh fuk!

Last month? Are you fucking retarded? It was two days ago.
If a call gives you the right to buy 100 shares at that price, why wouldnt i just buy those 100 shares? 

Like why ever buy an OTM call. I could just buy at the current price instead of risking money to maybe the the option to buy the shares at a higher price

Sure if you (retail) make the mistake of selling it below intrinsic and no MM price improves it.  A MM won't make that mistake, so you can't buy an option below intrinsic from them.  They'll quote the bid-offer in a way so if you do buy from them, the offer will be more than the intrinsic.

Also just wanted to add... Do you know what a balance sheet is and how to read it? Do you know how a share price works? Etc... We have been in a market for 10+ years now where those things haven‚Äôt mattered, basically since the last real estate and stock market crash. It‚Äôs been heavily inflated due to people being forced to invest due to 0% return in savings accounts amongst other things. This market cannot continue like this. We are getting all time highs when businesses are going bankrupt. You have figured out how to win in this market but will it be the same market in a year or two, or 10? 

I definitely admire you sticking to your plan but I would strongly considering selling a portion that you are ok with. Like $100k to pay off debt and have 1 year of living expenses, etc. Like I mentioned before I am 36 and my wife is 33, we quit our jobs a few years ago and never have to work again. We spend every day with our kids and doing whatever we want really but our income is low, like $80k/year combined so we can‚Äôt spend money recklessly. We have a $100k car and a $2.5M house and you now have a net worth close to ours. 

Of course I will quote Buffett. 

"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."

Everyone WAS fearful, now everyone is greedy.

This is your wake up call to move to an actual real brokerage with a support line you can call.

Are you going to move next week?
This actually isn‚Äôt true. At the level GME is shorted, the squeeze would likely play out over at least a full week, depending on volume.
Yea that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been keeping me from hopping into PLTR this past week or two. And then it keeps having 15%+ days and I get major FOMO. The funny thing is I had January $12.50 PLTR calls back when it was $10 a share and I sold those for a quick profit. Imagine if I held smh

Then you should be winning big right now. You have premature ejacuation, hold until you win big. If shit is going up massively, there is usually a reason such as fraud or a downgrade for it to drop.
Came across something interesting. Was looking at option chains on boomer stocks since I figured theyd be a cheap place to buy LEAPs. The price of ATM puts was almost double the price of ATM calls. I checked out a few stocks and it was all the same; backs, energy, telcos. The market is apparently predicting some serious pullback.

Oh I see yea I guess hopefully you get lucky with one of those short term plays.  For some reason, I just assumed you had other income coming in to buy shares/reload, but maybe that was a bad assumption since I know you said you used that for other things like bills.  Good luck man, you can still turn a few grand into like 20k with the right plays.  I honestly wouldn't do PLTR but I know most of this sub loves it.  IV I think is too high.

Great start.  Way ahead of the curve.  Stay smart and avoid the FOMO on here.
Decay is terrible but I do think at current levels it‚Äôs signifying investor overconfidence vs. just decayed. It‚Äôs at pre rona levels rn. To me that‚Äôs ridiculous considering we‚Äôre nowhere near out of the woods yet. Eventually we‚Äôll realize that. 

I had the choice to cut my losses or average down. And chose to average down. I guess I‚Äôll find out soon enough!
It‚Äôs definitely good advice, but I don‚Äôt have a large sum available to me anymore, just a couple grand left. Can‚Äôt imagine making much off of shares with that amount.

It's also Saturday morning if anything, so idk wtf is going rn.
If you put like half of that (or if you have additional money) into like shares of good companies (preferably tech or really good non-tech ones like NKE), you'll have a good stable part of income.  The rest you can gamble with.  Maybe this isn't the best advice for this forum, but it's a good advice just in general if you want to do any type of trading long-term.

For example, if you put like say 10k of that into TSLA shares in March, that would be 70k.  Tesla shares have 7x from March and there's no theta decay.  Ok that won't happen next year, but even if it does like 1.5x (say some stock), that's not bad.
Unfortunately I'm too stupid to bother will options or else I'd already be homeless.

One thing is for certain, do not visit the ST website. Those comments start to convince your intuition that it's wrong after a while!

Hey guys I think I did something really dumb and just finally figured it out after an hr, feel horrible. Can someone confirm that below is what happened to me and how stupid I am?

Bought 15$ 101 11/27 call (sometime a few weeks ago)

Sold 15.50$ 101 11/27 call ( a little after buying the 15$ call, made about 500$ give or take ) 

Now they expired today on robinhood both obviously in the money. I believe what I did was a call credit spread after researching and since I sold the 15.50 call a couple weeks ago when gme was only like 13$ I got totally screwed since it ran up so much and expired way in the money? Now robinhood says I owe over 8k, is this accurate or could I somehow be in a better position and robinhood has it screwed up. I just didnt realize I had that much risk originally when I sold the calls since i didnt even have 8k in buying power to lose when I sold the calls so I dont k ow why they would let me do that. Any help would be appreciated.
lol
Where do you think the price would fall back to from the top of the squeeze?
Hell yeah!

Exactly. You saw with AirBNB - all of these private tech giants are too snobby to ever go public via a SPAC. It would ‚Äútaint‚Äù their legacy - both for the VC investors and the founders. To be known forever as the tech giant that went public not via an IPO. The comparison will be to Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc. - did any of them go public via SPAC? Did Snowflake go public via SPAC? No. Then there is no way Stripe, one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2021, goes public via SPAC.

I‚Äôm down around 30k since starting on this sub back in March. There‚Äôs been moments I‚Äôve been up 20-30k just to lose it all and more.

The 30k I‚Äôve lost isn‚Äôt money I absolutely needed, I‚Äôm still fortunate to have a good job and the ability to pay my bills and enjoy life. But damn I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt hurt thinking about what I could be doing with that money.

I‚Äôve considered stopping but something makes me keep wanting to do this, I guess you could say I‚Äôm addicted. I just want to make money, buy nice things, maybe retire early. It feels amazing when you make a good play and make 50% or more in a single day.

I guess I just don‚Äôt know where to go. Do I hop on these meme stocks everyone is spamming in the daily threads? Trade SPY volatility? Idk anymore man

Religion, when I met her she basically didn't care about religion at all and it stayed that way for most of our relationship. Then she reconnected with her super religions dad and I guess he brainwashed her so she got ULTRA religious. Her whole personality changed and she basically became a different person. It's like religion and her culture took over her entire life. It got to the point where I'd only see her once a week (if even that) because spending all her free time with members of her newly reconnected religion was more important than me. I think all these people wanted her with someone from the same religion and they knew I didn't care about and would never convert to their religion.

How the heck can GME have institutions owning more than 100% of the stock?     
I just checked this on yahoo:    
 % Held by Institutions	130.96%
Yeah too bad pace only has an eye for defensive players (Mack, roquan smith) (although Patterson is a stud and could be compared to the great devin Hester although no one wil ever come close to what he wasd). That being said, while pace is not what this team needs, at least we aren‚Äôt the fucking lions lmao

Gains don't make me happy anymore. The longer you trade the more you realize it's just monopoly money that can just as easily dissappear again.

If you are young, now what you consider rich might not be when you are older and figure out just how much you need to retire comfortably.  500k looks a lot better at 20 than it does 65.  Still its a ton easier to accumulate wealth after 35 so early in life keep debt to a minimum and pay it off and learn to live with in your means and the money will come.

GME to $20 next week who says no?
Someone I‚Äôve been talkin to lately (also happens to be unemployed) just told me they don‚Äôt see us having a ‚Äòdeeper connection.‚Äô Like damn, I guess this is what I get for buying PLTR puts.
good math retard
no options for GRVY, so i bought GME instead
ELIA5: What did you do exactly? I'm new to calls and puts. Couldn't you have just bought 54k dollars worth of NIO stock on December 4th and be at the same place now? Or no?

Get a good quality firm (important!) mattress dude. Also a large (depth) latex pillow. People underestimate how important a good pillow is ‚Äî the bigger your shoulders are the bigger a pillow should be. The goal is to fill the void between neck and shoulders so your neck is basically straight when lying down.

I like Dunlopillow‚Äôs latex ones. Sleeping anywhere else now makes me die cause it‚Äôs so shit compared to my own.

Mattress should set you back about $1-2k, but you literally spend nearly half you life on that shit!!

The sellers don't lose because they own the underlying stock. If it goes up then they just hit a max profit and give up gains. They lose when they're holding the shares and the shares dump more than the premium they collected can offset.

I just sold my RKT shares at a 60k loss today, there's no need to tell me about options sellers. Sellers hope for no movement and the buyers hope for the moon. In good ole rkt, the institutions bastardized that stock to the point that the 1b buyback became meaningless.

Dumb me, used to think high institutional ownership was a good thing. 75%+ within 6 months of an IPO, no bueno.

The postings of blackrock that I saw today, taking a huge chunk of PLTR, were a bit offsetting if they were real.

I recently sold GME.

I got put off by a few things. 

I read about their outdated business model, and who they're competing with (too many big boys like Amazon, digital sales, Walmart etc).

I also read they are stubborn and have been slow to adapt.

My play was to buy for the consoles then sell as that pattern was established for each new gen but it drops pretty quickly after. 

$500 is the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard.

Don't fool yourself. Without the pandemic causing a surge in gaming they would be dead in the water. Selling TV's is not a profitable business either. I've sold electronics for 20 years, between freight and damages you barely crack a profit. You want to pump and create a short squeeze that's fine but don't make them sound like they could potentially be the next Amazon...

This is a company you hold shares for 10 years and sell one a month to pay the mortgage.
No. Even the president pumps SPY all the time
Gratz you sick fuck.  Now that that meme stock people won't STFU about is tracking you for the CIA.
IV on the year chart is getting really high. It has maybe one more pump before a pullback, then buy in. It's going higher though.
I‚Äôve unfortunately seen that fileted chest video. Also beheadings and a bunch of other crazy cartel videos. They don‚Äôt play the fuck around when sending a message
Yea the deal overall is hard to make.  I think you did the best you could.  It's a weird situation because the payouts are like 4x$500 each (so 4 winners), rather than your standard pay jump, but I think you did the best you could.  I personally would just play it out though if I'm confident.
Every time you buy a call odds are the seller of that call buys 100 shares of the company to hedge themselves to delta neutral. They could also do a spread to sell you the call or sell naked, but most call selling is covered calls and the person selling just wants the premium and doesn't worry much about the price of the underlying.

At some point they will care about the price of the underlying though.

If the stock is $10 that means to cover one contract they have to buy $1,000 of stock to hedge the call they're selling. Now PLTR is closer to $30 and it costs 3x what it used to cost to hedge the contract.

The sellers are gonna stop because the downside risk is so much more.
my indian friend agrees with you but that sauce is way too sweet for french fries and i like sweet stuff considering i drink at least 2 liters of dr pepper every day
Thanks
yea, set a limit sell at a high price to gaurentee you get in.

Yea, of course theres a chance a squeeze wouldnt happen, though I think its unlikely. I am not worried because either way I forsee long term growth with gamestop
You may be up huge in general but unlike you, in the biggest bull market in history, I have yet to see a + in my account.

I'm calling the condition- FOMM - fear of making money.

there's no such thing as naked calls for buying, that's when you sell calls, selling calls can be naked or covered. buying calls is buying calls.
It's not even fucking close.

Even at over 100% short it's not even close to the same ballpark.

I‚Äôve shares in PLTR, that‚Äôs enough shares for me they are hella boring
"People dont realize that you can just buy more OTM contracts and get a higher %gain total if the underlying moons"

thanks genius üëç
i feel nio will be over 80 by then, so it will 4x your money, but there is risk nonetheless, so i wouldn't go all in on that, maybe mix in some pure 2023 LEAPS with no spread; and maybe some shares too? depends on your risk tolerance. but the 50/80 spreads have a high chance of success but capped at 300% gains.

If I was the 70k guy, that's a sweet deal.  Because he \*could\* only win $500 max previously (since you said it was 4x$500 tickets), and he had no risk here and just won $500 regardless.  That's a true arb.  Basically he got the full payout with now no real risk.  Sure he most likely isn't the 5th place bust being the chip leader with 5 to go, but now you made his chances guaranteed to get the $500.

It's really hard to make this deal fair for everyone since the payouts are like 4x$500, $200 rather than your standard pay jumps.  It's not a bad deal you proposed, but it's just weird to make a deal in a satellite where there are "4 winners."  I usually would just play this out since $200 vs. $500 is a small amount.
In 5 minutes?

You in some trouble, my guy?
I'm pretty new but I'm doing this very simplified version of the wheel and it's working (I think probably in a very sub-optimized level). Steps:

* Find a stock I wouldn't mind owning, like TSLA, TSM, XPEV. PLTR, etc.

* Then buy a put OTM at around 70-80% chance of profit. Usually a week out.

* If the option earns a profit of over 70% before end of period, I close it and take the profit. 

* If option gets exercised, I now own 100 shares of a stock I wanted anyway. Now I flip over to the Sell Covered Call side and repeat -- selling at 70% chance of profit.

I like this scheme because:

* I'm getting about 20-40% annualized rate of return.
* While I try to pick good stocks, there's no stress if stock price goes up or down. I make money on both sides of the option.

Problems:

* If instead of playing options like this, I just invested straight up in these stocks, I might be making more money and getting better tax treatment (long term capital gains).

* Maybe this method only works during boom times like these -- where my favorite kind of stocks (high growth tech, internet, 5G and EV) are almost always going up. It might not work in other market conditions.

Wonder how many people do this and if this is sustainable or dumb.

Any of you nerds into poker deal making?

Was in a $50 buy in satellite tournament for a bigger tournament with $500 buy in, 44 total buy ins made the pot $2200. That means that we award the top 4 players a $500 ticket and the 5th place player a $200 credit.

When we got to 5 players left the blinds were about 700/350 ante 50, I was in second with ~40k in chips, the leader had ~75k, third and fourth were just behind me with slightly under ~40k, and the short stack was still pretty deep with ~30k chips behind. 

After some negotiation I brokered the following deal:

70k chips gets $500
40k chips (x3) get $430
30k chips gets $410

Reasonable deal?
Yes

naw your missing the point a natural dip is one thing this was literally created. THAT is what has people riled up.
I bought 1/15/21 calls whenever apple split, it went down a bunch and than I lost the rest of my money on random shitty trades
3000% unlikely but this sub can make it happen. Full disclosure: owner of 50 shares that is praying this happens
Algo trading should be banned via executive order

Hedge funds should be prevented from controlling more than 100b in assets to stop collusion

when it went to $1 I was already willing to go down with the ship, actually wanted to buy more but was cash strapped at the time. with no kids or a wife to worry about yet im a huge risk taker
I got some 17c for next Friday. I bought 10 15c on Wednesday. They doubled and I sold half. Then sold the rest today. But this is almost all from Tesla. Had 550 12/24 call. Rolled it out to Feb 650 call today.
you made 2 mil in a year and you aren't gona sell when the market is clearly in a bubble? you deserve to lose it all

You just need about 1000x the current open interest
Idk if its the right time, but definitely the right place.

Ask a bunch of retarded strangers on the internet for investment advice.

You'll be just fine.
The best advice Is to do your own research. Don‚Äôt be a lazy fuck and listen to brain dead broke degenerates on here. Rub those two brain cells together and make a decision on your own

But now I read that as Santa. Dyslexia can be beneficial
The VW one doesn't seem to be comparable as Porsche was literally holding over 70% and the other one holding 20.1%. Institutions only account for like 12% of GME so I don't know if it will pump even as hard as that. Not saying it can't happen but seems like that is a big variable
i don't know if I can or can't, I did on the Robinhood Web

I admit I have limited knowledge of the business. I have only been inside a gamestop once or twice. What is the cash cow at this point? Are people still buying physical games? I see the hype for the new consoles, but there don't seem to be enough consoles available for sale.  Lots of people complaining about not being able to buy the new devices. Good news for msft, but how does that help gme?
Rip
So this move requires a huge group of people to trigger it am I comprehending?
It‚Äôs impossible to time a short squeeze.  Options would yield greater returns but you might also get zilch.  Buy shares, set a sell limit for whatever you want to take profit at, forget about it.

Though it‚Äôs probably smarter to set 1 share sell limits all the way up so you can Get notifications and assess the situation and decide where you want to exit.
Easy there tiger

PLTR is the answer to the question, "What would happen if a bunch of lemmings decided to follow each other over a cliff while speculating in the stock market?"
There are so many reasons, but mainly, we are going to report possibly the best quarter in gmes history in March. Its going to be a blowout after years of trash. A blowout after bottom of the barrel expectations.

You mentioned you've been following me so I'm assuming you know about the e-commerce and other major factors. All of these have been leading to the stock steadily drifting higher over time. Retail shorts are getting squeezed already, but the funds will start getting squeezed somewhat by 20 most likely. They won't have their positions closed the way retail does, but their risk depts will force them to start closing some of the position at some point.

The board also has to respond to cohens letter, which means laying out their strat plan and how its going. That can't be anything bullish. I also think their response to him calling them out for allowing shorts to hold on is buybacks and I think there is a strong chance they happened Thursday before last.

A year ago very little was going on and it still looked super ugly. Now shorts are having to work constantly with multiple short raids a day to hold the price down as low as it is, but its less and less effective as people eagerly snap up the dips.

Short squeeze is never guaranteed, but this is the one close enough to guaranteed as is possible to be. Also, exhausted right now so if anything I said sounded weird/nonsensical let me know lol

imma buy with cash cuz i dont like having bills every month, plus you can make seller sell you for less when you offer cash because you can close on the deal faster
Alright I'm going in on $50k worth shares I hope this prints

Was probably me. The red flags were when it was popping up to 50+. I think shares are probably a decent buy in the 35 - 38 range, but I don't think it's gonna print calls like it did before. I'd be super interested if it drops some more

They do not deal with hydrogen battery. They are more like micro grid supplier that uses natural gas/ biogas and covert them to clean energy with hydrogen and water being a byproduct. They can capture those hydrogen in the process. This company is a transition between oil to true renewable. I would go long on this one though.

My very small watch list, I've watched more stocks gain 50% in 2 months than I'd like to admit. MIK, SDC, GRPN, PBR

When has Citron even been right? It seems like they get short squeezed every time. The Ubiquiti thing blew up in their face badly.
I made a quick 500$ holding puts for about 15 minutes today. I plan to buy some weekly lotos on Monday morning.
mhmm. classic setup for every squeeze ever. "no way it squeezes" "dont you think mms know about the squeeze potential??" "can you stop fucking my wife?"

I've gone from 40 bucks to 10000 several times, but the trick is once you make the big break to not immediately throw it back in risky investments. The best way to do it in my opinion is to find a stock that has low premiums because of a low share price and try your best to work on building up with that stock. Then you can start moving yourself up to other companies once your profits increase or throw in some gambles if there is volatility in a certain sector (I had huge returns going in on weed before biden announcement). Once you get to a reasonable amount it's all about safer option investments. Buy ITM and a several weeks out. Realize that 20% gains is a lot if you're trading with thousands and build that way instead of risking it all and losing it on a play you would normally make with 100

There are zero moons and haven't been for ages. The only notable event was the buying opportunity when it dipped into the 70s. It will moon again, but it's useless for calls unless you catch it when it falls to support levels.

Yup, thought I had my life figured out. We spent a long time making sure everything was perfect for our future. We've settled into our careers making 400k combined, had about 500k in cash combined, she recently bought a house here in NYC for us and we were thinking about starting a family. Now it's all over and I'll probably never get all the things I wanted out of life. So I spend my days on here throwing away the money I spent 10 years saving. It's hard to start over with a  relationship at 35.
i can just set up an account with interactive brokers or td ameritrade... and sell myself the calls on the other end and then exercise with second account, and then sell the shares, and then use the money to buy more calls from myself. i dont see how this wouldn't work, but i haven't done that before

You can't complain about buying at the high on a half day on a stock that's been mooning except for Citron manipulating it. To think that hard about 1 day of losing a bit to shares, is overthinking trading. This shit will be up huge in a few years let alone this week. If I lost fuck tons in calls from today I'd be complaining to SEC tho lol.

You guys have been clamoring for a short squeeze on GME forever. Usually, when everyone is predicting a short squeeze - it doesn't happen.

You don't think tutes are aware of the SS potential? Hint: They are, but given the low float of the stock - the price can easily be manipulated.
NNOX....
What about buying calls?
[removed]
This is the way!
Nah. $25 billion is under priced now given all the changes to the market as a result of the pandemic. Plus for a meme stock it won't matter much anyway. Hype will prop it up for a while at least after it IPOs even if it were overpriced.
Listing prices are down to 8 or 9 year lows
It was a couple of days, over within the week if I recall correctly.
there's so much short interest on this shit though and we already had a big run up so i feel like a pre-earnings run up plus earnings could be the final nail in the coffin to set off the juicy short squeeze everyone's been waiting WAY too long for

and all that makes me really want to play earnings, dangerous and greedy mindset

Before listening to any of these retards here - ask yourself if you can afford to lose your $2K in its entirety. 

If answer is no, stay away from options (or at least away from short term/weekly expirations) & just buy underlying stocks instead. Don‚Äôt blindly listen to the hypes propagated by people here - no one knows which direction the market will go tmrw much less the price for a specific stock.   

Disclaim: I personally am holding some long term calls for PLTR (2021 expirations) so needless to say I think it‚Äôs a company with more upside potential. But always do your own due diligence and balance expected return with what you can afford to lose.
Oof - point taken.

Anyone else super excited for the Doordash IPO? They are silently kicking the shit out of all their competitors and went from 20% marketshare in 2019 to over 50% marketshare today. Grubhub is basically dead. Uber Eats is struggling to get restaurants on board and losing marketshare. Doordash bought out Caviar. The pandemic exploded their revenue and is propelling them to profitability way sooner than expected. 

People are hooked on food delivery apps now, and Doordash is almost guaranteed to be the #1 player in the market for the foreseeable future. Plus, they are getting tons of new non-food delivery contracts. Doordash drivers are starting to deliver shit from Walgreens, Petco, Walmart, and even fucking TVs ordered off Amazon. 

It looks like initial valuation of DASH will be $25b. Which is SUPER underpriced if you look at GrubHub. GrubHub has only 17% marketshare compared to DoorDash, and their market cap is $6.5b. Considering all the non-food/restaurant delivery revenue sources that DASH has that GRUB does not, there is an easy argument that DASH should be worth more than 3-4x GRUB.

There is absolutely no way Doordash won't be the next major meme stock when it IPOs.

Couldn‚Äôt find it, what‚Äôs the path of o get to it?
Yeah after losing my butt holding spce in feb, being up 20k then instead of cashing out putting it all 100% back into calls then losing it all lol, I'd say to cash out all the calls and just put 25% back in, if its 2 million I'd put 100k-200k back in, not ALL IN.
I watched this couple of times, impressive and inspiring, congrats!

Hey I was just wondering what broker are you using? I'm trying to jump in on options trading, and there's not a whole lot of options for someone who's living in New Zealand.

and neither of these had over 100% short interest.

More shares short than exist on a company that's not even close to bankruptcy. My sell limits are at $20, 50 and 100 but I've seen way more aggressive targets like $500.

This post is a joke don‚Äôt buy into fucking Sears. People on this sub r basically using Sears as a code word for a different IPO that rhymes with blow cocks to avoid building up to much hype for blow cocks so it IPOs at a cheaper price.
Fucking high!!!
For those who bought at IPO it would‚Äôve taken 15 months just to get back to break even. But for those who diamond handed would til today be enjoying 629% increase. About 79% a year ROI.

Just watched joe Rogan now I wanna become a rock climber lol
If there's 70m shorts, there's, by definition, (number of shares outstanding + total of short position) longs, which in this case is roughly 135-140m shares, depending on the latter.

Say A has 100 shares.  B borrows them and sells to C.

Now, A is long 100 shares, C is long 100 shares, and B is short 100 shares.

200 shares in long positions, 100 shares in short positions.

I'm not sure what your point is about a share recall.  I know exactly what happens.

You definitely did your fundamental research. Same mistake I made selling TSLA when it was stagnate for a long time between 2-300 range pre split. I don‚Äôt want to let NIO slip, mind if we keep in touch via Reddit and check back once a year?
Will you have trouble selling those calls that deep in the money? If so what will you do..?
<Slow clap which gets louder with everybody standing up>

Thanks for showing us the ways of stocks, stranger. We don't know your name, but we're now realizing, we needed the "correction" more than PLTR.
Tell her your happy to be single since you can spend all your new tendies going out and having fun (lie).. then when she comes back fuck her the way you want and then kick her out and tell her you're not feeling it.
Member when it dropped 50% in a day?
Mine ended 4 months ago and I've had two failed relationship attempts since with new women. It sucks.
Hahahaha less than zero. Well, I have a job so I donate 10% of that income as well.
NP. This is essentially a Calendar Call Spread.  A standard debit call spread would be using the same expiry date.  I have a fairly good internal guesstimator, for where these things will trade for in a week. My sense is that at $285, my calls would be worth the $12.50 plus another $5 in premium.  Then add back the $4.75 in call premium for my 'guess' of a ~$9 profit.
u r a bro, i am agree with all that
You aren't thinking about the morons (I) who bought 5k shares not too far from the open.

There's another guy with a thread out bought 6500, he's slightly worse off than I.

Only difference is he had to do it to avoid the ban.

No experience with options at all. Buy shares to be safe?
MMs take each side. Doesn‚Äôt mean some retail dude is 100k short C
This is going to squeeze at one point or another, it has been priced for bankruptcy for quite some time. They have a ton of cash on hand, recently paid off all their debt, new console release is huge hype, Ryan Cohen who built CHEWY.com is a major shareholder could Potentially take over the company and turn it into a digital company, they have been gaining a ton of traction already with online sales, share buyback, and With all of this it is shorted at almost 300% of current shares available, which means shorts are underwater and will continue to be so they will cover making the stock squeeze like nothing ever seen before, look up Volkswagen and KBIO short squeeze then times that by 3. I am holding this for quite some time.
Yup. That's just to cover their ass tho. They don't give a shit at all.
Yes. Nailed it. Or just sell to close for a profit.

it has been slowly going up but with low volume. It would take a more dramatic increase to scare shorts. A squeeze generally happens when shorts are convinced that they are wrong, and gamestop essentially has to prove itself which will easily happen after the console cycle.
Already have $30k in, upping to $100k on Monday. Went ahead and set a price alert for $100 for the squeeze.

Note that there's a very solid mathematical reason for why theta decay "increases" as expiration nears. Theta is the markets estimate of the cost/gain that continously deltahedging an option would incur until expiration. Now since volatility scales with the square root of time, it follows that theta must decay "faster" as expiration approaches.

The conclusion is there is no edge, mathematically speaking, from the faster decay. Nor is there any disadvantage in buying options that are 45-days out. I know Tastytrade and a lot of people are whoring this 45-day crap, but if you know a bit about the math behind options, you also know it makes no sense.

Let's not pump shit stocks so this group doesn't get disband, PLTR actually has good earnings and a strong growth rate with a viable business asset to help businesses cut costs with technology. Stick to companies like PLTR.
All these people telling you to cash out, so I‚Äôm here to tell you to keep holding strong! Easily 10M same time next year
This sounds like a fucking horrible idea. You‚Äôre over a million. Take profit and get out of the meme stock you retard
The more tendies PLTR puts out the more we donate
You‚Äôre missing the mf short squeeze
So I'm extra retarded and brand new at all this. Reading comments below I have a better understanding of calls as you are buying them hoping prices go up to sell (in there most basic terms). And puts are taking on a contract to sell units, and you hope the price goes down as you'll then buy them at the lower price to sell to the guy you already contacted to sell to?? Is this basically correct?
He‚Äôs an Anal-ist
Lol "took a beating," down 4% and back up 2% AH. We'll be up 20% Monday.
It only pumped because it was time for a short squeeze. Don‚Äôt get caught off sides dumbass.

I think that gamestop hitting $500 a share is almost guaranteed given the insane short interest, and the change from $16 a share to $500 a share is a bit over 3000%. I honestly it will easily hit $800 a share, but squeezes are impossible to time and setting a limit sell at $500 pretty much guarantees you get in on the insane profits

sorry. I edited my reply. I had the two switched around for some reason (mind went retarded). Brokers easily allow spreads and their creation. The selling of naked is what usually takes high amounts of capital.

Spreads and legging into spreads should be covered in your intermediate for sure. Advanced series should cover calendar / vega/theta gains.

There was this 1999 60 minutes interview with Jeff Bezos, and Amazon was worth more than Sears according to the stock market.  Some "analyst" in the same interview basically implied that it was ridiculous Amazon could be worth more than a company like Sears with billions in actual sales every year.  This actually reminds me a lot of the current situation with Tesla vs. the other car companies.
that seems like a real posibility?

They essentially turn small to large businesses into mini Amazons by facilitating discounted shipping. As a number of businesses are moving to online retail amid the pandemic the ability to pay for and print postage from the work place to be picked up by USPS or UPS is convenient and essential. https://www.stamps.com .

I bought a leap call a month ago for XYZ $15C 1/15/2022 and one near expiry call XYZ $15C 1/15/2021 and both of them are ITM with current XYZ Price ~$28. I still think XYZ can get to $50 in next few months. would it make sense to get profit out from near term expiry or leap call? When would it make sense to sell leap?
I never contribute to any pump and dump efforts because I've been a victim of them before with shitcoins. But GME is different because 1. it is a legit opportunity for everyone who takes part before the short squeeze happens. 2. it will cause a big transfer of wealth from fat cats to retail traders.

Citron also made calls on Ubiquiti.. calling them a fraud in 2017. Caused a significant but temporary drop from $70‚Äôs to under $50. I wish I had bought hard under $50. Ubiquiti surged beyond $250 recently.

He also did it to TSLA, but he also reversed course and famously capitulated and went long. He may be short TSLA again, but no one really cares about what Citron or most of the bears say about TSLA anymore, at least for now.

He isn‚Äôt always wrong, but his modus operandi is to take a short position in a stock that has significant downside risk, use his name to popularize a short‚Äôs perspective. For NIO, the Tesla EV thing is what saved it in the short term.

God... just go look at my comment history.  Second time in 2 days I've seen this nonsense.

That's not gonna happen... I don't know why people think this.

EVERY DAMN LONG is going to sell if a buyout has an agreed price at $25 and it's trading, at, say, $30.  They'll sell it right down to $25.

There's *no reason* to hold long a stock at $30 when you're only going to get $25 for it in a few months.  If anything, you sell it all and go SHORT if the price is much higher than $25.  Because it's *free money*.
yeah I used to, now I don't because that's fucking retarded

Since I bought mine on Monday I got in before the IV went through the roof so I profit of the upward IV. I‚Äôm not gunna re up on calls until after IV goes down. In the meantime I‚Äôm gunna be buying stock. If that makes sense.

Asana is a basic project management platform.
Trello is better and it's free! :)

Companies can literally develop an in house projects management system in weeks...

Don't compare Asana to Palantir.

Companies invest billions, years and still fail trying to develop an in-house Palantir.
More like TSLA.

PLTR is more like silver age Superman.

You cant exactly time it, as squeezes are heavily dependant on news.
Also what is Roblox? I‚Äôve only heard of $SEARS
Impossible to guess where we go, totally unprecedented short squeeze potential ina time with unprecedented fomo. Depending on what triggers it, we could go to 50, or several hundred
The counter case is that GME is a shitty, dying company and the stock just isn't going to go up enough to start squeezing out all the short positions in any significant amount. Fwiw I think the hype around GME is starting to reach critical mass enough to boost the stock and make this scenario unlikely, but the squeeze is certainly not a guarantee.
We storming like the spartans in 300 as soon as she is live.

From investopedia:
Floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock. Low float stocks are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by subtracting closely-held shares and restricted stock from a firm‚Äôs total outstanding shares.

Closely-held shares are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. Restricted stock refers to insider shares that cannot be traded because of a temporary restriction, such as the lock-up period after an initial public offering (IPO).

You're not totally wrong, but I don't think you're totally right, either. With a tender offer, the big institutions would have to recall their shares. Even if the offer was $25, the price would rocket higher (at least temporarily) because the shorts would have to cover.

I just started this year and my first options trades I was seeing 6k-18k a week.

I was working multiple jobs with no days off and no time off. It was unreal. I started investing 2 years ago and got a 30%+ return in my first year using an entire year's worth of income. I already had traumatic experiences that have left me cold and incapable of connecting with anything. Money seemed so tangible and easy to grasp but after my account became a roaler coaster of thousands to ten thousands of gains and losses by the week, my concept of money and its value was gone.

I barely make enough to get by now on a job due to covid but fuck it. The grind starts a new. Complaining and bitching will get me nowhere.

So that's a no to donating when it's your own money? Go complain somewhere else.
"IPO'ing today is a new company called 'Ash Nazg'. Citron says it's 100% vaporware and has no value, the CEO says there is no product, no customers, no plans to do anything, and the SEC is investigating them for a slew of crimes. Analysts at the renowned WSB expect the stock to start around $600 a share, possibly reaching $1,000 a share by July before a 10-way split, and then return to a $1,000 level around Christmas."
I'm sure they do now.
Good job autists not having weak hands and getting shaken out by that dip. Now lets ride this out to pluto.

Yeah good call, you still got in super early. One thing I'd hate about being in your position is just the inherent risk of holding these big contracts with so much time left on them. Obviously the smart plan is to wait down the line like you've been saying you're going to do. But man it'd kill me just knowing that I'm only 'paper rich' lol. By the end what will you do? Exercise all your contracts or you plan on selling the contracts when the time comes?

Yea 12/31 is fine.  I would hold that.  December on average has been a solid month overall.  The worst case scenario is QQQ sells off since that makes everything tech tank.  Hopefully that doesn't happen.  I usually take profits at like 50% or even at like 25% if it's close to expiration, but people here would make fun of me for that.  Good luck.

A combination of wanting to maintain my current lifestyle (not relocate, I'm in the midwest) and trying to live a stress free lifestyle, I had just come down from five years of brutal startup life.

I do not have a philosophical bias against what they are selling.
You‚Äôre still right but if enough idiots make this shoot up then itd be a great short
So, in this situation, why wouldn't you buy calls? Because nobody could buy your contracts?

It depends on how longs play the squeeze. Every share shorted is 2 long shares, so technically there are 140 million shares held long and 70 million shares short. So it depends on if enough longs hold their stock to cause a liquidity crises for shorts, however I think 20-30% of the shares are held in ETFS and Cohen, so it should be tough for shorts to cover
And how was the quality?

Awesome thank you!
What strike/expiry are you looking at?
They give you the option (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares of a stock at a set price on or before a certain date.

So let‚Äôs say you bought a $10 call for a random stock XYZ for December 31, which costs you a $50 ‚Äòpremium‚Äô. If the stock jumps up to $15 by then, you can then buy 100 shares of that stock for only $10 each, giving you a 450 dollar profit ($5x100-50). However, if the stock remains (or drops) below $10 by that point then your call expires worthless and you lose $50.

It has its legitimate uses in traditional investments but it‚Äôs also essentially a high risk/high reward way to gamble on the stock mark set.
Palantir is a consulting company valued like a tech company and it‚Äôs riding the AI/ML hype wave. 

From a former employee on Quora: ‚ÄúAt it's core, Palantir is a data consultancy company. The business model is - we get large high profile clients (companies/government), convince them why they need to leverage their data, and then sell our data platform (that the regular Software Engineers build) to them. Each "deployment" has Deployment Strategists (biz guys) and Forward Deployed Engineers (engineers that basically act as consultants) that "manage" the deployment. This means they figure out how to load their old unstructured data into their systems and help them use it to solve the client's problems. The only way this is different from what consulting companies do is that it's more hands on.‚Äù

The company hires Ivy league grads to work as ‚Äúforward deployed engineers‚Äù (consultants) that work directly with customers to get more insights from their data. This means the company‚Äôs workforce scales roughly linearly with its number of customers, not sub-linearly like most hyper-growth tech companies. It‚Äôs like a McKinsey or Boston Consulting Group but with focus on data consulting instead of management consulting.
I doubled up back in 2018 before it all crashed. Cashed out half and the rest has been riding ever since. Plus the weed ETF I‚Äôm in has a 10% dividend.
I felt pain in my vagina reading that, and I don't even have a vagina
I‚Äôm long on McDonald‚Äôs and Johnson & Johnson. Americans getting bigger and bigger and need to apply BENGAY on their sore knees from carrying 300 pounds of McRibs all day.
Terrific Tuesday then?
Really? I didn't know that. Thank you so much for telling me that after clearly reading my comment and understanding what I was saying. You are a brilliant mind indeed.
Do some research

Got a link?
The IV is so crazy right now

But then how do you get the second screenshot?

damn, mean while homes here (QC) are selling like hot pancakes. Down the street from my folks, some grandma listed her bungalow for 330k, sold it 9 days later for 440k. Was a fuckin bidding war for a pos house that hasn't been renovated since the 60's
The year is 2077, you and your family are having a BYND soy turkey substitute with tempeh stuffing for dinner at MCDBKWND.

You live in your parents 6x6 Zillow basement at 77 years old and still work at an AMZN warehouse as a sex slave. This is your one vacation day allotted for 5 years.

Your investment in Dow Jones went bankrupt as the DJIA is still struggling to cross 30k. Your friends who invested in Dow Jiang, the Chinese version of the dow are now retired and drive NIOs.

TSLA is now a country in Mars and you spend your time daydreaming about being a colonist as you're driving to work in a 2030 XPEV. It is custom painted with the WSB logo, license plate reading "BULZ R FUK"

However in order to day trip thru the solar system, Space X requires a minimum portfolio balance of $25,000. Per the law of Elon, circa 2050.

You boot up your portfolio on Robinhood2 using your iPhone 6s plus even though Apple had gone out of business in 2025 when the UN outlawed the wheel for environmental reasons. Sign is visible at their abandoned headquarters in California reading: "Theta this now you fucking piece of shit". Goodyear blimp crash landed and still somehow burning in the parking lot.

You attempt to connect to the restaurant's wifi since Starlink took their services offline in North America after an antitrust suit by the Republic of Exxon Mobil, formally known as Texas. They are the only state that still uses gasoline even after it was confirmed that vaping petrol causes mild insomnia.

Your account balance reads -$89.51. And a margin call message appears in your inbox. "Please stop sending Pesos in an envelope when you make a deposit. Furthermore, We will no longer be able to receive kidneys as form of payment. Sorry for the inconvenience"

You once again average down on your PLTR $10000P 11/27/77 hoping for a gap down. Andrew Left's post on Tiktok justified your DD. It was either that or THCüêù who were still trying to acquire energizer batteries (close race between them and Oracle/Walmart)

The market opens and PLTR tanks after the news that they will buy out Google. A stock deal like that could mean millions of issued shares.

Alex Karp and Mr. Peanut brings out a fat stack of Turkish Lira and a tanker full of diesel and trades it for boomer ass GOOGL like it was a Roblox card. PLTR closes at $10001 making sure that your puts expire worthless.

On the way to LOW for some ROPE, you are hit by a rogue NKLA going downhill. You haven't seen one of those since 2020. The year you could have loaded up on PLTR calls when it was trading for $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. You die cursing George Soros as your shitty XPEV drives itself back to the dealership for missing payments.
I think I saw on Reddit, if i misinformed i am definitely sorry. 
But even if they didn‚Äôt... 
They‚Äôve shorted so many stocks that have beat his expectations and soured..
ü§°
Nobody cares
Not sure either - [But I love this](https://twitter.com/allenau11/status/1332243779164618752?s=21)

MARA 1/21/22 $7c
RIOT 1/21/22 $10c

This is the way.

(Watch out for another bitccoin dip on Sunday/Monday though. There‚Äôs supposed to be a negative article about coiinbase getting published on Sunday that they preemptively emailed users about)

you must not be anywhere near california, because prices went up 14% in October alone.
Can‚Äôt wait to cop some Sears and Roebu‚ùéck
Didn‚Äôt know about this new rule.
I could hear you chewing gum when I read this.
How long term are we looking? Got some 12/31 $520 calls up 25% but feel like I should hold longer but idk. Another positive vaccine announcement or something would kill this shit lol.
If you‚Äôre looking for a pandemic rebound stock UAL is good. They‚Äôll be carrying the vaccine in their cargo planes and are undervalued for when travel returns.
Otherwise, all in on JD.com.
Which are those?
