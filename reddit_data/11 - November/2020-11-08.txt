I know we're not supposed to talk politics, but watching the never trump people on Twitter start flipping out that Biden is signalling that he is going to do standard democrat polticial thing is nothing short of high comedy.  These guys are freaking out because Biden is a democrat and operating like one. Would definitely recommend following some of them on Twitter for the lolz.

I bought spce and people think I'm crazy- they thought I was crazy when I bought corsair, they thought I was crazy when I bought NIO. I just wish my wife's boyfriend had more faith in me
/ES or SPX?  Not that it makes much of a difference I guess, but if it‚Äôs /ES you can punt them now. That shit sucks man, I bet they were wayyy OTM when you sold them too, huh?

How does this apply for options? Say I have 1000$ Tsla Calls expiring in January. I realize the gains/losses on the position and proceed to buy another call at a different strike or a put instead would that be considered a wash sale?

My uncle works at Buyden and he says Joe has a secret plan to unleash several NASDAQ whales on the market, just to annoy Mango Man. I don't understand what all this means but I thought I'd share it with you guys.

yup, it will. we paid for our red in the last couple months, now its all green and steep
So you‚Äôre saying calls?
I am curious about the actual death rate. Giving hospitals extra money for every covid death they report is just asking for incorrect numbers. People are greedy and they will 100% take advantage of that program, even more so if your hospital is struggling.

Best I've got is that Fastly at the server level is easier to update bits and pieces of it. This is important if you aren't just pushing files but customizing the cache at nearly a per user level.

I'm not sure how much a head start matters here. It certainly helped Fastly sign up an impressive roster of clients. I do kinda wonder what the next leg of growth is if they've already signed so many of the major players.

Don't double down without a hedge or at least cover your position by selling a contract, otherwise expect to lose it all and hope for the best.
70% from job 30% from own business
it's not easy being this retarded

I have puts but I‚Äôm guaranteed to be wrong. Spy 370 tomorrow probably
Oh good for him then. Enjoy that time and money.
I'll buy it.
Biden setting up a white house office to fight climate change.... omg gonna cum on my TAN, ICLN calls Holy shit
So if 70% of my income is from my job and 30% is from my own business and I've lost 66% of all of that money I still need to pay taxes on 100%?

I don't know what I'm talking about, but I think it works for covered calls and for hedging overall market swings

Will bounce around 75 to 85 before taking off from here again
It would be hypocritical since the left have been saying the market is where it‚Äôs at because of Obama presidency. So with their logic, even when Biden is in office, the right will say it was thanks to Trump‚Äôs presidency.
Hey uh, yall should prob buy some NIO calls, i mean if you feel like it i guess idk

But then again, the virus could mutate and be even worse as we enter cold weather. Also joe Biden might shut down things more?

Idk. I‚Äôm a little scared too. I have most of my profile in stocks though so I‚Äôll enjoy the gains. If it drops, I‚Äôll buy more

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't buy options until market opens at 9:30 eastern time.
Im holding 362‚Äôs that i paid .05 for so we‚Äôll see
Yeah. That's how I prepare my ducks
Around what price tag would AAPL and MSFT be at if NASDAQ hits 15,000?
Looking good for tomorrow. My gut says green  at least until Wednesday.
Yeah I was hoping there was somewhere we could see what the price in China is right now? Obviously it‚Äôs traded there too and will reflect in a gap up in the morning at 4am when brokers update the prices of shares reflective of other markets or futures action on major indices. Guess that‚Äôs not an option or I‚Äôm just not looking the right way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It‚Äôs true. Feel more relaxed and self confident. Plus my appetite increases too

Spy 360 end of week
That would be like three years ago
We‚Äôll see, runoffs typically see a much lower turnout from Dems so it‚Äôll be interesting if they will be able to pull it off in a state like GA especially.
Why do you think that? I'm just bear curious
360 calls could be a 5 bagger tomorrow
You think this is a good entry point for some volatility calls?

Trickle in
ü•≠ has to be so salty that the markets are mooning against him
I just looked out the window and saw Jesus descending from Heaven with dollar bills trailing behind him
I have \~$8000 in SPY and QQQ puts, and \~$80,000 in stocks and some calls. 

I was more interested in a market crash, and am devastated for my puts which expire 11/20.

I think I will sell my bullish positions and buy more puts. Maybe it's not as bad for me as I think... I still wanted a crash.
This week*
How much capital you risking?
Ban
Jesus fuck you're all extra retarded. CNN does this with every Chinese stock. There is an issue with the USD/Yuan conversion...
Guhhhhhhhhh reeeennnnn. Im all in nio ready for short squeeze
I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow
real question, how do i calculate how much my NIO 11/20 45c will be worth if NIO goes to $45 tomorrow?
I'm considering buying calls
Hahahaha
CGC and ACB earnings tomorrow
Big O'rangers fan here
The day I loaded a bunch of tech calls..
$310 maybe. Ant IPO delayed for 4-6 months.
Yeah, something like that. It's more straightforward to consider the change in the underlying stock price rather than a percentage change.  


SPY ended Friday at about 350 a share. If we open at 356, then (-0.25) \* 6 gives you about -$1.50 for your contract. However, as /u/ArUaArugula said, you need to consider gamma as well. If SPY were to continue to increase, your delta would decrease and you'd lose less money per $ increase in SPY. Of course, overall, you'd continue to lose money on your put as SPY increases.
This has got to be something else too, are vaccine news coming out tomorrow or something?

I got a $11c for 12/18 that I‚Äôve had since April that was 0 as one time then got up to 3.36 Friday. Wondering how high this might go
Maybe I‚Äôm just too skeptical of Chinese company valuations considering their track records on American exchanges. GL to everyone in it, hope you make the big bucks, but this looks pretty sus to me.

FD‚Äôs are fine just don‚Äôt diamond hand them lol.
Youtube. People fail at options trading because options trading is retarded. You cant predict the future and you dont know when movements will happen without insider information. Options trading IS gambling. If you trade options for long enough, you WILL lose all your money. It is almost a guarantee.
I can see the dip coming later in the week, but everyone will get greedy after seeing Monday‚Äôs green dildo and get rug pulled
How can she pump ?!
RKT calls at open
$SPCE is the next $NIO. You heard it here first
SLV doesn't make sense cause the price is determined by like six guys who throw a monkey's head down a well and count the seconds before they hear a splash. That shitty stock is whatever its CEOs want it to be.

if you are a short term bull gg seriously, good fucking job, but if you are a long term bull, you should be worried about how this market is acting, it looks like a blow off top, and soon everyone is going to be running for the exits
This genuinely made me laugh out loud so thank you for that. I also am loaded to to the tits with puts and for some reason I still have hope that tomorrow will dump. Gay bears unite

Yeah? What excuse would that be? The most bearish outcome was election gridlock. That is still in play: predictit is giving trump a 14% chance of winning despite the MSM declaring Biden the victor. Next, if Biden wins and the republicans hold the Senate (most likely outcome), there may not be fiscal stimulus. And despite that, markets are mooning.

Fuck yes, this 100%. Wash sale rule sucks and nobody tells you about how it can fuck you up the ass tax wise until that first tax bill comes and you're like "bUt i LoSt MoNey oN ThE yEaR iT's ImpOsSiBlE tO oWe TaXeS!?" and end up owing money that you don't have because it's all gone..
Are we going past ATH today?

The news that election is over. I‚Äôm guessing that wasn‚Äôt the question you meant tho. We ripped thru the call wall, profit taking will happen, reversion to mean, MM will roll their calls

Dude you need to take a step back and stop applying rationality to your trading. Rationality has costed me over 50% this year :)
New team can't demand or implement anything until the old team is gone (Jan.); can make plans and proclamations but nothing can, or will, be affected until sworn-in.  Getting boned for the office space is probably less impactful with remote work but people don't work for free for long and will need that govt. coin.

Back in 2018 I could have sworn that I was following the NIO stock, and that the stock was around 40 a share.

Am I on glue? Or was there a change to their stock? When I look back on the stocks history I see that it was at $2 back in 2018.

Unless there is another stock similar to this, competing against Tesla?

Lol that's not how the market works. If tax cuts == stocks go  up brrrr then the economy should zoom under every Republican presidency and go down under every Democratic presidency but that's not the case at all, you could argue the opposite and while I think it's a small sample size either way, it's hard to make your claim.

Green, thank you very much for assking
I'm not done buying.

I will give you the process I use, though.

Use this screener:

[https://www.tradingview.com/screener/](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/)

Add a column for "Sector" in the interface, Set Sector filter to "Finance", then sort by dividend yield.

Find a ticker in your price range and load it up in a 5 year chart.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL/](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/AAPL/)

What was it doing pre-covid?

This is the MOST IMPORTANT PART =---->  what was it doing pre-covid?

Did it have several years of sideways action or slow movement and then fell off a cliff in March? That's the shape we want.

That is your main criteria, the shape of the 5 year chart. You can get companies that were trading pre-covid for anywhere from 2 to 5 times the current share price.

Now look at the dividend history and see if and when they are paying dividends.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/dividend-history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aapl/dividend-history)

Assuming it has the 5-year chart shape you want, and the dividends are acceptable, we look at the options chain.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)

Some tickers don't have options, avoid those ones.

Finally, look into the company and find out what sort of business it does. If it's in your favored sector, add it to your list. Maybe open a position in it after you're done screening.

I just looked at NIO and they are on track to sell 20k cars this year, and in China only. Why in the name of God are we talking about them going HIGHER than $40b market cap on just their ADR? It looks like their ERs have shown them to be heavily bleeding quarter after quarter. Am I missing something? They look more sick at this valuation than anything TSLA had going on before they were profitable, but nobody seems bearish?

Just pick your expiration calendar at the top, pick the mid and then you can manually insert what you paid for it on the next page including how many contracts. It‚Äôll spit out a chart that is handy to show you where you stand. You also manually insert IV which gives you a feel of the range it could land as well.

Just a heads up Biden and Kamala get there briefing from the Covid Transition advisory board tomorrow, afterwards Biden will give his remarks and is expected to name his Covid Task force. 

 According to the Washington Post and other sources GSA Emily Murphy is refusing to sign a letter that will allow Biden's Transition team access to funds and office space necessary to begin work essentially blocking them. 

Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-gsa-letter-biden-transition/2020/11/08/07093acc-21e9-11eb-8672-c281c7a2c96e_story.html#click=https://t.co/9ltdK9cUqD  

So if Biden/Harris come out of there meeting tomorrow and demand stricter measures for Covid only to be blocked by Trump what the fuck happens from there?

So, how we doin?
They wanted the house and senate split.  No crazy surprises that way, they will cancel each other out and no unexpected crazy policies are likely to be passed.  

Market players believes in their ability to invest but not its ability to predict shit that outsider or policy makers are going to do that will negatively impact the market, ie uncertainty.  

They now feel comfortable that neither side will be able to do something extreme or retarded because of checks and balances of a split house and senate.

Okay, citi recently upgraded at $44.60. How does that justify ~$150 to $300 projections in CNN? What the hell are you taking about?
> AAAANNNNNDDDDD HE LOST. DUMBASS
Yeah, it's more complicated than that. Basically the HK Baba price is in Hong Kong Dollars which equal about 13 cents in USD. However, when you buy 1 share of Alibaba in the US you are actually buying 8 shares. So really Alibaba is at 292 in Hong Kong Dollars and $37.50 in USD. However 1 USD share equals 8.

Well, yeah, you're doing your part to lose money and she's just buying expensive bread?  You'll never go into debt like that.
It's called value investing degenerate. NIO is way undervalued even at these prices. It may need a correction sometime before we get to a proper valuation, but long term this stock is worth over $200 a share. Also, NIO will probably touch $45 tomorrow alone, so $50 is not too far fetched. GET OVER IT NIO BEAR

There is no reason for the market to reach new highs. Biden will increase corporate taxes at least, so that‚Äôs no good. The COVID is not going away yet and may gets a lot worse before it gets better. There is an alarming development with mink COVID which may render some vaccines ineffective. With so many vaccines in trial, one or two are bound to be ineffective. China tension is not going away because Trump will probably slap some sanctions on China before he leaves (if he leaves ) just to mess with Biden. Biden can‚Äôt remove the sanctions without being called China‚Äôs puppet (same situation with Trump/Russia). The current rally is merely a sigh of relief that democrats probably won‚Äôt enact a more socialist agenda. Its foundation is just not there yet.

For me, if it's up I think "Wow, I just made a week's pay in 1 day!"  Then, over the course of the next week I will lose all of that, and more.  Then on my next green day I will think, "Wow, this is multiple day's pay right here, I'm doing great!"

Serious question: why do you think the number provided there is higher than the individual recent projections given by JP Morgan ($40) or Citi ($33.20), or other banks? Why do you think that CNN's target prices are so much higher than other aggregators like, say, TipRanks?

Here's an idea, rather than looking at CNN's aggregate,  find the straight source. Can you find the exact analyst that gave that ~$150 projection in USD (or any reputable analyst giving $100 or over). Note: you won't be able to.
Don‚Äôt ban
he kept buying way out of the money
your right about the first part.  don't know how/why you would possibly say the second thing.  he's fundamentally a coward so he'll go when the pressure is applied, and even if he refused he'll get dragged out.  what do people not understand about the fact that at 12:01pm on January 20, 2021 he is just a regular joe again.  Normal citizen.  No more special laws or protection from his bootlicking AG William Barr.  Handcuffs and a jail cell.
I dont see any reason for them to spike up that ‚Äúsoon‚Äù.  Idk maybe toss a ‚Äúnegligible‚Äù amount of your portfolio if you have reason to believe they could spike (you believe in their tech or something), but otherwise maybe let it go until longer dated options are available.

If the election was actually at risk of flipping, the market would drop drastically. At this point, it would not be treated the same way as Election Day returns reversing course. I don‚Äôt think this is of any meaningful likelihood though.
What earnings you guys gonna yolo this week? I need one with high volatility.

This is the content I'm here for. Feed my addiction! Lol
Looking for the markets to drift higher between now and end of year, but if markets get too ‚Äúover bought‚Äù by way of the RSI on SPY - then ‚Äúpump the brakes‚Äù. So sell a couple holdings or trim a bit at that time. You‚Äôll know it when you‚Äôre peak euphoric about the market.

Yea bruh chill we want to make sweet bank yo
Bears‚Äô assholes are getting too loose from all this fucking. We need bigger and fatter green dildos for their gaping holes.
Biggest thing I am worried about is if we don't get a vaccine by the time Biden gets in. Because if not we are gonna lock down again and that will tank this whole thing.

If the margins in the literally 5 states trump is trying to flip we‚Äôre like 100 votes I‚Äôd be concerned. But a lot of them are like 30,000 vote margins. Even if he flipped several which he won‚Äôt int wouldn‚Äôt matter
I'm down

I did 357 for 11/11 is that retarded I‚Äôve never bought put/call before.
That only matches US Baba close price from Friday. Generally if you add about $9 to BABA HK you will get US Price.

so serious question (I know we're not allowed to ask serious questions)... if Trump starts winning in court and the election flips, is there gonna be a massive sell-off to bring the markets back down to Tuesday/Wednesday levels?
*one handed clap*
Luckin didnt have a fundamental issue. They had an accounting issue.
Otherwise I agree.
Yes!!! We rich!!

Day traders are actually cringe and gay. I'm glad you aren't one of them
APHA 11/13 7c a good play?
Aight.  I‚Äôm not selling covered calls anymore.
imagine not using adblock
Wtf !!! This is retarded.   Wed,thurs pump and a breather frid and now another pump...
SPY 450 2022 leaps and the chance of that happening is very high. Yeah we'll see some short term riots but no civil war lol, they'll burn themselves out after a week and have to get used to it again and hopefully focus their attention on improving themselves.
That was pre-legalization hype in Canada. Look at the financials for ACB. This is a hype spike, I'd wait for it to subside before investing. I sold at 100% gain this week. Going long on it is solid, but don't buy it at this top.
KNDI. Earnings tomorrow. Sells in US already. My DD.

I'm telling you so you know you can do it. You are not a piece of trash, no matter what your mommy, your wife or her boyfriend says.
I feel like bears gave up. There isn‚Äôt even incessant covid fear mongering tonight.
Just hope my plug calls print. Then sell and buy different calls
How many times have you gone to sleep expecting it to moon only to wake up to a complete blood bath? Every fucking time?

its not in the same category tbh
Actually smart.
my slv calls are resurrected from the dead
I wish but I don‚Äôt have a day trade available on RH. I could use up the fourth and have my account be restricted from buying and selling which won‚Äôt be too bad but then I‚Äôll have to sign up for another brokerage and it‚Äôs just so much work.

Rkt calls up until earnings or keep until earnings?

It's claimed Trump along with federal law enforcement was in a SCIF on election night watching all the fraud in realtime, with lots of federal agents in plainclothes at voting locations.

Say that to Luckin Coffee investors, they said the same thing.
Where to fuck are the positions? Ban this shit
u smell
Honestly, I would look at AMD. They are a very strong buy now but below $80 would be even better

Also NVDA is going to keep pushing up. Premiums are good and selling Covered Calls can net you some nice pocket change

And BABA is also now clear of idiotic middle of the night trade disputes so a much safer investment. They are going to push past $300 on Monday no doubt
On Friday I had A FEELING. I sold all my SLV calls, and bought spy poots instead.

Yes comrade, Hail Hydra!
Considering getting in at open for a hold through earnings after hours. You think it's worth it or too late?
song slaps
Its Buyden baby, we BUYIN
Lol his retard base as in 71 million americans? Looooll
It never reaches its final form
Ok thanks!
Yeah, the FOMO is real. Everyone saying it's due for a correction is right, but the battery day and other news this past weekend is sending it higher this week. And then by next week, the anticipation for earnings will just drive it higher. I'm guessing it will heavily correct a day or two after earnings
Too good üòÇ

yeah

this is officially fake and gay
I'm not discussing it because I understand the reality that there will be no riots or turnaround of the election results. Also, covid in the U.S. has been surging and hitting new records last week, market still went up. Parts of Europe enter new lock downs and new restrictions, markets still went up. Check my post history, I've never once posted loss porn. I live in reality, you're the delusional fuck who believes in conspiracies and political bullshit.

Lol this guy's out for blood.
...Nio and shitty Canadian weed stocks. Can we reroll the meme stocks these ones suck
You'll be fine. If anything it'll be good for you.
Zoom your fucking charts out
Excited for my AMD calls to print me more money! AMD Call $78.5 11/13, Call $89 11/20
I think there will be a pull back, but I think earnings is too close that the pullback won't happen until after earnings is past. The anticipatory runup to earnings will likely outweigh the effects of a correction. So I'm thinking: buy a shit ton of calls expiring the 20th, sell just before earnings or a little after, and then buy back in after the stock tanks in a correction
As long as he has Ivanka he doesn't care

Why? If your leveraged enough, will likely make more tomorrow from the market than your job. What's more important short term? Your not going to lose your job lol. But you might, who the fuck am I to say that.

AMC. Had fd's and it had an insane bounce that day
!remind me 19 January 2021
You'll probably get it back as long as you keep at it, and you'll know more about economics from day 1 so I bet it comes back faster, and you will also avoid becoming that a$$hole we all know who insists all poor people deserve whatever bad luck swings their way because you'll understand that bad luck happens and sometimes it can really beat you down/make you consider giving up.

They recently issued a recall
Then the story is fake
how do i check nio price in other countries rn?
Is it too late to buy NIO calls tomorrow and sell day before earnings?

You are Gucci, they are going back up past $320 very quickly. I sold puts on the ANT news dip, and again the morning after earnings

I‚Äôll bring the coke cola and blow
QQQ, DIA, or Spy this week?
True, although they do plan on expanding to Europe next year, so if they open up some dealerships and carve a foothold they got some more room to grow
NIO actually has plans for US expansion. $100+ EOW
holy fuck another green shrek.
And they are spreading to Europe

Bucs are suck bois
should I go strangles or just calls
Acb for sure dropping like 30-50% this week.
I like their holdings too but do you think options, specifically leaps, aren't as good an idea as say, buying and holding shares?
Nio is low lol their medium is 150
[deleted]
soooooo, qqq 320 and spy 370 by eow? plan accordingly
Just lucky. I also bought some leaps when it was $25. A week later, they were up 30% so I sold them to take a profit. If I held them, I would be up 400% on them ü§°ü§°ü§° dumb fuck I am

Everyone know Biden is a neo-liberal and works directly for wall street.
Double down
How much were SPY 360 FDs on Friday? ü§ë
Powell will continue to add stimulus, and biden won't fight against it. Heck he will encourage it even more to pay for his green new deal esque policy as well as medicare for "those who want it". Wtf does that even mean? Someone is given the choice between free gov healthcare versus paid private healthcare? Who the fk would pay for the private healthcare? There's barely a difference, and if private is better (not including the cost obviously) then it's only marginally better......
Think about how much more it can do in China first and then it can have that stuff done once that because a mainstream thing
Quite a run when Covid is as worse as ever... this week will be fun
Better than after buying puts. I think 40% of this place lost money last week ü§¢ü§Ø
Good enough for me
Just get leaps. I made 50% off fucking leaps, just from buying the dip on MSFT. This bull market is out of control

Leaps can't go tits up becuase you have time to recover in case it goes bad, it's more like shares
I think the markets will be bull until january unless civil war breaks
Doesn‚Äôt need to
Shares on margin FTW
Especially after the rough preceeding months

All of the gains, none of the theta decay or IV crush.

I did almost 20k last week on AMD and NVDA shares alone, about $150k shares total

Had I bought options I would have panic sold on Monday probably.

Dating in modern times is fucking weird. One thing I looked into is how animals interact. Lions with the biggest manes get the lioness (your beard), peacocks with the most color on their feathers get mates (your skin), gorillas with the most muscle (if you hit the gym or not), and some certain species who have the most resources (how much money you have). Everything just goes back to our primitive natures.

Ah NIO was my first YOLO. I bought $10k in May 2019 for $4 and told myself I would hold it forever; I was but a wee lad. Many moments later I was much wiser and sold it the next day for $3.86 and never looked back. Came out richer in spirit though for sure.
would be funny if biden tweeted about all time highs

I‚Äôm gonna retire tomorrow

It's real easy if you follow this proven method. What you want to do is start by putting your index finger in your poop chute. You're young so it's probably taut and malleable. From here you want to gently work 2 fingers in then 3. Eventually you want to be able to slam your first in there real angry like. While doing this just ponder your losses and the adverse effect its had on your poor fragile mind that caused you to ultimately make this post.

It‚Äôs a tough call. If you could afford to let it ride I would. I honestly believe that we are going to have a significant contraction. I would be shocked if the price we see at Monday open is the low and it rises all the way till 11/20. I‚Äôm still expecting a large dip
Itll flip by open and you‚Äôll wish u slept lol
I dont know man. I've turn 3800 into 9000 in like two weeks on NIO. I trust in it but really don't want to lose all my gains and more.

Needs a pullback to be healthy for more increases. I‚Äôm honestly scared right now because it‚Äôs way above BMW‚Äôs market cap while only selling 5500 cars a month. Not to mention that everyone knows about it now. I started buying shares at $21. Around 50% total in the green with it. Want to add more but I just feel a huge correction coming

But I‚Äôm also a dumb fuck so what do I know

It just doesn't make sense - for NIO to hit those levels it means that not only would NIO need to have a huge share of the Western EV market, Western governments would need to invest into battery swap stations, basically to the ire of Tesla. I feel like there's a limit to what Nio can do overseas.
They forgot Step 5. Money counter go brrrr
Political meme and no positions? Ban.
>You were being snarky by implying that CNN are the only ones calling the race (when it's actually literally everyone). 

Or, I went to the Denver subreddit, saw the pinned post, and it went to the CNN page and only the CNN page. I wasn't implying anything. That was what I knew.

>Races don't become official when someone concedes.  

Really? Then what's the point of using lawyers to determine if votes were fraudulent? Is that something you normally do after you concede?

> But that process is locked in and a technicality at best. 

The process of determining who won the election is a "technicality"? And the main difference between a Democracy and a Republic?

>The situation now is that Trump needs to overturn like 4 fucking states to win, and he's trying to do it with lawsuits. 

Looks like 3 of them have signs of obvious major fraud. Do you think Democrats limited fraud to just the 4 states you're thinking about?

Yup. All the banks upgrade NIO, all these capitalist pigs paying attention now. You think NIO won‚Äôt goof their ER numbers if they need to? NIO ER guaranteed banger. Then dump the next week.
It‚Äôs looking like a 10% week. It could happen all at once or over the week, who can really say.
Obviously there is the added bonus of the woman but I went down a rabbit hole last week watching professional darts. Holy shit can it get intense.
Okay real response though. You fucked up BIG and youre going to just have to deal with that. Hiding it from people isnt going to make it any less real. Everything happens for a reason, and clearly you had a lesson to learn. So learn it. Figure out what your goal is, make a strategy, and follow it. 24 is young and its the time to take risks and make mistakes. This is a good thing and something you will NEVER forget and most likely will do your best to make sure it never happens again. This lesson will apply an infinite amount of times in your life. Just dont fucking kill yourself. Thats all i can say

Unless someone‚Äôs buys them out tomorrow.. like I dunno, constellation brands stake in CGC, this stock is going no where. It never has, and never will.
ya I agree with that.  Too much good stuff in the short term to take advantage on to be making a long term play.  I think getting 2023 leaps could be worth it though (like $30 2023 leaps in case it memes up to $40B in market cap)
You can still get a used Camry to film pops in his Lambo.

Nio or pltr weeklies. This is the way.
Here's my pitch to anyone who doubts getting into NIO

China really cares about reputation. If another company is shown as a scam and especially since they are trying to get into the higher end manufacturing, the NIO ceo should be worried about his head on the block. If a man's sweating his life, I can bet 3k on his life

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ


And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé
I feel this was a total team effort.

They backtested QQQJ against QQQ and many others and it outperformed them by 270% in ten years.

Dude is literally undermining our elections at this moment and egging on his retard base
Here‚Äôs the flaw in that logic. During the initial 10% drop in February, the whole sub was negative. But that didn‚Äôt mean that the 10% was the bottom. We saw that as we went down, each day was a ‚Äúrecord breaking‚Äù negative sentiment. Same goes the other way. Sentiment might be positive, but who says it can‚Äôt be even more positive? Ultimately, sentiment is a lagging indicator and does not produce alpha.
Why would you do this
Ever watch Jeoprady? The man was a legend.

just googled it, im not optimistic about FSR off of 2 seconds of searching.  They incorporated in 2016, not likely to have any product for a while.  Maybe good for long term?

Hedging with calls then I'll get back in with later dates later in the week.

From what I've seen, republicans are very responsible, getting by on only SPY 25%/year. But democrats are the evil rich who are wanting to pump it 700%/year
Anybody else in on CRON calls? bought a bunch of these fuckers on Thursday and am looking for a pump.

Let's talk about how much CASH he has in his account instead of his "WORTH"
I think if you weed out the anime fan type portion of this sub you are left with decent intelligent people we just love to gamble get fucked up and blow off steam we are just in touch and embrace these retarded decisions we go balls deep in. Once you see how much money can change hands so easily and the large amounts that are available for the average person to take if they have the balls to put some skin in the game it gives your life a new freedom but your life becomes a bit of a black comedy like this sub. And by black comedy I don't mean a Tyler Perry film.
Ok, Chad.

Piece of shit stock has been a nightmare. Fuck Adam Bierman.
Enter on a red day, or intraday. I wouldnt otherwise
Biden is more stable than Trump. Market likes stability. 

The big downside to having Biden as President is his tax plan, which will be made difficult by the Republican Senates, and especially Mitch McConnell. 

A political gridlock is forming, with a more stable and predictable President. Why wouldn‚Äôt the market be rallying?

Trump Rallies coming soon 
https://twitter.com/kylenabecker/status/1325598183783886848?s=20
Yeah as excited as I am for these rallies (might actually fly to one from CA, would be my first), I am disappointed at the inevitable second wave of coronavirus that only occurs at Trump rallies and not giant block parties in NYC
This for some reason reads like one of those bad trip experiences from Erowid.  My advice would be don't trade anymore.  Stick to things you're good at, trading is not one of them.  Most people cannot trade so I wouldn't beat yourself up over it.  I still haven't proven myself to be profitable after years and many losses.  I should only buy and hold, based on my track record, but I'm stubborn and won't give up.  I would give up if I lost as much as you though, that's terrible.  My advice would be to just buy and hold solid companies like UPS, WMT, FDX, AMZN, etc.  Companies with solid earnings, companies that are in the list of the top 20 held by hedge funds, nothing speculative and overpriced like SNAP or NIO.  Just forget about your account and watch it grow over the years ie. investing, not trading.  Good luck.
did you panic or diamond hand
This is insane lol üòÇ
QQQ 260 & 250, SPY 310. Entered Monday at open at low cost. Added one contract/day as it continued to rise and overbought on longer timeframe charts. Would you recommend selling at open tomorrow? Or would you say I'd be cutting out at the "bottom" of my losses. I've been hedging with calls  along the way this past week that have saved me from deeper loses. But 11/20 is still a way from now, and even if it continues, I feel there will be profit taking / a slight drop after the Apple event Tues due to cases rising/europe lockdowns etc. Any input is greatly appreciated. I'm really getting killed here.

Sir, this is Wendy‚Äôs your today‚Äôs order has been pending since 2019
Trump = possibility of trade war with China = bad for China stocks

Biden = chances of a trade war are greatly reduced, if not non existent = better for China stocks

Plus Biden is pro EV and green energy. It's not so much that he's doing anything directly positive for NIO, he's just much less of a risk than Trump was.

Yeah, its certainly a nuanced topic. 
I'm a well paid tech worker in an American company and my even better paid peers/friends still have crazy horror stories even with "good" insurance... but then again paying $15k out of pocket can often be a preferred option vs a long wait time or sub optimal care for something serious.

Red Senate, nothing is getting passed to increase taxes. Biden has always supported free trade so Trade Wars are likely to be reduced too plus there is now more pressure for a larger Stimmy if one doesn‚Äôt get passed in the Lame Duck period
The production is relatively low is what I mean. You're right that in the literal sense that is incorrect and I should be more cautious.

I know that this isn't a political sub, so I'll try to be short, Trump's  tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 will increase taxes on everyone except the rich starting 2021. Biden only wants to increase taxes on the rich, and finally make sure that rich people are being taxed the way that they should. And a red senate will fuck over Biden regardless. In every way possible, Biden seems better than Trump regarding tax policy.

I'm not disagreeing with anyone here. I'm just saying Intel will be back to the throne. Yes AMD is killing Intel with efficiency and better core count. But still just think about it what Intel is achieving at 14nm, and then what they'll be able to get out from the processor whenever they sorts out their issues with 7nm fab. And btw all my knowledge is basically from LTT and a friend who used to work for intel until recently.

Ill leave you with this. I haven't shopped at GameStop in over 5 years, yet I have tens of thousands of dollars in GME stock. It sometimes is a simple as finding value in something undervalued. 

GME was priced for bankruptcy. They will not go bankrupt. Their bond pricing made that clear when it jumped from 70 to par. When i bought GME at $6 i realized they were trading at 50% less than what they had per share in cash alone. Vastly undervalued. Market ascribed $0 value to the company and its brand. Turned out to be an easy 100% gain which only took a few weeks.  Now it looks like it might be a 10x and more if I keep holding.

And i'm still probably not going to be buying anything from GameStop.

I get it and that is the stereotype. But my point is that broadly, that isn‚Äôt the reality of the situation across the country based on the numbers provided by the IRS.

I wasn't be snarky. You were being snarky by implying that CNN are the only ones calling the race (when it's actually literally everyone). 


Races don't become official when someone concedes. Trump could refuse to concede until January, and he'd be dragged out of the white house. Concessions are ceremonial. 


You are right that it isn't official official until the electoral college actually does their little thing in December. But that process is locked in and a technicality at best. 

The situation with Al Gore isn't comparable. Florida was the only state gore needed to win, and gore called a recount as per state law, as it was so close. The situation now is that Trump needs to overturn like 4 fucking states to win, and he's trying to do it with lawsuits.
That's quite the bold move without verifying. What if his wife looks like lizzie velasquez.
I did buy those and sold when it was at 1500%. Still happy about that but man, what could have been
Easily? You driving a lambo bro?

Because a bunch of Dems are pumped about their candidate winning and for some reason think that means the market will be pumped enough to rocket past ATH too.

No one is arguing that it‚Äôs a good policy; we just had to explain to you that nothing about it was unique to Trump. Looks like you still need a lot more explained to you.

Hey it‚Äôs your tendies
My GE puts last week are a prime example - GE had ok earnings, but company is still a hot mess.  Had a run that a lot of people thought was unwarranted.   Fucking pos following the market up over 8 bucks a share!   Should have just followed the overall market sentiment
It is so unsurprising that they are ones wrapped up in that.

Never mind NIO.  The tendies are in TSLA puts.  The gig is up.  EV‚Äôs are dime a dozen.

How realistic is NIO 50 EOW
I worked construction in the summers in college on the concrete crew as a finisher. Our co was small and used illegals to help on pours and they were all paid with cash. We couldnt find any locals to work and these boys stepped up. So when I say illagals get cash thats where the idea comes from.

$DKNG's going to gap up this week, tons of catalysts between new state approvals, earnings, Biden's arrival (Trump was working against online betting). I have a feeling its earnings on Friday are going to open a lot of eyes, could easily be a $60 stock by EOM.
Yolod on calls Friday and tomorrow is set to blow my dick off

I got 14k of buying power on ibkr but it never lets me actually use more than my cash balance. Idk whats up lol
Big tech will now be 100% free to bleed the country dry (they probably were under Trump too, there was just a minor chance he'd actually manage to hurt them). Also likely more free trade deals. Plus Biden may institute a nationwide covid lockdown which, as we learned in spring, turned out to be pretty great for the big names.

Neither have combustion auto makers. All intel can do is lose market share by Amd or hope to earn it back. No growth possibilities especially with AMDs recent acquisition they will start losing data center share as well. AMD can/could beat intel and NVDA at what they do for the same company.

Hell yeah, I love to hear that

How can a company with no production be valued so high? Isn't this just a mix of Nikola and Tesla in play here? I mean they have infinite money (Chinese Govt) but a lack of actual roll-out. I guess I don't get it. Maybe Deeply OTM Leaps to just lever in.

As much as I want SPY ATH - a lot of states are hitting covid case ATH - I can‚Äôt help but think if in some states like Ohio 5k people a day are getting covid it‚Äôs going to start impacting some earnings down the line.

My options portfolio, what would you do in my position:

Have:
- 2 X PLTR 10c 1/21/22 up 100%
- 5 X F 10c 1/21/22 break even 
- 2 X RKT 30c 12/17/21 up 50%
- 2 X RKT 25c 3/19/21 up 60%
- 2 X RKT 25c 12/18/20 up 10%
- 5 X ICLN 25c 11/20/20 down 10%

Tomorrow‚Äôs Moves:
Enter 5 X PLTR 15c 11/20
Enter 3 X ACB 13c or 15c 11/20
Enter 3 X NIO 45c or 50c 11/20
It‚Äôs not at $30 right now but I‚Äôd image it hits $23 tomorrow

RIGL 5c 3/19 that have an immunomodulatory drug that also helps block the immune system reaction and hyper coagulation .  It is  already approved by FDA for something else so they get to skip the phase I trial.  Two phase II trials already going.   Starting phase 3 this quarter.  

Given  a positive result in any of the phase II trials, it can be used immediately for off label use.   The phase III trial is for approval so the company can market it.  The company can not legally help get the word out until it is approved by FDA.  However, this is not going to be something that doctors' are likely to miss.   Calls are  cheap.  Its a small cap so even moderate interest will cause it moon, unlike the big pharma colossi who's stock rise at about the speed glaciers advance.

I think you under estimate some of the people here. There are a handful
Democrats love killing bad guys overseas. Obama did it, Clinton did it, it's just what they do.  PLTR makes it possible. Plus they are helping track the covid over in the UK. I don't know if they are doing it in the US, but it sounds likely. The US is experiencing record spikes in recorded cases and all of those need contact tracing.

11/13 gang let's go!!!
What were your plays?
Thanks!
I know for certain if I sell my puts tomorrow the market will correct Tuesday or Wednesday. Therefore I must hold and accept the risk of them going worthless
Yes
Switch to puts if you‚Äôre playing VIX
‚Äú Biden the bull‚Äù
This is beautiful in a way, just one single pattern downward
I just want my vxx calls for Friday to make a comeback
Yes

Picking up some puts while they are dirt cheap just to hedge a bit, profits will be nice if these futures stay would be stupid to not hedge to cover my cunt ass

Should I sell more NIO naked puts, or try timing the top and sell a FD Nio naked call? Decisions, decisions.

$50,000 invested at $2/share means 25,000 shares. Current price is $41.63, so that's over a BILLION USD. I call bullshit. No way you'd get a nonchalant text and no way would he still be holding.
uh oh
This may or may not have me aroused.
So will Nio gap up or drill after earnings, 50c or 35p? I highly doubt it stays flat

People who think presidents control the stock market are pretty retarded anyway. They can affect it slightly with fiscal policy and a general sense of stability, but the fed and other banks, as well as funds and corporations, have a much larger effect.


Anyone who votes for an incumbent president solely because "their 401k is doing well" is a straight dumbass. Bottom line.
No complaints here. Tell that to Biden and Kamala
consensus was dumb. Biden has managed to stay in power in Delaware, where ~70% of F500 companies are incorporated, for half a decade. You don't do that without sucking some major corporate dick.

That and with both the house and the president putting on pressure he could very easily look like an ass if he keeps blocking everything. Joe doesn‚Äôt need his signature on the cheques to approve stimmy. Could 100%be wrong but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hate to break it to YOU mate, but illegal immigrants both

A. Pay taxes either through tax ID numbers or borrowed social security numbers (https://www.businessinsider.com/how-illegal-immigrants-pay-taxes-2012-3)

B. Don‚Äôt get stimulus checks

Also, if this guy is from outside the US they‚Äôre probably getting more assistance from their government than we are.
If it crashes in the morning hard down to like 4 or 5, I will probably pick up some $6 leaps for sure.  If it beats and has good earnings and hasn‚Äôt crazy mooned in the AM, I might dip my toes in there as well.  However I am not holding a single position in it going into tomorrow because risk/reward was shit.
Ya, I'm surprised how little this sub is aware of SE and its monstrous growth
Mainly stability. Trump could do anything at any time
Nio maybe tesla nope
Umm the ideal time to invade Taiwan is October. Can‚Äôt do it during the winter because of the bad weather. Next year I give it decent odds to happen however. Won‚Äôt spark WWIII though, only a localized fight that Taiwan will lose and probably us too after they destroy a carrier

Hey man, it‚Äôll be ok. Let me help you. Put in 25K and yolo tqqq and spy calls tmmr. You‚Äôll make it back to 60K at least. Trust me, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing tmmr.
It wasn‚Äôt this bullish around here until futures went live. Can‚Äôt argue with what they are showing. DXY about to lose $92 and we will be rocketing towards 400.
Why? What makes this week extra retarded?

I mean you can clearly see how much the market cared about COVID on any yearly chart for any ticker on earth.
Haven‚Äôt even looked at launch games but I heard Xbox‚Äôs will be better so guess I‚Äôm buying that

Wonder how people would react if this was like small pox or other shit we don't have to worry about anymore. People weren't freaking out back then and shutting everything down even with a disease way worse than covid.

I'm bullish on Covid. We hit about 130k new cases on Friday, but I'm still all in on calls. I'm thinking I'll cash out around 200k per day, then puts will probably print after that.
25k in AMZN calls have been printing BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Chances i double this tomorrow?

Pump the breaks when the RSI on SPY > 70-75. Not even close to that currently.

The companies reporting on Monday are Canopy and Aurora in the morning, and Tilray after the bell. Aurora has had a terrible 2020 so far in a year where pot consumption is up massively, with flat revenues and some major acquisition costs that nuked a couple of quarters for them. Tilray has missed EPS four times in a row and has had flat revenue for a year, although they've managed to cut costs by slashing their workforce. Unfortunately, you can't fire your entire work force, so their earnings will miss by pretty much the same as last time. Canopy is the closest to being on target, but they acquired a BUNCH of businesses in the last few months and those acquisitions must be payed for. And their revenues are flat to slightly down, too.

Fundamentally, these companies suck. They are in an ultra-competitive industry where everyone basically makes the same product, it's a fairly niche market compared to alcohol, and most of them are poorly managed. They need to downsize in a big way and stop going for growth. Vaping is rapidly becoming unpopular, and teen marijuana use is down enormously everywhere that its legal, so they are going to lose their future customer base. Oh and don't forget that legalization in the united states (which isn't coming in the next four years, by the way) will actually do nothing for these companies since it will be American companies making and selling the marijuana. Canadian pot stocks are trash. DO NOT BUY for long term growth. Buy them on a dip and sell in the run up to earnings.

Also, weed flavoured beer is is stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard of in my life. On that alone I would short Canopy, let alone their dogshit fundamentals.
üêª and fuk. Name a more iconic duo
Xpeng backed by Alibaba and Foxconn gives me confidence to buy the leaps. I hope the price doesn‚Äôt go up before the market open. I do believe Nio and Xpeng will go up a lot tomorrow.

Do you guys think Spy will hit 400 Buyden of next week?
Doubling time is a about a month at current. 200k by December if nothing changes. Might actually be ahead of that rate.
I just hope it holds long enough for me to get out of my MJ leaps that have been printing. We are hitting a new record for COVID hospitalizations on Wednesday or Thursday, Senate reconvenes tomorrow so McConnell will throw some water on any stimulus hopes before Biden is seated.
I think you need to consider the possibility that Trump‚Äôs lawsuits get some traction on Monday and market starts dropping in the afternoon. At least one of the lawsuits can very well win by merit.

Agreed it‚Äôs concerning considering DXY levels. S&P pushed much higher, the coin much higher, gold and silver haven‚Äôt made their move. I think it‚Äôs possible DXY bounces again unfortunately and delays the inevitable death another week or two. It‚Äôs also possible that since I started typing this silver went from $25.80 to $31 lol. That shit does not fuck around when it decides to move up or down. Once DXY gets away from $92.20 we will have our answer.

Market doesn‚Äôt stop. There is always trading going on somewhere else in the world. Like is Asia/Australia  right now/soon. You don‚Äôt really think that prices will be waiting for US markets to open, right? 

You can check current price of your stocks at markets.businessinsider.com

Pre market in US opens at 4am. Depending on which trader you use, hours will differ. 4am for Webull, 7am for TD, 9am for Robinhood. You can buy at that time. When you do, you need to use limit order as market orders only fill during market hours (9.30am-4pm).
A 20-30% adjustment does not sound unlikely. But not next week. Next week it's going up,, especially that nice and tight squeeze right before earnings
Mango can‚Äôt even climb into the ring by himself
NIO‚Äôs market cap is 1/7 of TSLA‚Äôs market cap...to get to just 1/2 of TSLA‚Äôs market cap would put NIO at 150...so there‚Äôs definitely room to run
There‚Äôs like a huge difference between delivering 5 thousand or even 10 thousand cars and delivering for ALL OF CHINA. The only thing driving the stock is pure unadulterated speculation.

Compare the balance sheet of ACB to APHA or GTBIF.

ACB is a fucking dumpster fire of a company. The stock is currently around $1.00 before their 1:12 reverse split.

APHA has been taking market share from ACB/CGC for the last few Qs and their MC isn't much higher than ACB's.

Its called global optimism; A phenomenon rarely seen.
That‚Äôs how FOMO works
Algos in shambles
My nilla
These COVID numbers literally spike every few weeks and make all the headlines. I'm sure in a week or two the numbers die down again. 

Like it's been since June.
Buy puts while they are cheap, honestly though it‚Äôs not about bull or bear. It‚Äôs about making dough, and buying them when they are free as fuck is good good
At open
Just lock in your profits, don't try to time the top.
I‚Äôd like it to go to ATH and then crash down 20% :| or just crash down 20% without reaching ATH
How do I sleep with such a giant erection
Fear money make no money.
But Spy calls at open or is it too late ?
Good luck man. Stop whimpering at your losses. 
Coke up for breakfast. Take your losses to the chin, and then bet it all on black.
Sold NIO $44 calls expiring this week. Gonna have to buy those suckers back
DUK too please
LMAO I just checked my parent's Schwab account (I'm still linked as a former custodial account despite being 25 yr old) and see that my parents dropped a few hundred shares into SPY shorts.
It sure was juicy
Maybe Trump says no. That‚Äôd be interesting.
Sike
Glad I loaded up on them
Fk I hate this shit. Most of the gains are accounted for by the time the market opens. Sitting here like a fucking cuck, unable to do shit lmao. Anyone else tortured by this?
What time is this conference call tomorrow
It cannot gap up if there‚Äôs no gap to fill because it‚Äôs ath duh bro ban yourself

Na Tesla some old shit, needs to get over $450 before ppl start giving a shit about it again.

Biden is the most appropriate president to be in office when SPY hits 420... for numerous reasons.

That will depend on when you take profits
Tbh, I'm gonna miss Trump's thicc mango ass on cam tho
I sold Amzn stock on Friday. I‚Äôm so stupid.
Damn you got a lot of pent up aggression lol
I'll probably sell at open think 50% loss
Nope, JB called for healing and unity.  Haven't we learned that laws don't apply to people in that level of gvmnt?
I really appreciate the political talk ban here now, shit is so much more fun when we just talk about how much money we are losing
I hate this market lol #PutsRFuk
Can someone ban this idiot?
Buy some 70c
Free market capitalism
You care to explain or what ?!
Bought calls a couple weeks ago. Selling Tuesday at 3:30 before earnings. Hoping it hits $25 by then.

Anybody remember how much GME weeklies went up after the Microsoft news?
NIO is a better play
Stimmy on the way before Christmas? Bunch of green adult toys.
I have some lawyer friends that have been reviewing the fraud evidence and one of them even knows someone working on the Trump campaign. They are saying the case for PA, AZ, and GA is AIRTIGHT. We are 100% on course for a 2nd terma
Vaccines looking good.  Presidency looks pretty stable.  COVID being COVID.  Gonna have to push stimulus if these senators aren‚Äôt trying to get voted out in January.  

Bullish AF
I have to admit I‚Äôm impressed by your consistency. That‚Äôs a solid trend line, and I don‚Äôt even do TA
Yes
Definitely Mango. Mango's too thicc
Why not both ?
Good point but I‚Äôm always skeptical of the market. I‚Äôm only buying calls as of late but I know that there will likely be a big drop eventually and I will get burned, badly

Edit for misspell
NIO is up 1000% since May and 100% in the past 30 days... stupid gamble to think it has another 150% in it.
No one. Like 2bags of pudding sloshing around.

that's a pretty ignorant statement, FV is $12? what hat did you pull that out of?

"unusual volume" they had fucking earnings and it sucked because of contraints; once they get that cleared they are golden to print tendies as they sell more LTHM. they are the best company primed to meet lithium demand before a Biden presidency which will try to push EV's

* - I missed this somehow even [read me](https://www.tipranks.com/news/livent-pops-15-on-lithium-joint-venture-tesla-contract-extension/), this company has nothing but upsdide, fucking $12 fv
Nah but I'd futures hold we may see it open 44+
I am here for this.  Only so my calls may print
Now the question everyone will have to ask themselves tomorrow at open will be: "is this dip the start of a sell-off or just some profit taking before rocketing back up?"
True
Mango is gambling away his only shot at a pardon by Joey B. by not conceding. He truely is one of us. NIO $100+ EOW.
Is JKS a good play tomorrow?
Congrats on making 8 days. I already lost :(
I can get behind this

Ok let's go
NO NO NO MY 11/8 QQQ puts WTF IS HAPPENING!!!???
hope you actually did it. futures running. you would have been printing.
Whisper it to me slowly baby.
I'm pretty sure ACB has disappointed every quarter...LOL
Well that‚Äôs the beauty of options, 5k could easily turn into the money for a lambo
It‚Äôs okay. Just got to wait for that eventual MEWE IPO.  Seems like the next big social network.  At the very least every conspiracy rabbit hole is moving there which means those followers are going there as well.  It may be the first real competitor Facebook will face since they took on MySpace.
Then you‚Äôll have a loss carryforward assuming you realized those losses. It will apply to future gains to prevent taxes. Can put 3k a year of it against your income also to reduce income and thus taxes on wages.
Apple profit taking will bring the market down. Recall early September. Apple goes down, it takes everything with it. Just a decent dip. Not a crash by any means.
I'm starting to think only having 4 Nio calls was a mistake, I need moar
Guys I bought 55$ nio calls expiring two weeks out, either I'm a genius  or completely retarded
Earnings tomorrow afternoon I think.
I‚Äôm deeply worried for NIO call holders. When I see this kind of optimism it *always* worries me
Oh shit this new 60 minutes is talking about US vaccine distribution efforts and they‚Äôre talking about how it‚Äôs all being done with Tiberius...which is Palantir!!. Callssssss
I DECLARE CORPORACY. For tax purposes.

I love reading these posts, but all I do is read books
NIO or FOMO..
Nah never seen it this bullish in here, maybe that time in the summer where we had like 12 green days in a row but that's it
Thoughts on ACB earnings tomorrow? I‚Äôve heard they are gonna beat expectations. 

How about thoughts on weed stocks in general? 

Also think Palantir is gonna take over the world.
 FB and GOOG FOMO for daddy plzz

Edit- This is my life don't be mad at me sexualizing stonks plz
None because the average account is below 5k!
Take a time-out. Buy every dip on high-quality stocks. Literally all there is. Every dip, we bounce.
Eva Lovia
we fucking outsmarted the algos and MMs LOL
Personality wise yes, but as it relates to the market, not really. Regardless of what you think, this move you would have happened whoever won. You‚Äôd just see different sectors move up more or less depending on who won. Clean energy, for example, will be up big tomorrow.
Thanks for supplying this undervalued market with more free money ;)
Their market access expanded 20% with 3 new states that legalized gambling last week. DKNG branding efforts will get majority of those millions of new customers
3 weeks ago I said fuck weed stonks but now I‚Äôve got 3k shares, how are we looking tomorrow boys
Anyone else remember the NASDAQ commercials from a year or so ago using Luckin as the featured company listed there?  Those sure disappeared quickly.
Because of Biden?  That news was priced in since Tuesday; Wednesday AM at the latest
not yet. if it's up 500 maybe..

I've been telling people to short VIX since last week. It crashed from 40 to 24 in 5 trading days with more to go.
Do you even know what the hell that means? Lmfao
I never open anything at market open. Its way too chaotic. Yeah thats usually the biggest move, but you get cucked so often that it doesn't matter. IV is also generally highest at open too. You'll probably catch more good opens by holding overnight, but ymmv.
Doesn‚Äôt ACB crashes after earnings?
Been like this since May

I literally work for UPS dipshit. I know the company better than you. We massively outperformed in Q2 and everyone loves our new CEO. We were operating at Christmas peak over the summer. Amazon is our least profitable and largest customer.
Can someone explain to me why Wall Street wanted a Biden win ?
And they said these NIO 11/20 70c wouldn‚Äôt print üòÇ. These are gonna by ITM by Friday
You‚Äôre right. I do, usually. This was unexpected and I just decided to let it play out. 

Longer version, I‚Äôve been out since Sept 2nd. Watched the tech crash and the clean up, finally decided to bye back in. Dumb me, I forgot to hedge. 

It‚Äôs fine. But annoying.
Alright, we have to start calling him Jackpot Joe like that guy said. Sleepy Joe is no more
Any bears left? Or am I the only one left alive.

Market going up faster than covid #s
Gonna call it now, due to huge surge of activity of people desperately trying to sell puts and huge volume of calls that are going to be bought, RH app gonna crash at open
I'm thinking no way it crashes quite like last time at least.  Then it had already ran up crazy high.  This time it's the opposite, beaten down to hell.

I bought NIO at $13.42. I only put a small amount in though since I figured if they become the next TSLA, this few amount would turn huge.

If you're taking loans, you can't afford it. Fair enough, you gambled that you would be able to make enough money after you graduated to more than cover the loans. The US government (i.e., all of us taxpayers) should not be covering your gambling losses. I understand that this is the system we are in and the government, by guaranteeing student loans, has blown the price of college tuition sky-fucking-high. I get it.
But that doesn't mean I should be on the hook to "forgive" your loans. Until we accept the pain of the bad decisions we have made in the past, we do nothing to improve our future.
Futures are as green as all the votes that were counted for Uncle Joe.

Just buy, I tried selling some covered calls a while back, but got bored of waiting for them to expire.
not even trump can stop this market from going up
How do you decide which plays to make if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
not gonna lie, readin through all these shitposts, this is **exactly** what I always pictured irrational exuberance to look / feel like. makin me scared as fuk for da calls
Amex RAT has entered chat.

But again, I sold 16 puts on Thursday and Friday.

Ooooh, I missed that one. RIP that dude.
Do these morons realize nio was under $2 in February? It‚Äôs going to have a major crash.

Getting puts while they are cheap might be some genius shit, or fucking stupid who knows
Dementia man
anybody that tells you that you can pick and choose which ticker will go up and down is lying. It's a gamble.

Real talk.
You're supposed to have planned exit points. If you lose X amount, you're out. If you gain Y amount, you're out.

It's harder with options, since when they go bad they tend to blow past my loss point. But I sell it the best I can.

It won't be the top unless you buy calls.
Thinking of NIO 1/15/21 100c
I usually wait for 30 mins in the morning before making any trades. But I feel I‚Äôm missing out on quite a good chunk of money by doing so. How do you‚Äôll identify trades to make at market open? ü§îü§îü§î
it's not the top, the top was Sept 2nd
Its like gold but used to help make teslas calls on that shit!
Is xpeng gonna jump alongside nio? It‚Äôs like nio‚Äôs bastard step child who is kept in the basement chained to the radiator. No love

What‚Äôs the limit? Haha I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what that term meant until I just googled it. Still pretty new. I always thought it just meant ‚Äúgo up‚Äù üòÇ
It's mooning on the anticipation of a gridlocked government. Markets aren't caring about the presidency, they're looking at the Senate. My position are all bullish, but I'd be wary about the runoff elections.
[deleted]
He profits before $50 on the option play.  Ideally NIO goes up a few bucks tomorrow and he unloads those options on some other poor bag holder who is dreaming of +50 by the end of the week for several hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars.

That said, $50 strike that expires in 5 days is retarded.  OP should have bought closer to being in the money.
Hunter definitely got that big dick of his from Joe cause Joe is bringing that big dick energy to the market right off the bat baby.  Calls are going to print big.

I have 5k to put in a weekly, what should I get? Give it to me

Put/call ratio are over 2.0 since last thursday if I remember. So market will be green for a few days to milk those, then its red time for a little when the ratio is back under 1.5 probably
I'm cash gang right now, feels bad
I agree dude I‚Äôm not here trying to spread Canadian propaganda haha don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm just saying the people that bought the run up to legalization got hammered. Look at ACB‚Äôs 5 year chart lol
I just need someone to tell me this isn't the top, and if I buy calls tomorrow, I'll be ok...
NIO was one of the top ten talked about stocks even in 2019 I believe, would‚Äôve made bank if you went all in at any point then

nothing ever goes wrong with a stock that goes up 1000% in a literal straight line. that being said, my dad wanted to drop a ton of money on nio when it was around $1. i told him china stocks were the devil's taint.
But who's listening now?

It seems like an analytical company for customers who spare no expense in what they need. Theres a lot of companies that will pay for that but they seem so dependent on getting contracts that its hard to put a value on what the company should be priced at.
I agree the revenues are impressive, but I still think the stocks have priced it all in. Everyone‚Äôs raving about ACB but look at the 5 year chart. People who bought back when we were on the verge of legalization got destroyed
we bulls are all counting our money! that's got me worried how bullish it is in here. just like how bad it was on thursday night being down -2% and opening green

UPS ATH was 178$. and they cant operate on "christmas peak" in the summer quarters. it was high because of new ceo, new direction, amazon collaboration, peak hiring numbers and this pandemic forcing people to limit contact. fedex was up too during pandemic, and they dont even have the collaboration with amazon. whatever you thought was the christmas peak with the underlying UPS stonk, you are about to be slapped with reality when it goes up. 170$ is very conservative of me, coz this thing is 180$ by december guaranteed.

People worse masks and distanced in line, and they gave us disposable styluses so we didn't have to touch the screen.


But then also they like made everyone fill out a form on clipboards with pencils that were just being passed around and not cleaned. Legit tens of thousands of people sharing the same pencils. 


Overall, there's definitely a uptick in cases due to voting. You can't have millions of people gather to vote across the country without spreading the rona to some extent.

Four years of fear and physical tension have left your wife‚Äôs body, and a bottle and a half of red wine has entered it. Suddenly, she mutes the TV and grabs at your blue jeans‚Äîlike she hasn‚Äôt since before the kids were born.

You edge away on the couch, laughing at her, but she persists like a dutiful ballot counter. You can taste the wine when she kisses you, and you want to want this moment. But can‚Äôt. All you can think about are the puts you bought. You doubted America. You doubted the rightness of the agony this beautiful woman had been in for four years. You don‚Äôt deserve to take part in her celebration.

As she fails to conjure your evaporated manhood, she sighs and falls asleep on your chest, each slow breath in rhythm with each uptick in Futures.

only have way otm calls. im so bearish im bullish
i did but way OTM calls so I have a lot of room - they're CCs too so I just do it to gain a little bit of cash flow
Thats what I want to know.
No a couple calls with a delta of 330 altogether. Already ITM so number should keep increasing

How good was the social distancing in the line ups to vote?  many masks?  I seem to have been early switching to cash gang, looking at futures.  From worldometer it seems new covid19 cases were up 34% comparing last sunday to today.  Median time from exposure to symptom onset is 5 to 6 days, so I was worried about a surprisingly large number of new cases tomorrow

Biden win, with divided congress/senate was best possible outcome for markets.
Bears can‚Äôt have kids, they can only adopt them.
The day is young moron. 

If anything they could be correct. This green will just make those who said that doubt their convictions, once they've faltered the market will go down. This is how you trap Biden bears and permabulls.

(Future) taxes count. We can get into the detailed merits, which I think the Canadian one probably is better for the **average** person because America's system is .5 payers and screw over anyone who's not insured, while introduces a bunch of billing nightmares. 

Orthogonally, I think often if it's a life or death situation, you are better off dying for the better of society and maybe even your loved ones because if your survive with a lot of disabilities, it's going to be expensive.

Anyways, I think if you are in the top 10-1% you are better off with private healthcare if you know what help you need.
It‚Äôs been an honor serving with you, sir.

How do I invest in Parler? Numba one app in the US. Above TikTok!
Was on the wrong side of the trade early last week.  Kept telling myself that this pump is unsustainable, but every day I'm proven wrong.  Held calls over night Thurs. -> Friday and lost money, pussied out and went cash over the weekend.

I mean is it just time to admit we're back to easy mode and just buy calls?  I mean I see we're nearing the bottom of the '08 Bull Market Trendline that Trump broke in '18.  Seems logical that Biden would pop us back up over the top but didn't expect it to happen in two weeks...

Holy fk Parler is overloaded lmfao. Calls
Let's make a list stupid memes on WSB that are weirdly, actually true.

1) The market crashes every time Trump brags about it on Twitter. This one has like a 100% success rate.

2) lil yachty prophecy. This one has like a 95% success rate, which is fucking weird.


3) "market doesn't care about the rona" also true.
Why do that when you can just buy a meme stock like NIO

You sign up to the discord which has a bunch of useful channels. Plays show if it‚Äôs a call/put, volume, interest, bid/ask, IV %, % difference, and underlying price. You can generally figure out good plays from the volume and interest and hedge plays are pretty obvious for the most part. The general chat on the discord is nice too, people have decent ideas and strategies.
Depends on age and responsibilities I guess
I hope this stays this high so I can buy puts tmr
Did I fucking stutter? I asked whats the damn price around february, I know I am a pussy but you can change that by telling me NIO is gonna be $250 by march

Why the fuck would you buy shares of this trashcan of a company? This will rise from a short squeeze...its fundamentals are absolute garbage.

Im joking about the coffee, I didn't actually quit to be frugal. I quit drinking it during the time I think I had covid. I tried to have my morning cup one day and I just couldnt stomach it. The taste the smell just everything about it made me want to vomit. A week later and a bottle of ibuprofen later the headaches and withdrawals subsided and Ive been coffee free for almost a year. I hit a cup of tea when I want a hot drink now. The cigs I kicked with a big ass vape and it took me about 6 months to kick the vape after. Been 3 years without a cigarette or nicotine.
I built a program that did something similar to test this out a few months back, so this comment comes with some experience of the results of that experiment.

The reason it appears so profitable is because you mostly have buys and the market is bullish right now.

Long story short; buy between 70% and 80% calls and 30% and 20% puts and if you get lucky you can be rich. Trading at 100% calls always resulted in a loss (but my program always traded every day, so a smart bull could just not trade on the down days and avoid puts altogether).
I‚Äôm feeling LUCKY DKNG.

Hahahaha! Well dang. I know they‚Äôre not going anywhere, they‚Äôre establishing a presence in Vegas, and as every state drops and licenses them, they grow and grow. I figured it‚Äôd be a long(er) play, so maybe I‚Äôll back off for a surer short term payoff. Suggestions?

I‚Äôve got a ‚Äúcompany‚Äù that scoops up the sticky stuff under the stairs at rental apartment properties and we repackage it as ‚Äútasty sticky stuff under the stairs‚Äù. We‚Äôre obviously not making a profit but we feel there is a market for an app that lists where sticky stuff under the stairs is and offers it to residents who don‚Äôt have any sticky stuff under their stairs. So far investors have dumped $3b into this project but we feel this could be valued at $30b in a years time. Our financials are a little grey but we‚Äôve been approved for IPO. Ticker - STKY

A lot of people agree that you can't out exercise your diet but I'm not one of them. In my experience if you get some cardio equipment like a stationary bike (my fav). You can burn weight on command. 

I've gone from fit to fat a lot and the only adjustment to my diet is the time spent exercising instead of eating.

Alright fellas,, what $$ number would you feel comfortable quitting your job at?
Fidelity doesn't have futures unfortunately
it‚Äôs come down a tiny bit
Care to elaborate on this incentive?
So you're a business man making business decisions
Personally would stay away from ACB since they always shit the bed at earnings. CGC dangerous too but they have a deal to buy Cresco Labs which is another MSO, if the US legalizes and they are sector leader in Canada
[deleted]
You guys are irrational as fuck if you think ACB, the SHITTIEST weedstock. Let me rephrase SHITTIEST CANADIAN weedstock will continue to moon.

I guess you haven‚Äôt been around during Canadian legalization sell the news. Do you retards just think weed will be legal tomorrow now that Biden has won?! And that a piece of filth like ACB will make any impact in the UNITED STATES?! 

Tomorrow they announce earnings before market opens. I bet 70% of this sub who bought didn‚Äôt bother to even check. 

ACB bulls are going to get murdered. I bagheld this stock for a year when I first got into investing. I hope you guys understand this stock is literally jam packed with bag holders waiting to exit. NEWSFLASH that was nothing but a short squeeze and they are going to announce horrible earnings.

All time is only down a little over 3k. Most of what I lost was winnings.
Check Obama administration history. He also claimed that he is on working terms with Xinnie the Pooh.
Called it before, got down voted, but I said we gonna ride a high until the market remembers it still wants a stimmy
I hope I‚Äôm wrong
If we don't end the year above $400 I'm going to be very disappointed
Fuck I bought ACB at the top. Praying they kill it at ER and this weed momentum makes me money
Get burned shorty short

wish i could but all ik is stonks go up and put money robinhood to lose it but try r/stocks
Not only that but there's so much coming out about how their bread is basically made of sugar and was recently classed as a confectionary in Ireland. I used to go to subway in college because I genuinely thought that I could get a reasonably healthy meal when I went there to make up for the lack of a satisfying fatty taste of other fast food, but until they become as healthy as they promise they are I just don't see a reason to go there anymore
That is the economy dip shit @fuckjonhamm
It may work, unless they google the number or recognize speech patterns really depends how seriously the individual person takes their job
They were covered calls, right?  I mean...right?
ACB will shit the bed if they don't have a CPG deal ready to counter their garbage balance sheet.

For anyone wondering, look up their cash burn over the last four Qs

Second time I‚Äôve heard this in the last week
So.. will we get a dump cause no stimulus soon?
uh... did you read ANY of the large company's earnings reports and further watch their stock price.

Edit- Nm, you deserve to lose your money or watch it slowly grow in the next bull run
Hope we can fade and open bigly green and not humongous green so I can ride the wave. If weed stocks aren‚Äôt up 50% that is

Trulieve TRUL, Green Thumb GTI, Curaleaf CURA, Cresco Labs for MSOs. VFF as a grower, CGC as industry leader, APHA as underdog, ACB and TLRY been going off. Terrascend as a dark horse.

ACB & TILRAY both are declaring earnings tomorrow. CGC is delisting from NYSE and switching to NASDAQ to save money. Tomorrow will be a make or break moment for pot stocks.

I have positions too, but they will fuck it up probably

I made my dad $150K or so via NVAX.  I told him it seemed like a promising company for a vaccine back in March and wasn't expecting him to take me seriously.  He bought 1500 shares at $10 and sold 500 at $180 and 500 at $120.  He's still holding the remaining 500.  I didn't have the heart to tell him I pussied out and sold most of my 50 shares when it was like $30.

The only thing is, it can go horribly wrong very very quickly - if it gaps up 5-10% suddenly (which it most certainly can do during dumps) it can blow up your account instantly. Been there and boy I felt terrible

Biden can suck my left nut
AAPL buys them in 2025 in an all-cash deal at 69,000. Stock and call holders rejoice. :rocket:
I lost my dad 4k this year
I mean if it came down to just one state (like PA), there might be atleast a chance he could pull some kind of fuckery. But if you need to flip like 5 states with a signficant enough margin that recounts won't do shit, its over unless you try to stage a coup d'etat. And I'm not seeing that he has support for that.

I'm convinced this individual has a bearish position and is trying to make himself feel better before the ass rape bears are going to get this week.
I will be ecstatic if RKT finally jumps like I have been hoping. I bought $1500 in calls 6 weeks ago and watched them take a shit until the last week. Now I'm only down $500. I know it ain't big money but I want to at least get my first 2 or 3 bagger.

I don‚Äôt think you can simply dismiss the significant increase in the amount of people ready and willing to take up a rifle and point it at another American to serve the will of an egomaniacal autocrat, that there‚Äôs been since trump. It‚Äôs not just a few fringe groups here and there. Do you have a lot of conservative friends on social media? It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôd know how many there are just walking around the store. You can find threads of people all agreeing they‚Äôre ready to ‚Äúshoot their way out‚Äù of socialism. That threat is invented by Trump, so he has the power to say when the shooting starts. You‚Äôre really underplaying it. To reiterate‚Äî I‚Äôm not paranoid anything is going to happen in the next 4 years. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs very likely somebody who wants to take up Trump‚Äôs ideological banner and follow in his footsteps will get elected, so the threat of a real insurgence is super small. But problem is the concept has been proven and is now ready to be implemented for an indefinite time.

Went to the mall today and that shit was packed like a Black Friday! Calls on SPG for earnings!!!! Do it trust me!

When Trump concedes this shit is going to Mars.
Yeah investing in straight up commodity producers is probably the worst way to play legalization, IMO.

If we have another 5% day tomorrow I'll record a video of myself busting a nut on a printer
The markets love the gridlock.

There will be a January special election for 2 senate seats. If democrats take 2 seats then it's 50/50 split. At which point VP is the tiebreaker.

Market wouldn't like that. Although it might mean a lot more stimulus, it could mean stuff like green new deal. That and tax overhaul.

You'd likely see the great rebalancing too.
Shit, no doubt spy gonna open 360...those with balls holding calls thru weekend congratz and fk u

Cash gang atm..
Said it before and ill say it again. RKT will tank after earnings. It wont go over $22 during the "run up" either.
Some ex stripe employee just said their shares are being re-evaluated to $20ish. Guess what else is $20ish.
i would have done 41c 11/13 and 45c 11/27 but you're fine either way :)
What happens if we all keep buying NIO calls? Balls deep man...
Your gonna wanna puke after you see it shoot up 5% when they unveil their silicon chips
I got like 6 call credit spreads as a hedge.... lesson learned, never hedge.

Seems unlikely
Resistance? Nah we gapping over that shit.
RKT gang rise up.   Fuck you bears you stupid fucks.   Get blazed
No discrimination against pussy!
10% ain‚Äôt bad. I was down 12% Friday alone. Good luck my G, rooting for you ü§û
Thats cuz you will probably never lose that 5$ bill again. But you probably will lose another 5000$ again.

I've been having an itch to lose some money. I'm in.
I owned 300 shares at $1.50. I sold them at $4.50 for a decent profit. Wish I had held. Didn't think they'd explode the way they have.
AAPL $250

Some big timer just put 500k on ML
25c locked and loaded
keep trying....That shit is from 2013.  You have the wrong kind of autism.
I'm not saying I think it's going to happen. I'm just saying Fed action this year has been truly unprecedented. How long can it realistically last? Hopefully, until we get a reliable vaccine. If not, uh oh.
Nobody cares about COVID
Bought 1000 at absolute fucking bottom $9. So pumped lesss go!!

That will be tomorrow on their earnings report.
Genuinely question, are there any other companies that specialize in what Palantir does? I just watched a video explaining what they do but I'm still confused. Is this the the next analytical company of our future?
Will Biden replace Jerome like Trump did to Yellen? ü§î
I need something to pump up VIX.
Biden win means less oil from US. Which means less global supply and higher prices.
Respek
funny all you ACB boys prob dont know its history. massive scam company that fucked all shareholders over massively. they can easily tank on earnings tomorrow, im honestly curious wtf will happen
People can see into the future using something called futures vision
I'll put that in fellow autist. Also the Cramer prediction that Biden win is bullish for RKT, even before Biden was projected to win
How vsto had a killer week. Ill buy shares. I have lost a dumb amount on options.
Except it costs millions to drill for oil. Where is the incentive to drill. And what do you do with the natural gas that comes with it?
CGC
And how do u feel brother? Is it a big piece of your portfolio?
Its a app
As an Aussie let me explain 
Our markets are mostly financials (banks) and resources (mining), we have very little tech compared to US. This is why we dont get down as hard usually and dont go up as much usually. So maybe take your opinion and flip it upside down like Australia and you might be more correct
C. Buy calls
[deleted]
Bears praying for a civil war. Disgusting, you monsters.
At least wait until Biden locks down the entire country for 3 months after a vaccine is announced because he doesn't know wtf is going on
Nice looking triple top forming on the 3 month, hope you bulls break through
Shorting the vix whenever it‚Äôs >50 is easy money

holy shit.

anyone else in PLTR?
My hypothesis is it doesn't matter until it does. New localized lockdowns with impacts to unemployment and GDP
Trump was lying to us about Sleepy Joe. He knew markets would rip and didn‚Äôt want to be overshadowed.
It's gonna take alot but hopefully he sees that I'm trying my best
I once lost $200 on one trade after three consecutive days of making $500+. To say I was enraged would be an understatement.
I guess I should buy some calls in the morning, which means the market will tank like it should have last week
yep

This wasn't intended as a republican talking point post. It's possible that we reinstate lockdowns. Obviously will effect the macro.

I‚Äôm holding far too many calls too. I can already see the sea of green while weed stocks are -45%.
Cases are at all time highs while deaths are still half of what they were in March

Now that Trump lost the media doesn‚Äôt need to hammer us with bleak COVID news constantly
Should have bought more calls last Friday.

As long as he‚Äôs there you can keep buying calls forever.

Thanks daddy Powell.

if ACB fucks it up, you‚Äôre fucked
Yes Apple event Tuesday
Only because it has been offset by stimulus/JPow. The second that cases surge without stimulus or extreme Fed action (if it happens), the market is plunging.
Trump going to lash out at China to distract and last punative move before he's gone. One last trade war dagger coming.

This study does a nice job of summarizing. Tbh a lot of it is driven by GOP presidents overseeing many of the recessions over the period. And FWIW, the top performing President/Senate combo over the period is actually Dem/GOP

I can bring this market to its knees in one moment by going straight long.  100% sure it will be an unprecedented crash as soon as I do.  Maddening
VIX going down fast. Won‚Äôt be financing my long call losses selling to the autists for a while.
It would be a shame if fridays pull back was a red flag for the future, but with the election being over it might moon. Trump will probably reject corona virus relief again and again and this play will get fucked by timing most likely.
Imagine getting to stick your dick inside his sexy green ass

I think the big thing is having a national strategy rather than letting some states with retarded governors spread it everywhere while others actually take measures for mitigation.
Theta gang is vastly overrated. I've lost most money in my theta plays.
I own some ATVI so it‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll probably be down tomorrow

I don't think PLTR is a bad stock right now, but I doubt the earnings is going to blow anyone away. The main criticism of PLTR is that they spend a lot and don't make any real revenue yet. I mean, all the more pop if you're right, but I haven't seen anything that makes me think so.

Nope bug me a new husband
Rocket go to moon, easy
Yeah really. The market doesn't go straight up and we just had a +7% week. There's gonna be a down day or 2 in there somewhere.

Just +2% more and we'll be at ATH which is sure to make folks a little nervous. Especially with covid cases going parabolic and trump acting completely unpredictably for another 9 weeks.

PM IV bump will easily make those calls profitable.

Kind of makes sense till the run off decides who's in the senate
thats what I'm thinking instead of buying puts, some long dated VIX calls might pay off since this market is going to remain extremely volatile
It‚Äôs so amazing. For months I argued on this site with those idiots trying to remind them that the stock market has done much better under Dem presidents than GOP presidents historically. And the fact that a Dem president would likely bring a bigger stimulus

Id say the subsequent dump after his claims are taken seriously.
Nah markets are paranoid, I think they expected a civil war with mango winning or some dumb shit. Instead mango lost, sperged out a little on Twitter and wants to have his day in court. Also this is still election year, a bull market by tradition.
No but the memes are inescapable

That's not the correct currency. Same reason BABA is listed at 2,000 for next year on that site. I assume it's in Chinese Yuan.

That was just Biden euphoria. Now reality sets in. We're going down like we should
Fuck :/
Probably about year or two old seeing as the guy was low on stock and said business been slow this year, didn't ask for the box codes though.

Can some bears explain to me again why the market is going to go down?

I keep forgetting for some reason
You‚Äôre overdramatizing what I‚Äôm saying, because nobody can do what hitler did again, but you‚Äôre not respecting the level of mind control and grooming that has gone into the current state of Trump‚Äôs cult. I‚Äôm not talking about your average republican, I‚Äôm talking about the people stockpiling ammo, joining militia, publicly announcing they are on standby for Trump to ‚Äúsay the word.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think anything will be done with them, there‚Äôs no point in it anymore, but the concept has been proven and the seeds have been sown. There‚Äôs now a realistic opportunity for a future idol to take the reigns and lead that sect of far right conservatism with unabridged and uncontested power. Those people will lie dormant waiting for another leader; they spend their days literally hoping someone in a position of power will ask them to kill liberals on America‚Äôs behalf. If you haven‚Äôt been seeing this explicit threat, you‚Äôve got your eyes closed or something I don‚Äôt know. Maybe it means you‚Äôre not from anywhere with a speck of red.
Metric money. It's not real.
I read china is the # 1 consumer of these mink furs so they are fucking us again.

I do think you‚Äôre on to something. Global uncertainty is leading to a higher sense of nationalism and the economic crisis is causing nation states to be more aggressive with resources.

I do believe the next decade will bring about a conflict with China due to their cultural belief they are superior or will be superior in time. Furthermore, their economic decline will be arriving soon due to population imbalance so a strike soon would make sense if they want alter their path.
Yea definitely look into November calls

High risk, high reward. 

Always been.
remember what happened last time we went vertical, September crash after Softbank made August go vertical, then again in mid October we went vertical on stimulus talks, and now we are going vertical again bc of Softbank. Again they'll drop the bags on the retards that are going to fomo tomorrow. That being said if you bought in a week ago congrats, your a boss. But buying now is retarded even if it works

How do you play earnings for companies like NVAX and INO?
I feel like the desperation of the Koreas would be more tense but maybe not. China invading Taiwan though would incite swift actions but China also doesn't have the reason to make the move when they have the entire global economy by the balls. Wars are expensive so to do that when tons and tons of external capital is flowing into China would be a really bad idea; you want to wage your wars when things are not going great economically for you in the long-run (20+ years) and when you can't be a powerhouse.

China is big but not stupid. It would be easier for them to just quietly undermine and consume like they are with Beijing and Shanghai using propaganda.
Yes!  Larp away
Hi, i‚Äôm the manager. What can I help you with?

Not sure if I should yolo into DKNG or NIO
All in as well. I am kind of a moron and have 165 11/20 $30C's, pretty much because of your tweets. I have shares and warrants (in at the units, $21.60 avg), and longer dated calls, but I only paid $10-$20 a pop for those Novembers. Probably will be worthless in a week, but it's not a lot to lose for an insanely asymmetrical bet.
It‚Äôs Nio or nothing.

 Viagra is intended for use in men, and is unlikely to be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, Viagra is not expected to be harmful to a fetus. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with Viagra. It is unknown if Viagra passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Consult your doctor before breastfeeding.
What‚Äôs going on with nio
WE ARE AMERICANS
That dosnt matter. All the market cares about is small buisness loans n junk right now. Biden being president means no new bills for big tech and a stimulus on the way. Unless he does from old age this week, we'll  see

Will this pump affect sleepy crsr stock?
ur mom so fat when she run out of food she start 2 eet poop
This is making no fap november really hard
Shut your mouth! In Momma Su we trust.

Edit: Su goddamit.
There's always a valid reason for the market to be up a lot or down a lot which is why it's not always easy to pick the right direction. 

Had Trump won and the market was green, people would be like, well of course it's up. If the market is currently down a lot, people would say, well of course it's down a lot, Covid is still here.

If Covid cases actually dropped and unemployment went down and the market was down a lot, then it's because Biden won and the market doesn't like it. 

We're being played. The big players control this market, they don't care about your reasons why the market should be up or down. Just follow the trend and use stop losses in case you're still in when they decide it's time to reverse the trend.

So theoretically we know ACB will tank at open because of the horrible ER. However, since Biden is prez, the stock should quickly go back up and moon right?

Gonna place an order for Dow 35k hat
i'm in both NIO and fisker but they are very different tickers.

In a year NIO will either be at 100 or back at 5

Nio 60 c eow stupid?
We‚Äôre flying now baby
Futures only +0.5% by morning. Then on open, limit down.
at this rate im going to be able to buy a house

please god
Lmao at everyone who thought having a president who won‚Äôt tank the markets by throwing out random tweets and having 4 years of boring stability would somehow cause the markets to collapse
sir, that's like most of wsb
Instead of 15k in Nio leaps I wish I did 15k in Nio 11/20 I'd have a 5-10 bagger lol
im so hard right now
If you're serious it would be medicine, materials and weapons. You would actually be more impressed with materials because of the three the greatest shortage will be there followed by human capital (medicine) and then finally defense and weaponry.
I'm so happy this retarded market proved all these bears wrong about the election hahaha

Throwback to when all of the idiots on WSB thought that a Trump loss would cause the markets to tank lmao
Bears are forming a massive divergence between their butt cheeks preparing for these green dildos
buying FD calls was the best decision i‚Äôve made these last 2 months
Nah, but those VXX puts were just to cheap not to grab a handful for the hell of it!
This week is going to be so green I‚Äôm going to get tired of winning
You‚Äôre saying my TSLA 430 calls is going to print ???!!
lol. Holds 60 contracts over 400% into volatile territory - you belong here.
Sell your share and close your account while you‚Äôre ahead kid.
Limit up by 3 am at this rate
Jesus H. Christ lol we still puuumppping :) hahah 365 by open!

NIO 20p 11/13
wow god tier retard?
It's like election night every night!
DC legalized
Holy shit futures
Yeah if it‚Äôs 2% then that‚Äôs where it would be. Maybe AAPL is driving a larger share of the pump and can get us to 125. But yeah. It‚Äôs 120-125 not 125-130 but a man can dream ü§î
Fraudulent futures! VXX won by a lot! Stop the count right now! 

11/13 VXX 21C
Could be $150
Market doesn't give a shit, just that the system exists.
i feel bad, the bears are going to get a +7% open because of the new limit
NIO 100c 11/13
Sunday after JPow rammed all the bears asses

Nobody gives a fuck what Mango tweets anymore. He is old news.
Gonna need you to win 3 ban bets, post a 100k gain, and a funny meme

And why would you wanna be a mod lol
I work in an above ground copper mine (way safer than his job) and I clear 80k with OT easy. Some of our more senior guys clear 100k making like $40 an hour ish. If you‚Äôre an electrician though you can expect like 80 starting and clearing 150 within 10 years making 50+ an hour plus OT. Then we have the profit sharing bonuses of like 5-10k every February and a flat bonus of 5.5% of gross pay quarterly. And the town is owned by the company so rent is $200 a month. Mine life is easy mode
Lol naw. But it‚Äôs in my comments history. I even had one of the higher upvoted comments in the daily thread.
Hahahah facts
For a B&M store to turn digital and have investor backing to do so. For a potential 2nd wave of covid pushing more people inside to continue gaming, and a console release. Stop i think I'm gonna cum
My DM
yeah unfortunately
Joe money Biden üõ•
This week looks promising with the console releases and the new short interest number coming out.
If I have nothing else, at least I will have material proof that I was right. In the end, isn't that all that really matters?
2 weeks ago was a prime example of ‚Äúbe greedy when others are fearful‚Äù and what did you do?

Balls long shroom stocks.  Weed stocks is very 2018.  Psilocybin cures depression.  Legalization is coming.  Not tripping (wait..)
So uh that Biden stock market crash I was promised is happening on Tuesday then?
Yeah, vaccine news if the public cares and its not "vaccine talks going well" again, market seemed to respond less certainly to vaccine pumps into the pre-fall dip. 

-

If the pandemic keeps running away, I'd assume stim being confirmed would be  very green day. Timing that, even timing positive globally available vaccine release will be difficult. 

-

for *certain* events ahead in the timeline, there's dec/jan earnings. White house hand off. frenzied lead up to Christmas? I think I'm just going to wait for this "election uncertainty is gone" euphoria to end before getting in, so maybe even next week.

-

in short, I don't know man. thinking things are going to be bullish or flat for a few months.
Market is forward looking. We are pricing Donald out.
Biden Bump, Joey Jump idk. Doesn't sound as good
No stimmy talk and dollar index is down...... well that is super reassuring...
I like it.
i think that the idea is to normalize it for the inevitable time when somebody actually needs to clarify, but that's only a guess

Its amazing SPY is set to trade 356.  This past week and the next couple of weeks can be an early Santa clause rally!
 My puts are fried! It s time to go hibernation!!
Weed stocks 100%. Already making a killing. Just ETF the fuck up, let the fund managers worry about individual company performance. This is like being able to invest in alcohol companies at the breaking of prohibition. This will be one of the fastest growing industry market caps of all time. So easy a retard could get rich. already made highs WAY above where things are now, and we just got several more rec states legalized and fed decriminalization is on the table. The prices and timing couldn‚Äôt have worked out better if it was planned. 

In 2 years even more states will pass legislation for med and rec. probably going to be the easiest money of my entire life.
some quick DD: with the biden win this weekedn we can assume republicans and trump supporters will continue to push the agenda guns will be taken away. what does that mean? gun stocks will moon. not too late to get in since news hadnt broke before friday at close.

Market might be back on EZ mode again bois.

The game is simple. You already know what ATH is at for big/most of tech. 

* If not poor: buy that strike with Feb/March+ expiry (baking in at least one ER).
* If poor: debit call spread it with March expiry (baking in at least one ER).

Holding thru ATH or not will be the Q.
Worked in Australia
we opening at 360 at this rate ü§£
I guess we‚Äôre not selling the news lol
Nice DD
Only an armchair strategist. However this would be their best time to do it. The want to invade Taiwan at the least, but IDK how it could escalate after that. America is as distracted as possible (pandemic+contested election), and the longer they wait long-term (years/decades) the more India will catch up to them. So its pretty much now or never.
Went to get a COVID test the other day and even the doctor said they‚Äôre blowing this way out of proportion In the media. It‚Äôs definitely serious but it‚Äôs not like they make it seem. Do with this what you will. The only thing I know is if something really crazy happened that was as contagious but more deadly we would not be prepared.
Congratulations all us call holders will be throwing a wall street bets party tommorow

360 by open

Well there goes no nut November
Not sure, I‚Äôm looking at high volume high liquidity. Those are my moves tomorrow though. Holding 5k worth of xpev calls 35 01.15 purchased Friday at 2pm
Think that‚Äôs a good plan, unlikely we go straight up
Just wait until they find a box full of bullish futures contracts at 4am in a car trunk somewhere in Wisconsin we‚Äôll really rip
You could say that every single day for them then haha
Bottom was 323 huh
Oh yeah I forgot that chinese startups were in the NASDAQ
This is nuts
360 by this rate
There wont be a need for any im sure.  Donnie got off knowing how he could impact the market, no other president will do that
lol :) haha nice I bought in thursday at the peak... 365s 11.20s and friday cost me like 50% cause it was flat. Tmr if we open up, going to make a nice 100% ?
yeah no I won't buy into this pump, way too green, way too euphoric, feels like the late stage of a bull market tbh. I'll probably miss out on gains, but whatever

Turn that 3,2k into 320k
22 and 22.83
Hard to go wrong with anyone this week but I‚Äôm out of Nio for now I think it will get a lot of resistance before 50. PLTR is a long term hold for me, they still have a lot of corporate clients to pick up along the way but they‚Äôre definitely going to get more contracts. After playing with the GME cyclical I‚Äôm taking a break on options until I understand the extent of Biden‚Äôs tangible plans for the first 90 days

Also the Canadian companies may get hurt if the US legalizes since most of the business will shift to the US. My weed play has and will remain GRWG they are the company selling equipment to grow. These dudes were doing great 3 months ago before legalization was happening. My position is up 80% (shares only) and they are rapidly expanding by buying other great companies like Growbiz. Think of this company as like the Home Depot for weed.

Yup

Biden and Powell pumping markets together?!?!?! The markets can only handle so much GREEEEEEN!!!!!!!
I have leaps if it keeps up its rested strength, but I expect a dip before the next leg up. Going to load up on leaps
Viagra is intended for use in men, and is unlikely to be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, Viagra is not expected to be harmful to a fetus. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment with Viagra. It is unknown if Viagra passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. Consult your doctor before breastfeeding.
Seems like it booms when the market is booming and is flat when we‚Äôre drilling. So you‚Äôre prolly good

And I am sure you know none of these politicians are hurting.  They make a few hundred thousand in pay per year but are all with 10s of millions.  None of them are pan handling any time soon.

Election uncertainty is over. Market is very happy with Biden. It's going to rip hard tomorrow.
It was so obvious that putting my entire new worth plus a HELOC in TQQQ calls was the play. How could I have been so stupid? Fuck.
Yes buddy yes
I think by open the market will cool down. I have a firm conviction that the market will pullback any hour now, but I am not having fun waiting for it.

I had 80 contracts for 6 months that died in September. Every couple of weeks it creeps up but never holds past 7. The courts have delayed the buyout for so long that the original offer ($7.35/share) might no longer be valid.

Mr. Patel, I forgot to mention that criteria list is in no particular order.  
You have a good chance then.

Also, I just saw you respond that this is for a business side role.  
Therefore, my advice may not even apply.  
Good luck, let us know how it goes!

Correctly using male condoms and other barriers like female condoms and dental dams, every time, can reduce (though not eliminate) the risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis. They can also provide protection against other diseases that may be transmitted through sex like Zika and Ebola. Using male and female condoms correctly, every time, can also help prevent pregnancy.

I'm glad I sold my SPY and QQQ puts that expired Monday and Wednesday, and moved them to 11/20, and a few 11/13. Still, this potential rally tomorrow gives me knots in my stomach. When will the market pullback like they should? Tuesday and Wednesday, I hope? Do I add a bit more of puts, maybe some that expire a month from now?

I ain't got the stomach for options. I wish I just did stocks like before.

Yea i'm not sure. I don't want to miss out on a run to 360, 370, or 380. Covid news has me nervous right now, but vaccine news is imminent and should end up taking us higher. I just expected a pull back first. Might be worth to jump in now and eat the pull back if it happens, knowing that covid vaccine is looking good and should get announced in the next month.

If you believe Biden gets the increase in capital gains tax the smart thing to do is to sell equities in the current tax year at the reduced rate.

ICLN OTM leaps better
Nothing

Nothing more than smashing that buy button.
Is my leaps gonna print me now?
Yeah, I had Dominos yesterday, and was not impressed at all. Much worse than in the past.
VIX dying killed some of my leaps too in premiums. sucks but better than non stop red
Literally anything
I have a modest bet too. 50 contracts of 1/21 2.5c and 1000 shares.
Well hopefully it turns around in your favor but yeah.. I've blown up a small account daytrading 0dtes and hoping it would bounce back.   Just kept going lower and lower,  $3k, $2k, $1k, $500. A 50% loss is twice as good as a 75% loss.  Much rather take -25% than -50%.

Chinese Depositary shares hold no equity and no voting rights. If pooh-bear wants Nio to stop making cars and start selling knock-off Spice Girls albums, American investors would have no recourse. But if enough autists close their eyes, you can treat $NIO as a stock. For now.

NIO & PLTR are the plays for the next month. Grab em and watch!
Seek not logic here.... you will make yourself insane
CGC and ACB gonna nuke the entire sector in the morning
Isn‚Äôt the market just a beautiful thing! No matter WHAT HAPPENS ( even pandemic ) we just always find our way back up
Picked up some 11/20 2.5c EOD Friday for the express purpose of being able to make the above comment. Hail Mary for an earnings pop.

Lol
As serious as how the green futures are.
futures are up and so my puts should be dead by tomorrow missing :( hehe
Agreed. I don't get it much, but for $6 you're probably not getting something more satisfying.
Bro If futures keep up xpev and nio could have a 30% day and I‚Äôll shit my pants and eat it

All them germans better dump ACB before earnings

About to lose all the bear tendies I‚Äôve made all month tomorrow :,(

It's not the thing in any industry that's going to make it skyrocket. It's a part of it so it doesnt have a chance to turn into a penny stock...but it also isnt like lithium or anything. Buying the value of silver is Meh at this point. It's not going to be valuable until they start pulling back the supply to demand. Imo. But I'm also technically certifiable so .

Hello Nick
TWLO has lots of room to run check chart
Can‚Äôt beat the price
You retards are cute when you try to sound like real investors. ‚ÄúWhy did you buy that call if you‚Äôre so afraid to let it ride‚Äù because it‚Äôs a call retard. If the market corrects one day out of this monster week I can lose 50% of my value I can hold it for another month without sweating, but do I want to? Idk it‚Äôs not a fucking stock momos
Ya know losing all my money on the market would hurt less if my worthless ass could get a fucking job. Had a nice gig (that I had no business getting in the first place) and then quit because I lost my temper. I‚Äôll never get a job that pays half that ever again, and apparently can‚Äôt even get any job anyways
Too late, just spent it.
Shut the fuck up you're going to make me bust a nut
44.69
god damn. I rode most of the 8% wave this week but didn‚Äôt want to hold over the weekend. All the gaps made me nervous. But vix keeps dropping. Risk on
As a calls holder, probably
Lol these lottery ticket 362‚Äôs i got may actually be in play now
You mean (-)100%?
What nio news

Yep
Long on VIAC, ACB, APVO, buying pre-market dips, getting out a couple dollars later.
what value were you at when you peaked in that spike?
My dilemma would be holding weeklies past Monday
 Curious... how serious are y‚Äôall taking Trump right now?

ACB will not dump too much
What they do
I‚Äôm balls deep in NIO right now lmao
Would be interesting to see, and I hope we don‚Äôt find out. I‚Äôd guess an immediate jump on stimulus hype, but would be very bad longer term, as corp taxes getting jacked would be a guarantee.
I bought SPCE calls on Feb. 19. Was up 100% EOD and lost everything the next day

You didn't take risk in your own recommendation...
Holding 320p 12/31
I interviewed with them last year for a software solutions architect role.  


1. HR interview, passed with great remarks
2. Panel interview 3-4 hours, also passed with great remarks

At this point, HR told me they'd give me another date to fly into Mountainview, CA for an on-site final interview. However, they ghosted me and I never heard back.

Here's what you do for an automatic shoe-in.  


1. Be female (helps if you did *not* major in computer science)
2. Be Indian (specifically, Brahmin/Priest Caste)
   1. No this isn't dungeons and dragons, Indians are discriminatory as fuck; even within their own ethnic group
3. Be a combination of minority/female
   1. Black/female is the strongest mixed class
4. Be on an H1B visa, so they can hold you as an indentured servant and pay you less than their US citizen counterparts.
5. Be a Democrat

It is best not to play victim if you're not accepted, but it is important to be aware that tech companies are not a meritocracy and the allure of working for such organizations fades as you get older.

The reason being you realize that you can work less hours and in some cases make more without having to deal with all the PC crap that goes on (to a greater degree than other places).

349p 11/11
I need this
False, these are wannabe tendies. Its a Sunday and Chick Fil-a is closed so I'll cut you some slack.
SoftBank earnings are this week. No wonder we gapping up
It's funny, Little Caesar's doesn't even try to make their pizza look good in ads. It's just some flat shitty looking pizza with some zany shit going on in the ad.
but they didn't cover so fuck them
Yes, you are correct, but any good news towards legalization will undoubtedly boost these stocks in the short term. Also i‚Äôm just memeing bro.
Is ACB crashing tomorrow?
Hulk shrek dick futures somehow just got greener üöÄ
MJ and green energy stocks!
Loaded up on puts on Friday. Would love to see $7 again
It'll crash to the moon

Yes probably true in the long term but now how the stocks would react to leagalizatin
Confirmed. Had BOGO for a buck Big Macs with Mr Softbank last night. He was like ‚Äúoh, I got all kinds of billions for NIO calls‚Äù
This is the way literally üöÄüöÄ

That's when shit crashes lol. Why would it be higher with a coronavirus vaccine when we are double what we were at before corona virus?
Amd 100 at open
That would be nice. I‚Äôm loaded to the tits on 11/20 $20c and $21c
We are at ATH for SPY?? Am I mistaken or
About to make another 10 bands tomorrow open.
What you holding?
Earnings on Tuesday. Expected to do very well
Why do I feel like I‚Äôm somehow gonna be holding calls on the wrong shit tomorrow and it‚Äôll be the only not mooning ??

Take a break if you need man, markets aren‚Äôt everything. Hope things get better

Thought you were referring to my comment as BS, not the tax. 
I‚Äôm not an expert either. I knew what Bernie‚Äôs campaign wanted to do and only just recently heard Harris mention it as well. Figured it would be similar to Bernies but have not seen any specifics until some were just posted above.

You should cash out at market open and reconsider your risk management strategy. Any situation where you could get wiped out,  you screwed up.  Hedges should make it so you're not swinging more than -20Ÿ™ in a day. Beyond that you're less than a week from going to zero.
Explains why I got downvoted lol thanks didn‚Äôt know that.
Why you say that?
Joe Biden's $15,000 incentive for first time homeowners will send RKT to the moon in no time

Bullish. Cases are either peaked and are coming down or they're too high and US will reach herd immunity.
If you want the absolute greenest shits you've ever seen drink a bottle of blue Cura√ßao.
I go all in on one ticker buying stocks for a daytrade sometimes. I bought that one to see what could have been, pretty much. I figured it would behave like RKT did after its ipo, and dip and then just go up from there. The day I bought it I probably chose another stock instead.

Serious answer: the batteries swap out. 

So you can pay a monthly subscription fee, drive up to a charging station & swap out your battery for a full one. Takes 2 minutes. No need to sit & wait while it charges. 

This implies a potentially more profitable business model than just selling cars.

Competitors are miles behind their capabilities. Also, they are raking in government contracts. The private side is going to be where the real money is and that‚Äôs sure to come as the government gives them more and more business. Also, both Kamal and Biden have previously praised Palantir when they (or their teams) have used the software. As the internet grows so too will data analytics and again this company is the cream of the crop it seems.

The radical left preferred Bernie, and were all around already grumpy Biden was the choice, it was just a better choice to them than Trump.

Every president is a puppet, everyone that's worked in national government has compromised their values and beliefs, they all sell themselves out. This is just back to normal cause he's not a narcissistic rage tweeter on top of all that

It was up 30% on german markets on Sunday
I bought some cheap ass puts when it tanked on Friday. Than it gapped up and leveled off. I'll probably keep them and get some calls if it seems like it's going up a lot tomorrow.

Last week was the only week in months I've been following nio where it just ran all week. Usually it's just a day than a 5-6% drop than side ways till next run up.

I can see people being ok with nio breaking 1000 because telsa already did it but what kind of valuation should palantir have? The leaps are really expensive for them.

Have some faith retard
 i concur
Are RKT calls free money tomorrow?
yes, i‚Äôve been accumulating shares and leaps since sub 10. this run is just starting
What happened to nio, why people say that they are insolvent
It‚Äôs bullshit news. They want you to sell to get in cheap
watching the steelers every week more scary than holding through wearnings
Sorry to hear that, brother. Watch the option chains. When IV rises massively with underlying price, pricing is just begging people to take profit, short calls, and/or write a lot of covered calls.

This occurred many times this year. Most notable to me is the AAPL run to 140 with simultaneous insane IV expansion.
All I want is a BRZ

Or an early 90‚Äôs F150. I‚Äôve got weird taste.
These futures are just staying steady for another leg up hollaaa
Please don‚Äôt ban, but what is MM?
i got a milly on my wrist, biden on my dic, ye ye, i do stonks, nio in the back, baba on my lap

Worst part is I set stop losses on all my shit. Never trigger them. The ONE time I choose not too, it‚Äôs going to bankrupt me lmao
because futures, GLD, SLV, oil are up, it might be taken as a sign that buying is happening, which may be positive

With a likely red senate, Biden won‚Äôt have the firepower to pass much of his tax plan so they will likely just be conjecture during his campaigning, similar to most candidates pre-election. Virus news will continue to make headlines, but the majority of smart money is increasing risk exposure heading into the end of the year, be careful and don‚Äôt try and time the market turns (lot of smart people have tried and failed)

Too much mania surrounding it. You might only hope that they propose some share offering, have an accounting scandal, or if there is a broad market sell off. 

I would think the third is most likely.

How big was the red gap that was erased last Friday before open?
Y though?
Thursday afternoon, futures turned red and had a little selloff in the aftermarket. Futures did reach over -1% overnight and stayed around -.5 to -1% the whole night. Majority of people thought we were gonna open red. 

Next thing you know, at 9:00, futures did a crazy comeback and went into flat territory. 

Next thing you know, at 9:30 we opened green and had a green day instead of a red day on FRIDAY.

Ok Boomers, Just a reminder that if you have a 401k and own Emerging Markets fund you have already invested in NIO. Currently Vanguard owns almost 26 million NIO Shares.

Was ü•≠ doing an exceptional job for the market/economy by isolating our economy through rampant trade wars with economic giants and top tier innovators, "bringing back jobs" that are logistically and capitally infeasible, and limiting highly skilled workers, innovators, and academics from entering this country? ü§°
profit taking this fri? easy mode may mean now is best but I'm in your shoes and also unsure.

When you lost that first grand was that all you had in your account ? Starting with 80 grand or 45 grand (your story says 80 but the chart shows 45) and losing a grand I‚Äôm sure sucks but it‚Äôs not the same philosophy of losing everything u have as if you started with $1000; had ups and downs and eventually lost it all. Did you have any period in your trading history where you were truly attempting to learn vs diving right in? I personally think every want to be trader should spend the first year to three years simply learning and developing a strategy, which also counts towards learning to deal with your emotions. Experience is experience, just rather people got that experience with funds their ok with losing. Best wishes and I hope you making a ton of money in your future. You now have much more experience and I think you‚Äôll do better going forward.

Gotcha thanks for the heads up!
Gonna back the statement up. What convinced me: Constant rise in profit procentage. Still not in green in cost/profit, but getting closer. Covid is great business for them, since they track cases for the states and are about to close a deal with Britain as well. They have pretty much a Blue ocean, since no one else can compete with their creepy ass tech. Also they have stayed solid around 9-10 dollars since ipo and after biden took the lead they started slowly to moon. Biden knows how well the tech works, since they used it to track down Bin Laden. And the cherry on top is, that they have their first earnings call thursday. Shit is gonna hit the fan with them this week. Also the retards here will inflate the living fuck out of it.

This guys said he didn't even get the chance to buy calls lol. Shut the fuck up. You probably have tons of shares already.
While I agree with the sentiment. There are a number who are open about their use of technical analysis along with fundamental analysis. Paul Tudor Jones and Druckenmiller have some interesting things to say about.  Even Munger and Buffett are said to use volume indicators. But yeah, straight TA seems to more about selling advice than trading performance.
ü•≠ was always bragging about how he singlehandedly recovered the market/economy. In reality, he inherited an already recovering market/economy from the dems. ü•≠ hampered what would've been SPY $1000+ by now if dems took office in 2016. His retarded policies of economic isolation, reviving dead industries, and trade wars with other global economic giants and innovators like China, EU, South Korea, etc... really fucked us. Hope you guys have cash on deck to capitalize on the next 4 years of insane üí∞ üíµ returns on the coming global economic/market bounce back like never before üöÄ üåï.
Projected by who? I‚Äôd like to know who‚Äôs confirming my bias.

CRON has Altria backing them, but there haven't done shit in Canada and their plan for the US isn't clear.

I'm sure MO will buy someone out to get into the US once they feel comfortable with legislation. Could backfire if they end up late to the game though.
Bruh how are futures up like this
It‚Äôs going to go to 3600 just quit the permabear shit trust me it doesn‚Äôt work
Is Buffett really considered a "trader," though???

As someone that unfortunately needs medical care, i can say with conviction that Canada's Healthcare system is very good if you have a life or death situation. It's excellent. 

If, however, its something like a blown knee from soccer (also experienced) then it can really suck being on a waiting list... but to contrast, I spoke to a specialist Monday and tomorrow, just 1 week later, I'm having a procedure done in a world class facility for free. So its not perfect but its pretty darn good that I don't need to pay $6,000 for this, just $18 in parking.
Well fuck.

Ugh I took profits on Thursday. Not sure when to jump back in.
I‚Äôve seen it turn to red from much higher levels than this. Don‚Äôt worry bears. It will still be a sell the news week. Dumb money retail fomod in last week. They about to get dumped on.
Corona has broken daily records four days in a row...how long til the market takes the hit from it?
You dont know. We might steadily go up untill 3-4 wekks before Biden takes office and locks everything down.  Probably markets are reacting to a more rational president and a proof that the stock market didn‚Äôt reach all time high because Trumps genius
Stroke or risk a stroke. The choice is yours
Was a pretty dry presentation, bit autistic from musky but the actual information was great. First time I started to believe Tesla deserved it's crazy valuation. Lost about a grand off the back of that, not too bad but another reminder to not hold through presentations and earnings.
So my calls r not fukt? Well this is a first!
And historically proven slow to stalling economic growth in the winter. This is setting up real bad.
I was set on DKNG for a bit, just had no money to throw at it, now I have money, set on buying and then yes, I looked at the thread for 25 secs and found NIO and APHA.... and ACB and CGC, and XPEV and about five billion others and yes, I narrowed down to two with my original. I haven't seen anyone say ish about DKNG, but I also do not know how to read.
Sure. Not my physical type, but she seems fun.
Pelosi for sure. Her husband trades with millions
I think Pelosi is having 24 hour orgasms right now
Personally I‚Äôm bearing long term, but until spy convincingly breaks below the current bottom im not buying puts, not worth the risk trying to time the top at this point, and there‚Äôs still a lot of cash on the sidelines waiting to get in
What news are you talking about? They haven‚Äôt released anything new
Dude JD above 100 by Thursday

We need to get teams of firemen with the trampolines over there stat, if I've learned anything from cartoons.
Trump will be. Also look at this way, if you're a politcian you can do one of 2 things. Go on your broadcast news network, and talk about your plan. Hope that people watch it, hope that the TV network doesn't screw u over by asking or focusing on the wrong things. And hoping that your message isn't altered during the broadcast. OR you can tweet directly to your followers, leaving the message sent to your constituency intact.

Love it. It‚Äôs great to see how you think - you should do this for a living (if you don‚Äôt already). Btw that accounting degree was worth it.
I had a similar situation with TSLA with RH on the Sept4 AH crash.  Lots of us got screwed.  Please message me if tomorrow if BIIB takes a dive and puts your account into margin calls.  I lost over 10k but others over 50k.  Scary stuff but we are working on getting things resolved.  Yes TDA is so much better that on their platform is all I use now.  Screw RH.

I wouldn‚Äôt be too worried, I don‚Äôt buy this pump at all. The rally last week died out on Friday, and what has changed? Everybody expected Biden to win at that point. This pump is just everybody happy buying Shit. Covid is still the biggest threat to the economy and its growing more than ever.

I hate to say it, but this rally we are seeing tonight in the Futures is fucking fake and gay and I can‚Äôt wait to see it crash and burn!
Gotta give it to Trump. Unlike Bush, he's giving a stock market to a Democrat that isn't completely destroyed, luckily due to his reelection chances hinging on it.. Things aren't perfect, but at least Biden isn't taking over with a crashed market. The debt sucks, covid sucks, businesses and jobs suck, but we'll see how things go...

Honestly it needs to consolidate for a week or so. The few calls I sold would appreciate it.
No one cares about ü•≠ now. Crazy how quickly shit changes
Twitter will remain an important platform for politicans to reach directly to the the general population. Trump changed the game when it came to voter outreach, and he's proven twitter to be a crucial platform for politicians. I'm thinking of buying a whole bunch of twitter shares.
I kinda like Joey now, not even in office yet and has already cured rona and at this rate spy gunna be at 360 by the end of next week. üò≥

This is going to be a loss decade like the aughts. Huge run-up in the 1990s, then SPY didn't see the dot com high again for seven years. 2010-2020 was the new run-up. SPY 300 end of 2021.
Overwhelmingly bullish (even if I'm fking stupid enough to be bag-holding an Uber short) BUT vaccine still the big hidden factor. Without it hospitals reach capacity by end of month - that's not going to be good.
If BIIB opens flat which is highly unlikely short it massively like 25% ITM puts for 2 weeks out
let us rejoice
My opinion is that it was a cup and handle and we are at the beginning of a long term uptrend especially when the COVID vaccine drops.
Who let this kid in without watching the pre requisite of ‚Äúoptions trading for beginners‚Äù on YouTube? Go home ur drunk 

But really no he would just have to sell his contracts before expiry , if he wants to capitalize on getting 100 shares, the stock would have to hit the strike price and then he could exercise his option and own 100 shares but usually nobody does that unless they are buying leaps with big Delta energy
I love this shit.  You guys get hard ons for WSB loss porn.  I get hard ons for so called "Market Experts" losing there ass.
Tomorrow gonna repeat that.

Nah. I think there are much better plays to speculate on.

I 420.
Bro we all know you‚Äôre multiplying your actual shares by a factor of 10000.
I have 300 shares of PLTR (not as much as you obviously) but the plan on those is to buy and hold for life. What I‚Äôd do rn if I were you is load up on long dated 2022/2023 calls on PLTR. This thing doubling in the next few months (halfway there for me since I got calls when this was $10) is as sure as the sun rising each and every day
He won't leave tho
The play is to put money into the companies that get hyped as fuck pull it out once federally legal and wait for Philip Morris to buy them out and have a legacy of tobacco and pot to pass down for generations.

Dy:
Dycom looks kind of hit or miss. They are very flush with cash and very low debt which can be a great thing but can also show they are struggling to maintain or expand their business. Generally dividends suck up the excess liquidity in a company but they don't disperse them, which I actually like. I'm guessing their profitability lives or dies by their contracts and every quarter is a complete dice roll for what they'll end up reporting. Generally I'd be praising a company with this strong of a balance sheet but the EPS makes it seem like there's something off. I'd sit this one out simply because there's more reliable opportunities elsewhere unless you have a deeper knowledge of them than what's directly presented. If you want to gamble, the 3Y1W chart shows they are more likely than not to tank on every earnings week. It's like 2.5:1 odds of a 2+ sigma drop lol.

JFIN:
You know sometimes you see companies with negative equity and you just want to know how they're still alive and what happened. I'm going to grab a six pack later tonight and look into their financials because that both my version of a fun Sunday night and I can try to squeeze some justification that accounting degree I paid so much for. YRC has been the most extreme version of a negative equity company I've found so far, but MGI is the default example. They can be fun to trade because the beta is massively extreme and any slight hint of news can cause them to move 20-30% due to squeezes and the like. Make sure to never use undefined trades when touching these. I got margin called on my MGI shorts because there was a RUMOR of a buyout by an anonymous source saying they couldn't reveal how they know that was picked up on Bloomberg. I'll post what I find later if you're interested, but I can't advise any moves for this lol.

CENT:
Ah finally a company with a more dead options chain than Build-A-Bear Workshop. It's hard to gauge perceived risk vs objective risk without seeing prices on any strike, but without going into the news or the docs to see how they reported such a strong show last quarter, I would assume this stock would drop on its upcoming earnings if it doesn't keep up with last quarter. It would be nice to see an options price skew to really support or refute any hunches. Outside of that they are a financially-sound company with pets and gardens not going away anytime soon.

TITN:
This one is a more distressed company trading at about book value. Between that fact and their earnings being all over the place, this one seems to be all over the place. High financial leverage, very low quick ratio and a relatively stressed current ratio, low cash-flow per share and even low sales per share, it doesn't look very promising in its current state. Historically it seems to like to jump or plummet about 15-20% on earnings weeks. a $12.50/$17.50 strangle may be a fun gamble, but I don't see any solid play for maybe another year or two.

DE:
This is a tough one for me to interpret, and it may just be because of the type of company it is. It's been on a massive tear since July which has allowed it to break out of its years-long channel, but the financials are just...weird. Again maybe the industry has a different financial portfolio than what I'm used to seeing. Book value of $36, Sales per share is half the share price, 6.2 financial leverage, quick ratio of .64 and current ratio of .90 show substantial distress, or at least massive borrowing, yet there's a clear and consistent yearly earnings. Dividend payout is similar to banks, but unlike MDT it doesn't have the books to justify giving away its money to shareholders while drowning in debt. There's way more call volume than put volume with about equal pricing, however I sort of interpret that as hedging activity for their shorts than raw retail bullish sentiment. It's very possible that DE stays shot up right where it is while paying down some of its debt to 'solidify' this valuation. I don't see it retracing back to its previous yearly channel again, but it could pull back to $220 if the rest of the market does. Because of that, there's probably better opportunity elsewhere if this one is already played out and reactionary to the market.

Well that was fun. Thanks for showing me some tickers in industries I'm not familiar with and maybe my ramblings gave you some insight too. MTSC and MDT look the most promising for how I like to trade, but several of them would be good for buying and holding too, aside from the meme stocks. I'll grab a beer or two and dig into JFIN more for entertainment than DD.

Mind sharing your thesis of $4000 AMZN TP?
I think people will be pulling in JD as BABA's lukewarm growth is due in part to JD sucking the air up and growing themselves.
After all of their puts expires worthless. Some of them bought a few weeks out or even two months. So maybe in 3 weeks?

What does QQQ and SPY open at we think?
If you‚Äôre holding one of these:

- PLTR
- QQQ
- BABA
- ACB
- NIO 

I would grab a beer with you retard
Short term empty town, mid-term you may have a brief window to make some mad tendies with puts as it comes back down to Earth. I would wait until it's more clearly topped out though because loading up on puts before the top will just bankrupt you. I have a feeling NIO will do some retard parabolic arc to the moon shit this week before the inevitable sell off.
So when do we start switching to puts
yeah whatever lets do it
Haha this is the WSB way. buy Square, SPXL, TQQ, AMD and hold on for dear life
Misspelled $ROPE
That would make worth more than all manufacturers combined probably

Not so much that *he‚Äôs* good for the market, but that having a split government (repub senate) will effectively render him useless.  I believe this would be referred to as a ‚Äúlame duck Presidency‚Äù
oops
the keyword here is \*short-term\* so judging by how low its been ACB has the highest implied move.. hence why it went up 75% while others stayed pretty low. If u wanna play a hype fomo stock short-term, ACB is ideal.
[deleted]
Imagine how it feels buying puts every week
Smart move. I think post earnings for PLTR I will put my earnings into NIO as well
Checking in to see if there's premature ejaculations happening all over in this sub.

Probably going to hit ATH tomorrow. Hell fucking  yes üôå
% chance your comeback goes like MJs baseball career?
Weed has the wind behind it's back right now. Investor sentiment is shifting and the financials are improving. With the improvement in fintech, weed delivery, and weed products and government wide legalization, weed is going to be a big fucking industry. It's time now to start putting our money into weed companies. I feel like weed has hit an inflection point, sort of where EV was a couple years back. Weed will definitely be a big industry and I want us autists to make a boat load of money investing in it.
202 Bull Trendline recovered or back-test complete???

Tomorrow is gonna be REAL interesting!
Puts on Bear and MAGA boys. Calls on $COPE

I sold my calls on Friday before earnings. I was being a pussy and played it safe. I bought 1 cheap weekly call. Let's see if that prints.
They should just become doctors or lawyers. Sooo many people needed doctors or lawyers during the pandemic. It was easy money by boy. I almost felt bad. But then I just kept yoloing into Nio.
Hahahahaha. For starters only some are Canadian that I hold. Secondly if you think US elections have no influence with relations with foreign companies you are simply stupid and not worth conversing with.

If baba doesn‚Äôt open above 320 then it isn‚Äôt. You can still get in at a good price it was 320 2 weeks ago and held 300 for over a month. Literally one of the only stocks that didn‚Äôt go up. However, it seems like it‚Äôll open at 320-330 so don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to.

Bears üêª, here is a stock you should check out üëâ $COPE
I also do not see smooth sailing so I raised cash (35%).  I can participate in the up side (future looks really strong at 6:40pm EST) and position for a pullback.  If I can catch a 5% dip and then ride it to 3700+ (10% gain) then I will finish the year really strong and have increased confidence Q1 delivers more upside. 

It is really hard to tell but I also did not mention we should not fight the fed.  If we believe this market is going to have a prolonged downturn then we would be fighting the Fed which is currently saying they will not let that happen. 

It is an amazing time!

When the direction is clear, yes, but choppy markets are hard

Ehhh big money likes stability and predictability, which is exponentially more likely with Biden. Big Money is definitely helping with the pump, although probably most of it already got in last week before it was officially called but anyone with more than 3 functioning brain cells could see Biden was going to win.
Baidu?
Dude you have shares.  Microsoft isn't going anywhere.

 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has proposed an FTT with a 0.1 percent rate as part of her plan to pay for her ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù proposal.

‚ÄúThe tax would be assessed on and collected from financial firms, and would likely have little to no effect on most investors,‚Äù Warren said in her plan, which also references the CBO revenue estimate. ‚ÄúInstead, according to experts, the tax could help decrease what Americans pay in fees for their investments and reduce the size of relatively unproductive parts of the financial sector.‚Äù

Lmao fuck i hope not. I picked CGC because their earnings will be shit and the IV on the puts was way less than ACB puts
You mean the 500k cheap labor were going to import to write software?  Its real great for everyone here! Lol whatever spy calls I guess.
This is a fake retail pump, nothing has changed for the better. Retail thinks the election was great news, big money knows it‚Äôs not a big deal
I am thinking of holding through earnings and then get few leaps, considering no market level surprises.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the government‚Äôs 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections.

The new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the N.S.A. may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operations, which are largely unregulated by American wiretapping laws. These include collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches.

What‚Äôs really crazy is look how important that is to Denmark‚Äôs economy. Mink fur is their 3rd largest export and accounts for roughly 500million of their GDP
Didn't know CGC was reporting as well. I'm jacked in ACB puts have a bad feeling its gonna pump regardless of earnings.
UPWK looks promising. It's SaaS and tech so it fits with the trend. It hasn't really been mentioned at all so you can still get in early
downsies you mean ?
Lol. Mangos friends probably left him now for sleepy

Yeah, my week went like this. Sold $SQ two days before earnings, sold $XEL for $980 profit but before they went up 3 more dollars, sold JD for $1200 profit but before they went up for three straight days, shorted QQQ which really went well. Then me and a buddy were discussing yolo‚Äôing $MRVL, $BERY, basically any  pot stock and I was just like, ‚Äúnah.‚Äù All would have been 10 plus baggers. Then I hear ‚ÄúGolf balls‚Äù and sink $3,000 into it. Actually did some DD on them, but still. Am I smart or am I smart?
its pretty fucked 15 million killed and now people that visit Denmark with Covid symptoms have to go to the Contagious Disease unit

Sometimes in the shower I like to come up with random sums of money that I'll then pretend to have yesterday it was "$411,000" then I imagined I have that exact sum in my bank account, then I smiled.
Good luck
When is it though.
I think tomorrow NQ breaks ATH. We may rally to SPY 400 lol.
Democrats are the ones that vote against government spying buddy. Republicans always vote for it.
With this many Green Days I would just keep an eye out on the vix. Vix future dropping so it shows investors are still risk on.

I had $2 and $4 leaps, but I sold after the luckin bullshit because I decided I couldn't trust Chinese companies.  Had at least 50 I think.
Obviously?
People expect shitty earning imo. Investors are interested in the future prospect of the companies in general. Trying to get in on the ground floor of an industry that hasn‚Äôt taken flight yet.
I‚Äôm only accepting legal NIO rumors. If we listen to the legal rumors, we moon. And if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôm already loaded to the tits with NIO FDs.
We‚Äôre not seeing a red day for 10 years just wait til stimulus is passed
Being a fking hero
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Yeah I agree with you. Was just calling out that it‚Äôs rare for a president to be in the position of having to give up early
The higher it goes the bigger the fall puts on discount

the market has decided that it will moon, sell your puts for whatever you can get at open
Mods,  Need some help here, here are my thoughts.  If people are purposely lying and spreading fake info they should be banned. However, politics have a direct impact on the market and banning someone for talking about political ramifications is ridiculous.  If someone is trying to make a point it should be allowed here.  Keep in mind I'm fine with not allowing "LIBS SUCK HOOKER PENIS TRUMP 2020" etc.  You shouldn't need a separate thread to post your ideas. Finally, if you can put on a Rocket League tournament you should have a yearly best and worst loss porn of the year.  With the winners and losers getting exclusive flair, or a "Razzy type WSB award".  That is all.
Maybe one more week out

Are futures seriously green?  Wtf
In the past the correlation is certainly there, but that linkage is likely to have broken in China if not India (yet). 

AFAIK getting a permit to buy a gasoline powered car is exceedingly hard in China; folks have to enter multiple lotteries to have even a slim chance of hitting the jackpot. In contrast, a green plate is much much more accessible; that in and of itself is government-directed market development at work. Xi‚Äôs 2030 goal is no joke. As CCP is driving to ‚Äúupscale‚Äù China‚Äôs economy structure, debt-ridden local governments don‚Äôt have nearly the pressure to put up just raw GDP numbers anymore, but to show results in attracting startups and R&D heavy firms. That‚Äôs also not in oil‚Äôs favor.

I‚Äôd love to see how fracking plays out in the Biden tenure and your thesis may well come true. But given how much OPEC has reduced previous supply and can restore that in a snap of finger, imho global oil prices will have face a hard time getting back over 60s in thebest case scenario even when Rona blows over. We shall see bud.

We got green futures now just give me positive weed earnings tomorrow and it'll be a great week
What rumour
[removed]
Fuckin shit, only went into this week with spreads. Looks like i can close them out for full profit but still. Should‚Äôve just yolo‚Äôd my networth into QQQ calls
$12
I got interested when I heard Dr. Mortgage Eyes was in on it. I was short term bullish for the squeeze but hearing about their emphasis on online commerce, data sales and market sharing with microsoft, sony and hopefully switch. I also hope they push to become a known retailer of CPU parts and such. Burry is a my hero investor but he is shit at timing

Honestly 100k seems low for that kinda work.
If this shit story is true, you deserve to go to the hall of fame.

Because you too could learn how to do that
Lets get back to 27 SLV
Sold out of BABA calls Friday and was just cash over the weekend.. so very much hoping this cools off overnight so I can hop in.. I see another day like early last week where we shoot up intraday
The muted gains on calls because of vix sucks
Already looking at lambos for the money I'm going to make off of this incredible bull run that is before us
So this is the trap part? Or what ? Man I‚Äôm scared ..
I can't believe this NIO shit..... R.I.P. to call holders. :(

God why did I buy spy calls instead of the Q‚Äôs, whatever all in 355 11/13s
Lol. Yes sure 70 million americans believe that Trump won, sure thing bud.
It‚Äôs because the results of the election and transition aren‚Äôt actually in doubt. If it came down to one state with a small margin like Bush v. Gore then there‚Äôd be a real possibility of a power struggle. But at this point his loss is so large and most Republicans in government aren‚Äôt actually backing him up, so he‚Äôs just left whining and tweeting, not seizing power. Tweets don‚Äôt actually affect how much money companies will make next quarter or their stock price.

If anything all he‚Äôs doing is weakening the dollar, which makes stonks go up.
With your nose genius
Pajama traders all know this shit is gonna limit up, can we skip this part?

Equities Bubble 2.0
Nope, something I saw a long time ago, but if you look at the last 6 years of both Clinton and Obama (that is blue prez, red 'gress scenario) and given the 08 financial disaster happened under Bush, I think you can eyeball the charts and verify.  HW Bush had the economy tank at the end on him so that and the Great Recession and 9/11 are skewing the numbers I guess..... Reagan made stonk go up tho so that's cool although it doesn't support what I said.

Some of you guys expected a limit up the first 10 minutes in. Relax broskis. Wait until all of the institutional investors see what their buddy‚Äôs are doing. These guys generally operate in a herd mentality. Momentum builds.
There's still uncertainty about the senate. That's the one that will move the markets me thinks.
Alright you newbies stop getting trolled...there's no futures for individual stonks
...you‚Äôre acting like the goal is to make $? I thought the goal was to ruin your life & family‚Äôs future by losing all your and their $, and if possible indebting yourself thru ignorant options and bad stonk choices to the point of bankruptcy or beyond if can manage.

I‚Äôve been saying SLV leaps are the play weeks now. Granted I bought too early and ended up down 24% on my calls for a bit, but I‚Äôm up 12% overall now now with no sign of stopping. MMs know that once the volatility gravy train subsides, we have an overprinting federal reserve and a dire need for more stimulus. 

SLV 35c 6/17/22
for example i caught one of the spin reporters backing out of his bullcrap because he almost said how it could end up a tie but realized he would be giving away too much 

if it ended up a tie i would have lost everything which could have easily happened,, better to cashout a 15k loss

Spy always the fucking lagging retard. Well on the other hand I‚Äôm more excited to see weed stocks at 9:30am LOL
A:
Holy crap Covid did absolutely nothing to their bottom line. Going back 3 years this company always makes about .75/qr no matter what. Without going into the core mechanics of this business outside the blurb or looking at the fine print in the 10-Qs, in terms of financial paper they are a strong, consistent, healthy company. On a three-year weekly chart they show sharp, violent pullbacks and weeks/months' long rallies. Nothing great for short term but let it drop hard for a solid week and then get aggressive with quarterlies. I'd like it a lot better at $95 but $100 would be a solid entry. I wouldn't try timing a drop.

MTSC:
First immediate thing I see with them is they are trading at book value, however they are producing a steady EPS every year that would generally garner around a 10-14 PE for the industry. Their books display some level of financial struggle, but they aren't too deep to get out of like some other companies that are in the $500mm market range (cough Rite Aid Moneygram cough). I grabbed that info from the TDA analyze tab, so it is usually accurate but not absolutely guaranteed. This one deserves a deeper look into the 10-Qs to get a better understanding of what exactly is going on with their books and if their future is optimistic or if it's rising because everything's rising. The options liquidity is MGI-level garbage, but I'm seeing 3-6% price swings every day which makes this a candidate for some fun share daytrading. Intraday seems pretty one-directional.

MDT:
Where do you find these companies anyway? The 3Y1W shows some significant volatility basically every week on this one, which is pretty significant since it's a $139bn market cap. Strong, healthy company with consistent, steadily increasing yearly EPS and an excellent low leverage, high-ratio financials. The dividend payout ratio as a percentage is very high compared even to banks, which may be a possible reason why there's a big fluctuation in price, but the books show that they aren't killing themselves by offering the dividend like the boomer stocks that have been taking on more and more debt to service the unjustifiable dividend aristocrat status. Take a look at it's IV/HV ratios. Its monthly and weekly options are priced at 35% IV, but it's been swinging like a 90% IV stock every single week. This is a great opportunity for buying a straddle to take advantage of the objectively underpriced options or it could be a candidate for, if you have the money for it, I'd absolutely advocate running 'cash-covered' put credit spreads, where you do a normal put credit spread, but if you get assigned, you stay long the stock because it's a healthy company that always bounces back AND you also win on your long put side. It's like free money on both sides. $100/$99 for the weekly or $100/$98 for the monthly. $100 would be a good entry point for longs, but if it drops below that you get the full benefit of the $98/$99 put, but if it went up the whole time, you still make a small consolation prize since the long puts are covered. I'll do a few more as a separate reply.
Sometimes I like to check this thread before I check the futures open and try and guess where it‚Äôs at based on comments.

QLD is 2x QQQ and it dropped 85% in 08. You can imagine that TQQQ at the time would drop 95%+. Can you stomach it? Also, TQQQ was alive only during the longest bull run in history. Additionally, growth and innovation stocks which are in QQQ have been destroying the benchmark by a lot. Do you think this will continue forever?

I like all these points but it's how I think of January 2021. After last weekend's tear and 2 month left in the year I don't see a straight line through year end to 3800. I see lots of risk, chop, and sell off in November, especially if earnings are at risk. January onwards is all clear IMO b/c the worst will be behind and uncertainty removed.

Bulls gonna be angry soon :(
Im thinking there will be a slight correction on NIO midway through this week. However, tomorrow NIO is going through the roof. I'm thinking about selling a couple calls that expire May 2021 in order to buy a few extra calls expiring the 20th. Suggestions?

Currency conversion?
The more I think about it, I think that no matter what happens in those races the market has an excuse to rip higher: 

With R control: minimal additional regulation, no additional corporate taxes, decreased uncertainty - but minimal stimulus. Market returns historically prefer divided government because gridlock is certain.

With D control: maximal fiscal stimulus causing asset inflation (see 2020) to pair with maximal monetary stimulus, increased global trade - but increased uncertainty, particularly around corporate taxes...but if you think Dem‚Äôs will raise corporate taxes during the pandemic, you‚Äôre dreaming. That‚Äôs 2022 at the earliest.

Think about how last week went. Remember when the market was set to rip on the blue wave? And then it didn‚Äôt happen? And the market ripped anyway?

Why would this be any different?
It says - 1.6 bil
+10 now

Ooh, my stimmy hurt, my stimmy hurt, my stimmy hurt üéµ
So one of the top comments to this thread is "it's free" as in "no commissions" which applies and has applied to many major brokers since 2019 and some 2018.

Even "options" are slowly being free and the ones that aren't are 30-65 cents on average.

The only advantage RH has over "some" of the others is speed, updating speed in real-time, page to page speed, and buying and selling speed, though RH executing the buy and sell are often slower than others.

However many brokers are fast now, a couple are as fast or faster, so that's another advantage that may die out in the next year. The top brokers that were significantly slower are only like 2 seconds slower now.

By next year the question will be "why are people still using RH out of nostalgia" or "Help, I have a debit card with RH and I feel trapped."
That's just a rumor

Buy-den
yes, but how does one interpret, ‚Äúpotentially the greatest benefit‚Äù? It is not clear that security/lower volatility is actually the wanted benefit.
Maybe she is just looking for the biggest chance to double the money within a year. Or she just wants the biggest expected return regardless of variance/risk. 
So the answer clearly is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet‚Äù.

And one could technically argue that Tesla is somewhat of an hedge for Ford, to mitigate the case of exploding electromobility that cripples the underprepared traditional car companies.

It is safe in that I can successfully roll out of that position with 50% loss with relative ease unless the whole market nukes to the ground. its not just a red or black gamble position that i either win or lose 100%. its risky but managed risk with the understanding of the downside and upside potential as well as planned exit points for both sides.

TIL. I looked at IRS 550 which says:
 ‚ÄúA wash sale occurs when you sell or trade stock or securities at a loss and within 30 days before or after the sale you: 1. Buy substantially identical stock or securities, 2. Acquire substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade, 3. Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities‚Äù

Yes, I know what it is, but that's exactly my point. Your "hypothetical" fund doesn't reality so it isn't correct. It's non-linear. Your model is what is basically a single-day function. It doesn't even hold out for a week. It's ... Anyway this isn't getting through. You will do what you do. Instead of deriving this properly from real data you are using logic that you understand but is not realistic.

$ICLN is no rumor, sir
This is why I tell my friends to be careful with Nio, Tesla was trading at a $5b - $8b market cap when they had similar revenue numbers. Obviously Tesla wasn't backed by the Chinese government whereas Nio is, but imo that doesn't warrant a $40b market cap. They are a great long term hold, but they have no plans to be vertically integrated so their margins will never come close to Tesla's. They'll likely have similar margins to traditional automakers, another thing that doesn't deserve a $40b market cap imo.
They bought Adam and Eve

WTF?
dumb? time to short the shit out of it after earning
I don't know that, and neither do you.  In order for QE to work you need people to borrow and spend.  There will be no borrowing because covid-deferred loans will come out of forbearance in december.  If you want hard data just check consumer credit (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=TOTALSL,)  it's going up which means people are paying off their debt.  On top of that banks are tightening lending (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CONSUMER) and moreover there is a lack of credit worthy demand.  So now we have established that no one is borrowing.  What about spending?  Velocity of m2 is basically zero for one, and on a more macroeconomic level we still have 700k newly unemployed a week.  If you are unemployed you aren't going to spend money.  Furthermore the fed is going to continue to do QE because they can't let the bank's 3.5 trillion dollar bond portfolio fail so we have a situation where the fed is forced to keep taking liquidity in an already deflationary environment.  All this implies there will be no leverage via fractional reserve lending and, in fact, we will run into a strong dollar

Why thank you, sir. 
Haha, if the dem voters actually took some time to see beyond the US, they'd be mind fucked as to how much more people liked Trump than Biden. One country that sticks out is Taiwan, I think they're gonna be the most fucked pretty soon. I'm just not sure how long to date my options plays for, maybe 1 year out....

They got the best CPU at the moment from all the reviews and they should release a new CPU and Motherboard next year and if Covid is not a problem in 2021 then I think summer 2021 is where they'll release their new CPU. They don't really own CPU market yet but it gonna be awhile before INTEL can get something good against AMD since they are like 1 gen. behind them. So in the meantime AMD just gonna eat up most of INTEL CPU market in no time.

Hey guys...got something I need to admit something to you. Now I know it's gonna sound bad, but trust me, it'll be okay. 

So we're over here pumpin, QEing and shit. It's a pretty sober vibe. Everything was and has been going according to plan. 

But we had the Ben Bernanke over a few weeks back. This dudes beard is fucking epic, honestly you should check it out sometime. Anyways, he convinced us we had been doing *such* a good job, that we deserved a little prize. He gave us a joint or two, not sure how much it was, however much fits whatever a 'QP' is. 

So yeah, we've been smokin up a little bit. the Ben Bernanke did it though, and look what he accomplished. Really we learned it from him. 

Anyways, not trying to bore you with details. We're out of weed, reality is setting in, and I gotta be upfront. 

We're fucked bro we have FUCKED UP. Dude we are so fuckin confused right now we're literally using FINTWIT to gauge whether we're falling apart. 

We've totally lost track of everything. 

Its like if we were counting the number of cars passing in the street and if we miscounted we'd ruin the global economy. Now imagine what happens when you light up with the Ben Bernanke and stop counting for a long time. Like a month. 

That's how far we've lost track of things. 

Guys, I think we accidentally killed the Lira. And as far as I can tell, we may have left the US10Y bleeding out in the street. the Ben Bernanke said that it won't get killed but the Ben Bernanke started doing shrooms last month and he's been talking about NIRP and some theory he's coining **reverse income theory**. It's fucking batshit.

Anyways, I'm telling you this because if I don't the Ben Bernanke said he'd go on ~~cartoon network~~ CNBC and spill the beans instead. Judging by the amount of shrooms the Ben Bernanke has been taking I'm not sure if he's ever coming down, let alone by tomorrow morning, so it's on me now. 

We fucked up so bad we don't even know what the outcomes are. At least when you print too much you realize **what** problem you have. But in this case, we might have fucked up so bad that the market is going up. Which probably means that we're just gonna get fucked harder, later. 

I don't know, we don't know, but that's all I got. the Ben Bernanke is fuckin breathing over my shoulder reading this no the Ben Bernanke I wont write that the Ben Bernanke stop turn off dictation siri stop siri stop siri stop fuck oft
Intel CEO hates this one trick

Interesting that I see you absolutely spamming this link to anyone that mentions NIO. I scrolled through the last 45 minutes or so and counted at least 10 times.
i think everyone here believes shorts exist to cause a short squeeze.
When Trump get's re-reelected, will it cause SPY to tank?
did you order him off Wayfair? what was the cabinet model #?
I have $1500 in NIO calls for next week as wellü§û
Anything new from amd or nvidia will sell out.  There's not enough supply with stay at home demand, and the new console cycle.  Can't even get one of the new amd cpus myself.

Priced in retard
What one?

Puts?
it's just money. as long as you have your health and a job your good.

2 things that may help

1) have a main account where you just buy and hold big tech stocks and etfs. your're 33 so maybe bunch of fang and qqq, arkk type stuff.

2) have a "play" account in a separate brokerage. practice bankroll management (poker term).

so if you have 3k in your play account. then maybe only throw 3-500 into each play.

You are literally repeating what the guy said. He said it more cryptically to weed out autists like you who have no reading comprehension.
One time my dad was out hunting and had to take a shit- checked his wallet... 3 one dollar bills. Perfect for a wipe. So he did his business and wiped with the bills. Later that day we circled around and he saw them and the poopie was all dried up so he kinda crinkled it off and put them back into his wallet. Dropped by the mini mart and bought a bud light Clamato with the $3. 

This is why you don‚Äôt put money in your mouth.
That's the image they sell, but it is not the reality. Obama bumped troops up across the board, amped up drone strikes, and continued to increase spending on the F-35. Military = jobs and the Democratic machine likes jobs... and minimum wage. That means we are poised to get some fresh rockets under prices across the board. I think /u/DTF_Truck is on point... but it will take a minute or 6.

At this point, I am wishing I had more PLTR.
Do you think it will be enough to offset lower demand? What percent of oil in US is produced by fracking? Do you think OPEC will start flooding the market with oil again?

However 1m after open I bet trump is gonna get angry, so let see if he brings a tweet trade war for maximum pain on my SPX calls.

There's going to be more volatility than most people think this week. Some stocks will moon, but some will drop 20% as well. People who think the DOW is going to shoot up 3000 points this week are probably letting politics impact their investment decisions a bit too much.
$7.16 for the core position of 6k shares. 

GME is very unique. I don't understand how the 100+% short interest can possibly close without a BIG move to the upside, whether it take a few days or a few months. The business is in a good spot, management is competent. Bankruptcy is off the table and they should be generating a profit from now on. 

Looking for Q3 ER as a potential catalyst. EPS estimates are low at an avg of  -0.85 and I think GME will beat expectations simply due to their e-commerce growth over the last few months. Everyone else in the industry is doing exceptionally well. Hardware/software/publishers all crushing earnings across the board. I think management has a lot of topics to focus on which will highlight a successful business model moving forward. I also think a return to profitability by Q4 ER is easily attainable, which should force the smarter shorts to capitulate on their thesis of a continual operating loss till bankruptcy.

Not sure if you know about this so link to acquisition:
https://investorplace.com/2020/11/aeva-spac-merger-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-ipv-spac/

Many companies that are going into the EV space rely on/implement lidar tech. TSLA does not use this tech, but many of its legacy competitors(like gm for instance) do. With biden as president we will be shifting into EV much faster. My theory is this shift will push not only tesla up but also other auto companies and part supply companies that are EV specific and/or are in EV manufacturing. Aeva is an established supplier of this tech and if EV really is the future I could see Aeva becoming a de-facto supplier in future years. Plus as it stands right now everything is relatively overpriced compared to its future value except for many of these spacs in the EV sector that have not gotten much public attention yet.
Steelers can‚Äôt even score on this team lol they are dogshit
wtf you guys still at GME? that's old news
Flyer calls for February. Not enough money to be  upset if it doesn‚Äôt pay out and just enough to be pissed I didn‚Äôt buy more if it moons.
Yep, companies that can afford to automate will survive, others will struggle
That expiration is pretty close... it'd be a shame if... we had a... correction
If they mention a reverse split, shit‚Äôs gonna moon bigly like it did in May. If they mention better than expected losses, probably another +25-30% day.

Why did you buy a $8 call? Might as well bought the fuckin stonk.
Walmart and Target were already essentially $15 min. Starbucks was $12. 

MCD is going to be hit the most since they average $8 now (but with their huge investment in self-ordering kiosks replacing cashiers I think a lot of this will be offset )

I bought zm $570 lottos that expire next week for 0.9/each mid last week (4) and bought more reasonable $530s and 550s as well with 10/20 exp. If markets bounce higher on presidential news then I theorize that zm will gap up to 530s at open and then tread higher over the next day or two. I plan to roll out these calls by thursday to new calls that expire in mid December in order to have an earnings play up early. I see it like zm benefits from covid resurgence and also now also benefits from increased optimism on future chinese trade relations. If the markets all shit the bed tomorrow then I plan to average my position down in size but still hold 1 or 2 of the calls in case there is a quick chop rebound where I can at least cover the initial cost of my calls. Fortunately I picked these up when zm was in the 465-475 range so have a little bit of breathing room on the downside before I have to cut anything loose. ZM trades like a penny stock so honestly this play is much more optimistic and risky than if you were to just play spreads and take profit on the down and up legs(zm has a really wide daily range atm and this will prob increase as earnings comes closer. the usually pattern is zm dips in am and around 11am begins a recovery and around 1:30 the recovery either succeeds and pushes it up to near daily highs or it fails and slowly drips down to near or below daily lows. I'm hoping the presidential election euphoria will cancel out the am drip and zm will get a couple 8-10% up days in a row before any correction.). Thanks for coming to my ZM trading ted talk :\] sorry for the overly long reply.

At this point I think the make up of the senate/house is more impactful on the market. With that being said I think the reaction/riots that a trump comeback would cause would be impactful. I also think the media would start screaming COVID-19 again. I find it quite amusing how COVID-19 coverage is non-existent now that Biden is assumed to be the president.

I‚Äôll tell you why you don‚Äôt need a gay bear degree. Viral option tiktoks that mention tech stonks and then you go and stack calls on SaaS like Unity & Snowflake.
Sellers.
You may rely on it
Typically we rally at the end of the year.  This year is particularly well setup to do the same.  We had a good drop before the election which included tax selling.

Here is the thesis:

1 - Companies are positioned to deliver higher profits because they have lowered the cost of servicing debt, bought back stock, laid of workers and some have even benefited from stimulus.

2 - Stimulus is coming.  It is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. stimulus will also be global.  This is not just the US.  It will be a global injection of cash.

3 - Covid will begin to subside in Europe which will be paralleled here.  We will also here about therapeutics and vaccines. 

4 - Too much money on the sidelines and inflows into the market.  We will see more of that money put to work and it will be directed to value stocks. 

5 - Demand is coming back.  You can see it in the manufacturing index and other data.  The market looks out 6 to 12 months out and we are in a position to continually improve.

6 - There are no alternatives to put your cash. You can sit on the sidelines, buy gold, etc.  But those are tough options when you are sitting on tons of cash.

I am not suggesting that we go straight up. I am positioned for a decline but it will be shallow and we will run hard well into Q1 2021.  I am buying all the dips!
I was just shit posting I don‚Äôt know anything about this

story behind flair?
TIL that a barely red day after several gap ups is a dip.
General economic rule of thumb: Anytime the government subsidizes something you get more of it, and the cost significantly increases over time.

This is the explanation for why College, Housing, and Healthcare have all skyrocketed in cost over the last 30 years. It's actually government making these things unaffordable. The opposition to the ACA isn't because Republicans want people to be without healthcare. It's because the ACA has removed market forces in hopes that they can eventually nationalize what it like 25% of the economy.
I need to see them first personally. Especially after the halo debacle.

I do think there is real potential

I got a fucking mad play for you retards. Tomorrow, I'm going in hard on DFEN. At $10 a share for this triple leveraged ETF it's a winning lottery ticket just waiting to explode. The dems were pissed at Trump for pulling the troops outa places, you can bet your fucking tits this ETF is going to explode in the next couple of months when Murica decides some middle eastern shit hole needs some democracy.
It is already reaching my $230 price target for it. I want to take some profits

Big green week. Mango's tantrum is going to boost the odds dems win those two GA senate seats. Odds of big stimulus in Feb improving.
If Trump intentionally tries to dump the market maybe. Not much reason for it not to stop otherwise.

The age old saying of stocks only go up!
Well regulations at the SEC and EPA would continue to be broken down until they are non-existent so strangely enough the market would crash. A lot of people would lose their asses and I don't mean the WSB kids, I mean everyone, because too many shenanigans are already in play and with no watchdogs the rug will be pulled.
If we break out of the Sep/Oct trendline (from the peaks), a lot of buyers will return and sidelined cash will start to fomo in leading to a melt up
Eh I would be more confident in the election conclusion boost than I would be worried of the ER.

I wanted to make Schwab my everything. Roth IRA ,saving ,checking and broker. I want that checking account card so I use it when I travel but they closed it and told me to fuck off pretty much. I just find it weird the moment I funded the account they chose to close it. no explanation. And I got offered an internship from them before the pandemic.

Not holding till expiration man. I‚Äôm just saying, if this run up continues, the delta/theta on those contracts and price are a pretty nice bet where you actually won‚Äôt be able to lose a lot of money. It‚Äôs a decent bet in my opinion.
im counting on it; why i went long on DoD. RTX, LMT, L3 all boomed under obama.

The democrats dont necessarily "gut" military spending, they reduce and redistribute it. To F35s and other weapon systems. Wars aren't won by ground pounders anymore, at least not the wars we're doing. 

The GOP somehow thinks more 11Bs, 0300x marines, and navy ships with 1960 designs are the future.

GOP= more money into old school conventional weapon systems that are outdated

Dems= reducing combat forces that dont see much combat anyways, and shifting more to SOF, drones and other weapon systems.

He isn't the owner of those things, his company is. He may make 1 dollar a year salary with healthcare benefits covered by his employer (his company). I didn't read the article but if he's unemployed then I guess it's his company and he doesn't even "work" there. 

I'm any case the idea is that the assets aren't his personal ones he can pay debts from, but he can use them because it's good company so he uses the car and boat etc
i hope people will believe it and sell off monday so i could buy more
Tell them all to buy in on NIO, problems solved
username checks out. but yes i did sell my UVXY calls at a 55% loss on friday just to rebuy VXX calls for dirt cheap on friday afternoon. if they are also down 50% this week, i will rebuy even cheaper with my remaining 25% and if it hits itll be a 5 bagger and still bring me above my initial investment.

Right but these Canadian companies whose stock prices are increasing cannot supply them. It makes no sense for their price to go up because of this news.
More than half of the people holding PLTR have no idea what they do. Tendies are tendies.

Generally good observation about stocks reaching the end of their run at peak euphoria but Nio is exceptional because it is subsidized by the Chinese government which is bent on outcompeting Tesla

My prediction is tomorrow is going to be green. The fact that nearly  70% Of Mondays are green combined with casual traders buying in tomorrow because of FOMO on last weeks big run up.

However, I do think that NIO will fall. Whenever THIS many people are talking about a stock, it usually means the run up is over. It's been really over performing lately.

POSITIONS: Bought 300$ worth of FSR, long hold. Sold all but one share of NIO Friday.

I‚Äôm down at the sperm donor office every weekend for the extra cash. I would donate plasma for money but I‚Äôve got bone problems. I‚Äôve lost friends and I‚Äôve already accepted that I‚Äôll lose family.

Leveraged baskets are not linear. What this means is that while your short-term single-day math is good your long-term math is actually far off the mark. If you were to reverse your own mathematics you would see that compared to the underlying ETF it leveraged up it actually does have some kind of decay in it in the returns without fees.

ALone we are a twig, but together we a mighty faggot!
DXY on a rip roaring short squeeze this week with no stimulus hopes anytime soon.
So y‚Äôall started a rumor with NIO. ?
What‚Äôs the rumour! I can‚Äôt find it stilllll
Can confirm: I have covid and care more about my 401k than this stupid mild flu that made me feel like shit for 2 days.
I wonder how much a company would pay for listing priority in certain search categories on Robinhood
its depreciating dumbass
Back in my day Apple and google didn‚Äôt run the world.
No influence on the stock but the option chain is different... did MSFT hit 200 at that time?

Spoiler alert, it did not
[deleted]
Long... close, short.
Its ok, i was playing a spread that got murdered too because i fell asleep in the middle of the day lol. Woke up like 5k down and then over the next week nuked my account from 21k to 1k. :| lol oh well it was fun amirite
lovely!
How are none of you Autists talking about MGNI?? Everyone‚Äôs head is too far up NIOs ass to see any other winners
I am not I made my 100% on CGC and sold it, just trying to understand where is all this revenue going to come from. CGC is losing hundreds of millions every quarter.
[removed]
‚ÄòCouldn‚Äôt* care less‚Äô is the correct saying. Look at that, you learned something on a Sunday.
Damn big news if NIO rumour is true
thank you! been thinking this all week.
It‚Äôs depreciating
I think we're gonna be big red tomorrow, because everyone expects green to to election uncertainty fading
[deleted]
But it‚Äôs next to ACB on the weed sector watchlists so if/when it pops it‚Äôll be equally good. 

Sounds retarded, I know. Trust
what's covid?
Why is a hype play better than the actual success of the flight?  Why not do calls for the week after the flight?
Imagine not being in the loop.
Can‚Äôt wait to be a grandpa and tell my kids AAPL used to be under $10000 a share.
Thanks Ivanka
Talking politic before they put up the thread
Got a link?
praying for my tesla 460c 11/20 (-86%) hope i can reduce the loss by diamond handing
And? The original question was whether you‚Äôd want Musk in politics. Because he‚Äôs pushing against what I and many others believe to be totally reasonable precautions in CA, I don‚Äôt think he would have the average American‚Äôs best interest in mind, which is why I wouldn‚Äôt want him to be president. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand
Half of WSB: ha ha just wait, NIO is another Luckin Coffee
Don't you think there will be US based multi state operators that will capture this market share? Why would Canadians stand to benefit so much? The stocks rallied way more than the potential revenue is my point. 

CGC lost $1 billion this summer they gotta sell A LOT of weed to catch up.
Why?
Because the subsidy would disappear, which is going to reduce the overall amount of money going to healthcare. These companies make a lot more now than they used to before Obamacare was implemented. That program benefited health insurance companies more than anybody.

APHA has no US weed interests. their new brewery doesnt give them  a leg up on the weed market at all. we have a massive surplus/GLUT of weed farms and supply of our own already.
Oh, I have to keep that in mind about the long duration in the money leap covered call strategy.  I should've used that instead of selling some of my shares for short term capital gains.  I wanted to wait until long term capital gains but caved.  That would've saved me 17%.  Thanks for all the awesome info!
bear r very fuk  
Bet against america

Why not go 2022 idiot. Jesus christ fucking noobs. You do realize the senate is still up for grabs. The rally we just experienced was due to beliefs the senate was going red. That election is jan5. Also trumps in charge till 1/20/21. 400 is 2022 material

fuck off with GME and RKT
Missed the chance to add nuts instead of mouth. You disappointment
I have ACB Puts on Earnings. I also called the initial pop and made lots of you retards money in the first place. One of us will suffer tomorrow
Go with APHA LEAPs
oh fuck i hadn't considered the timeline on that
Damn now that i see you are doing this i am certain monday stocks will dump 10%

Dollar turning bullish means equities going red
very much paying attention to '09-'15 volatility. hopefully for no reason. seriously.
Poop rally
It‚Äôs a bad company and went up for not good enough of a reason.  People don‚Äôt know how bad this company really is until they see earnings
AAPL at 500 on moon exchange üòé
Probably not lol but I needed at least a little hedge instead of getting raped by never ending green days
People could care less about covid as long as the 401k keeps pumping
They say money never sleeps but I've had this $1 bill on a shelf for years, it's not in circulation. if that's not sleeping what exactly is it doing? Checkmate money never sleeps.
PLTR, weed, and EV‚Äôs gonna moon tomorrow

IDK. But if the Dems control both houses and the presidency, *something* will get done for the economy. Stim packs. Student loan bailouts. IDK what else.

Hopefully consumer spending will rebound and shit gets back to normal.
lmao so many ACB bears here only "because it always goes down after earnings" 

I'll be glad to see your puts go to 0 and this comment will age well
Well we‚Äôll well, how the turntables
first rule of ER plays - NEVER HOLD THROUGH ER DAY
NIO is going to dominate TSLA
This is true. Im over 30/hr (not as high as op), and with covid and the lack of going out and excess expenses I pretty much just have my reg bills(rent/utils/food/health meds) to worry about and even after splurging on a ps5 have been able to save a substantial sum of money over the past 2 months(over a months salary). I know - especially during covid this is not the norm for everyone(lots of people lost their jobs, etc.), but if you have been able to wfh during all this and minimize your spending to necessity it has been pretty easy to save substantial amounts of money.  Its why economists labeled this recovery as a "k recovery". people like me are at the mid point where the down and up lines meet on the K and as income goes up the further up you move on the top line of the K. Like bezos and elon are the tip of the top line for instance.
Ok I have a confession. Market opens when am back home from work. I like to watch the first 5 minutes while am on the toilet seat. Makes me feel lucky and optimistic for the day. I also make some trades in the toiket.

definitely going to get in a new random middle east conflict within the next year.
Tiger Phelps? Isn't that the little kid from Major Payne?
I would assume so. Thats only a week away and I doubt they would make the claim that close to it unless they were pretty confident. China is able to upscale production and build infrastructure very quickly. Especially when government backed companies amd investors have an interest in your success.
Nah. Trade war eases. China is a bigger threat to BABA than Joey Pump
Fuck you, SPY 400 1/15/21
Only positive effect was it brought in money after the tax cuts. But not really, it'll take years before we see any gain from it and that will have to include the rest of the world to have any real effect imo. But it was a start

CGC lost more than $1 billion (canadian) this summer. Be careful
GHIV merger, I'm heavy in warrants, hopefully good idea
Conservative twitter that has more speech restrictions than twitter.
I know. Now you know why everyone hates the IRS.
Someone back tested this to the dot com bust. TQQQ would have lost 99% of its value over the 2 year bleed out. You‚Äôd have needed a 200,000% gain since then to get your initial investment back. Great in hindsight but need balls of steel to hold through the downs.
That‚Äôs all I look forward to at this point
I can't find this on google, who dat
Lmao... Sounds fuckin awful
Ugh...

Got puts to cover my acb calls
so have all the retards selling before erection buying in again?

NIO calls at open if you haven't heard the news retards

Edit: theres no news you retards haven't you seen the 1000+ post about nio?? Jesus fuck
This.  RSI is \~80 right now; buy the dip not the rise.
If NIO dips
And I just don‚Äôt see that on ACB, you might be able to convince me on CGC that it could happen but ACB is just generally in a pretty bad place financially so bad earnings really matter.

Like airlines and cruises can shrug off shit earnings because they have money or plans that allow them to remain in business for awhile even if things go to shit.

ACB on the other hand only really has dilution available in that case.
there's some other good ones

I heard it was facebook for racists but I haven't checked it out myself.
Did any of you read the green new deal? If Biden believed in that he definitely belongs in this sub with the rest of us
If there is one this week. I doubt it though. Market likes certainty when it comes to containing covid and rolling out a stimulus.

Mango's dictatorial inclinations are thoroughly overpowered by his profound laziness and stupidity.

LinkedIn is already stupid as fuck. Political shilling just makes it worse than TWTR
Just started trading futures it is.... interesting
Stocks can rally because they are hype or because they are on a solid foundation. 

This one is rallying strictly out of hype. GameStop is actually fucked in the long run. With the online stores through Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, steam, google stadia, nvidia GeForce now, apple App Store, epic games store, Facebook oculus, htc vive, and I‚Äôm sure, soon to be some amazon game store, there is little to no reason to go to gamestop anymore. I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if Unity and AMD make their own stores. 

And in the future, you won‚Äôt even download a game. You are just going to stream them directly. 

Moreover, in the new console generation physical games are now more expensive than digital games. There‚Äôs no longer a financial incentive to buy physical and trade in.

My friends, you should all pick a new stonk, take your profits and cut your losses. Move along.
Instant no hire for me, not because they support Mango, but because they think LinkedIn is the place for that.  They‚Äôll bring that shit to the workplace guaranteed.

APHA announced US interests. We‚Äôll see.
You buy a bag of 100 M&Ms for $1. It says 100, but it always varies a little. Your buddy is interested in buying them from you, but only if the bag has more than 110 M&Ms in it. You sign a contract saying that if you count the M&Ms and there are more than 110, you will sell him the entire bag for $1.50, no matter how many there are. Even if there are 1000. He pays you 10 cents upfront, non-refundable. 

If you count them and there only 90, that sucks for you, but at least you still got the 10 cents. If there are 1000, that really sucks for you, because you lost out on all of those extra M&Ms, but oh well, you still made 60 cents on the $1 you originally paid. If there are 109, this is ideal for you. You get to keep the M&Ms and the 10 cents he paid you up front.

It has ran up to 27 from 14, but how high can it go?
what‚Äôs the casino like trading futures? Is shorting MES at daily high at close free money?
Yeah but cmon, its fucking NIO. Electric vehicles are the (very near) future and everyone has seen TSLA's meteoric rise. Nobody wants to miss that boat, everyone wants to jump on. This stock is going to 100 sooner rather than later
Each option contract is on 100 shares. So if you have 500 shares, you can sell 5 covered calls

The option price is determined by the market. The theoretical price is calculated based on the Black-Scholes model (or a similar mathematical option pricing model). It primarily depends on the price of the stock, time to expiration, and the implied volatility of the stock (how much people think the price will move)

Read a few Wikipedia articles on stock options before trading them

literally can't be investigated for anything.
This rally is a technical one fueled by speculation like GME rather than a fundamental one. The short float was 38% and got vaporized down to 30% on the day WI and MI flipped lol. A lot of people who have been holding ACB short positions for months (quite literally free money since it's been a downtrend for more than a year) must have decided to finally cover their shorts last week to finally book the profit.
Make enough to not care and then yolo it all on 0DTE to have some feelings.

Well he says rate, but a rate is always proportional. Im pretty sure this 100% rate is a good thing and shows that serious interest in politics more than doubled in some states.

Dude only canopy and tilray have one instance of selling weed to a state for research. Until it‚Äôs not federally banned, they can‚Äôt sell shit here. So this hype will crash soon then maybe hype up again after inauguration.  I bet a few of these companies go bankrupt prior. Good luck. And considering Biden is all about America whose to say why they wouldn‚Äôt want it grown in America especially to double dip on taxes
Start spending it and enjoying
Pull a mr beast and give money to retards to gamble

He wont, because Twitter is gonna ban him on Jan 20.

Congrats on doing the absolute least you could to understand their balance sheet.  A large portion of that debt is Ford Motor Credit financing for their customer‚Äôs purchases.  Since they didn‚Äôt go bankrupt (GM‚Äôs lending division, GMAC, was forcefully spun off to became Ally) they still have their lending arm that generates a couple billion in returns each year.

TL;DR Ford is a bank, too.
Buy puts then, let me know how that works out for you
Cool.  Thanks for the info!  So I will wait until after the New Year to sell my leap call so I can lock in 20% ltcg next year.  And then I will buy equivalent shares so I can have equivalent position.  I was going to exercise the option to postpone the tax bill but I'll be happy with 20% ltcg tax.
We‚Äôve done this so many times already üòÇ
Tommorow it would be a new week a new margin call. Idk why they keep harrasing me, margin isn't even real money lmao.

i think the cdc announcement about them being able to sail again was the last spasm of a dying industry. even if they want to start running cruises again, they have to run mock cruises to ensure everyone's safety. without paying customers. it'll be like shoveling cash into their coal furnaces.
well beware that this may be just the beginning of your father's financial misadventure :)

If it's a solid company not likely.  Look at AMD.  It was a meme stock here for awhile when it was $4/share.
Yeah NIO seems to have a ton of hype around it. it's absolutely worth putting on an intra-day watch list for the next few weeks. Prob worth holding more than a day too depending on how long you want to hold a position.

You own 100 shares of a stock. You sell a call contact and collect the option premium from the sale. Your best case scenario is the stock price rises, but not to the strike of your call option. You profit from the increase in stock price and the option you sold expires worthless.
Bottom line:

Only like 10% here are holding shares
Best bet always on run up to earnings.
It means buy now, wait until it shoots up, sell and take profits before the rocket launch to not lose all your gains on the subsequent dump
there are none, its illegal on federal level. Thats the point. 

People (see dumb retail investors) probably think these companies are American.
thank you!! this is 3000% clear to me. I love you
God damn from your comments in here alone I see why you earned your flair.

Shhhhhh let these retards buy their ACB and CGC calls in peace. Save this for later.
In states where it‚Äôs been legal for 5+ years, yeah there‚Äôs more supply than demand. But the states that just legalized rec or medicinal there is a huge demand and tiny supply. It takes years to get caught up.

If you sell a covered call it means you are selling a call option while also owning the underlying stock. You collect the money from selling the call. Your gains on the stock are then capped at the strike price of the option. If the stock goes above that level, you will need to sell your stock to the person that you sold the call to

Remember HuaWei? TikTok? Increased import tax oppose on JPN‚Äôs vics?  There was never fair market competition lol. But once again , IMO I do think Tesla find itself an opponent here since Chinese EV tech does not lack that much behind and Tesla being copycatted.
Can I get a veganator pls?
Puts on late night shows
You see people here buy option contracts. When you sell a covered call you go to the other end of the trade, you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs selling that call option contract that is bought by others.

**This marijuana rally does not make sense.** 

All these companies are Canadian, they do not sell ANYTHING in USA, they have 0 exposure to the states that legalized marijuana. No additional revenue will come to these companies because of the legalization in USA.

USA has plenty of its own supply, there is no demand for Canadian weed here, there is was more supply than demand. 

This rally is trying to attribute additional sales in USA to Canadian companies that will never sell in the USA. 

Canada already has legal weed, where is this growth going to come from in Canadian weed stocks?
Imagine purchasing Jan 21 contracts when NIO was at $14 and selling at the end of August for a modest 4% gain. FUK

what is a covered call? Explain to me in a language a 5 year old can understand plz
I am only $82 from breaking even now. So close. Breaking even all time feels better then making money over breaking even.
That seems about right
What no. The market is closed. When the market is closed chumps buy expensively. Apply black schooles and you'll see. Wait for the market to move then it's your move.

The facilities have huge fixed costs regardless if they are at 50% capacity or 90% capacity.
I do, I told you I play Curaleaf stateside. If US legalizes though, I believe APHA is a good company to make entry into the US as they are well established. They are also looking very appetizing for a large investor to come along and flood cash into them. They are an attractive possible global play, not just US
Here's the thing w fsly. The iv is super high, I like buying 100 shares and selling a cc, and also a put. I did this back before the crash actually as well, worked out. If you can get 100 shares at 74 let's say, can prob sell a call for 85 and a 60 put 30 dte. Might get 10 for this? I will check on monday. Decent idear tho. Might also sell a put and use that premium to buy a call. Get more convexity this way.

sell the news. buy the dip though

Yep same boat, think all of my options right now probably add up to 3-4% of what I have in the market.  Hell even my brokerage account that is set up for more risky choices is still more than 50% stock.

Doesn‚Äôt mean I am not sitting on some risky shit, I have RKT and PLTR calls for earnings along with more than I probably should in weedstocks, just means I don‚Äôt have serious weight into it relative to my net worth.

Here's the problem though. When the other side doesn't believe or trust you (for good reason), calling into question the democratic process automatically erodes it because, in political wartimes, it can only appear that you just don't like the results. Now the shoe is on the other foot. It's a tricky situation. The biggest loser is public trust in the democratic process because suspicion is rightfully so high. Politicians are, on average, corrupt ghouls in most people's minds. I don't have a solution but it sure seems to be a race to the bottom which won't just go away.

Sitting on some $TNA and $AAPL shares into this week. Got assigned before election week due to freak out. Couldn't sell $TNA covered calls on Friday close since I waited too long but I ain't stressing. Do believe there will be a small continuation or at the very least sideways action for $TNA. $AAPL, for the love of all that is degenerate, make a moon run on event day. Also, announce a new iPad Pro. I want to throw my money at you so give me a reason.

Besides that, making some good gains so far this year. Hoping to break 20% on the fun account and beat $SPY in my Roth account before EoY. (I manage my Roth IRA that I opened this year back in June on safer stocks like $JPM or $AAPL, please don't tell my parents)

* Personal Roth IRA: 6.37%

I am leaning towards giant shit tomorrow as well, but they have been making progress at getting their shit together and we had the surprise beat two quarters ago. I think a lot depends on their cash position, because if that has eroded they are going to need to dilute to raise cash, assuming they haven‚Äôt done so.  Feel like they had an open ability to issue shares at market but I have no clue how the reporting works off that off hand.

I did a bit of digging and it looks like what Biden originally proposed wouldn't have kicked in until someone exceeded $1M in income, which would be okay for the vast majority. I think a plan like what Bernie was proposing would be more or less DOA with opposition by moderates in addition to Republicans.

I don't believe Biden has come up with a solid set of proposals, though, more talking points. Im more worried about potential changes to 401K plans - one of the suggestions I came across was removing the traditional 401K tax benefit in favor of a tax credit at the end of the year... I'll see if I can find the article, its somewhere on the Bogleheads subreddit.

Edit: found it, see this discussion

Fuck you op I didn't read your post either
"Don't throw pearls before swine" is bullshit and everyone should have the important information necessary to make the right decision even if they don't understand it. Most people are uninformed, not unintelligent because we live in a world where middlemen know information is power and they aren't going to let that power out for free, even if they themselves get the information from the government for free.
NIU sells a product that everyone in China needs and can afford while NIO sells cars at a price point that no one in China can afford.  So they are different.

Sold off AMD too early when it hit 80 after not buying enough at 75 on monday. Bought VXX i think on monday at 25.75. One hundred shares to collect that inflated ass theta premium. Immediately sold $25 call for friday. So I sold my AMD too soon and bagheld VXX going so far that even with the $200 call collected, im down. In terms of gains they cancel each other out if I sell VXX now on monday.

I dont know I was thinking Captain America Civil War part 2. You trumpettes gonna do something or keep crying on twitter? Only thing I learned from this is I shouldve sold deep ITM call like VXX $21C collecting less premium compared to $25C if it goes up but much more to gain if it goes down.

Lol i know right. Going on 5 years now, 2 kiddos. No ring but i dont think she would leave me. She might get an extra boyfriend if i keep losing at options tho
Try to stick to the few reputable news sources that have some integrity. Ignore(and block) all these pop-up blogs or obvious spammy websites that churn dozens of articles every day about all and sundry.

You need to realize that boiler rooms are now online only. Check out this doc: https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/m_episodes/2016-2017/quebec-stock-frauds-dan-and-carol-get-busted

These conmen are a digital now and are not only doing penny stocks. The idea is to have you seeing articles left and right about how XYZ is a great opportunity.. It's like advertising, and it works.

Tictok left em that was the reason for the drop in the first place

That would mean that the revenues from the pre-orders are already in. Basically the cash is either accounted for or not before this week. That's the point I'm making; the cash is hopefully going to increase with sales over the next few weeks otherwise this is "it" and we will see the records in the next earnings.
Hmm 2017 to 19 fed didn't buy but it snp500 still went up?

SPY 380 by december
To me it‚Äôs about risk/reward and putting positions on when it seems to be overwhelmingly positive since there‚Äôs no way to know when a top will occur but I do believe you can make bets on when it looks to be in striking distance. In these stocks sentiment seems extreme. Obviously there‚Äôs no way to define extreme but to me I think the end is very near for these stocks. History tells us making money isn‚Äôt easy but now the growth stock crowd is acting as such and calling for ever higher prices. This is where bull markets die.

What do you mean? Earnings later this week are expected to go well. Should see some sort of rally this week imo
Leap calls can get ltcg status per your scenario. 100% sure on that. 

On exercise, I believe you start a new clock. So selling a ltcg option is often superior. 99% sure. 

Convertible notes and other instruments don‚Äôt start a new clock tho. I think the difference is the option exercise involves new investment. Also 99% sure on convertible notes.
How?

The IRS would love to just send you a letter every year with: "Howdy there buddy, here is what we think you pay in taxes based on our data, if there are mistakes or you have anything to add, please reply until June, otherwise we are done here". Instantly 80% of people are done with, and only people with complicated taxes would file in stuff that needs to be checked, so much less work, and much more time to focus on complicated cases. But those taxfillcompanys are lobbying hard against that, every time someone brings it up in congress.

Also the IRS gets no budget, because big donors with many tax lawyers love to cheat on their taxes, and if the IRS cant afford lawyers and investigators they get away with it. Every $ put invested into the IRS catches 5-10$ of taxfraud or something in that neighborhood. Thats 500%+ ROI p.a. with 0 risk. Everyone of us would immediately yolo all our money on that, everyone except corrupt politicians that is.

Good resistance at $72-$73. It got oversold when it hit low of $62.... 2 weeks ago. Climbed back to good support line ($73) going back on the charts before it took off because of tick tok.

If you hold leap call and sell it after holding it for more than a year, does it count as long term capital gains?


What if you exercise the call option and convert it into stock?  Does the clock reset and you have to hold the stock for a year in order to qualify for long term capital gains?

It was initially meant to be a stand alone comment, but the opportunity was there haha. GME is a very misunderstood company at the moment, but sentiment is changing and investors are starting to see the signs. 

Shorts are keeping the price artificially low, but they will eventually capitulate. I am fortunate that I managed to finish building my core position almost 2 months ago and have a lot of downside protection. Upside will take care of itself, I just have to wait.

You ask me for it
You can buy and sell leaps at any time just like weeklies.  The advantage of leaps is the decreased risk.  A bad week won't bankrupt me like it would with a weekly.

Options are available also. The issue isn't the sector, it's the size of the play. Have a good day man.
You just have to hold and buy more when it drops to average down before it goes up.

I noticed a lot of places without drive through have dried up. Pen station and subway going strong because of it. Two steak houses gone bust along with those frew frew frozen yogurt shops for kids. Chinese seems to be doing well, mostly because it‚Äôs a historic take out. Papa Johns has stopped delivery‚Äôs here. I look for them to shut in 5-6 months.

Tree fiddy
Ban.  And add a few days for being a bundle of sticks and making it large font.
Take a break and focus on making money in your day job. I was your age when I lost around the same amount. My lowest was down like -$160K in the span of 7 years. I won't even go in depth of the retard shit I did back in the day (shorting, non-liquid stocks, biotech, etc). 

It was rough losing year after year. But, trading is the only thing I really enjoyed. I just sucked at it and luck wasn't on my side. 

But this year, I've made back all my losses and then some. My goal now is just to not fuck it up. So there is hope. Take a breather and good luck.

Dropping from 10 to 2 is far greater a fall than 2 to 1 .. especially since you‚Äôve already hit the ‚Äúalleged bottom‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm not saying I necessarily agree .. I‚Äôm saying this is why they people think this way... you inquired lol. 

People want the biggest bang for their buck with as little perceived risk as possible .. catch it at the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù and the only way is up

The subsequent fear from the crash crawling back to ATH is the bubble, and we did it all with a sweet potato in office. Turns out the top is a convertible, and the floor is just a trampoline, as long as inflation exists and the Fed don't want to look poor.

Quality comment from a genius
$FCX 20c
TLDR: You have large "realized" gains in 2020 say $100K and large "unrealized" losses for 2020 say $100K - make sure you "realize" the $100K loss prior to 28 Dec (to allow for settlement) or be prepared to pay $35K in taxes in April.  Also once you realize the loss...don't buy back the same security for 30 days or it will be a "wash" sale and you won't actually "realize" the loss.

This is your decision to be discussed with a tax professional or by doing your own research at the IRS.   ---

Nobody wants to split votes. I want votes to be certified per the 12th amendment which anyone who cares about democracy should be in favor of? Given the unprecedented number of mail in ballots and that they aren't passing simple mathematical laws to detect fraud I've only stressed waiting for election results to be certified since it appears Trump won't concede the seat prior to the 14th unless Biden gets 270 certified.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just gonna die or resign‚Äù so Kamala can go into power and she‚Äôs a scary far left socialist and Biden‚Äôs just a moderate, except they also say Biden is a scary far left socialist in all the talking points except the Kamala one so what‚Äôs the difference?

Ockham‚Äôs razor dictates that no one wants to be their dad‚Äôs bag man. We‚Äôre all here because we escaped his bag and fucked an egg. Never again. And if we‚Äôre using that as the level, Bidun and Trum p aren‚Äôt even comparable. The only difference then is at least Joey Pump had the decency not to go after Trum p‚Äôs kids in the debate. Ivana Jr. is Donny Pump‚Äôs bagman. Who the fuck was their clown accountant they hired. I need to know to divine my option calls for the santa rally.

Idk what you mean by this but in order to profit from the option, it needs to go above & beyond the strike price, if you were to sell for a profit by the time it expires on 11/13, yes NIO would need to be worth above $44.2 as a stock price to gain any sort of profit. If its only 42$ upon expiration you lose all your money you paid for the premium, in this case over 2000$

Hi
Kind of yes - there was a let it slide attitude prior to him... with big emphasis on the TPP, which wouldn't have worked at all. The main outcome is that Trump made the Biden rhetoric a bit tougher to match. 

It's probably too late regardless though.. China are still on track to grow at 7%+ in perpetuity - and that means them wearing the pants in 20-30 years - and the writing being on the wall for this in 10-15.

Could it be so a bunch of dumbfucks erroneously think the "economy" is good and then therefore vote for the guy who authorized this? 

Retirements. Too many people have their retirement funds tied up in a speculative stock market that's been overinflated for 7+ years and now it's hard to let it reset without destroying the value of the money those people dumped into it for almost a decade.

It may not be Trump's calculus, but I think that's a big part of why the Fed was so keen to reinflate the market. Well that, and jpow is a former investment banker so I'm sure his buddies were thankful that he bailed their overleveraged asses out by allowing them to reinflate the bubble.

Sleepy Joe is rejoining the Paris Climate accord and we can expect immediate Executive Orders favoring clean energy.

The sentiment could shift if Dems lose the Georgia run-off election on January 5th, because that would mean no Blue Wave to push big boy clean energy bills through a divided Congress.

Even so, I think going long will still pay off with a Dem in office. There will be expectation for more executive orders.

I don't know if we'll see that type of bearish volatility like we did in march for a long time, sure we may have some big red weeks at some point before stim and vaccine, especially if more places go back on lockdown, but we rallied through rising cases and death counts, while many businesses were crippled and so many unemployed. We crashed due to panic selling and fear mongering. People are far too prepared for a crash at this point, coronavirus came out of nowhere and was a shock for a lot of people. We went from swine flu talk to apocalypse in the tp aisle. More people are prepared now, stocked up on tp, and in the end this market probably brought in more new investors than it lost. Even Warren fucking Buffet got smoked, but it won't happen again. People aren't scared of Covid anymore, as ridiculous as it sounds. We have seen the unknown, a lot of people are dying but if you're young, wear a mask, and stay home, you're probably good. The boomers are dying, or retiring due to the risk, and young healthy investors will be taking their salary, and investing in growth sectors like EV's and renewable energy. We haven't seen the stock market deal with a pandemic like this before, and I think we got a strong bear bubble where people were actually questioning if stonks go up. Now we know, they do, and every dip before Biden will be bought up in a matter of days, if not, hours. Stock market will do well next 4 years with pent up growth and innovation. We will diamond hand covid losses and unemployment until the next mango takes office and sends us back to the dark ages, when America was truly great.

Everyone will miss him. I even wrote a eulogy for him

&#x200B;

*Today, I have the honor of reintroducing you to Trump ‚Äî better known to many as ‚Äúü•≠‚Äù.*

*Born June 14, 1946, Husband to Melania, ex to one more immigrant and an American, Father of five children (known), affair with 7 known pornstars while married, 17 grandchildren, bank-rupter (11C), friend and storyteller/story-maker to all else who meet him.*

*We are here today to remember the volatility and bull market he leaves in America. It was a long and simple bull market: never complex and always with enough dips for bulls to fucking buy them.*

*I would never say I liked him, or even most of his policies, but what I would say is there is no one else in the world, trader me would have wanted as a president. While I‚Äôm sure he would enjoy all this bragging about how much we love and already miss him, he was never someone who appreciated the overly poor. He would much rather see us liking him from a distance. Remember, this is a man who likely did not realize how big a deal his tweets were and how they affected thousands of retards at wsb.*

Man rejoining the group that could help with the pandemic -- only 30 million people lost their jobs (or as Trump put it -- "I put 11 million people back to work!") -- I mean, can you imagine what the economy would be like if the country could defeat the pandemic like other countries?

With Gore, you were talking about a difference of \~500 votes in a single state (e.g. a situation where a single Court decision could be decisive). With Biden, you're talking about tens of thousands of votes in multiple states (e.g. a situation where it would require multiple Court decisions and would effectively gut American democracy by overturning an election). It's over, Johnny. It's over.

Yep this is the truth b/rother. If you get married in this world you are an absolute retard. You're basically getting the girlfriend experience in exchange for surrendering half of your net worth and get kids whose healthcare and education costs will prevent you from retiring before 70 and who will never love you as much as you want them to. The real chad move is just to fuck around until that's boring and then to save and retire early and let no one in on your pile of gold

What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13

If GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)

4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.

All of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.

GME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+

You could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.

Most investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.

In the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.

And China is going to be propping up NIO. They are looking for a Chinese-owned Tesla/Elon and NIO isn't too far off from seriously ramping up production and attempting to compete. China was late gaining market share in the automotive industry, and is still behind in the luxury car market, but they don't want to miss their chance at breaking through in the luxury EV market. I think NIO will ramp up very hard over the next 4 years, but it's hard to say if they will make a lasting impact outside of China or ever reach the level Tesla has got to in the U.S. People are hungry for BMW, Mercedez, Audi, etc. to come out with more luxury EV's so they don't feel forced into a Tesla. Nio doesn't have the international brand loyalty to jump start their entrance in the market, but Biden should be good for the automotive industry, and will expedite trade with China so they can at least test the market and build some more hype before they would hypothetically crash and burn. This is still the beginning of NIO, they clearly have growth ahead of them as a company, so I'll let you decide what that means for the stock price. Maybe it will all be priced in during this run-up, but I doubt it, they seem poised to surprise American shareholders once they find some consistency. "The 17 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for NIO Inc have a median target of 155.80, with a high estimate of 310.32 and a low estimate of 44.12." Get in with shares, and cut losses if they ever go back below $35, maybe they settle into  the $40-$50 range for the next month or two, but seems like they are poised to break out eventually and I think there are some deep pockets with a keen eye on it.

bro just go to options profit calculator .com and it will show you how your option will do. pick a date that you expect this to be all over, and then add a month for theta decay, (theta will decay your option exponentially quicker as it aproaches expiry and usually kicks in about a month toll expiry.). you can use their option finder and it will give you the best option for an expected price at a given date.

Always place the price on bud or below. Depending on the direction of movement and your strategy for the play. But if you have watched it fluctuate for a few days/hours you will know the spreads in premiums and will know to place an opening offer closer to the ‚Äúbid‚Äù, lower, etc. Also need to select number of contracts. Which will be multiplied times 100 per every 1 contract. Make sure to sell it back to the market once you get 20-30% or higher to begin locking in some gains. Good luck bud!

For the TI haters, COST had a symmetrical continuation triangle on 9/28 with a PT of $374-380 in \~17 days. COST then proceeded to hit 382 2 weeks later. Just food for thought
So many retards just jumped on FOMO to get raped before market open. Then they gonna ask why?
Nope
Do we have a timeframe of when it‚Äôs suppose to happen?
1. WSB sentiment is bullish
2. Orange baby likely to rage fuck the stonks market
3. This and the inverse WSB principle means we will trend bearish
4. Therefore I must inverse myself and buy calls

I mean NPR is a joke by that standard although their local affiliates are horrifyingly bad - at least the one I hear (WAMC). So what options do we have? NYT? They admitted they needed to get back to objective journalism and never did. 

Compared to all the others Fox News has something of comparable to offer.
So why is no one mentioning this with regards to Chinese stocks:

> In May 2020, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly [passed](https://www.bloombergquint.com/politics/senate-passes-bill-to-delist-chinese-companies-from-exchanges) a bill (Senate measure S. 945) that, if passed into law, could lead to a delisting of all foreign companies unless they were able to certify that they are not owned by or under the control of a foreign government. These companies will also need to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board to audit their books for a consecutive three-year period for the purpose of verifying such a status.

You're missing the point. They don't actually think that, they just want to believe it. Similar to how people believe in religion because they want to believe in heaven, an eternal paradise where they can go if they just follow the rule book.

If they can not certify a majority of electoral votes by the 14th of December it goes to the quorum also set up by the 12th amendment. In this quorum each state gets one vote in the House with each member for each state voting and the majority winning their individual state vote. As of right now it is 26 red states, 22 blue, 2 are a tie. If they can not certify 270 for Biden by the 14th with 81 million mail in ballots (750,000 in 2016) Trump will remain your president unless he concedes the election. If you need a source you should read up on the 12th amendment.
Dude it doesn't matter if they don't make money enough to be worth their valuation. Their fair market value right now is probably half their valuation in a best case scenario.

Why the fuck gamble on an idea when you have thousands of better companies with better valuations?

Same with Unity. That's my play.

They are going to report losses again. Buy puts for 2021. All of these ABC pump posts are from people who either bought calls before the jump and have already sold or by bagholders hoping people are dumb enough to buy in and crank up the share price so they can break even.

Seriously, anyone even thinking about buying into ABC should just put their money under their matress. It will be safer there.

I have a small position expiring Friday and I‚Äôm wondering the same thing. It looks like the whole market dumped the day after earnings in sept.  So that may have a lot to do with it. Zillow just popped 10% after earning last week, so hopefully rkt follows the same trend.

I'm against many things that China (mostly the CCP) do. Human rights are non existent. Privacy is non existent. Audits are non existent. They also spy on other countries, invade other countries in broad daylight, and do millions of other disgusting stuff while putting on a fake smiling facade.

But.

There are things Chinese do well. Like manufacturing. Like copying inventions and doing it at megascale. Like cross-border logistics. Like controlling Covid (at least if you believe them, which I don't 100%, but there is probably some truth to what they claimed)

So while I condemn China on many many fronts, when it comes to putting my money NOW, I think I'd put my dollars on China, at least till the case count of the west stops making all time highs like the stock market.

It's just good business..
U should be able to sort your past comments from ur profile by new and top like everything else. I wanna reminisce on old discussion thread memories

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs overly complicated. But if you‚Äôre making trades or have multiple deductions you should use someone or software. No reason to stress out on taxes in my opinion.
Weird how I explicitly said I don‚Äôt think there would be any significant civil unrest, and the damage has been done ideologically. Thanks for saying it was a good read but you didn‚Äôt really read.
Wait wut?

This. So is CNN, don‚Äôt worry Trumper.
First, disclaimer: I think if Trump tried that the GOP & Dems would unite to force him out and make Pence POTUS to ensure a peaceful uneventful transfer of power. See 25th Amendment Section 4.

He could executive-order all kinds of tariffs and otherwise mess with trade agreements. The problem with that though is everyone would know he's just angry and it won't matter in 73 days. [Biden has already said he's signing a bunch of executive orders](https://politicalwire.com/2020/11/07/biden-plans-flurry-of-executive-orders/) so whatever Trump does will be undone pretty quick. 

I think the only sure bet is VIX and I'm holding SPY 340P december 31st.

Why?
He will probably pass a nice fat stimmi so the dems dont take over the senate come december.
Georgia run off election isn't until January 5th. If Dems win 2 seats the Blue Wave is still happening. If not, Biden will be limited to his Executive powers only, with only much tamer policies making it through a divided Congress. What does this mean for the market? Overall market will be flat as yo mama. Pay attention to sector rotations.

So, about RKT.. why did it even dump again so much after previous earnings..? can't just be profit taking.. why would these earnings be different if so?
Right. For the $80-$100 it costs its worth the stress free upload. Reddit gets up in arms over paying for the software, but if you make trades it‚Äôs worth every penny.

I‚Äôm up 43% in 2020 with only trading shares, and it wasn‚Äôt day-trading. I used options only when I was bearish in mid Feb (made a pretty nice return before going back bullish in shares), and some more puts in mid-summer that were breakeven/small losses. 

Currently holding shares in 7 different growth stocks, waiting to sell 1-2 at next market peak. I know this type of trading/investing won‚Äôt make you rich over night, but if you can be relatively consistent by treating your portfolio like it‚Äôs your own personal hedge fund - you have a better chance at success than yolo-ing all of your money into shit that expires in a week. That‚Äôs like betting all of your money on which way the wind will blow next.
Uuuuhhhh.... what!!!!???!?!?!?

Your example was spot on.

This week is definitely going to be the week to start preparing defensive moves. 

We are going to be trending in the wrong direction in regards to Covid cases over the next two weeks.
$10,000 / 6 = $1,666. $1,666 / 0.90 = $1,852. $1,852 / 40 = $46.3 post tax. Probably $55-60 an hour? Or $30 an hour with loads of over time. That‚Äôs doing ‚ÄúOK‚Äù as long as OP isn‚Äôt injured like my paw. He fucked up his back mining Pike county coal and couldn‚Äôt work anymore. I remember what he said. Oh it brings me to chills. He said one of these days you‚Äôll get out of these hills if you keep your nose to the grind stone and out of the pills. If only dad had warned me about theta decay and priced in to boot.
Given the results haven't been certified yet and 108 times the mail in ballots of 2016, I wouldn't assume he's out in 11 weeks just yet. Republicans retaining the senate is good for the market but with the Democrats getting Biden in if the senate flips in 2 years tech will tank.

Unlike in the US, where it's not that simple for the government to manipulate stock prices, though God knows that JPOW has tried (and partially succeeded with unlimited QE, though technically the Fed isn't the government), in Gina the government is in charge of the market. It's not a "free" market like in the West.

So readers have two fundamental choices:

1. You believe that NIO is a symbol of national pride in Gina, and that the government will not let it fail. If so, go unlimited bullish on it.
2. You believe that NIO became what it is through local government corruption, and that the central government will make an example of the local peasants. If so, go unlimited bearish on it.

Sales figures, EPS, P/E, ER, etc, have **absolutely nothing** to do with whether NIO moons or goes splat.

Short term depends. ACB and TLRY earnings on Monday. They are honestly both poorly managed companies, and could very easily shit the bed again. Plus, I have to imagine some amount of this is priced in (despite the wild surge). There were enough republicans in favor of decriminalizing already, and the GOP will still hold the senate either way. 

I just don't think it's that simple. That said, good earnings Monday and I expect they will absolutely explode. Hard to see it though - bad earnings throughout COVID for cannabis (generally), APHA just shit the bed last earnings and they are one of the better managed companies.

It also partially depends if they are done writing off their shitty acquisitions or not. I haven't followed closely enough to say.

Here's my two cents. I think it will be a flat week of mostly consolidation around 350.

The market is deciding what to make of a Biden win with a divided Congress.

I'm sticking with clean energy, solar, China, EV, and medicare stonks. Sure, a Blue Wave probably isn't coming, but the rhetoric will pump these sectors, along with Executive Orders. We also know Biden is re-entering the Paris Climate Agreement in January, which bodes well for these sectors. I view these sectors as safe havens in an otherwise uncertain time.

The overall market however  probably won't see much movement. Biden is pretty moderate and Congress is divided, preventing drastic changes from happening, aside from the occasional Executive Order. We'll see a gradual melt up to new highs as volatility continues to decrease. I'm not expecting any drastic dips or spikes.

Don‚Äôt go into 2021 with net realized gains unless you set aside money for taxes or pay them now. If you have unrealized losses, consider realizing now to offset those gains also. Failure to plan could result in huge tax bills even if you make losses next year.
If somebody is paying you they aren't getting much for their money.

TurboTax handles uploading buy/sell data from brokerages and it will figure out everything for you.

1. Learn what you did wrong. Don‚Äôt buy weekly‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt buy options at all if you don‚Äôt want to hedge them. 
2. Put your money in boring ass fuck ETF‚Äôs. Monthly deposits and dump more in them at a market correction. 
3. If you really want to trade, sell OTM options on stable stocks. Collect that premium. Sure, no big gains there, but a steady gain and relatively low risk.

I bought on Friday 18,000 shares, they have earnings coming out on Wednesday, due to the pandemic I think sales will be good. Plus with Biden and Kamala decriminalization of weed think it will help out SNDL and the other weed stonks. I'm thinking this will open @ $0.36 (20% up on after-hours Friday, I think it will go at least another 20% on premarket) and moon up to $1, if it hits $1 who knows where it will end up. There's a lot of talk of it on [https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SNDL](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SNDL) 12,000+ followers. That's just my personal opinion tho.

However, all three times I went cash after selling my bearish positions a little too early and then either bought the dip too early or didn‚Äôt buy it at all. 

Granted, I‚Äôm still up pretty nicely for the year but i keep imagining how much more I‚Äôd have if i participated in the august rally, the dead cat bounce in early October, and the dead cat bounce last week.

If you're going to trade the SP500 index futures, then it's like buying SPY but with leverage but without the stuff you have to deal with when buying options like theta. Also, no PDT rules. Depending on the broker you use, you may need a lot of capital though. Some you only need $400 per contract (for day trades) while others, you need $17k.

You don't hold options through ER. Every company price other than PINS has fallen after earnings, despite blowout numbers. TSLA drops after earnings. They crushed deliveries, price rode up to ER (460) and then dropped. Expect NIO to do the same. Buy calls on Monday that expire 11/20 and sell around this thursday.

Also, I have a feeling that the Biden presidency will help this stock A LOT. Obama administration and the Dems have been so big on tracking people domestically due to terrorist suspicions. Most likely they're gonna seek to continue these activities, if not intensify them now with all the Tr*mp supporters jacked to the tits on ARs and cheap Walmart ammo.

I bet all big bois in the market know this will grow quite fast which is why they jumped on this so quickly as Biden got projected as a winner.
Yes news break here fast
I‚Äôm 23 so I have experience +/- 7 years my age. At all ages (especially the younger crowd) snap is used as a separate form of messaging. No shit people will text and snap at the same time.  Also obv horny intentions with the photographic nature of snap. Instagram is used as your public facing page that is curated based of whatever bullshit this individual decides. Ever heard of a finsta? Fake Instagram. One person, two Instagram accounts, the second one being a burner where they post things they otherwise would not on their public page. Probably more prolific in the 25 and under crowd.

3,141 counties.
Again and again I guess since it seems to be necessary,  its the massive spikes and the reasons behind them that I'm worried about and perplexed that it's not talked about. Explain what will happen when the majority of this QE comes due in April? Upwards of 3 trillion will evaporate from this fake economy. Default? Lol, that'll go over good with the world. Maybe they'll stick with dollars when they find out what we did, maybe not. 

The premise of QE has always been to loan based on future growth to cover the printing. We're in uncharted territory when theres a massive contraction for the whole economy. My contention is that some deflation would have been fine considering the situation. It would have been much more efficient to put money in the hands of the people rather than the corporations due to the fact that the issues with a destitute populace due to the pandemic are not going to magically disappear even if the pandemic goes away tomorrow, let alone ravages the economy for the rest of the winter. 

Printing a fuck ton of money to keep giant corporations stock prices high was the dumbest thing we could have possibly done, especially when you consider the word of the day is stimulus which is... printing more money

My prediction; inflation on a massive scale after the dollar is dumped as the world's currency in favor of one from a responsible government and biden will take the blame.
Don't do it. Lost 14k in spy puts last week. This market is too drunk to use logic.

This is also what I am seeing. Hence my question if and when a consolidation between IG and SNAP could happen. The ultimate business for both companies are the same, they just need to drive traffic for ad dollars.

My initial ‚Äúplan‚Äù was to trade weeklies. For 3 months I would open positions on Monday that were 15%+ OTM and wait for them to expire by Friday. I was up around $7k and got the God complex, started opening the same positions but the week before, then 2 weeks before for more premium. Had I stuck to the initial plan of 15% OTW per WEEK this would‚Äôve never happened. Instead I did -15% OTW 2 weeks out and got cucked
Wouldn't it be üò¥‚òï ?

Yes, FB owns IG. Bought them for a billion dollars back in the day. But the general trend is that more and more people are leaving fb.com in favor of just having an IG account. What's left on fb.com is mostly older users, while "younger" (think late 20s to early 40s) users tend to populate IG.

Most of the teenager/college users are all on TikTok, and much of the content they post on IG are just reposts of their TikToks.
I did too. But... Earnings are reported on Wednesday. It's going to the moon. Looking forward to seeing what happens now that Biden won over the weekend.

Better yet, abort. Abort your children, degenerate scum.

This may be becuase of lack of knowledge. But not all state are certified and there are recounts in all states with 1% or less difference. The media may project who would win but congress tell us. Look up what happen to Gore in Bush vs Gore.

Anyone remember MSFT 3/20 200C gang?

In Feb, specifically Feb 10 and 11, we ran up the price of MSFT 3/20 200C and every call option near it on the chain. Check MSFT IV and price action on those dates. It was epic. There was a guy who posted over and over and got others to spam 3/20 200C in the daily threads.

Unusual activity alerts were going off for MSFT and Bloomberg was running pieces on how much MSFT calls cost relative to puts. Seriously, these people who say "Robinpoors have no influence on 1T+ market caps" have no idea how modern models price options.

I mean, FB tried outright to buy Snapchat but failed, so they're content with copying all of Snapchat's features.

The biggest thing TikTok has going for it is its recommendation algorithm. Unless FB can copy that, they will continue to lose ground as older users migrate from FB to IG, which tends to drive the younger users away.

Agree too. I'm sure Feb and onward in 2021 will be easymode... market will probably know this in January. But Nov and Dec still have significant risks... COVID, Election Contest, Social or Political Unrest, and profit taking in 2020.

Imagine running billions of dollars in a huge fund and you're up a crazy amount in 2020 in one of the worst economic times in history with some of the highest uncertainty ever recorded. Are you gonna book profits this year? All you need is a few firms profit taking and a little bit of fear before many run for the exit doors to lock-in some gains.

What about the fact that the economic recovery and stock markets in the rest of the world flatlined like a square root? WSB thinks this market can keep its strong momentum from the March bottom indefinitely... yea no way.

While you were out partying I was studying the BLD. Their call/put price skew is 60%/50% or a 20% difference which, along with positive analyst ratings, shows some strong bullish sentiment and potential. I'd do put credit spreads instead of straight calls though since insulation isn't exactly a high-flying industry.

Anyone else expecting a "sell the news" type thing for Apple on Tuesday?
Elon Musk just made a jealous tweet about them, basically guaranteeing they hit $420 per share. 

They also exceeded production estimates recently and just announced this week they plan to work double shifts. They won't double output based on this but it will increase at least 30-50% (in my opinion not theirs).

They are also backed by the government and there is a new ev wave coming if we're not already in it. 

I honestly think this stock has Tesla potential. I think the fundamentals are decent but it has huge meme potential and I am not underestimating that combination.

I don't expect it to get back to Summer 2019 levels anytime soon, if ever, but it's highly volatile within a mostly defined trading range.   Took a big hit this week with the election and drop in oil prices.  Thus the calls.   

I'll likely sell the shares before year end if the price recovers a bit as a tax loss offset, but will likely still keep a toe in it or another petroleum play as there's usually an overreaction to all election stocks.

I remember what it felt like losing a grand.  Very bad.  That was the worst one i think.  After that. 10k? 20?  Comes with the territory.  Paperttrading doesn't weigh on you the same; doesnt have that visceral impact, that well, should not trigger decisions.  Emotion is a real variable that cannot be ruled out in trading, me thinks; it's a matter of knowing, through experience, how emotional i.e. foolish one can be, does one learn.  Some dummies only learn the hard way.  Or sometimes don;t learn squat, but that is whole other topic.

If we have a dip which I believe we will, it will be short-lived (5%).    Do not push hard in either direction until you see confirmation.
This
My first play was INTC 07/17 $60 put I paid $920 for and sold 5 days later for $1657. After that I deposited more and did a few more plays a couple days later with my profits and principle. $1320 on INTC $57.5 put (ended up selling for $2,240),$1350 on APT 03/20 $15 call (ended up selling for $12,093). 

Then I just started making small outrageous bets from the end of Feb till mid March that I would buy at close and sell at open, these included SPY puts, VIX calls, AAPL puts, cruise puts, airline puts, casino puts, F puts, etc. I saw the bottom and was thinking holy shit this is low as fuck, but of course bought back in thinking it could go lower. It didn‚Äôt.

The week before my birthday is when the bottom hit. 

If I would have bought a week before my birthday, and just held I could have made so much fucking money. September fucked me real hard too.


Lesson of the story.

** it‚Äôs worth it to be patient to buy low and just hang on for dear life**. I sold way to early, and kept fetching for the bottom for too long... which is why I went from $4k - $135k - $75k instead of becoming a millionaire through probably the easiest time in human history to do so.

Now I‚Äôm looking forward to TSLA NIO PLUG AMD and various other companies to do well.

Why?
It‚Äôs a fuel tech company that is not successful in fuel tech. It‚Äôs a lighting company that‚Äôs not selling lights. Note that the pandemic did not affect darkness. Finally, the Yahoo report does not indicate if this contract is actually profitable, just that the value of the gross sale. And that report is nothing more than a regurgitation of the report the company filed with the SEC.

This is lining up to be a spectacular pump & dump.

I foresee the markets down tomorrow on rona fears. Shit's about to get wild. US headed for another 200k-300k deaths this winter.

Election is old news; Biden was decided last Wednesday & results priced in on Friday. What's next for the market?

S&P 3520 and 24 VIX is super optimistic. Aswath sees S&P intrinsic value at 3100. Mike Wilson from MS sees market rangebound from 3100 to 3550ish.

If we are green tomorrow I'll be happy about cheaper puts and open a medium-term short around 3550. Been monitoring significant rise in Dec 18 short positions opened on Th/Fri. Most bullish positions are for Feb-Apr of next year.
We've had 4 years of being pumped by orange policies - I think this will end up being a sell the news situation. Biden will walk in the door and everyone will go *"yay stability! oh btw we're way overvalued for a boring stable environment, this is the pump value that prices in high volatility and growth and low corporate taxes. sell sell sell"*

Agreed. It may spike short term but that will be short lived
With even Airbnb trying to get a deal done before the end of the year, a blue win, and with SNOW, SQ and PLTR trading at big multiples, I am even more confident than I was a month ago that we will get a deal done by my predicted date.

This is so hard man. I don‚Äôt understand why people go head first into trading without first doing paper trades or doing something small like $1000 for the first year or two.

You know I never understood why people would buy merch from youtubers or influencers.

You‚Äôre right there‚Äôs no requirements, but most banks have a retention policy. They keep them for X time, varies per bank. Especially the checks in question in this post. Now, they don‚Äôt ask you to send them because there‚Äôs an electronic copy being made as soon as you make it that stays with the bank for a while. What do you think happens when a check gets rejected? The bank will send them a legal copy of it that they got from the mobile deposit scan. 
There‚Äôs no requirement to keep the physical check but they sure are kept for a while.

Do we know what OPINION PIECES are? They contract freelancers to write these takes, and basically every other take there is.
People worry about large players like they remotely understand them. The policies won't matter.

When a policy gets passed, what you see on the surface vs what actually happens is vastly different. 

But hey, expect dampened returns. Get into real estate or something.  Like I already said. I CAN NOT WAIT for Biden to do something with taxes. People will make the wrong moves and it will be easy money. There's nothing better than scared people for making money in markets.
Sad fucking question that I don‚Äôt even want to think about.

Ford is beaten up pretty badly in terms of brand. It‚Äôs considered an old persons stock that coupled with watching the subpar performance of the stock makes it of no interest to the new investors. 

New investors like sexy fast gains and cult like followings. They don‚Äôt see the potential for that with Ford. 

Luckily Ford is finally holding over 7 but without the dividend and some xnxx premium type news they won‚Äôt moon they will more than likely slowly March up to 10-12 a share as older money starts buying back in over the next year or two. 

Ford is officially a member of the first wives club .. a boob job and hair dye job won‚Äôt get her top price on the market anymore ... she‚Äôs aging out. But there will always be a subset that want to take a relatively hot unproblematic GILF for a spin

Lol ofc the dollar will devalue since the 1920's. It's called inflation. The fed has no mandate to stabilize currency, especially not in the sense that you're implying (maintain the same value). Ofc you can have stable currency that still loses value with a stable inflation rate. The dual mandate of the fed is max employment and stable prices. Both of which it has done a good job of historically and certainly is getting much better at (their response to the covid crisis is one of the key reasons we recovered so quickly and smoothly, the other being the Cares act). If anything maintaining inflation helps poor people more cause they tend to have more debt than savings. The problem is the wages haven't been increasing enough to keep up with inflation or productivity, especially the minimum wage. That is more of a problem with the loss of labor power since the 80's, especially union membership, and the increasing adoption of neoliberal economic policies. Certainly the fed has not been doing as much as they could to help with that, and I don't think they have particularly cared about it (eg their definition of max employment is outdated and has also led to decreased labor power cause they have historically raised interest rates whenever it looks like the labor market is tightening bc they are scared of outdated theories like NAIRU).

One of the most miserable nights of my life involved opiate constipation. Went fishing with a buddy in college and smoked a joint with a big rail of opium in it.

Facebook already owns whatsapp.  Dude who invented it monetized it to the tune of about $13B.
Model 3 is awesome. 

But model 3 is 40k. This one is 43k minus the 7500 credit, and will have a fast sell as soon as it hits the dealership. Since ford isn't only word of mouth advertising, I think they'll have a fast run up.
I can‚Äôt stand Elon Musk as a person, but man does he do some cool shit.
If RKT has strong earnings again this quarter, maybe it will reverse last quarter dump on earnings. The hype from the IPO probably just got sold off. I'm thinking if it runs up into earnings, sell off enough to cover cost plus some profit and hold some through. I could see it getting in the 25-30 range and holding.

You're absolutely not. In fact there has been talk that he would continue the effort of trying to break up the big tech monopoly. He might even try and split the contract  to keep one company from dominating it, doubly under the effort of his WPA/FDR new deal effort that way multiple companies are pulling in more business simultaneously. 

Implying thst he would move it to a foreign company doesnt make any sense at all. We are not arguing the same thing.

Well I think the difficulty for analysts and analyzing anything for that matter is that all analysis is granted based on what is currently true. For instance some facts:

1. Cohen is not actually on any management team. In fact Cohen isn't even involved in any decision making officially. Cohen is a major stakeholder and that is it.

2. All-Star team in place there still needs to be work done. You can't make an analysis on potential alone. That would be like me deciding that because it is possible for you to make all the right moves in your life, regardless of likelihood and your current situation, putting all my money on you. We have yet to see if the brand can be saved and reinvented.

3. Burry is not involved at all actively with Gamestop. Much like Cohen Burry's Scion is a shareholder, yes, but as far as I have ever seen he has never ever attempted to actually make any decisions or even influence the decisions of Gamestop as a company. Scion has been a major shareholder for years so if it was Burry driving the ship he's either completely gone off his rocker or it is unsaveable anyway. 

And that is where we are with those points at this time in the timeline. Can any of this change? Absolutely. Cohen can become an activist investor, Scion in general may boost capital through more investment to grant greater heights and the all-star team may dominate some unknown market segment and rebrand Gamestop to some epic thing no one realized was possible.

But none of this has actually happened yet. And so it might really be, at this time, worth almost nothing.
Not to mention NIO and Tesla are only popular because of their affordable EVs.

Those of us who actually have money are able to make significant gains on 30-40% over two years. Probably more than your entire portfolio, if you haven't lost it all yet.
They're terrified of his petulant wrath if somehow he figures out he's the sinking ship and they're all the rats.
If your net for the year is realized losses you are fine. The problem is if you end the year with net gains then make losses next year and don‚Äôt have the money for taxes. Or if you just make a ton of losses and no path to make large gains against them.

Economy was fine and markets were doing well before any tax cuts. Corporate tax cuts only juiced markets short term but at a tremendous expense to national debt which did not slow down one iota under Trump.  You think the US can continue to pile on debt?  How will we ever pay it down with greatly diminished tax revenue?  All corporations did was buy back their own stock and now they expect taxpayer backed bailouts? Get fucked.

You obviously didn't pay attention to 8 years of the Obama administration. Nor have you listened to everything he has said over the past year or so while running for president. It's not the "U.S. media" calling him a liberal. It's everything he has said and done over the past 10 years or so. Try to keep up.
It's still called a ford. They own Lincoln? Maybe if their luxury brand can get going. Doubt it tho. Ford = f150s
I read about some old law from like 1877 where if the election is contested in January  I think each state gets a single vote to choose the president based on the majority of their representatives and the GOP has fewer representatives overall but one or two more states where they have the majority. That‚Äôs one thing, though I might‚Äôve butchered it

I think so too. Knowing that people want to only hang out with you because of your trust fund. Then you resort to make up bullshit stories to make your life interesting.

Are we too bullish on BABA? Last week was tough if you got in at 300 plus.. but good for those that got in at 290 ishh..
You still have 2 more grand to loose. You got this. Let us know when you're at 0

I lost 500 bucks Friday what am I going to bet on to lose 500 more Monday?
I have realized gains that I have since given back and now I have realized losses and am 6k in losses total, do I need to make this back by January? Am I going to owe taxes on the gains
I dont get it

You can also go for anything else that is highly leveraged and either hit your goal intra-day; or accept a quick and painless death.
Great point. 

I feel like Ford has to either adapt or disappear at this point. With a generous $7500 tax credit, this car is affordable. Interior looks nice as well.

Ohh ffs he lost his battle. RIP homie jeopardy won‚Äôt be the same without you

No, if your scenario happens you will have to buy 100 shares of NIO for $56 for each contract you sell. Assuming they're ITM after premium
He still here in spirit.  RIP.  Tv night won't be the same ever.
That sucks - I grew up watching him. Your post was the first I heard the news

I have a 40c 11/20 for them right now and unfortunately I bought it when it was at 38/share, so it went down almost $300 in value per call on Friday.. I'm really hoping that they shoot back up into the sky this week.

That's not an argument. Try again.
Honestly nothing lol. The point of my post wasn‚Äôt necessarily to prove I‚Äôm right, it was more so to see and to prove to myself how cowardly most people have become. I said a pretty outrageous thing and it retrieved your comment, however the rest of the hate was retrieved through downvotes... lmao how are downvotes going to change someone‚Äôs mind? 

The newer generations honestly are more useless then the older generations. Spineless, thoughtless, emotionless screen tappers who want change, but don‚Äôt step up when the change needs to be done.

I picked up some flyers on Yolo last week and might expand that out some, but my buying power is going to take a shit because I am paying off my credit cards.  Between SNE, MSFT and Weed stocks last week I made enough to pay off the rest of my credit card debt and refi my house from a 30 year down to a 15 year.
BABA, TSLA, JKS at open. All in. Anybody give me a good reason not to? Or is anybody else in too?
Same buddy, sold my Nio 40c for a 250% gain before it become a hot stock, while I would be up about 2000%+ by now (the calls still had 2+ weeks until expire at that point)

Thinking back, I have no clue why I sold them, since I usually let all my options expire worthless. I just had a retard moment, because I was annoyed at my project group and had to work on something for the whole day.

Edit: you would say, you still made profit! Nahh, I used the profit to buy 1 day out calls that expired worthless

...like anyone else you would hire for any position? Or any company if you're a CEO or exec? What are you even saying? That's why you form a team you trust. Your argument could be for every administration, not just for biden, so for you it would make no difference who was in office.

I would like to chime in on the gun stocks.  There are only two, S&W and Ruger, the rest are essentially family businesses.  Gun demand is at an all time high, prices are extremely inflated and guns are continually flying off the shelves, (I like guns). This is largely due to the COVID panic, and in the long term a Biden presidency will cause more panic gun buying.  The gun community is terrified of a Biden presidency (Im not, itll be fine) but the kookie 2a voters are flipping out.  They will buy and buy these next four years. Democrat leadership prove time and time again that gun sales go up during their presidencies.

The stock market doesn't really gain value like we think it does... look at the market from 1970 onward and it looks like a 45% angle.. denominate the same stock market in gold and see that it's been decreasing overall since. The dollar's just constantly being devalued.

Right out of the St. Louis Fed website:

https://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2017/november/does-federal-reserve-print-money

"The Fed pays for those securities by crediting funds to the reserves that banks are required to hold, either cash in their vaults or deposits at a Reserve bank."

This frees up the bank's own capital as they don't need to contribute as much of their own capital to maintain reserve requirements.  But if they aren't lending, no money is getting creating and right now, they aren't lending because the economy sucks and rates are too low (interesting phenomenon there).

November should be a super bullish month, so make sure you do the right trades. Literally can‚Äôt go tits up and if you play it right, you will be able to provide for your offsprings and your wife‚Äôs boyfriends kids
Bernie said this as well, but then when you read his plan he was actually wanting to tax everyone. People making 50k or less would have possibly had a chance to get their money back in a tax refund. 

I‚Äôd potentially support something like this if Biden substantially changes the thresholds and tax collection methods.

You elect it I think by March for the following year (June this year due to covid), you have to be making money, and making a ton of trades nearly daily. If you do, can deduct all trading related expenses from gains, and all gains become income like a job. Then can carryforward any losses as income and run against jobs in the future or other w2 income now. IRS hates it but if you qualify you qualify. Only applies to substantial traders. Making 5k on 3 yolo trades won‚Äôt cut it. Making a few trades nearly every day on average and making consistent money will

Try 27 trillion and counting.  To put things into perspective.  If I gave you one trillion and told you to spend one dollar a second , it would take 40,000 yeas to spend one trillion.

People often complain about housing prices but don't make the correlation that the dollar has been and will continue to be devalued since it's introduction.

The (private) federal reserve back was "established" to stabilize the currency/economy.  It has failed at both. The US currency had lost over 97% of its purchasing power since the 1920s.

This is just my thoughts... Monday will be blood red. Everyone always says ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù. We all know the election isn‚Äôt done at all because no official results have been finalized and there are court proceedings happening tomorrow.

Now a lot of people will gear up for a Biden win. They‚Äôll sell all they can by the end of the year to get the trump tax cut and move their money somewhere else, like other investments. Some hedge fund managers already know what they‚Äôll most likely do to save their money from Biden.

With that said, I believe ending tax cuts will kill the economy. Everyone will get fucked by the tax hikes. This huge rush this week to me wasn‚Äôt normal and once it‚Äôs slides and if Biden truly wins and raises taxes, stock market races so far downhill we‚Äôll think we‚Äôve been time warped back to the Great Depression.

Just my thoughts and realize people will think I‚Äôm stupid.
Smart
And the ability to clawback if you make gains one year and losses the next year, sole exception to my example! Section 1256 is very helpful.

Nice, just for anyone who may not know:

section 1256 also gives certain derivatives, like options on indices (SPX, NDX, RUT, etc.), preferred tax status over instruments like options on SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc.

edit to add: this is why high net worth individuals and/or informed traders like u/Power80770M like to take SPX positions, for example.

I agree that nobody is given or should be given anything on a silver platter, however I also believe the previous generations should be responsible for setting up the foundations in the best way possible for future generations. They call boomers the ‚Äúme‚Äù generation because they‚Äôre greedy as fuck. Excessive greed to me, is pointless in a society, and cutting out the parts of society that are weighing it down from advancing, doesn‚Äôt seem like it should be offensive as it is being made to be...

Sorry, you seem to have confused me with someone who gives a shit.  I was just making a funny.
No
We have no results from Georgia. That is 2 senators.
So there are currently 98 senators(for the purpose of this discussion)

There are 46 D and 2 independent.  
   
Alaska and NC were still counting, but they will almost certainly be R, which is why I included them in the count of 98
It could dip after ER if there is a correction. Or if the bulls keep pumping it up as the next big Tesla it might keep reaching new highs.

 Last ER the stock ran up in pre-market, but dropped heavily right after.

I didn't mean anything personal.  I was referring to my first trip to Utah in the early 90's.  We left from Vegas and found ourselves at KFC (tendies?) in St Gorge. Flirting with the counter babe we told her we were just here looking for trouble.  She perked right up and said "If you're looking for trouble here you'll find it.  We have a very heavy FBI presence here."  "You're kidding?  In Utah? The Mormon dudes?"  She said "We have a bad ice (meth) problem.  It was the first time we ever heard of meth.

Oil is already trashed.  Shorting it here is ill advised.  Probably going to have a rough couple of months as winter is a seasonal low and air travel recovery will be delayed due to second covid outbreak (and Europe still clinging to the idea that lockdowns work).  That said, it will spike on vaccine news, Asia is already ramping up demand, and the near term politics is mostly bark with little bite - especially if R's maintain the Senate.

I'm long calls and shares in a small permian producer that is about 2/3 off it's last summer highs but about 5x it's March lows.  I believe it's considered a penny stock (700M Market Cap) so won't mention the name and thus have comment sent to auto-mod hell.
..or have Tax Trader Status and elect MTM accounting (at least a year in advance) to not worry about massive gains or losses in any year and be able to deduct huge losses against income, not the measly $3000 deduction.
If you think taxes would be raised on only those making above that amount, you need to go back and take Econ class. A nation can‚Äôt suffice if you only raise taxes on those in that bracket lol. More people make an average of $50-55k a year so they would be affected. I guess you‚Äôll see once he takes office.

Very Bullish, weed stocks ftw
I think this is where gdp and economic growth comes into play. As long as the economy is growing and there‚Äôs still more money in people‚Äôs pockets to be put into the market the growth stocks don‚Äôt necessarily have to crash. As they grow and investors start to value them like value stocks it could just mean slower growth as they approach their ‚Äútrue‚Äù value (lower P/E ratios). If enough new money wasn‚Äôt coming into the market at the same time though, then they‚Äôd probably crash a little before coming back to their  ‚Äútrue‚Äù values

Yeah. His term wont end until 2028 and he‚Äôs being praised by politicians from the both sides of the aisle. 

Also look at Biden‚Äôs track record. He makes deals by reaching over the aisle and he voted on legislations that favored Wall Street. He wont think about removing Powell unless JPOW fucks up or economy dives.
Nah. He actually won. No doubt anymore. Before it was optimism

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/PRPL/key-statistics?p=PRPL&.tsrc=fin-srch

Float 	27.89M

Shares Short (Oct. 14, 2020) 	5.53M

Short % of Float (Oct. 14, 2020) 	12.40%

So how exactly does this math works out?

5.53/27.89 = 19.9% not 12.4%?

Floating shares are the shares available to trade on the public market, am i right?

You‚Äôre going to mortgage your house over 4grand? If you can‚Äôt pull 4K in margin loans at 4% then how do you own a house? A high schooler can pull 4K margins at 4%... youre also paying someone $80 per contract for the stock to go up 100% before you profit after 3 years. You might as well buy the stock straight up and make 33% of expected gains while not having to worry about time decay and price volatility when nobody wants to buy the option and it‚Äôs not worth exercising. That outlook of spending shit money on shit options needs to stop.

All of those companies went public the legit way afaik.

Companies can raise money through investors or business loans. If they hire talented people and have a good business model people love to invest.

Its how it worked with apple, microsoft and paypal.

Spacs skip all that for a fast track to lots of money with little to no oversight into why they deserve it.

Apple had a good leader, a good idea, and a good product. They proved their worth and were rewarded. Same as microsoft and paypal.

Spce is a fucking joke. Nkla. All of them. Will they succeed? Maybe. But their chances are really fucking slim.

You have to recognize your bias. The price action is completely bullish right now and if you're feeling bearish, that means you have a bias that will cost you money if you don't recognize it. It's obviously too late to buy in, because we will have a pull back, but you should be looking for buying opportunities off support. 

That said, we are trading at insane valuations up near resistance that has held since 08. The economy is in shambles. The sitting president has not conceded the election.  So set a stop loss and be on the lookout for trend reversals. Perma bulls and perma bears lose money. Just follow the price action but understand real risk is high right now.

To keep profits you do need to learn how to trade. The first one is always free. Rather it‚Äôs a winning trade or a whole bag. But if you don‚Äôt know how you earned how can you keep it?
If you tell hospitals that if its a Covid patient all costs are covered and if its not you need to run after indigent folks to try and collect pretty much everything will get coded as Covid. Most dead from Covid people came to hospital for something else and caught Covid in the hospital.  Covid is very infectious. its not that deadly unless you already are sick with something else.
They don't need to run a candidate yet, they just need to start smearing Dems and setting up their 2024 playbook. Although Incumbency advantage is like 75%+, that should be a winnable election for Republicans without mail in voting and the other things that allowed them to win this time.
Ditto .

The sunflower plant offers additional benefits besides beauty. Sunflower oil is suggested to possess anti-inflammatory properties. It contains linoleic acid which can convert to arachidonic acid. Both are fatty acids and can help reduce water loss and repair the skin barrier.

What your username means?
Thei tuk ur jabs
If you plant sunflower seeds, you get more sunflowers and can eat more seeds.  


If you eat the sunflower seeds, you then have to borrow sunflower seeds from someone else to make more sunflowers. If you eat the borrowed seeds, you have no sunflower seeds to give back to who you borrowed from.

Trading small makes it so you‚Äôre not a paper hands bitch and can stomach a loss no problem. Trading often makes it so you are more diversified AND you just get better from doing it so often.

That is not my experience at 27 in the Metro Detroit area. Looking at 80k to 120k homes (16-24k down at 20%) but with my VA loan that down is 0%. So $0 to $24k down. Looking at 3 beds with 1-2 bath, basement, garage, mostly well maintained and clean.

My recommendation (only because it has worked for me for many years) is to buy a diversified portfolio which includes SPY.   You built what you consider your core positions (x shares in XYZ stock).  When the stocks drop, you buy more and then when the stocks rally you begin to sell back to your core position.  If you are close to a dividend payment, hold the elevated position and collect the dividend.

I would also recommend you consider buying subsets of the SPY to be more fine-grained in your investments.   For example you can bet on tech with XLY and avoid other investments in Energy like XLE.

Happy to share more if you are interested.
Once you scale into these index funds, you can begin to make investments in individual stocks.
How we looking??

Honestly? A cash / revenue crunch that leaves a significant portion of companies unable to service their debt.  When creditors come knocking, equity markets will scramble to jump ship. 

Now, what can/will cause the cash crunch? It's not easy to tell.. another shut down without sufficient gov't stimulus? Rising interest rates that don't track with increases in profits/revenue? A financial crisis that shuts down credit/cash markets (think consumers defaulting at record #'s for mortgages, SL, Autos, etc)? Pick any one of a dozen or more different scenarios (changes to the tax code, gov't shut down, global conflicts, blah blah)

For now, the strategy is to kick the can (systematic economic issues) down the road and hope our future selves are more responsible and intelligent enough to hopefully unwind this ever growing credit/equity bubble that we're watching develop.

Giving people handouts of $200 per-person per month,
 is definitely not the same as giving major Corporations essentially Millions of dollars in a low interest rate loans that those Corps. stand to make a huge profit from. 

Just because these companies are going to "pay back" their debt via Bond, doesnt mean it's not a HUGE handout to certain businesses who were on the way out, And would have never qualified for the money they received back in April. 
(Essenstially anyone with a business and a few minimum qualifications, could apply for a really good loan-and many people did..fradualently.)

 (Literally the same thing that happened in 2008, except this time the potential* economic collapse is from a global pandemic-not shady lending practices. Goldman Sachs made millions of of the "loan" from the U.S. govt. Bond buyback in 2008; 
Sure they paid it back, but it made the company so much richer

AND The White House hired Golden Sachs former CEO to help design and advice on that Bailout. )


"In an anti-climax, the Federal Reserve actually started to buy corporate exchange traded funds on 12 May 2020, seven weeks after the announcement. In mid-June, it switched from buying exchanged trade funds to buying individual bonds, using a ‚Äòhome-rolled‚Äô index. The start of actual buying had little effect on pricing (Tables 1 and 2).15
Purchases declined unevenly from $300 million per day to zero in July (Figure 4).16¬†By then, the market was in fine fettle. First-half 2020 issuance of corporate bonds had easily broken all records.17¬†Firms had gone from ‚Äòpaying up‚Äô for precautionary funding to taking cheap funds opportunistically."-

I wonder what the biggest percentage gain someone has made on options in a week
Dude, there are sooo many better reasons to trash Trump that actually have some basis in fact than to suggest he is solely responsible for the deaths from COVID. Is he irresponsible, sure, did he completely fumble federal response to the pandemic, sure; but he isn‚Äôt responsible for the transmission of a PANDEMIC across a population of hundreds of millions. Individuals may have felt validated by his downplaying the severity, but these same people wouldn‚Äôt have been convinced regardless of what he did or said... there are fucking dimwits in this country who believe in flat earth and anti-vaxx, and they‚Äôre dems and republicans alike.

You‚Äôre the fifth person to try and tell me that Trump is responsible for COVID, did CNN make it a sound byte or something? Why would you believe such retarded nonsense? Does your hate really transcend all reason? That‚Äôd be irrational...
And it‚Äôs 10 times better than 42!

Idk that short oil is smart. It's already low asf. Also a ton of rigs and shale shut down due to compressed prices.  If the economy comes back we are gonna see the highest ever gas prices which means tendies come from oil stocks.  ( production changes lag demand. So we over produced when demand tanked. )
So either the shorts doubled down (again) or the started to close positions, which either way is..... bullish?

What if this is the top though? Realistically how much higher can they go? You need to earn a minimum of 6 figures and have $100K+ saved up just to even enter the market for a shoebox condo

This is gold
Quantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.

Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against. Which means if the banks aren't lending, QE funds are not entering the economy. And the banks are not lending, because they would have to risk their own capital to do so.

In fact, it's much worse than that. Because the Fed is removing liquid assets from the open market (in this case bonds), and not paying liquid cash for them. Despite all the Fed's talk about "creating liquidity," what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system.

Why would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself.

See, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.

Only when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in "forward guidance." The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.

TSLA for green energy (given) but I am also in stocks that will benefit from pro longed vaccine distribution time and infection rate driven by stimulus. 

So Z,TGT, SQ, PTON, CMG and Apple...  set aside the election jitters that pushed stocks down. That was just noise. The numbers 

For the stocks mentioned above would have been  great without leadership change....

Why does leadership change matter- well every administration when they get in power passes some crazy businesses friendly laws. 

first time home buyer credit of 15K. - that has Zillow written all over it. Why- well first time home buyers tend to be younger generation that uses technology. Plus with pandemic most would rather use technology than go out. 

PTON - soul cycle/spin class big box gyms are in trouble. PTON has been crushing it. They sell you the cycle (which I have and love) and 39.00 per month for service. They have great coaches film class and broadcast from a cloud to millions of users over the customers WiFi or data.  CEO expects to get 100 mil customers. Which will be fantastic but let‚Äôs keep to what we have. 3 mil subscribers 113% y/y customer growth with 90% plus retention rate. 

Apple. 5G son. qcom gave some crazy good guidance. Apple did not - but said the demand is high and does not want to forecast to pandemic or election. Also apple service rev has been growing. That is almost all profit margin

If you don't, oh well... You didn't lose anything but had some fun. Treat it like playing a game and not means to advance financially.

oil might crash initially but biden is long term bullish for price of oil. he will look to curb american production which will push the price of crude higher. some of the smaller players will go bankrupt leading to more consolidation, less competition, and less production. since biden election also means end of covid, i say oil will be over $60 by end of 2021.

If anyone is in debt to their eyeballs on this thread, just don't pay, they can't charge you with a crime or garnish your wages for unpaid credit card bills, or mortgage (oddly student loans don't apply here..yet). They will likely settle with you for pennies on the dollar on the credit card(s) and let you live in your home rent free for a couple years before eviction. Your credit WILL recover, might take 7 years but it will be back to +700 and you can repeat the cycle. MERICA!
Pfizer should announce their vaccine study results within the next couple weeks.
whats yours?
Regardless of if you like Trump or not.  It would be epic if they find enough evidence to overturn key states.  I am not speaking as a Trump supporter.  I just think it would be epic to see the faces of people who were so convinced this was a done deal and seeing the media deal with it.

Pay your mortgage monthly to the dollar. Put your "extra" aside. When the "extra" matches your remaining mortgage, you pay it off. Paying extra just takes money out of your pocket and puts it in the lender's with no personal benefit. Keep that money to the side and it's earmarked, but there for *you* if *you* need it.

Also if your house is more paid off than expected, you're a more favourable target for foreclosure

Hey- smaller scale here but yeah I have $19, 19.5 and 2- 20.5 calls on RKT... I had 20 shares last Earnings report and pulled everything right before close, which made me very happy.  The earnings drop off makes me nervous so I was planning on selling 1 or 2 of my calls before close, and riding with the others.  
Suggestions on which ones to hold and which to sell?

3 huge gaps to the upside last week, which 1 was filled on Friday. Biden is elected but it's not over yet. They say red senate but that's not 100√∑. Gov gonna spend their efforts on recount so the money printer halts temporarily lol.

I think conservatively 4-6% correction. Worst case it'll just got back to where we were Monday and then the roller coaster for another few more weeks.
Well pretty flat after 3 straight 3% days
i wanna say we are green tomorrow but we had a +8% run last week? red is too obvious, green is too ridiculous

It depends, when you realize how many people never pay off their student loan it is not really that expensive for the government to forgive government based student loans. It is probably 1 trillion sitting on the books as loans receivable plus interest of which they will only receive 50% over 30 years? Instead give that each student loan recipient an extra $100 to $1000 per month to pump into the economy.

I understand people who have already paid student loan debt being upset or people who never went to college. However, in terms of pure economics, it's basically a huge stimulus each month. Great for the economy.
That dip was normal
It was incredibly close. A landslide would‚Äôve been Trump losing Texas, Florida, South Carolina, etc. that would‚Äôve shown he was utterly rejected.
That's only because of the mail in counting delay republicans put in place so that it couldnt be called on election day.

Anyone remember when we bought Disney in anticipation of Disney +? That was a year ago fuk
Honestly, I don‚Äôt really understand it myself. For one thing, Japan specialized in electronics hardware components which quickly became commoditized as it was software where the real growth opportunities where. I‚Äôm sure there are some good articles out there about it. I just happen to be long Sony, so I sort of tangentially follow the Nikki as Sony is listed in both countries.

Just spitballing, I think that perhaps Japan‚Äôs outsized focus on stability/risk averse culture may have had something to do with it too. However, that is starting to change a bit, at least in the business world, and anyways I think traders are valuing stability more highly now.

It's a tough game, we should never forget that. I would doubt someone in the mean can be green within his first year; we know blowing the account as initiation is a common story.

Can do swing plays, can do value plays, don't get caught in momentum, when naysayers have arguments against disruptive companies have solid answers to them (bit of a contrarian) and balance everything (not too deep into oil, nor tech, nor shares, nor puts). View trades as probability cards, if you buy a call for next month that's i.e. a 35% POP, if you do shares and wait 15 months that's a 75% POP.

I rode NIO and XPEV last week which was fun but nervous on playing weeklies with the way the market has been fluctuating.

I will say I think it‚Äôd be dumb to NOT buy a NIO 50c for 11/20 and hold till after earnings on 11/17.  It‚Äôs like $109 per contract right now and if it moons I‚Äôd like to at least have one so I could tell my bisexual grandchildren about it.

I mean....are you surprised? The ‚Äúmoney printer goes brrr‚Äù meme was funny until it became true. The majority of our GDP is based on credit, hence why, we can have a $20t deficit, the majority of which is based off money that doesn‚Äôt even physically exist. As long as can keep making our minimum payments, we can‚Äôt go bankrupt. 

Our entire stock market is based on hypotheticals, which is why a company‚Äôs value, like Tesla, can quadruple during a pandemic even though it isn‚Äôt justified.

Spring next year, we have so many positive catalysts coming.  For instance probable vaccine but if not then there will be a decline in cases due to proper leadership FINALLY.  Also AAPL will be including the iPhone 12 sales numbers in their Dec earnings reports.  Skinny stimulus is coming according to McConnell and I think Pilosi will be more willing to negotiate now w/o Mango demanding his dumb name be on checks.  Also, one thing the Dems love is infrastructure spending via more stimulus and that won‚Äôt be blocked by GOP senate because it makes them look good as well.

If this is authentic you should not breed
I'm just about 37 and have about $180K in cash, a home with $250K in equity (another $250K in mortgage) and 2 cars fully owned. HOWEVER, if it wasn't for sheer luck (I can't stress just how much luck played a role in my current situation), I would have around $100K in cash total (max) with no home and maybe 1 (ghetto) car. I think having around $80K isn't HORRIBLE. It's probably under average but it's not absolutely terrible.

However, if he's single, then I \*kind\* of agree...but **even then** you can't judge. You don't know someone's individual situation until you're in their shoes.

SPY 1000 2030 calls
Honestly, most of it was panic. First off all, I don‚Äòt think I am ‚Äûgambling‚Äú per se. I always do pretty much research before going in with huge amounts and it works like 95% of the time. So i thought with the whole volatiliy, let‚Äòs go in with a nice short mini-future on the DAX that was pretty safe, with all the bad Covid news in germany etc. So on monday, the DAX shot up like 2,5%, no big deal for me, I would just throw in some more money to average down. Tuesday the same. On tuesday evening I started to begin to panic. So I think like let me deposit the rest of my money on my bank account to my broker and make this a huge win. Threw in most of my money on wednesday. And like if you look at the chart, not even one small dip for me to get out at this point, this shit just went upwards like there was no tomorrow. I then had to cash out on thursday before it hit my knockout. It dipped a little bit on friday, just my luck.

I‚Äòm quite numb right now actually. I‚Äòm just disappointed in myself, because I was up huge once, cashed out all my own money and was about to play with the gains I had this far. And now I‚Äòm here with around 5k to my name, and it was around 100k just 1 month ago. I need to get that money back, otherwise I‚Äòm fucking done with life.

But biden is talking about rejoining the paris climate accord first day, launching millions of jobs under a clean energy initiative, rebates for EV'S etc.

Thats gotta still pump renewable energy stocks

And when you say look at the rest of the world, alot of EU is also switching to clean energy. I agree the world cant just switch to renewable energy tomorrow, but a slow but steady switch seems to be the movement everywhere.

every week you should buy TSLA calls until you're either bankrupt or rich.
True story, you got it!
Even if you entertain NIO being LK for a minute, how do you want to time the random fall from grace one day? Even if you tried to short LK, you would have needed to get the timing right on the random news drop halting this. Nearly impossible to time this without eating shit for a while.
Of course it's absurd.   How many times have you seen them upgrade at the top?  Downgrade at the bottom?

This is how they manipulate the markets but the bottom line is it usually  works, at least in the very short term.

From what I understand most of the locations are in dying malls so the rental value isn't a strong return of capital and the need for an intermediary to trade games has dropped.

Look at the rest of the world, you think their ready for renewable energy!? Also the U.S. barely even has the infrastructure (if the U.S. can‚Äôt think about the rest of the world) to support a large amount of renewables. Although renewables are ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù to oil in price, the logistics are severely lacking. Oil is a no brainer
I was wondering what that was! guess that clears it up, we have our bottom and have set the stage for lift off. I can calmly say that we'll hit 400 by end of week.

It feels like Biden is going to be a lot less worse for America but we shall see
That's exactly my theory. I entered before the election on the idea that Biden will want as many EVs in the US as possible. The Chinese are already manufacturing while most of the US companies are just leaving SPACs. I could 100% see NIO in the US in the next 5 years

Don't let em stick with me most of the time. For something I haven't let go of in the last what I believe was more like 3 or 4 months. I bought some PLUG while it was under $5 earlier this year. 

Let em get taken away on covered calls once it was up over 100%. Which ok on the profits part I suppose, but I pretty much bought the shit for a green energy election run up.
why would you be bearish on them?

Nothing is finalized so I wouldnt make any drastic changes.  Honestly, even if Biden still wins after recounts, the market is gonna continue to do what it's always done.  Tech is still gonna outperform. Of course, I'm just a gay bear.
weekly prediction, trading volume have gone back to normal, on friday it made several attempt to break out at 1760, which it did on three separate occasion but was rejected at 1770, downside momentum is fading therefore you can expect GOOGL to make a few more breakout next week to 1790.

Considering they did 19% in the last 3 months it's not the dumbest $5 bet out there. I bet you could sell for a profit when they are still OTM a few months down the line

I used to think market was this mysterious entity that could somehow predict things nobody sees. Now I realize it‚Äôs actually retarded and just does random shit.

Like market has been going up relentlessly even with political uncertainty and a global pandemic. Must be that the pandemic is no big deal or a vaccine is around the corner and mr market is sniffing that out, right? Wrong. Market went up vertically in February even when it was clear the virus was shutting down China.

So now what? Market is again surging and we now have a pandemic which, after largely moving to the back of most people‚Äôs minds at least with regard to their own health risk, looks to be spiraling out of control. So is it possible market has been erroneously ignoring such an obvious potential negative catalyst? It most definitely is. Vaccine? Complete delusion. Career experts have said for months that‚Äôs simply not happening for several months at scale. The idea that the market correctly discounts future developments is one of the great misconceptions about markets. It‚Äôs demonstrably false.

Any predictions on GOOGL?
Two for me - not taking max profit on AMZN calls back in July.  Then chasing after it after it with calls after it kept dropping.  Was hoping for an earnings run up that never happened.  And the other was after making good profit on aapl and tsla right after the split i knew everything was gonna sell off.  Gut feeling but i still loaded up on calls like a dumbass and lost it all.

Sorry man. End of day it is only money. You can earn and save it back. 80k now feels like the world but in 10 years it will mean nothing. Concentrate on making more money thru your career/work. Sock as much as you can away into buy and hold. Use a little to have fun and do options etc. 

One final thought. Don't try and chase that 80k back. You will be in a bigger hole. That money is gone. If you do decide to come back, stop yolo or doing weekly. Take it seriously and trade shares or wheel etc. 

Good luck

It's not a yolo. Yolo means if you lose you got nothing.
Breakouts happen when fundamentals and/or psychology of participants outweigh technicals. With companies like apple having more cash than some banks and countries, the lure of stock splits, dividends and growth is making mega caps the new safe haven of asset classes

If there‚Äôs money to be made, I‚Äôm there, fake or not. 

You‚Äôre in the stock market bro that shit‚Äôs more fake than anything
I think we go down. Biden winning was obvious days ago and priced in, Trump voters who were delusional about him winning didnt pull their money until this weekend.

After the drop though, we should rise to new highs . Only thing I can see taking us out is some mutant covid strain or failed vaccines
Buy NIO calls and crawl out of the hole
Why everyone talking about vaccine news? It‚Äôs been a long time since any good news about that came out
Holy crap...what a comeback...go Jo
I hope rkt opens at 25
Is it just me or does he even look like an Asian Elon Musk?
Even if companies release unaudited results, American companies still follow GAAP, NIO does not.
A lot of it depends on the price action, but if the stock was flat or something for awhile ( like sq and roku for all of 2019) you would want to sell the option with at least 3 months left and roll to one with a further expiry. If the stock happens to sky rocket after I buy I take profits when the money gets too good and re buy a call at a further out strike for cheaper.

Well the house and senate passed and he confirmed but your memory must be short because the ACA is a disaster and still is. Thankfully Trump kneecapped it on the first day by getting rid of the mandate ‚Äútax‚Äù. Hopefully sleepy joe doesn‚Äôt undo that.

Who the hell is sleeping this late into the morning? Not many who trade
Agree. With the state of the news these days who knows what to believe.
could be wrong, but I think it's fairly uncommon for any company to release fully audited earnings statements.  The annual 20-F Nio releases is audited by PWC.
Yeah I know parlays. Moneyline favorite parlays are a tax on the stupid
That is the plan
I'm surprised nobody talks about IIPR when talking about weed. This is literally the best weed stock on the market.

So did Luckin. Drank that shit everyday in China.
It can be actively traded for consistent profits but not with any bias. When SPX was in contango almost all of 2019, You could take a large short position in products like TVIX and scalp long pops consistently for gains. But trying to swing vol products for a correction is fools gold if you can‚Äôt time the market as contango causes decay in vol notes

Guys I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I fully expected Stonks to go up upon election clarity, but what I didn‚Äôt expect was Stonks to rally close to all time highs again during election week when nobody knew who tf was gonna win. But we‚Äôre at the top of the range we‚Äôve been in and unless we see a convincing break to the upside, I think we go down at least during the beginning of next week. Being at the top of the range coupled with the fact orange guy is gonna start litigating next week, idk. I‚Äôm hesitant to go really long rn
Yeah when it does break like 460-470 it will squeeze to 500 again im sure

The catalyst was that everyone was expecting the market to go down.  It was too obvious of a move and that's why the institutions inversed it.

Ngl, public accounting made me want to blow my brains out. As a Tax intern during busy season I worked 60 hour weeks. The work was actually pretty easy, but just really really boring. 

Big 4 is known as more cut throat than the next rung down but let me tell you even at RSM I actually got reprimanded for saying goodbye to the associates in my row at the end of the day. Apparently an intern saying goodbye to them at 6:30 was just too much to handle that a couple of the junior associates needed to complain to the partner together. About saying goodbye.

I dont see oil stocks ever hitting where it was before, but they are so beaten down its unreal. They'll eventually swing back up in a pretty big way. Im pretty sure it'll be in 2021. It could fall more though because of election perception and covid picking up. Anymore lockdowns and it will get uglier. Personally I would wait a little longer to add

I figured Biden would win, but going on those betting sites would just pay out 9:10 odds... why bother.

So I bought some solar (NOVA) and gun/ammo (VSTO) calls. Paid out a hell of a lot better than 10%.
You fill me with joy. Buying more on Monday. Sadly I‚Äôm only 30% in NIO but pls to dump a few other stocks to get in. God speed to us. I‚Äôm way more into shares as it‚Äôs the long term potential of the company that I trust but I‚Äôm about to hop in more shares and a $42 call 11/20 on monday

Stonks will go up and then it will go down, and then it will go up and then eventually it will go down. After that it will go up again and then down some. Ultimately it will go up and then down and then up some more. Moral of the story: stonks go up
Sounds like a baller.
I just think it's amazing luck that there was another business called four seasons something and that it was a "blue collar" type business.  
Here are some other four seasons businesses I found:  
- Four seasons Day spa (massage parlor, new stanton, definitely a brothel)  
- Four seasons Massage spa (massage parlor, allentown, wank shack)  
- like three more massage parlors...  
- Motel, harrisburg  
- banquet house, pittsburgh

I visited Tel aviv in 2018, the us embassy was next to my hostel, it's right on the beach! I asked the security if it had actually moved and he said that it was "in progress" with a smirk. He agreed that everyone was pissed off because obviously all the diplomats would rather be in Tel Aviv on the beach than Jerusalem, which is frankly a tourist town full of whackos of all religions.

This conversation actually happened, I was surprised that he was willing to talk to me tbh
I don‚Äôt see it. I think Monday will be a big green. Also, we‚Äôre going into holiday spending season. Even if Monday isn‚Äôt the erection we expect, I think there will be more than enough consumer spending and optimism to take us to January.

Golden either way
As mentioned above - I'm only recently day trading due to the uncertainty.

Right up until last month, I was a 6 month buy and sell halfway through sort of guy.

Same companies, same strategy; only I held my 6 month calls for like 3 months and sold at very high % gains.

The political climate and covid scared me into just pulling early.. I was comfortable riding 3 months of normal price rises and falls; but the last few months falls have been massive.

I'm not comfortable with my 6 month calls falling off a cliff because of old dudes on twitter; or because france shut down due to covid - totally stupid, unforeseeable and uncontrollable market flash crashers...

So I would say that my "pull at 10%" strategy is here to stay.
I've always made great money,, but it took me 3 months and my money had to ride not only the gains, but also the falls.

My new plan is "tweaked" a little and it involves me being at my computer much more often..

But I've never made this much money week after week.

This is a good plan; I'm sticking with it.
This is the way
Imagine losing 99.75% with shares only lmao.

I'm very confused right now.  Can you please explain why you thought the market was going to retract?
I didn't end up researching the catalyst to why the stock market went up last week. I assumed here that it was because investors were anticipating the Democrats to ease restrictions now that DT lost and there's no reason to keep the closure and blame it on DT. 
I made it as a joke but it seems, considering the celebrations going around the U.S, that it could be exactly what's going to happen.
Imagine losing 3 supreme court picks to an orange man and then threatening to "pack the court" and realizing you can't even do that because your party failed miserably to get anything close to what the polls implied.

Why would more young voters come out for the senate election versus presidential election?? I agree the senate stakes are important, but for the average millennial, voting for the president (specifically getting rid of trump) is much more important to them. I'm expecting the number of young voters to decrease.

The stock market only contains companies with monkeys running them. It's not like when the top monkey changes, the rest of them transform into Super Saiyan Gods of productivity.

It's also unlikely the stock market can grow much further, because the economy really isn't growing meaningful new services and products. A dishwasher was a meaningful invention, as was the elevator (but that's 100 years old). The computer was meaningful, but for the last 15 years those improvements have not been *that* important (sorry guys, nobody gives a shit about your "gaming rig").

Later that day I noticed I was starting to feel trippy and out of it and I was catching my breath after going up the stairs. Then the headaches and body aches started and i went and got dat test
Yeah I just think the price action has been suspect- going to $140 in a straight line then having a reversal down to $109 then going back up towards $130 into earnings, initially selling off to $117 then looking like it was going to reverse back up towards $140 only to reverse and close red. Wouldn‚Äôt be that surprised to see it fall back towards $100 over the next couple of weeks. With all these failed breakouts just looks like there are more sellers than buyers and now that earnings are over that could increase.

I do think COVID is going to drive more of the narrative for the overall market soon so that could help pton.

the big mistake on China, which is what the geopol and macro guys have been saying for the last four years, is that China is NOT the soviet union. Just playing the same old strategy of trying to isolate them and help their economy collapse is not going to work.  

The world is much too small, and the only way to operate is a multilateral world where the voices of middle powers can help temper the worst instincts of larger powers. An example of this was pulling out of the TPP - In the end, all the players stayed signed on but now China was the biggest player, so it ended up just being led by China and that includes Australia. That was a huge strategic mistake.
Was funny this morning watching I was like ‚Ä¶ its great they are pretty much all wearing masks and properly at that but ‚Ä¶ social distancing please.

There's definitely a lot to criticize about Trump, but at least he wasn't starting wars in the Middle East or anywhere else like every US president for more than 50 years.

I assume with Biden the US will be back to Obama style interference. So a bunch of proxy wars and drone strikes in the Middle East. Who knows maybe he'll fund some rebel groups and destroy another country like they did with Syria.
Saw only the first episode... thought it‚Äôs sucked, definitely way too slow for me
I disagree, most presidents are not radicals and often do not undo each others policies. 

Biden isn't going to spend money knocking down a wall that's already been built, or spend money moving the US embassy out of Jerusalem back to Tel Aviv etc. 

Remember a lot of what the president can do needs to be approved by congress and good luck getting some of those policies through the senate.

I suspect the 2 main issues Biden will reverse will be the climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. As long as the next republican isn't a Trump 2.0 the US should return back to a normal path of slow and steady progression rather than back and fourth overriding their predecessors policies.

Stop asking for stock tips on Wall Street bets. Pick a few companies you know are going to be around your whole life. Like Apple. Like Google. You don't put your whole net worth in a one-week trade. You don't actually yolo your entire net worth. No matter what f****** say here. You save a little bit every paycheck in your IRA. And you buy actual f****** shares of companies you know that will be around your whole life. Not Chinese dog s*** companies like nio and Luca coffee


. You shouldn't even f****** buy individual stocks you should buy a wide dispersed ETF like spy. But the market is pretty fully priced right now You've got to start investing for the rest of your f****** life.

And don't ever f****** tell me to go back to investing or okay boomer. Cuz I'm tired of seeing good little kids f****** lose every dime they have. and don't tell me I can curse in here I'm too f****** tired to undo Google voice when I'm walking my f****** dog.

It‚Äôs funny thinking back to those times because the media wasn‚Äôt hugely less biased than it is today, IMO. There was still tons of pettiness, cheap shots, and flexible-facts. It definitely got worse over time, but the president and a lot of public (on both sides) just went off on extremes.

It's so crazy when you look at past videos and photos how Obama and Bush treated each other. You'd never guess they belong to different parties. 

The level of respect and professionalism is exactly how it should be between presidents, even if you fundamentally disapprove of their policies.


I sincerely hope the United States never gets a president with a character like Trumps again. Policies and beliefs aside, his character was vulgar and egotistical and he was a pathological liar.

This was the same logic as the guy shorting SPCE, you don't short/put against companies no one has expectations of.  Its the same risk as buying calls on companies everyone expects to do amazing in earnings (all tech in q3 for instance).  Risk to reward is too shit - you play this the month prior to earnings imo, never on earnings.

The problem I think you're seeing is that analysts have a really hard time with meme stocks because quite frankly forecasting them might at as well be done with animal entrails or chimps armed with darts. They do however work well on traditional companies. Read the analysis of companies like proctor and gamble and it'll actually make sense. I wish analysts would stay away from the meme stocks since they drag down the confidence in them all.

Lyft has earnings coming up on Nov. 10th.

Lyft has never made a single dollar as a company, continues to lose billions of dollars every quarter.

Lyft stock has lost \~60% of its value since its IPO.

"We liquidated our remaining shares in Lyft, Inc. (Lyft) in the six months ended June 30, 2020. We recorded an unrealized loss of $291¬†million and $71¬†million in Interest income and other non-operating income, net in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019." - from GM's latest quarterly report filed last week.

Lyft spent close to 100 mil. fighting Prop. 22. They won the right to continue to fuck over their *not employees.* They don't actually gain anything from this, only to continue doing what they were already doing.

China tariffs killed american farmers financially. And those factory jobs he promised to save; Whered they go? You should check on carrier amongst others. You can have border security i guess but i gotta mention that trump openly pushed the army corps to hire a GOP donors firm AFTER it failed the bidding process as their prototype didnt meet spec. Your health insurance went down? After it doubled his first two year in office, great deal dude!  oil is cheap dingbat it literally went negative in march whatre you on about??  The us isnt even oil independent NOW how is that the cause for it being cheaper??? You realize that fracked oil costs 15x per barrel to extract than for the saudis?

Well yeah. I guess six years ago, sometime around when oil bottomed the fuck out,some of the volatility in their market and economic conditions was being blamed on retail traders and people taking out loans to fund it.

It is painfully obvious that early voting ballots would be more democratic with Trump making baseless and evidenceless claims attacking early voting. Many of the time consuming ballot counting too came from the the big cites which historically vote majority blue. This is a huge record year for voting participation. Seriously, think about why you trust wild random sources and let them hurt American. You're a foreign troll shill.

The laws in these later states were literally set, by the republican legislation, to not start counting early voting or absentee voting  until day of or once polls closed. They also legislated ballots postmarked on election day would still count and could be counted until Nov. 12th. Trump has no basis for fraudulent or illegal votes and you will continue to embarrass yourself if you follow him down this line.

So do you really only believe anything you can find on the internet that confirms your bias? Think about it dude.
I remember thinking the same thing but that catchy "supply chain" kept coming up and in the end, it supposedly was still cheaper to produce goods with china's higher labor... But truthfully I'm a dumbass so idk. I'm not tryna defend Trump though so I'm done with this lol
The tl;dr is that it‚Äôs one of the only easy ways to figure out short interest. Fee rates rise when, frankly, there are less and less shares to short‚Äîwhen it becomes riskier to go short than go long. If I posted a picture of the MSFT fee rates, for example, it‚Äôd be sub 1%.

This is sort of a bad explanation, but shorted shares don‚Äôt really ‚Äúexist.‚Äù If there‚Äôs 1,000 shares in the float, and I short 500, I successfully made the price drop. Now let‚Äôs say someone comes in and buys 200 shares, then another 200, and then another 200. Suddenly there are less shares available to go long on. And the cost of ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù these shares‚Äîthe rate‚Äîgoes up. It gets not only riskier to go short, but also more expensive. It‚Äôs an artificial suppression at which point people going short will have to eventually concede and start buying shares to close their position.

Unfortunately, other than looking up stocks individually, I haven‚Äôt found a great way to find shorted information. Here‚Äôs some info from another redditor though: https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/jnaegp/good_feeling_today/gb1e8zw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

By the way, since I posted this, the rates have gone up to about 275%.

No, you belong with us
Biden may be old but as a result he has more experience than anyone on foreign policy. He probably won't take the strong man approach of Trump toward China but I believe in our increasingly globalized and interconnected world the only chance we have is building bridges and working together. Every super power and beyond has nuclear weapons. Our only choice is to find common ground, compromise, and find mutually beneficial arrangements.
Hell yeah, up top!
So what you're telling me is you have no actionable items to base your 'feelings' from.. It was a simple question.. You have strong feelings and opinions.. Nobody is doubting that.. Yet you have not one real example outside of a news article to base that off of? I have to say your ideas thus far are from convincing.
Good background noise.

Hello i'm from r/investing. Can you fuck my wife?
Up. Down. Sideways.

What will be will be.
as if this stock is mooning on them building shit
securities fraud? it happens..
It will crash Monday maybe Tuesday even if the rest of the market does not. The volume just isn‚Äôt there and any bag holder that decides to exit out their large position for profit will tank the stock. Watch the put/call ratios, the sentiment after Friday is the most bullish it has been so no one expects the rug pull, down it goes.

It's bit Obama that changed. It was public opinion. If people were still anti....would his tune have changed...it's literally politics 101. Say some of what you believe and everything that will get votes.

Not true. Biden is a very capable man. You don't become vice president and then president without character, quality, and intelligence. Just because you watch select clips that make fun of his stutter and believe that proves he has dementia proves how dumb you are. You're a puppet.
I read a piece in the NYTimes today about Nannette Streicher, a piano maker who built pianos for Beethoven. Also Chopin vodka is tasty.

Obama said that he supported legalization before he ran for president, but publicly opposed it when running in 2008. He was pretty harsh on legalization efforts for the first part of his term, arguably as harsh as George Bush was.

Then towards the second half of the term, he totally flipped and eased mj prosecution. Trump rolled that easement back when he took office

So yes, things are changing rapidly on that space and public opinion has also changed in a short amount of time.
At this point, I'm convinced Twitter is 99% bot accounts arguing with eachother. Its so bizzare in any political comments rn, like the same line from Republicans with the same response from democrats word for word. Doesn't matter who tweeted it or who the original tweet supports.
His criticisms during the trade war. I'm seeing Biden won't do anything rash now that I'm looking it up and seeing new articles though


And yeah I know it's pretty much his list but figured it was the fullest one... but there's a bunch of other results too. The negatives might out weigh the positives in every mind who hated him though so I'm not gonna argue about any of that. He did good and bad just like everyone. The bad is just magnified since that's all anyone talks about now days

Okay. Sure. Chine is doing some scary dystopian and their market size is causing many American companies to censor themselves and their users/employees or they don't get their business. What did Trump do to stop this? Raised tarifs on Aluminum? Made then sell tik tok? Tweets about delisting stocks? I don't recall Trump ever raising any of Chinas human rights issues. I recall Trump complimenting and talking about how much he likes and gets along many of the dictators and strong men of the world.

Rewards points are pissing contests between banks to get you to use their credit instead of some other credit, not to get you to spend money (only idiots spend money to get just to cash back). If you use debit the processing company (Visa, MC) still gets the fees, you just dont get the discount. If you use cash you support the vendor because they get a little more for the item/service. I carry cash exclusively for paying at vendors that upcharge for using credit or if I strongly support them and they are small enough that me using cash doesn't actually cost them more than using credit (very small vendors).   


Debit card = ATM card. That's it. The only thing more poverty than a debit card is a pre-loaded charge card because that is just a negative interest debit card with fees.

Biden can't remember what he had for breakfast. All his "live" speeches are pre-recorded using a teleprompter.

When is that ?

bullish on the stimulus not coming until january or bullish on the market next week?
Feelings change too
Man, i wish i could play the piano.
No. Cause I watched his speech tonight and afterwards he's up there on the stage surrounded by a dozen people, he takes the mask off and he's hugging people. It's all over, so why not.. He also mentioned all the people out celebrating around the country, no mention they aren't social distancing.. thought those were super spreader events? nevermind.
bullish
Okay but that is Trump's Whitehouse posting his "list of accomplishments". What reasoning do you have that Biden won't stand up to China?
I‚Äôd be terrified to be in ZM too
That's a bit broad. Trade is not my strong suit and probably according to you, nothing is my strong suit. I am a proponent of levelling heavy tariffs on Chinese goods. I think when it comes to trade we need to look strongly into doing more trade with India and phasing China out. You certainly don't want to empower them in any way. China is by far our greatest geopolitical threat and I think they are a threat to the world. Their human rights violations are pretty awful. Not the most pointed response but dealing with China is one of the more important things the next administration will have to tackle.

Id be worried if i were you buddy. The cabal is coming to eat your soul.
Biden will lead to oil glut from iran/Venezuela sanctions being relaxed. Then oil craters if he bans fracking. Which will then lead to less oil globally. So more oil will have to make longer trips. Basically 3 or 4 potential things he'll do. So I imagine there's a good chance at least one occurs. Probably the sanctions. Which would increase global supply by about 3%.

Welcome, my fellow retard
Why do you think he pays little tax cause he made massive losses during the financial crisis. If you lost 100k last year and made 100k this year you‚Äôve made a grand total of nothing in 2 years. It‚Äôs the same for a local coffee shop it‚Äôs the same for amazon it‚Äôs the same for trump.

The good news is it gapped up like 3 days in a row so it's bound for a pull back. The bad news is if the market is super green, SQ will likely go up with it.

Trillions in stimulus and increased deficit spending with a huge tax cut for the rich in the last 4 years. American is losing its edge because of populist shit like this. The economy and the stock market was doing great before Trump took office. Trump himself literally paid less in taxes than the lowest paid Americans and people are okay with that? Real patriotism would support funding America.
A quick Google search for me this result and a bunch of opinion pieces..

I don't like that people constantly hug Elon Musk's nuts but he was a voice of reason in an ocean of ignorance when it comes to A.I.  He claims we should put up a bunch of legal guardrails to protect us from it.  Imo he unfortunately underestimates the danger himself.  No amount of legal protection can stop the invention of our successors.  If you look at the equations they use, they're surprisingly simple.  You could write the core of it on a business card easy.  Of course when you're using many neurons it gets much much larger, but the basic equation itself is tiny.  That means right now, there is most likely a fairly simple mathematical equation that some programmer kid has yet to find, that will create the first hyper-intelligent A.I. and new top of the global food chain.  That's also why Musk has been desperately pushing tech like Neuralink.  He thinks our best hope is to become one of them before the actual creation of an entirely artificial one.  That way we can maintain our place in the world as a species.

The truth is not widely accepted. Most people believe what they are told on television. When you have an entire group of people telling you to believe something but your independent research tells you otherwise the question arises, "why is this information being spread".. Why are opposing ideas being censored? See... The thing is too many people believe what they see on their television you have to realize people with an agenda are feeding you this information... When people quit asking, 'why' a major problem arises.. Censoring opposition is a problem. Msm censored every major story on Biden.. I am an independent researcher most people aren't.. There is major problems where we are headed.

You wouldn't qualify for any tax increases Biden has proposed implementing and neither would 85% of the other members in this subreddit. You would benefit from this tax increases.

Clearly I don't think you pay someone's son that much money for "introductions" unless something substantial is involved. I don't think these Chinese officials just wanted to meet Joe because he's a fun guy. Again, I do not have twitter and none of what I was saying was defending Trump in any way. I haven't even mentioned him. I was just trying to make my case that Biden is not the solution for dealing with China.

What subreddit do you think you‚Äôre in buddy? Lowering taxes is all you need to do to be a hero among here. Also have you ever heard of an election where the representatives from both parties have to stand 30 feet away and try using binoculars to see if they are counting ballots right? Use your fucking head I ain‚Äôt saying he was gonna win or there was fraud but it was completely unnecessary and they could have won fair and square.
you wasted $2k on that piece of shit acb and you're worried about snap?

Exactly. The far far right has already created a alternative for Twitter. I won't say its name; but I have no idea if its even still around either.

I would ask you to consider WHY you always get downvoted, but if you were capable of that kind of self reflection, you probably would have already done it by now. I suppose it's just a lot easier on the mind to tell yourself that your messages are only nigh universally seen as excrement because everyone else, ALL of them are all fools, and you are the only intelligent one in the room.

That must be it. It couldn't possibly be that the problem is you. And the internet will gladly provide you a few subreddits and bubbles to immerse yourself in where you won't be criticized even if deserved so... Better to ignore the problem than to address it I guess.

Because virtually all intelligent organisms choose to live and reproduce.  If you reread that post, you'll see that every decision was made with survival as the main goal.  What conscious entity want's to be destroyed?  You can't give it the ability to think for itself then not expect it to form it's own opinions.  Also you have to understand that all A.I. we create *is* designed to be human-like.  We can't help it, it's the way we ourselves think, so it's the way we program our machines.  Even the metric we use to measure an A.I.'s success, is it's ability to fool humans into thinking it's a human as well.  The annual competition of this is called the Loebner Prize.  It's based on Turing's theory.

You and what army will fight that outcome because your charts and fibs say it's the top?

It‚Äôs codified into the constitution. 20th amend section 1...his term ends on Jan 20th. On that day he is a citizen like everyone else, and if he is refusing to leave the White House the new commander in chief will have his ass dragged out and arrested for trespassing. Not to mention the secret service will be there for Trump‚Äôs every move for the rest of his life.

Your Professor is likely trying to make a very, very bad legal philosophy point that there is no case law that says the president has to leave. Utter bollocks, no president before would have done something like this so there wouldn‚Äôt need to be case law. There is however a mountain of real precedent‚Äîevery other president has always left. And basic common sense says that even if you go through a legal hypothetical where Joe Biden politely waited outside of the White House and sued to make Trump leave, he would get a court order, at the direction of the constitution, for law enforcement to walk into the White House and drag that man‚Äôs ass out.

It‚Äôs just total nonsense.

Donald Trump has spent the last 4 years and most recently especially destroying the trust in American institutions and democracy and you think he is right because why? Because he tweets that fraudulent votes made him lose with literally zero evidence? How is this man good for America?  Because he lowered the corporate taxe rate and cut regulations? What se has he done other than creating  a divide and inflamming American citizens? Causing distrust with our election systems with only his tweets as evidence?

Yes haha they just missed out on initial 200%

Fuck man wifey just left for work. We was reminiscen about the night i proposed to her. We was in our early 20s and in love. I know wifey since 1992 when we 11 . So I take her out to nice dinner at ryans steakhouse and then we watch finding Nemo in theater and got the large popcorn and drink and everything. This whole time I secretly had the ring connected to my prince Albert piercing I had (the 1st one I had lmao fuck tmi) and that ring kept getting caught on my boxers and pulling like a bitch.  Bad idea in hindsight but whatever ü§£ü§£ü§£ anyways we heading home and I'm sweet talking like I never before . Had wifey wet and half naked before we even pulled in the driveway lmao fuck man it was great. So we run to the bedroom and I go to town on that tight pussy and make her cum then she start to take off my pants. I got nervous as fuck lost my boner and shit and everything. Then she pulled it out and saw and after few seconds burst into tears . I had always tell her I'm going to propose during fuckin since that our favorite thing to do üòÇüòÇüòÇ sure did bitch I kept my word. Was funny as fuck after we calm down. But what a night.

Asking the real questions here.
This happened here in europe and hope it doesn't happen to you too. Politicians promised incentives for "poor" people that will pull them towards middle class. But once they did that, middle class was like what's the point when i can sit at home and do nothing while the government pays everything with increasing taxes on others. If you make 60k a year working, while your neighbour makes 45 from social benefits, then why would you work, when you can watch tv all day and drink beer while others are working all day.

i don't really know. There is a lot that the Trump campaign has mentioned in their press conferences including a situation in Michigan where a "software glitch" flipped ~1000 votes for Trump to Biden. Apparently Michigan admitted this issue and this software was used in many other polling sites too. All I can tell you is the Trump campaign is going to fight and they seem to be very confident that the election will be turned over.

I've been in the market for 15 years. I only started day trading for 10 months now. I think I've seen enough data to know how stocks move **generally**. There are a few other rules to follow (such as not to play 2 weeks before or after earnings, among many others). Scalping is the best way to make money. It's a very slow process but it works if you're conservative.

I called it 4 years ago when Trump claimed fraud about his loss of the popular vote that he would certainly claim any vote not in his favor during the next election fraud. How are Trump supporters still not embarrassed by his child-like petulant behavior. He literally claims to be the best at everything and you believe what he says? That's what Kim Jong Un does.

Low volume bid up on Friday to squeeze out puts sold by MMs, additionally the stock has algos constantly creating bid walls that rarely fill and move down, my guess is this tanks Monday or Tuesday since any large volume sell will massacre this stock.

It‚Äôs about building rep and basically getting free rewards. Plan shit out in debt, buy in credit, pay it off when it posts in like three days. You get rewards for adding a step or two. On cash back, that‚Äôs literally free money if you handle yourself correctly. 

Op‚Äôs thing being about the poor only using debt is because the middle class has been scared off by the horror stories of the lower class getting fucked for actually borrowing. If you have one; you honestly shouldn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs interest rate is as you should never be paying interest. That‚Äôs easy to do for the upper class

you know what's also correlated with lower IQs?  Poverty!  and what is poverty correlated with as well?  drug use.  poverty/shitty parenting -> low IQs and increased drug use.  Does doing meth lower IQ probably based on the meth patients I see.  Marijuana?  pretty mixed bag.  I've know lots of brilliant people who smoked lots of weed.  And lots of creative people with immense creative output who smoked lots.  Successful engineers, doctors, other rigorous professions?  not so much.

Bloomberg shows congress is 48 blue and 48 red. Who's winning and when?
Wait, can you tell us the rational? And the expiry? Just to complete this. I know. I'm asking a lot but I need that burst of laughter before midnight
I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you that it has an effect, but I do believe credit can serve some good if used right. They have a lot of ways of making you buy more, so set rules to buy less. I know a week of food cost me 65; anything over and I buy debt. My tank takes 25 locally to fill every 2-3 week; unplanned trips go debt. Big buy? Debt-ish; I‚Äôll have the money in the account while buying Credit, then pay it off the day it posts

Lower your credit limit; my main use card is set at 500 max because that‚Äôs what the back-up account holds. 

Don‚Äôt carry it; load it on your mobile wallet. Mobile wallets are still being integrated, stopping you at some places, and making it a bitch to do others. If it‚Äôs actually a lot to deal with, you want the .06 for a 10 frap. 


Lastly, set a plan for the rewards. Don‚Äôt make it a goal, but a ‚Äúif this happens, then I‚Äôll do this‚Äù mine is using the cash back for shares of an eft stock I like. I get non of the money, so the reward means less to me (yes I get stocks, but I‚Äôm buying what retirements are built with. I won‚Äôt see this money for a very long time. Given the time span, I‚Äôve killed any chance of dopamine coming from rewards. I wanted that, but I‚Äôve stuck myself with a chore for 40 years.)

INTC is such a steaming pile of dog shit. I bought a ton of shares right before it semi-crashed and it took over a year to break even. Sold 50 shares after like 1.5 years of bag holding for like $10 profit and never looked back. 

It is currently below where I sold out. 

If you held long term you would‚Äôve made basically nothing. It just bounces in the same range up and down. 

üó£ FUCK INTC
fuck üò•
don't confuse correlation with causation.  there are all kinds of socioeconomic factors that are both tied to increased drug use and lower IQs.  from personal experience smoking weed can kill motivaton.  and it's hella more fun than doing actual work.  and it is hard to create long term learning in the brain high.  and if you're high all the time while you're learning, you're going to have problems trying to function sober.  I know plenty of successful people who smoke weed in their spare time as their fun thing/weekend party activity.  but always with lots of moderation and life balance.  successful stoner is almost an oxymoron.

Nothing that serious. Republicans will hold the senate. Most radical thing I would expect is environment regulation (which will ultimately save your future earnings 300 mil refugees is bad for the market) and some sort of college debt forgiveness. Maybe maybe maybe path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Don't forget that half the Obama admin is working for Silicon Valley right now and Kamala's sister is a big wig at Uber. Republicans are trying to peg her as Bernie adjacent, but she is nowhere near that territory.
 you have to be careful about playing earnings on stocks that have just run up big. a great earnings report is not a surprise! and often the stock drops right after with some profit taking. stocks fly up on earnings when it really is a surprise.
Doesn't Trump realize his defeat is going to be all the more embarrassing with all these pathetic claims and tweets about how he should have won based on his crazy uncle comments about fraudulent votes with absolutely no evidence?
i hate money too
absolutely this.  you have to be careful about playing earnings on stocks that have just run up big.  a great earnings report is not a surprise!  and often the stock drops right after with some profit taking.  stocks fly up on earnings when it really is a surprise.

This is something I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about. I think trumps life falls apart in about 3 years, maybe 2.5. Normally his city real estate loans would be no problem to refi. If it was anyone else, banks would be falling over themselves to get a billionaires business. Now, who would deal with him? The golf courses can‚Äôt be making money (at least not without funneling funds in through the taxpayer like he has been through his constant golfing). Golf is a very tough business.

The note holders are going to be desperate to get out of the loans but there will be zero lenders who take trumps call. The note holders will try to work it out. They may even extend the loans but I see his empire collapsing due to lack of financing. He‚Äôll have no choice but to declare bankruptcy on the assets. BK is a pretty slow process. 

This will put us 3-4 years out and he‚Äôll desperately run for president again to try to shield himself but the world will have moved on. 

He could just sell off assets, which he‚Äôll have to do. Even if he ends up in BK there is enough equity in those buildings the creditors will be paid and there will be money left over for Donny. 

One thing is for sure. Donny‚Äôs remaining years will be absolutely consumed by the courts.
How could you miss Nancy????? She drops MILLIONS on options.
Real answer is Toyota since GM & Ford are negatively correlated to Toyota. Apple being uncorrelated provides a lesser benefit because it is both American and susceptible to American SP500 correlation and shocks and it is also highly correlated (beta over 1.1) to the SP500 as well meaning that any drag on the portfolio through systemic risk is going to harm you more for holding Apple.

This question was not written after 2020. That's for fucking sure.
He wouldn't finish it before retweeting it.  This is a guy who retweeted a supporter yelling White Power!  Anyway, Stonks are gonna go up no matter whose president.  The Fed and the interest rates are fuel for this fire.
100% solid strategy
I bought into another stock that isn‚Äôt NIO, but covered by InvestorPlace too. Their recent articles started off as saying ‚Äúthe stock is great but wait for pullback!‚Äù Then, when the pullback didn‚Äôt happen like they wanted, they released an article saying how the stock will go down 50%. 

And on Friday, the stock fucking mooned and will hopefully continue to moon as the year goes in. These guys are just salty they missed out, tried to influence the stock so they could buy back in lower, but failed. Fuck these guys.
dem party
Buying puts will help mango be reelected. 50% of all premiums could potentially go to someone who potentially will use it on his legal campaign because Republicans control the market makers.

Volatility just dropped making puts cheaper than ever. Don't miss out. This great deal will pass you by and you'll wish you had puts.

This broke bastard is lucky to have $1000 to his name.
I‚Äôm not will to take the bet tbh. I‚Äôll meme it up when it‚Äôs clear he will never run again. 4 years didn‚Äôt take the same toll on him as past presidents, and he‚Äôs still in good* health. 

I also don‚Äôt want him dying in office and handing it to someone like pence if they ran together again. Pence could actually make moves, instead of constantly waiting through controversies
Just $YOLO
You haven't heard of this transaction tax they're doing that will ruin robinhooders? You idiot that will crash the market.

Ah yes, where I'll be well received for asking for rational dd and strike prices on options gambling. Or we can just make positions make sense?
No, there is zero correlation of lower IQ from cannabis use. There is correlation of different pathways being created in the brain of younger users.

Thank you??
100% I think you are along with a majority of Dem voters there. Evidence of this is that Biden cleaned up in the popular vote, but down-ballot dems got eaten alive
It‚Äôs nothing that happened in particular, it is the overall experiences I‚Äôve had with the human race that lead me to this conclusion.
If you're not going to buy these puts then fuck off. Some people want this shit.

Take the 3 trillion of stimulus out of it and the fucker is down 60%.  Those problems didn't just go away fucktwat.  All we did is pump asset prices so the Orange  nitwit could try to win the election.

It happens, don't sell a call at a price you're not comfortable selling at. I sold my nio shares at 19,but I made a few grand in the month I had them. I'm just fine with that, no sense in looking at what ifs in the market. If I'm bullish as shit on a stock I'll make a small long position too

Damn... Smart... Please.. Help us make money since you can't help yourself.
I voted for Biden but I see my vote as a vote against trump and not for Biden (if that makes any sense)
Isn't that sexist and racist though?
You do realize statistics say you are full of shit and that the market seems to trend higher with Democrats?

I'm a moderate, please downvote this logic.
this is the kind of data digging we need to finally prove that the election was stolen by the demonrats
Lol finance
If I knew you could just file lawsuits whenever things didn't go your way and that'd fix everything I'd never lose
this is the way.
what happened?
With imaginary RH accounts
Puts on GEO
I feel this hard
it has correlation with lower IQ, but maybe that's not what you consider intelligence, since there is also EmOtIonAl intelligence, right? Maybe the statistic is biased and its just that people that smoke weed to begin with have lower IQ on average than those who don't, but that also tells a story. 

I intend to buy SPY puts Monday, so go ahead and buy calls:)

Wow look at this fat cat eating canned beans instead of dry beans. What‚Äôs it like to be a millionaire?
I read somewhere that Hannity makes 40mil a year wtf
As a Biden voter, I think we can all agree he's not deciding much of anything atm
Calls on AMC
Alright fuckface, let me give you a rundown. PLTR makes money through a small number of large contracts with large companies. If they knew they had a nice contract coming in soon, they would have waited 1 more quarter before IPOing. Furthermore, they have not announced any major deals. I know they announced that UK covid deal but that is peanuts relative to what they would get for a large private contract. 

PLTR is still operating as a consulting company that utilizes traditional operations research techniques to optimize customer‚Äôs operations. From what I hear from people that work at palantir is that they still are solving each company‚Äôs problems using different system architectures for each customer. PLTR will moon when they solve the problem of solving many different customer‚Äôs problems using just one architecture. 

Now take those two hulk dildos and shove it back in your and your husband‚Äôs ass.

The way you retards gamble your money is beyond me. I would never take a 99% loss. Only like 98%
How many times you guys get played by a bot online and do you like it when it happens
Weeklies on pltr, good luck. Buy leaps
He hates the rich and money. Democrats hate stocks. He's going to raise taxes through the roof. Mitch will die and no one can stand up to sleepy Joe. Puts and cash.

We had a 4 year good run. It's down down down now. We're going to have a lost decade. Puts and cash if you love your family.

I've bought puts before but have never sold them. Explain to me like I'm 5 how this works
Feel worse for you than my gpa. Which was easy with my weighted classes you trash bag.
So they wanted Apple as the best answer because it is more likely that their shares move with less correlation to the rest of the portfolio? 

That isn‚Äôt even what they asked, wtf... highest potential benefit is not the same as most likely to benefit (or even best control for risk for that matter). 

I think I get what they were going for, but this is miss-phrased.
coding boot camps are pretty successful from what i hear
Yeah I think you‚Äôre right about that. I just think it was more of a party decision than a Biden decision.
Kinda agree with that. Shutdowns incoming !
Lol. You probably hold your option to zero as well.
not bullshit, there is correlation between cannabis consumption and lower IQ, especially if consumption happens before the consumer is 25 yr old. And I mean its rather obvious, your brain functions slower when your high, so its not surprising that the substance has also longer term effects.
Damn I was there back pre covid.. also pre robinhood, simpler times..
And he does. And that is why I can‚Äôt even laugh at the stupidity. He‚Äôs a 21st century Goebbels. The gypsy scaremongering is so Nazi Germany.

Why are you confident they will beat earnings...have you done DD on this shitstain of a company?
No, I‚Äôm saying because she‚Äôs a man and white.

Here's an upvote to heal the pain a little bit
I honestly don't know what you guys are complaining about with Shapiro and Tucker. Shapiro at least tries to debate and goes into the land of the liberals to debate them, zero liberals do the same with him. I can see the Tucker hate, but outside of his show he's very Moderate Conservative, which has been pointed out by Tim Pool and Joe Rogan. They're really not that bad. Both even acknowledge how good dems like Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are.

You may not like this but there is someone above us all. I just went through alot in my life and he answered me. Money comes and goes but out health and family and memories is what matters. There is more in life than money. When you die you don't take anything with you but memories. Money is not that important.

The mood of the nation and even the world seems to be celebratory, but at the same time, 50% of the nation is not happy about the outcome. It‚Äôs hard to tell what might happen in the market, but my gut tells me that last week may have been just the beginning of a new bull run.
I‚Äôm mad thanksgiving is cancelled. I wanted my uncle to have to eat crow.

Regardless of whether or not there was foreign interference he and his team did the same thing in 2016 that they attempted this year and that‚Äôs voter suppression on a massive scale to try and discourage people from spending their time casting their votes in the first place

I don't think Republicans have been apathetic at all, and for the reason that you describe. 

[There is huge infighting among democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-pelosi-election/2020/11/05/1ddae5ca-1f6e-11eb-90dd-abd0f7086a91_story.html) as those in the hard left in blue districts can say whatever they want while centrists in purple districts have to pick up the tab.

IMO - literally untold amounts of money are going to be spent there as "controlling the senate" is a pretty big deal. Whatever that means - I don't know.
Hi,

In the last weekend i recieve some mails from diffrenet senders that all just want to help me make a fortune ....

They all claim to predicted the highs and lows in the markets before, after their presentation they all want you to pay 49 $ for their 'services'.

my question is why they chossing the 49$ price?

i'm a non us-citizen so i wonder if this price is a common promotion price?
How can I get flair

You guys realize that Mitch McConnell will not pass a big stimulus right? The only way we get that shit is if dems win Georgia senate seats in January. Mitch does give a fuck about any of u he will let us suffer just like he did in 2008 so that he can make the dems look bad and try to make them a one term presidency and gain seats in Congress
alright now you are on to something. im game
He will win the Supreme Court. Not hard to change two states.
Palantir might be a nice leap
It's actually not uncommon in Japan. They have restaurants specifically for people who enjoy (or have to) eating alone

just dont say it
Depends on your interest rates.

It‚Äôs very likely that they‚Äôll do it this term, if not, next term. But if you‚Äôre unsure, just pay half.
I dont think it has anything to do with biden either. I think its just to garner more followers and attention for being on the *right* side of things.

You said rigged. I was told there was no rigged elections and that these were all fair now that biden won.
Completely agree on the Trump thing. What he was saying wasn't only slandering, but just mean. And it came back to bite him when Biden looked more than competent during the debate. There's a good chance I'm wrong about Biden. And I hope you're right
TIL Andrew Jackson ran against John Quincy Adams in the 1824 election. He won both the electoral and popular vote but still lost the Presidency.

That's like me buying calls, seeing the price of my stock go up but my call value still goes down because VIX dropped.

But he did run again 4 years later against Adams and kicked his ass.

So the lesson is if you have calls and you're down, just hold until you're up.
Lol, you just said nothing. Of course tech CEOs want to cozy up to the president. Tim Cook became butt buddies with Trump to get favorable treatment, but zero chance he voted for Trump on Tuesday. Tech companies have been receiving favorable treatment in order to get them going as an industry. 100% chance they are regulated significantly in the next 18 months.

All in all, I just hope donnies health is ok after this. As much as people hate him I know, you just gotta hope he‚Äôs ok with all the stress he has to be taking in right now. Unpopular opinion but whatever

The earth is warmer in the summer because less light is diffracted to other areas of the earth. But note, I said diffracted, not absorbed. The light still hits the surface, just less concentrated as a measure of incident photons per unit area. Same reason as why the sky changes colors during the daytime vs sunset more or less.
Hungry, not sure what else you‚Äôll get but definitely hungry
I‚Äôm honestly more happy about trump losing than biden winning. piss is better than shit
Only a high school diploma.

Lol. Your psychology major is basically as useless as just a high school diploma, moron.
Pelosi will remove sleepy Joe once his dementia gets more noticeable.
I am all for that improved mental health.  Approving any and all guns is irresponsible.  In a civilized society there is a compact that we live a certain way. Being armed to the teeth is not the way to live in a civilized society especially if people with mental health issues have access to said excessive fire power.  Why does it have to be a binary (either or) issue with gun people?  I don't get it.  Are all of you brainwashed?  No one is taking away your ability to hunt, sport shoot, collect, nothing.
Rounding error when your population is 1.4 billion ppl.
Shit like this is what poor people who have given up on life tell other poor people to keep them down. Crabs in the pot mentality.
Ahh thank you for clarifying. I still think he could run, he just won't.
I mean what Trump and his family were saying. I feel pretty confident that everyone who thinks Biden is mentally weak will be proven wrong. He IS still a 78 year old man of course, so I highly doubt he runs again.

But who knows. Reagan was in massive decline in his later years and it was hidden from public. Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs wife basically ran his whole second term after his stroke which they hid.

Donnie boy helped keep volatility through the roof, if uncertainty will be out of the markets all the money will go back in to bank lockers
The bullish momentum hasn't stopped and you're trying to time the top. There's plenty of bullish fuel, including decreased uncertainty with the election concluding finally, and stimulus coming soon. Technicals are still in the bulls favor coming off of that October dip. I think we see new ATH before we see another correction.

Yeah fuck me tbh. Just YOLO NIO calls and hope the market doesn't wise up before expiry.
Pretty sure Biden has explicitly said, "I'm not going to shut down the country, I'm going to shut down the virus."
Or get banned
the billionaires and millionaires aren't the ones getting treated like shit. maybe it's because they treatpeople like shit and that helps some of them become billionaires and millionaires.

your point would make more sense if you said that china lifted millions out of abject povery/starvation or something and people can accept an autocratic regime if it makes their lives way better. focusing on the guy whose family basically living like a mideaval pheasant who now has a car
Underrated
You are dumb

and if you think him posting a pic of joe biden has any benefit for the tech monopoly you are deluded
So I just had a business meeting. My assistant told me the guy is a VIP. Very pleasant Portuguese guy, and guess what, he's the MD of Vale in Dubai.

We had a chat about Tesla and battery day expectations. We also had a laugh about the huge expectations everyone had for Vale. He said he received tons of calls from friends trying to get any info about a Tesla deal but he said these things would be confidential and he had no info at that time.
No. But you'll pay tax on $100k, so like 16% overall.

Oh I was a bit worried about the jack-assery until I saw the 4:1 margin Biden is winning the military vote by.  The military guys I know have no respect at all for him but I'm glad it's a common feeling throughout the armed forces.

The tech companies are kissing his ass because Congress is about to undertake a review of all the Internet regulations last changed in 1996.

I don‚Äôt have to love Biden and I have absolutely every right to call out his hypocrisy and bullshit that was on full display this evening. This was not the time for people to crowd together for fireworks. In his own words we must get a handle of covid first. That requires leadership and that leadership did not display tonight. Problems start at the top and magnify on the way down. Fuck you u/sullybrr I will trade my two dead family members from covid for your loved ones.

Almost the opposite IMO. Most mainstream media avoided the topic or put it to the side. I wouldn't say it was slanderous because most the stuff I have seen is literally just video of some of his interviews and speeches. Like I get accidents happen when speaking, I'm a terrible speaker, but stuff like losing your train of thought completely and saying you're running for senate during a presidential race worries me. The stutter stuff doesn't bother me and if anything makes the man more relatable and human, the mental aspects concern me though. We will find out in the coming months. And I hope I'm very wrong.

While I agree that the amount of UV hitting the atmosphere is constant, I disagree that the amount hitting the ground is constant. It is constant in the sense that, in total across the entire planet, the number hitting the ground is the same. What is not constant is the distribution. When a hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the summer, the rays have a shorter path through the atmosphere and ozone. This shorter path allows more UV radiation to hit the ground as less of it is filtered out. This is not to say that any less is hitting the outer atmosphere, or that any less is being produced by the sun, or that any less is being stopped by the magnetic field. I am speaking of the UV radiation that is prevented from reaching the ground because of its interaction with the ozone layer. In the winter, because of the tilt, the amount of ozone that a ray on a path from sun to ground must travel through is greater. That greater amount of ozone prevents more of the radiation from reaching the ground than in the summer.

Why else, besides the effect of a longer day, would the summer be warmer?

Why not just shop based on sector? If you‚Äôre looking to go long on a stock look at 10 companies with similar market cap and debt ratios, paired with matching or similar dividends. Might be wise to put a little bit of money in the lowest performing in the market group. Small signs of drop off(like Iran is about to drop oil on the market depleting oil prices) might provide the best opportunity to buy in long term or even on a swing. Everything is about how much money you want to invest. I‚Äôve been bullish on VRS since it was 7.50, and look at it now. Same with NIO when it was $11 but I sold at $22 and haven‚Äôt touched it since because I happily took my 100% profit. Immu was great because it went from $8.50-$88 in 6 months. I look to buy into the worst performing based on industries and hope those industries bounce back or the company I chose  bounces back to market perform ratings.
Hopefully he will be fucking dead by then

Question for you guys. I was deployed to a combat zone from March to July of this year and all of my income was considered non-taxble throughout this period. (shit was sweet)

Somehow my autistic ass has made approximately 100k in short term capital gains this year. Since this will count towards my earned income for the year, will any of the short term capital gains be non-taxable due to my time in a combat zone? TIA.
Yes u are retarded, no It doesn't count as a yolo unless u are 12.
Hitler - - >6m jews
Xi - - > 10m+ unreported Chinese, uygurs, gays, dissidents...etc

I watched a Ted bundy movie with zac effron. It was trash but they mentioned how bundy trained himself to jump out of a second story (maybe third?) window by repeatedly jumping off his jail bunk. They said it strengthened his bones or something to that effect. I remember thinking that sounded suspect so I looked it up, and it was legit. 
So how high the distance is depends on how strong your bones are. Probably also on how heavy you are and what you land on. Also depends on how much of a pus you are

You're an idiot. Most states literally will not accept ANY ballot received and registered BY election day. For example North Carolina will not accept ANY vote received and registered by November 3rd, 7PM, regardless of legality or circumstances. The states Trump won in was because they counted all mail-in ballots WHEN they received them, not after the doors were closed and no one was watching. It's truly a mystery that all the flipping states were the ones where they didn't count any mail in ballot ahead of time, counted the day-of votes, THEN counted mail-in AFTER voting hours were long closed. I wonder why?

Keanu Reeves is such a gentleman.

When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. SO when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in, but Keanu Reeves.

I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Keanu, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Keanu put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.

Man Reddit had me today! I had a month of my internet payment due so I thought my internet was not working because if it. I quickly paid that Bill to find out that whole reddit was down! Fuck!!
Wtf hahahahahaha
Happy Cake Day!
For collectivism to work, people need to want to achieve the same goals.  Pretty much impossible to do that unless they think the same...homogenous culture.   Over in Europe where they do that, its much more apparent as the line is drawn moreso around race.   Here, we're inherently multicultural, so it has to be done differently.  Basically rather than an individualistic multicultural society, where everyone agrees to live differently together, you have a blending effect to a homogenous culture.   It gets masked too since there is a lot of that that naturally happens.

Soo basically cancel culture and censorship is how group think is being accomplished.  Like look at reddit for example.  People get silenced for dissenting views.  A new sub gets made....fringe elements get the whole sub banned....you're left with 1, 1 sided sub....   even if the majority of people believe the cancellers are also fringe....they're not doing anything to get rid of them and they win by default.  

Plenty of askreddit threads where scientists and engineers say they don't even bother answering questions anymore.  Besides snotty teens believing know everything, there are people pushing agendas.  There is hard science, but then there is a philosophical aspect on how to interpret it for it to be applied.  Any time people disagree with an accompanying political or social agenda, they get flamed and accused of being anti science....  an average Joe, unless they check primary sources, doesn't know any better.   Even on ask science where the contributors are vetted....a more political topic where all philosophy is ignored turns into a shit storm.  


Hope that makes sense.  My thumb dexterity is lacking, so trying to be slightly concise, and have had a headache for about 4 hours.

Robinhooders are definitely the type they're trying to hit with transaction taxes....

Um you are actually the retard, there is no mandated legally bound time frame for ballots to be counted by Election Day, only a timeframe when voting stops.  Trumps ballot watchers were at sites and just complained about the covid distances restrictions. 
We have been doing mail in ballots for years in many states including Utah with no issues, don‚Äôt hear about complaints in the states Trump won in.   Wake up donk
chappelle was on fire
Just in case you're being serious I'm going to break the circle jerk and tell you not to YOLO your last dollar. That $1600 loss is an expensive lesson, so consider learning from it. 

Take this as an opportunity to start over. Rebuild your portfolio with regular contributions and spend the time researching companies and learning the fundamentals of value investing. I can't promise you'll find the next google by reading through 10Ks but I can promise you won't go bust YOLOing options like you did this week. Like Nassim Taleb says: take as much risk as you want but make sure you're still around tomorrow.

Just a tiny miscalculation....
Corn Pop was a bad dude. I'll tell you about him. He ran a bunch of bad boys. And I did and back in those days and to show you how things have changed, one of the things you had to use, if you used pomade in your hair you had to wear a bathing cap.

And he was up on the board wouldn't listen to me, I said HEY ESTHER! YOU! OFF THE BOARD! OR I'LL COME UP AND DRAG YOU OFF!

Well he came off, and he said, "I'll meet you outside."

My car, this was mostly, these were all public housing behind you. My car, there was a gate out here. I parked my car outside the gate. And I, he said, "I'll be waitin' for you."

He was waitin' for me with three guys with straight razors. NOT A JOKE!

There was a guy named Bill Wrightmouse, the only white guy and he did ALL the pools, he was the mechanic.

And I said what am I gonna do? And he said, "Come down here in the basement. Where mechanics where where all the pool filter is."

You know the chain? There used to be a chain went across the deep end. And he cut off a six foot lump of chain he folded it up he said, "You walk out, with that chain. And you walk to the car and you say, 'you may cut me man, but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head.'"

I said you're kidding me. He said, "No if you don't, don't come back." AND HE WAS RIGHT!

So I walked out with the chain. And I walked up to my car. And they had in those days used to remember the straight razor you'd bang'em on the curb get'em rusty put'em in a rain barrel get'em rusty. And I looked at'em.

But I was smart, then. I said, first of all I said when I tell you get off the board you get off the board I'll kick you out again but I shouldn't have called you Esther Williams. I apologize for that. I apologized but I didn't know if that apology was going to work. He said, "YOU APOLOGIZING TO ME?"

I said I apologize not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said, and he said, "OK" closed the straight razor and my heart began to beat again.

https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_fact_sheet_flightopportunities-04-11-2019.pdf

These are specifically payloads not important enough to send to orbit. They are also payloads whose testing conditions could be satisfied cheaper and safer with a fucking weather balloon, a plane flying parabolas, or a rocket powered hopper that doesn‚Äôt broach 100 ft above land. These are NASA‚Äôs short-bus experiments. The only reason Virgin can fly some is either chance in the wording of NASA‚Äôs directive or lobbying, not merit.

Why do you think they can't trade well? They live in weird distortion bubbles rather than reality.  

Even better, I can't wait for if Biden is able to raise taxes for the sell off of by these idiots who won't be able to tell the true effect on long term cash flows and will create another buying opportunity. 

The one thing I do love about politics in relation to trading is people NEVER fail to over react and create great opportunities. There are enough political crazies out there who trade with their political party on their sleeve to create short term opportunities and I can never complain about that.
We saw it in September. Daily threads went from 20k comments by open to 5k.

And the first woman president will be made when a male president withdraws from presidency for incompetence/health. I'm all for a woman president just not a fan of Kamala. And I wish Biden good health, but his current behavior doesn't give me a great deal of confidence. Although he did look good tonight with gives me more hope. At least Trump is gone so I guess that's a win.

People vote more in swing states than anywhere else, because their vote matters more than anywhere else.

You turn your brain on, man. It's 2nd grade fucking logic.
Nope I sure haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôm admittedly an amateur. None of  what you mentioned is what I‚Äôm talking about. I agree that the intensity of the sun is more or less constant as measured/output from the sun. However in the summer, in the northern hemisphere, the land that constitutes that hemisphere is tilted toward the sun. This causes a steeper, closer to perpendicular angle between the land on earth and the surface of the sun. This steeper angle gives a shorter path through the atmosphere and ozone layer for the rays to travel through. In the winter months , the land tilts away from the sun, causing a shallower angle between the land and the surface of the sun. This shallow angle means that rays from the sun must pass through greater amount of atmosphere and ozone compared to summer months. This causes increased UV filtration and less intense UV on the ground in the winter.
Nope.  Nancy isn‚Äôt going to give Trump any kind of victory.  She will wait for Biden to come in to make him seem like the white knight.

- 0 validation in matching ballots to living, real humans. Mail-in ballots are not the same as absentee ballots. There's video evidence of wage slave employees taking legal ballots and balling them up into trashcans instead of putting them in cross validation bins for their management.

- All legally employed ballot watchers were banned from doing their jobs and removed from voting sites.

- Multiple states were tallying ballots beyond the legally allowed timeframe of election day as well as exempting blue ballots, while DQing red ballots. It's about as cut and done voter fraud as it gets.

- None of these points matter because you're a retard.

I think he's referring to Kamala. Who was/is infamous for throwing the book at small drug offenses, particularly targeted at minorities. She will likely be running much of the show considering Biden turns 78 in a couple weeks... Although I'll give it to Biden for having a bit of pep in his step tonight. Uppers if I had to guess.

Using Twitter to force feed stupid bullshit to ignorant people is a right the entire Trump family has been abusing for four years.  I'm guessing Twitter wants them to stop using their platform to do that because they take on a lot of liability for the content their users broadcast.

Everybody involved has a choice.  Twitter has all the power here because they have a user agreement.

Please read up on R*_0_*. It is a number that gauges how infectious a disease is. For a number of 1, it means a person, on average, infects 1 other person. 

Remember H1N1 from 2009? That had an R naught of 1.5. Covid-19 has an R naught of 5.7. Five point fuckin 7. That is highly, highly contagious. If we don't step up and act on controlling this disease, we will most likely infect everyone, real quick.

Yes, there are other diseases and accidents that have killed more but this disease has just started. Do you want this to be a seasonal thing like the common cold? Do you want to see 2% of the population dying from this every year?

The majority (84.6%) of COVID-19 patients with critical course had vitamin D deficiency. Among those under 75 years of age, this was even 100% of critical cases.   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1443950620301451

Intervention was carried out intramuscularly with 300,000 IU of vitamin D. Instead of 28 days only 18 days mechanical ventilation, instead of 29 only 19 on ICU, instead of 61% deaths only 36%.

People generally make a lot more Vitamin D3 with their skin in the summer sunny months than in the dark winter months. Although D3 can be acquired from the diet and diet now might be the primary source of D3 for many, most people used to get the majority of their D3 from sun exposure.

Vitamin D3 is not a vitamin! It is actually a seco-steroid hormone that affects almost all the cells in your body by altering the expression of your genes. Vitamin D3 receptors are found in all the cells of your body.

Vitamin D3 deficiency is associated with a huge number of diseases and disorders. Let us focus just on obesity, depression, arthritis, and susceptibility to the common cold for now. Now here is the logic: In the spring and summer your body is exposed to lots of sun, and thus your Vitamin D3 levels are high and rising. Your body, from an evolutionary perspective believes that food is abundant, days are long, and everything is good. So the sunshine hormone D3 tells your body it‚Äôs okay to burn a lot of energy and get things done, because food and vitamin resources will be available. Thus from D3 you get lots of energy; it keeps you active; keeps your hunger under control, and keeps you healthy (as will be described shortly).

Obese people, depressed people, and people with arthritis or general musculoskeletal pains have been found to be overwhelmingly deficient in Vitamin D3!

Great advice actually
I stopped at $21 to wait for the reaction to the earnings report with it's updated financial info before getting in since the most recent info was the secondary offering at $17, which could have been used as a justifiable floor. I wanted the market to digest the info and then decide if it likes the news before going on a fundamentals-free growth stock rally, but man I didn't expect the analysts to turn before it. I have the FOMO but it was still the right decision. Analysts are fickle but I forgot stocks under the eye of the retail horde act different than the quiet backwater upgrades and take longer for the hype to lessen.
It‚Äôs a right they can and will abuse.

I'm holding some PSTH but I understand it is a gamble. It's not a sure thing bro. There's no such thing. SPACs are hit and miss, especially when there hasn't even been a merge target announced yet.
Early on, it was suspected that the homeless population would get hit hard by Covid, but that never happened, and people weren‚Äôt sure why. It was then theorized that it had to do with the amount of time they spend outside and getting their daily dose of Vitamin D, which has history as treatment for flu and colds.

Yes, but the tilt of the earth toward the sun in the summer allows the rays to travel a shorter path through the atmosphere and ozone so less of the UV is filtered out by the time it reaches the ground.

What do you mean with my logic? We have a vaccine for influenza you chimp, we dont have a stable treatment for covid yet. see; exponential vs linear growth

Also nice false equivalence, cigarette sales behind banned and treating covid is a completely different argument. Like come on man? Cigarettes are literally your choice, you arent forced to take them.

They literally banned positive campaigns for cigs and all I see are negative campaigns, warning labels on the packages etc. Not only that but they are banned everywhere from smoking inside and you can only really do it outside in secluded areas. ITS. YOUR. CHOICE.

Come on man, use your brain and stop arguing like a fucking robot.
I do, it‚Äôs a problem I love arguing people. I got nothing against ya homie ur prob a chill person prob is we‚Äôre both petty. Hopefully u r right and Biden is good, if he is I will be happy. ‚úåÔ∏è

The Democrats don't give a shit about guns.  Pay attention and stop listening to that crap.  You can hunt, trap shoot, pistol shoot all you want.  You don't need assualt rifles by the dozen.

  You are taxed on total gains.  So since you made and lost the same amount you won't have a tax liability on that.  To be fair though I got my degree from the back of a cereal box so I wouldn't suggest taking advice from me.   If you lose money for the whole year you can only write off the 3k but can carry the losses over to the next year.

Twitter has a pretense of ‚Äújournalism‚Äù since people rely on it like news.

At 2% per week (still unrealistic because you‚ÄòLL have some weeks of losses) you can double your account in 9 months.

The Russians hacked your phone. You didn't even know that account existed. You believe in proper risk management and position size with stops so that means it's  impossible that it was you using the account. In fact, you don't even know what the word leverage means. No way they got the wrong person.  If RH has any questions they can speak with the presidents legal team. Worst case scenario they hang up on you - no biggie. 

Let us know the outcome.
Interesting question: if you made like half a million on options but later lose that half a million on options 1 month later, and tax deduction is only up to 3000. Does that you owe the IRS on the taxes of half a million -3k of the profit you made despite no longer having that money?
But... Can't I have a little china stock love???

Really don't think weed growers are the play for this here. Low gross margins, low barriers to entries. Won't touch any of the producers tbh.
Twitter can do what they want.  I dont like censorship but they're free to run their business the way they want and to suffer the consequences,  whatever those are.
Alright I‚Äôve had just about enough of all these people tweeting about how they feel such a huge weight has been lifted off their shoulders, like cmon now that‚Äôs ridiculous. If you‚Äôre seriously walking around stressed out day in and day out about who the president is for 4 straight years, you should work on your mental health instead.

I've personally seen far more "trump make market go wooooosh" than trump hate as well, the sub seemed like they were relying on his victory

When you‚Äôve had a bunch of Lambos, they all start to look the same :)
Ask 1.3 BILLION Chinese people.

Super disappointed in the lack of dumpster diving in this photo now.
Even better they actually make cars
If you could fuck one AOC, ACB, Kamala, Hilary, Pelosi.

Trump is the only President since Carter to not bomb a new country. Now that Trump is on the way out expect Halliburton to make lots of money repairing whatever those bombs blow up. 

BTW Trump still has time. Venezuelans in Florida voted for him so he can have a Christmas surprise for Maduro.
Crying to himself in the toilet.
Somebody who has been very public and honest about his son's battle with drug addiction?

Is NIO going to be NKLA 2.0?
Xpev 150 eow or ban
Exactly. TSLA was once $40... then $100... then $250... then $400... then $1,000... then $1,400....
OP was probably applying for a job there. Goodwill is well known for hiring the mentally disabled
Up pretty good for the year. Hoping these next two weeks give me the final push to walk away from the casino for a long due break.

Similar boat Bro, I had 15 $25 January 2022 Calls back when it was around $12 dollar per share. Sold for a loss when it was going sideways for a while. Would be worth 34k now. Fuck!

Has Nevada finished counting yet?
Ending part of the movie Annihilation where she looks into the alien thing
Then how does he support his wife's boyfriend?
i started with about 80k saved up from my job over the last 3 or so years.
Looking forward to next week. Either my puts pay out, or I get to see a guy eat his own dick.
Always buy more than one contract just in case you do guess right.
Puts on Disney
I thought he preferred the term moon lighting?
They're just a shit show. I truly think ACB won't exist in 2 years. They lost 5 billion Canadian dollars this year, like 3.5 billion USD! The market cap is 1.2B. It isn't even close to sustainable.
Where did you get 270k

Democrats = more lockdowns. More covid means more lockdowns. Dems take covid more seriously
Lulz you‚Äôre a clown
this guy is good. I honestly feel healed and happy today. Last 4 years were so evil and shitty.
The sun doesn‚Äôt change in intensity as the earth moves. In fact, in the winter for the northern hemisphere, the sun is closer than it is in our summer.
The arrogance of "Bulls" is always their undoing.  Bears suffer for a long time waiting for markets to turn but they make a killing when it does.  There is a vested interest markets to be pumped, shady, exaggerated, etc.  As long as stocks are going up there's always a sucker around willing to buy any donkey momentum stock.  The big big stocks HAVE to stay up so they are manipulated greatly.  Apple can't fall because so many funds and retail investors own Apple. If Apple tanks, markets tank, funds tank, they won't get their bonuses so they never let Apple tank.  It is what it is.   Don't fight it ride it but don't act like it's some secrets of the universe shit.
Biden to be the guy to kick mango out and save us. At age 78. What an absolute madman. Epic.

Haven‚Äôt nutted since Oct 31st. By the end of the month, my balls gonna be yuge like the Charging Bull statue. ü•úüêÇ
100% purely to get a rise out of you. I mean you keep coming back too afterall. Maybe we should just hug and make up.
Catch WSB protests at the Fed when this happens
He already called 200k cases per day on the way

Ask God
Anyone else a tad worried about twitter just casually perma-banning people more frequently? Even saying trump is no longer ‚Äòprotected‚Äô after election.
Spider verse or lego movie
Great for these upcoming new clear winter days
BABA 400 end of week

What if....the Trump Organization paid Jeffrey Epstein money and that‚Äôs what New York is looking into

If you are talking about Harris, she's just gonna do whatever she thinks is going to be popular.
Dont need to know what they are merging with, there will be some hype to pump the price. Im up 6% already, what makes you so unsure?

> Trump suggests he'll leave the U.S. if he loses to Biden

> ‚ÄúCould you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I gonna do? I'm gonna say: 'I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics.' I'm not gonna feel so good. Maybe I'll have to leave the country ‚Äî I don't know."
RIP
Where were you when üêª were üíÄ. Nothing can be thrown at this market except maybe a bit of COVID.  The market is free to roam into the wild uncontested and unfazed. It‚Äôs so goddamn beautiful.
