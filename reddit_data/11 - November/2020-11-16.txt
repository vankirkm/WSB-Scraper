Yo I was on the 3rd date with this chick and she invited me over to watch a movie and right as we start the movie my stomach starts grumbling and I'm like "oh I'm just hungry...haha lemme get some of this pizza" trying not to kill the mood. Then my fucking stomach starts grumbling WHILE IM EATING and I'm like fuckkk...I take my glass of water and "accidentally" pour some water on myself and run to the bathroom to wipe it off as an excuse and take one of the biggest shits I've ever taken. We're talking massive like Nagasaki level dump and guess what??? That shit gets fucking STUCK and won't go downnnn the fucking toilet. Her toilet bowl hole was so fuckijg small dude and I didnt even notice. I would have broken my shit into smaller pieces with butthole pump and dump action if I had seen how small it was but i didn't and now that giant dump was just poking its head out of the water straight CHILLING. I flush twice and my shit isn't budging and I'm like "fuck I can't tell her this is embarrassing af and would 100% kill the mood". So I don't tell her and pretend it didn't happen then we get our mojo going and after the act she goes to the bathroom to wash up and comes back laughing at me. Doesnr even say anything...just laughs at me and I start laughing too. Thankfully she is mad chill and just took it as a funny story but goddamn I was losing my shit internally thinking I would never be able to see this girl again. We broke up a few months later but that story still sticks. I always shit before the date now. Lesson learned

Been waiting for reassurance before purchasing a similar put in MRNA. I think MRNA is dog shit... CEO always dumping shares at the top, they have never produced a real vaccine, etc etc. Would never take a vaccine from that shit ass company.

Because literally every S&P500 index fund or etf, will now have to buy Tesla at a weighting of roughly 1% of the overall portfolio. That‚Äôs around 1% of 11 trillion in assets getting purchased... 10% gain overnight is just the tip of the iceberg.

OP is posting absolute bullshit. Here's some actual science.

The R0 of coronavirus is somewhere around 1.2, maybe it's 2, varies by locale. That means every new infected person infects  1.2-2 people on average. If the R0 drops below 1, the number of cases decline and eventually the pandemic dies off.

So you have a 95% effective drug, and half of people take it. The R0 is now 0.6-1.. odds-on that the virus dies off and it's back to normal life.

The only problems are superspreader events, and if enough people eventually decide not to get vaccinated (assuming it's an annual vaccination). Neither will be issues in the first year.. but people might get lazy in 2-3 years.
Yeah, sell

No, the point that you were making is "these vaccines definitely won't \[save us\]" (title).

You followed this by stating that you are a figure of authority: licensed pharmacist (which you might very well be I'm not contesting that).

Then you outlined some spooky math to support your message. I don't know much about health sciences but I have done many years of physics, engineering and business and if I know one thing about numbers, it's that you can twist them to say whatever you want. 

You finally added your your scary baseless conjecture with the only capitalized text in your post of ONLY SEVEN DAYS.

I'm all for losing money on the NYSE casino but if you are indeed a healthcare professional, it seems unwise to sow doubt about the validity of a vaccine.

Elon once rescued me once too. I was late for work one day and was driving recklessly. I was fearful of being fired you see so I kept swerving around trying to stay ahead of the flow of traffic. I eventually lost control and my car began to spin and slam over the edge of a bridge. 

From hundreds of feet up I could see water approaching fast. I closed my eyes and accepted death. That's when the car stopped. An armored suit had caught my vehicle. I couldn't believe it. It dropped me off back safely.

The suit of armor was just about to take off when I had to know who it was. I asked "could I atleast know my savior?"

Thats when the suits helmet flipped up, revealing Elon Musk and his rugged handsome face. I immediately orgasmed. He kissed me on the cheek and said. "Godspeed".

I never saw him again.

Consider:

>In this trial, researchers had 10 million people wear seat belts and drive for an hour and 10 million people not wear seat belts and drive for an hour.  
>  
>In the seat belt cohort 15 were involved in a collision of which one died. In the no seat belt cohort 13 were involved in a collision of which three of them died. (This data is made-up but approximately accurate based on US car deaths/day.)  
>  
>You might say that was a 66% reduction in fatalities, but you would be wrong. It's ARR is only .0000005.  
>  
>Since NNT is 1/ARR, it would take 5 million seat belt uses to save a life. That is unnecessarily burdensome and costly. The researchers therefore do not consider seat belts a useful intervention.

The OP doesn't consider the short time of the intervention, differences in population susceptibility, or herd immunity effects.
He's saying it needs to be half as effective as these ones. I'm guessing Fauci has done more math than this random internet stranger.

I have to wonder if the vaccine is 0% effective against certain mutations. If it was, then it would proliferate. I guess with the shotgun approach of many vaccines from different sources your more likely to make some serious progress.
i thought it was gonna be a dick pic and thus funny

No no sir, I fully understand what will happen. In the morning, it spikes to $3, I watch it go down to $2.5, then it spikes to $3.4, I panic buy due to FOMO, TSLA goes flat for like 10 minutes, IV cools off, then premium drops to $1.4 within the hour. Instantly down over 50%, I contemplate how it's possible to be this bad at options, sulk the rest of the day.

I guess I'm not used to small caps in that case, because for large companies the phrase "substantial doubts to continue as a going concern" is typically referred to as the kiss of death in accounting. Either way, the company's current liabilities to current assets is insane and equity financing is definitely a necessity for CBAK to stay alive
Yes, but don‚Äôt play the weeklies on BABA. I believe it will bounce at some point, but I wouldn‚Äôt get any calls that expire before January to be safe

Im happy for those of you, you have TSLA calls!

Sir, this is a Taco Bell.
Moderna, no matter what info they have, has never had a vaccine on the market using their technology.  

And he's questioning, rightly so, the standards of how pharma measures their safety.  It is misleading, since everyone reads "90% effective" differently than the actual measurement.  I'd say that's a reasonable issue to bring up.

As far as worries about fastracking vaccinations and having trust issues with biotech-- just look at the 1976 swine flu vaccination fiasco.

Good job
Just like shooting fish in a barrel. Similar to SPY calls, sorry OP. Thanks for breaking this down though, are you familiar with ring vaccination? That could in theory significantly increase the impact of vaccination when combined with contact tracing. Although I wonder how the vaccines would perform in people with varying real world exposure.

Thanks daddy
Qehn it drop another 2 to 4 %
I think people will still definitely buy the share because it's basically 'guaranteed' return of $10 per share right? If I had mkre spare money, I definitely would. And this might drive the price up until the point. But I dont see the upwards trend continuing after the dividend date. Some people might even cash out straight after the dividend
Have fun bud. I'd like to thank you for the $$$ or should I say $ cause you broke.
I bought 2 of those 430c on Friday. I was betting on SpaceX.
Yup, going to start a bunch if naked TSLA puts like a complete retard. But so far it's the only thing that worked for me, lol.
What was your day job?
How‚Äôd you lose it
I want to find and get in on trades like those, missing them sucks.
what downtrend
Guys I YOLO 50K into TSLA for avg $410 last week  


Selling tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Legitimately impressive. You belong here for sure.
Fucking cbat was looking at it over the weekend had 1k I was going to throw at it, come today I completely forget and decide to throw it at solo,aryo and fcel and them after done spending I realise like a retard. Then I see it blowing up and I'm like oh yeah that's what I was goinf to do.
Yolo at open it's only gonna rocket from here till dec 21
XLE is just Exxon and Chevron nowadays anyways, why the double dip
Good point, but I believe their charts still look very bullish long term(or hope so lol). It seems like you got a game plan I would stick with it
Literally not how it happens at all.  Pence presides over the certification process as President of the Senate.  Biden certified Trump in '12 over dem objections.

Okay so I'm really tired and I want to read this. Dont delete this. Ive been curious about the toplines.
Nice move! Time to fuck all the value trade chasers
No this is an order I plan to purchase in the AM. Current price is around $0.4, I assume that'll spike to $2+ tomorrow. Hoping I can flip it for $4-5 if Tesla just keeps going up.
Not as good as it is for garliccoin
I got in at $7 and had to settle on a car down payment

If you believe in the future of the company, then no. Current market cap is only 750m, pretty sure if this company turns out to be a huge success it'll be worth many billions. (Nio for example is worth 60B atm)

Next episode how to retire at 21 by just yoloing your salary for that one year.
Answered your own question!
but who do the whistleblowers report to?  Big Pharma's lobbying power of the government is more than the GDP of many small nations.  2nd, the media doesn't care.  Ever see those ridiculous biopharma commericals on tv which list all those crazy side effects and wonder how could anyone be persuaded?  It's not about the information in the commercial--it's that those commercials make up at least 50% of the budget of a lot of those news outlets.  (disregarding the fact that many people on their board, or even Rupert Murdoch's corp has big investments in pharma).  In the end, the spin machine is so effective, that anyone who questions the efficacy of a vaccine are automatically dispatched as crazy anti-science and sent to the Inquisition.  Unfortunately, good science is about questioning and doubting and stripping to see what weakness there is in a theory or method.

so, yeah, a lot of info out there for pause, but it won't be addressed.
$2 for manufacturing. That‚Äôs great. It also has to be shipped and stored at a ridiculous temperature. Don‚Äôt forget administration costs. Oh and the vaccine is 2 doses. Sure the active ingredient is cheap, but the money is in all the auxiliary requirements.
... but it still literally cut the probability of contracting covid by 90%.  

These numbers are normal for any disease with low incidence.

Your analysis is basically arguing that if 1/100 people die in a car accident each year, and you wear a seatbelt and your odds drop to 1/1000 (10 fold reduction), then seatbelts don‚Äôt really work because it only reduced your risk of dying by 0.9%!

That's what you're saying now though, by using the .43% number as the comparison. That number is only where it is because we've all been locked up for months. They did the math right and the vaccine is 90% effective. That's how control groups work.
i‚Äôm thinking of putting in an order rn of .6 for sum 550 lottos y‚Äôall think they‚Äôll hit

This is why the spanish flu no longer exists and no one cares about swine flu anymore. Like 3 years from now it will be like 10x less deadly and the lockdowns will be pointless.

My ZM calls got shat on because of this shit? Shit better pump to the moon this week
I have like 3 drinks a month, it's not a real problem. Without getting too deep I learned as a child the horror that alcohol can cause. I have these thoughts every night before bed. I just don't usually ask or mention them until I've opened up a little bit. I am learning Japanese though, have been for 3 years :)
PLTR is all of my portfolio right now
Soooo... when does PLTR üöÄüöÄ??
Anyone think Cramer is scared that Trump takes his time slot?
Does this song have a name? Please share
I think that is potential student loan forgiveness

Thats the entire point. IV is so insane that It‚Äôll need to collapse like 15-16% for me to lose any money at it‚Äôs current state
Sell weekly calls. You hit the jackpot here, man. You could probably sell $100 OTM for a couple grand per week.

I have some scared 11/20 $12c that need to get sold this week.
Meh, I‚Äôm already sitting on 41p that I sold. Rolling it up to a 44p will make my breakeven be around the $40 range. I can‚Äôt see the stock cratering the 15-16% needed for me to actually lose anything. In reality it will be more then 15-16% since im not rolling it up that high unless the trend is looking good in the am.

Worst case scenario, I get assigned NIO at a near 10% discount from where it was trading.
Explain like I'm retarded

I really want to know who the dickhead/s is/are downvoting every comment so I can piss in his/her/their mouth/s
Never doubt TSLA retard strength. Buy at open or if you must, wait 15 minutes. If there is a dump and V shape, it‚Äôs going to be then.

Half of WSB is buying Weekly Calls at 9:30am. Tsla $800 EOY. Get on the hype train, it's just getting moving.
I'm trading as a bull because that's what the market is doing. At the same time, there's gonna be a hard dip, and it's stupid not to have a hedge. Don't get this you're either a bull or a bear bullshit, why not play on both teams but without any stupid theta gang shit.
Are we fomoing into TSLA FD's at open or what boys
Show me a pay stub for $70k. I‚Äôll call my boss, quit my job and come work for you.

The info is public. He is just running the numbers for you/us to understand why it's not "great news".

Pfizer and others report on relative risk, which means nothing to the lay people but it's basically cherry picking your best statistic so it wows the plebs. All people see is a high % and assume it's great.
That‚Äôs absolutely insane. Literally no indication that anything was gonna happen for Tesla.

This is what we come to WSB to see. If it‚Äôs not massive loss porn, it‚Äôs the once in a lifetime FD lotto gains that a thousand other retards on here are going to blow up their accounts trying to replicate. 

Respect
They're stupidly green every day for almost two weeks you thought it would last forever?
Workhorse has managed to generate a decent amount of hype and their vehicles look like rust buckets fresh off the factory floor lol.
Can one of you retard tell me or guide me to the right place to learn about options trading.
I see you all retards on this sub yolo‚Äôing on your portfolio. Might want to learn what is options.
I just only buy stocks and keep it in my tfsa. Nothing much, this sounds a but interesting.
Nios making large gains for me
Fack, I just realized CBAT has been on my energy watchlist for a hot minute and I never took action.
Someone call an ambulance but not for NIO

Op may have the expertise on the subject, but they missed one crucial thing. If Trump is determined enough, he can expedite the FDA approval process or throw wrench in and force FDA to approve it if they won't.
The funniest and maybe scariest part of this subreddit is seeing the TSLA 600 eow NIO 80 eow and PLTR 30 eow comments and not knowing if its a meme or not.
I know the cat already made the ‚Äúcall‚Äù, but my silly prediction is SPY will trend lower until next Monday.
I think their is an alternative to a buyout here. Cohen, as a 5% owner, can force a general meeting to dismiss the director if he feels his demands aren‚Äôt being met. Cohen would need 50% of the vote, he personally owns 10% of the vote. The remainder would come from the hedge funds and institutions, a lot of them bought in after Cohen which tells me they trust him more the GameStop. 
Cohen also mentioned a the short position in his letter. When a major vote comes up, institutions call back their shares in order to vote. A sudden call back of over 100% of the shares would surely cause a fucking massive short squeeze.

This thing goes to the supreme court it's gonna be ugly. If the SC rules in favor of Trump we get major civil unrest, not just little riots the market doesn't really care about. Deep deep red. Just saying next couple weeks have some volatility coming. After Dec 14th the game changes
I bought calls last week .... 350%

High as fuck right now. Somebody should analyze the majority of what is retards think for where a stock is moving on every date and match it with the actual price that date had maybe we can find a pattern mathematical formula to to predict a price based on all the retards combined
You never know. This is $TSLA we're talking about, they operate solely on retard strength
I‚Äôm ready to be fucked..
Sometimes I read these threads and feel smart and then I realize I‚Äôm reading one of these threads so....mama lied to me
Not sure how they would have made money with that if SPY is negative tomorrow while TSLA is up lmao
How does it compare to the flu vaccine or other well known vaccines?

Just so that we have a frame of reference. The way you present it, it looks abysmal, but comparing it to, say, the flu vaccine will give everyone a more real life measure of its efficacy.

I'm not doubting your analysis, just not sure how bad it is since I got nothing to compare it to.
Yeah man. I'm to the point where I don't care about anything BUT the dick ratio. Totally get what you're saying.
All of these run-ups from vaccine hypes show how much money is sitting on the sidelines. People are still looking for a reason to throw their money into the market.
Bought some puts today as well. If it keeps going up for a couple of days, will buy more
I was investing in LAC. Made a good run in August. Took my profits and rolled it into bigger things. It dipped back down these days, and looks to be going back up again.

Then yes. Yes my good sir you are correct
No it didn't pump AH

they can't have bought it yet...they have to buy what is in the index and nothing else.  so none of the index trackers can buy a single share until the actual add date in december.  

what's scary is that the above described scenario has a real chance of triggering a crash in the overall index due to how much selling the index funds are going to have to do across all the other member stocks.
This market is a clown show and a house of cards. Shit goes down the moment people cash out for hooker and blow money.

There's plenty of negative catalysts on the horizon. Just off the top of my head: vaccine recall, lockdowns, dementia in chief dying, foreign affair escalation, etc. Boomer stocks should start declaring bankruptcy soon as well.

Job sounds like something you could do in other industries, but just happens to be in the gaming sector. If you are moving to the bay area, the $300k is pretty good. Not sure how senior/experienced you are, but if you also get a chunk of equity on top, then it may be a market comp package. If outside SF, then the money should go further. Ya, not sure why you are asking on here, we are mostly retarded and not helpful. If you have competing offers, that should give you a better answer haha.

How much have you been drinking?
u sold condors because itcwas low iv???
 The S&P doesn't give a damn about NIO. The reason they took so long to include Tesla is two-fold. One, they wanted to see continued profitability after four consecutive quarters. In q3 2020, Tesla reported a fifth quarter of profitability. Two, Tesla is the largest company to have ever been included in the S&P 500 by a long shot. This will have a significant effect on all parties involved - the S&P 500 committee, TSLA, and the many funds tracking the S&P 500. Due to this, deliberation about how to proceed took longer for Tesla than for other companies. 

NIO soaring a week before the announcement was a mere coincidence, just as SpaceX launching four astronauts to the ISS was.
What was the call?
positions or ban
all in. only competition is really Expedia and that company is trash at this point
Not necessarily and I'm expecting him to challenge the election any day now, thought it was gonna be Friday and Monday. It's coming tho. If it's got merit which is almost certain with the electoral college we go red, if it's toothless it'll take a day or 2 to sort it out and we go red

Lol
Cuz CBAT
We drilling tonight üôåüèΩ spy is , should have bought those puts eod smh instead of mid day but hopefully elevator down! Round XX of vaccine pumps y‚Äôall know the drill by now!

Thanks bro. Will try.
Now imagine you had calls instead of sharesüëÄ
As did everyone on here.

Not once will I watch this video without sound and at least twice

What is the point of your irrelevant story? You could have just said I had an unlimited plan, then switched to a capped plan and inevitably ran out of data. Both companies offer unlimited plans.
For real though pos and date
How would I know I can‚Äôt see the option chain until tomorrow open and who knows what it will open at
I bought PUTS BABY. Prob minimal gain due to IV crush unfortunately
Tesla calls at open
They do if you're degenerate enough to trade them.
GL bro.
Dude I've been bullish for months. But I figured I'd try going condors and call spreads this past 2 weeks. Increased my position and widened the spreads and now gonna take on the full loss...
Who cares if business is growing...

I think with how much the market has moved up, it will happen before Christmas. Then the Santa Claus rally will end it.

My puts are Dec 31 or further now.
I don‚Äôt miss it at all - I can pay for my own good dinners and wine.  I am ok with saying fuck you Marriott for all those times you gave me a bullshit upgrade instead of a suite.  I am ok with saying fuck you to delta and their dirty old planes.  I am ok with saying fuck you to everything that has to do with airports.  The random Uber blacks that smell like an armpit.  Never going back to that shit, if anything I realized how much time and life I missed traveling for bullshit meetings.

Maybe I‚Äôll sell one at open and ride the others, i dunno
Where do you live for context?
No long term safety data you should look at Modernas past studies. More than enough safety data. This is a vaccine and therapeutic in a single shot. If you are still doubting safety of these mrna vaccines you have no trust in the United states biotech (Moderna). It needs to stop being called Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine when it‚Äôs actually BioNtech‚Äôs vaccine in EU. Modernas vaccine has been shown to show protection for at least a year just look at their studies.
Naw bruh! Establishing the base. SOLO is ass though stay away, just google it
Seeya at the capital raise which will crush all your calls.
 \-70F because thats how long vaccines should be u know

but yea pfe is shet at making any gains and mrna is a greedy pig company so ur puts might go somewhere...

For the bears here what are you actually expecting to happen to make the market crash?
Green and Red. And you live there?
When is the rug pull gonna happen?

We all know there's gonna be a -5% day coming up with boomer stocks dropping 20-30%, and tech dropping 5-10%.

It'll run slightly red or sideways the remainder of the week before rebounding.

When is this going to happen? Next month? January? When? 

We all know this Pandemic is not going to end until summer or even fall at the earliest.
Got turned on to PLTR in my PHIL420 class Ethics of Big Data and AI. Palantir is and will remain essential for the USG and will change the landscape of big business. I‚Äôm holding till I retire. 

Next stock I‚Äôm investing in will be Rivian. 

If you want to get rich. Do your DD on three companies with growth potential and invest heavily. Diversification is for old people and retards.
what strike?
So is it too late to FOMO into TSLA or we think she'll have legs to run for a bit. Timeframe thinking a couple months past the S&P listing
Why r futures red?
I have been saying it‚Äôs too late to hop on the TSLA bandwagon for like over a year now. I won‚Äôt buy in so you guys can keep making tendies. If I buy it tanks for sure.
We are all Dow Bulls now nice try

Was the only green in my very shitty excuse of a Robinhood account. Happy to have a small amount of shares
Nice share your options story and positions some times around here !
Pretty decent chance of printing imo. Recent news has been bad but likely to rebound once people realize it‚Äôs not as bad as they think. Not to mention based on their revs they are heavily undervalued right now. I picked some up today. Hope they print and we both go to tendie town.

ummm this sounds more like a SPY $275p... not $325p

No many want to GTFO.  Defense/government/aerospace/legacy auto clients do not pay huge amounts. They do alot of direct labor which is the bulk of the costs to them and their contractors.

Got some 05/21 60c nio - hold em through earnings? I'm turning a nice profit already though
I‚Äôm down 35%. I think long term it will go back up.  I‚Äôm just fucking stupid and all in on most plays.  Now my only real option is sell company stock from my espp on computer share to get some quick cash but I would hate to do that.  I refuse to sell for a loss at this point since I‚Äôve been holding since March.
Y‚Äôall playing TSLA tomorrow fr with the high IV?

I actually wrote a thesis about that on here stating that dumb dumbs make more money in a volatile unpredictable market because they don‚Äôt know what they are doing so they get lucky and enter an extremely dangerous trade versus someone that knows what they are doing they wouldn‚Äôt risk going into the same trade because they know the odds of the trade failing. It was longer with more examples but in the end of the day this WSB and we come here to lose money and feed out degenerate gambling addiction. üíâüíµ

If it goes to 50-52$ you still made some money i would sell at open , 
Still a risk, im holding leaps so im not as worried, i doubt it will crash to 40 but thats a risk to thibk about
sure, but when the vast majority of a certain type of people tend to side with one political ideology it makes other people sus of them

Hey real quick, when you say they‚Äôre self driving cars, does that mean someone won‚Äôt be behind the wheel?
Someone will buy 60,000,000,000 dollars worth of TSLA shares within a few weeks. Also most TSLA shareholders plan to hold for long term. The combined situation will lead to huge rally in my view. I already have a very large TSLA position, I plan to add Calls. 

$1B purchase can lead to big rally, let alone $60B.
I‚Äôm holding calls and stock and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea
Imagine thinking a stock with a huge run-up on earnings would keep going up before earnings. STONKS go up!
Why did I buy ZM ours before close

That's solved by a quick tweet "considering doubling the number of shares of Tesla at $420, funding secured".
Good point
Yeah bro.. I was long on Tesla too, was waiting for a better entry for leaps but fuck me right

Just buy Tesla tomorrow without leverage and make the same amount....
CBAT bulls. Just read the financials. The company is listed as a "going concern" which means its pretty close to going bankrupt. BUT if they finance their debt with equity they have a chance. Thoughts?

Feel you dude. I see people buying houses at 25-30 and like how the fuck you have this kind of money lol
No, the point I was making was that the vaccine isn‚Äôt really as effective as it‚Äôs hyped up to be. PFE saying that it‚Äôs 90% effective, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to prevent 90% of deaths. To prevent 90% of deaths in the US, we have to vaccinate 2.7 billion people, which is impossible since there are only 325 million people living here.
hey retards

The truth or falsity of a statement doesn't depend on the political views of the person who says it. It's dumb to discount what scientists say because they tend to be left of centre.

calls on TSLA and calls on the entire EV market
Waiting 1 hour to see what TSLA does tomorrow then getting in the trenches
Been a great year for me. Got my braces off, bought a BMW with the money earned in SPY puts and calls. Trying to get a Yamaha MT-03 for me.

Rich parents for sure

If you want to play with money in a retirement account as to get the tax advantages, it's better to do it in an IRA/Roth IRA. Way more investment options, sadly can only contribute 6,000 a year. I'd try that
Gotcha. Donkey Kong shot up like crazy, I'm not a big fan of all these SPACs. They went from like a 3BB valuation to 13BB. 

I have a bullish bias towards PLTR, but I think it's a good sign that when holders were allowed to sell off up to 20% upon listing but the average sell off was around 13-15%. I do imagine there will be some sell off in February, but it would probably behove some of these long term holders to probably just borrow against their shares, rather than sell off; especially since I'd hope they'd realize their company would be worth much more in the future.
Stay out of the sun, son.

We already had a double bottom. We formed a triple top. Now question is do we rocket or form a quad top
The primary efficacy end point is COVID incidence per 1000 person year EXCLUDING those with COVID positive test up to 7 days after 2nd dose.  In other words, they only start tracking the efficacy after 7 days of inoculation.  It doesn't mean the vaccine only offers 7 days of protection.
Yes. You may be able to ride it down.
lets be real your not saving your YOLOing
Is that it getting repossessed?
$51 billion spread across the S&P 500? That‚Äôs peanuts.

Hey retards...if spy dumps, we‚Äôll have the largest double bottom ever and it‚Äôll shoot up to 500
Just have to buy good puts when VIX is low in this market.

Eventually the bulls get tired. They do it every time. Then the bears come in for their slaughter.
Take it to a RH sub.
I own stocks in two places and today could not have gone better.
Nintendo dip, options on Corsair, TSM earnings play, SNE Christmas play or March earnings, Nike earnings play, ALLY leaps (probably priced in at $33 becareful), DOCU and ZM puts maybe. Docusign belongs at around 180-190. Boomer stocks going up because second vac.
These runs with TSLA usually last at least a couple weeks. Wait for a morning dip maybe 15-30 minutes after open and shoot your shot king.
365!
Why does everyone think ARK invest is a fortune teller company. Yeah bro, she bought fsly when it tanked -500% in one day. Holy shit that takes a lot of big brain to predict
Ok, I might be a degenerate but: It would take 3 billion doses to prevent 240k deaths in a country of 350 million people? Give me a break. Your logic doesnt hold up. If everyone gets vaccinated (and heard immunity for covid is at roughly 60%), gg wp, covid over, you don't need 3B doses. Some people still die, but you couldn't have saved those. Vaccine is good news, market is overvalued, lets get on with our stonk loss.
Then buy the puts! I dare you.

Nio tomorrow: our revenue is 14.7 trillion 

Investors: How many cars did you sell? 

Nio: in China we think of it as our car so even though we sold only one it was more like we sold 1 billion

I'm playing NIO, anytime there is reason not to there is suddenly a reason too. TSLA inclusion in s&p is going to creat massive fomo. I hope solo and plug go up as well.
If you are in it to win it i would suggest calls
You can just type those tickers into market insiders search box instead of google and save yourself a page in between ya know.
Haha, I totally called the weed (sapphire) line.. This is amazing.
Lol. As a single, massive project? funny. To address it, though, the references would need continuity, that is a level of complexity that can't be attained....I did the gladiator scene and nobody watched it cause its 8 mins long.

Fan fiction is dumb.
That‚Äôs a really good point. But we also can‚Äôt infer any vaccine safety or efficacy in those high risk patients either. But I do see what your saying.
Welcome to the show.
XD And now you're dumb enough to not even comprehend a post half as long as yours. XD
Just got mine for January somehow down 20% today...
Elon didn't blow up the astronauts on launch day, so this is a congratulatory gesture from the S&P 500 committee. My reason is just as valid as yours.
Even if you did nothing but hold what you had before the virus you would be up. What did you do?!
I have 250 shares in NIO at $50 so short term I‚Äôm scared... might exit if we close tm like at 55 or 54ish and reenter after earnings (if it drops lol)

I think most about the mental benefits in this decision. Student loans have more or less ran my life the last 3.5 years. Dictating where I can live, who I can live with (roommates or myself), do I have the finances to support a relationship to pursue to start a family and have emergency funds in case something happens to the people I love most, etc. You're right. The mental benefits would bring more happiness / satisfaction to my life overall than more gains. More gains only means a nicer car maybe. No loans means freedom.
I remember that shit. sucks man... hope it shoots up so you have minimal loss or break even.
I will entertain this
That's what I'm hoping for
I own a 3/19/21 $800 and a 1/15/21 $560 like an asshole
Yeah... hold but those are gone lol. Sell deep puts?

I‚Äôm basically a permabull. I don‚Äôt understand how bears can exist. Even if the market is being irrational, there is no way to predict when a correction will occur and in the mean time you can lose all your money.
As a bull I‚Äôm just laughing too.... all the way to the bank
The "reopening" trade is a sham. It's just an excuse for Wall Street to put other people's money to work into FY end. The cash on the sidelines is already heavy into mega tech and consumer discretionary, so they cant add there. So they marketing and sales teams are pumping the "reopening" trade  to lure the money into the market, pump up prices before year end  and solidifying fat bonuses
Lmao
A lot. Like maybe just enough to erase all the lotto tickets you buy on tsla just incase this ever happens. Basically hitting a $1k scratcher just to keep you buying them hoping to make money off of them long term üòÇüëå

Was casually checking the TSLA option chain today and saw IV was at 50% or something. Was about to throw my last 7k in there as YOLO.

Now I don't want to open RH and WSB tomorrow. RIP me.
That 6k is gonna be worth over 100k tomorrow. Congrats bro.

Ngl I lost faith but when I woke up this morning around 9 I nearly shit myself. Was 75 contracts deep.
After checking every 20 minutes I finally seen a slight move in futures finally
Those are warrants idk why the broker display it that way either
I bought Nio beginning of the year at $4. but only 5 shares lol. Li I bought 10 at $33. The one I'm heavy in is XPEV at $22. If I were you, I'd just hang on to them long term. I have a feeling any of these 3 can do the same shit that Tesla did. Just keep doubling for no reason.
I use TD because I‚Äôm not a broke college student. GL tomorrow.

All news about NKLA are about lawsuits against it. But futures are green as the fields of Ngorongoro. That's why you can't predict the market.
Yes, historically it dips as much or slightly more than the special dividend amount. Earnings will be reported on the 2nd as well which is the record date. I'd rather wait out the earning and enter a position again after the earnings.
The longer the base and more years not turning profit to expand business. The higher the peak. Roll out 27 month leaps every 18 months until it explodes for max tendies.

You sound jelly.
You're not factoring in the makeup of the participants in the trial vs. those that are dying from COVID.  The death rate is way, way higher in elderly, etc. and the participants in the trial were the least at-risk for death.  The 240k deaths and just doing straight math doesn't work.  

Prevention of cases in elderly and at-risk populations will greatly reduce the death rate.  Healthy 18 year old kids are 99.999% recovery rates. 

So yeah, people will still get COVID, but if we protect the at-risk population quickly with vaccination the death rate should decline dramatically.

Nah, I'm pretty sure it was because Elon didn't blow up the astronauts on launch day, so this is a congratulatory gesture from the S&P 500 committee. (Seriously though, that kid is retarded)
My FD puts agree
Automat used to get like 30+ awards even close to 100 sometimes lol
Spy
Elon only said that because Tesla didn't productized his inventions or well care to as a priority. Edison did. Other than that Elon prefers Tesla. Tesla just cares to invent things for the sake of doing so versus for money. If he did it for money, Tesla could have been the wealthiest man in history.  He probably died with so many inventions he never wrote down.
I bought those back last week but I blew up my account 50% today and my last 15k are on spy puts I bought at 360... then spy shot up in the last five minutes

I bought some TGT calls. Depends on tomorrow actions but I will sell Wednesday if it runs up after WMT's earnings on Tuesday or hold if it dips after disappointing WMT's earnings. I think TGT will crush earnings but exit timing will be crucial for call options here.
55c 11/27 should I hold if I'm ITM before close?

Most recent was in Feb of this year. Prior to that the income level was sub $80k. I started with absolutely nothing. $3k POS car, not enough clothes for a full week of work without wearing something twice, no family/friends where I moved to for the job... Rented cheap rooms in a house with complete strangers the whole time. I'm doing what I have to do to get where I want to be and not complaining about it.

They announced a new offering after the pump last week, so I don't know if they'll do it again - but cases are rising which could cause the CDC to put some pressure on the industry. I expect a pullback tomorrow, I just hope it doesn't wipe out my gains :(
You honestly think anyone on here has ever held a stock long enough to notice dividends?
So the only true value is brilliance? That's pretty daft man. There's value in any level of knowledge/experience when it comes to software development. The key is to steer it correctly and know how to capitalize on it. Not every electrical engineer is Tesla, and if they all were, there would be no Tesla. Also, if one were a genius, chances are they would be fully aware of it and not look for a code monkey job at xyz corp.

sold 2 cover calls on TSLA right before close, pray for me. fuck this game
I‚Äôm too poor
Sir, this is a casino
It kind of takes the mystery away from investing though... bad movie
XPEV? XPilot maybe? That's not the point though. The point is this is good news for all the China EV companies. They got the Howard Marks stamp of approval. So I expect to see some crazy parabolic Tesla style movement to the upside for Nio, Li, and Xpeng. So roll the dice, pick your China EV, and watch it moon lol.
Yes

NIO is pumping right now and I sold at pre-market this morning at the low low. Yeah I got some gains but this shorter NIO news is bull poop.

I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. Charlie Munger is on the board of COSTCO and the board just approved this dividend. I am very conflicted here. I'm not sure why Berkshire exited Costco. For few months now, I expected to read that Berkshire increased its stake in COSTCO ... this is definitely negative news but I'm not sure how much of an impact it will have.

SOLO went up 69% in the last 7 days with 63 employees.  Think they convert regular cars to EVs or something, stock is cheaper than their IPO from August 2018.  Something happening over there in Canada, eh?

PLTR has a lockup that ends in February. It is likely many want to sell their shares especially since they been in it for up to 17 years. DKNG dumped hard when its lock up was released.
You can always hope. Godspeed

Show us your butt dude.
damn which penny shitstock.
this is super gay you don't belong here, look at spy the past month you retard ur getting blown the fuck out
Godspeed! Hope your December calls get ITM
You bought 35c with 2 months to expiry for $1400? You don‚Äôt belong here man. That‚Äôs way too safe üòÇ you can use an options profit calculator to see what it‚Äôs worth on each day to expiry at any value. It‚Äôs a rough estimate that doesn‚Äôt factor in changes to Greeks and IV, just uses the current calculation for the price rn. But it‚Äôs close enough to see where you‚Äôd like to take profit and such. Bye mooning isn‚Äôt 50. We‚Äôre gonna get there probably before market open. Mooning would be 60+ before market close. Anything above 60 I say sell atleast half before close. Best of luck!
S&P500, nationally hyped space docking[*](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=docking), all we need is ~~another blatant lie~~ a good Elon tweet and TSLA fanbois are sending us to 650 by Friday.
[deleted]
If you hold you should be fine
The space and recliners make a pretty big difference
Lmao exactly what I was going for
Just going to do some ad-hoc math here....

Let us take  **Apache Corporation** which is ranked #498. Keep in mind the S&P 500 is market cap weighted. As a percentage, this makes up 0.012972% of the S&P 500.

SPY, the largest S&P 500 ETF, is $277.59B in assets. That means Apache Corporation makes up $36M of the SPY ETF.

The average trading volume of Apache Corporation is 11,232,725. The stock is priced $11.20, so that makes on average around $125M of this stock is traded in a single day.

The $36M isn't going to make a difference over the weekly $625M in trading. Sure, there are other ETFs that track the S&P 500, but hopefully you get the point. I wouldn't be surprised if some large financial institution is already providing liquidity when the stock is removed to hamper any possible effects.

The reason TSLA mucks up the S&P 500 is because it's going from 0% weighting to around 1.5% weight. Most stocks only make a minor difference as they're added/removed. This is certainly an exception.

I'm not an expert but these strategies need napkin math.

It‚Äôs bittersweet. Like it would be nice to be barely assigned hardly above 24.5 but then it would be nice for the calls to expire worthless at like 24-24.49
There's no fucking way this doesn't hit $500...by 530am.
I‚Äôm sure if I went to the corner, I‚Äôd get filled for 0.99. Wink wink

You won‚Äôt do it so stop

sdk your broker to go all in when IV is the highest after the morning pump. I swear we could see 50% losses in a minute if we get 2 deltas out on the weeklies. Thats what ill be aiming for, I know why im here
I lost all respect for Elon when he said he prefers Edison over Tesla. Tells you everything you need to know about the guy. He‚Äôs not an inventor, he‚Äôs a businessman. He named his company Tesla because he knew all the autists would fall for it and give him their money.

Asking for a retard
Would it be retarded to grab NKLA calls tomorrow for the sympathy play?
Nice! I recommend dumping half of them at open and the other half EOD in case it runs even more during the day. Just make sure you don't use a market order to sell in the morning cause MMs could fuck you over. Use a limit order

I feel pretty good about XPEV. Oaktree Capital Management reports in their 13F that they've taken a stake in XPEV in Q3.
Why doesn‚Äôt everyone do what?
I don‚Äôt know whether I‚Äôm relieved or disappointed.
Impossible. By nature of its clientele being legacy companies. Government/defense/aerospace/automotive(non-ev). These are the least profitable industries and the slowest to move. Much of the everything here is human manpower versus automation.
The emptiest barrels are also the loudest. Not all of us fucked with NIO.

If you want a secret? Get a fucking security clearance. Then work at Microsoft/google/Amazon (google unsure but I‚Äôm looking into it). 

- niche spot = barely any competition for your job. Cruise control. 

- less people = easier to move up and get promoted. 

- every couple years roll out offers from other companies and hold your company by the balls to wayyyy overpay you. I‚Äôm talking 160k base for sde2 at Microsoft, which is what my friend is making. He‚Äôs 24. 

- bonus after bonus. My current bonus: 25% of base salary for holding the clearance. 15% on top of that to work a 2-10pm shift twice a week for customer work.

PLTR is really the next MEME stock, could go 60 by EOY and 250+ by EOY 2021
Sell your near term calls soon but hold onto your December calls for at least a couple days. TSLA could see ATHs very soon. You gotta get rid of those 11/20 calls cause theta is gonna be eating the premium of those calls so damn quick.

I thought the point of vaccines is to hurry up herd immunity.  Since the virus has been relatively stable (mutations) the vaccine + already immune will get R0 less than 1,  less than 1 means virus is done and SPY moons.  Are you saying the vaccine will not increase immunity in the population?

I feel like you are missing the key point though. Changing the spread from 0.4 to 0.04 means less people are giving it out. It significant lowers transmission rates. Sort of a herd immunity type thing...
good, now i can beat the traffic every time
Smart move is to play both.   Tesla is American S&P should be a safe investment.  Nio is a wild ride with unknown potential.   But both have potentially insane market caps in the next few years.

EVEN FURTHER LIKE MARS. ESPECIALLY EV SECTOR
The Weakest Link formula seems broken once you get to the final 3.
I've been all in on CCL since late april, and I am conflicted about the stock.


On one hand, you still should have the pump for when the Oxford vaccine gets released (should be this month maybe), and after the high-risk population is vaccinated then the mortality and hospitality rate should drop like a rock, so hopefully we reopen sooner (and companies report historical booking rates.)


On the other hand, they may have to dilute shareholders even more to last a couple more months, and Biden's CDC might be more aggressive towards cruise companies...


Hopefully the reopening hype can bring us back to the June-pump levels as news comes out, I will probably hold until May so I pay less in taxes.
The opportunity to become millionaires was today.

Options contracts are going to have insane premiums either way. Theta gang going to feast.

If TSLA opens tomorrow at 460 I bet a 400 put or 550c for 11/20 will be at least 1k.

Nah brah what truly matters is if you make enough tendies to retire early
We‚Äôre going to war.
nope wsb will be dumping nio for tsla. they will be coming back home to papa musk
yeah, I think it's because Elon got covid and the committee felt sorry for him. you know, at least use your autistic imagination to make up something entertaining.

Nice. Going to pick up some January calls. Been so focus on what‚Äôs going on with tech that I forget that the moves are in value plays.
Looks like the GA runoff will be the most important election. I have a feeling Biden is praying the Dems lose (which they likely will). This will give him a firewall against the ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù.
Thursday night it is
Nope,want a recount.
I‚Äôm not educated on the matter, but do they really allow 17 year olds with no credit history or jobs, take out potentially 6 figure loans, without a co-signer? If so, then that‚Äôs fucking retarded. If not, then it‚Äôs on the parents for being financially irresponsible. This country is a mess regardless. It‚Äôs almost like they do this shit on purpose to create a system of perpetual welfare and wage slavery. We‚Äôre a society of braindead zombies, essentially. Consuming is all we know how to do.
lol each one of us matter
Oh, I‚Äôve charged it many times today

Nice moves. Yeah I typically do the same but have over 1k shares in NIO too so very interested in their movement :)
Will SPCE continue to grow during the week?
Prolly depends a lot on what school you went to/your circle of friends. I literally have friends with biology majors that are like...tech PMs pulling 150k+. I don't agree with the other poster at all. It's not easy but it's not thaaat hard either IMO.
the first half hit hard, the second half is still a work in progress
Nope. Just the quarterly cleansing. Seriously, every fucking time something catches fire like that we lose a shitload of people when it inevitably burns to the ground.

What's the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial though and how applicable is it to the real world population? E.g. I think their label is for 16-65 year olds, but we all know thst the elderly are much more at risk. Not sure if obese, diabetics etc were allowed on the trial.

I don't know but good job on keeping your battery above 50%.
So this guy does online dog food and now he is a video game savant right
So what you're saying is instead of puts on these potential "losers" we should buy calls because they'll moon due to buyouts? I love it. I'M FUCKING IN.

it's definitely a leg and not their whole position yeah but like...what the actual fuck kind of a leg is that. 20p? Even 100p is hard to fathom. You have to figure if you're in a situation where you're going to make money on TSLA 20p 12/18s, the entire world is probably fucked. It's a hedge against like Ragnorak because what the fuck else is going to have TSLA 20p not be worthless

Got a free dessert for the kids actually.
Damn, tesla 450 weekly expirings wouldve been nice
I bought calls that I plan to sell towards the end of the day tomorrow or as soon as the gains slow/stop. I love earnings. Buy a week or two before. Ride the wave up. Then sell right before earnings so it doesn't matter what happens after.
break even is 457. u are def deep ITM. sell before close to lock it in.
Pretty sure that means 30,000 Trillion.
For the past month. Every Friday is a sale for nio. So best safe is sell before Friday.
Insinuating gas car companies haven‚Äôt been trying to penetrate the EV market for years. Every major maker is competing

Covered? Hopes so.
News been out for few days
Just imagine all the ETF that have to purchase Tesla and watch it moon as Retailers buy up the shares while ETF have to wait until it actually joins.

The only thing that is going to hold it back is large investors that have regulations on their holding limits. I.e. As Tesla moons some might have to sell from policies like no more than 30% can be in a single company.
I got the $50. I was loaded with 42.5s but sold too early.

Of course it is. Every fucktard thinks that getting an engineering or cs degree will net‚Äôem a job. Shit is changing,  no one gives a fuck anymore unless you are a genius.
Why didn't we do this sooner
I'm all cash at the moment... But this is going to be fun watching everybody cash out as fast as possible from nio and run to Tesla.... Everybody's going to try and get on the train before the mega legendary short squeeze.... Oddly enough this catalyst just might make Andrew left's prediction accurate which will be confirmation bias.
haven‚Äôt heard any PLTR talk in a minute
Highly recommend talking to a doctor about your sobriety. There's a lot out there to help with avoiding alcohol and also with the effects of getting sober. 

Big congratulations, but keep that shit up. Don't let yourself slip, work your ass off and you'll reap the rewards.

I'll be 3 years sober on Jan. 2nd. It gets easier as time passes. I've managed to turn my life around due to my sobriety. I'd probably be dead by now if I hadn't stopped drinking and doing drugs. Shit's absolutely life-changing.

Why is this marked shitpost?
Here was my typical trade during my huge run. Fab trading at 120. Buy 500 weekly 115 calls for 6 bucks and change. Try to catch a 3-5 buck move. Sometimes if there was a nice dip the week before and I thought there was more room to run, I‚Äôd roll the weeklies into the following week. 

This style was great after a dip in markets when fear was high and there were margin calls raining down. I learned to have Diamond hands after years of doing this and my most profitable trades were when everyone was panic selling. I‚Äôm a contrarian by nature. 

Examples. 

Brexit gap down panic. Buy the dip. 

Donald trump elected. Bought huge that morning and rolled my options into January and made bank into the consensus that trump will crash markets. 

2017 - Amazon taking over retail. Brick and mortar dying. Target hit 40. Macy‚Äôs hit 18. I went all in yolo and made 5 million when Macy‚Äôs went to 40 after horrible earnings print. 

2020. COVID hits. I was still wounded from blowing up 8 million account but I smelled the familiar scent of opportunity when  panic hit the market. I played COVID recovery stocks the whole time. It finally printed these last two weeks but in hindsight I realize I like dumpster diving too much. I probably would‚Äôve made 10 million if I just bought apple cals at 220 and kept rolling them up. Or pton or Tesla. On and on.
I work for one of the meme stocks and I won't see that much money in my life. 

If I had 3.5mil I'd buy a bar/house and semi retire to live off the interest.

It is $FAGMAN and I joined before covid so that might be why. But yeah I joined as a new grad in February and instantly deposited my starting bonus in March with covid. Turned the 30k into like 90k but then lost most of it in April and just pocketed like 10k at the end

your blood/oxygen will be fine I am sure of that.
Tech was the future before Covid, Tech is still the future after Covid.  The market in general may be at AT highs.  But if you look at specific sectors it is still recovering.  Don't fight the tape, to much pressure from the fed,.  320 wont happen ever again.

I'm balls-deep in F. I'm pretty diversified, but I own more shares of F than anything else.

Money is cheap to borrow. How much more you need to know holmes?

Honestly who would question if you said he assaulted your son (which he did), and you had to kill him out of defense? No jury would prosecute that.
NIO was already in a scary spot so he could do that. 10% everyday for 2 weeks, of course there was going to be a correction at some point. 

Idk if he can do that to Tesla, people trust Elon more than him.
For real.  Came out of nowhere while everyone was busy bag holding NIO.  I got fucked so hard by Battery Day I wouldn‚Äôt have dreamed of buying more TSLA calls until now but there‚Äôs no way I can sit this out, I‚Äôve got some revenge trading to do.
16 years in the industry and pretty much burned out, may retire from tech soon, had enough
game developers make that much? I thought people in that industry got paid and treated like crap cuz it's "cool" to work there
Let him enjoy his last few weeks of being relevant.
All the boomers in my work were PISSED that they couldn't go on holiday/vacation. They didn't give af about the virus.
Yea, I think the dump is soon. This TSLA S&P shit will be the tip of the euphoric iceberg. Going to look into opening a lengthy IWM or SPY put position here soon.
Nice

Can we fucken stop the programming fad bullshit? Software engineers have glutted the market and unless you have a degree from MIT you‚Äôll be flipping hamburgers. No you can‚Äôt code. No we don‚Äôt want you . And no your CS degree doesn‚Äôt standout anymore.
Dread
Total shutdown is as terrible an idea as selling TSLA naked calls.

What the officials in some states are talking right now is doing a more targeted shutdown.
Probably not a ton of upside by then but not much risk either
How do you make food without going shopping?
TSLA gonna pop the bubble, all the gay bears are giving up
Tesla to 650$ Nio$ to 130 Haters would say im delusional bears are fuk
I followed your advice a year ago at 47k. You told me to apply for tier two options. I‚Äôm at 205k now. Woke up to a 20k gain one night when I shorted oil futures. Thank you.
The inclusion on the S&P involves so many passive funds allocating assets to what amounts to roughly 20% of TSLA's float.  These funds buy and hold so essentially the passive fund addition alone is akin to something like a $50b buyback
Da faq are futures doing? Are futures asleep??
Pretty much! I think of all those it‚Äôs largely the bark/leaves that unethical people were using as ‚Äòkava‚Äô during its last popularity boom to make more money/meet demand that caused the issue. They‚Äôre very toxic.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important to go with a reputable vendor vs. random tinctures etc from Amazon.
Hope that it'll go up since there's still meat on the bone, sell for a decent but not astronomic gain (short of a miracle). Then TSLA had to be funny and trade sideways for like a month.
Same with the ones worth .05
That's like saying you won't buy Nvidia because they outsource production to TSMC/Samsung. Doesn't really make sense.

Pretty sure NIO owns the blueprints/engineering for their cars, unless you got some source?

Which ones
They will probably make the cancellation of debt taxable, not to mention some non-profit workers already working on 10 years to get loans forgiven. Factor out loans that will go to default. Cancelling 10k student loan debt is a lot cheaper than people think, more likely equal to a 5k stimmy.

Is that a boys toy or a girls toy?
do you know how professionals value companies?

They discount future cash flows into present dollars. Twitter has been beleaguered by revenue / EPS growth issues since it's IPO, but professionals are waking up to the fact that it's revenue / EPS growth will be in existence (and thus added to the DCF, boosting present stock price) for much longer than they previously anticipated, aka not disrupted, even if that revenue growth is capped somewhat by other tools.

twitter will be around for 30+ years because it is effectively earth's public facing telephone, with some opportunities for innovation outside of that core function. Professionals are just now waking up to this belief.

Why should we have to pay taxes to support old dying people in retirement? Why can‚Äôt we all just look at for ourselves and not pay any taxes ever? 

I get your frustration. I got a degree in the construction field and have far less than 50k federal loans, but I‚Äôm all for student loan forgiveness- but more importantly, I want the whole fucking system changed. It‚Äôs stupid as fuck to offer 17 and 18 year olds massive amounts of debt when they hardly comprehend what the fuck they‚Äôre signing or how hard it can actually be to pay that shit back. And don‚Äôt get me started on private loans, those fucking sharks charging interest out the ass it‚Äôs insane. They offer loans like candy to kids- my email inbox is 99.9% loan companies asking me to take out more loans. It needs to be reformed. 

While forgiving 50k is probably too much and honestly unrealistic, something SHOULD happen. Maybe 10k. Why not start with this generation and improve things going forward?
holy shit
Saw on tos biggest option sale was 2 hours before close. 3500x june 15 410c for 70.00 ea, didnt think anything of it lol, probably was a hint of big news, cause thats def a insider trade
But next time i see a big buy like that, probably during earnings, im going all in.
Take that Chinese Musk.

We‚Äôve been pretty much war and ‚Äúconflict‚Äù free under mango‚Äôs reign.
Didn't they issue a ton right after split? This was probably why
Wonder if they caught wind of 'big news about TSLA' but didn't know if it was good or bad. Maybe spent a hell of a lot more on various call strikes above 400, then got those 20p in case the big news was TSLA filing for bankruptcy.

Have to figure if 200k+ is a hedge that they're going to have many, many millions in TSLA calls tomorrow.
Can futures fucking move!??

Why TF are we at all time highs.  Despite the vaccine this economy is far less healthy and robust all around as compared to pre-corona.  Following a nutty 10 year bull run that was due to pullback anyways, plus new lockdowns at the least weakening local economies....  SPY 320 imminent.

True but cities are kinda dead now and will be for a while
So you dumped the shares you were selling calls on??

I'd do poor man's covered calls and see if you can minimize outlay
just get shares. RKT moves slow - but it's a phenomenal company and a great buy for long term

Previous TSLA pattern for 2-3 weeks after news events like this was moon Mon-Wed. Thursday slightly up or flat, then Friday slightly down. Would moon again on Monday after weekend through Wednesday. If it‚Äôs the same pattern this time, you would want to sell your calls Wednesday and buy in again on Friday right before close.
Are you retarded to be making such a low wage? The fuck is wrong with you?

I would just put it into some low risk etfs then
Live oak has been the largest SBA lender for years. Their entire portfolio is high risk industries. Doesn‚Äôt matter if the SBA buys 75% of the risk, when the remaining 25% doesn‚Äôt payoff. Oh. And interest rates aren‚Äôt going anywhere, anytime soon. Most SBA 7as float on WSJ Prime Max spread 275bps (competitive spreads are more like 125-200. 

Also, secondary market for SBA loans has been hammered. Supply boom, squeezing resale margin. 

You want a higher quality SBA/small business lender, look at KeyBank. You get a cheaper stock, less risky portfolio, larger and higher quality dividend to boot. 

What you don‚Äôt get is the peak moonshot you are trying to buy with LOB üòÇ.

We see a 4% pump in past 2 sessions back to ATH, and this bullshit AH session is what the bears can muster.

We are, and it may, but TSLA & NIO will hold up the entire market with the volume they are about to do.

20p on TESLA is not a hedge
Convert it to shitcoin . How many shitcoin?
I strongly feel with NIO CCP backing in developing nations such as Pakistan,  Bangladesh, Nigeria, and others; NIO can setup cheaper production facilities than TSLA driving costs down for poorer nations, and thus demand for NIO. These countries account for much larger populations than developed nations, with GDP growths easily in the double digits. This places NIO very strongly to outgrow TSLA in the long term unless TSLA is willing to step away from their branding as a luxury auto maker.

 
However I agree in the near future NIO and TSLA will likely not be competing with each other and will take market share from ICE makers such as Mercedes. This is a similar to how we see Toyota and Mercedes not competing, however Toyota holds a clearly larger market share in developing nations while Mercedes is more likely to get sales in developed nations (as opposed to developing nations).


Finally as we roll into 2021, Biden's Green Economic Plan could give TSLA‚Äôs battery technology a bigger market as more electricity production goes towards renewable sources. These sources (such as solar and wind) will need larger batteries to store the surplus electricity, which could lead to a new market for TSLA.

Lastly, I have learned a lot about stocks from street-guru and would recommend them to others. They recommended getting into NVDIA long before it took off and I been holding onto them still with solid gains at ~35% increase.
Does NIO's bumpers fall off though?
Based and red pilled
Imagine jerking off to DIX what the fuck is that anyway

Money paid in dividend is money the stock price loses. It's just pure math. If the company "loses" 10$/share, each share is worth 10$ less. That plus or minus the usual fluctuation in price and,most likely, Costco will be down on Dec 2nd. Buying dividends isn't a hack, you won't make money.

Here‚Äôs my two cents on why Tesla and NIO will be giants in there own fields and you can find other analysis on https://street-guru.com

I strongly feel with NIO CCP backing in developing nations such as Pakistan,  Bangladesh, Nigeria, and others; NIO can setup cheaper production facilities than TSLA driving costs down for poorer nations, and thus demand for NIO. These countries account for much larger populations than developed nations, with GDP growths easily in the double digits. This places NIO very strongly to outgrow TSLA in the long term unless TSLA is willing to step away from their branding as a luxury auto maker.

 
However I agree in the near future NIO and TSLA will likely not be competing with each other and will take market share from ICE makers such as Mercedes. This is a similar to how we see Toyota and Mercedes not competing, however Toyota holds a clearly larger market share in developing nations while Mercedes is more likely to get sales in developed nations (as opposed to developing nations).


Finally as we roll into 2021, Biden's Green Economic Plan could give TSLA‚Äôs battery technology a bigger market as more electricity production goes towards renewable sources. These sources (such as solar and wind) will need larger batteries to store the surplus electricity, which could lead to a new market for TSLA.

I think it is 10% within a 5 minute period and they issue a first halt, then time time limit keeps going up every subsequent halt

Or if the company calls ahead and says we are dropping news, there is no time limit depending on what the news is (IIRC). I have seen stocks halted for days/weeks pending news

Just bought tesla 12 contracts with strike price at 465 expiring November 20th... whatdya y‚Äôall think will happen?
Wtf is a channel?  /s
LMFAO
You don't think it's better to wait for a pull back first? Its been reject yesterday on three days and 5 times yesterday. Obviously a large buyer can break through but there seemed to be a large selling wall from 16.00-16.25 that there hasnt been enough buying volume to overcome.
25% is for complete beginners. Unless you're getting 30-35% a month you should just stick to boomer investments like gold and bonds
If you‚Äôre fine holding at 405 why not close out to lock in gain then sell cash secured put at $405
I did some research and the liver toxicity may be due to a myriad factors including overuse, concomitant drug and alcohol use, improper preparation methods, and using the wrong parts of the plant (stems and roots)
I played 75% in weekly options and rest in longer dates options. I generally hold till expiration so usually 5 day holding period.
Jokes on you been holding common since $49 pre split.
Idk man, nio could hit 50-52 by wednesday, and def will sympathy trade with tsla

That‚Äôs the plan !
I‚Äôm selling CSPs on TSLA tomorrow... for two reasons.

1) my 400 shares are going to be called away at $430 on Friday
2) there is going to be some sweet sweet premium jumps
Probably a hedge, not sure what apocalypse they are expecting tho
lmaoo
Spy won't rise. TSLA won't even be a holding in SPY for a while, if it's even chosen so.
There‚Äôs beautiful hardwood under those rugs.
Whats wrong with that though?

> But there's another 6.5 trillion dollars of actively managed funds indexed to the S&P 500. They too will buy & hold TSLA shares, worth about $65b, over 22% of the TSLA free float. Many of them own TSLA already - but most of them don't.

I doubt you'll see "active" funds pile into TSLA early on.  They have gotten a lot of shit for following indices too closely while charging high fees.  The last thing they want to do is buy into something right as it's being added to their benchmark.
Incorrect. No single entity is in control. Human nature prevails over time. History rhymes? You are seeing exceptional divisiveness and muted calls to arms... It's the same kind of stuff that ruins nations and invites revolution and war. Each side further entrenched against the opposite. It is inevitable now
Gonna sale all my nio shares tomorrow. Hoping that I see consolidation around the 35 price point two days after earnings then I'mma load up on nio again.

You spelled PLTR wrong you illiterate fuck
I made the dumbest mistake of my trading career. I'll keep you updated as it unfolds. Basically sold covered calls on BA but sold shares and somehow didn't rebuy the right amount of shares so I ended up -400 when shares were assigned. So now... I'm shorting a stock that's mooning uncontrollably.
Positions?
I did that. Twice. Don‚Äôt be upset man there will be other times. Just buy and hold with stop loss next time.
My qqq puts are fucked?
Well, at least NIO's cars are not currently on fire (yet).

"Inclusion in the SP500 typically brings a rally for a company‚Äôs stock, though the gains don‚Äôt necessarily last long. Stock performance for companies added to the index between 1973 and 2018 usually fell behind the S&P a year after inclusion, according to Ned Davis Research. " - WSJ

Yes, fuck your puts.
Yeah tried csps, tie up to much capital for too little gain, i just try to swing trade with options with little meme stock in between
IMO biggest risk of TSLA inclusion on S&P would be issuance of more shares.  Other than that I see no reason why it wont moon until December 21st inclusion
Twtr the most undervalued stock of our generation, change my mind
I dont think, I read. IV drops after news is out. Close at open because it will fade.
Makes complete logical sense
I won‚Äôt sell a pltr share until it underperforms the market for 1 day ... so I will be holding it the rest of my life

See ya there

Happy cake day.
I've had bad luck with them. Every time I buy, it goes sideways for a couple weeks.
As the years go buy stocks values goes up because more people and different age groups enter the market. With phone apps trading is more accessible then ever. Even though their will be a pullback on tech which could happen after covid is done I dont think a crazy crash can happen. Unless the economy gets so bad that people need emergency funds from their stock accounts.

I don't know. I'd hold the December ones and further out ones. TSLA has a good chance of adding another 100 billion in the next month.
What‚Äôs goin on with them? Lookin prime for leaps.
I don‚Äôt recall any correlation to the TGT but TGT had performed well right after earnings the last two quarters.

there's actually no halt to the upside right?
Post your portfolio, your current positions, and goals.

I have 160k portfolio on Etrade, selling covered calls on MSFT, AMD, NVDA, O, and FB. Currently I have about 15 puts and 6 calls sold throughout the course of last week that I'm gonna close some time this week. Goal -- 185k by the end of this year.

As long as it doesn‚Äôt drop below 440 than it‚Äôs game over with Friday expiration.
Still holding 7 calls, down 2k td. My $420 tsla call should make up for it tho
TSLA inclusion in S&P 500 means TSLA at $500, right?
Should be worth around $400 at open
This exactly. Price cutting is less of the issue - it‚Äôs the status represented by having a Tesla (even if it‚Äôs cheaper) imo.

But I‚Äôm sure NIO is being pushed as a patriotic alternative. Either way they both have a massive market to grow into.
$rope
200 shares here
I think SRAC/W
Its that easy folks 

I think it'll go above 50 but 50 is safe yeah
do u feel like that was a solid cheapshot
How do we get JPow on the ticket in 2024? Theres still time
Let's hope so. I just need to remind myself not to FOMO
Pj traders will jump all over TSLA...right?
genuinely curious...why does being added to the S&P generate this sort of hype?
I have 37k in shares at 272.50 average. Hoping, but no longer expecting, a pop soon.
So I‚Äôm guessing majority of this sub will put their entire portfolio into TSLA calls in hopes of it mooning to $600 (or at least break its ATH) and become the millionaires they dream to be?

Because count me in!!
Probably warrants
Yes. Seriously one of the biggest regrets these past few years, I'm such an idiot.

Dawg what happened to SDC after hours was straight up criminal. Not a smooth criminal at that. There will be an investigation. It was set up for an easy short squeeze and YOU did the right thing. Based on how positive earnings were, as well as guidance, this should end up back at $11-12 by Friday. Avg down tomorrow
When TSLA opens and gets halted to the upside tom this subreddit gonna crash like RH ü§°ü•≥
So TSLA hitting $500 tomorrow or by EOW?
Me too. But I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs enough.
He will probably buy poots.

Because engineering takes away the flexibility and free time that comes with trading.
How long you hanging on?
I hope so but not too fast, i sold covered calls at $25 and don't want to lose my shares like I will with PLTR
Dude it‚Äôs still within range. This could be a catalyst for it to breakout and head to 550-600 in the next month or two
any retard that played snap puts, wasn't here for q1 lol

Luckily mine expires in March. Otherwise $ROPE.
Started in 1999. Graduated college and working in corporate finance. Everyone around me started opening up online accounts and doubling and tripling money with ipos. I started with my savings of 30k and made it up to 120k buying no name dot com iPos on opening day in a month. That‚Äôs how it all started. 

Blew it up in February 2000 and stopped for 4 years. 2004 I told my mom housing is a bubble. You don‚Äôt like your house anyway. Sell it and wait for pop. She lent me 300k from proceeds and my degenerate ass started trading again. 

I know. This all sounds unbelievable but I‚Äôve lived it. I‚Äôve experienced everything you degenerates have time 10. I‚Äôve been suicidal many times. Woken up in cold sweats at 4 am with my entire account in weekly options and futures tanking. I‚Äôve done the whole hookers and blow meme. I‚Äôve bashed my head with my fists for not selling a gap up and seeing my 7 figure gain turn into a loss. 

Here‚Äôs another pearl of wisdom from this lucky survivor. If you have an addictive personality, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be easy to walk away once you hit your goal. 

Trading/gambling is a powerful addiction. Like the worst drug‚Äôs out there. The rush you get when you make a million in a day is something you will crave and crave. 

Sell covered calls for income you say? Get out of here. That‚Äôs like having sex with the hottest women in the world then deciding to give it all up and going on Christian mingle. 

I went to therapy for my addiction. I think it saved me. She help me cash enough out and convert into assets I couldn‚Äôt blow. 

Anyway hope one day if any of you degenerates hit the lotto like me, you‚Äôll remember this and cash out and at least half and  buy something you can‚Äôt blow with click of a finger.
Me? Sort of?
This is what I wanted to do. Anyone explain why I'm dumb?

Thanks all for answering
/whoooosh

But not in the typical sense. I think I just need to take a hundred bucks and do one, win or lose, because I tend to learn by example
You don't think IV will rise?

* More states imposing shutdown (including CA)

Tesla gave me 440% gains. I turned my back on Elon Friday and sold both my Tesla $435 calls after being down $2k. I bought nio calls. This is exactly what I deserve for turning my back on the God that gave me 440% gains. ‚ÄúOh dear Elon, thy graciousness. I turned my back on thee. I ask thou for forgiveness for seeking out a communist stock. I rebuked thee and I do not deserve thine forgiveness‚Äù

Options give you the 'option' to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price, the strike price. If you think the stock price will rise, you buy a call or sell a put, if you think it will fall, you buy a put or sell a call. Thats the simple definition

At that point they‚Äôre only making sure there‚Äôs no reason not to hire you. Do your best and you‚Äôll be fine. Congrats!
Why not both. My job would be 7 am- 3:30 pm leaving me time to buy calls at close when the magic happens anyways.
If she‚Äôs skittish just put it in an IRA. Worst thing you can do is take HER money and possibly lose it. You‚Äôre her dude, not her broker.
A month goes by and everyone just completely forgets about jelqing?
IV crush cause it stays flat the whole day, you know after a \~20% jump lol
Probably not, IWM has smaller companies in it but they are still really big companies. The $15 rate probably hurts smaller, private companies the most, which should be bullish for public companies.
I know. That‚Äôs why I said if TGT moved up on WMT results I will just close out my TGT trade and not risk it.
Take profits and buy NIO, LI or XPEV calls
Sure. Religion was invented for that purpose.
Is water wet?
In both cases, there's the same risk of losing it in the market, so I'm not sure what you are asking. If you're a tax major then you should know the advantages and limitations on the Roth.

She should start a Roth and buy QQQ
You should support Warren Buffet cause he's the one who keeps you employed at DQ
The price will drop by 10 a share after div also options prices will be adjusted by your broker down 10 because of the size of the div
40k to 900k is approximately a 23 bagger

Well buy her something! I bet you expect her to suck your dick
Best sell at open
Jesus Christ why are you worried amzn might be 3600 by then
Any retard thinking about TSLA puts obviously didn‚Äôt play snap a month ago.

get this elliot waver bullshit outa my fuckin face
It'll hit 50 tomorrow
Hide yo kids! Hide yo wife! It's rapin' errbody!
puts make too much sense, but fomo will kick in!
Green by open retard
TSLA trading at $690 in Vietnam!!
Yeah, you'll want that degree if a big opportunity pops up. I got a degree and was a window cleaner for 20 years. Kicked my ass for being a fool and borrowing money for an education.

Funny thing, ended up getting a job in film and telly, now I'm an executive making bank ( go figure). That would never have happened without that "useless" degree.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna lose it all oneday‚Äù fuck you voice of reason
Yes but the risk versus reward proposition is completely skewed. If I told you the best case outcome for your money next several years is a 3-5% return in the market, compared to a worst case of -20% to -30%, with base case of -10%, is that a trade you make? I think not.
Get the fuck out of here tax major. Someone might help if you were honest, but even then unlikely
Depends on if you a true autist or not.
Earnings are in. Credit to stocktwits user James\_Buf, only person I've seen providing DD straight from the source (i.e., Chinese language material) - 

> Earnings Report was unbelievable!! Investors!! We have the great assurance with the financial improvement of CBAT. Net revenues increased by $2.5M, 31%. Gross profit increased by $1.4M, whooping 109% from $0.7M. Operating profit increased 1.9M from ($1.5M) loss to $0.4M profit. Net Profit increased by $1.804M from $1.8M loss from $0.04M profit, earnings per share (EPS): EPS improved by $0.0007 profit from the $0.04 loss. CBAT did tremendous improvement without the rollout of the tabless battery.  Then again, this earning report doesn‚Äôt matter. This ER is not the game changer or the subject matter to us, folks. Therefore, you shouldn‚Äôt apply this quarterly report into your investing decision maker. Boys and girls, BE ambitious!! Investors must buy CBAT because you expect the massive growth with successful rollout of tabless battery in 1st Half of 2021. We will get the great success story all together. It is not that far from now.

just wait till it gets crazy high and buy long dated ATM puts. all the risk is taken out and she'll think you're a computa genius

also for tax reasons she should have her own options account

Well I‚Äôd appreciate you. Why don‚Äôt you buy her something nice with those gains and get her excited?
Awesome dude. One day at a time man. I‚Äôve got 4 years on Friday.
Until the runoff is secured it can still be 50/50 with VP as deciding vote.
Opens Roth and still has 40k+to decide with still.
Ewww. This is a casino, sir
2012 was the only time the bears had a good offense
Idk walmart+ scary not betting on any side lol
Can confirm. OP is a retard.
Prob Tesla calls, December expiration should be safe enough. $550 strike.
Max the roth then open brokerage for rest?
prob itm eom lol
Never watched an episode
Fuck yes. Let‚Äôs get it. I‚Äôve rinsed these for nice profits twice now, hoping to see a third.
No 2 interviews is usually interested but still skeptical, you have to flip heads 3 times in a row
AirBnB is just an annoying ankle biter that can get regulated out of existence at any time by communities updating their zoning codes.

Hoping for TGT to sympathy trade WMT. If it‚Äôs promising enough I‚Äôll just close out and not risk Wednesday earnings
I‚Äôm glad my tax arrangement is just me dumping off some papers then uncritically submitting them to the IRS. I don‚Äôt want to have to look my guy in the eye after he‚Äôs read 300 pages of me nickel and diming KOS shares and shit lol
Unless we are all more machine than men in the future the astronauts are probably more the test subjects than the operators, which is why they're hanging out in space

Jeezzzzus why didn‚Äôt I keep my 500 shares. I was in around $2 and got out around $5.

If you want to brainwash us with in depth analysis that make sense, don‚Äôt waste your time and fuck off to r/investing
It‚Äôs going to the moon. All the S&P 500 ETF and mutual funds will have to buy shares.
Why
Smart for IV reasons tbh
That was before S&P though
Couple of weeks ago, I get assigned 2500 shares after I wrote $400 puts. I only sold 1000 of them last week. Should I sell the remaining tomorrow? later this week? I'm using $400k on margin at 2%.
I rlly want to buy my gut is telling me not to... idk who to listen to... my brain or my ballsack
Gay‚Äôs Dain
Last week it stayed up and even closed at the daily high on Monday and then started the drop Tuesday at open
Lmao imagine studying the stock market to make predictions only to realize that the stock market is just about memes. Look TSLA is so hot right now. What makes worth so much? Who decides the value? Why does a spaceship increase the stock value? Who even owns a Tesla? Fuck if I know but I do know that I made 440% gains on a stock that I did zero research on. I got WSB and I went with the crowd. Know what I‚Äôm gonna do tomorrow? I‚Äôm gonna hop on that Tesla rocket and go to space. Why? Because that‚Äôs what WSB is doing. Sorry you wasted your time on such a thought out DD but this is 2020. Quit assigning reasoning to the market. Become a jelly fish and go with the flow
Not sure. Just look at the option chain for NOV 20. Clearly 50 strike is where the smart money is.

I mean one thing gme has is a brand name. If they branch out to the digital market it would be a hit.
Futes are red, really forgot what red day feels like... this market really only has spats of green or red, just like musical chairs never know when red comes tho... if anything risk off tomorrow cause trump tweeted about the market.  


But still fomo into tsla shares leverged to the tits or calls if IV isn't dumb
Fuk vix all my homies hate vix
ugh
I believe so. I can feel it in my plums
Bro i bought DOCU at $87 i wish I had your capital
Absolutely
I have one TSLA 12/11 620c lol I'm guessing I hold until at least December?
I prefer links for DD than making something up.
Oh yeah, can‚Äôt forget the shocked pickachu faces when the $20 otm FDs don‚Äôt turn out to be 5 baggers lmao
I'm going to buy you out with this money
Blah blah blah give me a ticker and strike to go all in on
All f@gs with no interest in the stock yet wasting their time to click anyways and tell me they don't like it. You either like money or you don't, no skin off my dick if you don't invest your $5 weekly allowance
Every now and then I log in and look at this page seeing the potential money I could have made. This is kid stuff, any retard could do it and yet here I am still procrastinating.
All these retards need to be banned just for being so retarded
Tesla puts tommrow at open is a 20 bagger, change my mind
Hell yeah, Breakbot
You let the dancing citrus bear get into your head?
I think it's going to be huge. It disrupts the hotel industry and has no competitors.

It‚Äôs tempting. I remember those legendary Tesla run ups and it could last all this week

ask a guy with tsla calls anything
good for you, nobody cares about your win
Yesterday this guy made a ban bet that trump would never concede the election. Today he says he will shit on his neighbors porch if SPY is -1% tomorrow. You crazy.
[deleted]
Wait to open you don‚Äôt know what crazy price it‚Äôll start at
Won‚Äôt the fund manager have to sell off the other companies and buy telsa ? So the play is to wait till dec to buy calls?
i sold my positions this morning. fuck.
Weak
It‚Äôs about to matter again to those people. Load up on ZM calls
Think NIO hit 55 eow? Because I sold a 55c. I wouldn't mind it end at 54 eow.
The fuck is this from? But this reminds me of having sex on molly.

If you‚Äôre not satisfied with gains chances are you‚Äôll only be satisfied with losses. 

Have you considered going all in on SPY Calls for EOD tmrw?

Might help you find what you‚Äôre looking for
USG is paying $10B for MSFT to build out the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract. Nokia has the ‚Äúmagic sauce‚Äù for the infrastructure. The lunar 4G would be a bonus with Azure Orbital.

Boy this is so yesterday. Take a seat

Your dad didn't gamble away your tuition. That was always his money.

Unfortunately for him, when you're rich someday, and he's not, you might hold this against him
thought so from your user, Status Quo was my fav team back in the day.
Hey I have that same contract, I also bought at .35
Not worth it. Boomer stonk now
That amount can change the lives of many retards on this sub here but they are all gonna gamble it away so...heh.
Poor
Fuck yes
How you going to get to 200% if you sell at 100%? Smh
It is possible for valuations to decelerate without a major pullback. Of course it cannot rise like this every year, but it doesn't necessarily mean it'll plummet horribly
Bro covid isn't even real lmao just buy this shit ATHs are super bullish historically
Nah man, TSLA for sure gonna be  worth AAPL, AMZN and MSFT combined
460
You guys are getting paid?
Dude sell that shit and reinvest , it‚Äôs literally your whole entire account
3 years ago valuations were historically high but not historically unprecedented. Right now we have historically unprecedented valuations. We need the biggest earnings surge ever in the next 12 months, or the market is fucking crashing.
This
Well played.
This. It's not the Fortune 500.
Haha cuz I want the money now! It‚Äôs an April 3190 call
GME!!!
This. I‚Äôm buying 11/20 calls at open and seeing where this goes.
missing the "this is unbelievable! my WMT calls are down?? WMT crushed earnings" comments from dumb autists
Isnt that the whole point of wsb?
Will my option print, that's all I need to know. Please dont be a retard
He‚Äôs HIV POSITIVELY WINNING
Your continuous shilling of GME made me buy back in to the 30c 1/15/21. It was heavily discounted at like .35 I think, would have to check.
Patiently await the calls going to 0
everything except the hubble and james webb telescope have basically been useless space junk and a waste of taxpayer money / increase of nuclear threat
If I told you a call tomorrow morning will be up 1000% from what it was today, would you think that would be a good time to buy?
You forget every country in the world is printing money including the US. Half the money goes into the market. We will set all new highs due to this. Now that trading is super easy everyone with a phone is now an investor. All stocks will triple with the trillions of dollar stimulus
Its unrealized! Key is to never realize it. Wala, no loss.
Your tears and pointless comment took more effort than clicking the article. Try hard
Leaps
Appreciate it bro ü•∫
Uhhh i think you got how the IV works wrong.
Lol bro didn‚Äôt you do this exact thing?
Doubt they have. The one time I try to buy something from wmt, their shit servers crash and wouldn‚Äôt let me complete the purchase of ps5. Fuck them
Wait til open or put in an order now to buy at open?
Y e s
Mine would expect me to buy her shit
bears r fuk?
Bet you tried to ask the cashier for Szechuan  sauce

Yea but Citron can still voice his opinions on PLTR which may affect the stock.

Looking at this guy‚Äôs username you know he was at the Trump Election Fraud Rally over the weekend.
Retail will drive it up after the dip
yes I'm writing some ridiculous put tomorrow just to get some free money though
Is that good so there merging. I thought they were just in a partnership what will this mean for my options
The first time in weeks I choose to be kinda responsible and buy call spreads over naked calls it was today on TSLA.. also happens to be the only spread I've bought where I'm going to actually hit the max profit. Oh well green is green.
Their governor is pretty hot though. I know nothing about her but I saw a commercial for sd and she spoke and was hot, that‚Äôs my dd
Lmao I just watched John wick 2 yesterday.
Not high enough to matter

Airbnb IPO coming- you guys gonna load up?
Call Georgia for Kanye
still better than retards who sold their 11/20 calls today, feel better
They all ran into AH while Tesla popped.
Pltr is a 10 bagger

oh yeah... its going to go bonkers lol. I may just join in for shares if setup looks good. Options if we trade flat for more than 30 mins (really kills IV) lol
Sir this is a wendy's
Not happening. He has been involved since spring 2019. He is not walking at this point. Way to much upside (Billions) for him to walk on GameStop for a small 30M gain on his shares. 

It's either management does what he wants (not likely) or he takes over the company (likely). That's where we are at after this letter.

You‚Äôll get a stomachache and something like the spins, but you can just eat a little snack and chill for a bit and you‚Äôll feel better. You‚Äôll feel pretty good on a strong dose, just not like fucked up and blacking out  like you would on a ton of Xanax
smh wyd pos h8er
Same thing was said for weeks when TSLA was around 950. Then it just ran to 2100
I sold bc I used margin and was preparing for a potentially volatile earning's week
Pltr is da way
Spy fds tomorrow?
PLTR actually has far superior ethics compared to the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon. PLTR doesnt monetize user data and personal info and sell for profit. they just help sort through info that is already present in an environment so that customers can make intelligent decisions
Why not drop tomorrow after retail runs it up even more?
My puts omg
[deleted]
They will. All large inclusions to the s&p500 do this.  This will likely be the largest in history. It will be good for Tesla since they can spend to their hearts delight without fear and their stock price will stabilize so in the worse case, another capital raise in the future will not be difficult.
How long do you think these tech companies will live for?
What‚Äôs happening to Walmart?
Im proud of you keep it up :) you got this
PLTR gonna break over 18 this week?
Too many ppl over leveraged in nio and forgot all about Musk
Bro your positions are perfect. Please consider taking some profit tomorrow so you don‚Äôt get wiped out if they sell off on earnings.
This post is fuckin awful
Posting a link is not DD, you dumb shit
You don't think he could spread his magic sauce all over nok
The only time to buy puts on Tesla is at the top
You're about right. Although I thought it sold off a bit the day off.
The Big Short is free on the ROKU channel. ROKU 300c 12/18
Long from $29.93. Bored of high shares. üëç
No more or less than the average retard here. Most NIO $$ is flowing to TSLA tomorrow
You think that's impressive? I've been calling mu since 2018
Nobody tell him
Fuck that! You are so far ahead of where I was at your age. I couldn't even imagine having 20k...which would have been about 5k in my time.

Life is long son, and you've been watching and learning. Do not drop out of college...do it yourself. That simple accomplishment will one day be your most valuable treasure. Do not underestimate the reward of overcoming obstacles.

In five years this will be a distant memory, and mark my words...you'll be stronger and prouder than ever. Get fierce, get out there and fucking never, ever quit...you will succeed.
FAGMAT is also acceptable.
Puts on ex-dividend date?
How can you be hedge fund manager when you can‚Äôt even manage your own account?

Who cares what your dad does, go make your own money and put yourself thru school
Tomorrow could be a huge day for GME, I‚Äôm really curious on how the market reacts to the news on Cohen
Fucker keeps calling the top
The pdt minimum is more likely to get moved up to 50k.
Have you considered selling puts at a price you're more comfortable buying?
Buy NIO instead

6 months ago this retard had a post saying the same stuff, but ending it with ‚ÄúI got lucky, don‚Äôt be like me, it‚Äôs an addiction, yadda yadda yadda‚Äù

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjx8x3/_/fqnnk0i/?context=1

Now it‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck it, I‚Äôm back!‚Äù

Get help man. Save yourself.

Edit: text below

Started daytrading in 2004. Built up 500k to 2MM.
Then discovered options. Started buying 500k worth of options at height of gambling addiction. Went from 4MM to 350k in 2014. Went yolo all 350k in January of 2015 and made a million in a week.
Trump election and I went all in again and rode it all the way up to the highs you see in that chart. Started dreaming of 20MM to 100MM. I started buying 500 to 2000 deep itm fb and aapl calls. Risking 1MM every week on weekly options.
Luckily I was took out money for taxes and nice house and fancy cars. Hookers blow etc.
In the end I blew up my account of 8MM in 3 months during the correction at the end of 2018. In a sense I was relieved. Daily swings of 500k to a mill messes with your brain chemistry. I was no different from a coke addict. Had to get my fix. I knew one day I‚Äôd lose it all. Options are just gambling. I had won the World Series of poker 2-3 times. I look back and know there are 3-4 trades that would‚Äôve made me broke but I got lucky. I stopped trading until recently. I‚Äôm telling myself to avoid options but boy is it hard.
Don‚Äôt be me. I see so many people making the same mistakes I made. Difference between you and me. Luck. That‚Äôs it. Flip of a coin.
You tell yourself you‚Äôll get out and sell. It‚Äôs not that easy. Most will not have the strength. Maybe this story will help a couple of you degenerates out there. Take the money and run. Or be ok losing it all because you will eventually.
Retard luck
Mine gets happy when I put the toilet seat down. I think the money would impress her too.
That one molecule part really got me lol.
 You notice how your reply got downvoted, you dingbat?
Well I was poor my whole life, so I joined the Army to pay for my college. Graduated from basic training on August 16th 2001, so you can do the math on how my next few years went. I saved my money while deployed, bought a duplex when I got out, went to college, and have worked my way up to a top salesman in my company. So stop fucking crying about not having daddies money anymore, and do something about it.
Stop giving these dumb fucks hope
I own options calls and if you go to Pfizer right now. It doesn‚Äôt have calls available. Weird as f ! I hope my money doesn‚Äôt disappear.
I personally bought a debit put spread from 410 to 405 that was profitable up until today üòî let‚Äôs hope my SPY calls outweigh the carnage
Could be a good indicator of a big day too. Typically wait 15 minutes and then buy. If you see a sell off from per market, it‚Äôs around then.
Should I give up PLTR leaps to hop in TSLA calls at the top to only regret it? Probably.
No, she literally rolls her eyes like she doesn‚Äôt believe me.
tesla is very popular among the boomers. i think we are trying to own this but no one brings up tesla more than my mother

So inverse
How much of a retard would I be if I sold my NIO calls and FOMO‚Äôd into Tesla?
You do NOT fuck with the taxman.
jelq a mod
yes
Hahaha
Wtf is this??
So every time TSLA hits above 450 recently we drop big.  ü§î
Bang Ding Ow
Do it was simply a capital raise because the price was at a good amount do justify it. You do realize companies do not do 5&p500 capital raises on rumor, they implement it afterwards.
RIP. Here in SD we have about 1000 per Day and governor dipshit is firmly attached to the "do nothing" approach
The Tesla call is so tempting. But could go down so bad too.
200-220 range take it or leave it
no dude.  patience
maybe u are paying off a deficit
nice
Fk Solo, sold that shit at $3 cuz it hasnt moved for months and sold for $30 loss only to see it climb to $6 just a day later

Those playing WMT earnings for the first time let me break down how the last 4 went: Spike leading up to earnings, wmt crushes earnings, stock spikes up $3-5 pre market then slowly starts fading and at the end of the week ends up at about the price it was before the day of earnings. Did I miss anything?
All week
sounds like a keeper to me
Well then all my spy 380c should print
True.  You forgot sideways.
Dude I only had one TSLA share that I planned on holding. I got bored with it not moving and sold it this fucking morning so I could buy more MRNA shares. Im a small dumbass, but still a dumbass.
What does a young autist have to do for a flair? Lose 25k?
Must be, looks like he‚Äôs still working on his english
$480
Nutella would get fired for allowing Microsoft to acquire such a pile of shit
Lol I've been burned for so long by RKT. Literally just sticking around for the principle of it at this point.  Such a tease of a stonk.  Billions in profit per quarter, enough profits that would take TSLA a decade to make up and still sticks to $22.
40-50
I bought 20 NIO calls this morning but the IV freaked me the fuck out. Thought it would go down again since we started at $40 this morning. My dumb ass sold my calls and switched to puts about an hour before the market closed. 


Really wish I hit my head against a wall and knocked myself out instead.
Stream of consciousness response + more than you probably wanted:  Loa Waka is great and my usual, but I tried the Pouni Ono last time around and really enjoyed it. I think those two are among the stronger ones they sell and you can definitely tell. Preparing it with a blender and straining it through a bag is the easiest and cleanest way to prep it at home. Making it by hand makes it really strong but it takes forever and is kind of a pain. An alu ball is good for on the go but can be wasteful.

Always clean up before you start drinking it because there will be times where you have major couch lock and don‚Äôt feel like cleaning up, and oh my god does it smell terrible if it‚Äôs been sitting too long lmao. Spare yourself the misery. Mixing with a little bit of coconut milk helps improve the feeling as the kavalactones are fat soluble.  Mixing it with a touch of tropical juice can help with the flavor when you‚Äôre not used to it.  Be careful if you take a lot of medicine, as it could over tax your liver. South Pacific people often do what‚Äôs called a wash down‚Äîhaving a beer after a kava session‚ÄîI‚Äôve done it and it feels great, but I don‚Äôt do it often given the potential liver issues. Probably no reason to worry but better safe than sorry.  Kava is great and really does wonders for my general mood + occasional anxiety and mercifully doesnt have any of the same side effects/dependency issues that kratom or phenibut bring to the table.  Listen to your body, and have fun. It‚Äôs really quite a comfy recreational activity!
Shut the fuck up and buy TSLA calls

Charts still show potential for nasdaq to dump tomorrow. It's very close to breaking out but just couldn't get it together today.
i‚Äôm so excited for retarded tsla yolos and the porn that follows
It'll go up a dollar and then down three. That's something.
They're flying in low, shitting on people
I agree, but XOM has a good enough balance sheet that it probably would be a long while away for them
Ya.  I can never get past 10k so I usually do that lol.
Crazy right.. holy shit
All the big players made their moves in after market. You can be sure as hell there'll be a drop once market opens
Opening price - strike price x 100 = intrinsic value for each contract. 

How is it always the people who know the least that make the most?
Salary? ü•¥
Anything below 260
Fantastic
Won‚Äôt most of the movement happen pre market?
Feel the way the shit clings to the air?
What do you do (did you do) for actual real people work?
Not a lot of people have that laying around.... haha
See Expedia
I hope FSR is up 5-10% pre market and then another 5-10% during trading hours.
Stop, he‚Äôs already dead!
SPY 3Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ by the end of the week

With TSLA added, the boomers will be pouring back into this fund! Buckle up!
Great DD at market open THIS morning.
Yup
If it hits 40000 you gotta run into MY garage door.
She looks like Wayne Gretzky
F* Tesla.. NIO is the way
How is tsla gang feeling
Agreed
No... don‚Äôt. Anyways...
Can't win if you lose
It‚Äôs probably going to go up or down. Not sure what other info you need.
Forgive my complete retardation but why are these weeklies so goddam cheap?
Start by walking. Put on a good podcast or audio book and walk a few miles. Helps clear your mind. The hardest part is getting out the door.
I‚Äôm thinking we open green then bleed all day from 10am and on

Can‚Äôt even afford to sell calls with my 30 shares. I have a leap down 60% not sure what happens now
I sold one at $430, so sad rn.
Oui
Yeah but that's like the entire population of Alaska, so they have herd immunity
I would be careful selling spreads first day after announcement like this. TSLA tends to run for a week or 2 before cooling off. We could easily see $600 and everyone would have surprised Pikachu face.
Maybe I‚Äôm just cross faded, but I feel like tomorrow morning is to heavily overleverage in Tesla right at open and then pull out after the initial euophria of the morning. Watched it happen split day cause my call didn‚Äôt fill and I‚Äôm not letting it happen again.

edit: this stock has a following like no other. The retail fomo will be unreal
No but for real what‚Äôs Tesla end of day price gonna be?

Will this TSLA move have an immediate impact on SPY calls or puts?   Need an autist to explain
I trust my balls. I trust em
There are those that are just too fearful of YOLO'ing and prefer low risk (AKA pussies)

Then there are those that used to YOLO 30k in weekly FD's and have blown up their account. I am on my 3rd stop at my "higher-low" so I need to be careful. I still have plenty of gains from April to hold onto, and when you need to be careful it is much smarter  to just buy lot of shares or shares on margin (AKA retards that are trying to not be retarded)

6k is tough. I can make $500-1000 a day easily with shares though. Only problem is theirs always a pull back. So pretend that I made $2000 in the week their will be a pullback the same week for like $800. If I learned to take profits and rebuy on dips percentage would go way higher.

If GameStop takes practical steps to cut its excessive real estate costs and hire the right talent, it will have the
resources to begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming
selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers. This is the type of
world-class infrastructure that was constructed at Chewy, which is worth multiples of GameStop‚Äôs current
market capitalization.

Guys..no gay bear vibes here but hear me out. Likely within the next 12 months we are heading towards a very very nasty correction (best case) or another full out crash (who knows). It could be sooner, it could be later, but the fact it's coming is a certainty.

The current Schiller P/E ratio is 33, eclipsed **only** by the dot-com era 44 peak in December of 1999. The last and only time we were **ever** at 33 was in September of 98, 15 months from the tech crash.

The current Buffet Indicator of Market Cap / GDP is at an **all time high,** uneclipsed at any point in history. During the peak of the dot com bubble in January of 2000, we were at 133%. We're currently at 177%.

All this is to say we are currently at multiple standard deviations above historical valuation norms, and it is statistically impossible for the market to continue its current upward trajectory for more than a year or so, without a generational level retracement.

"We just had a crash in March retard, this is a new bull market" you'll say. While we did have a crash, this followed a 10 year bull market run and we only corrected to still highly overvalued levels compared to current euphoric valuations. Consider this: tech crash corrected to Schiller 23 P/E. Financial crisis corrected to Schiller 15 P/E. March crash corrected **at the bottom** to Schiller \~28 P/E, and we have completely retraced and moved higher to 33.

There is only one caveat that can help us avoid a very nasty fall. We will need to see both the biggest earnings surge in stock market history coupled with the biggest GDP growth in market history. Both are currently priced into the numerators. If not, feel free to keep playing the game but make sure you have a chair when the music stops soon..
What‚Äôs the average salary of an autist on here?

Still risk adjusted return on capital is way higher for a job than a trader. Also the point I heard on here once about why people don‚Äôt like traders - because they provide nothing to society except benefit to themselves (although you could argue that‚Äôs at least better than causing harm to society for money).
 

TDLR: Alot more TSLA float coming your way.

Big companies issue capital raises before s&p500 inclusion. Tesla will likely issue the largest in history.

"For all you new traders who do not think there will be a new capital raise by TSLA, you need to think again. It is very common for big companies to do with when included in the S&P500. Two examples for you, Google and Facebook. Tesla will likely issues one of the largest capital raises in history.

Saying it won't be very na√Øve. Tesla also needs as much capital as it can get to expand its exponential growth which the stock currently has priced in.

Also big money already bought up large reserves of TSLA for the inclusion. It was not if they were include, it was when.
Real good chance

Fauci says vaccine will be available from April 2021 for most people. First quarter, the vaccine will only be made available for healthcare workers and people in high risk group for COVID19

1. You‚Äôre young, healthy and you live in America - it‚Äôs a privilege to live in this great county. It‚Äôs a blessed to wake up every morning and breathe freely.

2. Clear your mind and energy  before brainstorming your future . Go to the place where it‚Äôs easy for you to feel appreciation, may be going to a lake or hiking to scenic areas, enjoy sunrise in serene morning. Or binging on comedies you enjoy.  

3. After you are in a better mindset, decide what to do next. Go to community college ? Working and investing smartly? Taking student loan? What‚Äôs your talents? Jeremy from Financial education worked at Walgreens making minimum wage back then. 

3. Depend on yourself . Don‚Äôt expect financial help from your parents. Forgive your Dad and ask him to get help. If he refuses, don‚Äôt sweat, he‚Äôs an adult. 

4. Read stories about successful and inspiring people .

5. Stay positive!

Talk to the issuer of your credit card.  
They will forward this to the fraud department, at which you can provide the documentation (show them the receipt from the desk attendant and picture of the bedbug).

That's all there's to it, there's no point in talking to the hotel anymore as they're not willing to help you.

What movie is this?
Right. Then March happened, it crashed, everyone had the opportunity to buy stocks for dirt cheap only to have them where they‚Äôre at now. There may very well be another one coming even in spite of PFE/MRNA‚Äôs vaccine announcements and imminent approvals.  Covid cases are still rampant and lock downs are coming. If the market goes down buy the dip
That's all well and good, but I scrolled this looking for forward-looking upsies or downsies and didn't see it, and for that reason, I'm out.
There are at least 50 comments in this thread directly saying NIO is fucked and correlating it to the S&P inclusion
So what do we DO!

If he bought it for half a billion whitch I‚Äôm sure might be over pricing, converted GameStop all digital like Microsoft and psn store, then added renting games again like that one company used to that nailed out games, then re structure amount of retail building cut off anyone‚Äôs they were paying leasing on and start direct partnerships etc, with the gaming growth last 5 years with the public, add in that they would basically become gaming supply monopoly. Could easily easily become a 100 billion market or more Globally. Fuck it throw in a new 4.99 subscription to be apart of like renting digital games etc, gov have to eventually step in let EB games come back to life
that's a solid point. but i'm all shares for the most part.

I'll double my own money if I didn't have to pay for my family. Braces and shit are expensive
Buy calls 24/7
 So I have a question for anyone who actually does this for a living. What do you think is the best form of insurance for any correction over -5%? Shares of an inverse etf such as SPXS or SQQQ? Really far dated out and far OTM puts on an index etf such as SPY or QQQ. Personally I‚Äôm more thetagang then anything since I don‚Äôt enter any naked positions besides LEAPS. So spreads are Somthing I would refer to do. Thoughts?
But I want to make money tomorrow.

I don't have a speculative date.  All I said is that they WILL have a capital raise.

Big companies issue capital raises before s&p500 inclusion. Tesla will likely issue the largest in history.

"For all you new traders who do not think there will be a new capital raise by TSLA, you need to think again. It is very common for big companies to do with when included in the S&P500. Two examples for you, Google and Facebook. Tesla will likely issues one of the largest capital raises in history.

Saying it won't be very na√Øve. Tesla also needs as much capital as it can get to expand its exponential growth which the stock currently has priced in.

Also big money already bought up large reserves of TSLA for the inclusion. It was not if they were include, it was when.

If you make console games, would you rather throw more inventory at gamestop, or would you put more inventory in Amazon? 

Amazon charges a lot of fees, discriminates traffic if you don't pay to use fba, and amazon makes you eat refunds as well. 

I can't tell you how many times I've had customers order stuff just to "try it out and then return it", many times having taken a piece out also. Amazon has a generous return policy, and I think people fail to underestimate how much of an impact it has on the bottom line. 

Customers trying your game before they actually buy? Fuck that. 


You know how it is at gamestop though. Once you open that 59.99 game, return it would mean "selling it back". You sell your game back to gamestop, they gonna give you $5 for that game LOL (exaggeration, but you get my point) 


Yes, Amazon is good for the customer. But not so good for the game maker. If I were a game maker, id skew towards having more inventory on GME. I'll put some on amazon for the visibility and stuff, obviously... but if my bottom line means more profits at gme, ill focus my inventory there. 



It is almost 2021. Customers can easily switch between sites to buy games. If I'm a game maker id rather put 100000 units at amazon and 900000 units on gme if i can get more bottom line at gme - because if my game is good, customers are gonna buy it regardless. 


Sure, customers will prefer to buy at amazon instead... but as a game maker if I know my game is solid with hype already, id focus on my bottom line.





Unrelated sidenote - look at the resell value of ps5. Crazy. 


This is just my opinion, do your own dd, and on my end im happy with my autistic gme calls purchased with the allowance that my girlfriend's boyfriend's gave me.

Nio puts and spy calls
Red flag from seeking alpha: 

"Digging in, we find that PLTR is reporting a loss of over $853 million mostly due to $847 million in "compensation charges" related to its public listing. I went through PLTR's Form 424B3 Registration (No. 333-248413) to learn more. It made my eyes burn and brain hurt, but the summary seems to be very simple...

PLTR needed to give early investors, management, and many others a lot of money. Importantly, it isn't done, so this expense will not got to zero. Then again, nearly every company bleeds a bit due to stock options and related compensation, especially technology companies. So, we cannot ignore this going forward. It's a real expense, perhaps even a red flag."

Last weekend I was supposed to stay in a hotel rather than face a two hour drive home. After checking in I was in the room for about 20 minutes when I found a bedbug crawling toward me in the bathroom. I took a picture, gathered my belongings, informed the front desk attendant that I was checking out and the reason why, and left. I was handed a receipt showing my card was not charged and the attendant said ‚Äúcall back the next day in order to get my refund‚Äù. Of course I was still charged and have spent a week trying to get ahold of the hotel manager. Manager‚Äôs response was ‚Äúwe did not find any bedbugs. The room didn‚Äôt even looked like it was stayed in and as such you won‚Äôt be getting a refund per the owner‚Äù. My question is how do I go about getting my money back? I‚Äôve contacted corporate but they only refer me back to the hotel manager in question. I‚Äôve disputed the charge on my credit card but I know they contact the merchant in such instances and don‚Äôt want the charge to come back. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!
You know what you inspired me to do it. Thanks üôè
Well I don't think it's owned by them, but it is a shit company that has never released an actual product.

The way I see it there will definitely be people interested in taking a profit. You just have to try and figure out if they outnumber the gazillion retail investors and incredibly large index funds that also need to make purchases. Imma go with a ‚Äúno‚Äù on that one. Unless it opens at a truly usurious number I would not anticipate a dip at all on open.

Solid explanation üëå
It depends on how it s gonna trade pre market! 1) If it s already up like around 490-500 then it s gonna sell off at open and may ramp back above 500 at the end of the day as long as 450 holds all day! 2)  if it opens like 460-470 then there is not going to be a dip at open as it will just gonna go straight up and then consolidate in-the afternoon and more up at the end of the day!

That sounds reasonable, I put a sell order for 465 and I‚Äôll buy back in if it drops below 435

all i can tell INO has a huge room to run. But mgmt needs to learn a thing or two from mrna on boosting sp. They seems to have the goods but exec doesn't have the spine to boldly execute it!
I sold my 28 shares on Friday to fund my Palantir investment.. I‚Äôm down $500 on PLTR and I‚Äôm out of Tesla position, never bet against Elon
I‚Äôve never read anything like this before, but are algos consistently trading and losing money while pumping the price?
I agree but God damn do you misunderstand their business model

If these passive funds *need* to buy 100 million+ shares, wouldn't the smart thing be for Elon to immediate issue a secondary offering of that many shares??
So if I keep commenting on a Instagram models post she eventually has to go on a date with me right?

The¬†Foreign Emoluments Clause¬†is a provision in¬†Article I,¬†Section 9, Clause 8 of the¬†United States Constitution, that prohibits the¬†federal government¬†from granting titles of¬†nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving¬†gifts,¬†emoluments, offices or titles from foreign¬†states¬†and¬†monarchies¬†without the consent of the¬†United States Congress. Also known as the¬†Titles of Nobility Clause, it was designed to shield the federal officeholders of the United States against so-called "corrupting foreign influences." The clause is reinforced by the corresponding prohibition on state titles of nobility in¬†Article I, Section 10, and more generally by the¬†Republican Guarantee Clause¬†in¬†Article IV, Section 4.

What you don't want to do is roll into Friday with shares at 16.50 and get that 17.05 at close. That's the same as a loss.
Other option. Sell $18 calls for Friday. Get some scratch back on hope you can fill that gap for extra tendies.

Lol you just said in your previous comment that historically the stock market favors Republicans. Now when I show you evidence to the contrary: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you think the two parties can be compared over the last hundred years fairly‚Äù. 

And in your other comment you said the market performs about the same under both parties!

So which is it dude? You just choosing every possible side simultaneously so that you can‚Äôt possibly be wrong? Hilarious.
I‚Äôm praying to the meme lord tonight real hard
I think this reflects a last chance for the gamestop leadership to get onboard before an aggressive buyout/takeover -- which I would presume would result in existing leadership terminations? Cohen has a plan for the business and I'm guessing it's worth a lot of money.  Cohen could gather the capital needed to essentially takeover this business if he wants.  I think this is effectively putting the board members on notice.   Wish this had happened sooner but this just shows that there is a \*huge\* amount of value in the customers and the brand. Sure there is always a possibility of Cohen throwing his hands up but I don't think Cohen would have taken such a large stake if he intended to bow out quickly. A tender offer could force the squeeze but I really don't think that's what they want.  I think they they want to take this business and make it uber successful. Sounds like a win win.

never mind i need to return some video tapes
Bears been saying this since spy 330
Yup.  Go $20 out.   1 month.  Free money
The key to navigating pumps is context.  Next time you see a lumber liquidators post with 5x gold, run through your mind the series of life decisions that led you to seriously considering yoloing LL... Which by the way even LL is 4x since the pump days.

On the other side of the spectrum is growth companies with little to no revenue but a ton of potential future revenue.  We're talking SPCE, PRPL, and most recently NIO, XPENG, LI.  Russ Hanneman said it best.

TSLA is in a league of its own.  They had all the hallmarks of a typical unicorn running on pure hopium, but behind the scenes actually delivered and built gigafactories.  Now the bat shit crazy lady on MSNBC from 2 years ago with a price target of 5k turned out not to be so crazy after all as the s&p500 joining TSLA announcement finally l released today.

So it sounds like you just need to work on your timing, and if that fails then you can't lose with shares if you never sell.

Will buy half TSLA calls at open and then double down if there's a dip. Can't go tits up
You are 6 months late to the conversation
EV‚Äôs have created such fantastic opportunities in this market for both bears and bulls this year. Just off the top of my head; 

-Tesla pre-split run up & now this S&P inclusion

- Nikolas initial bull run into the laughing stock of the EV (& WSB) community 

- NIO‚Äôs epic bull run (cough cough besides Friday)

- plus so many more plays I‚Äôm missing with both these companies and others like GM, Lordstown, Solo, etc....
This guy pays rent with sucks, priced in.
Me last week. I'm mostly cash, but, like put 10% into SPY puts....
GE calls. I‚Äôm telling you it‚Äôs gonna release EV stuff soon
Monopoly? Lol. Have your heard of Dataminr, plenty of smaller companies playing in the same space.
What an astute observation and intelligent question sir, I wish I knew the answer
Or learn to navigate the paywall. It is what I do.
Ah yes Deutsche Bank, now that is an institution with a sterling reputation.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs on my list to research. Thanks for the vote to look at it. Why do you like it?
NIO is gunna be walkin funny tomorrow morning after a night with Elon
How much would that be worth? Im option illiterate
[deleted]
I doubt buying either for the exposure is going to have any correlation to tesla‚Äôs rally for being added to the s&p
Optionsprofitcalculator.com
mine die friday
And once again... I'm over leveraged with options expiring Wednesday. I need 3650 dammit
An inclusion will have no effect on spy..
Exactly... and lockdowns are coming down hard and vaccine still isnt till next year. It will dump
On that ride too. Bought my 450c 11/20 @ $9.90 today thinking it was a little rich for my taste, but fuck it, it‚Äôs bound to break out. Boy was I right.
Got me some of those too. Kind of lost a day today so now we play the 50 cent game. If it doesn't go up 50 cents by EOD tomorrow, I'm selling. If it does, I play the 25 cent game Wed thru Fri.

Where is the bottom on alibaba. Who the hell sells it now ?
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. At least at open. I‚Äôm out day trades so I won‚Äôt touch it until it dips. But then IV is gonna be a nightmare.
Nah, the news is not bullish, its kind of caution in the air which basically means if Cohen wants more control, he will have to buy more of the company.. or.. he can bail the fuck out of GME because the management isnt listening
sheeeeet China drilling right now
Opening at $500 tomorrow morning

I‚Äôve had a few drinks since my last comment so I‚Äôm not fully disposed to find all the charts I‚Äôve been using. But a youtuber I found a week ago that goes by Steven Van Metre has some good videos that align with my ideas as well. His past 7 videos are really excellent if you have the time to watch them all. 

My only issue with him is that even though our ideas align, I think he‚Äôs a bit too bearish and has difficulties reconciling why nothing in the equities market is downtrending despite the macro evidence indicating we should be. Although in his defense he focuses more on bonds than equities. I‚Äôll try to write something more in depth tomorrow. Also for the link with the treasury bond sales, it doesn‚Äôt show the most recent sales, which do show less foreign buying.
Boomer leaps?
i have both
Uhh I think our country would burn to the ground if that were to happen.
It finally joined the club
Change my mind: buying XPEV for the TSLA sympathy run up will be cheaper in terms of IV (vs NIO)
When dip?
Just do opposite of wsb advices you will become billionaire in no time. If wsb says spy put go spy call

We aren't bearish. We are just bullish at 220.

Ahhh congrats to you!  Couldn't have happened to a nicer redditor

Bro there are so many PLTR posts...
Trump wanting to bomb Iran last week definitely ain‚Äôt bullish.
I've put most of things into AAPL before...
Wait until after dip is my suggestion
So what your also saying is 12/4 400c
Okay what are you trying to tell us ? Because if you have consistently been predicting top of the market I don't care you succeeded, what I care about is when is the next down.

And if you were able to do so I want to see a picture of your Ferrari collection because with the perfect timing of your prediction Covid must have made you one hell of a fortune. 

Or you just have a dumb idea of the top and want confirmation bias.
i mean he'd be buying it at it's highest price...so I think it is too late? unless people think itll just fly to 500

That'll be worth about $28k, not counting the IV pump.

Unfortunately, my accounting fee is also $28k.
I sold my 450C 11/20 around 1330 EST.  I was going to pick up something similar but for next week or so, but didn't have the settled funds.

Next earnings yes.   Flat till then tho
Good thing I pulled out in time.

listen you fucking retards. Dont feel bad. This shit doesnt usually happens. NO ONE FUCKING KNEW. Yeah sucks that you missed out, but dont get greedy and fomo tomorrow. Dont be thinking "what if" because that's how you lose it all. Yeah tomorrow and probably for the rest of the week every single idiot in this sub that call themselves "investors" will post their gains.

Thanks I use YouTube all on the ps4 and I think it‚Äôs search function is whacked out sometimes
Your an idiot. That is not how finance works

When you merge two companies in an all-stock transaction - you don't just add up their market cap. Post-transaction market cap DOES NOT equal mkt cap A + mkt cap B.

AMD is still acquiring the same $ amount of revenue and earnings in the transaction. The EV / revenue and P/E multiples they are paying remain unchanged. They are then hoping the market assigns the same multiple to the combined earnings as AMD receive, therefore generating incremental value.

The math here is AMD trades at 110x PE. They are acquiring XLNX at 55x PE. It doesn't matter if XLNX value cuts by 50% and they are now trading at 25x PE. AMD is going to acquire those earnings at 55x, and hope immediately upon closing they get blended up to AMD's PE of 110x. This would be called an accretive transaction
Oh boy. Good luck with that
Jesus. Please use Paragraphs you autistic SOB.

There is no may, it will. The Chinese government gives grants and funding to local companies to discourage others from buying foreign products. That‚Äôs why Huawei is so popular there. It‚Äôs a double edged sword because the CCP giveth and taketh away (cough cough BABA)

Also China doesn‚Äôt have the real estate for charging stations for Tesla‚Äôs, so the removable battery is a much better plan

I'm hoping not enough where I don't fall into a wave of depression.  I've already been bummed out all day.  My 160C are gonna be neutered by the CCs but I'm hoping the delta difference lets me exit the short position without sacrificing all my runup profit.  The thing that sucks is I was closing them, they didn't sell immediately so then I cancelled it.  If I would have just let the shorts close today I would have made 2k, plus another amount I don't want to add up lest I get sad again.

Go to your college advisor, explain the situation. Talk to them about the options they can give you. Get financial aid if you haven‚Äôt already. Take out a loan. Pay for the rest of your education, change to a cheaper school if you have to. Get your degree. Make your dad proud. You are old enough to not live in the shadow of his mistakes. Live your life, even if that means you have to pave your own way. 

My old man (stepdad) did something similar. In the tech bubble my family lost everything, I was 11. He blew through what was left of my moms teachers retirement, which was also tied up in Enron. Blew through the college savings my mom had set up for me. Filed for bankruptcy... twice, I think. I respect him because he goes all in. Everything he does, he‚Äôs all in. It‚Äôs his great fault. When it works, it fucking works. When it doesn‚Äôt though...

This shit sucks, but these moments and how you deal with them will define you ten years later. Stay strong. You gunna get through this.

Feels like you put this more for I told you so than to predict anything.
Yeah im gonna cut my losses on that tomorrow. At least GME and PLTR are mooning this week to make up for it
No one cares about your tiny pp position
Imagine not making some money in this dumb market. Just have at least 25K in your brokerage and buy a few 100 shares of Apple or Microsoft at lunch and sell them whenever they go up 1-2 dollars. The key is to take profits. If it goes down just wait it out or DCA. Made a killing watching Apple go down to 104 and back up to 120 and then down and up again. Have capital and no emotions.
Congrats on your diamond hands. I had purchased some fedex calls but sold earlier. Thinking about grabbing another based solely on the fact that the fedex ground near my house recently upped their starting pay from 17/hr to 24/hr for upcoming peak season. Good ass wages for factory work
Depends underlying source tbh. Main factor for me is exercise. I also find the thoughts and symptoms are correlated. Having anxious thoughts which leads to high heart rate try to lower heart rate with a hot shower and maybe some tea. 

Additionally I use Calm. You can get it from GNC it‚Äôs magnesium and it relaxes your muscles. Makes you shit real bad too but it‚Äôs worth
‚Äúinvestment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, so that their portfolios correctly reflect the index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices‚Äù
And? They still need to build more gig factories than they can. They mentioned over 100 to meet demand over the next X years?

You really' don't know how fast companies can burn cash like Tsla and Amzn. Infrastructure and hardware development is expensive. To develop a single chip, can easily cost 500 million. It is why so many companies go with off the shelf parts. TSLA is also building supercomputers among many other things.

Capital raise is 100% certain simply due to S&P500 inclusion. Think otherwise but you will be wrong.
I wouldn't. It's coupled to boomer etfs like vanguard etc. When boomers will dump it will dump in perfect sync. Good days of it acting like a penny stock are over.
Yes, video. It's ready

Their cash pile was alot smaller back then.  Less than 4b.  Q3 profits and the raise has them sitting at close to 15b with many of the factories underway and contracts in play already.

Cost per Giga is consistently going down as they build more and get more efficient/faster.

Unless they're about to announce over 5 new factories next year, I doubt they can spend all that cash.  That'd be great if they expanded that fast but it doesn't seem realistic even for Tesla. Bear in mind that's with their current cash, not counting Q4 cash or any new income for next year.
I was 7.80

Everything bad is priced in already.

I think your share count is off - I am seeing 948M shares outstanding / 80% public float

Also, market cap of TSLA is $386B, so the shares outstanding can't be 179M
You non believer NIO fuckboys need to GTFO.
Honestly, why even do options at this point? Might as well just trade the underlying stock and sell when it moves up a bit since you have such a large chunk of money.

I often trade with 100k and even with 5% of your capital, I often make several thousands with fairly small movements. That's tens of thousands for you.

- Your dad is an adult. He has a gambling addiction more than anything. Get him help but also remember that he‚Äôs accountable for his decisions. 

- Money will come and go. Clearly you‚Äôve seen this. 

- Don‚Äôt let experience with failures turn into roadblocks. Although they might be setbacks there‚Äôs also some valuable lessons to be learned there. These will better prepare you for that end goal.

You're both rude and uninformed. Couple things wrong with what you said.

Rule of thumb is you can draw 4% per year indefinitely and that number is adjusted for inflation too. 1m gives you 40k annually which is what the middle class lives on anyways.

No one is saying you can't work more while also earning 40k in gains annually.

Buy a call when it's down more than 47% but less than 55% from previous day close. Sell it when it hits a reasonable target.
Been saying it for days. Been getting shit on by straight bulls in this sub all week. Here comes the Covid dump. And my Wednesday spy puts are back in play.

It's rare, at least for me, to find a Democrat who rejects the extreme left. You are 100% spot on that Republican voters turned out because the far left had some extremely repulsive stances. To note, I'm a right wing, recent bachelor's degree holding farmer who voted for trump. Do I love his social media accounts? Naa. But I guess I look at other things to determine success. I urge you to try that! I appreciate your willingness to admit when something isn't right in your party...i try to do the same with mine

What options should I buy on open tomorrow that I can sell by EOW?
Going boomer on them. Bought Stonks... today. They literally keep going in waves it seems. 12 to 17 to 12 to 17 ext. Just gonna buy in and wait till it gets good then sell. Wait for the next wave of Corona bad news. O looky here. 12 dollar buys again. Wait a month. Fucking tired of getting burned by options. Ill just buy the stocks and it still does 40% gains off Vaccine news. So you still get a very good bump in money. Then just use that to buy the next dip.

What a dumb fucking question... ban! if any of us knew that we would be billionaires and not wasting our lives on this depraved subreddit. In any case, I‚Äôll try to answer ur other questions seriously. The ‚Äúbest option to buy to get the maximum reward‚Äù totally depends on a bunch of factors: time to expiration, underlying stock price movement and implied volatility. Generally ITM options yield relatively less profit because they are more expensive, but are also less risky whereas OTM options are higher risk higher reward. Monthlies are less risky than weeklies because there‚Äôs more time for it to get itm which also means you‚Äôre safer from theta decay for longer, but the catch is that they‚Äôre more expensive. It all comes down to how much risk you‚Äôre willing to take and how you believe the underlying stock of the option will change, and u buy accordingly. If you‚Äôre a degenerate retard and want to make a play that could potentially yield ‚Äúthe most‚Äù buy extremely out of the money options that expire within the week, that way if there is a huge price movement in the right direction before it expires  you might make like 1000+% returns. WARNING if u do this you WILL end up broke but the good news is that you then know for sure that u belong here
God, the stupidity on this sub is astounding.
This. It's an infinite problem with no one else attacking it directly. 

Yes, a Google or a Facebook is handling this sort of thing in house, for their own data, that they have total control over from collection to analysis. 

For every other organization with mountains of data, there's Palantir.

Every bear's argument is that they've been in business a long time and aren't profitable. The way I see it is that they started working on this 15 years before anyone else even realized it was a problem.  

Now, public and private orgs are finally seeing the problem and need the solution that Palantir has been investing in. They're going to be a powerhouse.
Heard of nio?
Good bot.

the first hour of MO is going be important, if TSLA break above 465 we could see new support there will be no major resistances until 538, ( 4 previous fail breakout since mid September). I could see it pull back to 455 for profit taking, 445 will be pivotal point though.
Bears r fuk
Wtf, this isn‚Äôt Robinhood
You woke up from a coma ?
Yeah if it doesn‚Äôt then I‚Äôll just adjust the buy order. Would be fun if it did though
Are you me?
serious question, should i buy $12k worth of tesla shares at open and how much do you think that will net me within the day or week?

Yea I literally started on Friday but I already have 1000000% returns. This is easy!

You could always buy back your call haha
dude... youre a fucking legend
Yeah the fuq was that shit. I sold my weeklies like 5 minutes before close by my monthlies aren‚Äôt going to be happy
You and me both brother
If I end up getting a NIO call at open I‚Äôll record my screen and show you how easy it is

Few people use proper grammar texting. Hell even engineers use whatever grammar as long as the message comes across as long as it is not with clients or official reports.

Also heard, lot of the early employees have options that might expire soon. Hence, pushing this thing public ASAP.

aid or cannibalize, that's the question.  Short term anyways.  Mid-long yes it'll help other EV's.

I got 10 puts on CCL for this Friday

You and I both know Tesla is much superior to NIO
RIP
Funds that track s&p have to buy shares. Since they track the s&p, they didn't own tsla until inclusion.
People were smarter and funnier
Thx, as poor retards we really appreciate hearing about a professional even more retarded than most of us. Your dad has the right idea but timing is everything and stimi ain't coming that quick. Also what kind of pro yolo's? I plan to make similar plays as your dad, but not yolo and not until atleast late december. Everyone knows the orange man is on strike.

No charger port for NIO...
You need to swap the battery for a new charge.
Wait in line every day.

No home charging.

Also, you pay a monthly fee for battery swap forever.

Its going moon. Get out with gains of you can. Stock went up ~10% today
Lol who knows. They yaddy yaddy yadda'ed over that part
Man... inverse all his positions
leaps are just for long calls in general.  Specifying max time means it's the farthest out as possible.
Recognize that this has NO EFFECT on Tesla as a company long term except making the P/E even worse for future years.

If you are meme flipping the stock, congrats on the win. If you are holding for the long haul, this is pricing in stock movements and has nothing to do with Tesla the business.
That's fine. I wanted something stupid to buy w/ my last 20$ on my Robinhood account.
I know there's a lot of fakery and hidden stuff, but according to the recent 13F, Uncle Warren's est. paid price is $251/shr for SNOW. I thought he got in pre-IPO. Heavy ass bags, to have 1.5B in that.
Because the market is retarded. Everyone knew it was a matter of time
I'd be dying if next Monday JNJ announces they have a 45% efficacy vaccine and the market limits down lmfao

You can be like me and buy a massive FD minutes after open then hover over the ‚Äúsell‚Äù button as losses mount more quickly than you could have ever imagined. Then cancel the order when you see a sliver of a green candle before a BIG MF RED CANDLE drops and you‚Äôre down 50%.
But tomorrow it‚Äôs not in s&p and IV will be thru the roof...
I was a üåàüêª before, but then I met CBAT and it's got me thinking differently about my sexuality. Appreciate the gesture though.

The only one that has a shot at this is C, but even then that's not happening.

U can always start with spreads to see how IV mechanics work with very little money. I know it‚Äôs tempting to just buy calls/puts, but understanding why something might go up/down/sideways & u lose/make cash & not wonder why is key.
Nope TSLA news push NIO upward.

Wait until Wednesday morning, grab some panic sold/profit taking calls with the reduced IV on the way up
If you think about it logically, think about the supply chain of their income.  Are vehicles not backed up on preorders?
Are they not generating billions in profits quarterly?
Is the gap between their income and investment into infrastructure getting bigger or smaller?
There is good & bad debt.  In what would does a company that's smashing it in a global pandemic risk running out of cash?  They're not operating at a loss.  They didn't slow their growth.  They're becoming more profitable and growing faster.
You know an argument is lost when you try to take personal jabs at the credibility of the other person.

> **My question is** I did 950 trades this year and ill keep it under 1,000, I have realized wash sale of 15k and realized gains of short term on 7k. My income with stocks and work combined is 26k. What is the best advice any of you guys can give me, ill certainly not trade this much moving foward. Also, for RH I went from $100 to $1500 at one point back in March and now only up $80 dollars on the year, if I put $100 in RH and bring my YTD to -20 do I still pay taxes. Please and thank you, I need some insight 

Did I miss the question mark?  What exactly is your question?  

Nevermind - just have your parents claim you as a dependent again.  Problem solved.
So stay the course, rodger
Set a morning buy order for some TSLA 11/18 700c. Hoping some moron doesn‚Äôt adjust their sell order by market open so I can get easy gains
What if NIO wasn‚Äôt real and only existed in the matrix
I believe Lithium is not the main focus since it can be obtain very easy, you should look at Nickel stock instead.

That's what I was thinking, they have a new "tab-less" battery technology  that could be a game changer. But like Nio, not much revenue yet. At least I make bank today!

I think so
Because that is more debt. You are a new trader aren't you? This is very common upon S&P500 inclusion. Tesla can burn all the cash in no time. They risk running out, but they don't if they shutdown. That is what they mean by constrained. It happens with **ALL** large company inclusions.

I am not saying it won't run up, but it isn't going to be squeezed. When the announcement comes out many bull very OTM call holders will be in shambles.

New Kohl‚Äôs commercial is depressing af üò≠üò≠
You sold S H A R E S of TSLA at the bottom of a channel, sitting on tonnes of support, after a massive consolidation... you don‚Äôt even belong here.
That's not how finance works. The purchase price of XLNX is already locked in (at least relative to AMD share price). The price is now solely dependent upon perceived % probability that the transaction closes (and what AMD share price does, since purchase is 100% in shares of AMD). Sure, there is downside for the passive funds that match the S&P500 index as they would be forced to sell the shares, but because of merger arbitrage, funds and buyers would step in to buy those shares

At end of day, doesn't affect AMD.
Does anyone ever get some positive echo chamber comments from guys in here, but then you dig into their recent comments and realize they‚Äôre completely retarded so you don‚Äôt feel that good about your positions anymore? Oh just me?

4. Which companies moved out / moved the majority of their assets out of the US?
5. Which company reclaimed or bought-back a large share of their stocks within the year?

Okay.
Why would Elon dilute himself rather than taking a loan for tesla at low interest rates?
They said in their call that they aren't cash constrained anymore, their constraint is talent.  Good people to hire

Big companies issue capital raises before s&p500 inclusion.  Tesla will likely issue the largest in history.

&#x200B;

"For all you new traders who do not think there will be a new capital raise by TSLA, you need to think again. It is very common for big companies to do with when included in the S&P500. Two examples for you, Google and Facebook. Tesla will likely issues one of the largest capital raises in history.

Saying it won't be very na√Øve. Tesla also needs as much capital as it can get to expand its exponential growth which the stock currently has priced in.

Also big money already bought up large reserves of TSLA for the inclusion. It was not if they were include, it was when.

It may run up, but get out when you are up as you may get burned very bad when they issued a capital raise. This is your warning."

Tech outperforming S&P500 on futures is actually bullish. Underperformance would be indicative of a crash, similar to the dotcom bubble.

Cohen wants the company to make changes. They weren't giving him any support in private talks so he is going public to force the issue. It's possible he could begin a takeover. Many funds seem to be changing their outlook and buying in, so presumably they would support him.

Nope. Many have large reserves. Go look it up.

Tesla is also planning another capital raise. They need more money than they have to do all they want to do at the rate they want.

Companies that are added to the S&P 500 have lately seen just a little bump but Tesla is the ultimate meme so it‚Äôll double in 3 days.
Nah bro you good
Bullish
I‚Äôm thinking that 500c will open at least $400 tmrw, but 20% day will blast us to 550. Post the color of your lambo later
Apparently there are 5 quali's for getting removed.  These are guidelines, but these are great starters! 

Here are those 5 reasons:
The first is that the S&P is a large-cap index, and they generally want companies to be above $5.3 billion in order to stay on there.



The stocks need to have traded at a minimum of 250,000 shares over a 6-month period leading up to the evaluation. 



They must be domiciled in the U.S. They define this in various ways. They have to file a 10-K, and then, they say you have to have a plurality of revenue and assets that are based in the U.S., or your headquarters must be in the U.S.



The company must have a public float of at least 50% of their stock.  Meaning at least 50% is actively tradeable



last one, which is financial viability. This is probably the most common reason for stocks to get delisted, is that there's something fundamentally wrong with them....they have to have positive earnings over the last four quarters, and they have to have good credit ratings. They just have to seem like a fundamentally sound business in general.

Well at least I have Tesla shares. I bet every call under $550 is up a few hundred percent.
Start off with COVID casualties that are big companies that will rebound in the next year for some solid long term free money and diversity. Do the green dildo hunt once in a while for massive gains.

And of course invest in every meme stock on this sub.

Covid vaccines will be in use for years. The companies who are first will have a very tiny window of being the only players, if any window at all. mRNA vaccines are an unknown because it's new tech. AZN is creating an old fashioned vaccine. I know if I had a choice, I'm going with the AZN version. I'm not going to be a guinea pig for mRNA vaccines.

What is the usual bump for a stock after SP 500 inclusion?
To the fucking üåö
There was a big 30% sell-off in September, from $500 to $350, when the S&P index committee excluded Tesla.

I believe that was much of the short term S&P 500 inclusion trade unwinding to a large degree. It didn't build back since then.
Fun fact, spy was at 322 on 10.30....less than 2 weeks ago
I've been watching GME's decline for years now and it's frankly retarded that it ever recovered from the covid dip.  It should have gone bankrupt.  This dude's right.
Presumably Tesla will sell-off after inclusion, which will now directly affect the S&P

By extension, the S&P will be dragged down during that time period\\

Etsy is a  fairly good indicator since it is one quarter ahead
Of course... everyone will buy these ones "on sale" for Christmas and then they'll release a "new one" in March and the sheep will buy it  both times lol
Probs gonna use amazon more if it starts raining missles tbh

Tesla is generating more net income than they can spend. 

Big money bought it, and sold it. They bought around 100m prior to the last run up and sold it when it didn‚Äôt happen
Futures look exactly the same as last Monday. Like fucking to the T. Tuesday is gonna be barely down and that will be the "red" day.
No one could have known?! Everyone knew it was just a matter of time before Tesla was admitted to SpY
I own some SPY in my Roth so I guess I don‚Äôt have to FOMO into TSLA calls tomorrow?

They're benefiting from this climate, and a bunch of multiyear headwinds have recently been at least partially lifted. They're digesting their Aetna debt well, and because Covid is decreasing costs for Aetna they're more profitable. Looking like there wont be some crazy change to the healthcare industry as dems dont have the control they need to push through legislation, and finally and most importantly short term they will benefit from both the rotation out of tech, and any news pumps about a vaccine. CVS will go up for every time a pharma company pumps their vaccine. So we're like 2/9 pumps so far and all the above combined means $700 EOW ez pz lemon squeezy

Uhh yes. Especially if you want shares then how about you actually use calls for their intended reason. 
Get 2022 and 2023 calls. 

Calls will always be less capital than shares. Much more bang for your buck. 

And don't go out of the money call either.  Deep ITM LEAPS or else you're just gambling unnecessarily.

Wrong. Mods ban
They should be up pretty good. Depending on when you bought your calls, I would be surprised if the JAN calls opened at anything less than 80% gain from todays close.

The IV spike alone might make it worth selling them sometime soon (before IV drops again) and waiting for things to quiet down a bit.

But honestly I think this is going to be a multi-day move so IDK when the right time would be to sell

Although, up until this year TSLA was a go to. Got burned real good around 900 last go around, pre split. Still batting .800 all time up to that point. Haven‚Äôt touch it since & glad. GL!

I was wrong in a righter direction!
Which funds? Most big funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 (11.2 trillion dollars) are underweight TSLA.

The passive index following funds (5.1 trillion dollars) are zero weight TSLA currently.

Thanks for the reply. Is it even worth holding a call for that long then? Wouldn't stocks be better in that case?
Anyone here wise in options trading? How much do you think TSLA $450 Dec 24 calls will be up tomorrow? How about $600 Jan 15 calls? I have roughly \~$10K in both as of close today.
That‚Äôll be $100 tomorrow, so 1 bj at Wendy‚Äôs

Bought at 420.69, and gonna sell at 694.20
There‚Äôs a lot of misinterpretation imo that conflates Kang Gang with theta gang. 

Kang Gang profits off *volatility*. Wild swings in both directions, cashing out at the peak of each swing. Whether that‚Äôs inter-day or intra-day. 

Theta Gang can *also* profit off *intraday* volatility, if *close* is flat. *Inter-day* volatility can fuck them though. All that matters is that when everything is done for the day, *the stock is back where it started*. 

So Theta Gang‚Äôs *goal* is an environment with little overall movement, but they can thrive in a Kang Gang environment due to the high volatility spiking premiums and still profit as long as volatility is intra-day and not inter-day.

45k-53k gain.
broke fuckwits like me, i guess. My thing was that CCL was down like 80% from where it was pre-covid, and I expected that EVENTUALLY when pandemic life is over and things begin to go back to normal, all the surviving cruise customers are going to be do goddamn desperate to get out of their shitty towns that they will be frothing at the loins to get on a cruise. it's already proven true... people literally dying to go on a cruise before it's actually reasonably safe. 

i figure if the cruise companies can survive long enough, their stocks will see a huge resurgence. my position when i bought a bunch of CCL back in august was basically that I'd either get rich or go down with the ships.

but now i think im just going to sell every time there's drug news, then wait for it inevitably to get fucked up by worsening covid cases or failed drug trials that come out like 3 days later.

Sample size too small
Same as it always has played out with large company inclusions into the s&p500.
I'm balls deep in NIO and didn't have any spare change to play with TSLA on, but mad respek for y'all TSLA stalwarts. It's been a grim couple weeks and y'all deserve this win.

PLTR is almost like a government agency, they do massive data analysis to help agencies like ICE. So kicking out mexicans.  Unless the incoming administration abolishes ICE and the like PLTR will probably do good.  They do also have some pretty popular open-source development tools.

Thiel does have mad super-villain vibes though, I dont fuck wit him
It's hard to tell a quality product sometimes. A majority of the time the higher price will reflect quality, although sometimes not at the desired ratio
There's a lot of meat left on BABA, and it's getting meatier the lower it goes. So meaty in fact it will take weeks for it to rot.
Link?
I've never traded on any more solid intel than this.
Attacking Iran would almost certainly draw them in. 

Look how fucked Syria is over a regional struggle between middle eastern states. Iran is 100x more important than Syria. Don't forget Israel in the mix, along with their de facto allies Saudi Arabia. Turkey is also acting like the Ottoman Empire.
>I am wondering if they already knew and have been accumulating while TSLA was just floating...

Very unlikely, volume has been very low lately, there was no 100m-200m shares of net buying pressure LOL.

It would also be insider trading & would leak and spike up the price.

If it makes you feel any better back in March I bought a $5 snap call 1/15/21 for $750 and sold it for $700. It‚Äôs been worth over $5000 this monthüò´
Let me guess you bought calls today at the top of an insane rally
My theory is that one of the biggest reasons Trump started the trade war to reverse the course of interest rates. If you remember back in early 2018 the Fed was set on raising rates and Trump tweeted a storm about it. Only when he started the trade war did interest rates get lowered..... just some food for thought.

Also If Biden were president at that time I guarantee you that he would have done nothing to stop the interest rate increases.
A lot of our friends that like red charts here live in SF
I‚Äôm making so many good plays it‚Äôs almost unreal
Hmmm I can either sell my $80 call tomorrow for like 2.2k or wait until 500 and get like 5k....what do
Me too fellow autist. Made 2.8k from thursday to friday and sold before the drop, bought calls today at open and plan on selling tommorow when my nuts tell me too.
All these üåàüêÇsaying blood futures dont mean anything when they predicted last tuesdays blood fest
Neither both are mostly homeless dumps and only getting worse

If it makes u feel any better, I sold 300 shares at $350...pre-split. Made $50/share. While I feel like kicking myself but I am not, as I needed the money. I am back for Papa Musk and I will go with Ramen first before I sell again. 
Luckily, I bought 3 calls today morning all at $420 strike. Two for 2/2021 and another for 9/2022. Tendies time :)
Realll ass
these will be like 15k (total) tomorrow, unless it continues to run up like crazy.

Yeah but those are only basic pumps. Only way you could‚Äôve lost that much is if you bought into the hype late.

You have to be downright silly to end up with bags that big on penny stocks.

It's part of the simulation bro. Take a break so they stop tracking you
I hold leaps for NIO.  I'm just calling what I think is going to happen.  After the run up NIO had, there has to be some shaky hands.  That vs Tsla which is 99% for sure to go up in the near and mid term.
Prestige pricing... higher priced items are perceived to have more value to lower priced items. In the eyes of said beholder it probably makes them feel special to have something higher priced.

i'm afraid that i no longer have any faith in bears to break any meaningful support in this euphoria.
Will TESLA being added to the SPX mark the top?  


No. The top happens when S&P500 cash tags 3666.69

buy as many shares as you can afford at open, you're late but 600 EOY is very likely now. It's hard to overstate how big a deal S&P 500 inclusion is, it's the equivalent of like a 30% buyback

This guy is unstable. He wants to go out with a bang. Remember in January when they assassinated the Iranian general and markets dipped and bears here thought it was WWIII and the begining of the great market crash to end the 10 year bull run. Iran chickened out, then corona hit.

Calls on heavy metals
Did any of you see CBAT today? At one point it was up 104% and was up 65% Friday, Will it crash like Nio or be the next Tesla?

Come on VIX jump up and give me a kiss tomorrow please!
he was tweeting a lot of sp jokes, i though it was bs
My DD was looking at last weeks chart and being like yeah this is essentially gonna be the same thing. I have a feeling rotating into tech  will even hit sooner because of the tsla inclusion in the s&p but I‚Äôm retarded. Who the fuck wants to own ccl when you can buy into tsla now
Yeah, personally I sell half on the big overnight jumps. Let‚Äôs you chill out and manage an early dip and also not get depressed if it moons.
If it ever sees those levels again
This is insane. Good for you. You've danced with the devil and you've lived to tell about it. Congrats and fuck you and your wife's bf.

I prefer cowgirl, this way I can watch futures on my phone at the same time
wouldn't that hurt AMD indirectly?
Im in if you are
Ok but if you‚Äôre not in already, and things are going red. There‚Äôs profit to be made by shorting is what I‚Äôm getting at
Flair checks out
Missionary is hella underrated. Whoever considers it boring doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing or is a virgin.
I need AMD to continue to climb tomorrow. 11/27 86.5 C.
What the fuck is diversify?

The key is to buy high sell low
Iv was super low you idiot cause no one was expecting any move
[removed]
super happy for you bro... but when i first saw this screenshot, I thought it was 260 calls. lol. Still, nice gains
God damn i love you retards!!! Started this shit with 4k and have been up 10k and down 8k at different times. You degenerate crumbs keep me always coming back for more. Fuck the result, its all about the ride. This beers for you, you god damn beautiful animals.
WhY iSnT tEsLa InClUsIoN pUsHiNg Up SpY
After the pretty decent run up from Nio tommorow going to get some leaps hope for a index squeeze that they‚Äôre all talking about in late December gonna maybe shoot for Jan or February babies GL to all
[deleted]
To Valhalla! Also how did this news suddenly come out with no rumor or notice where they changed their mind about inducting Tesla into the S&P 500. Sounds like they were trolling
I like the blue line just chilling.
I'm putting my entire paycheck in BABA tbh. Beijing biden is gonna be great for BABA owners
SOLO..I feel ya
Close the low side, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll slide back down.
Lol I would have taken you seriously but the fact you ID NIO in the title as clickbait tells me you have puts and have lost money on TSLA over last few weeks.
Why? What's your position?
Wow the bears are out early tonight. Calling for a very red tuesday when futures are down .3% at 9 üò≠üò≠üò≠
You think new one coming out though?
Hey at least u have a free stock maybe it will be worth 38,000,000
[deleted]
So is it worth to jump into TSLA first thing tmw or nah too late
I‚Äôve got a bigger account than you lol
Oh oh
why do you think
Someone tell these dumbasses selling /ES Tesla is coming, they clearly have not heard the news
Probably your soul

Cool you can now buy my used panties :)
Assole shape
It‚Äôs the water proof factor lol seriously Apple are evil geniuses
Hey can somebody ask what TSLA will be of EOD or EOW???? Nobody has asked that so far.
why is everyone comparing this to Tesla?

Do you Buy Chinese sneaker brands?
I bought NVDA at 540 two months ago, I fucking hope so lmao
Proceed with carpet bombs...
To be honest this is the most interest bear thesis I've read so far, do you have macro-economic data offhand to support some of this? 

> Because banks aren‚Äôt lending. In fact they‚Äôre tightening their lending standards, similar to what happened in the housing market crisis.

How does this reconcile with [record home sales lately?](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf) Is the argument that it's mainly "good mortgages" being approved right now? 

> This is evident in the reduction of foreign purchases of Treasury bonds. They need the dollar, so they‚Äôre not going to buy as many Tbonds and reduce their reserves.

Maybe I am not looking at the right data, but [doesn't this show that foreign ownership of Treasury securities are up YoY since 2019?](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt).

> Catastrophic deflation ensues.

Either way, wouldn't the effect sizes have to be much larger than what we're seeing for deflation at a level that has the sort macro-economic implications you're talking about?
Eat shit I literally have 24 different options positions open right now I‚Äôm just trying to diversify with some comfy value leaps for 2021 because that‚Äôs what will outperform. Travel already pumped and tech is overpriced.
Say what?! How did I miss this?
Ass
i break even
Idk if NIO is dipping lol. Straight shot today
Do they have active noise cancellation like the AirPods Tho?
Oil keeps looking all set up for success. The supply gets a little tight; OPEC start to get froggy; prices start to go up...then shale drillers put a 205 mm string up your ass and plug it with #4 cement.

Just fuck it, there is no way to win in oil with how fast shale rigs can come online. It's down to fucking hours. Literally hours from bare ground to producing pad, it's absurd.

Yeah exxon will be fine but they'll be treading water for a long time, indefinitely really.
I hope this is a joke dude that‚Äôs the worst stock to run a condor on üòÇ you‚Äôre gonna get exercised
Why tomorrow after it‚Äôs gone up over 10%. Everyone and their mother knew it would soon be added to S&P 500, they just denied it last time because it was too volatile.
Fuck your Graham Stephen, I hope your mouth is getting dry in Las Vegas. Also, Tai Lopez always opens my DMs and leaves me on read so fuck that guy too
I was waiting for it to dip but too late now, I will get in soon
Zm ded already. Now go up
If I can go back time ‚è≤Ô∏è and do this
I want to go all in on whatever chemical they are using to make people retarded
meme of black man sweating (hindenburg) and two buttons one says NIO and one says TSLA
So if they are doing an offering, wouldnt this be generally bearish
Sell the news once it‚Äôs listed ferrrrr sherrrrr 


Until then brs r fkd
Honestly, wieners.
Their getting cheap for Christmas.
No, you're just poor.
Some shitty oil and gas company you‚Äôve never heard of or some shitty retailer you never visit is going to get booted
The parents of many big s&p500 funds already own alot of Tesla in anticipation of this. It was only a matter of when, not if.
Gg
Well could easily be Xilinx or Tiffany‚Äôs. Both are getting acquired, although Xilinx more likely given its $30B market cap and is a tech company
??

I got them for .82 cents
I actually converted a quarter mil of shares today into max time 500 strike leaps.

everyone is saying TSLA will issue capital raise of may be 10 billion and the stock will go down...
what more momentum do you need on Tesla? It mooned AH and 99% of wsb is talking about it
I won‚Äôt ban you at r/photolinks
You lucky fucker, I remember your thread but didn't pull the trigger, so instead I sold 500c weeklies for 0.15. FML.
Sir, let me show you the way to r/smallstreetbets
I read that the max profit could not be calculated. ToS simply says the max P is the cost of the spread. Does that sound right?
It's definitely low class.
If theres anything I learned this past 3 weeks is to buy the fucking dip
Hope so for you. I‚Äôm jacked to the tits on CROX weeklies.

 For all you new traders who do not think there will be a new capital raise by TSLA, you need to think again. It is very common for big companies to do with when included in the S&P500. Two examples for you, Google and Facebook.

Saying it won't be very na√Øve. Tesla also needs as much capital as it can get to expand its exponential growth which the stock currently has priced in.
Yep, they used to be better in tijuana, used to...
He'll ya. JETS and AAL puts take the wheel!
I have 47 shares and am holding until at least 2025, but going for 2030. I might sell a share here and there to take advantage of something else that comes up. Trying to start stocking up on ChargePoint (SBE) as I think they are gonna grow a lot long term. 

Currently holding 47 Tesla, 31 NIO, and 5 (SBE) that I bought today.
Because index funds which track SPY need to buy Tesla now
Wait whaaaaa
hes on here so... Are you retarded?

Yup and I‚Äôm buying puts

That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm here for either. Just be interesting and/or correct and it comes as a byproduct. COVID is not overblown.

It‚Äôs not overblown.

A new car is usually not worth it unless you‚Äôve got the cash to burn. The route I took with my last car was getting the same model year but slightly used with like 5k miles, which saved me like 12k off sticker. Then got the bumper to bumper warranty extended to be in place (with a $100 deductible) as long as I own the vehicle for another $2k.

Bought like 2 days ago. Sorry you didn‚Äôt get in man ):
Probably not entire amount. \~10 billion is likely. Many big funds already bought in earlier and AH today.
Just go ahead and do it yourself.  You're already a bitch.

Remember, Trading is very different from investing. Don‚Äôt trade with money that you aren‚Äôt willing to lose.
why are futures blood red
I am not an expert by any means hahaha. If you go broke that's your fault for listening to me.

I was holding a lot of QCOM before this. Right now the only stock I'm invested in is PLTR, got cash on the sidelines tho. I'm waiting for election to finish playing out, COVID hysteria to settle down, then I'll drip my cash back in.
EOD tomorrow. popped 13% AH
Seriously, and obviously NIO is going to be priced cheaper than TSLA in the future. Not to mention the Chinese market that may prefer NIO over TSLA.

I sold my TSLA long stonks at a 33% loss in April.

Eh not as bad but I sold 10 500c weeklies, prob will close it out tomorrow.
Shit‚Äôs crazy overbought right now but 330 EOW would take some major event that‚Äôs not already priced in
It hit 30000 last week. Just post the video already I wanna see your butt
Haha this was when neopets were poppin. I think I was like 5 when I was browsing shit like geocities.
Please drive it down. But why all the volume AH?

Do u know how much I would cum?
If Cohen try‚Äôs to buy gme, all the institutions holding gme will take back the shares they loaned out. They do this to get more voting power. If this happens 67 million shares will be ‚Äústolen‚Äù from the shorts causing a huge increase in price of gme, and possibly(probably) start a short squeeze

Gold standard is short hand for the natural development of money - you said you'd read Rothbard, so you'd know what book he wrote about how money developed and how inflation occurred even in metal coins, and steps taken to try to prevent it. But there's a very clear, logical explanation there of what money IS, and why fiat destroys value.

I understand the argument for liquidity - it was Milton Friedman's critique of the failure of the Fed to act during the lead-in to the Great Depression. But, I also understand that giving the Fed the power to inject liquidity is giving them the same tool that inflates bubbles massively, allows governments to finance the military industrial complex, and lets them blow up markets like housing and higher education to the detriment of middle and lower income people.

Why would Tesla leave the nasdaq
seems like a fair trade. elon gets covid and TSLA goes brrr
Wait til tomorrow
For real.  If TSLA goes parabolic it might have the craziest P/E out there and people will still buy it.

Not sure if I want red or green tomorrow. 95% of my portfolio is in calls, but the rest is in SPY 363/364 credit spreads, the only position I have expiring this week.

Is it just me or did the price of air pod pros just drop?

I got a bad feeling about tomorrow. To many good things today and after hours. Whenever this happens I get disappointed in the morning

My prediction for this Ryan Cohen GME thing. If, and IF he was going to think about buying out gamestop, wouldn't it be smart to drive the stock price as low as possible? He got in around $6 and if he gets other major players on board he may try to influence the stock price lower before he or they even try to think about buying it out - why pay a premium? Just a thought.

Dude I‚Äôm honestly really sorry and don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but I‚Äôve probably left $25M on the table in the last 6 years and so have tons and tons of profitable traders. You just can‚Äôt let it get to you. Don‚Äôt quit, and don‚Äôt revenge trade. Just be patient and let your blood turn to ice water. The fact that you were even bullish on TSLA means you have some fucking capacity to pick winners. Buy back in and hold long term. Don‚Äôt pass up Elon‚Äôs free money for all of us.

I'm still making up my mind about this specific case; good to hear other opinions.

I'll counter that when I played West Pharmaceutical after its inclusion this summer,
price barely budged. That's more typical after inclusion, per this Forbes quote of a S.A. analysis:
*"An analyst on S------ A---- looked at 61 stocks that have been added to the S&P 500 since 2016. He found that in the 30 days after the inclusion, only 60% of them rose. And in all, the average stock went up just 1.2%."*

([Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danrunkevicius/2020/07/21/tesla-stock-could-soar-as-much-as-64-but-not-for-sp-500/?sh=3ac927432be3))

OTOH, Berkshire Hathaway had a nice 25% run after its inclusion in 2010 before giving back all of the gains within a couple months.

Overall, there will be high liquidity, and with Nio reporting and high retail interest, this is definitely a bullish tradable event I'll look to participate in.
And these companies don't make a profit and sell a few thousand cars a year...yet here we are.
If you think this thing is overblown you are a useless hermit or an autist who doesn‚Äôt know anyone. Take your choice.
Start with these books:

Marijuana bulls are fucking short sighted yet think they have the sight. Marijuana will always be black market profitable as long as states want to milk vendors and growers. The price for an 8th of the good shit is cheaper with the local plug than the dispensary and due to Colorado having an excess spilling everywhere, the legal cartels will never reach that estimated industry level. If legalized nation wide it would crush dispensaries because one plant can produce enough bud so satisfy 1 person for a while and 3 can keep you in a cycle of not running out. 300 grams per plant. That‚Äôs 150 blunts at 2 blunts per day that‚Äôs 75 days. If you plant them on 2 weeks off setting you can have a steady supply all year and you can trade strains with friends.

Come back mid december and look at the SP in the mid to high 500's.  Maybe even in the 600's
Does anybody even have any tesla calls left? You‚Äôd think it‚Äôs all in Nio by now
u/17sentme is literally a child.
wtf... how about S&P actually buying the sht? 100 bln+ worth of stock buy from S&P as it tracks 11 trillion and TSLA will be 1.1%. Musk ain't about to raise that much. The actual buy is gonna moon the stock.
Can we get a fucking red day tomorrow? Virgin Galactic you have zero revenue, who is buying this garbage. Not profitable
Now go reverse all these trades with real money.
If that was true, the S&P would have presented multiple options on how to have tracking indexes buy so much of the stock
Hope all ev stocks go up. Even Nikola so I can buy puts for it.
Krokodil
buy the rumor, sell the news. Secure your profit.

I wonder how many one-child families are buying an SUV that carries as many people as a battleship.
Who else thinks that NIO was propped up to distract us from TSLA?
Imagine dating in the the year 2000. You pull up to your gf‚Äôs apartment who just cheated on you and you bring out your Song Walkman and start break dancing to Bye Bye Bye by NSYNC.
I'm convinced Nio is gonna moon off TSLA. Just can't convince myself to pull the trigger.
The price and IV rising is based on speculation, it actually happened.  AH pump of 14% is nothing compared to tomorrow when the real volume happens.  I see atleast 500 SP by EOD tomorrow.
Ummmm
who here is old enough to remember geocities
I‚Äôm too pussy for calls, Stonks it is.
honestly, travel stocks and oil are the only real consistent winners from the pfizer test announcement a week back lol. pfizer is right back where it was damn near.

fortunately for me, I'm retarded and have been bagholding CCL stock in my Roth IRA for like 2 months. finally working out. unfortunately though, i have way more cash in inverse oil ETF (DRIP) than in the bullish ETF (GUSH). so im still getting fucked...
Thats why I am living in a van. No rent just investing and waiting for a electric van.
Damnit TSLA i ditched you and u do this
$300 max, each get a $100 treasury bond.
You'll hit 25k before this happens
üòÇ .9 is some paranoid shit. I feel you
I own TSLA but I‚Äôve been eyeing BABA. I‚Äôd hold.
Wish I could FOMO some Tesla FDs in the morning but I am out of daytrades.
I need to step up my gambling game
What does this mean?

NIO earning is tomorrow
Sooooo TSLA gonna rally through the next few weeks then?
I just wish you guys would listen to me and buy CVS instead of fucking NIO. like, hello
So are my KSS calls ripping tomorrow or am I going to have to speak to a manager?
Idk how likely it is tbh, but getting removed from DOW says a lot
TSLA being added to SPY will rawdawg this guy dudes puts.
um
Me too, had to use it first few times going to your moms place. Don‚Äôt need it anymore though
I have positions on both sides of tech but looking at the nasdaq futures, it looks like there is solid resistance at 12040. I don‚Äôt know about you guys but im seeing a bear flag...
Doubling from 30 to 60 dollars isn‚Äôt that big of a deal
Wut
That feel when you get lucky on buying calls today on tsla. Felt that price was consolidating for awhile + was on the low end of the console. 

Decision will be whether to sell at open or see if it pumps for a day or two. 

Congrats to all holding stock and calls

I received this offer too. You can only register now to show you‚Äôre interested in purchasing the IPO. 

Registration ends 11/20 but they have limited spots, so it‚Äôs first come first serve for host. The minimum purchase amount will be $300, there will be a maximum too but that amount is currently unknown.

They‚Äôre not sure of the price and are still waiting for proper valuation. The email states we will be receiving an email in early December with the official invite and further information. Registering now doesn‚Äôt obligate you to buy shares, but just shows you‚Äôre interested in the offer.

Holy fuck I didn‚Äôt realize this was you. Man you‚Äôre just on a string of retarded ass statements tonight.
Ur a god. Not going to lie waiting for that second hard dip so I can get a shot too lol well done brother
Alright fellas. Since NIO is hot and I see a ton of ‚ÄúdOIhOLdMYCaLLs/pUTStHRUer IV cRuSHhurrdurr...questions...Here‚Äôs one piece of mind. 

If you‚Äôre thinking to do an er play and planning to hold, pay the premium and buy itm. That way, if the play goes in your favor, IV will have MUCH MUCH less affect on your options, depending on how deep itm it goes (Vega). If you‚Äôre set on selling before er and work the run up, sure buy otm. I might do a detailed explanation of this on an actual post this week taking NIO as an example. Before and after Er. Just my two cents.
ü§°
Shares or calls
.9 and some pot and I‚Äôve never felt more thankful.
Lots of 13f‚Äôs included PLTR, explains the run up
Pre split tho. Don‚Äôt count.

Oh don‚Äôt worry. I pulled all my money out about a week before the election. So I‚Äôm sure things are guaranteed to keep rocketing in the meantime! Somehow managed to end almost two years of ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù with an 8% loss so just be sure to invert everything I do and you‚Äôll be fine üòÇ
The more in the money the call the higher the premiums.

I'm still sitting on the calls I bought Friday morning at ATH. I like watching the money disappear as a reminder of how big of an idiot I can be sometimes.

NIO 54c 11/20
Well some people have a ‚Äúdiamond hand‚Äù approach and once some options are down like 80% or more just decide to let it ride to see if a miracle happens since it‚Äôs almost gone anyway.

Are you day trading it
Would need to see deets... pre IPO purchases are usually locked into not selling for a specified amount of time. 

With covid bing an issue for at least another year idk that I‚Äôd want to hold Airbnb that long. 

That being said .. I feel the IPO will be huge .. it‚Äôs a huge name .. lots of meme potential .. will rally hard 

The question is for how long .. and will it hold
I had one of those that I sold today for a massive loss that I bought at 52 a share Friday, IV crush was fucking me up. Unless NIO skyrockets to 60 on Wednesday (which is possible) you are going to be IV crushed into the floor.
Don‚Äôt quit. This is something that happens all the time to people who are retarded like you and I. Gotta get used to it.

Do your self a favor and buy some $HAL, $KMI, $PSX, $MPP. Way more undervalued. If you want an oil major stick with $CVX (Chevron).

$XOM is a shithole oil major that has underperformed the others for years.

Positions: I own \~$10K a pop on all the above since August. Have been selling puts on them since June. Continue to sell weekly puts spreads.

True, $PLTR actually makes something and has a monopoly while $NIO outsources all manufacturing...

It‚Äôs all about that shvhardicvsm motors
yea but i‚Äôm looking for exposure to the others we‚Äôd been memeing as well
Yes. But maybe no.
Lol they released their bc opinion and enough people found it credible enough to sell on. What does that say about the stock?
Mo tooooo
Is it bad I want to hold
They should kick AAPL for the meme üçèüêª
NIU is NIO but with scooters
Nah, the market is already fucked because we as a collective market created a set of massive options waves in March. Look at OI on SPY monthlies. It's insane, both sides are spread out across a few hundred dollars centered right on 355 for the next few months and the MMs need to expire most of them. We've been cycling through it all and won't stop until OI on both sides is trimmed back to more manageable levels by this mathematical bucking bull of price trends as theta continues to do its thing and eat away at the players with the most risky options.

Missed out on probably about $70,000 gain on a $12,000 play...
I‚Äôm actually really jealous of those fgts making big money doing nothing but damn I feel shitty about myself just thinking about being a furu
not sure if this is how it works but a google search puts newscorp ( NWS )at the bottom of the index (by market cap.)
but if NWS still meet requirements for inclusuon, maybe they just add another. (theres already 505 tickers, no?)
also i am retard so could be completely wrong
Happy Cake Day CuriousNecklaceGuy! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return.

Lol, that‚Äôs a good one man. It gets added to the SPX so it just doubles in price? If that happens it will take a while. And by then AMZN will be even bigger. Jeff Bezos is worth 183b right now. You‚Äôre saying Elon will be worth 200b, and Jeff will just never gain more money? You‚Äôre delusional buddy

definitely hold tomorrow you will be rewarded
Sounds convincing af.. but doesn't the smart money know this? NIO calls sound like free money even if you FOMO into it tomorrow.
Makes sense
That's just the tapeworm
Dude fuck you for saying that, cause i just bought 100 shares AH, was feeling pretty smart for getting in early, even though it was expensive @460, now i feel like im going to baghold until infinity and beyond cause what you said make a lot of sense... it‚Äôs too easy to take advantage of market otherwise

Please tell me you didn't sell.
Those calls will be worth $80,000+ tomorrow if the price doesn‚Äôt dip overnight. I picked them up for about $12,000
XPEV is already guaranteed a boost over the next couple weeks with the price target increase. January + calls will be the move for that.
Love this sub. Does WSB print retards, or are retards drawn to WSB?
Citron has lost any credibility that piece of shit. "research" or trying to cover a short position cause you got fucked?

Question, why would someone let options expire if they can just sell them even at a loss? Isn‚Äôt a small loss better than total loss? 

I may be overthinking
Yes
Would it be retarded to buy Tsla calls at open and close them at the end of the day? Asking for an autistic friend
I think you mean Deutsche bank, not JPMorgan

Find out how long your pre-ipo shares are locked for and hedge against them with options
Hoping to suckle some decent NIO gains from the tips of the TSLA bulls massive throbbing dongs
I was referencing post-election rebounds. And no I don‚Äôt think that stat proves anything. And I‚Äôm glad you think the two parties can be compared over the last hundred years fairly. Because that proves you‚Äôre full of bullshit. Clinton was great with a republican congress and Bush was shit In all regards. Let‚Äôs agree on that.
Because there are so many interesting threads and I can't keep track of them all. Research purposes
It has, but not 20% on a weekly basis. There was one week where I was close to assignment, but hasn't happened yet.
Tastes different than used to
BA, SPR, TGI, HII, GD, and a shit load of hospitality plays.

Can‚Äôt believe I sold Tesla in July for 1500 and NIO for 11
I get it
These puts are about to print, I can feel it
I can‚Äôt see red anymore and the graphs look like a kaleidoscope so yes
If you like money, ride NIO into 55 tomorrow and secure the bag.
I kind of bought a bunch of 11/20 60c ....how fucked am i?I?

I found it retarded the last time they announced a capital raise, you retards bought very OTM calls. I made bank with puts.
Any moves tomorrow at market open?
They're all fake news if wikileaks are to be believed.
Yeah it's a 1% ROCE every week right now, maybe because the stock is hyped and so calls are expensive, but I'll do it as long as it works lol.
Robinhood would first need a real office.

Aren't they making an IPO soon?
Nice
I'm tired of spending all day on my phone, I just want to go to work
Maybe. Maybe not. Don‚Äôt even care to try to calculate it now cause anything can happen between now and market open. Almost all of my gains this year have been buying and selling deep OTM options.
FUK NQ 2 disastr stops tonight WTF!
Sounds like a GMILF
Tsla
Jesus bro. How much is that? I sold BA, TGI, SPR, ERJ, and a shitload of other hospitality plays too early last week. Seeing where they are now is like $5k I missed out on. But I don‚Äôt think I missed out on the amount you‚Äôre talking about. Stay strong.
Day traders don‚Äôt have charts like this, YOLO plays with diamond hands gets you these kind of gains. Dude just spun 00 on the roulette wheel like 50 times in a row and only missed twice
Lmao
Cha-fucking-Ching!!!! Sweet tits you lucky fucker!
I‚Äôm 100% gonna roll my puts up to take advantage of this.
Futures would be red as shit had they not announced Tesla joining the SPY
Haha hell yeah! What parts?
Spill it.. what was it? TSLA?
Is it to late to buy tesla?
Imagine WSB in the 1800s. 

In the quaint village of the Bulls, the colonizers were enjoying another positive day in the fields. One Bull family in particular, gathered more food than anyone else and signed 100 contracts with his neighbor that he has the right to buy his wife if her beauty increases by next week. He gets drunk and writes a letter to the Mayor of the village next door.

‚ÄúHaha Bears are deceased!‚Äù
Except u since u replied 10 minutes after ü§° just make sure you hold through earnings
Not enough. They will do another capital raise. Big money expect it. They need more to expand faster.
That‚Äôs amazing! I really hope something like that happens to me. Haven‚Äôt even been going out cuz I just come home from work and drink. Maybe I‚Äôll meet my wife soon.
against all the mega hype coming? You sure don't like money
Here you go my dude


IMPACT ANALYSIS

The table below shows the projected weight of TSLA in the S&P 500. Based on recent market capitalization figures, TSLA will be one of the largest weight additions to the S&P 500 in the last decade, and consequently will generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history. However, TSLA itself is very liquid, and adding the stock at the upcoming December quarterly rebalancing coincides with the expiration of stock options, stock futures, stock-index options, and stock-index futures, which may help facilitate the funding trade.

Stock: TSLA

Weight: ~1.01%

Estimated Funding Trade: ~$51 billion*

*The estimated funding trade is calculated using an estimate of % of assets indexed to the S&P 500 derived from S&P DJI‚Äôs Annual Survey of Assets As of December 31, 2019 multiplied by the approximate pro-forma weight of TSLA in the S&P 500 as of 11/13/2020.
VEGA GANG RISE!
Markets closed anyways get some sleep and yolo in the morning
Any good stock to sell puts on ? Only have 6k

A lot of funds are reflecting the S&P 500 with shares and need to buy into Tesla now.

Would appreciate it, thanks!
I didn‚Äôt understand why it was such a bad day for them either.
I sold NIO today at close... good move or bad move? Should I buy it at market open?
I want to find whoever started the bs Warren Buffet PayPal rumor this morning and ask them to do the same for RKT.

I used to
You selling delta 20 CC with 7-10 DTE? This retard knows the way. Welcome theta bruh
I don't even own tsla and I think its over valued as all fuck, doesn't change the fact TSLA will probably hit 1k a share after this shit making Elon worth roughly 200 bb
Yeah I mean it sounds like a cliche but it really is the hardest part. But you already did it! Everything else is just one day at a time
Same but 475 instead. Let‚Äôs goo
Shit is rigged they will say say for sure.

PLTR will continue stepping up
I want to see big boy info. Is trading view the play?
I was down like 30% on them and couldn‚Äôt afford to lose another 20%
I mean there‚Äôs losing the shares and then missing out on 12% increae
44.5p 11/20. It‚Äôs up 2400% in the last year. Way past 50 day moving average of ~26, and valued higher than GM despite a fraction of the cars it produces. There‚Äôs no numbers on ER that can justify its current price.
Real question is what IV are TSLA 11/20s opening at
Congrats man keep it up. My brother n law had the same problem and it was wrecking his life. He got sober and a year later met my sis and now they have been married for four years.
Fuck you, congrats
I still have faith in my 11/27 295c baba calls down 93%
Right now, listening to the CC
If you bought apple and Tesla in 2018 that‚Äôs nuts
I'm so excited for you fukkers and I don't even have any!   So, tomorrow I gotta buy SOMETHING....as long as it has one word from the phrase 'ET call home' and something about and iron being hot...oh yeah strike!   ...oh what it the stock symbol again?   Rhymes with best of?  Pizza? Vista?
They have different strengths im pretty sure. I assume gorilla would be your best bet. Mounting tape. Also make sure the door is wiped clean.
As usual, the money to be had is a couple steps ahead and/or sideways.  For example, NKLA will now tank over this as the retail idiots that just pumped it up will all flock to TSLA (using fractional shares of course).
when is the IPO?
Like CVS. But parabolic right now. Waiting on a pullback. No FOMO for CVS
I have nio 34c feb expiry, sell tomorrow or hold into the new year?????
Has it enhanced your trading abilities?
Wrong subreddit ya tard
How much did you spend to get back...
I would absolutely shit
Thanks for the well wishes, It's yolo or back to the bread line.
These are so far out of the money they probably won‚Äôt even be up much
Imagine if you sold naked calls today.
My fav drug is BENGAY.
A bunch of assholes met in person on the "stock floor" drunk and high on drugs, yelled at each other, and bought and sold stocks. We do the same online now.
Someone ban this newfag
Yes since tesla is not part of the smaller index, all the index funds that track s&p needs to buy at market price. If retail investors are not willing to sell any of their shares, that will create a lot of pressure resulting in price surge. Atleast for short term tesla will go up. Remember when yahoo announcement was made it went to fucking moon in the short term. Tesla easy 500 eow.
Buy puts on Expedia. AirBnB going to eat them for lunch
Anyone know how long options on RH take to settle for cash accounts? Is it T+2 or T+1? On WeBull it's T+1, or the following day. Closing a position on Monday would mean those funds are settled and available the next day. Literally unlimited Day Trades on WeBull. Does RH do this too?


I don't understand why more degenerates  don't use this, you can lose your money even faster this way combined with 0DTE. It is the way.
Could have paid for my law degree with the calls I had today. I‚Äôm going to remember this for a long time
sry i dont have insider info
I see you hate money
Tesla would have to rise 69% from the price it closed at today ($408) to reach $690. This is not a coincidence. All in 1/15/21 $690 calls
I keep getting dicked selling calls
Hey MMs thank you for not cucking tech based on good vaccine news :)
No. I‚Äôm still down.
This is a terrible graph. Good work
RH is HELLA predatory lol
It‚Äôs stale as fuck since September. But it is also a potential 10 baggee
[removed]
Plz do not go all in.
Niiiice
When will TESLA announce a new capital raise for more exponential growth and to allow big money funds in on the stock? I want to buy puts when this happens.
[removed]
Why‚Äôd you go and do that
Literal sickness is what you feel after selling something too early and she gaps the fuck up literally the next day or two after. I‚Äôm gonna be fucking sick.
Should have invested in TSLA instead!!!
Dumb
You want to see a picture of her?  https://imgur.com/ZXMaaEd
I have too many EV bags and I don't know how I'll sleep tonight. Sorry to be a little bitch but I'm not holding through NIO ER. I'll have a stroke
idk i always find store stocks like these to moon after good ER since MM like to dump on us FD's all the time

kinda like what they do to costco
TSLA 52 Wk High - 502.49

TSLA 52 Wk Low - 65.42
In March I got a darth Vader on a unicorn tattoo cause I said I would get it if disney printed me money this time ill get a concept of your choice if nio prints me enough to get one üòâ lets get those ideas rolling boys
What time are NIO earnings?
I bought TSLA 465 December 4 call today :D
Kick them both out. Fake news
What‚Äôs the best TSLA play for tmr morning?

Buy shares or calls right away? Seems it‚Äôll increase a lot throughout the day
a chaotic and volatile ride to zero
I agree let‚Äôs figure it out and short the fucker
Depends on the price, really. It's strange that they offered before they knew the price.
*wipes tears with dividends*
I know they‚Äôre meme stocks but are KCAC and PLTR still worth the buy? Seems to have settled and prime for the picking
Let me join you.
[deleted]
Managed to FOMO'd 3 shares (even though i bought 2 at 409 earlier today) because my father called me a dumbass for not buying the other 3. (Not a brave enough boy to tackle calls and purs yet)
So I‚Äôm too pussy for TSLA calls...should I just drop another 6k tomorrow am on stonks?
How see the COVID stocks going to respond with more shut downs, but with vaccine news dropping in? PTON, ETSY,ZM,PINS.. etc. I dont know how to place this.
He‚Äôs 90 years old and senile
Yes
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
VIAC?
It's okay man, I nearly put $6.5k down on 450c 12/31 but guess who backed out like a bitch
I‚Äôm tits deep in 36p 11/27 and 12/4. I‚Äôm playing the likely sell-off once MRNA hopium wears off. But when i saw TSLA got the nod, i figured it only makes sense that this dinosaur would get replaced by the hallmark of clean energy, esp since it got booted from DOW for a tech company
I think Pfizer though
easy to hold when you've already lost it all lol
Have some in the retirement fund already
Yawn, when‚Äôs RBLX?
I think I saw that Buffet just dumped the entirety of his costco stake. Does that worry you at all?
Congrats for real. Keep it up.
as long as it doesn't happen tomorrow... no need to worry. just ride.
i mean i guess when you're looking at a 95% loss and contracts are a few cents, you might as well hold... on the off chance that there's a 2% jump on opening one day and you can sell for like, 50% loss on portfolio instead of 100% lol.
1% of the index is 305 billion
You made it bold like this news didn't come out 4 hrs ago
yo DOCU is scaring me I bought at 200 back in Julyish and a lot of price movement its looking stale
I think I understand your pain. Guh.
Now that your saying it I'm assuming it's gonna go down real quick. Fuck.
Whomever makes Xanax and codeine, I pop them shits like it‚Äôs candy yuh yuh


/s
I already have shared. Next.
This opens Tesla up to more institutional investors. Think etfs and mutual funds that track sp 500
I love people who comment on deleted posts , real dedication.
Why would you want to buy the shares?
You need funds. Most people just trade the premium. Sell when it's worth more.
News Corp is on S&P 500 twice. Kick one of them out
FTI. DUH
Uhh what were you thinking?
There‚Äôs a handful of energy companies with about 1/20th the size that are much better candidates. And also non-energy companies
To bad TSLA just shoved its dik in NIO charging port.
Why did CRSR jump so much today? I sold at 30, assuming it will go down again.

It will go down again, right?
Now how do you like CVS may 21 2021 100c and WBA jan 21 2022 90c?  They plan on distributing the vaccine...   Want to know what u guys think?
Dam bro you really dont know what you doin lmao. you dont need to purchase the shares. You can sell the contract before expiration for a profit
Bro you just need to sell . You up 400%
You purchased the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares at that price
Fuck yes Ryan Cohen isn't playing around
I got 5. you‚Äôre rich in my eyes
Seems to be working as intended so far lmao

It‚Äôll take another 9/11 to get SPY to drop $2

This is kind of like saying you're sick of the other 2 new hot chicks licking your balls while your wife sucks your cock and your friend Gary (GME) jacks off in the corner 

We can have fun with all of them
üü¢
No now go back to nio
Yeah they bought it AFTER it went up
If it goes to 53
i guess whenever I see these charts, I always assume they are settled funds or something, rather than estimated value of hella volatile options lol.
Thank you!! The first step was definitely the hardest. It took me almost 1-2 years of me to keep on telling myself to just fucking quit. I‚Äôll stop next week. Then next week comes. Ok I‚Äôll stop next week. That fucking cycle man
Why?
Day trade NIO tomorrow ?
My expert says it‚Äôs only worth +100%, Best I can do is 25% it‚Äôs gonna sit on my shelf a long time
No, not the same. Stock splits shouldn‚Äôt change the price

Index funds buying 13% of the total stock is bullish
Nah, that happens for a few small cap tech stocks and *maybe* Tesla. But your SPY calls aren't gonna do shit to move that.
He could force a vote to replace CEO/Leadership and Board of Directors. That is or else.
impossible they would say yes to a 50% effective vaccine
I‚Äôm not invested in NIO but I imagine it‚Äôs because it‚Äôd need to be the darkest shade of puke green you‚Äôve ever seen in your life across all categories to justify the valuation
NIO Fomo and Squeeze Day is almost here. Prepare. That is all.
I want to be reminded by the bot in 20 days
Savage. Overstock CEO / Micheal Burry move. 

I have been long since March.
How much percent up for 300% up does it gotta be
if it breaks 480 tomorrow 600 EOW simply from short covering
No it's the color your bum will be eod
I think I‚Äôm done with all this trading shit after selling my Tesla calls today. I want to be sick
Forget NIO. We all live on TSLA world tomorrow
TSLA $600 tomorrow at open. Mark this post.
Holding 5000 PLTR shares at $11 cost basis and selling 50x 20% OTM weekly calls every week for the next 5 years. Been doing it for 4 weeks now, great success. 

The calls generate roughly $750 a week in current volatility. Maybe if premiums start dropping I'll change my strategy.
that‚Äôs a lot of hours at wendy‚Äôs (and behind it)
Not as long as TSLA is in the SP 500
Look up Vraylar, Viibryd, and other newer ones. Ketamine and electro-stimulation devices. The mind has lost a lot of focus as Cancer has dominated the medical world, but you can still find some new psychiatric meds
A lot of big money already knows this. So if they don‚Äôt come out with numbers bigger than this it‚Äôll be considered a good earning. Numbers less than they‚Äôve been doing will be awful and anything in between will only be decent. Be careful of holding through bud
...or the NIO mooning was the reason the establishment felt they had to include TSLA in the first place.
ride or die. holding 32 2/21 45c all the way to callhalla

I don‚Äôt know but the same thing happened when Salesforce got added to an index (can‚Äôt remember which now)

You could have googled this so easily. It‚Äôs a widely known fact that the stock market has historically performed significantly better under democrat presidents.

>Liberum found that the stock market, represented by the S&P 500, posted an average annual total return of 10.8% under a Democratic president, compared to just 5.6% for a Republican president, since 1947.

>Many would likely argue that the data is skewed to favor a Democratic president because it includes the Great Recession of 2008, and the COVID-19 induced market sell-off of 2020, both of which happened under Republican presidents.

>Therefore, Liberum also looked at the historical data from 1947 to 2006, which excludes both the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.

>But the data is more of the same. From 1947 to 2006, the average annual return for stocks under a Democratic president was 10.5%, versus 6.1% under a Republican president.

Why do you just make dumb shit up and post your nonsense without even looking it up first?
Do you think it would effect XPEV as well?
Probably Tesla. Zaploft coming 2025
You don‚Äôt need to purchase the shares. You just sell the calls for a gain when you‚Äôre up, decide to sell for a loss or expire worthless when you‚Äôre down.
Fake account, nice try young padawan
They are...retail is overwhelmingly loaded with more shorts than calls...thus this parabolic squeeze
I‚Äôm still holding my calls from last week. The day it hit 54 I slept in. So I couldn‚Äôt sell. Hoping for the most massive of massive jumps through earnings.
Harddick
Thats awesome! So proud of you!!! I know we are supposed to be mean to each other or whatever but I'm just genuinely happy for you. Its so hard and thats a huge step!!
These guys look like üåàüêª
Super cool DD brother, thanks
Imagine if FDA says no to both vaccines

We will see a bear market
I don't think they want me to nail stuff to the door
$ARKK has 10% TSLA
Wtf is this
JEEZUS CRUST how did you go from $100 back up to what looks like about $3k? lol
they didn't know about the muffler till TSLA started fukin it
But dis he eat the other one 4 seconds later??
This is why I WSB.
[deleted]
Ok, take amzn with you tsla
I‚Äôm tired of working, I do spend all day on my phone. It doesn‚Äôt get better lol
only got 120k but upon good data following a second phase study, we have the option to get another 150k
Oh no! Hokiepokie is gonna treat me like a bitch!!! Whatever will I do??

I also mentioned I LOST so much money so wasn't exactly bragging lol
I bet what he does is tenders an offer.  Requires a vote.  All shares are pulled back. Stock shoots up.  No one cares about offer any more. GME can reissue some of  stock from buy back last year to fund technology update/transformation.
GME couldn‚Äôt even let me fully enjoy AH
Sell at open wtf does this actually mean for the company besides less shares in circulation
You are truly an inspiration man. üôè

It did feel good. You could pretty much FOMO in throughout the entire day and watch it quickly go up lmao. Reminded me of July and August
NODDERS
but I already used double sided duct tape directly on the bow and it kept falling
Baba has been getting crushed but I want in on Ant... might be buying soon
You must be new to stonks
Possible but you can almost count on AAPL being pinned at 118 or 119 on Friday afternoons.
I know when the NYSE first started they had like 2 or 3 short sessions a day where they‚Äôd gather and shout out prices auction style, before they changed to the full 9:30 to 4 session
i recently bet against spy and i regret it v much
no it means buy a mattress
lol dude after this insane run up there will be a correction.

Market makers need to get richer.
Offered an opportunity to have the option to buy early, assuming she‚Äôll know the price by that time. Sounds like based off general interest of all the other hosts will dictate how many shares will be available per person interested
then get in shares bruh... +80% at least in a month
https://youtu.be/ePb8RNNOTnI
lol, 10% is for pussies.
Unless he has calls too
I‚Äôm tired of working. I just want to spend all day on my phone
BABA has really been a boring piece of crap the past few sessions
this is the only whey
It's okay lol. It's only the millennial's that have to pay for covid. What matters is the precious boomers are safe
It‚Äôs in the S&P 500 Dow Jones Consultation survey they sent out about whether to add Tesla in one batch or two batches since it‚Äôs one of the largest additions of all time. They say it will be over 1% of the index
[This explains most of it well](https://youtu.be/Vb8JA3Y7aoE)

Lost $100k in a single day back in 2017.

Last Friday I lost $53,000 and gained back $38,000 today
I just hope Nio premiums can show + 300% tomorrow morning
 It's believed that alot of index funds have already started buying portions of Tesla in anticipation of being added before the end of 2020 so that it would be easier to digest when this day came.
Same
bought at 1700....it plummeted to 1400 and i hodl, and doubled down on my bet buying more

then it went to like 420 and i really got nervous, big loss in value, sold at 450 like an autist original share price paid 1700 and more at 1400. 

then i bought back at 400 and sold at 450....

then i bought at 380 and sold at 450 again.......

now i bought again at 400 and this happens

&#x200B;

i hope if i can keep making trades like this i might be able to recoup the losses i have from the drop at 1700 -sad face-
Don't forget the man
Yeah this is the way
Could only read and understand less than half the words here, but got 100 shares AH @ 462.75, buy high sell low let‚Äôs go!
Which company is heavy in mainstream antidepressants? I feel like scripts will be increasing in the coming years
Exactly. That and you ever try to find 3 or 4 good stable hard working, intelligent guys? Yah. I work alone or employ one helper.
Fuck you mean they‚Äôre gone?!?! Lol
I just bought 10 CCL $17 puts for 11/20
Also spy has rallied $50 in last 2 weeks when it only rallied $100 from March lows til start of November.

Last 2 weeks +$50

Paper and pen.
That‚Äôs what you‚Äôre gonna comeback with? Ok Chase Lombardi hahah
So true. Toyota, Honda, BMW are 100 yrs ahead of TSLA in automotive manufacturing. There just isn't a big enough demand yet for them to care IMO.
That's WSB.
So, My phone just told me we are going purple tomorrow. Does that mean we'll have a red day that makes us all blue? I haven't worked with these indicators before, but that seems pretty intuitive.
They are going to issue a new capital raise. Duh. -\_-

&#x200B;

They need more capital to expand growth. This is another perfect time to raise more capital and let big money index funds in.
I always think the stonk I buy is moments away from a huge momentous reversal that I need to ride and if I don't buy it RIGHT now...I will miss out.
Ok gramps are you 65? Like I said, funniest shit ever

[deleted]
No, I got jan calls
when is TSLA going to crash?
I think you had to call brokers and they robbed you even harder than the MMs do now.
Sell at least half now, so you don‚Äôt feel like a fool later if it goes back to your entry and you sell for flat or less
[removed]
I also lost 32% on ZM calls today‚Äôs. But my loss was a respectable -$4,300, not this baby shit.
I don‚Äôt think we will ever see it below there again man
Elon, my bad dude. I had some doubt, just for a hot second though, no longer, won't happen again.
Sorry but no. Jeff Bezos will always be the richest man in the world until he dies. Amazon is every single brick and mortar store combined into one accessible website. Anything you want, a click away. Competition? None. TSLA will have competition and will never beat AMZN revenue.

I know you love daddy Elon but these are just facts

I won‚Äôt! I ain‚Äôt no beta bitch simp boi. Got the strength of all you retards

Congratulations buddy.  Make sure to find an outlet or something else to do with your time.  Keep it up
Haha yeah it was a shit move on my part. Oh wellGonna yolo the rest
But neither of them have mufflers ... is there possibly another hole?
Not. There are not odds.
Still listed on the exchange
Someone will know, post it here, and it will be ignored and downvoted.
Strike price? How are you so confident? I've accepted the loss already.
I think that in order to buy shares you had to call a broker then they‚Äôd buy it somehow and write it down in a book with a pen or something like that. Then they would mail you a piece of paper saying you own X amount of shares.
Sounds like they're pretty desperate.

Lol how long have you been trading fam?
Plot Twist: OP is Costco CFO
No one cares, fuck off
Eh, I doubt you'll miss out on much unless you could perfectly time a put or something. TSLA could end up being on pluto at open but closing somewhere near the moon
ya but this is the actual fkn inclusioin and not enough shares for S&P so it will hike up the price. this time reality and not speculation.
See I have shares but I‚Äôm scared to add more because how much attention it‚Äôs getting on WSB. Every single stock I‚Äôve had that was pumped here got boned

Is it too much to ask for SPY to open up below $360??

I'm really not asking for much...
Get those 3M hook things. They are expensive but work. The house looks good man!
Dont give up u beta cuck. Do it for your liver. She‚Äôll thank you later for treating her right instead of going away with chad natty light.
So why exactly is Tesla‚Äôs S&P inclusion bullish? Is it the same reason that the stock split was bullish, (ie tard hype?)
are you kidding? Just use a tack/small nail. Even a stapler.
I get my addys from CVS so i bought calls. Paying off well.
LOL....
Said no ones 401k

First off you deserve to be banned for asking retarded questions

Second, pick any tech stock, buy a call at the money, wait for green line to go up, then sell it once you‚Äôre rich
It's been that way from the beginning.
Yes. First ones free

Yes I agree. The situation has changed though, it is either a buy out or he bails. No more in betweens.

Tesla 500 by EOY?
well at least you are breaking even. imo quit now before you lose a lot more.
Actually the other dude was right. A bit more than 10k it looks like.

Oh fuck yeah, funniest shit ever
*double checks portfolio looking for TSLA calls*

FUCK
It will be up the whole year.   
not enough shares are there for S&P 

Really get in calls but make sure to get shares. may be the only time get some shares. the more you have the less S&P have the opportunity to buy hence rocket high demand = rocket high price.
imagine hating money so badly that you are looking at the vix futures all night
I put a pathetic amount of money into it. Better than no gains at all though
Dude! Fuck yeah!
Lol
On what......
Stock split run up included S&p500 inclusion and battery day. It is why it pulled back hard when it wasn't included.
too much to be honest
lol dont be dumb... wait till iv crush at 7am and it will surge again at 8am pst
Go back to before market close today and load up on Tesla calls
NIO‚Äôs fate tomorrow
ü§£
Imagine you bought puts
Felt like the good ol days buying a 4dte 3.5 after it had gone up 10x already and still tripling my money.
Lord have mercy I'm about to bust.
My thought is that this may be orchestrated.  This may have been planned so that management can roll out a strategic plan covering all the point Cohen made. Everyone gets excited and shares price increases.

Gap did something like this https://www.gapinc.com/en-us/articles/2020/05/gap-inc-outlines-strategic-plan-for-store-re-openi on May 6th and their shares popped for the next little bit
Bought today 2 of $450 11/27 call for $3.49. It was down to $2.64 before eod. Should I sell it or hold it, as i have 2 weeks. What would be the expected good price to sell this ?
Sell that shit before Elon starts tweeting about how TSLA is worth $10 in a different universe
Please post update tomorrow

FCEL autists assemble. Are we mooning tomorrow or is the dump coming? Hopefully this Tesla and EV boom will help us

Someone explain how the stock market worked before computers. I don't get it
I swear I thought you bought Orangeman holdings.
hard to trade gold when the market going up. Placed a trade with a 5k margin a week ago and waited for a up day to get out with $190 profit. Trading gold is scary right now.
I did. I've been in the hospital for 6 months. Must have been bad bleach.
It‚Äôs 8k in 1/15 calls what could go wrong tits always stay down
Anyone saying Tesla ran up in aug only because of the stock split has fragile X syndrome. That was hella s&p inclusion hype too, that‚Äôs why it crashed when it wasn‚Äôt included in sept. Either y‚Äôall are doing a ü•≠ level intentional lie to convince people to fomo or you actually work at Wendy‚Äôs
Why the fuck would cruise lines rocket with an impending lockdown and travel restrictions? Lol
lol tsla gonna open at 450 tomorrow and close at 420
Nice DD just went all in

Good gift for your wife's boyfriend üëçüèº
I'll make a spicy prediction: it will have at least 1 red day this week (beyond today's).

You have to consider the peculiarities: S&P isn't even sure *how* they'll add Tesla and they're asking for consultations.  A ton of this is also priced in since the company is comically priced, even by EV retardation valuations.
What does this mean

Rumored to be increasing production to do 10k a month so target is being pushed to 150k cars in 2021.
ive got one about 10k right now - i'll let u know how it goes :P

You're gonna need that Chuck-E Cheese paycheck for more of that crack youre smoking if you think its hitting 450 by Christmas. 

That being said, I do think PLTR is going to be a giant, but it will take some time before it gets anywhere close to 100, let alone 450.

In final, I'm balls fuckin deep in PLTR

I've literally had TSLA puts gain money while the ticker went up because of IV. Tomorrow will be one of those days but I'm all in on calls this time.
Everytime I make money, I lose it. Everytime I lose money, I win it back. Literally just breaking even and the only thing I have to show for it is a couple of new gray hairs
no

Interesting rumor - the majority of gain section is suits, posting professionally photoshopped gains and some real gains as they load up on the opposite of their posts, in order to lure us silly retail brohs into outlandish positions before a swift rug pull for them to profit from our losses

i was down 30k ytd in may now only down 10k
uh, brah he's already worth 90 billion.. its not crazy to think tsla could double from this
My butthole
I talked myself out of throwing a few hundred at 450 11/20 calls. It wouldn't have been much by wsb standards, enough to give me some breathing room though. I'm not even sure why I was considering it... it would've been dumb, but I would've made money. Now I'm just losing money on shit I actually thought about.

edit: I also had a few 18.5 11/20 ride calls that I sold shortly after open on monday. Looking at it now is making me cringe.
All the NIO Bears that chased behind Shifty Left just saw their accounts vanish into thin air. Poetic. 

NIO $100+ EOW.

That‚Äôs cuz it dropped like 25% for no reason.
You‚Äôre dead on. The sedans are a bit too low of a ride for our snow conditions some days, but the model X does great if you can afford it and the Cybertruck will be huge up here if for no other reason than the ramp, electric quad and snowmachine charging station in the back.
Lol ok ok. If you absolutely must, just do it w shares.
This is true
March 2021 450c.... guess I need to hold this? Also considering selling tomorrow and reentering with a higher strike on a dip
Your mom is quite wealthy on the scale
All solid advice gentlemen
Gonna be the first SnP 500 stock to move either 20% up or down every earnings its insane.
Sorta regret offloading my 28c's today
Honestly it‚Äôs going to depend on premarket price and volume, but I expect the good old OTM call rush to push the price up. I‚Äôm debating between selling at open to be safe, waiting for that bump and selling early, or holding until Wednesday afternoon. I‚Äôm terrified I won‚Äôt maximize this one, any suggestions?
Maybe

Never sell shares for a loss. That‚Äôs what options are for.

If you have trouble remembering this, keep a hammer in your room. Every time you sell shares at a loss take the hammer and smash it down on your big toe. 

You‚Äôll relearn quickly
Yes but it's also tesla. Who the hell knows
Yes. Someone needs to be in the other side of the trade aka you need a buyer. Usually if it‚Äôs expiring at the end of the day, you‚Äôll sell for a slight premium above what you‚Äôd get if you exercised the contract and then sold the shares.

I thought futures would be up at least .5% but there's still a long ways to go till market open
exactly why?
Oh yea I‚Äôve had this on my watch list for months, I read some good dd on it.
Fuck yay!  Nice.   Shoot for a week.   Change ur life

Definitely not lol. I guess I‚Äôm a rich idiot in your book though.
Old money vs new money
Where is this number coming from
Been in since $4.24.  Basis is actually now < $0 from selling covered calls.
Why is everyone so confident that the NIO stonk is gonna take after earnings? What if they report green in all columns? Genuinely curious
I can understand that you might want to grab some profit now but my advice to you would be to learn to hold during these periods. You clearly have a long term mindset for Tesla so these gains are small in comparison to where you see Tesla in 5-10 years. Buy when the price dips and hold your shares during these spikes. The worst thing you can do is try to time the market. How can you determine the peak? How do you know when the drop will happen? People have been trying to figure that out since forever.
you spelt pita wrong retard
What‚Äôs the ipo price at? Valuation?
If a no event like a stock split can make TSLA run 81% in 2 weeks just think about what S&P inclusion will create. Went from 274 to 498 and that's excluding the 540 I saw in european market before dilution news.

Unless the company screws up and fails. Best bet is to also buy some $XPEV & $LI shares as well. They should all do well but any one of them could be the big prize and be the equivalent of Chinese Toyota and become a global export major
That PayPal rumor ended up not being true hence why the stock dipped after hours. Probably going back to low 180s tomorrow.
So yay?

What DOES matter is which company is getting removed. Figure that out, buy puts, and retire

There are a lot more tesla on the road now
Dude you're going to look so fresh soon, keep it up, man!
Good for you. I think as a society, present and historically we romanticize and have romanticized drinking to temporarily forget about our ongoing internal issues or think it‚Äôs the only way to have ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

XPEV is currently up quite a bit AH. I feel like it won‚Äôt carry through till market hours tomorrow.
A lot
I like the risk benefit ratio into long calls if we drop further.
Motherfucker, the day I decided to sell 500cc, it's the day this news comes out. 

I knew I shouldn't have bet against Elon. Forgive me Papa.
i highly doubt Cohen walks. He is fully in this. I think he wants shareholder support. This letter makes management look very bad. Talks incompetence and backs it up with figures. I do think GME current mgmt is good, but he obviously wants to take GME down a separate path. Both can be successful, but I believe RC vision to be the most profitable as a shareholder.

It's what Hestia and Permit did last year when they wanted to get on the board and influence decisions.

RC doesn't need a lot of money to buyout. Roughly less than 475M if he gives a 50% premium on current share price will give him a 50% stake in the company.

I think the buyout is imminent at this point. Q3 is going to be as bullish as possible from mgmt in order to gain shareholder support, but it may be too late by then.
hes not wrong, excepts its not stocks its options and MMs are driving up the underlining stock for us degenerates, the smart ones sell at 1000% returns. the retards hold and hope for 100000000% returns.

Have been buying SPR for the last month, it will continue to moon. Get in before you miss the plane.
forget bears.... their loss is limited by the total put options price. Just think about the shorts... holy god...
sorry if this is a stupid question but I haven‚Äôt been able to find a clear answer.

say i get something ridiculous, like it‚Äôs thursday and i get 3000+ intel puts expiring tomorrow for $40k. friday morning i wake up in the money and now it‚Äôs worth $400k. are u saying there‚Äôs a possibility that i won‚Äôt be able to sell my contracts?
Did I lie? :p
I have em
You belong amongst us.
What is the og version?
This year went from $40k to $900k so more like 2150% gain
Congrats to all you guys that got TSLA calls today. And fuck you
As long as there‚Äôs no lockup buy it
Wow S&P inclusion means they buy $51 billion in TSLA which had a market cap of $386 billion before the after hours pop

They‚Äôre gonna buy 13.21% of TSLA üòÇ
In the ass
Can you do one for the call sellers?
AMD to $100 soon, not a drill this time üö®

TON of money in this vaccine and a lot of skepticism around it. PFE gonna lobby the shit out of DC to make it so you need it to travel or get on a plane, or go to a hospital. As a true patriot and believer in corporate scientists I will get every vaccine from every company that puts one out. Even the homemade ETSY vaccines.

>There is no rule they have to buy the ticker at time of inclusion

JFYI, there's over 5 trillion dollars worth of passive index funds following the S&P 500, who follow the index to within 0.01% and **cannot** buy TSLA before the announcement. (The assets they manage wouldn't be following the S&P 500 anymore if they did.)

By December 16 these funds alone will have to buy 127 million TSLA shares worth over 50 billion dollars, or over 15% of the free float ...

Yes, this is a design flaw in the S&P 500 index, committed 60 years ago.

>This had been discussed in the sub in the previous Tesla hype period.

You don‚Äôt need to imagine TSLA bears in shambles bigly bc it‚Äôs reality
I tried my hardest.
I already see Tesla as a force to be reckoned with. I didn't know if it would be smarter to hold, or sell at the peak and buy back in at a drop. The holidays are approaching and corona cases will spike, so there might be a drop soon. Idk this is my first major spike.
That‚Äôs my plan br√∂ther
I got myself some NIO puts before close, how fucked am I?
I‚Äôm terrible at Reddit I have no idea how to do it

I had 20 $420 Tesla calls that I sold at noon today because I was down like $2000. Please someone fucking kill me
Gotta finish off that 1/2 day rotation?

SLV?!?
It won‚Äôt get that far because the speaker of the house will recognize the proper electors.
I actually bought Tesla calls this is a dream come true
Snap
But it‚Äôs not nothing. Rest assured that they are in shambles over that shit
Absolutely
12/31 or 1/15
Oh for sure. At least if i get stuck with time travel, i can keep re-trying.

The money starts to lose its emotional value after time. It just becomes numbers on a screen.
Could be worse, my boss sold his $560 NVDA calls for a 30K loss the day before it started the rocket ride up to $600
No doubt
That‚Äôs my bad, just saw your proof in the conversation; Next time post proof in the main body so I don‚Äôt look like an asshole!  GL
Lol apparently next dump is not before 3400. Apparently.

for once it fkn is... goddammit... dude. of all the time just get into tesla tomorrow
Grand Marquis are nice.
I choose to accept this as fact ü§£
I‚Äôve been a Tesla bear before, got lucky the day Tesla got kicked out of the s&p. Rode puts $425 to $350 before selling. I think the low of the day was $308. Assuming being kicked out of the s&p is worth the same as the invite $408 to $525, then settles at $480ish? I‚Äôm down to ride some options up at 9:30am
Choduuuuuuu
I got absolutely wrecked as well. It happens. Just gotta move on to the next one
Asked the same thing.
Didn‚Äôt know Bloomy users could post on wsb

What happened to all SPYS after hour gains
1.7 million shares according to his latest 13F. Still his largest holding. 11% of his portfolio

‚ÄúWe expect to see a lot of long-term damage‚Äù
Fuck yes. I'd smash it twice.
Inshallah
they'll probably announce some holiday event, and that'll cause it to pop a bit

then it's running into post-holidays earnings next year, which will be insane, so the run-up, too, will be hard

a lot of options will be expiring in january as well. that should be interesting
lol wut
[removed]
A lot of big investment firms are in this stock, so might as well join them for the long haul
It‚Äôs going full TSLA but maybe not this week. All the EV money has been blasting out to other companies today. $LI was up 14% today & TSLA is being added to SPX. Even NKLA is moving. There‚Äôs too much money spraying around elsewhere in the EV sector as other stocks catch up to $NIO‚Äôs recent run-up, for much to land on $NIO right now.
Not announced yet
There's always that boomer shares shit.
holy shit bro did u write that all out rn
Spy calls been free money for 2 weeks now, don‚Äôt see any reason why it stops now
I still find it hard to carry 3 figure losses and folks on here down 25k and 50k on a single play like it's nothing
Really? Any reason why?
what was your spy position?
What strike? Either way sorry for you lost gainz
Hopefully CCL opens red tomorrow, I have similar positions

hey charlie
Won‚Äôt a lot of things be on sale tomorrow since s&p is a weighted index and Tesla has a huge market cap?
Fucking Tesla, I wish I had my calls still
The dude holding my puts is down 54%, hes not feeling well

BRUH, ride sharing.
If I am not already a billionaire when offered to press the button, wouldn't that mean that I die when I press it?

Get in now, a boom is coming.
 

Let's think through the implications of this. If anyone on here has more experience with buyouts, please do chime in here.

The situation has become a huge boom or moderate bust situation. The board clearly isn't listening to Cohen, so the article (and his letter) is bad news if you take it for face value. A big piece of the bull story is that GameStop will indeed implement the ideas / visions of someone who obviously has had massive success in e-commerce.

Now, why would he release this article, let alone his "letter", publicly? Why hasn't he sold his stake either? If he had disagreements with the management before, I can assure you that this won't change anything. If anything, this will probably make the management stand their grounds even stronger, wishing to prove Cohen wrong. They won't suddenly listen to him because of this.

The reason may be to stage a buyout / tender offer in the near future. I can think of no other reasonable explanation to take this public, facing the management head-on. If this happens, institutions will be forced to recall any lent shares for a proxy vote, likely forcing a squeeze.

Having said so, this is far from guaranteed. I've outlined my logic above, but it may be incorrect, and the risk still remains that he may just sell his stake and bail.
Say less fam
Or what
Relax, you have time
You bet your ass ill fomo
I'm going with BJ's personally...
Solid DD. Buying calls at open.
Kinda cool we can make money in our pajamas while the top CEOs run their companies. Too bad the education system doesn‚Äôt teach people about financial literacy and how to invest even if it‚Äôs retarded Chinese companies, you‚Äôre at least putting your money to work instead of buying dumb shit to keep you poor.

Depends how many people I‚Äôm up against.
The fuck is wrong with you?
TSLA 460c 11/20 were only 50 cents today at an IV of 66%, which is super low by TSLA standards. I wonder how much I would have made if I had went all in before EOD. These are the thoughts that keep me awake at night.

That‚Äôs easy.. at least make it a difficult decision like 40 or 50%

It‚Äôs steadily ran up for a month now. Look at all the game changers it‚Äôs been rolling out for it‚Äôs image and overall company. It‚Äôs a no brainer. They‚Äôre about to explode even more IMO once they start showing bigger profit margins and more signups for Walmart + than expected
You underestimate the power of 16 year olds on Robinhood.
Ouch!! Someone got burned
just like what everyone thought with the stock split...

not saying ur wrong but this subreddit has proven many like u and me wrong b4

never underestimate retard strength
Thanks brother. I‚Äôll see what happens in the morning. Not sure what to expect now.
Interesting.  They‚Äôve been on a consistent decline for the last 5 years, but good day today...
I bought docu at near peak, around $260. Can't wait to get out

Yah, today sucked granny ass. All my "gonna bank Monday!!!" positions tanked and stayed flat ALL FUCKING DAY! Goddammit! Barely closed above 25k. (I do best daytrading.)
Of course now... With Tesla eating moon cheese... Yes, holding 8 contracts... That were 3k in the fucking red all day....I think I'll be a happy trader tomorrow morning.
Gonna have to take a break and sell puts for a while after this. The stress is immense.
Good luck fellow autist.
crazy how people dont use debits and just raw dog the market like that
medical community doesn't actually deny any of this

look into it
9k
Thankfully I've sold enough that I've brought down my cost basis by $13.42. My brain is too small to guesstimate what the contracts will be worth tomorrow.
Whats that like tree fiddy?
What movie is this?
"this one is the play I can feel it"
Wow that‚Äôs like a whole port of stocks people recommended against buying. Impressive.
I bought PUTS on CCL when it dip a little.. it went back up again.. instant loss of 1k.. Fck this rigged market
Ouu ouu discord link!
So what‚Äôs the strategy if you don‚Äôt currently hold TSLA?
Weeklies are always risky. Maybe buy some
Shares or long dated calls? That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing, it could get volatile this week so be careful. Just my 2 cents of things
My Reddit B-day is on his B-day. It's cool.
Sup fuck tard
A lot of that 11T tracking s&p500 already owns Tesla. You are overestimating the net buying demand. Conclusion stands regardless. To the moon

Trickle down economics. Fuck you :)
BIGGERLY
Please teach us.
WMT ALWAYS goes up 1%+ AH the day before earnings are announced in the AM it never fails
Yeezus be praised, I knew my faith would be rewarded. My 2023 TSLA calls finna print
EV grabbin the world economy by the balls
Tyty :) up 1200% this month ayee
Even a broken clock is right once a day
yes
I had long dated calls for the first pump and was like ‚Äúobv this will keep running‚Äù then it shat down to 36. Thankfully i held thru to the 90% day pump and sold nearly at the top cause I remembered what a shit stock it is. Lo and behold it gave up all the gains and then some within 5 days. Truly a dumpster fire
Unpopular take: TSLA stock mooned because of speculation and now speculators want to get their pay day. All the buying pressure from index ETFs will be matched by selling pressure from speculators looking to cash out.

TSLA will go up, but I'm betting it only goes up another 10% or so from here, if that.
Not when TSLA fukin NIO in the muffler
Ah perfect. EV means emergency vaccine ya?
I‚Äôm just have missed something, let me circle back around to the original post, I didn‚Äôt see proof and I saw shares in the title
Just gotta hope they see the point, could be great news for them if we see them actually put together a plan and like he says, address the shareholders and give an actual plan on what they are gonna do to keep competing.

If not....well hopefully I decide to sell before the fall üò¨
$TSLA and $NIO moon in the same week? We can‚Äôt stop winning boys.
I just sold 100 calls on Tesla, how much money will I make?
Coming back down in the morning. Inclusion to the SP doesn‚Äôt change anything
What you in at for PLTR. I bought in too high but still think this thing could be 20 sooner than later
My mom‚Äôs 401k is in fxifx. How do I tell her to yolo it on TSLA calls?
I can feel the fomo, I can sense the markets euphoria... Or is that just the cocaine?
I got 11.5p for this Friday. Was feeling good seeing it drop AH. Not feeling so good now.
Unironically this, on top of pretending the next trade is "what I should have done all along.". 

When that also inevitably goes wrong, repeat step 1.
Name of the game.
nice
Wait what‚Äôs the niche topic that wsb‚Äôers are good at. Everyone here seems to lose money so don‚Äôt say options

Nvidia is my biggest position in my actual stonks and I'm very bullish on them. I think they beat earnings at least. But long term they gonna have their dicks in everything: AI, self driving, gaming, rendering, medical simulations, and probably more. But im also on WSB so maybe don't listen to me
Fuckkkk bro nio next hopefully!
I gots $36p waiting to print on Wednesday. I must have placed a order last week that I forgot about and it filled today, not cool.
That Tesla leap is gonna boost the portfolio tomorrow my guy
new CEO. at 52 wk low right now with lots of space to grow with retail coming back and the company moving in a new direction. has 5 bagger written all over it.
NKLA, PRPL, GME, SPCE, CORN

What else did I miss boys
Damn, missed the boat. I was hoping to get some $$$ from my current plays to put some on Tesla calls later, I didn't expect the index inclusion news to hit so soon.
Are there certain stocks you can just not buy with your day trading power balance?
I wonder if this TSLA moons is shits and giggles and goes down tmr ....then again fomo 1k or 2 into some calls also sounds interesting
My calls like this
Nobody told kirk it was Monday. He still thinks it's Sunday after and it's dark due to daylight savings

Nah, she's like a savant, not really intelligent. WSBers are the same. Smart at a niche topic but dumb at everything else

Donnie Dump had me loading up on puts. The top is in boys its always the Tweet that does it

Lmao what
Yeah. Basic bitches love em
As Elon pointed out it makes more sense to take big risks when you are young and don't have much to lose. Just because they are risking their whole bankroll doesn't mean they are risking their food or housing or spouse or kids etc.
COTY?  Why?
Probably colonize mars himself.
11/27 16.5 seems safer, more room to fall.

Doesn‚Äôt your argument somewhat support at least a short term increase in the price as it implies that their near-term goal of space tourism isn‚Äôt too difficult or impressive from a technical perspective (and therefore should be easily achievable)? I‚Äôm hoping that once they fly Branson, it‚Äôll lead to a short-term pop in the stock to at least its ATH of 42, whether that price is justified or not.

Well they'll feel really fucking stupid for complaining when you buy them each a yacht from NIO calls
So you intend to FOMO into TSLA tomorrow as you‚Äôve done multiple times over last few months. 

Got it.
The minute you give up on it, thats when it‚Äôll moon
Depends on the underlying lol
Yolo on tsla at 9:30 and order your roadster at 10:30

They don't get included until December, plenty of time for a big run up
Could, but not sure
Deleting in 5, I promise.
Can confirm. I live in Columbus.

Maybe we should all start thinking about volunteering at GameStop like that one guy said...

This is me as well. All depends on the option premium to buy back for me.  If it‚Äôs less than the $30 difference I‚Äôm buying it back or rolling it out.
Do big boys s&p do anything to make sure Tesla is not over valued from this announcement?

My parents don‚Äôt give me money. Because I‚Äôm an adult.
Stop losses on options? But they gap hard. If you want defined risk look into spreads.
I have a gut feeling TSLA will do its obligatory dump for no reason at some point which would be the next re-entry point but S&P500 news might mean what price it is now will be the start of some mega retard strength retail and hedgefund rally...
Five grand each contract. Nice job!!
well done bro. Just a casual observation
How do you guys recover from big losses? Need advice.
Not yet, Elon needs another bonus tranche.
Now that you‚Äôre out, tomeorow

Thank you
My educated guess based on what happened the last  three quarters is that they crush earnings, there will be a spike to around 157-158 premarket to get your hopes up but that will slowly fade throughout the day and it‚Äôll be back at $153 by the end of the week. I could be totally wrong and it moons but that‚Äôs what happened every quarter for the year I‚Äôve been in the stock game.

So we just have to buy TSLA at open for 2 weeks out, right? Only can go up? And does TSLA up mean good things for NIO?
been very close to dumping PLTR or COTY for some TSLA or additional NIO. but i think i'm gonna stick with them. they look great long term.
We don‚Äôt speak of saturday

Throw enough shit at a wall and you'll eventually make a fresco.
That‚Äôs what we do here
A rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation.  The geometric plane along which the rotation occurs is called the rotation plane, and the imaginary line extending from the center and perpendicular to the rotation plane is called the rotation axis ( AK-seez).

I'm on the fence with $NIO. On the one hand, I like that 70% of NIO car owners have a home charging station. That's kind of cool and a different approach. That said, the whole "asset light" model is spin for NIO doesn't own any IP or make anything. They outsource everything to JAC a Chinese state car company. What are you actually buying with NIO? The brand. I'll pass for now.

HOLY SHIT HE WAS TELLING US THE WHOLE TIME
Jack Ma is getting bent over by the CCP for offloading a ton of shit debt to the Chinese banking system.  It will explode once he kisses the ring.  If it goes down past 244.44 per share assume he was offed by the govt.
Probably opens at 400% but depends if the stock price continues to climb and IV, but you're probably looking at around ~300% throughout the day....give or take 50%~ swings. The real question is if you plan to hold it a few more days bc this thing can go to $500 a share by Friday, maybe.
Fuck it I joined em tired of being 60% down from puts.  $SPCE got delayed was my one sliver of hope, now got wait on that.

I guess if we skyrocket Tesla's market cap we can no longer say NIO is 1/4 of Tesla's market cap when that one inevitably goes to $1,000.

I too am familiar with the buy high and sell low strategy
Does TSLA move help FSR at all tomorrow?
I can‚Äôt imagine TSLA not having a 20% day tmrw
You guys think the NY DMV will say anything if I apply for the custom plate ‚ÄúFGTRTD‚Äù
The real question is how do we play TSLA when their inclusion is not for another month? One would think it‚Äôll have a nice run up this week at least as funds by in early and shorts cover...

Or do we think this phenomenon will happen closer to inclusion?
Seeing how a lot of us missed out on Tesla. What's the next moonshot? I'm thinking BABA.
The  - I dont want to be a lone voice for change on your board - line was such a sick little burn on the end of that letter.

 It's like a win win situation. Trump refuses to close down America with talk of vaccine news, and with Biden as President, the green new deal will be pasted. GG boi's if you can't make money right now you either a gay ass bear or your wife's boyfriend stole your phone.

It will be so high we might need SpaceX or NASA to help us find it
Yup let them expire too couldn't live with selling for only 100 bucks or so. Bears win this round
Anyone wanna Shill me on baba or link me on something explaining wtf is going on with ant cause I wanna throw like 50% of my folio in it

If I have positions in TSLA at 405 and 430... should I just take profit/safety net trail stop or leave them and somehow not touch them for a year?
He's got to learn somehow.
TSLA weeklies are my go to scalp since I watch the chart so readily. I bought these to hood overnight hoping for an easy scalp in the morning. Just freak chance.
TSLA already touching $500 in the east Zimbabwe stonk market. Gonna be a good day for bul tomorrow.
Def going higher
Love u
Yay show us your tsla yolo gains 

Better still, which autists bought putz
So I almost bought peloton at 32 then it jumped to 60 and u/swaggymedia said I should look at it. At the time I felt is was overvalued just based on the fact that most of its revenue was from hardware... they are shifting that slowly and their software business is much more profitable. I don‚Äôt have an opinion - they are first to market but lululemon bought mirror and lulu has deep pockets. Also, tonal is getting big, not sure who owns that. I have two friend with tonal and they love it. In summary, I am not taking a position just for the fact that I feel there are better plays that scale with less losses that are more profitable and aren‚Äôt dependent on 5-6 more quarters of losses before turning a profit. The stock could very well go to 200 but its worth than most of the gyms and home fitness categories combined. Peloton is the Tesla of fitness equipment and it might just keep trucking along.
Is it better to sell puts or buy calls?

People were saying that faithless electors would choose Bernie or Hillary. Didn't happen. Why would it happen now with a man that's already old news? Trump might have a lot of sway over voters, but he isn't exactly political crafty. Nobody will be winning much by turning against the world for Trump's sake.
he should've bought shares.
I have 20 calls, dumbass. Didn't Elon tell you that?
Thanks
I love you. Fuck you though

No I was thinking of buying but pussied out. That would be worse though.

Profit taking is the better part of the equation. Maybe people hold until Jan 2021 because alot could have bought in during that Jan 2020 run up for favorable tax treatment.

If that's the angle you're looking at Jan 2020 and March 2020 are more important.
It‚Äôll stay up all week for sure. It‚Äôs literally EV week.

If you bought oxy 3 weeks ago at 8 bucks, you'd be up 50 percent today.  Bet on the Permian.  Lovely stacked plays reduce the price per barrel long term, they have better acerage, and they are better at EOR.

Yeah. I‚Äôm feeling like worst case I lose like 100 bucks. However, that‚Äôs a price I‚Äôm willing to pay in case this thing goes full Tesla. I almost bought 10 shares at a little under 2k over a year ago which would be worth over 20k now (but I realistically would have sold when it went from like 300 to 1000 in a day)
[removed]
If you mind losing the shares you're doing the wheel wrong obviously.

Maybe logical on a macro scale to take the risk but on an individual scale for someone at low risk of complications the risk to reward may not make sense. My life might only be a fraction of the American population but its my entire account. And I'm not sure I want to yolo it on Mango and MRNA
That's part of it. But moreso believe in Elon over the next 10 years to get to $1T and don't need the money now

I definitely don‚Äôt think tsla gains are gonna hurt for sentiment. Li, xpev, and nio basically trade as one for the time being. I‚Äôd say they all rise tomorrow on nio hype for earning and nio will either sell off harder than them or gain more than them depending on what earnings contains.

Be patient this is a short term pullback. This stock is volatile as all hell but growing, acquiring, partnering with big companies AMZN, WMT. Will benefit from green new deal, raised guidance for 2021, gave fourfold projections of revenue increase by 2024. 6 or 7% AH pullback because they are raising money to continue to grow??? Wait for it to settle and buy more.

Not you
Bears only come out during the weekends when the markets cant hurt them
Job with no work = unlimited $$$/hr
Pretty much lost everything when the stocks first crashed in March as well as because that‚Äôs when I started trading options. Slowly climbed back trading only options and was up 40%  buy mid July. I lost everything and made it back again twice after that lol but finally am up 10% again after being down like 50%

I have a TD Ameritrade account that I‚Äôve been doing really well in though so it‚Äôs made up for the robin hood losses üòÇ
Yes.
No stimulus will, I can‚Äôt see any governor doing a full shut down without making sure if people lose their jobs they‚Äôll have a safety net.
Does anyone else feel guilty about spending money that your parents give you?
I just bought 100 shares because of the insane premiums for weeklies. Praying it doesn't tank lol
this may be a dumb question but I thought Robinhood didn't allow options on margin?
Thoughts on PTON?  Price was beaten down by vaccine news, yet the company still has strong short to medium-term tailwinds and pent up demand.  Massive long-term potential if they can own the home fitness category, and/or successfully expand internationally.  

Sell-side is extremely bullish as well (avg. price target is $135 with a high of $160).
Godspeed retard these will print tendies
Who would jump into tesla AFTER this runup ü§°ü§°
oy wtf, puts?
These are the people theta gang loves
This dude really diversified lmaoooooo
Sold TSLA last Monday at 445, re-entered at $410, like a book üìñ
Brutal, but brings out all sorts of good points.

This reads almost like an "or else" kind of letter lol
Fuck man, I have a handful of NIO calls I‚Äôm holding through earnings. I want to go all in on it, but I don‚Äôt want to risk IV crush. I should just wait till after earnings and buy more calls then, right?
Depends on what happens but sure
exactly its all about as long as youre able to pay your bills and just do something you enjoy, like you said its the amount of effort vs work
Over leveraged in EV puts. Not looking great for me bois
Sales
How do u make it so after hours gains show?
www.optionsprofitcalculator.com
I just want a 20% play. Gimme üòà
congrats can you buy me 1 share?
Link?
Billions I see
Nope, nio usually moons with tsla, and this + earnings is easy 50-55$ bringing xpev, and li with it
Is it too late to buy now?
That‚Äôs coming up real soon pal just wait
You probably be a lil to breakeven, no?
Enjoy the chicken dinner, you're still a winner.
I‚Äôm also curious what is happened here
Implied volatility will really play a role
Selling at open?
Tech green everything else red. Everybody happy make it happen stock gods
Def already priced in
Damn they‚Äôre going to find a whole 13 votes for Donald trump, election is over guys trump seems to have it in the bag
This shows that he might have to take matters into his own hands and put out a tender offer for GME. This would destroy shorts and cause a VW type squeeze, it‚Äôs very possible he was the guy accumulating shares over these last few weeks in big blocks. Also, this makes you wonder, is someone betting that some huge news comes out this week? About 30k total OI on the 20c 15c and 25c expiring on Friday and someone also sold 6.5k 20p‚Äôs expiring friday
idk im retarded
üòÇ
Lmao I got like 450‚Ç¨ Tesla 150‚Ç¨ Nio 150 Li auto 150 xPeng

Their host endowment fund kind of worries me. I think their first few days after the IPO are going to look a lot like Unity and Corsair. The starting price will be changed 3-4 times due to high volume. After it opens the host endowment fund investors will dump their shares after finally being able to trade on the market. Maybe 5-15% from open. Then exponential growth in the next days as less and less initial investors sell off and more people buy in for the dip.
Call premium is always shit. Selling puts is always the way to go, and tomorrow is not going to be that day. Sell puts on days that bleed
Priced in
Strap up homie
SO YA SOLD TESLA TO BUY NIO

No no no ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ
Control your position size relative to portfolio brah. And take some time off.

Options=don‚Äôt buy weeklies unless you are hedging, or just playing around with money you are prepared to lose.
Been selling CC‚Äôs on UVXY, selling puts too. Not losing my ass, but damn close. Shit drops way to fast IMO considering the market uncertainty.
People waiting for earnings. Watch it blow up on wed
yes bigly
Same here. I took a look at prices. Didn‚Äôt wanna sell any of my positions to make it happen and decided to pass on this play. Christ.
65 eod of bust

You‚Äôre the dude that went all in NCLH. How much did you make from that play?
I was thinking 11-12am IV will have cooled off by then
That's the attitude I want to see!
I‚Äôm loving it man!!! Offsetting my PLUG losses hahaha!
I‚Äôm wondering what that will look like vs current after hours price (which is +13.48% right now)
[deleted]
literally hovered over this exact option... tesla dipped and i took it to pltr. fuck.
Eod
Damn this made me feel better about selling before the news
Citron killed the hype. It would of been 60 today with out that bs
Thank god. This nio, gme, pltr bullshit is getting on my nerves.
It's criminalized at the state level so up to each state.
is li up tommorow?
I like IPOB, bought shares since I don't know how it'll move and will likely screw up with options. Seems like ARK buys the dip below $18/share. I bought 100 shares around $20 then 300 around $16. Selling shorter term calls (covered calls) on shares is super profitable as well.
*NIO up 4.5% AH*

Anyone ever done weekly calendar spreads? How much can you make in a week by say selling the TSLA Friday and buying next Friday?
Also buying more 2023 XOM $55 calls.

You sure it wasn't spaceX?
Probably will go nuts tomorrow. Bag holders will be index funds
ur a good man. I humbly bow my head sir.
What‚Äôs more logical, TSLA moves a whole index which is notoriously stable vs the market, or everyone buys into Tesla and it becomes more stable
Diamond hands baby
no
Huh. Thanks. People out here claiming they got rich off pltr calls when it moved like .7% today. Idek which direction cause I can‚Äôt read
Fuck I had auto sell on
tesla going to 650
Yep totally his decision

Sorry but some of us like 2nd breakfasts. Ill have both.
Chance other EVs are dumped for Tesla instead of rallying with it?
im not this much of a houdini but 2 weeks out 500c imo. This could eat shit. This is not financial advise. Though I am a financial advisor. I would never try selling tesla to any of my own clients.
Alhamdulillah
GUH
True. I might but I'm looking at BABA as the next moonshot. Only thing is that it's just such an unpredictable stock. I could be bagholding for a while.
Why great? I agree that it‚Äôd be great if they moved in the direction Cohen mentioned, but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve come out and agreed to do so. Basically he just said their current business model is dogshit.

I'm holding. Unless some devastating news come out I see NIO getting back to its scheduled programming.
I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs gonna be with calls.

Usually trust fund kids are aware how removed they are from reality. Not that they know how bad it could be, but just they know this is not normal. They might even think they somehow deserve this and be super spoilt but from my friends and acquaintances, usually they know they got a fucking sweet deal. And once they would be old enough to throw bricks and Molotov's at BLM demos, they also have heard how much taxes there will be if a socialist hellscape were to brake loose.


Middle class kids don't know how good they have it, what reality looks like and are way more prone to be sjws.

I sold my calls at a loss today cuz theta was up to. 37 before close.  Might miss out on a huge pump tomorrow but if there is no huge pump the calls would be fucked
> eh but didnt tsla continue to make multiple green days after the 10% increase when announcing the stock split? i remember they went up like 50%. not saying it'll happen but i can't imagine a chinese EV with ER would have that kinda of magic power.

That's like diluted crack. The daily 5-15% swings in NIO is straight intravenous adreno-cocaine that's 100x extract right into the big artery in your cock.

And we all would‚Äôve partied

Nah, lots of athletes do this when they sign with a new team. Especially in Europe where different countries have different tax regimes.

Buy TSLA stock if you're still bullish. But the premiums are going to be retarded high. Best to just buy stock or maybe call debit spreads to help reduce the cost.
Not as fuvked as you will be at market open lol.
Thetagang nerd here. Glad I can keep the full premiums from 11/20 $420P I sold
Fuck it, I‚Äôm going in, I rather die in a Tesla than a NIO
Bruh I don‚Äôt fuccin know either. If it hits 50 then it would be bigger than logitech. Fuccin slim margins on this pc bullshit.

Thank you, I've been defending myself so much in this thread, it's nice to have someone agree with me.
console sales not included in december ER
but it should be in guidance
Cabrony ass
Thanks man.
Would love that
Not at all bro. Sounds like a great plan.
TSLA joining the S and P in December.
Nio + Tesla = elations
Oh man i honestly was sick for you assuming naked calls lol üòÇ not to shabby i guess
SBE unstoppable after hours
Yeah nio going to dump after earnings. No hype left
I'm not! I'm diamond hand till Friday 1:55. üíéüñêÔ∏è
That‚Äôs the spirit
Lol you missed the train boss, unless tsla goes full fucking meme again
Nah don't buy at the top of a runup. It'll teeter down a bit soon. Buy on a solid red day
nice - me too. I think they are the best electric car company from China and their battery swapping has game changing potential.
Yeah. Got it. I‚Äôll take another +15% morning..
I‚Äôm hoping for a squeeze to $480-$500 during the first 15-30 minutes. If that‚Äôs occurs, I‚Äôll sell for $15-20k gain. If volume/price action is weak I‚Äôll probably hold. Either way, I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs best to sell and not be greedy trying to squeeze every dollar. I‚Äôve had a few really nice gains that turned on me within a day.
Crayons that account for meme potential are more accurate
Special dividend of $10
Great!
Ouch
It's going to be so lit when Tesla crashes SPY on Battery
Day 2.0
December (console sales not included) then again in March

The thing is, they'll be able to talk about this quarter in december, so we could run like mad for that alone.
We ain‚Äôt red enough in my opinion
Both classes are wealthy enough that their kids have no real concept of worry or struggle. So they blow tiny obstacles and problems out of proportion so the can be a "champion" for "good" by "fixing" things that are non-issues to the real world. Sometimes actually fucking up the real world and fucking over poorer people in the process.
Buying weeeklies day of expirations with minutes to close ?

Oh yeah it won‚Äôt reflect changes til 9:32am at earliest. Best to keep a separate tab up with a real broker showing the chain and then enter into RH a sell price several points below the bid üëçüèº
You didn‚Äôt get saved. If anything you will be able to recoup some losses, but won‚Äôt break even most likely. Your strike price is way out of the money even with SP500 inclusion and there‚Äôs not enough time for you to be in the money.
The cash funding the dividend was priced into the stock, per share price will drop in December to reflect the lower cash holdings.
Finally, my ex can find a stable career.

I have been rearranging my portfolio and I think it‚Äôs time to pick up more and more electric car companies. Specially companies directly linked to electric cars like Lithium mining companies. Biden will promote growth in the US in the green tech and next 4 year future is in green tech
Absolutely not. The IV crush will be real.
I think I am holding too. They seem to be the best electric car company from China and their battery swapping has game changing potential.
Hey have you guys ever heard of this guy called Rick from Rick and Morty? He turned himself into a pickle, called it "Pickle Rick", funniest shit I've ever seen

They are first company to use blockchain at scale to reduce the cost remittances by 60+% using XRP payment corridors. Currently they are doing 10 percent of all US to Mexican peso remittances up from 4 percent just last year and that volume is growing. This is why Western Union offered to buy them but moneygram turned them down. It‚Äôs cause they know the technology is gonna put western union in second place.
Perhaps you are underleveraged
Please show me those gainz tomorrow pap√≠
NIO living rent free in his head now...
Looking at Baba Calls for tomorrow, notice Both puts and calls got crushed today. $275 12/18 Calls down from $9 to $6 while the stock only dropped $2.50. Some type of IV Crush? Can anyone explain what happened, is there a buying opportunity tomorrow?
I approve this message
Forgive me papa musk for i have sinned. I was holding American airline calls instead of tesla. I am retarded.
Best website to track up-to the min after hours?Marketwatch sucks.
What happened to COST after hours??
What do you autists think is the price action headed the next few months, say by end of Q1
Ticker: HOLES
All joking aside, this is actually a solid point and a very common way how I think a lot of people go about picking a point of view and defending it.

What the fuck I can‚Äôt even fucking cuss on this server anymore?

Calls on COST? Will consumers start buying a shit load more shares with that kind of dividend?
Hey would it be peak retard to take a cash advance out on my CC right now and throw it into my bank to have maximum funds in RH to buy TSLA FD‚Äôs at open and day trade before close.
Calls on smokers yo - they can do double lung transplants now thanks to COVID
Tesla spy inclusion hurts so badly. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy didn't I buyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Very good question, fellow autist! Are you sure you belong here?
Yes that was in September and there was a lot of disappointment when it wasn‚Äôt added. Haven‚Äôt seen anything about it recently and don‚Äôt act like u did. I had a suspicion so I brought it up twice. As you can see no one really cared but now everyone going crazy.
Yeah I guess Reddit is mad because I used mean words so the post got deleted but I‚Äôll upload screenshots on the repost
More good TSLA news coming soon. Elon is going to announce a dividend of 4.2069%

It‚Äôs great imo

[removed]
It does feel like a red week
This really should be dropping harder after hours but it‚Äôs not, hmmm. From what I understand the offering will mainly be institutions buying back.  Theyre offering stock worth 10% of the company.  Have to speculate that they planning to acquire a company with that amount of capital. I have a feeling that this will bleed out slowly for the rest of the week.
Oooff

If your position is up, it won‚Äôt matter and you probably don‚Äôt qualify unless you lose money
In my area, government regulation has gone crazy so building new ‚Äúlivable square footage‚Äù is outrageously expensive and has raised the value of all existing inventory. That plus absentee foreigners keep overpaying with cash offers.
That was 8 hrs ago
You talked shit to somebody else about their ‚Äúsmall‚Äù gains and then post about how you‚Äôve got so much money but conveniently without proof. Post some proof, or stfu, OR just accept that I‚Äôm gonna treat you like a bitch.

Yup, I did sell half my position today EOD just to lock in some gains
I read it as super bearish, took an hour but I'm finally seeing it as more than potentially good lol
they need another cause nobody is gonna sell
[removed]
Yes
I gotcha. I had a spy call just this month, WELL in the money for an entire week... And deep deep in the red the whole time. Finally expired. WTFF? Lost 3k on that shit.
Haha wow you bought these at the top of last week? Good luck bud.
There is a 40 absolute floor. Any bear who didn't believe that is retarded.
Yeah if you like wearing a soiled diaper for 16 hours... and that‚Äôs on a good year.

No but let‚Äôs put it this way. If you didn‚Äôt buy in EOD today, you‚Äôre not going to get anything worthwhile by buying in tomorrow morning.
SAC piled into GME??

Just a word of warning. Options chain is probably going to be mad fucked up on TSLA tomorrow. If you‚Äôre trying to get a fill on RH don‚Äôt be surprised if all your money is gone within seconds
May jerk off to my TSLA positions tonight.

Can you post poof? Lowkey this is some crazy shit. Hope you make millions
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm beating myself up for not holding it
Only 1300% gain? How old is he? 

I do 1300% gains twice a month.
Market doesn‚Äôt care. Uber at all time highs
They arent always given advanced notice. Its up to the commitee
Papa Musk told me to invest in other good EVS because TESLA isn't there to crush the competition, but push more adoption.
TSLA has higher priced options, and with the increase in IV tomorrow, many people can't afford them. TSLA's retard strength has been far weaker as of late. Only doing these 10% jumps like once a month now. 

NIO, on the other hand, still has a lot of meme magic left inside it and despite having increased IV due to upcoming earnings, has cheaper options. 

So if you want to follow the money w/ TSLA calls but don't have enough capital, ride the just-as-risky-but-more-magical-wave with NIO.
Make sure you retards DiVeRsifY and have both NIO and Tesla calls, don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket they say
I think at best you‚Äôll break even. You lost 90% of your value. That‚Äôs hard to get back.
Real play is fdx and ups they will deliver most of the vaccines throughout the entire process. Plant to plane to local facility.

Why not buy calls leading up to Dec 2 ?
Anyone that likes to draw with crayons on TSLA charts  have any realistic price targets going into S&P inclusion?
I think you'll have made a lot of friends with the pizza buy.
i‚Äôm literally hoping TSLA hits 445 so i can exit but know it‚Äôs gonna run to 500
If you get even that‚Äôs probably the best you‚Äôll get unless you want to run it till expiration and pray.
They been low key creepin up. Fire season over. Will be buying calls
Really wamt to wait until vix is under 20 to put any money in, this is gonna be hard to sit on the side
Went from 24K to 5k on Tesla calls wonder what this 5k will get me back to :/ lmao I‚Äôm all in Tesla calls
Shut the fuck up retard

Going tits deep in Tesla puts in the morning. Gonna be violent profit taking
Hey have you guys heard of this company called Tesla Motors? I hear they manufacture cars that run on electricity. Sounds like a good investment! I might just pick up a few shares tomorrow, what do you think?
You're still probably gonna be up like 2-3k tho lol congrats!
I'll eat a shoe if there's not Moderna Insider selling this week. I'll eat two shoes if its not explained as some "pre-arranged stock sale organized by a third party"
I feel it goes back and forth. When market is good it‚Äôs soft, when it‚Äôs bad like it was a month ago, people were pissed here. I got told I should be banned for helping someone with IV crush.
Sure they did

Wait, I was only buying and selling these. I didn‚Äôt realize I was supposed to be eating them
US currency = new Zimbabwean dollar
Yeah its just like those "Did everyone in China buy 1 share of NIO" comments yesterday. If WSB bought like 100 shares of AMC for each of the 1.5m WSBers that would be 150 million shares. AMC shares outstanding is 86m. We could own it all easy and vote in our shareholders. Doubtful everyone would participate but if they did it would be insane! WSB has the power of a mid size IB

once again, everyone knew s&p rebalancing and that there was potential for tsla inclusion.

still dont know where you called it...
Would be so sweet.
We are circuit breaking this week.
I'd say Jan 2021 $600c are good too.
Since 2005? At least 6 times.
Ahhh the old, ‚Äúto be homeless or not to be homeless YOLO.‚Äù Classic.
I‚Äôll take a pizza to drown my sorrow of not pulling the trigger on a call that  I was staring at during lunch
Tomorrow could be the 25% day.
TSLA 1k by end of DEC
Congrats and update tomorrow please oh and fuck you
So who are they kicking out of the 500?

Many more months. Maybe not many more women. But probably at least some!

Paid $2.45 ‚Äî> $1,830 + $620 / 1000 (10 contracts = 10x100)

Will be a little more gain than that as is. I‚Äôm not going to take the time to calculate (I just get a ballpark from options profit calculator) but at close IV it will be about $8,600 - that‚Äôs at $462.
How much this shit cost you

Once in a while I come in and lo and behold, there's an intelligent comment!
I think you've got it nailed. I hope so. I'm holding a handful of 11/20s and they've been RED for days. I'm sure they'll (all the Chinese EVs) will gain some spillover from Tesla and finally come back to the ridiculous rise. Happy for me.
$420 gain is better than a 10K loss
When should I sell?
just think about it like being up .13%.
Tesla‚Äôs running way past 500 before boomers get to add it.
Momentum on TSLA is gonna be wild all week. If it hits 25% in a single day, it‚Äôll blast through any and all resistance til it sees $650.

this one is little more clear. give credit where credits due.
There's two ways of interpreting this. Either you're autistic enough to have lost all the money in the first place, or you're an autistic genius for holding from $100 all the way up to the current price. 

Either way, you're autistic.

Yeah. The 410s closed at 7.50. TSLA closed at 408. So ATM calls were so insanely cheap. I was looking at them. #regret.

I‚Äôm be real bro these gains are absolutely nothing lmfao

The most money I've ever made was FOMOing into TSLA right at open. The option chains are usually fucked up and the retard strength out the gate could net you 200% in 90 seconds
They need dumb money to buy overpriced stock.

Yep congrats retard
Sell em at open and put some profit on 500 calls.
The tulip meant nothing. The only significance was the very fact that someone else was willing to pay more for it. It was just the belief the hope I daresay that someone else was willing to pay more for the item than they paid for.

Why didn‚Äôt post before this news so that we all could have bought along with you? Let me guess, you felt ashamed to hold those calls is why you never posted before..?
I don't understand, I picked up 20 5/21 17.5c today and they filled instantly. Also grabbed 1000 shares.
Has SP500 been pricing in the TSLA inclusion this whole time?  Would explain the rally

Ya he's directionally right on most stocks. He's often wrong when he discusses sectors in general because of short term vs long term trends.  IE he claims he was right on the whole oil sector because of the shit it took in march.  But he's right when he's like if you going to buy oil stocks buy XOM or Chevron, and not anything riskier than BP.  Good advice on the tickers, so so advice on the sector as a whole.
Ok that's it I'm buying

The play was TSLA today. IV gonna be mega high on TSLA, if you buy, its big risk.

You could ride the wave with NIO, who's also going to have elevated IV from earnings after close tomorrow, but contracts will be cheaper and NIO still has more meme magic.
U don‚Äôt wanna get in cheaper?
Excellent call
anyone here work at ci ta del? i'll have an on-site with them soon and not sure if I should answer 'buy 1dte tech calls' for every question
In all seriousness I won't but damn do I wish I held calls right now.
You must be new here Because I‚Äôm used to it
is ":she" gains?
[deleted]
Can relate
Probably not
400*
If you aren‚Äôt learning anything. Quit. If you learned something and have the discipline to never make that same mistake. It‚Äôs a paid lesson and continue.
It‚Äôs called student loans or margin
Now imagine if you had been all in on Tsla and cbat only
It‚Äôs not about being right or wrong about a stock. It‚Äôs about self control and not panic selling or panic buying. I think it‚Äôs the hardest part in investing/trading and not picking the good stock.
[deleted]
This is his research lmao
the contracts will likely be worth 1k-2k depending on IV tomorrow. Possibly more.
Momey makin money money makin
FOMO on $TSLA

Tomorrow morning:

‚ÄúThese 450c at $1500 are a steal!!‚Äù
I bought 359p at the top, didn‚Äôt wanna hold all day and sold em for a loss after being up. They will print tmrw
Haha this right here

YEAAAAA
/ES futs are selling right now (could easily turn around over night) and VIX barely budged today despite the mooning. P/C ratio was significantly lower but still rising and from my perspective, looked SPY didn't sell today simply because sellers weren't really around today.
It might as well just go straight to 694.20
Grats on your Tesla car
Tesla calls tomorrow ?
Holy fuck buddy
Doesn‚Äôt count as foresight when you have the same thought every morning lmao
I would review the September drop. I was thinking of hedging my puts with the same position but I‚Äôm likely just going to double down in the morning. Best of luck and my apologies for misreading that lol.
I‚Äôm holding 22 contracts of Tesla Jan 2022 ranging from 300-500 . Not a millionaire yet but I think I‚Äôll be up a decent amount.

Spy to 370 minimum this week
98% down on my TSLA 455 calls for Friday. What will happen to them? I need this to get pumped to the outer edge of the solar system.
Probably did it in Dark pools
Hopefully! I don't know whether to sell or ride it. May convert to a spread to lock gains.

Let it be known that today, 11/16/2020, is the day that everyone ALMOST bought Tesla calls ü§£
just insert more tokens lmao
here is what is going to happen:

hedge fund boys will sell their 11/20 to retards here and all other brainless elons believers, also theta gang will win on friday as usual

set up a stop loss of your gain % and ride it.  Sell when you feel is right.
Wrong, he trimmed to 1.7 Million Shares, idk where you see that
I‚Äôm only down 48% all time now, slowly but surely
My TSLA 455 call I bought last week is back alive
How much in Nio calls are you holding through earnings?
holy shit, I added XOM to my list, then I see this.  Now I have to remove it.
wtf did you call? all you did was ask if someone saw something lol..?

and why arent you a millionaire if you called something
So Calls or Puts?
Good answer, thanks for that!  I guess he's done better than I imagined.
Clears 60 easy... bet. save this and message me after ER and we talk again.
damn automod. n-a-t. 10k calls expired worthless!
There was probably a massive deposit at some point along the way, we don‚Äôt know about.
NIO and TSLA like PB & J
Patience is money
It‚Äôs a tease.  We might get 30 minutes of gains but then tards will buy the dip.  Back in the hole we go.

It's so volatile, you gotta buy any options near the money or else you will get fucked by vega. Shares could be a 10 bagger in less than a decade; there are some rumors that companies which have implemented their system have seen boosts in revenue, and as the news spreads will get more contracts. Their current contracts on the books will be providing revenue for 4 years on average. 

The current trend for gov't is also looking like they want to push things to private providers instead of doing it themselves, and Palantir is saying they will only work with western democracies. They also got Project Maven from Google which is the Pentagon AI program. They are also big on COVID data for a few countries, with plans for contact tracing in the UK.

Looks like some data are outdated. Global electric car sales finished September 2020 up 91% on September 2019, with a record market share of 4.9% for September 2020, and 3.4% YTD. Many EV models were announced this year, so I guess EV pressure can be a headache for oil companies around the world.

No, revenue is the total amount of earnings (the amount of money you made in profit plus the amount you spent) and profit is the total amount of money generated (your revenue minus everything that you spent).

Talked to way to many people fully leveraged into nio today. Most of them had the same answer. "ill cover my margin call after earnings" Ive heard this song and dance before. It doesnt end well.
Yeah we hit 500 eow they‚Äôll be worth 1200 a piece. 480 at open will be about 900. That‚Äôs a nice fuckin payday lol congrats!

YOu're an idiot for thinking NYC will be normal this Christmas. They're instituting mandatory quarantines, temperature checks, gate arrival Covid tests, and they will gradually make those criteria stricter and impose fines as cases spike, plus they will close off all the normal attractions in the city like the Rockefeller tree just to prevent crowd gatherings. High chance of holiday getting ruined. Reschedule/ rebook a Republican state for your vacation.

Bullish for PLTR
Pltr for war?
I bought leaps, they are involved in contact tracing shit and to me as a crazy bastard a company like this with many government contracts involved in contact tracing after being around for over a decade goes public during covid??? I had to get in cause it feels like theres something yuge under the surface.

You could do that, but then you have to worry about that bitch theta lmao

So you‚Äôre telling me my 1 is gonna be ~5k. I‚Äôll take it.
So my 160 weekly calls was a bad investment?
Are they all options ?

why is the gme news bullish
Pltr has waaay more upside in my retarded opinion
This mentality is how you lose money.

You hit the jackpot. I think it will run up tomorrow possibly the rest of the week.

If you're serious, I think you're confusing revenue with profit...
This statement is no different than going to a casino, playing roulette, putting bet on 29 then it it lands on 7 you go "oooooh... fuck I should have put it on 29".
My guess is NIO is the reason why TSLA's inclusion is happening in the first place.
Who?
I get that... but like... are we taking the profits to Isengard?  Is PLTR sauron?  I don‚Äôt understand the specific logistics of the analogy.
Holy fucking cockwhores Batman, you're looking at 6 figure gains if it gets closer to 500. I'm ecstatic myself. I've been working hard, scraping hundreds from various positions for weeks. My tsla calls deep in red for the whole time..... Had to sell a couple even. I'm just praying this holds until I can sell.
Tesla is back bitches. Suck it NIO you were the side bish.
Damn that nio dip on Friday really wiped most of y‚Äôall out, it‚Äôs too quiet in here
Find his username. He‚Äôs definitely here.
Yes
Fuckkkk I meant puts least of my worries rn tho lmao
Yes. Anyone who thinks nio is hitting 80 for earnings is out of their noggin. They would have to release some outlaaaandish shit tomorrow to hit 80 by eow. I don‚Äôt see anything over 60 for tomorrow. Maybe over 60 Wednesday with spectacular earnings and some great 2021 guidance. I‚Äôd prefer we grind so I can hold through earnings. If we go up too much tomorrow before close people are more likely to take profit and paper hands back down even on good earnings.
Not supposed to tank but we are likely to see a pullback followed by 4 years of a static market. Green energy will likely see increases though.
That's a really good one.

Skynet. They make 'unstructured data' (data of all types, from every form of media e.g. emails, texts, photographs, fucking everything that tracks you) into digestible forms. They have recently (past couple of years) been going from strictly DoD anti-terrorism type contractors to using their software for making businesses more efficiently analyze their data.

'big data analysis', it's literally the future. Use computers and AI's to do the work of thousands of people.
Short or long?
Fuck you and congrats

If tesla tanked the market last time with its offering imagine next time lol

They probably go out at open into TSLA. Beware
Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been buying puts the last few weeks, just wanted some reasoning for why we‚Äôll be red when that last rally took another 3k from me at the end. Good luck tomorrow brother
yeah you definitely make it lol /s
That‚Äôs literally our job

Going to be nice in the a.m.
Nah, if you open a cash account you can trade with settled funds. So if you have an account value of 1,000, you could make 10, $100 trades. The funds settle the next day.

So when you make a $200 trade with a $1000 account, you can only trade with $800 for the rest of the day. Let‚Äôs say you made $100 on the trade, then tomorrow you could trade with $1100.
Geez you're not smart
Ha! Gayyyyy

NYC is pretty good, most people are being safe and working around covid.  It's a little less fun now that it's getting cold becuase sitting out in the park with your to-go drinks and food isn't as nice. But it still works. People are out, but they're being safe by staying outdoors and wearing masks and keeping distance.

Edit: I don't know what these other people are talking about. Maybe Manhattan is a hellhole, I never go these days with work from home. Come out to Brooklyn, we're having a totally ok time.
Congrats king. I‚Äôm a pussy and own shares, maybe I can help pitch in for extra napkins

What I meant with my Fed comment is that unlimited QE and HY buying provides unlimited liquidity (a factor that both suppresses vol and encourages risk-on activities). On top of liquidity, the suppression of the risk free rates also encourages aggressive risk-on trades by pensions that need to hit target returns.
Is that the true cost of this market?
So who else already had 11/20 TSLA calls. We selling at open or what

KNDI should moon soon
Oh fuck me and my covered calls
Fuck naw
Not if the dollar is dying
Buy NIO 50s if you can. It will usually peak back up and you can make some cash. Remember when buying naked puts or calls, you are literally just looking to make money off the premium. Don't get greedy, if your contract hits like 30% take the gains unless it looks like it has a lot of upward momentum. 

Nio has been riding 45-48ish lately. Dipping down to low 40s sometimes. I bought it on the dip this morning and made $120 on a single 44.5c 11/20. 

I wouldn't play it tomorrow unless you want to get hit with IV crush. It's earnings call after hours.
What stock hype flamed out the fastest this year on here? I'm going SNOW.

This one is tenuous
Is it me or does this market make money seem like it isn‚Äôt real? Like it grows on trees.
Took profit, still holding some bc I‚Äôm a moron
AFAIK, the passive funds are given like at least a day's notice before the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is made formally. If they were buying up TSLA all day how come the stock price didn't move that much? I know VTI and other Total market funds won't need to buy this one but all S&P 500 funds should have to.
As long as they dont crash into a Bear on the runway with 300 souls on board... twice... should be ok.
It seems like it‚Äôs settled down now, to be honest I think if anything it‚Äôll go back down
Well, do you want a super conservative/traditional life with repressed children and a diminishing sex life?
TSLA CALL HOLDERS, count your tendies right now. How much you got?

Lol. They now have almost $1 billion in cash. It‚Äôs fine.
Just buy shares, if you wanna be safe

I like plug, I‚Äôm long term bullish.. but this was clear market manipulation. For the time being I‚Äôm bearish, but I‚Äôll switch to a long position once this finds a support level. This is due for a retrace back to $15. This is just my opinion

All I know is their (relatively) new HQ in Houston is more like a fucking millennial Tech HQ than any other oil company HQ in the world.  When i was there I fucking got hot chocolate in some rubbermaid cup that the janitors wash at night.

clearly not right now but maybe in december when it‚Äôs actually part of S&P

Then they have to make more planes, bullish
Roll it out forever to lose more? This was over the summer when TSLA was going parabolic. Closing it at a $50k loss saved me losing even more

So which stonk is getting kicked out to make room for Elongated Musk?
That is where my mind is at.  Makes me feel dirty though.
I could see a multi day run up. Its kind of Tesla's thing. Imo not too late to get in. Its the biggest momentum stock I know
This is completely untrue. Normally, the funds could move shares from S&P 400 Midcap and S&P 600 to S&P 500, but Tesla is not in those indices.
In his world he won so the market is up. Clever.

Once they announce the price of the new shares PLUG will likely settle near or below that price, at that point go all in because PLUG has serious long term retard strength. This news today was just good business for PLUG and bad short term news for the share holders.
Tomorrow TSLA gaps up massively at open and slowly fades all day.

He posted his positions idiot. It‚Äôs the last picture
I sold 8 contracts, I would have been up 34k, I sold for a 250 dollar gain...
If anything NIO is going to blow up tomorrow. 

Why the fuvk am I going to FOMO into TSLA at nearly $500 a share? Obviously TSLA is a success so I want to get in another company that‚Äôs not nearly as big.
Weird flex.
Calls nio AND tsla
Someone‚Äôs getting fucked by margin
Damn bro. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that
Oochie owie

Sold too early this morning thinking it couldn't hold 15% gains. Gonna jump back in if it does tank.

I mean, a book called ‚ÄòWhite Fragility‚Äô became a best seller this year. That‚Äôs pretty obvious to be hating on white people. Everyone would lose their shit if someone wrote a book calling any other race fragile.
Hey quick math here. Sorry for the ... math.....   Your $60 call costs $1,785 as in $17.85 a share. Someone just bought NIO at 45.... took almost $18 off the table so he paid $27.... and will make a 122% return on his investment if you cash.....   fits perfectly with this place.
I wish I knew.  I'm dying to take a larger position, but that 50% run up and the impending lockup release makes me nervous.
Yes the move is tesla calls, no matter how high iv is, the fucking move is fucking tesla calls. The money is guaranteed. If you have the money and the stomach for it, but for God sakes not a weekly. At least go two weeks out, it will go past 502
You can‚Äôt spell TSLA without NIO

I was really pumped up watching the video until the end there then I was like oh shit I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not a üåàüêª but...

Imagine if you sold naked TSLA calls today
He go NIO
Im actually gonna have it printed and hang it on my wall.
From tendyful to tendyless
$475 11/20 LETS GOOOO
of course it's a risk

it could drop 50%, and trade horizontal till the end of time, or go to 0
I dunno mine are already -70% on my 500c leaps but I'll gladly take breakeven.

You TSLA fuckers just keep winning and winning don't you... absolutely insane. There really are no other companies nearly as exciting out there, and my dumbass just can't come to terms with that and invest. Grats
yeah then it's fake.  Buying Pwr should be much more lol.  Nice try!

Also 2150 TSLA shares will have a margin of about 700k, not 400k.
$TSLA inclusion in the S&P makes sense when you think about if it were added at close today it would be the 9th largest component by market cap and 408th most profitable.

Bought a 420 11/20 call today for shits and giggles. And  I am doing both right now
Love pizza.
Cmon man they‚Äôre both good
It‚Äôs only 10 contracts, not 100 brotha.... I‚Äôll probably make $10-12k assuming the price doesn‚Äôt drop too much from where it is now.
now they have a mask mandate.  lol.
I‚Äôm already down 50% fuck da risk
Don‚Äôt fuck with coworkers.
I sold 6 contracts for $300 profit today and it‚Äôd likely be 8-10k each tomorrow im gonna go DIE

Sold 100 tesla stock afterhour at initial spike at 442. Didn‚Äôt even knew it was S&P 500 inclusion. Missed out 2200$.
TSLA is fucking changing lives tomorrow. IV was historically low. This will be the biggest baggers TSLA call holders have ever seen.
Why February?
nice
SPY futures are trending red right now, and trailing NASDAQ. As for "why", I think we both know the answer... there is no reason for ATHs in this climate of consumer-spending decline, lockdowns, and higher unemployment

People holding past tomorrow or quicksell this week?
fuck your fasle prophet nio daddy musky is back baby
About 2 high end hookers and a quarter kilo of coke
Seriously tho, my suggestion would be to sell at open. When you sell, put some insanely high price that you will 100% not regret your decision. I play wheel strategy on TSLA, even a normal 2% up or down day, the premium on the options are insanely high
Additional offering of shares.
If it hits $75, I‚Äôll buy you one. If it hits $40, I‚Äôm gonna ask you for one.
Whew spicy
Sitting on 100 stocks at 20.1... may sell em off idk
Puts, duh. No support at that height.
Naw, you fam.
I think they need 3 consecutive quarters with profit so its not happening soon. For sp500
so should I sell tomorrow and buy back in?
Yeah this is going to go well. Iowa is pretty defiant iirc. Expect lots of don't tread on me stuff
I'm a 30 year old successful entrepreneur.
If you sell that‚Äôs still about a 10% overall gain or 2% a year, so at least your money kept up with inflation. Still better off than if you just left it in a bank account. Now the emotional damage that roller coaster caused is a whole another thing.
And happy cake day to you solid present
A Bull will bang your GF with this info
Lol it's up 2400%
So I have a sure shot with this attractive girl at my work.  26 years old (I‚Äôm 30) and traditional/conservative type.  Can tell she wants to be wifey.  Super petite and friendly and has a cute voice.  

But there‚Äôs this girl I‚Äôm talking to on a dating app who is a literal 10/10.  Played a small role on a show I watch.  She‚Äôs 22 and a flight attendant.  Seems to click with me.  Wants to meet up when she‚Äôs back in town.

I think jones soda JSDA is going to blow up in the next year. I know that‚Äôs kind of out of left field but still. They have a cane sugar soda that is better than corn syrup. And they got rid of the last CEO that was wasting money left and right. I drank it basically my whole childhood then found out a couple months ago they‚Äôre publicly traded. It‚Äôs trading sideways on no volume rn I bought in for the yolo. It‚Äôs sitting at $0.15 It‚Äôll be a dollar at some point probably

Congrats my guy, what other plays do you have lined up?
Do I close out my tesla 11/20 $410/415 call debit spread in the morning or wait for everyone to fomo? 

Do I take advantage of the high IV or wait to see if the price goes higher
IV
yolo tesla weeklies until january guaranteed 100% returns every week gg fellas
Yeah cause ‚ÄúPfizer‚Äôs‚Äù vaccine is actually not Pfizer‚Äôs it‚Äôs BioNtech‚Äôs vaccine technology. Pfizer is just the manufacturer. Moderna is king and the USA leads in biotech in the world by far. We got the best one

Additionally, restaurants and bars must close at 10 p.m.

Tesla up 18% today.  Gonna look like Nio did the month but actually deserve it.

You hv balls of steel I like you man. Gonna follow your trades cos u definitely know what's hot
Ooh, I don't know but that's a nice juicy option you have there.  Now comes the eternal question... take profits and be happy, or hold and hope for more?

I can't give you advice here, it could go either way.  You'll be able to close tomorrow morning for sure and take a nice chunk of change, but yeah if you hold it longer and TSLA keeps climbing especially in the next few days you'll make even more.  Then again if it stalls out and dips back, even if it climbs again later in the month or early in Dec you might have lost enough value due to theta decay that you never make it back to where you were.

I'd say make a fresh comment and point out your position and expiration, and ask WSB what they'd do.  The true degenerates will tell you to hold until 12/3 LOL.  But you'll probably get better advice from a few others than what I can give you, I usually sell options so I'm not as savvy with how to manage plays buying options.  GL!
This looks like $BUD calls
he dumped his entire COST holdings
ü§ó
$450c was .75c at close
Yes another TSLA post, so downvote away.

Anyways, with the S&P inclusion taking effect on the 21st of December, do you think TSLA will rally upwards like it‚Äôs done in the past? Or will it sell off from the news?

TSLA ATH (Premarket) was $535 / $502 (52WH). I can definitely see us touching that magic number by next week.
If robinhood has 0dte, and u buy one when u have no day trades left, nor the money to execute, 

what happens?

You sure?
I need spy at 355 then 360 not too much to ask for right? Zoom at 450 after stock split tomorrow and docu split also fastly split plz
Easy first ask friends and family then when you make insane returns on NIO calls people will be begging to invest in your fund

So blink is up 32% today + after hours, in case you ever wanted to see what a pump and dump looks like in real time.

The catalyst? They made an announcement that they‚Äôre adding retractable spools for their charging cords at their stations. That‚Äôs it.

The volume today was over 4 times its average volume. You can see huge amounts of trading between two very distinct times today (11 am and 2pm).

Between Tesla cars, Tesla trucks, the battery technology, they're very diverse. They're missing what sectors of the economy? Like basically tourism, food service, railroads, and sales. And hospitals/manufacturing. That's not much to not have a finger in.
You realize you'd have a fiduciary duty to your clients, right? You can't just yolo people's money on meme stocks.

Edit: for a loss and it was like 20k

You're so full of yourself that you're delusional enough to believe your claim was accurate. Truly, you're more pathetic than I thought.
Nice man
Do you use margin though?
RIP that username, gonna seem bearish by eow.
Well. I think we are at the beginning of a bull run. So you could make hella money. But if we pull back and those are weeklies... slaughtered boiz.

When you‚Äôre wrong like that find another stock to put your money in

Well since this is r/wallstreetbets i suggest you yolo it into tesla and nio calls

This was on Friday after they had announced subscribers that beat predictions for the quarter and briefly discussing jumping into sports wagering.

I love it, I personally started using Fubo about 6 months ago when I cut the cord and the streaming service is awesome. jumped in on this at the open today after doing some reading over the weekend about the sports wagering growth opportunity
You definitely have it misunderstood, no
Up of course
Probably not this week may be thanksgiving rally next week.

Before
It‚Äôs better than a lot of people on here

Agreed. Granted I'm not particularly doing anything to improve the quality.
I mean it's getting in in December, idk if it's LATE late, but yes it's late, idk why would I sell my fucking shares last week. Hooray
$1k in Tesla today will open at $30k tomorrow if this price holds
I want to start my own hedge fund. How do I find ~~morons~~ investors to trust me with their money?
Why? You know all these funds will be buying up Tesla over the next month.

thoughts on moving 8k of my RKT  position into PSTH? im getting thirsty for quick gains
Lost money on nio calls? And now you want to lose more on spy putz?
FSR is a pump and dump... same pattern always...

Haha your username fits your personality as you‚Äôre just as basic as internet explorer. 

But i‚Äôm glad my jab at your lack of taco culture hit home.
Sunset date on some Fed programs that bolstered the market is December 31st. Core Companies are still in rough shape. Layoffs still to come once rebalancing occurs EOY. And looming mortgage defaults. A lot of uncertainty.
This sub has become unfuckingbearable. Just when I thought the millions of low grade NIO posts were over now I‚Äôm about to see an even larger amount of low grade TSLA posts

The whole country runs on debt is a big one. Many people living paycheck to paycheck while owning a house and car is one example of just how quickly shit can turn south. Commercial real estate going down the shitter. Malls being sold at 20% of what they were bought for.

I‚Äôll wait till it climbs another 10% from here
Is it true that JD ER didn‚Äôt really impress investors? I know the stock dropped, but I assumed that regardless as people were riding it for earnings.
After
Will we FINALLY crack 30,000 tmrw?
When does PLTR get added to ndq or spy?
I sold tsla 11/18/20 420 calls for a tiny profit, should have held on.. F
True I wish I had bought more, but hey you never know what will happen until it already does so, at least you‚Äôre on the right side of the trade :)
Ok retard, one of the most ridiculous run ups in this entire exaggerated year and you want to hold your inflated IV calls through earnings.

At least cover them first
You chose not to trade it or you ran out of money and margin?
Through just stocks too it seems kind of impossible
I‚Äôd personally probably sell first 5 mins at open.
So I have a TSLA $407.5c 12/4... how long should I hold this in your opinion.
So you have the ppl who are fomo about tsla but what about the ppl who can‚Äôt even afford to get in at this rate? Will they just settle for cheaper EV? Coughniocough
Ya I have NIO and LI calls but I still feel sad, haven‚Äôt had TSLA calls since September :(
Yeah I know thats what Ive been tellin these hustlers
i'm up 15k
Space Karen? Why what which who
All shares too. Crazy
Buy 1,342 shares of PSTH and hold through December. Won‚Äôt regret it.
Beforw
type 3 or 4 random letters and get call options on that stock, shower in tendies next
Please update tomorrow your gains
sold my NIO at the end of today and kept my FSR. my account was not made to last..
you're right.  And did/didn't covid.
yep, I probs will after 30 mins of IV settling down. Shit always moons for like 2-4 days
Should I sell tomorrow? Fuck I'm panicking
you don't address a retard by sir
What do you want? I'll see if I can afford it after I close my positions.
Where is LI and KNDI in this?
yes

Well now. Someone has big balls.


And I think this dude sold some amz, pypl, baba etc to take a pcg position.
Tesla will likely do a capital raise which will lower the stock price once it is announced.

I like pltr long term, not sure how volatile it will be over the next week/days
Gme gang anyone ?
after
Won‚Äôt even see it coming. I‚Äôm pretty sure my wife will kill me in my sleep
Been balls deep into Enph
It‚Äôs crashed on most other earnings even when positive
CRM was added to the S&P 500 in 2008 when its market cap was around 6B
I honestly don‚Äôt know.  Stock up 1000% this year it might be time to take my money and run at $50+.  Wait for consolidation and buy back in.
Tesla gunna take a huge dump before the end of the week. This is a similar push like the stock split news, doesn‚Äôt actually change anything though

fuck the retards here, give it to some poor kids or something...

Yes, this is true but the speaker of the house is the one that recognizes and validates the electors. They can send a rogue set of electors but they won‚Äôt be recognized or counted.
What do u plan to do with your gains
Look what Xpev and Li auto did at earnings. Why would you think nio would be anything different.
this aged well
110?

Damn, I'm holding $425C. If market open pass $480, we're in the 3K probably.

Once Dow is done being boomer, nasdaq will be boomer
Depends on the reaction to the earnings as well as the current valuation and potential for the stock to grow.
No.* The EV drafthorse gonna pull the rest up along with it.
Felling cute, might buy TSLA calls tomorrow, idk.
Blank poles
Buy a Tesla model 3
He tweeted a heart... That was the hint... And I didn't get it and sold all my tesla calls yesterday... fml
dude 500 by morning lol
Ah no country for old men and there will be blood have similar themes and locations. If you've never seen there will be blood might be my favorite ever. Enjoy. Jackie brown was not for me but hateful 8 is great. Walton goggins and sammie J kill it
Inclusion isn‚Äôt until 12/21 so Tesla will have no affect on spy.
My calls gonna print
DIX, GEX, rsi says something's happening this week. take profit when it does though
Yep! Got out at 11.25
thats not how a hobby forum works. you come here to give ideas yes BUT also to ask questions related to the hobby.
Mango Jones and friends
TSLA 460c 11/20. Buy it on the 16th. Tesla will get included into the sp 500 and jump up after hours. I must go back to the future now. Good luck
How do you buy after hours?

Wait what?
Sold half, holding half.
I dont have any plays to make... should i double down on PLTR?
What time is the Nio earning? Before or after market?
Red or green it‚Äôs bull delight. Bulls always win, everyday duh
Haha some guys probaly sold tsla shares to fomo into Nio hahahah
The general consensus is to sell before so I will hold
Remember people were saying nio was hitting $25 this week ü§°
Valid question
I bought 6.8k of regular old PFE stonks back in May in anticipation of a vaccine. I‚Äôm currently up $1.95. AMA
U should have rolled over to further otm but still $$
Any background on this or just a hunch???
Relax boys, there's enough autism in the market for both TSLA and NIO. There isn't some zero-sum game for retard energy, plenty to go around
hurrrr durrrrr lemme use boomer ETFs as guidelines to market health

the same ETFs JPOW pumped to the tits with printed cash

2022 maybe?  2024?  idk when.  this shit is gonna collapse hard.  see you in the bread lines
keep PLTR
Bought it at 320 back in early 2019 indeed i am
Prolly gonna fomo spike to 500 and then people profit take for a dip. How far?  Not sure.
Last time when tsla was at 470, I bought 30k worth calls, and I was burned to hell. 
Never touching it again if it is at 460
Bro I‚Äôm feeling better than ever. I‚Äôm loving this news. AH is low volume bullshit
No, it's called "De grote beer in het blauwe huis"
LEAPs dont get IV crushed nearly as much as the closer expirations, sometimes not at all
It's the best. I use fidelity too but it's gay
Thanks bro hell yeah! 

It‚Äôs kind of been my goal to make enough to get one, this is the first time I‚Äôve felt close to being there
Fuck off. BAN
Sell at 9:40 or whenever IV gain starts to slow if it‚Äôs really ripping
Invest in Tesla 3 hrs ago
how can you tell what the price is?
I‚Äôm going to buy first thing in the morning and immediately neg my portfolio.
Who did that?
I started options around September. I think I'd have 10-25% more net value if I never touched this shit

I expect market to be flat tomorrow and won‚Äôt be surprised  if end the week around 360. Till Trump steps down or starts the transition process around next week or after thanksgiving which will cause markets to moon again.
But it dropped again. Did you sell?

If this dildo costs $5 normally and I mark it up to $7 then put a sale price of $5, are you getting a deal?

You speak the truth. 

I did blow up my account. Twice. Once in 2000 shorting the dot.com bubble. I blew up 3 weeks before the crash. 

And almost blew it up two more times. 

Lesson here is always take some out so you can make it back and never short. After 2004 I realized shorting is for retards. Markets go up over time and you are just sailing against the wind shorting. Make life easier. Just buy the dip.
Hold until its 467
Just transferred 1k to rh. Liquidating everything tomorrow for Tesla calls

TSLA $600
Tesla 110? About $40,000
Go back to this morning and tsla 11/20 $420 calls.
Mainly playing the new spiderman. The preinstalled game is actually really dope too. Bugsnax is actually dope too. Was debating the new COD but the reviews are mixed and I hate paying for the same game with new maps.
FCEL sounds like femcel

Dont touch this boys
Stocks too high imo
Cost basis too high imo. Rather just buy shares
I'm mad hungry my guy
I agree with you. But that is just too logical
Get yourself some tits action on Eros.com or all in gme 1/21/2021 30c
Sell my weekly TSLA 500c at open or hold? I'm currently down 90%
Bought dirt cheap long calls on SPCE today on that dip. It‚Äôs bound to go up when they reschedule the launch and it will go parabolic if the launch is successful. Easy money!
Hoping BABA comes back up a little tomorrow
Guys just buy deep OTM puts on all the other 499 stocks in the SP500. At least one of them will print due to being excluded from it

This is what people miss. Companies are definitely going elsewhere for labor when they can.
Once nasdaq is done crashing, the Dow will take off
reformed bear here but probably the global pandemic and political strife in america.  two bigguns right there for you.  this market, to a bear (and to everyone, let's be honest) makes almost zero fuckin sense

If it doesn't moon more in after hours why would it moon more premarket? Just curious why
How about the guy that turned $2 into several hundreds of million?
In this market this is extremely Bullish.
Who‚Äôs holding NIO through earnings tomorrow after the market closes?
is #GME gang fukd?Hope not , I always root for the bulls. Sometimes reality doesn't match my hopes tho :(
Did you take the one less travelled by?
Fumble
The future is fucked?
May not be a bad idea
go NIO
God damn it takes my upvote.
Now stop and buy ETFs like a normal person before you lose it all again

well my calls worked out
Is bought some shares today of Tesla because I saw it‚Äôs been trading sideways for two months. Then bam! The announcement after hours. Did the same thing before nvda and appl climbed back in July. Bought like a couple days before a stock split announcement.
Don't worry, I'll make sure to get an extra night out this weekend just for you. Oooo how scary I'll be going out drinking without a mask, it's terrifying isn't it.

nobody tell him
Hi
Yeah Smh lol
Added to S&P 500
You could google it, but would then find out that Norbert's Gambit doesn't apply here because TSLA doesn't trade on a Canadian exchange to make it work.

TL;DR: Find company that is both US and Canadian listed ($SHOP for example). Buy Canadian shares ($SHOP.TO) in $CAD. Call brokerage and get them to convert into US listed shares ($[SHOP.TO](https://SHOP.TO) into $SHOP). Sell $SHOP shares and get USD without having to pay exchange rate commission.

Let's agree on something: the market is future facing, right?

So if you agree with this, and you're bearish - what exactly is your thesis?
is it a good time to buy LEAPs after an earnings report because of the IV crush ?
Vodka Distilleries will be more profitable.
I have 10 12/4 500c calls.

Fucked up with UPS today. Had 1 11/20 170c left which opened at .495 or something. Went down to .20 for which I stared at the screen the whole time when I should‚Äôve bought 10 contracts at least. By 10:30 it‚Äôs at .78 which was 45% profit and I sold. 

Fast forward to now and UPS is 170 AH and that contract closed at 1.40. Kill meeeeee
Me too dude

Nah. AMD will steadily trade between 77 and 88 for the foreseeable future and be the solid bedrock of theta gang in the sea of YOLOs
I've done very minimal options, kinda just do it for a real small % for fun.  But yes so far I'm pretty bad.

That was the bare minimum example just to show it‚Äôs silly to think it‚Äôs impossible to save. You completely leave out any gains from your numbers. That money isn‚Äôt just sitting it‚Äôs accruing compound interest. Who knows what it would be at 25. If you actually factored that compound interest in and took your numbers another 5-10 years out that person would have tens of thousands. Thanks for writing out a rough example of exactly what I‚Äôm talking about. And just think about if your numbers were done with $6 $7 or $8 the numbers grow 20% each time for a minuscule in the moment difference. Literally 18-30 you have tens of thousands saved up.
Eh prolly 11 ain‚Äôt none of us scared anymore, what‚Äôs their to be fearful of..amirite?

TSLA 500c 11/23.
Commercial plumber here. I know the feeling. It's hard to work and trade at the same time when you don't have a desk job. Feels like you're always chasing the latest move.
Tesla was added to S&P 500. December 21 it goes into effect.
100, 200 shares?
You got fucked on TSLA, fucked on SPY and fucked all the way off Robinhood, dam bro.
bro... when there is a TSLA news nothing else matters. just sell in the morning and get into ELON.
I got wiped out of 11/20 VXX calls after the e1ection.

Not necessarily, if they have solid earnings it could definitely hit and make you a lot of money. More likely you will get IV crushed a good bit and lose maybe $70 or a little more per option but it‚Äôs a good lesson and honestly not a bad earnings play imo.

No taxes on TFSA actually. He's pocketing a full 30k no questions asked
Should be safe bro 400 in play this week imo
why, just fomo into tsla... NIO is having a similar run up as well

Spy call gain porn galore tm
I bought 100 shares at $300, and have no idea what to do now. FYI, I just started investing in March. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs time to hold them or time to fold them, time to walk away or time to run.
haha yes by definition but like you said, other factors come into play on that day. When shareholders get their fat dividend, where do you think they're going to put it? Probably right back into the stock that just paid them big gains. That's why I said it will definitely drop but my bet is it won't be $10 drop on December 2nd
F to the JD calls

SPY to the fucking Moon on a Falcon Heavy Rocket, get on tomorrow \~10-30 mins after open for IV to die down.
Sir this is a casino.
Index funds have to buy it.  Yeah it's a bubble, but one an individual can exploit.  Puts on whoever got knocked off, calls after that company falls in price ect.

Buy more, for 2/19 which will expire after they crush Q4 earnings.
Because its now 100% not a fraud....and a ton of buying must now occur.  Who knows how this will go, though. Unless you got in before this announcement, you are currently batting with two strikes already.
Fuck me I was hovering over the tsla 460 calls on Friday and went with spy puts at the end, sold for loss EOD and locked my rh account. FUCKKK

Btw he said he doesn't know enough about the components of IEP to buy it
Ayro
Lol will be +8% by open their not fooling anyone
I'm going to save you the time of retaking remedial algebra. The reason why those puts are expensive is because they are very much in the money. Those calls are cheap because they are out of the money. Far, far out of the money with very short time to expiration. Even with SP500 inclusion, you would need Elon to announce production of flying cars that cure cancer for those calls to not expire worthless this friday. Those calls may pump a bit tomorrow morning but likely will expire worthless.

U.S. COVID update: More than 73,000 people currently in hospital, up 23% from last week

- In hospital: 73,014 (+3,027)
- In ICU: 14,313 (+616)

Does matter this is just price inclusion not a business plan.  ALL EVs are up.
Tesla calls were soooo cheap before the announcement. Makes me wanna cry üò≠

Still going to hop on the train at open tomorrow to scrounge some tendies.
Tesla in the s&p?
I sold 3k in Calls yesterday........ I need some holy water and some fresh air rn...
+102% 1 month, +126% 3 months, + 201% past year, -6.9% past 5 years
They are spring $420 and I only have two. So it will only be like $10k.

Def on Amazon, daddy Bezos stays pimpin his hoes
the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index of the 500 "largest/best" companies in the US stock market. These ratings are determined by an agency called Standard & Poors. Essentially the S&P is a bellweather for the stock market (if the 500 best companies are doing well, the stock market is doing well). So inclusion into this index is a signal to investors that such companies are past an excessive and volatile growth stage and solidifying as very stable companies (must report 4 straight quarters of profit to be entered, higher scrutiny, etc.).
yea
I'm gutted too. Looks like we might finally get some red tomorrow, sir

Ehhh Barrick still at 3 month lows, was hitting 29 before the vaccine news, gold could go up this week. This play might still be profitable but Buffet sure fucked me out of better tendies
Stop, I can only get so erect.
Well, TSLA is tricky now isn‚Äôt it. I feel like it is fomo but it could still have room to run given the short squeeze, but my guess is premiums are going to be sky high for anything near ATM. I‚Äôd love to see your write up if you get a chance. Still holding NFLX PINS and SNAP, trying to decide what to do about PTON :(. Oh well. üòî Still a big fan of your analysis.
Not for me, my piece of shit ‚Äúcharming fixer upper‚Äù just appraised for 675K, I paid 259K.
The only sector worth playing is EVs change my mind
IM HARD AGHGGHHH
I've got that stupid kinda feeling that it's gonna be a good week.
Where was my signal Elon?!
Get more capital. I lost 18k playing with 5k for 2 years. I deposited 50k in July and I‚Äôm at 66k now. It‚Äôs so cheap to just be able to average down or buy longer dated expiry
Prolly IV (vega) going down faster than what the stock price * delta can cover
Analysts not me. They use stochastic model often with some degree of success. As day, or scalp investors they are not of concern. Only buys and hold investors need to worry.
This is the way
1st week of december
That was so retarded, I feel pride
Don't think anyone was going to
Best thing to do is to honestly take some time away from trading. No point emotionally jumping into something too quick that could hurt you.
[deleted]
what are some stocks that follow TSLA's action closely? I think LAC is glued to it, right? what else?
> even if all these numbers lined up, you have 0 idea when they‚Äôre included, this is 100% speculation and 0 facts, there is no set date for the inclusion

Now we know the inclusion date. What's your next guess base on this new knowledge?
I need it to break 45.
I write software for a living and now feel better about myself, the fuck is that
200
Hold till the 19th
I have ten of them so I hope it go up.

Man cheers on the TSLA calls bro. Nice to know someone will make $$$ tomorrow.

Literally had the option menu open looking at 4/15c 11/20 at lunch but didn‚Äôt pull the trigger üòî
Hold
Hey man it‚Äôs literally a 50-50 so ur the chances are pretty good on either end
CVS and AMD calls fuck all of you retards
Why are people still using Robinhood
You can tell she loathes him for having the confidence to speak his mind. She knows she can never do that, cares too much about what everyone thinks.
Hold until expiration
To be fair they spiked pretty well today. Looked like it might have been institutional buying for this morning pump one, but hard to tell.
HOLD IT TOMORROW AND SELL IT EOD WEDS IF YOU SEE WEAKNESS. VOLUME PAY ATTENTION TO BUY/SELL VOLUME, THE VOLUME. SEE IF YOU CAN SEE THE AMOUNT OF CALL OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW MORNING. IF YOU SEE A STRAIGHT PUMP AND HARD GREEN OPEN WEDNESDAY YOU HOLD THAT SHIT TIL THURSDAY SOLDIER. YOU SEE A GREEN OPEN. IF SPY HITS 365 AND FALLS SELL. IF SPY SOMEHOW GOES ABOVE 365 HOLD. YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY NO MATTER WHAT ITS TESLA
Which one did you make money off of? Isn‚Äôt that good enough?
30k CAD is pretty poverty but if this is a TFSA account which almost every Canadian will be investing in first due to it being completely tax sheltered, then OP isn't getting taxed a dime on his capital gains.

Not that he was getting taxed anyway due to how poverty 30k a year is LOL
No, everyone going to need to buy TSLA in their profolio soon in the next few week or so. Hold until 470, and make $4.
Funds will buy it.
Apply to work at wendys
not if ELon has anything to say about it!
445 here
I think NIO 65 EOW is not unreasonable now with this TSLA news..EVs are hot right now
He should do it... If he's in here asking what to do with luna-gains
I will do the same
PLTR
wow youre retarded
$500 by earnings
I don't know how to read this.
If you actually look at his charitable trust portfolio it is winner after winner. Only reason retards hate him is he antagonizes people ESPECIALLY robin hood investors. Take feelings out of the equation and listen to this guy. For example I bought Grow Generation (up 300%) Plug Power (up 270%) on his recommendations. Oh yeah he was pounding the table recommending BA when it was at 168 ish. His wins are 10 to 1 his losses.
They think big money has to buy it off their at inflated prices, but little do they know TSLA is going to announce a capital raise. Its largest ever.
Because sp etfs can only buy it on the exact date
So they will have to pay any price it has on such date causing a squeeze
Brother same to you, I have a Tesla call so I‚Äôm chilling rn. Wish us both best of luck so we can get these Tendies

Game of Trades guy is making super bullish videos. He is my inverse signal. I feel better about my puts
If I have a call debit spread but I think it will close higher than it will open tomorrow, would it be smart to close the call I wrote in order to get rid of the cap on my profit, or should I just buy another call.
we wont know how much premiums are, so can only speculate.
The fuck were you trading heh
Funds are going to have to buy shares
ophh
Lol
Big rich dudes buy much many stonk and do not sell. This is both an endorsement of the company and helps stabilize the stonk.
This is the exact repeat of last week

Monday moon off vaccine

Tuesday: tech climb back value sells off

Wednesday: tech climb back value sells off

Thursday: Everything rallies

One reason I am bullish about economy short term minute the vaccine hits people are gonna rush and spend like crazy. Long term is different story
Apparently all of WSB ALMOST bought TSLA calls today.
They sold 20,000 bottles of tequila through Tesla‚Äôs website like 2 weeks ago.
Mother of fucking god
480 min 600 max imo it‚Äôs going to moon again premarket and retail will flock hard I‚Äôll be ready to deposit whatever call I can get for under 100$
Wait for MACD value > MACD avg, buy shares, trailing-stop -10%.
This was not great strategy last time I played poker online.
One of my cousins kept pestering me to use his link to open a Webull acct. I put in 100$ and kept buying random options. Was up to 1000 in there and copped this Tesla call today. Tmrw tendie town.
Good. More people will rotate into Tesla.

That Nio dip on Friday shook me ladies. I am a tile setter and trade on my phone while Im at work.. I was in that bitch at 32. Looked at my phone and it was at 54 and I went back to work like ohh yea bitch. Went to lunch and it was at 40 and i shit my dick off. I waited till PM to sell it at 45, and now I cant pull the trigger on anything. Wanted to buy ba this morning and told myself to wait till open. At open i waited for the dip. Missed nio all day. Missed LAC...Im a scared mother fucker. I need to go to church.

The Chinese gov watching their main EV hitters so any news that move the US market is going to help because is a mutual relation that benefit both sides, the Rcep trade pact is in effect which shows resilient and the collaborate progressions that China itself wanted to enforce with it's trade partners, their plan to make all eco friendly car by 2035 will make their EV company the forefront of that pursuit, in other word they're not going to allow it to fail, NIO is technically riding that CCP dream wave.

With TSLA at 460 currently, the intrinsic value alone is worth $4000 per contract lot at expiry. Taking into account implied volatility and extrinsic value those contracts are each worth a-fucking-lot.

AHHHHHHHHHHH
When is doordash going public exactly?
RIP
hoping on, anyone know the short float atm?
At least 20
Well yes, as the buyer you are the one with the option to exercise or not.  "As long as I want" up until expiration of course, they're all time-limited.

You never know who the other person is on the selling end of a contract you bought.  They may "buy to close" but your end of the contract isn't affected and you'd never know, the other end just transfers to someone else.  Contracts you buy or sell probably change hands on the other end of the contract tons of times, you can't see it and it doesn't effect you at all so it doesn't matter.

Last little nugget of wisdom, if you buy an option, time is your enemy and the longer you hold it (if the underlying isn't doing what you predicted) you're losing money.  Theta decay.  This loss accelerates the closer to expiration you get.  People in this sub who are buying weekly FDs or 0DTE options are truly gambling, either the stock goes ITM quickly or they lose the money spent buying the option.  If it doesn't go where you predict quick enough and you want to sell to close to avoid total loss, you won't get back what you bought in with.

Back to what you asked, you can hold as long as you like just keep in mind the value of what you're holding is decaying daily unless its already ITM and you're holding hoping for even more profit.
NIO and TSLA joined at the hip
Any thoughts on zoom?
When did you buy these? I bought some 42.5 11/20‚Äôs at open and im Up 30%. Did you wait until high of day or did you buy on friday?
nio
Good day today. Day traded some $PLUG 28c 11/20 for a 20% gain. Now my bagholded $TSLA 600c 02/21 should get some tendie love based on the S&P500 inclusion. 


Feels good to win a bit especially when you feel like you havn't had a life win in a while. I hope you are hanging in there and doing well in these trying times. Stay strong and safe and keep up the good fight WSB reader.

I‚Äôm no oracle, but I predict it will be sideways in the 470 range. Then expect a dip next week.

Anyone shorting Tesla? Or are y‚Äôall hopping on the Tesla train?
Jesus your timing is fucking impeccable, I already have shares so didn't yolo on calls but congrats to you!
Why didn't you just buy calls
How does one do this, explain to me.
Sold 500c‚Äôs last week. Fuck me.
Biontech, the partner of Pfizer and the actual developer of the vaccine, will submit the data for approval to the FDA in the 3rd week of November which is this week. So expect news within 4 days and buy calls on either one.

 Yep! All aboard Pltr! 525 shares holding till 03/21 atleast.
What‚Äôs happening
I always believed in you TSLA! Even when I didn't I did because I knew I was wrong! I want to thank the Academy and my wife's boyfriend... we did it bro!!!
How much would 8 11/20 420 tsla calls be worth rn? I sold at 2:00 for 365 a contract
Is this a confirmation to hold nio through ER ?
I know some of you bought tsla 500c FDs.
Show your gainz
I doubled down. It‚Äôs printing brrrr
I‚Äôm down a ton and realistically will have about 750 in my account to play with tomorrow, how far OTM would I have to be to get a Tesla weekly

Yeah. Stop loss triggered today on my $450 calls for 11/20. I‚Äôm gonna go throw up.
Wtf
Buy both
Thats the idea, yet people are still shorting it lmao
Why no talk about FCEL? Or is that shit for r/pennystocks?

And the reason being?

You do know you can only be added to the S&P 500 once, right?
How so?
Rekt
about strike price x 10 per contract.  YMMV.
IV might have gotten you a little bit.. or more likely theta. While it‚Äôs ITM NIO was either red or flat for most of the day. It had its trends up but it was expected to have more of a shift up than it actually did, so you actually lost some value on your contract.
Lost it all on puts I deserved it I think I‚Äôm done with options
Which deity though?
Bruh moment
Have an upvote to help you heal
If the whole dow is tanking what specifically is a good option to short.
Nah it will be 694.20
Anyone in NIO is not crying lol. Retard.
Yes
i have half of my money in GME and i want to throw the other half in real bad
of course it's the beginning. fkn stock split made it run 40%... this is the big boy boomer money getting into TSLA... shorts will be covering like a mofo. then the actual buying comes.
Hahah oh shit my bad man. I‚Äôm over here being a dick. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a short list of companies they will consider giving the boot too. Not too sure which one though?
Any option strike price other than zero is leveraged compared to the underlying stock.   It is a common misperception that buying ATM is not leveraged.
can someone help me understand why this will make tsla go up that high?

If we use CRM as an example, it did pop due to earning and joining sp500, but today's price is actually lower than the date it joined sp500

What's up with this gme news? Have we not known about him investing in GME and saying the last month he wants it to rival Amazon? In that article, his talk with the board yielded little if any progress at all.
YEAH ITS AFTER HOURS THOSE ARE THE PRICES BEFORE THE MARKET CLOSED AT 4PM
THE S&P IS GONNA TAKE THEM ALL that guy maybe idk
Fuckin shit. That explains all the red I saw in my numbers today.
You're welcome.
:(
I‚Äôm about to buy some juicy ass credit spread tomorrow with my nio gains
Y tho?
I really think you are just fine. Have to look at this as a buying opportunity as the company is really crushing it. Only reason I exited was I was short term and hit a profit target. I also own shares which I held and leaps which I held and will look to add more when this news shakes out.
Yeah until he sells his positions and you‚Äôre left holding the bag
They WERE cheap
Calls on $XPHK?
Homie, we‚Äôre all talking about TSLA right, go take this to /r/investing or something.  We‚Äôre only interested in good news and stonks going up.
Fear not the whole EV Market should be on fire üî•

This is the way

I don‚Äôt think you understand what sub you‚Äôre in...
I‚Äôm almost equal weight in both with cost basis of ~400 and ~40. What does that make me?
Last week Cramer said don‚Äôt buy NIO, buy TSLA. Maybe Cramer is right most of the time...
I‚Äôll probably buy some common stock, along with long calls tomorrow. If Spy hits 365 tomorrow that is.
Just google tesla stock and you will see after hr
So like $750 give of take end of week lol.
Shit, shit, shit!

I finally gave up rolling my fuckwit TSLA calls and this happens!

Just looking at Jeff Bezos, He made some $14 billion in money right, but he did it tax-free by buying and funding research in the economy to therefore keep money circulating right.

There‚Äôs workarounds and things you can do with taxes to almost completely avoid them. 

 I‚Äôm also not poor I am broke because I don‚Äôt have a job because I live with my parents and I‚Äôm still in high school

Is there a way to make the TSLA bulls and the NIO bulls fight each other?
Exactly. The American working class isn‚Äôt a bunch of retards in their mom‚Äôs basement day trading for a living. Each paycheck gets eaten up and work hours are long to long for any time to be put towards looking up which stonks go up and what ones go down. This goes for the majority of the lower 40% of the population. Some can‚Äôt even make ends meet and most I‚Äôm sure would rather do something else with their free time then researching stonks and loosing what little savings they have.
date? no reason
So, yes, it's insider info?
Iron is why Mars is red.
Key word: when
Moon, dump or moon then dump, or dump then moon or sideways.

Wow i was going to buy tsla but bought pltr today
I'm getting conflicting information, from 495 to 505 components. Investing.com has it at 495.
Please enlighten me. Dint they just got themselves into S&P 500? Really curious
Just hop in again in a few days.
Wait until market open
I am wondering if they already knew and have been accumulating while TSLA was just floating...
Yep, whenever it's a White person being mocked, even with an obvious ethnic name, race has nothing to do with it.

&#x200B;

However, if it's a Jew or a Black or whatever being mocked, race is obviously a factor.

Never hold a stock after it offers new shares. Look at Nokia great balance sheet, great revenues, great future prospects. The stock will never be above 5 dollars though.
Think he gained on tsla. Idk very mysterious post.
Nice you to know you are also in NIO, NIO , NIO and some more NIO. Great!
Ahhh euro. Holy shit you actually could make it out and those shits will be up on IV alone at bell you should just sell at open.

Don‚Äôt mention futures until after 8pm EST.

If you roll it out, then it's not a huge biggie, right? I mean you lose 1-2 weeks of covered calls income but that's shouldn't overshadow that your underlying shares jumped 10 percent.
Bro? You can still buy 100 shares are you dumb lol. Great move tho bro but seriously think of years of y/y gains this is nothing in comparison. I can only afford 1 share rn bro so stay blessed and buy those shares!

The strategy no ones thinking about
TSLA made 7 attempt to break out of 460 level since mid September which also stand as a major resistance, if it manage to run off tomorrow than there really no resistance until 538
 

Papa Musk told me to invest in all good EV because TSLA is not there to crush the competition but the promote EV adoption sooner than later.
Fuk
Huh?
OnlyStonks, make it your own platform...
Congrats,  but I think most of the profiting will take place before its addition and funds will use it as a way to exit.

lol this is not the time to be buying stocks based on your favorite companies,it‚Äôs a simple matter of the return to mean. Little do you guys know just how risky it is to be playing with the valuations of those EVs. With these retail stocks the infrastructure that used to sustain their revenue is still in place, they just have to showcase they‚Äôre going to make it past the pandemic and their valuations will rise again. The red headed step child‚Äôs are the stocks that bring you the most money

Its not a big amount of money..im a student anyway. But yeah. Atleast i have 1 Tsla share to take a bit of gains
Nah. To many fanboys and retard strength for that. Maybe dump end of week or next. Tuesday Wednesday green for sure
It wouldn‚Äôt be them it‚Äôd be Apache if it did
Will be around 1500x including increased IV at these levels
I'm gonna be sick everytime I look at tsla. I literally about to buy 100 shares today, but I was busy at work. Fuck!!!!!!!
NIO FDs gang checking in
The real question is do we hold through earnings? No doubt it‚Äôll be boss hog green dick tomorrow but the latest Barron‚Äôs article suggests it‚Äôll drop...
Why? It's already priced in.
11/20 43.5c
ah well still everything i said holds true. these will not lose you money bro. just leave them here. if tesla gets fucky move the money to apple. that being said if your patient these shares will make you A LOT of money. I wish i could afford to sit on 100 tesla shares. im a premium selling flavor of the month day trading bastard. the only times i've had 40k in cash i've pulled out 30k and proceeded to lose the rest and spend another month making 30k again. rinse repeat. you're safe brother hold and don't worry

This is very bullish. Ryan Cohen is about to make some big moves.

It is possible he was responsible for some of the large block buys today.

We will see this week if we get an updated filing.
a tesla 465c was worth .4 at close ARE YOU SHITTING ME
imagine trading like this and having better portfolio than your average wsb retard
True, and so wait i will, personally i just dont like buying after the boat has sailed. No one knows when the boat sails, so i‚Äôll just keep jumping into boats that havent sailed yet. Plus many boats go to the bottom of the ocean after it sails
Would you suck a dick for $100? If yes then you‚Äôd make a good couple so yes
One of us. ü§ù
But the fomo is calling my name

All in on tesla tomorrow boys
I hate that I ever got out of TSLA. Fuuu.
downvoted for posting a gain before you made jack shit. also this is a small PP position.
Holyyyt shit if Cohen can pull this off I‚Äôd make so much fucking money on GME

Yeah, it was kind of a yolo, I'm not proud. Being that autistic I lost big money on this trade. I usually sell options, this was the first one I attempt buying like an idiot.
We have truly lost sight of what‚Äôs important...

The truly believers of Tesla must rise again and reclaim their dominance in the stock movement 

We mustn‚Äôt forget who got us here.... the great Elon musk
I own five shares and almost sold today. But didn't. 2020 doesn't totally suck yet.

Half you people won't know what this is but...Moneygram. Shares and LEAPS will print over the next 1-2 years. Just look at the innovation and growth this company has had the last year. $500 million market cap? Are you kidding me? Its closest competitor Western Union is worth $8b, so the upside is tremendous. I'm telling you this thing is a grandslam. Read the latest earnings and transaction growth and see for yourself.

All of the self-feeding loop stuff I saw about TSLA‚Äôs inclusion in the S&P says it will take time. It‚Äôll jump 10-15% this week and be on a hard rise for the next two months. Maybe $600 by the new year but not tomorrow.

Ah that makes sense. Like a retard I bought 1/20 68c XLE in april for pretty cheap, i think those are still gonna expire worthless unless the stock can go up $30 in 2 months lol
Also known as 1234. You reach a high(a), come to a bottom(b), then make a new high slightly under the old one(c), and then a new bottom slightly above the last one(d). Strong set up for break out potential next time you break the original high(a). This is why people say triple top is death. If you fail the abcd with a triple top you‚Äôre likely to see the drop under the original bottom(b).

In all seriousness, once TSLA is officially included in S&P (Dec. 21st) that would be a great time to get SPY puts. This volatile shit will drop below $200 in a years time and bring SPY down with it

I can't believe  that I had limit orders for TSLA the whole day, didn't get filled because of a 2$ difference and now it gets added to the S&P. Also 4 days ago I sold my TSM leaps because I was down 400 on them even though the underlying price was higher than when I bought it and the past 2 trading days it surged. This bad luck timing.

well 20 shares is not enough to sell covered options. so you should hold your shares and buy naked calls or sell puts. take profit on the puts as soon as you're comfortable the pump this is getting could spill a little... i don't really think it will because its tesla but still
i bought 5 shares at 398 and haven‚Äôt sold yet

Have you previously traded TSLA?
The fed isn't giving money away, they're loaning it as collateral against illiquid assets. This doesn't drive prices up, only the change in leverage ratios does that.  That's why the fed is acting so helpless, they're at the mercy of the banks and the banks often don't do what they want.

Your point about the 2023 pension hit is interesting though, that could be a catalyst if nothing systemic happens before then.
Only.
Vax news is going to pull down cv stocks. Tsla is at max price 470 and same goes for ev stocks. At some point earnings will cause all these cv miracle stocks to crash or just bleed red.

This aged well
When it hits 507.60 I‚Äôd probably sell it .. but that‚Äôs me and I always sell things right before they make me realllll money lol
My FOMO levels are at an ALL TIME HIGH
Damn so TSLA just straight up saps 51bn from other stocks in the SP500. That‚Äôs crazy.
Didn‚Äôt see anyone smashing big call volume :(
‚Äú I recommended Bear stearns 12 years ago so good for me you can‚Äôt @me cause you $roped 12 years ago‚Äù
Lol a FD is **NOT** a $500 TSLA call the morning after it runs up $50+ üòÇ
Yes
Xbox vs PS5. Which one should I get?
NIO
Yep my bad. Had a spread in mind not covered by shares. My bad, still made money
Never. We've all seen how retarded tsla can go
i bought 5 shares at once and haven‚Äôt sold any i‚Äôm so confused
Best i can do are Dec 520/March 540 call warrants in my country. Will look at it on market open, put a small position, and thoroughly check. Nice prediction!
She's her own brand now
Unusually high short term option trading on tesla calls today, I wonder who knew the news before the word got out?

I‚Äôm too poor, can someone give this man some Reddit awards.
My mom actually told me about it. I told her I would buy 1000 shares and a 25 $6c I got for .01. Both are up big to my surprise.
It will never recover, company fukt
Bro I totally had the faint thought to maybe consider buying tesla weeklies today but did not... still feel like a smart mf üò§üëè
There was a ~30% sell-off when TSLA was not added to the S&P 500 in September. ($500 to $350)
Hell yeah nice work!!
Lol. The concept of risk-adjusted returns is well beyond the almost-graduated middle school knowledge standard here.
Post your lesson or forever feel ashamed instead of providing life lessons to the regime known as WSB. Bankruptcy is temporary.
Walmart gonna be really interesting
You are the definition of a mental midget. Do you think you‚Äôre the only one who owned it before the split? why do you think it slipped from ath after SP500 held their policy meeting bs for sept and didn‚Äôt announce TSLA inclusion
Buy at top, sell on bottom. This is the way
Guys Tesla EOW $500c ? Tomorrow morning I‚Äôm buying idc if i lose I‚Äôm doing it cause I‚Äôm a true believer of Tesla
Bought 80 shares because I'm a pussy but 2 $560 11 dec calls earlier.
Initial was 300k back in 2004. Slowly built it up, then started selling naked calls and puts/iron condors, strangles. made it to 3.5 MM in 2012 then dropped to 200k into brexit. MAde a mill going YOLO on the brexit gap down and rode that up to 18MM. 

&#x200B;

Looking back, options are bad. Weekly options are crack. Yet, here i am, back again, none the wiser. Well, maybe a little wiser. I see so many posts here that remind me of me when i was starting out. 500K  and i'm set. no, make that 1 MM. Ok, maybe 5 MM and i'm done. When I crashed and burned, I was dreaming of 50 MM. It never ends.
it‚Äôs still otm

I've been wheeling on tesla for the last ~2 months, so technically my cost basis is at ~$300 or so, but yea this feels bad.

Tesla is headed to the ISS as we speak
Are you retarded or is there actual benefits to paying $200 a month for Verizon?
It's had just about a 17% pullback so I would say yes. Fucking bullshit though.

I bought 4 today at $85. 


But I've been playing TSLA for past few weeks everytime it nears 400. It has been bouncing between 400-450 for weeks now. I typically buy around 400-405 and sell when they are up 30-50%. These 4 will likely be up 1200-1700% at open tomorrow. Kinda crazy.
Overpriced TSLA FD‚Äôs at open?

Oh nono just right now there‚Äôs like nothing to buy with avg p/e ratios this insanely high

See I told you I was retarded
what the fuck is wrong w BABA
Shares are peanuts unless you own $100K worth. Your under $1000 gain doesn't even get my dick hard
Agree. Anytime is a good time to buy in. These same posts were everywhere when NIO was $12. ‚ÄúI missed NIO!‚Äù

dammit....I didn't know LAC had earnings today
Congrats on the future gains boss
TSLA 11/20 465c was 0.40 at close...lol
Yeah, not quite the same - but in terms of effective free float contraction by +40% it's quite similar.

I.e. around 300 million shares of TSLA are going to be moved from weak long institutional & retail investors into diamond hands.
Sold my holdings last week for a micro-profit.  I'm just glad to be out of it.
Tesla to the moon?
Thanks! It‚Äôs $435c for 2/19
What‚Äôs the IPO price ? I fucking love Airbnb
This market is the same group of goofballs buying the same shit back and forth from each other at higher and higher prices and congratulating themselves on increase in value.  Wcgw.

I sold a QQQ put today around lunchtime EST....prolly junst let that cook a little more....

Solid DD here, can‚Äôt go wrong with all the stonk emojis
So you waited to yolo near the top?
Dude you make it sound like TSLA will make up 20% of S&p500
And counting !
...yes, it does. By definition. It may get obscured because of other market movement, you know supply and demand, but bro the stock price is lower than whatever it wouldve been by the exact amount of the div. This is super basic stuff dude, please be careful out there.
fuck you alibaba piece of shit only goes down
You dirty dog, you... well done.
right sorry, it's 20% above my cost basis I meant.
Not if this place gets it first:

It's clearly a "privilege" "satire" from someone who wished they could punch "privileged" people in the face, unironically.  I'd put money on them having a problem with whiteness too, although I agree it isn't the point of this tweet.

Ironically the type of people who run these accounts usually have wealthier than average family and think of themselves as victims or activists. Take away the black bloc masks and there are a lot of trust fund kids playing anarchist to rebel against their wealthy or upper middle class parents.

That sounds bullish to me
I'm selling my NIO share to buy a Playstation 2.
Same but at $420 strike. Thinking about rolling up and out if possible. I really have no idea what the best option is.
I won‚Äôt accept less than 2% Nasdaq pump tomorrow.

It‚Äôs delayed and nobody here buys calls almost $100 itm lol

In the words of our wsb forefathers:

No , he is down on TSLA at $408 which means he lost money in TSLA before so his cost basis is higher than $408 even though he bought it at 398.

It was a joke about how I need Elon dead or my outs are fucked. If you‚Äôd actually invest in a company over that you‚Äôre not just trashy you‚Äôre hella stupid. Good luck. Your comment convinced me to hold through on the off chance we repeat September.
Bitter sweet. Awesome for so many reasons but there will be much less volatility to make degenerate bets on

that's the market cap of all stocks in the index simply added - counting Apple, amazon msft at their trillion+ values. that is not how much indexes such as SPY and VOO are worth who will have to rebalance to add tesla.

I bought Tesla shares just thinking it‚Äôd go back to $420 but holy fuckin shit did that pay off
idk i already lost a lot these past week bettin on tech 

whats more nervous is that you want us to bet through ER, no telling how the market is going to react, sure it'll beat earnings but what about guidance? 

also 1st week of december is also nervous cause november is lockdown month, bad gdp, bad unemployment figures.

also we have no indications that zm will split

oh and your previous post history was a shitpost, not a DD, not a yolo, a shitpost

call me a little betch pussy cause i prob am but u gotta reel us in with sum juicy shet than some lucky bet you made a month ago.

I love this username.
No one circles the wagons like Papa Musk.
Imagine you sold naked calls on TSLA. At least one person out there must have. RIP that guy
typical WSB YOLO entire account in weekly options. Except, i specialized in deep itm calls. Didn't play the lotto crap. Example, 800 deep itm FB calls for 5-10 bucks with 1 dollar premium. i'd typically have 500k to 1 MM in weekly options. Got to the point where i was swinging 1 MM a week up and down and knew it would end badly, and it did. Luckily I had enough brains to take some out.
diamond fucking hands, grats
Lol, tbh I didn't think they would announce it this soon. They are adding billions of dollars of cash every quarter and they are getting pressured from investors to do something with it because interest rate is so low and they're not making anything on CDs or money market. Also their debt is so cheap because they have one of the highest ratings and can guarantee long term loans at the lowest possible rates so they wouldn't use excess cash to pay that off. It seemed like the right time and it's definitely going to be well received given that other companies are decreasing dividends, etc.
They decided to issue more shares from out of thin air. They didn't do a split, they just pulled more out their ass and put them on the market, so everyone who had shares in it just lost out by the decision as their position has been diluted, hence the dive
Congrats brother.
Bruh, how did we not see this. The Tesla Tequila is a 750mL bottle at $250. 750-250=500
Probly spy strangle at open
That curve is gonna be moved up to Dec/Jan, tweets make hearts pound
Given the new TSLA hype, would the next best play be long calls on SPY? My nut is already all in on PLtR, I just have massive fucking fomo
Limit order for $465
All these idiots here talking about the fake ass vaccine pump, COVID cancelled , and FOMOing because of TSLA? 

Yes. Puts. Obviously.
I didn‚Äôt even see your post, but had a feeling in my loins as well, grabbed 2 420Cs expiring Friday right at close.
It split guy. It‚Äôd be $2,300 without the split.

Ban.
covid elon calls
lol enjoy the premium!! that sucks tho
Lol. No expiry in your SS, retard. If it‚Äôs an FD sell it at open to take in the Vega, then roll out to a higher strike once it settles some  if you think it‚Äôs going up more.
Existing shareholders, not past shareholders
No. It‚Äôs MAYBE going to touch record highs, it won‚Äôt do $98 above that.

Last stupid question. Any options I buy can be held as long as I want to without the seller closing on me?
Time for serious end of year TSLA price predictions:  I'm going with $525.  Take a shot and win stupid prizes.
Take your award this gave me goosebumps and a boner
So uh, looks like ill be bagholding PLUG tomorrow? Whats the move? Diamond hand or cut losses
What's the cut off age ??? I'm about to be 28
Got in on CBAT at 2.33. Thank you random redditor for the tip pre-battery day.
TSLA needs another company to leave the S&P 500 before it can join. Can we start a vote for what stock should be dropped? 

I vote that SIG Signet Jewelers be dropped from the S & P 500 because I hate the "he went to Jareds" ads.
Hold these Tesla shares or sell Rn ?
Obviously yes
Should I sell my TSLA stocks tomorrow or hold? I'm new to this and I'm a lucky idiot with no clue what I'm doing.

They're going to announce efficacy  of 97% on Monday to continue the pump. Calling it now
CCL put Gang checking in. How deep we going boys?
IV has dropped quite a bit. I feel like the front month option tree had an IV of something like 66% last week, and now it is 45% or so. No charts in front of me so don't quote me on those numbers, but yeah... IV crush confirmed.
I know an idiot who sold his Tesla for NIO on Friday. Wow. Must be feeling extra dumb
They are making fun of stereotypical white trust fund babies; his analogy is making fun of jew businessmen. Similar to making fun of a black welfare queen

They are all stereotypes but only 2 are a problem
Can my portfolio join s&p? Need a good pump right about now
Why were* they so cheap?
Shareholders did. Thats why we held strong thru this 420 flatline bullshit
FCEL up 10% AH LFG
Yup, gonna be another short squeez
No
Yes. Biggly.
Is there someway I can gamble with money I don‚Äôt have to buy it?
Thx dawg!
It‚Äôs good for EV companies in general.
what happened to this sub ffs
That might happen if the AH pop is for no reason. But in case of great earnings etc the stock generally stays way up.
Lol only had 3 shares of TSLA. Sold them now AH.

*Amid, amidst a crashing world*
EOD 500ish that‚Äôs what it was when it was supposed to be added to the sp500 months ago
I'm subscribed to Everyday Astronaut for that kind of intel
420 is the one true price
Wow this is not even an exaggeration this time that futures are fucking mooning
Fuck off bro it dipped to 15 this morning, it's all upwards from here
TSLA GANG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ok, ill use your own example so you can't complain and come back again

you say all thats needed is 5$ each paycheck x 52 work weeks lets assume = 260$ a year. 

they do that from 18 to 25, now that the pandemic hit we can assume this person has years of doing this helping you're case buddy. thats 7 entire years of saving which feels like an eternity = $1,820

by the way, heres a qoute not my opinion "The average American's monthly expenses: $5,102" we can assume this person is poverty so its half of that, bend the truth in your favor my friend 5,102 divide by 2 = 2,551$ expenses monthly

here we see that persons 7 years of savings, was not enough to cover even 1 months expenses, with growth......probably so, probably grew far enough to cover the month, but thats one month, and now their savings are zero. when out of work for an entire year the other 11 months will put them in 28,061$ in debt. a high average salary for many. they will never get out of that hole.

you see, i used you're example, made it even more in you're favor and still.....all it proves is more stimulus is needed.

you obviously live with the parents still which is fine, in fact great keep saving if you can, but don't think you understand reality. 5$ a week saved is not enough to live off of for a year+ with no income just from investments returns. life is more expensive.

i don't want to hear anymore of you're ridgid far right policy that you're father tells you when he gets home as you have no idea how expensive life really is, you're blocked i can no longer hear from you again don't waste you're time trying to reply to me again you know nothing
Currently $464 and climbing.
Yeah but that's just based on the news, wait till half of wsb autists sell and fomo into Tesla
The only week I didn't have TSLA calls, it jumped like this. Fuck my life
Vote to remove
i got 10 17p 11/20
[deleted]
I believe it‚Äôs cd
Well its at its resistance that's before 500, so we're already at that moment of truth it seems. Given how much FOMO there will be at open tomorrow, I'm guessing it will hit 500.
sell at open, buy a cheaper weekly in the afternoon. That way you secure most of the profit but if tsla continues to rocket you still make some gains.

Scroll back down to where it closed around 410 area. Those were the prices it was trading at.

I bought 50 more AH. Leggo
How are they trading options during after hours?
The real question is when to short TSLA
haha this is guy that always makes a comment about AOC bartending under her tweets and people get pissed everytime
[deleted]
Probably between 70-100 each. 


11/20 450C at $85 checking in. Unfortunately I only bought 4.


I bought them because I've noticed TSLA bouncing between 400-450 for weeks now. When it nears the bottom I throw in around $300 and sell when TSLA is at like 425-430. Pretty much always prints 30-50%.  As it stands now, the 450s will probably be up 1500-1700% tomorrow at open.

the portfolio invests a % in each company to reflect their market cap in the s&p500

they don't get rid of number 500 and just use that money for TSLA

they need to clear enough room to have tsla their TENTH biggest holding
I haven‚Äôt lost on Calls üòá I buy under 100
Just did in the form of üçâ calls
Tesla poppin is good but it‚Äôs up 3% in the past month while everything else mooned. I honestly think it sees 500 tomorrow
Nice so not getting included took my money and while I'm still down they give me an extra kick when i can't join this time!!! ‚û∞
Lol I wouldn‚Äôt count on it but maybe ur right
LI too
Wouldn't the run up to where it has been consolidating for the last couple of months be indicative of S&P giving their premium clients a sneak peek into what to expect.  I know Citi and Ftse did that with their fixed income indicies
How about LI
talking about dividend ex-date, not option expiration date Mr. Swayze.
I think that‚Äôs wishful as well. But could be wrong
My grandma, actually. Happy b day bro
Lol
Still a very solid win imo.
This is calculated, I smell something
I bought sold 20 at 409this morning then I was like fuck it imma buy the 20 shares back at 408... 10 hours later üò¥ imma sleep well how far will this run to?

[deleted]
FML, I could see myself doing that. But you know it's an incredibly volatile stock so I think I'll sell everything and wait until it's 1/3 off its current price and rebuy instead of being lazy and holding it the way I have been.
Do you know what selling a covered call means? Are you aware they have a + delta?
yeah advice? turn them paper towlers into diamonds and you're gonna make a shitload of money. im gonna buy tesla weekly calls at open and i bet you my dumb middle class ass will end up payed. this is a huge deal. let them ride. sell covered calls tomorrow.
I remember about a year ago everyone was making fun of the TSLA investor club subreddit. Really seemed like TSLA might not even survive at the time.

i can't believe i saw the heart tweet last night and didn't set a reminder on my phone to play the calls i wanted to... fuck this was the most obvious big winner i've ever missed out on lol

all my longs are up like 30-40%. dunno if ill get weeklies.
Thank GOD I held my calls today
Agree!!
TSLA is going up. Huge upside. They have the potential to be generating $2T revenue by 2022, and I forecast north of $6T revenue by 2023, with a solid $3T profit. I see this stock as more fairly valued at something like twice what it's at now.
If tesla made you rich and you dont buy a model S, yous a fucking bitch. And made sure you buy it for sticker price $69,420. Happy for the TSLA gang.
You need a tiktok tutorial on trading
We‚Äôre all on the outside
its probably gonna hit 500$ by the end of the hour
He may try to buyout the company too to gain control. Wouldn't surprise me, he seems to be an "all or nothing" level investor
The question is regardless of what the report says, will you believe it? Are you the kind of person looking for confirmation bias and anything shy of that will be unacceptable?

Facts
tesla has broken 500 before, no reason they dont continue this run to 500
Just play it safe and practice with a demo account till you actually know what you're doing

Is that bullish or bearish?
How did no one know TSLA would be sp 500 listed?
I do remember hearing from an NPR report that the Republican national committee has agreed that any monies Trump raises during this contention of the election 50% of all proceeds can be used to pay back campaign debts... So I definitely agree with you... I gave you an updoot I don't know who down dooted did you.
No, still 8.5%+ of ARKK, ARKW, and ARKQ

If Pablito were alive he would say something like ‚Äúno es pa‚Äôlante, es palantir pap√°... vamos a poner a esos osos maricas a chupar gladiolo ome gonorrea ome‚Äù then he would put 1billion + on PLTR calls before 100 bombs to increase demand on the same stock he just bought.
they need to clear 1.4% of the portfolio to balance TSLA in relevant to its market cap.

obviously company 500 is gonna be liquidated but that makes up 0.01%, I assume some also already has figured out how it maintains the balance

They do it to keep its ratio under 11% in their portfolio per taxation guideline. TSLA is still their #1 holding around 10.5% today but they will need to sell A LOT tomorrow because of this lol

üåàüêªnever learnü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I agree. Reminds me of something I heard before that more people, especially on here, need to realize: That there is a major difference between fault and responsibility. For example I can not be at fault if I was hit by a car and seriously injured, or laid off at my job, but it's still my responsibility to deal with that situation and make the best of it. You can spend your time blaming the world all you want but at the end of the day it's your responsibility for what you do going forward after that action occurred.
God a bj at a Walmart once, so I have a strong bias. 200c 11/20

Dude, what‚Äôs your trading style? Position?
It'll be priced in by open, plz don't fomo you retards

Sell
I ‚ô•Ô∏è you.
‚ÄúMy kid‚Äù
Yeah
Im always bearish but musk does his thing and I stay away from tsla puts because of that. More power to him. 

Though I'm pretty sure he was just starting to feel irrelevant because of China and forgotten about in wsb. üê≥
Inverse the inverse..  calls it is
But the price was this cheap today right?
That makes sense. Because I have. Robinhood.
Bro this is exciting, but just give us retards a strike price lmao
Sadly, I bought them at like 3:58 while driving home from work
Does this mean we should go all out on TESLA calls from now until then?
Unless the NSA or CIA become public companies I think PLTR has no direct competitors
Yeaaaahhh. Buy some feb 70c to cover nio day in Jan. Hold through earnings to the hype for that with like 50% and just avg down if we get anymore ~20% sell offs between now and then.

Hello Elon! \*waves\*
Maybe even sideways. Not an expert tho
I got low $400 calls. Do i just sell at open or hold for 10 mins
Trump should just go all out these last months. Fuck it, do it all. He‚Äôs still king of America for a few more months. 

Start by signing an executive order demanding they replay The Masters with him in it.
Why not include that picture in the post then? Lmao
I mean... no. There was a very clear and obvious reason.
Remortgaging my house, selling all my belongings and going all in on 11/27 $600 TSLA Calls LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I wish I wasn‚Äôt also and actually bought some like I considered at 12pm today....
Double winning
Side note, my big account. I did go all shares.
I mean it will flip to green by open. Nothing less than 1.5 red is safe.
I bought VIX puts and calls and legged out of VIX calls post - election when it seemed that Trump wouldn't nuke the West Coast (although that's still a possibility).

Then to further hedge I sold UVXY calls as it was such an insanely poor product.  I only thing I've seen worse is UWTI.

Thanks for buying the calls I sold random autists
This is true. Also TSLA will do a capital raise to get included since their weight is so large. Tsla will be happy because they get more $ to expand. Stupid bulls who buy Fds will get fked when it is announced
spy will have to clear 1.3% of its holdings to make room for TSLA

thats several billion dollars sold to make room, fire sale

SPY(X) puts at open?
But the price was this cheap today right? Fuck... I should have got it
Bears gettin desperate
Yes
Congrats
My DEAC shares would disagree with you
You‚Äôre wrong. Higher.
Goodbye 4k
Those calls should be up a couple thousand percent
Buy calls at 930 sell at 940
or at all
Literally had Tesla 500c for Jan in my car fuck my ass
I have a decent amount of shares on Tesla should I sell at open or hold ??
we've. already. seen. this. karma whore.
This news is awesome
I feel blessed already.
hold
Nice try bro not even that could save baba now
prolly up or down
what if this become the next Watch Dogs?
Well said!
Too bad the party really is over now
What scares me is this would have worked. Not just worked really, you would have profited immensely.
Last time he did this it tanked...    puts on donny boi
I would hold it for the next week. It will run up for the next few days imo. You can lock in the gain tomorrow but this position is as good as any right now. Maybe if it runs up a lot, sell it and buy higher strike.
dont start with me smarterchild
Why is their rumors?
F
tesla breaks 500 over night
Naaaa bro.
imagine being short Tesla at the close today?
Close, but there‚Äôs a very good reason for what‚Äôs happening right now.
If they raise again it wont be under their last raise at 500
why? they were high?
[deleted]
I‚Äôm buying FDs so don‚Äôt you fucking dare
Yup. Equities will go up, people will think value of stocks also going up - but in reality value of USD going down.
Ok so why weren't we all making ICE plays in china 10 years ago? There were still loads of them.

In a few years isn't it just going to be a thousand people on low pay building cheap EVs buying low margin EVs from one of the other 10 random Chinese companies no one has heard of. Then like 10 managers buying a high margin imported Tesla or BMW.

Like how it is with ICE now.
How many of you cut your losses on TSLA calls this week or last week as it ground to a halt?
sell at open if up massively like 25% lol
Won‚Äôt be able to buy a call worth anything with $500. IV is going to be sky high. I‚Äôd try and work with spreads
Grats
Fuck...I have a 11/20 430c covered call opened...should I roll it out tmrw
Thank you
Beeaaachhh it‚Äôs going to 550 atleast
Why will it go back down ? Market crash ?
I bought 2 $560 11 dec calls earlier... The one time I was tempted to yeet everything at it on rumors... I didn't.
What's gone?
Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre accurate, especially if a major event took place after hours.
You heard me
shares? hold that shit dude... you're in it for the long haul
Why did it go up 5 drop 5 now down 2.5? I know some Cohen knews came out but anything positive or nah

So do we expect an upward TSLA trend tomorrow for calls or is it too late for this specific train?
Depends, are you day trading or holding for long term?
I‚Äôm actually in on 500 x10 for 11/27 and 600 x10 for 12/4. This makes me feel a little better lol.
No stonks only go up
Tendie gods whispered in my ear and I bought 4 x 440C 11/20 before market close.
How so dipshit?
Update if you didn‚Äôt see my post: since most of you are telling me to hold my position i have now sold it and with the profit i will be purchasing NIO faggy d‚Äôs. thank you for the help fellow autists, and i‚Äôll keep you guys updated on if i can go to vegas this weekend after NIO hits 100 or get a margain call.
Lmao you fucking guys are hilarious

Feel you. Just looks too good to be true for a crazy beat but hey xpeng and li both mooned after earnings so hopefully so does nio. We shall wait and see
Its the wisdom of the clowns, bro
I'm waiting for that snake jazz retweet
Post Gains or Ban
Indeed
What's the ticker for cigarette style warnings I'm trying to buy calls like it says
yes, permaholders will start to buy now
Hopefully everyone considering NIO is a marketing company
yeah but he misses out on a lot of gains and now he cant buy back the shares at a good price
This.  This actually HINDERS the SP500 short term.
Its up and check the after hours trading. You dun goofed.
Valid point, I'm gonna have to look at historical data to confirm. It definitely drops but not the whole amount of the dividend. I bought my options on red days for the past 2 months. I've been playing COSTCO options since June. You can check my previous gain posts.
Hey I‚Äôm kinda retarded do you think tesla can hit 500 tmrw?
TSLA is gonna fuck SPY
Vaccine news is priced in. Commiefornia lockdown = Zoom to moon
Only thing gayer than shares is fractional shares. Mods ban this POS immediately.
It was a covered call, not naked selling a call. His shares get sold at the strike price.
Hold till we get to mars
Your mood swings must be insane lmao
Mr. Buydip prolly pulled some strings to include TSLA coz murica gotta trade blows with copy cat chinese versions
That's not how SP500 ETF and SP500 Index Funds work. On December 21 and there after, these funds will need to liquidate the stock that Tesla is replacing and the Fund needs to re balance. Thus, these funds will need to buy Tesla. Look at Etsy's inclusion, it basically ran 50% since SP 500 inclusion.  Main Street will drive Tesla up to $550, and then the index funds will drive this probably past $700 in early 2021 if this bull train continues and no hiccup on covid emergency approval.  It really depends on the weight from the Index.
Won‚Äôt be tomorrow.
I sold TSLA naked puts this morning. Fuck yes.
$1500
Lots of people thought it would flatline until next quarter.
I didn‚Äôt know you can‚Äôt keep trading after hours after 6pm. Balls deep in 10k worth of Tesla 451 cost basis. 

I belong here for sure.
Bought 300 nio shares with it. Might still pay off tomorrow afterhours
Better be putting that money into PLTR ü§ë
I wish HAHA
Y'all acting like S&P isn't going to control their exposure to TSLA. Death to its volatility. Boomers like nice and steady, don't need some fancy car running on light bulbs to mess up their Pepsi stock. You got 1 month to ride the wave
I know it will. Just depends if it's December or later. Stock split is likely imo.
[deleted]
Yeah, just look at the insane ps5 resell value
As soon as vaccine numbers came out COVID ended for the market
It‚Äôs definitely going to run up to $600 even though inclusion isn‚Äôt until late December. I‚Äôm going all in tomorrow!
You‚Äôll lose your tendies doing that
Do I hold my tsla shares or sell at open?
Cathy DGAF anymore. She‚Äôs leaving ARK.
Yes they do.
Only up around 2k so far... some of these long term options aren‚Äôt even moving with no volume
Great job!
What do u think will get sold
I cut my losses in 10k worth in shares Friday and double down on it going up by getting 6 x 1/15/21 $35 calls.. Friday‚Äôs drop costed me around 3k in
Losses 

Will most likely sell before market closes and pick up some puts but will
Come back in whe price is right.
Cool. Did you make any money off this or what? Don‚Äôt break your arm jerking yourself off over nothing.
Legit almost sold mine 30 minutes before the news hit.  Thank god for ADHD
Picked up a 415 C 11/27 this morning. Hold until expiration?? What my fellow Autists say
Nope...
We all knew it.
And yet I did not act.
60% of my portfolio is TSLA, but was 90% before. No more calls.
Mac understands this investment strategy.

TSLA IN THE SPY?
First step to being good ay something is to suck
Fuck me, why haven‚Äôt I heard about CBAT before today.
**FUCK CITRON YO**
that's not how it works.
Theta is tiny 3 years out
Just hold for 2 more years I‚Äôm sure it will pump once they sell their first car
Tsla baby !!!!!!
TSLA boys deserve this win after the last couple months. Congrats gang ü§ùü§ù
Nahh fam, it kinda became a sideways boomer stock the past few months
I bought the stock at 425, lmao
no, balls deep long in futures and tech into the 2018 DEC crash that culminated in the china trade war crash around xmas.
GME gang rise up
9:30, TSLA opens at 470

9:35 TSLA runs to 480ish

9:40-10 TSLA dips

11 am TSLA slowly goes up all day 


Tell me I‚Äôm wrong
33.33% - repeating, of course
Does it run up until then?
I guess this sub is gonna go back to worshipping  Musk now. Haven‚Äôt seen Musk be mentioned much since battery day...
weird how they didnt said 3 parts or 5
Xpev, li beat earnings, tsla made s&p 500, nio going to 60
Only 2 contracts?
Buying ITM calls in the morning and pray to fuck that it takes off after earnings so IV crush doesnt completely do me over. I will hold tho
GME off a cliff AH
Because he sold it, not bought it. Someone else won that trade.
the bitchcoin ripping lately is because big institutions are dipping their toes in as a store of value in preparation for massive world wide inflation from multiple stimulus deals.

citigroup expects the USD to drop 20% in value.

meaning that we are gonna see a lot of shills selling bitchcoins to boomers as the "new gold".
Imagine thinking COVID isn't priced out already and we gambling on the post-COVID market
Better than a lot of people who don‚Äôt even make money each year....
people will sell nio tomorrow to get into tesla. short/sell nio
By morning
BAN
You know the answer.
Jesus christ dude. You are a top tier degenerate. Congrats and fuck you!

I cant even fathom that kind of money
24
hardly anybody figures that shit out even after 4 years of college lol. and some ppl remain perpetually stuck in high school reliving the glory days even as their balls get shriveled
at 386bn market cap TSLA will be the the tenth largest company in the s&p 500

larger than JP Morgan

gonna be some serious rebalancing between now and December 21

some stocks are gonna see serious sell off for funds to make room for tsla
Li
Fuck FAANG. We FATANG now
[deleted]
At least I own arkk
I think Trump is already working on checkmating that strategy. I don't remember if I heard it from NPR or where at so I apologize for the lack of clarity of source but I heard somewhere that Trump has been inquiring almost obsessively if he can legally pardon someone, including himself of all past and potentially future crimes in perpetuity... The expert stated while he could technically pardon himself and his friends on federal crimes any state warrants and or subpoenas would still stand. This is crazy talking about this stuff considering if Obama behaved this way the country would have melted down even at the prospect
This woman attacks Elon for asking valid Covid testing questions, calls him ‚ÄúSpace Karen‚Äù like a petulant child when the guy has resurrected space travel and EV...and papa takes revenge. I love it. And I only have shares...might have to jump back into calls too üöÄü™êüõ∏
Those people now have 50K to buy shit. People buying shit makes stocks go up. Stocks went down in March because people all stopped buying shit at the same time causing a liquidity crisis.

It can hurt the dollar tho which is bad for people that keep their money in cash under their mattress but not for traders
After 2 is that maybe a you problem
Same
I don't think it's necessarily bad news.  It may motivate Cohen to take more drastic measures.

And it buys me some time to increase my position.
no guys i meant send insider info here
Pretty sure docu is in already
Just wait until JPow says we dont need the printer anymore...

FYI, TSLA joining date for S&P 500 is December 20th, 2020.
Every week I watch my tsla calls expire worthless. This week I watch my baba calls expire worthless.
Nice and congrats. A proper Thank you to 
Papa Musk! 150 shares and Dec. 420c!!
I‚Äôm buying 800 calls expiring Friday at open üöÄüöÄüöÄ
I have a PMCC so my profits are fucked to miniscule, god damn it why!!

You think zoom got a shot at S&P????
All I need is one autist to give me confirmation bias and I‚Äôm in. 25 more shares tomorrow.
Ggs in the chat for my spy puts ü§£ü§£
Space Karen lmfao
How would he lose on a covered call with the stock going up?
It‚Äôs crazy how anything short of -1.5% on futures is technically still green open.
KNDI also going up
If I exercised on either, I will just start the wheel.
Imagine thinking DOW would hit 30k before vaccine approval
How many of you tards gonna exit NIO and fomo into TSLA tomorrow?
We on ez mode now
Hope so. Thanks man!
Me too, me too.
yes, ride it for 1 week at least
While we're at it, let's add DOCU, FSLY, PTON, and ZM to the S&P 500. Did I miss any other companies that you want your 401K invested in for the next 30-40 years? Ridiculous. A boutique car company.
And you realize that not one actually holds through expiration?
Nope, but it is greatly speculated. The weight is big on the S&P500 so it makes sense. That is what large inclusions typically do. It is a win for the company and a win for big money. You can gamble that it won't be this week. It may be next week or the following, so right before... but it isn't a low risk trade.
same was said of TSLA.
i dont think $500 can get you a call, might have to do a spread
That‚Äôs Xi punishing you for associating with a capitalist defector
Just bought back in for 2000 truly retarded
holy shit is this insider info
I have a lot of those too. Sold a lot of good stocks for decent gains at the time that would have been monster gains today.
u know someone in here just lost it all on that.
I made 500k on Tesla
Totally agree. Makes no sense.
Do we FOMO in TSLA at market open ? Or are we seeing a quick dip at open then buy ?
Off*
Just like my 2nd wife
Bid ask is so huge in AM how does anyone‚Äôs shit get filled
So how many millionaires were made tonight
Fuck yes.
What if i buy calls tomorrow at 2AM (ET)? That‚Äòll be opening in germany, will the calls be up that much already?
[deleted]
NIO is up
This woman attacks Elon for asking valid Covid testing questions, calls him Space Karen like a petulant child when the guy has resurrected space travel and EV...and papa takes revenge. I love it. And I only have shares...might have to jump back into calls too üöÄü™êüõ∏
Projecting 45 ish
>in ‚Äò23.

I'm not sure I give it that long, volatility speed and strength seems to be increasing, and unless they extend it the fed rule that allows the banks to leverage up higher expires in less than a year.  

I don't know how close they're going to cut it - it could be a slow but steady decline for the 3 months leading up to that, bleeding 15% off the market. Or they could idiotically ride it up to the last minute and all try to sell at once starting another death spiral only a single year after being rescued by the fed.
uhhhhhhhhh
A month out debit spread on Tesla tomorrow
I saw 467
market is cooling off for a bit before it begins to rip again.
I had Tesla long calls and sold them today to buy SPY puts. Oh and sold my NIO calls today too. Worst day ever.
Earnings probably
u/savethisvideo
Here's a secret bro - at no age. No one ever figures it out, they just winging it dawg. Sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be.

-29
I'd say likely. If last week is anything to go on. Epi friend of mine told me there might be another surprise covid medication announcement very soon so I think I'm just gonna hope for some bleeding tomorrow but otherwise just sell even if it's for loss.
Hell yeah. Thanks. Only salty ab this week but I know it‚Äôll pay off in the long run.
Your timing is impeccable. Congrats
Easiest plays the last 2 months were TSLA calls in the 410 range as it always went back up to 420 then sell
>Oracle is trash. Only reason they got the bid was the ceo being a trump leg humper.

I  can counter your argument with the fact that every platform is switching from AWS to Oracle cloud. Look at Zoom.

So you will def see their books getting more green than usual. 

That being said, their stock doesn't really move too much in the long run. So my guess is with the increased revenue, they will just spend it on stupid shit and their stock wont move too much.
Well sai, mate
Yeah, made this mistake with CSX at end of OCT. Never again.
You're going positive on that by eow mate congratulations. I'd personally hold
I don't think the whiteness of Chad Whitmore is the point, I think it's the trustfundness. However in the example jimtalis gives, making fun of the jew is the point.
I'm 34 and quit my job... still trying to figure it out.

Yes

Jesus you did, dont sweat it i have been playing it and never could catch a break and gave up last week. The beauty of the market is you get a new opportunity everyday. Don't sweat it!
The use of MM for million is straight up fucking stupid.
Tesla went up on a split, which is literally worthless.

Tesla went up when Elon released shorts. I was speaking more broadly.
hold duh...
A brain injury.

It‚Äôs becoming my biggest position.
[Seeing Tesla after hours and remembering I didn't buy the calls I was going to](https://youtu.be/pwy5vLQ2rUQ)
let's be real, TSLA ain't hitting 600 tomorrow are they?

was looking at the TSLA chart all day but didn't jump in, fuck me
Ya to hell with stupid shit like shares outstanding and market caps
damn, first CalPERS now S&P500
Thank god im retarded and only went balls deep in Tesla
The only smart move here is: 20c 1/15 or 18c 12/18 

guaranteed profits, but mehh, I need higher risks to feel alive

lucky that I bought 100$ of TSLA today in fractional shares üôà
Does this guy realize that share price will drop $10 on the ex date?  Hope he took that into consideration when selecting strike price.
Bought some leaps; going to be selling weekly CCs against them to the retards here for a year to recoup my initial expenses + profit
Lol r u retardad

Why‚Äôs NIO volume so big?
This is like one big flaming family
TSLA 405c holder closed earlier this week, reporting in
It was my first time buying Tesla, based on no real dd just that it was a low for no real reason
Smh
I‚Äôll short it if it is.
No no like Jim always says ‚ÄúI recommended Apple ten years ago? Did you listen then? If you did you‚Äôre fine don‚Äôt @me‚Äù

I just dug my tesla short shorts out of the dirty laundry bin and threw those babies on.
Dad?
Is having a larger flaccid hang a symptom of Covid?
I sold mine as well. Sucks so fuckin much
Reverse yourself and buy back into tesla. Nothing rallies  likes tesla
Did cash too. I feel your struggle but I enjoy it better.
SEC? This guy right here.
Nothing lol it‚Äôs a rebalancing and doesn‚Äôt come into effect for a while. Source: me, a dumbass
don't you profit still if you bought the stocks less than 425 ?
just get in tomorrow dude... it's gonna go past 550 in two weeks and make after hours look like a dawrf.

Spy about to be up $50 in 2 weeks ü§Ø

Perspective: from March lows til start of November we only went up $100

6 months +$100,
2 weeks +$50
TSLA open $485
All ex-Tesla regards are in NIO rn
Whew. I bought 1 tsla 460c for 11/20 for .73. 

10 bagger? Sell at open? 

I needed this after a string of bad losses.  Is gonna run all day tomorrow?
Realized a 12k gain on $NIO today, made peace with the fact it might go up 40% tomorrow but fuck the alternative
420c fd checking in
I know bro I‚Äôve been there but it‚Äôs a heck of a lot better than being wiped out like I‚Äôm used to on TSLA

Oof
TSLA having its own moon launch rn
Words were never spoken more true than this. This guy is a god damn messiah. I bet you he lost all just 4k of investments in one month on naked calls though like a good WSB retard.
Explain
I have a Tesla 9/17/2021, that I bought at $60, saw it go $110 and drop to $40. Should I hold or sell?
I am just glad I didn't buy shares and write a call today.  I was thinking about it over the weekend because of how boring Tsla has been lately.

Wish I would have bought the shares though.
All it did for like 3weeks was float around 420s
$me
Yea after last stonk split i tokd myself NON EVENT

Now im not so sure
I'm already playing NIO and XPEV. Havent touched WM, but LI was fun for a quick 20% gain playing their  jumps and drops around 1:30 today.
üï∂
Chill tf out TSLA, FDs are going to be hella expensive at this rate.

Who the hell buys puts on TSLA, especially on this news?!!
Reckon my GME 11.50 put may print tomorrow
[deleted]
I think this calls for a limited edition re-release of the tesla short shorts
What‚Äôs gonna happen to spy?? I was up today on puts
AH seems like bullshit tbh. This news is insane. Cohen isn‚Äôt doing too well with management which means he might put out a tender offer to buy GME. That would cause a monster VW type squeeze
Premiums will be through the roof at open for TSLA tomorrow. Should I buy 15k worth of shares and just ride the FOMO/momentum wave up?
$Tsla says fuck those studies.This stock is pumped with retard strength. To the moon.
Congrats!!!
ALK to the fucking moon
Welcome to the winning team, congrats.
Gotta be good value at the 501st once the index funds all sell

Wait so should I deposit $500 on Robinhood to just buy a naked Tesla call tomorrow?
It's all over Google it
üíØ
Tesla trying to stagehog Nio.
Yeah bro chill
I sold my tsla shares at 440 and dumped them all into nio. Tsla needs to hit 510 a share in order for me to regret yoloing on nio
All we need now is stimmy
Yes
Lmao no he didn‚Äôt
Guys I think that was it for the nasdaq. Tech boys pack ya tings and head out.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
$300 per call - right now at least $3700 each, probably more by morning
So much for the DD sticky.
That book was great. I really wanted to see the movie version with Arnold and not Will Smith
Was looking at my stock trades since 2014.  If i had just bought what i bought and not sold i'd be up an extra 40k. kewl beans.
Fuck you and congrats, fucking insider
Nice
Who has the balls to sell naked calls on tsla?
Hmmm tesla calls just dont hit how they use to. Member when they where about 5k atm?
LMFAO. SOOOOOO guess who sold their TSLA $450 11/20s at a loss todayyyyy. Teehee. Fuck.
Tomorrow will be glorious. WMT and SE pls join the party
Looking for value and/or industrial ETFs with good option volume help a nigga out
WE DID IT. AS A TEAM.
I saw this DD. I have 2 400C 06/18. Should I just hold it?
Gg
SP500 is about to become the crackhead index starting Dec. 21st along with any firm involved with it.
fuck, didn‚Äôt get a whale alert this time on tsla, there was a whale before close on split announcement and when it didn‚Äôt get inclusion for S&P then it drilled, sadly no whale alert this time
[deleted]
Wrong
I'm slowly growing as a person and will at one point transition from weeklies to monthlies and then after making a lot of loses, I will realise that I have to lower the range on my OTM calls as well and then... TO THE MO FUKIN' MOOON (Patrick voice)

One step at a time fam
I almost bought Tesla but instead bought 15k worth of GM and Toyota calls today... my body hurts
Guy must‚Äôve made this like 5 days ago
I'm more of a downy saltvoter. Salt2024.
If you got today lol. Tmr prob 500% iv
[deleted]
I should sell sooner than later in the event TSLA announces a capital raise. Those calls would be worthless in an instant.
100 is more than 1.3 so sign me up.
TSLA pp so BIG S&P asking advice on how to take it. In 2 parts or all at once. Better call Riley Reid.
Who bought Nio calls?
he kinda right tho

Rip
boomerberg has a hedge fund manager or whatever saying bitchcoin is getting interest by institutional boomers to use it like gold and could have 500x returns in the coming years because there is a very small finite amount of coins.

boomers with coins that aren't physical is scary.
Remindme! 3 day
You going to sell your calls or keep holding?
SEC. Is that you?
No way... i just bought my first tesla Dec 04 $485 strike call this morning
Hold.
It's no use, sir. It's retards all the way down.
If selling weeklies, I would wait about 15-30 mins after open so you can catch all the people still trying to FOMO in and IV will be ultra high.
Need NIO to pull my ass out of the red. Come on baby... may go TSLA shares if I'm not poor after tomorrow
Surely one of you retards must‚Äôve bought TSLA puts
Quit the sarcasm bro
Damn I saw on RH that PLTR broke $16 AH and came on here to see what people had to say. Was in for a big surprise
Sad that the letter from Cohen is being interpreted as bad. Pressure to move forward = stonks
Pfizer guy did the same lol
This is the most ominous comment I‚Äôve read in a while. WSB really has that much power üò®
atta boi
Plot twist: everyone dumps nio to fomo into tsla and nio jumps to 70 after earnings
Obviously not lol
tax purposes?
Perhaps it is, and I hope so! We'll see how the market reacts tomorrow. OI for 15c and 20c this week is absurdly high, maybe more news be released to justify this.
‚ò†Ô∏è
FUCK YES BOIS PAPA ELON COME THRU!!!! Hope you all bought the fucking dip you bozos!!!!
Need another battery day
I‚Äôm just gonna yolo on tsla leaps
Gay bear died for this in Alaska...
I need a 1% down day to recover all my losses from the last two weeks. If I get that back I‚Äôm going to go into spy 370c for January 2021
I am a bear once TSLA announces a new capital raise bigger than all the others combined.
Fortune cookies
Baba
the automod done fucked up...
Tesla hopped into an Elon rocket and blasted off to the MOOOOOOOOON
Yeah, whenever it's a White person being mocked we should always just sit down and take it.  


...any other group gets mocked and it's only right that they "stand up against hate" or whatever
Tesla is now the gold standard.
half at open
tesla puts gonna print so hard next week
Yeah. I was going to buy some calls after nio er
cheers
Can‚Äôt wait to cash in for big tendies tomorrow üòâ
as long as his hands can type he aint gonna stop
Bruh this is the casino
Congrats man. Tendies to you
Bullish for all EV stocks
[deleted]
it does let you know your on the right track, so keep going and youll evenutally time it better and better
Smart money is buying big tech, you can see how it moons pre market and then dies when vaccine retard algos sell off then smart money comes in end of day when the selling is done.
respect
Nahh it was holding TSLA back for a bit
surely that straight vertical line will keep going up
look at the RUN chart today, even AH, the lizards do NOT want this thing at 56
The IV is going to huge tomorrow, maybe debit spread
Did I miss the $NIO Matrix memes or was that movie-tie-in either too obvious or too not-spongebob for the shit-posting autists here?
This will not age well
Im still thinking about buying the calls, but theyll be so much more expensive lmao
Red planet 

Red market

Never listen to those ghey bears mane
I don‚Äôt hedge bro, all in baby, that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm fucked sooner or later
Wtf?? TSLA is joining SP500!?!?
\#1 EV Company = TSLA... $2,000 pre-split (limited access to China market)

\#2 EV Company = NIO... $47 (Full access to China market)

NIO $2,000+
ATT owns the shit show that is CNN? Going to add some positions since the general public thinks the news is their best friend.
Most of WSB is right on the timing but wrong on everything else haha.
jeez mayne, get that credit card shit under control...it only grows man
INFINITY SQUEEZEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
They're getting what they deserve. Never doubt poppa musk.
that'd be good diversification for once lol, MOON holds 50 stocks in it
I sold my calls for turn around.  Loading up again EOD tomorrow
Did Tesla just single handedly cancel sector rotation
Was that just IV crush today on BABA. Down 30% today on my call when the stock dropped less than 1%.  It didn't seem like IV was high to begin with. I purchased a jan '21 285c Friday at close so im really confused on why it went down so much.
Same here.
Model s‚Äôs
What do i do with my 40 shares?!

Full disclosure: I'm a Robinhood Noob
Awww
Index funds buy whatever is in the S+P.  Could be a company that sells aids covered dogshit wrapped in Lloyd Blankfein's used condoms, they would still buy.
Yeah. Difference is America only has 350m people. China has 2b and low as fuck cost of operations.
Doesn't this mean TSLA is going to become boring to trade for options? Institutions going to buy and keep it boring?
Helloo.. i need advice
good point, the funds will sit on shit for 20 years.
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt get me too horny now..
Probably best to wait for a dip, but then again look at NIOs chart for the past month. Every day 10% gains and everyone said to not do weeklies blah blah blah. It‚Äôs a gamble but what isn‚Äôt
Thank you üôèThis actually helps lol.
Tesla to the ISS!
So sell the calls before the dividend ?
This news is bullish as fuck for GME but who cares I can‚Äôt believe Tesla is up this much lmao weeklies will be 100 baggers
Picked up some CODX for $10.50 in that AH firesale üî•
Chimpuh is that you our boy?
[removed]
Every time I see red futures, I cry because I know we will open +2%.
Fuck that 5min short cover candle at close. Opened 1 /ES short for 3615
Oh fuck tmr... is kang gang lol
Thats not fair to do to yourself. You could've sold it at any other point on the way up too. The odds you would've held on all the way up were always tiny.
People are passing this off as bullish on fintwit and other places lmao
Who listens to Karen‚Äôs? I only listen to retards
TSLA BEARS and naked call sellers PLEASE:  [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org)
Listen dawg I hate to break it to you. But if someone lives from 18-death pay check to pay check they have a serious lack of financial responsibility. Anyone can save $5 of each paycheck. You‚Äôre the one that doesn‚Äôt get reality. $5 is not fucking hard to keep saving. Only people‚Äôs terrible decisions puts them in bad situations. Having kids when they shouldnt. Taking on loans for school when they should be working until they can afford it. Vices and addictions dragging down monthly expenses like smoking and gambling. That‚Äôs the biggest one. If every poor person dropped one Vice and saved the money from it instead they‚Äôd be fine in a year, but they don‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs only their fault
Holding 100 shares of tsla and I bought back my 11/20 440cc last Friday so all the gainz are belong to me.

This was pretty much pure luck, but goddamn it‚Äôs nice to see my vibe rewarded and have something break my way for once lol
How we feeling about our carnival puts?
what is he talking about?

Why are you the way that you are
Fudge. I bought tsla puts in case Elon got bad rona. Enjoy your tendies, ye faithful.

Its on my watchlist, expensive af for options.

Tendie town? More like tendie world retard.
good question. per news release:  Tesla will replace an S&P 500 company to be named closer to the rebalance date - of Dec 21
It‚Äôs worth it though. Cash acct was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made
Holy fuck. All these dumb positions I entered into today and none of them were TSLA calls.
Congrats sir

It‚Äôs so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seeking feedback from the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate pieces. The company that Tesla is to replace in the index will be named later, the index provider said.

Lol RIP folks who like SPY(X) to not be volatile
Roughly 4K profit by my estimation in premium alone if it opens at 460.
Didn't they sell their TSLA holdings?
Just reply to this comment with symbols and I‚Äôll invest in them
Reminder:  


S&P 500 inclusion was priced in already.. like 5 times.. and then 2 more times..
Bro just dm next time you notice, i‚Äôll listen. Literally was thinking about the low IV right after close today and was going to pull trigger tomorrow - then ofc this happens
tomorrow morning is still the second car of the train
TSLA 600 4:30 am today
Lol here i was just watching Tsla stay flat... little did I know it was up to something
Yeah after the next split

If I turn my screen upside down I can see your future
Not for another month
Being right about something but being wrong about the timing is as good as being wrong about it
I didn't know the federal reserve yoloed on fds
 Dont forget about total fatalism. People these days dont see the downside in yoloing their student loans because of looming destruction by climate change, rising facism, nuclear weapons, etc. You average below 35 year old has absolutely no sense of certainty in society even existing another twenty years, so why not make a dash for the caviar as the boat sinks and the violins play? "Its been a pleasure gambling with you boys" as the icy waters consume us all.
you still outperformed my monthly portfolio.
My living costs are $12k a year so a million would last me 75 years

A HDHP for my family of three costs me 30% more per year then my mortgage payment. And a healthy pregnancy and birth still cost me 7k out of pocket. There is a subset of the middle class that is shouldering a plurality of the healthcare costs in the US.
Not wanting to work isn't a problem. Not wanting to work hard and then blaming everything else besides your work ethic for falling behind is.  That's what most of reddit is. Lazy people discussing why their lives are messes but don't want to do anything within their power to improve them.  (And tbf some peoples lives are fucked up because of something they can't control just don't give up)
AMD burned me for a month straight as it languished from $85 down to $70 something and I'm an AMD bull. This was all during ER, cpu, and GPU announcement. I'm not touching AMD for a while again.
Yeah I expect it to hit $60 after earnings
Just loaded more money to buy some shares in the morning
Tendie town tomorrow
So now a lot of funds will need Tesla to replicate the sp500 I suspect
I saw the Volume on TSLA yesterday that‚Äôs why I bought calls. Gotta pay premium tradingview or atleast use your bloomberg terminals
Tesla never stopped being my best friend.
imagine it, bagholding 500 strike calls expiring jan feb march through the past 3 months

Tesla bears mad af rn LMAO
Thank you for including some CSS with that
It‚Äôs so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seeking feedback from the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two separate pieces. 

It will also be one of the index‚Äôs most influential constituents with a weighting that falls around those of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble Co.
Bulls be shopping lambos
Bearish BA analysts are shitting their pants right now.
TSLA 600 eow?
do u think its gonna open above 35 -40 dollars???
Steam roller
Thanks dude
Read the newest Economist‚Äôs special report about why being added to the S&P is a big fucking deal. 

The reason is that ETFs control trillions, and the most popular is the S&P 500 by a long shot, and so this means billions of dollars buying the stock, and this means there are more buyers and thus it‚Äôs in hotter demand, which basically means that the stock goes up
That would be great but I have 4 shares so it‚Äôs not going to
Sold NIO and bought RIDE.

First good decision I‚Äôve made in a while.

Realistically how high can tesla go? If you factor what it was before the reverse split, can it go back to 1000 dollars?
No a car is
Brrrrr
Yes
But you can still look at the price
My balls just shriveled up reading this
This is that good shit, unlike the post about how the money printer always reaches climax once Venus is in retrograde.

Maybe you should look at the IV
SPY won't change it's holdings,   Still 11.2 trillion, in fact this adversely effects spy until inclusion as current companies will be shifted out of the SP.

I sold two of my 5 shares for $2 profit incase tesla tanks tomorrow. Now tesla skyrocket. AMA
Lmao S&P inclusion, up 10%? Not ridiculous at all. Literally so many Algos and funds are going to be forced to buy TSLA now
The weighting is still like nothing. It won't make SPY more volatile.
+/-5% is like noise to NIO tho it's voilatile as fuck.
DO NOT SELL SHARES. SELL CALLS ON SHARES.
Oh for crying out loud. At no point should a reasonable person think this is a skin color thing.
the data says its 2. On average thats what happens when they add it. less growth less volatile
k? or just 500
Same bro, we gonna be rich by our 80s
Why will people buy TSLA at the top just because of S&P500 news? Why didn‚Äôt they buy at low 400?

guys do yourself a favor and invest in MOON for long-term buy-and-hold in your memefolio. it's composed of exactly the kind of stocks that we like to play except it tracks an index designed by the S&P Global which means it will be regularly changed to keep it propped up. Let the big boys do the hard work for you.
I think this TSLA spike is just one of those RH glitches. There‚Äôs no way I just yolo‚Äôd my last $400 into a TSLA weekly and I got this lucky. TSLA 380 open
Wonder how his son feels right now... Tesla's to the fucking moon afterhours
Really wish I pulled the trigger on more of those 400c for 12/18, but I‚Äôm happy with the 5 I snagged over the past week. New ATH tomorrow
Understandable. But Moderna doesn't have profits, it needs to do something with the only product they may have for a long time (it could even fail, that techonology is new and people still might get side effects, like turning all your cells into virus or something, is this the end of humanity? perhaps, mostly yes!).

A bunch of funds now have to buy shares ding dong
Sell
Bruh...
[removed]
It‚Äôs gonna be a 10 bagger
indeed
Bc this market doesn‚Äôt make sense or follow any kind of logic. Thus spy 400 eow
Scalped some 11/20 $420c today for about 12%... held 2 at the bell wish it would have been 6
SO you are telling me Moderna's CEO sold 40% of his holding immediately after vaccine news.. bruh.. you for real?
Lol. Only WSB would be gearing up to jump into TSLA after a $50 jump AH.
Tesla will trade under $100 soon enough
congratz to anyone who bought TSLA calls today
Was DOCU, PINS, ZM, TSLA

SNAP still in it's 2 week channel

ZM might have earnings run-up

But with TSLA just announced inclusion into s&p that might be a no-go, at least for swing trade.
im fucking aweating omggg FINALLYY MEEEEE
Ban
THIS   100% this.
I was going to buy 20 shares after hours and said I‚Äôll wait till tomorrow.
i have weekly pltr's im confident in and im definitely going to spend a little on tesla calls tomorrow because i like free money
Volatility trades in early 2018?
RIP to anyone who closed their calls today
[deleted]
Bro I still ain‚Äôt break even I have 400 Tesla shares at 464$ lol
I guess that explains what you're doing here with us
Yeah I wouldn't go into it now. 

Sell a put ?
Wait 12 hours and report back.
What a retard. Ofc it choose CALLS it‚Äôs a üê±not a üåàüêª
lolllll
For fast food it might be a wash though right? Poor people love it, but that‚Äôs also where they work?

100% agree w/ u
SO TESLA uP 13% aAND SPy NEGAtiVE!  WRIGGED
Who got booted from S+P for Tesla?
TSLA Puts or calls at open
ALL HAIL PAPA MUSK
Well ... I was right but couldn‚Äôt have predicted this. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jv52hs/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_16_2020/gcinelt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

definitely sounds like we're headed to the extreme greed side of things
Guess my 420c will be printing. Question is to continue holding as an autist or watch it burn
jeez man ggs
more than 4-5 bags prob
I missed out on NIO and now this
Went to take a nap immediately after market close.

Woke up to TSLA news.

Made over $500.

Holy fuck.
hype
Si se√±or, theta gang.  I sold a 320/350 put spread a while back, now that it jumped significantly higher I'll likely be able to buy it back (to close the position) for cheap tomorrow and keep most of the premium I originally sold it for.

With options you can either buy to open/sell to close, or sell to open/buy to close.
I‚Äôm thinking the same thing
Hmm they‚Äôre probably rolling it out slowly then is my guess
[deleted]
Sector rotation back into tech, we‚Äôre back baby!
This is how this week goes.. Nio piggbacks on TSLA and goes to the moon, it has amazing earnings and then it tanks to (enter a random rumber from 35-40 here) and then it starts consolidating and mooning again
Dude.....im sorry bro
Me 3
Nice trades bro...
[deleted]
Almost did the same bro but I was like, what's another grand....and now I might actually break even or make money. [https://imgur.com/fTqmusj](https://imgur.com/fTqmusj)
Nobody had any inkling about Tesla being added to S&P??
[deleted]
TSLA is going to have to provide a stock offering provide necessary shares.  Book it.   It's also a good way to grab some cashflow while they are at it.  Don't buy this pump. TSLA has been in a downward wedge for almost three weeks now.
[deleted]
450c 11/20 was 0.75, if it opens at 455 it‚Äôs at least a 15 bagger
Position and advice?
Yeah but that had too much shit around it. I‚Äôm talking broader market like SPY. Spy had no business makin the move it made today. Doesn‚Äôt feel right
TSLS fades or holds tomorrow?
Now amazon can announce a stock split and we go back into July, August feeeelzzzz
[deleted]
thanks yea i think it was.
[deleted]
They aren't but sbe is and they're buying them
Seems like space Karen calling s&p 500 manager worked
Friendship with Nio is over? Tesla is our best friend now?
F
wow ARKQ buys more TSLA lol
Thanks reason being is due to Marketplace sending me this notification 2/3 minutes after you got it. Just trying to see who is the fastest
thank you
I was close to getting in a $100 11/20 445c so I can relate to that feeling
this is actually true...
Damn
They‚Äôre more than 4-5 bag dude, 420 calls were $4 today
LI and FSR going up tomorrow thanks tesla
Yes
Just texted her to do the same for apple then, lets see how it plays out.
Quick - those of you who still have their temporal transition station unpacked, HQ has given the go ahead to allow a 4 hour back-shift for those who are already online to the temporal quanta network. 

I'm going back to get more TSLA tendies. brb
SEC would like to know your location.

Congrats tho
I sold 3k worth of tesla today wheres the rope?
Lowkey should‚Äôve held a bit longer but didn‚Äôt wanna get to greedy, sold at 453 a pop
[deleted]
IV is gonna be crazy for Tesla at open best time to buy thinking 11?
My TSLA 11/27 440C was being a bitch all day, down $200 even though TSLA was only down less than 0.5% at close. Hoping to wake up in tendie town tomorrow
Fuch me. Sold testla this morning.
The casino is a cruel mistress
Dont forget LI
Just think about it, TSLA, is not and should not be the force it will be in the S&P 500.

It‚Äôs going on at a weighting similar to Berkshire, J&J, P&G

This means one of two things

1. SPY/SPX about to become very fun to day trade 
2. TSLA about to become very boring to day trade
Probably my best trade this month

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jv52hs/daily\_discussion\_thread\_for\_november\_16\_2020/gcjapgu?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jv52hs/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_16_2020/gcjapgu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
boomers had their fun.. now it‚Äôs time for the autists to make some money
I mean dude did destabilize some currencies. Why not team up with the other dark side.
I have 3 Tesla shares!
It will probably pump on the news, then continue its slow bleed to the downside since the split. Probably best to sell your shares at open tomorrow for a gain, then maybe buy back in around 400 or 350 if you like them long term.
[deleted]
Screenshots or it didn‚Äôt happen
Stock split
Proof!?
I BOUGHT 420 calls this morning expiring 11/20 . DO I SELL AT OPEN ????? shits bout to 4-5 bag  if it opens anywhere in that range
Buying 11/18 TSLA calls on Friday may end up being my best trading decision ever.
Damn those Tesla calls were so cheap today too
Better than finally selling my 550 calls for a loss....
[deleted]
Vaccine news dumped tech, TSLA news going to dump SPY? Just when you least expect it... THIS COULD BE THE RUG PULL BOYS
So which is it??
I remember a tard specifically said this weekend that TSLA had lost its meme status. I hope they didn't get a piece of this.
Idiots who left papa Elon for nio
Cuz it's not in yet
Too late.
Bears talking smack all week about how covid lockdowns will crash the market Monday and now seems like they have all vanished probably won‚Äôt come out of their cave till next year.
All of this assumes institutional investors currently own 0% of the stock.

Index inclusion is a fundamental non-event - same as a stock split. But with fomo dollars rushing in, I'll look to trade it tomorrow.
Saw it on fbook has to be true
It's after hours tomorrow.
#TESLA TENDIES PRINTING
Meant Tesla. And yeah wtf
if ur thinking of buying its already priced in
You mean sell cause they‚Äôre over-weight?
no they cant, their are children who dont get an allowence, and arnt even able to work a job because of chores and school placed on them with no transportation or options.

they have to leave and work full time by 18-19 years old, and debt is made to survive.

at that point its paycheck to pay check for their entire life.

now i dont have to live like that, but its absolute truth FOR THE MAJORITY of people. all the restaurants that have those mindless zombies in it, all the sad jobs people live at, im fortunate im not one of those, you sound like someone thats fortunate as well, but thats most people. those people are their because they have to be, they are not, and can not be invested in that situation, that have to claw out of it and that takes time, right now stimulus is needed. thats not a situation they put themselves in, many were born into that. your out of touch with reality. as you say "dumb dumb stupid"
Nice. Oh and fuck you!
TSLA will have to prove a stock offering.
I literally do both of these.
üíØ
[deleted]
who insures $BA?
Buy back Tesla around 10am-12pm it‚Äôs gonna take a breather
There's a line of dirty truckers by mine. I know because I saw u/controlthenarrative there.
you bought 100 shares and you're trying to dip out after sandp inclusion. nigga hold the fucking shares for a year at least you investing retard god damn wtf you wanna make 700 dollars or do you wanna make 14k... you clearly dont need to spend the money just leave it alone and learn to buy whats called a "call options" you now own 100 shares. Sell covered calls and puts... like wtf is this shit. dudes got 40k to spend doesnt know what to do with it. i hate my life.
send pictures of one of your cars , or the house
Why would tesla affect spy. Lol. The market cap of tesla hardly touches the market cap of spy. And also tsla isn't added till mid December
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jubp5l/20_days_till_everyones_money_rotates_back_into/
I CANT STOP TWO STEPPING
I‚Äôm so sorry for you...how many calls total?
Congratulations tesla call holders
To Mars baby, $1,000 EOY
Good boi
My dad is buying a TSLA this week, thought about buying calls this morning but went with nvda fml
Hold into 2022 dude. Tesla is a roller coaster, but the only times I‚Äôve ever lost have been when I tried to time the market.

I might buy more later this week if there‚Äôs an initial sell off that follows this spike. But generally, my strategy is just to keep loading in.
Doubtful. too much hype.
why?
Oh it's so nice :)
[deleted]
The correction
No it‚Äôll go straight to like 700 do not buy puts there‚Äôs talk of Dow and the s&p hasn‚Äôt bought the 5 million shares yet
Yes sir Every day until the breed is extinct. I‚Äôm starting a platform that only offers calls, stonks only go up
LMAOOO I upvoted u to get the balance up
Shit better hit 6.50 before the years over
Imagine having the knowledge that investment funds now have to buy a specific stonk and not buying calls on it
Considering 11 percent of the fund is Tesla and it went 14 percent it‚Äôs actually went up in an almost perfect way lol
Cramer is shilling his own company right now. Puts on his tenure. I think he's given up
Tesla or nothing!
[deleted]
Papa elon delivers!
 I sold my tsla shares to buy PLTR since Tesla hasn‚Äôt done shit in a while. Well I‚Äôm retarded
nio fsr tsla
calls on casinos, fast food, and liquor
Damn maybe my $54 and $57 calls of $NIO won‚Äôt be fucked after earnings
George soros bough Palantir?? Ooooh boi
Glad I stopped selling tsla weeklys in Oct. I knew this shit was gonna pop. $$$$
The TSLA FOMO here is off the charts.
I sold all my tesla stocks 2 days ago üò¢. All 10 of em üò¢. 
But happy for my fellow wsb mates. Write me a letter from moon, will ya? üëç
Tesla saved the market
Everyone, get in here!
But I want an electric Audi not a tesla.  Bill Gates has an electric Porsche.  See my point?

Took the shotgun out of my mouth after getting a notification from robinhood about tesla.
How did I get this lucky? I rode shares up on NIO, cashed out at 51, bought puts, cashed out. Parked cash in TSLA at 403/share and they get added to s&p. Lol
You like money and sex? We should hang out.

Well time to FOMO TSLA calls at open and cover when IV peaks at 9:35 for a risk free trade
This is so retarded
[deleted]
Tesla puts at open? This is getting ridiculous
Does Tesla get like some white ankle socks and Velcro sneakers or something for entering the boomer500? What is the benefit to them?
So purple striped cybertruck is the move?
Well spy its been a nice run. You'll now be traded like a penny stock. Up 10% one day down 60% because Elon did dmt with Joe on Mars.... literally.
S & P
are they royals? Or are they slushies?
Can Amazon knight Tesla in and moon too?
Market is still insane. Anything China EV related will go up double at least. Look at NIO like what, 20X. All those gamblers are looking for the next thing.
Ain‚Äôt no way

So when is TSLA announcing a new capital raise to give funds easier access to stock?
[deleted]
I love to see the bears start downvoting. Of course "karmatically" we are deficient because we are buying LAMBOS fuckers! You lose all karma when you take delivery on a car of that caliber.
This right here is why majority of wsb lose their money. Stock pumps 13%? ALL IN WEEKLIES
Still mainly cash gang. This shit is just so fake and gay. Wish it would crash already so I could start makin big plays with peace of mind again
What‚Äôs on the menu this week? Still worried about SPY?
hmm SPY not going nuts AH.. maybe its a TSLA rally
[deleted]
Also. The article is (ironically) free on robinhood
Lol the only green my portfolio saw today was afterhours from my single share of tesla
[deleted]
I‚Äôm thinking backflip
SPCE and PLTR long run, NIO drops for earnings then moons anyway, and GME moons for no reason
Was just about to buy 500 calls for next week bc some idiot on here was talking about this, but every single person in the comments laughed at him so I didn‚Äôt want to follow

You think the downvoter is a real person or perhaps even a sentient algo that inversed this sub, got fucked and is taking out its frustration by downvoting because it can't beat its dick while crying or get ass fucked.
Wow RIP. I'll pray for you
Hold it. Biden Administration should be good for TSLA. When your kids ask you if you bought TSLA stock at low price and still holding it they'd be proud of you for the inheritance.
He probably yolo‚Äôd tsla puts today
So..... the shorts are retarded. I hope this bitch pops in the pre and they all have to cover and we pop to $20 at open. Who the fuck doubles down on shorts with the cohen report out today?

None of who
Dow opening -850 tomorrow
Upvote if you‚Äôre gonna fomo into TSLA calls at open
Puts if she leaves
What if they have already been buying.... Cause they knew... fuckers! And damn whoever did that dd on Tsla being added in q4... was right...
Were you in middle school in 2018 when the SP dropped 20% with talks with China?
That doesn't strike me as a huge portion of the total value.  The S+P index funds are massive.  If there is a bubble I think its in the S+P, and if its in the Russell to what can we do?  Gotta buy somewhere.  That 10 percent jump on tesla freaks me the fuck out though.
Up or down?
>Yeah those Idiots make 2000%-3000% return. TSLA did not deliver that in such a short time.
Sad I'm capped out at 4k if it hits. Got debit spreads few weeks ago
Lost 20K last week. Papa Elon will redeem me tomorrow.
lol fuck nio. it was always and forever tsla
Have you tried not being so poor?
Not how investments work. If you‚Äôre saying you run what is basically a fractional etf and diversify out all your risk, enjoy your baby returns barely beating the sector avgs.
I told all my friends and family to buy calls so we can retire this week. Can‚Äôt wait spy 400 coming in hottttt
It means rotation into tsla atleast for the next month.  It's basically free tendies, everything else should tank as money moves out of that into tsla.
Imagine not having TSLA calls rn. Couldn't be me
Will TSLA keep climbing or do a backflip off the top?
I'm ready for open already.

What color is your aventador gonna be?
I bought TSLA calls at close

I have 385 Jan calls, do i sell the news tomorrow and wait for a drop?
I remember the days we were all patiently waiting for TSLA SPY inclusion lmao
How are your Puts doing?

LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!
Lmao the bears really got butt blasted today huh? You love to see it!
Guess we are back to Tesla memes here until end of year and every other post being about daddy Elon
What are we doing with tesla tomorrow? Selling calls right after open or holding?
TSLA 500 here we come

Elon‚Äôs tweet makes sense now
Yuge
Why do I have 11 Tesla shares when I only
Bought 10
I expect it to be anywhere from 420% to 690%
lolololololol
Who bought Tesla call? Be my dad please
Tech just stole the Dow's lunch money
TSLAAAAAAAAAA
TSLA add date is Dec 21.

None of them even bought yet. They're deciding if they should all buy in one day or in two separate days.

We going to Mars.
Hold it longer than you hold your life.

damn they really needed some FDs to print
Y‚Äôall idiots really going to buy tsla calls at open? Why not wait for the sell off and then buy in
For Theta gang
Tesla gonna hit 6 today playboy
Investing implies forethought and steady ROI.

Nothing about this chart involves either of those things.
Funds that track the index are forced to buy Tesla now. That‚Äôs why stonks will go up to the smooth brains asking.
They should wait or it‚Äôs gonna be a disaster going into Covid lockdowns. Can‚Äôt waittttt for q1 earnings if they go public.
That wonderful feeling watching your put hedges evaporate in value

Oof
Ya definitely jumping in TSLA with you retards. I wanna make some damn money tomorrow.
Can we add BABA as well? Homie needs some love
I can pretend to be sad, but in the end I'm too poor to afford TSLA lol.
Nah too high IV and risk of TSLA announcing new capital raise for funds to buy into TSLA.
It'll probably hit $550 by the time it joins the SP
why would he release this on a big move day when momentum is finally coming back?
NIO will increase more than TSLA bruh...
Bear r soooo fuk!!
This gonna kill my Xpev and Fsr shorts.
(460-420)100
Hahahah. I fukin love this market. Bulls have found the cheat codes. Can‚Äôt go tits up.
Lots of funds have to automatically buy up Tesla now
TELSA 460
Good!
I bought 8 TSLA 11/20 420c at 865 each on Friday sold today for 385 each at 2:00. TSLA gets added to S&P 500 AH and jumps 50 dollars. What in the actual fuck
What gay bear with TSLA puts is downvoting everything
Selllllllll

How deep shall I probe you to get to your feelings Sir?
Tesla people dont know what that means
Lol even solo is on the way up.

TSLA is a real boy!
Can TSLA reach 600 by December. I have 9 contracts expiring 12/4 lmfaoooo
Wait out TSLA run and if the market gets extremely overextended, buy weekly puts.

Otherwise I'm positioned for the correction already
Bloomberg Mobile. I was taking a shit (and away from my terminal) when the news hit. Rookie mistake.
In Musk we trust ;)
I'm bullish and this comment right here scares the shit out of me lol

PLUG drop tomorrow or is retard strength too much?

Fuck that. If Cathy is out, then a bunch of us are too. She doesn‚Äôt get enough respect for being an OG autist with her insane TSLA pumping

My bad, it was a $420/415 with a credit of $200. So risky, but I held and was rewarded. I‚Äôve got another at a lower strike for $135 credit.

Baby gains are still gains I guess.
All I have is 40 shares. 

Thank you Stock Market Gods!
Guh....Ten baggers
Too late for TSLA calls?
gonna print 100s by the thousands
Lot of downvoting bandits on here tonight, which means a lot of people were holding TSLA puts I suppose
That would value tesla at over $1T if my math is correct.
i shouldve sold my pton this morning. hopefully it hits like 105ish tomorrow
IBKR Pro
This is a great way to lose money
Lol
This is the way
Do that with a trailing stop... no worries.
Tsla ber r fek
TSLA calls tomorrow morning?
Congrats
hope stock is not back down by the time you find one to sell

My Robinhood app black and Tesla‚Äôs ass still going up ü§£ü§£
What app?
All these idiots jumped out of Tesla and into NIO lol
[removed]
Got rid of my 11/20 TSLA 440c earlier today...
Inshallah
TSLA is saying ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to NIO
AMD will most likely be at or above 90 sooner than later
Freedom days or CCP days?
This
Downvote me if gay
Doesn't he have the rona?

How much will this pump SPY???

Probably bought tsla puts when tsla was under $415

Money where your mouth is.
I would buy longer out dated calls since the funds have until Dec 21 to buy the shares up.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I'm gonna freak out dude I have been a millimeter away on so many fucking plays. I almost bought TSLA 12/27 $420 calls earlier today but bought spy and RCL puts instead
>S&P Global said that they will announce the company Tesla is replacing in the S&P 500 at a later date.
[deleted]
Predictions on what it‚Äôll reach?
Sorry man. If it makes you feel better that was the smart thing to do. It was probably going to dip for another few days
Fuck i saw the rumor but didn't think it would happen this quick üò©
If i buy puts against your account i will be up 10,000%
Nope. It won't Tsla will have another capital raise to give funds ability to buy shares. This will kill the run up.
Someone pointed out HCAC SPAC as well, they have warrants, HCACW, for like $1 that realize at a $30 share price valuation and current valuation is around $10 a share. So pretty easy money if they reverse merge with Canoo EV
[deleted]
AMC
Why do platforms even offer puts, imagine thinking stocks would ever go down. If a raging pandemic and contested election can‚Äôt do it then nothing will ever bring this market down
Holy fuck I‚Äôm a genius for buying Tesla at $407 today (jk im a lucky fuck thought my broker was glitched when I opened it lmao)
Tsla to S&P500: you son of a bitch, im in
He‚Äôs a millionaire there
Just got some 420 and 450s today cuz IV was too low for my baby tesla. Everyone worshipping false gods in Papas house.
Damn almost bought a Tesla call before close
My condolences
YAHOO!!!! I just had my biggest day ever and despite only having a little in the market I‚Äôve gained over $1,000 in a day for the first time ever, and it‚Äôs well over that!
Weird timing for spy to add Tesla in on the eve of the November correction
AH yeah
Theyre probably gonna drop a couple small cap companies due to TSLA size
50 percent right, so about as in touch with the market as any other autist here
I mean... fuck... even if I just feel the high tonight that is really all I need.
Didn‚Äôt answer my question directly, but I think we found one
Lose only 60k a day? Amateur
His username is PandaGodFliesToMoon. Of course he's sure. I trust him
Big dick buffet coming in to pump PFE
someone on WSB said earlier "TESLA $500 EOY"

I wonder if they knew?
Jokes on you
They‚Äôll be gone soon enough
These puts are about to print, I can feel it
no the fuck he's not
Good shit. Sell at open or hold through
The week? I‚Äôm probably selling to secure the win
ik. hence he is retarded.
Watch Tesla crash hard tomorrow I‚Äôm calling rn the stock has been stagnant and the news is overinflated anticipation
If you didn't immediately cash that out, please tell me where you are so that I can come slap you.

I left out that I withdrew 5 million for taxes and 5 million for a nice house, fancy sports cars. So in reality I only lost 8 million in 2018 to blow up my account. I was devastated and stopped trading until covid hit and went from 370k to today‚Äôs 2.3 million
Meee
Please explain to me the logic behind this comment. Or are you just talking out of your ass?
Ryan Cohen walks into the GameStop board meeting, unzips his pants and lays down the anaconda. He says to everyone, with their total share value totaling roughly TENS of dollars in stock. He goes on to say ‚Äúsee what happened the day I purchased 10% of stonks in your shitty company?‚Äù He walks away, a loud thud sounds as he drags the anaconda off the table. ‚ÄúLets see whats happens when I sells the stonks‚Äù. Fido enters the room in a gilded tuxedo and echos his master Ryan by saying ‚Äúwatch whats happens‚Äù. The door closes on it‚Äôs own as they leave the room. In that moment, the board agrees to sell dog food, toys, treats and covid vaccines. BUT NO CAT STUFF.

Oh I withdraw 75% of gains on every decent win. I'm playing on 100% house money by a long shot.
I have gold and my account is above $25,000 with level 3 enabled. I don‚Äôt have the option
The Vanguards and Fidelity of the institutional world are now compelled to buy large lots of TSLA shares. If you read a prospectus, there's real mandates in place to continously reallocate funds to satisfy requirements

Sure, they've been preparing and buying but today's TSLA S&P inclusion annoucment is a bigger catalyst

Punching myself for not buying Tesla calls earlier
Da fcks wrong with Cohen as a stake holder saying this shit in the press. He should know its going to tank the stock - unless he's roping in more shorts.. Big brain move.
Was down $20K on my TSLA 11/20 430c and if we open near $470 tomorrow I will actually break even.
TSLA 500c 11/20 at open. I have decided
We all do it. I‚Äôve calculated many vast sums and said... if only I get one right... I can play forever with $150-12500 a play.
Sounds gay af
cant wait for NIO open tomorrow.
Welp tsla is the move for tomorrow close the thread

Why would we be worried about something that could literally be months away?
Zimbabwe $
I mean some funds are going to baghold hard if tesla turns out to be a fad or the economy doesn't enable the middle class to buy
S&P inclusion actually has meaning unlike split, it should run up stronger and harder.  
Pick your poison
shares
calls
leaps
600 EOY
I technically have $15k in cash. I pulled $12,000 over from Robinhood because I like the ToS platform a lot more. It‚Äôs taking forever for them to process the transfer.
[removed]
These 9 shares single handedly removed my losses today
Glad I hopped in nio when Tesla screwed me
lol fair enugh hahahah
Okay I have a 12/4 TSLA $407.5 call. When should I sell this shit now??
Hey bears... hold my shorts üòÇ

'Drops mic, and drives away in model 3'...
Wonder what Papa John is up to right now
Shorting TSLA has bankrupted more people than any other play I can think of.
Instead load up on SQQQ shares
What does this mean for NIO?
congratulations and fuck off.
TY daddy Musk for erasing all my losses for today.
Did it dumped my whole account 20k (was all in cash)
Somebody here is bitter about tsla
He said tesla would get invited to the s&p 500 club?
I just looked for the first wsb post, so I could post this.

TSLA IN S&P 500!!!!

no sir
It will definitely hit ath. Then probably consolidate
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm upvoting them üí™üèΩ
But fundamentally which airline is buying the 737 though? I don‚Äôt see how it changes the short term issues.
Possibly
TSLA S&P will pump hard Nasdaq and my PTON will rise from fuking -60%

TSLA $1000!!!!
What news
Worst case scenario it drops. And you just hold till it goes back up
It‚Äôs still a long time until official inclusion on Dec 21, so maybe you‚Äôll have a chance until then
Sold my Teslas this morning for NIO God damnit Tesla I knew their was a reason it wasn't moving at all.
Are you kidding me? That's going to be worth like 600k tomorrow, AT LEAST. 

Congrats.
Chinese EV‚Äôs growing they are the battery supplier
Small & Puny
Retirement.
$400B market cap ü§î
aapl
Nope entire market pumped on TSLA news. It means more money moving into all EVs.
TESLA
up to $453 AH
TSLA inclusion to start the week off and like a half hour before futures open? Dirty birdies Jpow and Elon planned this
Fund managers are forced to buy Tesla for the inclusion of it being added to the index.
fuck tesla, fuck after hours trading
Idk, GME has already done great progress on their website and mobile app too.

Hope he stops shitting on our tendies and starts buying more
Selling both.  [Short strangles.](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx#:~:text=The%20short%20strangle%2C%20also%20known,underlying%20stock%20and%20expiration%20date)

I did not but it was overdue for a pull back regardless. Look at the chart fam. It was way over priced.
ya definitely do not do this. Getting in after the news is a death sentence. you and 10,000 other retards will have this same thought and all get burned. Learned this the hard way myself
460 back lip to frontside booterflip over NIO
I‚Äôm proud of you. You could have picked any spacex rocket but you chose to be honest and went with the smallest one.
is this a catalyst for an amazon stonk split???
Any good plays for retards who is going to FOMO tomorrow open?

Will it run up like it did after split announcement?
Zero days.
You sure?
[deleted]
So how much 410$ TSLA weeklies worth tomorrow?
Technically he didn‚Äôt say STOCK MARKET UP BIG. I think we‚Äôre fine. He just said it was getting close, not that it was up a lot.
Where‚Äôs that post of that fucker that called it? Think he said next week but still. Wow
Still ripping

Congrats retards
Wouldn‚Äôt want to be a NIO bear retard right now. Deutsche Bank gave NIO a buy rating today. 
They think NIO and TSLA won‚Äôt compete since the Total Available Market (TAM) is big enough for both of them. TSLA will take out shares from gasoline market and other electric car competitors won‚Äôt be the losers here.
NIO, Xpeng, TSLA are not fighting each other but the Internal Combustion Engine manufacturers.

No way in hell I‚Äôm not buying tesla FDS
What the fuck. How did you not end it all when you spunked 18mil up the wall?
exactly, if anything, this helps NIO
Why pfizer is not up on their vaccine news.
they have too much money. can use a tax write-off.
I was hoping that was bottom just tryna make an extra buck for my PLTR calls
Does Tesla gain mean that some of the Chinese EV speculation money will be drained from Chinese Tesla companies?
Two 0.4% sized sell-offs on SPY after-hours
Downsies
Theres a gay bear here that really is downvoting everything that mentions TSLA lol

Also, buying calls early in the morning
OH FUCK! I'M GONNA FINANCIALLY RECOVER FROM THIS!

Edit: When Elon said he had COVID I fucking knew.... I fucking KNEW this shit was gonna rocket because of XYZ.
No doubt
Eh, TSLA is going to be the darling of retail again. They won‚Äôt even be cheap due to volatility. Bet a 450 put for Friday opens at like $20.00 per share.
Fuck you
Son of a fucking bitch I sold my 420‚Äôs at a 50% loss
Lol this cracked me up. Goooooooooo Tesla!
You turned $18 MM into $2.3 MM?

Jesus, just buying $18 MM into SPY or VOO would have been better.
Umm but funds are forced to buy large amounts of it hence inflating the price
Fomo into tsla shares rn?
Step 1: Make a shitpost about your positions on wsb 
Step 2: Let manifestation do it‚Äôs thing
How much you buy them for

Seems to be downvote and go and stalk their girlfriend‚Äôs boyfriend on Facebook.
tesla inclusion about to steamroll all the nio holders as people rotate out of everything into tesla
But has an ICE stock ever been as big as Tesla?

Even in 2000 at the absolute top of the market, when they were building literally millions of cars, before anyone even knew what an EV was Ford was worth only slightly more than Nio is now.
I‚Äôm happy as fuvk over this Tesla news. This type of shit trickles to other related tickers especially during this EV boom.
at least post a source.. sheesh.

Elon you are going to save my calls!!!!!
to be fair, you had no business doing that play if one day was going to scare you that much. you were risking more than you were willing stomach.  tesla gains are for retards who don't know how to sell.
Wait why? NIO did well today
It just keeps on going up bro I can‚Äôt even look at it anymoreüòî
Holy shit is the tard who‚Äôs still downvoting everyone still at it? It‚Äôs been 2 hours.
I did and she was hot as fuck and the sex was amazing-- I really liked her. But I would get stoned and annoy her so she broke up with me. Came back later but I was too lazy to care
TSLA hasn‚Äôt done shit lately because daddy stabilized the price movement so S&P would take them on. Back to volatility every day now :)
‚ÄúNIO RISES AFTER HOURS ON HOPES OF S&P INCLUSION‚Äù
It will be killed when Tsla announces a new equity raise to provide more shares for funds to buy.
If you consider economics of borrowing your future tax dollars to pump billionaires businesses a good use of funds I guess. Although Biden better not forgive student loans that would be almost as retarded

Being a recent IPO, I'm betting it benefits a LOT from the exposure. Right now it's mainly some gamers and some wsbers who know it exists. Also that chart is sexy enough that it should help seduce some people on that alone.

That‚Äôs the point lol. Market just trying to rally on retard strength, it‚Äôs all built on hope. Economy is slowly turning over but market won‚Äôt realize this for another few months or so.

Opposite.

1. End of dumbass market manipulating tweets from the presidential toilet
2. Chinese Trade war probably over/eased
3. Maybe? actual competent coronavirus response (if that's even possible at this point lol)
4. Less chance of general instability from having worm brain in the White House 
5. Biden is a corporate Democrat and the bull market loves when things don't change, like the Obama bull run

TSLA 500c about to go up 400% tomorrow. Congrats, you bastard.
That's because its a scam company with two employees and the last time the founder tried to make an EV car company, it quickly went into bankruptcy

TSLA 420p 11/20 the play tomorrow
Yes I expect this to be the catalyst to commence the blow off top to 400+ before next correction
yeah i get that, but you'd think ppl would want to get in on SPY now

Been batin‚Äô all day. Not stoppin now
Yeah for sure! Model Y or Model 3. Probably Model Y.

Who are they removing now that TSLA is part of the S&P?

WOHOOO GO TESLA!
Bears are doomed even the boomer WB is aggressively buying stocks.
Pffftrt little shit. My penny stocks are up 22% today and that is a slow day.
RIP
Extra retarded
Buying tsla calls at open
FD? you crushed it
Nice
Sooooo everyone is celebrating Tesla getting added to the S&P500 like that is a rocket ship to mars.   Maybe I‚Äôm retarded.   No, I am retarded....but....there‚Äôs no reason being added to the S&P should increase the value of a company...
I invested 70% of my portfolio into Tesla on Friday. Wish I bought calls instead üò≠
fuck ya dude!
Yes Boeing! Meet your makerüò§
Played vaccine names all year. Finally hit last Monday. Positions going into Pfizer news last Monday were calls in citi, TripAdvisor and Xle
The same people blabbering about NIO IV are the ones who are going to FOMO into TSLA weeklies opening over 1000% üòÇ
Stock split incoming
Who are they removing?
I think people are using TSM as a cheaper in for speculating on NVDA and will use their earnings report as a timing to take profit. That‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôll dip a bit on Wednesday but I‚Äôm pretty bullish on it overall
Imagine Not buying that NIO dip on Friday?

LMAO!!!!!!
Imagine being a trillionaire with all that money on a Robinhood account.
Huhhhhh

It‚Äôs forward looking but all of the ETF‚Äôs an ETN‚Äôs that track SPX aren‚Äôt going to be rebalancing their portfolio by buying a lot of Tesla until it is included. This should be too hard to comprehend.
Weird. It‚Äôs almost as if you shouldn‚Äôt alienate your entire fan base
i spent all early ranting about how nio was effed and tsla would rise again. im in touch with the market on a subconscious level

TESLA TO THE FUCKING MOOON
All you retards thinking this is somehow bad news for NIO, an EV being recognized by the Institutions is great news all around for EVs. NIO will probably ride the coattails of this news.
I posted a source above but sometimes it's like come on just google it, especially embedding a link on the mobile app can be annoying
If I just made over 50 grand I would fuck lol

Why are you assuming the Black student at Harvard got 1900/2400 but not the legacy white student or white woman. By the way, the biggest beneficiary of affirmative action is white women (Google it) and not Black students, as you seems to believe. 

The fact that you seems to believe a random Black student at Harvard got in with 1900 but by your own admission you don't think it's the same for white women, even though you admit you don't know much about it, exposes your bias (dare I say it, racism even). Why are you so quick to give one group the benefit of doubt but not the other group?

Full disclosure: I went to an Ivy League (i can DM you proof if you want) and i can assure you the students with the low SAT getting in aren't Black students. It's Tiffany Witherspoon and Chad Jackson whose great grandfather, grandfather,  father and mother all went to the same Ivy and parents are all multi-millionaires. Ask anyone who went to an Ivy or prestigious school.

When that story broke last year with the rich parents paying for their kids to get favorable placements at California Universities, how many of them were Black students?

Who was even in TSLA lol
NIO still up AH I have shares in TSLA too is everyone thinking NIO dies tomorrow?
Thanks man. I could cry, lol.
I‚Äôm pretty sure someone posted a comment earlier about 6000 shares of Tesla bought earlier today. They def knew something.
I bought 100 shares a few days ago when I saw it jump like 40%, figured at $5, it still had plenty of room to multiply, then got another 100 the next day. I'm up almost 100% on just these shares. I feel like I shoulda yolod my whole account on Thursday lol.
what's hilarious is that a felon can run for president but not vote for president depending on the state he lives in.
Same
Why? Couldn‚Äôt he pull out take the small gains and make bigger on Tesla then get back into PLTR?
At the same IV (it‚Äôll definitely be much higher tomorrow) at it‚Äôs current AH price ($455), one TSLA 450c 11/20 would sell for 13.08
that has never failed.
They were added to the S&P....
No, I‚Äôm just the cuck who likes to watch my wife get fucked by her bf. He gives me lunch money sometimes
F
It will be in the top ten most likely, probably under 2%.
Look at all the bears and their cute pathetic fear mongering. So cute, keep it up.
Lmfao at these downvoters. Absolutely wrecked.
üòÇ
When are they gonna add NIO in the S&P 500? Lol
Now just wait till Cybertruck is released. People think nobody is gonna buy it.
A week is good enough for a quick dump. Have a look at what happened with the pfizer vaccine. Quick spike and the sudden dump. This is how you make G's
Can confirm. I bought Tesla
Tesla 680c 11/20.  Good or bad?
TSLA 500c at open?

Of course it's too late
I believe 500 is just a rough number they try to hit. I think there‚Äôs a few over 500 as it is today.
not until December.
BABA !!!!!
Omg i love ARKK. Holds 9% tsla
You must be retard extraordinaire! How did you go from $18 million to the bottom in three months?
There goes the days of Tesla being a safe haven.
Holy shit NIO and TSLA gonna carry the market tomorrow
nah i already know

it doesn't make up for the loss of all the expired calls over the past month unfortunately, but ill take it.

To all the autists who luckily read this, if you buy calls first thing tmr morning you‚Äôre gonna be paying so much when the stock overreacts before calming down and also get IV crushed.
Strange how using an exaggerated WASPy name in this context is not considered hate.

Something tells me if I did the same thing but named the guy "Schlomo Sheckelbergstein" there would be a different reaction.
What a Loss, holy shit, haha!
Its not TSLA joining the S&P, its the S&P joining TSLA
How much would a 420c be worth if open at like 460?
I‚Äôm referring to your first sentence.
Downvoters salty they had Tesla puts!!!
Positions??
market doesnt give a fuck about facts its forward looking. if anything, itll moon hard until the actual inclusion and then sell the news

That‚Äôs great, you‚Äôre a fool to not realize many of those leaps will expire worthless as the EV market develops and clear winners and losers are seen. NIO isn‚Äôt even the biggest EV company in China, and literally competes nowhere else, yet has the marketcap of Ford. Anyone sticking through earnings is a fool.
Finally the DD i'm lookin for. You must be the JPM analyst, right?
All EV will pump tomorrow.
Great fucking day today
This is the way, puts at open

what's wrong with me, i feel nothing. i was waiting for a  pump so i can exit my calls, and here it is, yet i don't feel any sense of relief.
Yes because Tesla is the only source of electric vehicles.

Seems everything EV went up but that
which ironically THIS is the reason for the right to bear arms.  so that when you had a wannabe despot like Trump try to seize control people could stand against him.  too bad the libtards refuse to believe such things could ever happen in their wannabe utopia.  I'm a democrat who hates Trump btw.  I just can't stand the AOC/Warren wing that continually fucks us and keeps republicans in power.

Prob calls at open but I‚Äôd caution you this maybe already played out, ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Puts on $CHYNA
"I'm up 40%, but I COULD be up 2000%"
Oh shit, everyone better also pile in to SNAP

This is the way
Pre earnings pump + Tesla moon mission = NIO 60 eod. It remains to be seen what happens AH.
GME up .50 after hours. Is it an EV stock now.
Chinese EV companies in shambles. Don't tempt the EV GOAT.
Could you imagine being a fuckin‚Äô gay bear right now?? Elon is shooting giant green Tesla dildos into the whole EV sector currently -

üåàüêªüî´ü§¥üèªüñïüèº
So you‚Äôre saying my 11/20 640/650 call spread has a chance!?!
Everyone get back to focusing on NIO..... don‚Äôt let Tesla do this to us
[deleted]
SPY 365 and QQQ 298 TMR sounds about right.

DIX 41.5 today.
Looks like people are selling msft & aapl for tsla in ah
So whos getting kicked out of the S&P

OH MY GAWD WE‚ÄôRE GONNA BE RICH THX PAPA ELON AND NIO
MODS
AH precum action says otherwise
Who's going all in 500c in the morning? 600c?? 1000c??? Are you even gambling????
Use EXT
I see the new bear patrol is working like a charm!
If you want clean energy that holds TSLA buy QCLN
Any ideas on what kind of weight TSLA will carry once it hits the S&P in Dec?  Wondering if we see a pop or meh?
SPY 400 CONFIRMED
Imagine being excited for Tesla right now, while still doubting Chinese EV ü§°
[deleted]
Buy shares
lol you make 200k a year you already a rich mofo
man you get just killed it with this trade
I promise you bro I‚Äôll come through, but honestly you have like a 1% chance 350 happens.

& You venmo me $500 if it hits 400 by eow?
Holy shit
Kissinger sounds like Bane from Batman

I bought TSLA on Friday purely for SpaceX üöÄ play, would have never expected this outcome. üöÄüöÄ
Fck.. In hindsight, the s&p inclusion was so obvious. Tsla has been known to make big moves after a period of consolidation. And with it not moving when every other ev ticker was mooning in spite of all the tech advances , it was obviously pinned to show stability for inclusion.
I know a fkin retard who bought tons of Tesla shares. He told a lot of them on Friday and bought NIO in the 50s. Idiot!
FUUUUUCCKKK I sold a quarter of what I owned this afternoon and re-invested it into Moderna. God damn you Bogandoff!
Call and put options are for degens and I'm never touching that trash again unless it's selling them to morons.
[deleted]
Shareholders would revolt. Lawsuits everywhere.
How? Orders arent filling for me
Are the market and the economy not related at all? Everyone says economy sucks but all I see is new ath for every stocks and massive pumps this year blowing out precovid highs
Alright hands up - who thought about buying TSLA calls but said nah?
I honestly wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if spy opened at 350 tomorrow. It makes the least amount of sense, so spy puts?
[deleted]
[deleted]
yuppp
Lol
Did they just get that memo 1hr 48mins after 4pm?
oh man. thats.legit sad..sorry to hear about your friend.
Sold my calls and stock earlier this week...
If you were bullish on the SpaceX and for some reason still held TSLA fds, you basically made yourself a millionaire
Yes
remind me indeed
Rotation from Nio back to tesla tomorrow at open
Has pullback to 18 a couple of times maybe this time it will hold
praying for you bro that this gain holds tomorrow if not moon shot to 470 at open. Godspeed
Joining S&P
[deleted]
My TSLA puts are gonna be -99% tomorrow. Nice.
Yes
Will TSLA pump the same way it did when stock split was announced?
250
[deleted]
As long as you have a legit fast wall charger, and not just using 120V from the wall. In colder temps, Teslas use more energy to heat themselves than your wall can supply from the regular plug in.
Or sell everything and yolo NIO lmao
Congrats , I just want to see ccl sell off tmrw . Wish I was holding spy calls though
For sure
[removed]
I wonder if the shorts will cover? I hope they think they can knock it down when the forced buying begins.
NIO bag holders in disbelief.
Because u gotta diamond hand ur calls
That's what I was thinking
TSLA safely docked to moon AH
How many millionaires we have in the chat boys???
Ignorance is bliss
Who‚Äôs getting replaced by Tesla? Bet it‚Äôs Etsy. Lmao
send me a teslaquilla I can't get it in hawaii :p
Good for you brother for hanging in there.
> I'm a bit concerned there is no real business model and they are selling vaporware

Truly a wsb autist.
Give me one good reason to trust you
Listing to the SP500
yes son, you did good. daddies proud.
Can i buy tsla shares ah with td ameritrade?
Nope, gotta wait another month retard
STFU
It's over for a lot of foods. He can't bite.
Really depends on where the mining contracts are I suppose.

going to grab some TSLA 1000 calls
It's gonna go higher, hold until next year
TSLA back on the menu boys
S&P was leaving his texts on ‚òëÔ∏è Read for the last 10 weeks 

He needed to act out to get attention

S&P literally can be pronounced SIMP
ma mannnnn
Was there any incling this was coming today? I had no idea
[deleted]
Didn‚Äôt say I was hoping for those prices. I just know how euphoric fomo can push prices well beyond reason in a matter of days
Conflicted. PLTR or SPCE?
So are we supposed to go all in on TESLA calls when the market opens tomorrow or is it too late?
ATH
It‚Äôs never too late, NIO mooned for like a week
I'm punching myself for not buying calls today. I seriously almost did it at least a dozen times......but I'm a bitch, so I didn't.
Wtf happened to TSLA?
Going to skip 30k and open at 31k
Congrats!üçæ
TSLA's been edging on SP500 rumours for months and tomorrow its finally gonna CU-CU-CU-CUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMM
Tomorrow Elon is gonna do a massive hit of Melange and start tweeting about the last time he did DMT with Joe Rogan. TSLA drops 15%
Can‚Äôt wait to follow up w this
Gonna need an ark to navigate across that jawline.

Whats the article about btw
Bezos has said before already that he doesn't want to
I i randomly bought tesla Leaps today, did i do it right
Went up bigly then down biglier, no fucking clue but now I'm buying store brand tendies
I guess the 396p 11/20  I sold on TSLA is safe now lol
no way. how the fuck does he eat corn
tfw when u sold your tsla calls to buy more baba salvage calls
MOMO, IHRT, RKT, T, CTXS and BIGC.

No reason for these to be as low as they are. I am loaded to the teeth on these.
IWM I believe has close to 50 billion in market value so it‚Äôs owned heavily.
I have HD because of global warming.
Daddy did tell us there was a Space Launch Today ü§∑
EV is hot industry.
How _dare_ you!
What's TSLA gonna be EOW?
TikTokThots is what happened. TikTokThots.
No lie I was doing some back of the superglue DD and I honestly think that companies like this are the future.

Grey area ethics aside: this shit is the way.
It was also battery day. Musk killed alot of the bravo when he states it is way to high and it would take years for it to maybe grow into.

&#x200B;

Tsla won't moon like it did before.
Because it‚Äôs just that. Luck. Lol
Same. I‚Äôm scared of selling cc on TSLA because it can moon our of nowhere. TQQQ or MSFT seems better IMO
No shit
Fuck ya!!!!
Tomorrow at 830 there will be tears
Flamboyantly dressed ursines partying above your basement
Fucking A Tesla fucking A, they made sure to announce the inclusion when most folks were turning bearish
Let's go KNDI! looking stronk!
So is that like X 170? Or am I extra retarderd?
SNAP in the S&P 500 too?????

is tsla gains taking tendies away from other stocks?
Gz!
tesla up because it joined s and p and now it definitely will go up more but maybe not though
really?  is this a serious question?  and do you mean isolated like individual voters, or widespread, systemic, conspiracy level?  because of course there will be at least a few voters BOTH republican and democrat who did something wrong like vote in a state they shouldn't have.
 https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1328462461377376256?s=20
My man
Screw your name. I love your opinion!
I‚Äôm down 70% for the year
Sold 64 shares of tsla today at 1215  ü§°
ICLN?
So TSLA cured covid? Cool.

congrats to all the Muskrats out there. I shouldve never left you for Will Li, Papa Elon
Nice, bought 20 1/21 $425 just before close because TSLA was pinned at the bottom of the channel.

[https://imgur.com/a/cucDSH3](https://imgur.com/a/cucDSH3)
At least he had set his stop losses.
Your entire 55 bucks?
Sold 2 of my tsla 550c 3 19 for $120 profit today rofl
My friend did it and ended up with teeth similar to this: https://i.imgur.com/GA04G3L.jpg
Risking 900k to make 100k. I like this strategy.
Do u not know how the market works at all? Like genuinely. If you think spy is going to do the most historic run in history this week off simple news of Tesla getting into the S&P, your delusional and this isn‚Äôt for you. If anything spy is now more inclined to dip to rebalance the S&P, but with that said it‚Äôll prob open green tommorow, but no where near the price you‚Äôre hoping for
Yes
Hold for life man its gonna fly
Guy who sold his TSLA calls today for a loss is on a downvoting rampage. I hope you earn a dopamine molecule for each one. UPVOTES FOR EVERYONE.
TSLA gonna keep ripping tomorrow?
How is he possible I've never lucked out on this shit
Spy blow off top to 400 eow or ban me mods
I don‚Äôt think puts would have reacted to the price change yet
Dow 30k ehh?
Is it that shitty? Like not even Christmas lights and shit will be up
That‚Äôs worth it and then some congrats
I had 2 of those fucking TSLA $420C for Friday ... bought SPY puts instead ... I think I hate making money. At least I got NIO $45C for Friday.
RemindMe! 4 days
thank you for such a rich response! people like you really make this subreddit my favourite! so are you calling or putting?
Lol that is my portfolio.


Edit: yes, I am retarded.

Why are NIO, XPEV, LI all moon?

Ouch!
If TSLA wanted to , could they reject an invitation to S&P 500?
[deleted]
Should‚Äôve bought at that 443 dip
Yeah, the function/look of the actual product does not matter.

Heck, even a fking pidgeon can be sold for 1.6M.
I'm honestly curious if einhorn still have a tsla short position of some sort.
RETARD HERE...  Are the calls still valid since it switched?
Congrats üéâ
NKLA mooning like a parasite ... I'll take it
WAKANDA fucken PRIDE
TESLA FUCK YEAH!!!!

MISS OUT AGAIN DID YA HAHAH
Dont be sad man
You buy a Wendy‚Äôs with gains like that
Nope Look at AH action.
https://youtu.be/locbkLQo-k4 non TA bullshit daily update, today was short but I‚Äôve got a bigger video coming out this week on gamma risk in the market
Next stop the DOW...
You love to see it.
THE MAN IS A LEGEND!!!!!
Who the fuck has TSLA weeklies in here. Sold mine this morning.
How tf are they going to enforce that. Like why are they even allowing people to come in if that‚Äôs the case
Ive trained myself to identify my urge to seel a covered call as a signal the stock will moon
Sold allmy xpev & Nio at open today. I feel your pain. At least we've made some profit from this game.
I sold my Tesla calls today... FUCK
It‚Äôs not
It‚Äôs sad when they ask were they should put there 200$üòÇ idk buy half a share of tesla.
Congrats on making $40 what you gonna spend all that on???
Congratz bro. Plz buy some stock in something and don't just yolo it again
[deleted]
Thank you for your servixe
I need this one so bad. Took a 30k loss last month, I‚Äôm hoping my calls cover most of it
Thanks bud. Anyone without a helmet care to opine?
I think people who know more than you think it‚Äôs going to end well though
Looks like it will get there, or sell at open ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
That is really good question. New ATH for sure but is it going to hold is other thing.
It‚Äôll announce a split by Friday. Don‚Äôt ask me how I know
Tell me what happened with SmileDirectClub
Nah Tesla will issue new shares for large funds.
I sold two CCs at $480. For the past couple weeks I've been selling at $500 but IV has been lowering and I wanted the extra cash.
No one knows tbh it‚Äôll just keep going
The clean energy ETF I am in, does not hold Tesla. The clean energy ETF I am in holds plug. Frick life.
yay! 

Dont know what compelled me to buy this today but I'm glad I did. I wish I had bought more, but these are unexpected tendies come at a time when I'm very hungry. 

I'm either gonna be smart and sell tomorrow at open or I'm gonna hold until TSLA 500 or bust.
My out of pocket maximum is $4,000 so I‚Äôm good there.
$ROPE
One after another, I'm just missing all of these big plays man. Fuck me.
I went in for 100 shares of psth today, would love to see an acquisition announcement before EOY
That shit will print!

I called TSLA a boomer stock the other day... I guess I‚Äôm the boomer... ü§°
Knowing Tesla it will be down 3% for no reason tomorrow - then rally next Tuesday instead
Congrats retard
what will it be worth at open?

It‚Äôs been a painful few weeks but didn‚Äôt sell shit.
Who has the balls for TSLA 500$c 12/21?
Tsla up 10%.... sp down 5% due to increased risk...
Lmao. Nio back to $5 after earnings. Time to rotate back into tesla.
F
üåàüêªs show us your TSLA loss porn now!!!
You sir do not understand passive funds and etfs
Who‚Äôs buying Tesla calls at open!? Next stop: 600!
Profit is profit pigs get slaughtered
No one cares
It‚Äôs hard to see how this can be bad for EVs in general. Tesla is the undisputed king, but there is room for more EV brands just as there are plenty of ICE brands (and of course some of them will be future titans in EV). It probably doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference to NIO but it does no harm.
I had one weekly $430c and $380p. Figured they‚Äôd go to 0. I can‚Äôt wait to see who went all in on some weekly calls.
Did NVDA just move 10% AH? No? Okay no one cares

Equity is def the better move
Started building my 3/21c $400 position today thinking that I'd be able to buy a dip this week.  Looking like it aint turning around anytime soon now on that TSLA news.
My humble expectations for it are somewhere between 12 and 500.

Per share on a $50c, yeah
I've got 10 11/20 $420 calls averaged at 6.75.


Edit: I've also got 20 shares but I'm not selling those.
I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on tbh
This is an EV thread only now sorry fam.
I get pleasure from downvotes more than upies. It tells me they hurt hurt
I just don‚Äôt know why anyone would ever sell. Then again I bought in at 47, so capital gains would destroy me anyway. If I sold I would be valuing Tesla at like 350ish which is unreasonable lol.
I bought at 22 got out at 48. Fuck this noise I‚Äôll take 110% gains any day of the week.
God damn tsla porn is back. I knew when I saw a post Sunday asking when Tesla is gonna be interesting again I shoulda bought calls. Fml. Congrats boys
I just died laughing so damn hard, feels bad oomf lol
Im thinking more about fskr and solo
DIY dental? LOL. i mean. im.a fuckin retard that cuts his own hair but yikes

Oh. My. God.
TSLA has been consolidating for so long. Congrats to the call holders, debating on whether to jump into a 500c at open, thoughts? We rallied SO fucking hard on potential S&P news + delivery numbers in the summer, and I know people will say "pRiCeD iN", but I wouldn't be surprised if TSLA rallied to something insane like 600 over the next week.

Great, now show us your YTD.
Holy shit, so glad I‚Äôm at least still holding one call
Wonder who's getting knocked off the S&P
This friday
NIO is for uneducated losers who are easily tricked by oriental pump and dumps
We tried telling them smh
It‚Äôs going to pop huge enough to not IV crush dawg
Ooo, I've been too scared to touch ZM. Might be worth doing some research
Spy blow off top to 400
loaded up long dated ZM calls and shares for their earnings
Tesla to be included in the S&P 500
No
Damn Walmart doesn't announce earnings until tomorrow?

How much shit do I need to purchase tonight to make sure my $WMT 11/20 160c print?
Should i dump my spy puts at open?
What were they? 440?
[deleted]
Lol TSLA news is good but stock price is still 10x that of NIO. You‚Äôre a fool to think people won‚Äôt be buying leaps on anything related to EV.
[deleted]
I will never cheat on you Elon
That just shows me he can't do simple math lmao
There is a etf called MOON.
Based on the numbers of vehicles they have reported for Q3 (12,206) - it's going to be another record high sales.  Most big time investors are going to ignore that fluff.

Their average price per vehicle is around $40.9k USD.  That would make their total vehicle revenue in the ballpark of \~$500M.  Maybe 6% sales of random shit like home charger kits - puts them at around $530M of total revenue.

Their profit margins on their vehicles have been around 9.7%.  This yields $48.5M profit from vehicle sales.

The number that everyone is going to be waiting on will be Loss from Operations.  Q2'20 was -$164M.  If this number continues to improve, you can expect price support at current levels and higher.  They're selling their vehicles with a warranty, but they haven't had to deal with maintenance yet.  The cars are still pretty new with low miles.  9.7% profit is going to erode once they have to deal with problems that come with mileage.

If they don't show any signs that they are able to reduce their operating costs and increase vehicle margins - big money investors may decide that it's a good time to take their profits.

My guess is that they will show slightly better operating expense numbers but not enough to give anyone a meaningful conclusion.  As such, I'm predicting that this stays within the expected move.  Strangles.
Post all your gains porn then
[deleted]
I mean, it was up 6% today. You were in the green. SHould have sold.
Honestly might be a move given this retard strength of the market
Always market is on easy mode. Calls are free money
Bro u would be lucky to see 366
after hours tomorrow 60 eow bro
S&p inclusion dec
Ah I see. I have a LEAP that I was up about 50% on. Now I‚Äôm probably gonna be back even or down some. Just gonna hold on for a while I guess. But congrats on getting out at the right time.
[deleted]
I shoulda bought more
Ty
Missed it
Minerals were up pretty good today, will we see a continuation tomorrow?
So 12.00 x 5 and you're looking at $6k equity tomorrow
It‚Äôs going to make me something that‚Äôs for sure.
Yeah. It's going to fucking 600 by next week
The chat was clogged with all the poors buying NIO and GME the past few weeks
AMZN
Will my calls hit or nah ..should have averaged down
More action AH than I had all day.
Me too!!!!
Whenever a meme stock stops getting chatter on WSB, it‚Äôs time
Anyone holding SDC calls? LMAO
how much money of calls you holding?
lol nice 10 bagger
how much money of calls you holding?
Hold my shares till Elon leaves for Mars eh?
Would it be wise to close my PLTR leaps that I‚Äôm only up 5% on to FOMO in TSLA?

PLUG launched a public offering for 750 mil
Bro what???? That is fucking insane? Why would they even let me in if I‚Äôm not allowed to go anywhere?
Dumb.
TLDR; buy calls on emotionally charged subreddits
NIO is also up after hours so not sure why your upset,  celebrate everyone winning.  NIO up 4% after hours as we speak
Pretty much only XPEV [https://i.imgur.com/IQaFfwq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IQaFfwq.jpg)
Told ya on the weekend TSLA is going to the fucking moon this week. Look at my comment history.
NIO calls will be down like a million percent 

Good time to buy
Nio gonna have bad day
Im driving in my Palantir. /s
Name sounds cool though.
If NVDA tanks earnings what does that mean for AMD?
A 450c 11/20 TSLA was only .75 ! BRUHHHH 

Congrats to all Call Holders and all of EV Bull Clan. !

Bois what‚Äôs that green dildo on tsla?!
Thank you NIO, next TSLA
This is just the beginning homie
Elon needs to hurry up and come out with an Elon Mask
Selling more shares
Honestly? I‚Äôm up a lot from AMC calls when the stock jumped 70% on the Pfizer news. Just felt like yoloing some of it and 450 was really cheap haha
Ah yes no s&p500 companies have ever recalled anything
Posting gains on tiktok, typical autist
I held Tesla calls all throughout September hoping for the SPX news but got fucked so many times :(
SP 500 is actually gonna fall the week b/c of rebalancing.
Li calls and leaps
i will trim the top, cause when they add a stock to the sp it always moons the 1st week then it dips and start growing naturally
Doesn‚Äôt this help SPY as well as TSLA?
700
Yes
This gonna be like aapl stock split

Looks like TSLA just started its next big bubble run. Time to jump in on some OTM faggy Ds and hope they print.

Jeez, how much collateral to sell naked puts on this shit?
PLUG issuing 750 million bucks of shares, had to see that coming after the stonk has run up so much last 3 months. I got lucky AF and sold all my calls in PLUG at 3:56 today, whew!

Calls, absolutely. Shares, Never.

Im jacked to the tits but its pretty low volume so I woukdve been better off increasing my positions in GME.
EOD Tomorrow as NIO call holders dump and get back on the righteous path papa musk has laid
TESLAAAA
WELL BOYS TSLA IS FUCKING BACK!!!!!!!!!!

500 EOW/1000 EOY LFG!
You were saying?
U dumb motherfucker get a life
Nio,xpev,ride calls looking good , thanks tsla
Oh boy lets see what the PJs do to Tesla AH. SPY has to buy it at any price.
I'm in but I'm a bit concerned there is no real business model and they are selling vaporware

(this coming from a guy who just YOLOed it)
AMZN is too fat to move
Are you? Lol fuckin no nothing dweebs right here üòÇ
I've got 13 Dec-Jan calls and 100+ shares. OH BOY
Yeah I agree. I'm  trying to not miss out like some people that waited for 3 days straight of NIO climbing to jump in. I jumped in day 1 it started climbing even tho I wasn't in before that and still got a 100% return on the two calls I had. Anyways, I have some shares, so that should be enough for me
Heheheheheh that tickled
But guys it‚Äôs was already PriCed In
NIO is opening at Berkshire Hathaway levels tomorrow
Nice. Congrats bro.
ü§£
Are they back to thinking it's Stripe?  Or is that wishful thinking.
Aaaaaaaand it's gone
Hi. I'm here to remind you Christmas came early.
Hold lol
It's a simulation
NIO will probably jump because Tesla did.  Also their earnings is tomorrow and it's looking good.
Lol. Chinese EV AH flying üöÄüöÄ
Once spy hits $400 off of retarded EV joe energy we will sit under it for a fat minute
Really hoping this will help out the FAANG and nab a Couple of dollars on MSFT
To flip burgers for us, son.
Nobody tell him
Like they don't have enough? Are you retarded
How much will this push S and P up?
It's not too late to buy. It should gap up multiple times between tomorrow and Dec 21
Remember me when you buy a yacht!
$1275
So my telsa fds i got for shits gigs are gonna print i guess. Cool.
Which one of y'all did I sell this tsla 385p to for 1k. My condolences üòû
That has never not been a successful strategy. Daddy Musk needs a new meme.
$6.50
You really are an autist. It went up AH.
an equity is more valuable when in the S&P because its eligible to be added to a shit ton more boomer funds (like SPY)
Yaaaaassss. TSLA still prints. All ev calls printing left and right. You love to see it.
...ok.
Yeah but nobody buys Russell index funds.  Everyone buys s+p for those fat returns.  More value in a company at 501 than a ten percent premium on s+p
the mother dough is finally rising

NIO 65 after earnings
Confirmation bias marked
I feel like NIO is split right down the middle between bears and bulls.

How the fuck do I pick a side when I can‚Äôt tell what the majority is doing so I can inverse?

Also why did PLUG dump?
I‚Äôve been holding this whole time
Fuck you smile direct club, my fault for investing in a fucking braces company.
oh no F
Bullish for spy prob
put in a limit order of TSLA 420 at 420, hope some fool throws me a bone
You realize time decay is gonna eat your gains right. At expiration the price would need to be above $8 for you to make more money than you already did.
Boomers havent even heard about Tesla yet. Still 21m till Cramer tells them.

You guys are welcome for TSLA. I bought puts before the close today.
BOT TSLA 11/18 calls on Friday hoping for an announcement on SP500 inclusion. Fun times ahead.
No shit my eyes hurt now I‚Äôm taking a nap fuck
The fact that an S&P inclusion significantly changes a company's valuation, which is solely fundamentally based on earnings and growth, tells me we're very much still in a bubble and so is Tesla
Befor the market closed i bought $2300 x5 Leverage worth kf stock! Luckyy me :D
So do we think we moon tomorrow or drill
Baba plz don‚Äôt b geh tm
I had to recover from battery day but we back in it baby. 5 spreads 450/460
Calls on my funeral.
looks like our prayers were answered
What does this mean for SPY?
YEAH! FUCK THOSE CHINESE BASTARDS AM I RIGHT? Please for the sake of my puts.
Gotta wait tomorrow at 9.30 pus strike price is at $480 I doubt it will print just glad I didn‚Äôt miss out on this
So y‚Äôall think we gonna get the old TSLA back? And push to 500?
Damn bro. Ya those expiring to 0 :/
FUCK!!!!!!! Was going for full yolo TSLA today, but went for NIO instead.
my 500 and 600C TSLA calls will rise from the dead like Jesus??
You might be underestimating how much profit the USA provides to healthcare companies. Multinational companies headquartered in countries like Germany or Switzerland get nearly all of their profits from the USA and barely make anything from Europe.
NIO ATH at the open tomorrow... MARK IT.

üëè üëè üëè
How do you get ah trading on td
Desperately needs to invest in $BRACES
No. 

All calls will be down at open
If you listen closely you can hear all of WSB move their GME $ into TSLA
Are NIO earnings premarket or post market? There‚Äôs conflicting info everywhere
Commie
That's about how much the calls were ITM today. Why would it be more than that?

I bought 2 of them (for $750 total) earlier.    I was so nervous about that because everytime I do that, I end up losing that.     Hopefully this will erase the bad plays I made last week.

Yep. There will be a sell off.

Ath this week or what?
So your whole portfolio is VTI?

NIO is 100% going to print
No doubt. I don‚Äôt have a position, just trying to understand

Well im going full retard tomorrow in TSLA
I think there is a bubble in the S+P.  Tesla just joined it and jumped 10 percent.  No additional news, no extra value, just joining the s+p.  I think I'll look for deals in the Russell.
If NIO opens bigly green tomorrow I‚Äôm definitely dumping before earnings
You filthy bastard.
You just made me rich!
No one knew until AH
Only TSLA calls finna print
And the next day... and the next day...
Puts now!
tesla calls at open are 100% the play

theres no way it doesnt REEEEE FOMO EXPLODE to $500 at least temporarily on this news

plus you've got the green new deal
fuck nio the king is back
nooooo i sold tesla last week. dammit!!@!!

Elon, many here doubted you. I never did. Thank you for blessing my loyalty. God bless Elon Musk.
NIO TO THE MOON LETS FKN GO üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Balance
There‚Äôs tons of competition this is an emerging space I would say where what this category of software is not fully defined and tons of people are converging in the same space from different directions.

The Problem?  In large businesses you have tons of data from different systems and lots of inefficiencies.  It is very hard to have a single source of truth and front line workers attempt to game most systems that measure them.

The Solution: I like the title Execution Management Systems (coined by Celonis), but no one yet agrees.   This emerging class of software attempts to combine data, analyze it, and allow you to automate and take action from one central system.  It also allows you to set different business priorities and based on those may recommend different actions.

The competitors:

Analytics tools:  You have Tableau, Domo.  Primarily built on reporting they need to extend into automation, and process mining and AI recommendation engines.  I‚Äôd say they have a ways to go expect Tableau with Salesforce could have many of the pieces.

Data Warehouse Tools: Palantir is somewhere between this and analytics tool with an AI component already well developed.  These tools work to store and analyze data and also usually have some automation with the systems they interact with.  Snowflake is the big name here.

ERP/System of Records: These systems mostly approach the problem by trying to do all analytics , AI, automation, within their platform.  You‚Äôve got Salesforce, Workday, SAP and Oracle here.

Systems of engagement: a set of tools that usually are a front end for other systems of record.  Notably ServiceNow trying to be a universal front end to business systems.

Process Miners:  Celonis is the big name and growing fast.  They approach the problem with unique tech that analyzes how processes flow through these systems.  I think process mining is a critical piece you need to execute the insights and automation and a lot of the players above don‚Äôt have too much of that piece.  

RPA:  UIPath and Automation Anywhere.  They started out just automating on the front end.  Now they‚Äôre trying to add other components to be a universal execution engine.  

Middleware: Boomi but notably Salesforce Mulesoft.  They need to add analytics, AI and process mining to get to where this space is going.

Everyone knows this Execution System/Universal Truth is where the future is at.  No one has every piece of that figured out.  But everyone sees while there will always be a place for a system of record (like an ERP/HCM and CRM tools) this new kind of software will be what guides those tools (the one tool to rule them all so to speak).  

Despite what Palantir claims they aren‚Äôt the universal leader but they are like a top 3 choice.  This space is crazy fragmented and no one even knows what to call it yet.
Same here. I‚Äôm down so much on a very large position but haven‚Äôt sold any of it for weeks!!! Our patience has finally paid off!
MODS!
Who is this grandma on CNBC? I bet she bakes mean cookies

NIO 250 by August 2021
Of the 1.6 million autists on this sub, what % do you think trade? These threads move so quickly your post is off the page within like 5 minutes. How am I supposed to tell people about stuff like

Micron Technology touted its use of replacement gate (RG) technology for its latest 3D NAND flash memory, which it said is the first 176-layer NAND shipping in volume, while other players are focused on 128-layer NAND.

MU 90 btw
Eh I wouldn't have listened. I only bought a few way OTM calls.
Hope you had TSLA calls too!

Lmao they are pulling all the fking stops to keep this market up untill some more vaccine data. Starving these bears mannnn thru the feast part of the season. RIP
Got a job offer today with 10k‚Ç¨/year less then I demanded. Told them to fuck themselves. Now I need a play to make some additional income next to my current job .
Well it does help in that when ppl buy SPY and other ETFs the APs will then buy some tesla
Spy 400 eow
SPY has a criteria and Tesla meets it. I don't see. Why it would fuck over SPY
Shit will officially be lost, just try to remember the pump before earnings on the thought they MAAAAY turn a profit and then they MAAAY gett in S n P. Now that its real??? Wooof this will be fun to watch (from the sidelines ofc because I am a fuckin retard who sold after split)
Yep the premium will be insane
Walmart probably beats earnings. Plus launched so they got a boost. But it's run from $130 to $150 already so maybe a sell off?
**EV BULLS REJOICE !!**
are you in a management position?
Boomer ETF gonna be even more volatile thanks to TSLA

lol man I literally told you word for word, google lord... here's the link.
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/14/what-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-means-for-borrowers.html

You bring up some good points. I like debating so I don't mean any offense or anything person btw. 

If I can just plainly speak, affirmative action is something white people came up with. University presidents or some group (mostly white people) wanted more diversity. It's not something that black people asked for specifically so they get defensive and rightfully so when other groups complain about preferential treatment.

It doesn't cause you to be racist but it creates a divide between groups of students. If you are at Harvard and you know that the black student in your class got 1900/2400 on his SAT when the average is 2300, then you're going to feel like he doesn't deserve to be here. 

I don't think it's the same for women. That's a different discussion. I don't really know enough to comment on that.
Oh shit I just bought my first tesla call this morning. Am I rich now?
Spy 380 by eow or ban me
Daddy Musk took a nap for a month after carrying us on his back for a whole goddamn year and we all ran to some knockoff plastic clone stock like he was yesterday's news.

Shame on all of us. We don't deserve his gains.
The TSLA S&P news was conveniently announced the day before NIO earnings. Elon sending ya'll a message -- Fuck Chinese EV's. TSLA is back!

Stop buying way OTM calls on short time frames you retard

Dude. For real. I was looking at 10% OTM calls two weeks out this afternoon. Fuck.
Oh sick I have 150 shares of costco in the boomfolio
I WILL NEVER TRADE BOOMER STOCKS EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!
Was wondering wtf happened. My 335 short put is safe.
It‚Äôs so strange seeing boomers talk about crayon lines on charts like they have meaning
Renaming to S & TSLA.
Yeah I was ducking confused too
Sold my two calls last Friedan after a $3000 loss...need $r0pe calls
Tesla going to be that much more overvalued by time it gets added, not good for the old spy.  Good luck
Google Tesla SP500 and hit news then sort by date, it‚Äôs there
At least you didn't go short on those calls. 

Just imagine all those theta gang nerds trying to recover their capital tomorrow.

Heyyoo what‚Äôs good
There's a pinned post
Hi dad
Dude this will send spy to 400 + by Thursday
If you'd have put in $38,249,804.30 when it was at $100, you'd be worth 7.9x10^12 …ô
I'll take it too, we'll be showering with tendies
I guess high demand and BB has been reliable in the terms of privacy and security. If Apple follows through with their privacy plan (Facebook, unable to sell data from peoples accounts if its registered through an Iphone, same goes for Google, Twitter and so on) then that commitment would likely make BB obsolete, but for now BB is the only company that isn‚Äôt allowing sale of data.
Same! Lol!
Collecting easy premiums
Tesla news let‚Äôs go
It's the overall EV sector that will just go up.
TSLA $600 EOY

Depending on vaccine advancements and covid rates, there may be a short squeeze within next 4 months if things look optimistic. 2023 may be a bit far out depending your strike price, but going long never hurts.

Who's the next sucker? like who?
EV market full send
CNBC covered it.. Google is ass for recent news my guy
looks like we loading up on more NIO calls at open boys!
I'm health conscious. I do not drink most juices or sodas I try to eat organic, but when it comes to energy drinks i give 0 fucks what chemicals are in them. Just chug Reign and Redbull every day.

Remember when you could have bought NIO for $40/share? 

LOL

NIO $2,000+
Not one person here mentioned Tesla and the S&P 500 all day
You better give me a medal when I‚Äôm right. I undershot it spy will open at 380 or ban me
Congrats lucky bastard. Let us know the next time you make an irrational decision so we can win the lottery too.
NIO just followed big daddy TESLA now we rise. Come out from hiding you NIO bears from this morning, show yourselves
Give it time bb. I know theta ate your tendies today. Bears eat the rest after earnings. üêª
Lol elon musk you did it again
[deleted]
Pesos?
Definitely feels like 380 so inverse for tendies
Salty tsla bears out rn
Oh fuck you TSLA I wanted to get calls today
Exactly this shit is the news that will gives investors confidence that EV‚Äôs are the way to go
Downvoter bet against Papa Elon BIGLY. You love to see it.
Lol gonna hit a 2 bagger on NIO IC's if we stay near below 52

Imagine buying calls for this earnings YIKES
Why do Bears exist?
Sold my TSLA call today. Wow.
Anyone able to find any news articles about TSLA joining S&P?  Google not showing anything yet...

This is gonna break a lot of hearts tomorrow if not true.
Glad I am still holding my 100 shares of TSLA, sad I sold the other half but made some good change on it

Fuck, and to think I was gonna grab $500c for January but decided to wait in case they retested $400 üò©

This is bad news for SPY. Adding an already engorged cock of a stock will not help SPY continue going up.
This seems like a long way of saying he owns 4000 shares
Holy fuck I bought 8 500 FDs

Alright boys, who else is holding 11/20 $420 calls and $440 calls?? Had a funny feeling something would happen this week! Let‚Äôs goooooo! üòÇ

What was the thought behind buying puts?
Considering how many people responded to me with the wrong earnings date/time I would agree
I‚Äôm pretty sure the stock price hasn‚Äôt recovered to any Friday point, that plus theta would make any position bought on Friday lower regardless of expiration
Canadian
I don't think it's worth $800B
yes
Eugene V. Debs did.

It is possible. Not likely to succeed, but possible.

Tesla S&P500 inclusion counterbalance to eventual big tech drop IMO. Just got to time it right.

I bought weeklies for 420
lol fuck NIO its always been TSLA
What's more likely by eow spy 345 or spy 380
Seems like all the action is gonna be done by 9:30
elon is gonna give grimes the dickens tonight
FATNAG baby!
I believe it is, just a matter of time
Tesla gonna singlehandedly pull tech from this slump. Just like the old dayz
Limits are for pussies
I'm as bullish as anyone here but seriously this isn't normal anymore
That‚Äôs ambitious
Ever
He lives on CAD though, not USD. So why should he care about the exchange rate? All that matters is that he made 60% out of the original amount he had, which is great for him.
I don‚Äôt wanna dance I‚Äôm scared to death
fuck I was gonna buy today and forgot
Position 16 shares that just made me bank and are not not not being sold

Ah, the COVID Spawn.

Of course it pumps

The call is a fun little 5k gamble with my boys for their Christmas presents lmao
The biggest aftermarket green dildo I‚Äôve ever seen

MEME LORD IS BACK.
Yes everything will run ev will now be looked at as the future
Bro those might print like crazy I‚Äôm hoping the best for you my man
You deserve it, üêª
I think it will be steady unless it gets some of that retard meme strength. Big catalysts for them is achieving profitability and gaining more private sector contracts. Even as is, their contracts with USG and other countries will make it climb especially now that their tools aren't as expensive to set up
NIO going to shit tomorrow man. Get with it. The true EV maker running now. Money rotating out of this turd.
Woooooo I‚Äôm fucking richhhh
Who‚Äôs downvoting? Probably a Tesla shorter/put holder
Will my covered call get assigned?  For TSLA?  Damn I hope not.
Looks like you were right lol. near 8% bounce today!! congrats

NIO is up 4%AH. What's happening NIO gang???
I had a 450 calls that I sold for profit this morning. I‚Äôm at my day job crying inside. I wanna quit but I sold my calls so I can‚Äôt üíÄüò≠
Is it reverse battery day?  What is happening.
Futures gonna be lit
No one actually thought this would happen this fast changes everything
Gotta get early on those position
AYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Long over due
Omg today is the greatest day of my life...I have 9 TSLA $410 calls...
TSLA is the cure
They‚Äôre already reacting
Dont forget PSTH. All the big boys are in it for 9 figures. They know something
U guys think this tsla spy inclusion is directly correlated to nio earnings tomorrow? A big fu to gyna
Good luck I feel like these memes move enough to fuck both puts and call holders
Who sold Tesla today for Nio is the real question. Let us know your next move.
Haha doubtful. This type of shit affects all the other EV tickers positively dummy.

it wasn't the time and play I was looking for, but I'll take it!
GUH
tsla will consolidate at 500
I mean, not if you are a true believer in Dominionism.

Ted Cruz and the like literally believe in a complete takeover by Christians and a great transfer of wealth occurring.
Same here
Lmao my baby Tesla spread is at max profit ... :(
Big day tomorrow, could break out
imagine that scene in Flashdance but with tendies
TSLA is no longer a meme stock now that it is a part of the SuckaPenis 500, its just steady growth now
Holy fuck. I'm going to wake up to my NIO puts being .01. 
Haha I'm fucked. üòß
Will do, I bought my calls at 1.65 this morning, was posting closing price, will def see this hopefully on front page tomorrow

Nope. Market can crash.
Can confirm. I'm working for a big german restaurant chain and we are not only looking into it but already rented one out to test the new business opportunity and are about to get four more by Q1/21, developing new markets.

Giving it a market cap of 2.7T yep seems reasonable.
This is dillutive, correct?
Will selloff at open
I‚Äôm sorry man, NIO ain‚Äôt eating off of this news. If anything money will begin funneling away from the Chinese EV‚Äôs and back into TSLA.

Good luck. Don't forget to YOLO his college funds for maximum returns. Guaranteed to have his dorm lined up with hookers to make his life easier

This won‚Äôt make spy go up at all really, why would you buy an etf just because Tesla was added?  It‚Äôs volatile as hell, if anything will spook boomers
Holding tsla, arkk and NIO...
I bought one share this morning just fucking around, thinking "maybe they'll join SP500 someday."
Do you think TSLA will cause all EV to pump tomorrow?
Big passive index funds that follow strictly SP index have to have it in their portfolios since it's now in it. Price will go up and Tesla has big price tag already.
TSLA jumped AH more than what NIO worth.
Congratulations dude - this was such perfect timing!
Means nothing for NIO
Will my $22 credit I received cover my $100 loss? Find out tomorrow on ‚Äúwhen credit spreads go horribly wrong‚Äù
[deleted]
we big brain
And I just was just assigned 100 shares of TSLA on Friday at $420 (sold the puts for the lulz) holy fuck am I a lucky retard
YESSSSSS IM GONNA MAKE LIKE $50k TMRW
Just sell before earnings
Who got tsla puts ? ü§°
Only if u buy fds like a bitch
Sold after hours
Yo there's this new baby formula called else goes by babyf and they're the only all-organic baby formula and there launching in stores world wide can't buy on Robinhood tho
**TESLA IS JOINING THE S&P500 !!!!**
I DONT GGIVE A RATS ASS IM PUTTING EVERY PENNY
Tsla 420.69 is history
Managers have to add it to index funds. Lots of institutional buying has to take place.
My first options trade netted me $15,500 of profit from a $500 trade on TSLA before I even knew what I was doing. I was confident I‚Äôd be a millionaire trading options lmao he‚Äôll get burnt one day.
I've got a little over 10K in various tesla monthlies out to January. This feels like an early Christmas Eve.
What‚Äôs happening to BABA? I can‚Äôt look. I‚Äôm not superstitious, just a little stitious.
A little too perfect?
Bro who cares just buy calls
all the big boys are loading up on it and I think this is going to be a perfect stock
What is this? r/changeyoufindinbetweenyourseatcushionstreetbets ?
YES!
A few way way OTM expiring 12/18
RIP buddy
everything you dumb.
Tomorrow is gonna be historic
Yeah, he'll never publicly acknowledge the legitimacy of this election so that he can use it as one of the main themes of his re-election campaign in 2024.  Jesus christ I hope Biden puts his ass in prison.  that has to be a priority now you would think with the serious talk of him running in 2024.
Puts on your life.
American EV > Chinese Knockoff EV that‚Äôll probably catch on fire
How about we don‚Äôt turn this into another retarded meme stock. Keep this shit on the hush hush! Kool Kids Only
Hyped for daily SPY volatility of +/-2% starting from december
Posts like these is why I come to WSB
AH movement is cool. I guess.
I need spy to gap the fuck down tomorrow and TSLA to go moon and baba to follow
[deleted]
They should've got one of the old guys to say "smoking A weed"
Can we now get a solid rotation back into tech and out of boomer shit (except HD need that to pump from earnings).
TSLA 500 good for all EVs
Hello - PSTH trending up today - hoping Ackman's about to announce :)
The TSLA news is good for NIO and EPEV you guys.  Congrats NIO call holders.
More like China government contracts
Stop stop he‚Äôs already dead bro
Some shit stock no one even knows what it is probably
What a fucking day man
[reaction to seeing the TSLA SP inclusion news while not holding calls](https://images.app.goo.gl/aLNG1ECugozJD4g1A)
If this gets 100 upvotes and some solid DD to convince me then I‚Äôll YOLO my entire portfolio into TSLA tomorrow
Its raining tendies
Lol wtf.  But why though?
TSLA Calls back on the menu boys!
Grimes can attest
Homeboy needs a spac
Motley fool just issued a buy recommendation for NIO...

That‚Äôs the top right there
100% lol but I‚Äôm gonna pretend I‚Äôm an insider
RIP in peace one time for the one time
Any call tomorrow $$
How much is that option worth now
Who sold Tesla today, show yourselves
joining the S&P big dog. Bitch will pump all week.
lol SPY is becoming ARKK. not sure if this is going to end well.
[deleted]
How does being added to the S&P help a stock price
holy shit $.01?? what a fucking bargain!
I'm a NIO bull but I exited on Friday until after ER
It‚Äôs not gonna crash but it‚Äôs not gonna move the 25% expected. IV crush is gonna be brutal
Only shareholders

Not call holders lmao
Stock market rotating into Tesla tomorrow
Yes I went mega conservative because I wanted to price in a failed ER, I might keep the same 25% OTM but just roll it up
So my SPY puts are ultra fucked now. Sick
TSLA CALLS AT OPEN
SP 500 inclusion
Thx
I had fucking 410Cs i sold today.
thats gotta be some crazy hedge
On the other hand who is getting dropped from the s&p 500?
Lol why would it be bad? If anything it will push it higher.
Stop I can only get so erect üò©

Dude its tesla. Its hype machine.
EV Bears in Shambles LOL
[deleted]
^   *Commenting so I can get notified*
PLTR is a joke lol. The company has never been profitable in over a decade and stated they likely won‚Äôt anytime soon. Congrats but pull it out it somewhere else that has a better future.
I wish I can go back 8 hours so I can make the largest tendie order in my life
Calls on ark
death to bears
Sp499 no more we did it boys we made it into spy. Time to destabilize the markets!!!
One article had changed it to Tuesday after earnings which confused me, I wondered if it was a confusion coming out because it was a chinese stock
S and P 500 inclusion announcement
Lol Tesla. I know a dude so deeply investing that every dollar up or down Tesla goes is +\- 4000 dollars to him. Gonna be a happy guy tomorrow
It‚Äôs gotta join at some point... sit back and enjoy the show.
Is 32000C 12/18 too crazy?
kowalski, gimme a sitrep on TSLA
Can confirm. Baby due in 3 weeks
Yes easily changed everything for ev companies
Yolo TSLA weeklies tomorrow. IDGAF
Tesla is making my brain release so much dopamine!!!!
Nope entire EV market going up up and away.

Nio bulls ... Grats
Wtf happened with tsla
FML fomo from trades is ruining me

You sir, are retarded.

EV going to explode tomorrow.
Tomorrow you‚Äôre gonna open $20k in profit
Very little doubt in my mind we‚Äôre going to 370 tomorrow
Guys after a large offering what usually happens the next few days historically?
gdi tesla
Probably, they all rely on retard strength
TSLA gonna take SPY to $500
F
I'm not sure if this is serious or sarcastic
Who has a good feeling about earnings tomorrow now lol
Not forgot already assumed that was priced in during run up today. Didn't expect that movement AH.  Looks like Nio swinging higher now though
[deleted]
Of course it‚Äôs going back up. It‚Äôs shaking out the smart money. You know we‚Äôre still in and ready to pump to 30
OH NO LMAO
Okay so what company is Tesla replacing? Find out and become rich.
Where's the dude who posted the potential 5500% 12/4 call? Fuck I almost bought that
...and just like that this sub is gay for Daddy Musk. not too long ago, u fools was on that Chinese Elon's dick.
Amazing
NIO is up 3.6% AH rn
Holy fuck I didn‚Äôt even see what happened until you said this. Hell fucking yes!
anyone think NIO is gonna crash on earnings?
Yo I need these fools to include the s&p 500 in the s&p 500 so my calls print
Why not hold through earnings?
Levels in reverse (George Monev Edit)
[deleted]
Holy fuck that‚Äôs as close as you can get .. hope you bought calls
Was that on a hunch?
$TSLA TENDIE TRAIN IS BACK
JUST came across my phone from Market Watch but you're right, can't find anything yet anywhere.
Yea this was the post I was talking about everyone fuck
Thank you for your sacrifice
Tsla sub months ago: pft. I wouldn‚Äôt want this to be included in the s&p anyways. Statistically, my crystal meth shows that companies underperform so we are actually better off



Tsla sub today: omg yes. Congratulations all shareholders. We survived.
F
Lol just sold my put credit spreads on Tesla for a small gain.damn that scum.
So trump really was the top?
TSLA SPY rockets to 380 tomorrow!!!

I've been holding $TSLA for weeks waiting on news.

Thank you Papa Elon!!!
TSLA 1000 by eow!!!!
Die delta die
Lol
The goal is to either 1. get republican legislatures to vote to replace the electors with trump electors or and more devious and possible 2. get states to not certify and not send electors to the electoral college.  If Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia somehow delay long enough like saying investigating fraud or irregularities or hey we have to do another time consuming hand recount and oh ooops, look we missed the deadline, guess we're not sending anyone, then the electoral college hangs with Biden at 269 and it goes to the House who will vote Trump president.
Bears are so fucked tomorrow
I don't have any Tesla calls or shares but I'm so happy for that company
They were just added to the S&P 500
well my greedy ass didn‚Äôt get TSLA 11/20 420c for 4.20 because my fill or kill order didn‚Äôt execute
Just saw that, wow, it finally happened
Alright, what‚Äôs your next play teacher?
WTF TESLA
Lmao üòÇ prob not but they do understand FOMO! üòÜ
S&P inclusion. Congrats friend. Btw I just checked you‚Äôre my real dad
Link? Can‚Äôt seem to find anything except that Model 3 - 35k off menu model to be discontinued
At this rate you'll only be down like a million
guh hope not.
The cat was right
How about now?
The cat knew about Tesla and sp500 confirmed
wow.
Salty my only TSLA call is 2022 $1000. At least I have good chunk of shares
S&P is now SpaceX & Pussy
my tesla straddles are fked but idc this shit is üî•
I have 6 calls on tsla. I was so close to doubling down because I always believed tsla would go back to 420. Did not expect this and did not double down ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021 Dec. 17 SPY 340 puts I'll wait
FOMO into tesla tomorrow?
Anyone got the option activity on TSLA today? Someone had to buy some OTM calls knowing this was going to get announced today.
Tsla to the moon

Not at this rate. TSLA is missing the rally. I‚Äôve been selling calls on it.

Edit: oh. Oh no.
I see a gamma squeeze for TSLA. Could see 500 by Friday. 

Just watch the volume on 11/20 500C at open tomorrow. It'll be insane
If I bought bags for my money, id have no money left to put in those bags
Well congrats everyone who has Tesla FD‚Äôs
Lol RIP
So like a June 2023 play then?

Bloody Tesla might as well yolo into calls as the biggest meme stock of 2020 was given new life and is likely headed to 600$
LOL TSLA ....
It‚Äôs going to moon cause Tesla just changed the game for the whole industry and Nio is going to have amazing earnings Tommorow
people will lose their shit confirmed
Guy Adami talking about his TSLA gains as they're happening in real-time, I'd be jizzing all over the webcam
I sold today at $26.50

NIO !?!?!?
He's trying to get enough support so that people who want to conspire with him will feel like they have enough cover politically to do whatever heinous crap they have to do.
Great, now my spy calls have to contend with Musk‚Äôs tweets as well as big Donny‚Äôs
Is Tesla replacing anything in SP500?
TSLA just blasted past 450. Headed towards 500
Needed to rent a small U-Haul for misc items. The guy was really nice. Gave me a free mattress cover, doubled the included miles and gave us an extra day.
yep. we're screwed
2.5k
Being added to S&P500

Imagine buying Tesla  420c at close
Market close you god damn retards. Its on their website. Investor relations
Dang that TSLA 20p isn‚Äôt going to print, is it?
Wow
You think it will moon tomorrow?
LOL TSLA fuckkk
I wanna see some TSLA gain porn tomorrow
So do I unload TSLA calls at 930am or are people going to lose their shit and send this thang to 500 before Friday expiry??
Dude literally put in like 60k at the beginning and it looks like the only gains he had for the first 2 years were from free stocks he got for referrals.
You're good. I recommend cashing out the first time you're green though..
Showed my half awake wife the Tesla moonshot, she didn‚Äôt give a flying fuck
Woof
And pretend it's 1982 and don't trade again until 2020.
This tesla news ain‚Äôt good for Nio
Alexa, play To The Moon by RuPaul
Congrats Tesla, you are now a boomer stock!
Yikes
They think it's getting reemed by the long dick of the prc apparently
That's why you have to bag hold them both.
How in goddam mind did tesla make it to s&p for god sake the biggest bubble of 2020 i will continue waiting for an opportunity to short this bitch the day it gets ejected from the index
Why fukd?
Uh not good. üëâüëå
Elon papa - get back to the daily thread and give us true believers gold - we held!
I literally just bought a 11/20 450c today for $80 as a yolo. 

This shits gonna be worth more than 1k tomorrow. 

TSLA 500. LETS GO
Hello whattttt
God I can't wait to see the Tesla gain (and loss) porn tomorrow
I also sold today!! Good choice I believe.. it was the highest it‚Äôs been today. After I sold it started to decline so I‚Äôm happy
Who just made a million dollars off TSLA
What a beautiful name he has üòä
[deleted]
fuck you and your pump and dump

AMC 3P 12/04
market rotation into tesla tomorrow ü§ë
I'm hard already
:/
Bro wtf just happens to Tesla
you couldn‚Äôt  have know but at 90% loss, what are you getting back?
Quite happy with AMDs performance the past few days tbh.
To be honest, Tesla is so volatile that it‚Äôs really gonna fuck indexes lol
Bro I randomly bought one 440 call expiring Friday for literally no reason
I‚Äôm in Jan and April. I will prob start adding some PBW instead of more ICLN. Gotta be some wins for both there in the next few months
Holy Fuckk Tesla
I have 1 Tesla 420c

Wish I had more
True, but money made from TESLA is just as green as money made from NIO
There‚Äôs the MDNA drop
The s&p 500 could just be the biggest companies by market cap, but then they couldn‚Äôt manipulate it.
[deleted]
Guess who sold $425 spreads on TSLA before close. 

Got $75 credit now it will cost me $500
Literally the first article on Robinhood is about how they underperformed today lol.
TSLA and PLTR gang, I shall see all of you at the lambo dealer tomorrow
Fck me I just sold a Tesla $425 covered call against my LEAPS
WHY WAS I NOT HOLDING TESLA CALLS

FUCK MY LIFE
LK calls?

It's easy to get along with them if you're just constantly fucking.
Lol imagine the idiots who bought tsla puts at 3:59 today.

It's me. I'm idiots.
The timing on tsla lol
I bought LI calls at the top Friday! Need that bitch to pump!
Congratulations Tesla
More specifically pull enough electoral votes into bad faith so that the electoral college hangs and it has to go to the House of Representatives.  He doesn't actually have to flip the electoral votes to him so that he wins the electoral college, more subtly and devious is just get states to not certify and not send the votes or delay to the point where they miss the deadline to certify and send the electors.
AYRO is a solid leap. Once Covid restrictions are lightened, restaurants will be moving towards mobile food offerings and targeting sprawling college campuses as in door cafeterias are not mobile and Covid safe. EV food trucks will also be a solid cost cutting investment for the mobile food industry.
Wanted to buy 10k of TSLA today but pussied out and only bought 1k of TSLA
So these cocksukkers said no before to fuck everyones calls but now they randomly let tesla in, probably have their grandkids loaded up on calls this week.
Dude that's fucking gay but check your inbox.
So Tesla is a thing again?
Fuck sake sold half my TSLA recently :(
Yes it‚Äôs actually very likely we‚Äôre going to see a monster day in the car industry guess what tops it off Nio with a monster earnings
[deleted]
SPY 400 EOW with TSLA inclusion?!
that TSLA 450C is going to be a 10 bagger atleast. Congrats and fuckk you

Tesla to S&P, spy 400 tomorrow
dang this make me sad i dont have any
Sell
Don‚Äôt come to work tomorrow lol
Same...
I should have grabbed a couple more SDC 11p 11/20.
oh no and here comes another round of nothing but TSLA for 3 weeks on the sub.
#TSLA

Added to the s&p 500! Tomorrow is going to be a field day!
Oh I see
tesla posts gonna be insufferable
You are a rich man
NIO is over 47 lol
U should‚Äôve linked it bro
Thank you Elon, very fucking cool üòé
Bears r fuk
What the fuck are you saying?!
0.38$ each trimester means 1,52$/year.
Which is a fucking 4%!
Now, I mean, probably pfizer isn't going anywhere soon, but the difference between a pharma stock worth 37 dollar and a pharma stock worth 20 dollar is 1 bad news .
And just the risk of losing 17+dollar each share is a big problem.
No offense, but if you're looking for annual yield, go with  world etf that pay dividends. Definitely safer.
Factories powered 100% by renewable gasoline powered cars is the future
RIP
huh? please expand for a moron.
TSLA daddy!
Finally some good fucking news! Bought a 600c 12/18 this afternoon!
TESLA LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
What does everyone think of Alibaba
Tsla has opened the pumping flood gates for all the EV‚Äôs . Fuck andrew left!
Then why isn't it going higher?
short
Niceee tsla boys. Grats to call holders
Damn anyone have those 450 FDs for Tesla?!
Oof always gotta look at cash on hand before an investment. If they have none and still aren‚Äôt profitable you can probably guess what‚Äôs gonna happen
Musk couldn‚Äôt take all these other EVs getting all the love.
Fooked
I guess PSTH isn't getting this one?
Bears are fuk
What happened to TSM today?
Who had tsla calls and didn‚Äôt say shit
It's too big to fail now.
Nice timing.
Damn TSLA getting added to s&p?üòç
dam that costco dividend sounds real good wtf
FUUUUCK I DONT HAVE ANY TESLA
Damn, someone was talking about cheap weekly calls. $420 was only \~$3.30 when i looked today but said nah because it hadn't touched 420 in several days.
TESLA!!!!!!!
Wait what??????
wtf tsla
Anyone else load up on Tesla puts at 12:59?
Leave it, there are people here who need this. To all the homies last quarter that blew up their accounts this inclusion is for you.
I still suspect it wasn‚Äôt piss, he played all you guys with the piss trick
It‚Äôs an agreement to mandatory quarantine. Supposedly you‚Äôre agreeing not to leave your hotel or place you‚Äôre staying. They don‚Äôt have the manpower to enforce it, but they‚Äôve done spot checks on various people.
Spy 400 tomorrow off the inclusion rally
Both got upped on their price by Citi.
This is fucking nuts rn
[deleted]
is it actually
I chose to hold UVXY calls instead of buying $420c at close like I had considered doing lmao
Is that how SPY works?
Ehhhh. More like 2022-23
Wow Costco issuing a special dividend of $10 per share. It‚Äôs almost up 2% AH from the news
Duh, thanks
358p 12/24
WHAAAAAA
TSLA IN THE S&P 500

NIO bagholders in shambles. Rotation back to King Musk
Feeling a little toppy
The pre-election market was sinking because the odds of a blue wave and Biden victory were high.  Biden was consistently ahead in the polls for many months leading up to the election.  The rising risk of Higher taxes, more regulation, government intervention to disrupt existing industries, etc, all played into why the markets plummeted. 

Just remember, the present value of a stock now is the discount of all future anticipated cash flows. When a disruption occurs to that anticipation the present value of that stock must change.  There are no other macroeconomic factors that could justify these stock moves.
congrats on your gains
About to buy some shares rn!
Just as NIO started to die
God fuck I just sold 10 $410 calls for $725 (50% loss)
kaput
*Baby numbers fall to ATL and expected to fall further*

I thought COVID was bullsih for pregnancies since couples were locked up with nothing to do but have sex?
Lmaooo Tesla this is so beautiful
Bruh wtf happened to TSLA sending?!
Bought 9 Tesla calls this morning, 11/27 strike. Down 30% today. This pop better carry till the morning
Tesla to S&P means that index funds are fukd when they have to add it to their portfolios
Wow thought I‚Äôd be the first to comment Tesla got into S&P 500 but y‚Äôall beat me to it lmfao
/r/holdup
I have April calls but if they‚Äôre still flat around February I‚Äôm gonna take the loss on em. If I I remember correctly when I looked into them a while back, PBW seems to invest in the consumer market more than infrastructure so maybe that‚Äôs why?
S&p can fuck right off. Of course when I had calls they refused to add them
I convinced my coworker to go all in on Tesla puts (I mean life savings, reverse mortgage, everything). It took weeks, but he finally went for it today, on margin. Everything. Unfortunately they were weeklies. 400p. 

He's gonna be fine right...? Like, the stock *will* go down this week, right?.. 

I share a cubicle with him.
I wanted calls so bad this week but my cash was tied up fu kkkkkkk
So happy I sold my $430 calls Friday!!!
Bruh, I sold a covered call at $425.
Holding a couple TSLA 410c. What'd I miss boys?
20 upvotes and I'll share my plays.... boomers
You fools abandon Papa Elon for Chinese Elon. Meanwhile Papa Elon is sending astronauts to the fucking ISS because even NASA recognizes his superior genes. He's just fucking built differently.

TSLA just mega ~~mini~~\-mooned and went positive for me!!!!
I just bought a share of TSLA, I am now a bagholder
I sold Spy credit call spreads expiring Wednesday for literally like $5 I swear if they get gaped because of tesla I‚Äôm going to lose my shit
TESLA > NIO
Fucked
Spy will open at 380+ tm due to telsa inclusion 

Millionaires will be made tm
Depends on the strike date.
What the hell happened AH to TSLA!? I was surprised to see my portfolio bigly green AH. üòØ
NIO 500 WHEN
funds, etc will have to buy to balance out
I've never seen either (worked on different countries and know many others).

But... I worked with this one guy who would always negotiate his salary on net terms. He was like "i don't give a fuck what's the number you're telling me, this is the value I intend on my pocket". You gotta have the balls (and great experience) to say this but he did.
I opened Robinhood right as it started jumping up and had no idea what was happening to my portfolio lol

TENDYTIME
Well it's up 50% from two weeks ago so
Feels bad

How does tesla joining s&p affect spy, are my 11/27 $356 P fucked
Had to get Covid before they payed attention to him
OMG - it went vertical - should have loaded up on more calls!

TSLA in the S&P, it really is a boomer stock now
Holy fuck Iv on Tesla weeklies aren‚Äôt too high. The day after the stock split weeklies were up 100,000% ü§ê
Not even 20 mins after my dumb ass says, "TSLA split neutered it".  LOL
Short answer yes...long answer yes
holy shit i was going to buy some $450's ttoday fuuuuck me why didn't i pull the trigger
lmao get fucked bears
I was literally 1 click away from getting in on some 420 Calls before close

FUCK.
As long as that shit stays above $22.70 it will rocket. Today it couldnt break it. Tomorrow is gonna be keyüôè
They printed more to hold the inflation.
Not that I give a fuck I‚Äôm holding Tesla calls....but why does being on a special list make you worth 9% more
TSLA is cool again
[deleted]
This morning I made a choice between NIO calls, and TSLA calls.

Guess who I pickedü§°
You realize those aren't play recommendations, just factual alerts to unusual options activity, right?
The chart I saw was performance after an election and not necessarily all time performance. Would be glad to see some charts posted along with the downvotes....
tsla gonna pump like aapl stock split
Will go down as the dumbest decision of 2020 adding an inflated bubble to the index goes a long way to undermine it
We do be printing money now.
This
lOL TESLA Risen from the deaddddd, I don't know why I have a 435 call but I have one LMaO
MODS BAN TSLA
Ummm wtf just happened with TSLA is this a Robinhood glitch?
Who's getting kicked to the curb to make way for Tesla?
Just feel you missed in every sense of the word. It‚Äôs okay ..not all jokes are funny. Then again it‚Äôs probably a super brilliant joke that went over my head.
Who went balls deep in PSTH with me today?
Can confirm, my wife is pregnant with her boyfriends baby as we speak
PLTR knows you bought ü§î
Papa - you did it!!!!
Can SPY come back to planet earth plz

dying's for fools
TSLA 500 GOOD FOR ALL EVs
s&p inclusion
Nio back to 50!!!!
NIO WILL HIT $100 tomorrow. Mark my words
How tf do they enforce that when i was able to purchase plane and hotel tickets for only 4 days, 3 nights?
Does 69 count as a position?

They didn't break before nutting once thought
Now that it‚Äôs part of SP, Tesla can stop cooking the books. Next qtr is probably going to be catastrophic
Livesquawk tweeted it, but I haven‚Äôt seen anything official.

Are you not entertained?
These are the things that I like to here. God speed fellow retard
[deleted]
Some MM bought 3500x 18 june 21 410c today. 2 hours before close, daddy musk is that you?
Holding support nicely. Gonna have to see how the retest of resistance goes, could be forming a double top soon, could be bullish as an abcd in the next 1-2 months
so that was the plan all along, to make tesla trade like a boomer stock before inclusion
Ok TSLA added to spy is cool but what does that do to my spy puts? Am I fucked?
Remindme! 1 year
Negative news about China- BABA down

Negative news about online market place- BABA down

BAIDU/JD/NIO down- BABA down

# TSLA S&P INCLUSION NOT A DRILL
I sold my TSLA 11/20 450C for 90% loss on Friday. RIP
TMU5 & QC0M after hours... dayummm. I dont have any moves tomorrow, I already made them.
Can‚Äôt wait to see the Tesla gain porn
What does the form make me have to do? I‚Äôm just visiting for 3 days and then heading back home. Just trying to see some Christmas lights and snow lol
premium was insane on NIO today.  I wanted to get calls but there was no way a 25% break even was going to play.
TSLA!!
That‚Äôs what you get for being able to afford 100 TSLA stock
First or second week of December
Berkshire reduces exposure to banks? Lol two months ago he was seeking approval to buy up to 25% of $BAC. Make up your mind old man
Do I sell my 11/13 TSLA calls at open or hold? God I‚Äôm shaking right now...
Thank you Papa Musk.....thank you!!!

Goodbye tsla. Onto the next meme
Oh. :)
Tsla will bring spy to new highs
I have ducking shares of TSLA fuck this coulda been calls
Need to make 86k profit next year from 40-60k initial deposit to recoupe losses from this year. Sure I can YOLO it into some meme stock that gets 100+% returns, but imma take her slow n steady with weekly put credit spreads. One wrong move will wipe me out, but hey, it's not about gains, or losses, it's about my degeneracy.
Honestly though. Think about how many people would get absolutely wrecked tomorrow if they killed the NIO party. I just wish I didn't buy these dumb poots.
Costco declares $10.00 special dividend
Wtf does this mean? Do they not just temp check me and shit at the airport to see if I‚Äôm good to go?
**In the Musk we trust**
I yoloed my parents retirement money on pltr calls today...
Fair warning. I‚Äôm a retard. Up 10% the year as of today. But I‚Äôve been down as much as 45% several times.
Ah. My mind just went to things like sports, Broadway, a concert. Haha. 

So yeah at the airport you‚Äôll have to fill in a form and I‚Äôve heard they spot check you.

Could have bought tesla or pltr calls but bought spy puts instead. 

Fuqqqqqq meeeeeeee

TESLA DADDY CHILL
My money?  I ain't giving him shit.  Why does he want money?  You think rich people don't want *more* money?  They don't typically say "Nah Im rich, I don't need to be more rich"
DOWNVOTE ME PLEASE
they the most fucked of all. graduate job opportunities dropped a cliff with covid
Pltr calls are gonna melt all week. Might as well sell right at open, this thing's gonna be flat this week.
Elon telling NIO to fuck right off
WE MISSED OUT ON TESLA AGAIN. IF YOU ARE HOLDING CALLS CONGRATS YOU ARE A RICH MAN
Tesla finally having its day. Joining the s&p 500!!!
Tesla to S&P.... RIP poots..
I‚Äôm lookin for hopefully some bad earnings the next couple quarters to get us back down to March lows on these guys and grab some cheap ass shares for the long term. These are coming back for sure. Free long term gains.

BrkB is severely undervalued

WTF happened to TSLA?
TSLA got added to S&P or what?
SDC is being controlled by the shorts right now. This is insane! Volume after hours is 50% of the avg daily volume. How the FUCK is that even possible. Mooned from $10.70 down to $9.67
I‚Äôll never post my real positions on here due to confirmation of suits using this forum as a leading inverse indicator
Oh I just look and I took it back. 

HOLY SHT
Tsla added to S&P lmaoooooo
What‚Äôs the news ?
Apparently it‚Äôs joining s&p 500!!
Elon if I ever see you in public I‚Äôm going to tackle you to the ground and blow you, I don‚Äôt care what the circumstances are

Not sure what happened to Tesla but I have a 410-430 call spread so that's good. That's like 1.5k since it cost me 500.
I have no fucking clue, but I only want it to keep going
How long for JD to bounce back!?
Is anyone surprised that airbb actually turned a profit? I am
tsla going 500
The virus is not going away any time soon. Once the pump is completed from the moderna vaccine news the dump is about to follow. Easy money man. easy money.
Does anyone know where I can get some conversion therapy... being a üåà üêª doesn't seem to be working.
Long penn aapl and pypl calls expiring Friday. Time for the market to plunge.
What the rigging is going on with Tesla?
lmfao somebodys getting fired
wtf that was so unexpected of sp to do
I‚Äôm happy for the nio bulls that the ride didn‚Äôt actually come crashing down
Not really. Mandatory quarantine depending on where you‚Äôre coming from. We‚Äôve got 10pm curfews now on bars and restaurants.

Tickets to what though? I‚Äôm curious. There‚Äôs nothing running as far as I knew lol
How about this question instead. Even if they beat earnings by 100% YoY. Does it justify a stock price increase of 3000% YoY.
Lol I bought 8 11/20 BLNK 15c wish I had more fuck

It only went up 7% last week
PLUG pulling an ACB and selling shares while the stock is hot.
Bro congrats if you have calls. Look at AH.
I have ‚Äúbuy TSLA‚Äù written on my calendar for tomorrow and this happens
Thing is you went full retard.
NIKOLA
Added to SP 500
That‚Äôs what I get for not buying TSLA calls
$TSLA added to S&P 500
Long $SCAT
Why Tesla do that
TYPING IN ALL CAPS TAKES EVERYTHING I'VE GOT. HOPEFUlly .... sorry guys i just can't keep going... so tired from...
It is a better bet. I did the same.
wuz poppin scro
Someone with an annual salary of only $29,000 throwing $50,000 at a single position... yikes.  Did you actually save up that money or have you had some other successful trades and traded your way to $50k?  Because I remember the days of a shit salary like that and it would have taken me 10 years to save $50k.
Lockdown actually broke couples because as it turns out being locked in with your loving half for 2 months straight is unbearable for most people.

Also you forgot to post positions. Ban.
Ouch -33 EPS for NIO
Good. Pump QQQ TSLA, just like the good ole days.
What the actual fuck TSLA what happened?
Come back in tommorow shares don‚Äôt get iv touched
Alright, alright. Puts got fucked by MRNA today. Understandable. 

Surely the next round of lockdowns will also have a logical impact on the market though, right?

**RIGHT?!?**
What the fuck Tesla
Yeah, I definitely think it would be a smart idea in your case. NIO would have to crater near 30% from its current point to have you assigned. 

For me I think I‚Äôll wait to see how things shake out in the am. If it moons I‚Äôll roll it up a bit but if it remains relatively flat I‚Äôll just hold the line
Tesla call holders about to get paid
TSLA!! Joining spy!
Nio gap up to 50 tomorrow
I KNOW THATS A FUCKING TESLA GLITCH I JUST FUCKING KNOW I DIDNT SELL AT A LOSS TODAY
This ^
I have no idea, I‚Äôm not aware of them having deals with any of the chinese ev companies. They finally fell a bit after hours but the past 2 days have been insane. I can see it getting to 20 by december then falling off a cliff
Whys Tesla printing üëÄ

Put your money where your mouf is then. 

Positions or ban
Probably taking a "gap year"
Wtf going on with Tesla
Should I hold my NIO FDs thru ER?
I‚Äôll have to look into this. The only problem is if sleepy joe gets cucked by the oil boomers, green initiative is gonna get slaughtered. Could be good for some leaps if the business is solid.
Any good reason why BABA is dipping?
11am

True. In the end we‚Äôre all shit talking here. Republicans and democrats are very different from what they were just ten years ago even. We live in interesting times...

Lol I swing both ways. I just fucked up today with poots. That's what I get for going against the grain lol.
Blink ripping with tesla
TSLA getting added to S&P????
14 day quarantine upon arrival OR negative PCR test 3 days before arrival + 3 day quarantine + negative PCR test on day 4
Why Tesla pumping
For travelers who were out-of-state for more than 24 hours:
Travelers must obtain a test within three days of departure, prior to arrival in New York.
The traveler must, upon arrival in New York, quarantine for three days.
On day 4 of their quarantine, the traveler must obtain another COVID test. If both tests comes back negative, the traveler may exit quarantine early upon receipt of the second negative diagnostic test.
 
For travelers who were out-of-state for less than 24 hours:
 
The traveler does not need a test prior to their departure from the other state, and does not need to quarantine upon arrival in New York State.
However, the traveler must fill out our traveler form upon entry into New York State, and take a COVID diagnostic test 4 days after their arrival in New York.

Contiguous states are Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont. Travelers
from these states are not subject to this guidance

BLNK chads report in
Damn bruh, my first option was spy 250p bought near the beginning of Feb, got me 17 bags off it. The first one is usually free, you should ask for a refund.

Market really does not give a shit
It‚Äôs the size above D.
It is, it is.
.20 is .20
50 eod tomorrow, moon to 60 tuesday AM/ wednesday PM, then dump to 40 before market opens to fuck over call holders on IV
The only thing that‚Äôs bring spy down is no fda approval which probably won‚Äôt happen idk lmfao. But till then this bitch will just stay up there even if it doesn‚Äôt go up it‚Äôll just sit
Nio quietly mooning ah
I‚Äôm extremely autist
TSLA YASSSSSS
Same. But 1/21/22 340c. Easy money.
Lulz got 2 11/20 420 calls on TSLA at close
I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of people say hang up
why is tesla pumping??
It achieved boomer status.
Nice
TSLA HUH????

July 19th? That was the only day I would have sold \~2x average volume on the dip I remember that lol
What‚Äôs your best guess for Pfizer and Moderna FDA approval dates?
I sent an email to those fuckers a couple months ago asking for that option. I‚Äôm either not as autist as you or I‚Äôm too autist. Hmm
What‚Äôs going on with TSLA
Should i sell tmr and grab nio instead? Ffff
Awesome that‚Äôs it? My sister was trying to tell me I needed to go get an official test or declaration that I had been quarantining?

Sometimes I am called Albert Sherlock
Ehh I think we are still going to invest heavily in us mining if for anything else then the transportation aspect and trying to reduce emmisions and out global energy outlook going forward. To sleep on these might not be wise but ymmv.
Because all the printed money goes to the wealthy and the wealthy then centralize the inflation in equities.

Maybe I should get a single baba put just to make it moon.
No. Most of the infrastructure to handle it is in place now. And we know that a stay at home culture can be very very good for some businesses. Before it was an unknown. Now its not.
Once upon a time... fomo buy the pump. Panic sell rhe dump. $rope. The end.
You guys are cool. Don‚Äôt look at your BABA calls tomorrow.
Nice
The dog com crash happened in the early 2000s under Bush.

I'll admit my knowledge of the Carter administration is lacking. What happened during that era?

Both parties have changed drastically since the 30s. I don't think its fair to compare what happened almost 100 years ago to whats happening now.
I can turn that 1.3B into 100M using my foolproof trading plan.
I love when memes make me money
This thing just can't get any love. ü§£

Oh well...that's why I got 12/18. Still expecting a near term pop with all that short interest.
When did you decide to pull the plug on your money?
Not even Europe priced in their lockdowns
They just gonna hold nio hostage at 46? When‚Äôs the report
So if it make money what are you buying your cat? And if you lose money are you making a winter cap or some gloves?
Rewatched the Wolf of Wall Street yesterday and for the first time caught Rugrat saying ‚ÄúI think maybe if we short Pfizer..‚Äù 

Obviously I took that as a sign. Didn‚Äôt go well just yet ..soon right ?

I hear you saying that you are currently holding a 45c and you are thinking of maybe holding this call through earnings?
Ya, Karen should be more considerate

Are the stay-at-home stocks going to pump if we go a week without a new vaccine announcement?
so let's walk through this on the most basic of all levels:

2 vaccine companies came out and just said their vaccines have 90%+ efficacy

you buy puts on 2 companies that would benefit from the virus going away

Goat stocks don‚Äôt come around often
I wish bub nothin but mids over here
Based on what, one PT increase? It had a chunk of updated PTs during it's September/October run up and then it tanked back to 40s.

I think DKNG is a great long term hold, but if you're looking for short term plays you're playing with fire.

The best near term DKNG play I can think of is Jan/Feb calls because NBA returns and it's NFL playoffs. Maybe target 45/50. Problem is the premiums are pretty beefy. Otherwise go for selling puts/calls on it or buy leaps.

It's a weird stock that doesn't belong to an industry or bucket of stocks that investors flock to. It isn't tech, travel, manufacturing, etc. This makes it less exciting to own when you want to make money work in a short time frame. There's no reason to believe it'll be up or down $5 by next week. However I could believe it passes 50 again by end of January, but then would scale back again after the Superbowl until NBA playoffs.
What's this "long run" you speak of?
Then you wake up
Is it about the love story of a bi bull and a gay bear?
I bought 500 shares at $12 and sold when it dipped to $10 loool
Yea I‚Äôll hold until my house is paid off
It's not free 10 dollars. The stock will drop by 10 dollars. However people don't know this so the stock should increase going up to the dividend (MM already know this and bid it up AH).

You can see on the day the dividend goes ex, Costco will drop by 10 dollars (but you receive 10 bucks so it's even). However, the stock price generally still goes up leading into this event historically.
even the cat knows bears are fuckin' gay

If this is accurate won't that mean corona will spread quite a bit because the unvaccinated population is younger and more mobile? So why not do a layer-- mix between young and old?
370 ur literally on crack if u think it‚Äôs getting remotely close
when will u bears learn
Nice
It‚Äôs my parents house lol but I do make bank with REI

Can BABA have two 5% days within the next 5 days? Is it too much to ask?
The hell happened to Costco in the last hour?
Fuck off bear
europoors better not redump my tech
im already up 10% in my VTI shares that I bought isnt that what boomers hope for in a year?
What is up with CBAT? I didn't buy any but someone on a facebook group said to buy some last week and it skyrocketed.
Should have bought at $10 like many here back in July when we first starting jerking off to it, I personally didn't because it wasn't available in my uhhhh... tax free account
Good bot
When the eff will we get some red days?!!!!
Your wife‚Äôs BF doesn‚Äôt let you fuk for monopoly money

The amount of people getting screwed for fomoing into NIO is too damn high
Do you hate money?

Especially since we all know that wife's always leave you for a Chad, the only question is whether you know it yet. No reason to make a hit peace about a bankrupt Chinese company that milks it's investors üòÇ.
I see your comment as grandstanding / whoring. 

You could simply say "anyone who needs to talk, I'm there for you" and be done with it. Sorry to be critical, I suppose, I just fucking hate pretentiousness / attention seeking. 

This is not a community, don't pretend that it is. This sub is predatory, and the sooner every member realized it, they would be better off, imo. 

good day.

p.s. It does seem like you care about being downvoted, which adds to my concern about the potential that you are an attention-seeker.
NIO HOLY SHIT
There is no way on earth this doesn‚Äôt happen. It very well may open at 370 if not it will melt up to it by noon tm latest

Buddy‚Äôs hard in calls huh
Any reason for the melt up EOD or just the usual?
I'm more of a long termer. My thought is that by 2022 these will return to their pre-Covid 52 week highs, at which point it is a $350k portfolio. 5 bagger for me at that point. These companies will be much stronger than prior to Covid.
Yea I agree, sold my BRK.B Jan 230 call last week. Left a lot on the table
Someone call me?

Well this is aging like a blue-eyed blonde after 25.
I agree with that. Although on this sub, your positions tend to matter more. On an unrelated note, Im sure the post he‚Äôs talking about was taken down because it was just some guy saying ‚ÄúBuy $RIDE‚Äù. All DD has been getting pinned recently, so this one must have sucked.

Saw some serious growth today though and that momentum has carried into afterhours which never happens for gamestop. Calls today were up 50-100%

over trading lost me about 3K in September.  If you are confident in your thesis you should usually hold.  Sure new info comes in but confidence in your position is usually a good thing.
Can NIO really lose?  I mean I'm thinking the same- I get assigned? Oh well, NIO shares at a deal.

It typically takes 30 years to pay off your mortgage. So you‚Äôre talking about a 55 year old. I‚Äôm nowhere close to retirement age yet and I don‚Äôt have a house, so no, 100k isn‚Äôt enough for me (or for most millennials and GenZ)

Wow, haven't paid attention to this stock since it was around $4 earlier this year. Mooning under the radar all year.

I bought 30 361 spy puts at close on accident. Getting out of those with as little loss as possible is my play. Meant to buy call and noticed I was down 1k on that pump...

‚ÄúThe conglomerate also slashed its JPMorgan stake by more than 95%, from around 22 million shares worth more than $2 billion at the end of June to fewer than 1 million. It also continued to reduce its Wells Fargo holdings, and exited its position in Costco, which was worth more than $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter.‚Äù

Holy shit, I understand cutting financials but I thought Costco was solid. Any reason why Warrens team cut Costco?
I like how you just threw your cat on the floor
Moral of the day: Don't touch your stuff too much

I messed with my options too much and wrote myself into a dumb corner where my gains are heavily capped. If I had simply held the calls I had, I'd be sitting pretty. This is what paper hands does to a man.
Yeah, if it drops then I reduced the cost per share, if it pops off I‚Äôm still ok getting a guaranteed 4% in a week.
370 open... 380 eow? 400 eom?
No. You suck ass
Impeccable logic
The funny thing is some people will laugh at this, but this is exactly where this fucking godsend of a stock is heading. I loooooooove reading all this ‚ÄúChinese scam, overvalued too high, low production, poor numbers blah blah‚Äù trash talk, people are gonna slit their wrists when it actually hits this in a couple years
It‚Äôs ok but I‚Äôm definitely more distracted and get about half as done were I in the office. It‚Äôs nice not driving though and when you‚Äôre off you‚Äôre already home. Perks and cons i guess

No 5 of every 100 will otherwise contract corona. 

Current mortality is 1-3% depending on how you use the numbers and who you ask. 

If 95% creates false sense of security so as to we just go back to normal then 5 in 10,000 will likely die. 

That‚Äôs like 150,000 people; albeit that‚Äôs assuming everyone gets infected and everyone is vaccinated.

Srsly going to regret swapping to NIO lol.  GME still has 2-3x left to go up, 10x with a short squeeze.  NIO may go up another 20 bucks or so, but it isn't going to 100 within the next 6 months
No DD but my PP likes it because I am illiterate and thought earnings was this week when I bought calls lol
The reason I‚Äôm not rich is because if I got that job I‚Äôd dump 100% of my position and retire immediately.

Good man. If I may recommend a particular book, one I have recommended here many times before, get "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. Some of it is a bit outdated, but the general principles are sound and wise. Odds are with his system you will not see wild huge gains, but you will also avoid crushing losses, and can have reasonable hope in seeing a good, steady rate of return.

(Note, he will suggest you buy bonds. That made sense in the early 70s, but, at the present time, bonds are basically worthless due to the extremely low interest rates. Once interest rates return to normal, they are a crucial part of investing, but, for this rare moment, stay away from them.)

Leg in to a put debit spread, then make a call debit spread right above it. It's a reverse condor, as long as your underlying doesn't land in the little space between the 2 spreads, you make money. 

So you get to satisfy your homoerotic market strategies and still make money.

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about VXX, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs just the worst possible bear play to make, buy puts every time in spikes (ended +16%, bought at 2pm) and SQQQ calls if shit really starts rolling downhill. Remember volatility will always go down BEFORE the market starts to recover, so you‚Äôre just shortening your profitability window.

Man you swapped out of GME when it reverses its downtrend finally, and bought into NIO that could easily dump after earnings....

If you're going to dump GME calls, at least trade em for GME shares.  GME has way more upside left over the next year per dollar you spend
Green tomorrow 100%, flat on Wed, red Thu morning, flat Friday, flat Monday and green Tuesday next week

Just to tweak your theory a bit. Trump's actual strategy seems to be to call into question the validity of the swing states votes. Which would delay the Dec 8th date and force State legislatures in those states to assign there own delegates on Dec 14th. So technically they wouldn't be bad faith, they'd be assigned by traitorous Republican state governors.

I mean we can't really call 1% AH a moon, but I'm glad to see it breaking $16 again
You're still number 1 if you buy the rest of the podium. Fb is such a classic example.. Most of the new generation doesn't care about the original fb anymore but the stock goes up
That‚Äôs a lot of risk for little reward.
Exactly, just buy low and hold till high, it's not that hard.

and then you have all these people trying to push to buy puts on them! ha!


Truth is right there.

Good job.

I think part of it is that vaccines take years to develop. Of course everyone has gone all in on it this year but making preannouncments and small samples sizes without peer review with such high efficacy numbers isnt something that usually fares well.

Wait for the review and then see what happens
May you be blessed with sweet sweet tendies good sir
Nobody is ever going to buy that aberration. I sincerely doubt anyone ever bought the stock having seen the car unless they are really dense

Market has gotten so effing expensive since last Monday. These vaccine announcements make everything go retard. Hoping for a realistic retrace.

It means that the people bought a stock when it was expensive and sold it now that its gone down in value. Basically they lost money
47 I think ...
Everyone wondering this since battery day.
I‚Äôm only buying spy calls from now on until they lose me money, no reason to bet against a hand that keeps winning.
The SP is past that now...watch the stock and maybe take profits sometime this week depending on how the stock moves

I don‚Äôt know the calculation on hand, but I use https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com. You can use the ‚Äúmanual entry‚Äù drop down to input IV to see what happens. You can also find the average IV of a stock to get a good idea of where it will drop too. Good practice to use this before hitting buy on anything
jesus
West Chicago... or the West Side?
Wtf is a stock?
Lol dude. How was I proven wrong when you provided no counter evidence? Also this is WSB just relax and allow yourself to enjoy some shit talk.
**Elon has spawned somewhere on the map**
Your best bet for major profit is buying calls on all the stocks that Buffet just invested in. Go all in and be rich.
I will also accept "make a dick grow out of your forehead" I mean, it is DNA we are talking about so anything is possible...
That money is gone!  No way ZM is going up 25% in 11 days, especially with all the positive vaccine news.
This makes me feel deeply uncomfortable even more than an inflated Green Day in the market, shit really terrifies me.
I dno bro the trannies will love that
I haven't looked at the supports yet. Literally every drug ever jumps at big news and then comes down a bit. It doesn't make it indicitive of a pump and dump, which is a specific thing. It's upward progression has continued all year, with obviously peaks and valleys, but that's just normal in my opinion.
Anyone else notice that nio trading volume today was 300m
Yes yes yes yes

Pltr is 16.15 hahahhahahah

I sold a put week ago and would love to close that sumbitch so I can more Nio FD tomorrow morning.
I use IB and currently have margin. The low rates are legit

Customer service sucks though
I have been loading up on BABA last few days now so it better moon. I did it through shares (0 > 200 shares now) since options have too much time risk but now I'm about to do options if it keeps going down.
I‚Äôve said before that it could be anything. But there is definitely some interesting things going on with stripe, whether they are coincidence or not... who knows.

Fairly priced now. Pre-covid had support around current levels. They aren't better or worse off. Good thing their last CEO worked on Disney+ before leaving. Gave them something to survive on during these times.
Gotta be CODX for the biggest gain, probably followed by APT.

They usually have the lowest rates among all brokers. Thats legit. But you also have to pay for realtime data subscription (some of that waived if you trade actively).
Wrong place. Best we can do is help you lose life changing money.
90 and 95% on the two vaccines are pretty wild...  I trust their teams but it's borderline unbelievable like the numbers were somehow fudged but it was still just the first dataset... plenty more to come
NIO price too high imo

Vaccine Stocks always pumps and dumps. Now how much of the pump is it keeping or how much of the dump is continuing is the question here. If that $95 breaks, it will be 80's soon.

No guarantees on the Jan ones, but I think we could see 20+ easily after earnings with guidance.  EPS will be rough, but the quarter happening now could be their best in history.

Today was a massive trend reversal though, and there are a lot of shorts that bought in between 14 and 11 that are probably getting nervous. Best part is that its heavily inst owners now, retail was shaken out hard in the big dump.  Inst won't panic so easily
kang market has wiped out a lot of us.  RKT and TSLA too.
Don't forget to drink water bros, stay hydrated
Today was promising started out ugly and ended 1.1% down. I think it will go back up when there is any neutral or negative news about vaccine distribution issues, politics, new shutdowns by states etc.
Battery system is 100% different, somewhat apples and oranges. I think swappable batteries are worse than recharges tbh. I don't know much about the sub service, but the idea they have better autopilot that FSD beta seems... dubious.
It stands for dick dangling because OP‚Äôs always want a yank and crank after a post.

Tomorrow is another day. I can imagine there being swings all over the place tomorrow so just pick the right time to sell
I bought a nio call at $51 on Friday then $47 call catching the falling knife. Hopefully these print tomorrow

I honestly think in the long run Nio wants to get out of making cars and just sell their technology to other car manufacturers.   Although I would love to see NIOs come to the US

Just temporary in my opinion. The problem is we don‚Äôt know when they‚Äôll finish teaching Ma his lesson. Better to buy shares instead of calls.
Remember at the beginning of COVID when he went on CNBC and literally cried (as in tears) that we were all going to die? I lost all respect for him after that.
Joe's 6 week paid naptime will be bullish
I sold my COST 380C 11/27 calls and for about ~10% profit because the stock wasn't moving much and I didn't want to get theta crushed this week and then they announce a $10 special dividend and the stock rockets after hours.
I think that is where the negative sentiment for Robinhood stems from.  Folks actually working plans with spreads and covered calls need brokerages that don't screw you on big/asks.

NIO is budget tesla. That means it will keep going up until it reaches 420.69 then it replace TESLA and be called NIOLA. Buy calls.

Thank you! Downvote brigade assumes I am bearish on PLTR... hey retards why do you think I own the stock?? I just think the climb is gonna be slow (and maybe flat til near next earnings) so why not make some fat premiums while I wait.

I feel you brah. Panic sold half right at the opening because I thought this bitch gonna get dumped, only to see it hit $45.

I wish I hadn't made other big position moves into LOW and TGT to buy up that dip EOD, still got 10 280c with Friday expiry so hoping for a good pump. Especially since a good HD earnings should translate well for Lowes.

EDIT: Just checked out your play -- very nice. I'd like to see you hit cause that means at least 20k for me.

Nah just stating the obvious
because most would prefer to do a buyback (tax advantages for shareholders) but costco probably realizes their share price is inflated and also wants to avoid the negative press associated with doing a buyback (even though dividend and buyback are effectively the same thing- return of capital to shareholders)

It probably is, they've been mass closing stores for a few years now.  They seriously had way too fucking many and it was destroying their bottom line.  Hoping they close another 500 or so.

Gamestops are super packed atm though, the website is seeing obscene traffic (can be seen by order numbers since they are sequential) and they were the top most searched thing on google for half of last week

When it turns negative you can trade normally as long as overnight margin doesn't go below 0 after doing the trade.  But you just have to hold it overnight. It'll reset overnight though.

Timing the top and bottom of short term trades is possible, I do it all the time but timing the very top or bottom of a big reversal is tough. 

In any case, the market goes up like 80% of the time so seriously, just wait for big drops and buy the dips. Just make sure you have plenty of time (no weeklies).
It‚Äôs moving though
New ATH every day this week.
This is known.

That being said I don't think it is going to go up until the new scheduled FAA window comes through.  Also, the reschedule will also push the real flight that was scheduled in Jan.  So I would either buy stocks now or play a "sort of" long call on SPCE-looking at Feb/March of 2021.

edit: words because I am stupid.
I dropped on Friday from a new ATH and is up like 4% today including AH.

&#x200B;

I think it will have legs tomorrow.
Right?? How ?!
Ah
Dump early tomorrow and double down with Lowes 11/20 calls.
I‚Äôm guessing the average age here is 23. Don‚Äôt think we have too many people above 30.
260*
How? 100k in total or an incremental $100k to reach some goal?
You mad?

I‚Äôve been using mybookie, they kind of come of as sketchy solely because they‚Äôre offshore but they‚Äôve been nothing but good for me. Customer service is on point, deposits and withdrawals are quick. Haven‚Äôt had an issue yet üëçüèæ (I mean they definitely pump the house edge to like 55/45 but I‚Äôve still had a few good sized W‚Äôs)
We're going to have 200k/cases a day in December and 2000+ deaths a day likely

I don't see people flying much
Yeah, I think it might be time to salvage my UVXY insurance and move on. With the way things are going, 11/20 9p‚Äôs are going to print lmao
will they though??
These days some companies are WOKE and focus on stakeholder value
God imagine trying to run a business there
Tell us more.
fuelcell is still cheap!!! gobble that up...
Lol I swear CODX was down like 30% at one point AH. It made its way all the way up. Too bad the 200 I threw in for fun will still be 0 unless it moves up another 15%, which it won't.
Yea I‚Äôm sure he bought $60 leaps when it was $2. Makes lots of sense
not gonna print
I'm 420

Yes keep buying stocks after you have seen them soar, that should work well.

But F is a 30.6b market cap and Nio is 60.7b
you chose now to buy? Why not after earnings if its a good report the gap up won't matter in the long run. But we could easily halve the stock price.
I was way too old to be watching this when it was on, but I did anyways
are nio earnings before open or AH

I've been bullish on Nordstrom for two weeks. I'm playing earnings in hopes for 5k but damn 10k would be so ideal for me.

COST afterhours? what made it move like that?
Don't mean to gloat, but...
Sell before. The iv will be outrageous and nio has had great earnings the last two quarters so I think the upside potential is highly overvalued in the options at the moment

If you bought them last week or the week before you are sitting nice right now as well. Why would be not take a 500% profit??
Yeah its going bonkers alright
Can I trade normally still? Like monthlies etc.?

One time payout is easier to manage fiscally without damaging the balance sheet if you have the cash available. 


Say I save $4m this quarter - I could give that $4m to shareholders as a dividend right now or raise the regular dividend less than $4m expecting some extra additional revenue to come in each quarter. COST doesn't expect the additional revenue to come in each quarter *at this time*, they may soon tho

FUBO 18c 11/20s back from the fucking grave and might even print tmr.  Woah.

Yes, this is going to go up but wouldn't March calls make more sense? We are going to go into lockdown from mid-January until early February and then come out and the numbers will magically go down to zero.

Wish I would have bought more! Up 700% but not enough contracts to really make a difference
Just make sure you didn't do a round trip day trade when it was negative. Otherwise you get a "day trade call" (you can google it if you want to know more details about it). It isn't the same as a margin call but you basically get restricted from day trading for a bit if you can't satisfy it. Its only for margin accounts, which you must have to have all those values. Otherwise it resets the next day and as long as overnight margin > 0, you are fine for carrying positions overnight.

That much is known. You realize reverse mergers are not the less desirable stocks. The company they merge into gets a deal on the stock.  No unicorn is going to go the SPAQ route.

Also how does Affirmative Action fuel racism? If affirmative actions causes you to be racist, then surprise surprise, you were already racist. Does affirmative action for women (mostly white women) fuel misogyny? What about legacy admissions (mostly for rich white kids), does that also fuel hatred & jealousy for these kids? Curious how those other affirmative admissions never come up.

ye but why a special dividend over just raising the normal dividend

If you look closer, the market response was more closely tied to the senate balance. Markets had mostly priced in a Biden victory already when the polls indicated double digit leads. A gridlocked congress is the ideal scenario for the market.

Right before earnings too, I bet this shit moons too stressful for me to play though. Good luck
Trading NIO should come with a danger warning - not for the faint of heart
It‚Äôs slowly rolling out
Yep that extra $10-$20 per contract is often the difference between getting paid and watching it expire worthless.

Options with less than $1000 is playing on the most difficult setting.  It‚Äôs super satisfying when shit that is a couple strikes out hit but it‚Äôs also not super common for most tickers.
Buy high sell low

* Huge Short Positions against GME, potential for Short Squeeze, shorts are over 100% of outstanding stock

What happened to COST? üòç
Okay, I know we are all autistic here and hate money‚Äî But come on. The valuation of NIO is so high at this point that if earnings are any but phenomenal we are all fucked. Honestly I would have sold today at close if it weren‚Äôt for PDT.

WMT gap up or down after earnings?
gay bears are going to bleed
I heard it was tomorrow though
another way (the one I took)  
a) go to good college  
b) major in STEM  
c) get job in tech  
d) make 200k+  
e) invest at least 70k a year

I definitely agree that praying for market luck is not a good idea. You need to have some money to reliably make money in the market. By far the most profitable thing I've ever done long term is just buy 100 GOOGL's and sell covered calls on them, that takes quite a bit of capital to start doing.

Shorting VOD, only up 50 cents after their earnings and this was suppose to be the make or break? Company has been just accumulating debt and lost business during quarantine. Cheap bet, nothing definitive 

LNTH long call, this use to be a penny stock gamble but now we‚Äôre working with EPS and they have actual value now that the AI bone scans just got approved.
Did you even bother to look at AH? I‚Äôm just going to hold it cause it was only 300 when I bought it but fuck that put a damper on my day.
Finally? It‚Äôs been like 8 hours market time. How bad is your ADD. The reaction isn‚Äôt done yet. This was a bull trap
Anybody know where we are gapping up to?
GME closed over 12 today despite a short attack EOD.  The stars are aligning again.  Props to everyone with long calls/shares that held through the noise.  New guys, you will lose your ass on this if you go deep on short dated calls or you have paper hands.

Buying mutual funds, index funds, opening retirement investment accounts, etc. absolutely is not gambling though and it's a bad example to set for his younger impressionable viewers who should be making educated moves with their money. hasMods

Number one thing I've learned is that you're better off holding a good quality option til half off and then selling it then you are buying a half off option and holding it to expiry. You'll lose just as much money but your probability of success is much higher with the first one.
That was just the announcement for the split, nothing else.

Costco holders getting a pump from a $10 special dividend. Basically adding $10 to the stock.
Ya unfortunately what this really shows is a clear pattern of serious retardation and only by a miracle did you gain it back. 100% you should quit or you will definitely lose it all. But again given the clear pattern of retardation there is a 0% chance you will quit and so I can say with a high degree of certainty that this account will soon be worthless.

Everyone looks at historical data and doesn't realize that all that data is based off a market that had only 5% (and that's being very generous) of the investors and those investors never had instant access to the market unless they were at a terminal. 

Think about investing in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s. Do you really think people were going to walk to the kitchen, pick up the land line, fight to untangle the cord that can reach halfway across the house, dial up their bank, go through the desk clerk, and finally get to their broker to tell him that they wanted some FDs? Fuck no, retail investors bought shares and leaps. Anyone who traded for a living had access to a terminal. 

Now look at it. Everyone and their fucking mom is an investor. It's nothing more than a game you can download on your phone. On top of the most accessible market in history, we have a global pandemic. This is creating more and more variables and volatility than has ever been seen. Put your historical data on a 3.5 floppy, that's how much you're going to use it, because *that market doesn't exist anymore*.

TL;DR: EV calls. Throw a fucking dart at a board of EV companies and just buy calls.
It is. And it was green until the first vac rumours came up today. Not sure if it was actual beginning of recovery until then. Might fall more short term because some people (who lived under a rock in the last 15 years) believe vaccinations would suddenly make Alibaba or Amazon irrelevant.

Double downed and bought more BABA 2/19/21 $290c today thanks to your DD. I love the risk to reward ratio on this trade and planning on buying some shares as well in my IRA once my cash settles. 

BABA at $258 is at the bottom of an expanding wedge pattern on daily chart, so we are seeing less experienced downward momentum traders hitting more experienced value buyers, and at -20% I think the momentum traders are giving up soon as share holders generally are not that interested in selling at -20% of highs without a disastrous news catalyst (which I don't think BABA has, let me know if anyone sees one though). 

I saw an unusually large $200 million buy order go through on Friday as well at $260, the whales are here. This trade is looking very good so far. Biden coming into office on Jan 20th also a great booster for chinese stocks as biden is expected to lower chinese tariffs.

Tomorrow you‚Äôll have .12 shares of viatris for every 1 share of Pfizer that you own. Pfizer will have no problem selling every dose they make. Production speed is going to be the limiting factor. The price will go up when they get approval. Moderna‚Äôs will probably go up even more because they are a smaller company and they don‚Äôt have to share profits with another company. Either play is good, but you‚Äôll probably make more with Moderna.

Look at its weekly. I‚Äôd wait for one Green Day first
Didn't you get the memo? Stonks only go up
Wouldn't exactly call it a scam but I up voted you
It destroyed earnings, should go up bigly this week
that‚Äôs what I just said
You can't buy CBAT calls...
Ahh ok you right. I was replying to another post and got carried away. Good looks
Uvxy 20 tomorrow
Hold. It's up +2.11% aftermarket.
All of this is true, but is it not already priced in? And would the CCP really torpedo one of China's own top companies? Seems hard to believe.
Anyone wanna do me a solid an make me feel not so bad about holding these $25 plug calls ? Current prices have me opening - 78% on them tomorrow.
The type of guy who‚Äôs been shorting $SPY since the end of March.
I wanna go on a cruise
Spy puts it is. Thanks for the tip.
Was it a 100p? If so, good job. If not, sorry for your loss
That's just a scam company. But have fun throwing your money into the fire anyway

Largest us pension just bought zm, Nikolai, nio
they prolly arent dood, sell covered calls mayne not that hard, this will be an expensive stock soon
Sometimes a high wall, is just a wall  
Sometimes it's only there to make sure you feel small  
Or may be there to save you from the depths of a much deeper fall 

*-Dedicated to all the* ***NIO YOLO*** *holders-*
RIP plug whyyyyyyyy I was doing so good üò§ü•∫
haha, I'm pretty much a noob too my friend. The only reason why I seem to know some stuff is that I lost money to IV crush plenty of times and am trying to educate myself to prevent future mistakes. 

As for NIO tomorrow, I ended up deciding to hold just because I was around for last week's ridiculous run and know the NIO will move (at least prior to earnings). If you want to enter join the action tomorrow (regardless of call or put), I strongly suggest selling prior to earnings. NIO is a pure hype machine right now and you don't want to be caught when the music stops. 

Don't worry about missed opportunities, there will always be something else around the corner.
Why Rapid 7 over Splunk or Tenable?
3pm cutoff apparently so they miss out on the EOD fun. Like a 0dte 361c that went from 0.48 to 1.50-1.60 in about 3min
That would be nice.
Good luck. Biggest asian trade deal just happened. NIO projected to do 100k cars in 2021, earning will beat. They will probably announce they are expanding to other markets. And you think it'll be $39 why?
ITs OnLy uP 2% ü•¥
Nah. The guy hides. Bottom line

Look it's not hard.  


Stonks go up.   


So buy calls.
No on TLT. The Fed indicated that interest rates are as at rock-bottom.
What?
PLUG buying opportunity
NIO
true, but many people live 30k in non mortgage debt just paying bills, not many people are invested, or they contribute pennies, or only a 401k they cant draw from is all they can afford, and honestly when a family cost several thou a month to care for, any gains a person may make would be shadowed by cost of living. 

people need stimulus regardless even if the market 3x itself to 90k. only a few would be in terrific shape from that.

theta gang wins again
I'm mostly guessing, but I'm pretty sure he's still campaigning and hasn't conceded because it allows him to ask for donations to his campaign. I get his emails and he's been asking for money just as often as he did before the election.

I can only guess why he needs more money, probably so the campaign can repay debts, such as loans from the Trump Organization and back payments from the campaign to places like Trump Hotel and Mar A Lago.
I mean yea, this is likely true
Price will go down during Wednesday Pre market probably, so if you are using RH smart play would probably be to sell before close Tuesday (tomorrow)

Nothing.  You are all over it after checking the ticker.  My negativity on betting against them is I've seen what kind of money their stores do.  They print money.  One near me does like 10 million a year. Also my tickers that actually make money have been trending up.
Everyone who talked mad shit about the new admin crashing the market should be obligated to buy puts now

Hydrogen production is not clean at all.  The majority of it is produced by processing methane gas (fossil).  Otherwise, you can generate H2 and 02 by performing electrolysis on water.  But this is only as clean as your electricity source, just like charging an electric car.

Wait everyone said to buy, who are you listening to?
wait till it hits 38.4 again then sell 

never accept small losses
OK. Does this mean I buy harder or what
are you autistic?

Anyone know what time the CRSR interview will be on Mad Money?
Sold shit 5 minutes before that happened, was getting a weird feeling since it had some retard strength. Every single small dip was eaten up, a few times it got beyond control and those were those huge plunges. Quickly corrected though. Fishy fishy. Very low volume too.
Gotcha, yeah I‚Äôm just assuming it‚Äôll sell off now especially since they still have to wait a couple weeks for Emergency Use approval
I bought NIO puts today. If it doesn't dump tomorrow I'm fooked lol
This is what they wanted, for people to sell low!
In all seriousness no, he had a parachute on, was planning on letting go either way after he did the stunt
Yikes
Lol why y‚Äôall shutting down the Nio bulls let them have their fun. Did Citron really make all of you buy puts?
My dick is half solid after reading that.
Teeth are unnecessary in the age of the mask. We smile with our eyes now
I agree. The intention is good but the result is not. If we're talking about affirmative action, by making it easier for black people to get into colleges, that's assuming that being black is a disadvantage or a liability or some kind of handicap. There are social programs to help people with disabilities, for example if you're dyslexic, then you get more time on your standardized tests. That's a real condition. But you give similar preferential treatment to black people, then it's like saying being black is a handicap.
Lol that‚Äôs wild.
Hopefully. :D

I'll take your word on it. Then my 20c 3/19/21 are safe... I think
Why lol? They are at the top of a quad top on the 3 month chart, they have a likely proxy fight coming up cuz their biggest investor is pissed that nobody on the board knows how to run a restaurant company and they fucked up an acquisition recently, rona‚Äôs comin hard this winter and a vaccine isnt gonna change anything for months. What am I missing?
Dam they teach you about inflation and how spy basically no matter what will go up? Calm down it‚Äôll always grow until we blow it all up one day
I actually bailed on mine AH; that green candle was just too bullish and then the 65k spy calls bought earlier. 

quick 20% loss
Nice! How many?
Under normal circumstances I would 100% agree with you, the hang up is that 2020 has been anything but normal.  Nothing surprises me now.
Bro stop listening to people on this sub lol
maybe, but by very small magnitudes - the payout is still the same and the associated downside risk with the two trades is similar.

What happened to plug AH?
Shares is the safer play

Turn that into a covered call once it gets assigned is the way to go
I see it being close to $180 in a year
When does BIDU report??
something like SQQQ or SPXS.  It's an ETF that is short instead of long, meaning if the standard ETF's go down, these go up.

NCLH up 6% today. Who's got puts for tomorrow?
Glad I held the 45 nio calls üòÇ definitely selling tomorrow tho... But what if they go to 100 after earnings? I'll rope
I mean some of the kids are doing alright
Market gonna melt up over the next 4 weeks at least. SPY calls free money
So what kinda move would be needed to profit from NIO options if you hold through ER? Like 15%+?
I believe I can't receive buying power from an AH deposit into webull, so hopefully this prevented me from picking up stock at +200% and it tanking lol
It only went up 3$ because their huge , this would be such a small percent of their business
Zoom is not going anywhere. It‚Äôs here to stay.

sadly i mean 1/20 when Biden takes office and our super corrupt and negligent fed is out.   but it could happen any time.
He who lives retarded, dies retarded, but is resurrected in retardation again
Fun fact, if you put in your initial $58,375 when this was worth $100, you'd have $38,249,804.30.
Our markets now operate 100% on liquidity and stimulus. Take those artificial drivers away and let the markets correctly price in risk and we're 50% lower. COVID recovery 100% priced in now. Stock returns over the coming 10 years expected to be 0. Yes, ZERO. We've pulled everything forward and robbed our kids.
Doesn‚Äôt mean shit with that In crush, minimal tendies for all the retards that bought yesterday and today...even if it does smash ER

Retards buying NIO with 200+ IV.  Going to make like $20 after it goes to 100.  So shut the fuuuuuuck uuuuuup.
Buy at open, sell 30 minutes later. Wait for the dip then buy again and sell at close.
se Ltd gonna moon tomorrow
Dude your calls lost like 70% in value. It's ok buddy. It happens.
buy shares
Spy puts
How much of this sub is holding NIO calls? 5,000 people? 0.3% of the sub?
AFAIK the very initial motivation is that hydrogen is, at its pure form, the cleanest energy of all. H2+02=H20. The current-day EV technology still produces lots and lots of pollution in both making the car and providing charging. 

The ultimate about hydrogen is that, even if supply is figured out one day for household usage, hydrogen itself remains highly highly combustible and dangerous. Not sure if I'd want my hypothetical 2.5s supercar to carry loads of that around on the highway
Man I have been waiting since the IPO to get into U and it just keeps going higher and higher. Really hoping for a big red tech day so I can jump in before it resumes course.
Up 10p pre market
Yeah this is a very weird reaction by the market to needing cash to fuel growth
SDC fucks call holders on earnings every time.  Even when they are good.
Opening at 50 would be nuts bro
Pfizer vaccine 90% protection against COVID

Moderna vaccine 94.5% protection against COVID

Fed vaccine 100% protection against corrections
NIO makes people rich and happy
Rigged
No, its actually not.
I mean it‚Äôs just a theory. Both are good plays, but I read an article that Pfizer is going to have a hard time transporting it. I had a call option and sold it for $8 gains lol, so either I‚Äôm a fool or I just got out with a positive.
It was pushing 17 last night and then fell off the earth

Nothing I said is racist or offensive to anyone. I'm confused and curious why you think that.  You're probably white and uncomfortable talking about racial issues but I'm not and I'm able to logically take myself out and see why there is misunderstanding between the two racial groups in America. If none of what I said gets through, then here is the key point: **Black people want to be treated equally. Equality goes both ways. Giving them extra benefits begets hatred and jealousy and fuels racism. Shit like affirmative action constantly reminds them that they're not being treated equally.**
Hopefully a mutual destruction so they both shut the fuck up

it already did from 10 to 15...

I didn't even know it had another name till now.
Have you tried turning the app off and back on again?
So glad I sold most of my calls this afternoon.  Definitely a -3 day incoming.
Why is this a bad thing?
Your dad is a fucking idiot
Yeah, if you are the one selling them.
Gotta admit, this shit is extremely volatile tho, I just hope the offering doesn‚Äôt kill volatility like split killer Tesla.
anyone in WMT 160c 11/20?
Yeah I hope lmfaooooo
care to explain
MU is either gonna take me to tendie land tomorrow or absolutely fuck me

Going to explode tomorrow
This thing will either moon forever or eventually have the most incredible rug pull ever
I hope not...   Just picked up 11/20 $20 calls today
I am now a tranny
I bought them at .15 sold today at .40. Thanks.
Good job, good sir.

My puts are fuk. At least I won't be tempted to buy puts again for a few months. That's kind of a win I guess ü§°

I sold a 11/20 70p last friday. Don't mind getting assigned

I would disagree on the chance of profit part. Selling a call reduces the break even point making it easier to profit.

Ah I see, thank you! That being said, would buying a put and a call on NIO tomorrow at some point be a good play? you seem to know much more than I and I'm just trying to make a quick buck by being a retard lol. Back in early June I went from 10k to 30k (beginners luck) and now I'm at like 7k trying to chase back to 20k playing with options lol, im for sure stupid but im just trying to get lucky

Imo yes. I just read that the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at -70 Celsius. Which is going to make distribution extremely difficult. Where as the Moderna only has to be refrigerated. Just my opinion.
Couldn‚Äôt you say it‚Äôs already priced in then?
why not PLTR go parabolic?
u/savethisvideo
are ya winning, son ?
it was down 5% this morning and then closed 1% up.
I'm still hedged with $200 worth of 11/18p $350.  Figure that's an acceptable loss if my calls are printing.
Oof
Man FSR was such a bore today, it did not want to move up today
What are some good naked calls under $100? 

I need help going full retard

Oh 100%. Anyone Long is fine. It just needed to calm down though and I knew it was coming
Absolutely he will, they actually took US government funds from Operation Warp Speed
I'm not sure how long you napped today, but PM this morning was at one point -8%. Not sure where you got your plus-five
Have you not been reading this sub? Chinese EV calls bro

Yea I can see this happening - I bought up some 1/15 calls though based on the activity today

MDMA
Bullish on real estate I‚Äôm guessing?
Not saying to sell NIO.  Hold NIO and supplement with PLTR
Bro you could hold this for the next 15-30 years. As long as fundamentally nothing negative happens to nio. You would make an absolute killing. Now if you want some of that capital to trade. I‚Äôd say take a portion in profit tomorrow during the earnings run up.
Does anyone has any idea how sqgb pulled that massive beat? I don‚Äôt remember seen anything like that lol
BILI, PDD, SPY calls most recently. I honestly don't remember what I held during the lowest point and I don't want to find out.
it might but it also might not
Eat my dick
CBAT is worth a yolo
racist ranting? Did you read all of what I wrote? Are you seeing the word "black" and you just label it racist?  
I'm confused where you're coming from. You're probably white and uncomfortable talking about racial issues but I'm not and I'm able to logically take myself out and see why there is misunderstanding between the two racial groups in America. If none of what I said gets through, then here is the key point: **Black people want to be treated equally. Equality goes both ways. Giving them extra benefits begets hatred and jealousy and fuels racism. Shit like affirmative action constantly reminds them that they're not being treated equally.** 

The source is CNBC article titled "what Biden's student forgiveness means for everyone".
That's a good sign since we now know more and more WSBs are now in this together.

Lost almost $30K the last few days....for shits sake. Anyone got a good play?
China announced they won't build any more gas powered car factories. Nio 1000 2030.
Yea I know that why I said my opinion is probably wrong and it‚Äôs shitty dd because drawing on charts with crayons does nothing but make me feel less retarded about my trades
between now and 1/20.
Is that what typically happens after public offering? If rebounds?
You can't win and serve though. I would love for him still to campaign, 10% of Republican voters to write him in, and those votes get thrown out because he is a currently incarcerated felon.
Yes I for one am definitely going to abandon technology altogether  as soon as a vaccine is approved.

I saw someone mention it. Bought 25 shares at 5.49 just because wsb told me to. 

Really wishing I did more of that and less of stupid.
For the streets
Imagine thinking NIO would hit $25 because of some lemon analyst
Yeah I find it hard to get into cause of this.
WHY IS PLUG TANKING??

I keep waiting for the right time to buy puts on IWM.   But then I keep buying calls on other things.
Let me know if you need any help bro üòé
The market is out of control, they say the Kraken is real. Is It possible for Trump to really overturn this and this incredible move in the market is in anticipation for a huge crash since we know wall st did not another 4 of Trump?
So who actually bought plug shares here?
NIO should be 70 EOW to make back what gay bear Left pulled away.
CBAT ended 83% up today. And it's trading 4% after hours. I was going to buy in but thought it went up to fast and chickened out. I regret it but oh well, I'll see how it is after ER and make my decision there.
yea
Look I‚Äôve got NIO calls too. But y‚Äôall need to understand this is not ‚Äúparabolic AH‚Äù

RIP the SDC bulls who were dancing.... say hello to IV crush
0-60 in 8.9 seconds vs 3.1 seconds for similarly priced Model 3.  And instead of refueling at home or literally anywhere, you have to find far-flung hydrogen stations and pay through the nose.  And forget about road trips.  I don't understand anyone in the right mind who would go this route.
Already ahead of you buddy

Got a 1/22 150c leap now up 110%

I have a 30 day stock hold restriction, otherwise I would be accumulating SO many shares
End of day volume on SPY, we gapping up again tonight...
Yup. Gotta happen or I am fuk

Exactly as u/Tacojoe18 said. I had options that went to a few cents a contract. I held and they eventually became higher, and recently a lot higher.
NIO ripping AH

You think there's a chance no stimulus is passed within the next 2 months?
You should‚Äôve done it during market hours. Now you have to wait until tomorrow.
NIO ending at 54 eow would be amazing
1% from my ATH. It‚Äôs been eluding me since September to hang on to it, in sight four times already. It is my white whale.
Who else is just waiting for a big rug pull ?
What are the chances we have 2 vaccines when they said it would take years if ever
Da fuck did I tell you?  NIO close at 45 & moooon after hours.  I predict we open at 50 tomorrow but after that it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess, will probably sell at open.
Cool, thanks for the info!

I care, dipshit.
Ya never know, if your up an amount you feel comfortable with, sell it ASAP, this is what I would consider a high risk trade
I still think Donkey Kong every time I see this ticker.

Pretty good
NIO up biggly AH
Rug pull tomorrow or what?
When NIO pops the loss porn is going to be glorious

When i say the price will plummet, I mean the option price, not the stock price (commonly referred to as the underlying).  It's a bit hard for me to properly explain why it happens, but fortunately there are plenty of resources available online.

In Cali, pretty much the only state where hydrogen stations are available, the 60k Toyota Mirai I heard is pretty dope. But once again, widespread, practical application is years if not decades away and the car's performance can't measure up with top EVs. Charging cost is out of the world obviously. 

The two plus sides are range and quietness.
NIO MOOOOOOOOOONNINGGGGGGGG
Sob
Prob  next week
Lmao sums up most peoples thoughts on hydrogen. Here's the deal. Hydrogen was expensive and dangerous. There was a hydrogen boom in the 2000's because "HOLY FUCK WE CAN DRIVE CARS OFF WATER" but no one understood how the tech worked and its fucking hydrogen it goes boom boom. However there have been a lot of advancements in hydrogen safety and affordability making it a very promising fuel choice for heavy machinery and trucking considering the fact a bulldozer and semi probably can't run off of a battery for too long and since construction lasts long enough as is, we can't be charging the bulldozers and cranes and whatever else 50% of the time they are in use. With the new bills coming into play hoping for a "green USA" by 2025 or whatever the fuck, companies are getting rid of diesel and gas. Prime example is Cummins. Worlds largest manufacturer of industrial engines and machinery. They bought a hydrogen company stationed in Ontario called Hydrogenics and have pledged to go fully green.
Wow, and now my money ship's sinking...
This a gut instinct? Or any new news come out?
Just go back to doing paper trading. You are not good at this.

had was one of my first nice gains in may, this earnings may be big for them, the other two have dropped due to 1st, COVID logistics issues, then compensation to their workers. Which IMO is good news. This earnings should be nice

HAHAHAHA. I know the pain. I freaked out and closed 2 Put positions I had @ $149... Had I let it execute, I would've been up  like crazy (around 9k)
I just expected a small pullback after a bigly run...
Damn.
Nice gains. Why did you buy?
Hoping SPCE starts a reversal like I think or at least doesn't completely shit the bed
Buying Alaska Airlines calls its a sign from the gods
RIP Plug call holders
this is the DD i m here for
0% interested in hearing anything you have to say numb nuts.
nice, cant wait to turn 18 and become a gay bear
Ne-yo
lol
I‚Äôm still holding calls so it‚Äôs going to stay red,
Whoops thats the european company. I meant Air Products
Is it though?
3x 11/27 $17p and
2x 11/27 $16.5p
Shouldn't have confirm.
TSNP.

Blown up the last week or so.  My brother harped on it when it was .0006.  Now it's almost .03.  Don't really know why or exactly what the company does.  Seems like they might have lined up some legit partners/opportunities, but I'm no expert.  He follows one of their reps on Twitter who keeps tweeting out big news and hype for more this week.  

Will it pan out?  Maybe?  Hard to believe it's going to keep exploding the way it has, but I'm an idiot, so who knows?  If it does, I will be sour and my brother will be rich.  I dumped like $130 into it Friday and first thing this morning.  Wish I'd dumped my life savings.  Feels like if I invest more, it'll plunge though.  haha.

In conclusion, random penny stock taking my brother to the promised land, maybe?

Sir, you forgot your Sarcasm tag.
They decided to sell 750M common stock.

Rip 25c 12/24
Baba pump when?!!!!
How do you see the options that are bought/exercised on a given stock?
Yep that was a good call from me, do you know why they going up so much
I wonder how the market will react to that?
Good work! Blessed move
Sold my calls before close.  Was up pretty big on XOM, TOT, and WMT and am now waiting for the post vaccine dip to buy back in.

bro what is wrong with y‚Äôall have you never seen the sellers log off early EOD? That pump means nothing haha
PLUG is having another public offering. That‚Äôs why it tanked
Don't. I bought SNE before. They are too blue-chip, too boomer, too diversified and too Japanese of a company to trigger rapid increases in prices.

Buying SPY is more fun than SNE.
I was told you can cash in 3 whoopsies per quarter with RH and get your money back. Can anyone confirm?
if you deposit 25k then yeah itll happen early
Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll have a pretty sweet ride until we hold the Boomer‚Äôs bags in ‚Äò23.
Tard‚Äô strength üí™üèª
Care to elaborate? I'm doing DD on the company and am wondering what red flags you see. So far, I'm see nothing atypical for a typical young company, but could be missing something. Not looking to troll you, but would genuinely love to know since I'm bullish on this one
Never bet against those biscuits and chicken fried steak my friend.
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be that much maybe a 1k gain
He called spy would pump just like half the people in this sub

Probably true but I know royal caribbean has 1,000 volunteers for their safe cruising trial so it make offset a big pullback with more positive news but where more cities are locking down and hurting everyone, I'd expect a nice pullback too.

Hopefully by this weekend we can all pool our sweet tendies and buy our own boat, I hear their selling cheap these days
Hope you took the play. It opened flat and then peaked at +13.65% before finishing at +7.59%.

Damn if I didn‚Äôt lose all my money, I would give this gold.
to be fair, it's a good bet considering he just slid another judge into the SC.  Rolling the dice on them looking the other way and changing precedent isn't as crazy as it would seem years ago.
So glad I sold my puts and went all in 11.20 380 calls I‚Äôm about to retire tomorrow
They keep scooping up big $ contracts. First real case study saved a drilling company $1b over the course of a year.
I've seen how they are being integrated into LE, GOVT, and MIL first hand.
I dunno about going to the moon, but I definitely see the stratosphere lol
If NIO can break through 46, sky's the limit

Went from up 10% w two min left to close and now down 40% now lol
So plug 19$ tomorrow?
Huh?
great suggestion, but I'm implying (1.) I either do not see another 2 sigma move to the upside (right side of the distribution) on a vaccine announcement (2.) or I think the market makers have overpriced the range (size of the distribution) of risk and I see it lower (smaller) over the next two weeks. Could build a story on either one of these two etc.

Trump lame ducking is not factored in.  Gonna make stimulus way harder until BIden
Which of these is least fucked?

* BA 11/20 190p
* GME 11/20 11.5p
* SPY 1/15/21 400c
UNPLUG THE COUNT
you got to add in inflation but yes your about right.
Very funny SPY, very funny
team work makes the dream work, if you could drop a like on my youtube video it would really help me out

DKNG ABSOLUTLEY MOONING TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE 72HRS AGO!
There's one scheduled before market open every Monday until Jan 20th.
Dkng given $100 PT by Hearing Group Capital. Whoever TF they are..
I should be able to file charges for the assault and robbery that was committed on my account today
Plug is Cashing in
You don't need to pull out of girls butts either genius. It's not a gay exclusive on anal sex.
I am so ready
[removed]
Laughing as the retard who bought a NIO weekly from me gets IV crushed
What happened to plug?
I'm either going to sell my NIO calls too early, reload at HOD, and end up in a worse position... or I'm going too hold them too long, miss the HOD, and end up in a worse position. Either way, I will end up in worse position tomorrow.
BABAAAAAA
Is it going to tank tomorrow? I need it to.
TSLA has been severely underperforming nearly every session lately
Someone just pulled the plug on PLUG
What is happening
You came back from $100 cliff? Nice brother!! Congrats
Man if I can get rid of these DKNG bags I promise to never fuck around with it again lol. Please
Believe.
Public offering. Try using google you autistic fuck
It‚Äôs rock hard get yah facts straight
Do you want to nuke a city?
I did the same, I took the little profit i was able to make after FOMOing in. Once there is a price correction I'll get in as this EV brand has potential.
this happened last month btw^
How is IWM at ATH on the day that California announces lockdowns?
lol you wish! From $100 to $65k! Proof or ban!
LOL damn bro you lucky u survived the onslaught of the bears
Spy puts is the play
The birth of Christ is up there with one of the most important dates in human history. 

A close second behind NIOs ER tomorrow.
Gap up over night so i can sell my calls at open then but puts for a day trade. 

It‚Äôs too easy so it won‚Äôt work.
That‚Äôs the fucking attitude.  Just take my money and make me rich PLTR
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I'll love ya, tomorrow. You're only a day away!
DKNG news??
You must be new around here
wtf happened to PLUG?
I had plug calls...pray for me
So the end of day pump was definitely legal, I guess they are taking advantage of the SEC chair resigning
I hear Amazon is gonna be a great company. They sell books
Shares offering
Dumb af
The more lockdowns and infected people, the better companies perform!
Which one?
The ticker used to be banned I think. In theory it should keep running, market cap is only 750m atm, I think they are worth billions.
The way I see it the fed created 4 trillion out of thin air so we're still at Spy 220. Only buying calls
Congratulations u/King-of-Plebs you are first. üëë
IDK i think this dip will have more strength behind it than the last two... Hopefully it does i love a good sale
SPY last minute with the big fuck you to my puts
Imagine not exiting PLUG after it ran up 60% in like 2 weeks LMAO

Gef fucked piggies
[deleted]
Maybe its because you're a lame dog and not bull. No bull can fit in that shit
I‚Äôd like a drug test please
Agreed! My day went soo well, then I lost a ton in after-hours because of this!
[removed]
Former investor.. don‚Äôt do it man
Username and flair check out
Amazing positions
nice action on the close spy you really helped my puts out big time. big thanks!
That poor bid gets fucking slapped around AM
My wishlist:
1. Baba go up 
2. ZM go up
3. TSLA go up
4. Spy go down
[deleted]
I don't even remember my original logic for buying other than "Biden wins = clean energy" and everything I've read about FCEL makes them seem like a garbage tier company that just so happens to reside in an untapped market, so I don't have a reason to stay in.

$41C 11/20... let‚Äôs go ER

Should‚Äôve enabled 2FA
I think its going to double on earnings and inflation
huh?
2ndry offering
They issued $750M common stock
Plug funds not safu
Profit was last friday and tomorrow
It's gonna be pretty funny when that NVDA 570c I bought at the top actually goes green again
[removed]
Nio pp hard
Linde, AirLiquide?
Of course
Looks to me like NQ is preparing for a nutty pop tomorrow.
Feels like a rollercoaster with broken seatbelts.
Oh dear god. Rh users getting 0dte? Some will print bigly, many will lose bigly and quite quickly.

FSR pls
SDC with the world's biggest head fake.
I have PLUG calls and SDC puts. fuck me sideways
Comment your top penny growth stocks ~ I‚Äôm Tryna find the needle in the haystack
You‚Äôre a good lad
ü§£ü§£ü§£
It fucked me today
Don‚Äôt jink it bro
If you're not in retail and boomer stocks you're missing the trend. "Sales down less than expected return customers up as they see us as a destination spot" will be every er. Itm near the money calls print till next week
Fuckk earnings
SBE still looking cheap imo
Why is that line vertical now
Oof scooping some calls on PLUG now tomorrow that‚Äôs ez money
Noob.
Probably easier to just call (855) 849-2491.
Why is plug taking a shit god damn all that progress lost
Are you serious?
Why did I buy puts again. The last time I bought puts I swore to never buy puts again. I let myself down. We hold this truth to be self evident, that stonks only go up
Was up nicely on weekly PLUG calls...  Guh!!!
Is FSR a buy
$NIO open 55
Not a bear but im too much of a pussy to risk thru earnings after that rise... looking good for bulls so far though
I need the magic number next to the ticker to go up alot by the end of the week. I don't care what the stock does in the next few years, or even in the next quarter. I just don't see 5000 deliveries a month driving this thing up on another insane rally this week.
We dont give two shits about how technology works, because all we care about is getting fucking rich.
I lost $100 today. I think I can live with that. Most Mondays I blow up half my account and all my day trades and have to work the rest of the week trying to claw my way back
I saw that too
This is what happens when unprofitable companies go meme. They ask for more money at their high share price
[deleted]
Why did PLUG just drop 9% ah?!
Holding ba, ge and pltr calls overnight
Sit back, relax, and watch WSB successfully shill a stock that actually makes everyone rich. History is about to be made boys.

Alhamdulillah

PULL THE PLUG
PLUGoo makes you Broku
I‚Äôm just hope it goes well. I‚Äôm knee deep in calls for 11/20. Gonna be completely fucked if it goes south. Which I highly doubt. And I got a $280 HD call for this week also that has already gave me a small gain.
[deleted]
You are fuckin retarded
Anyone know what time the daily corona numbers get updated?
LOW TGT and ofc NIO tomorrow, NVDA and WDAY also for later in the week
Offering apparently
I stopped trading penny stocks due to stupid after hours public offerings. I guess any company will do it.
Why? Because of the lockdown?

Well I‚Äôm balls deep in spy puts so enjoy the hulk dick tomorrow
Anyone else holding onto their NIO thru earnings?

What‚Äôs up with DKNG ?
Pumping PLTR and creating memes until the day we die.

PLTR is Citron proof
Hey man i was looking at kandi from like 7 days ago but didn't seem like much attention or anything interesting
I'm in an absolute tangle of spreads right now. I'm not really even sure what my profit will look like if NIO heads to 50.
BRO SAME. Just not that last part
WTF HAPPENED TO PLUG?! I DEMAND A WITCHHUNT AND A SALEM TRIAL!!
SOLO opinion?
FAILLL
No I am too greedy.
Bruh I bought today randomly lesgettttit
750k share offering
Today was fun I made money
Solid price on those warranta
I need a cigarette after today holy shit
So who else enjoyed getting fisted by that last chance DPY pump
Shorts covering
PLUG$ GET FUCKED !!!!!!!

ceo CASHING IN BABY YEAH
That‚Äôs a solid return. I‚Äôll probably sell half tomorrow and diamond hand the rest. Gl on your Walmart calls.
If you adjust for the election panic, this matches 9/2 perfectly.
Berkshire closed at ATH. Might buy them 03/2021 250C.

They just bought a bunch of ABBV too. hmmm
I have a few shares already and it is on sale right now,  really interested here
My broke ass is in for 100 shares
Bless that guy.
Just stick to your thesis... bulls get paid, bears get paid (eventually), pigs get slaughtered. I‚Äôve lost a lot of $ being a pig
Is se tmrw ah
Thank you! :) I got both side, so hopefully I win one way because it should cover any lose
VXX is dead and now I want to be
Wtf CBAT is insane why didn‚Äôt we head about this this befofe?


Any chance it keeps running
Correct me if I'm wrong:

USD today is worth ~8% less than on February 19th, meaning that SPY 366 today is roughly equivalent to SPY 338 in Feb....
I mean, it's the other afterhours market
What happened to PLUG?
PLUG was not a good play EOD
In my eyes the stock survived hitting 50 cents and has bounced back pretty good considering, heading into a hydrogen market (IMO), I only see the stock going up in next weeks/ months. Could def buy at next dip if you wanted to, I'm sure there will be one considering the +23% today.
They pulled the *PLUG*

^(I accept my ban)
Pepe hands on NIO calls. Anyone sold today  bc earnings tmrw
I'm up $180 today on a garbage penny stock.  Person who told me about it is up $45k today.  So much regret for not believing.
I'm  sorry but in a place where being retarded is the norm you dont get a parking pass for your disability.
Finally MM killed the bears. WSB officially bullish af. Market goes parabolic for a few days. I‚Äôve seen this before.
I second this WTF happened?
My mind is tellin me no, but my body, my body is tellin me yes
Poor GAN.  Only stock I own amongst a shit ton of decaying pooooots.  Can‚Äôt catch a break.
Good luck
Ill lose $2000 this week of NIO doesnt hit 50-57
Well no cuz I‚Äôm only in nio right now. Why would I mention others?
SPY fucking me sideways again what was that EOD pump
Mb thought this was daily thread
Welp I was gonna buy sdc and decided to play a different Er please don‚Äôt fuck me
<Chuckles>

My covered calls are in danger (after that EOD pump)
CCL puts are life
I'm balls deep in NIO calls and holding through earnings
It's not because of vaccines but diamon hand scalpers. Big money pump up the price pre market to $17. Scalpers sell at open knowing they have already earned loads of profits and crash it to $15, then proceed to rebuy it and rally upwards. They have done the same thing 3 times already.
üòçüòçüòç
Hey, i am like you almost exactly. My plan is to hold, i will stick to my plan.
you're one lucky bastard
It was up like 20% for the day when you posted this!
Yeah I use pro on the computer. Just funny when it moons the site always crashes haha
this must be the dumbest way to forecast sales. I'm all in.
I didnt realize it had till now, holy fucking shit

No lol
And really stoned
Twenty seventh

Hey PLUG man you‚Äôre kinda boning me here
After that bullshit SPY pump 5 min before close, I hope the Democrats regulate Wall Street to hell ü•∞
day traders got caught short into the close and had to zero out their positions.
Why the yolo flair? when these fit so much better. You were the one who always put the squares in the oval holes weren't you.
Options?
Shitpost?
Discussion?
welp my puts for december are rekt down 50% on them already. i guess i am the only bear on here and let me tell you it is depressing.

What‚Äôs plug ??
Bears just CRUSHED today. Even tech went up bigly
Because what you describe is incredibly hard to do at scale. Take it from a software engineer.
[removed]
I don't know man I always think this and then SPY drops 30 points in 2 weeks.  We'll have to see if SPY can establish support there because both times it corrected since august it easily broke through the 330 level.
I‚Äôm the bottom for baba
SDC AH
I will keep saying it in hopes I make some other people rich.  


PLTR is a long term hold, it's not a meme stock, but it, wait, take your 20 banger in 5-7 years.
Spy fuck on me
It‚Äôll be fine
actually we arent in overbought territory yet, RSI is only 67 so there is still a little more room before the rug pull

woah look at the difference between NDX and QQQ in that last few minutes
AH meanings nothing if there is no big reason.
Ask sleepy joe
I bought calls on Friday, and down. Buy puts brotha. I've been on a huge losing streak. Anything I buy sells-off.
SPY will go down 0.2% if nuke happens
Why
This is how I feel after my 0dte‚Äôs print bigly
Go into another sub and see what happens? Let us know if 3 days
Plug lol
Gain 7% before someone pulled PLUG and tanked to 5.68&
Good to know someone on this app is making money, out there taking her easy for all of us.
[deleted]
battery too heavy
Man I have already lost a lot betting against spy. This market is so irrational.
Hey, I may have finally got a earnings correct with SDC
All the plug money went to dkng
How do I get this
YES SDC I FINALLY GOT A FUCKING WIN MY ACCOUNT IS SAVED!!!
If it could pump on up to $50 that could be exciting for some people
I made more during the last 30 minute SPY jump than I will all week at work.
Oh shit you‚Äôre rigjt ha just tried to go on it. You tried coinbasepro?
Is this the bottom for baba?
no you just have to use enough leverage >200. I looked onto this paper the last minutes and it would have worked:

i guess they pulled the plug on PLUG
If I manage to breakeven on these goddamn 11/20 NIO calls, I will personally fly to Andrew Left's house and take a shit on his lawn.
gunna need more than that SDC

\>20% or bust
I'm still learning to diamond hands it's hard to not just take profit, imo. Diamond handing these Walmart 12/04 152.50 calls rn, they almost hit 100% I'm hoping tomorrow morning people buy like they did with csco
$NIO moon
Thank you for linking this one. Much better
That‚Äôs a really good point king thank you
PLUG INSIDER OFFERING 750K SHARES
had some FDs in SDC that just printed...LFGGG
Should of bought PLTR calls.
One more day to get in on the NIO hype
This was suggestive content towards minors because the 17 year olds can‚Äôt post shit DD anymore
Im only holding shares rn, what call positions you holding??
its run literally 30% in the past 2 weeks, cmon dude
SPY 380 tomorrow!
offering LOL
I have the opposite oh no
[deleted]
Ok lil p
hi I just checked this should be mine
Bruh you called this LMAFO
DKNG price target $100 at loop capital
Offering? Load up on puts tomorrow.
Facts I just came on here to try and find out - I‚Äôm happy doh I own some shares
Typical fake market
Don‚Äôt talk about my calls like this
Probably hold. The chances of a dump get higher and higher with each pump day. It's absurd. Up to you bro
Nice!  Good shit man
BaBa will reward your loyalty soon.
I would like this with AMZN too prs.
LETS GO SDC BABY LETS GOO
Most likely nothing. This chart represents options bought at the top of their value, going the wrong way, and by some miracle recovering. OP just held on for dear life and lucked out when the options recovered
The last few weeks the only position he has been in is "bent over".
Offering...
r/notopbutok
SPY gapping up at least 365 tomorrow
IWM back at daily high. 

Cool cool.
lol, do u not member any other ev stonk
My condolences.
You‚Äôre missing the point that this number has been increasing every quarter.
SDC baby
Why the fuck did I click that
I agree. Delete SPY
You asked the thoughts on your positions...
Thank God I just threw 1k on SDC instead of plug
Every Walmart FD I have sold has gone up 100%. Annoying as hell
I kind of think that only retail accounts should be allowed to trade ah/pm. Or else they need to make a separate exchange for banks/funds to circle jerk each other.
PLUG insider offering!
Well they are absolutely mooning now, congrats

Closed my plug position yesterday whew
Bye then plug üòÇüòÇ ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è
Guys anyone know why draft kings just pumped 4% after close ?
Idk but i just grabbed shares below 23.5 and I'm very pleased about it.
Yo WHAT THE FUCK
737 max recertification. If I was getting in now. I would focus on the 230 number. That is how high it got in June and I would at least expect a retest of that number this week.
What was the point of the last minute pump?
Only one CAT has that sweet dividend
I sold some Facebook last 10 mins and watched the tick by tick - it took off - haha
Made like 500% on random lottos on a company called PDM lmfao
What's the news with DKNG after hours?
Bitch I‚Äôm the most retarded person here
Jeff and his spreads :(
Wish me luck. I am playing BIDU puts and WMT puts/calls
LAC gang how them tendies taste 

Also fuck vale gang, all my homies hate vale gang
what the eff PLUG
OMFG....check my comment history, decided not to get greedy, sold my üîå calls +400% (holding for over a month $20 jan strikes) and just now they announced secondary share offering, feeling like a genius
All my SPY calls went positive a minute before close wtf
Someone tell him he no longer gets credit for the market after Nov 3
I was torn between alibaba calls and spy calls..... I fucked up
All Blacks included in a WSB meme. Now I've seen everything and can die happy.
Nope but if I say it enough I'll be right eventually right?
Bought spy puts right at close. Prepare for the printüìà heard it here first
[deleted]
New schedule

+ buy at 10am

+ sell at 11am
It's only good if you are selling puts, Do not sell Calls before the next news and "Vaccine" comes out.. The market will shoot up further, so you basically want to be ONLY selling puts..
The big green dildo EOD did a number on me :(

No lube either
I need TSLA to do that thing this week where it just shoots straight up.
what's up with PLUG? why the drop just after market close?
Volume
Ouch. Nio. Wtf . Down 23%
[deleted]
Is it still worth hopping on the NIO train? Need to recoup some losses hah
This is the way
oh really?
That‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve heard nerd
_Zoom Video pumps on hopes of future pandemic_
BABY NEEDS HIS BABA
Why the DKNG pump?
Not gonna lie pretty disappointing day for pltr gang, legit nutted in the morning when I saw premarket $17 then moderna vacine pump is announced and shit dump to $15 before we picked back up with the quad top resistance at $16.
u think lazyboy will tank? I bought a chair took 3 months to get and didn't see anybody else in the store when I ordered it or picked it up
Guess who bought a SPY put at 3:54PM
Buy at $0.10
Sell for $15.1

Easy $1.5 million profit.
Solid thanks dude! Only could listen to a bit of it so probably turned it off before he said that.
RIDE meme status confirmed
Lol
I earned $14!
Thanks I threw some money at it, my BA spread didn‚Äôt fill
Lol sleepy isn't pumping shit. What pumps a national lockdown?
My F leaps were up solid and I sold a covered NIO call in the morning that lost 20% of its value so solid day
no but fr, good-ish DD, i do think we dip a little but not to 320 lol, i can see a reasonable dip to 340 and qqq 270, but no further, investors would buy that dip fast
death, taxes, and an amazon pump to end the day
11/20 $20C and 12/18 $22.5C
sell my weekly puts at 50% loss rn or just hold?
Who the fuck pulled PLUG?!?!
people on twitter saying NIO gonna be a trillion dollar co hahahahaha
[deleted]
"Nio delivered 5000 vehicles in October". 

Lol, fuck me. Why do I have calls?
What a legal and normal eod pump.
i saw an unusual whales alert on PLUG for a bullish position and i jumped in today. got something to eat and looked at the AH graph. rip in pepperoni
what a rally... market has gone straight up in November holy....
Imagine mistaking the eye of Sauron for the palantir

Dollar general version of the song
Why‚Äôs I think GME earnings were today? Guys, am I retarded?
Welp the daily threads suck now

But at least the posts are still gold
someone pulled the plug
[deleted]
I think they are red
BABA please be done with the drops. Start to hit 265 tomorrow.
[deleted]
what do you mean clean energy..? wondering why its tanking after hours
Ha, what‚Äôs IV crush when the stock goes up 20% üòé
yup...

i placed an order and it pumped at last second, i didnt get the fill goddamnit
Up 70% after close. Should‚Äôve diamond hands.
Scrolling through to see what happened to plug
100 by next year. 11/19/2021 $30c
monster spy rip into close = bear accounts wiped tomorrow
Yeah, but don't stocks generally drift up with lack of catalyst? Especially after coming off of a -9% daily low and irrational pumping markets?

Position: sold to open 11/20 SPCE 20.5p
Lol why would I do something so troublesome when I could just buy more shares myself
Plugs vaccine only 50% efficacy, not a good sign
DKNG on the move AH
Its going to retest the June high of 230 and may get as high as 245-250 this week. Moderna was the first catalyst. The 737 max recert on Wednesday will be the next.
Now begins the Age of Joe Buydip
DD posted on wsb and it tanks at the end of the day


All in
Joe Biden with a real American pump. 

Get that weak trump shit out of here
Yeah. Boomers love their cruise vacations. NCLH announced they are already fully booked for second half of 2021
That was a glorious EOD pump
holy fuck CBAK looks scrumptious. However I believe that lithium batteries will only be sufficient until 2040ish, around then I think the over reliance on batteries will catch up and cause shortages of lithium driving up the price and making battery powered travel more of a luxury product. Hydrogen will most likely take over 2025 and on wards as you can't run a semi market off of batteries because they would need to charge for an hour or more and would need to charge more frequently than hydrogen vehicles need to fill up, practically cutting the efficiency of semi truck hauling by like 20%. But yeah Fcel looks like it has survived dropping below a dollar and seems like their profits are coming back in since they already have a good infrastructure.
Sold most during last weeks pop. Still have 1000 shares for reasons
Thank you cat, my $SPY calls made me 150
$40k+ in JBLU shares
PLUG did
What happen to my bae Julia Chatterly? She looks like 50 yrs old today.
I guess someone really didnt want to hold onto anymore PLUG today
[deleted]
There is no real economy boom. Ten million people suffered permanent hits to lifetime income.

This is all about the Fed. Interest rates zero forever. PE's to the moon.
It‚Äôs drunk and fucking my calls!!!
Probably be a sell off after earnings tomorrow as people try and secure profits.... or the alternative
Wow not cool SPY what the fuck
I was tempted earlier but concerned about Pfizer filing for emergency use authorization this week.  They said earlier that the problem was data gathering and with the huge uptick in cases , that data is likely sooner rather than later.

I have zero urge to be holding recovery stock puts when that announcement hits.
Same thing with the lunch dip.
Be a long time again to see those
ahhahahahaha
Too late to turn back I'm holding
Looks like puts have been getting wrecked throughout the day. I‚Äôm expecting nice large green dildos overnight
WTF happened to PLUG?
Can I just say I‚Äôm so excited to see what happens for NIO earnings. Like I don‚Äôt have shares or options, but I just wanna see the drama unleash and the gain/loss porn and the fools who don‚Äôt know about IV crush
It better or I'm fucked!
SDC
MY MAN
Damn bye plug

Funny you mention that.

It's actually $2000 more now though since 18 days ago.

Fuckkklk my PLUG calls üò≠üò≠
Who pulled the PLUG
If SPY opens 370 tomorrow or weds ill nut.
2% on a AMD day trade - so no
The great reset is coming
Not tomorrow. Good thing I only have one call. ‚ÄòBout to be -50% at open!
Does anyone go near tmo? I‚Äôm tempted to buy but idk
260c 12/11
The pfizer and moderna vaccines are based on it. Ticker for Moderna is MRNA... Soo mRNA (I believe this is the bulk of their research).
401k buys
NIO rising from the ashes like a beautiful phoenixüòö
U fuckkng with the mouse?!
What in the fuck was that EOD pump goddamnit
FINALLY VALE TO THE MOON (the moon being over $13 when my calls print)
Dude stop it you're giving me a boner
lmao this market is fucking retarded WOO
Lmao what is plug doing
[deleted]
Si mi amigos
SDC is going to seriously pump tomorrow. I hope you got in before close but if not, got in asap
It‚Äôs a modern day tech version of the all seeing eye thingy from lord of the rings
NIO will open at 50 tm
That AH plug dump
SPY would only pump to 400 faster on hopes of new fallout cleanup tech
I only kept one of my 12/4 $50 calls, we shall see what tomorrow has in store
Looks like someone pulled the plug
[deleted]
[removed]
Buy more
Yes I want to get into this.  Have you found any good plays?  Researched it some and dint come up with a great play
Anyone playing airlines long term? Got June SAVE calls today
Yet CNBC calls it a winning day for apple, fuck off
circuit breakers LOL
respecc
Please don't be an idiot and sell AT LEAST half of this position tomorrow morning
Amc definitely has been shitting the bed,  this is a real autist play and I hope it pays off for you,  but not for me.
Mi So Sad
Title is accurate

BABA a good buy or is it loser-ville
Can't wait to see if I fucked up getting out of FCEL @ $3.74. I was in @ $2.46
Robinhood put buying thru the roof. No wonder SPY keeps jumping, going to stay cash for a couple weeks.
Each day we go through the same shock about the end of day 5 minute pump.
amazon ended flat for the day, but my calls went down 8% and my puts went down 25%

neat
Gei
Right. I have freed up about 10% of my portfolio today. 

Someone explain PLTR to me, without saying what it is not, or what it is like. Just explain it in absolute terms. If you make a good case, I'll buy shares.

I won't move the market obviously, but I'll be in your corner lol.
I managed to lose $500
first yes, then lost all of it times 2

10 million volume on the last SPY dildo? üòÇ
someone please eli5
Let‚Äôs pray for NIO
spy is so fuckijg retarded
Psth
üí§
I don‚Äôt even understand how my plug talk
heavily rumored so far, but it's extremely plausible. PLTR are the software behind the new hospital-data reporting in both the US & UK, and they accepted an extremely low fee in the UK to build their system; a suspiciously low fee. They had to be using that data to test something bigger.
Need hope for the hopeless. Those who wander are not lost.
niceee my puts got destroyed
que?
365 at open
Down bad..idk if I should deposit more lol
My dec 18 baba calls are down 60%. What do I do?

Not everyone is as retarded as we here at wsb.
Sum Ting Wong?
Let's. Go. Joe.
Barely
what the hell just happened to $PLUG
We Too Low
Bought puts 5 minutes before close. This hurts
Lol that HD pump hell yeah! Wish I had more of a beefy portion of my account in it but hopefully it does well enough  at earnings to give me some moolah.

280c 11/20.

Based on brief look at prior two earnings the stock seems to sell off  bit the day or two after earnings so sell at open may be the play.

PLUG WHAT?!
Don‚Äôt forget pll
I like PRNT.
Stocks worth more than ever because 8 months of lost demand was just shifted into the future?

It's just multiple expansion, bro.
WHY did PLUG have a massive DUMP
Did ANYBODY make money today?
Bought a few protective puts RIGHT before close on NIO, just in case it dumps ass.
What the fuck was that
i just need four -15% days on slv before january
8.5million trades in the last minute on SPY ....wtf
?

SUM TING WONG?
ended the day with weeklies in DIS puts, DKNG calls, and GLD calls. Feeling alright.

That's some JPow shit right there
Does your cat have free options trading strategies he offers on you tube? Where can I sign up for thebfeee course.
370 EOW stop fighting it
What a fucking day...never would have guessed I would close at my highest point of the day at 3pm
Lol look at SPY
Wtf PLUG
Downside.. BABA is still down, upside BABA is still down so I can buy more tomorrow.
I believe $SPCE will settle around $19 by the end of the week. No catalysts in the short term horizon.
I need donny to tweet some lies about the election, please.
Gold gang and tech gang also weeping along the bears.
Thank god I only have BABA shares, couldn‚Äôt imagine being a call holder
Solo is dogshit 1 look at their car and upcoming cars will show you all you need to know
It‚Äôs always down when shitcoin moons. It‚Äôs down now
SPY is dumping so hard tomorrow and wednesday shit is so overbought
Disappointed I only took a small bite. Up 89% on my calls today though. Can only assume it‚Äôll keep rising like NIO
Link?
Nice
Even if it wasn‚Äôt stripe Bill Ackman being himself and seeking vengeance on everyone who doubts him as an investor is enough for me
Fuck mods.
Get over it
I have spoken
Spy just smoked them puts lmao
Did you manage to get some tendies from my suggestion?
It's an emerging industry, give it time. Ark thinks it's going to get its breakthrough moment very soon. FAA recently approved 3D printing of plane parts which is a start.
Biden BULL
Worst thing that could happen was that close... if it dosen‚Äôt break my portfolio is gone
You're writing naked strangles instead of trading condors or shorting VIX futures with a call backstop? Christ, you belong here retard
why bet against the greatest country in the world?

BACK TO THE CAVE, BEARS!
I better see a big red dump when I wake up tomorrow. Or else
Holy crap TQQQ pumped literally in the last 2 minutes. Gap up tomorrow baby
does any of what you wrote make sense...sleepy that you?
Chinese gov taking stake in NIO lol, bears r so fuk
This is fucking bullshit I hope this country gets nuked
I'm so fucked.
lol i really dont know thats $60,000 we're talking about for something 500 people probably saw. thats $2400 per person.

also dude, im up 50% already on my calls... there has been amazing movement since 6 months....
Just get out tomorrow man its not worth it
dow about to hit 300
Ho Lee Fuk.
BEARS R FUK
I just wish I had options enabled so I could short the thing. They‚Äôre are gunna lose so much money tommorow. THE BEARS ARE TAKING THESE EARNINGS
Also, what did you get into when you were at $100?
That was a large column buy
Lol someone bought $500k worth of WMT calls seconds before close goddamn
wtfffff was that. my pooooots
what a day...$3k in options on the table and i finish -$1.38
Weak hands already out. I don't see it dropping more than 5-10% max
lollllll
Jesus that last pump.... why am I holding puts...what the fuck is wrong with me..
Wow i just bought my first call of november and already up. FUCK BEARS IM DONE
Dry ice stonks!
Why? It‚Äôs good for me
This is gambling. It loses all value at the end of expiring Otm but can make you close to $1 for every $0.01 a stock moves up depending on delta. Read about this shit if you want to play.
Ended the day up $11. I'll take it lol
Probably right
Well my account is blown up thanks SPY
Fucking monstrous pump
#BIDEN PUMP
I call VIX manipulation
Anyone calling him an idiot is an idiot themselves. Just because you don‚Äôt have the means or the balls to take risks like this guy did doesn‚Äôt mean he is an idiot. Also he could be rich one day off this. 

Even if he lost everything and in the future you wanted to come back and call him an idiot it wouldn‚Äôt be valid. And if you think you are so much smarter than him, why don‚Äôt you show a video of your account and the crazy smart gains you made with your gay ass bear plays.
30k lol
That was a seriously phat pump
yoooo my spy calls just went the fuck off
Holy moly
Well fick that gay ass pump
Im up 50% today, down 60% all time. Slowly but surely ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I agree that we are testing highs on only momentum, I just don‚Äôt think we test below 330 again.
SPY said fk your puts

What a fucking pump!!! Holy fuck
Oh this is beautiful sir. Nice.

H0LY FUCK
WTF this spike
Need actual advice on how to cope with a big loss. It doesn‚Äôt leave my head.
PLTR is flat and gay I want +10% every day REEEE
RSI is basically momentum. Low movement = lower RSI

No movement = lower momentum
I'm only 25 so this could be a good play for the long term,  will have to look in to solo.
looks like i should've inversed myself today üòå
GAWD DAMN
Pahmp it!
Yeah fuck 414% go for 1000% obviously.
Lmao üòÇ
WoW WTF is that SPY action?
I got my brain genes on. But my uncle thinks it‚Äôs 200% fake. My cousins think it‚Äôs a real virus but no worse than an average cold.
I went with 2 week exp. one state announces lockdown and this things back in the shitter.
Holy fuck that‚Äôs the way to close it out!!!!
Ya I‚Äôm not gonna buy any options on it. Fuck I feel like it might moon tho
Solid Closing pump
They're about to release now
Boring tech with no clear monetization and scalability
You and me both broham
Fuck this gay ass pump
I just bought calls after losing 8k being a bear. Goodluck bulls
beautiful rip into close. RIP bears

Tesla has been a meme for like 3 years and it‚Äôs still going strong
Also, their product is fucking exceptional. Look it up. Under 3k for a beautiful design and performance, AND its electric. People just need to know about it.

Hi. I'm here to pump my SH position. 11/20 $20P
 Donald Tweeted about market Highs.  VXX $20 Call 12/4   Locked and loaded

Godspeed fam, we'll be both well in the green üí™

Wtf are these premiums though I'm making bank üòÇüòÇ
Why? Why is this week different?
True. Just gonna average down up to 1k shares
I appreciate the optimism! I was really hoping to get above 25k this week to start daytrading - gotta get back to the basics ;)
dimaond handed my NIO calls today, hope this doesnt bite me in the ass
Cbat eoy predictions?
you can always tell whose trying to pump their bullshit
Remember there‚Äôs about 8 months of untapped growth because of the virus. 

It‚Äôs BUY BUY BUY now that Biden promised to roll out the virus nationally (which any President should do anyways ffs)

I decided to hold my 1/15/21s (20c).   I don‚Äôt wanna take on additional profits this year if I can exercise them in January.
what date and strike you selling?
I think we‚Äôve always been this dumb but I think recently people have been encouraged to think that feeling of dumbness is actually the sensation of seeing through the vast conspiracy that controls the world and that anything they don‚Äôt understand is just fake.
How is obv so much down without any price movement on spy

yeah you‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not like they went 0-6 with him as their mid in a major international tournament very recently
Largest iron ore and nickel producer in the world.  Might be a good sympathy play now that lithium and green energy co's are getting pumped sky high.  Calls are cheap too.

I‚Äôve been doing well with 6 months @20% OTM
Decided to throw $200 into some OTM CCL puts because why not.
Can NIO close at 3% with 2 min to go??
I‚Äôm in
Dont worry about 300 shares. Wait for the weed hype again
Everyone here bag holding OTM puts... Deciding if they should salvage the $5...
So you exited your positions that were doing well and kept your positions that were doing poorly?
ALL U NIO BEARS CAN SUCK THIS
I recommend highly. But I‚Äôm just an autist
Christ. If you don‚Äôt know about IV crush or how to prevent it by hedging Vega and theta than you have a lot to learn. But honestly best way to learn is to lose and best way to lose is to play.

lol, Etrade sold my 5x SPY 362p at 3:51. Watch it dump in the last 5 minutes before close.
Yes
JD calls i held through earnings like a smoothbrain
Go further out in date
Imagine if Diamondback Energy goes back to 130
Shits volatile as hell on a normal day, let alone before earnings
Thanks, bought some spy puts, $355 11/18
MFST $210c 3/19/21
BABA baby please stop pouting and get back to 270
> Any other state going into shutdown this week other than NY & CA? 

Then I suggest you conduct proper research and rephrase your statement.
Where do I turn that on?
$SPY has unstoppable retard strength. üí™ü•¥
Yeah, already made 400$ off it so will probably set sell limit to get the juicy coin and then either throw the rest at Plug Power or something else
When ACB popped I picked up hexo.  Just kept going down from that 1 dollar.  I think right now there is something in dec like an 8 for 1 type thing to become compliant with whatever it is.  I dropped it. Ain't looking back.
Hold
Probably because I have puts. It will dump as soon as they expire worthless
Anyone bullish on 3D printing stonks? Ark invest got a few names in their speculative ETFs
OIL
Lmfao up 10% on my PLTR calls on a flat day, wtf you autists doing buying these bad boys so high???
Oh, definitely. I would only be looking to get out at break even at this point. There's a chance it could drop to 252 and if even that doesn't hold, 230 would be next. Maybe buy when it's as close to 257 as possible and sell off those contracts if 257 breaks and aim to rebuy at 252? I don't know.

It is pretty oversold right now so chance of going up is pretty good but who knows.
Spy puts for tomorrow
BABA EOD buyyyy
JD calls mostly. i'm a fucking idiot and didn't close them out last week cuz i made some dumb trades and had to use my daytrades. i almost NEVER let shit ride through earnings anymore i've built my account back up to around 20k. bit me in the ass again..
Good gawd
Sleepy Joe you cucked my puts!

Great day. 70% on my TGT calls. CVS 20%. Follow the trend! It ain't tech currently.
HYLN is cookin right now.
Lol every libra knew this already
NVDA:üò¥üíÄ

To be honest if NKLA can get higher with *nothing*, then NIO on the right track should be able to achieve it
WMT leaps =$$$
I would truly like a sitdown with the retards buying stocks at ATH in current environment to understand how much deranged they are
We‚Äôre all autists. 

NIO PT wasn‚Äôt 25.

Sold my winners at open which continued to gain value 

Held my losers which continued to lose value

Nope but wonder if it‚Äôll continue or if it‚Äôs just running the EV train and will eventually de rail
Lordstown Motors sounds like something off Great Gatsby era

Alright I won‚Äôt any calls. It‚Äôs your fault if I lose out on gains but also ill give you credit for saving me if it indeed does crash lol
spy keeps tryna dump but gets repelled every time. it's ending 363 man
Overblown, yes

But fake? Puts on your brain genes
Now the time that 1/2 of people tomorrow are going to regret panic buying calls/puts for NIO tomorrow

Thanks for the trendies my guy
My gut tells me we‚Äôre going up tomorrow so I bought puts
Right? Currently at 300 shares, I keep averaging down and buying more every dip but I wonder when it will come back
Great I lost money on my NIO straddle.

Why is their product better than just paying a couple of software engineers to aggregate data from all your databases to AWS, something on prem, or whatever else you wanna do?

Didn‚Äôt feel any play in my loins today so I loaded $200 to play online blackjack during lunch. Made a quick 800. Why work job when gamble do trick?
Nice GME dip before the crusade continues tomorrow.
We will not be shaken so easily
made 400$ off of Nio as it was on its way up, I see it going to be pretty good in near future but it already made a huge leap, will probably plateau for a bit and I'm trying to make money now ;)
Sell covered calls and buy puts with premium. Good hedge strat without a heavy loss
570c 11/20, 600c 1/2021
Who are they
Even if you had infinite money it doesn't work because unlike a roulette wheel you dont know what your return will be when you guess right. If you guess green and spy goes up .1% you guessed right but you still lose most of your premium.

Man, I feel like this Trump/China tariff news is getting *sooooo* underplayed.  It nearly caused a market crash back in 2018 and $SPY drilled by like 20%

I know he lost / Biden is president-elect now but is it really out of the picture for him to tank the market and spend the next decade talking about how he's the only one who can save the economy?

Meh, green is green. See y'all tomorrow!

The timing of when $NIO and $LI hit the same retracement levels demonstrates trend correlation.  When observed closely, $LI was drawn to whatever pattern that $NIO was forming.  

After posting, it occurred to me that the majority of this sub does not have enough capital in their accounts to take advantage of this (i.e. they can't day trade).  As someone else pointed out, $XPEV (the other, other Chinese EV) was also correlated.  I know I'm not the only one who noticed this.

I feel affirmative action is really the big reason why society is the way it is. The best people are not getting the opportunity to succeed because it would lead to a system that is not diversified. If we're going to talk about equality, then everyone should compete on a level playing field.

The salt is strong here. Sorry your baseless fraud and pump and dump accusations aren't allowed in a sub about coronavirus.

Their scheduled sale of stocks when the price hit predetermined prices is standard practice and not an example of insider trading. It's designed specifically to avoid insider trading.

MRNA going up and down due to market pressures and news isn't evidence of a pump and dump. Maybe try learning the actual definition of a pump and dump.

I come here most days to talk about stocks and my portfolio and my terrible option choices. I didn't expect to see myself here. Sorry you had MRNA puts after the Pfizer news cause "it's a pump and dump" and you got burned. Just deposit more of your parents money and try TSLA 420 calls again.

oh yeah i‚Äôm not overreacting just because we have some players at big clubs. Overall the team is still weak with a glaring hole up front. Pulisic and Reyna can be special though, Dest maybe

10 years in oil trading and the advice I got from some of the best in the field was:
1. No one has died from taking PNL
2. Always buy "free" options
3. What's your 2nd best alternative , backstop

So on that basis would suggest to take some and if one must YOLO , make sure you have a backstop of cash
I have puts I promise you it doesn‚Äôt
Become an investor bro
Fuck this day was boring
Hard to say due to the somewhat close expiration but the 257 support has been holding for a few days now (was first hit premarket on the 11th).

apparently if you go to historically black college, it's 100%? Wtf is that? You make it easier to get into colleges for black people with affirmative action and you give them preferential treatment. 

I'm all for anti racist movements but don't give them preferential treatment like this. That's why there are black people that think they're entitled. 

Why do you think some people are racist towards black people? It's because government creates reasons like that. No black person has ever asked for pity or preferential treatment. They just want **equality not more.**

I'm Asian but if I were black, I'd be pissed not thankful. Maybe happy in the short-term because you get your loans forgiven but the concept of preferential treatment is messed up. Why do you make it easier to get into college for black people? That's like broadly saying that black people are intellectually inferior. If you want to promote equality, then treat all people the same. Am I wrong or what?

Go NIO!  Pump it!
Buying options when IV is elevated is the real killer of your gains. Obviously if the underlying moves greatly in your favor you profit but more often than not, it doesn't.
I don't care I just need my calls to print. It only has to go up for a moment.
bro, it aint gonna drop until the fed lets it drop, so not any time soon

max we can realistically fall is 10% but the fed will pump it right back where it fell from

the fed is the market at this point, you arent investing in companies, youre investing in the fed when you buy into this market

It‚Äôs sitting above 200% and will go up tomorrow, so all signs point to yes unless there‚Äôs a huge beat. It‚Äôs just like any other pump before earnings.

If I‚Äôve got good profits right before earnings tomorrow, I‚Äôm taking them and maybe holding on to one or a couple calls as lotto tickets. I have shares since September though and will be holding those through.

All in NIO calls
Fuck $16, all my homies hate $16
50% calls, 50% puts.  Simple as that.
CBAT!
Oh SHIT today is NIO DAY
First, I've got no idea if price is actually tied to efficacy or actual revenue fundamentals. It's 2020, baby, anything goes on a hyped stock like Moderna.

For the data itself, as others have (rightly!) said, it's hard to make exact calls without more complete data. **But at a spot check, the error bars here are really not very big, even if it's a "small" sample**. The \~95% figure seems to come from 95 folks getting sick, with 90 of those having received no vaccine (only placebo) while 5 of them had. We can get an idea of the uncertainty from this sample by finding the confidence interval of 5 out of 95 "positive" results. (This isn't exactly the formula used to get "efficacy", which = 1 - (sick-with-vaccine)/(sick-without-vaccine), but that's a lot of writing and doesn't change my point).

Plugging this in ([https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=85](https://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc/calculator.aspx?id=85)) we can see that even the 99% confidence interval for the statistic "percentage of the sick people that were from the placebo group" is around 94.7%, ranging from 85.8 to 98.8%. That's a bit of uncertainty around the margins, but not enough to be practically significant. Even at the low end of that range, the FDA will absolutely approve the vaccine and it would do massive good if widely administered. That comes with the caveat that the confidence interval is only looking at uncertainty from the number of sick people tested (so it could be misleadingly small if there's a more systematic error in the trial design, like if Moderna only tested on young/healthy folks who are systematically more likely to have strong immune responses vs. the population at large). But barring some crazy systematic effect like that, this (prelim) data looks good and **the idea that small numbers of patients here is reason to fundamentally doubt that the vaccine is effective is not a strong case. You can run the confidence interval yourself, and "but it's a small sample" actually isn't very important here.**

Power bottoms are under appreciated
Hahaha yeah Joe most people are going to wear masks, socially distance, limit to 10 people, and test right before for Thanksgiving. Definitely gonna happen.
Yeah. It‚Äôs pretty contagious.
Made my thousands off of it, then tried to switch it up with SPY last week and lost all of it pretty much. TQQQ i will never leave you again
exactly lmao
I'm trying to explain options to my friend as we're both four tallboys deep at a BDubs at 1:40 PM on a Monday.

This is life.
They don‚Äôt want to get into locking down the country with potentially no stimulus.
PLTR 20c will make so much fucking money. It's only a matter of choosing the exp date at this point.
Implied Volatility. It's probably the biggest driver of an option's price. IV is crazy high rn for NIO because it is before earnings and anything can happen. Right after earnings, it will plummet and so will the price. If your option is not ITM when that happens, you risk losing the entire value of the option.
She‚Äôs a competent prosecutor that knows our constitution well.  She is a good person and will try to make decisions that actually help people and are within the bounds of our constitution.
If it doesn‚Äôt go up at a consistent rate tomorrow, IV crush will happen.
When has anyone ever cared about the VP's positions on anything?

Her approach probably isn't any different from Biden's.
when did WSB turn into "check out my gurlfriend"? Bruh, one ben franklin gets me harder than these ugly ass onlyfans chicks.
15$ min wage incoming. All the fastfood guys will run towards automation. MCD, SBUX, WMT, TGT, HD
not sure how valid it is, but I've heard PLTR will be leaned on heavily for the distribution of covid vaccine by the government. That would be huge.
I  Sweden we call that an AF-account. You only tax winnings when you sell. You don't get taxed if you sell at a loss, hence why people day it is 'safe'.

The other option is called ISK.  An example is 2018, the only thing you paid was 1,49% (it changes a bit every year) of your total assets on that account.  The obvious choice when it comes to what account you trade on.

Retards we have a NIO liftoff. Everyone else: AbOUt FuKiNg TiMe
All in on puts and let me tell you sir I have hardcore loss porn from those lol so yes I could not do any worse buying calls...market is so rigged
Lol yeah I bought at $287 and am holding and it hurts
I honestly dont think they will pass anything
I owed my roommate some dough and told him to play a RIDE weekly.

Debt is settled
don't you mean ceiling you idiot
For some perspective, I pay 260$/month for my health insurance (family plan; 1 child and 1 SO). 

I have a HSA plan - My company contributes 1000$/yr, and anything I contribute effectively lowers my taxable income. 

My deductible is $3,000 (a year).  Once the deductible is reached, I owe 20% on most things until I hit a max out of pocket of $7,000. Keep in mind I front loaded my HSA, so generally anything I pay for comes out of there, and not any additional part of my paycheck. 

Not quite sure - it's not the best. Definitely not the worst. It does seem expensive. But so is medical care here. Really it feels like I get nickel and dimed since I rarely hit my deductible. But if something catastrophic happened, I would be capped at 7k max cost to myself.
I hate being up 40% on calendar spreads and just agonizing on whether to close them or not.
Yup
Isn't Biden like 90? Isn't he highly at risk regardless of his job (which could obviously be considered essential)? 

What could his reasoning possibly be for not taking the vaccine
RIDE, bitches.
start screamin NIO!

Of course Biden is getting the vaccine. Its politicking because until Georgia finishes the runoff for 2 senate seats, the election isnt over. Any move to make the democrats look more conscientious towards Covid-19 management can help.
His daddy
surprised by TDOC dip. people will still use telemedicine long after covid cause it‚Äôs way more convenient for like 80% of the mild to moderate issues most people have and would see a doctor for. plus Trump cut a ton of outdated red tape around it.

Yeah it's just an expensive lottery ticket, if I can sell it for a gain before earnings I probably will.
Thank you for your sacrifice

Anyone who hasn't seen Audi's latest electric offering
Picked up weekly DIS puts and DKNG call, lets see what happens

This sub does a great job picking stocks. Everyone here was early to the game with NIO. The problem is 99% of people here don't know what tf to do once they've picked a good stock. Buy ignorant otm calls and lose their positions trying to play every trading opportunity instead of enjoying the successes they have.

But that's why I love it here.
who?
Drop a f bomb joe plz
Imagine the IV crush if NIO stays in the 40s. Would be hilarious

How is this pumping SPY?

?? 

He sounds horrible
Bears are fucked
Yes, but since there will be so little vaccines at first, he's basically saying that he's in a position where he can be insulated from the virus, and front line workers should get them first because they have higher chance of getting the virus.
Right after I sold everything to go all in on pltr
Just sold my NIO for baiduuu and smile direct cuck. 

Better not have gotten biduped

Let him wait to say this until he's president.
$15 could get you a couple of $100 strikes for January 1/15/21. Ambitious as hell, but I can see CVS pumping to the mid 80s as we keep getting more Vaccine news like emergency authorizations, general authorization, and information on the distribution which could all come before January.

Thank you üëë
Hold
I wouldnt, also when you pay off your student loans it'll close out the account and it dings your credit score a bit assuming it's a pretty old account. it'll recover fairly quickly but might be useful to know in case you had any purchases coming up
Nah
sad i got out of my shares around the offering :(
16.00 - you back for more, old man...

PLTR - i didnt hear no stink'n bell...
Whats the next genius play?
They will always have business as long as they‚Äôre open
Yeah dont pay shit. I have about the same, not paying anything until the thingy expires of course, but im paying minimum even tho i can wipe it out in hopes of legislation later

Imagine buying GAP in 2020 when it was 5.25 a share. Fuck that
It‚Äôs after market close tomorrow
Fuck you my taxes won‚Äôt be paying for your shit
You don‚Äôt have to listen to these guys. You can make your own path and do what you want with the gains. It still a great loss porn story if you lose half your years salary but keep the rest! Just trying to help out where I can
start with 10 dollars. And you could use leverage to also double your tries.
I do want to let you know you really do belong in this sub. Its a great place for people like you,
No. I got 2 30c @43$ each. I plan on selling if there is a run up this week or jumping ship to a lower call
Last chance to get into $KSS earnings ;)
Not true, gridlock senate, won‚Äôt be able to do corporate taxes (don‚Äôt even think he actually would) corporations are confident. WRONG BITCH
Biden: *My mission is simple, to make YOU money. There's always a bull market somewhere and I promise to help YOU find it.*
Seriously don't start getting your hopes up about any powerful person ever going to prison. Trump is in the cabal, don't let him fool you. This is the same nonsense that whipped up Trump supporters with "lock her up". How did that work out?
Pltr 20 for tmr?
Would agree he seems a lil out of it but I usually chalk up speech stammers to his childhood stutter.
Did I miss the PLTR DD or some shit?
Pfizer went down after vaccine news. Moderna will so the same right?  Bought puts at the low today..

NIO earnings is after market close, how much can we expect the IV to drop by tomorrow at open? I want to hold onto my 11/20 50c...
Anyone looking at ADSK.. any thoughts? Seems like it‚Äôs been consolidating for a while
Is BA getting ahead of itself?
Tell that to RIDE
So Apple or Microsoft  won‚Äôt have government contracts because they don‚Äôt make things in America? Will they just use GM touch screens?

Guess I'm holding my NIO calls. Am I fucked or rich?
I'll bet you my portfolio nothing happens to him. If they didnt throw him in jail for raping children, they're not throwing him in jail over anything.

Bull flag is erect.
Pick an EV - they all getting pumped
If I owe less than 10k on my student loans is it even worth paying them lmao. I could 100% pay it off right now but interest is 0 and if it‚Äôs gonna be forgiven why even bother
[deleted]
Satire?
YES. I have already bough several thousand shares. Look at there financials. They are rock solid and they will definitely be paying there dividend. I mean just look at all the other amazing stocks with 75%+ annual dividends.

It's Monday, champ
Joe just said he will be funding $PLTR to spy on the Chinese
[deleted]
If oil takes another hit tomorrow like it did last week, BUY APRIL CALLS! I got in last Thursday, BP 20c already up 40%. We will eventually start driving again, and restrictions on new drilling = lower supply = higher cost = higher profits for the companies. If you're feeling retardedly bullish, buy GUSH, but the premiums are pricey.
My guy... what
Day trading vs swing trading paired w/ theta gang strategies?
My only regret is I didn‚Äôt buy more
I hope that happens because the 8k I currently own in debt would go straight into the market
They killed a bear!
How is NVDA FLAT, are you kidding me????
Shit it helps me I got 12k in student loan debt.
PLTR playing floor is lava with 16.00 LOL
Goddamn this guy is old as shit
Lol media is freaking dumb. Biden talks about economy. They ask about Trump not transitioning. F*ck the economy I guess.
VALE VALE VALE
Theres a YUGE sell order @ 120 on aapl ffs lmao

The way it should be
Ok, first, you do have enough to trade options but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not. Second, VXX isn‚Äôt a stock, it‚Äôs an ETN. Third, it measures volatility and it‚Äôs definitely NOT going to skyrocket when a vaccine is announced. And fourth, everyone has been trying to guess which stocks will go up with the end of covid since before when you learned what COVID was. Sit out bro, this is a casino
Who doesnt like to laugh at trump?
Ha true
Need to borrow $10k in student loans to gamble on FDs ASAP
They‚Äôre under audit, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll definitely post after
this is a good criteria actually
Have you considered taking that $12 profit, buying yourself dinner, and maybe take a break on the options trading? By the grace of God you just got your money back, might want to consider getting out before you go back underwater.

Here's what wsb taught me over the last 3 years. If you want real money, fuk bear gang, fuk bull gang, and fuk theta gang even...just go be a US politician and you'll have a NUMBER OF OPTIONS to line your pockets with money. 60% of the time, it works all the time.
SPY make up your mind please üôè
In fairness, they've probably saved our asses from blowing all our tendies on a hundred other penny stocks. As awful and echo-chambery as it is, I recommend diving into Stocktwits from time-to-time and getting different tickers on your radar.

He‚Äôs not in office yet, so pump until then

I already paid off my student loans, but I wonder if theyd allow you to just sign up for like a MBA or some shit get a nice discount. otherwise that kind of sucks dick, or even non credited classes like for art and shit.
It is - it's a bailout to the banking industry so all of the people that haven't been paying their mortgages can play catch up.
Puts on student loan companies..  where can I go get a quick $10k for "school?"
1. Go back to university
2. Max out student loans
3. Yolo all in FDs
4. Get forgiven
5. Literally free money??

Gentlemen, gentlemen, it's November for crying out loud

This is also a very real possibility. all his political theater and not going down without a fight allows him to run again in four years all on the basis that he and his constituents were cheated... So you make a very good point I had not considered that prior
Do we expect >16 tomorrow?

Let's be real guys Biden ain't going to pump shit.
I'd be down

That being said, stocks only go up.

What‚Äôs max pain for PLTR right now?
as a gamer I can't wait for the release. Preordered on steam. For me at least it's the most expected title in the last few years. Asuming others feel the same I bought some some stock in CDR last year

LMAO Where have you been? Have you not kept up with NY & CA news?
If you would have panned up to your trading desk to place the SPY call order, this clip would have gone viral.  Pro tip - you have to hedge animal bets with ad revenue.  Covers your losses if they're wrong and generates exponential gains if they're right.
Yes Joe, business love hearing about ‚Äúunion‚Äù jobs.

Just pump that infrastructure and COVID stimulus and your good.

Drop the ‚ÄúUnion‚Äù.
Yes let‚Äôs pay for the brainwashing destruction of capitalism, great idea
LOOOOL Chinese companies don‚Äôt care about your unions Joey
They smashed earnings last quarter also and the stock went down. All part of the gamble, it might pay off to hold, or you might lose it all.
Trump: "Make America Great Again"

Biden: "Build Back Better"
I figured it out, predict where lockdowns will occur. The more lockdowns expected the higher the market will go. We've had it backwards all this time
Anyone‚Äôs ball smell like üßÄ today?
The market doesn‚Äôt believe him
Why drag down your portfolio with underperformers for the sake of diversification? Own the best, be the best.
Yea, she is there to string along the progressives while the globalists in charge make moves for the benefit of the international mega corporations and China/Israel

Did we double bottom off of 360
That's a big difference, H1 workers pay taxes just like every one else. Buying shit outside of America only benefits people outside
Jack ma dick off to these losses hahaha.
Jk I have tons of calls this is gonna be a hard week for me.
Come on Jeff AMZN show me a 100point intraday difference!
Complete sentences, and not playing an imaginary accordion. So refreshing.
"good-paying jobs" is this dudes catch phrase
If you want SPY to hit 400 by april then you should volunteer for dems in GA senate races

People keep asking about stock. Stock is used as a base for cooking. Your on the wrong sub
Joe just has to put up a picture and name of each Republican senator and say these are the people that won't pass a stimulus bill because they want your family poor and hungry.  The Dems can also use it to get those 2 Senate seats in GA if they don't.
Joey pumping unions. sell sell sell!!!
I started trading options in July, so I missed most of the run up, but CLX was good.
It‚Äôs ok PLTR when you feel up to breaking 16 you can :)
What is this poor people talk I am hearing?
NIO tends to fall under "tech" like Tesla does although they are vehicle manufacturers. They will do even better after covid as jobs return and car sales increase.
Lol hidin Biden isn't going to pump shit
They already have an exclusive deal with fanduel for advertising. This could be big very soon
 Sleepy joe boring market ain‚Äôt moving
Well biden and mitch are besties, and if the senate is 50/50 kamala is tie breaking vote. Much more likely now than before

Options market has been retarded today in the best way. Bought Z calls this morning, just averaged down 30% even though the stock is higher than it was @ my first purchase. TSM options are doing something similar.
No, I just saw Dow go up +340 from +370, Nasdaq from +54 to +66 and S&P from +27 to +32. All in the last 10 minutes
Have a feeling he's gonna say one thing and do the complete opposite

I told ya'll you were sleepin on SBE.  Holding shares only, up $4,000 today.
When the fuck is AMD going to to go 500? Such an undervalued stock. Mama Su is a great engineer and leader but for a company with the potential of AMD, it should have the same hype as TSLA.

You are identifying an internal mechanism that led to the outcome we can all observe on the surface, which at the end of the day is the important thing that applies. Watch me do it with a hypothetical:

Ford CEO heavily invests in EV and creates a competitive engineering team, even setting up a potential rebranding so they‚Äôre not directly associated with Ford. However activists investors hate the idea and fire the CEO, dooming Ford‚Äôs prospects of competing with growing companies that appeal to a new generation of consumers.

See how easy that is? It doesn‚Äôt really matter why, it matters what. Same outcome. 

I understand that these companies can be perceived as ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù in the sense they need to grow into their value... but that should be a wake up call to every capitalist, why is the public investing? They want this stuff. Look at how well these Chinese EV companies are doing, look at Tesla. This is called public sentiment and it goes beyond current valuation. This is what people want. They want to charge their engine and stop paying for gas. Probably not more complicated than that.
Calls.  Aroused on Friday, raging hard on today.
Buyden said e-learning and zoom falls off a cliff.. yes.. makes sense. ok
bought HD calls and then the stock pumped. Out of all the call/put positions I've had all year that's the first time that happened.

Yes we must ban them
All the airlines fell, you can just check.
NEX, FGP, CPI, among others, and stupidly, CINE (the cinema that went bust)... But somehow I've got gains on them all.
The worse things are getting for the economy, the faster a stimulus will come so people suffering is super bullish for the market.

I managed to salvage 4K from my 23K bet and immediately put them into NIO 50C expiring this week. 

If I was down ~90% I'd also hold for a bit longer (most likely til expiration hoping some update occurs).

It‚Äôs a good time to BAN you that‚Äôs for sure
NIO may fall, but it isn't going to fall that far to make your puts worth anything by expiration; once earnings are done, your puts will be absolutely worthless even if NIO tanks.

Fucking gay ass dick loving mods, they're doing this shit on purpose to piss us off, I swear
Puts on China
Anyone else interested in GOLD? Share price has now dropped below Berkshire‚Äôs reported buy price. I don‚Äôt know much about the company and I don‚Äôt follow metals, but it‚Äôs interesting
One of my bear friends pls tell me where SPY is getting this retard strength from? Puts went from +60% to -5% in two hours
Just went all in on ZOOM calls since sleepy joe mentioned it. $500 calls expiring next month: I‚Äôll either be in 6 figures or account blown up 2020 #ROPE

Call spreads seem better. 16C/25C is the same cost as 20C, but you profit if price goes above 17.6, rather than 21.6 for naked calls

I'm getting that feeling too.
Buyden is pumpin US EV hard rn in press conference
Gimme a tldr, not looking through some autist transcript
PLTR making a late push?
Does Buyden really think a $2.2 Trillion stimulus will pass the Senate, or will it just be more of the same finger pointing and leaving the American people out to dry?
mainly the lack of intraday movement
Liquidation of Apple is just Apple juice.
Holy shit, this was the free stock I got in robinhood for referring a friend. Just it was like $4.00 a share and I didn‚Äôt know what it was and just sold it to get it off my Home Screen. Fuck me
I am telling you, you are talking out of your ass. Talking ass, quite a spetacular sight.
Holy fuck he is pumping EV market.. fuck
why boeing and not an airline like delta or southwest ?
Electric vehicles!!
My uncle works at NIO and he says earnings are gonna kirr it!
Very true, I bought BA calls in the morning and sold them 3 hrs later for almost 60% profit
Loaded up on tesla fds. With me luck.
Haven't heard of them, will check them out!
So far, in the last month or two, every down day is pretty light volume, and every up day, especially the big ones, is above average volume.  Sometimes very substantially so.
CBAT AND PLTR are up like 60% each, ugh, boat has sailed already

Stfu gay bear
I can't see how much more it's going to run, if I'm going to be extremely bullish here, at most I can only see the share price doubling to $100 (I highly doubt it though). No way it's going any higher than that unless they have some outrageous deliveries.

the premiums on nio calls are insane right now, the stock could move up and your calls could still be down
Hmmmmmmmmmmm
Sure thing leaps that don‚Äôt rhyme with smio?
I finally pulled the plug today.  The fact that it actually went down after that is a very bad sign...  Good luck - that thing has been frustrating as hell!
I‚Äôm holding.

bro idk why everuone saying this, been holding RCL puts since last week and its wiping my account, it's not going anywhere lol unless entire market goes red soon
Is it just me or are today‚Äôs NIO technicals pointing to an AH pump?  Average up all day, flat power hour, close at 45 support - tell me I‚Äôm talking out of my ass?

I‚Äôm talking about when these automotive companies were at their peak decades ago... EVs aren‚Äôt realistically going to sustain valuations above that. This is like how weed stocks were being valued higher than the entire market potential for legalized weed.

Personally, I hate the Blockbuster vs Netflix analogy because it lacks depth. Greedy activist investors killed Blockbuster, not Netflix. Blockbuster had Netflix on the ropes until activist investors fired the CEO and reversed all the progress he made in changing the company.

Utilize Think or Swim. It's a free program by TDAmeritrade. It has an option where you can simulate investing with fake money, and this will be very helpful in risk free learning about the markets.

If you want a steady, well diversified, all-in-one stock, consider a stock index fund like SPY. SPY is an index fund that directly tracks the S&P 500. In other words, it is tied to the combined performance of every company in that index. You will never beat the market, but you will never do worse than the market, because it IS the market average.
My thoughts too tho for real. Holding puts, so it should launch into space.
he‚Äôs an actual bear. i have a pet cub.
My vaccine is the owner of Microsoft and he can get you banned

Are there any poors in here?
Not if it rips into 100
Afraid of a NIO dump tomorrow
all of them. read a couple articles, use options profit calculator to see how they translate into gains and losses over time, etc. watch some youtube videos explaining the greeks and explaining how to choose options to purchase or sell. learn about spreads.
Lol at least I‚Äôm not the only one frustrated with BABA
Any chance blink opens at 14 tomorrow

Those are rookie numbers in this racket.
My retarded NIO puts just came back break even lmao. Should I exit or hold through earnings? 11/27 24p
Yea buddy, bought 200 shares at the bottom
BAN
Blame retail scalpers, those cunts caused this to crash so that they could enjoy some short term tendies. Hope if they tried it again, it will moon so hard they will regret for life they sold and never got the chance to rebuy cheaper
the most fun trades aren't even the biggest ones. I love pissing away $100 or so at 3:58 PM on SPY calls/puts and closing before 4:15.  0.01 to 0.03  = free beer money.

Daily reminder that BABA sucks fat dick.
I know, it‚Äôs an easy concept to grasp. Just like the fact that stocks only go up no matter what
Do not engage in options trading until you have managed to accrue at least 10k in your portfolio, and do not use anymore than 10% of the value of said portfolio when playing options after. Options are best used by serious investors as a hedge. They are extremely risky and if you do not know exactly what you're doing, you will get burned. Even when you know exactly what you're doing, you are still highly likely to get burned.

Instead of lighting your money on fire here, please review materials on the types of strategies in basic stock and bond investing. I for one prefer value investing, see Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. The former wrote a number of materials on how to conduct value investing. Stock investing is best approached not as a gamble like it is on this subreddit, but as an actual investment in a business based on that business's value, growth potential, and income.

Because we bought HD
this post has to be some troll of some sort.

yeah unusual option activity matters sometimes but this looks more like someone opening the Dec 22c awhile back then selling Nov 20 $22c against them but who the F knows

also, OI != volume
Bottom for the day, maybe. Lowest it'll be for the next 5 years, highly doubt it.
Actually i work in a chemical plant where the pp plastics are made for nio. Nio is gonna bulk around asia and the middle east. But who knows...

The media is gonna help Biden with an alley-oop assist via headlines, positive takeaways.   
I bet the stock market will pump during his speech. Why else would he speak into the close?
gonna guess it has to do with the other 10% who got infected....even if the vaccine still allows small groups to get infected, maybe it reduced severity and/or lessened/prevented the need for hospitalizations.  They'll slice the data a million ways.

I don't remember where I heard it but I heard that Trump has privately conceded that he has lost, however this is all political theater for his supporters. He's not going down without a fight... The whole country gets put on hold while this man gets to pretend like he's tilting at windmills , all the while he's just using this elaborate scheme to enrich himself.

Are you going to look for cheap stocks that will surge if a vaccine comes out and then guess when the vaccine is going to be released and then make a bunch of money on LEAPS? Because if so, this is absolutely genius and I can‚Äôt believe I hadn‚Äôt thought of it.

Gaaayyyyy
I think Tesla is not the hot stock right now in the EV world, Nio is the new king... so, time to buy Tesla. Wait until the hype dies down and Tesla release earnings and everyone remembers why Elon is the man.
FCEL is the best pick Cramer has given me this year my god look at it goooo

# they are releasing more info about the pfizer vaccine either tomorrow or wednesday. Get your lotto calls ready boiiis
Next week PFE will announce their vaccine is 95% effective. The week after MRNA will say theirs is 96%, so the vaccine pissing match will go on for another few weeks. ATHs coming

So... it looks like we are betting on the idea that the F13 filings show Warren Buffet investing more in the company. Lets hope he put another 500m or more.
Sandwiches? Mexican? Sushi? Idk
With this and Pfizer announcement, we now have two viable vaccines for COVID. More chance of vaccine getting widely distributed sooner (since two very different vaccines, providers, vectors, etc).  If there is light at end of tunnel for COVID - you will see Investor‚Äôs rotate from being super tech heavy right now (bc of virtual, perceptual of safety in a COVID environment, etc.) into the beat down industries (energy, interest rate sensitive businesses like banks, travel, airlines, retail, leisure, etc). 

TLDR, beat down industries go up bc people buy them by selling their holdings in tech (tech goes down)
Dump it

It's fucking bullshit that the IV for PLTR is still over 100% even after ER and only a marginal move today.
That's the idea.  LVGO is part of it now and they have a fantastic product that was doing great before Covid.
So when is the vaccine being approved? FDA said they would approve anything over 50% efficacy. I‚Äôm fucking tired of this shit

PLTR actually profited this year if you take out the cost of direct listing
rise
I mean I am expecting a LI type reaction, so there's that
So how are we supposed to kill SPY?
Considering the risk vs rewards, I agree UVXY or VIX is a better play than SPY puts. Low volatility environment is actually good for hedging since any change in the market may cause a spike in VIX and will significantly increase the premiums

Plower hour
Your fault for not taking that 10%
Obviously because the vaccine may cause more harm than the virus to a healthy individual who is at no significant risk from Covid-19 damage. We just don't know enough mRNA genetic treatments to say. Many people will not want to guinea pig this

In good form - I bought the weeklies...
What the fuck man
BABA
i like it that way, im the same. i prefer dividends because it makes me feel like my money is working for me. 

growth has been so good, but i like to manage buying low and selling high, timing tops isnt terribly hard, or at least selling after they happen.
It‚Äôs fine I had 2095 shares sold at 15 :) it‚Äôs fate
Me and my homies hate BABA
I believe it is FAGMAN now.
Now that‚Äôs smart. Now I feel normal
Youre getting downvoted, but that seems to be his game plan, atleast he entertains the idea. If the race would have been closer, like Biden getting exactly 270 electoral votes, it might actually have a chance to work. Otherwise even he probably knows that this will be nearly impossible now. It might very well his way of coping too, "biden won, but  it wasnt fair".
Someone get nasdaq on the phone and remind them NVDA reports earnings Wednesday
So glad I sold CVX at a 15% loss last Monday cuz I pussed out. Just fuck my shit up fam.
Ok baba you can moon now please
I am. Just wrote NIO puts during the dip this am
Dumped 200 and covered the remaining 100. It‚Äôs in an account I barely look at so just let it be.
BABA needs to moonshot, and DIS needs to drill to molten core. That's the tendie plan
Holy shit I have never seen 0dte Spy puts and calls being worth so little. The ones at the money are like 30 when they usually hover at 80 or so. The ones 1 strike away are worth even less about 8 bucks.
Damn glad I didn‚Äôt listen to so many saying buy baba last week lmao what a slow painful bleeed
Only here will +42% seem puny
Never double down on losers unless it‚Äôs only a little bit of risk
I‚Äôm not even looking at my portfolio. I‚Äôm getting the vibe of my positions through the WSB daily discussion chat
Look at the NIO and PLTR charts side by side
Dropppppp
Fuck you baba just go up I‚Äôm dead x 3 keep buying dips
lol
Tdoc is oversold
Vaccines are good for oil? Stocks that dump 70% in a year usually go uppies? Oil is not in fact dead? Take your pick
I might as well buy in
Well he must be green today.

You didn't post positions (if you even have them)

You flaired as a YOLO but clearly don't know what that means

You didn't do any DD besides "SMART F*KING MONEY!!!" (please realize those people invest in a ton of stuff...winners and losers)

You pointed out that there will be a merger (without any details aside from the made up sounding name)

I think spy will go red
Ya got a little greedy. Was making some money off of them in Oct so sold those and rolled out to a higher strike. Didn‚Äôt work out too well.
They‚Äôll open red tomorrow
Current results: I was 20 mins late after market open and missed the initial drop, but still went ahead and got 1k worth of 11/27 $89 puts. I'm about 40% down, but holding out for another 2 days.

Clearly, I belong here.
I just want NIO to close 46-47 today
Looks solid.
What's NIO gonna do ah and overnight fellas?
boring day, almost nothing is oversold or overbought
Because the mods banned the ticker, too small of a market cap (think that is outdated now) and also doesn't offer options. One of our fellow autists here bought 1000 shares at 66 cents.
Need to take a breather. I‚Äôve been getting rekt
I don't think there is much selling pressure under 3000, but I don't see catalysts for continued runup to 3600.
Energy
That‚Äôs how all SPACs are. They target a sector, approx size, etc, or sometimes a little more specific. Then you wait 3 months or 2 years till they merge with someone. This is no different. They all have boards you are either confident in that will find a good target or you aren‚Äôt. This one is hyped because it‚Äôs larger than most and people have faith Ackman will find a great one
Rotating out of my pocket into algos
Sabre, AMC, Cinemark, Boeing, all cruise lines. Jump in now while they‚Äôre low. Especially Sabre.
SPY is actually kind of hilarious to watch honestly
what a fuckin day started up 10%, seen -5% and closed at fuckin 0. literally 0 wtf not even 5 cents right at the zero. I really want a fuckin refund I‚Äôm not losing money for this boring ass shit
I gave you guys FUBO this weekend, I have another one...STIM.  


Do a search on Reddit for "TMS" (transcranial magnetic stimulation). It's the new, hot mental health treatment (in addition to mushrooms, LSD, Ketamine and DMT) for folks that have run out of options. And the pandemic has people losing their fucking minds.   


It's run hard since earnings and it's a 150M microcap deal. It's chief competitor, BWAY, reports this week.  


Caveat Emptor
Time to blast off PLUG lets go
Sell high IV and make ban bets, pussy

Made 10% in a month and I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way
IWM puts anyone?
Buckle up boiz

Not much.  Nikola could disappear tomorrow and it doesn't hurt GM that much.  GM didn't really take any risk in the deal.  So while GM may not benefit as expected, they're not losing anything either.  GM already rose and dipped back on Nikola and since has a nice steady climb while Nikola continues to slide.

TLDR on what PLTR actually does - MDM (Master Data Management - google it) is the biggest wish list for every single company right now that has more than one system in their IT stack. It lets you view one report/dashboard with data from multiple systems - Palantir does this and does it well. 


Im gonna tell you what I told a buddy of mine who's technological illiterate (as someone who works in system integrations)...

PLTR basically, as far as their most popular product, allows companies to consolidate all their data into one big view/lens. Why is this needed? Because as almost all companies vest more and more into their IT stack, the more of a shit show it can become. Most mid to large companies have around 10+ internal systems they use to service their customers across all business units. Hell you might even work somewhere where you have to log into 6 different systems each day to do your job. 

Reporting on the data in each of those systems even if they're integrated already can be super challeging - this is where Palantir comes in. EVERY company is needing this right now, MDM (Master Data Management - google it) is becoming the hottest fucking thing in tech right now as far as "wants" by the executive/mid-level management teams in companies. 

Palantir is going far.

Isn‚Äôt it obvious? This sub got so bullish big money had to sell. It wasn‚Äôt organic. Organically it starts with one persons DD and a few retards following him. The stock moves up then you see whispers of it here. Then it goes up more and slowly a cult forms. Eventually 90% of the sub is in and all expecting to become millionaires with their whole accounts in calls. It runs up for a few more days then the rug pull happens. Just went through it with nio I sold out Thursday when everyone got bullish on it.

What will PLTR be trading at in one year?
> at the current price. If the stock goes up you can buy it at the (lower) original price and make bank. If the price goes down you would pay the (higher) original price and loose a ton.

A call is in 100 share lots and they are time boxed.

You can make (or lose) significantly more on options.

Insanely low volume day
Not even close. Cushing had plenty of storage left. If we had continued to store oil we would have hit the maximum in may/June. Issue with WTI was complex financial buys in USO and others like it where they had to get rid of contracts on the last day. Thus selling prices at a loss and affecting the price to go negative.
My work will literally run us into the ground dead before they do that
Holy shit this shit is FLAT.

Fr though, the only reason we should see a decline in covid stocks is because there will be other stocks to spend money on. Covid companies will be just as profitable, they just won‚Äôt be the only ones anymore
imagine not understanding why it called beer flu '19' - market angle, this is a leverage game, imo. putting too much on a covid spike is risky, ok out
Politically it is Communist but State Capitalism is the driving factor of the economic policy. Companies are both private and publicly owned but the state also owned a large share of various companies that dominates important sectors. They encourage private businesses to grow til they reached the success of being backed by the state, it's like being insured by the government for your successful business. 

Read up State Capitalism by Joshua Kurlantzick for more background readings.
i didnt know u cud do that, but nah dude i literally have never deleted a post. only post ive ever deleted was done by automod cuz my account was too new.

My opinion is you dumb. Dumb AF
lol "even if"
Ah. Yea I've looked at futures but I suppose I've been too nervous to start trading them.  
I agree on your points on options, and that's exactly why I've started buying longer-term, though you find out those come with their own quirks in terms of price movement. I'd say just find whatever's most comfortable for you and stick with it. I know there are others here with large accounts that trade exclusively options or futures or some mix of those + stocks.

Bought $CSCO at 45 a long time ago. Sold some covered calls and the price dropped to the mid high thirties. Calls expired, sold more covered calls for December at 41 strike. Now they're in the money. If I let them get assigned I think based on the premiums I'll break even overall, but the other option is to roll them out to June at a 45 strike, for basically a wash. If they get assigned at 45 I'm ahead. If they expire OTM but above current levels I'd also be happy. If it goes back down again I'll be unhaps. Thoughts?

Not sure if it will help to repost from the linked article here if you're unable to read, but anyway:

> ‚ÄúThe restaurant was open for normal dining, consistent with state and county health guidance,‚Äù Weedn said in a statement. ‚ÄúAll of the restaurant safety protocols were adhered to ‚Äì and the guests followed those protocols.‚Äù

> Napa County, like the state overall, says that gatherings of more than three households are prohibited. However, that guideline may only apply to gatherings in private residences. Restaurants operate in a gray area and do not explicitly have a ban on more than three households, according to the last guidance California released in July.

Just bought PLTR based on this great and extensive DD.  Cheers to you for taking the time to research and bring these great value opportunities to us.
Thanks for the feedback, this is exactly what I'm leaning toward. A single ATM UVYX contract for 1-2022 because my portfolio is puny. It seems like a cheap play compared to SPY puts, even with low volatility right now, but that's my only basis for comparison.

Just saying man. I've been there a long time. Overall the company and management is a complete failure. Look at the 52 week chart. All they have is this vaccine and they are very late to the game. I don't see this as big winner. Based on the news it should be up 30% or higher.

This is a lemonade stand sir
After buying gme I started to think this was the wiser choice
Fuck your student loan forgiveness.  

I paid all of my shit back.  Used every bonus, tax return, and scrimped to pay it off for years.  You don't deserve free handouts bitch. 

I want all of my money back if it'll be handed out for free now.
Bought more calls, thanks
You‚Äôre welcome I want everyone to get rich here. I am a team player.

You LOSE Stark!! Ah-ah. You lose.
Yea but market sentiment from news being released trumps the current state of the oil market as far as stocks are concerns

If you wanna buy puts for a flip that‚Äôs fine but you‚Äôre fighting multiple vaccine and OPEC news stories as far as the stock market is concerned
I second this
C'mon aapl quit shutting
I‚Äôm just shorting the whole Russell 2000. What a joke.
I was looking to play around with some settled funds in my Roth IRA. No options for Puts or Calls. I purchased at market and placed a limit order at $10 a share. How retarded am I?

SOMEBODY HIT SOMEBODY
Yes. It‚Äôll end the same way too, in tears.
Fucking BLNK man
Let me break it down for him. Once the merger goes through the founder and share holders of opendoor will sell a portion of their private shares for the publicly traded company shares and cash. That's why Market Cap you see is not the real market cap. It is reflective of the pool of money collected in publicly traded company. It doesn't account for Current share holders of the private company Opendoors. Capish?
Cup and handle on spce. To the moooon we go
Should I buy nio puts at $50 or $40
Intraday triangle on vix
Just realize I still have 300 shares of SPG lmao should I dump them or hold?
If I had gambling money, I would bet on ZM right now, but I'm too scared to do it. My gut tells me they'll pump to 410-415 tomorrow. But I'm sticking with NIO and AMD for now.

Shitcoin moon, but not my nvda. Sad.
Good thing I picked up poots at the days high 11/20 $350 and $345
those people now have 50k to buy stocks
I am doubtful of this. Very, very doubtful. Something being possible doesn‚Äôt mean it would be done. That being said, I guess I am a debt free student so it isn‚Äôt my concern really
Blink is up 25% on an announcement that they put a spool and a spring around their charging cords.

Puts it is boys
Just so we're clear, Biden only proposed a $10k cancellation. Schumer is behind the $50k figure

I can see the bias in how he threw the cat at the puts. Does this weaken or strengthen the DD?
Well if you get up a significant chunk this week I‚Äôd say sell and try to get in a bit Lower. Unless it was hella cheap strike price then sit on it.

Call volume on BABA outweighing Put volume MUCH more than usual. This week's gonna be fun.
Keep those cheeks clenched and ride it, baby.
Honestly I think the reason is that it‚Äôs still early. Need more early investors in them fomo will follow.

Make sure to call them and tell them to lower their commish to .45 .. their app isn't worth .65
ZM calls are back on the menu!!!!! The fact it's almost going green after that BS "vaccine news" drop makes me think it might go back to $500 this week
every day for the last month has been the "bull trap" lol
It‚Äôs a spac. 

Tl;dr yes
That‚Äôs weird. Robinhood? That‚Äôs wild I say the volume shot up after it hit $12
100%

ü§îMillions of orders a second, but they definitely pay attention to only ‚Äòyours‚Äô. Since so many here think the same, every ‚Äòyours‚Äô is happening instantaneously, on both sides, every second. If u trade a shit ton. U will see, some go with u right away, some against, some do nothing. Market doesn‚Äôt care what u do. But remember: it is what ‚Äòu do‚Äô. Not happening ‚Äòto u‚Äô. Trade more often for more outcomes.
Is everyone ignoring PLUG is about to have a 100% gain in a month?
Every time NIO spikes up .25 I go up $150.

Wait at least one week before you fomo in at the top
Sir this is a casino
They're not really communist they just said that to get into power, just like stalin. They have a weird capitalist hybrid type economy
haven't laughed in a while like i did reading this. Tx mate
why not? lots of shit trading at 1000 p/e
Communism and capitalism should be seen as a sliding scale. Theyre communist politically but have been further leaning capitalist economically as of recent
NIO makin that move to 50!
December LI calls bought today, up 26%
Depends how much more they bought. If they didn't increase the position at all this play is fucked. If they bought another 500M this play is golden.

2. When do they expect to close for Opendoor?
3. Why did the stock peak at 27 and pull back to ~19?
4. Difference between $IPOB and $IPOC?

They got a new President too. His name is Andrew Low Ah Kee and he is from GoDaddy. Just look at his name then we know he is one of us.

Low Ah Kee = Low Are Key - Thats like Buy High Sell Low  lol.

"Andrew joins us from GoDaddy, where he most recently served as Chief  Operating Officer, driving day-to-day business performance and customer  experience for the company‚Äôs 20M+ customers around the world. In this  role, he led a global team of over 7,500 teammates and was instrumental  in nearly quadrupling the company‚Äôs sales. He previously served in a  variety of roles that touched every aspect of GoDaddy‚Äôs business, from  organic and inorganic growth strategies to market expansion to taking  the company public. Before GoDaddy, Andrew held roles at KKR Capstone  and Boston Consulting Group. He earned a BASc degree in engineering  science from University of Toronto and a MBA from Harvard Business  School.

No, but I‚Äôll come over and fuck your new PS5. For a small fee of course
It had ran down to 6 during March and just hadn‚Äôt recovered like at all.  Just market catching up, it‚Äôs not going to 20 but it was definitely undervalued at $6

"Yet this is not a typical IPO. The company is coming public via a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company). This is where a shell company first raises money and then merges with an operating company. In the case of Opendoor, it is merging into **Social Capital Hedosophia II** (NYSE:[**IPOB**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ipob-stock-quote/))."

What options would you buy to hedge your calls if we get in another crash due to increased lockdowns?
They typically don‚Äôt stay short for long, and they‚Äôre always hedging. MMs making their money on facilitating trades, not on the positions of their trades.

Also lockdowns.

Double bottom on BABA weekly chart? üëÄ
Aside from a few early drama and ridiculously positive premarket price (thanks scalpers for ruining it), NIO, PLTR and BABA are flat af today.
why the fuck is gme doing so well today
I could not stop laughing
because the world wanted cheap stuff, and they sold it
You can google that one chief.
How far out are you looking

PLTR predictions EOW?
Who is Mr nostrils? And what did he get right?

Did he buy calls?
my liege.
It‚Äôs been sitting dropping and sideways for the past month, it‚Äôs a boomer stock
RH allows 0DTE options now? Well goodbye to this week‚Äôs paycheck.
Anyone who bought that BJ‚Äôs dip last week is swimming in tendies. I got some 40c 11/20 at a huge discount and a whole shitload of 45c 12/18. Up 200% overall. Holding til after earnings. Will probably create some spreads before earnings just in case.
Bought an SPY 12/4 360/350 put as a hedge . . . . so I guess I'm hoping my bear ass gets blown out?
this is not a healthy market lol
Calls on ADBE and TDOC
Feels good man ü§ë

Literally a free 300 bucks from writing puts on the dip this morning. It would need a 10% + dip just to be exercised
Next week many otm calls
Joe pump?
Good earnings. Plus rotation

SPY nearly flat to the open. wow
Natural gas seems especially volatile this year. Front month is down 30 cents today.
1. California is going to announce their action regarding COVID in less than 30 minutes.
2. PFZER announced their news, stock went up but shortly down at the end of the week. PFZER also sold their shares once they announced results.
3. They urged that lockdown should be 6-8 weeks in order to minimize the spread. Since thanksgiving and Christmas is near, it might happen soon.
4. Covid cases are all time high for this entire month. Deaths are almost similar to March-May.
It's 31% of their business lmfao

Are you holding through earnings or selling eod?
what does Ant Group do?
Imagine worrying about short term PLTR price action. Hold that shit for 5 years dude. Don't even thank me after. Just spend your tendies sustainably.
Ah, makes sense. Just hold out, we should be okay
So is $IPOB the same company?
Fool me one shame on you fool me 1,324 times shame on me.... there will NOT be a 1,325th time!
Yeah the only problem is that I am banking on a lockdown. I am sure one will happen but its a question of will it happen before Jan or after Jan (Biden inauguration). Do with that what you will.
I need NIO to start going up already so I can sell by end of day and grab a FD put

Yes, they are actually making profit, which is quite rare in that industry
If it drops below $15 I‚Äôm probably going to buy another LEAPs. I‚Äôm kind of confused how we didn‚Äôt gap up after the news on these acquisitions. Seems like a big deal to me

Ant Group IPO was delayed
Only sell low
Watching my homeboy attend court on ZM rn. What a load of shit. I'd refuse. Give me another date to show in person
IV creates a spectrum of possibilities and the closer you get to earnings the spectrum collapses to less possibilities which crushes IV which then in turn drops the premium of both calls and puts so both sides are fucked

I buy a Stock for 1‚Ç¨ it rise to 101‚Ç¨. I sell it. So i need to pay 26,25‚Ç¨ for Taxes because i earned 100‚Ç¨ through Investments.   
Our Gouverment says "safe for your retirment!!" and taxes Earinings from stocks that high...
Big position in INO, leaps, shares, weeklies - waiting for announcement of DoD financing numbers after hours (probably) - this will be big.

Sold my 12/18 RAD calls for approx +50%. Rolled into WBA April calls. 

Bought SAVE June calls down at this level. Bought the SABR dip with 4/16 calls. 

Rolling with TGT calls into earnings.
Xi is mad at Jack Ma over the Ant IPO. That puts BABA in a really bad place.
Reminder that an ATM weekly NIO call right now needs a 10% pump by Friday to simply break even

Spy call two weeks out made 50 dollars. At the time my boss was POS I broke my ass for her and when I asked for some extra hours to cover my credit card bill ,she furloughed me for a month. Spy calls got me through my bills until I left that shit job two months later.

Ohh I think i get it. So if after earnings it‚Äôs up then people who bought puts pre earring Inc  will never see a profit basically and vice versa
Y‚Äôall talkin bout CCL puts need to get in DENN puts 12/18 10p. There‚Äôs no way it continues to trade at a 68 P/E
Lol did everyone buy PLTR at 16
I might be thinking about this in totally the wrong way, but here's my math. The low for SPY was about 223 in March. An ATM SPY put for 1-2022 is $34.25. If the market goes down to 223 again, the profit will be 400% based on intrinsic value.

For UVXY, the March high was 110. An ATM call for 1-2022 is $8.08. If UVXY goes up to 110 again, the profit will be 1,200% based on intrinsic value.

Crashes don't happen when everyone is expecting them.
blaming MMs is the oldest cope in the book, and super common explanation by pump and dumpers for why new suckers should hold just a bit longer while the price declines "the MMs can't manipulate the price forever". They were never manipulating anything.
Knowing GME, after this amazing day today it will probably get shorted to death and end 10% down tomorrow

This is facts, only time I do spreads is if my poor ass can‚Äôt afford regular calls. Robinhood also screws you on the bid ask for spreads so stay away if you can.
I've got expirys on Friday, you guys holding through earnings, or do you just have longer calls?

It still matters because vaccines are not 100% effective. Some people who get the shot will not be protected and will die if we let all the kids run around unvaccinated.

And it does kill some young people too. Not very many, but why let kids die when a vaccine is available?
*looks at chart* 
Seems like I‚Äôm set to fuck you tomorrow. Or do want to reschedule for today?
Can everyone please remember that Lonza signed a contract with moderna to be the sole producer of 1 billion doses of the vaccine? If you missed the MRNA train there is still plenty of room on board the LZAGY express.

Gay bears had 28 days of being right after 10 years of calling a crash.  You'll probably get 28 more days of being right over the next 10 years, but just because you say "Crash" 4000 times doesn't mean you are Nostradamus when it finally happens.

Its cuz earnings and other events trigger volatility.   After earnings iv usually drops a ton.  That's iv crush. And if you are holding options going the wrong way after that event you are pretty much sol on any real movement.    No idea how it works with meme stocks though

Going from a bottom of 3.27 to 3.91 is the most movement I've seen from NOK in a weeks time. Seriously, that would be considered boom town for this stock. That being said, I think the hike to $5 will take into the new years if we're lucky

[From the squeezemetrics white paper on the Dark pool Index, discussing what an MM is](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf)

> To understand, you need to know how market-makers (MMs) do business. Traditionally, market-makers make their money by ‚Äúquoting a spread.‚Äù This means placing a bid at, say, $19.95, and an offer at $20.00. Since the MMs have no position in the stock, the offer at $20.00 is necessarily entered as a short sale‚Äïthey don't own it, so they can't actually sell it.‚Ä†

> Now imagine the common scenario where one investor sells to the MM at $19.95 and another buys from the MM at $20.00. Knowing that MMs place short sales at the offer, we know that only one of these trades will be reported as ‚Äúshort‚Äù‚Äïthe one where the investor is buying stock at $20.00.

> This means that whenever a market-maker fills an investor's buy order, the MM is facilitating the trade by shorting shares. Thus, short volume is actually representative of investor buying volume, and non-short volume is representative of investor selling volume. It's no coincidence that short volume is predictably half of total volume‚Äïshort sales represent the buying half of the market, and long (non-short) sales represent the selling half.

> Maybe you don't find this convincing. What about those speculative short sellers? Don't they throw the number off? (No. That volume is tiny.) What about passive sell orders from traders who aren't market-makers? Wouldn't their sales show up as not short? (Yes. But they'll still be selling to a MM, so we would correctly interpret them as sales.) The U.S. equities market is infamous for its complexity‚Äïhow can we make such sweeping assertions?
Granted, it does seem that the market is too multifaceted, and opaque, for short volume to simply equate to investor buying volume, but there's a practical reason that today's market is more transparent than you might imagine. In a word, rebates. Here's the story.
Back in 1997, when the U.S. market's tightest spread was 12.5 cents,* the Island ECN (an off-exchange trading venue for NASDAQ stocks) started doing something different: They paid market-makers to do what market-makers already do‚Äïquote a spread. Whenever a trader ‚Äútook‚Äù the liquidity that the MM posted at the bid or offer, that trader would pay a small fee, and most of that fee would be given, as a ‚Äúrebate,‚Äù to the MM.
> As a result, Island attracted all kinds of MMs, ending up with tighter spreads, and more depth, than their competitors. Naturally, customers liked this, and within two years, Island had gone from 3% to 13% market share of NASDAQ volume. The idea caught on and other exchanges, public and private, started using the ‚Äúmaker-taker‚Äù model and offering rebates. So spreads tightened everywhere.

Posting this because too many of you tards don‚Äôt understand what an MM is. They don‚Äôt have any stake in the market, they exist to provide liquidity and facilitate trades across the bid-ask spread. Stop blaming them for ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù, it‚Äôs like blaming UPS when you realize that the PS5 you ordered from Wish.com was just 5 bricks duct-taped together. You‚Äôre the one that made the retarded purchase, UPS just helped get it to you.

You can't sell it instant and maybe it will take a year till its sold. Meanwhile you need to pay the payments AND need to rent another house/flat in the new City.

Because he is.... He's not banking on winning by popular vote, nor is he banking on the electoral college working on its face.... Trump's running a very smooth covert operation. He's banking on being able to pull enough electoral votes into being bad faith electors and keeping him president by virtue of voting against what the population of their state wanted. This is why Trump has not conceded - this is why he is still campaigning.

If you recall Trump did not win the popular vote against Clinton he won with the electoral college. Trump's whole strategy is banking on getting the electoral college to keep him as president.
What is a bear?  A miserable little pile of puts.

Well, tesla went down by 50 post earnings and they actually make cars
Wait w are supposed to do research?  I just go by what every one is talking about.
What are the thoughts on FSR? Will it have the retard strength of NIO and NKLA?
Oh shit, theyre in Jersey. THe reviews are actually pretty good though lol
I mostly own stock with some leap calls for now. short term calls may be good when momentum picks up
Get them sdc calls
Amazon would dip because they're competators.

You have no posts bro shut up
BABA üöÄgo green
Oh wow, ouch. Thanks for the clear explanation by the way
Stonks only go up
I‚Äôll translate for you idiots.

-2DEC35p means 2 less than December (which equals October), and 35p is 35% more than (p)alantir (palantir is currently $16 a share). This means buy shares of NIO in October 2021 when the shares reach a price of 35% more than Palantirs value.

Apply this to his other equations.

I‚Äôm saying you won‚Äôt if you have insurance
In low volume conditions without institutionals whacking prices around, they screw around magic numbers until you're convinced we'll continue up instead of break down.. and after hours the big push comes, after they loaded up short
Isn't that already a thing? I remember watching an ad for some investment app and the fine print said something like "90% of people lose money".
Press A to roll, duh.
Actually 5% more effective
Ok bears this is a democracy, sorry.
NIO gang, we holding for earnings?
Ok guy.
Yrp, given ts float the stock is kinda manipulated quite frankly

Still a very good deal at it's current price
Implied volatility. The higher it is, the higher the expected volatility of the stock (ie it pumping massively or dumping massively). It also significantly increases the cost of options. 

However, after whatever that caused the IV to rise is over (usually earnings), the IV will drop massively (collapsing the price of the option). This is called IV crush and why it‚Äôs a horrible idea to hold calls through earnings. 

NIO being at 235% is insane and ensures that you‚Äôre basically guaranteed to lose money by doing an earnings option play on it (unless you‚Äôre the one selling calls/puts)
Play all 3, they move together. CCL, RCL, NCLH.

Twitter got fucked on earnings
If it tanks, ima come for u...
Yeah, that sucks. Couldn‚Äôt believe my luck that it tanked when it was announced.
AMC was dying before the pandemic and barely suffered a large drop in comparison to other companies. If you really want to play movie theaters go Cinemark, which was doing well beforehand.
If they land a few deals or with additional PTs in that range it's possible.

A solid Q4 earnings report would do it however, I'm not sure when that'll be announced.

There is a lockup period that will expire in Feb/March that could cause a dip in price, be aware.
Must buy
Up on the hype, down on the fact (of something to that effect). It's already up, it will now come down where it belongs. You missed the last train, watch for the dip.

No it‚Äôs basically buying the right to buy at the current price. If the stock goes up you can buy it at the (lower) original price and make bank. If the price goes down you would pay the (higher) original price and loose a ton.

Why is nobody talking about Twitter? This is the most undervalued tech company of our time. Great user growth recently and bigger upside potential than any other social media today, by far. Twitter is used by professionals and the primary social media source of many celebrities and highly respected people (it's not just Trump, but yes, our president) and becoming more and more relevant by the day. Twitter is a totally unique social media and people use Twitter for more than just interacting with their friends, it's a source for news, politics, sports, interests and even community. As everything moves more and more online, Twitter has the business model of the future, it is a source for pretty much everything, like Facebook, only 23x less the valuation (as of now).

SNAP and PINS which have a similar mkt cap are up over 200% the past 12 months off relatively minor increased guidance. Meanwhile, Twitter has barely moved outside of its typical range of volatility, though it is on the verge of a breakout which I think will be similar to what we saw with Snap and Pinterest. Aside from user growth, which is bound to explode any time, once they figure out how to optimize their advertising (which is just a mess right now), their revenue will increase exponentially and so will the stock price.

TL;DR: YOLOing $500k into TWTR $90-100c 1/2022 leaps because there is very little downside and ridiculous upside in plain sight
may as well buy a few on the off chance you make it to breakeven ill have a 5x bagger

If there is a pattern, play the pattern. Why should the market let investors get a gradual price rise in peace? If it was that easy everyone would be a millionaire.

If you believe in the fundamentals of the company BTDs, play the patterns and accumulate shares.

It will pull back and do down then go back up and continue pattern until ticker is switched.
Institutional money usually trade before hours, and no reason for them to pump price to like so high and dump when they know retail scalpers will sell at that high and benefit from the pre-market pump. By high I mean two 8% previous close and 8% pre market. They will lose out some % to retail scalpers if they intend to pump and dump, while retail scalpers use them to dump their pump
The days you battle back to even from down 8-10% are almost as fun as the days you make 20%.
Makes sense. My account is over that as well but I mainly scalp trade futures because I didn't like the disadvantages of options, primarily being down even though the underlying price is back to where I bought. Been thinking of trading shares lately so decided to ask.

Recently though, I started buying longer dated options even if it's a short term trade (used to buy just 1 month out in the past and that didn't work out too well).

Because NIO is trading based on expected growth through 2031.  Gamestop is trading based on it going bankrupt this year, when Q4 (reported next feb/march) is probably going to be their best quarter ever.

You're comparing a super overvalued stock, with one that is so undervalued its unreal.  If gamestop traded at similar levels to their peers, they would be at around $55 a share right now
None of what you just wrote is supported by science but go off

The tech selloff due to positive vaccine data is a huge head fake. The Dow stocks haven't even provided guidance on their earnings--bull trap on non-tech stocks.

Na, this shit has already mutated out of the deadly version that was wrecking Wuhan. The strains around now (except that mink one) are more contagious now but way less deadly. That lung damage etc. comes from pneumonia like affects from bad cases; it doesn't just happen out of nowhere to relatively asymptomatic cases. Again if you have a strong immune system and are healthy it is not more dangerous than other flu strains

Cutting loss early I've had trouble with, especially on SPY since it has no issues going reverse on power hour and turning like a 1% red into a 2% green or something bs lol.  


I've some some condors, but I typically stick with 0DTE on SPY out of fear for my measly account.

&#x200B;

mostly I've been sticking with some conservative spreads on AAPL or other safe picks, or just CSPs on \~$20 tickers.
I have 500, avg @ 11.20, gonna let this one ride and see where it goes.

I position bigger and am more inclined to buy longer-dated options. I've just always traded options and I like the bigger risk:reward there compared to just stock positions... I'm also short-term and just... I mean if I'm confident in making a call why not lever up at a smaller $$ amount position-wise and take the risk? I find it acceptable for how I trade

Na that is just a few people that get a little overly excited.  News today isn't really likely.  This is probably some delayed console hype as that news was overlooked last week, plus another firm bought 3 million shares.

Yep!
my man u/bigchillinlat said "you just hold" and that's a big lesson in and of itself. buy something and refuse to allow yourself to sell it for whatever seems like a really long time to you. mentally deciding that you've already lost the money may help you in the early stages of this kind of thing. 

other best advice is find ways in your everyday life to develop mental toughness and self discipline by willing yourself to push through to success in difficult situations. if you don't have the discipline to force yourself to exercise or eat right or not jack off or not be constantly fucked up, or whatever it is that is difficult for you to do short term that you know is better for you long term, you're never going to have the mental toughness to hold on red days.
Amzn looking halfway decent in the last hour or so

You‚Äôre talking about CBAT... but even if you‚Äôre comparing Tesla and NIO, they‚Äôre in completely different stages. NIOs growth potential in its market space is massive, Tesla‚Äôs valuation is rolling over from its growth phases but the reality of the market is that it‚Äôs going to shrink Tesla‚Äôs potential. Every major car company has now accepted EV as the future in America, so Tesla‚Äôs market can only shrink whereas NIOs is mostly growing

I care because vaccines aren't entirely effective and rely on herd immunity to work. So it does affect me. Tons of people are experiencing long term breathing issues and other medical complications even if it doesn't kill them. 

I'd really like to be able to fucking breathe properly going forward, so get the vaccine, you fucking shit stains. It's not edgy or cool, you're just assholes.
Stay strong. Don't take the loss. Earnings tmmrw big money is about to jump in before days end.

RVLV has been such an interesting ticker this past week. Heavily shorted (with weeks to cover) and low float. Only thing is insiders keep dumping unfortunately. Primed for a short squeeze with some kind of catalyst.

Lol bull shit. Calm down with that pseudointellectual survivorship bias garbage. The only takeaway is this guy is a tard and got lucky on one yolo. He also lost more than 30% YOY two years in a row. If you gave everyone on this sub 5m to blow on options today then at least 5% of them would get the same profit or more while the rest would break even or break themselves.  
  
There is no such thing as "when the timing's right". There is money to be made every day, whether you choose the day belongs to bull gang, bear gang, theta gang, gang bang or whatever either you're on top of something or you're on top of nothing. The longer you sit expecting the market to magically become rational, the lower your mummy's supply of frozen tendies gets.

Thought I was being all smart buying BABA today

Turns out I'm still retarded
Look at the greeks on the option. The theta will tell you you're decay over time, delta will tell you the change in option price do to a 1$ change in the underlying and gamma will tell you how that change, changes. Basically, delta will increase by gamma for each 1$ movement compounding the change in the options price. 

That's all to say for 10 bagger you're gonna need that option to be well ITM ideally long before exp date so you have intrinsic + extrinsic value.

you selling WMT before earnings report drops
It‚Äôs up 2%... chill tf out
SPY 220p, cannot go tits up
Depends on the size of your portfolio. UVXY or simply calls on VIX are perfect hedge to protect your portfolio in sudden crash. I had a small bet in VIX calls and it made me 5,000% returns from Market crash. However, long-term wise it will trend down due to the reduction of volatility and theta decay. The reasons they are cheap is simply 99.9% of time they are losing values and will expire worthlessly. However, keeping a tiny amount in them when IV is low is a perfect hedge IMO

Lol - that‚Äôs how we pick winners.
Yes.
Ouch you bought intel calls
Bro, 3 times diamond handed scalpers wreck all of us holders, be it shares or calls. 

They've sold at the start of the day when reached $15.75 last Tuesday, plunging to $13.20. They sold again at $17 plunging it to $15 on earnings day. They've then repeated this shit today and crash it from $17 to $15. 

It's like this thing is built for diamond handling to profit so much perfectly and for us to just FOMO.... And this is coming from someone who owns long shares.
[removed]
Yes
Yes
Buying more thanks
Ban
Get ready for GME pump round 2
I love microdosing crack cocaine
Why isn't this DD pinned
Probs shares
Just sold my NIO for BAIDUUU

Earnings tommroow let‚Äôs get cucked
I have 303.
Aussies are always underwater
Why shares ? Loosing 100k with shares would take like forever
Are long dated spy puts kinda dumb? I bought a 358p for dec 24 for $800 and it‚Äôs up slightly but wonder what kind of event I‚Äôm looking for to get this to be a 10 banger. Only positive note is i bought at top but seems like this is a 15% profit play at most
GME puts now or is this thing gonna go full retard like it did last time?
Patience. Gotta wait for pop and IV spike
No, your workday fucks up your 0dtes
JD really not gonna move at all?
God damn, I fucked up bigly today.
What are you putting puts on? I cant see a red december unless trumpy decides to lock himself in the whitehouse bunker and never come out
what contract?
*daily
Not a bad idea.
No, it's just that everyone ditched tsla to play nio
Lol come on man share the porn
11/27 CCL puts

seems like it makes sense.  which is why they will expire worthless
Too poor to pay for coins
bought shares at 20.11 today feelsgood
TAKE PROFITS BULLS!
i got 50 40 or so calls depending on it
[deleted]
He‚Äôs already said he‚Äôs going to start his campaign for 2024 the moment Biden takes over
Can‚Äôt tell ya how many big gains I‚Äôve missed out on by selling too early. Better than big losses tho
Joe said you all gay. Buy the dip.
Puts on WDAY? Got it.
[deleted]
[removed]
And JD dip
BIGLY
If it‚Äôs covered why do you care, you are deciding your profit
It's the bare minimum yes, so you won't get banned but people here will still laugh at you though since 2.5k isn't severe enough. Everyone is desensitized. Click on the `Loss` flair and scan through what kind of destruction has happened in the last 3 weeks to see what you're up against.
Nio Civil Warrrrrr - I call being the Falcon
Ok?
I would buy boomer stocks and sell theta, and then out aside 5k for yolos
Thanks for clearing this up.
shares
stonks only go up!
That was the move like a month ago.
TFFP partnership with Pfizer soon
Mind Med coming right up!
My prediction is down due to increased competition.
JPow wants to show everyone his powerful tools
No, it's not usable and won't be for decades to come. Maybe centuries.

The first room temperature superconductor made the news a few weeks back, but it still requires very high pressure.

Now the race for the first room temperature superconductor at normal pressure is on.

The amount of progress we have to make for that seems insurmountable right now though, which is why my comment should have been read as sarcasm for the well-informed reader.
I bought puts
You son of a bitch. I‚Äôm in.
Sure! I m holding long term , even if restaurants r closed their products r everywhere and no competition
No, I have never bought Nio. I hold a variety of calls and everyday there seems to be one or two offsetting the gains from the others.

I have QQQ, SPY, SQ, NVTA, QQQJ (calls and shares), UNH, CAT.

I have to admit, am not losing either. But literally not making any money.
WARNING BULLS: we are about to crash hard...VIX big green...the daily is clearly trending down overall. Cash out and load puts or cry later
I‚Äôm going all in after ER. This shit is still in its infancy compared to Tesla.
EB falling off a cliff
Hope everyone is having a mellow microdose Monday!
Ah yes the 60s. A period of massive civil unrest, pointless war.  Sounds familiar?
he said SPY 500 by EOY
China Task force coming for your gains
thats what i have...praying theres a good eod pump today
0DTE's really fuck up my workday
Still up overall on Prpl and that is all that matters.
no it isn't.
wait for a tech dip of 3+%, and then get some monthlies

free cash
So is my üêï
[deleted]
still a piece of shit
I'm in on CCL puts. Need to makeup losing 40% this morning
NIO strangles for earnings?
For those with a less than $25k account, would you continue to trade options if your account was above 100k or would you switch to trading shares?
wtf is the deal with PLUG? this shit keeps doing up
tdoc
I have a crick in my pants
All in for that sweet dividend that will surely be paid out
Only 65% down? Idiot BANANABABANANA ABANANABBAnBABACALL
SDC might kill it today.
any time tech dips is a gift from god
No this is a casino, take your pocket change to r/smallstreetbets

That's what I was thinking. They're essentially selling their tech growth story.
What like wake up to 500 shares short on spy tomorrow like last week ? Lesson learned
IV is to damn high. I've got one call riding after selling everything else.
Any moves for tomorrow?
DIE SPY DIE
Definitely dumping lol
I have between now and 11/20 to see if it was big balls or just big stupid.

So uber is trying to sell their self driving shit and the stock goes up?

But this just further confirms they are only a taxi company...
Expiring in 2023?!?!? Jesus
Why isn‚Äôt NIO on the moon? I listened to half you autistic fucks and it‚Äôs red
I actually would if I could haha, but my cash doesn't settle until tomorrow so I'll probs do it then
WTF, its not even trading options yet.
Y not have a constant flow of pussy pics?
PYPL set to move higher over the next 2 days then fall Thursday most likely
Has to be a big move coming. It is a coiled spring -Could go either way.
show us your positions retard
This is exactly why I come here.
We gonna moon cause y‚Äôall got puts
If you‚Äôre gonna swing trade than get weeklies. Monthlies IV won‚Äôt be influenced as much. Check the vega on the options you buy to see how many they‚Äôll appreciate/depreciate on changes in IV
Yea i know im just trying to see if i need to put in more puts in if all these other states go into shutdown
Lol
Cmon PLUG lets refuel and pop off during power hour thanks!
it actually makes fucking sense it's crazy
I'm so divided. Covid is an awful disease and people are dying but it also makes stonks go parabolic and I LOVE THAT
Buy the PDD dip
Does SRAC look like its coiling? Expectations?
When is Biden talking today?
Yeah
yep. good luck! I hope it does good for ya.
Interesting take
Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time I let pussy ruin my life.

Then do it now
In your opinion, should I buy in now? I like BYND, but given all the restaurants being potentially closed again im not sure if i should buy in at the moment.
Chart and way oversold
I just bought my 100th share of TSLA today, so now I‚Äôm using it to write covered calls (FDs mainly) and using the premium to buy PLTR shares, then writing CC on that too.
Yo is this guy talking or silent?
Stop clout chasing. Add a zero

Why is your NIO red, mine is green???
Maybe closer towards end of the year, otherwise I wouldnt count on it. We survived it all.
It's green.

I'm going to bed.

And it's still green.

Fuck, yeah!
1. TSLA WTF! Been trading between 407-408 for 5 hours now.
SS Germs  <-- every cruise ship
Hand me the keys I‚Äôm drunk
Every damn week it does this
Done!  .28 per..
I feel like it‚Äôs one news release away from mooning back to 290+. I thought 280 was solid support but failed. I‚Äôm adding a few more 11/20 270c. It went straight down 14% from $300 in 7 trading days. If it can make back 4.4% or more this week it‚Äôs a confirmed piece of shit.
What are some psychedelic tickers? I‚Äôve been looking for some because I believe they‚Äôd be great for leaps (psychedelics are very promising for mental health issues)
Pls explain to a noob
These puts are about to print, I can feel it
yeah that premise is well understood im just fapping to the quantity and price selection
Spy looking like it‚Äôs breaking upward üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Why did I still lose money today lol
Is there a way to just buy the campaign? Don't really care about the MP

Was expecting $50 strike price, got rekt today.
Dont trust any pump or dump till power hour

Joe said to buy the dip or you ain‚Äôt black

No
Buy iron condor and pick up premium
Numinus
There arent any public companies trying this are there?
lol MSFT mooning?  We must be looking at different things.
I‚Äôll day trade or do 2-4 day holds depending..
Watch out, look up some info on CMPS' product Compass360 the psilocybin drug they have; it does not have a clear unobstructed path to monetization as there are foundations out there that offer psilocybin for free.
portfolio is bigly red today
Add another 0 to that then we‚Äôll talk.
The market keeps pumping but I am not earning any money.
I am in MMEDF since $0.74

GM - Big on EV and already established

APHA - weed pump

add an energy stock/index
CCL, EB puts. No brainer.
GE 12/18 $10c
What was your reasoning?
Everyone with shares needs to do that to prevent brokers lending them out
*Say my name.*
Heh good point. Maybe they realize their tech development sucks and they plan to license it from Waymo
Pay attention to how the biggest companies in America are doing
Probably the best DD I have heard in a long time
Close your 0DTE options 30 minutes before close.

Don't be one of the retards that ruin it for everyone because you're too stupid to understand what can happen if your options expire ITM.
Yeah I'm not staying in either
If BABA drops more I will be YOLO‚Äôing 5K into some calls

Short CCL now
Thanks. GOING ALL IN
I‚Äôm holding 1000 shares. Not worried
APOLOGIZE
Maybe, I think straddling is indeed the best play with NIO, but you should‚Äôve bought the puts Friday at 3:59pm and the calls at 9:31 this morning. Left a lotta money on the table there, sweetheart.
Is it weird when you listen to music these days that half the dudes are dead
More like all week.
BABA. thank me later
I meant sept., both will be killer
Realistically if you just put it in Arkk and turned on Drip you‚Äôd be set. Mabye get some leaps too
I mean in a clown kind of way
up 3% in less than an hour seems good to me
That's literally how it's done
Nio
GME whatever strike costs that much

Probably the 15c
It follows the Nasdaq but 3x leveraged. So typically, if tech is up, TQQQ goes up
As many SNE 3/19/21 $90c as you can
Li is hitting $40 today.  Let‚Äôs go!
Fuck if I know but hopefully by Friday since I just grabbed puts
Boeing leaps. That is all.
It is most certainly not better. My brothers skin is constantly itching and in pain to the point where his skin is mostly scar tissue because he is in so much pain that he is constantly tearing at it all day every day. I would rather risk coronavirus and die knowing it's a miniscule chance rather than be in serious pain all over my body for my entire life. I don't care what anyone says, I am never risking putting myself through that pain and the tiny chance I die of covid given I'm young and healthy is by far the preferable alternative.
Why do you sub to the porn subs just visit them when you need to
Hey how did you know I was here
Was watching CMPS for a while but I was warned I‚Äôd be diluted before I got my 5 bagger on shares
They released news today that they are releasing two tastier and juicier burger lines, so yes, I bought me a weekly call an hour ago
Yeah, been adding GBTC. Citi just put out an insane target for shitcoin. Figure it's a decent enough play right now.
Nice! Beat me to it. üëç
Long-term, Uber is toast without their own SDCs. That was their only plan for profitability. They need to start trying to figure out how to get acquired by Waymo or Cruise
It took some viagra not too long ago.
Pltr 16c 11/20?
[deleted]
12/18 $10c
Why the sad face?
2500 in options losses, according to the sub rules it is acceptable
[removed]
Ticker?
Lmao no way, no one uses psychedelics everyday but people use weed every day.
Yeah I got march 90c, and april 95c
Good thing it‚Äôs only $500, also ban.
ok
Makes sense then. Shift the focus from self-driving to anti-puke technology. Bigger effect on Uber's bottom line.
The percentage increase comparison is irrelevant, we need to see the correlation between the datasets. Puts on astrology.
Looking at porn all day is not natural I‚Äôm sorry

Congress is gridlocked, nothing will pass unless the market shits itself. Vaccines have nothing to do with it.

We won't dumpster fire our own currency even if we spent 3 trillion tomorrow. Zoom out to max on DXY. We're right in the middle of where we've been for decades, perhaps even elevated a bit.

Just remember you can only be down 100%, but up infinite%.
I think so. And not because anyone wants to help the poors. The economy is a debt-based house of cards, and the democrats have every incentive to kick the can down the road as long as they can. SPX to 4500 by March.

The risk is that gridlock in Congress could mean no stimulus AT ALL if Republicans in the Senate are inclined to blame an economic collapse on Joe Biden. Then no stimulus. No debt jubilee. SPX to 1800 when the dominoes start to fall. 


No idea which of these 2 scenarios plays out

Everyone should cut their losses on their BABA. Jack Ma fell out of favor with Jinping and was publicly reprimanded. American money buying the dip is just allowing the Chinese to drop their loads. The govt reprimand should scare the shit out of you. Part of the value of BABA is that it's so supported by the Chinese Govt. There are a ton more ways the Chinese Govt can make business harder to do for them now. The bribes will have to be way bigger now.

Given the impact that Covid has on our lives and the world vs flu then I think it's only logical to take a bit more risk with the vaccine if that's what's necessary.  As long it's gone through reasonable safety and efficacy tests and passed them then it's worth it, just don't do what Russia did.

What a surprise. They are typically Trump base areas. Not wearing masks, not social distancing, attending Trump rallies, all those things add up.
my moves today are waiting until aftermarket, taking a fat dab, and watching EV skyrocket after the shorts have filled their positions.

I will add that your strike price would scare me, but I'm no pro. I went for $280s
Lol same, one Green Day would be nice
the ones that sell near ATHs pretty advanced stuff huh
Seriously
üîµüîµ
Sell right now.
Trump hasn't conceded yet, but when he does, will we expect weed, green energy, and data mining stocks to pump?
Learned that lesson last ER, never playing it again unless just boomer shares
What was their EPS? I see their estimated EPS but i can‚Äôt find their EPS.
did you just make it dive to .05 again you little shit
It‚Äôs sad how true that is
Imagine buying carnival as more city‚Äôs announce lockdowns lol
Going down like the SS Minnow
No.... no it will not.....
Probably a slow fade back down to $29, not enough buy volume, nor really that much sell volume
It goes to 350 in the next day or so, imo
Theta gang on top
Vxx isn‚Äôt high. It‚Äôs about the same as a year ago.
no wait! one MILLION TSLA robo taxis are coming ANY DAY NOW!!!

WMT is in multiple indexes, yet none of their dumps affect it. It is basically a currency.

I yolod 11/20 50 and 52c right before Citron report. All I can do is clench that ass today
I didnt reply to you though
If I was a boomer I wouldn't be gambling stocks on reddit with the rest of you broke ass losers
If 258 breaks on BABA it's probably on its way to 250.

Well it's not like we didn't receive the sell signal from Mango when he tweeted that out lol
God I hope so. Would be the longest one in a while
Amd were flying before the vaccine news, were up to 88 premarket that day. I was still holding my shitty position from last monday today, then dumped before open on the moderna vaccine news since I assumed it would dump again. Then it jumps 2,5% at open. ffs.
Keep losing money retard
Can‚Äôt tell if serious
[deleted]
LOL, you can't make this shit up.
Don't sell at a freakish low. Bad
Nice little dip to get back in on rn.
No. Mango chyna news still coming.
Let‚Äôs see 355 today
Sold an AMD call at the top. Sorry to whichever poor soul bought that one.
I have 2/19 22C
Bought calls to 62, then puts. Today is a good day.
The stock would need to go up 12% for that contract to break even. 

Worth?
um, you both can thank me
He was no better than your average WSB'er. Legendary until his luck ran out and the YOLOs came back to bite him

Be honest here, what‚Äôs the most that you guys have lost ever? 5K for me today, fucken Nio and MGM. Bet the wrong way, got fucked.
Yes. The top is in.
For what it's worth to anyone:  I've never been one to post about COVID, but it is truly exploding in small-town midwestern areas.  I live on the West coast and it's not too bad here, but I have several family members in different areas of the Midwest that are infected and personally know people who have died from the virus in the last couple of weeks.  I am shocked at the amount of people I know that are suddenly infected.  Small town hospitals are filling up and ill-equipped to deal with the virus.
definitely dont buy them lol. you have to time it perfectly. i use it as a SPY indicator
theres a theme to the top 5

Lol no he would never help common folk out
Chokes on biscuits
I bet this recession lasts for a whole hour or two
NIO is a choppy piece of bullshit
I sold $260 puts last week during an IV spike

I am still up considerably but I would like to hold to expiry and NOT get assigned.

I might have to cut it if it starts to get too clsoe to break even, I am fine getting assigned on BABA but would prefer to wait for Chinese political tensions to ease
Don‚Äôt get sucked in, these crooks want you to keep shorting so they‚Äôll come out with another bullshit news headline to send us gapping to the moon. THIS COVID STOCK MARKET IS FAKE
Who made money on puts today?
Quit the game. I‚Äôm out. Waste of time.

Double down
Hoooly shit look how low the TSLA volume is.  This breakout HAS to be imminent.  Puts or calls???
But does it stonk?
In what way? They‚Äôre going back down just like they did after the last vaccine bump. AAL still has 50% of their share price to recover over the next year.
The chinese will dump their pets or worse finish them off the moment they become a nuisance to them.

Honestly, it depends how the market feels, the market feels very good right now, but I wont hesitate to sell 2 weeks before end of the year. It'll most likely be another kangaroo market once we get there.
I think I won, it was rigged cause nobody knew I was running!
Keep buying in

No
At this rate we'll hit SPY $400 before VIX drops below 20.
I swear anytime Donald says Stonks up BIGLY on Twitter you should just buy puts cause it‚Äôs usually the top
Anyone noticed coty stock is moving a lot lately

What I don't get is that ITM UVXY leaps seem -so- cheap. I know it trends downward over time, but spikes happen enough even without what we saw in March. In any case seems like an excellent hedge, but people keep saying don't do this. Can anyone explain to me why I'm retarted? Much thanks.
seriously, theta is a bitch, down 2.8k so far but bagholding just bc it's bound to do something once lol. luckily my other investements did +2.3k.

Stop it. It won‚Äôt happen this week.
I'm short on gas, oil, and energy.

I think they were overly bullish recently.
could get even nastier. I hope people aren't delusional thinking this shit has strong support anywhere. It doesn't. If it falls dramatically it will bounce back slightly and then healthy from there on.

I see huge potential for them in these verticals given the competitors sell video chat that doesn‚Äôt work well in low bandwidth hospitals and doesn‚Äôt integrate well with EHR
the future hardly ever comes as quickly as anticipated. think 'bout that, EV Boyz

Callllls
Ah. Yeah damn. That hurts the ego...try not to dwell on it. Those loses are the hardest to swallow I think - when you are right but talked yourself out of the initial trade after over thinking. I feel your pain OP. It happens though - at least your initial trade idea worked. That's better than the execution, management, and trade itself all being bad. 

Try to learn something about your trade management from this- or maybe consider a smaller position next time so you have the full risk tolerance to not bail on your position. Lately I've done smaller positions so I can focus on the mental management. Just my thought penny. It was a good trade idea though dude don't let the trade mismanagement cloud your confidence.
just hold it

You‚Äôre right. NFL and CFB college football were prominent. CFB was actually number one since this is Saturday data. But they‚Äôre ranked 386 in popularity

Why tf would you think any of those events have passed?
Why? They have a "dealership" in Studio City, Los Angeles for quite a while already. Always been interested what the fuck they are about. And now with more news that more countries announce ban on gas car sales (Canada today) i feel like this is the right time

Things usually happen about 2 weeks after I think they would, and I thought last week would be red so by my logic I would say next week will be a blood bath
Was buying AMD mid October before cpu launch gpu event and earnings the right idea?  My calls got destroyed when they diluted shares. 

How about baba buying after earnings sell off? You‚Äôd think so right ? Nope got killed by vaccine news and then anti trust laws..... am I doing something wrong or just shit luck. Down 6k with 1,400 left
Meanwhile, NIO is green

Disagree, it‚Äôs a measure of engagement regardless of why

i prefer leaps but ok
They do data analytics, they have high margins and are basically the only company that can do what they do
Okay, the only explanation is that a group of billionaires have set their PLTR sell limit to $16 as a sick joke.

Spy needs more lockdowns. Leggo
PLTR... is that the right ticker?... Was listed on the NYSE on September 30th of this year. That‚Äôs what I said in my last comment mr hyper intelligent.  

I didn‚Äôt say it was founded then. It was founded in 2003 as you said.  Its private growth doesn‚Äôt really mean much at all about its stock price. Take Uber for example... 

Also how‚Äôs this for DD. I‚Äôll tell you what; what I really like to see is heavy insider selling right before I make a buy....

I got in months ago thought I was smarty pants. I‚Äôm down 40% right now, humbled. Expected more of a break out with more attention from the market, because I see a Shift car on the street every day and seems like nowhere to go but growth into new markets... tempted to buy more. I‚Äôll check out the options chain one year out thanks

CHIQ

one last dip for the boys that wanted to get into NIO for cheap
Tomorrow after market close
Just says rejected
Do you think it‚Äôs a good play to get some calls for this week since they are reporting earnings ?
Yeah thinking so
Yeah that‚Äôs fair. Thanks for the input
Baba looks so good to buy right now
lmao sorry forgot to mention I already have these calls.. was meant to ask if i should start considering to cut my losses or wait till after ER?
My account = v-shaped üòã

Haven‚Äôt used webull, so not sure.
It's just a fact at this point.

Ccp is now the largest economy in the world. There population is huge and they are in a growing income period.  They have covid under control.



America. Much smaller Populations n.  Income flat or dropping.  No longer largest economy.    Covid about to break the medical industry.

Americas time has passed.  It's now the Asian century and you would do best to invest like it.

It‚Äôs a valid strategy (look up straddle), but there are a couple things you‚Äôre missing: at least one of those options is going to $0. In order to break even, one of the those is going to need to go to 100% gain. 

Which is not to say that you shouldn‚Äôt use it. If you think there will be an event that will dramatically increase IV (but you have no idea what the direction will be), go for it.
Im cash and buying options

#FCEL

WSB collective wisdom, enlighten me. What are your thoughts on FCEL?
amd has been pumping in the am and bleeding off for a whole week
That shit is up 50% now fuck me for only throwing 1000$ at it
This is more like RD tbh
Which is, by the way, not because they want to Do SoMeThInG FoR ThE EnVIRonMEnT.

They just realized (about 8 years ago) that they won't catch up with fuel powered cars anymore, so they need to wrap up that market from the other side.

Some Germain Daimler Engineer/Manager explained the context, I just cannot remember where I read the story.

As everything in China is state-driven, that story sounded as dystopian as you could imagine.
BYE BYE SPY
scary secret company made by paypal mafia god peter thiel
Set a stop just above break even and wait. Looks like a good day to gamble on those
Idk maybe because it has ran up $40 in 2 weeks during a major pandemic event and contested election with more lockdowns looming and no stimmy in sight.

Just a hunch tho
Philly and Germany talking negative.

may the tendies be green tomorrow
are they weeklies? Sell

are they monthlies or more? I would probably hold and hope (wait) for 350 or under.
Vix up
NIO not being retardedly up 15% is making me a little more hopeful that it's going to at least hold after earnings.
Government surveillance = Priceless
More like puts now
Locksdowns are officially starting again boys.
Because this is my gambling account, not my actual portfolio

It wasn‚Äôt more than double it was an additional 15%.

Fave degen song rn is ‚Äúdistance‚Äù from Beast Coast (Flatbush Zombies and Joey Badass)
Yes both. Especially 401k
It‚Äôs a government tech company
No one cares loser
Nope.  From Ohio.  That plant went up quickly and heard a couple reports that local governments are allocating funds towards purchases from them.
Haha, yes, i had the same exact thought few hours ago.

Tough choice really. Could sell before close for profit but I run the risk of buying high tomorrow if it doesn‚Äôt drop.

No. New city's are implementing additional lockdowns. Philly starts Friday.

Where my PLUG gang at?  Thoughts on EOY target?
DRILL TEAM SIX INBOUND
Will likely be in profit at close so I will sell. What should I do tomorrow and before tomorrow‚Äôs close right before earnings? Earnings will certainly be positive.
Yeah 20 calls for December sound good
I‚Äôve never had issues getting fills on rh. What about webull?
That's still not very patriotic
It‚Äôs called a straddle. If you time the option correctly, and buy back either the put or call once you see a directional change. You could walk away with a modest ROI. 

Good luck bud.
Anyone know what the China version of spy is?
c9 perkz
Let me explain in detail why I did this.  I thought I had posted it earlier but did not. 

Coty I belief is worth $10 to $15 just on cost cutting and $20 or more on new products. 

1. Largest shareholder bot a large stake at $11 to get to 60%, JAB. Today the Chairman bot another $150 million worth as well. 
2. Make up doesn't ever die just brands with poo marketing, Covergirl has been around a long time and has been mismanaged and that will be fixed. 
3. Less sales will happen at the mall and more direct and Coty is fixing that right now. 
4. Margins of the business will increase as company is doing a $800 million cost cutting move with the help of KKR. 
5. KKR has a $1 billion investment at $6.24 via a convertible they own 16% of the company so only about 24% is available float when you consider JAB stake. 
6. KKR paid Coty $2.5 Billion for 60% of Wella which is the #1 if not #2 player for hair coloring in the world.  Go ask your mom or grandma which brand she uses, chances are it is Wella. 
7. They own 51% of Kylie skin and cosmetics company, they paid a lot for it but they can get $500 million or more a year in revenues out of that, easily. 
8. They own 20% of Kim Kardashian brand as well, paid $200 million.  They can get that back pretty quickly too. 
9. LAst but not least, NEW CEO is a bad add.  She worked at Lancome for more than 20 years and launched some of the most successful products ever made.  Chances are you have smelled the perfumes when you went out on dates, hopefully, pre-covid. ;)

Silver and Silver Miners

1. Silver is cheaper than gold on all historical metrics and can easily get to $30 to $50 by June of next year. 
2. Silver is easier to use and better use case than gold.
3. Silver is used in car batteries and will continue to be used for the millions of car batteries that will be produced, this is how we get to potentially $300 silver in 3 or so years. 
4. Silver miners are now profitable at $25 and were not at $10 which is why many of them closed down. 
5. There are only like 50 silver miners versus like 200 gold miners.  This will change as many are getting funded and many mines are starting up again.  
6. Miners profits will explode as price of silver keeps rising, these micro caps today can be easily worth $500 million to $ Billion as silver gets to $50 or higher, very possible. 
7. Eric Sprott a billionaire has stakes in many of these companies and keeps buying.  Some will fail, some will explode.  I like to follow the smart money. 

 There is my thesis.  Why am I wrong?
I didn‚Äôt get IV crushed today, I just literally got crushed.
Look at vxx go hmmmm
Damn, puts from 11:30 would be feeling cozy af right now.  Just a straight drop for 2 hours straight.
well right now... they do be going down
[deleted]
Uhh what. All I trade are TQQQ options lol how is it a burner? I‚Äôve made thousands off of it
Bottom was some time ago already, been creeping slowly up for months and now with the vaccine news they have just taken off. Corrections will still occur though.
VIX is fucking skyrocketing wtf
Hospitals at max capacity you walnut
well ignore the people and just look at todays chart.
The question I'm asking myself right now is whether VXX is likely to spike enough at some point in 2021 to make ITM 1-2022 calls print, not even needing a real market crash just a nice hit of fear. Seems like yes, but I'm also retarted and realize VXX trends downward over time. Still, the thought though makes my üåàüêª balls quiver. 

Seems like a much better play than long SPY puts anyway, which are expensive AF, and a nice hedge while I masquerade as a bull.
Let's ignore all the bread lines across the country
What is PLTR closing at today
Someone had to spoil the party...
Rug pull CCL NOW
Bot
TSM! TSM!
What's PLTR doing?

*He's beginning to believe...*
Wrong. 17 year history as a company. The CIA was one of their first big backers. They've branched into other fields of government contracts since, as well as private sectors.
They‚Äôre directly connected. The higher the IV, the higher the theta
Nope
Gritty killing people if they try to lock him down
Vaccine news is strong enough
If it stays relatively flat you'll get doubly theta fucked.
0-6
needs to make up its damn mind
So everyone here is on PLTR? What are you guys thinking, 20c or somethin?
drill drill drill drill!
Stonks only go
Don‚Äôt open up RH then bb... it‚Äôs starting
Y everyone so scare of bat flu? Sum ting wong
Fuck it I don‚Äôt believe in this vaccine play. ZM calls
Im not rooting for you. I bought months ago and need to hit $21 to break even

Nio gang
I mean did you not know that GME was heavily manipulated when you bought in?
No, I try to make this a part of my life but def not all of it. I still have my day job and I do this a bit each day and I play video games a bunch lol. I try to stick to leaps so I'm not purely gambling my money away if I instead bought weeklies all the time
You sir are not smart
I hope. Down 30% already on them
That's way too much to ask. It'll fall after earnings.
I feel like you recorded it multiple times until you got the result you wanted. Market manipulation!
going need russell to crash and nasdaq to pump like crazy, thx

Those will print 100%
Is ER announced tomorrow after close then?
if it drops after Walmart reports earnings I will literally do everything in my power to put back in what I withdrew to play earnings. However buying calls rn is a bad idea. The whole point was to load up from 151-155 and ride it to where it is now, then hold through earnings. But last Monday killed my confidence in the fundamentals
[deleted]
Lets not forget China went 15x over the year with NIO. Going 30x over the year seems impossible retard
Next time... get tendies not become one

I fucked myself today by going into too many positions all going in different directions. Bad job by me.
Very different places with very different problems, yes. But I was just showing how poor China really is, and they're likely to stay that way due to cutthroat competition and waste.
I dont know why some of yall choose to hide plays from us when you post your gain porn. Like we win together or we lose together. Just post your plays damn it.

this feels like a market that has no idea what to do everyone just buying n selling random shit.

Sounds like a real snooze fest. Teach him the way

You know as soon as you do it will rocket. Always happens to me. Finally gave up on pltr and sold fir a tiny profit. And next day nonstop upwards

Don't forget to post gains üöÄüöÄüöÄ
One way you can play NIO earnings is by using LI or XPEV as a proxy. If NIO beats then LI and XPEV are likely to head back to their recent ATH from Friday before the Citron article came out.
Massive bullish flow for $64 calls this friday and $65 EOM
Imagine working minimum wage job when you can own a call option that pays for 8 hours a day of work in like 1 hour
LI and XPEV is like a leveraged NIO, jeez... 

Sell my JMIA calls and switch to SE calls for earnings tomorrow before open?
*360 fml
look at donald's twitter
Just means they‚Äôll decay faster as well as have IV crush. Also anything with short expiry will have high theta*

One call expring jan 2021 at 22.5 stock price, every dollar i goes above 22.5 is 100$ profit
Nio up almost 3% and weeklies and monthlies still red. Tomorrow gonna be iv crush like no other even if it goes up. Good day to get in tho
It still hasn‚Äôt grown under both parties administrations....

It did list 47 days ago so it‚Äôs public stock price has absolutely not got the track record your smart ass was insisting on.
corona does not matter
NIO in 24 in 24 hours
Theta and iv is pretty high. We are gong to need warp drive to not lose value
Since when are penny stocks allowed in here
Someone sacrifice themselves to bull gods and buy puts on PLTR
Post pics so I know it‚Äôs real
VXX about to be green for the day...
Godspeed, and add a trailing stop loss.
Honestly,  idk. At this rate, with no boom or dive from ER, it'll probably be a slow burn. I wanna sell some CC weeklies but the premium is pretty trash. $20 for a $17 11/20 while tying up $1600 worth of PLTR stock in collateral.
Spy just shat the bed on the philly lockdown news
I'm down 100% on puts. Lost $1 kinda like having ironic gay sex
Mango tweeted about the market being way high earlier soo...
Evidence points that their sales numbers are 33% higher than Q2 so I would venture they will beat earnings expectations handily.  Big uppies if they even post flat or a slight profit.
Calls probably
Go hard af on BABA Jan or Feb 2021 calls. Don‚Äôt be scared, buy the dip. No risk no reward!!!
DIE SPY DIE
Nice little bump there a few weeks back.  Proves even a broken clock is right once every 3 months.

LI IS THE NEW NIO
Yeah it's risky, but I don't think it's stupid.
Priced in
Thank you for the positivity, was expecting everyone to just call me a retard. See the thing is I work at Target, I‚Äôve been checking the store sales on the company device every day since my boss encouraged me to do so. We‚Äôve been beating by a lot. Other stores have been saying the exact same thing. I have dealt with ERs where people within the company have said they‚Äôre packed, doing very well and still the stock went down on ER day. So that was another thought that pushed me to hit the sell button.
How old are you if you make that much?

why do you think that?
Why PLTR at 15.50 so unattractive but when I see PLTR at 16.10 i instant nut and want to buy?
Y‚Äôall are seriously brave for playing earnings lol. Pretty much every major earnings has fucked a stock lately regardless of how good it was

Is the bottom in for most travel stocks? We still are awaiting the Oxford Results, which have been hyped as one of the cheapest vaccines to produce and the easiest to administer/transport. We'll probably get emergency authorization granted for all three of the vaccines by the end of the year (if not very soon).
Keep an eye on jack ma being back in public!
Sell before end of day
Only 1% of total shares. Relatively a small investment.
The amount of people shilling PLTR makes me not want to get in it

I‚Äôm leaving trading for 30 min. BABA has to be 260+

NIO 47 EOD
PLTR coming alive
Been waiting all day for a dump with vxx creeping, I‚Äôve wasted 1 hour of my life so far
Please do yourself and favour and don't trade for few days! The over confidence would not be good after such a winning trade.
Enjoy and treat your self for few days before you go back to trading.
Need to enforce bans - too many tards today are labeling their low effort posts as DD to pump some shit stock
I thought earnings affect IV, not theta? Does it affect both?
I kind of miss the daily covid briefings. Mango should bring those back.
SELL at close if in profit  
if you have several calls take out initial investment and let it ride,
And the drinking piss. Never forget about that one guy who drank piss.
Did it then proceed to eat the puts?
Nope got calls and shares, another day of easy money
HOW IS SPY NO FALLING
You too bro!
So risk is I kill my money maker.

Reward, internet karma? Ya... Not worth.
Well, it went down and I don't think it's getting back up so....
You must be new here lol. I‚Äôd sell now before stocks go to a predicted $30 after they have earning tomorrow.
If it breaks 50 before earnings then I'm selling but if not I might bag hold like a moron
It has heavy Chinese money behind it.  A rug pull then a quick buy back seems likely
Wow decided to take the bull route today. Should have just stuck to being a üåàüêª
Bro sell your NIO puts, you‚Äôre losing a lot of money rn

I simultaneously came and farted

VIX still creeping

Despite what reading Reddit would lead you to believe, most people in the US have health insurance.
alex karp makes me so horny
both. then you can‚Äôt lose
I‚Äôd take half shares out before close. If it goes down hopefully it comes out of my gains from today.
im sorry but if your not entirely cash right now dont complain when the tide goes out and you are caught lacking
Happening today bro
Penis is on the rise, watch out.
This is the way man. I wish the BPR wasn‚Äôt so high but given its IV it makes sense
So many pltr retards and shitt isn‚Äôt pumping
Rallying on vax hopes, I think PCG will get left in the dust once people see PCG is not the vax winner
You‚Äôre right that does make me dumb.  Or just misinformed about something I don‚Äôt own and haven‚Äôt looked into. I‚Äôm deleting my comments becuase I did make a mistake but you should know that you‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with the world. 

I am most certainly mot the dumbest person on this thread.

PLTR 12/24 $20 call.  Cheap. So I got in.
Is $INTC going to pull a $MU?

Go nowhere for months and wait until all the week hands are out then moon to 60?

Use that money and buy NIO 50c 1-21-20
good bot
while we're on the topic, the pandemics of 1918 - 1919, and 1957 were mititgated quickly (but with more lethality) precisely because it spread throughout the global population quickly.

we'll be dealing with elevated but not devastating case loads for a good long time to come, longer than what people are building into models. as usual, and as we saw over the summer, people will adjust and eventually view covid as a nominal risk, which will allow for the global transmission needed to selectively mutate the virus into another common cold variant level of severity.

positions: long TDOC, MSFT, AMZN
Holy shit UVXY about to turn green
I‚Äôd love to see SPY hit circuit breakers tonight for no reason at all the panic would be exciting
If Nio opens at 60 I‚Äôll pay for the finest 4 teeth hooker around for you
Was he not watching the market at the end of March?
Now im scared for my puts
LOL if you didn‚Äôt average down on NIO for the inevitable run back over 50 today into tomorrow. 

44, 45, 47.5 calls checking in.
I believe that's considered xenophobia on his part.
Nothing but red candles on SPY for 2 hours, has only dropped 0.34% 

#cmon man
now what üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞
In short, don‚Äôt fucking do that. 

You‚Äôll get IV crushed into oblivion. If you dont know what that means, you shouldn‚Äôt be trading options.
94% effective? That‚Äôs like letting corona fk you with a condom on. I‚Äôm in
Doesn‚Äôt look like it
spy calls or puts?
We did it! PLTR going to Pluto!
god that grill isn't even something a parent could find cute, and calling it a "Commercial tuck" is kinda laughable, a huge crew cab with a minuscule bed.

Do you think it could go down to 350? I may or may not have a put on the line

Thank you for your service
The stock market is 30,000 dollars? Man I can afford to buy the whole thing
anyone making money? ever?
If you take this loss so personally it'll haunt you. Move on and find another trade. If you really want to play fomo and hate yourseld think about how much you could have made with OTM Tesla calls a year ago. See? TGT loss on profit isn't so bad now.
More like cuz vaccines won't be available for a while
Pltr broke it
The parks can be liquidated for a nice profit. DIS is much more than just parks
What's the best website for volume data
Sure - but they mostly insure working age adults who are less at risk of dying of COVID. And it helps their LTC business (deaths in nursing homes relieves them of the liability to pay benefits)
Does that mean spy will dump. Or could the volatility mean spy is mooning?
PLTR onto 17!!
Are we holding NIO @ the close? That is the question. Evidence and opinions below please.
Time to start drinking? BABA fucking me and sold nio too early
Spit-n-spin.
If nio closes 50 dollars I'll be your hooker
Holy shit this is too real
it finally broke 16
ehhhhhhh... blahbla blab
Almost
finally PLTR breaks 16
I seriously doubt it will happen but i think everything will take an initial big hit due tot he crazy volatility the US would go through with that. So buy everything because it will be calm again in a month.
He's not winning "through the courts", in fact his cases aren't even being accepted lmao
No, nio is overvalued. Turn your attention back there.

Or pins.  Or like, just pick a fucking name and try to explain the valuation.  Get tired when people single out 1-2 companies when EVERYTHING has weird numbers attached.
Yeah I agree. The current valuation is ridiculous and of course I'll get downvoted for not following the wsb circlejerk but the current SP growth isn't sustainable.

I have same calls and 500 shares - might take half shares off the table it holds.  Entered at 145ish.  Or just let it ride, shouldn‚Äôt shit the bed too much unless they really didn‚Äôt execute on plus.
They will be in Europe by next year, US probably the following.  I say again, it is a long term hold don‚Äôt get shook out.

[removed]
isnt that the volatility we all want. Sometimes you need a Donald pump to save your positions
Only two positions I bought into today are currently displaying massive red dildos. My only saving grace is that the dildos managed to stop right above their 50 SMAs and my Fib support lines at the same time and haven't broken through either despite testing them a few times each and that all my other indicators are hinting at a pullback. Kinda knew this would happen and I set my stops accordingly but holy shit it's so fucking hard trying to suppress the urge to panic sell right now.
Really PLTR at 15.999992

I'm buying weeklies and I've made over $15k. Do your own DD, but I see enormous value in this brand.its silently mooning and people will wish they could have bought shares and calls during this time.
No, +11k after all was said and done
XPEV about to pass nio
I heard plumbers are all in on NIO and helped create the vaccine. Can anyone confirm this?
just listen and dont be a retard
Nope, Chinese ev bike company.  China likes bikes, worlds likes evs, tendies inbound.
I‚Äôm thinking of taking half as well, but the thing is my entire portfolio isn‚Äôt in WMT calls, they‚Äôre one month out, IV isn‚Äôt that high, and if I‚Äôm going to take a loss it might as well be on all of it not just half... and what makes it worth it is the chance of hitting 160 tomorrow, or maybe even more.
Working with nio. I waited for it to moon. THEN I bought in. It worked.

Honestly, they should never turn hard mode on again, easy mode for life. 

Puts or calls, you made money. That's a good fucking stock. Keeping every one fat and full.
he lost. bad.
I remember listening to The Economist‚Äôs podcast in January and one of their big concerns was that by the time a vaccine was developed there might not be enough cases to really effectively test it immediately. THANK GOD WE AVOIDED THAT.

I think you misspelled GME
In hindsight absolutely. I held through the worst of it on Monday and should have held for the rest of the week. Markets have a way of fucking with your head even when you know a company is killing it
Well those gains just about offset my SOLO losses because I FOMOed into it and lost bigly. I guess the gods decided I needed a win
NIO is strong. They have the best cars.

It‚Äôs Webulls way of telling you if you have margin calls or PDT flags.
This genuinely made me lol hahahah
PLTR quit teasing me
Soros is a big move Watchu mean? Arkk too they pick bangers lol

Ah yes, the classic quadruple witching circuit breaker
arkk old news...soros?
Sold 50$ NIO  11/20 covered call  for 300 bucks to hedge my stock. Smart move?? Or it‚Äôs going to 100?
I can‚Äôt believe had the opportunity to sell mRNA puts on Friday for that level of premium and did not see it...
Got boring they decided to switch to vaccine news now
At 258
PLTR is continuously Poseidon's Kissing my $16 asshole.
The squeeze happening on this is epic.  I would expect this to cross 17-18 this week.  I would easily see this hitting 20 by EOM or early December.  There is likelihood we'll see this eclipse 25-30 by the time the share lockout ends in Feb/Mar.

Position: 700 shares selling $20 calls for EOW
if the DOW is reaching 30,000 off the back of one company surging 1%, that being Apple, doesn't that mean our economy is fucked?
Based. All in NIO
Psth just popped hard.  Maybe someone knows something we don't

Can someone make an index of Chinese EVs?
Are you just saying that because it‚Äôs spelled similarly to NIO?
Fuk ur mom. Now.
How many times is pltr gonna teat 16?

congrats on your gains dude. Wish I wasnt getting bashed right now.
How the fuck did PTON hit $130 holy shit
But that's banking on people like me going hog wild and spending. I know I'm not and generally speaking I don't know if others will.
NKLA dump eod. Please and thank you
DIS looking really juice
I compare it to other car companies not to tesla and this helps with the fomo
What ever happened to stimmy?
I had the same thought! I think reddit in general is astroturfed to the tits

any other retailers that will kill earnings these holidays?
bruh I found out where shrek was during october

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNFx28NGLfI

Im spooked. No wonder my calls died that month.
No it's not due degenerates!  It means Donald Drap
Didn't forget Europe. Europe discusses C02 targets that can only be be met with EVs. Cancels exceptions.

People just kept tagging him and mocking his posts lmao. Yeah his shit was useless, but he was clearly a good hearted dude lol. Subreddit is savage sometimes.
It is all based on the black scholes equation (or similar) and has nothing to do with momentum.  The change in premium price has to do only with the change IV, not the raw value of IV.  Right now the IV of SPY is changing faster than the IV of QQQ so the premium changes faster.
So up 4K ?
Don't miss out üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Waiting for ZM to die lol
[removed]
NIO
Even in 10 years =\
OLED
Plus IV usually drops a bit after ER, so the premium will hopefully be a bit cheaper too
Lost money on all my purple calls BUT also bought shares... so I am up 40% on those.. and up overall. 

35 would be nice, but I learned my lesson on the options.
I think they're gonna pull back right after earnings.
Ask your mom.
Trump said it would be banned, that‚Äôs a long way from it actually getting banned and China knew it.
Big money is moving into PLTR. (((((SOROS)))), Vanguard, ARKK, etc

Watching that one position go up 500% after you sell them for a measly 20% profit is honestly more painful than losses

Nut nut nut NIO
Any $AMAT bulls in the house??
So either nio will drop to $5 Tuesday overnight into Wednesday and the chineese will laugh at us, or it'll go full retard and hit $60 by Wednesday morning..... is that what you're saying?

Not with their earnings date tomorrow
you‚Äôre fucked
Li auto is the most retard stock
I called it grinding today which sets us up perfectly for a nice big pump tomorrow to cash in on big tendies before earnings.
Thanks to Citron Leftnut Associates.
6 calls went down straight to 60% on anti trust day. Figured I‚Äôd hold as it‚Äôs baba my options have a month and it‚Äôs prone to come back. Now I‚Äôm down 88% and lost roughly 4.8k
Imagine caring about earnings when the stock is on fire making 10%+ gains daily
I‚Äôm still deciding. I would‚Äôve sold by EOD if it wasn‚Äôt for Walmart +.
What else would I be doing rn?
I figured the vol is high for a reason, so I sold 10 contracts 14p 11/20. Am I a retard?
I got both calls n puts 2 hEdGe
It‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs a sign to buy ALK... they killed the bear, Boeing only built the weapon.

I make money on real american companies because im not a commie insect

LI got that big d energy
Some are saying sell tomorrow and some are holding until after ER. For me I‚Äôm conflicted as well. I could see a big run up tomorrow and then a sell off Wednesday. But I can also see how XPENG & Li mooned after their ER and NIO could do the same? I‚Äôm unsure of what to do as well.
You dropped this üëë

hey, arr / investing!! So, anyways I just inherited about $10 billion dollars from my deceased grandfather (he invented the car). My gf and I (and our furbabies, I suppose) have an annual income of about $100 million (she's a doctor/lawyer for a major pharma company and I'm a pro athlete). We live very frugally and have about 1 billion in our savings account prior to our inheritance. We were thinking about investing in bonds (the safe choice), but were wondering if there are any other ways to possible generate 100% safe income with our new found money?

Sure but that does not change the fact that a brand new type of vaccine is being rushed into the public and the public at large should be aware this is not a standard vaccine and should be skeptical. People barely take the flu vaccine and that‚Äôs super safe and studied lol

People like you that deserve a 44 day ban
If you have a 11/20 expiration is just theta rape time at this point.
I never thought of myself as a üåà üêª but that sounds 500% solid
yes, but barely, why do you ask?
RKT go up you dumb fuck
Yes
buy $ALK too
I'm out of day trades, so I'll be hodling it until tomorrow. Not worried, I think it will be good then too.
Anyone willing to risk WMT calls, I should‚Äôve got in earlier with them going to release Walmart + subscriptions. I know IV is a bad boy, but my DD tells me it‚Äôs going to spike
Idk how to play this but I'm thinking about it

I‚Äôm shorting PTON now. Been shit talking this company but haven‚Äôt pulled the trigger. Going with my gut and putting a stop at $120 w/ 1:1 RR.
Exactly. This is a seriously unique moment. Everything is basically rigged to go up (barring world-ending type disasters).

What pump are we getting after this vaccine news?
This is actually the best DD that has been posted here in weeks.  Is the feline's name Jerome?
NGL they had us in the first.
What in the world is the Boeing play?  Why you hypin them.
That's a terrible comparison hahaha

Thank you sir
Watch you lose it in the next 90 days.

It has to be betting against the market. Puts maybe? I triple shorted the market and lost a similar amount.

That's...a really poor comparison.
Yep
Don't buy anything, got it
Greeded on over the weekend calls and went from +70% to -10%.

Is SPY headed up or down by EOD?
So just hope that it‚Äôs so far ITM that the intrinsic value makes up for all the extrinsic value lost?
Please pump BABA to 280, I said please
This is the way. Sell tomorrow before close for an easy 100%+
LI 50 EOW
Not in 20 years when people find out it just as bad to have an electric car as it is to have a gas powered car
Spy does not like 360's. quit forcing it to be here!

Nio buy nio shares I don't have calls nio I just want you to buy shares nio buy now nio don't think just buy nio pump pump nio
Idk, calls on Chegg?
Same sold at 320% could‚Äôve gotten 400+

yup, everyone saw the tweet, went short, market gave one final pump and BOOM dropped the hammer
F in advance.

You think it'll be two days until the ü•≠ prophecy is fulfilled tho? I can see this bitch drilling overnight.
do the opposite of what you‚Äôve been doing
Your profits would be approximately ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt fucking matter‚Äô because that‚Äôs in the past. Be happy you made over 100% on a trade. Pigs like you end up slaughtered.
I know everyone was expecting that last earnings. Any link to news about this particular round of hype?
NIO being $100 would make the company worth 120B, a third of Tesla's cap. It's not even going to reach anything close to that this year retard
[deleted]
PLTR flat until 3?!? I hope not
Ban
First time I‚Äôve eaten Burger King in like three years and this shit is fucking ASS man, worst fast food out there by far
What do you think a DD is?
Can‚Äôt wait for nio to hit 70 after earnings
It‚Äôs also an excellent point for the people who FOMOd at the top. Don‚Äôt fucking FOMO.

But what about all that juicy Theta value?
Hell yea fuck it anything can happen at earnings
I‚Äôve got 12.5 11/20 calls. How should I feel about that
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NO ONE IS RIGHT EXCEPT FOR MEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEE

Oh it's not daily discussion? Been here for a year thinking that...
tesla calls expiring friday. yolo boyz
LI though
of course, anytime i can help
CCP
Yeah, don‚Äôt do that
 Before. No way it lives up to the hype. Even if it beats earnings, and there is no guarantee it will, everyone is chomping at the bit to take profits.

Uhh... look at VIX lol
100 shares at 30 nothing crazy

what if... placebo really does work against covid! Cause again, it is the body that is fighting the virus that really kills people.
There‚Äôs literally hundreds of billions, maybe even a trillion, waiting to be unleashed the instant things appear to be going bad. It‚Äôs the ultimate stop loss. 

Describe a scenario where SPY falls over the next three months. I‚Äôm genuinely curious in hearing about one, if it exists.
People are going to or already have moved back to tsla and tech stocks
Lol

I'll wait till eod and jump in I think
Anecdotal but I still see this all the time. Also overnight s&p500 gains are like 6x higher than simply owning the index across the same time
that weird action last Monday with the vaccine news causing Target to go from 163 to 155 made me chicken out. I sold last Tuesday on the Ulta PR news. Then I bought Puts on the Dow. Went from up $1100 to down $420. Instead of risking anymore chasing TGT which at the time was at 159, I decided to take the L and leave the market again. Hopefully there were some brave souls that held through last week‚Äôs confusion though.
All my savings or 401k as well?

You probably need to tell this to Palantir employees.  Their blackout period ended this morning.  They're just selling what they need to cover their expiring options.  Give it a few days, when they're done, #stonks.
Always act according for your Personal Risk Tolerance. For myself and ~99% on here, the answer to your specific example is to üíéüëêüèº to expiry as we 'ain't no pussies
Fuck today is boring
I usually love asking my mentors about their habits, behaviors, and what they would do differently knowing what they know now. You want to lean on their life experience more than just their job. You want to follow a mentor that has a successful way of thinking

what makes it under valued and not on verge of bankruptcy? didnt they plan to sellsome fleet or something?
because it‚Äôs tanking idk
Always does when the dump starts.
CRSR position? It's gonna moon this week dw
CCL up 12% today. Natural pull back incoming. Vaccines are a pump and dump. Look at last Monday. Still no stim deal. Cases skyrocketing.
Hold for a year to get capital gains tax rate.

BABA calls unfairly getting IV fucked today
Nobody is mentioning how the TOTAL infections in MRNA placebo was .6%, eg, they couldn't get the participants sick if they wanted to. 

It doesn't fit the media fear monger narrative, so they won't mention it.
Y'all are going to be priced out of $UBER before you realize it. Just watch. I won't feel sorry for any of you.

Anyone playing SDC or WMT today for earnings?
You son of bitch I‚Äôm in
So do I keep averaging down on BABA or
[deleted]
I sold NIO at $52 yall are my children. Please enjoy your $40 dollars of gain & $300 in loss tomorrow. About to play out like Tesla earnings because you guys helped me pump it from $13 lol
the fake dump on R KT is not fooling anyone. Short squeeze coming
why the fuck is this pinned
Thoughts on CRM? I work with several clients and 80% of them connect their CRMs to salesforce and on top of that, some also use heroku, marketing cloud, pardot all owned by Salesforce. Earnings coming up too.
SONO the real sleeper this week
Biden talks live in 45min. He will likely talk about the coronavirus vaccines - especially MRNA's announcement of 94.5% effectiveness. With this he may talk about Palantir tracking more covid data - PLTR $17 by EOW.
BABA
AAPL bout to crash the market lol

Well pretty sure Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna‚Äôs vaccines will not need marketing as govs are making orders. Administrations will be done by third-party subsidies. So they will not spend much on these 2.
Do you only have three letters on your keyboard?

What the fart poop is happening
I mean if that were true their Q4 earnings wouldn't be in the shitter....

But you're probably right in the sense that the stock price is speculative on future revenue not whats going on right now... its retarded but this is the way.
What should I dump all my money in?

Am I dumb for buying gme calls today after 10% spike up? Do I belong here?
No. Probably watch a few YouTube videos before jumping into another one.
*352.50
Spy calls at close maybe
No 12.5 call sounds safer because we are not going into lockdown until ATLEAST Biden comes into office. Vaccine news is just going to pump us until then.
VIX running
For sure. Just was wondering how earning reports have affected NIO in the past
man, BABA is bleeding so much, no volume detected either, just kicking off all the call holders
jesus vix... creeping quick and spy tittering towards the edge?
Dear BearGod,

The account is still kinda blown up, send more resources.
Only thing dipping is option prices. Iv is out of control
Why on earth would you sell right now
RIP BABA I guess
I don't ever panic sell luckily, but I am investing with someone else's money so if i go under it would be bad
yo link?
Hold NIO call until before or after ER?
Ron Paul's suggestion to use the gold standard instead of fiat was tried and it failed. In fact, it failed again and again.

We could have a reasonable discussion of the merits of a certain level of money supply, but since you don't understand how the FR injects liquidity into an economy, it's not likely to be an intelligent conversation.
No MRNA vaccine news to save the market tomorrow...
2 weeks ahead of you bud. You wanna buy my options? With all these post it seems it may be time to exit soon.
What happens to WSB when people go back to the office?
Finally some good fucking DD

Anyone tired of hearing about NIO needs to shut the fuck up. 

When a stock rises and falls as often as this does it‚Äôs obviously going to be popular. Shut your mouth and go hang out on r/stocks instead of here with us retards.

I think Honeywell is a fantastic long-term stock to own, but not because of Quantum computing. QC is a huge long-shot for them, I doubt they will ultimately be the market leader. Their strength is in their building unit and the development of the Forge industrial software. If they can successfully pivot into an industrial-technoology/software company they will see some huge growth benefits. They have a very strong balance sheet and good cash flow so the fundamentals are there.
Too much competition and they placed too much brand value in kylie and Kim
If you bought 70c weeklies...yes.

NIO about to become the leading producer of Bear skin rugs globally

Bye PLUG üöÄ
Good thing pause was created
WW yes I will marry u
Nio is a hot stonk right now, take a look
I love how it's so easy to drop hundreds on shitty options but it takes me fucking 15 minutes deliberating if I should buy that item on Amazon for $100.
Let‚Äôs go XPeng that‚Äôs right baby üöÄ
GG BABA.

Kept averaging down hoping this trainwreck would eventually show some potential but it's looking like I'll eat a nice loss and be fucking done with it. You win as usual MMs.

You thought you were holding NIO but it was actually I Dio.
VIX is wilding TF out right now
Nio has cars on the road, are you retarded?
thats a false dichotomy retard.
Imagine EV gains for months but for every tech company and you have the dotcom
Welcome to the Q4 2020 Wheel of Pain: Vaccine day. Lockdowns day. Stimulus day. Vaccine day. No Stimulus day.

I have a month. I see so much interest in it but the action feels so bad right now.
I‚Äôm with ya at 47.5, hope we do well

Dude...

If you don't understand people joking about exercising your 50c options contract when you can literally buy a share off the market cheaper: **you should not be fucking around with options**. 

Not being mean, trying to save you from losing your money.
All this NIO talk and it's only up 2%. Meanwhile LI is up 16% and climbing.
jagx
Why are u a wanker?
If bernie was elected. Or if Biden got all three houses. Neither happened. 

But wages, loans etc still need to rebound otherwise there's nothing to stop a fall.
I made some money on the j POW pumps and then got cocky tbh I just started trading august 2019 idk what I was thinking lol
Dont buy it today, look for a good entry before Thanksgiving tho
I want to short CCL/NCLH, but the vaccine news is establishing a floor for them.
Gotcha, I‚Äôm not complaining
On the next episode of dragon ball z....
BA... to sell or not to sell

Just fucking go to 80 NIO

not all financial analysts deal with derivatives. there are many different functions under the finance umbrella. i‚Äôm more on the forecasting and market research side and so i don‚Äôt deal with options. not sure why you‚Äôre still so worked up lol.
Please for the love of god can NIO just wipe out anyone involved with it
 TLRD if the stock goes up, it goes up.  If it goes down, it will go down.
cant read that fast
Probably big hedges from funds owning it long

Why are people being so bullish with PLTR?
GME has been so stressful to trade MORE STRESSFUL THAN SPY SOMEHOW..thank god it passed 12 again finally and I just took my ~$300 profit idc get me out of that stock dude I switched to NIO calls and already made $100 in 20 minutes... 
2/19/21 $50 NIO CALLS PRINT INCOMING
Bruh if I held my free Robinhood $PLUG shares and sold today I would‚Äôve made 2,500%, that thing is a beast
I made some money on Nio and lost it all again so I‚Äôm starting fresh.. what should I yolo on?
I was having this issue paying too much attention day to day.

Just buy at a specific time every day/week whatever. Helps avoid some of the chaos of intraday. I have better success buying EOD, selling in the morning
Yea that‚Äôd be the best play
I hope so bro... let‚Äôs print
Stocks too?
BTI dip if you like money
Baba a company that actually makes money has been bleeding for a month. Meanwhile Nio which has as many vehicles as NKLA on the road is up 2%.
baba, u ignorant slut

missed eps
Tbf the other week WSB was positive by my tracking.
Honestly, I'm just so tired of seeing tech just slumping around.. MSFT has multiple price targets at 265 and this bitch is hovering around 215 for months.
It‚Äôll be back
PLUG baby!
I thought nio moved with the other tech stocks. TBF I don't follow nio. Too salty from missing the massive pump

Nio support levels: $1
Just noticed my NIO call has 213% IV ü§î
Position?
Yeah I see its a legit investment but it's just too 'bubbly' now. I'd wait for a major pullback before going in for the long term
NIO makin that run to 50
Best feeling when you go to bed depressed from all that gay vaccine shit announcements b4 market open and you wake up few hrs later to see NIO back in green and you get that fuzzy feeling in your gut. To the moon bishheessss

IV on Nio dying
[deleted]
Does this mean we'll see a short squeeze?


Stay tuned to find out!
I can try to break down the data like that.
Bro fuck baba honestly
It hit 17.40 in pre market for a moment
Twitter is a news source. Companies use it to announce big events and sales. SNAP/PINS are being utilized to promote individual items like clothes, jewelry, electronics, etc. So in a higher conversion rate, companies are more inclined to use PINS/SNAP to promote their products.  


Edit\* Also once Trump goes out, their traffic will most likely decrease compared to previous years.
Nio creeping up to 50.  
Come on baby. YOU CAN DO IT!
Yep
then i had rather wait and buy the deep on wednesday
BABA fuck! I knew I should have left the chinese stocks alone.
Too many big boys in it now. They actually probably did that so the big kids could get a nice entry point.
What did SPY go down on the day?
???

we're both bulls on TDOC dumbo
So anyone seeing anything on who PSTH might acquire? Have 50% of my IRA up in that ish
Damn, that's gonna print tendies
Look at this fizzle.

Spy really wants to go down
who cares, its your own shit. extra flavor if anything

1. Betting on Peter Thiel for the memes
2. Betting on US government increasing demand for surveillance
3. If (when) the virus gets worse, PLTR's COVID tracing offerings will prevent it from tanking
4. Recently expanding customer base to the private sector and has unique software solutions that are unparalleled
5. Big data and software solutions in general are smart trends
6. A ton of shares were recently purchased by big money (this can be bad but suggests a floor)
7. PLTR has for a long time been pulling top tier talent
8. I could go on...
Anyone playing TGT earnings?
DONT TOUCH NIO THE IV CRUSH WILL KILL YOUR PLAY
It‚Äôs being rushed because there‚Äôs a global pandemic...
So many unusual puts on BA. Is this going to the moon or floor?

Fuck AMD. I need it to be 100 by January
r/smallstreetbets
It‚Äôs crazy to me how sometime next year we‚Äôre probably going to be talking about how spy was in the 300s
Green all day then mooning after earnings dip Wednesday pm and maybe whole day then it‚Äôll flip and run for awhile
Im from the future. You guys were close. It wasnt PLTR tho. It was PSTH.

don't do it unless you farmed the IV otherwise you are getting IV FUCKdt
Lol, imagine thinking covid could beat JPow

I hate boomers for this reason alone. It's like I dont have GME calls but I hope everyone who has them does really well. Boomers would be hoping the stock crashes just because they dont have any calls in it. It's a loose association but it works. Just because you had to do it doesnt mean you should want other people to suffer it as well.
not only iser growth, but services offered. they talked about a subscription servicecavwhile ago and that would be very popular imo. like for instance right now, if you follow option whales bot orvwhatever, you have to join the discord channel because thats where the paid users get the live alerts before the free users. with a subscription service, therecwould be no need to have a separate disc channel since you could send some tweets only to subscribers
but why?

YOOO KNDI might just save my account. üëÄ I‚Äôll never give up on my 2021 GME puts.
U got played. NIO is a no brainer hold. They have major Chinese government support.
Imagine making 56B in a day and being down
BABA is really chapping my ass
Positions? Note that daily price movements are pretty near random, and this can be gone by the end of the day.
UBER is undervalued. Load on UBER.
Anyone bitching about this can kiss my ass.
Yes
Derek? That you?
Is today really the day to sell
Nio isn't a tech stock dumbass
When is TSLA going to stop being a piece of shit?
None of your posts have positions. Everything you say is ambiguous, so you never have to pick a side and be wrong.

Ban for self-promotion.
no but if you find out lmk
NIO. Not even kidding. They have an actual product oh and earnings tmmrw so we get tendies forsure
People still holding SPY 11/18 calls?
Lots of traders been talking about NIO always tanking before Earnings. That seems to have only happened on Friday. So far it has reversed that and is headed to the moon. So, what should we expect tomorrow? red or green
How the fuck are you a financial analyst? They just give those jobs to any fuckin retard with a piece of paper now?

Edit: stop deleting your idiotic posts. Man up to the shame.
wait until EOD Wednesday, give yourself a breather. Go do a bunch of your own DD.

Buying HD and WMT calls 3-4 days after earnings. They pull back 100% of the time for a few days after earnings.
exactly, feel like i missed the move. but i mean the growth potential is insane i feel like especially with all of the moves China is making towards EVs.
I feel ya. I like the time frame

missed out on GME already, not fomo'ing
Parks were 26 billion in revenue 2019. All of their media content combined was less than that.
That‚Äôs my position lol it‚Äôs a great one enjoy it!

BA will above 205
They get big gov contracts
We goin straight to 359 boiz

It is margin, and I do sell naked.
Well 5G causes Covid-19 üòÄ so you may have a point. Dumb phones don't cause no virus am i right?
Anyone holding BYND calls?
Yeah!
Bruh are COVID stocks ever gonna die?
Gonna buy some spy puts 2 months out. Rona gonna tank the market back to 330 by december
TWTR has stagnating growth. SNAP and PINS had huge growth.  You will lose your money unless TWTR gets huge growth numbers. They don't care about revenue as much as number of users growth.
Y‚Äôall thought NIO was done
dont get caught holding the bag, leave it at EX
Nice strike and expiry!
Buy puts on AAL and CCL. You saw what happened last week with Pfe. Everything went up and in a few days died.
The smartest thing i ever did was get into options
That‚Äôs the spirit!

I know this guy, can confirm, he holds Blackberry for some reason. I'm sure he's pissed were discussing this on Reddit.
PLTR is what everyone is going to tell you. NIO earnings call tomorrow but I'm staying away from that crap shoot
Anyone else shidding and farding rn? üëÄ
SPCE calls
You must be like 50
everyone says its bad that "people suck on uncle sam's tit" for money

but no one asked uncle sam if he liked his nipples sucked and thats why he pays

prove me wrong
Well all the facts you listed is why I was balls deep in calls before the topgolf announcement. There were rumors it would happen so I was in for 10K then it got announced and instead of me banking, I lost about 30% cause it took a nosedive after. We'll see what happens long term
just finished paying it off this year, do I get some money back?

You don't know how cats work, don't you? Inverse the cat! Puts it is!
what you got
Why is nobody talking about Twitter? This is the most undervalued tech company of our time. Great user growth recently and bigger upside potential than any other social media today, by far. Twitter is used by professionals and the primary social media source of many celebrities and highly respected people (it's not just Trump, but yes, our president) and becoming more and more relevant by the day. Twitter is a totally unique social media and people use Twitter for more than just interacting with their friends, it's a source for news, politics, sports, interests and even community. As everything moves more and more online, Twitter has the business model of the future, it is a source for pretty much everything, like Facebook, only 23x less the valuation (as of now).

SNAP and PINS which have a similar mkt cap are up over 200% the past 12 months off relatively minor increased guidance. Meanwhile, Twitter has barely moved outside of its typical range of volatility, though it is on the verge of a breakout which I think will be similar to what we saw with Snap and Pinterest. Aside from user growth, which is bound to explode any time, once they figure out how to optimize their advertising (which is just a mess right now), their revenue will increase exponentially and so will the stock price.

TL;DR: YOLOing $500k into TWTR $90-100c 1/2022 leaps because there is very little downside and ridiculous upside in plain sight
Vixx creeping
Sorry but you are fuk
Placing limit orders doesnt make prices "dive", quite the contrary. It dives because day-retards think round numbers are breaking point according to their autistic patterns.

Their ability to manipulate markets and distort stats and throw away people? No, I'm just here to tell you living standards in China are close to Mexico's.

By the way, while a handful of Chinese stocks go to the moon, most of China's recent market cap growth is from small cap and micro cap IPOs. The average growth of a Chinese company is low, and the markets are extremely volatile since most serious traders are autists. The current juggernauts replace previous juggernauts that fell as quick as they rose.
It wasn‚Äôt rushed out, mRNA vaccines in general take less time to make. It‚Äôs not like they were reinventing the wheel, they used vaccines from other SARS-CoV viruses and tuned it to COVID-19.
How do my 300c for Jan 15th look? Should I cut my losses? Already down 22%. I think I can sell it for a small gain if BABA hits 265 by EOW, but that is unlikely right? It's red on a green day.
was the bear ghay??? How do you get away with being called a journalist if you don't state these things to the readers?
BABA calls are looking tempting, it‚Äôs just they get so pricy at any reasonably long date.

PLTR 21C 12/31
What are some tickers to keep an eye on?

I‚Äôm currently looking at TSM. I‚Äôm thinking it might jump up a bit tomorrow. I have 3 calls on it going close to or past 105.
Literally cannot go tits up
Oooh okay. Makes sense
the coffee cup really got me lol
There was some earlier. I used my last 600 to buy puts 30 mins ago. Hopefully they print. I could use a win
40 SPY 11/18 $350p
It‚Äôs like taking gambling advice from a gambling degenerate. Welp, works for me .. I‚Äôm in!
This right here is your last chance to hop on NIO before the final +10% run up into earnings
Anything coming up to boost icln? It‚Äôs been kinda disappointin.. if I sell my Juan yarn calls now I walk away with a small loss.. I don‚Äôt know how much longer to wait
Thats the way to do it!
I think its the year banned, then month, then date: how long they were banned for and then how many times they have been banned for is the last number
Nah, 52c, but I bought in at the top on Friday :(
That‚Äôs a good kitty!
Yeah you are getting fecal matter.   

That's fucking disgusting bro.
I prefer PLTR to rise slowly so bears can sweat it out longer...
It so that when he becomes majority shareholder he can then use PLTR to find all of Biden‚Äôs emails so that he can win the election.

He is beginning to believe
also looks like that afternoon pre er run up is starting let's gooo

My entire portfolio is green today.  
I think that's the first time since March that this has happened.
I like the look of spy 365p 11/25
I've been gone for a while, but NIO 12/18 70C might be special enough to jump back in
Great, man. Now just liquidate all that, pay yourself a bit, then invest the rest in a long term portfolio that you don't touch and thank yourself in 10,20,30 years.

Been trading FB on and off for 2.5 years. When it was up at 300ish I thought it was overpriced and saw the dip coming so didn‚Äôt buy then I told myself if it hit 250 again I would buy calls and it hit 250 soon after that and I was too scared to buy but wish I did. If you‚Äôre gonna do it now wouldn‚Äôt be a terrible time in my opinion. But I personally don‚Äôt have any calls at the moment
yea like i said those feds got the kid into a perjury trap like they did Flynn. Pretty standard

No one tell him
None of what you're saying matters.

SPY had a large number of stocks but many are generally flat with small boosts and companies expected to gradually continue growing from march lows are higher.

QQQ has tech which also has growth potential but also has many heavy swing stocks that can screw the average which is why if not flat green and red days barely move by $2 or more, and when SPY has a heavy green day like 8+ QQQ doesn't necessarily follow and may up at only 5 or lower, flat, or in some cases red since QQQ focuses on two primary types of stocks, so at times SPY may have categories that swing the ETF high that are barely or not, in QQQ.

On the plus side when QQQ swings it swings hard so if you call it right you can have big benefits, which is why it's as high as it is now due to dupes going high on tech and stay at home stocks but QQQ is starting to lose it's growth and may crash soon but may have a few more swings, I would wait until the election certification deadline in 1.5 weeks since and I think QQQ will course correct to a more normal number and that's when you should switch to SPY.

&#x200B;

As a bonus DIA is basically SPY but with less assets invovled so it swings heavily in both directions which could be great or horrifying depending on your position and it hasn't over grown it's premarch high unlike the other two.

Is palantir a true meme stock or a pump and dump? Seems like a true meme

Today‚Äôs a shit day. Gone back to cash. Was going to stick it all on PLTR but not even feeling that now.
That seems unrealistic to be honest I‚Äôve been since 4$  12c . The problem with gme that I see is that they are not getting enough consoles to sell don‚Äôt know the reason but I went to buy the consoles and they have only 4 for people on the line that seems crazy

General reminder that if you‚Äôre playing anything but theta for NIO earnings you are literally too dumb to function. IV is so high you‚Äôre guaranteed to get crushed.
Better than me. This morning I thought to myself that BA was overbought and was due for a short term pull back so let's buy some puts.
Because NIO is unstoppable.
Smile direct club (SDC) will beat. Earnings today AH. Nobody looking at it, but I know people who have been getting their teeth fixed over quarantine. Contactless and through the mail. Low market cap, technically perfect play. Currently riding support, will zoom later today and after hours.

I mean, wouldn‚Äôt you call this a massive run for NIO as well?
Killing it today
The fuvk did you buy? 60c?
I see why they say being theta gang is like picking up pennies in front of a steam roller.
You guys will jump into NIO after it‚Äôs up 800%, yet will wait for a pullback from value stocks before getting in..
I know. That 20% jump in one day made it hard to get in. So I'm waiting

After Moderna today I don‚Äôt expect this to make stocks move any more, probably just cementing the end of covid-era trading in about 6 months.

Pltr is controlling its price since listing. Calculated jump and steady, which is a good indication.
  
Nio is heavy in the green, down from Friday highs - that if you had lucky timing you shorted for profit and re-entered. 
  
Gme action!
  
CRSP, moderna tendies.
  
War companies ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Hope you make some good money. I sold at a solid 10% gain during the downtrend just now. At this point it could keep printing but the volume might drive the stock price back up. Who knows .
Is your all time positive or negative and by how much?
Hehe, one says dick.
Lol I didn't buy on Friday because the IV was sooooooo stupidly high I knew there would be IV crush. Tough.
Ultimately the blame is in the people making the trade, but it's undeniable that this subreddit encourages high-risk trades that are statistically weighted towards losing money
What time is spy scheduled to moon?
IV crush on NIO calls.
Lucky for the market those people already own zero stocks so they can‚Äôt sell to pay bills
Remember that trump tweeted
Why are we mooning?!

Shh~ Can you shut the fuck up? I need this thing to go higher.
Literally. Boggled my mind that all I see are people on this sub whining about how much money they‚Äôre losing. Like c‚Äômon this game could not be any easier..

No problem. I think CCL puts are a good speculation bet. I‚Äôll give you a little golden nugget, not sure if this means much. CCL hasn‚Äôt communicated any sailing guidelines to their wedding planners, and wedding planners need to know guidelines since they book wedding cruises. Take that as you will. Didn‚Äôt include in my post because I have no way to prove it. If you read a certain comment I left on this post you‚Äôll understand why I know this‚úåüèª

Expected move on NIO is like 15%, good luck options holders.
Thanks man. Really grab a drink but that is not the way.

Neither, just hoping your read the posting guidelines before shitting the place up again.
BABA 300c 12/11/20. I know BABA will hit 300 next year again but right now so many things point towards a slow rebound. Rotation out of tech, vaccine news, and the uncertainty regarding Jack Ma and the CCP. Just feel like the deck is stacked against BABA.

yeah i have one weekly call but i also have around 15 shares. should i just hold the shares for a couple years or sell before er and buy the dip tomorrow? i'm stressing lol

China will have a serious oil crisis in 10 years if they don‚Äôt go big in EV. That is why there‚Äôs such a push for it now. They made a regulation by 2025 over 20% of all cars have to be EV. They have as many drivers as the entire US population. Long term EV investments in China will have serious gains. We‚Äôre already seeing it now. Look at CBAT as well.
it would make sense to sell your 290 baba call and not buy baba.

Anyone thinking NIO calls gonna be a 10 bagger after ER have never seen the soul crushing cycle of WSB newbies waking up, see stonk is up 30% but IV is down so they make no money. That, or the company beats earnings and then nosedives. Either way I have yet to see a play on ER that brings home the bacon.
Well that was a dissapointment. As of right now we're exactly where we left off on friday...
quick load up on raytheon
I didn't realize PLUG isn't an EV company until after I went all-in. This is the way.

A couple months ago I had a bunch of stock from oxy.  It was bleeding badly and I sold a bunch to make the red go away.  If I had held I would be a ten thousandaire today.  My gains would be in the 30s instead of like 5 percent.  Never sell red is the lesson I learned.
Not necessarily man, sometimes kids strive to be the exact opposite their parents. But you should be able to pick up on that vibe before you ring her

Looks like everyone here is so bullish on BABA, and expecting a reversal doesn't look that is going happen. Inverse WSB.
who even follows his tweets anymore
Thank you cool guy!
YoloCapitalMgmt is such a deranged degenerate, i love that man.

PSTH has the highest risk reward ratio. Minimal downside, plus you have tons of big boy institutions going in BIG.

They must have some sort of inside information, you don‚Äôt go in that big without knowing something. Me thinks they signed a deal with Stripe already and are waiting to announce.

Stripe keeps hiring for SOX positions and TONS of other positions so that‚Äôs a giveaway
BABA 300c 12/11/20. Don‚Äôt see it going down anymore like it did last week but don‚Äôt see a drastic move upwards with the uncertainty regarding Jack Ma and the CCP. Add in the rotation out of tech and lockdowns looming and BABA just doesn‚Äôt look good in the long term.
shit its looking very promising.. Might have to buy some calls
Value needs a pullback so I can get in
yes. and it probably means ur gf is masking her true nature from you. big red flag

I'm gunna go get some booze and cigarettes you fuckers better not let nio tank while I'm gone
I agree - I bought NIO shares and leaps after reading a review of the NIO car on a UK car review website - where they talked about how well-made it was with attention to detail. And then watched interviews with Li Bing and he seemed very reasonable with a clear vision and roadmap for NIO.
I still can't believe there is an ETF called MOON

Would it make sense to sell my 290$ baba calls for 1/15/21 at a 30% loss and roll the remaining money out to $290 3/19/21?
Elon fucked me on 3D printers, he jerked me off and then just left me with a worthless call.

Lame
You're joking, but they are actually. Fed increased leverage ratios a few months ago when the market stopped going up. I can't remember the exact amount but it added another 10-15% leverage, just enough for the market to reach ATH again if everyone fully leveraged up using the new rules.

Pfizer is boomer stock, company is so huge that the COVID vaccine is not really that big a part of their business. It's not like Moderna where that's their only drug.

Plus Moderna vaccine is more effective (based on the tiny sample size at least) and doesn't have the cold storage limitation (honestly weird to me considering they're both mRNA vaccines IIRC and RNA is notorious for just degrading all the time)

what is the reason that PLTR will pump bigly? everyone just keeps saying it will but i can't tell if anyone's done any dd
It will. Bill Gates and his team have been modeling it very well. Not only this terrorist are likely to engineers or steal bioweapons in the future. They now know pandemics cause more economics damage than any conventional weapon or plane crash.
Sold today to take gains. Plan on buying back my position when it goes back down. No news or anything came out today so not sure what‚Äôs up with that. Then it‚Äôs long till earnings.

Bulls won‚Äôt give up on PLTR
There cars a are shitüò≠üò≠ so slow they can‚Äôt even run on the freeway in usa
aways do opposite what the news tells you
Just gotta figure out what will be the meme stock before it‚Äôs memeing. 

I was in dkng, mgm and pltr early. It‚Äôs fun, just gotta read the room, and don‚Äôt chase.
I think you mean IV but ok
Lol Im so shook after eating an 8k loss at open that now Im taking 100-200 profit on day trades
Just joking
FCEL $4 calls
idc how repetitive the posts with animals picking stocks are i always love them lmao

I know little about driving and cars in the cold but remember a YouTube channel about a Finnish guy living in Siberia, and I think a couple of his trucks had gas powered heater motors for the diesel. Is that a thing in Alaska as well?

been holding BA since forever at $148, think its time to sell and buy the dipüßê
That's essentially what I've been doing and it's a 25/75 whether I make money or not.
Haha uh huh.
Earnings surprises are like surprise sex for theta i.e. RAPE
I followed you on this. 30 qty 17C
BABA too, so it would rise.
What would the share prices be if they really do that
Playing earning is basically a crap shoot right now. Terrible earnings have mooned and great earnings have dropped like a rock.
This is gunna print
impact is small for Ebay
impact of new console cycle is HUGE for GME.

There is a reason why an ex is an ex
Theoretically my deep ITM May calls on NIO shouldn't be affected much from IV crush....right...
He‚Äôs shy and reserved and scared of internet trolls like you. In all honesty he has some good reasons to hold onto it.  We literally got in a fist fight over it the other day and a serious wrestling match a few weeks ago. I kept telling him to hold and he keeps wanting to sell so he body slammed me then I hit him with a chair before I gave him the rock bottom.

Their market cap is low af for just buying the rest of top golf. I know they‚Äôre doubling their shares, but they‚Äôre 2x - 4xing their value with top golf. 

Especially if you consider their potential upside. Ceo wants Callaway to be the peloton of golf. What would that mean? To me, it would be golf simulators in country clubs and homes. 

Golf is only going to get bigger. It‚Äôs getting very popular amongst younger people...which is good because it is a lifelong sport. As younger people get older they will have more money to spend on hobbies, etc.
so spy is running on 60 percent relative volume today on a 200 day average. calm before the storm?
Party at mine tonight if Dow hits 30k
Nah bro. Green like the logo
Why is fossil the watch company up 17% today and 40+% this week? The fuck
What do you not get about short term? Look at the previous bump up cause of vaccine news .... if you bought short term puts you made crazy money.  
A vaccine news here still mean at least 1 year before cruise line can restart operating somewhat normally and still years away of normal traffic of international cruises.  

For sure cruise lines are long term calls that‚Äôs not the point.

I was bag holding for a month and got scared like a bitch
GMEEE
NIO a boomer stock now
On one hand, management dumping stock on PR releases is really bad for pharma, but at the same time vaccine profitability was greatly exaggerated so the insider sell off is fundamentally sound.

However, looking at value stocks, there is no way we are reaching 60% vaccinations any time soon. Historic flu vaccinations are not even half. 

People are terrified of this vaccine and Facebook will make loads of money from dictators seeking to use that to destabilize democracies.

Value rip is incredibly annoying because it reduces chance of enticing Republicans with PPP to save their stocks. The people need a stimulus.
Yes very organic growth lol. I‚Äôve ridden the wave since $26 so I think I‚Äôll survive most drops and I‚Äôve averaged up to $38 so I‚Äôll just buy anything lower than $38. Good luck on your short position!
Word is 25% move I think.
I guess in this case if you're playing SPY that's reasonable.
Why we dumping? We need to atleast touch 30k
80% down on my BABA calls, I guess it times to sell.
[deleted]
Ok... here‚Äôs a correction: for those people reading this, this guys comment is incorrect.
NIO 11/20 60c lookin good
$YOU
In case anyone forgot PLTR is providing coronavirus monitoring to the CDC. Bullish case on that alone.
147 is the next stop
at least he didn't say ATH. We might be safe. Might be.
actually made all the right decisions for once feelsgood
Unlike NKLA
Honestly the simple fact that I would buy a NIO car in if it were to be introduced in the americas is one of the biggest reasons why I‚Äôm so heavily invested in it. I know I‚Äôm not he only one, I careless about this stupid hype; I just want to see Tesla and NIO compete for dominance which would put all of us driving one of these things soon
No
Not wrong just retarded
I miss all the animal prediction videos. Dog poop guy was the best.
Do it, lockdowns are coming
I'm down 70% on the weeklies i bought this morning. Should I just keep averaging down the cost each day? that should improve my profit margin when NIO moons to $90 and my calls are in the money, right?
This is what penny stocks do. They go up and down alot

Na, gonna keep going up for a while.
The CCP can put out whatever numbers they want
Although that is safer I think I have stocks that can go up in a down market as 1 is a turnaround and the others are a hedge on inflation or "dooms day". We shall see.

Few boomers meeting in Bay area, talking about how are they gonna fuk up our life and make spy 400 til January
So NIO is going to close at 48. 

AH it will pump up massively, might even hit 55 or 60. 

Then it will sell off PM tomorrow and we'll open at 48. Except all options will have lost half of their value.
It‚Äôs not moving from 17.80

its probably gonna pop one day off some news but if its not paying good dividends just get domething else

Very likely
Why do you say that?  I can provide an argument for why they do. The story here is you have a company that is shifting their business.  I bought Apple stock in 2002 and sold in 2006 before the iphone and was a fucking dumb move but I witnessed them going from computers to consumer electronics.  Coty will go from mall to direct and with better/stronger brands.  They will probably make $6 billion to $8 billion in revenues in a few years and their Gross margins will go from 60% to 70% with all the cost cutting. The cost cutting alone gets you 40 cents a share in earnings.
They been around for 17 years, Biden won't really affect the price I don't think

nobody will believe me but back before the markets crashed back in Feb I witnessed the market moving from 325-335 like a penny stock for about 5 minutes. just back and forth back and forth.

I witnessed it on two apps. rh and etrade. My assumption then was the same as yours and nothings ever changed my opinion.

"Another side effect is sleeping for 3 years, we have yet to fix that."
This is the most incorrect view of financial power there ever was. It is always all about the raw capital and has zero to do with the perspective. You putting up 50% of your capital when it is next to zero is equivalent to you wasting time.

Didn't you bother learning Time-Value of Money?
It doesn‚Äôt have a higher chance of profit. It has limited upside because it‚Äôs capped and costs less to enter because you get a credit on one side of the spread. Not worth playing IMO. Most of the upside of option payoff is in the tails and you cut off the tails of the distribution with a debit spread.

Nope. Tech and schools will still use. This is just the start of pandemics. They will occur more and more often without restricted travel. Tech will use because many are going WFH long term due to cost savings.

Why does LI's 52 week high show as 40.81? in RH

I bought into to this shit because of you tards
Euhm , im European and how is NIO gonna enter here? if people want EV they choose Tesla/VW   


And considering some people "hate" China because of the virus..... yeah i dont know dude
I'd wait. We're due for a stimulus talks going well pump.
Very. Stock price has no bearing on business performance right now, purely sentiment around current events w/CCP and Ant IPO.

I just wanna watch the world burn
risky with big time retailers reporting this week
Well, im thinking the same way sometimes so i get where u coming from. Tesla earning like 3 dollars a year, has higher market cap then car companies making billions a year.
I'll baghold fucking PLTR into the grave idgaf their software is transformational.
I wish grwg was closer to 30 only because I want to buy $30 puts.
That makes quality EVs
Not surprised that he dumped it
Right. This is overhyped.
I said ‚Äúat the moment‚Äù because hype is moving the market, well mainly at least.
Generally speaking the flu doesn‚Äôt really affect workplaces, at least any more than a few days a year. I‚Äôm not saying covid won‚Äôt still make a few of your workers have to stay home every now and then, but it won‚Äôt be so much of an issue that you still need 90% of your office still at home. Just keep a flexible wfh ability, and the infected can wfh or take off.
All fed presidents + Jerome speaking tomorrow. Looks like Dow 30K back on the menu!
So instead of paying 400m for 10% we paying 700? So the valuation in this thing is 7b??????

Not yet but I‚Äôm getting there
Dec 11th government shut down puts look really, really enticing.
What exactly is that?
Calls on anxiety attack
Mainly stocks and etfs. ICLN, GE, PLUG, PLTR, NIO, and CHIQ.
Not even close.
‚Ä¢company that gives out credit card style loans online almost went public as a tech company, which means it‚Äôs not regulated as a financial institution at all

‚Ä¢$35B IPO, could literally tank the Chinese economy like the ‚Äò08 crisis in the US if bad loan ratio is too high

‚Ä¢Jack badmouthed about the government regulating too much

‚Ä¢Chinese gov: dude wtf, and wtf is the size of that IPO???!!!

‚Ä¢Jack had to delay the plan until it‚Äôs ready to be regulated as a financial institution instead of a tech company
These NOK leaps will pay off...you‚Äôll see.....you‚Äôll all see.....
What the fuck is the bay area council

Is this weighted in any way or just raw gains? Because raw gains is going to always go to retail. A 100% single gain in one year is too easy for retail to bag and you can do this in one trade a year.

Also, if Printer Powell (Jacked-to-the-Tits Jerome) announces more QE before the end of the year, which seems probable given the data, bears will become an endangered species

Goddammit
Honestly I think the same but I'm bleeding out on a 1/15 351p, if I was going to buy more puts of wait for some kind of crazy rally off no reason. Ex. If we ramped up to 365 into close, I'll probably grab an end of week put Tuesday morn
If you wanna buy something but are scared that things are too overvalued, buy American Air Lines. This hoe is about to pump, when Moderna releases the official results.
Square needs to stop fucking around and get back to 200.

Call me nuts but I just put 10k down on a NIO earnings play.  I feel like the report was to devalue so they could make more $$ on cheap calls.
Ok then why is Travels pumping this market can‚Äôt make up its mind
he was damm lucky right on the scheduling his sale   on the exact day of spike ..
He lost
Dude you should have made it stuffing. I‚Äôd of went in on that.
I hope this one is spot on haha, I'm selling covered calls for 1/15/21 at $20. Would love to see those expire but just barely.
Sounds like another Pfizer
I thought this post would be some bullshit whining, but holy cow the guy was so owned. Too bad he's going to fail to do more than bring a temporary ding to his wife's boyfriend. 

Also, he could have used the fake wedding to get the court to cut the spousal support. What a pathetic cuck
That's brave. All it needs is another Pharma corp vomiting on the stock market. Doesn't make PLTR less relevant in long term but 11/20...

My thoughts exactly. Intranasal doesn't require as high of accreditations to administer, and I think the general public will be much more receptive to them if they turn out to be just as effective as the shots. Especially since vaccines will be distributed on a worldwide scale.

Which part is why? COTY or the Silver miners? Coty alone is worth $10 to $15 a share on cost cutting and when you add new products and services it is like $30 in a few years and will get dividends too.
Hope you got out dude.

At the current moment I would never buy a Chinese car. I like small European stick shift cars with turbos, I would personally rather drive a stick shift Honda then some paddle shifting Ferrari bullshit. Cars with batteries are not for me. So after they take all the fun out of driving and make everything electric, I actually would rather just take the piece of shit cheap Chinese built car because an electric Mercedes or Audi or Porsche is out of the question

Turn around spy wtf
Just in time for me to sell my covered calls to some suckers
Sell the news
**CHINA!!!!!**
No
Yeah, this sort of market manipulation is really common. How it usually goes down is for whatever reason some hotshot gives broad orders for massive move with a tight deadline, and then just lets subordinates figure it out. Enforcement of these directives vary wildly as local officials use them in their own money making schemes.

Like the time northern China tried to get off coal, so they outlawed most private uses while keeping factories running, only the natural gas pipes weren't nearly done when winter came. Eventually coal came back and a few gas pipes were built and everyone forgot about it.

The thing is these made in China cars is they are as cheap and expendable as everything else. Also, the majority of Chinese people can't afford cars, and the infrastructure for EV can't be installed overnight. It is more likely they'll just destroy their gas industry rather than create an alternative. That is, assuming this move actually goes anywhere.
MRNA short too obvious of a play???

It‚Äôs so tempting. Could wake up to 50% gains overnight maybe?
why are my CCL puts not printing yet
BABA 11/20 @ 262.5c?

Interesting that the top 5 most retarded subreddits also have the top 5 ratios
Yes, and I bought in at 9. But $50 a share is a massive valuation. They have a fuck ton of shares. And I believe their lock up period will end in a few months. Freeing up more selling. 

I‚Äôm bullish on pltr, but not unreasonable. $20 is pretty optimistic for where they are, imo. 

But hey. If Tesla can be worth 385 billion and zm can be worth 110 billion. Anything is possible. Lmao

I agree but this can become a good buying opportunity for NIO stocks. I plan to hold and add, even if it's going to sag from here for the next 3 months until next EV earnings week(s).

Right now, EV stocks everywhere are consolidating and catching up to the currently high valuations after last week's reports and energy outlook changes. KNDI and even NKLA are moving up, while the Chinese EV stocks take a breather.

You can realistically get a good set for around 500, I just have a few complete sets plus a little. When I was making money hand over fist in May/June I was just blowing through it without a second thought.
Hitting phase 1 trials in January is pretty late to the game, by the time they‚Äôd be approved (august 2021 at earliest I‚Äôd guess) there will already be several vaccines and probably over a billion doses given out worldwide. I suppose it would help as anti vax types would be more willing to take a spray at some cvs but still definitely a long shot
Picked $170 puts for boeing 11/20 yolo
XPEV already had blowout earnings last week. They had a revenue increase of 350% in one quarter alone. That, plus an energy org report on the projected surge of solar power projects in 2021, is why there was such a massive move up in EV stocks last week. People mistook it for a NIO move and started buying NIO like crazy but it was actually due to XPEV's earnings. NIO reports earnings tomorrow. 

Last week, I owned more shares of XPEV than NIO because I see as much upside as NIO's future but the stock wasn't as expensive as NIO's yet. Right now, NIO & XPEV are both hovering around $44-$45 per share so they have equalized. 

If XPEV continues to outperform in growth in the next quarter as much as it did in the last, it could become the #1 EV growth stock of 2021, I believe.
Should start an Amiaretard sub

Looks like we should change the name of this thread to ‚ÄúDaily Regret Thread‚Äù 

Everyone is like ‚ÄúI regret not buying NIO at $4‚Äù or ‚ÄúI regret not selling NIO at $53‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
Got my 16 $15 1/15/21 calls and my 4 $20 1/21/22 calls as my first options ever. Am I doing this right
Why do you keep repeating this same shit you've said it like 5 times already.

Will BABA ever bounce
Who all swimming naked?
Whatever happens, you deserve it. Godspeed.
If BABA doesn't rebound then my account ain't black
In the case of hyperinflation, there won't be any possible way for the little people to keep up, even if they have a portfolio.

If NIO can consolidate around this range, I think it's a healthy thing for it long term.

Much of the profit is unrealized with countries like the US dumping 2bn into them. When that balance sheet shores up and fda emergency authorization it‚Äôll moon. Projections for 14bn in revenue with strong margins. Costs 15 to make, 40 for a two dose treatment. Marketing + admin costs would probably be 10-18%. 50% margin on 14bn ain‚Äôt bad.

Did OP think this subreddit had a IQ high enough to read and interpret the chart?
Oh damn. Why do sets cost $2k?
Pharma CEOs set up their 10B-5 plans to be based on price triggers instead of target dates, which completely negates the idea behind having 10B-5 plans at all. They can just pump their stock and it acts just like selling at the top (that they themselves created).

SEC should mandate that a price triggered 10B-5 has to require the stock price stays over a certain level for X number of trading days so this pump n dump can‚Äôt hide under the cover of just having a predetermined plan.
Bruh watch it, next week INO will probably say something about a vaccine. I might bet a couple hundred dollars on more airline FDs this Friday just on that ü§û

My biggest is GME tho lmfao
You are comparing a high innovative growth stock with banks that have stagnant or declining revenue growth for years. 
Also 10x revenue is quiet low if you compare to its more adequate peers which are Paypal, Mastercard, Shopify etc.
Square‚Äôs mobile app cash app has a monthly active users growth of over 100%.

I‚Äôm confused, are you short or long NIO?
This too is correct. The power of wsb at work.
Oh fuck. Flashbacks!!
honestly I sold some of my tech stocks and finally am starting to buy value stocks. The two big values I am dipping into are American Air lines / WFC. Vaccine news will most likely give one of them a retard gain. Tech I see bouncing back n forth, while I see potential growth story here. Plus remember when president/faucci were talking about vaccines coming out in December (I think they were not totally wrong). I just see this as a last opportunity to buy in. Just look at UAL, that was a bus I missed :(((((
Out of curiosity, is this a margin account or no?  
I've been working my way up to the bigger tickers, but its somewhat slow going. Just doing it all in a side Roth so its tax free as something to do at work lol.
The market is extra sadistic to those that bought calls last week, it expires and the stonk moons next week.
you are right, sold too early :-(

Long PLTR about to be free money, dis bitch going to 18
It got shilled too much around here so it just has too lol
it always dumps after earnings, in addition it is not a re-opening stock
how can u track when they are scheduled?
...you do know the difference between technical analyses and like, basic valuation right?

Cause its starting to look like no, you do not lmao

is GME done edging us for weeks yet ? can we do something
No bot. No bot.  You're the bot.
Missed plug and power today even it was on my list for this week -.-
I've lost so much money on this stock both ways
Gme calls were the move today
Yeah, I think it's pretty major, because having an mRNA vaccine work without major side effects enables a boat load of future vaccines since it's a comparately way easier to make.
Covid good news for retailers, console cycle, short squeeze possibility, FOMO.

>We also need to hit 30,000 on the Dow so why not make free money buying the indexes up too?

I do. But then the gains have been pretty mild comparatively
Moderna executives been dumping all year, besides the Pfizer ceo apparently setup the sale in August with a price target, which hit after the news was released.
Thinking out of box! I like it, GL!
yep! except for plntr

SONO calls?

They are definitely a long term winner- no question about that.  But I do see a major pullback on earnings day because this stock is up 2300% YTD.  So while I‚Äôm long on NIO, generally.... this next week I am short.

Moderna announced vaccine without logistical heckle which Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine allegedly has. However, I do think this sell off is over-reaction. First, RNA Vaccines are prone to degradation so safest way to transport vaccine is to transport them in extreme low temperature. Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna‚Äôs vaccine uses same mRNA technology. Pfizer indicated it‚Äôs still testing what is the OK temperature they can transport without degrading the vaccine. Second, Pfizer will not be able to produce enough vaccine to meet the demand anyway, same with Moderna. Moderna having ‚Äúbetter‚Äù vaccine will not affect Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine demand. Pfizer and Moderna both will make money out of this.
In advanced tier options setting there is a slider at the bottom that says trade on expiration date.  Turn it on.
S.O.S
I bought a 20 jan 23 80c today for 2500.... 800 days to get to a break even of $110, seems criminal ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Who‚Äôs playing WMT earnings? I‚Äôm thinking 12/18 $155 calls
YOUNG BOI AUTISMO AGAIN
There‚Äôs no correlation between those 2 things at the moment, what‚Äôs moving the market right now is hype. Remember Tesla, Nio, Penn, KODK?
You're ghey
Right on I loaded $133 11/27 and up 10%
Love that we‚Äôre pumping on more vaccine news. Inflating it even more. Higher we go harder we fall. Wait till police enforced lockdowns
I figured lol. Idk, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre likely to see a 20% day like Li did, in fact I‚Äôm not even sure if we‚Äôll see a jump at all no matter what guidance they give out, but I‚Äôm long on them as they‚Äôre the only Chinese EV with potential for a roll out outside of China and with Tesla‚Äôs being ridiculously expensive in the EU, a cheaper competitor should sell.

i lost money on NIO calls when it was $4, true story
Uhm did $BYND announce 96% effective?
This is huge!!! Four more years of stonks!!
any discounted calls today? dont fucking say nio and pltr tards
I totally am willing to lose it. I start my real job soon and can‚Äôt do this stupid yolo crap anymore.
Red day tomorrow confirmed.
We also need to hit 30,000 on the Dow so why not make free money buying the indexes up too?
NIO $69 or $96 EOW
I am glad I saw this, closed nearly all my long positions.
Yea they go up but unless it takes out the Pfizer high expect quite a dipparoo.
Get in PLTR before it hits 16
We all know spy doesn‚Äôt belong anywhere near 360. Puts are literally free money.
NIO can lose half its value and still be up 1000% this year.
Keep us posted
Have fun trying to nut
Weren't even FD's either. SMH. Oh well.
someone that can predict future tell me what stonks are gonna go up
NIO gonna crush earnings and smash guidance...lets do this

Look I may be stupid, and unathletic, and not funny, and untalented
It might be better today - when I graduated a long time ago, internet was kind of new, and a lot of info like that was less available.  

If I had to do it again, I would have NOT worked an afterschool job my senior year of high school and spent 3 hours a night filling out scholarship apps.  One scholarship win would have been more money than I made my entire senior year afterschool job.

But those are the kinds of things you don't know pre-internet, and with parents who didn't go to college, and with parents can't afford you give you spending money (so you have to work for it.)  It's also exactly the kind of thing people are talking about when they say it's tough to climb out of poverty in the US.  If you know what to do, it's easy.  But for kids who don't know any better, it's hard.
until it passes $15 I feel nothing
(it will move like 1% and you will get raped by IV crush)
Bro we obviously only want to hear that NIO is going to go up
Well I guess NIO really is just gonna settle around $44
That is why you get competing offers. In the Bay even startups were giving \~150k-180k starting not including lots of paper stocks. Not sure now.
Whats the ticker

No troll
Trying to understand call debit spreads a little more. I'm wrapping my head around it more and more but want to see if my thought process is correct here because while 500% gains are great on calls/puts, I think a call debit spread has a better chance of some profit with limited loss potential in a lot of cases.

&#x200B;

PRPL call debit spread 30/35 for April example

Buy 30c for $3.50

Sell 35c for $2.20

Total cost is $1.30

&#x200B;

Max profit: $5 (difference between strike prices) minus the $1.30 = $3.70 if PRPL is above $35 at exp date. So risk $130 to gain $370. Correct?

And I'd break even if PRPL is at $31.30 at expiration ($30 call plus my net debit).
üëã  cya
My only mistake with GME was not buying more at 11 lmao
fuck Pfizer
If you're ok with potentially losing it, those can go really well, especially if you know what you're doing....lot of people here don't though and yolo life savings into FDs on GME mid runnup lol

Imo i think its the new console hype
It is trash. People are literally betting on all this added value by republicans switching to it from FB. I can‚Äôt imagine this will impact the company‚Äôs bottom line in the long run.
bull or bear wait till after earnings to gloat. dont be a retard like this guy
And everyone knows this.. so it will rise and rise slowly as earnings comes... and then it will tank after the sell off.
December could be better, low volume stock so not as crazy dips.

Holy fuck i'm finally green on my April RKT calls. It's been one fucking giant turd since i got them.
Every tech company crashed after earnings. bUt THiS TiMe It‚ÄôS DIFferEnT.
E3 (entry level) at FB TC is $179 but base is 120. The bonus and and RSU you don't get until surviving a few years. I'm getting $110 base as a little higher than entry level but also I live in MD which is much cheaper than Cali. I think adjusting cost of living it would be about equal with no handcuffs
As long as someone does
With an $80B market cap, Square trades at 10x revenue.

Even at 100% annual growth, it will take them three full years to get to the point where their market cap even equals one year of revenue. 

Think about it. What differentiates Square from a bank? How can you justify Square trading at a 380PE while the largest financial institutions in the history of the world trade between 10 and 20?

I think it is a decent trade, but you wouldn't catch me dead investing in it for any length of time.
Nobody talking about GME launching itself into orbit rn?
Nooo waaay dude NIO will b 1 trilly b4 Tesla!
it‚Äôs killing me
They won't let that happen until it gets back to at least 260.
Hint: Those "$1 contracts" have no buyers.
That feeling when ER will wipe away all losses üòé
This week gonna be so fucking bloody.
I'm curious, what would be the downside of betting say 50k into puts, 50k into calls and just letting it ride. A 4-5% swing usually results in 3-5x returns. If it doesn't swing u can just sell for breakeven with a loss in the bid ask difference.
calls on **BA** and puts on **TDOC**

just like CNN does with articles. (they literally do this, it's not a joke or satire)
Retardation
Are bitconnect gains taxable since its technically a currency exchange?
too far man, too far
No way, where did you read it?
PLUG breeched $25 again! Go PLUG go!
Xi Jinping I'll stop buying China stocks if you don't fix BABA
It literally asked me info wanted to allow when I logged in this morning.  I'd assume it's in the options menu.
[deleted]
GME keep going!!!! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!
Anyone else have a feeling Tesla is about to start doing it‚Äôs thing in the next few days/ week
Why tf is market like this?
   **Fed doesn't have much firepower to protect near-term economy: Fmr. NY Fed president**   

We just need another 90% vaccine efficacy pump when Fed runs out of firepower lol
All of my hsa is in this bitch since a few weeks ago was I suppossed to buy options? why did this just get tagged?
All in puts. 25% nio 75% spy üêª
Anyone holding SE through ER?
Indeed. Even a clock is right like 3-4 times a day if you adjust for fluctuations in earth rotations
I miss the paper trading contests :(
Congrats to GME.
not enough apparently, buy it if you think it's undervalued or move on
Why would it dip with earnings coming tmmrw? Money is going to start piling in right now.
theta gang would cum tho
This will go the way of Tesla a few months ago.
FOMO AT THE TOP OF GME RIGHT NOW CALLS CALLS CALLS
i spend WAY too much time on here. fuck you guys.
Do I try to close now? Or exercise the options? Or do nothing?
Bear Spray Mondays üêªüî´
what do they do again?
So buy BA puts eod today?
Hexo
Fuck I just bought baba 300 calls too
I was just mentioning this the other day. If you can track when CEOs are scheduled to sell some of their stock, you can bet the shady companies are going to release some sort of ER to try and pump that shit.
Do it again for 28 bucks profit next year
no doubt bout that
Strike and expiration?

get in NIO b4 the short squeeze this afternoon
I sold my calls on Friday. I can‚Äôt reinvest in something that can plummet 20%+ based on a tweet
RKT.  dont you give me hope.
https://cntechpost.com/2020/11/16/nio-is-about-to-report-its-q3-earnings-what-to-watch/

Too many big wigs are pro NIO for NIO to crash. Everyone says buy or hold at least until tomorrow but its car manufacturing went up to 5000 and its sales went up 120%
Bought IWM puts, fuck it this is too high
Yea and I live in the Midwest for school while most of my friends are back in NY, so it‚Äôs essentially impossible. One day tho
Doesn't look like it has.
RIP
[deleted]
Yea travel is going to need 12 months minimum to get any sort of decent travel volume . 

We can‚Äôt even distribute toilet paper and ramen noodles in America . Vaccine will be headaches
Lol
AMC is definitely not going under, long dated calls is the play
He posted last week. I think he will post again EOM
Who?
Looks like the bottom isn't in yet.
Idk wtf a SPAC is but PSTH to the fucking moon
These "scheduled" sales have really been perfectly timed lately.
# OMG THERES A PLANE HEADED FOR THE 2ND SPY TOWER SELL SELL SELL
Cash, Bonds, Stocks, Derivatives... Portfolio hawk waiting and nabbed it
Already priced in, lol.
Me: ‚ÄúBA is near bankruptcy. They could leave investors with nothing at the rate they‚Äôre burning cash. 

Also me: Buys BA calls because tendies.
F
PLUG squeezing??
I‚Äôm with you.. I took all those autist advice and fucking invested my whole portfolio ($3) on fucking $50 11/20 nio calls. Now I can‚Äôt afford any god damn tendies.
[deleted]
You can smell the fear in this thread from NIO call holders
[deleted]
I disagree on that being news.  But I am short on NIO right now so I‚Äôm biased. lol. I expect Xpeng to go up more on NIOs earnings.
Imagine buying NIO in the 50's
Today is such a boring day. Nothing to get into unless you're already in positions.
how, i really fucking want it
Better flair for this would be shitpost
PLTRü•∞
What's the rocket fuel behind GME?
Which would make a NIO crash too obvious. To the moon!

Screenshot us your puts on NIO..
no
Only if you're a pussy
[removed]
Just seeing the report: ‚ÄúModerna vaccine is 94.4% effective AND easier to distribute.‚Äù Lmao, this place is truly a clown show!
You had me at brrrrr
Of course.  And other model sales won‚Äôt go down at all
Yeah, they got hit with the COVID downturn end of March...but they beat earnings estimates earlier this month and with the economic turnaround to follow a vaccine, it may go back up to it's normal trading level.
[deleted]
i miss being able to see my full RH account total investing too low imo
what chart
If you feel like it‚Äôs going to dip buy a put.
Yessir!  Have to turn the option on.
Buy cannabis ETF. NJ voting for legalization. More states legalizing because they need tax revenue. Once Sleepy Joe takes over, he will remove it from prohibited list and make inter state commerce legal. We are going to talk about cannabis next year the way we are talking about EVs right now.

Just don't buy ACB. That's a loser
Ok that one hurts to read.
I‚Äôm confused, IV is over 100% and you still decided to buy? That‚Äôs fuckin retarded bro adios to every single penny you put into that.
You probably shouldn‚Äôt be doing this if that‚Äôs your annual salary

Literally the most accurate/reliable thing I‚Äôve traded on. üòÇ
[deleted]
I did but i had still made a lot on it so that made the decision easier
Because nio down now nio up tomorrow because if nio up now nio down tomorrow but nio down now
Purchased at the top this morning.
So are they going to continue to release new vaccine news every Monday before market open until all bears are dead?
Thirsty
Pit Fighter gang
I think energy, travel, and Healthcare are about to suffer. The news, hype, sentiment is too high.

I've seen this before, even early as last week with Pfizer. 

That and mango called the top again

Loaded up on puts
Will bears ever get a red day?
Turrible
Same as pfe
Lol sold my jan 12c.... for a loss now they pump lol
Troll
Balls deep in AMZN and EA c FD's.  What was I thinking
totally didn't intentionally wait until after the election to announce all this vaccine news, right? ... right???
Idiot would imply savant .. just saying
I‚Äôm also a polar pioneer but I have a block heater on my trucks and plane. Couldn‚Äôt a similar system like a battery warmer be designed for Tesla? I already know the people around here that can afford Teslas can also afford garages to put them in but if electric is ever going to be mainstream in the north then a built in battery warmer is a necessity.
[deleted]
This is worse than counting rabbits
Hall of famer
In a way yes but if they announce first EU deliveries in 6 months then that‚Äôs a big deal. They‚Äôve been teasing EU expansion for years and they‚Äôve had EU presence since 2014 so if they can slap a timeframe on, it‚Äôs going to raise the stock price regardless.
Retail traders are literally the last in line when it comes to trading. A 40% gain with high volatility and risk is 100 times worse than a 20% low risk gain.
Where‚Äòs the update from the GME paper millionaire
Did you not look at the chart before you bought. Jesus man wtf
Just buy ebay. ebay takes 10-20% of every console, gpu, cpu sold on their platform and I guarantee ebay has wayyyyy more volume than gme.
I like to join theta gang, but I am too mentally impaired to understand theta
Buying SPY puts one week into April.
yeah, only stock I've revenge traded lol. but i'm good now. I'm up like $12k on them.
NVDA up or down after earnings?
Yes but it costs $5
[deleted]
Fo real?
Do I just cut my losses with NIO today? Feel like it could dip hard today
Buy $20k more and average down
Too much technicals. Only hurdy up and buy
Leave it and go to the next Yolo. Boeing 250 calls
Whole brazil stock market is going up.
The dollar was too high against the br real, most br companies are going up
Misusing DD flair despite pinned mod comments. Fucking ban this illiterate troglodyte
SONOS always fucks me so naturally they'll do well this time since im out
i've heard of evryfknthing now
PLTR is near max. Big money already bought.
I thought vaccine news was an instant guaranteed 2-3%?!

This is a scam, how do I get a Robinhood refund?!
A nice steady decline. Showing you repeatedly made the same mistakes
Haha, at least you probably didn't buy them a month or so ago.  Down a few k on those suckers, but ah well.  GME still winning!
Why would we want to know that??
Going over my initial input of 1k
love this lol
Hello Nio call holders.  The GME bus to tendie town is leaving the station...all aboard!!
Don't fuck me on this you pussy!
NIO
RH now allows 0dte...  This could spell trouble!!!üòù
Shout out to the people saying Zoom was gonna rocket this week in the weekend thread
FCEL MOONING
stf up idiot, I am not telling them to get put forever,

no idiot would get call when the stock is gonna go down
Spy volume low again for the 6th day in a row
All the NIO bulls waiting for earnings...how many companies got fucked in the last few weeks after absolutely killing earnings?
PLTR gonna fuck around long enough to shake out all of the goldfish attention span wsb gamblers then moon and cause mass fomo hysteria
He's saying that his GME position in the 13F isn't entirely accurate.
GME in rocket mode
I hope it closes exactly as it opened 

Not really though cause I'd be fucked too
Now
LOL. THE DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE FOR THE GME BOYS
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt draw lines just to draw them‚Äù then why the fuck else are you drawing them??
thanx :)
Most of my shit is now starting to rise up again.
i already exited
Yep. Charts could definitely go up, down, or sideways today. Very sure about that.
Thanks!  Hopefully it'll offset my garbage-ass calls.
GME on one today lol
[deleted]
imagine being a bear 2020
Ending this wk, I‚Äôll sell half today I‚Äôm pretty sure just bc the Dow is being stubborn
Use the $NIO minute chart to predict the movement on $LI.  If $NIO has a sudden move, $LI will follow shortly after. (For high-frequency day trading)
If you dumbasses don‚Äôt buy the price NIO is at right now you are retarded... I put like all my money into NIO at 49 (I‚Äôm retarded for that) and I don‚Äôt have money to buy the price it‚Äôs at rn... it‚Äôs rlly a good price here. I don‚Äôt give a fuck what shitron said, major banks like JP Morgan and etc valued this stock at the $47 range which ultimately alone should disregard that dumb article. Probably shouldn‚Äôt have got to the 50s last week because that was an early run up but I‚Äôm sure before Christmas this thing is gonna be in the high 50s realistically and then will stay like that until a new catalysts emerges later 2021.
Will the market try to get Dow to 30K again? Bought a DIA 300C yolo.
Means up I think but I'm just a lowly autist
What's all the love for PLTR? Looks like trash to me.
I want NIO to dip back to $40 so I can sell some puts.
Imagine selling it at 90. üëÄ
Cod Cold War set digital sales record and ATVI down 2% wtf is this
Lol...everyone knows that its a beaten down stock...so 30% rise is fair enoughv
Positions or ban
Usually orange juice flavored
Nah it will stay level to fuck over every option buyer.

If rkt can make it to $50 by next year I will triple my account on a play I'm in for $1.
GME to $20!!! Fuck you shorts!
Thinking the same
Jess. Sactly
lmao sell
Ccl puts, pltr calls, or baba calls?  Discuss.
He is a literal piece of shit from yesterday that's drying out. Nobody gives a flying fuck about what he says now.

Holy shit GME
Buy Nio for earnings or sell Nio for sell the news?
I approve of this.
Bears, tell us, we gotta know.. HOW DO YOU GUYS CLEAN THE SHIT OUT OF THE SLIT OF YOUR PENIS?
sounds like someone is missing the Holiday Spirit!
Buy the hype sell the news.
I am with this guy
OH MY GOD VACCINE IS COMING? DUMP TECH STONKSSS

SPY and Apple are both invincible. 400C EoY easy
That's standard. If you look the only insider trading cases centered around small fish that were pretty clear. Lots of mid and low level company employees but no one high up.
she bent us over
SLV taking off. Tried to tell y‚Äôall
It‚Äôs gonna run up eod
Sold poot last week, holding poot. Poot poot poot
GME saving my shitty Webull account üëçü§£
I is
FUCK YEAH DO COCAIN!!!!!!!!
PRTS is an interesting pick, while its pro-covid due to the online and DTC, in general cars are getting less use with the quarantining and workng from home. However, I'd guess that typically the people ordering parts are also probably the ones that would continue to work on the cars despite lower than average use. One to watch for sure.
100K in SPY 260 Puts dated 1/15/2021 bought in July
GME so I can buy my bro a PS5
Nope price floor is 40 - Morgan Stanley
honestly, i respect trump for still having this much energy and enthusiasm.
thanks i remember what happened last time
Hope ZM dies. Not even playing it, just hate my meetings at work
GME run up
even they we probably only gap down .2%
Not really sure what he‚Äôs gonna do. The ev stocks aren‚Äôt even doing anything outside China rn. I guess he could tariff the entirety of Chinese exports and that could hurt... but China is signing an Asian-Pacific trade deal... so they‚Äôre kinda taking things into their own hands. If anything China is adapting. I‚Äôm not a China shill, just calling a spade a spade. I see it the way I sees it
GME lol. shorts are getting squeezed hard.  get in before 20!
reload and do it again
not getting out when i ws up 12% on my portfolio friday morning. instead i threw it back in and lost it all and more. when youre up big, cut, go home, and come back the next trading day. dont keep pushing.

Say it with me GME GME GME, squeeze the shorts!
Welp my lyft $37 puts are kill. Im done
Vaccine news to push it up and hold as the whole world is waiting on a cure.
THATS ANTI AMERICAN WTF NO
Drill to the middle of the earth after earnings
This is fucking pathetic.

If bulls had any confidence we would not be sitting at 20m SPY volume lol
[deleted]
PLTR is near the peak.  It had \~20 max potential this year before dropping back next February during lock up release.
Okay update sorry to CRSR gang, it's tanking because I sold a 30p. Everything I touch turns to shit, mane
spy dump when
Was my first big investment leap, got kind of nervous
Is iv affecting mrna calls.   I'm not in it but maybe the iv was a lot higher last week?
Why is gamestop running? Was something announced?
NIO is definitely going up or down today.
Same. Literally sold my spy 0dte 360 calls 1 min before it went up 1.5pts more lol
Pretty sure this going really well for you
CRSR, you‚Äòre supposed to stay above 30
[deleted]
11/20 SPY puts? Thoughts?
Calls on MDLZ  and YUM
y‚Äôall buying in for console release news that were priced in last month. these consoles aren‚Äôt even primarily using physical discs anymore, which are gamestop‚Äôs speciality. 

if you wanna bank in for used last generation games, accessories, and nerd figures, good luck and rip for those going long. might as well buy calls on blockbuster.
Whaaaa? Why?
I mean, I could say the same to you regarding long term thinking.  Once a vaccine passes stage 3 trials people are gonna want to travel like crazy. Passing phase 3 seems more and more likely due to successful mid-trial results.

I do agree that a lockdown would be bad, but it would only be bad for a brief moment.  Im near certain nothing like march will happen again.

Personally I just gtfo the market cause ive been losing all my money being a bear for the past 8 months and just swapped to being bullish on NIO and BA the past 2 weeks.  Im just above breakeven now so ima be a boomer and buy shares lol
Gme broke thru $12. To the moon üöÄ
You thought you have the right to exercise a call option you sold? You belong here.

Nah....Im kinda pissed that there was so much insider trading going on under his watch. No company got prosecuted. Fuck him.
To a company the size of $PFE the vaccine for COVID-19 isnt that large. Although from a vaccine platform standpoint it could be huge but that depends on what the practical applications of that techology are. On the other hand BioN(i think??) owns the platform....

As you can see above, its more complicated than Pfizer good news, Pfizer goes up.
INOVIO INOVIO
Ino ino 

Trust me, FDA cleared their trial hold Today! These guys can make vaccines that don‚Äôt need a refrigerator. Buy some shares before they are back at $30
Regarding the vaccine plays, you either buy all the vaccine companies and hope one of them hits it big or you know someone there personally who will call you when there‚Äôs a breakthrough and a media outlet coming to do a report, they‚Äôre always announced overnight, vaccine news has become a business in itself. It‚Äôs all idiotic anyways, vaccines take years to devise, years of clinical research for adverse side effects to come out, efficacy, etc etc.. immunology is not a light subject, they strait up told us in school this shit is super confusing and they still don‚Äôt understand a lot
[deleted]
Half loans, half on future tendies. Go all in on Lemonade.
Welp it didn‚Äôt
Thus it will be given to poor countries that can't afford refrigeration, while the other vaccines go to places that can.
You‚Äôre looking at it
We don't have group name for everyone in PLTR. I suggest Palanteers. The CEO can be Captain Palant.
what strike are you thinking?
Something about $TSLA I guess
god damn, never get married to a stock, hope it works out and they actually recover financially
Idk man atleast its funny here.
Bad bot
I play energy a lot and every time I do it‚Äôs always shill posts about golf and silver and discord shit it‚Äôs annoying
The dip was to 15 this morning retard, you missed it
get BA puts eod bois,

thanks me later
Neogeo was so ahead of its time. Loved that thing
Shutdown headlines coming tomorrow. 

Wednesday and Thursday will be big for stay at home stocks. Just have to hold on until then

You have time my dude, Fauci estimatesd normal (non at risk non politically connected or rich) will be able to get the vaccine around April and it‚Äôll take months from  that point on. Don‚Äôt chase there‚Äôs always another
F
Finally BYND showing some life
oh boy i hope you‚Äôre right
Lost too much money on them earlier this year, gun shy now.
Thankz Yu
How far OTM do I sell calls on PLTR?
Oh thx for the heads up- holding thru that for sure..
I love that WSB is a source of intelligence and reasoned understanding in the sea of retards on both sides right now. 

There‚Äôs a whole lot of depressed, ‚Äúfibromyalgia‚Äù suffering, antisocial retards hoping that this continues forever because they can‚Äôt face the real world. So they work themselves into a fear porn state and jerk off to their own depressive thoughts. 

And on the other side you‚Äôve got your dad who thinks the virus is a hoax and paradoxically so is the solution.
Best DD I have ever read on this sub
Same, had to go for a drive
Had weeks of that bro
I never seen ZM this stagnant
alright then, good luck to you.
Market is forward looking now 2 years out
Does the re-certification even matter if people aren't willing to fly on the 747-Max plains?

People will ask "is this ticket for a 747-Max plane?" and if the answer is yes they wont want to go, airline companies will be forced to switch to other plains. Airline companies cancelling all the orders they can because the plane is fucking useless since too few people will ever trust it and want to get on it.
I had $1k burning a hole in my pocket. Threw at short dated, OTM calls. We‚Äôll see. Lol
Do your own fucking research. I am asking someone to correct or assert my own findings.
lmao
HYDROGEN HOMIESSSSS
cmon PLTR. i buy you then you drop 20 cents instantly. dafuq. i think im gonna cut all and take today off. i cant make any good moves today. my timing is all fucked
# Huge volatility in ZM over the past few hours.  Wow!!
My PFE stock better revive itself today sucked
Going to 220
Lol dude didn't do shit anyways
CCL $17P 11/20 . You‚Äôre welcome

Time for another NIO spike to buck off the weak
Absolutely....ALWAYS take profit.
Just loaded 40k into BABA calls

My colleague: Hey what‚Äôs up
Me: BA
This is what they call a pump and dump
confirmation bias. you weren‚Äôt going to upload if it was a red open.
You still on RKT LMAO???
Hard pass.
pussies like the reacharound
It would probably take a nuclear apocalypse for spy to have -3% day.
[deleted]
How far OTM do I sell calls on PLTR?
But there are no red days anymore :/
Lol RIP
pfizer did, why not
Multiple vaccines will be developed and distributed, so they'll all win.  Moderna's might end up being focused more on places like Africa where refrigeration is difficult, but as long as they're effective, expect multiple ones to succeed and be used around the world.
Maybe
joining wsb
i bought puts for you guys, so don‚Äôt let me down
Forget the section rule but it‚Äôs until 18th I think.
My BABA calls :_(
Lol you guys are characters... thanks for replies
Idk man 205 seems mad high, I might sell half of my calls just bc FOMO tmrw
Congrats bro, don‚Äôt lose it all
It guess Nio just lives in the 44-45 range now.

I predict a stock jump after the FDA emergency use authorization.  I‚Äôm playing calls on that and then bouncing.
362 is next resistance

if we don't hit it in the next hour i think we trace back to 358 by close
What the fuck does this mean. Up or down?
Y'all remember NEO-GEO? Have a better chance of reviving that shit than fucking bullshit NIO.
I wish our flair tracked missed plays and winning plays so we know who tf to avoid
GME
Who's buying spy puts rn?
Ceo dumped last week.
PLTR is so allergic to 16 lol
HD buying back HD supply. One day someone will have to break up the HD and Lowe's duolopy
Not a great day.. imma head out for a walk
Yum
Selling BA at $174
Lmao did moderna ceo really sell her shares today
Paulson on Bloomberg looking like the Monty Burns
Depends when he got in
options are ur best way to have fun. if u just want money just buy QQQ or SPY

Is BA getting too high.. should I sell half of calls
When is CCL gonna fall out of the sky
You ever get acid reflux that tastes like sour patch kids and pizza? Cause I have that right now ü§¢
$RKT to $100
# DIA $300C?
Best DD I've seen all week.
It\`s BA going to keep mooning to 205? hold or sell now at 203 ?
pfizer‚Äôs vaccines are subsidized by the government. the customer doesnt pay as it‚Äôs paid by the government via tax dollars. this is essentially what free healthcare is.
Don't short now ...after a few days
Cruise line puts, exp January
Shhh
If you're wanting to bet on some bad companies for quick pumps, have a look at the SPI $10c expiring this week. Maybe toss $20 at it and see what happens
I have a feeling the market is just hanging on by a thread. Every bull is just trying to squeek out one last bit of profit. With rising covid cases at ATH, places shutting down again, the vaccine news is pretty much all finished up, there is no way this holds much longer.

Bitch ass cat is going to fuck up puts...reeeee
And then Palantir will drone strike him with their Big Brother tech
Accesswire article out on BABA lawsuit, is this legit??
I trade 0DTE‚Äôs every Friday. Make most of my money on those days. You can buy cheap ass premiums, dangerous, but I always make it out with amazing gains. 

The best gains? ODTE‚Äôs when TSLA was $1500. Made $275,000 in one Friday!
Gunna start coughing on the homies so these tech calls print
For those of you heavily invested in Chinese stocks or options, are you not concerned about what Donny will do? He‚Äôs a lame duck president, but he‚Äôs signaled that he‚Äôs going to be as tough as possible on China until Biden‚Äôs inauguration. Could be a wild 2 months
What the fuck PLTR

I would get a higher caliber, you want something that can still kill a deer with one shot an AR-15 can‚Äôt do that
BABA will fly
Might not squeeze today, don't get short dated stuff!  But man is it a nice day so far, up 12% total account just from GME
I sold this on the Pfizer news last week. Made a good return but missed the huge jump today
He probably has a position that he needs to get out of ASAP

So what‚Äôs the actual play??
Nio head and shoulders, 42 incoming
It just keeps pumping. Might sell at the end of the day
There goes 1.5k in two days
Vaccine news ‚Äî> massive stock jump cuz people think this means COVID is over ‚Äî> investors realize there are a million regulatory and logistical hurdles to distribution (e.g. vaccine has to be stored at -97 degrees Fahrenheit) ‚Äî> Moderna releases better results on a vaccine that‚Äôs much cheaper to store ‚Äî> stock price pulls back to more realistic levels
Hahahhahahahaha yeh keep thinking that
Et tu, HD?  Didn't expect this dumb shit from you too today.

Nah it was mixed bag but depends on how you look at it. They burned a LOT of cash which meant they had lowered EPS but deliveries and revenue numbers were also really good.

Wouldn't call XPeng the next NIO though, it's already had a crazy run up. All the Chinese EVs now are kinda sitting in a precarious spot waiting for NIO earnings. They all kinda move together too so barring major news that causes them to separate I don't think it's gonna matter too much in the short term which one you choose.
Tell that to my TTCF calls..
yeah happened to me today. lost about $650 being stupid. I'm up $7k for the day though. so not too bad. still annoying.

Lmao one of the Twitter traders I follow said NIO can become a $1 trillion company hahaha

I‚Äôm doubling down on PLTR
i'm really surprised not more people on wallstreetbets trade 0DTEs. probably because most are using robin hood. 

how often do you trade 0DTEs if i may ask. do you think it would be a possible strategy to buy say 5-7% OTM puts and calls on a volatile stock friday morning and hold for a couple hours before they start decaying?
Also doesn't require the insane freezing conditions.

Profits are profits.  Still doubled your investment if you sell.

Trades for .15 Price to revenue, best buy (closest competitor) trades for .75.  Gamestop is a severely undervalued company with a fantastic management team turning the company around after the previous management team nearly killed it.

Tons of other stuff, like founder of chewy wanting to make it the chewy of gaming, and 100% short interest means it could 5-10x in price randomly.  Way too many headwinds for me to type out, but definitely worth getting shares or long dated calls (april+ is the safest).  Be aware that you will likely lose money before you gain, the short itnerest makes it insanely volatile.  I've been down 50-90% on calls and still profited on them

their vaccine requires -80¬∞C (-112¬∞F) storage and transport, which is entirely impractical.  meanwhile, other vaccines without that problem are also close to approval.

Sometimes cash is the better play. The tweet from Trump today wasn't exactly the same as previous tweets that sank the market every single time.  So this may or may not be the canary, but in terms of taking profit on  SPY 11/18 calls it's good enough.

Better to secure profits now and plow them back into the next meme I'm pumping.

That is what makes the bulk of the total compensation. RSUs, signing bonus (100k+), yearly bonus, retention bonus.  Most top companies get a yearly bonus that is pretty much guaranteed at 15-30% of base.
SPY puts 11/20
I would ask for a raise!
Sold a call option at 2.5 in the beginning of the year using my NIO shares as collateral. Didn't close my position because I'm gay. Decided to buy back the option thinking "it took my shares too didn't it?" on Friday, it didn't. Depending on how things go, I might need to sell it my shares at a lower price than what I bought the call at with a greater loss and eat it.
Anyone else not buying this fake ass rally?
Look up the definition to ‚ÄòGamblers Fallacy‚Äô.  You may be correct that we are overdue for a correction, but what would be the rate of return on the cash you sidelined? Interest rates are basically zero. 

That said, sell some stocks if you want, or sell covered calls to generate premium. Having a little cash to buy won‚Äôt hurt. But, honestly I would just set a stop-loss at where you think the dip happens, or keep selling covered calls until they get exercised.
Is that exponentially better than prpl? Or why the notation?

If you buy cruise lines at these levels you hold, not sell, that is what you don't get. 

When the next news on the Vaccine is released lets see how fast lose money on those puts.. and news might be as soon as next week as they mentioned.. 

Look, Good luck with your puts is all I'm saying.

Isnt that what the market does? Pricing in the future.  Would be a little strange if it didnt react positivly to vaccine news. Now we know we have a vaccine, and that the virus will be stopped in a few months.

Too late, my break even limit order executed
Exactly my man. Falling margins from the pharmacy front end drove the stagnation over the past 5 years along with worries about legislation upending the entire industry. A lot of those fears I think are  evaporating quickly. Also cost savings from Aetna synergy along with their other subsidiaries are going to combat the falling margins. I'm trying to temper myself but I don't see how this doesn't reach $150 or so by next year's end if all of those trends continue, which I think they will. They also have a sexy dividend hah.
This morning (EU time) I asked for a dip so I can buy more. Got it. We can now go back to that tasty +9%.

Who's playing IQ earnings today?
Why is the Chinese gov tanking BABA just let it free
Depends what you mean by 'win'.

Are they going to dominate the EV market with EVs for everyone? No. Mercedes make expensive luxury vehicles. Not cheap run-around cars for the everyday citizen.

Will they win the luxury EV market? Maybe, it's probably too early to tell.

Is there going to be one winner anyway? I don't think so, all car companies will start producing EVs, cater to different markets etc. Tesla has jump-started the industry so everyone will be positioning themselves to catch up.

VW are in a good position to dominate. Since they own loads of other brands such as Seat, Skoda, Audi, Bently etc, and produce cars for most markets, they are in a good position to be a key player in the future EV market. Plus they already have (albeit expensive and overpriced in my opinion) EVs in the market such as the ID3.

prob because HPV can then be marketed as a "cancer" vaccine for women because HPV can cause cervical cancer.

I‚Äôm either having a Mandela event or I remember distinctly reading big options plays in pharmacology, and glass vials back in November. Ya know before COVID was released officially. I remember us predicting the end of the world. 

Hopefully I shifted out of that universe where we all die by the end of the year. Still not sure. Anyone else remember those option plays in November 2019, and the general consensus was a pandemic was about to break out?

You‚Äôre right I think I‚Äôve become too attached to the WFH stocks and seeing bargains now in NFLX, PTON and WIX. I‚Äôve bought a bunch of shares in NFLX for the hell of it but prob a good time to look into other sectors as you say.

Decent gains.  Should have held another few days but NO RAGRETS
PLTR 20 eow

Guys, have a mental rule to only buy calls on a red day
LMAO!  Stop looking at 5 minute charts.  Look at the big picture...  My calls expire in June 2021.

CCL has been so flat last 30 minutes do something crazy please
I‚Äôm in
There is literally no reason that this company should increase in value.
old news, but the rotation out qqq seems ongoing.
what to buy ?
Ccl 11/20 17P
look at SPY HOD and his tweet timestamp lol
The value of a put increases when the price of the underlying stock falls. The amount the put value increases by is dependent on how far away the stock price is from the strike price. When you want to sell is up to you. It should be noted that the value of an option contract is not always a 1:1 relationship with the price of the underlying (I‚Äôd recommend googling Options Greeks...and learning about delta at the minimum).


For example, if the strike price of a put is $100:

If the stock price is currently $20 and goes down to $18 -> the value of the put will probably go up by around $2 (holding all else equal)

If the stock price is $400 and it falls to $398 ->the value of the put will barely move...the likelihood of it falling all the way to $100 is still quite low.
No

Seriously. Wtf is going on. It‚Äôs the anchor on my account right now.
INO is NIO for dyslexics
Smart... I‚Äôm currently down a lot on my Feb 2021 calls but still buying the dip
Would actually be the best thing democrats have done in decades (ACA is a scheme and trash).
I had some leaps on goog and even with it hitting an all time high. My calls are worth less then they where in the august. way to far otm I guess

bro but aren't ur things expiring like this week or sum? trust me I wish they would drop but I'm literally quitting trading because my account got wiped by rcl puts, I'm red all over since last week. They arent going down the next day. Learn from my mistake once ur green get out. It's been exactly a week and RCL is higher now than it was after Pfizer news and lowest its dropped is like 7 dollars ish and always made it up again. Good luck man

What happened?
CCL. At around 17$ a pop. Even if they go back to a portion of what they used to be worth and take a whole 3 years to do so. You could still double your investment easy. 1 year ago they were 42/51 range. Let's just say 3 years to get to 34$ still have room for growth and doubled your investment longterm with boomer stocks.
Moderna is 4.5% better therefore stonk go down.

I think I will, but will depend on how it goes tomorrow. If it flies 10% or higher tomorrow, I might sell. If it stays below 10%, I‚Äôll hold.
You probably won‚Äôt regret it
WMT finally broke $150. Were all green from here boys
Dude, Carnival is having like 10% swings days and we are years away from normal business for them and probably 1 year away to any business .... there is clearly puts play potential there.   
This company ain‚Äôt making profit for a llloonng time.  
Obviously long play is leaps Calls, but short term some of the current raise in prices make no sense.
$TWO mooning
just needs to go down another 60%
no go pltr

Sold off my Zoom bag
[deleted]
I am, probably gonna sell some retarded otm calls on the run up tmw
I‚Äôm selling most today before close and will hold a little in case big pop (but unlikely imo)
I made so much money on TSLA in July. Nostalgia
Just bought the Baba 300C Jan 15, we finna eat good soon
spx making the ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø patter  like it fucking doesn't know to go up or down
Think BLNK can run like plug and SBE?
IXN needs to keep rising so I can offload these ITM calls at a reasonable price. The bid-ask is wider than the Grand Canyon. Shoulda paid more attention to that before I bought in.
A true retard

NIO eod?

BA is done pumping bro no way it keeps going
Spy still going up makes me depressed. should i just yolo december spy puts
Looking forward to the PSTH DD. Your original post is what got me on the train, but I hopped off looking for quicker tendies... wondering if the time to get back on board is now, even though it's up a bit.
15 minutes boy and it goes straight to 197
play something else, fuk elon
guess who sold GME at a measily 25% call gain today lol
Keep losing your testosterone puss lips ü•¥
Ok hun cya tomorrow

BABA stop fucking around.
Oh yeah so i guess mango tweeting and sending aapl down 25% in sept was a fraction of a percent.
Can't figure FSLY. This a good entry to leaps or long?
I‚Äôm in!!!
HOLY PLTR LETS GOOOOOO
Shout out to whoever bought those calls from me at the top, you're the real MVP
youd have to be so fucking greedy to not take at least some profits from some of this shit right now...
1. Are you seriously using a Motely Fool article as your basis for trading advice?

2. Companies are 2 things: profitability and governance

BABA has over $180Bn USD in assets, and has $20Bn USD in *net* income. Their profitability is easily shown.

The obvious negative is governance, and while it's a real issue, governance is an easier solve than profitability. Sales over everything.
Nice.
shit it aint gonna be me  lol
You would of lost that bet.
Why buy suck a shit stock
I have 30 calls lol so I am in.
soo sick of people bitching about baba.. its holding 255-260 like a fuckin anchor.. stfu and buy further dated calls you fools
GME checking in
down 80% but im still holdin this bitch
It‚Äôs not a problem if you‚Äôre winning.
Big P energy.
If we are gonna go for it; I say Eve fucking Jobs.
I went super heavy into BABA today. Who knows if I timed it well or not. I'm retarded.
What the fuck snap
Right, but people are just waiting to go back to cruising, they aren't losing customers, just they can't "sail".. it will happen, a Vaccine will come out, and instead of trying to hope decaying overvalued puts for a "short term" play, you can sell puts instead and make money since the cruise stocks will be just held or pinned or even pumped up more as people get more news on a vaccine..

These cruise lines aren't gonig to just die, they are just going to be hurt, but if you have these levels, like CCL at $15/share! why would you sell?? why??

RCL is a $90/stock and as you can see if you bought it anywhere below that, you hold, and not sell..

So this trying to time short term "bet" gamble, is just to me, an opportunity to sell puts, not buy puts, when you buy puts, you are overpaying and then any news or upswing will make your puts lose all the value and they won't profit..
no i wouldnt buy
I wanna buy a Spy 380 call exp. 01/01.
I would not stress. This is temporary. Ain‚Äôt nobody going anywhere for a long time
reading this post u may be the smartest one here, so can u do the research and let us know?
Why is it up out of nowhere?
New consoles every 7 years GME does the same thing. Also was being shorted into oblivion, they paid off 125 million in debt and have a shit ton of cash. Ryan Cohen took 12% stake in the company he said no to like 100 other companies. Do the math.
Holy cow
Will buy more tomorrow if it closes in high 12.80 range
Yeah a whopping .46% increase
Hold NIO shares through earnings or what here?
PLTR going now
Did ya end up doing something similar ? You would be up +17,333.33
If you took out at min.
wait till the bears find out NIO isn‚Äôt pumping only bcuz of the rotation into value, after its over its back to regularly scheduled PUMPIN
PLTR officially GREEN. I REPEAT!!!!!!!!!!
calls on **BA** and puts on **TDOC**
Butt. Plug. Say it
just copped 20k shares of pltr...holding this for ever and quitting trading, peace boys
No you are the shit in it
What do we call the DOW once it hits 30k?

NIO is the definition of retard strength
I dont own it for the same reason I dont buy on alibaba- dont buy chinese junk
pltr it‚Äôs okay baby take your time
Yo i need some confirmation bias on PLUG. Any takers?

you can tell who is new here by the people whining about orange man tweets when it moves a fraction of a fraction of a percent... if you would have been here for china trade deals you would know how life altering a tweet can be... shut up about trump or take that shit to r/politics
Thoughts on QCLN? Might be a safer way to play NIO.

god damn Larry David's daughter is smokin hot
Yeah but when a single case increases or lowers the effectiveness by over 1%; you can safely assume that the error bars are going to be high.
NIU should be a solid play. I‚Äôm in already with 30c LEAPS and March 35c, but I might buy some weeklies if it has a dip this week.

Bro. Deep down, you know why
Lots of people looking at the potential of jumping in to Pharma on the back of vaccine news. This is a classic case of people buying the news, rather than what is really facing the industry. Next year, Biden has his sights set on tackling the pricing for drugs in the US and this has the potential to really fuck the stock price for certain pharma companies. People here are probably too retarded to understand but below is a good summary of what he is trying to do

[https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biden-looks-to-germany-for-answers-how-to-tackle-high-u-s-drug-prices-analyst](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/biden-looks-to-germany-for-answers-how-to-tackle-high-u-s-drug-prices-analyst)

Someone much smarter than me would research which companies are heavily exposed specifically to "primary care" keep tracks on the news of how this is progressing, and take a position to short them.
Why the hate for BABA?
What time does he talk
He forgot to take his meds this morning
Baba is basically fucking halted
what time is his speech?
Best of luck üêª

page 2 says "maybe sideways"
Who's holding solo still? Should I just take a loss or what
Y‚Äôall said the same about RKT FUCK YOU
You‚Äôre a brave man for shorting NKLA in this irrational market.
Lol the Hummer EV was fucking CGI. Everyone but TSLA is guilty
No.
Lmao some people here man. No shit the cruise lines aren‚Äôt going to zero, but the fact is still that we are at least a year away before international cruises are back.  
A vaccine announced ‚â† cruises are back lol. I agree with you that there is a short therm puts play here. The issue is really the timing.  

Short term Puts play and leap Calls is probably the way to go imo.
Position and entry
Agreed - it‚Äôs totally possible to go to school for cheap. 2 years of CC followed by 2 years in-state can almost be paid off by working while in school. Or if you get scholarships. 

On the other side of that coin, if your state doesn‚Äôt have any decent state schools, and you choose a private school for grad school (law, med, dental, business) you can very easily hit $100k-$300k before you graduate, even if you made ‚Äúgood‚Äù choices.

My experience with scholarships was our valedictorian got enough scholarships to buy a house (cash) her freshman year of college while anyone with less than about a 3.9 got ~$2k/yr (unless they were in athletics.) There is a deep and wide scholarship donut hole that normal kids with middle class parents and good but not perfect grades fall into.
PLTR Go GREEN you can do it
Right, and you think you are going to buy puts cheap and somehow some other idiot will have to want to buy those puts off of you after..

So in other words, you are trying to "catch" the time to buy puts and hope it doesn't get pumped or held or pinned up and your puts just lose value as usual and decay and for puts to even make money, you need a drastic and quick drop and sell off.. and that won't happen on cruise stocks at these levels..

You cannot know what the error bars are going to look like without having the data. The only way to construct error analysis is to look at infection rates between the groups over a period of time and comparing it to another period of time (even this is imperfect, since the vaccine might lose effectiveness over time, in a perfect world you replicate the study). From this press release you cannot garner any information about error bars. 

On top of that you only need about 60% effectiveness for a vaccine to be effective.
puts are gonna pay in a sec
Lmao one of my ‚Äòbuddies‚Äô who‚Äôs a career bartender started posting his stonk advice recently on Instagram. Last week, he posted a screenshot of him going all in on SPY puts... ouch.
I understand that. But all things considered, I.e., unemployment, Covid mutations, political/sociopolitical turmoil, do these things not play into it? Is it strictly, ‚Äúvaccine has been announced so everything is okay,‚Äù?
I'm confused what you're asking. How much am I up or what expiry? Or are you asking what I thought of the earnings call? I didn't listen if the later is the case.

Loving this widespread no fucks given to Donnie‚Äôs whining attitude
it is retarded, but winter isn't even here yet man,think long term. The news can only put out vaccine news every now and then, any other day, everyday the sentiment is still the same with covid cases going parabolic, states shutting down over the country, etc etc which is bring another rotation back into tech.
Puts down, calls down, wtf is happening
Looks like we‚Äôre going to be bouncing around all day
let em chase

XPEV and NiO both make EVs but XPEV is more tailored for middle class. I figured the middle class will be bigger purchasers due to their population.

More active trading usually results in fewer gains compared to holding. It‚Äôs useful to exit positions going to hell, but usually something you grabbed a few % on moons after you sell if you‚Äôre constantly trading.

F , I‚Äôm about to buy rn sell it to me

Nah IV isn‚Äôt as big a factor when they‚Äôre so far out, you have plenty of time for that to recover. Just sit on them

Honestly, though? This was downright vile on his wife's part.
I'd say $19 then, but I'm the bullish one in the family
How do I get RH to display my total buying power+investments instead of only the amount invested in options/stocks?

That takes a real man
Tesla? What do I do
Trump tweet ftw
Dude, no fucking lie. I‚Äôm only a couple thousand from being back in the promise land
Anyone playing DIS puts? Parks still closed, cruises, theaters, D+ viewers getting capped.. after vaccine news fades should fall and puts are cheap rn
Cut losses on $NIO Nov 20 $50c or hold through earnings? The longer I hold the more I hate myself

It‚Äôs strange not to see tsla moving 50+ pts a day.
Ok it‚Äôs dropping every day
Positive vaccine news = boomers making money. I'm not boomer curious enough to rotate
Same thing as last vaccine.

It moons and then reality or wtf this is
SluttQQQ ‚ù§
Done
I think this vaccine news is gonna stick more.  2 vaccines with +90% success rates.  Even though the sample sizes are tiny its promising to see multiple optimistic results.

idk, trading off covid news is often retarded tho
Yes. Except Rkt.
I actually bought short term calls on VIX after that sharp drop to $23.  Fading QQQ today as the big boys rotate (see last Monday) is my assumption the rest of today.
HD and LOW Calls.
U mad bro
I‚Äôm dying at this comment
That is true, there needs to some positive news regarding ANT until then BABA will suffer short term. I opened up a call last Friday thinking the bottom was in, but the fact QQQ is green, and BABA went from red open to green to be red again is telling that we haven't reached the bottom yet.

It's hard to think about just how much having unlimited day trades would change my trading strategy.

*Pocahontas Warren enters the chat.* Breaks up ‚ÄúBig Wall Street.‚Äù 401(k)s in shambles.
yeah i dont understand out of the past 20 trades i made all 20 of them lost money, monthly weekly leaps no matter what I do its simply just wrong
I‚Äôm sorry what do you mean slept with calls and switched to puts? Do you mean on Friday?
Nobody told you? That isn‚Äôt a stock......
I bought some FD puts on moderna at all time highs just now, already looking good, very small position.
Helps if you add ticker...
I don‚Äôt see the upside though. At least FSKR looks nice. What can you say about SOLO. Have u seen them?
market up... fed printing brrrrrrrr...  vgold gold gold gold.  if economy opens up we are going to get the money velocity movement and with it inflation and rates.... lock in your mortgage rates, gonna be a fun ride
[deleted]
Gap ü§£ wtf
I would just like to be in the green a little bit so I can focus on other things
NIO going down makes me smile.
When making plays, just make sure to find all the companies that do the same thing so you can choose the best in breed
SOLO is going down sadly.. there's no way it pumps again
Never sell just because it has gone down a bit. Sell when you feel the company is overvalued or is no longer valuable as a going concern.
what happened
very cool, very legal
Jan 15 '21 $30 Call!!!! I bought a fuckton of these this morning.

You think 3620 is strong support today?
What exp you pick?
360 might be the hard top
Never.
Also, how the fuck is RKT not seeing price movement? Jim Cramer has been hawking it, currently on sale at 33% off, they just put up impressive numbers ($30B in closed loans) and yet the stock is flatter than Taylor Swift‚Äôs ass. It‚Äôs like we are on the fourth stanza of Willy Wonka‚Äôs tunnel madness.

Great NIO buy in opportunity here, going to hit 46-48 today at some point

Right?
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to the vaccine. I meant strictly that Covid cases/deaths are also at ATH
Sure, of course I am. Now, if you'll excuse me I'm still planning on going to meet friends and enjoy my life because I don't care if it gets you angry.

Ah that makes sense. The only part I don‚Äôt understand is why would the dollar being dead result in ATH?

Because usually (as in tradition) once vaccine pump news wears off, covid cases makes headline news again, causing investors to feel uneasy on recovery and sell off recovery stocks and rotate the funds back into Tech. It's a cycle.
For the love of god please no lmao
PLTR buy now before it‚Äôs too late
PUTS
SOLO.....300+ IV.  JFC, you degenerates love dogshit.

NIO XPEV. potential top for today. take profit bulls
That and the fact that BA/AAPL/GOOG, et al., are up big I suppose and they also make up a considerable portion of the S&P‚Äôs trading. Maybe I‚Äôm incorrect though.

It's not a valid concern you fucking imbecile. People like you are going to ruin this for the rest of us. I hope you get covid.
Thats an advantage. They actually own a big piece of each sector of the healthcare market. A lot of people like to look at them as closer to UNH than their sister stock WBA. They own a super profitable insurer in Aetna, a PBM, a pharmacy, obviously, and over the past year or two theyve been working on a new business plan to turn the pharmacy space into much more profitable concentra type urgent care clinics. They are a unicorn and totally undervalued. IMO this is by and far the best value play on the market.

You really had to do Ne-Yo like that?
i started the day down nearly 3k, contemplating life.

Now i recovered that 3k and up another 1.5k additional and pretty happy.

Only 45k more to go before im recovered baby
Markets are forward looking, they are pricing in the end of covid and thus the rebound on gay boomer stocks.

Why ATH - because low interest rates and dollar being DEAD.
Think about why you bought it at fucking 53 in the first place and then realize that you should just hold. NIO to 80 üöÄ
works until it doesnt...positons doe :)

Like butt plugs?
Market hitting all time highs, but DKNG doing that thing where it stays red regardless. I HATE this stock man. It never goes up.
I will call my first new born COTY

Monday morning, Citigroup analyst [Jeff Chung](https://www.barrons.com/articles/buy-nio-stock-analysts-keep-saying-one-calls-it-a-long-term-winner-51602790948?mod=article_inline) upgraded [Li Auto](https://www.barrons.com/quote/LI) (ticker: LI) to Buy from Hold and increased his price target to $45.60 from $27.10‚Äîor more than 68%. The upgrade comes after Li stock has [gained 59%](https://www.barrons.com/articles/li-auto-stock-skyrockets-after-earnings-report-51605273021?mod=article_inline) over the past month.

In boosting his target price, Chung appears to have become more optimistic about fourth-quarter and 2021 EV sales in China. His new target values Li at roughly [15 times](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-expensive-valuation-wall-street-jargon-pe-ebitda-earnings-51589225609?mod=article_inline) estimated 2021 sales. [Tesla](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TSLA) (TSLA), for comparison, is trading for about eight times estimated 2021 sales.

Li is growing faster than Tesla, off a small base of vehicle sales, but the Chinese EV valuation multiples don‚Äôt have any precedent. Li and its peer [Xpeng](https://www.barrons.com/quote/XPEV) (XPEV) became publicly traded companies in the summer.

NIO tomorrow: ‚ÄúI have earnings tomorrow! We should speculatively pump‚Äù

NIO after earnings beating expectations: ‚ÄúI beat expectations, but at what cost?‚Äù

 *DUMPS*
You still have earnings. XPEV rose 30% on earnings, not saying NIO will do the same but it‚Äôs likely to hit a big rally, followed by a dip again with the sell off

I‚Äôm cash gang right now just waiting to come back in, but I‚Äôm waiting for the post earnings dip
dats literally change lol, i was down 70% on my baba before i cut that limb off

Yeah its pretty volatile but should be headed up
Hold shares and sell weekly covered calls then buy more shit
Same
my NIO call expires 11/27. not sure if i should sell before earnings to prevent IV crush or hold through earnings? 55 strike btw
Lmao imagine paying thousands of dollars to go at sea in a Covid petri dish.
This is also what i was thinking.
No way.   3 day rally at least on Moderna news.
I feel like you're mostly correct. However  there's the hughes ammendment act. Id give my left nut for a mp40, uzi, p90.
As a gay bear, I don‚Äôt want the market to go to $0. I simply want it to go to a level that makes sense. Do you think the big guys just laugh at us as they inflate this market more and more?

Yeah only it‚Äôs a slow burn approach. I don‚Äôt want to wait a year to double my meagre capital.
There is big downside potential if it breaks 258 with some volume to go down to 235. So tread carefully.  

This comes from someone who is already in and can‚Äôt afford to further DCA.

I'm so consistently good at timing the top and bottom of things, but always buying the wrong thing. Even when I inverse myself, I end up doing the wrong thing. Guh
Rope seems more viable than it hitting $53 again
Because I‚Äôm retarded and broke I have 2 $57c 11/20 and was buying into the hype that it was gonna hit the moon by open so the morning has been rough
The fed has promised unlimited qe and are perfectly happy with a 2+% inflation rate which implies more like 2.5-3%. Current inflation is around 1.5. Lot of room to run for spy upwards before the eventual correction. Buying puts just cause you feel it‚Äôs too high is burning money
It‚Äôs a W shaped recovery

No one can figure out why it‚Äôs so high. I‚Äôm trying to find some underlying good news that would be pumping it, to no avail.

MARA pump let‚Äôs go
Idk why it‚Äôs down but i might get calls anywau
im thinking about giving up trading the way the bulls have killed me this year
You buy a call and sell a call for same expiration. Buy a 30 call and sell a 35 for April.
profit is profit my guy. honestly I could see it dipping back down to that level this afternoon, given earnings is after market today and I can't find shit about them. Then again, they're in China, so they might have autisticly high earnings because of that CCP money
No, this is Patrick
It‚Äôs a trap
Wtf baba
I don‚Äôt know
Shorter run?
NIO or Ne-yo‚Äôs music career?
wtf, do we cop? does wsb run paypal up?
Of course I buy BABA thinking it's going to bounce back. Faked me out. Fuck me

Do you have a chart? I can't make anything out from the table.
Yea but maybe not today. Don‚Äôt be ridiculous. Shits retarded strong but people are unrealistic with expectations. It‚Äôs back to where it was a few days ago 40-45 zone
Yeah  postponed infidelity.   It was just like when they were selling cruise tickets for the latter part of this year,  like they were really going to be sailing somewhere.

That's up to you but "tHe DeMs ArE cOmInG fOr OuR gUnS" is the same played out message any time a Democrat takes the oval office. Yet it never happens. I can only tell you how many times that I sat with Republicans friends on football sundays and they'd say the same thing throughout Obama's 2 terms. Never happened once. At this point, I'm certain it's the gun makers themselves taking advantage of people's stupidity and paranoia to pump their merchandise

Yes I‚Äôm well aware. My parents worked/work in the cruise line industry, which is how I even heard about this. And if you knew anything you‚Äôd know those island ports they go to don‚Äôt want cruises right now because they can‚Äôt afford a corona outbreak on a small island with limited hospital materials. Yes, those islands have a tourism economy that thrives off tourists spending money at local retail and doing excursions, but they wont risk the whole island having a corona breakout.

It's 3 months from the start of the next month + all vacation days you have left. And if they don't want you in the building they send you home but still have to pay you and you can get another job.

So If they fire you on the 1st and you have 20 vacation days they pay you salary every month for 4 months and on the last month you get an extra month. And if you are super lucky and they don't want you there and you get a job the same month you basically get 9 months of salary in 4 months.
Mmmm..... true. Barry was the best gun salesman for 8 years in a row. I also bought a few, but not out of fear. I just wanted a hobby that allowed me to be outdoors, and deer hunting seemed fun at the time. (It is fun, however finding a big ass piece of land to hunt on is a bitch)
that's really to avoid privacy concerns - e.g. "herr derr google and apple collect my data lets file antitrust suits!" they make software for data. it's like saying "i don't smoke pot but i sell it doe"

I‚Äôm leaning towards a buy, but the stock is so manipulated that it‚Äôs impossible to tell. I think it‚Äôll sell off at the end of the day only to pump tomorrow. But it could very well just pump all day. Regardless, I think calls at least two weeks out are a decent buy.

SPY is almost there
BA was at 230 not so long ago.
Something tells me these old fucks are just salty and jealous.

The chart says we can pick the stocks out better than they can, no? So why does the writer go off and start trashing us? Then proceeds to give one example of someone losing their money?

At least when we lose our money we laugh about it. We‚Äôre not jumping out of windows or writing stupid hit pieces on the Internet.

What the hell are you on about?? Are you 12?
Why is TSM up so much today
I'd be worried about WMT psting some big numbers with their plus plan and that hitting AMZN price.

If it does and AMZN dips then buy
uh oh Donnie tweeted about the market. Get out now !!
XPENG is valued 12X current sales, LI 10X current sales, NIO 9X current sales.
...yes
If vaccine effectiveness news had come before elections, Trump would have won. 

Change my mind. 

Bitch.
Even a ü•≠ tweet isn't going to bring this day down...
Sell, dont be greedy
In anticipation of NVDA ER? 9% seems massive though for an ER pop especially for TSM.
We go up today, flat tmr, down bigly after that
Moderna vaccine meant travel pump at open just like last time. Connect the dots you kindergartener.
Going to be like this the rest of the day
Nio is dead :( I got out w loss. Gg

>When biden gets in and starts mucking the gun trade up it seems to me like trying to find a bottom and holding massive shares and waiting.

>People aren't turning in their guns anytime soon.

Ya drinking that Republican cool aid. Biden, just like Obama, ain't going to do shit about gun rights.
NO WHAT THE FUCK?!?!? the only reason im here is cuz the McFlurry machine at MCD is broken
Yeah CCL and PLAY (lmao look at that jump) puts dragging my wins down today and all I can do is chuckle. Hopefully things cool off later today or tomorrow or I guess I'll just accept the loss and look for a better entry point for puts.

Now that Andrea is dead, I'm sure Andrew forgot all about being court ordered to pay for half of the billionaire bfs mansion.

There's just no way Andrew could be motivated by the bfs Chinese EV investments.

Nah

Anything goes wrong with vaccines and energy will tumble
Somebody tell this retard about GME
Dunno. Why not do a 25/30 spread. At a minimum a 30/40 or 30/35
Appreciate the concern brother but like I said, I'm lucky enough to not have a lot of expenses because I'm on scholarship so I feel safe and secure in what I'm doing. Plus I do shares, not options, (so less risk) and I'm doing well.

Think or swim working fine here.
I would rather hold a small lotto ticket and buy momentum after earnings and IV crush than YOLO. Also it wouldn't be -50%, it would be 80-90% with crush. I'll throw 2% of my portfolio at an 11/20 60 call tho lol

The only thing I can see these Cruise lines trying to do to make some cash from Americans is sail out into open waters from a main port such as Miami  for a few days then come back to shore.   That would be most likely the only options because most ports are not going to open their doors to them as it would be too much of a risk.

You‚Äôre an autist if you believed that retard
Alright.... trying to figure out a long play. Assuming biden takes office w/wo ü•≠ causing a shit show. Gun stock will drop..... guaranteed. However this brings about a long term and short term opportunity for the truly retarded. Guns and ammo have been flying off of the shelves. Most places still have the 2 box per customer policy. Supply vs demand. People aren't turning in their guns anytime soon. When biden gets in and starts mucking the gun trade up it seems to me like trying to find a bottom and holding massive shares and waiting. Thoughts? (Calls are to risky because of decay and low volume. I also would rather buy as much as I can and not in 100 blocks) so buy low. Sell to make original invest back, ride the rest....
Basically range bound between 115 and 123. Can make decent money playing that range but eventually it‚Äôs going to need to do something.
ik man. I thought this would make me break even on my all time chart. quite the opposite, haha

The avg purchase is something like 20 euros, believe it or not there are actual countries in Africa that are not Sudan or The Congo, and yes they do use e commerce.

Doubling down on SPY puts üí™
Do you know how much business the cruise lines bring to the world, employees around the world, and allow the rich/wealthy to travel while being pampered, and purchase in huge quantities products/food a week, they setup tours and bring in business to the local ports and cities they visit, they bring 2000-5000 passengers PER SHIP a week to every port, AND MORE..

Lets just say I have friends on the inside working for the "cruise lines".. 

They all tell me its just postponed and those "friends" have even been flown out by "cruise companies" to prepare for next year's business...
Buy your puts EOD especially on SPY
You trying to get some sheets from restoration hardware?
I wouldn't take being called an idiot or anything like that to heart here. On the bright side you can use the sub's willingness to critique to see if a trading plan of your's makes sense. Just wait to see if people reply to you with "that's retarded" or not. That being said, because this is wsb they could be calling a perfectly fine trading plan retarded because they themselves are retarded.

Have seen this before to know that NIO 50 eod
Am I the only theta gang here on NIO trying to make solid but not insane money or is everyone in lottery ticket mode
But how do you justify the price atm. Its been falling since its IPO, not certain where it‚Äôll land before going parabolic.
CHADSDAQ going for the intraday Boomer cuck.
Donny tweeted about the market. Hold onto your butts
How high spy going this week? 370?
Come on break that $362 babe
Dude: his ex, Andrea? Yeah she fucking DIED earlier this year.

So your theory is that he's doing this to get back at his DEAD EX WIFE?

Ur fine, I‚Äôd roll it into 2021 tho
Buy NIO while it's dipping
NIO rotation into solo
Not buying anymore puts, but also not selling

I agree that NIO is a stupid investment at this price, but I also know that everyone is searching for the next Tesla and people believe NIO could be it. I don‚Äôt think betting against that mindset wins most of the time
The volume in $NIO is just bonkers

Thoughts on SPCE??
Are you me? I"ve got a lot tied up in LOW/TGT calls.

LOW 170c 12/4 and TGT 170c 12/18.

Much more confident on TGT taking my account to the moon than Lowes, but I also figure these plays aren't likely to burn me.
Guys why is RH website so slow is it just me? Help thanks!
Exited my SPY calls early because of the Trump tweet. Fat fuck is not robbing my gains again.
I scalped it :)
üôè
I just wonder how its possible to lose this much
TRUMP TWEET ABOUT ALL TIME HIGHS. DUMP IT
I would if I didn‚Äôt lose it all by going all in on puts Friday :/

I hope man, I already made my nut this year, but itd be nice to get a boost from these calls.
Again ,  I have been watching travel for some time and it is not coming back buddy for awhile. lol    The only idiots that are traveling right now are in the US mostly from another American in Asia.    

Stimulus $$$$   Still waiting for those empty promises from the US govt I see.    US economy never closed in most parts and its still dying in most areas ---->  Now what is next plan ?  

Travel sector will retrace down especially these airlines and cruise lines .  It is a no brainer here.  Will they be as low as March lows ,  no but they will retrace back near the runups they had over the last few weeks once the news is gone and reality sets in again. lol
Thank you Donald! Very cool.
Trump is the shoe shine boy lmao

Altimmune had a pretty big dip, and looks like it's pretty undervalued at the moment.

They're expected to begin Phase 1 clinical trials on an intranasal vaccine in January that can be held in the same temperatures as Moderna. They're also anticipated to become profitable after the first quarter. Keep an eye out for their virtual calls over the next couple of days.
Listen to your gut, nobody knows. Lots of money to be made fast, but also lots of money to be lost even faster

My Boeing (BA) shares finally went positive after I've been bag holding them since March...I think it has to do with that news story about a Boeing running over a gay bear on a runway. The story was posted here on WSB. 

&#x200B;

Position: After the first march dip I bought some Boeing shares. Then the market double dipped and these bags weighed down my portfolio for nearly 8 months. So glad I didn't sell at a loss.
hopping off, gonna cool down, dont see any trades rn, wbu guys
I was up now I'm not feel bad
TSM??? News???

I pussied out of my 90/100 spreads awhile back smh

no better feeling than selling and watching the rug pull happen a few seconds later
I sure as shit did! Leaps and they are printing!
Tbh, I mostly play plug power. It‚Äôs volatile but you should be good if buy out 3 weeks near itm prices
Not shareholders
Well I mean, 25% OTM because it‚Äôs ER week, I got 2% for 10 delta. I usually sell 20 delta
Bears are gay and getting fuked but theta gang is the pervert who watching how bears and bulls get fucking while jerking off his small dick
Nio is at a day trader's intraday dip. I think it will run up until earnings, then selloff, or pump. So a safe play is to sell some just before earnings then load up if it tanks.

They technically beat on earnings but fell short on revenue. Growth looks good, but they are basically sitting at ATH

There‚Äôs a reason this tard is losing
It went from around $15/share (at last earnings call) to $44\~ right now (right before earnings tomorrow). You are looking at perfection tomorrow + significant surprise upside to guidance for this to rally post earnings. Risky
Buffet stake
FUCK THIS GUY

Saw the bounce, but we're still 24 hours out. Hey, maybe it won't dump at open tomorrow... I'm holding, so that would be great too.
Dear Mr Bezos sir, please go back up.  The world still needs you.
Yes I went with LI out of the 3.  IV definitely killed down from last week but thigs will pick up if this continues.

Goddamit AMZN, wtf is wrong with your stupid ass?
5000*9.8 or 79000-29000 is to hard to calculate?
Are the rumours about PYPL true?
The laws of WSB inversion clearly state we should be hammering puts for earnings.

Are NIO calls worth it right now? Or are the prices too high to get any return/IV crushed?
If you loaded BA calls after it was up $12 idk
Wtf BYND? You were supposed to moon
Who said that? The most bullish call I know was 6800 by 2025 from Cathie Wood.

Could still happen assuming they execute.

They will hit. XLE is going to mid 50s by summer 2021. People have underestimated how many rigs were shut down due to COVID and the drastic drop in demand. Once demand ramps up again, there will be a lag in how quickly supply can be ramped up to match that demand. And that mismatch in supply and demand will cause oil prices to shoot up.
TSM 1/15 $120c is the move, a 5G company that consistently beats earnings
why
I have, lost it today. Feels really shitty and depressed.
The fate of my portfolio lies in BABA
The Fed's response to pandemic/lockdown which led to those 'printer goes brrr' memes
Sell nio here?
GME 11.5c 11/27 bought at open this morning üí¶üí¶üí¶

It's not too late to get on this üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

Just don't hold for too long like the autists last month.  Cash out and roll profits. Now that the weak hands have been shaken out, GME is about to take off!

The PRPL guy was staring down the barrel before being rewarded joining our dos comma club.

Remember, it's always darkest before the dawn.
Wait until ER before you sell if you do

Thanks for the lambo funding
Sold my WMT calls for 420% profit. I know they'll kill earnings but every time they do it falls because "priced in" aka WMT always goes to ATH right before earnings. If this is the one exception me selling calls is why
You welcome I can guarantee it will go up until my puts expire 11.27 so you should have at least 2 more weeks of non stop ripping up

Agreed for the mRNA "vaccines" but tbh I don't consider them vaccines. I find it incredibly misleading for people to call them "vaccines" when they are a completely different technology.

A traditional vaccine like I've gotten tons of times? I'd be okay with that.

I really don't understand why companies are pushing mRNA. Maybe they're easier to develop, so they're going all in on them since they think they'll get immunity from lawsuits. If they didn't expect to get immunity, maybe we'd see traditional, safe vaccines.

there will not be a "crash and burn" just a correction and then another boring usual grind up after..


You seem to not realize that everybody is now "trained" to "buy the dip" on any "crash" you say.

So remember if the market were to "drop", that is a buying opportunity for those who have been wanting gains this whole time.

And right there is enough to prove it won't drop as who wants to sell when there is going to be more push up since we have new products, news on vaccine, a new stimulus coming, and the opening of the economy in full coming in the future?
Come on PLTR, hit 15 for my limit order god dammit
Makes 30k a year, trades 50k in a single trade... nice

SO what's the prediction for NIO? It goes one way or another right? Moons til EOW or tanks? But does a solid ER even matter? Is everyone pulling out just due to fear of IV crush?

Trump‚Äôs tweet appealing to ‚Äúhistorians‚Äù to note that vaccines were developed on ‚Äúmy watch‚Äù shows where his head is really at. You do not write that if you think you‚Äôre only halfway though your ‚Äúwatch‚Äù. He knows he‚Äôs done. Calls on everything. Election drama should finally be over soon.
Thank you for your service.

Apple is literally going back to ATH and people want to talk about puts? Hope your future children like food lines.
I am looking into doing something like this myself. Do you mind sharing info about how you went from comment to sentiment? Like did you look for keywords in the string? Depending on people specifically mentioning exact positions? Or is there some social sentiment library that can be used on text?? Thanks, very interesting stuff.
I'm not in NIO but I'm watching it today.  I think you definitely have a chance to see NIO back to $50, maybe even today the way this is struggling to find a price.  But this is the riskiest of stocks to be in right now.
markets all time highs already, next to the moon??
This is beautiful, üòÇ so good in fact it brought tears to my eyes. So good it‚Äôs my very first comment in this here shit hole. Please someone remind us of this play come next month.
What do you predict?
Soros invested in it so it should start printing soon. Nowhere near the meme potential NIO has though
Nice,    Admitting it is the first step.  I just bought the $90c 1/15
i swore off puts but ba move is tempting me
Carnival should not be up 12%, PUTS WILL PAY

damn 55% loss. I‚Äôve had a few of those they were soul crushing. hope your 3/31 calls print
he told us he doesnt really care what we do. its like a side project that he assigns so that people can learn all types of trading (some kids in this class are about to graduate college and have never actually touched stock trading). the Prof said that he wants us to maximize sharpe ratio but it wont actually fuck our grade over if we dont, and in his words 'the highest return is the winner.'  Realistically with 6 weeks to do the project, buy and hold is not a good strategy for actual gains (especially with election volatility, etc). The GME play was my big fuckup, I was short thousands of shares and then flipped at the top because I was worried about a margin call. Had I held my group wouldve been up over 20%. So hes not gonna fail us for doing any retard strategy. But I wanna win
Q‚Äôs up, please murder me
I did last week, just don't wanna deal with Jack Ma being on China's shit list right now. Has great potential to rocket obviously but I just don't wanna deal with it right now.
should i hold through earnings or sell before EOD i'm struggling üòÇ
I bought the top of GME at this price point a few weeks back, did the sensible thing and inversed myself today with some puts.

I think its a great buy. I just don't have any powder left to go in
Does not mean jack  lol    30k then crash and burn  is a possibility as well.   Flips coin
Well... maybe XPEv can overtake nio today? P- p- pls
Could always just be a hedge on a short position

damn wtf.. did JD reported bad earnings or some shit
Too late to hop on NIO? Been on LI for a month or two and they‚Äôve been on very similar paths
35% in 30 min on tsm less go
Bruh what, I‚Äôm long on NIO too, but you spitting BS like this just makes NIO look bad. Xpev targets a different market, they sell affordable cars. Not Luxury cars like NIO and Tesla. And xpev sells cars in China, Asia, and Europe. Even has manufacturing plants in Norway
Buy a couple Oz of weed and sell dubs at a mark up until you have $1,000 and slam it all on NIO puts.
Great Thanks. How do you determine entries and exits?

Waking up late worked out. Didn‚Äôt give me an opportunity to do anything dumb at open. 

Still have the rest of the day for that.
These fucking assholes are just trying to get people to jump ship from NIO today to buy in at a lower price. They know that NIO earnings are going to fucking boom. NIO is the only EV automaker in China that actually has cars out in the road.

do u want IV crush or
Get puts
I'm going to be frank: If I was your professor, even if you had the best returns, I would fail you if I saw your portfolio strategy was to simply gamble with options. It sounds like your area of study is one that would lead you to manage money for others or for businesses. It's one thing to gamble with your own money. It's another to gamble with the money of others. If my assumption is correct, my advice would be to write your paper explaining why gambling on options with the entire portfolio is a grossly irresponsible thing for any fund manager to do and honestly one that would lead to serious legal ramifications.
its massive runup and ccp meddling
shhhh stop talking about Boeing. Let the algos focus on NIO while we take flight #BAbies gang
Can we start banning niottards?
PLUG THE NEW NIO TELL YOUR FRIENDS
It's only up by about a percentage point. No biggie. INTC was bound to go up anyway. It's been battered so badly these past few weeks.
I honestly don‚Äôt know what to trade right now. Puts don‚Äôt feel safe. Calls don‚Äôt feel safe. We‚Äôre stuck in this place where we could have a vaccine or go back into lockdown at any moment and it just feels like gambling at this point.
My play lottos are often SLV. That thing's options are never priced right and it breaks 1 sig week after week since covid.

One of the ways to do it yes. You can also take a short position (AKA buy a put)
I have so much stock going long but I also still am hoping for a good old rug pull in the short term

I think it will .  Question is the timing .  Right now they doing a real deep run up and Im waiting for it to cease before adding more shorts.  I am watching till end of week to see how far they run it.    They literally have barely any profits and will not have any for awhile

SDC is also completely dogshit compared to align. I just want to buy myself something nice for Christmas so I gambled üòî
After lol
NIO GO UP YOU FUCK
You don't nut when you find the top? You don't belong here

I bet you‚Äôre one dumb mother fucker. I might be wrong, but I‚Äôm not.
Buy Nio calls now or after earnings?
Bless up for 22
No way ccl should be this high
stop looking at it retard

check back every 3 months or some shit
Nio 10p 11/20  gamestip 15c 11/20 either nio is full of lies or it isn't. Either gme moons or it doesn't.
nobody burns oil for electricity bruh.
You clearly missed late March through June lmao
I've got 100 Boeing shares ~ $170 and $220C 1/15/21. I'm with ya lad.

No you didn't. Show us your puts. lol
Up 20% on pypl calls bought 20 min ago
 What happened to MRNA calls? MRNA up 7% today but calls are down 26%???
cutting the video right as the last guy jumped has left me feeling incredibly unsatisfied
I‚Äôm new to this, do I exercise it or sell?
My NLS calls are basically worthless now. Fuck you MRNA.
We all know NIO is going sky high before EOD tomorrow....don't try to fight it bears
yes
tech calls and SPY puts. everything that could go wrong went wrong today
What‚Äôs the GME hype from?
Anyone see anything interesting here - it‚Äôs 10:45 and I am bored.
SPY CALLS SPY CALLS SPY CALLS
Considering there‚Äôs 2 vaccines with 90%+ efficacy, I‚Äôm gonna say Q2 2021.
A Boeing 737 running over and killing a bear in Alaska should be a warning sign for all BA üåà üêª
Same thing tbh.
Would you autist be interested in smaller incremental options like options for sub day intervals?
I had 11/27 $280 that I sold at a 55% loss. I have March 21 $280‚Äôs I‚Äôm holding though.
Tesla officially a boomer stock.
do u do research or do u yolo
Such is life
They do until they don‚Äôt
I actually think most will continue on with the bikes, due to convenience.  Speaking as one that loved gyms but got a bike for this, there's no comparison in terms of time saved commuting to gym and all associated time.  That said, I do miss squats/deadlifts, but am considering picking up a cheap membership to get those while using PTON for yoga/cardio/etc.  I think a lot of people think similarly from what I've read.
Bold. Align was at a different point on the covid cycle when it announced earnings....
rumored by you alone or what?
Would be nice üòÑ
Thank God my SPCE order last Friday didn't fill.
Damn it‚Äôs NIO? This whole time I thought you guys were talking about INO

Li gets a upgrade, xpev gets upgrade, you know how the holy trinity works?
$5 gap up not enough for spy needs to run $5 today, then gap up $10 tn, run $5 more tm, repeat repeat no dips ever again

100 shares a contract? I‚Äôve been paying my bookie for 1000 per contract, I think I‚Äôm getting ripped off.

SPY is now gonna stay flat until everyone dumps puts and people finally take profits lol
Profited and then lost most when I got greedy and bought calls and shares at peak. I knew it was in a bubble but didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd pop until at least 55
Which companies sell ultra cold freezers? Shits gotta be booming

Thank you targ√© manager for confirmation.

The key here isn't just great sales numbers which are priced in.

The reason for the 10% pop tomorrow is Walmart plus subscription growth.

I can only imagine!
Buffet rumored to be buying PayPal
GME is like, maybe not today.
Fly me to BA moon, let me trade among the stars

and let me see what green is like on robinhood all time.
10? Try 250
when did you buy ? and strike ?
Dont know why anyone would play these, there are way better contracts for other stocks
Preach
yeah.. good for leaps and long term shares..
Fuck that would just be too tempting.

Maybe by calls a couple weeks out to 88
Well done, friend! So you have around 10000 shares? I hope it goes to 100 so you can get your million.
It literally just hit 8.50 two seconds later üòÇ
Because it's overvalued?
I purchased my 1/15 a long time ago and have been bag holding this shit for months. Its finally reaching the strike of 155 but it would need a 160 push to be itm. I'm hopeful as they will crush earnings, but this world could go to shit at any moment.

Yeah none of this shit makes sense. No stimulus and new covid restrictions popping up all over the country? Guess that means all time highs? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Calls on SPCE today.
With all these vaccines coming out and the market being forward looking, this is actually an excellent time to get into XLE. 

But according to this subreddit, oil is dead; even though the electricity used to recharge all their favourite EVs come from natural gas and oil. 

In the next 12 months, I am willing to bet that XLE will outperform QQQ and SPY. I'm so confident in this bet that I bought 2022 Jan leaps for it. LFG!!
Nevermind its down again
It looks like a robot penis.
you're so cucked
I don't know what to do with this new information.
You sure?
It's so weird seeing SQ sitting at this level. Shit used to be the king of all pumps

Smart money don‚Äôt make money
Have you already profited a lot, or are you driving options only?
calls always have a chance opposed to puts.  Those puts someone but at the bottom there will only bleed for the day.  Those calls right at open already back to what I purchased them at.
Stimmy=cruise vacation
Convinced that 98% of WSB is jacked to the tits in GME.

Have some perspective here. You‚Äôre already way more retarded than any of the other kids in this class. By the time they‚Äôre landing their first jobs out of undergrad, you‚Äôll have already lost your first 100K of someone else‚Äôs money. Forget about the stock game and think about the bright career ahead of you.

Good reason to just buy shares or leaps IMO

Cardboard boxes are cheap, bruh
I thought I was supposed to be making money today.
Was gonna pull the trigger on SPX 0dte calls and pussied out. Missed out on 100% gain in 45 mins.
Lol from my experience people don't think that way. It's all about treating themselves first and not worrying about the mortgage etc
I‚Äôm up 33% in 4 trading days on 1/2022 17c. Is it gain porn worthy? No. Due I have a lot of peace of mind not gambling on weeklies with a 5% chance to get a 5 bagger, 95% chance to lose most of it? Absolutely. Gl

Time for more SPCE calls or should I wait?
why the hell is PTON still dumping
It‚Äôs the equivalent to a gym membership. They‚Äôll cancel and sell their bike when pandemics over. Anymore vaccine news will continue to kill it.
So disappointed in you JD. Good thing I got you when you were cheap.
Yes but pandemics aren't every year

Total cost of an employee includes things like offic/facilities cost and perks, and can be around twice the salary.
Should probably do DD before just chucking your money into puts. They got bought out
Just got a 100 dollar tip, where's can I lose the most money?
Ita not possible to win in pa. Follow the news
Why JD tanking? Were earnings bad?
god dammit i got out at $4 a while ago thinking yeaaaahhh buddy i timed the top

I thought the sample size was small and wonder what the actual efficacy among the broad population will be
Calls on cruise lines because.umm, uhhh,.the vaccine. The first thing people people.are.going to do is get on a cruise: finding employment, keeping their mortgages that just came out of forbearance from defaulting, rebuilding their savings...these are all secondary to having a good time on some money that supposedly comes from somewhere.
my real account is -80% rn too
Is the EV pump dead?
3 bonus points? Just study for an extra hour breh.

Yes, they jump on good news, making puts dirt cheap. And people will sell off cruise shares if the CDC cancels their whole business. Bro do you realize we aren‚Äôt on r/investing? I literally called it a speculative bet. Should‚Äôve left it at ‚Äúgood day sir‚Äù. You ain‚Äôt looking too smart rn

No way BA holds 200. All of my puts depend on it.

A good ole Amish shunning is more effective than beating him with a strap, but I would suggest both the shun and the strap.  Maybe a ritualistic branding to alert others of his shame.

NO, It means you want to take a "chance" on wasting money buying "time decaying puts" on cruise lines when they are not going to go out of business, are literally going to jump up on any good news, and who wants to "sell off" cruise shares that cost $15/share etc??


- The point is the only puts ANYONE should be buying is 3-6 month puts out for late next year to try to capture any downside of the major indexes, especially as the S&P gets close to 3800..
Retail manager here. Not Walmart but somewhat same market. This quarter rev is fucking insane. I‚Äôm talking 80%+ yoy comp.   
Not sure if this is priced in tho as it‚Äôs expected that they will show great numbers. But imo, for my Corp, the growth will beat the expected growth.
Fuck bidders bro I just want to sell my call and close my Robinhood app for the day üôÑüò´

10/10 troll
they are being acquired for 19.25 a share.. its not our of nowhere. Put puts if you hate money.
Go AMD go, you beautiful fuck.
y‚Äôall buying this SOLO dip or nah
No. He bought a call at $45 strike price and exercised it
Shit, I keep getting bored and selling my PSTH position then buying back in at a higher price. Apparently Nov and Dec call volume is WAY up this morning, someone knows something.
You‚Äôre delusional
I'm thinking of not trading as actively and lust loading up on 3 month out spy calls 5% otm. At least this way I have a strategy and I'm not just bleeding money on memes
puts?! in this economy?!
Fuck that I will be out so hard
I don't think so. Volume is solid and price is slowing going up. Shorts are trying to cover without driving up the price.

Retail shorts are going to panic when GME is up 15 to 20% today.

You are also assume that retail doesn't see a stock up 10% and pile it assuming it is recovery stock because of Vaccine.

Bought
AMD going to quietly grind up to $85, then test $90 I am fucking confident

Holding $90 Dec 19, got about 20 contracts at 60% profit

I am going to trim some and roll those into $85 shorter expiry
MRNA $92P 11/20
No which is why it's running out again. It's ridiculous. When Wallstreet bets has the most sane advice, you know that society took a wrong turn somewhere.
GME doesn't need our confirmation
so it's basically gonna ride at 361.5 all day

question is, in the last 30 minutes, does it blast through ATH or go back to 352

This fucking plane can't get a break! First it crashes, now this.

Our parents are quite old fashioned but they love him and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd understand although my father would be a bit shocked for sure. 

Please advise.
I hope
Cant blame them.  Long road for them to become millionaires.

Take out another loan and double down on some 0 DTE OTM calls.
What earnings are we playing this week?
Just go long on PLTR shares and buy LEAPs
Careful holding NIO through unless you've got like leaps. It's looking right now like around an $11 dollar move. If you get up, take profits or open a spread maybe.
Why the hell is NIO option volatility dying? Go back to 300%
I thought my $25 1/2022 were stupid. OP you are a wild boi üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fair point
Fck yeah
It‚Äôs up 10%
PLTR 35 EOH
Don‚Äôt do it. They got bought out. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs up. They‚Äôre going private and the new owner is buying out all the shares.
Every time TSLA rips in the morning red to green, it just sells off, it‚Äôs so fucking annoying
NIO is the only thing keeping me green today
I think if there is any reason at all it will go up. Including crushing earnings. People are waiting for a reason
He texted me
Agreed, i'm just wondering if they still won't be both needed because of production quantity. Full disclose, I bought close to 200 PFE at 39.5$, I'm not too scared to lose that money or to leave it there for a long time if necessary.
Are we winning yet?
By "Fuck boys" I'm assuming you mean bears
If you weren‚Äôt bag holding since since the low $10s and 20 and you hold NIO through earnings you‚Äôre brave and I respect it

It just anecdotal from how I'm seeing spy move. Buying rushes in on the tiniest dips to push it back up. It looks like defensive buying to me.

It is stupid to buy puts on companies that skyrocket on pumps.. They know what they are doing, they buy in on insider news and more, they try to get the herd to jump in with them, and they also hold it up and even buy more to take money from people they know who will short it.

NIO, XPEV and LI move together that‚Äôs beautiful... Even more money
Shoulda sold your puts at open like the real chads
Nio was the first play i hit it big on. This was back when we were hoping it would cross $20. Good times.
Your probably right.......my train of thought was that its possible earning crushes it and Nio rockets, if not then there's still a couple months to recover
we‚Äôre gonna take this company into the fuckin stratosphere

You win some, you lose some.  

Or in my case you lose some, then you lose more, then you win a little, then you lose even more.
More and likely a company that‚Äôs a pump and dumb and when be gone faster then it came
it will hit 30 eventually but calls could be fuk, depends on expiry
TESVLA
It‚Äôs positioned both as a tech stock and a recovery stock. With things turning back on at any level it‚Äôs bullish for them. Their rsi is decent compared to the rest of the market especially, and they are flat today so I‚Äôm getting in on that. And they‚Äôve been stealing market share which will come out in the earnings report.
WE'RE IN IT NOW BOYZ. THE BIG GREEN IS UPON UZ

25k. The company is engaged too heavily with US government. If new administration changes there is a likelihood for PLTR to lose more. Suggest you take profit.
It depends, who's your broker?

Earnings will be good. If you're going to sell do it right after.
PLTR has some green dildos, I think that is good, BUT I am a simple feller
Why is the small rise making you more nervous? Because it‚Äôs more unpredictable behavior than a dip would have been?
Grats man!
For some reason I do not think NIO is going to tank after earnings.
I also wanna know

Not sure why but I bought PTON $110 11/27
you're retarded

Paper handed my NIO calls there, shit

Dude sold right away because he's so poor that even a few percentage points would scare him off. Don't show us your margins, show us your face as PLTR is dropping a little and tell us you're still holding.
If youre investing in FSR, make sure you get **leaps dated for May or longer,** they won't have a prototype built of their EV cars until May latest, and won't be sold to consumers in 2022 earliest.

VIX monthly contracts expire Wednesday morning. If... If a sell off is coming soon, that would be a likely time for it to start. But watch out because the market is representing an intention to grind up. I say that because I'm seeing a lot of aggressive micro dip buying since the election rally.
And everyone is talking about their shares... Probably 2-3 shares...

NIO will trickle up today to get all the weak handed bulls with fomo back in. Then it‚Äôs going to plummet.  We all know this stock is a long term winner, but that‚Äôs not how the game is played short term.
Because everyone passed out
This NIO pump doesn‚Äôt feel reliable... i‚Äôm out
Don't worry guy's NIO had to step away for the weekend to do some business. But, he's back and he's getting the lube ready for the bears

It‚Äôs literally free money bc it‚Äôs the inverse of my position and I never make money
As a call holder I was optimistic and said $43. Now I am not even going try. I‚Äôm just going to let NIO do it‚Äôs thing ü§©
WOW. Epic fail. 

I guess you must of missed the the thousands of PLTR gain posts over the past week.
Wut
Is it a buy with COVID spikes?
PRPL PLTR TDOC

Those are pretty much the only things I see on sale today
Zoom said sike u thought
Been saying CHWY will do well even post pandemic it is common sense and some analyst says that and people rush to buy it.

If we break past this resistance at $12 we‚Äùre heading to the moon
What strikes you playing? Been wanting to get into prpl
FSR, who hurt you??
Hope you can get over that 5 dollar loss
cuz it's delayed by covid in NM?
How about holding and selling covered calls? Or is that the same as wheeling?
ya pop those blood vessels daddy

Wtf crsr doing tings
Aw shit. Pack it up bears, looks like we fuk
I just sold my swing like a retard
I saw someone else say it was delayed earlier on here, don't have a source
Nice finger painting!
üêª awfully quiet bout NIO now
No,didn't learn anything and wasn't aware showing I was new to the place was a sin lol 

Thanks for the info, I'll definitely be looking into learning more on my own and not asking for help here anymore as I've seen where that gets me üòÖ
Is GME a good buy rn or am I suffering FOMO
What all you holding? I‚Äôm holding 5/21 C $20
It literally WILL. NOT. MOVE.
I sold my nio call when it touched green on behalf of my nio bulls in order for the moon mission to continue. In PLTR rn, but NIO 50 EOW. Fuk Nio Bears
Need to dip in order to launch
Think its a little oversold, just hold if you have anything more than weeklies.
Thoughts on GME puts after this squeeze?
1/15 260c
BTI get in
Exactly, he‚Äôs proving the statistic. People are more likely to post wins
Please wmt bring tendies
What a great timing it was for vaccine news for me to sell fresh calls on RKT.
Fisker went from the only green to the only red EV
uber eats has seen insane growth
GME is obsolete bruh...going bankrupt in the next 5 years
Sell.. their vaccine is crap.
No such thing as low IV for nio right now brah
tdoc is near the value-buy zone. 

we like growth stonks that are trading near the bottom of recent ranges.
Shorts fighting hard once again to keep GME under $12.
Hope so, so I can re-enter.
Bruh I‚Äôm retarded, I bought 15 calls at $50
It is priced for bankruptcy.  Fair value is probably closer to 30
LETS GOO NIO TO THE MOOONNN
Looking at the chart, yeah, it's sucked to be long on BCRX. With Gali (the COVID play) seems that Uncle Sam is holding up the releasing of results. The good news is that they're almost def getting FDA approval for another drug Dec 3 and undervalued just based on the revenue they'll get for it--so should get a pump enough for my ATM calls to print. Could be  a short squeeze scenario, especially with positive news for the other stuff in their pipeline, so there's additional upside.
10x SPY 361c 11/16 bought at 360.50
I feel better now after you mentioned your stocks in red. Gutted I sold this morning but I made a little profit overall. I'll let the dust settle after earnings andnwait for a good time to get back into xpev /nio. At least I won't have to worry about trading fees with trade 212and spread my bets more
Shit I didn't buy enough dips at open, now everything is too high to get in

Buy some NIO please
baba please do something.
You act as tho they will be produced.
If you have that kind of info, why aren't you :

#ThetaGang?


If you know the channels and key support/resistance levels, then imagine the power you have selling options instead of buying them.

We need to have a word sometime if you think you really have it down.

For example, I'm selling $205 puts on BABA! Do you think Baba will go to $220 or lower etc.. 

I am selling Tesla $368 puts, Do you think Tesla will go below $375 etc..



Now if I sell SPY options, with your data, well.. let's see right.
The savior everyone else's calls needed.. RIP to your gains may we enjoy your sacrafice!
The market will crash tomorrow source I just sold my puts at a lose
I mean he's not wrong. Republican senate is less likely to do it if the vaccine news is right.

i love how wsb synth says nio normal but also calls it nicaragua a few times
This is how GME is.  Long dated stuff and diamond hands = tendietrain

NIO hitting 10% one full bar in 50 min, I‚Äôm fine with it consolidate at 44.30-45 level rn, hope power hour can get this baby above 46

#LOADING THE BOAT ON PRPL CALLS

GLORIOUS DIP
not an expert, but if you are trying to get rid of it. take the extra $5 loss instead and sell under the asking instead of waiting to lose $100 because you cant get out. of course depends on your position
sorry bois, I got 10 PLTR shares this morning at 16 and it immediately dropped to 15.50
I see you.. this thing gonna run til EOY overall? Target?
JD, SPCE, and SPY (I had puts), did not perform as expected at all. I am not happy no
it's developed proprietary mass consumer data gathering methods and layered on predictive algorithms on top. it's basically prism & shit like that from Snowden days (I love snowden, what a patriot!)

peter likes to position them as being unique, but I think he's overselling it
pls no

I have swing calls
I'm a confused bear. I have puts on everything except TSLA. Which makes no sense.
guy was basically there to turn a blind eye until he could get a cushy job for one of the companies he "helped" during his SEC tenure.

His fear was being able to continue being a corporate shill when a new administration would be put in power. He couldn't keep ripping off the people with democrats running the government.  


Now to figure out what Investment bank he takes a job at. That will help point the future SEC leaders crosshairs, when they go after whoever sidestepped regulation and the law.

A colleague of mine told me to buy NIO back in May. I didn't listen
Welp, it seems I am about to lose some money, 'eh?
Should I sell my PFE stocks or hope for a rebound if the FDA approves the vaccine soon?
Here‚Äôs a tip for you stupid nio traders: low IV options print more money on smaller swings
They were showing a video of people (unemployed) waiting in cars to pick up food and I spotted a few brand new SUVs. I thought to myself no wonder the markets are doing so well people will continue to spend no matter how dire situation is.

Some dude lost 400k. Get out of here with that pussy shit
Worst thing is that it could have been the planned sell off from months ago but just speaking positively on the vaccine will give it a puMp - not technically illegal but fuck this bullshit
People with puts were shitting on NIO not even an hour ago and now they're all quiet
yeah. got in last week. still negative

So, a little backstory. I'm a 24-year-old female, 5'10, white (thank God), skinny with DD breasts and an ass that barely fits in skinny jeans. People often say that I'm the most stunningly gorgeous person they've ever met and I should consider modeling but I dunno lol. I'm childfree, an atheist, a meat lover, and strictly heterosexual.

Anyway, both my parents died in a Muslim terrorist attack when I was 12 along with all my aunts, uncles, and grandparents so I took it upon myself to raise all twenty of my siblings and cousins singlehandedly, working four full-time jobs while going to school, leading eight clubs, captaining the varsity volleyball, water polo, and basketball teams, and volunteering at a hospital all while maintaining a healthy social life. I'm currently working on my fifth Ph.D. in between running my successful non-profit to end global poverty, writing my eleventh novel, starring in the final Tarantino film, streaming Minecraft, protesting in Hong Kong, and phone banking for Bernie Sanders.

So I was at the hardware store picking out a chandelier to put in the house I'm building for the homeless when this fat, smelly, repulsive, gay, transgender "woman" walks up to me and shrieks, "you're oppressing me by being thin! Eat a fucking vegan burger you skinny slut!" I hit her with the "okay boomer," and she responded, "that's literally as offensive as calling me a n*gger!" Then she threw her slimy crotch goblin at me and screamed, "get her, Jayden! Infect her with your polio that you got because I refuse to vaccinate you!" I didn't wanna be a Karen and call the manager over to settle this so I took it upon myself to personally vaccinate her child right on the spot and saved his life. The "woman" then tried to convert me to Christianity so I kicked her in the balls and dragged her out of the store. Everyone clapped, the manager gave me $1,000 (which I donated to TeamTrees), and Obama reached out to thank me for my bravery.

So reddit. Fellow redditors. People of reddit. Denizens of reddit.com. Wise sages of the internet. Tell me the truth. Am I the asshole?

Edit: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I thought it would! Since a lot of people are asking, yes, I am a Navy SEAL and no, I have never pooped in my entire life. I was a quadriplegic after this incident but I overcame the paralysis very quickly because I'm not a little bitch. Also, because it seems to be relevant, here are the details of my sex life: I get plowed three to four times a day by my perfect lover, I'm into every kink imaginable, I have no gag reflex, and my tubes are tied so no worries there. Apparently sex with me cures all diseases and causes a bigger dopamine hit than heroin, but I dunno.
MITT  volume higher than avg, 11/20 3C ! THIS IS THE WAY BOYS.
No. Lol.
While walmart will continue to grow, they grow at a steady pace. The real options to play is a long play, 1/15 once the holiday rush has past. I can't see this stock exploding tomorrow unless Walmart doubles eps or releases some ground breaking news.
All retail is up on positive vaccine news duh
lol that's harsh

Theres so few theaters, if they do get a sizable bailout by either government, they'll be one of the few national chains to survive. With all the local theaters going bankrupt, they could potentially snag up even more market share nationally for cheap(ish/er)
Never thought I'd see that sentence here again. So glad I held my leaps. I hope it hits $40 by year end. LFG!!!

\-Pokes PLTR w a stick- **Come on, do something**
u/ssjgotenks
Need to find a way to get in on the refrigeration these vaccines will require.
Proof? You think all those major institutional investors haven't gone out to make sure there multi-million dollar investments aren't safe? NIO is legit man. üöÄ
This guy does not fuk
Yesirrrrrrrrski
Bears will have their red letter day, just you wait.
micropenis courage right here ladies and gentlemen, jews and gentiles
SE what is you doing baby, turn it around!!!
Good luck to all NIO players that are gonna get cucked by IV crush
NIO $60+ Tomorrow
I can't believe I have to tell you this but market cap = the total value of the company. ASUS could be $270 a share or $2700 or $27000 and it wouldn't matter, it doesn't meant CRSRs stock price should be the same.
Tesla calls or puts???
Does this market feel stable to you?
you belong here! good luck bruh.
It‚Äôs going up
Probably. I'm not a doctor but 95 percent effective? I'm sure something isnt quite right there
Can we like get a non-NIO daily thread?, I get that everybody's happy and what not but jeez this is borderline spamming.
Will do. Definitely won‚Äôt get as greedy on the next meme stock
Made back my 2k from SPY puts already today!
Vale gang is the best gang?
Retarded but right.
Is this r/conservative?
Disney almost as ATH wahoo
And half of the people on r/teenagers are teenagers.
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have got puts on boomer stocks
I know SPY won‚Äôt drop until I sell my puts but guess what? **IM NOT FUCKIN SELLING**
It‚Äôs not gonna print ü•¥
Don't buy GME weeklies with money you aren't ok with losing.  Shares or longer dated calls
Yeah that is true. But, Tesla was on a massive run. They would have to had incredible news to not go down. Almost everything they announced during earnings was already known leading up to it.
This is the kind of retardation I stick around this sub for lmao
Thanks Citron...glad you had a change of heart üçª
NIO rocket taking off
damn
Why does tech even go down with good vaccine news? People still going to buy iPhones and computers. Don‚Äôt know why AAPL and AMD tanked earlier in the morning.
[removed]
They ded
Trend of late
no shit dumbass that‚Äôs my point. you stupid cunts buying in on 200% IV fool
So I‚Äôve got the usual AMD, Amazon and Apple which I bought at pretty high points and am still red on all of them so don‚Äôt worry about your PLTR shares! I‚Äôm holding my NIO shares as I got in at $26 and have since averaged up to $38. Gonna hold this for a while as they‚Äôre pretty big in Formula E and have offices in Oxford UK so I‚Äôve got trust that they‚Äôll announce an EU expansion some point in the future. Also got one share of TDOC as I have a hunch that digital health is going to take off in the near future but it‚Äôs only one share so I‚Äôll take the loss if need be. Also got a couple SPCE shares which haven‚Äôt done well today but I was up before that. I‚Äôm still a bit hesitant to get onto the Airline and ‚Äúboomer‚Äù stocks until I‚Äôm sure about vaccines being rolled out but that‚Äôs a bridge I‚Äôll cross further down the line
There is no cure for being an asshole.

I now have enough in my IRA to wheel SPY.

Should I liquidate all my positions and start wheeling SPY?
Lol lmk if you find out I‚Äôm also eyeballing them
wait for GME to reach the final dip and buy on the up. Just wait.
running the wheel makes me so wet
My VXX 11/20 calls are collectively 80% down.

Thinking about selling and moving on. This shit is fucked up.
Always the smartest boy in the yard! ‚úåÔ∏è
The rug pull is coming just don‚Äôt know when comment on this if you think you have an idea
No rip for those bears they can burn in hell
NIO GANG STAND BACK AND STAND BY
Yes, just did this. Happens every time.
It does
You right. I finally lost faith
Who's going to be the first one to comment "so it could go up, or it could go down. thanks for stating the obvious. why don't you just tell me to buy calls or puts"
Other than RH what other brokerage allows instant option buying power?
Waiting to buy NIO after earnings. Safest way to go about meme stocks
CRSR!
ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs a gamble.. I‚Äôve lost enough in trying to time these things to not do it anymore

How dem NIO puts treating yall

Oh cool.

It‚Äôs a simple explanation.. I sold my calls for a loss the minute before it spiked

The MMs know that most options lose money.   They are priced to attract buyers and they know damn well that some of those options will pay out.

Nio leaps are free money
Yes I will start buying from $140, but at the current price it‚Äôs puts

So I bought it at 53 KNOWING FULL WELL I didn't have any trades left and I also lost money on solo
Why GME? Is that based just on console sales?
We hit 4000 before the fall happens

Interesting take I'll look into that.
Long term maybe but short term this is a terrible entry point
It‚Äôs hot
It's like buying stonks in the CIA.  Just do it and hope that shareholders get to vote themselves some protections in a few years or so when President Harris tries to send everyone who isn't woke enough to re-education camps.
Fine, I‚Äôm long though
Hope all of you potatoes bought the GME dip this morning!
But who are selling you these Calls? Right MM. You think the house will pull up so that all your calls get answered? Too many retailers are bullish and MM are exploiting out weakness

Well, you might be right!  We'll see.  Not suggesting you buy.  I think it might be too late for truly monster gains for small money like my brother is getting.  I am kicking myself for mostly missing the boat.  He does throw tons of penny stocks at me, and this is the only one to do anyyyyything.  

Rumor of a big announcement tomorrow.  Put it in your watch list so you can rub it in if/when it ends up tanking.

How do you tell your son he cant have the christmas gifts his friends got because you didnt buy nio?
noob question... its OTC under HTZGQ... if I buy leaps will those leaps for hTZGQ become leaps for HTZ if they rocket again and relist?
No major news, so I'm guessing it's excitement on Xbox and PS5 launch.
Im fucking dead
I understand that volume is low on some options... but I also understand the concept of a bid and an ask. Why is rh showing me bids that I can‚Äôt sell to? Bad enough it automatically drops you dead center in the spread, but now it‚Äôs showing me a bullshit order book?

Nurses aren't interchangeable. You can't just take a med/surg nurse and plop them in the ICU or ED (not used to the severity of patients) just like you can't take an ICU nurse and plop them in med/surg (not use to the volume of patients).
ofcourse. what's telling you to sell? lol

Uhm, I should hope that TSLA stays above $150 considering where it's at rn...
The takeaway from this is you shouldn't always be in a trade.  Scan the markets and get in when the timings right, when you exit park your money is a mutual fund until you find something else.  I'm making good progress with this method and can resist trading when nothing is there.

I bought into MOON. can't love you retards without investing in you :)

Also ignore the fake and gay sectoral rotation, buy the tech dips
Talk about wholesale. What about BJs???? Their earnings are coming up and they crushed their earnings ever since closure. I'm expecting the same this time

12/18 55c
12/18 45c
Imagine buying a contract with almost 300% IV?
you know there‚Äôs other participants in the market outside of just WSB and MM. Like.... the other 99% of the stock market.
I just want to sell and forget NIO ever existed

GOING TO PUT NIO ON MY NEW LAMBO PLATES!!!! LETS FUCKING GO!!!!!!
lol yea actually good point. I suppose some gamification consultant probably came up with the idea- it's also a good way to control the release and evaluate results without the entire system running on 0dte every three days with clueless retail traders lmao
yes my hands, they hurt so much
This looks so fucking manipulated it's ridiculous. Like it could really stay pinned to 260 for the entire day.
21 22 14c papi üíã

Guys are missing GME while you nut over NIO
I've attempted to time the top on both BA and GME. Wish me luck.
Volume is pathetic though no one‚Äôs touching it üòï
Only like $100, I just bought cheap lotto puts
GME SQUEEZE GET FUCKED SHORTS
NIO going up like jimmy neutron makeshift rocket while the kids of America playing in the background.
I smell a lot of desperation in here. If only someone could bottle that up into a nice ETF. Guaranteed money.
Im down 50% in ten minutes üòé
NIO EOD prediction?
Dow 30k is the boomer edition of MSFT 200c
It sounds like they beat but google and others put up wrong numbers that showed a miss.
Damn it j already sold I‚Äôm sure your right but it was Friday and it went way the fuck down and j wasn‚Äôt comfortable I‚Äôm a newbie so I‚Äôm gonna read some books and paper trade for now . I‚Äôm what you call a pusssyyyyyyyy Hahahah

Agreed! I think the peak will either be around noon or 3 pm.

It's in the hands of Space Karen's health to be honest.

If he has a minor case and keeps low on the Twitter for two weeks, we gucci.

If he goes silent on Twitter and in one week we get a leaked photo that he's in ICU, then we fucked.

As long as it‚Äôs not FD‚Äôs you‚Äôre good bro
wanna see me do it again
NIO 50 end of day
r/smallstreetbets
NIO is just too stressful to hold. Fair play to whoever is holding it past earnings
$VALUG which is a huge unweighted index is up 15% in two fucking weeks! This market is truly insane. I want to keep calling for a major correction but that seems too easy. Still there has to be some mean reversion coming soon.
I find the lack of volatility in tesla disturbing
Hey Ron Paul, is GME happening?

Walmart is steady gains. Low blood pressure trading.
what does it mean when your RH screen turns green?
Eh I don‚Äôt wanna speak for it short term
If I trusted NIO I'd love to sell CC on this bitch, the premiums are insane!
GME $20 today could be the day.
Greeen muthafuckas
Li the new NIO
I love crazies. My favorite part is when they slash my tires afterwards
Good thing you didn‚Äôt miss the early run
No I mis-timed my last call and lost so now I don't trust it.
I bought $6 puts so...
Shares are better for those kind of meme stocks

$20 Leaps for 2021. November Expiry, forget which date. Going to set and forget. Going to step away from day trading and just hold this one.
Maybe, but before that, we're hitting 50s.  
So you can suck my giant bull dick in the meantime.
What if I told you you can buy calls when it‚Äôs deep in the red, and sell it when it goes green
Cuz its oversold.

BABA to ATH? Unlikely.

BABA to more than it is now? Yep
Everyone shitting on NIO post your put losses
I sold 1/4 of my December 30$c to secure initial investment and letting the other 3/4 ride out for max profit + I have 5/21 20$c & 30$c to merinate for the stimmy check + lockdown phase 2.

First big win man I'm so proud of myself

Edit: Hey man, you didn't hear it from me but crsr could hit 50. Not even kidding just think of stimmy + lockdown . Ride the hype and buy calls / boomer shares for the long like literally May calls or December and you'll win too! Good luck retards ! :)
Holding long on PLTR
I'm aging well.

Looks like the rocket had failed to launch today.

Instructions unclear, bought F 13c 11/27
Chill bro. The market hasn't even been open for an hour yet..
Paypal and Square have been fucking useless the kast two weeks
Wtf happened to JD?
Just bought the dip, hold you'll be fine!!
Calls or shares?
Doing its kiss of death at 45 gonna dump EOD
$KSS earnings tomorrow. Decent earnings mixed with vaccine news could be good.
I bought lots of shares, too afraid to buy calls
Airlines too high imo
Show us your puts pussy
it is a big deal for the under 50 that don't get it

they will become carriers that don't isolate when infected

they are the same reason the flu still carries on to disrupt workplaces and kills people
Guess you're never making money on that put
15.5 call finna smack
I‚Äôm very confident you‚Äôll be fine and very much in the green in the near future.

Solo is back guys, feel sorry for who didn‚Äôt bought the dip
Like the red plastic cups?

Idk why ppl listens to him
Thx. Dead inside.
BABA is a buy here.. how can you not.. just buy April calls no way those don‚Äôt make money

That's a lot!

I ain't tryna fuck with the CCP THAT hard on a short dated spread lol.

Closing out if we hit 255
Yes I have puts but I would seriously consider taking NIO profits here, especially if you have short calls

planter's peanuts the new nio, PLTR $30 EOW
I‚Äôm holding shares like you, obviously it would be great to sell at peak, and then buy back in if it dips 10% again but the questions is how high will she go before that pullback we‚Äôre expecting
but they are u hater fuck
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not like he exactly needs to.
I'd def wait a day in case they try to some rambo one more day optimisim pump
Sold all my shares and bought PLTR. Shit been stale lately (TSLA)
The thing about vaccine news is they never release during market always after market or before there needs to be a virus release during market hours for a short squeeze
Jim Cramer probably: I know my last 15 stocks were big losers, but did you buy Apple ten years ago like I told you?

At open? It‚Äôs been open....

Andrew "Left" isn't Andrew "Right" therefore Andrew "Wrong," it's simple geometry
INO got past FDA hold and announced department of defense funding. 34% short shares. Short squeeze this week week be epic.
Time to take profits and crawl back into bed

Whoever held NIO throughout, boy you deserve some tendies just for that stress.
Is Tesla dead? Asking for a friend that expires on the 21st

Lol keep thinking that
Ahhhhh I see I see thanks I gotta learn more about it. I‚Äôm playing with out 5 grand, so yea thanks I‚Äôm learning
Godspeed retard
RKT always does this +3% pump into a +0.5% day bullshit
Damn today‚Äôs been painful
$AAPL 121 EOD or I'll be sad
bought in at 33.28$ today
Thank you and fuck you
why the fuck is vol picking up
Are you kidding me? NIO is going to crush earnings more so than last quarter. October numbers are literally to the moon. Don't tell me this report is from a guy bear mate.
i agree with you, just fuckin with the nio bears
Yeah ur right but it‚Äôs not as obvious as last week cause they didn‚Äôt popped as much. You have any thing you look it now in particular?
NIO has 50 in its sights!!

They finally let a NIO post through and this is what we getü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Shit, NIO puts not doing as well for me
I thought this was a Wendy‚Äôs
Was looking at leaps, true the near exp. aren't too bad
I sold a covered 40p today at open and am up like 20%, I might close it and see what happens tomorrow
Why the fuck did Tesla drill smfh took a L on that one
Wow VIAC up almost 6%

There's still Mango's upcoming sanctions
Not at $70
Reminder: you don't have to trade every market day.  Some days just may not be worth it.  Don't hesitate to call it a day.
i do agree. love walmart
I‚Äôm theta gang and feasting on this juicy IV for earnings. 260% lmao
I am talking about individual stocks, not the full index.

Look at the airlines, cruise lines, etc.

WTF

these companies are incredibly fuk for at least another year
Pltr puts
I honestly believe it‚Äôs totally possible some Chinese oligarchs are doing a pump and dump on NIO as we speak lol
He‚Äôs saying you can‚Äôt rely on the options positions on 13Fs since they are stated as underlying price * contracts * 100. This is also true since short positions aren‚Äôt reported either. 

Basically, don‚Äôt go yolo TSLA calls when you see a $300 million call position since this is fake news that could‚Äôve expired 10/2 and been worthless at that point. Since positions are also 47 days stale this quarter.
No
PLTR gang, how are we feeling?
100
Amazing how we ended the pandemic twice in the last two weeks
Nooo niooo
u/sr20rps13 u/BayesianProtoss we just bought a freezer per my boss.

Can‚Äôt believe I ever doubted hive mind retard strength. NIO 70 EOW
BABA how long do I need to endure this pain
Baba is dipping because something is fundamentally changed.  China isn't just going to back up on their new regulation.  Why do people keep expecting baba to go up?
Anybody holding PTON
Why people still think NVDA getting ARM? Xi said nahh already.
see you at 3pm
I'm sitting on 2500 shares of PLTR and refuse to sell calls. 

Most likely going to be selling puts for a while.
How are the stimulus talks going?

4/4 with NIO 125%+
Wsb shat on nio all weekend. Always reverse wsb
TNSP.  Bro told me to buy it two weeks ago at .0006.  Didn't.  Now at .017.  He's up like 2500% on 2 million shares.  Lord.  The regret.

Well this morning was a ride watching NIO. 

Good luck to all bulls looking towards ER.

Now the real question is, how greedy do we $Nio bulls get?  
Sell at 50? 55?  


Or hold like fucking ~~idiots~~ heroes, and hope it reaches 60/70?
Just bought today. Holding for the long run
NIO swings 10% in 30 mins. ü§™
Just taking out stop losses for breakfast

What do you have?
NIU quietly becoming the stable EV play...
People eating up leaps after all the hype this weekend
PLTR going to 14 you heard it here folks
papa elon you fuck
XPEV and LI on some other kind of shit man. REALLY hoping that if NIO blows up earnings, then we get just a fucking nuke to the moon
I know, I see your account is a couple years old. Only posts are about stwd just seems a little sketchy sometimes but I still bought in!  Thanks!
Still decent price atm for long term
Puts on airlines and cruises look at last week
Imagine not buying NIO on Friday
bought tesla calls and also bought some BA puts (my fav)
FSLY ded, NET almost back to even

makes sense
You‚Äôre a üåàüêªwho bought one too many puts and never learned his lesson

I‚Äôm going to buy nio puts to boost your calls
Your a fuckin idiot if you think this was even close to at all predictable
No but she can work on the ER and has specialized training to care for Covid patients
AMC is lobbying hard for a special bailout from the US and Chinese governments. They won't go bankrupt, they just have to survive for until the end of February and then that check  will roll in and the stock will skyrocket like a motherfucker, might see prices as high as 15 by the end of the summer.
Thanks GYNA EVs
So how long until tesla is interesting again
Just bought these things called "shares" @ $15.69. and now I wait for months lol
Wrong way PLTR you stupid bitch cmon

This aged well, not!  - Borat
POMP GME
$NIO closing tomorrow at $60
wish dow would stop teasing and hit 30k alrdy
Closer to expiry benefits the seller, further away from expiry benefits the option buyer. You can still play a weekly position, but purchase options that are 30-60 days out and roll your positions whenever they are green.

This is my strat on QQQ that makes an extra $100 every week.
we're getting paid
Illuminati intensifies
PLTR: down 1.6%

My long calls: up 5%

Idk but alright
üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Oh, yeahhhh
Go to 1hr candlestick. Look for the lower wicks on the red bars. 38.6 ish. Now if you want to be a pussy set it for 37. However, this shit is going to the moon. Will be 60 by end of week. Don't stop loss a stock with this kind of momentum and price swings. You will only miss out on serious action. Get back in now before you really hate yourself.
GME GANG STILL ALIVE!!!

If the price were to moon, who are selling you these Calls? Right: MM. The house will always win and there is hardly any bears here. Do you think MM will sell yall calls for them to lose money?

Bought solo shares, going to buy more NIO lottery puts
Half the NIO holders in this sub:

Publicly, they are putting on a brave face and telling others that it will moon.

Privately, they are on a verge of nervous breakdown

NIO with that organic growth
Yeah maybe when it gets a 10-1 split next week.
Desperate parents who's children run the household.

Nothing like watching a position you've been holding for 4 months go green for the first time
Managed to sell my one weekly put at the very bottom this morning so I'm good, off to the moon for you call holders.
So sell them
Open up the floodgates

SOLO way oversold, going to rise up with rest of EV Sector
Of course not we‚Äôve been selling any gains we‚Äôve had this entire year
us maybe. But open your eyes. theres developed markets in asia like Korea & japan, northern Europe& UK etc. those are decently valued and have some quality companies as well.
I sold 106 puts at 25 strike dec18. So similar invested as you after reading all the great dd. These are one of these rare calls I feel 99% confident in and don't mind yoloing on.  Let's üöÄ to infinity.
And hertz was delisted.
LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!
break 45 come on
Sound like u was being a pussy
Who bought nio puts. Be honest üåö
Same
Too many dipshits sell the moment it hits 45 so they can say they got out early
NIO touching 60 off earnings beat last chance to buy calls
ZM only down by this much is huge for the rest of the week! If it stays above 390 today despite this "very damaging news" I think it hits 450 before Friday
Loaded up on more puts. Im either wrong or right in a VERY big way
GRWG still continuing its moon mission from last week. When's it gonna stop?
It's only been happening a week.

Option contracts tend to be written in lots of 100 shares but prices are usually quoted on a per share basis. In other words, if you see someone quote a contract price, you‚Äôll have to multiply by 100 to get the true value of how much money you need to get in.
NIO $45.50 guaranteed

Bloomberg on the 1.65M shares block trade:

The block traded at $100.28 per share, virtually unchanged from the open on NASDAQ CM. It represented 19% of the 20-day average volume at that time. 

TLDR: those who bought MRNA at open are now bagholders.
Ahhh what to do. Aal calls are cheap. Everything else expensive.
Read the posting guidelines.

I don‚Äôt think 10 million vaccines are gonna make much of a difference. I don‚Äôt think until we get to around 50% of people vaccinated are we gonna se much difference in life. I guess I wouldn‚Äôt trade off 10 million people vaccinated because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to mean anything in the grand scheme.

Turned spy call profits into some free zoom earnings calls. The Moderna drop has already recovered way faster than the Pfizer drop. Buy the dips.
Woah it‚Äôs like an Easter egg
not sure but someone said they have it on their phone now so maybe they rolled out mobile as well
$NIO is the one, bitch it is The One. Like Keanu Reaves, get it done
Damn, stop loss triggered on that NIO dip, unfortunately sold for a loss. Could be worse I guess

Then now is probably a good time to buy
theres just no way NIO will stay down for long. People who missed out on TSLA a few years ago (or even earlier this year) are desperate to hit big on an EV company and NIO has the most hype
What the actual fuck is BABA doing? Worst buy ever.

CNBC pumping nurses as all getting overwhelmed by work, meanwhile my gf has been getting forced off from work at least 1/3 of her shifts a week because she works a post surgery floor and no ones having elective surgery in Covid. But the state is still choosing to pay out of state nurses over $100 an hour to come to our state to supplement the nursing staff...here‚Äôs an idea, use the nurses that you already have that are on low census floors.

TLDR: The only floors affected by Covid are the ERs and ICUs. Most other floors are low census.
I'm with it. It's a solid company.
it bounced off 900 a few times already so I'm hoping for a quick swing trade
Bloody NIO calls are so expensive
Get fucked nio bears lol

Time to get on the BA hype train, I think the rebound to ~$350 is starting.

Assuming 10 million vaccines get rolled out for healthcare workers and high risk individuals at the end of the year, what do I buy now for maximum potential to lose all my money
Listening to a brand new account that every post is the same pump? Seems legit. I'm in
DKNG is in growth / customer acquisition mode - I think everyone knows there will be plenty of ups and downs to trade in an out of.  I would much rather gamble on my phone than in a smelly Vegas sports book.
you'd be retarded to do that right now with the run NIO is about to go on

All hype
I don‚Äôt get it either. Seems like DKNG reacts negatively to both vaccine news and increasing numbers news
Stop shilling pltr. It‚Äôs garbage
I'm more excited about mRNA vaccine tech/development at this point. It is a really cool thing to say, assuming this works, that any new virus that does come along in the future we have an established method for rapidly developing and deploying a vaccine.
Honestly I think it‚Äôll go down to the trend of those previous lows. I think one could confidently buy into a significant position at that point
AZN falling behind in the race for a vaccine, that's because they're a British company and British companies are terrible.
Calls are free $$$
I'm taking your mom out for a steak dinner thursday. I'm not planning to call her again after!
You may be right but that‚Äôs the perfect dip to buy if it does.
Right? I just said fuck it, pulled out of my calls, changed to a strangle. It's gonna go one fucking way tomorrow, no idea which one but that no longer matters.
You realize earnings are tomorrow?
No margin. 

The total of my options should barely push me into the green yet I‚Äôm down by over 100 dollars.

Everyone was worried about NIO but it's BABA that's killing me so far
Picked up 2 17c
Only got a small position. Can average down if it goes down more
just look at this thread. plenty of examples (getting downvoted) of people who don't want to take it.

for the 50% that do?... vaccines won't be widely available to the public until april. we don't know how many doses, etc.

my only point was that the flu vaccine ***is*** established, safe, readily available and very cheap, yet people don't take it.

10% of Americans is 37 million vaccinated or 74 million doses (2 doses/person) or 100 million doses to account for manufacturing/distribution/storage margin of failure.

even that's ambitious as hell.

Man they could never have that plot device today. Especially the end when they all start spitting and throwing up. It really was wrong, but it was funny at the time! You're gun is digging into my hip!
I am. They were really only a hedge against Moderna stock I have. Only 55 shares though.

What is this, a dip for ants?
Why not just buy stocks at that point

I just bought some nutmeg there.

RIP SEC Chief Clayton. First job out of college and only had it for 4 years. Trying to put out fires left and right. Look at what the stress did to this young man.
Oh I am def selling tomorrow afternoon
Hopefully means we‚Äôll get another dip to buy soon.
I'll make an offer by end of day. I'll either be buying a nice chicken sandwich or crying in ramen.
in nio terms, this is the crash :)))))
You‚Äôre right!
BABA needs no help, unfortunately.
Oh no, I kept my money
Got me a PLTR 01/21/22 30c
Great. Holding long-term.
What kind of fucking question is this
Hahaha I have puts on BA and calls on TDoC... may the best retard win
PLTR still the move? I have $500 left to spend
I don't even check Robinhood anymore, I just come to the daily discussion thread for reactions. I just log in to sell and buy accordingly.
Nio can‚Äôt pick a dirextion
ZM and PTON blue balling a downfall
50/50 on PLTR and UMC. UMC has been killer, don't sleep on it.
I predict Nio will slowly (ebb and flow) upward until earnings--then we're in no man's land--either huge up or huge down. I'm gonna sell most before earnings, and then see how my one or two calls perform afterwards. Peace.
Is robinhood charging fees now? My unrealized losses don‚Äôt match the amount the app is telling me.

I haven‚Äôt used the app in months.
calls on **BA** and puts on **TDOC**
I know they're the bellweather I'm mostly trying to short LB while the price is good. But seems like insiders are shifting into retail.
Sold a covered call on LMND Friday, today up 5%, decided not to sell covered calls on DKNG Friday to replace the expiring ones, today down 5%, why does the market always fuck with my trades specifically?
You have 36 hours to decide if you want to play up or down for earnings.
markets basically a reflection of how much money the fed is printing at this point

nothing more
tends to top on good news & optimism. tends to bottom on bad news & pessimism. but this cant be this easy, there has to be some dog buried here.
Nio please.  
Stop playing with my emotions like this.
This is more of a discussion post bro. DD typically about a stock, sector, or overall market
Come on GME do something retarded
Almost sold my BKNG 11/27 $2060 puts at open. Thank god I didn‚Äôt, they have almost doubled in the last 10 minutes. Keep falling!!!

Afraid of NIO but still want to get into China's consumer market? Try CHIQ, 89.95% up this year. Less volatile than weeklies on NIO.
Is the rug pull here?
yeah sounds about right
Fine, 2 Celsius. This vaccine is Murican from an American company and not for rosbifs and frogs anyways
A 1-2% drop would be great so I can buy more.
Lie
CRSR is like a dad that always bails me out when I fuck up
Im hella stupid
That's good with PLTR. I read it on here and then waited 2-3 days. Stupidly I bought a lot of shares at @16.7....i know.... Don't ask.... I'm hoping in 1 year that I'll look back and say this is a good investment. Anything else you're in? Just sold my nio & xpev stocks and only in pltr now. I only do shares
Please dont do this to yourself
That be the talk of a yella belly landlubber, get yer ass back to land if ye can't handle the seas laddie, rough waters reveal the boys among the men.
I hope ur right
Good to know, thank you! Definitely not flying on a 787 in the future.
Buy the red sell the green
Spy having an identical first hour compared to last week vaccine news. Now if I know this.. I should play it like last Monday. But if It knows that I know.. I have to inverse? Right?
Should have sold on the spike.  I got myself some 6.50 puts
Market headed red.
It‚Äôs amazing how many retards actually congregate in this sub
Heres your problem. Whether or not their vaccine is a hoax won't stop it from being profitable. If you can figure that one out, then you'll know what option to play
What kind of movement are you expecting after retail earnings this week? Normally I'd short but nothing makes sense anymore.
I am so hungover
Jd pulling down baba
Now pump til EOD close at 363

I could sell and be down a minimal amount but for some reason I just keep holding
Congrats brother!!
It is under 16
If we can get the ticker to bounce off new support level at 42 for NIO 32 for LI, it will go up

I just bought some at $81 so this pretty much means it will be falling below that for next couple months. Good luck.

Here's the real DD. From an old AskReddit post:

> I worked at Boeing for about 1.5 years in the 2008-9 time period and I can absolutely guarantee this happened.

> First, Boeing's corporate culture is the worst shitshow I have ever experienced. All large corporations have a lot of internal issues and problems but nothing like the Lazy B. It was like working in a company designed by Kafka. I signed up at Boeing as a programmer. When I showed up at my first day of work, the first words out of my supervisor's mouth were, "I don't know why you are here, we have no need for programmers." (The Boeing interview process is done so that at no point, do you ever have contact or communication with the team you will be working with.)

> So, basically, I was cutting and pasting cells in Excel spreadsheets and doing ad hoc project management during my time there. They did have need for a programmer, but I didn't have access to install any programming software on my machine because no one knew who the local IT person was. No one. It was a year before I was able to figure that out and only because I was bored one day and was walking around the building and found the guy's cubicle by accident.

> To be fair, the aging aircraft division that I was in was notoriously bad, even for Boeing. It was where they put people that the union wouldn't let Boeing fire. I would conservatively estimate 30% of my co-workers were full-blown sociopaths who would actively work to sabotage and ruin other people's work. Another 50% of the people there blatantly goofed off all day, reading the newspaper or books with their feet up on their desks (literally). The remaining 20% were people who actually cared about airplane passengers not dying and worked themselves half to death to keep things afloat. I'll give a quick shout out to Anastasia, James and all the contract workers who actually did their jobs. There are probably a few thousand people around the world who aren't dead because of you.

> Anyhow, James (or was it Jim? It's been a while.) was a grouchy old engineer they stuck me next to. He was close to retirement and clearly wasn't too stoked about losing half his cubicle to an unwanted programmer that showed up one day. James had a bunch of photos of an old 747 and structural diagrams pinned to his cubicle wall. One day, I asked what those were.

> They were pictures and failure analysis diagrams of¬†JAL 123, the single worst single airplane disaster in history. 520 people died. It was because a couple of Boeing engineers fucked up. That 747SR had had a tailstrike incident on takeoff that damaged the rear pressure dome. A team of Boeing AOG (Airplane On the Ground) mechanics were flown out there to fix it. To oversimplify, they rushed and accidentally did the equivalent of 1+1=1 on one of their stress calculations. It was an error very similar to the infamous¬†Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. 12,318 flights later, (well before what should have been at least 25-30,000 flight cycles that the crack inspection cycle would have assumed) the rear bullkhead ripped out mid flight and severed all hydraulic control lines. The plane lost all control and flew in a rollercoaster trajectory for 32 minutes before running into the side of a mountain. Many of the passengers had time to write goodbye letters to their loved ones. James had those photos and diagrams on his cubicle so that every day, he could look at them and remind himself of why his job was important and why he couldn't cut corners.

> James was clearly an incredibly knowledgeable and talented engineer. He was the widely acknowledged expert in the entire department. If any other engineer had a question, they would always come to him for advice. So why was such a good engineer relegated to a department full of fuckups and malcontents? Because he wouldn't cut corners on safety.

> This was the final stages of the 787 rollout, which was behind schedule and full of issues. James had constantly raised red flags about safety corners Boeing was cutting on the 787 rollout. Things like putting the plane out before there was a good understanding of crack propagation speed, nondestructive testing protocols and repair protocols for all the carbon fiber on the plane. These were extremely serious issues that Boeing swept under the rug to get the 787 out faster. Because he wouldn't toe the line on this, James got exiled to the shitty little backwater I ran into him at, where he was counting the days until he could retire and spend his time SCUBA diving out at Edmonds.

> To this day, I refuse to fly on a 787. I'm sure that the Dreamliners that came off the assembly line after about a year or so were fine but there's that first year of production that, as far as I'm concerned, are ticking time bombs. I talked to many engineers who had worked on that program to know just how badly they rushed that initial production.

> So, as far as I'm concerned, fuck Boeing. This was inevitable. I'm honestly shocked it took this long for something like this to happen.

Dumped my shares to some chump at 44.50 lmao
Did you learn nothing before you came here? Not trying to be rude but there are plenty of ways of obtaining this knowledge without showing how new you are  around here, lol.

BA = stock ticker for Boeing. Calls are when you think the stock is going up. If you want to gamble with options and you think the stock is going to go up you are long calls. Long = buy. Short = sell. So you want to buy the call. Let's say the stock BA price is $195 and you think the price is going to go up to $200, you buy a call at the **STRIKE PRICE** of $200 (remember the actual stock's price is still 195). So you buy the contract that says what your desired strike price is. As the stock's price goes up towards the strike price, the price (premium) of your options trade goes up. You can then sell the contract to close the position and make money off the trade. 

The same thing is true for puts. A put is when you think the stock is going down. If you think the stock will decrease then you are long on puts. Meaning you BUY a put. (We will not get into shorting/selling contracts here because they are extremely dangerous to gamble with). Let's say the price of the stock BA (Boeing) is at $195 and your strike price is $190, as the stock price decreases towards that strike price, your contract will go up in price and you can then sell the options trade for a profit.

That's the basics and there's plenty of free resources out there to learn more. Hopefully this is enough to get you started because that's all I've got in me for today.
Truly retarded if you think SPY closing above 360. Buy puts
Nah - money‚Äôs money friend.
Hush, I am glad they did!

Ay, These vaccine days be a cruel mistress. I wake and check premarket on me cellular phone to see me UAL plays up bigly and think to meself, yahar, the booty is mine! Only to see her slowly fall back ta tha sea. 'Tis a sad sight to be shure. Yar.
PLTR is a 3 bagger get in
Trade you some of my BNTX right now?
Didnt they dilute their stocks immediately after Pfizer made their move? Sounds like Chapter 11 like move.

What's the gestalt on gme
No no he's got a point
When NIO dumps nobody better complain y'all had MONTHS to make money.
ALWAYS NICE BEING RETARDED WITH YOU FUCKS... I HATE STOCKS
MTG
Whoever said BA was going back to 160, yo moms a hoe
Sold my icln calls so I could buy pltr calls. Why do I let this sub influence my decisions? Oh well. If I lose money at least I know I'm losing it with you retards.
JD is getting destroyed wtf
Hope yall bought the fucking big tech dip and got your MRNA puts.
Ye I'm holding
PLUG to the moon, 30 EOW
Bought PLTR calls on Friday, just added 500 shares on that morning dip.

You bitches better be right. (Just kidding, I like the company hence the shares purchase)
People have fear of the number 30,000 ig

Would like to thank Jesus for making me not dump my BABA at open
BA is gonna run hard
PTON DEAD
You don't see why the comment to subscriber ratio being high probably has nothing to do with meme submissions?

Think about it for a bit.
How low does MRNA go?
Anyone else have BA puts? :/ what do we do fam
Is it finally safe to get into baba? Are the ANT theatrics over with?
This aged well
gme news? this is uncharacteristic af where is my slow bleed
I'm looking to buy some nice pillows.  Do you guys have any suggestions?
[removed]
LOL.

SOLO is crashing. Hope you retards got out after numerous warnings last week
Sold my NIO puts made a quick 50% woooh
Southwest sonn
This retard saw NIO go from $1 to $54 to $44 and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised how fast this little bitch burned to the ground‚Äù. Peak autism is not only having no social awareness, but no sense of relativity either
DKNG you cunt ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
end of day it‚Äôll be like 45 again
The CIA can probe my ass all they want as long as they keep pumping PLTR
JD sucked dick?
We are going to have a lame, flat day...aren't we?
SOLO, you good?
RKT lol
BABA is rising. Hope u filled up and didn't listen to trash bears with no balls to reply
AAPL $120 :))
For some reason my dumbass won‚Äôt let go of EURN TANKERGANG REPRESENT
So is AAPL not dying today after all?
No WSB rejected it as a whole. Will not get pumped.
I'm looking to buy some nice pillows.  Do you guys have any suggestions?
Nio go up plz
Exactly
Zm puts lost me $300 this morning only $200 left to play, any suggestions?
Don‚Äôt lie, that‚Äôs fucking cum
Ofc AZN was the only vaccine company I bought calls for. Hurry your shit up motherfuckers!
This guy made me lose 10k
Not buying that this is the pump to get there though

SPR should be following if MAX news is good, and it is kinda, but it's not attached to BA like it was
Yea definitely recommend T212 otherwise. Open is and always has been sketchy. You obviously can‚Äôt trade outside market hours but that‚Äôs just something I‚Äôll take for no fees. Also they have alerts on the app for new IPOs which is always useful, for example, I got PLTR at IPO for $10 I‚Äôve since averaged up but still at $12 average.
FSR, KCAC, or PLTR... go
essentially nothing is undervalued right now, so puts on pretty much anything
Out of NIO. Feels like the music is stopping on that bitch
I need a hell of a lot more out of her to get myself
Out of this hole
Be patient
Only a sucker would buy NIO options with this IV unless they were day trading
Why tf am I still in APHA
Why are the long dates qqq calls changed so little percentage wise as compared to spy calls? The IV seems about the same
This is a temporary NIO dip. Buy now if you woke up late
Longed at open, might buy more
ZM rebound was much quicker than I had imagined. Wanted to sell my puts and buy them back after the bounce, but didn't get a chance.
BA Boys back from the abyss killing bears!
PLTR!

&#x200B;

see you guys at 20.
This morning at open
Mom?
Chinese Military is here :)
Nio puts printing
Butterfly on tesla
is buying a lot of AAL to hold a dumb move

it seems depressed bc of covid

might be a good long term hold idk shit tho
$BABA broke 262. Losers at stocktwits goin crazy lol
how to play qqq? i got calls in the money rn and they expire friday. i wanna hold for one more day if it doesn't do a moonshot today.
FCEL calls my best play today
BABA stay above $260 by Friday you fuck. I am cool if I get assigned at $260 but I would rather just collect the free premium.

But you gotta stay above $260...
Banks pump 3% tech sells off 1%

PLTR AND FSR LOOKING GOOOOOOD
who the fuck sells PLTR @15 lmao
i remember them posting their positions at least, but oh well
Are we buying fsr
TQQQ to the moon idgaf
Don't worry, I will.
Yeah plus the amount of money up for grabs means there‚Äôs a huge incentive to get something out as soon as possible even if there is fraud involved.
[deleted]
god my pton calls printing... the market is retarded
Anyone know how walmart plus is going to be represented in the earnings report?
Have you ever seen something orchestrated to fuck a bunch of people over and wisely decided to go against the herd? It's such a good feeling to be a contrarian when you nail the right outcome.
[deleted]
And it all depends on how long they can ensure protection as well
PLTR MOFOS
BA scalp for a small gain. Should‚Äôve held longer ‚úàÔ∏è
SPOILER ALERT üö® PLTR closes above $17
Bought ATVI at $76.10 and an amazon call at 3082 thank you free money
Bitch ass nio, go up
thankful i got montlies, friday and this open wouldve made me sell if i had weeklies
Side effects may include penis lengthening and building muscle.

Got 2k on that play lol
Is your dick super thin now?
Spy crash when
They bought a bunch of NIO too.
This is the next level shit I come to this sub for!
And to think I almost bought SOLO calls. Algos were monitoring you guys this last weekend. Unless you were planning on shorting anyways and I just didn‚Äôt get the memo.
It predicts the future
‚õ∑
PLTR Cs. USA USA USA.
It‚Äôd happen no matter who wasn‚Äôt president
Scalped some easy money on NIO calls. Now gonna sit on puts. Good luck all
Someone with NIO puts

The downvoters are out in force right now
so logically this vaccine high is going to be gone  in a few hours and we come back to reality with airlines / cruise lines right?
[removed]
Nio plss
keep telling yourself that
Last week was nutty, stay safe out there bud
The strength of retards in the stock market never ceases to amaze me. NIO 55 EOD üöÄ
Mum was loving dressing me in cute dresses in stuff, well here I am :(
AAL calls??
will definitely get there sometime next year
just deleted EV‚Äôs from my watchlist.  Feeling better already
NIO BAHAHAHAHA
I was told tech was dead
Tesla disappointing me
Cramer says next pump & dump vaccine is AstraZeneca. When is the market gonna realize that the vaccines are gonna do shit for the cruises, airlines, or hotels until end of 2021 or 2022 lol.
See you tomorrow
I‚Äôm gonna go back to sleep. when I wake up will Nio still be green?
Thoughts on KSS for earnings?
Alright which one of you fucks is going on a downvote rampage because you‚Äôre angry that you just lost your mortgage payment for the next 7 months

Agreed, git NIO too.  Just don‚Äôt have SOLO cause no one wants clown cars
man i've been having some bad luck selling CC's
I love just scrolling through this thread and seeing all these degenerate retards hyping up their random meme stock they bet their whole life savings on. WSB is truly a special place
[deleted]
tech just popped a boner
Good bot.
A huge portion of their revenue comes from streaming equipment.  So yes, new consoles and titles will be good for the stock.  Also, know that a lot of major titles released on consoles are on PC as well.  Companies like Sony and MSFT lose money producint hardware and make their money on software aka games.
Who‚Äôs the retard that got fucked by SPCE. COVID delaying launch
No, Removing the bullshit nio posts, literally dozens of them either bullish or bearish.  Like this one.

Seriously, use one of the other 137 threads already under discussion.

Eidt to say I'm actually bag-holding NIO, so it's nothing specifically gaybear.
Data analysis software
FSR let‚Äôs meme
Probably should have saved that Billionaire his $20k. /s
BIP options are disgustingly cheap. Idk if this is under the radar or what but December 55c feels like it's gonna be a 10+ bagger
Supposed
What‚Äôs funny is we‚Äôre actually in line with futures before the MRNA news
I lost everything on spy this is crazy. See y‚Äôall next year ‚úåÔ∏è
PUTS ON BA
where were they when üåàüêª were calling bulls out?
[deleted]
BA going over 200 today
Gotta love my one day chart mimicking nio to a T
[deleted]
Repeat of Friday boys. Pump 15 mins and dump nio
i already had some shares at 9.49. i bought today at 15.25 so my CB is 14.79
Just was curious cause of that expiration date
"Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated."

-NIO
what a rebound of tech
Looking at Boeing - orders for the 737 max must be thru the fucking roof!
Big rip
It‚Äôs not sexy but I‚Äôm still betting on a SEDG rebound

Anyone else ever make an accidental yolo?
modern a vaccine 94.5% effective.
Yo mama good
These weed stocks be having the same pattern, they pump at open and then dump 15 mins later
Nope, have a look at 10th November, same price action leading into lunch then another massive dump.
I‚Äôm addicted and I can‚Äôt stop
Vix is positive!?!
I‚Äôd probably start taking profits on the morning bounce, maybe even test some puts on the weaker movers this morning like TSLA
Somebody wake up the chinese and tell them to buy
So that means Nio going green if li is getting upgrades and not going to 25 like that ass clown sais
When‚Äôs it worth buying into PLTR?
GME was trying to jump again at the open and the shorts squashed it hard right away. They scared. GME gonna fly any day now.
Is that most days? Think the app saved you tbh! I sold eh n it was down - 5% at open. Selling at open rarely works for me. Would you recommend trading 212? The fees are killing me at aj
boomers man

My Dad went in bigly on BA at 142 and doesn't want to sell because of fucking short term cap gains tax
This is the way
This is the way
Good shit brotha
Even my RKT calls green?!? Great day.
they aren't really adding anything, they are posts just calling people out
Catches bad guys like bin Ladin
No it's not. It's done that several times the past few weeks.
zoom out
were we suppose to buy the nio dip?
This..... Is wild.
Die already SPY!
What‚Äôs the level after retard strength? Bc spy got it rn that thing literally will not drop .10 cents
Typical day
My 12/7 $340P‚Äôs would have a great day
Imagine buying Intel above 40
Why would DKNG be going down?  Is market retarded?
I sold 120 $SPY calls for profit still holding a little under 600
You win this round
BABA LIFTOFF!

U doubted! U doubted!
Did you doubt ZOOMs vibe?
PDD has a nice dip this morning, but it‚Äôs had a great run up so who knows. I‚Äôm long on TSM, have shares around $50 and 2022 $100 LEAPs in the Roth...
three things that hurt me are NIO when watching it trade between 10-15, APPS when it was at like 8 and i watched it go all the way to 40 and PENN at 3.75
Bought a PLTR leap for $6.9, nice
Kids yoloing their college money in Nio and getting fucked. Meanwhile the rest of us less retard ppl getting gains from nearly every other stock. Well played wsb!
I feel u man that rotation out was ridiculous
NIO TO 50 üëâü•∫üëà
I haven‚Äôt downvoted anyone. Just how I think it‚Äôs gonna go.
Why are you gae?
just when the wsb retards stopped believing. the timing is perfect
Beat earnings and of course we get shit on..
SPCE had to cancel their flight because the air space was crowded. NIO is going to the moon this week so they couldn‚Äôt fly.
Once NIO goes green it‚Äôs game over for you bitches.
 I bought $30k worth of Nio at $3 per share early this year... just wish tomorrow I can be a little closer to become a millionaireüòÇ
Lol. NIO +8% in 15 min?
ZM just roasted a bunch of new shorts
**CCL TAKING OFF**

Maybe. Maybe go ruck rourself
NIOOOOOOOOOO
Buying the dip on PLTR with leaps ü§ëüöÄüöÄ
wtf does PLTR even do
All I'm saying it's likely not gonna dip hard again today. If anything if you got in at 40 Friday you should be good.
is solo dead
buy puts then and share positions
DADDY LIKES WHAT DADDY SEES
Aye good shit dude let's go to the moon brotha

All of my stocks are like this
Feels like someone pissed into my eyes.
If you didn‚Äôt buy nio at 41 why would you buy it at 44.5
Why am I messing with the mouse
pre market doesn't mean shit in nio casee lol

it just a way of sending the pussies away
Hang in there - you are 100% correct it will come back.  Frustrating as hell watching it just spin it‚Äôs wheels here, but no reason to sell now.  So, I guess we wait...
Dead count bounce nioooo
fuck i sold 50 out of 100 of my 21c
PLTR forgot to refuel from it‚Äôs premarket moon mission but it‚Äôs all good now lads

On Friday I bought SPY puts expiring today and forgot I had no day trades left. Forced to hold over the weekend so I bought CCL calls as a retarded hedge. Pretty much broke even. Big brain moves

Who's that one person downvoting everything positive about NIO? Y'all were so adamant about it crashing and now y'all are quiet
How much?
If only there were an investment strategy where one‚Äôs wealth requires more and more investors getting in so that the first people can make money. A scheme, if you will.
tech has survived the first 10 min of the vaccine sell-off.
Spy intraday moving is dead for now. Will probably trade flat and will not deviate more than .2% again :(
Repeat of last Monday. Let‚Äôs go. New routine

Anyone who's had NIO has already made a shit ton of money off it lmao. It's only the people who bought in at 45+ on Friday isn't raking

THIS MARKET IS RETARDED AF.
hold on brother the day just started
There are a lot of people with skin conditions and allergies, yes. However, this was within 48 hours of being administered a vaccine, there was nothing else out of the ordinary done, no new foods, no new irritants. Yet, within that short space of time he suddenly developed a major skin condition all over his body and ended up allergic to foods that he was fine with before. Maybe it wasn't the vaccine but vaccines do have side effects, that is well documented, and this could well have just been a rare side effect.
Don‚Äôt worry NIO, these are happy tears
Thank god the nio dip happened pm i woulda been weak and sold if it was during market hrs ...
Anyone else in FCEL?
Tsm baby
no paperhands pussy
So we have AZ, Novavax, inovio?! Can some1 confirm this?! So every1 in this sub can male money and not argue?

NIO parabolic!
I'm looking at NIO right now like Thanos. 

"Impossible"
1. It‚Äôs still down
2. Got out 60% at open for 220% gain. So. Got some lemons
All the nio bears in shambles
Down from $54 to $41.
Yeah bro, I can see it's on a total tear.
Unfortunately for you, it's the wrong direction.
Lol NIO calls barely down
I warned people it was gonna dump all morning but the hate was real
Nio always does the opposite at the beginning of the day
What did you buy in at? I bought in at $16.40
Nio touched right
Nah you inverse the ego. So if everyone is saying its going down you should assume it's going up.

This NIO come up was obvious. Bears deserve to get fucked if they bought puts
Thank the gods NIO. I was so depressed before open.
Fuck, everyone here was way too bullish on BABA. Should've known.
DIE BEARS!!
Any news on palantir? Or just healthy pullback?
Give it a couple minutes lol
Don‚Äôt get short squeezed NIO bears I see y‚Äôall getting excited lmao.
Whew taking profits on 60% of these NIO puts at open seems wise. Maybe I‚Äôll regret that after earnings tho...
Back to our regularly scheduled programming
Come on gme now worried about Jan calls :(
651 shares of PLTR my body is fucking ready. I now simp for Alex Karp and Peter Thiel

Pfizer  said 90%, Moderna says 95%. Next week AstraZeneca will say 98%
Diamond hands my brethren...diamond hands....
YES YES YES YES
Lol
So if we have good vaccine news why tf does dkng have to dump too
Lost $1,235 in 6 minutes lol
NIO has to scare out the weak hands before it can go higher, that‚Äôs just how the market works, it‚Äôs the rules.
wrong sub for that one hahaha tiramisuboi
Loaded up on PLTR calls rn
Wow I‚Äôm SO fucked
Hopped in on target calls 12/04. Got burned by Walmart earnings in the past multiple times when target rode the wave

I must have a bunch of boomer shit
WSB sentiment on NIO was very bearish. NIO to 48+ today.
Sold some 5p BCLI for dec18 (IV 330+) only based on the "dd" provided on this board on Saturday. Let's see if it's tendies town or bustoville.
$JETS puts for me
OHHH HERE IT COMES BOYZZZZ

Yes yes yes this is what I like to see

It doesn't matter because the vaccine is on the way. The market is forward looking not irrational when there is a certainty to an outcome
PLTR news isn't good, turns out it was trading at less than $4 a share pre-ipo internally for a reason
Spy poots 

RSI overbought, $10-20 above MAs

Just don‚Äôt make any sense fr I know better though, logic loses money in this market

I think most on this sub are sour on Canoo because it didn't double overnight when u/Glideoutside [posted about it back in early August](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3361o/dd_540000_says_hennessy_capital_hcac_buys/) with a hypothesis that HCAC was going to acquire Proterra.

I am long on Canoo with 2,200 shares. The merger deadline is 12/31/2020. I *think* institutional money has been sitting out because they can't have a lot of money sitting idle waiting on a merger, merger might not actually happen, etcetera. It is going to be interesting to see what happens when the merger is announced. I think Canoo's B2B last mile delivery potential is significant, and I'd be pretty surprised if there isn't an unannounced major deal.
Y‚Äôall buy the PLTR dip?
Damn spce
Wtf has been wrong with TSLA lately? Isn‚Äôt it supposed to moon?
[deleted]
Yup. Been bagholding for ages. It never does shit.
we are heading towards civil war yet you have a bunch of degenerate gamblers betting it on SPX/QQQ calls pushing gamma covering into crazy new all time highs. What a time to be alive.

NIO PUMPING
1. Mysterious virus released from China, sinks President's approval rating - 

2. "no vaccine possible, likely until the end of 2021" -

3. Trump loses election on mail in ballots. Deep state opponent declares victory.

4. Perfect vaccine(s) immediately ready for emergency approval. Boomers start booking cruises again

Dont give up. Hiring will pick up again in the new year as more companies lift the hiring freeze. New year, different plan/budget numbers for them to work with. As economic activities slowly rebound with vaccination, hiring will pick up as well. Process will be slow, but just hang in there

Nah jelquing leads to ED I heard so just pulling on the head for 60 secs and pulling from lower on the base for 60 secs. Could have been unrelated I guess but it was after the age of 21 so I would think I was done growing by then.

Vaccine pump, you already dead
This market is bullshit, why are we not at 370 yet
Rest of tech still will probably bring it down tho
Yeeessh. Okay then. Glad I didn‚Äôt plan on that one.
NIO. Dying. FSR mooning. Your choice. Tendy or no Tendy?
What.. they just released a vaccine. Why would it sell off.. deary me
Lmao seriously
Oil calls are cheap.  Anyone buying on the pricing in of travel increasing?  Yes, OPEC/Saudis may release more oil to keep prices down, but how about for a short term play?
scared to open my RH account because jd dropped so much

It‚Äôs literally last week again, buy the dip
Nah.
Inversing WSB would be to get more puts. Literally everyone has calls.
I'm a bit nervous with NIO, but I think that it's got promise. I got lucky by getting in when it was around $25 and then rolled February calls into 2022 leaps on Friday. You got any opinions?
Hopefully none for PLTR üòÄ
This aged well

bro. people getting stimulus are guaranteed to be throwing it into their savings. look how long it took to get this one.

how much people are behind on debt? you're crazy if you think it's gonna stimulate the economy. Another stimulus bill will be required for that.
Nio calls easy money
I short everything y‚Äôall are bullish on, I have NIO 40p 11/20 and pltr 13p
MRNA Covid vaccine news, 94.5% effective. Tech stocks dump on news.
[deleted]
today we open at 9:30 am
Uh okay SOLO dont stop tho
In this case please sell soon. Take one for the team
yep, sell and get em shorts reeeadddyyy
Thanks a lot. I‚Äôve been eyeing TSM for awhile, but I know I‚Äôll just be way over leveraged along with my AMD position, so I might split that in half and start averaging in... 

This was the sign I needed haha
TSM Dec 4 100C PRINTING
So AMZN puts at open then?
Well, there goes half of the sub again lol
I‚Äôm good either way lololol

I am having a very bad day. I am in no mood.
Need NIO to move obscenely this week. Preferably in the green but if it dies my puts kick  in and help me
How many calls should I buy?
That would have to be the dumbest play right now
Robinhood it is then.
All my one shot hail Marys on FD's are printing so yes and no
Biden dropped the n word
Gatorade + healthy breakfast + coffee
Got some $4 puts if that helps
Bears talking about travel not returning are missing the point. $BA is also a space force stock and defense stock
I have jd and nio call :(
buy the virgin dip.
MRNA gonna sell off hard
Your asshole got torn open
This is WSB, a stocks worth months after its hype doesn‚Äôt mean anything cause us retards are buying options that expire the next day
yupppp already dumped all my shares
Dude did you seriously just go long on Nio? Losing all your money on nio is so last week.
Noice doesn‚Äôt answer my question bro lol.  I already canceled for now though, going to see what it does at opening.

Buy the $NIO dip
damn.. simple but effective. you can even get a pseudo rolling avg.. nice
Maybe your just a pussy, ever think about that?
people selling amazon because of vaccine are dumb


vaccine will increase amazon's profit margins as they don't have to spend as much on covid related costs anymore 


the majority of mom & pop shops that closed down, will remain closed down permanently and those retailers that went bankrupt will remain bankrupt. Amazon's competitive edge has been widened and secured 


Only thing worrying is potential of anti-trust and higher taxes
NIO will find that retard strength. Always inverse WSB.
Alright NIO üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàs, I bought the dip, don‚Äôt fuck my ass, alright?
Yes
I still love you NIO, I still believe in you!!!!! Moonshot!!!!

So many other choices at that price that would have made u a winner, loser
No it doesn't.
MRNA puts?
Don‚Äôt see what?
I‚Äôve been in SE for a while, I think it‚Äôll go to $500 by 2025, been on BABA, JD, & TSM for minute as well. It‚Äôs mostly going into a diversified index fund that I don‚Äôt have to manage, it‚Äôs in my retirement account so I‚Äôm not touching it for 30yrs+...

I'm doubling down on 11/20 $42C (only have one so I'm playing peasant money) but I'm not convinced that this won't get pumped right back up to $50 going in to ER
It may (may) never hit that again...

Holding $23 avg, this is the way.
As of 9:25am Monday, NIO is currently down 3.22. I think you're gonna be alright brother
ER is like in 2 days, also I think some analysist upgraded it to 610 or smth.
Spy puts
DON‚ÄôT BUY GREEN.  BUY RED, HOLD LONG. SIMPLE. #FreeGame
It looks like it's opening above $16. What dump?

Ask yourself how much would you kick yourself if you didnt sell at open.

People forget quickly.  No good news now.  This is peak euphoria
sell PLTR puts?
It was all over the news that Moderna would release news of their vaccine this week.. what a bizarre play
Both
It will hit 60 EOW just be patient
Or we go to war with Gyna, it gets delisted, and you're interrogated as a suspected commie.

Praise be thy lord thy NIO come deliver us to your warm tendies pls amen
Congrats!!
Lol
China will take you down after earnings
nope
Nothing is guaranteed yes, but they‚Äôre just getting started. They already make and sell the most Chinese EVs and their battery swapping tech have already completed over a million swaps. They‚Äôve got EU expansion plans and already have presence in the form of their Formula E team in the UK. Europe has been calling out for a cheaper Tesla competitor and this should fill that gap. And I can see their BaaS take off. Obviously the EU expansion is not confirmed but UK have pledged over a billion to make a EV gigafactory, there‚Äôs finally some traction in the UK.
All the crappy stocks just woke up from the dead and haunting me like thriller
Whats spy hitting today boys
Damson
Yea, I do. It went down 8% that day. That day was Friday.
Spy 330 EOD
Who the fuck buys $12 calls on a stock worth $5 at best.
Nah I‚Äôm selling at open
Yea there is always the Rist that they just drop their support like luckin failed.. I will wait for the Numbers of Nio  if they are any good I will buy.

Palantirs numbers were pretty solid and ofc spy tech and whatever weird government contracts they have going are always lucrative

Many autists learn about pump and dump today.
Nope. Get out before
Great time to buy more
Sorrento is more of a technical. It keeps on consolidating along support. I think it is about to get some good news soon and an insider knows it. I am not long on it and I plan to drop it the second they have really really good news. Also, they have the potential to partner with other drug companies to produce their vaccines for fees.
Tech at all time highs, wants to buy in for ‚Äúcheap‚Äù
NIO showing signs of life!
üòÜüòÜüòÜ and it's true
Why did I double down on stupid calls on Friday instead of enjoying my profits over the weekend
value is dead. long live value
Not last Monday after the vaccine news lol
Hold 11/20 15c or sell?
PFE you fucking cunt
Moderna leadership seems scummy as well. I don‚Äôt buy it.
NIO won‚Äôt go under 40, nice entry point at 41 today if you can grab it before it rockets
US government subsidized tesla heavily because it is advantageous for us to lead the way in ev. Why would the Chinese government not also see this?

Dow Jones is going up, good day for boomers.
That's what I tell myself after I lost 2k on calls but limit sold 10 shares @48
Lol I'm so glad I sold on Friday at the top. I was big on NIO but I knew when to cash out. Now I'm using my gains to buy popcorn and watch the loss porn for people who Dimond hands 10 banggers onto worthless
Imagine staring down a fucking plane and being like, "Bring it mf"
Lmao thats the wsb motto

Why yall hating? this man down -3 negative votes and he profiting. here man, take my energy  +1
SPY rallied at the end of the day last week lol
Honestly gme could be a good return story if they tried making games again. All they need is to buy a developing company and pump out games that they themselves as sell. Or better yet make a console
Ah, pre-crash. Probably a lot of eating shit on $ALLY, especially.

Buy more PLTR puts so the brokers have to buy more underlying. Let's go!

Ban!
Last Monday we got a vaccine pump too. Everything that was up at open hit it's high of day by 10am then went down

Short my calls on NIO or hold through until earnings what the fuck do I do, I got two 11/27s
OP, you shouldn't count echo chambers as candidate subreddits. So what I'm saying is none of these subreddits are valid, including this one.
I'd expect PCM to be up there
Imagine being as retarded as me and bought 2000 shares of NIO literally at $52.30 LOL

Btw I‚Äôm still confident in this stock, I‚Äôm more than sure eventually it will hit the $100 mark wether it‚Äôs next year or in the next 3 years.
Who‚Äôs shorting MRNA?
Retarded you mean?
I wish I had SPY calls
Were people back in the days memeing Coca cola during its pump like we do with the tech stocks and where the bears also saying stuff like its just sugar water?
Wow LL was great for me. Doubled my account in an hour or two. Miss those days
Ight so you gunna post your puts pussy, or you all talk
Y'all should just yolo on some shroom stonks
I'm not buying shit at open
Anyone else ever wake up with all three day trades and just come off a winning position.....and proceed to annihilate your account in less than an hour?

Only socialists and commies buy NIO, TSLA is American as it gets.

Remember when the president wasn‚Äôt telling everyone to sell ?
I mean that for sure is legal it's when you do it rapidly and alot that issues can arise
I'm expecting big things on that stock we are already above the settled gap price so there should be little resistance on the way back up.
I feel ya, if last week was any indication, SPY will fade over the day.
My üí© is runnnning on this toilet right now

I think I‚Äôll pick up some puts. People think to play earnings the week off, now is the time to sell

i got spce on friday. what a fucking disaster.
I‚Äôm already down 50% lmao
Well, when the March crash happened they definitely weren‚Äôt way up lmao. Most of us got wiped out since being WSB, we had weeklies or FDs.
WSB all getting ready to short Nio is a sign to buy calls
Bears saying market RIGGED we won the election
Could be useful for predicting new ones but idk what a spreadsheet is so you‚Äôre gonna have to do it
Wtf I didn‚Äôt expect NIO TSLA to be down at open today
Is it too obvious to buy the dip on stay at home stocks like last week? What am I not getting here

Hell is coming
No lol. That‚Äôs literally buy high sell low.
please sir this is not the place to realize that the market isn‚Äôt for you

Gonna buy more
Sell SPY puts at open and buy calls? Fuck lmao

I just checked and lol you're right. I saw the initial spike from 1 to 2%, but it's all been given back now. Imagine being the idiot who bought that top thinking this was another Pfizer announcement. 

> Also, MRNA's trial is a bit shitty...only a couple hundreds people instead of 30,000 people like Pfizer.

This market has pumped over and over again on bad science reporting, or flat-out bad science. I've lost all faith in the frat bros and algors that control this market to know how to read a paper much less interpret its results properly.

Thanks for your post as well. It‚Äôs nice to get some advice in here while we all continue to call each other retards and üåàüêª
Sir,  may I ask who hurt you?
Why bother with NIO? 

Spy calls free money, and it gaps up more lol
No guarantee it will be back up in a year tho. Stock has already made a huge gain from the dollar lows this year alone. Maybe end of next year if they really get their deliveries up.
This summer of tech was fun. But fall is here, finance and travel will be hot.
lookin at HD as well, what strike you buying
Same look at my history :(
Gonna do a small lottery play on moderna puts see if it crashes like Pfizer last week

Wasn't all that logical given the vaccine news was a known catalyst
Fuck. I'm going to have to sell soon seeinh this.
Honestly I hope there's at least another six month bo sail order so I can bag a couple more stocks
This was pretty much like the gap from 43 to 39 last wednesday which filled quite quickly
Gotta flip to NIO calls around mid 30's

Vaccine 95% effective

Placebo is running at 2x cases what would be baseline while vaccine is running at 95% below

I think it‚Äôs bullshit. Placebo shouldn‚Äôt be that high
Whats the play at open boys
Another vaccine anther thrashing on my tech stocks. Fml ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è can we get another pandemic by any chance?

NIO 25p‚Äôs at open if you‚Äôre not already holding.
The goog old vaccine pump that never fails.
PLTR will most likely rebound though and continue to grow. NIO was just an overhyped meme stock.

Buy back my 55c and sell a 50c
>led to him developing a very severe skin condition and similarly severe allergies within a short space of time after the vaccine

Curious why this is directly attributed to the vaccine? Not saying its not possible, but it seems like a logical leap to attribute responsibility to vaccine, on the basis of it happening before. Put another way, are there not millions of people with such issues, where the incidence was not at all tied to a vaccine?
The sheer sell pressure on NIO is insane.
NIO $35 EOD
Year !?
Hilarious that they used COVID measures as an excuse.  How gullible do they think people are?  I guess quite gullible, since people have kept this PoS at $20 for months.  This thing will be bankrupt by the end of 2022.
I promise NIO green EOD
I‚Äôm holding my puts, I guess.... Will probably buy shorter dated calls depending on first hour action
Same for 11/20 100c so excited

implied move was like 22% or something... crazy high. too much expectation. and it just beat a bit...
Which is exactly why I havent done it. Lol. I know this is what should happen but this market this year has shown me it doesn't fucking care about my rational ideas.
Have to admit this is the only stock I went with purely on WSB suggestion which granted is a shit idea. But bought on at $26 and still holding. Didn‚Äôt do any of my own DD on this one. Rest of my positions I‚Äôm pretty solid on. A bit of a YOLO on my part tbh.
Yea when people got the stimulus plus the extra 600, not anymore tho
lmao hopefully my Dec 125 call print by then
wtf pton this stock is always cucking me in the end i never learn.
Why?
They're trading has been halted...hmmm
Lmao i read monday 16th and got scared lmaoooo
This is a trap to make people sell, watch buyers come in at market open. Give it 11 minutes
10:30am is the time to sell, 2:30pm is the time to buy. works every time

Fair point
It‚Äôs Papi
Do you understand what your saying? 40 to 60 is a 50% gain you honestly think the stocks just gonna jump 50% post earnings November is nearly half way done your options expire beginning of next month don‚Äôt fall for the sunk cost fallacy
Exactly the same happened last JD earnings..
Buy the dip on NIO?
Literally what‚Äôs the point in selling NIO shares. It‚Äôll head back up in a year. You didn‚Äôt buy shares to pump and dump it
What do you mean with big fuk dear sir? ;( I went all in on this shit -\_\_-
are they running to the new BANKS of cruises and airlines??
Don't hold ACB it's trash
How‚Äôs NIO gang doing today?
Look at my history. I suggested buying AMC for todays Moderna short squeeze. Of course I didn‚Äôt follow through :(
This is the one
Twas an obvious bull trap my friend

Yes, continue to push NIO down. Making it cheaper to stack shares
What‚Äôs the next Fomo? Fsr looks nice.
I thought after that pump for cyclical stocks it would be perfect to go into tech calls and travel puts. I guess I should have inverse myself. Too logicial
Yeah man. Poor guys.

Yes shorts are going to bring it down to the ground
We are fucked guys
Wtf is a fax....
Just wait until us degens are released on Nio again. Don't sweat it fellas
Did some research into FUBO cause it sounded like free money but the company sucks rn and is way more expensive than competitors.
NIO went full GUH
Why the fuck is JD tanking when earnings beat smh
NIO isn't surprising, the PLTR fade hurt
What are so good overseas fast movers you‚Äôre looking at? High volume preferably
I feel bad for the NIO call holders.

I was here back in March for the LL, ALLY and PLUG hype.

Anyone buying puts at open?
At least let me have my hope

Maybe they were hedging a short? Maybe they made a mistake?
SPY's bull run begins today, no?
Id cancel and wait for the price to go down then invest the 5k

yea but break even is at 48.50 i shouldnt lose too much if at all at some point it will test 50 this week
The only reason most people are scared of nio is because other people are selling it, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a logical reason to be fearful with them
They have them rn but to keep the lines down they‚Äôve hidden the needles around the back of the parking lot, just help yourself
I won‚Äôt do anything in the first 30. I won‚Äôt do anything in the first 30. I won‚Äôt do anything in the first 30.

Wrong sub cuck
So I have AAWW calls expiring this Friday, I‚Äôm down 99.9% on them, is there anything I should do (like exercise them or something) or just take the L and focus on other parts of my portfolio
‚ÄúAwesome day to jump onto the NIO train!‚Äù Said every NIO bag holder
NIO will actually end up closing the day at 35 fml

So?

Do i switch my nio calls to puts at open or try planatir?
Fisker is part of an EV forum in california this afternoon apparently. FSR run up all day then dump? seems like all tech companies pump in anticipation of any headline and then no matter what gets announced it's a stock fire sale
Go look my post history
A whole lot of people gonna get hurt and I am not talking just NIO. A lot of those PTON, SHOP, PINS,... can easily get cut in half by this time next year!
PLTR CALLS I KNOW SOMEONE WHO USED TO WORK THERE THEN BECAME A CEO NOW IS FILTHY RICH
No, I don't think anybody else really thought it was going to the moon
RIP NIO call holders... Damn
The "rotation out of tech" is going to be what drives the market to ATHs

Yes
Lmao really can‚Äôt believe you fuckers bought into NIO on some bullshit DD
Not gonna close these spy calls to early value stocks will recover through the week

Fuck Nio as in it‚Äôs a lil bitch go the fuck down u shit stock
Nio is gonna bounce off of 39 and rally the rest of the week like how it did last week.
Fake as fuck, they're pumping. Watch what happens next
not even 1% pump. Futures were already up 0.9%. 

Having said that, Pfizer said that their technique works when they released their results that they expect all other vaccine companies using the same technique to be successful. that was MRNA. Also, MRNA's trial is a bit shitty...only a couple hundreds people instead of 30,000 people like Pfizer.
I believe in you BABA. You can do it!
So when can I go get some vaccine from Walmart?
can u sell asap then pls

I look forward to hearing about the colossal number of shares the Moderna CEO will be selling today
NIO getting dumped premarket. Lots of WSB will be bagholders in this pile of shit
Mcconnell doesn't matter like he did last round. Blue house, blue executive, only one senate republican needs to cross sides (several are going for re-election in 2022, Collins has floated the idea of pushing for stimulus, as an example), and this is all discounting the possibility of GA runoff going in our favor. 

There's literally nothing more important to Biden's first term. It's the only promise he made. Stimulus is 100% going to happen.
Dude you realize stocks correct right?
Positions?
At this point, I just feel sorry for NIO gang
[deleted]
Lmao you guys are this salty ü§£
Low volume swings most likely
Guys I bought puts
The bad: I'm stuck at home with a positive rona test.

The good: I can watch the NIO bloodbath in real time, uninterrupted.
Dude it's worse than that.

If you idiots haven't gotten out of the Chinese scam companies, you better do it today. Investors are going to take their money out of these supposed "safe havens" and reinvest in American companies after the new vaccines news.

>probably no stimulus going to be passed for months on end. 

>moderna news comes out as soon as the NYSE opens

Does anyone see that as just too convenient or just me? There‚Äôs no actual pump it‚Äôs just illusionary based on promises.
You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcall it‚Äù or ‚Äúwarn us‚Äù, you‚Äôre  just lucky lmao be right 20 times in a row and maybe you‚Äôre on to something
ahahah get fucking wrekt
The economy was never as strong as any politician ever said it was. This will be no different. Eventually everyone will be off of unemployment benefits despite not returning to the workforce and politicians will be fine. The people will suffer as they have been and nothing will be done. You think this country is doing well? How many people die a year of overdoses? Nothing done. How many people in this country drowning in debt? Nothing done. How many people in the next generation cannot afford a home? Nothing done. Without the pandemic do any of those things sound like this country has the worlds greatest economy?
Dibs on Gazerbeam
Lol i bought a 2022 $5 call on Friday

ive talked too much shit to lose on nio
$Plnt
Battery as a service
Yup should have held everything from Fri F
Then 38 lol
.... I'ma just hold my 12/4 NIO Call. My biased reasoning is this is mostly retail selling off due to weak hands and then after earnings NIO will get more price upgrades and MM will buy up the dip pushing this to 60+ within a week or two. I'd be damned if I sell at the bottom anyway, again for 100th time.
Tech comin back too. Man, the days when your 401k and Roth makes a killing and your YOLO brokerage account does too.. you just love to see it. My 3 inch cock is just continuing to grow

Lol hey NIO call holders,how are you feeling now?
I think I‚Äôm close to becoming an omelette genius
It literally can and probably will. They can crater it, take all the investors money, and reorganize just to do it all over again. There is no SEC to save you in China
Feeling confident in FSR and PLTR
The whole market looks like it‚Äôs gonna be üåàtoday but it‚Äôs been making me money. I bought in around 4.75 on Thursday

Yeah, the main issue is the sample size of the testable attribute was only around ~200.

They can only really count results from people exposed to covid, given 90 placebo volunteers, and 5 Vax volunteers were infected, the group exposed was around 200.

Now 5 in 100 being infected is still great news, but the error bars are gonna be huge.
Appropriate username
That happens any time theres a meme stock. Happened with DKNG, happened with NKLA (if for only a short time) and it's still a thing with TSLA. Nio wasnt the first and it wont be the last.

Sell AAL calls at open?
Cheetos Pee Pee is trying his best to burn down the nation via Tweet in his final days. It's no longer moving the market like it used to. Sad. It will, however, further divide the nation and cause more chaos that will increase volatility in the coming weeks. I'm looking for a minor correction this week and then another big upswing after that plays out.

Of course losing money...they are growing rapidly.  Tesla lost money for 10 years.  What I'm waiting for is the 4Q delivery projections with the dual shifts.  Could surprise us all.

Not gonna lie though...this is painful

yup.
I don't get why healthcare biotech stocks ( Which will save the world) are flat or up 2% while cruise and airlines 20%.WTFüò≥
Yea we need some more meme hype on this.
Any stimulus is good stimulus. Their going to extend unemployment cus a lot of peoples is going to run out after January. Money for schools, money for small business to remain open during shutdowns PPP and more so idk what clowns on this sub think but we are forsure getting some sort of stim
To be fair, it hasn‚Äôt been able to hold that area for too long so far.
yes ive been sleeping earlier and getting up earlier to get back that feeling of preparing for the day
FUCK
With good reason it's dumped three times now from these highs and last weeks 9:30am gap down is even more cause for concern.

The part I don‚Äôt get is why companies like AAPL go down with vaccine news. ZM - sure; AMZN - okay, but why tech that will be just as or more popular post vaccine
Lol look at all these guys bailing on nio before earnings. Fucking gang bangers lol

Closed on Friday at $6.20. Prior to Covid, TWO had not seen south of $12.00 for more than 5-years.
Smart thinking, one problem: the market isn‚Äôt that rational. The UK market literally sky rocketed once it announced a second lockdown.
i feel attacked
12/18 calls. Diamond hands
At least this is on actual news. Was laughable over the summer how many times the CEO shilled his stock on no news so he could dump shares
Yo for real!! I made my money and bounced.. others refuse to accept its time to move on.
LOL the only way SPY goes to 400 this week is if they find a vaccine for eternal life
You have nio calls?
$NOK BUY BUY BUY
NIO could be the next SOLO
You think you could find a news article with less ad AIDS?
People actually think the month the vaccine is released everything opens back up and we go back to normal.

And then the fact that a vaccine doesn‚Äôt bring back a lot of the businesses that shuttered for good.
95 positives in a study of 30k right? 90 of those positives had the placebo
I found the Texan.
It won‚Äôt tho probably

It'll be a one day pop. Today is that day
I doubt it bro. Pre market sucks. Serves me right for trading mainstream stocks.  I made about 2k last 2 months playing around with banks and merchant stocks but I wanted a quick buck and before my 3 day was up fucking citron fucked my game up. in one day I was up 1000 dollars. Fuck citron

I feel like going a few months out on spy puts. Once this market realizes we still have a long while before we actually get a vaccine, plus rising cases and shutting down the country again, this shit gonna correct hard.
TSLA looks like it's going to pop off any day now
NIO or BABA bitches
My CNBC feed is the worst channel on my cable.  Constantly, cutting and glitching.  So annoying.
They gave out 15k people placebo with no effect in which 90 people got infected,5 with severe illness...another 15k with real vaccine,11 got infected,no severe illness

Webull is better, but not as shiny as robinhood. And I can do the options on robinhood without any real speed bumps. Webull and others won't approve me.

Sure but next earnings date is after this expires
I think it will dip further. There‚Äôs gonna be massive panic selling.
If that's true, he won't pass it with or without vaccine news. Plus if the GOP wins the senate and he blocks stim in the spring, the whole economy is going tits up anyway.
More shutdowns announced market it going to tank over the next month.,
? Its still down a lot
Bears did this same thing to Tesla, can someone with an unbiased opinion please tell me when it‚Äôs going to hit 49 next so I can exit my shares, and if you say never you are wrong! Just because I don‚Äôt like that answer. That‚Äôs how mangos mind works
i bout it at 24 and have been holding since. hoping it spikes up just to get it off my hands
Thanks, brainiac, I don't need you to try and educate me lmao. I don't have any positions, but you best believe there are people here who are going to hold..
This is the way
I look forward to it :)
Dogs going to be sad when Rona goes away and their human goes back to work.
Citron is behind us, but vaccine news is in front of us, people need to take money out of NIO and put it into some dumb shit like RCL

Glad they released the Moderna news today. It‚Äôs all downhill from here boys

Oh really? Okay go lobby that wish to McConnell Mongoloid.
CalPERS owns a little bit of everything on the planet so you shouldn't read much into that.

When you're that large a pension fund (>$400B), you have to deploy a lot of capital so you spread it out, and that also means small plays in high risk/high reward areas. They are mostly in larger caps, real estate, bonds, etc.
Amazon calls anyone?
In Pooh's hands.
Doubtful.
Yessir
Ya'll should know by now that Moderna is going to pump and dump again.

 Every time, they release promising news on Friday. People immediately buy on the news and then they sell hard on Monday. They burned a lot of folks last Spring and early Summer.
What‚Äôs more stupid?  This play or someone asking for a rational explanation ?

Chili season, ya dodo bird
Do you realize how much it would have to go up to be 20x?
Thanks. i meant the screen thingy with all the stocks, i would like to see the same screen on my own to become a millionare
Somebody also sold those shares lmfao. Means nothing. I can buy 200k shares and sell calls to dumbasses
God Stocktwits is fucking retarded: some guy with a anime pfp saying just added another 75k shares to my long position
Well mine are for 11/20 and not that far otm... Mnra has had a huge run up for this news and I'm suspecting that it's going to selloff hard today and drag the mkts down with it just like what happened on the Pfizer news
vaccine news is over thanks for holding the line

God I hope the vaccine ends up creating x men style mutants. Dibs on magneto powers
Seems like today‚Äôs the day my account finally dies
No Baas and no Chinese gov backing. Big differences.
My thought exactly. I probably want to do it late December.
I already sold I have a little profile and took a 600 dollar loss on Friday

Black Friday sales are all month long!
when life gives me Citron's I make Citronaid
üçã
Exactly, there's plenty of examples where things like this go wrong. Take the 24hr Le Man's rivalry between Ford and Ferrari. Henry Ford wasn't well versed in building the kind of car required for 24 hour racing but he wanted to win to boost his sales. Ferrari on the other hand had a miniscule company compared to Ford but he knew what he was doing and with significantly less money he won 4 consecutive years at Le Mans. It took Ford years of spending several hundred millions of pounds in today's money, killing test drivers in dangerous vehicles and the most cutting edge technology to win the race and a good portion of why he won the race was Ferraris best driver leaving the team. 

Obviously we can make a vaccine incredibly quickly by brute forcing our way with money to buy as many scientists and labs as possible but is it worth it, is it safe and is it effective in the long term? Are we better sticking with Ferraris method of time and expertise or should we throw caution to the wind like Ford and throw money and human lives into the fray in the hope that whatever gets thrown back just works?
Go ask McConnell.
Can‚Äôt wait until reality sets in that we aren‚Äôt even close to done with contested election and vaccine will be 6 months to a year before distribution begins...25% of population will refuse it initially...the market has nothing bullish going for it at all honestly
I just hope the vaccine ends ups creating mutants and I get magneto powers
Is the nio dip gonna be bigger than the great Tsla dip ü§î

Wouldn‚Äôt touch banks with a 10 dollar bill.
thoughts on CCL this week? Hoping it gets to $20ish. Should b a pop in market for legacy companies bc of Moderna.
I don't want one, but I could see a dip as NY/other metropolitan areas consider reinstating lockdowns.
In all seriousness, BA is Boeing Airlines.

Calls, or Call Options, are leveraged forms of investment. Spend a little, own a lot. Buy your wife and her boyfriend a house if the stock goes up, or lose everything you own and sleep under the highway if the stock goes down.

NIO is the ultimate "inverse WSB" stock

All I saw were bears as it ran up from 25 ---> 45, and then as soon as the top was close, from 45 on up, all I saw were bulls.

Well, all I see now is bears again......

This is the DD that I can only get from here. Calls purchased.
Fuck that. Why would you do that now when the dems have chance to take the senate and give every body a bailout on the governments payday lending scam aka student loans. At minimum Biden has talk about $10,000 if it all. Take your gains and go make more gains, shit roll them into some long shares; don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôre returns will beat out the low interest rates on your gov payday loans
Bubble forming in the rut. 11/16/20
MRNA puts at open?
It‚Äôs not even peer reviewed yet for starters
Did you door‚Äôs handle, they look like a freaking restroom handle‚Äôs in Burger king!
Ur retarded. Volitility is why the opt prices are high. Even if it goes down after earning, youre going to lose money on both calls or puts unless it seriously soars/tanks
Rotation into xpev from nio? Half the market cap and has its own factory. Only delivering like 2k less cars. More room to run...
Keep my pita expiring Friday?

Lol moderna really trying to pump the market on a 95 person sample of the 30k they injected with their sugar water
Taking a larger International position today. COVID will be around for a long time in the US, there are too many people in the states that still think it‚Äôs a hoax and social distancing/mask wearing isn‚Äôt going to do anything to slow the spread. Facebook feed is covered with people having ‚Äòprotest parties‚Äô for Thanksgiving or Friendsgiving. Our state (WA) just shutdown restaurants again, pick up only due to 2000 new cases daily. So portfolio by the end of today will be 30% tech, 40% Int‚Äôl, 30% S&P.
Try harder.
wait until tech tanks, then buy tech calls
What makes you think the vaccine will help so fast that there won't be a need for stimulus?
Shhhh, TJX flying under the radar

Because it feels better to be right than wrong

Actually last week after the vaccine pump SPY went down $10 from Monday to Tuesday
MRNA vaccine news is based on 151 cases?

Think it‚Äôs getting FDA approval based on that?
I feel like monthly $docu calls in the 190-200 range are free money
For all the good tesla has done for many of you retards. Musk has the rona.

Looks like its opening near 8% down as of now
Weekly spy calls are 10-20 baggers
[deleted]
>Calls just got cheaper.

haven't got cheaper yet
go WMT, it's your birthday
NVDA calls and spy puts were a bad idea. Am I fuk?
Lmao all where are all the nio apes I don‚Äôt understand do they only buy high or sum. You are suppose to buy the dips
You are reading incorrectly.  There were 15K+ subjects given a placebo, 15K+ given the vaccine.  

The placebo group had 95 CoVid cases.  The vaccine group, 5.
It also makes no sense that more and more Funds keep buying chunks of Nikola...and their share rising again.

I guess maybe they have something up their sleeve for Nikola Day in December with Iveco and their Ulm factory Prototypes??

Anyways I guess putting EV in your Company's description is already enough to justify a billion dollar rating.

Atleast Nio is backed by the CCP isn't it?
Good man. Profit taking is for losers. Better to go -100% than +100% your yearly...
#reminder: vaccine news means no stimulus and a rotation out of tech. If we rotate out of tech the whole market tops out. This time there won‚Äôt be a stimulus package to save it either.
I'm going to congratulate the guy on here with the aal 13c who was so worried last night.  Thats gonna print.
Where we at champ?
Oh no, looks like we got some good old fashioned basement dwelling downvoters on our hands üò© no please don‚Äôt downvote lmao, nio nerds
Yall NIO holders realize if it goes down there is literally no support till around 32.

And the fade begins
Nah arcimoto is the real rotation
I dont get why people talk shit on Man of Steel. I thought it was an excellent movie.
All right, what MRNA put strike are y‚Äôall getting at open so I don‚Äôt buy the same one.

Facts
this is the way
Yeah, doesn‚Äôt happen often.
NIO bounced off 40/39ish multiple times last week.

Think it's going to do that again in the short term or blast through it?
11.16.2020

The day suits didn‚Äôt do their job and let bulls become overnight millionaires..

7 figures is no longer the goal since everyone has it now
Half get placebo vaccine and half get the actual vaccine. They waited for 95 to get covid.
[removed]
Lmaoooo
Why?
Don‚Äôt think anyone on this sub qualifies for expert. Thanks tho
Pltr
Sell everything. Then buy it back for cheaper at end of day for later this week
They got their 95% value from saying that out of the 95 people that Covid from their trial, only 5 had the vaccine. They say the trial consisted of 30k but the Pfizer trial also said 43k but most news didn‚Äôt report that 38k hadn‚Äôt received the 2nd dose and weren‚Äôt part of it
Hope you are right

You NIO bears missed that 200k share buy at 38.5 or whatever, hey? That's the bottom yo.
Fuck u
TLDR: my 11/16 spy puts r fuk
Hop on the other RIP NIO post.
My only concern is states like MI and ND completely shutting down and it becoming more and more likely everywhere. Online retail is good but any place with large store presence makes me nervous
Yep. But if you are looking long term (beyond 2021) I am thinking around10 to 15 percent below there precovid prices is about right with the debt adds baked in.
lol should've done this 2 weeks ago
Moderna news came out as soon as the NYSE opened. HMMMMM
I like a good storyline
Let me buy my shares first, then go.
Sold 3 12/18 70$ strike calls of nio and bought 6 12/18 $30 puts on Friday. Trying to hedge because I‚Äôm holding 600 shares at $4 avg :s
Ow Robinhood my eyes
So I was promised CCL $25 at open? Where is it
Guess I was correct
Money rotating because of vaccine news... people are like gold fish, tomorrow, or maybe even later today, people will remember that NIO and Chinese EV's are killing it.
Amc
Just because they said to short them after they profited on their run up is exactly why I‚Äôm buying the dip. They‚Äôve been wrong about ever single company they‚Äôve ever shorted lmfao and one of them was Tesla
Take easy. Trump definitely will claim this and your dad will take this vaccine. Your dad and his friends will be healthy
will nio bounce at 40 again? ü§î
going to actually invest in my fellow gamblers. . MGM calls lets get it
Wallstreetbets pump and dump *
I been following Citron for years. I usually buy the dip after their short attacks. There are many other tradrrs who do the same.
I'm NIO gang till I die. Imma hold these NIO 11/27 calls till it either reaches 50 or until it expires next week.

I disagree with you, Biden winning wasn't really priced into a sinking pre-election market, but I appreciate your well articulated viewpoint.
Fucking right. Buying puts for limited upside is poured into a flask stupid.
Lol virus news is already priced in. That fake and gay pump in futures meant nothing LOL LOL LOL.
I don't know what it is, but there is some kind of sadistic joy I get from seeing Dow and S&P rocket in the futures while the NASDAQ sags. I can't remember the last time the NASDAQ was leading the pack, it just seems to be floundering constantly. I dunno, I find it funny.
This is why I was telling people to not get into NIO, its been running up far too long yet I legit saw people with 12/18 60c believing that it will print
Good move
PLTR will be $50 by the end of next year
[removed]
Gimme $17 again PLTR.
So nio down to 38 then slowly inverse to close around 43
Last week
I'd love to buy it from him.
The logical conclusion is that we get a repeat of last week with a larger fall. So stocks will moon! üöÄ
Y‚Äôall really let the China Men drop their bags on you all with NIO. SMH
Anyone holding 11/20 PLTR calls
But the amount of people buying the actual cars NIO is producing is significantly less than Tesla was at the same market cap
fake vaccine pump
Designed that way?
Welp, there goes another 20% of this sub
Work with a lot of boomers, they all bought in after the split
I just need SPY to say the N word at some point today.
Gotta admit.. My flair with the 35 is the king of all tarded flair.
I have a stop order set for $35 for my 10. Hopefully it never triggers

Aim I reading the article correctly? In the moderna vaccine trial they only tested 100 people?
Expiry?
TJX or Kohl's? Does anyone like these plays? I know we are forced to play Boomer stocks today so let's go -- my girlfriend makes me go to TJX stores all the time and I honestly kinda really like their business model.
Come on guys... It was an innocent defenseless animal just trying to take care of her little cub. Do you have no compassion?! Buncha jerks
Thinking sell all AAPL stock to buy PLTR how autistic am I?
Double dicking
Getting out of them today most likely
Imagine if you 10 or 20k worth of shares a few months. Your life would be sorted financially for ever
I wasn't a perma-bull, but I was at least expecting a decent little run up prior to earnings release.
[removed]
NIO tards must've heard that the vaccine is distributed through NIO air vents
I'm balls deep on PLTR 13c so I'd love nothing more, but what makes you say 20? Is this just another stock where valuation means nothing? $20/share is ~33b market cap. Considering sinking in another huge chunk into shares, but can't tell if there's a reason for this idea or if it's just WSB hopium
My boomer parents were pissed when Sept cruise got cancelled. They have already booked a new one for early fall 2021.
You‚Äôll see
Uh, should I sell my mgm puts and nio calls right away? Seems like I‚Äôm going to get killed soon.
Sorry
*no one likes that*
nio settling; on to the next meme, boys
If you're still playing NIO weeklies it's best to consider buying and holding shares after ER. It's going to be extremely volatile in the coming months. Best to go long and hold.
Citron needs to got public so Nio can release an article on them
Yes
Yall need to take your garbage pumps elsewhere. Go over to penny stocks and bother those degenerates.
NIO is going to pump *before* ER. Question is when and how much.
C (Citigroup) 55C 01/15 guaranteed to print
TSLA headed back to $420.

Anytime you see a NIO bull trying to shill the stock just comment with : üçã
Just remember that NIO is the 3rd most valuable car company in the world atm. Makes no sense IMO.
Nio already had a massive run up
yup. it was a quintessential pump and dump.
Hope so but why?
No.
I think today will be different as in QQQ will pump into green today and SPY and DOW will finish off around the same levels as tech
Perfect. Both my value positions and tech positons will open flat. Absolute perfection wow, amazing.
Amen to that, gotta count our blessings.
It's current year, anything is possible.
lmao best analogy
Nio is easy to day trade
Nio is starting to look like a classic Chinese pump and dump

We‚Äôre gonna see some green large big dildo at open.. not gonna say which Ticker
At least its not free falling
BOOMER STOCKS
Unless its in leaps a few months out, I wouldn't mind a pull back. I only have a 12/4  but fucking 68c on NIO. Having doubts it'll hit that after ER unless it blows it out of the water. Already down 50%. Really unsure whether to even hold or sell
I have, ugly as shit unless it‚Äôs top range
NIO to the crater of the moon!
Rescheduled test flight due to covid
Jesus boys I have a 415c ZM. double down like a boss or paper hand cause rona is over

Yes!

Definitely the play. Biden may clear a portion of your loans.
only because of citron im very upset right now I hope Andrew left gets put in prison

I believe it was $44.60 at midnight, I bought 114.6 shares, I think it will execute the opening price though...
Hey I‚Äôm only 31 and I love CCL!
IV is gonna kill ya. That shit is at 110%
NIO bulls r fuk
It's just had a - 8% day last week
Just gives me a better entry point for when it hits 60 after ER
Dont buy calls at the top idiots, the ath doesnt last long

y'all might wanna sell those millennial stonks with 50 P/E's and trade em in for some nice boomer stocks with 10 P/E's

Yes Jan 22 $37

I am pretty sure there is a lot of insider trading going on but I don‚Äôt think this has anything to do with Mango or the elections. It wouldn‚Äôt have changed the outcome anyway.

NIO BROS SHIFT YOUR ATTENTION TO PLTR LETA GET THIS FUCKER TO 20
My thought too, it can't help shitting the bed on news. Was hoping to see it jump more than this before getting in though.
I have 90k worth of student loans to pay off and I can still say that losing 15k of hard earned money would still hurt worse.

I don‚Äôt really like money, but it‚Äôs good to see those so bullish on NIO are losing their shit
Is cool! Froze once but that's all
Agree... puts are probably a good call considering ü¶† is coming back hot
This is the first time I've said this. But I'll wait, per u.
If it does.  It‚Äôs overrrrrrr.  Down down down we go.
Yikes man
I‚Äôm üÖ±Ô∏èack. Over the Ex. Back to the gym, no more video games, chillin on the weed, and yoloing weeklies
Can't afford your calls, Assclownzeneca, may be able to help....
Sir this is a stocktwits comment.
Please open the fucking market man
Nio is the Luckin Coffee of EVs
SPY puts are going to print all day. We open high and bleed off.
very happy I got nio puts
Because the mods on this sub are awful
Clearly the bear adopted
I mean how the hell do I know lol? Who would have called the short seller attack on Friday? Lol do what you feel is the right move.
Well my puts are fucked. Hope everyone is hopping on a plane to Vegas or boarding a cruise this weekend. Horse shit.
Traveling the world is the biggest aphrodisiac to women
For what? 4 week lockdowns? CVS &riteaid, where the boomers go now
At what price?
I was just about to buy in at open so I love it.

Thoughts on KOS? Should easily double (or more) in price in a few months.
Plenty of room in PLTR at least until 20
if QQQ can hold this 289.5 low support trendline then we will bounce to 294 ATH resistance

if we don't hold the 289.5 support there is a lot of downside and we could retest 270 within the next week or so

if we break the 294 support we could push to 302 then ATH

Fuck you mod.
Wtf do you think NIO was doing all of last week. That was the earnings run up. Bags everywhere now.
How much ammo do you think Dick‚Äôs has sold in the last 3 months?

Man I did not think that DIA calls would have been the best move 2 weeks ago
I‚Äôm not about to take one they made in 1 year when the fastest one ever made before this was 4 yrs. I get that there‚Äôs more companies working on it and more money then ever before looking at it, but if it takes a girl 9 months to have a baby you can‚Äôt have 9 girls do the job in a month
Definitely were not able to hold the 147 they hit after earnings though.
Dow to  break 29095 today
Idc about long term. For me it‚Äôs weekly terms.
No that‚Äôs SPR vs S@ve
That's what all his reports look like. At least he didn't manage to grab the mouse cursor in any of his screenshot copy-and-pasting this time.
Not a call, just plain stocks, 114.6 shares...
Buying more puts so everyone's calls can print tomorrow
Literally cant go tits up
Nah, fuck this. abandoning ship on NIO at open and jumping into something else. Fear is setting in hard pre-market and this could retest 35-37 by EOD. Any more room in PLTR?
Welp my monday puts are dead
SPCE fell off a cliff

Don‚Äôt think MMs will let us do that again but i hope

Don't be too sure about this bet. ...I sent that to dad (a Trumper) ...this is what he replied:

"I don't trust the Moderna. Will not take its vaccine. Moderna is owned by George Soros, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and several other super rich liberals. I'm afraid they're going to put some microchip tracking device in the vaccine. Pfizer was first one out with a vaccine, which is supposed to be 97% effective. They are a good reputable company"

So if you are relying on science to choose your investments, you'll need to consider the Facebook misinformation angle. My dad is a retired pharmacist and people still listen to him.

It‚Äôs perennial 50 dollar stock and now with vaccine and travel booming spirit is one of the first to soar. Hence the 1.5 pew market .
Methinks the whole week is a bull run; only because this similar situation happened last week and it went bearish, it'll reverse so we all get stuck with puts

Bear case for PLTR?
Yeah...
$30K isn't enough where op lives to buy a condo or a house. Yes, you can rent but it will be hard to save for a downpayment while you rent. Affordale housing is something we expect to have as an average salary earner in Canada.

Absolutely. Sometimes I intend to hold a position but then the stock blows up afterhours in response to another stock‚Äôs eps. When that happens I‚Äôm exercising to sell the stock in the AM before the stock gets deflated in premarket trading. The banks can fight me to keep their shares up(a few hundred to a couple thousand shares is easy for them to outbid).        

Did you not read my post and see how tight I keep my bid/ask spreads? I‚Äôm not bidding bag money on an otm swing. I‚Äôm paying pennies waiting for that 3%+ swing. If you paid .40 for a $2-3 gain, is it worth exercising? It certainly won‚Äôt hold the value post earnings after 3am, I can tell you that much.
Wat can we do moderna news turning tech red, at least we haven‚Äôt hit negative
I 100% agree my employee stock plan is through e trade and it makes me want to hang myself
Honestly pretty bummed about JD i thought the print wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen until after close.
Since you're asking I doubt you'll do the right choice and pay off your debt. Good luck to you.

why is the pre market showing signs of a dump when vaccine must have lifted it up?

I won't be getting a vaccine. Like no offence I don't care if you get it or not but I won't be taking a vaccine that's only just been produced. My family has had bad luck with vaccines in the past and I'm not risking it. My older brother got vaccinated just before I was born and for some reason it led to him developing a very severe skin condition and similarly severe allergies within a short space of time after the vaccine and he's dealt with it for his whole life. Obviously afterwards my parents chose not to vaccinate me and I'm really not complaining, I think they chose the smart route in case for some reason I developed the same side effects. 

Sometimes there's a valid reason to say no to what may seem like common sense. Not everyone who isn't getting it is scared that Elon Bezos is putting nanobot trackers in the vaccine. Some of us have just seen family members suffer from the side effects and don't want to risk it in case we are also more prone to these side effects.
[deleted]
I bought pfe when their vaccine news was released and I made a quick $400 once the bad news spread about the vaccine
Thx. Nothing else to do with the markets closed. I wish I hadn't divorced my wife. I miss her boyfriends on the weekends.
You're so right. I hate this analogy of 'well it worked so it was smart.' No. Just no.
Marry him then
Damn even with vaccine news and many stocks pumping 20% yet still ppl here talking about NIOüò≥
Another vaccine doubles the supply and reduces time to vaccinate enough folks to reach herd immunity.  Also makes people feel other vaccine candidates will also work.

Right. What I most likely am going to do is pay off the refinanced $50k. Then let the federal student loans remain and make the minimum payment / month (which is very small) so if student loans are forgiven, maybe I can at least get the $10k benefit.

NIO has a bigger market cap than GM, $60B, GM has a profit margin of 3%, ($3B net income on $115B revenue), All these companies have massive  labor costs, materials, plants, transport, etc.  It‚Äôs not like Visa or Microsoft where they can make 20-50% profit on the dollar, will never happen.  manufacturing is hard and reality is gonna set in soon.

Love getting discounted NIO calls in the morning it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre paying me to be rich
Great insight
Noice. Quick suggestion: Needs to be a bit more triangular and kinda tapered at the ends. Also, would have a AMEX platinum card rather than razor blade
I cannot wait for NIO to dip at open, put holders buy more awaiting the 25 PT, and we skyrocket to 50. 

Literally would be the exact inverse of Friday.

This exactly thing happened last Monday
good, down to 41 at one point. we will see how market open looks though, too early to put it in our bank accounts yet
Same bro.  How far out expirations?  I have Jan/June tech calls and Dec SPY puts.
DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT buy them at market open. I'm giving it \~2 hours into market to see how things shake out. Pfizer continued to run up all the way until 12 PM (EST) when they released their news.
Lol. Let‚Äôs see when it falls all the way back to single digit my friend

I think thier earnings will be big. They have a more robust online model than most realize. It's not a boring move just not a buzz word meme stock.
just the regular shenanigans'
So does everything else. That's why collars exist
I don't - it's all a preference by fund. Some funds may want to wait a quarter or two to see how they do as a public company, others may pile in day one. That's the question ...
Don‚Äôt be a bitch NIO bulls you spammed the fuck out of this discussion board we want some fucking NIO loss porn posted even more

i could see pton going to 90 or even 110. depends on how people interpret the mrna news
All in puts
Time to rotate into boomer LEAPS to hedge
Yah. But. At least all you dumbasses gon‚Äô bleed.
Everyone needs to zoom out on NIO and either go long or sell out then buy back later once dip is over.

Bruh, why not give it a month of runway?
The $400MM SPAC (now valued at $700MM) is buying ~10% of the value of Opendoor, not 100%, as founders and prior investors are rolling over substantially all of their ownership.
I hope you‚Äôre rich today
Glad PLTR is fading I can buy more February and March calls
What would make you feel worse; having 15k of student loans to pay off, or not having student loans but losing 15k of hard earned money?

Nio better fucking reverse at open I swear to god
Hey guys not trying to be over optimistic about this but I‚Äôm seeing a reversal similar to 13th pre market on NIO the momentum are also very similar except you have a buy in leading to the pre market which sell off massively within an hour of opening, the currently trend seeing sell off pre market hold even and lower than ema but maintain at 40 level, selling momentum is dying, you could possibly see a buy in at open, predicted the last sell off and everyone got trigger by it lmao.
Already priced in?
Chances PLTR dips hard here?
Imagine if Citron had not released that child level assignment that he spent like 10 mins on. Just imagine
Yep, I have over 4000 calls of US Steel, so I'm hoping that chit goes on a 30 day run here before the holidays. Could make me a happy man.
But do you bang bitches ?
Great entry point!  Hold on for the rip to 60
Mf delayed their launch to the moon cause of covid! Its gonna be dead cat for a month!
the fact that all the indices are up since the start of 2020 only confirms by position that stonks really only go up
The ones that allow for a straight ass fucking right at open.
Just remember guys, you're never late or early. In life you're exactly where you're supposed to be
Rip I sold at top bought back in when I thought we hit the bottom but then it kept going I‚Äôm officially retarded
Shits fading so goddamn quick.

Yep
How the fuck did you predict that?

This is the best part
Imagine thinking that NIO is the only way you can make money in the stock market
Boring earnings week. Ive heard of 5 of these companies
It do go down
This is a DD, forget the mods.
Un-fucking believable. Fuck this market. I have spy puts and tech calls. And of course the exact fucking opposite
Bulls are so smart ü§ì üêÑ
my friend was so bullish because it closed at $45 LOL i sold at $53 and never looked back
this is the way
Biden‚Äôs so old he probably enjoys CCL cruises
what do u mean such a small sample size they did the trial on over 30k people. They split the group in half so half get placebo and half get the actual moderna vaccine out of 30k people 100 or so got the virus and most of them were in the group that received the placebo (sorry i just woke up i haven‚Äôt had a chance to look at the numbers) but that‚Äôs how it works lmao it was a huge sample size
FSR is the new NIO
I‚Äôm a bear I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way.
Baba is gonna rise like Godzilla, we finna tear shit up. Just wait til next month. I doubt it will continue to fall. Fuck CCp

Something like that

The market is not up when qqq is red! Tech is the market.
Seattle hits highest daily new cases of all time, restaurants and indoor gatherings shut down until they re-asses in December. A preview of the rest of the nation over the next 2 weeks?

If you're referencing ANT, I think it was aborted, not miscarried
Proud of you :)
I'd Just set a stop loss at what youre comfortable, but know they don't fire outside of market hours. I lost 60% of my fastly gains because of that.

I think it'll correct to that price before christmas personally, but you'd be 100% up by this time next year regardless of selling or not
Last week I bought SPY 350 Puts and SPY 360 Calls to hedge. Wondering if I should sell the hedge and go into SPY 360 puts at open.

12/04 expiry.
Earnings is tomorrow
All the NIO Bears should Buy Puts before ER tomorrow.

Check back in.
Bears "R Us
You‚Äôre still retarded if you‚Äôre right. If you jump in front of a freight train and you make it to the other side, you‚Äôre still retarded
If you asked everyone, half will say they dont want and will not take the vaccine...at least straight off in the first few month or the first year. So yea its not gonna be a miracle cure anyway. People in the markets are just dumb and acting too soon as if covid vaccin cured the socio-economic problem that are gonna last minimum until 2025.
Some idiots still think NIO is oversold ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I didn‚Äôt mean it was dead like forever right now it‚Äôs a bit overvalued but definitely this is a long time hold . People buying it at 50 are saying stop it‚Äôs already dead cuz they losing money . Not to say it won‚Äôt reach it there eventually. Sorry maybe my post wasn‚Äôt super accurate on what I was trying to say . I bought at 50 btw
Whatever they are memeing fuck if I know I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. NIO doesn‚Äôt seem to be a meme anymore. People taking it too seriously
I can‚Äôt get Dave matthews band out of my head oof
SPCE rescheduled their flight this morning
Itll be a good week for spce

This is it boys. NIO 100c at open expiring in 3 hours to get rich
Thats big brain right there
Fuuuck this. I don't like so much attention to nio ! When u retards are hyped over a stock it tanks
Somebody poke NIO with a stick
You were down 20 on your 100 investment and now 40?!
They canceled their test flight. SPCE bulls fukt.
The storage temp requirement is a huge advantage over Pfizer‚Äôs
Just went long NIO at 41.38, you morons better be right about this hype play
Fade to bout 355 and i can unload these poots k ?
The lower NIO goes, the cheaper those 11/20 60c become
works until it doesn't
We don‚Äôt need to fade today just keep going up sp
Jeez how much are we talking
How are we still talking about NIO? I thought we were finished with it on Friday....
Holy shit bruh. I hope yall fucking joined
I thought they weren‚Äôt supposed to come out with number until tomorrow damn
Spce cancelled a test flight someone said earlier
Printer go brr or my wifes boyfriend gonna make me sleep outside again ... this is the way

Spce is owned by Richard Branson not Elon. You're fucked
Yeah ok but there is PFE, MRNA, and AZN. Did I miss any besides them?
RIP NIO call holders.

The writing was on the wall on Friday and you autists still held over the weekend.
Maybe you should Buy Puts...
Minimum it is going to hammer tech.
AMC is the weirdest stock I've ever held. Tremendous pumping power in pre-market, and crazy volume throughout the day, but a huge inability to squeeze the shorts and actually go up...
Well, yes it is, at least for me. I am a procrastinating bitch when working from home.
Thanks bro
Yall know covid 20 coming out soon right? 

Covid 19 vaccine is going to be useless by January
What this nerd said ^
I'm not sure what positions you guys have but my 11/27 calls will be safe. NIO will be 50 by then

She looks like she drinks a lot of protein shakes.
This stock has had more 10+- % jumps over the past few months than most anything else I watched. I would hardly say boring haha but I‚Äôve been scooping it up every since it was in the $12-13 range knowing someday it would explode on vaccine news. They‚Äôre gonna post a profit for this upcoming quarter too and make it moon even more
[deleted]
There‚Äôs movement. When an option is .01 jumping to .25 or .40 is a huge percentage. In the last week the stock has moved 6.97% or .85. Worth a watch but not sure the percentages are a great indicator on this one. But who knows until someone does some DD
What‚Äôs your position?
I sold at50 and thought id be smart buying at 45 F
Lol mrna such a scammy fuck I swear to god. They aren‚Äôt even peer reviewed and just hoping they get fda emergency use. Puts at open for sure, they‚Äôve been insider selling at fucking $68 up to now. News will come out tomorrow how the ceo sold shares and the word can be shocked again at how it was planned
These NIO losses have me bout to YOLO on AMC... wish me luck
What positions do you have
SOLO not giving a fuck about NIO. Up 5% easy
>Why do people hate stock 90% of people I ask don‚Äôt invest

I think we are getting a little off track here. OP made an anecdotal comment that 90% of people he talked to don't own stocks.   


I commented that personal finance isn't talked about enough at a young age in america and there are a lot of poor people as a reason why that could be.   


Now we are talking about automatic stock purchasing and the pyramid scheme of the modern 401k. = ).   


Either way, best of luck on the battle field today brother.
Huh... looks like i should NOT have fomoed into NIO
Mango is a liar by profession. No worries.

aight after winning and losing some with NIO, what stock do I spend my savings on?
Ugh look at that NIO volume.  My puts are about to get fucking paiddddd.
1 day is like 1 year to all the WSB'ers holding weekly YOLOs
Square is up a billion percent for no reason since March. 

Businesses coming back was the pipe dream they sold you. Most small businesses are in deep shit. If you're down 90% since March, a 100% bounce off the bottom still puts you down 80% from the baseline.
Wait, everyone last night said because SpaceX successfully launched, SPCE would moon...
Really finish off that Kansas corner with a straight down red line
Rev miss
I thought /r/teenagers was a meme/satire sub that died years ago?
Im too late i guess...

u aint black if you:

a) dont buy the nio dip

b) dont short recovery stocks

c) are white

Any love for BABA here? He has been through so much. Abandoned by owner 2 years ago, been working hard and is literally the economy driver for one of the biggest country in the world. Yet ditched by it's master again. Let's not forget about his miscarriaged brother. I'd give him a hug.
Hi guys!  Everyone told me I was retarded for holding NIO puts this weekend. I haven't checked the stock market yet, how is it doing?
Under 41
Qqq is down like .2%. I wouldn‚Äôt call that a dump. Last time vaccine news broke, it was down 2% pm
moderna's cold storage requirements are much leaner than pfizer's fucking -80c requirement. its built to scale and can be put into literally any cold storage facility like americold's or lineage's. its literally meant to be available for everyone and not just for first world countries. that's what making it sell.
How are we up almost 2% lmao market is on Molly
Charge your phone, Jesus Christ
I wonder who bought cruises at the top lmao

Are there any other vaccine pumps in store or has this vaccine rally been exhausted?
I might never make much but also don‚Äôt lose much win/win
Will the 10 year above 1% tank equities?

I would tend to agree except for things like lobbying  exist. I wouldn't necessarily say that companies "don't care", they care very very much about the political climate. However, whether or not this is driving any news or developments is definitely debatable.
Amen
Not one bit
NIO is down because it‚Äôs Monday morning beginning of the week and has been no 11/20 call purchases. I think what drove the run last week was several call purchases, causing MM to hedge with a shit ton of stock purchase. It will only run if there‚Äôs big volume on calls during the week. Last week was a big run because of huge 11/13 call volume which was probably from this group alone. That‚Äôs basically the formula for every meme stock pump. Autist‚Äôs load up on calls, MM hedges with big stock purchases, which drives the price way up.
Dow Bulls in danger today ; oil moving up
NIO still dropping premarket, making me nervous.
Lol
just open the fucking market already
This comment makes no sense. For one, futures allow institutions to hedge risk over their desired time horizon (something ETFs alone don‚Äôt). Additionally, if you‚Äôre referring to ETFs that attempt to track the underlying product, such as the USO ETF, that ETF simply rolls out prior to each expiration period before settlement (i.e., futures are still being traded).
why the fuck did I hold on NIO...
Me and the bois gonna inject both pfizer and moderna vaccines for an easy 2-bagger immune system
I would cream
what's the story with this one? I'd like to get a few

Only half the locked-out shares were extended.

Why this market rally isn‚Äôt overextended at all
Good shit man grats. And of course fuck you!
Set a stop loss at a point where you don‚Äôt lose any capital or at a point you still capture profit if it goes down to an uncomfortable level.
got this one...thanks
I‚Äôd rather stare at a screen and see a blurry reflection of this...ü§°
NIO greatly oversold tbh
Reposted from last Friday:

"To all the NIO holders out there, just know that we have all been there. You don't wanna sell but you know you should. You'll hold over the weekend and tell yourself it will be ok while deep down knowing that it won't be.

Monday hits and the depression kicks in. "I should have sold" you will tell yourself. So you sell. Then on Tuesday it rallies to new highs"

Good luck NIO boys, don't do anything stupid.  Remember, life is worth living.
Like fuck I would. I‚Äôve seen it coming since March, and I already lost every penny of my TRUMP BUX predicting the crash. Never should have fought the fed.

I personally think this company will be a winner, but over 1 to 2 years. Probably a decent correction is inbound in the short term. I'm planning on selling my shares tuesday for some profit, then buy back in in the 30's or high 20's, which is a realistic correction imo

I can‚Äôt believe you did this just for us. Thank you
I don't think so, its already priced in. Up already 28% Inna week.
Entire GI tract, think of it like an ETF and the individual organs are the holdings LMAO
As always, fade to red for open then buy calls and watch them slowly grow throughout the day
I think it‚Äôs currently overvalued and the odds of a good earnings report isn‚Äôt great. They are still a tiny company with tons of competitors. Sure there is upside but it is far from guaranteed
and better.
moderna pump has almost been completely wiped out. sell the noose event.
PLTR 18 EOD you heard it here :)
It's still up almost %1 over the last week. And over 2000% this year.

Thank God. Sick of that shit. I sold calls on the rip to.fund my puts but didn't drop enough. Will now though now that my puts have expired.

Look at what happened to JETS the day after Pfizer. There's always a huge pump then a clawback on news like this. I'd wait a day or two.
man this whole time I thought SOLO was the cup company
Boring play, but JWN is paying my mortgage. With how badly it kept getting beaten down post rona, cheap calls were free money with patience.

There ain't shit to understand about it. Has nothing to do with financials or anything. People see better opportunities elsewhere in the market right now and that money has to come from somewhere.
Sell everything else you own. Buy lots more shares and calls on NIO. Make sure a retarded amount of them are short term OTM. Refresh your browser obsessively and maniacally over a period of weeks while you ignore your family and your job and you wake up every night at 3 am in cold sweats wondering WTF is wrong with you. Lose a terrifying % of your portfolio after the Citron note, then bag-hold through earnings tomorrow, gambling the  rest of your account on the increasingly thin glimmer of hope that a pop tomorrow morning will save you, knowing full well that even if one happens, FOMO will prevent you from selling and you'll bag hold those fuckers the rest of the way down until everything crashes and burns.

I don't know if this helps you with your 10 shares but that's the plan over on this end. 

God Speed, young Autist.
Def consider selling, it isn't that competitive with non-covid drug companies. In my opinion, Astrazeneca is the only one to hold shares in longterm because their drug line-up is fantastic and they have an o.k dividend

There was this secluded bathroom in the school of engineering basement I would go to everyday after getting raped by an 8am differential equations class. It was 8 years ago and I still remember what was scrawled on the wall:

"Relax. It's poopin time"
Buy TSLA calls. It is currently up with the Nasdaq down. Whenever this happens, it begins a new uptrend.

^NIO ^gang ^in ^shambles.
They dumping right now - pump
Over
Positive vax news again taking SQ down with tech, but I think it's a buying opportunity. Did everyone forget their bread and butter is small business in person transactions? When everyone is vaxxed up and back at their favorite food truck that's a boost for SQ. Market getting it wrong.
Gross
mrna
I hedged my BABA with airlines. When do I receive my CFA? üòé
I'm gonna be down an unhealthy amount at open.  This vaccine is killing me.
Well obviously the responsible answer is buy back in.
IV crush, I played it last week, made like 100$ on 3 puts! Not worth it
nice we getting the dump now so we go up intraday
$6.2k in my smallstreet bets account. 3 more paychecks this year. $15k left on my car loan. We're almost there boys.
Covid-19 is over.. now Covid-21, that's another story.
Nobody wants to ply solo with iv crush through the roof
let‚Äôs fly boys. time to get airline positions or is it already baked in with pfizer news from earlier last week?
Not what he means
lol, are you a degen or just dumb. this whole sub idolizes that idiot.
Underrated post
Pls bring JD with it
I took 13k to 4K. Now what
Because there is no way they would deliver that in 2021
Remember when WSB followed the stock picks of a lizard and a dog shitting in a backyard?  Good times...
to be fair its most likely this small sub on reddit... normies dont know shit about NIO and never will until its worth about $200/share.
Yeah u gotta play probabilities based on Vax price action last week. Same day same pattern probably over the week
Its not exactly a menu item but knowing the degenerates on this forum, straws.  üòÅ
Amen
My calls hope so
Attaboy!
As in they think it will fade
For what?
Spy fading
A big NOPE right there.
Yeah seems like could be too soon for vaccine news of this degree, if I were to take this trade I would try to take it at the high of the day IMO I wouldn‚Äôt at market open would wait 30 min to 1 hour
Easy just buy stonks üöÄ
60M or so people buying shares weekly on a completely automated basis is nothing to sneeze at. Considering an even smaller proportion ever even take an hour to review it outside of the annual meeting with the accountant, it is a whole bunch of buying.
Those Moderna insiders going to sell more of their stock today!
BABA gonna moon today right fellas?
Well there‚Äôs your problem lol
Spirit gonna be 25 by tomorrow . Do with it as you will
I scroll for 10 seconds and don‚Äôt see a NIO post
I did last week. It'll be fine long term
The bid / ask on those calls were fucked and super low volume if I remember correctly
Ass
Don't doubt your vibe.
But why tho ?
Also, what is Modernas exposure to anz kind of vaccination program?

Thez might have a vaccine and a trial, but do they really get the contracts?  
Also, can they sell it at a profit when the governments are involved.

All of this is very speculative to me.  
So, I certainly would not be too optimistic.
Congrats! Have a good week
Lol so last week we had Pfizer vaccine pump and this week moderna is stepping in PM just to screw the bears over

Yea, no. They've got this thing and it‚Äôs fucking golden, and, they're just not giving it up for fuckin‚Äô nothing. Covid-21 will be coming to a theater near you. This time it's personal.

Vaccine -> their main customer, which are small businesses are coming back

Crepto hype -> continues to drive growth of cash app

Mega trend -> mobile payment and cashless transactions

so I dont understand why SQ is getting sold off aswell, the growth from the last two quarters didnt come because of covid but because of their general growth especially in cash app.

But honestly idk what the distribution of people buying 3090s for ML/AI / engineering modelling purposes vs gaming. 

You gotta admit being an ML engineer makes you kind of an exception rather than the rule I was trying to make. 

And that is... the casual hobbyist gamer typically doesn‚Äôt shell out top dollars for what‚Äôs basically marketed as a top quality / luxury brand for hardware. 

Especially since the memory manufactures are more or less the same handful, and Corsair just slaps their cooling case on it. Occasional a tweak for over clocking purposes.

Why are you all flapping about NIO? The stock has strong fundamentals but has risen too much in a short period of time. This is a normal correction. Don‚Äôt sell at the bottom please just wait a week and see your money come back.
Judging by what happened after the PFE pump, everything that goes up today will crash right back down in like 2 days max.

I don‚Äôt use robinhood I use E*TRADE but that‚Äôs beside the point. Why would you rather exercise your option to sell pre market versus selling the option before close? Unless your strategy is that the shares will gap up more often than not, in which case you make more money on the gap up than you lost in premium? Lately large premarket moves have been common I would give you that. But if your whole idea is that shares are highest at 430am why not just short the stock at 430 with your call as collateral and cover your short at open or whenever it is you see fit? Why lose the premium on the option, unless it‚Äôs deep ITM with very little extrinsic value?
We‚Äôre going to end up flat as shit today.
Yeah, that's just not true
Ha I feel the same with my tech heavy positions.
It might be a Hot Wheels yacht, but it‚Äôs mine.
should‚Äôve got in friday before close

The earnings run up was last week? Looks like it‚Äôs recovering, though.

Have you seen their car?

That‚Äôs just foil covered in leprechaun shit
Thank you, well said
Biden literally has never said that.  One member of his Covid team Dr. Osterholm said he though 4-6 weeks could solve it.  But if 70 million Americans don‚Äôt believe in lock downs and the previous president and Dr Atlas will 100% encourage violence in response to lockdowns. While a 4-6 week shutdown would help, it won‚Äôt happen due to politics and crazy people

Puts on this guys understanding of vaccine production
Wanting people to die so your puts will print? Yeah that's bad.
Was gonna wait to buy the dip sir. If there is one
Arrrrrrrrrrgh, don't be so mean to us. We be trying to get that booty too.
Yes keep saying stuff like this and it will surely go down
Wut?
What‚Äôs wrong with Nautilus nowadays?
NIO is overbought, there are other china ev plays with better value
You‚Äôre a dumbass.
NIO PM found the bottom
Do chicken tendies and you'll make bank in this sub.
Not even a joke. Congress doesn't care about the average Joe who lost his wage, they only care about the millions they have in stock

You got 9 contracts bro, I don‚Äôt think that qualifies you for a yacht
likely after what people saw happen with PFE last week
Idk man, long term oil for struggling companies sounds risky. I still have PTSD from Chesapeake oil going under
probably, should be down by EOD
With the amount of pre orders they already have the company is worth more than $6 a share. Wether it‚Äôs a stupid car or not they have a plan and they are implementing it.
Think it's more just money allocation and sector rotation.

When people with a lot of money say 'cash out of tech and into travel/tourism/entertainment/manufacturing/retail' they're not really concerned about which stocks to pull out of. They want the liquidity.

Don't get me wrong -- Apple will always be a great stock to hold onto, but in market events like this it's caught in the crossfire.
All I wanted today was to be able to get in to airlines and pltr for cheap. But no, MRNA had to go swinging it‚Äôs dick around the premarkets
Yah. 200 by 2030. But will crash after earnings.

NIO call holders not feeling so well lol, it's fun to see.
yea
[deleted]
you bet the whole house with the 6 puts you bought. much conviction
Tradestation via Monex in Japan but it should be available in USA too. GTC+ trades available at no extra charge and I've never had it go down ever, even when everyone on here is shitting the bed about Robinhood or Webull or whatever crashing.
This is a clear sign from god
baba stronk
Idk man 370 by eod at this rate

Just switch to way otm calls and get rich
They don‚Äôt have the production or distribution to get the vaccine to 300 million+ as soon as it‚Äôs approved. Death numbers will keep going up for months after they start distributing it
Are you... what. How can you be this dumb. Two vaccines announces and you buy puts on the industry people are dying to go do
You know they‚Äôre literally the biggest vaccine beneficiary?
cuz of xi
Why?
Tech stabilising or is it only holding flat til market open?
Weak open Red to green action on NIO looking juicy this morning
Yes. And it's an enclosed ev motorcycle btw.
WTI crude is one of the products with physical delivery though which is precisely why it went negative. There was literally not enough space in Cushing.
Puts on Apple at open? Looks like tech going nose dive again.
obviously
Can¬¥t make this shit up...
Vaccine is effective, the world doesn‚Äôt need tech anymore
Buy puts, some ecologist will make a big deal of it and call for airport to be shutdown or some shit.
NIO gonna hit +10 mil volume pre market.

ZADDY
Looks like our SPY puts are fuk this week :( oh well
Sold my TECH stocks (AMZN / FB / GOOG)

Bought boomer stocks (DOW)
Sign of what‚Äôs to come
I've bought the top since July.   Continuing to do so.
RIP nadaq
VACCINECONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCTTT
we have more dumb people and more smart people than anywhere in the world, its a beautiful thing
Is it bad I don‚Äôt want there to be a vaccination
Word thanks for the advice
How‚Äôs the NIO pre-market party going? Lol
Based on your childish post I have absolutely zero confidence in your technical analysis.
Tried that last week on NCLH, nothing really happened... It got down to about $19.50 but was continually propped up, unexpectedly
Just hold the fuckers
Always has been üî´üë®üèº‚ÄçüöÄ

Spy is beyond retarded
I‚Äôm having a seizure watching FSR pre market
Whatthup!! Ith ya boy thimpu!!
Time to sell Moderna shares or hold long?
source? Might have said that in context of this year March-August timeframe.

At this point I think most people are in agreement to not do another full lockdown. Close the things that are high-risk (RIP restaurants, theaters, gyms), wear masks, limit gatherings.
Hahahaha 

No.
Hold it‚Äôs going over $100 next yesr

Why the fuck is JD down
Saw an article last week somewhere. Vaccine talks going well.
I guess so. It‚Äôs on a nice rip right now. I‚Äôll take a ride for a day or two and see where it ends up. Also want some KCAC.
Agreed
Source?
look at last weeks roadmap. if we follow the same you have until about noonish until tech starts burning
Puny Stay-at-home stocks
So you are going by‚Äùbuy high sell low‚Äù quote, right?! Got it
puts on amc üòé time to see it die again after the pump
Imagine not just buying SPY calls at literally every dip at this point
Yeah they had Amazon Fresh years ago which was very expensive and I doubt most people ever tried it. For the past few years I‚Äôve been getting Whole Foods delivered with Prime for free if I choose the flexible delivery windows (2 hour range versus 1 I believe)

They do run out of things for sure
What are we making money on today drop yours plays for open
Oh okay üëå
i wouldn't dump it today.. i'd wait until vaccine hype fades.. tech may have a bad couple days until we hit 200k cases.. you may want to get out of that at a strategic time to avoid a majority % loss.. I'm a big believer in TDOC and institutions like it too.. Cathie Wood adds to positions all the time, she's been a buyer of late at its current price.
I have 10 shares in NIO. What should I do with them today?
It's easy in your 30s... In fact, I think it's considerably easier. At 31, I know exactly who I am, and I know what women like more from every angle.
All 2021. Will be out of the singles on any big up day and will hold the spreads for a while.
Down 4% and retards think its dead haha
I think this excludes r/porn
Flight already delayed. Looks like it is dropping.
I hope so only so I gain losses back
Why's nobody mention brk.b here? The bad boy has been steadily marching up these last 3 months.
Airlines bitches!!!!
I‚Äôm just trying to understand exactly what all these ‚ÄúNIO $100 by end of week ‚Äú idiots are basing their hope on.
I very much would like to buy puts on BA at open.
That's why Natty is red this morning.
puts on cruises on open has to be the play, surely?
im gonna have to sell some puts today
SOLO
No, they said they would not pursue one
Russia about to come out and revise the report on their vaccine to be 96.5% effective.
Just watch out for gas price recovery. Inflation gonna hit you in the mouth. At that point, you'd better hope we are at full emoloyment, otherwise all of this printing will get expensive in a hurry.

NIO not looking so good... ug
Don't copy me! I don't think QQQ is going to drop enough to cover my losses on my AMD leap :(

Looks like I would have been better off buying calls on any recovery stock instead of SQQQ.
dont feel bad for them. they were warned not to fuck around with chinese stocks
[deleted]
I have some of that too :)
What are your gains?
200-400 with a hint of volatility
You all alone in these streets cousin üôéüèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Still easy to bang them, but they're not as readily available as they once were
There also has been significant share dilution to raise capital.  Something like 70% more NCLH shares, 33% more CCL shares.
I googled what one of those solo cars looked like oooft. its a trike!

Every time oil goes over $40, buy XOM puts. 100% win rate so far
I think you're not giving op enough credit.  I think he can do it in 24 hours.
Yes.  Duh.  That‚Äôs why the stock is losing value left and right.  Just finally correcting.
Apparently it's immune to the vaccine pump.

Bought immediately at open when PFE news dropped
These freaking vaccine pumps.

Mun or bust!
it's bear hunting season. Get daddy's rifle.
Everyone saying SPY puts are fucked gives me hope that my 354P 11/18 will be fine. Inverse WSB
Comming from cripto a 10% correction woudnt mean much to me since i entered the coin market on days where volitility was so high it had several 20% up or down days each week.

In general stock markets this is probably a huge deal
[deleted]
Why? They report something?
it'll go up just watch
Amazon grocery service free? It absolutely was not where I was. It was money every month not included with prime. I guess it changed. Still botched every delivery tho.
It‚Äôs a buy. I‚Äôm adding to my position
It helps when it's fake too. I wouldn't get too cocky, cause the "real" one is coming when they send out the Covid-21. Just saying.

Shhh it‚Äôs ok... I am too
It does this every morning. Did you stay up all night making this meme? ü§£
Why's that?
Jebus...
Honestly a vaccine is not actually bad for the techs, it‚Äôs just that iNvEsToRs rotate out of it because they see better chances elsewhere so the demand for tech stocks is less, thus the price drops. Things like that is a good moment to add to techs, because their business is not hurt by a vaccine. It‚Äôs a Wall Street mechanism, not a Main Street mechanism
Pay the minimum monthly.  Take out another loan but buy calls with it.  Have your lambo and both loans paid off in a year.

Of course they would release double vaccine news in 2 weeks
Whichever pharmaceutical saleswoman bribes your doctor is the one he'll hawk to you.
is the market gonna go down?
CCL has issued more stonks twice since that and diluted the value, though. But who cares, value is still only third of what it was pre-covid. BUY! And well, most people don't even know what dilution of stonk value means... Still, I'm going to sell some naked calls today for all the cruise lines! :)
Spce buy order is openüòéüëç
What diffcalculus said
Maybe because it was bought more... ü§Ø
Vaccine is 95% effective, so CCL will only have to keep five ICUs per 100 boomers allowed onboard.

Obviously bullish
Not yet but I saw everyone talking about it. Just gonna ride the wave for a lil bit.

I am not familiar with hong kong way, but Singapore is amazing for their citizen.

Good job, she's ugly. So you failed at another thing.
That's an embarassing comment
NIO holders get rekt lol
Someone tell me my SHOP 2/19 1000c is safe...
just remember fellas, when we have a vaccine next year everything is going immediately back to normal as if COVID never happened, there is definitely zero chance that consumer behavior will have changed, also the recession will immediately disappear, taxes will not increase, and all the debt people/gov loaded up on will also disappear.

Companies have no reason to really ever bring office workers back into the office unless the head honcho is a micro managing prick. Why buy expensive commercial leases when you can have your employee front 90% of the costs? Where's the benefit to having an office? I save hours of my day not commuting and getting ready. I can do shit when work isn't busy.

Damn fat fingers! Turns out I bought AMD when I should've bought AMC
No, America does a great job of ensuring that billions of shares are purchased weekly via 401k contributions. Then, money managers convince people to never sell, only buy. 

That, children, is why stocks only go up.

What? Why
Back to back vaccine pumps over weekend

15% hype 15% luxury, maybe 70% tech. 

Half the guys who buy into tech probably understands just the tip of the iceberg with respect to the technology.  

Eg. Plenty people who can‚Äôt explain the diff between AWS/ Azure business models but will circle jerk to buzz words like cloud, big data , computing, maths! 

Will none the less buy MSFT/ AMZN.

Agreed. Pay off those loans brother !
Buy QQQ calls about 2 hours after open.  Tomorrow the market will realize that COVID is raging out of control and that the vaccine won't be able to break the Pandemic until well into 2021 due to supply chain/production limitations.  Still a long way to go.
They did on the big, big jump, didn't they? Weren't they screaming red with the covid stocks as Visa/Mastercard rocketed with banks?
If I lose money on SOLO this week I blame you guys. Let‚Äôs do this!!!

This stonk is going up
You exercise your options aftermarket and sell the stock premarket at 4:30 et. If you‚Äôre assuming everyone uses robinhood, you‚Äôre stupid af. There‚Äôs the ‚Äúread the rules‚Äù portion in the guidelines. Robinhood is the only one that fucks you over on exercising options prices which is why some people won‚Äôt keep large amounts of money in there.
They give half of them a placebo and half of them the real deal and they wait for a certain number of them to get covid. No one knows what they got. Then they check out of all the people that got covid, how many of them were placebo group people and how many got the real vaccine.

There‚Äôs alot of statistical power analysis that goes into ensuring that the result isn‚Äôt accidental or derived from other factors.

I‚Äôm about to get clapped since my portfolio is mostly wfh lol BUT I am happy there is yet another vaccine and I do believe data.
I looked at MRNA for 5 weeks and thought, yeah I should buy that soon because even if something else gets some approval or news it will pump

Well did i? ofc not
Here we go with another vaccine trial tech sell off. 

Tech ain't slowing down and neither is COVID for two quarters

So buy the dip F****ts
They have lots of debt and bad management. Time and time again they have been shown to be inefficient.
I think most people associate with the imagery shown in movies like wolf if wall street. Living to excess, being a "bro" etc. I know there's a deep mistrust in the millenal generation(I'm a millennial). Most likely because they've witnessed the 2008 market crash and subsequent bank bailout under Obama. Maybe the thinking is that at any moment they could lose all their money, what little they have, and no one's coming to bail them out. Just thoughts.
Well the ones it matters for have pumped hard, ie. travel. All money has moved out from covid proof stonks to travel.
Right ok. But you never know.

It could bounce. I would sell it today tbh. The theta alone will screw you

Smart man.
I personally think its due to the lack of education in it at an early age and in gradeschool, and so it has a stigma of being "complicated" with the new vocabulary it brings that nobody has been exposed to. I didn't become interested until grad school because I had no exposure to investing as a child and my parents never really talked finances. I know I missed out on years of gains, just by not holding shares, and I dont wanna be in that position ever again.
So in China, Red is for positive stocks and Green For negative? So weird

I can personally attest that Starbucks is in in trouble. I know a couple of girls who work there all different locations.

Even when they do get a good rush it‚Äôs not nearly as much as it used to be. One girl even had her raise she was getting cancelled. You know it‚Äôs bad if the company cannot afford to give a dollar more per hour to a loyal worker of 3 years at fast food chain.

Got out of NIO last Thursday making a smart play then immediately made a retard play, still came out ahead. Glad I didnt stick around for earnings chaos crapshoot
I‚Äôm excited cause PLTR is up too.
Congrats man
I'll take the vaccine of any company that didn't try to hawk hydroxychloroquine thx

Glad I grabbed a bunch of CCL $20c weeklies for this MRNA vaccine rumor, as a lottery play. They were 0.01 last week. Only got 100 though ‚òπÔ∏è
If you dont know what you are doing then i recommend you watching peter lynch on youtube and learn something
what if he 2x 2 more times? Isn't it like you only need to 2x 100 7 times then you have 1M?
Rest in shambles. CCP don‚Äôt play no shit.
Oh shit, what a wild week ahead. 

Does this one need to be stored at absolute zero like the German vax?
Gonna buy puts tomorrow for travel tbh lol easy ass money AGAIN....
Why SPCE dumping? Was gonna wheeel it but idk now
Forever?
Made 300% last week and I'm gonna make the same with these $17.5 calls.
Congrats!
I think people actually know. Like CCL was at $23 in June, now it's $18 on this "jump". So basically they were MUCH more bullish in June than with two effective vaccines in the pipeline. So.. that tells you these companies are fucked.
Ain't no better feeling than getting to the gym and being able to lift more today than you were able yesterday

Well the point is if *everyone* gets the vaccine then the odds of you getting infected is drastically lower since 95% of the people you interact with aren't exposed.

90/95% efficacy is actually pretty insane. Flu vaccines are like 60%.

This is why anti-vaxxing is dangerous and selfish.

If 20 people get the vaccine only one will not be affected, but they'll mingle with 19 people who were positively affected and therefore don't have it.

The more anti-vaxxers means more people who are susceptible which means they're also exposing those who were among that 5%.

So if among those same 20 people only 15 get the vaccine, including you, and it 'doesn't work' on you, there are 5 people out there who aren't protected at all and could share it. You go from 100% sure to not get it in the crowd to being far more likely to get it.

Anti-vaxxing has never been more of a problem than for COVID. If people want to get back to normal we need people to get the vaccine when it's available.
Just today, then it will bleed for a week

So are we going to be able to choose which vaccine to get like at a McDonalds drive thru?
So just like last week, this vaccine pump will fade quickly.
If you have 1000 people contracted with covid and out of these 50 were vaccined and the rest placebo, okay, 94.5% rate is plausible

but how can you say that with 5 people out of 95? Sample site is so small, one person more in vaccine group changes the result by a lot
I did the same but sadly on ps4 :( Didn't manage to get a ps5.

I'm confident it will be where I want it by the end of the week. Not a pop but a slight rise.
Literally saying that the 13F documents posted by the big guys are not what they appear due to the fact that the money they have in options is notional value. Thus the 13F they are releasing is not 100% accurate because notional is different than market value.

Tl;dr

13F are bullshit, the big guys are inflating their value.

If the contract is worth $40 for an option, the stock is $3, the notional value is $300.
It's a megacap with a legit business lol

No I just have a few shares, most of my money is somewhere else.
Im gonna go ahead and inverse WSB sentiment
?
Most likely another sell the news event, but with so many yokels betting on a double üåàüåà, the only winning bet is SPY 0dte calls at open.

Yeah, tried that with PFE and got burned. MRNA‚Äôs vac wayy awesomer apparently
NIO is so yesterday. Now PLTR is the hot stock. Don't be caught bag holding/slipping
Washington state is not the whole world

What? Who does that? You don‚Äôt make any sense. Who is buying your options premarket there is no options market outside of RTH unless you‚Äôre talking about futures contracts? And why would you exercise an option early and forego the remaining premium unless you maybe wanted to have the shares for a dividend or needed to cover a short position? None of what you are saying makes sense to me and I‚Äôm not retarded so I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre just full of shit
Thats a really good guess. Im not entirely sure what he was trying to imply but this sounds right
Get in this morning on NIO, it won‚Äôt go below 40, will be 60 after ER
With people jumping ship from NIO and Tesla opening the largest supercharging station in the world on the 14th, the successful launch is just icing on the cake.

The flight got delayed. Will crash short term.
[deleted]
Who should I ask
Yes, it will only be removed if NIO go up bigly
NIO major support at 40 if you see this level break she going down for sure, the pre market are bouncing off the bottom band vwap but is either align with the ema or lower, not a good sign. We need heavy volume to buy in at open or else she be 45 at best EOD
TD Ameritrade about to shit itself again.
Plays for today my nio calls are dead need a lotto ticket

Weird way to lose all your money
Wish I had bought more TSN calls.
Well last week the pump lasted 3 days
Too late.
Agreed. I will probably buy more for sure..QE going to be off the hook..I have a while still! (Gulp)
I might buy zm shares. My work scrambled to pay them anything when zm done with free lunches. Monopoly and laziness of switch here
Moderna vaccine 95.7% effective and can be stored at close to room temp or something like that
Why is SPCE down? I thought it was going to the moon üåô

Nothing we havent seen before lol
BABa recovering. FB is meh. But rest of my portfolio is green. Wish I bought more financials on last weeks dip
Hi, is this the way?
Yep
6% in a vaccine tells you how strong this is
Haha someone's mass downvoting. Found the guy who bought puts on Friday. Yikes.
They dont like money
Oh I see, Saunta Claus came to Wall Street ;)
You‚Äôre asking the wrong people

How about those that bought shares at $12 and sell OTM weeklies to fags?
NVDA 580-600c 11/20, ZM 430c mid/late december, BA leaps, AMZN leaps
America does a really bad job at educating people about personal finance.

Also lots of people are living paycheck to paycheck.
is the short seller rule on for NIO pre-market?
ATVI & AMD calendar spreads (short december/long january) - AMD 2022 leaps 75c - Lowes vertical spreads earnings play, SQQQ calls - DGRO/XLRE shares
Well then I‚Äôll just go fuck myself won‚Äôt I.
Wynn and sbux gonna blast off this week boys. Get in or get fuk

Are MRNA calls free money at this point?
Was there some vaccine news?
Europe shutting down big homie
30k people.
95 got covid, 90 received placebo
Moderna puts at open.
Uber is now almost at 50 say sike right now ü§°
Aye aye captain
PFE does their vaccine production in house, so PFE controls the entire process
The exact same thing happened last Monday so I‚Äôm expecting lots of selling at open.
Imagine being this broke ass and holding calls on nio ü§°
Thank God my NIO shares have no expiry date
WSB has gotten to Yahoo message boards level of awful shit posting.
The more it's mentioned here.

The more I feel like perhaps I should dump it
Bottom 42.49?
No one said it had to be logical also Asia was major green because they had a massive trade deal we were not invited to.
Isn‚Äôt that what fortune tellers and astrology do? SSDD.
$NIO fucked you? Try $INO instead
I‚Äôm diversified with INTC calls who knew?
PLEASE NIO DIP I WANNA SEE ALL THESE WSB NOOBS GET FUCKED PORN HUB NEW SCARLET STYLE
Nio is chinese, BMW isn't.  China will always build up its own to replace foreigners.
we're talking about cruisers mu'tard
its 30,000 people dumbass
Why do people hate stock 90% of people I ask don‚Äôt invest
Yeah I‚Äôm sensing LI and XPEV are less likely to crater. At this price point I think sideline money will join in.
Emergency distribution to frontline/healthcare workers is probably within a few weeks, and with two strong vaccines looking good to go an initial distribution probably isn't far off.

This should be another open pump then a drift back to tech, but as we get closer to an actual vaccine distribution investors will want to be sure they aren't holding the bag.
Just remember today that everyone saw what happened last week with the Monday pump and then bleed back 

So it likely won‚Äôt go the same way
[deleted]

[deleted]
Lmao absolutely they would
Lmao
Mbp 16 sounds like a jet. Intel i9 garbage
Same type: mRNA. Diff methods in the finer details of the vaccine though.
Buying some more NIO 11/20 60c at open this morning, thanks for the cheap calls NIO
What if I went straight down to -85%?
by safe you mean you're fucking retarded then yes

Tech is only falling because all you idiots have calls and have to sell because of theta decay

I'm in shit so boomer that it doesn't get any action premarket.
Why

Pre market on fire fellas. Get in and out before the markets open!
I really hope ppl aren‚Äôt 100% long tech. Be a boomer & throw dow in there at least
Yolo positions?
so instead of faking loan applications they‚Äôre faking financials this time around ? What do we big short this time ? Are they hiding their losses in foreign subsidies?
If it tanks really hard I don‚Äôt mind investing and buying shares
its not going to be rejected, they are going to rush this through
Should I close my 11/27 UVXY calls for a huge ass Rapin today or should I hold?
Is it safe to buy cruises at open.?

At least nio is red !! YES !!
ZM earnings is in 2 weeks fire sale I say
That's why it will pop
First female black president is the WOKEST!
Don‚Äôt worry. Once you all rotate to all the boomer stocks. The suits will sell them to you and dump it. Then go back to tech lol.
When‚Äôs the last time you dusted your air vents? Also, what‚Äôs running? Unless your mac is super old, you shouldn‚Äôt be hearing jet engines. Source: both my work MacBook and my home MacBook (from ~2016) run just fine unless I‚Äôm doing something that is actually computationally expensive.
The dip and rebound has happened every week for the last 3 weeks. Sure, this could be the week it doesn't rebound, but that's why NIO is only 25% of my portfolio rather then the 75% 2 weeks ago.
When RH restricts me, I hope they see I transfer all my money out. Fuck yo shitty platform.
Lol dude who the fuck you talking to? We in the truman show? I‚Äôm still up, üíéü§ö motherfucker you can suck my big bull cock
This. Selling some AMD calls at open for a lost. Always enter with a plan and stick to it. Also have a stop loss
RIP my tech calls.
üôè
Best looking hedge fund manager
Smuguh
Rip my zm calls
Shares sure but calls? Feels to early to buy calls it just started dipping
Tech already recovering.  So much for a buying a dip today.
By this time next year they will have half as much usage as they do today and everyone knows it
Imagine selling Nio now before ER ü§°
I don‚Äôt think this is gonna be like last Monday. tech futures sank pretty hard last week after news hit but today it‚Äôs already recovering.
[deleted]
Definitely buy Calls cuz their glitchy 737 MAX is about to get approved for flying again.....buy Puts for all the ones that are gonna fall out of sky again.

LMFAO Monday pump Tuesday dump incoming for the millionth time

The puts I sold are deep OTM so I‚Äôm chilllin too but I hate to see red pre-market
This is just disingenuous
JNJ vaccine pump next Monday. Plan accordingly
If you think tech will be less profitable even after vaccine hits and covid dissappears, youre delusional.
BABA holding strong

the stonk of champions
Oh man with red tech WSB is gonna be hilarious today.
PLTR 100 EOM
I never understand those that buy in the middle of a rally but don‚Äôt buy the dip
NIO Boutta break out again, look at this fucking bull flag
You mean you don‚Äôt listen for small details in porn with high end gear?
ZM three fiddy
Good. Hope Xpev follows.
Remember less than 12 hours ago when everyone was screaming bloody murder for BABA and now it‚Äôs flat af and no one cares. This sub is a couple smart people and thousands of sheep
Thinking of just going in and holding long term tbh.
Operation No down days allowed!
Indeed :(
Buy low today sell higher tue
I have 45p for this Friday.
Congrats ICLN call holders
[removed]
Or down
Would be cool
[deleted]
That‚Äôs already  priced in
Unfortunate they cancelled their manned flight this week glad I did not go all in on them lol.
Probably right
Bought weeklys Friday.  11/20 101c will not  üßª üôå these will print
Every new day we near EUA and the beginning of distribution, the temp issue with PFE is a big deal, but that can be overcome if you throw enough money at it. Believe it or not, the market is forward thinking.
Maybe in the far off future but short term I think its too early to call
FB with PE ratio of 31 is a steal.
üëç appreciate the motivation !
AMD benefits from Covid hahahaha
NIO dips never disappoint.
Are we thinking PLTR is going to have a parabolic day?
NIO bagholders will refuse to eat a loss because of pride, or severe aversion to losing any money.  They keep telling themselves that the rebound will happen.  2 weeks later instead of eating a 10% loss, they're now 50-60% in the hole.  

Learn to eat your losses when you have to.
I‚Äôm not worried, perfect time to load up on some more shares/calls
[deleted]
Yes this Friday I purchased $40p for 0.96 how about you?
Gonna double down on calls üò°
She‚Äôs cute. Not like smoke show cute, but if she could get it.
Not necessarily at open, but above 361 at close I will unless SPY closes at 363.5ish or higher. 361 seems a more likely target.
Bro I fucking wish
TDOC is getting scooped up now it‚Äôs so oversold
Buying opportunity for NIO today. Earnings day will be 30% green
VIX starting to look cheap but... i dont really see it popping off anytime soon.. the reopening optimism trade is back no way to fight this shit
[deleted]
I dunno what an inverse guh is, but that's what I'm feeling watching my moderna calls just smash through my breakeven point and keep going.
I'm going long with $100K shares then gonna check out of reality for a few years.
Crash & burn NIO
Don‚Äôt go all in at open... scale in as there might be some profit taking at open or shortly after
Zoom üò≠
Yes I'm gonna go 20 calls further out
people for whom $1200 is literally nothing
LI might actually be bigly green this week.
DNKN order was paid for by customer in front of me.

Pay off the loans
I dont think your puts would be printing at -0.04%
Because I‚Äôm a paper handed bitch, I turned off options. Gave myself 5k more to day trade shares. I think PLTR for now.
this vaccine pump is the new stim talks going well. My spy calls aren‚Äôt complaining though, wish I had gotten mrna debit spreads though, just didn‚Äôt know when they‚Äôd release info
Everybody and their mum has a 90% efficacy vaccine at this point.
Nice, strikes and expiries?
Oh shit NIO boys. Not looking good rn
If it hits 41 then double down
It was like 5 Bolts.
His name was Big Stonk. The media won't tell you this because they don't want you to prosper. Buy now!
How tf are vaccine news making tech go red like they were distributing the vaccine today
Tell it to the sheeple that panic sell. I bought At $54 last week, waiting to drop to $36 so i can sell. CANY WAIT
Btfd frigates
Game over techno bulls. I read the moderna release and it's like from the script of Hollywood blockbusters. COVID stands no chance.

- Oh shit they're doing a launch! Get in!

- Launch is canceled

- SPCE is oversold <<<< You are here

- Wait 3 months
Yeap, I got it wrong 195 pre market, congratulations!!
Puts on moderna at 10 am today.
options will start pricing in a vaccine pump every friday now
You‚Äôll only be a few months late.
AAPL has been bouncing between 110 and 120 for months now like clockwork
#good news everyone were rotating out of tech
NIO will bounce off 40 and then zoom up
So GM is still green after all those recalls and fires on EV Bolts?
Market is forward looking so. No
i think the main lesson here is not to bet against the power of the chinese government...
69
Forward looking where?

A rejection of the fast tracking the Moderna vaccine means a huge tank. EUA (emergency use authorization) goes through incredibly careful inspection to be allowed to be distributed to the masses.

Investors are gambling big time by dumping money into travel stocks based on self-reported data by Pfizer and Moderna. Secondly, the population they worked with included healthy individuals not the ones susceptible to COV 2.
Someone made me look at an insurance stock and I almost thought it was a good idea. I feel gross.
[deleted]
I actually prefer a slow rollout like this. They find issues and fix them before *all* the stock is sent out.
Goat
With these numbers, FDA approval is a slam dunk
The lack of a clear answer is unbearable
How hot?
You always were....
You must not know how pharma lobbying works
So we're not averaging down on open? Mid-day seems better?
lol china trying to play games with NIO early today. Sorry China, You lose this time! Nio going 6 feet under (to $5 again).
ZM red today?
Yeah I feel bad for people who fell for the irrational exuberance. So much excitement and confidence is about to be crushed on open at least share holders will have something to hold on to.
Oh well, time to get some margin for the tech dip

I personally have lost about 10k on stocks in 3 years. I started with investing into a coin and made a little bit of money. Seen others making fuck loads more so I continued, and started doing stupider and riskier trades.

Tech is the future anyway, nobody can argue with it. The recent news just temporarily go against it.
I‚Äôve been in on nio since 5.84, if you think this stocks never dropped big IN That time Your wrong time has multiple times. Also vaccine only improves nios prospects

You understand the point of a vaccine is to stop people from catching it, so a low number is good.

Anyone else so blinded by investing in tech companies that they have no play for this vaccine pump? My watch lists are mainly tech and I have trouble getting excited about value stocks
My spce calls were murdered today too
Hope y'all idiots playing FSR are just trying to profit off of some early swings.. cause this company is not new and will never accomplish the things they say

Historically, definitely not the long term for stonks. Personally hoping the runoffs look terrible for üêò . Bet there will be amazing buying opportunities in short term.

You are truly stupid. Bluffing? Really? you bet your money on a vaccine company bluffing about their scientific results?
Corroborating story to the fed decreasing the IOER to 0.05...things are about to break. Vix calls it is.
Me too
wow NIO down 5% in pre-market...
Lmao I‚Äôm a true retard for buying tsla shares at 413 pre market to this dump

What are the odds that moderna will report that board members sold stocks today. We have been here before.
So we are really giving boomers 2 good exits to rotate into tech.
Yep
Yeah honestly I do feel bad now. I thought the news was so obvious that it had been priced in by the end of last week. Didn't expect the market to act like it was some earth shattering surprise.
This is 100 percent sell the news.
Flights are still happening fuck head
Congrats to the ICLN green energy call holders
What‚Äôs WebEx trading at? That and a facelift.

At what share price is MRNA going to drill back down? I‚Äôm thinking 107
But markets are rational /s
Sheep
MOTHER OF GOD. EVEN MY MAC'S FAN IS RUNNING LIKE A JET ENGINE WHILE BROWSING WSB. IT KNOWS SHIT IS ABOUT TO GO DOWN TODAY. IT HAS INTEL i9 BTW. SHIEEEET.
I bought two and flipped one on FB market.

Lil Yachty needs to drop a new album in the next hour and 33 minutes
Seems like another sell the news event, until gene therapy is the norm in 20 years or so it just a big nothing burger for a novel virus that mutates in every host it infects.
Good shit. I went with a large SPY call debit spread position and airline FD's. Didn't wanna bet MRNA news would drop before open lol
I can‚Äôt believe the prices some people are paying. I swear this pandemic is making people go nuts.
Yep. Our sweet prince

Tech tanking boomer stonks moonin. What happened
Seems pretty fucking retarded that BABA is mirroring JD right now considering one was already down 16 fucking percent in a month and the other is up 10 percent over the same period.
Lol do I even sell tech on the news of a fake and gay vaccine that was tested on 95 people
Oh don‚Äôt worry sir, I will!
You would be surprised
SPCE is on sale... market as usual overcorrects for the launch delay
Is stimulus more important than risk of tax reform?
It's why it's so important to have multiple variations of the vaccine.
—Ü–µ–º–æ—Ç–∏–ø –π–æ–º —Ç–µ–Ω just so u know this is Russian, backwards and upside down
Phizer is much better
mRNA vaccines have yet to ever be distributed to the general public yet investors being the dumbassss they are already going back into travel as if FDA has already approved it. 

Gonna buy BA puts as soon as market opens
Sell it and buy a put

13f is a quarterly report for financial managers with $100M in assets. Hes saying that these reports arent an accurate representation of their gains or loss for the quarter.
lmao wtf for real? How are they even allowed to publish these results then. I sure hope they'll be heavily investigated by the SEC for manipulation if that's true lol
The real deal is people act like the other auto makers aren't also going to hop on the EV train.

Like yall really think F and GM are like "Nah man, gas 4 eva!". They might be lagged by a couple years but at the end of the day a car is a car and everyone will be on board eventually. I definitely wouldn't long a company that was exclusively EV.

Because if they beat revenue and show growth then that will be your confirmation of growth and the market pays a premium for growing companies. February March or April would be good combined with Biden pushing renewal energy in January

if by "big fucked" you mean recovered to $42.71,  you would be spot on.
Covid is over since mango man is not ruling anymore
Probably $AMD considering it‚Äôs the only thing I have left
Yes, even more so. Once people go back to the 9/5 grind, why would you want to rush out of your house in the morning to go to a gym when you can get a better workout in your spare bedroom and save some time?

Or they keep it and run the digital program and return to the gym, because it‚Äôs still a better workout than doing it on your own for 99.9% of the population.

I wouldn‚Äôt count on any rebound yet. I went there for a trip last week (they wanted me to quarantine for days fucking no lol) anyway it‚Äôs getting like California there. Everyone‚Äôs bouncing with or without shutdowns. Homeless everywhere crime moving up into the yuppie neighborhoods, not nice.
Im not in on NIO but thats exactly what they said about TSLA , not saying they have an ELON but EV scene seems hot.

Me too in all seriousness, I‚Äôll probably do some calls at first and then buy in, I think it‚Äôll be volatile
Reminder that Moderna has never successfully brought a vaccine to market and appears to be a huge Theranos esque scam.

Also, the sample size for this was only 90 people and excluded the middle aged and elderly.
Going balls deep into SPY puts this afternoon. This is the biggest fake pump ever
Wait markets are not open yet.
Actually a very good point as well

Can someone please tell me how a vaccine is bad for spce calls

What the absolute fuckkkkkkkkk
You fucks have now valued NIO more than BMW.  BMW sells 500K cars per year in China with double digit growth and increasing revenue and 2+ billion in profits.

Meanwhile, NIO sold only about 60000 cars since 2018 and has no profits.  

And now you wonder why the Chinese EVs will crash?  Valuations will eventually comeback down to reality.  The argument that 'China iz big!!' as the reason why Nio deserves to be valued more than a company that actually sells 500k cars/year, is profitable, and also has increasing growth is absurd.
These retards start freaking out after one red day after it completely soars, hold onto NIO
Puts on the human race. Calls on tech stocks.

I own airlines and O&G. My portfolio is about to explode, folks.
Y‚Äôall already know mrna just shjt ! No fking way that company can have vaccines ! They just pump so they can sold out thier share . Why is it 94% not 89 or 95 ! Bc another company already said 90%  if they said 89  their shares will worthless. 95 is the number sensitive ! When ppl say 95% their mind always think about 100 ! They‚Äôre also created the demand and resistance another company . If your company can have vaccines more than 94% you will win if not , those share still good until another company come out vaccines 95%
I took a break near the beginning of this year just before the crash. Jesus fuck Christ who strapped Nio to a üöÄ????

Same here. I can go long on spy calls risk free. My expiries are in March. If they don‚Äôt hit my strikes and the market starts falling my calls on SPXS will break my fall.

And on top of that vaccine won't be distributed by winter of 2021. The market gets a hard (climax) on when they hear a vaccine new news pump for a few days then dump. We're still not safe even for another year or so and who knows what might happen then

Damn and this mrna vaccine is even more effective than the pfe one
Not at all. I have December/Jan calls on spxs as a hedge just in case the market decides to shit the bed for some reason.
Double down
This feels like massive manipulation lol, nothing is settled without the FDA approval stamp. There is talk for emergency use only in the NEXT WEEKS, meanwhile daily cases are skyrocketing with thanksgiving and christmas around corner and US in general seems ignorant as fk about covid post election. The vaccine data is also sketchy as shit. I really don't know what to think of this.

Thats a CFM engine. Calls on GE, and Safran if you want to be a lame French surrender type.
I wouldn't be surprised if the market sold off around open through midday with some heavy selling in tech in proportion to the rest of the market anyways. MRNA has the making of a sell the news event, lots of dumb money expecting repeat of last Monday will probably buy into the first dips at open, would be easy money for MMs to slaughter them. Even .5% down at close would milk dumb money dry for the week.

Hell I got given a free giant -80 freezer to my lab last week for nothing because they're hanging around so much in our department. The freezers and dry ice are as common as coffee in commerical labs, universities, and hospitals. It's just the usual where people latch onto a stat with such arrogance only possible by a true retard.
I understand why you might find draft kings an preferable alternative to other forms of fantasy sports. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that COVID has artificially inflated player counts, therefore the stock will dip when COVID goes away and player counts go down.
This holiday season is gonna suck for a lot of Americans this year. At least new vaccines will ease the suffering... next year. Wtf is this.
Yeah I know but I ain‚Äôt no scientist but I figure they know more than we do.

Bears R fuk
Tech selling off on vaccine news like everyone doesn‚Äôt know that the world has become more digital forever through this process. This shit has changed the way we live and work. You‚Äôre just going to take your zoom calls and make your amazon grocery orders from your office instead of your home
Yea that‚Äôs the joke

Some real momos in here. We are in a long bull market we can still keep going, but no one should be shorting the beaten down stuff. I also know people who want to buy puts on VXX again the risk reward just isn‚Äôt there.
If value stocks are growing 10% per day on vaccine news, there's no reason to invest in NIO right now
Sure, I won't trust the medical professionals and PhD researchers claiming good efficacy. I will trust this fucking random shitbrain on Reddit.
Ppl acting like tech is literally going to disappear SURE LOL

Link?
This is the way.

People are still using zoom, just that some people think zoom is a bit overvalued.
This is literally what happened in the Pfizer announcement now if you can remember what happened right after.
next week probably: 

>!Kodak vaccine 99% postive!<
This probably the most retarded comment ive ever seen
If it goes anywhere near 200 again I'm getting another 10 shares
That‚Äôll do it. Thanks
NIO shaking out the weak hands, true believers are holding
Yea I‚Äôm thinking of going into spy calls with the vaccine news and Biden stimulus I‚Äôm in
Guys we had a preview of this last week and it‚Äôs going to play out exactly the same...calls on tech at the bottom, puts on travel at the top.
Literally free money
PLTR is showing good relative strength here. Looks like a buy
Vaccine that isn't even going to be available until like spring 2021 at the earliest not only solved the pandemic, it revived the dead brick and mortar holiday shopping experience! Two birds one stone!

Online shopping no longer needed.
we all knew moderna was gonna publish them this week
Describe their business model post-vaccine, please.
FAR more bears than planes and we just sacrificed one of our own to take out one of theirs. We winning the war.
AZN already announced 100m doses for India
I give up. Dumping tech today
Next week monday AZN vaccine and +4.5% additional effective   my prediction

I was ready to jump in based on the test launch in few days but just read someone post they canceled th test flight on their website. Bless the puts tendie gods
I think so yeah. See also airlines, mall REITs, brick and mortar retails, banks, and anything else that ate it in March
Moderna! Too bad I‚Äôm tied up in sold calls
[deleted]
What came before. Google meet, chat, hangouts
Big game changer. Vaccine only available for Americans. Will prevent the doubling of deaths by March. Only 2C degrees needed for storage. Game over for COVID. For yanks this year.
FSR the movement now
If TSLA achieves the 50% reduction in cost, NIO is dead. Especially because they don't have any manufacturing. Papa Elon has said many times that manufacturing is EVERYTHING
Sell the rip, buy the dip, repeat of last week likely

What does this mean?

i didn't have money back then. so it is an honest question :)

SPCE WHAT THE FUCK MATE
Pajama traders learned their lesson from last week and are saving the pump for open
Fear from what? Also why are you yelling at me I‚Äôm sensitive
Tax for gains is 26,x% as well. Here you dont need to file for bankruptcy when you need to go to the hospital. You got parental leave, 30 days vacation, health insurance mandatory, job loss payment for a year, 3 months notice before you get fired and so on. I wouldnt want to live in the US tbh. But yeah, if you have a huge salary you can save tons much faster than here.

So like. What do you do during a rotation like this? Wait for any sell off to finish, buy tech calls, wait for the rotation back?
Still Long and accumulating NIO. Citron aught to change their name to Cyanide.

JUST BE PATIENT AND DO NOT SELL FROM FEAR

The fuck happened to SPCE?
Which part of the COVID/News cycle are we in today? 

"Market pumps on vaccine optimism"?
Does clockwise or anticlockwise rotation matters
No not really.

Results were scheduled to be out around this time, before. Why influence the result either way?
Buy the dip when covid mutates?
Bro it‚Äôs the same tech. One of them is lying or the truth is in the middle. Intuitively makes no sense for the difference to be that large.
It is... that‚Äôs why I said it‚Äôs not worth explaining it‚Äôs for boomers
Hey smart ass some people don't like the casino or playing at casinos ... Some people just like to play Fantasy sports in the comfort of their home like me... NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL ETC..
Too soon
BA puts, ZM calls, HD/LOW calls, SPY puts, and BABA calls....literally everything I bought is gonna get me wrecked üò™
Fuck no. Smells like bad potatoes. And it tastes even worse
I‚Äôm going to wait for tech to go down a little more based off Moderna‚Äôs vaccine news and buy in a little later.
Held my nio puts LFG boys
You're crazy, how much money one would have to buy so much of a single stock? 10 Millions?
That's what I was thinking too.. plus it'll tank more today on vaccine news
Moderna just pulled a ‚Äúcall an ambulance, but not for me‚Äù on Pfizer
I agree. I bought value stocks all week. And Friday's pump was a clear signal that this strategy would work this week
U nasty
Cant believe there were so many bears before vaccine news lol
So they had a .6% infection rate with a placebo? Doesn't that alone seem odd?
Good time to buy big tech
Lol sell
I have the feeling that it's easier to get Money.   
But it you fall you fall deeeeep.   


It's like living with a 10x leverage :D   
All or nothing.
Please get my gay ass out of my amazon put and I will not short amazon again unless it goes above $3300
Same reason heroin addicts always chase the first high.
If we keep rotating, eventually we‚Äôre just gonna be spinning in circles
I wouldn't touch calls on baba right now either, I want to see a 2 day pump at least

This is like a cult in here.

This is why I've been loading up on xlf xle xom bp rds
So we just gonna have a vaccine pump every Monday 2 hours before open so we can trade flat as fuck for the remainder of the week? Awesome

it's because they pushed back the test flight

Not to mention messenger RNA modification isnt well researched enough for long term effects and a mRNA modifying vaccine has NEVER been approved for use. Puts at open.
Moderna just saved America. They get it first this year.

Time to buy JNJ before they release their 95% efficacy vaccine news
Yes, because Moderna announced last week that the number of cases of COVID required to run their interim analysis had occurred. Therefore it was clearly only a few days before the analysis would come out. They put the press release on their twitter account ffs. I know this is WSB but, seriously, how did anyone not know about this?

ACB at $9 this week??!!
I‚Äôm sorry what? 94.5% out of 15k people is a joke? Covid vaccine?
Why is NIO dying?
It‚Äôs the same fucking tech lmao. People are dumb for thinking one is that more fragile than the other.
last dip was bought up + some next day, I'm not really worried, probably gonna double down on tech when it get's even cheaper
RIP my JetBlue puts, you were too pure for this world
take profit and buy the tech dip?
It‚Äôs ok we all got touched alittle
The most terrifying thing is that prepandemic rates were also super fuckin low. 

You are not going to want any exposure when that news breaks.
I'm not sure if I want these lockdowns to end or for my tech stocks to keep going up.   Doesn't look like I can have both.
Until you realize how many people drive their cars just to ride that stationary bike in the gym
risky play but I'm gonna throw 1k on ZM today, lockdowns can give it a good pump already down 6%
Getting some strong September 3rd vibes here...
Fuck.. zm.. fuck

But seriously are polar bears drinking that much coke right now. Fucking buffet
Biden curved covid
i think this is gonna fade quick and tech will be back to booming in no time
That already got bumped up last week, there could be some continuation upwards however the first cruise to set sail again already had positive COVID cases so tread carefully
Sir draft kings is an electronic gambling platform that thrives when people are locked indoors and looking for any short lived dopamine high. Once the vaccine is out, there will be a lot less people playing draft kings. I would suggest working on your critical thinking skills before continuing to invest in tech stocks.
This one can be kept in a normal fridge for 30 days and is 95%.  Even room temp for 12 hours..

most employee health insurance covers things like that. I had a full left hip replacement, hospital/surgery/parts/3 months rehab came out to about $6k. Yes you need a real job and many get screwed, but it's not like everyone has shit benefits.
Pfizer said they would only have a certain amount of doses ready to go, this vaccine is also limited but together we can vaccinate more people

You got it Chief.

Another round of discounts.
why the fuck would more vaccine news even matter ? pfizer already announced a vaccine with >90% success. this stupid shit should already be priced in and expected to come eventually
Really glad I over rotated BNTX->MRNA
It‚Äôs funny because every time this is posted - it‚Äôs been wrong. 

And it also doesn‚Äôt understand how averages work - the average isn‚Äôt a straight line, it would have increased with the new highs
i expected worse for tech, sell off isn't as brutal as of yet
I need to poop but can‚Äôt afford to flush my toilet :(
Your doing well, buying the high to sell the incoming low. Good job retard.
90% efficacy is considered remarkable on a vaccine like this
Who wrote algo logic. Vaccine=Tech down. ü§¨

Dude I sold NVAX at 22.

I give up on PTON. Getting out while I can
Remember when vaccine pumps brought the whole market up and didn‚Äôt curb stomp tech? I miss those days.
Too long didn‚Äôt read add emojis next time
My CNK calls are making me hardu
Lmfaooooo tEcH iS dEaD
This is typical or MRNA being scammy as fuck
[deleted]
Because the market always does the opposite of logic
I‚Äôm a biased NIO bull with more riding on leaps than a few weekly FDs. This PM action doesn‚Äôt phase me. Whether a continuation of a sell off over one short sellers opinion or the ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù pullback that‚Äôs touted as needed doesn‚Äôt change the fact that numbers should be good for ER and the sudden hit targeting NIO alone should indicate that. 

Advice for today for others would be to average down and possibly move out to 11/27. I‚Äôm keeping my 11/20s because this drop we‚Äôre seeing now has had equally high spikes during the last 2 weeks. 

Or I‚Äôm wrong and somehow one person made millions sell at a loss because he said to lol.
Talk about a supply chain advantage.

"Moderna said Monday its vaccine remains stable at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a standard home or medical refrigerator, for up to 30 days. It can be stored for up to six months at negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine requires a storage temperature of minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit."

Market is irrational and somehow this news is different than already having 90% positive vaccine and totally not priced in at all
Zoomers buying boomer stocks
Markets looking ahead its a work at home stock more positive vaccine news
NIO shills in shambles
I despise donkey Kong now.  Trying to wait til the next leg up so I can dump it
Nio down in pre market already. Prepare for it to go to 35???
PTON 88 puts sell eod
Pfizer requires vaccine to be at -70C .Moderna only 2C. Moderna wins
>noooo why is zoom tanking when work from home is the future paradigm
Bye nio
Yeah, i still wonder till this day how you guys get paid that much.   
May i ask how many Taxes you pay? It's roughly 40% for me.   


Are there that few good edjucated People in the US?

Imagine thinking news is the reason for everything
What should i gamble my money on this week ??
Not gonna lie. I had puts in all the wrong places. Fml.
MRNA really came out with the knockout punch for anyone that thought tech still had momentum
Dammit SPCE
Internet is dead, buy paper and pencil stocks
I can‚Äôt believe retards in here bought puts on SPXS thinking it would be sub 4 dollars by now. You buy calls on SPXS to hedge you don‚Äôt short it when the markets up this much. Let the market come down let the ETF shoot higher then buy puts.
aapl recovering quickly..
60c 12/04 crew here!
People can go back to casinos and bet there?
Me if I weren‚Äôt in the stock market: oh wow a new vaccine! We are going over the pandemic like a boss! I‚Äôll get vaccinated ASAP!

Me rn: fuck the vaccines. I hope we stuck in this mink flu longer
So Moderna vaccine results 


15000 with placebo, 90 got sick


15000 with vaccine, 5 got sick


85/90 = 94.5% efficacy?


90 getting sick out of 15000 vs 5 getting sick out of 15000 doesn't seem very statistically significant to me. Is this a typical result for vaccine trials?
[deleted]
We had news about the news last week
Pretty sure Moderna had preferred to be ahead of Biontech instead of waiting just because it‚Äôs bad for Mango. 
Americans are too obsessed with that dumb shit. No one cares, especially not big Pharma.
NIO is going green by open
Pretty soon Tech is going to be the beaten down sector
I have no fucking clue. I see graph slowly go up, I put money in and watch it go up.

Just like what happened the other day with vaccine news. Rotation out of tech and into leisure/entertainment for the day.
anything growth is being sold off its not that hard
They already announced that they're literally going to use blow darts to vaccinate the general population, give it up bro it's over

Here‚Äôs an article someone posted yesterday that is well worth the [read](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/21/magazine/palantir-alex-karp.html)... And thanks man!

This is a great buying opportunity for NIO, will moon after earnings, don‚Äôt listen to the naysayers

All these vaccine pump and dumps lol. 

Next week there'll be another headline, "U.S. Adds 200,000 cases in 1 day with no end in sight!". Then pull back and rotation back into tech. The following week, novovax or pfizer or moderna release a press release about positive vaccine news, execs dump more shares. CNBC comes on and says, "this is not insider trading". 

Rinse and repeat.

‚ÄûThe trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections.

The analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms.

Only five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5%.

The data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised‚Äú

This is a fucking joke lol, less funny than Pfizer‚Äòs 60 people sample size but still a joke.
This is a strong buying signal for me (sitting all cash). Pre-market, the tech stocks look to be going on sale again. If this news hurts tech/stay at home plays I‚Äôm buying the dip.
I will when it drops back to 17..always does

Okay? Maybe. I heard an Employer needs to nealry pay double for your brutto payment. Im not an Employer, so i dont know.
Buy high and sell low boys. FUCK ME IN MY ASS
Sucks man. I am not good at short term plays ha.
Does vaccine equal TECH DUMP? Like MSFT and APPL weren't relevant pre-covid? What BS..
I'm not getting fucking vaccinated with these pharma companies only trying to make headlines and get their stock to pump so their CEOs can dump. Fuck that shit.
Also buying NOKIA on their last earnings has been free money. Call me boomer but this is an easy 10-15 year hold with 5g-6g tech. nokia smallest segment is in China which grew 20% last year.

It‚Äôs two weeks ago. The Biontech vaccine was German. 

Mango will still pretend it‚Äôs somehow his work.
Probably a better interpretation is to buy deep ITM leaps on SPY which is effectively buying SPY for pennies on the dollar. Jan 22 calls, 5% ITM, and gives you 5% of wiggle room to dump short term calls closer within the money.

I think it‚Äôs at a great discount but too volatile with its recent politics. Buying stocks in the long term will probably be fine but I‚Äôm not sure at the moment about buying options.
Hm, it's possible to Buy a house with that. It greatly depends where you wanna buy it. In a Big City? NO WAY! Countryside? Sure, why not?

now they start every monday to put out these vaccine news to push the market. Still too many shorts in the market that¬¥s why it is always spiking.

wow that PLTR spike
User name's flag checks out
NIO won me over but all these people hyping NIO up has me worried as fuck
And this is why I bought 3x SQQQ calls on Friday. I figured they were going to pound the market with this vaccine news first thing Monday morning. This bullshit will last 2 days max and then everyone will calm the fuck down and pump tech again because vaccines don't change shit for 6 months still.
Moderna said on Monday (Nov 16) its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second US company in a week to report results that far exceed expectations.
But the first rule is always inverse WSB. üôâ
why are you awake at 4 in the morning?

this is prime vaccine news hours hoe
\*DOW to SPY and QQQ\*

Dow: Look at me, im am tech now
My portfolio is dead.
you prob missed the boat today
We got the vaccine news first before New York Times üòé
I'm holding 270 c until Friday. I think it will recover to that but nothing extreme like it was a month ago
Pardon?
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jtf81v/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_13_2020/gc6ebzx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3
Yup.
Giant demon dicks on tech and it‚Äôs just beginning üëø
UGhnnhsboohhhhAhhhhhhhhhhhh
#Amzn
Still.
Told you all to buy value stocks last week. This was so predictable.. so many articles saying Moderna would release vaccine info any day now. Imagine there are a lot of rich wsb‚Äôers now!
ü•∏
Same.. I have other vaccine plays but BA seems like the golden goose
[deleted]
Statistics!
Do you realize how many spy shares he can buy with 10k lol
-2.38% now and looks to be going down even further....
Check my post history...I'm loaded to the tits in puts
Sell tech immediately at open?
NIO gang holding their breath rn
Cut losses
I think the stop loss will cost him 5%. Just scale in on the next dip, and then add a stop loss in two years when he‚Äôs closer to taking it out. Otherwise these 5% swings will stop him out, and he‚Äôll have to time the bottom to buy back in.
People who bought AMC in Friday just be happy.
Let's get the $MRNA pump going for the Fauci, he isn't on TV 24/7 for his health you know.  Another week, another vaccine pump.  Seems like a kang gang ü¶ò moving kind of day.  Good luck with yolos today everyone!
Them techs do be dumping
Buy TF out of AMC or dump after this pump?
Damn vaccine news gonna tank tech
Hasn‚Äôt been the same since Enron died of Covid
What‚Äôs your spread?
Just be sure to sell tomorrow
I don't for one second believe the company that tried to get everyone on Hydroxychloroquine somehow pulled a vaccine out of its ass that's of course better than Pfizer.
Fuck you give me all the vaccinesüíâüíâüíâ
F big tech
Nah. Fat, balding and ugly as sin.
It‚Äôs shitting the bed you sick fuck
INO up 21% pre üëÄ
I probably getting ZM puts, that time we saw a -87$ drop in a day
It‚Äôs super sus that all this vaccine news is coming out so soon AFTER the election.
well it's last monday all over again
Tanking it‚Äôs rocketed
The boomers have their revenge on mondays
300k will be far before XMas...exponential growth is a bitch.
Moderna vaccine 20 million first year, 2 shots 4 weeks apart sounds real convent and DOW should defiantly cross 30K because of this /s
If dow hits 30k before open just know we‚Äôre drilling to oblivion
Hell yeah! LOL
https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54902908

‚ÄûThe trial involved 30,000 people in the US with half being given two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart. The rest had dummy injections.

The analysis was based on the first 95 to develop Covid-19 symptoms.

Only five of the Covid cases were in people given the vaccine, 90 were in those given the dummy treatment. The company says the vaccine is protecting 94.5%.

The data also shows there were 11 cases of severe Covid in the trial, but none happened in people who were immunised‚Äú



thats it? only looking at 95 positive tested people?
If I knew blablabla
Pharma must hate orange so bad to release new after his loss. Rubbing that medical grade salt in. üßÇüßÇ
Who shot down nio?
I get such a fucking hard on whenever tech shits the bed.
Vaccineeeeeee
Jd fucked my ass really hard this time
Oil is fucking ripping
I think he sold most of them off from the other week on the first spike? He had some 1 cent calls that went bonkers
Do you think MRNA maintains premarket gains or profit taking at open?
Nah dude they gonna go full trump and cry rigged like on Friday
LETS FUCKING GOOOO NIOOOOO
[deleted]
short everything
Got my gf to invest in JETS last week, guess who's getting access to the runway tonight boys.
no mushu wtf
Who tf cares lol. COVID is canceled
when to buy BABA... maybe today?
Any day trade ideas for today?
This is the stupidest shit I‚Äôve ever seen. We don‚Äôt want a vaccine you cunts
Hold Tdoc 11/27 200c or cut losses?
I should have followed the money when insiders bought december 100c at the time it was trading in the 70s gg inside trading fuks me again
This SPCE dump is the most retarded thing I have ever seen. Imagine panic selling a stock so hard it drops 10% because of a minor *delay* that has zero impact on the viability of the company. Buy your cheap calls at open. Shit is dumping like they failed to get FAA approval or something lmao
Bruh shouldn‚Äôt even be tech wtf , fuck gas Biden 2020 trump just concede already!!!!!
Lol ok Mr. Tough Guy
If you're not risking it all on weekly options then whats the point?
I'm watching closely, but only 30 cents. Considering the hype it didnt even hold 17...

Is it possible to take the blue pill after you've taken the red pill? Asking for a friend.
tech being flat feels a lot better than tech -2 dow +2, dont think we are crashing any time soon
Dude go outside.
Dogshit right to 35 I bet now coming from bag holder
Easy
Moderna released like a 95% effective vaccine, only has to be refrigerated. Easier to transport
Yes, thier vaccine posted far superior to the PFE vaccine, 94% v 90% effective and refrigeration storage vs. -70¬∞C.
True. They were the most ordinary generation of all time. 2x Leveraged Short on $GENX.
To sell zm puts or see if it bleeds another day

Actually, their intelligence couldn‚Äôt be measured, so it wouldn‚Äôt qualify as low caliber. We don‚Äôt have measurement tools sensitive enough to detect that kind of reptilian intelligence.
that moderna rally just kinda fading away
Then you should have YOLO'd on NIO like all the other retards
AMC $5.50 EOD

Robinhooders will see that it‚Äôs

Cheap, a familiar name, up a big %

Any idea in what timeframe?
Bullish! 300k by Christmas!
Vaccine Monday
tanker gang showing life, thanks MRNA!
Lol woke up vaccine news, just like last Monday. Will shit all week like last week too?
BABA is RED

REEEEEEEEEE
Nap time gents see you in two hours
95% efficacy for the Moderna vaccine just announced
Moderna trials just read out early data. 95% efficacy and no super cold storage.
Just a gully
Modern a, vaccine more than 90% effective
You didn‚Äôt make shit until you close out the position and withdraw the money from your account.
[deleted]
NIO three fiddy. Final offer.
JD and PDD are down more
Tesla nooooo üò≠
Like Yahoo, they got cocky and overvalued their business and missed out on an opportunity to sell to Microsoft. They will wish they did when they had the offer.
I'm just a simple Walmart holder. It goes up with vaccines and shutdowns. I take my profits and shop at Walmart which creates an infinite value loop.
Wait!  Moderna‚Äôs vaccine is supposed to be same process of development as Pfizer.  But it‚Äôs more effective and can be stored at refrigerator temps for 30 days??!!  Doesn‚Äôt pass the smell test.
Lol I did spend some time considering that move this weekend.
Moderna said Monday its vaccine remains stable at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit
dont its trash
ok wheres the dude who yolo‚Äôd his money into amc calls. reveal yourself and show us gains
0 it‚Äôs red
I have 68 shares, am I going to be a millionaire or did I fuck up by not getting 69?
Asking for a friend
This week we will break 200K Covid cases a day.
# FAUCI JUST SAID MRNA IS GUCCI. DOW HITTING 30K OFF THISS?
Yea we‚Äôre done it‚Äôs dogshit
Come to papa FSR. I‚Äôve got $5k to deploy.
PLTR up in Pre market
holding decent rn
Why is Moderna trending and Tech tanking? Another vaccine pump?
Hoping my weekly 70p‚Äôs pay out. That‚Äôs how they doing
How long do I wait today to buy Moderna puts?

HHHMMMMMMM

Shepherd, please take us sheeps to the promised lands.

Another vaccine? They are announcing new one each Monday pre-market. Manipulation.
TSLA vaccine 69.420% effective
Thanks for that.  It's like whoever wrote that can read my mind and emotions.  Creepy.
Oof i hate to be right.... especially holding 11/27 calls.
Man I saw PLTR at 17.70 before falling back to sleep wtf
Tech lost value
MM bought Moderna OTM calls for 11/20 last Friday
Imagine being a bear in this market lmao
If you‚Äôre just going to let it sit, I‚Äôd say 5 years is a pretty low risk investment, but 2 years could be riskier. If you set your stop loss you will be fine. Definitely much better than a mm
...ban?
Fuck spce
Moderna Ceo gonna sell some many shares today lol
Its not pumping as much as last week leaving room for more pump
ah yes it says here you sold 5000 AAPL shares so you could afford 50,000 CCL shares.

You are perfect candidate for the short bus
Hey! It‚Äôs like me!
Legitimate answer is that because valuations are so high, that‚Äôs probably a bad investment for a 2-5 year time frame because we‚Äôre expected to face some volatility in the foreseeable future. So your 5% stop loss could get wiped in as little as a week. You‚Äôre better off riding the SPY and selling cover calls against it whenever possible. And set realistic downside targets, a stop loss is great when you can manage entry and exits
Dang I sold my 360Cs bc I finally unlocked green mode. I could have been greener mode!
If we all hum very loudly we can summon the Nasdaq Whale to keep the pump alive
TSLA back @ 408 wtf I looked away for 10 seconds

Did spce just crash a ship or wtf?
Try to make educated guesses and get ahead of the news
Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO) is an obvious diamond in the rough, let‚Äôs poooomp dat bitch

Because it‚Äôs starting the day at 25 and not 40
[deleted]
Watch this fucking vaccine flip off PTLR for today and we get one last shot at a deeper discount before it skies EoW. You'll see, calling that now.
Gonna buy BABA at open
Thats fine. I set stop loss on anything over 5% of the portfolio after what happened in Feb. I set the price at the next next support level.
Strike date?
ZM going down BA going up, 

And then there‚Äôs nio, moving on some reports..
If only I would qualify for student loan forgiveness... 

First issue, I refinanced $50k of my $73k federal loans with a private lender so that $50k won't qualify.

Second issue, the Dem's plans for student loan forgiveness have ranged from $10k for all borrowers to paying off all loans with if you make less than $125k. I make more than $125k. 

So, of the $73k loans I have maybe only $10k will be forgiven. And that's a maybe. Dems need the senate.
What in the fucking fuck. Europe is buying today. Based.
Vaccine lol
Sir, this is a casino
I refuse to get vaccinated until my tech portfolio is back in the green
I‚Äôm talking about the whole market
They were hyping Moderna on CNBC so much last week. I should have actually listened, fuck.
Next summer you'll have real estate in Montecarlo. I'm jealous
Its bearish if the red line is broken.  Thats why I said I‚Äôm selling if it touches 30.24 because im expecting sells to trigger.  Correction might only be a quick drop.
You‚Äôll probably lose 5%. Look at the chart over the last 5 years, and check how many times it‚Äôs moved -5%. 

Edit: Wait for a down day and buy in. Otherwise scale in once a month on down days.
Why NIO red PM what is this
These are for next week.
[deleted]
So are we literally going to relive last Monday and pump on more vaccine news and then sell off at open? This market is actually retarded
Just wait for the next correction though. You don‚Äôt want to buy at this time no matter how bullish you are. Plus when SPY starts going down, buy 2k worth at a time.
Hey guys just woke up, how much fucking money have my Nio calls made me. Fuck yeah!!!!!!!
OOOOOR, they announced in on Wednesday that this was coming, it's been on a calendar for end of November release since the summer, and there's reasons for releasing the information Monday mornings
Best performer in my portfolio by a long way.
Buying the ZM dip
MRNA is a pump and dump so far this year.
BABA, PLTR, SPCE are what I‚Äôm going to buy at open
And you all doubted CCL.
SPCE tanking ‚Ä¶ flight delayed again .. some covid bullshit ‚Ä¶. brandson no going to space any time soon ‚Ä¶. the bigman be dead before this flight happens fs lol
Oh boy , here i go buying tech again
What are your positions if you're so sure about that?

Themselves included.
You only get cheated on if you're a weak cuck. Fuck off with that weakass noise
BTFO. Everything worth having today will be overbought by open.
But if it‚Äôs easy to make a vaccine we may have hundreds of millions by spring.
Duuuuh buy moderna?

SPCE is coming back to Mother Earth to grab some vaccines?
What in the actual fuck is this
Calls on partying
Rip tech
Well at least I get a second chance at the vaccine pump. This time I'll sell at the open.
Good time to buy calls?
what about now? <\_<
So when is AZN news?
TNA calls
You mean you didn‚Äôt buy calls on Friday?
That‚Äôs the smart thing to do I would say.
Buying opportunity!
Short DOW 30k until vaccine gets approved
This is unbearable, I have overleveraged position on an average of 279, SL at 240 thats the lowest. I just wanna take it out in green and continue living my life.
JNJ and AZN. I‚Äôm all in on AZN. I have some intel that‚Äôs telling me that they are preparing their digital platforms for extremely high traffic. I have had these conversations directly with their engineering leaders who said they need to ensure these critical platforms can handle insane amounts of data flow/traffic.

In my mind could mean two things. They are preparing for some big news soon or they suck and have built shitty applications and are scrambling to fix them.

My guess is it‚Äôs more of the first one because they have a lot of very smart leaders in place to have shit the bed on development for this long.

Boomer rotations
I've got a personal finance question for you guys (not about to go posting in r/personalfinance). I have about $10k sitting in money market because I suspect I may need to spend it in the next 2-5 years. What if I put all of it in an index ETF like SPY, and set a stop loss around -5%? I understand there is some risk that the ETF could gap down more than my stop loss overnight, but barring this situation, is there any other reason why I might not want to do this?
Unusual Moderna options activity was detected over the weekend in 11/20 90 call.. Insider bullshyt running rampant, we the regular gamblers left holding the ü§° mask üòÇ

I mean I'm not shorting this shit since there is no logic, but I'm also so hesitant to buy anything. Nothing makes sense.

TSLA CALLS
[deleted]
I think the play might be to buy everyone's favorite overvalued covid stocks (PTON, ZM...) if there's weakness today. In late December, the market might finally realize that the whole reopening rally was built on vaccines that aren't getting widely deployed until mid-2021. Complement that with a narrative that the exponential number of covid cases might start to matter, and people will rotate into the covid stocks again.
Spce test flight canceled per their website
Ur a fucking retard
So does  E-Trade
Lol at people saying zm is dead. Large vaccine distribution won‚Äôt be available until mid 2021, with colleges already prepared for a second semester online and lockdowns in major cities. But yes fomo into boomer stocks fellas and gals. 

Position: ZM 500.
So probably was a good idea to get out of that position , yeah
So who‚Äôs the next company to have the vaccine next Monday.
STOP THE COUNT! üêª LIVES MATTER!

Moderna announces Vax with 90% plus effectiveness
aight well my all tech portfolio is not having a good day
Market has the memory of a goldfish, literally tempered repeat of last monday....
Next week : FDA announce Pfizer vaccine accepted

Week after : FDA announce Moderna vaccine accepted
why the fuck do EV makers tank on vaccine announcements
Well there goes 4K. Maybe everything will fade like last time and I can break even ish. Will see. Not likely. Happy for vaccine news though even though I lost.
GM EVs are HOT!

Well, they catch fire and are being recalled...
üé∂Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend üé∂
Not as much as I would have liked to in life by this age, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you mean to ask.

How the fuck is this shit not priced in? ZM seriously gonna have another -5%+ day? FUCK!
That‚Äôs good news. Plenty of time to go up.
Listen up tards!!

Sell the small cap and vaccine rip and buy the tech dip mid week just like last week dont be dumb. You can do this i believe in you
i have 45 dollar calls hope it hits mid 50s
ZM down bigly
MODERNA
aha! 

> Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19

Citron says that NIO will suffer due to price cuts of TSLA. I am wondering if Chinese people would buy TSLA or be patriotic and buy NIO. Didn‚Äôt they give a big jolt to iPhones during the trade talk?
If this holds At open is going to be the best buying opportunity you‚Äôll get on NVDA all week. Maybe best for a long time with their earnings coming up.
Tech is fuk
Anyone that sells tech(besides ZM) on vaccine news is of the lowest caliber of intelligence imaginable
Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Stop the market and let me sell tech now
From what i see ZM chart 

Next support at 376 then onwards to 350 if 350 breaks might see 325
Just take what the market gives you pal
Tech rotation incoming eow. Then back to value stocks on Monday. Rinse and repeat.
china ev car stocks<china ev scooter stocks
Looks like BA puts were not the move üò™
Will AMD and NVDA gap down 7% again
Yes, so we can buy more.
tech is just gonna get kneecapped by fake vaccine news once a week now cool
Market isn‚Äôt event open yet! We already knew a vaccine existed, this one just confirms that it‚Äôs possible. Of course it‚Äôs a smaller pump.
Nice just keep holding
should be easy to repay debt...oh im up huge today if we stay this green...  trump should tell fed that we need to start tightening giving old boy biden an enema to start with
TECH IS DED
Thank you for your service, sir.
Why the jd selloff
I think its jd tanking it. Baba was 263.50 until jd started tanking from the earnings call.

This is a hold for the week.

As long as u don't have something stupidly aggressive like 290 by friday, I think ull be good holding for the week.
Last Monday sector rotation nio went up and traded sideways. Hoping for at least something similar and some mooning Tuesday at the least. Going to pray to the Tendies gods and offer up my cash
The quality of wsb comes and goes. I miss a lot of the mango crowd. They were funny.
my portfolio starting booming up in the last 5 minutes, whats going on, vaccine 2.0?
All this time you've been looking for the retardation in the market when it was inside of you all along ü§î
I think it needs to chill there.. 1 or 2 more weeks and might start to head back up. I would calls with time 9-15% otm. Guaranteed gains!
You know how it fell pretty fast Friday? It‚Äôs also spiked equally as fast throughout last week. 

Don‚Äôt kick yourself during the PM on MONDAY with ER AH tomorrow.
[removed]
You cashed out and made a profit, take it and move on. There are 100s of huge gains missed every day but you're not bought in or don't even know about them.  


Figure out your entry point and profit taking point and run with that. Sure there are a few YOLOs here and there that you can let ride to the top or bottom but overall discipline wins out.

On that note NIO and PLTR üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Bears r fuk
Jesus, AMD!
Hear you fully bro. What have you done?
when you shit talk the supreme excellence leader king guy thats what happens.
Basically flat still
I think it needs a catalyst to get out of this funk
Goodbye Zoom. You were a good friend.
This is the way
These vaccine announcements are singlehandedly going to bring AMC back from the dead
Pfizer: Preliminary results show our vaccine has a 90% efficacy rate.

Moderna: Hold my beer.
Thats a huge price movement I can‚Äôt see that moving that much today let alone in a month
Throw the $100k in an etf, retire a few years earlier now, start over with the $11k
Moderna execs asking what‚Äôs better than 90%? I don‚Äôt know Frank let‚Äôs just tell the people 94.5%.

Some of the bears are fucked comments though... don‚Äôt most of you trade tech?
How‚Äôs data dog, I‚Äôm scared to look
Let's gooo! Vaccine news is overall good even if you're losing money
How the hell did the nasdaq just tank but the S&P go up??
Still need stimulus
The reaction not as crazy as last week, will slowly melt up this week? Or will this pump melt down today and tech rebounds mid week
look at the candles the minute the news came out. the markets are up but the pump was rejected.

get out while you're ahead this is a sell the news event.

You don't need to flee into low, temporary orbit to escape the deadly virus anymore.

Kicking myself for missing out. Seemed like such an obvious play in retrospect
I can go back and look, but most was buying zm puts each morning that it was crushing from like 540 to 368 in about a week

People are gonna go outside now.. they will only use smoke signal these days

Wtf is BABA really up to? Why is it red again? Any news that I missed out? My champagne is getting warm again, maybe it's time to put it back into the chiller.

So, like, you could lose money or make it

Most of the idiots here are losing money at this casino

If anyone knew what would happen with absolute certainty, we‚Äôd all be fucking off on our private island surrounded by beautiful people and an epic load of blow.

May the odds forever be in your favor...

Also, fomo can be the bitch that bites the hardest...
Next week Novavax?! Then INovio with 100%?! Spy 400!
MY LIFE HAS BEEN A RUIN! I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME MONEY IS THAT THAT MUCH TO ASK FOR?!! Sob..Sob.. üòûüòîüò¢üò¢üò≠
We'll see. Merger deadline is 12/31. Maybe Canoo really is a lame duck, or maybe it is a huge EV play that everybody slept on and will FOMO into when it pumps. But right now is a super cheap time to pick some up and find out in 6 weeks or less.

Look at what is happening with FSR; the Ocean will start delivery in 2022, same year as Canoo's vehicle.
The market is shrugging this off a bit already..
It‚Äôs good , we get a sale !
Should I buy moderna shares premarket?
Didn't know results until just now.  It could have just as easily been 50% effective or 25% effective and rendered people infertile.  Who knows until the data is out.
Why the fuck is aapl getting sold on vaccine news. smh
Even fucking Kodak is up premarket while tech is dying
I bought 20 SPY $365c for $100 on Friday. I‚Äôm rich now

still stupid to rotate into value. there is no hope for this stocks in the upcoming year(s) even with a working vaccine they are going to burn money
SQQQ calls baby!!!!
Would‚Äôve expected a better rally for sure
NIO dead
Jobs are a market here, and benefits like health care are a form of compensation just like salary. A motivated individual can base their decision to accept a job offer on total compensation, not just salary.

In my experience anyone making >$80k has a job with full medical benefit coverage. That gall stone surgery would cost me $50 out of pocket, and I live in the USA.

It's still true that our social system doesn't provide that kind of safety net for lower income people.
Why is SPCE tanking on vaccine news. SMH
NIO surprise 99.9% success vaccine announcement
Easily after earnings. Read the inside info thread in this sub.

Holy shit i guess NIO does t like vaccine news?? The fuck?

Another tech sell off coming
This is exactly like last Monday lol
BA is üöÄ
How many more companies are working on viable vaccines? Trying to work out how many more of these pump events are left.
BABA has been dead long enough to start to smell.
Only 50ish all or nothing bets to go to be back at 10k! After all, this is a casino
It has been oversold since the anti trust issue.
Why the fuck wouldn't you have bought it on Thursday, when the company said Phase 3 data were coming imminently? I just don't understand people on here.
All options
0%
My 365 calls closed at 330% on Friday. I have 50 still üòé
# SELL GROWTH. BUY BANKRUPTCY
You know what we're gonna say....



YOLO that shit on FSKR weeklies!
Shares
looks like a weaker rotation
Sure. Usually buying 100 contacts to make it simple and trades last maybe 1-4 hours. In and out to make a quick buck.
Wow I am glad I bought some DIA calls on Friday
And there it is you were right bro moderna released
Lol there were $MRNA sweeps nearly all of last week and the week before.

You‚Äôre welcome everyone.  I went all in on puts late Friday.  I‚Äôll let you know next time.
I swear if amazon opens red nobody gets a present at christmas this year
rip tech ü§°ü§°
If the regulators are forcing them to up their reserves, they are likely still well under reserved. I‚Äôve not known any government regulator (especially state) to be very competent. I think you‚Äôd better deep dive into the LTC before buying this on Margin. GL 

Also, this is definitely for r/investing not WSB
UPS needs to fucking do something lol
Hopeful we get a bounce today. Seems oversold.

Puts on MRNA because why not
Insert Coin and press Enter
AMC going nuts
Yes
bro I literally just checked and fckin RCL is up $5 premarket even though 2 senators just told CDC to shut down cruises because of new infections on one ship....idk what the fck this market is doing but at this point I'm done trying to predict the dump I've lost way too much money on puts man. Entire market has absolutely no direction. How do we go to reaching ATH when America is racking up 1 million cases in less than a week and it will only rack up more faster to the point where its 1 million every 4 days in the next 3 weeks. Sorry for the rant but this market pisses me offüòÇüòÇüòÇ
convenient timing
Chinese government attempted to block the sale so tictoc might get banned. US gov isn't forcing a sale by next week but they have a sale trial in December. Probably will still get sold off early next year. Tictoc is hoping the Biden admin doesn't keep the pressure up
Imagine Nio announced a 99% vaccine that tazes you until all the covid cells are dead
Entire world is gonna jerk off to these vaccine results today
Most people don't need to buy a house because you don't need it as a nest egg the way you do in the US
How do you buy after hours ?

How effective was that Chinese vaccine before they had their adverse event and halted it?
You‚Äôre joking right
# PFE PUTS. 95% IS BETTER THAN 90%

QUICK MAFS
someone mentioned it, i felt it, but didn't do it
Do we get the same sort of mega rotation out of tech as last Monday?
Not at 100x earnings
So every Monday henceforth is a vaccine pump?

MODERNA SAVES US ALL
So tech down because vaccine news I guess
The what now?

Funny shit but yea basically they're just shorting the shit. Idk why people would be like "WOAH HOLY SHIT THIS INVESTOR WHO'S KNOWN FOR SELLING STOCKS AND THEN BUYING THEM BACK AT A DISCOUNT WROTE A RAG ABOUT HOW THIS RALLYING STOCK IS OVERVALUED RIGHT BEFORE EARNINGS REPORT I BETTER SELLLLLL"

Grats to people who got in ahead of the dip though, if they bought back EOD they're gonna drive home in some Tesras this week.
MRNA with the good vaccine news. We‚Äôre gonna pump at open then fade for the rest of the day

Why SPY mooning?

Puts at open, easy money
Whoever invested in Moderna at the close on Friday unbelievable play.

Another entry for PTON
I would first ask how much you want to invest and then go from there.  Ideally, the longest expiration and lowest strike possible.  Mine are $160 strikes for March 24 2023, but they were about 25k a pop.  Id say anything over a year that has a break even below 500 is good; ideally 18-24 months with that same sub 500 break even is going to turn a profit.

Fair point.. it‚Äôs 10x better with that considered
crude fuckers!!!!
*Stonks only go up
Why do these fucks always release in premarket jesus fuck just let me exit tech in peace
I think vaccine news means people gonna drive more... so TSLA tech might benefit bit from it
Don‚Äôt pay the loans. It‚Äôs gonna be forgiven.

Either hold it in cash or buy leaps
Another dip for tech nice time to load up more tech buy buy buy bullish tech
Whoah!  Massive vaccine news.  Moderna vaccine 94.5% effective.  Do we buy it premarket?
nios alive
It looks like some states don't have a capital gains tax, but either way its money you made, income. They gonna tax it somewhere. Just a reminder not to spend it all

Way to conflate thinking lockdowns are dumb with not caring about people who died from the China virus.  Great logic they must be teaching you over in big red.
uhhhhh...
Looks like the rotation may be here to stay this time. Maybe tech really is done at least for the year. :-(

[even you played video games] and haven‚Äôt since high school. 

Let me ask you a simple question, do you know difference between a Kingston-2600Mhz ram and Corsair? 

What about Corsair AIO cooling vs Noctua? 

It‚Äôs not a trick question point is you‚Äôre not their target market. 

You could make similar argument for both AMD & Nvidia which have seen extreme demands for their gaming equipment since before covid. 

Because let‚Äôs be real, if you don‚Äôt regularly play games since high school you‚Äôre not the target market that their 3090 -$2000 cards are completely selling out.
GAP UP BEARS GAPED
The logical conclusion is it will crash, so buy calls! That‚Äôs how it works these days.
The "biggest" small cap or two in each of the Russell sectors generally has enough liquidity to squeak out a decent options play, but otherwise IWM has heavy weighting into regional banks, consumer discretionary, boring industrials and healthcare, all fairly leveraged and all sensitive to the credit market compared to large caps

30k is pretty much. This is like 50k before Taxes, this is what an avarage German earns a year. The Employer pays nearly 100k(Employer and Employe pay the Social Taxes) if you get paid 50k.   
You guys (US) have a bigger opportunity to let your Money grow, we have a great Social System which provides us free Healthcare, free Education and Money when you get fired.   
It's a saver System, but yeah, you get WAY fewer Money.

Oh and because they have a contract with Pfizer to produce glass vials.

probably wont happen, but cruise industry wont get into normal operation until at least April, zero chance any recovery stock company can resume normal operation until vaccine is available to general public.
You'll probably make money on this today, but I wouldn't hold it for too long. Last week's news repriced everything and now markets are expecting nothing but sunshine and umbrella drinks for potential vaccine producers

Aapl also apart of tech stocks which has been under pressure, market rotation out of tech stocks,positive vaccine news will hurt tech, the trend is not with you on this Bet, you will need major volume to break that 120 resistance and the overall market is not buying up tech names they are selling them. There are much better risk/rewards trades available. Not saying you are wrong

If it really takes off, you can retire. I'm still a bit dubious given that it hasn't turned a profit in 17 years, but I was interested enough to buy a few leaps. Should be safe since it's turning into a meme stock. Congrats and best of luck bro.

You must not use a toothbrush either by that logic
I hold leaps in NIO. Last week I sold 11/20 57c against the leaps, and used the premiums to buy PLTR leaps lol. Living a bit dangerously, but so far so good.
Hello Vix my old friend
The real question is should I sell 10 PLTR puts at open, or just buy 1000 more shares ü§î
Either retarded or suicidal, probably both. 'Tis the life of a bear...
Currently balls deep in both as OP told me so
$20, I'm not bill gates jeez
Not the same as dilution so what‚Äôs to worry about?
Yes
Using a washrag is gross to me. Soap is self cleaning, "rags" are not.
What is fake wax?
Lol this couldn‚Äôt be more misinformed.
Insomnia with existential dread it is. I come here for the giggles and because I have no other social life in 2020. -.-
not under nda now so can say what the fuck i like
I got 8x 17.5c that would love it too. Plz
Why is that a sub? Seems like a breeding ground for pedos
Was the bear retarded?
Yes
I went to sleep at 2am and my body woke up exactly on time for futures without an alarm.

Calls on $ME
Yeah I'm sure nio will reach 100. I want to switch brokers to a no fee broker and I can't transfer the shares. Has to be cash and that'll take days. Trying to sell at a high and hopefully re enter during a dip with my new broker
I agree and it had a huge run up but can it keep going???
Yes via Battery
Why not both?
I wash myself with a rag on a stick
Maybe stationary bikes are used to power the world. 

Could be on to something 

Charlie Brooker did say that this world is starting to look a lot closer to his work, and that‚Äôs why another season won‚Äôt be released.

I literally started investing a week ago and I've already lost $20 because of NIO üòçüòç. If you want to play it safe stick to ETFs like VOO or ICLN. Long term these should go up a bit every year. Do your research on companies and dont listen to anything anyone on here tells you that includes  me, good luck.

Is this 're-certification' being performed by Boeing themselves by any chance? Because historically that hasn't really worked all that well in the past.

I've no doubt the air industry will pick back up once all this has blown over, but I dont trust Boeing at all, nor do a lot of other people.

I seriously 100% agree. Stonks will continue to go up and down. There's a degree of uncertainty. Student loan debt has a smaller degree of uncertainty in the way it doesn't go away unless you pay it off. All these kids with them booklearnin. Throw money at the debt, not a stonk people have been bickering over all weekend. It very well might go up and I'm invested heavily but I also don't have any financial ties besides my credit card.
Good question - I like this for a long term hold due to the leveraged dividend. My minimum holding period is 1 year for the capital gains treatment.

How is mint mobile for you is my real question? I see it shilled here and there but never heavy and the rates seem amazing considering my wife and I pay like 67 a line from sprint(now t-mobile) after all the discounts. Our bill for unlimited both lines everything is usually around 148 to 160 depending on how aggressive we are with our data. House has some weird spots and we use hotspots to fill the gaps sometimes which jumps our data by a few 20 to 50 gigs depending on the month.

Be careful with the leverage and take a big, deep long look at the 6:00am hour candle that happened last Monday before committing to a large position because we're still very much in the same market that produced that.
chill bruh
Congrats, are you going to be at 1m?

I picked up 12/18 IWM $150p on Thursday morning. Down 12%. I think open this morning is gonna be bad
Thanks bro.

Financial Times are reporting it
üôã
why?
Breaking: lemmykilmister1 raises SPCE target price from 25$ to 100$.
When are we pumping boys?
thats the spirit
Bought before earnings. Already 15%
Try fsr & solo too in the short term. I think there will be a nio dip but I could be wrong
Maybe a quick sell off as people panic about taxes, followed by a quick recovery and growth? There's so much uncertainty around it, but considering how high we got around the erection when it became more clear who was winning you might be right. Only worry is that it could have been the potential gridlock that caused the surge up.
Been waiting for it to touch 100. 

Think it might head there?
Ask the guys about Tesla when it was 300 pre-split.
Need NIO to pull it together and realize this isn‚Äôt all about him
Wanna see these Nio cucks burn
We red premarket boys. prepare ur assholes and wallets
Of course playing the game blind. Fuck data analysis
It will dip some that‚Äôs when you strike
I feel like you should pay me $230 for reading that shit post.

BABA at anywhere under $300 is undervalued.

This is a glitch tho it‚Äôs happened to me too. My 3m chart looked just like that

Depends. Short term it can be volatile, long term you‚Äôre fine
$NVDA: SUSQUEHANNA RAISES TARGET PRICE TO $610 FROM $560

It's starting. $NVDA will moon this week
Blue is running a guy who just started hit by oppo. He's be accused of being a sex offender, has video of the church he worked at putting on a pro-we love castro rally, and has defended people of questionable backgrounds as 'misunderstood'. Zero chance blue picks up both seats.

Untapped market that is worth around 130 billion is the big one.
This is all a bunch of bullcrap. You are assuming that the market will behave the same as you expect based on past behaviours while neglecting an infinite number of parameters that goes into the decisions that move the market.
Wait and see. I have JD calls, I know my luck

It‚Äôs swinging like crazy, back up to 95
You must be new here.
Employees of the company had shares at the beginning and it makes sense that they would exchange their long held shares for a more liquid asset like cash at the beginning of the listing. (makes more sense to hold cash instead of stocks in an uncertain time) I remember seeing a fuck ton of small sell orders coming through the first week. that selling has slowed down substantially and i‚Äôve seen larger orders (both buy & sell) come down the pike. 

This implies larger players stepping into the game

Edit: If a large portion of sell-leaning players left the game and now buyers are stepping up even after earnings, this is an indication of upward momentum.

Position Disclaimer: 300 shares @$9.20

Yeah this game is hard.
Life, yes
we up, just like NIO
Moderna pump lads, ready to get your fucking cocks wet?
Nio 35 or 65?
At open? I‚Äôd pray for that.
Doesn‚Äôt matter. There are 2 conservative dems in the senate that vote w Republicans. Dems need 52 blue seats, minimum.
so we are buying in right below its 52week high hoping it pops more and keeps running. I might snag 1 share just to see how it keeps moving. Seems HELLA risky though.
not until the end of mid to end of Feb. it's 180 from days from the original sale.. not sure on the exact timing.

Buy the ETSY dip if you‚Äôre wise. Way oversold. October was their highest traffic month in the company‚Äôs history. Huge growth opportunity.

Over the long term the stock seems to be going down, but I think is a good investment for like 2 years probably until it gets to pre-covid value.
Well when you worked at a company ten or fifteen years ago and it IPOs, you generally look to sell and diversify
[deleted]
No
Check out Li as well. Could be a good sign.
No
I can guarantee the stock consistently moves right.
JD about to go green
We all knew JD was gonna tank. Shit is at ATH on earnings day
cause üçî tech screwed me hard the last weeks
didnt he just say "he won" a few tweets earlier lol?
It was 20% the day of the listing and the other 80% only after the end of December. So the 20% was already sold at 8 and 9. That's it no more selling.
Hopefully I can sell my JBLU calls. Bought 200 JBLU $15c 11/20, when JBLU was at $14.08. JBLU trading at $14.90 premarket from its previous close at $14.16. Still a lot of time to hold my breath tho
Still a good stock to buy?
It‚Äôll probably be very very tight probably won‚Äôt know until a few days after the erection on Jan 5. 

I think blue win would do the opposite: you‚Äôd have a vaccine and comprehensive stimmy quickly plus subsequent inflation.
I don‚Äôt think this is a penny stock, they should be in it for the long haul
Afterwards, we should make sure it isn't overused for every mildly funny situation
They should ban u again with these kind of cringe comments
GPOR is the new ticker for all the HTZ guys
I'm thinking of taking a good faith violation in order to trade positions. This will be my first one but I believe it would be for the better. Is it worth it since I'm aloud 3 strikes?
It has everything to do with NIO. You think a CleanTech VC that made the bulk of it's founding principal on TSLA isn't balls deep in Chinese EV right now?

Is the hurricane coming or going? This map sucks
Bought mine early ü§°

Yeah
not saying tech will go down, just more sideways probably
Seen a bunch of you guys pumping it last week and I bought a handful of shares on that last red day but not enough.. dang
so a chinese palantir producing EV cars to spy on americans?
Not sure about tomorrow, but Nio stock price target is [$550! üòâ](https://youtu.be/NyNOiLDz3ak)
I believe in the company and the chinese market. It‚Äòs a huge market and Nio is doing ok. I don‚Äòt believe they are going to like $300 but if you look at Tesla and what they are worth then I think there‚Äòs room for growth with Nio.
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs gonna drill at open
!Remindme 6 months.
Isn‚Äôt the insider selling about to start?
I get clapped on market open everyday. It's not a slow pounding either..
Yo look up CBAT right now
300
That one guy made $42k in a day on NIO. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre here for.
Honestly if Boeing went under Lockheed would pick up 100% of the slack and it would work out
Why are all u retards missing spce and instead circle jerking over chinese fraud
We need some kind of abbreviation for laughing out loud

Blue has no chance to get both. Bullish
Look how it pumped when Pfizer made that announcement last week. If an announcement that an approved vaccine is out,  it's going to pump multiple times that.
Im guessing 265. I think low 270 by friday
There's no one who will sell PLTR do you get that? no one. 8% is held by institutionals, direct listing. Only upwards movements from here on out.
Just added to my watchlist entitled ‚ÄòThings I won‚Äôt be buying‚Äô. Looks great next to peloton!

Haha check it out on a 1 hour
Ayden McCloskey, 22, says he learned on the fly. The construction worker and Doordash delivery driver in Minnesota claims he lost $20,000 shortly after he started day trading in March. ‚ÄúI fought the Fed for too long,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat was something, as a newbie, that I shouldn‚Äôt have done.‚Äù So he changed course -- and made it all back. He says this agility makes investing fun in a way it can never be for a Wall Street veteran. ‚ÄúIt really is my life,‚Äù he says. The pros ‚Äúburn out because of the pressure.‚Äù
If NIO and PLTR would merge, we would have the perfect WSB money printer
What would BABA realistically peak at today?
JD noooooooooo
Slow down Chief, you're gonna need a spiffy resume and at least two letters of recommendation if you want to be his ball washer.
BABA was just starting to get going and fucking JD tanking that shit. 

fuck
I gained 42k in less than 2 years buying and holding the s&p500 options are too hard to make money with
Let's goooo
What‚Äôs everyone saying about the research on NIO. Worth investing at close tonight or at the dip? I can‚Äôt trust it but man I don‚Äôt want to miss it.
FSR 30 eow
I think puts on IWM make sense this week, its at ATH's, way over extended, and some profit taking will no doubt occur (esp. given lockdowns effect on small caps )
ü§°
Nice! [Palantir](https://youtu.be/XspP5RPoudk) is a good stock! üòâ
its not even a real lock down just more stringent restrictions.
I can‚Äôt tell if the hurricane is coming or going on this map
you hate money
Lots
So we still up or what? (3:57 AM MST)
FSR$
do you think elon is going to slowly absorb the energy of all these other EV companies with a vampiric aura
Puts at open
[deleted]
I think when the lockup ends it might dip till 14-13 range
When do you think we'll find out if it's blue or red that they send to Senate? I reckon that a blue President and Senate will cause a massive sell off to avoid heightened capital gains taxes.
Sorry he already stuck the markers up his bum hole
Cause WSB loves to baghold companies that have never made a profit after 15 years
Nah hinge is an even more attractive people tinder if you live in big cities

Uh earnings bro
Hey son I‚Äôm back with the milk
PLTR about to open at 20
Yeah that sucked
Yeah looks like it. Will have to watch how it does and sell if it‚Äôs on the way down.
I am kind of scared because a pump like this may lead to a dump, but it's really fucking hard to time the top or the bottom. Therefore, I might lose money both way.
What
It‚Äôs down 1%
Skynet is gonna make us tendies

you'll realize it when it's in the $30's. maybe educate yourself prior to that.

lmao!!
Jd just went KAPOOOOOOOFF
It was already superbly up.

I played it last week thats why I went BABA this week
The point is he isn't even alleging fraud this time with NIO.  His entire report can be summarized by "stock too high imo".  His claims of fraud have often been right and earned him his powers, but his claims of stock too high imo have more than often sent the stock soaring 1 year out.  He's using his market leading position to manipulate the stock short term, with the motive of making back the money lost by being a long time TSLA üåàüêª.  Add to that his wife's bf actually left him for a TSLA bull, and you've got all the hallmarks of a great Oxygen network movie.
Wrong move. It's only bulltrap when CNBC stops talking about Covid and starts promoting BBC ("Boom", "Buy" and "reCovery"). Until then, stonks only go up.
What the shit happened to JD from +7 to -5

I am the captain now.
Let me know your trades when you place them so I do the opposite

I love when autists put more than a years salary into 1 stock.
If JD is going to tank, just send the whole market down. I don't care anymore
F
Yeah it was up so much premarket, was kinda set up for a fall
YIKES wtf just happened to JD
Almost everything I expected to be the worst possible outcomes for the market this fall has come true, and we're at ATH. God I love the stock market.

You just got humbled into oblivion son
Hell yeah.
Maybe European and means his net salary
Ya what?
Siting on NIO since drop on Friday and solo maybe sell or buy more Wil lsee
I disagree. They have a high valuation and people are expecting so much from the game that unless it literally is the best game ever, it will not meet it. Production delays already. Release could be buggy. Risk/ reward not there in my opinion.
You think it will go up, or you believe in the company?
Sky high. üåï
They can't stop it
That‚Äôs a really mashed up bear. RIP though
Awesome
Many top companies were unprofitable for years , how many times do i have to tell you you stupid bears
Why are you retards so hyped about PLTR
No.
Why would anyone want to buy that lmao this sub is truly autistic
WA was one of the first states to lock down last time. Gonna be real fun watching all the other states slowly but surely do the same. Only do it one at a time though so that it ensures that the virus sticks around lol
44% yoy growth
Yea and on a Friday night before earnings of all time. Doubtless lots of calls got raped and expired OTM last week.
1.84% away from it.. keep going tiger!
Citron said NIO was a buy at $7. He likely helped to drive the price up. Take your tinfoil hat off, accept you lost your $35 on weeklies, and move on.
London Calling = superb album of The Clash
TSM is at ATH right now ... and seems quite volatile

Buying as much as I can of MGI.
I think we all know that a vaccine wont be available to the public til close to the middle of next year. The stuff I can‚Äôt stand though are people trying to find fault in some of the news like the ‚Äúoh it has to be kept at super low temperatures‚Äù crowd that we had. All vaccinations are stored at exceptionally low temps to keep the serum from degradation. 
People will believe anything to justify their positions but when ignorant beliefs move markets it gets shaky.
Whatre u talking about where are u seeing it down
what's after Tuesday tho?

Wait till you use bumble. They really aren‚Äôt kidding with the reference to fat bumblebees
Might as well switch so you can trade premarket...

Im buying SOLO today though, so you probably shouldn‚Äôt

Sounds like everyone involved is shitty. I just can't care for the rich at all.

They basically just buy revenue
if they can pump it to 25, id be okay with it. in at $10 with 2.19 24c

Any opinions for solo today??
Glad I grabbed a PLTR call just for laughs at open on fri, might just hold it to see what happens

Yeah I think travel, energy etc. will bounce up and down with the news but will generally trend upwards over the next few months.
I think their belief is ‚Äúsince they have government contracts they can‚Äôt lose‚Äù but they‚Äôve been around a while, are still unprofitable, and they donated a bunch to Trump in order to cozy up to the administration so now they‚Äôre losing their biggest supporters in Washington

That‚Äôs why they made sure to IPO before the election so the insiders could sell off their shares before the new administration can hurt their future business prospects by not relying on private spy agencies founded by Trump worshippers
1. That long term chart looks terrible 

2. Thanks for some intelligent DD

3. Thoughts on the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù boomer stocks such as this vs growthy boomerish  (read - not some Chinese coffee company or a space travel company) stocks such as a HASI, CPRT, BEP?
Legacy car companies also have a fuckton of cashflow, borrowing capacity and maybe most important: extensive production capability. EV's are the future,  but dont assume that all current market leaders will just watch as other companies take over their market share.
r/teenagers also ranks higher than r/wallstreetbets when the maturity of the users is compared.
How do I get into small caps?
bought calls last week, not worth buying rn

Hoping premarket is slightly green or deep red so I can get in for some discount calls. This shits going up no matter what.

NIO has strong puts, and the big calls got removed, more than likely it goes down.

You can't measure any of those things without biopsiying, anyone who makes those claims about a supplement I'd take it with a pinch of salt.

What‚Äôs the hype on PLTR?
Expect a ‚Äúnot ready for mass production‚Äù sometime in the next few weeks.

Haha fair point but I take the 4d chess theory. Trump talks up pfizer, moderna, Eli Lilly, and that makes a good amount of Americans scorn their vaccines.

Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of your butt. You have to start flushing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.
So now that we are not only expecting Moderna news this week but also Pfiser news by/on the 21st are we looking at an actual bleed up on leisure/luxury good and services? If the news is anything less than groundbreaking will we see such industries continue to dip?  My plays are pretty safe but I feel like people‚Äôs sentiment and hype will die off somewhere in early December..
Musk got the Rona... Buy TSLA calls??
Lol
What you talkin about? 90% of the comments here are just ‚ÄòNIO and PLTR to the moon!!!!!!‚Äô
Waking up to some nice TNA gains aaay /u/somanychins
Lol watch who your talking to fukboy my dad works for citron and Andrew Left. I can get this ship sinking any minute
You bought at 55?!
Unrealized losses mean more potential unrealized gain later. Diamond hands
This is the week PLTR creates a whole new generation of bagholders. Thiel wasn‚Äôt sure he would be able to dump all his shares at a decent price but looks like the sub is happy to take them
Lol watch who your talking to fuckboy my dad works for citron and Andrew Left. I can get this ship sinking any minute
My calls expire in May though.
You show me a pay stub for $59,334.92, I quit my job right now and work for you.

Maybe for tech

Not good looks. Put spreads always seem like a better choice if you ask me
Really makes you question why we even go to work üò´
Deep itm?

Or do you mean 3500?

I prefer selling weeklies, lil cash flow, and I get to reassess what's happening.

If you meant deep itm calls.. then you'd just have to make sure you're ok with getting assigned at that strike with the premium.

It's basically only downside to covered calls. At some point, you'll get assigned and have to live with only collecting the strike price and premiums, leaving possible gains on the table. Lot of options activity over the past couple years though, so the premiums are better than gains from just holding outside of enormous run ups.. which you can halfway avoid getting assigned on by selling weeklies and a little luck.
Thanks for the heads up...
depends on what your mom's in the mood for
It‚Äôs total manipulation. Don‚Äôt even try to fight it. It‚Äôs gonna drop like crazy. No investor is buying it, it‚Äôs just all algos and market makers

Yes and realistically it means that when Biden is officially the winner he will begin the transition but will miss weeks of briefings on national security and coronavirus, creating gaps in knowledge that will directly hurt peoples‚Äô lives 

By comparison, letting people attend a few briefings that there is a 0.0001% chance to not need is harmless
JFC if that $PLTR post won‚Äôt convince you that we‚Äôre in a bubble nothing will. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what they do something something government and data. It‚Äôs an easy ten bagger though.‚Äù

Yoloing on Nio knowing it‚Äôs an autistic stock that‚Äôs just going up is one thing but when there‚Äôs actual serious DD behind these retarded plays you know we‚Äôre at a top. Unloading my nuts into puts tomorrow

Want to hear something cheesy? In The Matrix one of the baddies says "You see? He's just a man." Thinking that actually helped me a lot when interacting with high profile clients and supervisors. Sometimes you get caught up in the systems and hierarchies built around us that you forget the other people are just dudes. The boss is just a dude. Go work with them, not under them. That mentality gives yourself leverage and really delevers the supposed clout the interviewer tries to give off.

People really expect a stock to be green 24/7/365. If that would be the case then investing in stocks would be so easy but it‚Äòs not. You can believe in a company and buy the stock but at the end of the day nobody really knows where it‚Äòs gonna go. Still think Nio will go up in the future.

I saw people saying they‚Äôd name their failure offsprings Nio
As someone who's blown up their account since april on puts. Fuck no.
those "hip" ev companies aren't in the retard vehicle game you fuckin imbecile
What a retarded boomer statement
They have something to do with data collection and covid tracing in a bunch of different countries and the CEO is bff with Elon
Has NIO hinted at introducing additional shares?
You retards arguing and speculating on NIO pre market lol...observe the previous intraday volumes, it make most of it‚Äôs run in the first hour after market open and is normal for the stock to fluctuate 3-8% during pre market, but if it does spike at opening I hope you tards don‚Äôt make the same mistake like last week and wait it out.

I think the Honda Retard is more than some "good news"
feel bad for you fucks who are at the mercy  of NIO

Is there a way in Degiro to choose which moves you want to monitor daily and say to cut your portfolio in two pieces? 

One that you want to see the movements every day and one where you intend to hold long term so you‚Äôd rather not see its performance every day.

why is NIO playing with my emotions
Bro what
I‚Äôll let it dry on my stomach and go to work
Same, I‚Äôve left money on the table a few times as well because really, regardless of what happens this week, this can be a long, long hold.

I‚Äôm bearish but have some hope for your position. If you assume it‚Äôs all out in the air, that we‚Äôre in at 0.125x leverage on a billion dollars going towards the EV space... Well that‚Äôs just about where the whole EV market is at right now haha.
Delusion
I am long on that one . Calls til December.  Bought a nice chunk of shares too
Have no position in NIO but the ensuing chaos in this sub is gonna be an absolute shit show if things go south lol

This is great advice. If you just show up on time with good attendance, over time it will be apparent just how many coworkers are just faking it.

Not a chance NIO ends red today.
You know you goofed when you're down 50% and but the market is up 300 points
I finally see how people here lose money
I want to get in but I‚Äôm scared
How low will zoom end up today? Three fiddy?
Oh it's goin down looks like it's going to struggle to stay above $40 and if it it breaks that we could see another -15% day
Nio to $4
nio is going to absolutely tank, get out now.

You‚Äôre right and there are but we‚Äôre talking less and less about that same mass infrastructure in 3 years the farther you go, though. It remains to be seen what will become of the model as well - swappable batteries, hydrogen fuel cells? And THAT is mostly reliant on whatever the manufactures decide to go with.
This entire subreddit is about to go bankrupt at open lol
Hahahaha someone just said nio is being pushed down cause of a 120 million buy at $42

My pleasure. Good luck to you!
Center of the Earth
Chief the markets looked at black friday as soon as the vaccine news came out. If anything we're gonna get a surge of black friday shopping leading to more cases leading to markets down 5%. 
The problem with every one on WSB is if there is a logical thesis as to why it will work, it's too late. The market already priced it in.
i‚Äôm trying to take some of that commie money and reinvest it in america. how is that unAmerican

You should never feel like that you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù for a job, and if your confidence is the issue then you need to change perspective.

You should look to understand that maybe you‚Äôre not going to be the best at it now, but you can learn and grow to be much more. The first step to applying can be the next step to being good enough for the next big steps. You can do this, and don‚Äôt give in to that anxiety.
Nio is back. Went from being a big green cock to giant red dildo to flatline
Yeah can't go wrong at all.

WSB is like max retail so this can't possibly go wrong now that every other comment is about NIO etc
 I‚Äôm just here to see unAmerican NIO bulls in shambles

NIO is jumping around this much in pre market, now imagine how it will be when the market actually opens lol
Looks like it'll be a rough premarket for WSB chinese EV bois
Real NIO bulls know that any time NIO has opened in the red it moons later that day
Checking my candles and Fibonacci lines, looks like AAL could hit $15 today
Alexa, play Slide by the Goo Goo Dolls.
Just checked the unpopular opinion one. And I only see people with the most standard opinions there. Defending lgbt, etc. No shit their sub is so **popular**, lol.
Considering I have my last 2k into 3 NIO calls, I guess invest in $ROPE
Palantir opening up 17-18 put money there . Big $$ tendies yachts and plenty of hookers if u do
Thanks king for the advice üôåüèª
My NIO PT is diminishing. Hype could be dead
Me too, getting ready to position long

Going in on half tomorrow if there is a dip, then save half for average up/down I guess

I apparently should have bought them after-hours when they dipped on earnings release...
That amount of premarket volume for NIO tho
Google it or lose all your money. Up to you, but you could have learned that in the time it took for you to ask that question. You shouldn't fuck with options until you understand what delta, theta, and IV are at the very least.
Looks like another vaccine news
Break $17 PLTR REEEEEEEEEE
U think it goes down today?

Downvote if you want, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm a fan, but once the price consolidates a bit you will be fucked. There wasn‚Äôt much of a crush after earnings, what does that tell you?
Bagholding calls is so stupid. Well expensive lesson learned I guess.
Something something government won't let them fail. Something something Airbus monopoly

Dude this place is a fucking cult. I‚Äôm really worried about what people are gonna do if this shit goes south
Woke up at 2am and started drinking again gang, wya
...why would there be a pre holiday gain? It's two weeks before black friday.... who's gonna buy two weeks before bigboi discounts....
Nio went from +5% to being shorted to earths core rip. Still buying at 35 tho
Well it was fun while it lasted....
Totally agreed. I‚Äôm sort if conflicted of whether or not Biden‚Äôs presidency will help or weaken them. I‚Äôm leaning more towards help. With the current administration‚Äôs sanctions TSM had to cut out about 15-20% of their revenue because they sold to Huaweii. If Biden is as much of a China shill as they say TSM may be able to dip their feet back into that market. Great for business, horrible for the US‚Äôs Sovereignty and independence...
Pls no cheek claps today
??
Yes
NIO holders on r/suicidewatch
lol go to sleep. Your calls will be fine in the morning
Hahaha die NIO back to $30 where you belong
Healthy pullback for NIO. It‚Äôs saving it‚Äôs energy for later
Why won‚Äôt NIO just go back up
After seeing the  millions of NIO posts on this sub this shit is hilarious to me
if you don't even care about quarter million dead americans, why you complaining about the kUNGflu, grandma gonna die one day anyways
Because robots don't have fine motor reflexes yet.

That'll be a bacon double stack and a medium frosty, my dude.
Rate my retarded bets: 150 $20C 11/20 and 200 $20C 11/27
Don‚Äôt chase either until they settle. Long term more likely win PLTR. Bigger potential win NIO.

I think he‚Äôs referring to ARK and Cathie who is very clear on the purpose of such an investment. 10 year timelines for disruptive innovation.
Just vaccine optimism I think, moderna is supposed to announce some shit on their vaccine today too i think
If you‚Äôre buying shares, it should be to hold for a while. PLTR is a long term play. I wouldn‚Äôt worry a lot about your entry if you are getting in today.
Looks tasty. https://i.imgur.com/12Hoxiw.jpg
Goddammit, NIO fading back into the red.
SoftBank is that you?
fuk off nio
Where did the green go
optionsprofitcalculator dot com
Who tf dumping stocks on BABA? Went from +.7% to -.17% for a moment
Definitely not a fad. Has been around for more than a decade and is getting more profitable every year with how easy it has become for kids to spend/steal their parent's money.
Many people working right now aren't good, yet they got hired. At so many places, just showing up is enough to get hired.
Ah k thanks
# BIG OOF ON NIO LMFAO
No idea how far it'll run tho.

I think between market and retail ppl are looking for the next thing to pump into as the market is looking for  the next growth stock.
This is absolutely the best TradingStation^(TM) I have ever seen.
Yo dawg
That was really comprehensive and informative. I wish I could understand any of it.
Is PLTR a meme or a dream?

Guess this means Covid is around to stay
hahaha, don't make money of commie stocks then, Papa Elon is the way
Going down like your mom 3 days before payday.
Sell when the event gets too close, when people expect the big climb... I think I hear you. Maybe I sells it soon
I saw this in the daily's, what are your thoughts on this?

[https://www.reuters.com/article/china-debt-soe-idUSL8N2I206S](https://www.reuters.com/article/china-debt-soe-idUSL8N2I206S)
I was just watching how each day it would pass 120 then drop and i noticed it was starting to stay closer to 120 after each drop. Plus i was speculating maybe a pre-holiday gain
pltr pumping hard
I respect that
same I have no idea why travel are being up, CCL +5%
Oh yeah thats a good idea. Thanks man.
I'm sorry for the retardment.

All green guys, buy Boeing, best meteorites EVER
man the fuck up .... if u feel your not good enough then get good enough!
Doesn‚Äôt matter because it will make you rich anyway.
That's EU retard
Don‚Äôt go too farm OTM ive been burned before. I‚Äôd personally buy ITM or just outside their running price to give yourself a little wiggle room. They may be starting a new leg up though so who knows. Just a thought.
GO NIO GO
A week from now, people will be wistfully thinking back to those heady days when PLTR was only $18 a share. FWIW like an idiot I sold $20k of PLTR last week for like $14.01 after a dip made me panic and I sold at break even. That‚Äôs life.
Why is travel up lol
I'd happily see Nio go to 30 so I could buy more but I'd be equally as happy to see it go to 60
good game != long term money making game

GTAV is special in it's ability to micro transact kids.
ATH last week. what more do you want?
Ive decided to move in PLTR for 750-1000 shares. What would be the recommended way to buy in? Buy all at open? Buy a few and wait for a di0 when ppl take profit?
Donnie gets Covid market tanks Boris gets it twice nothing happens  strange üòÇ
IPOB is about ready to blowup
Im going to do the exact opposite of what you autists say, but should I wait for a possible dip this week?
Don‚Äôt cry if you‚Äôre not on the PLTR train
No sleep gang wya.
I guess it took him a couple of years to bankrupt his first EV company, this one might last a little while longer yet
Wish I had a position with them right now but I‚Äôm in on CNK $15c 3/19/21‚Äôs. Still making money tomorrow though ;). After I cash out I may move everything into TSM $110 1/22‚Äôs. With Biden as pres we should see some trade restrictions come off of China which could allow TSM to work with Huaweii again. Could be a huge boost.
You sound like a little bitch
But it won‚Äôt because there‚Äôs no reason for it to. Hence, no references to fall back on if it would.
I honestly wouldn't play earnings on that at all.
its not even 7 yet and you fuckers are saying NIO is dead.
Think of it as a free money machine then.
They‚Äôre having problems in Germany as well they had some cars that were recalled due to some problems in Europe.
You were doing somewhat well until your sudden blast of retardation, what did you go all in on?
No, that‚Äôs where I think it‚Äôll be EOD, fuckwit.
It‚Äôs green
ive been watching them, but really?... another NIO? any sauce?
I thought NIO was going to be another IBIO deal üòÇ
ü§î TSM, good morning to you too.
It was up 6% a short while ago, now 1%. Heading in wrong direction
Hi really need help here, recently i been trying to apply for job interview but recently dont have the courage to do so i feel like i‚Äôm not good enough and why would anyone even want to hire me
So wsb is the pump and dump.
Why?
What‚Äôs your catalyst because 120 has been stubborn resistance
is +3% a good enough day or na
New kids in the US EV market are FSR and RIDE. And Rivian but they not public.
they don't trade options, it's a casino
NIO‚Äôs energy moving to PLTR
If you know you know
Still need to buy more shares myself, sending negative energy
[deleted]
i saw, also see SAB (banco de sabadell), up 13% today so far.

but it aint as good as you think, i used to have 57k shares of that, and i had bought them at < 0.30, and sold at 0.37 not too long ago

looks like they are just catching up to vaccine news really, not a big gain otherwise
Ahh that makes sense for some reason i thought they had 100 mill lol
I am aware of the retardation
Cutie
Ask the expert - give your mom a call.
Lol I mean just fucking google the ticker, the numbers are out there
I'm starting to think the only reason the market is up bigly is because of USD crash
Again,Boris Johnson? What a fucking pussy
Your probably right , I thought about it on Friday buy really didn't know much about the company. I wish I would have though.
SOLO just can't make up it's mind this morning
$ipob should be on this list
Didn‚Äôt get FSR calls in time but got some for RIDE and things looking real good.
They got IV crushed a tiny bit on Friday morning. I averaged down because the sentiment in here seems like it will be the next meme stock. By the end of Friday my calls were back above where I originally grabbed them at. So yea like you said, probably free $$.
Ahh, ya got me ya big kidder you
That's EU retard
What the fuck is wrong with you
It may not work until a certain time like 6am or something.. different brokers allow access at different times I think. It probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt to just wait until open tbh
Bro that‚Äôs the exact opposite of the time you should be chickening out
I think there is a chance to make a good bit in the next for weeks . I'm torn between NIO and PLTR . I know NIO is real hyped and probably a bubble but that's OK. PLTR actually has a lot going for it .
Underrated comment üòÑ ü§£
you probably can get away with it. but no need to re-invent the wheel, next time just put it on NIO like the rest of us
Still a lot of IV to crush in those premiums
It's over 45 you retard
Fsr until its not. Might get 20-30% before end of year
YOLO at 11am, the open will be crazy
FSR & Li
I plan on holding until the expiration
Puts for their quarter earnings
Uh huh AH premarket doesn‚Äôt matter same thing
#140
Don't be a bitch. Let's fucking go!
Gambling addiction is the explanation dude.
You're a mad man to risk that much but that's me. It will get there but that's pushing it.
They will print tim Apple got you
As if it hasn't been on one. Between the boost from PDD and ER coming up I don't see how it doesnt keep skyrocketing.
Yes
USD w the v shape recovery.
I had forgot about this company, I just placed some calls for tomorrow morning for December. Thanks üôåüèª
Anyone aware of LU? recent chinese ipo, doing pretty good.. has big meme potencial
I chickened out on SPCE somewhat as launch-time is getting very near. Could have added at least 2 more calls for a total of 6.
AAL with all that retard strength lol
If you gotta ask.. then you already know
Tsla
Ill buy 1 amd share to help you bro, much luck
It‚Äôs premarket not AH you degen
LOL NIO 40 EOD
F
All hands on deck now.. thing will pop anytime soon
At the rate we are going, Im going to be in the red as well. If it does go green, I'll try and help out a fellow autist

Even more reason not to.
exactly,  they're just reving up the engines right now
I give up on NIO Andrew left and his üêª army win. What‚Äôs the next NIO
500k gains in 1 month.. Oh man. I see why you got hooked to the strategy that wouldn't work long term. I've done the same before.. just not as much, but doubled 50k to 100k then lost it all.
*why you so down the market was up 300 points today!*

*.... NIO calls*üòû

*oh..*
PTF ARKK ARKW are the main ones I use. There are more segment based meme funds like ARKG ARKQ CLOU TAN QCLN CLIO

Just search for some of the meme tickers + ETF and you should find what you want. They usually aren‚Äôt great for options though due to the low volume and wide bid/ask spreads.

its up 6% right now
No
You right but high tier US lockdowns def aren‚Äôt priced in. Not that I think it‚Äôll happen.
It‚Äôs super farking early. The volumes are small. If you think PLTR is home calm down. If you think NIO Is gone calm down

well part of the problem was that it was too complicated for me to understand. so you are saying Ginsburg was a pedo

ok now I agree. sorry I am kind of dumb
Make sure you do a limit buy, market orders don‚Äôt work pm
Fuck you NIO go up
Order type: gtc_ext
I swear by all these comments like this these people have only been on this sub for a week. Guess because most people lose it all then don't come back here lol. Fresh rotation of newbies constantly
SPCE
What ticker?
The unfortunate aspect is the people who loose it all. I think the money stops becoming real when ur doing silly shit on RH all the time. Many people dont realize the value of the money they have till they see it in reference to something. But addiction is addiction.
$37.22
What a greedy fucking position lol. I thought I was a big Palintard.
# NIO fading faster than my dream to work on Wall street
Take it to the nio thread.
Thats it, I‚Äòm going in on FSR at open
JD Powah
Bc Jack Ma is being waterboarded in the back of a Chinese government building right now
Fucking nvda. If it doesn't moon this week I'll have to find a way to make up for my losses. And I can't do that because I'm a pleb. Fuck.
NIO 50 EOD
Palantir sued the Army in 2016 in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for what it says was an unlawful procurement solicitation for the service‚Äôs next iteration of DCGS-A that shut the company‚Äôs commercial offering out of the competition.

Super TLDR gov is bad with money(/corrupt), wanted to pay more to have others produce a worse product. Lawsuit worked once but others are being considered for future deliveries as well. Raytheon is in direct competition for the DGCS-A contract. Keep in mind it‚Äôs possible daddy gov continues trying to throw more money at their favorite companies instead.
I feel like it's like FedEx and UPS. Booming business means the same for the other
Goddamnit it I can‚Äôt wait for this dumb stock to moon
Take it to the nio thread.
Just occurred to me - that billionaire dude that made a massive bet against the market, he probably did it because he is over extended on calls and hedged against a possible downside...
11% up AH smd
I drive a Mode 3 and have never used a blink charger. It‚Äôs super chargers, ChargePoint and way behind in 3rd place is suck ass EVGo.
USD is gonna be worth my toilet paper after I wipe my ass with it in 2025
I know it‚Äôs not what we do here, but I think shares are the better move with the high premiums.
marketwatch
SOLO about to go negative after up 7% earlier
Why not play earnings even even if it‚Äôs just 5% of your portfolio I believe it‚Äôs worth the high risk high reward
Don't think you realize that the rest of the world is way worse
Thought $MRNA was way too obvious of a play that it's 100% priced in but apparently I am faster than the market sometimes
So mean üòû

don‚Äôt rely on Robinhood pre market data - Check Webull. some stocks like amzn and fb haven‚Äôt updated on rh
RKT has 1.98b shares outstanding according to TD
Ya... but my CCL opened up 30%
And then down and then back up again
I bought a Mode 3 in March and other than super chargers, ChargePoint is the best experience. Their app shows all the other brands so ChargePoint is the only app I ever use. EVGo uses a card with RFID chip instead of Apple Pay, so that‚Äôs annoying. Their branding is ugly and looks cheap compared to ChargePoint. I‚Äôve never used blink chargers. 

I‚Äôm definitely going to be stocking up on this while it‚Äôs cheap for the next few years. Imagine buying Exxon stock while everyone was still riding horses.
I love to see TSM get closer and closer to $100/share. Its slow moving but damn near guaranteed that it will hit it and stay above. The company fabricates chips in EVERY IPhone on the planet as well as those inside of your computer. This company is GOLD
JD caps at 205? and takes a break to 203 and back to 215? By my charts I could see it going to 215

I‚Äôm balls deep in FSR and RIDE
personally witnessed this with GME
Lol JD is reporting earnings in a few hours. It will drop soon
My new strategy is to keep buying PLTR leaps every pay week
Already rode it up for those 2 days then dumped it.
We did, when Tesla was rallying the fuck to mars and back
At this rate NIO will definitely open red
[deleted]
You know how robinhood makes money? they sell your orders thats why when you buy the stock goes down. Quit buying my stocks you fucks
Why the rest of China having a party while baba big sad?
tesla so stable that it might get added to SP500 soon and when it does, it's going to moon 0.69%.
Next time I‚Äôll be ready. I just have to be twice as retarded
they can be both.. pretty sure +80% in a month is winning
PLTR GANG RISE UP MOOn WE COME
Look at AAPL. Stuck in its absurd $115 to $120 channel for weeks. Have no idea when it‚Äôll break $125
There are momentum ETFs. IMO ARK‚Äôs ETFs do a nice job with the better meme names.
[Small account but I got most the meme stocks](https://i.imgur.com/xGUiNO3.jpg)
Tesla before the stock split is the best
I regret so hard selling my jd calls last Friday
They‚Äôre called meme stocks, Not winners
I‚Äôm accidentally holding 15k in calls expiring this week through earnings. Thought they were next Friday  ü§°
no son.
SOLO went to 7% up now down to almost flat
[deleted]
It's been the trend with tech. I actually bought pltr at the top before ER and it tanked - 8%. I know eV's have shot up after er. This unreal price increase in the last month feel too good to be true. I got burnt on spce when it got pumped. I'm wary since of massive pumps
We should use emoji to counter the algos üá®üá≥‚ö°üöó

yea sold some @16.32 doesn‚Äôt want to buy it higher cuz I‚Äôll feel like a bum
https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BYND/
110 open üíã
JD and SE pumping bigly in premarket. Sell at open?
Classic WSB move by so many people here: Buy PLTR at $10.50 on first day of trading. Watch it shoot up to $12 and think you're rich. Watch it proceed to tank the next few days and panic sell at $9. Now buy at the top
11 and 17 is nothing when it'll be at 100 eventually
I sold call for a loss
GUH
Just as deaths from COVID are increasing as cases skyrocket. Hmm.
Someone needs to start a meme profile
Selling my December JD calls bc of my paper hands is one of the worst things I've ever done
Tits deep in calls bb!! Give it to meeeeeeee!!
imagine TSLA didn‚Äôt split, it would get hit by a few pullbacks but it would still have the same volume as before

new TSLA so boring, I miss old TSLA
This is not anything confirmed. The board members may decide to sell in lower volumes, in which case price could jump even higher.

However, the employees would still unload though.

Thus, there would be volatility surrounding this event,  so it would be good to sell puts surrounding this event.
If the price drops, you get assigned and buy more. If it jumps higher, then you are still a happy person.
RIP
Tried buying premarket through saxo, doesnt work wtf?
I'm pretty confident it's coming, but expect it to be too late for my plays expiring Friday.

SE got that RCEP trading bloc boost!
This sub has been pretty good with identifying winners... first NIO now PLTR, which stock is next?
Whatever price the stock you‚Äôre holding is at rn doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Remember last Monday? Tech was mooning all night. My NVDA calls were ripe and ready as it was up 3% premarket at 4am. 

NVDA opened down 2%
Positions or ban
Yes, 100% downswing, and it's not even about better financial reporting (I'll explain below). Short term puts on BABA are free money. BABA will hit $240 and maybe even $200-220. Singles Day is behind us. Everyone knows how much revenue BABA does. The only news out is Xi and now fucking Trump. That's going to put a lot of downward pressure on BABA short term. Since you have LEAPS on BABA, you should be fine...but RIP to anyone holding short dated calls (even a few months out).

Let's look at it from another angle: what good news could come out that would cause BABA to soar? Unless they come out saying they're doing $1 billion/day in revenue, nothing. There is nothing to propel the stock forward until next earnings report. The recent Asia deal (which was a pretty big deal and a big win for China) did nothing to BABA's stock on the Shanghai stock exchange. In fact, BABA is down further 1.5% on the day. Now look at the bad news: Xi fucking Ma. Xi fucking large cap Chinese companies (like BABA) with regulations. ANT IPO delayed at least 6 months and at half the valuation. Trump now threatening Chinese companies, and who knows if that will be limited to just military companies. See [this](https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-to-enact-series-of-hardline-policies-going-after-communist-china-in-final-weeks-of-administration-report). Unless Trump somehow blocks US investors from investing in Chinese ADRs, BABA is a great **long term** hold...which is why your LEAPS are probably fine (if they're for 2022-2023). But I (unfortunately) expect BABA to be in a world of pain over the next few months.
Here we go bby come jump on the amc train
Probably not. Kinda flat right now
BABA pls wake up.
Yyeeeesssss bb ü§ëü§ëü§ë
Buy to close, set limit for the ask.

OH MY GOD DILLY DILLY

Hey, drink some water.

how could you monetize privatization of police force? human rights lawyers would sue corporate police? would private police force do asset forfeiture and shoot people? if gov police cant run efficiently with public funds, how would private police be able to make profit?
Let me pull out my time machine and check
I'ma need CCL to drop 10%, thanks
PLTR is bull trap
Y‚Äôall NIO retards, we diversifying and buy PLTR at open. I think 30% PLTR calls, 70% NIO calls is the best portfolio
Fuck it. Buying PLTR at ATH.
# look what you retards did. PLTR was up 11% then you retards had to spam the algos
RemindMe! 7 hours
Fuck but I wanted more PLTR
Why is it going down like Stormi Daniels on Trump?
never said I used them or they "work", just said he didn't draw it properly. the only "interesting" retracement is 50%, which is not a fib number

Not all the shares are available to the public. Many are still held privately. They are going to do a fuck ton of secondaries to get shares on the open market
DONT STOP
They're terrible people doing terrible work, so presumably they will succeed. More the big company run by the asshole than Pied Piper.
Nice, what are your positions ?
7am I think
PLTR WTF

Massive dildo down on Monday, uppsies to close the day 0.16%up. Fake Peak based on Mango pointing to concede on Tuesday/Wednesday.
Kangoroo on Wednesday out of uncertainty. EV excitement on Thursday again. Positive spike on Friday, flat during the day, MASSIVE selloff. Everything goes down.
It‚Äôs fine. Buy leaps
Roll baby roll. This will pull back a tad at some point and you can buy them back

My PTLR 15.5c exp 11/20 gunna print
Wow, I‚Äôm actually going to go over this in more detail tomorrow. 

Honestly I may be abit out of my element here because of the things you stated aswell as being Canadian. 

Well I hold a couple hundred in RKT right now and the fact I know of the company as a Canadian was already a good sign. 

I‚Äôm going to see if I can disprove any of your points through more research and if I can‚Äôt I‚Äôll reevaluate my position. 

I  believed because of their original low prices (from what I saw online) they would obviously get good referrals and repeat bussiness but if what your saying is true ( which seems like it is) I may have been steered in the wrong direction. 

Either way a couple hundred in my portfolio is something I can take a loss on, I knew that I wasn‚Äôt extremely knowledgeable in the field and actually have been testing my knowledge by stirring up these comments on Reddit üòÇ 

Thank you for the long and detailed response! I appreciate it
I‚Äôm bullish af and have calls but I don‚Äôt know about 60 EOD lmao..

How do I sleep when I have my entire portfolio in JD and Palantir and I'm constantly nutting
Yes. Here in Hong Kong. Although Tesla‚Äôs and Lamborghinis still dominate
Tech is fucking dead
And I should‚Äôve just held my pltr calls I sold for a loss
Too late
Huh, TIL

Ty
Normally, I‚Äôd tell you that‚Äôs true. Here‚Äôs the problem: airlines are deep in debt and passenger rates won‚Äôt normalize until fall/winter 2021 at the earliest, with business travel perhaps never coming back. The name damage for Boeing is also virtually unprecedented. I can‚Äôt name a company that‚Äôs suffered so much reputational damage without going under.
NIO going down... fake pump
Really? I could see this being huge.
You gotta be willing to sell them too to be rich. Most people here will struggle with that end

At this rate NIO will open at 50 and shoot through the 54 it saw on Friday.
Its a little confusing though ill admit

Green all the way, $60 here we come
PLTR I‚Äôm not selling covered calls on you anymore bb I want you
They don‚Äôt work at all it‚Äôs just lines placed over candles which will never predict when and how many people press what button. 

It‚Äôs zero sum where the money comes from later investors when will you learn that lines cannot predict that
EVEN if you're right (you're not), money is money and there is a massive market for cheaper products. Why do you think AliExpress does so well? They sell shit makeup for $2-20 and kill it. In a decade or so, BABA will do more in annual revenue than AMZN.

IP protection and innovation doesn't mean shit. Look how much smartphone market share Apple lost over the years. Is Apple the best smartphone on the planet? Yes, without a doubt. No question about it. And yet, Samsung and Huawei overtook Apple.
15 percent of posts on stocks are "this user was banned for using terminology related to wsb"

Are you sure this will cause a downswing? Because the only thing that was talked about financially was the need to make their financial reporting more transparent. Sure this is bad for other Luckin Coffees but this is baba, even if their numbers are fudged they should still be great relative to their stock price. I could see an argument being made that this actually causes it to go up. Disclosure: leaps on Baba
NIO GANGGGGGGGGGGG

NIO gonna be $50 5 mins from now
Um hmmm

That red dildo is a big cock tease but man did i get a half chub
Thought it was Pizza Hut, no?
Depends, are you doing a hand stand or bending over?
11/20 is the expiration date for the contract, $50 is the strike price and the little c at the end just means it's a call option. Hope this helps
Yeah makes sense
God shut the fuck up you minge ass wanna be fortune teller go stroke my magic balls

Andrew Left (and any other funds that have been short TSLA) have lost any and all credibility quite a long time ago. 

Besides, we all know the real reason why he hates TSLA, and it has to do with a buddy named Alan.
We crashed in March cause we didn‚Äôt know how mild the virus was. People were panicking and thinking the worst when it came to Covid. 

Now we know it‚Äôs just a boomer killer, and pretty shitty at even doing that. So we‚Äôre not gonna crash just cause of rising cases.

I've got a ridiculous amount of BABA shares, too much for my liking now. I love the stock but man, this shit is always supressed because it's a Chinese stock. My average buy price is around $265. You know how long it's going to take for BABA to get back to that? A year, at least. BABA is getting fucked by both Xi and Trump.
I'mma suck u off personally if I see that number by this year end, that's a Christmas gift for u.
Thanks man, absolutely blows. If it gets worse I‚Äôll def do that for the moment I have enough stuff to relieve symptoms so they‚Äôre slightly uncomfortable but not dangerous

**Please help me understand this. Appreciate it and may your YOLO today wins! **

If you own and want to buy more of the shares, are selling puts or covered calls for extra income the better option?

If you own say stock ABC at $100 and sell a $110 Call for $1 premium expiring in 1 month. If the price rise to $120, you make $11 but lose the share. If the price falls, you get $1 and still own the shares.

If you sell a Put for $1 at say $90, and the price rises, you keep the $1 profit. But if it falls to say $80, you lose $9 but can still buy at the $90 which is cheaper than it is now at $100. Not forgetting you want to own the shares in the long run. 

For both cases, if the price stays the same, you get $1, and can still buy the shares at current price.

Am I understanding this right?

Not so fast. This was the case yesterday and two days ago but not anymore. There are rumors that Trump is **further** trying to limit investment in Chinese companies. If that happens, stocks like BABA are fucked. Double penetration from Xi and Trump.

Alright, listen up retards and autists. Everyone‚Äôs been focused on NIO lately just as a meme with no basis and because of this, no one‚Äôs paying any attention to other stocks so here it is, it‚Äôs time to bandwagon onto the Boeing train. Sure, it‚Äôs a boomer stock but profit is profit. The rally has already started but there‚Äôs still time to hop in, Boeing‚Äôs anticipating their re-certification as early as this week, and if not, before the end of the year. It doesn‚Äôt matter right now if it‚Äôs hard selling planes, travel hasn‚Äôt reached back to 100%, or a vaccine isn‚Äôt distributed. What matters is this is Boeing‚Äôs reentry and it only goes up from here as this re-certification has been blue balling them for nearly two years.

Unlike most of you, I like making money but I‚Äôm not trying to blow my entire account in weeklies so I‚Äôm picking up longer dated expiration dates, it‚Äôs on you if you want to go shorter for more risk, more reward. I am, however, looking at picking up more short term calls, looking at 1/15/2021 BA $200-250C range.

Got over $60k at the moment riding that Boeing‚Äôs going to go flying and looking to add a few more calls at open, let‚Äôs get it bois, this is the way.

tl;dr: Buy 1/15/21 BA 200C to 250C, profit.

Those with weaker hands: 6/18/2021 BA 200C to 250C.
we got this bro üí™

Man, BABA should be at a minimum $300 stock, and my thesis didn't change until a few hours ago. Not only is BABA getting nailed by Xi, there is now fear from Trump to clamp down on Chinese companies, and I'm not just talking about his recent ban on Chinese military stocks. Check [this out](https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-to-enact-series-of-hardline-policies-going-after-communist-china-in-final-weeks-of-administration-report). Any short term (1-3 months) puts on BABA will print, which sucks for me as I have a pretty sizable bull position in it.
Bears, bulls, can we put aside our differences and agree that anybody who says ‚Äútheta gang‚Äù is fucking gay and should be banned on sight
Okta
Same tax year or diff? If it's same tax year they just net together. So youll have a taxable gain of 27k

If diff years.. Hopefully you paid the taxes on that 87k gain already cause uncle sam gonna be looking for that bill.. They don't care you lost 60k the following year. That future yous capital loss. They want to fuck you right now.

The opposing forces have both gotten really strong. The buffer zone of demand for dolla dolla bills is still accommodating but that might falter in the next year. To me, seems like it‚Äôs dancing on a knife edge rn and when it falls either way, it‚Äôs got a long way to go. 

My money is on high inflation because that‚Äôs what the Fed wants and American economy basically requires at this point but I‚Äôm definitely hedged (as much as I can be) in my grown up account for serious deflation, too.
With Trump's personality he has already put himself in a situation where there is no way he can back out of. Admitting he lost + admitting he was wrong....he won't do it.

Over the next year? Hhmm not too sure about that. Maybe weeks, months at most. But year? Nah.. my opinion of courseüòÅ
oh don't need to worry about us, we're doing just fine
There is a lot of displacement happening. *Vehicle* insurance has been insanely profitable because no one is driving. Health insurance is a mixed bag because lots of expensive policy holders are dying (good) but lots of people are requiring expensive care (bad). Random accidents way down because fewer people are taking silly risks right now. Fewer people traveling = fewer claims but also far fewer travel policies. House values are way up but risks are the same so it *seems* like home insurance is becoming a lot more profitable. Insurance companies aren't really offering income protection insurance anymore, but existing policies are obviously not so profitable.

I wouldn't count insurance out. People still need it - maybe now more than ever. Just consider which companies are best positioned. It's difficult because actuaries are a black art.

Before you go short, get an understanding of inflation (no, not those bullshit CPI figures). Look at the dollar index. Think about how much money we are printing, and realize that the stock market isn‚Äôt rocketing on a *real* basis. Betting against stocks is to bet that the fed turns hawkish, and that‚Äôs a suckers bet at the moment.

What are your thoughts on the game so far? I bought it and honestly haven‚Äôt been a fan. I used to be a battlefield kinda guy, so I loved MW19. Cold War feels like BO4. Wish I could return it

NIO going elevator up. Now up 2.1%
So like many previous days. Futures start strong with Nasdaq higher than S&P.

Nasdaq continue bleeding till open and starts flat. S&P keeps building gains and drags Nasdaq eventually with it to both end green with S&P higher than Nasdaq.
Nio +2.13% ...where you at you fat bears? You will be skinny soon
Stonk move bigly fast
You know you‚Äôve made it to the boomer part of the internet when the comments start talking about prayers.

I knew that citron fake report would unsettle the algos and start something - ve for nio. It was a house of cards. Just get out early after I've sold all of mine then we can go back in lower

They're dividend stocks. Most charts aren't imputing dividends into return. They pay great dividends. It's the reason everyone incorrectly circle jerks about how poor Japanese stocks are performing. They lean heavily on dividends over there.

I've started investing in the last 18 months and only in the last 6 weeks I decided to switch from index funds to individual stocks. I'm up 50% on nio and bought pltr at the top. Hope this pltr will be my x3-4 and I can ride the eV game
just as fake as the numbers on the screen ü§°
If today NIO reaches 50 I will sell and buy NIU
It's Renaissance, everybody there has a Ph. D and were high level mathematicians or computer scientists before being recruited. These shares could be a "momentum play," but probably part of a delta-neutral options strategy based on volatility than price movement.

For every one mcg Buprenorphine you'd replace that with 18-28mg of oral morphine, following manufacturer's guidelines. It's also a terrible pain control option for nerve pain and only provides minimal reduction in my feet  and hips - it was swapped with Codeine due to me being on 120mg of that a day and the side-effects were not nice.

I am already on Duloxetine (30mg) and Venlafaxine (300mg XL) having been on gaba, pregab, and amitriptyline previously. I also had adverse reactions to Tramadol and was hospitalised with the beginning of serotonin syndrome.

Congratulations, the only thing that could stop you from winning big is a market crash, as AMD has a much larger supply of launch gpus then Nvidia ever had (no paper launch) and there will be shortages of them due to sheer demand, looks like a massive win.
Best of luck
Nio -89% in zimbabwe
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
I mean you are already up 6x might as well sell. I don't think you will get IV crushed as much, your expiry is in 2 months. I would wait and see, NIO could rocket still given that pension funds are buying nio. So yea wait and see how the earnings goes I guess

Really I don't think we would absolutely need any more of the float the get locked up with the totally bonkers levels of shorting going on anyways. It would sure help though haha

There is absolutely zero mathematical advantage to ever exercising a call before expiry unless dividends are being chased.

Left is probably the best short seller in the world over the past decade. And if he‚Äôs not the best he‚Äôs pretty damn near close to being number one. His sample size of picks over the past 20 years proves that he isn‚Äôt just randomly guessing if a stock will go up or down. Whatever his methodology is works, and I will believe this until he‚Äôs constantly more wrong than right over an extended period of time.

Chinamen are experts in scaling things up through lack of regulation and disregard for human dignity, this is Tesla's biggest shortcoming. I wouldn't be surprised if Nio didn't dominate the Chinese market in 2022.

Those are euros bro
42c 11/20, reaaaaallly wanting to sit through earnings, but if it hits 70 before, I'm probably out.

I get that share buybacks are an indicator of a company being profitable or at least having extra cash on hand which is a good thing, but I am also reluctant to view a history of buybacks as a reason to invest. They get played off as management seeing value, but there is also usually an incentive for them to pump share price up (for which this is one lever) and there is the issue of management bias as to the value of their company. 

Buybacks can be just as harmful as good.

What does NIO have in its business model that warrants its absurd valuation as a car manufacturer?

It‚Äôs supposed to be the ‚ÄúChinese Tesla‚Äù but Tesla‚Äôs valuation is arguably justified because the EV car manufacturing is a portion of the business model. It‚Äôs also in battery tech, solar tech, EV charging tech and autonomous driving tech. It also has Elon.

Was curious how 2008 looked and I noticed there's usually a spike in selling around Nov 12th which was the date that spike happened last week. Around March 3rd also seems significant.

The last time there was selling above the 500 level was Nov 14, 2016 which would've been a horrible time to sell. The market didn't revisit that level until the bottom of the crash in March. I guess people sold after Trump won that year. Nov 12th was significant even on non election years.
I had 1900 shares and I sold a covered calls on 1500 of the shares for a credit of $220. (I made $220 if GME stayed below $9.50 but it didn‚Äôt)

I didn‚Äôt think GME would go above $9.50 and it went to $14! 

I was forced to sell $15,000 worth of my GME stock because I‚Äôm an idiot. 

Basically fuck covered calls

Short selling actually provides price support when nobody else would buy. Those sho1rts will buy to cover after -10%... longs sell off harder the more it drops 

Uptick rule is a joke anyway.  Unless the borrow rates are triple digits it's getting shorted tomorrow.
The drawback to theta gang is no small accounts. I mean you can do spreads or other shit but the wheel is the best,and you need a good enough sized account to make it worth it, otherwise you can't diversify in different companies or have cash aside to average down if something drops. Or you can sell naked but that's just getting pennies in front of a steam roller when it goes against you.

But in short, we just sell you your fd's, and if they print for you we still get the money you gave us.

You don't get it, theta gang doesn't lose. We rally hard I sell calls, if we drop then I sell puts. If I'm wrong I still don't lose, I just get assigned and collect more premium next week

the breakeven is still higher than my avg cost per share, so I am securing my shares from bear market and gambling on PLTR going down so I collect max premium while maintaining my shares. Would rather gamble on stonk going down this week after a recent 50% jump.

We‚Äôre gonna open higher move up and then crash down today or Tuesday. Debt market tells the real story futures are bullshit. You can all keep buying along with the rest of retail though.

I'm not sure but it seems like a Grey area. It's similar to spoofing but isn't. It's illegal to put in a huge order to simulate a large demand and then remove your order before it's filled. This though he seemed to just constantly be adjusting his bid as they were moved.
that was a sad period of market news, even worse than the stimulus talks

That‚Äôs true. The main issue is if there‚Äôs a bad enough event you won‚Äôt be able to roll down without locking in a huge loss. The reason she says it‚Äôs dangerous is that the market is high and if there‚Äôs a big downward move you could get caught out and blow up your account. Imagine you hit max loss on all your spreads. Would you lose more than 15 or 20% of your portfolio? If so, you‚Äôre probably taking on too much risk.

Which is it, you'll remember about some post we accidentally removed for months and be mad at us or that we should decide exactly how many posts each stock gets and remove the ones that annoy you, but also not the ones that will go up.

There's no conspiracy. We're retarded. I wish everyone would stop assuming we're pinning DD (or hiding it) for some personal gain or because we get some gratification out of removing posts.

I think I remember the post in question. Wasn't it some retarded two sentence post that nobody would have any idea would be good advice? Do you think we should just allow any DD through and have the community vet it.. sorta like.. auto pinning it with a "you can remove this as spam" bot enabled?

I know but walmart is really gunna have to slay earnings and while I think it'll be good idt it'll moon enough to offset IV and prenium
"... There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares ..."

How did you come up with the 80% figure ?

According to finviz ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR)) there are 1.52B PLTR shares outstanding and 969.28M are float. This means that approximately **36%** of PLTR stocks will be available for trading once the lockup period expires, . This is far less than the 80% figure mentioned in this post. 

Hey retard, stop pulling numbers out of your ass.

Just FYI - you‚Äôre always at risk of getting assigned (I.e someone exercising the leg your short), but you‚Äôll be protected by your long leg (at least capped in losses).  But if you‚Äôre closing your contracts prior to expiration (NOT letting them expire), the bid-ask will eat into your profits (making the trade less attractive). In all cases, don‚Äôt hold to maturity unless they are far OTM. I believe people have the opportunity to exercise their option until 530PM ET on day of expiration. The problem is you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre assigned until much later (so if you hold to maturity, someone could have exercised and you are assigned, but you didn‚Äôt have a chance to tell your broker to exercise the other leg and you are naked on this position going into the weekend). And, if the shares are in a hard to borrow stock - you could be charged some outrageous borrowing rates (for example, I believe NKLA‚Äôs borrowing cost was like 800% per annum immediately post merger, so you holding something Like that over the weekend will cost you)

Narrator: it wasnt

Doesn‚Äôt matter, it isn‚Äôt about the citron report it‚Äôs a combination about the valuation being extremely speculative (NIO could definitely justify the valuation in time) plus the crazy recent run, which both lead me to think there are going to be a lot of people selling to lock in profits on the run up. I think the first real sign of weakness in the stock and it‚Äôs going to sell back to a valuation more in line with where the company is now.

I think there are also a lot of people who FOMOd in and will be easily shaken out by a big downward move.

Can‚Äôt wait for two months from now: *Stimulus Talks Are Going Well Part 2: Electric Boogaloo*
Having a position where you always need to be on top of your game will make you cut out frequent excessive drinking. I'd assume daily domestic responsibilities (kids, parents) would also curtail that activity. Plus the older you get the greater the diminishing returns are for adding either frequency or volume. The stability of fitness and consistency in your health take over.
imagine being a üåàüêªthis year, if I were one I would've learned after 2 months or already lost all my money anyway

If you don‚Äôt hold to maturity you should be okay - otherwise you are bearing assignment risk. I.e. you get assigned one leg of your spread after market closes, but your protection expires without exercising. Next thing you know your holding a net short position in a stock over the weekend, it moons Monday AM and you lose all your money and more (go see the story of IR0NYMAN). 

I will say, your bearing a lot of risk for limited upside
If you aren‚Äôt greedy on credit spreads it‚Äôs highly beneficial when IV is through the roof.

The new vaccines coming out fix the moral problem of running the economy over lockdowns because they will be applied under emergency use authorization to the most vulnerable people first. The news that the public will be vaccinated in mid/late 2021 is not relevant since hospitalization rate is ridiculously low in healthy people.

The result is the general public will continue to experience exponential transmission, but hospitalizations/deaths will plummet if the vaccines are indeed 90% effective. The economy will then be free of moral obligations to begin its ACTUAL recovery rapidly once Pfizer (and others) obtain emergency use authorization. This means any successful publication to an accredited medical journal will SHOOT RECOVERY STOCKS TO THE MOON.

Not nice because you still have $498
felt guilty with all those gains and thought you should give some back?
never
Make one then.  Sit around titching people aren't providing youtendies quick enough.
No
I believe your thesis is bullish. 
Then I'm pointing out a very likely scenario in your thesis. 
Once Nio moons on Tuesday or Wednesday past 60, your spread will carry negative delta, with high theta decay and high gamma risk.
(So you essentially become a bear, but a very greedy one with limited profitability but unlimited loss potential.)
why, whats good with baidu?
I smell a pump and dump.
Will DKNG ever stop cucking

I honestly don‚Äôt even know about earnings, i‚Äôm out now after riding it up and got lucky af Friday when it dipped hard. No doubt NIO will be big tho

I pretty much drink daily (whiskey) I'm in my 30s.

I almost never get drunk enough to have a hangover, but when I do I definitely regret it.

My method of dealing with hangovers is to drink orange juice and water, pop 4 advil, and go back to sleep. The wasted time of a hangover can't be fixed though, that's the best reason not to go overboard.
The target prices are in yuan check every other Chinese stock on CNN you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm correct

Drink less on the nights you drink and make sure you‚Äôre having plenty of water and something salty.
With Dow inching to 30k then yea
Good for you! I stopped drinking this year, 2019/2020 had me in a bad place. About 6 months sober now.
diversify what u drink, liquor is super draining on the body. have wine some nights or beer
But...space
Nice try, but i prefer adderall

Of course it's rigged and manipulated.  Welcome to the markets and welcome to Chinese stocks.
Looks like value is back. Tech underperforming badly last 4-5 weeks
Fatality count is like any other year with the flu.  Market always rallies during the holidays.
Did you not hear about the yugghhhe Asian trade deal?
i dont drink anymore, not worth the after effects for what your get in the moment. weed is a different thing tho, you can get blasted and wake up refreshed the next day.
ETFs? Fuck off back to r/stocks
I used to read r/wallstreetbets a lot. With no post. Thought it was a good idea over drinks and now making it happen

FUk credit spreads
Lol trust me they‚Äôre not. If you follow Chinese news it‚Äôs way worse
Do clean energy ETFs instead. $PBW or $ICLN holds Nio & Tesla. $LIT for Tesla too
ur a real jerk eh?
I enjoy your company as well. In a sexual way.
I'm not advocating for anyone to take a serious position in it. It's a highly speculative pile of cash, selling for 8x it's cash value. It'll likely go to zero, as will most of the EV paper on the market today.  But in the interim, it's a momo play that may have put in a short term low. Good luck
We all know that the market is forward looking. Palantir‚Äôs positioning and product is pretty stellar in my opinion
Then stop playing
Right here jag off.

You'll get to the point where you don't get hangovers, and drinking only gets you to a certain point.

trust me better to just quit. binge drinking is just as bad if not worse than chronic drinking imo. my body is permanently fked from just binging on the weekends. i quit drinking 5 years ago but i aint recovered still.
I quit drinking because nothing good came from it. Only drink water now. Been 3 years
Tl;dr some dumb fuck talks about IV and doesn't mention anything technical

Vote to have this dumb shit removed
AMZN please don't disappoint me
When I drank I would rarely get hangovers. At my worst I was drinking every day, starting at 4pm. ~20
shots a day and some beers. I don‚Äôt drink anymore.
one day you will get super drunk and throw up so hard that you have spots around your eyes and look in the mirror and you'll feel like you're dead. then after that you'll never want to get drunk again. you'll have a few beer or a few shots to be sociable and thats it. 

source: adulting
True. But if you‚Äôre worried about that possibility then you can get cut the entire call side and replace it with your lotto plays or whatever your desired play. At the least, the put ratio spread reduces your cost bases and allows you to buy on a pullback.
Just stay drunk. Can‚Äôt get hungover if you don‚Äôt stop drinking

It wasnt the money. to me a tip is a tip. I get to decide the amount of the tip. if you want $35 for a haircut just list it that way.
There is zero proof that actually getting the virus gives you any sort of protection or future immunity. A vaccine (pfe) seems to give you protection for some yet unpublished amount of time.
I think those companies have turned a profit at some point.

They have a flight coming up this week. Flight window is 19th-23rd. Stock has resistance at 22.50. If it breaks that which it has in the pre-market (which obviously could change) next resistance is $24.50 then $27 and so on. It is looking similar to February where it went to mid 40s.
Do you live in Parma?
Well it sucks for me with the outgoing video sometimes lagging especially if Outlook is open too, plus it has no use case specific stuff like zoom has for medical and educational use cases
God damn it can they just stop posting NIO already? Jesus fuck Everyone who was in already made bank, and it's time to go for something else. STFU
It is fuckin crazy. Lol. Looks like also snatched up about 7-8% market share from BABA during the singles week sales. I know that's not part of Q3, but still looks great.

The more dangerous/lethal strains of the virus kill themselves off overtime. Think about it. If you were the virus and you kill your host, you die too. If your host dies, you cant spread out anymore. 

The point of the virus isn‚Äôt to kill the host, it‚Äôs to use the host to spread. The only way it can keep spreading if you keep your host alive. 

So overtime it becomes less lethal.
You stop getting bad hangovers when you drink regularly

I will assume you will put this on for close to zero.
I will give you a word of caution.

The short legs will expand very quickly once the price moves past the long leg.
While I assume you will do weeklies on this, but you essentially need diamond hands to let all the extrinsic value of the short legs bleed out (like Thursday), or else you would need to exit the position at a loss. 

Do you have the balls to have a (naked) short call at 70 for an entire week? Maybe you do.
It's me, I am complete idiot

If I remember correctly, it was Rand Paul yelling at Fauci during a testimony saying that New York‚Äôs case count was low at the time because of herd immunity. But the context was that he was talking about why everything should open up across the country
I remember in 2016 when I was like, it's not like he's going to just print money.
hahahahah my whole portfolio says no to that, but then again, last tuesday 20% of my shit said good bye
I did qqq then looks better
NIO has 144x the volume...
Yea there's a bunch of those too but the fact that they have 93% delivery in 24 hours is just absurd to me and a big moat. Here I have my amazon deliveries being shown as delivered while still not being delivered for next few days.
no guarantee the lockout will cause the price to drop

i posted about the lockout here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PalantirInvestorsClub/comments/jupt2z/discussion\_form\_10q\_palantir\_lockup\_period/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PalantirInvestorsClub/comments/jupt2z/discussion_form_10q_palantir_lockup_period/)

in my opinion when we get closer to the lockout expiration (early next year) there will probably be some nice buying opportunities, look for dips and stay away from weeklies
To give the people hope because we are so fukt and the world elites don‚Äôt know how to handle it yet
Nice try on the narrative. Citron was the OG NIO protagonist before hardly any Americans had ever heard of it. This was also well after the divorce which has nothing to do with NIO.

Herd immunity is natural... a majority of the population gets the virus, and then they become immune. We‚Äôd have so many dead people in the USA, it‚Äôs impossible and irresponsible. A vaccine causes immunity without getting the virus, so it‚Äôs much safer.
Quick look.. not quite as insane as going against WMT here, but I still wouldn't bet against TGT rallying on earnings here unless WMT experiences a significant sell off after solid reporting.

Lol. Bout to rn
Honest question - maybe someone can help me out here. I remember Fauci and other experts slamming anyone who recommended herd immunity as a good way to deal with covid. They said herd immunity wont work. So, if herd immunity wont work - why are we wasting time, money, and resources on a vaccine?

Nope. Big win
The one in wuhan was a much deadlier strain. The virus mutated and two separate strains were found. One deadly but less contagious, one less deadly and more contagious. The more contagious one became the dominant strain we see now
The reason why I am going to become a millionaire is so that I can restore balance to a world that has lost it. Honor to the fallen. Compassion to the sick. Justice to the corrupt.

Im buying puts, because no way mms let all of ur calls print during earnings
nahhh not fun enough, $SPCE is the move üò≥üò≥
ah does this mean tsla will go up?
The worst part about this week is that we have no idea if/when Moderna will announce. They said end of month but Fauci said by Wednesday and news articles are saying within days without quoting where that came from

Like vaccine news is a good thing, but I would love to have an actual date set in stone
I'm gonna laugh when NIO opens at $95 tomorrow

Is anyone actually curious why the market is ass-fuck green despite horrible ‚Äòrona news? 

The short answer is the Fed doing Fed shit.

With their money printer they ensured it‚Äôs a dumb idea to hoard cash. While at the same time fucked the bond markets. There‚Äôs nowhere else but stocks for smart money to go.
5 bucks says DOW ends 29.9k and Tuesday will be the ultimate rug pull
I think you're right. Was looking at SDC after ALGN earnings. Might have to play that sumbitch.
i‚Äôm talking about the viral videos where you saw people walking and then out of nowhere just fall to the ground.
So if nio doesnt move at all what's the $$
Yolo that buying power into $NIO calls at open tmrw and you‚Äôre in.
Loser
Didnt realize this was China
I was thinking the same bought a few 12 calls in case it goes parabolic
My calls matter
They can't hire all the best engineers. They will require a high level security. Meaning people with no debts, no criminal history, US citizens, no drugs. That makes the pool of potential people small. I work at a DOD company and we have good engineers but it's not some next level Tesla Google engineers who also have access to the world's talents.

i heard an interesting theory today about that. a lot of the very severe strains of the virus died off with the people who died. now we are seeing a more contagious but less severe virus.
that‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm talking about

I think if you see an opportunity there you should take it but static websites like that are easy to build but the real effort comes from making it match the design each company wants which means scaling it would be super challenging. You'd end up having to make the designs very specific to each client wants down to the pixel. Wish you the best with it though if you choose to go forward with it
You have my approval. Bitches love TGT
Probably sells puts. Buffet seems like he‚Äôs a part of theta gang for sure
Yeah ur probably right.  In fact it‚Äôs such a shit stock that any fund manager worth mentioning is loading the boat with it right now.  But you go ahead, sell your entire position because it‚Äôs down this month on some political bullshit that has nothing to do with their projected growth.
I might pull up the chart. I was thinking of puts on WMT with the run up, but it's breaking out. I have a feeling the TGT charts are similar, and you'd be insane to bet against it at this point.

Thoughts on NIO tmo:

NIO will open red and continue to go up and be green after earnings.
they have security clearance problem. Lots of restrictions on the people who could potentially work there.
holding puts over the weekend probably has the same success rate as i do in trying to get a date with a pretty girl. wont happen tommorow and probably not next week or the week after that.
Nah.
Hospitals got overrun. Basically happened in Italy. Rest of the world had enough head start to mostly avoid those scenarios. I‚Äôm surprised India was not a nightmare. It also seems the disease did become less dangerous.

So in other words your judgement is clouded and you‚Äôre unable to consider this objectively ...possibly
it's part of your job to foresee news stories that haven't happened yet, imo. its one of the ways you make money. so if theres 1 story then there will be more, imo. just like stimulus coming soon. there was 1 story and then there were a lot more.

I‚Äôd dig into that. How many they sold, average benefit length, benefit characteristics, how many are uncapped etc. That can destroy profitability, and in a dividend stock that means dividend cuts, which will destroy your share price as well.

I would argue that technicals are more overbought than bullish. Some bearish divergences on the monthly and weekly timeframe as well

That being said, SPY will probably hit $440 by March and double within a year
Probably a smart choice. Selling last Monday would have been a smart choice too but here we both are
At this point, there's really no difference b/t 0 and 600.  
Just put it on a 0DTE SPY position and try to multiply it.  
Worse case, you'll have a quick and painless death.

The technicals, seasonality, and money flow is wildly bullish. At the same time I can't shake this feeling that the market is whistling past the graveyard here with Covid seemingly becoming more disruptive and Trump refusing to concede.  


Seems like there's a significant amount of uncertainty lingering in the air, yet money wants to pile in even with prices at or near all time world record highs and valuation metrics flashing "new era", "this time it's different" type multiples.

What you're describing is swing trading, which is what I do. I'm no expert, though it's been working well for me, I'm at 52% ROI. A lot of guys on WSB are about lottery tickets (extremely cheap OTM weekly positions that typically expire worthless or very rarely make a ton). Swing trading is fun because it gets you involved in grownup shit, you watch the news and think about how it affects things. For easy money, right now, just place 2 - 3 month out calls in PLTR at the end of a day when it ends red (\~-5%).

Also, a ton of companies are gonna bump big as more goood vaccine news comes. And a lot of companies are gonna fall as covid numbers stay at an all time high and people realize the pfizer vaccine isn't all that. For example, why the fuck did Delta bump so high on Friday? Holiday travel? IDK. I expect some bad news about covid cases to negate those gains, but who knows when.

Oracle is trash. Only reason they got the bid was the ceo being a trump leg humper.

The IR started in the late 1700s and into the 1800s, with massive reductions in poverty as a result. Your dumbass question (I know you can't remember more than one comment) was "what had a larger middle class...?" making the utterly ridiculous comparison between the 1800s and mid 1900s. Poverty dropped massively during the 1800s and into the 1900s where there was generally at least some attempt to hold to a gold standard, with varying degrees of success.

Yes sir, the market takes what Citron says very seriously. Just hope that NIO pulls an ENPH and bounces back up soon, which could definitely happen with an amazing ER on Tuesday.

Isn't that what the last 4 years has been?
No one who matters is taking Trump's claims seriously. He can sue all he wants but the things with courts is that you actually have to present evidence. This is very clearly him just fleecing as many of his idiot supports for "legal fund" contributions as he can. 80% of repubs believe there was election fraud so that's a pool of about 71M Trump voters\*80%=56.8M people he can try to squeeze a few bucks out of them before he goes.

He'll then announce he is running for 2024 for the same reason. He's gotten addicted to those campaign funds.

If I'm wrong, the markets will panic. Him actually still being in office Jan 20th is not priced in. Even if he is actively being dragged out personally the market won't care if there is no viable legal avenue for him to stay.

Even by WSB standards, this is the most tinfoil, convoluted premise for a trade ever. It's not rocket science - company is valued at over a million dollars per car *projected* per year. They would need at least 10 times as many cars to start making any sense. Maybe and quite probably they will sell that in a decade but auto manufacturing doesn't exponentially scale like tech.

Fuck Oracle. When I saw information about the deal with TIkTok I placed calls and lost $250. Not bad but I doubt the deal with go through because China would still retain majority ownership. Also they have a court case of copyright infringement pending with google that‚Äôs being played out in the courts right now. Last thing- long term Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll remain competitive in space.

20 k is like nothing in real life money. You're going to earn and loose 20k 100 times in your life. You didn't have 20k yesterday, you have it today, you don't have it tomorrow. What's really important is whether you are here tomorrow and in good health with happiness. Focus on things in life that make you happy. Because money comes and goes like it's nothing. My problem is the only thing that makes me happy is money.

Based in America. Has a visionary as the leader of the company.
Most importantly, Tesla is making a shit ton of money. tesla only went up crazy after they started posting back to back profits and beat expectations by huge margins. Nio is still losing a shit ton of money. And it's up 2000% in a few months time without making any profits and probably wont make any for a couple more years.

China‚Äôs economic recovery strengthened in October, with consumer spending picking up steadily and industrial production and investment rising faster than expected.

Industrial output rose 6.9% in October from a year earlier, versus a median estimate for a 6.7% increase, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. Retail sales growth accelerated to 4.3% from 3.3% in September, though missing expectations for a 5% increase.

 

The data shows China‚Äôs recovery is well on track, supported by stimulus policies, strong export demand, and the nation‚Äôs success in containing the spread of the coronavirus. The People‚Äôs Bank of China on Monday injected more liquidity into the financial system, helping to maintain the economic recovery.

Read More: [China Provides Banks With Cash, Leaves Interest Rate Unchanged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QJV7XEDWX2PZ)

Consumer spending is catching up after a slow start, complementing the industrial-led recovery. Retail spending received a boost from the golden week holiday last month, though many shoppers also delayed purchases to take advantage of the [Singles‚Äô Day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-10/singles-day-bonanza-may-herald-return-of-china-s-consumers-khc9scf9) shopping festival in November. In the first 10 months of the year, retail sales were still down 5.9% from the same period in 2019.

The recovery continued to broaden out in October and growth is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter, Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters in Beijing. Catering revenue rose 0.8% from a year ago, the first increase this year.

Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong, said he expects growth to pick up to 5.5% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% in the previous three months.

‚ÄúThe strong part of the economy (industry, investment and exports) remains strong but is also around the peak,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe weak part (consumption and capital expenditure) is catching up.‚Äù

>What Bloomberg Economics Says...  
Looking ahead, growth is expected to stay robust through year-end and into the first few months of 2021. The recovery in consumption and exports should continue. Against this backdrop, we don‚Äôt see a compelling case now for further general easing in monetary policy -- either a cut in interest rates or reserve requirements -- this year.  
\-- Chang Shu, chief Asia economist

Central bank officials have recently raised the issue of [withdrawing stimulus](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-06/china-starts-thinking-about-stimulus-exit-as-economy-recovers), although they have said any adjustment shouldn‚Äôt be rushed. The liquidity injection on Monday came as concerns over tighter cash supply sent China‚Äôs benchmark sovereign yield to a one-year high last week. Adding to the stress was also the default of a coal miner, triggering [worries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/panic-in-china-s-credit-market-spills-over-to-financial-stocks) over the health of state-owned firms and their lenders.

‚ÄúChina continues to move closer to its potential growth,‚Äù said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. ‚ÄúAs the growth outlook remains positive, the authorities will prioritize reforms over stimulus.‚Äù

Cool just bought 100k.
There really aren't that many quantum algorithms with superpolynomial speedups over classical algorithms and a major class of quant algos were recently discovered to be classically solvable. The power of quantum computers for tasks beyond quantum simulation (for chemistry etc.) is likely to be limited.

And from all the research I‚Äôve done I‚Äôve seen it come up a few times about how WMT effectively prefers to keep its underlying around the $100 mark, so we could possibly see a split in the next 12-18 months if they do manage to hit $200+

I never did that. I said Republicans spend too much as well. I just have spend more time talking dems because you are going straight for Rs, who spend too much as well. Its a bipartisan issue. One party calls for higher spending and wants to continue spending and expanding the gov faster than the other. Both are wrong. I can only tell you this, I can't comprehend it for you.

Honestly though, Nio is better than Tesla because instead of charging the battery for an eternity, you change it. They truly are the future

BABA mooning in HK
what's the point then you retard we already have WSB
Wrong sub
BAN!
It would be a lot simpler if they just made a bot to add a disclaimer every time he posted.
You're better off not saying that to embarrass yourself
Ban.
Leaps would be safer bet if options

i'll schedule that examination. maybe theyll find a huge brain tumor like McCain had, kind of explains a lot of his policy
Exact same thing as WSB - no mods tho
I've learned not to be greedy after market opens but I really hope we open at SPY 365 üò≥
Seems like there are still bears being born. Don‚Äôt be a bear, be a üåà bull. Sell covered calls. That‚Äôs üåà enough honestly.
U going to learn the definition of ur name
I‚Äôm up $40,000, some of my calls were up 400%, too lazy to post
Made companies extremely profitable
Tight as a drum
Are futures really a good indicator of the next day's market?
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely possible. It‚Äôs my top allocation for my stock portfolio right now also
Most deaths level off at -6ft
Could be. Growing up in NY it‚Äôs not like a staple. I grew up mostly with Apple pie which is also a top 3 pie.
Are u daft man or just late. They were HAMMERING it up in here just 2 hours ago
The market is wrong. You are right.

Im not in a rush but thanks for the info. I have my entire portfolio riding on NIO. This gonna be my biggest trade ever. My last big trade was 8 thousand. If NIO pushes a lil bit ill be rolling in dough ü§™
There's a 30% chance it's already raining.

buying some puts on SPCE after it runs up at open... the same thing happened on 30 May when the falcon 9/crew dragon launched astronauts from American soil

last time I was holding over the weekend and I didn't sell, then ended up losing a bunch

SPCE is not SPACEX: yes, it will run at open; no, it will not last more than a half hour, if that.
Your editor probably added that for you
Where is it that you work?
somebody needs a hug
I'll be the first one laughing at y'all when NIO goes the way of Chinese coffee

As a NIO holder myself, I agree.

 This market does everything it can to fuck with what you think should happen. This is not new, but I‚Äôll be damned if it doesn‚Äôt happen all the fucking time. Futures never used to move this much either, since March though it‚Äôs not uncommon to see 1 or even 2% fluctuations.

bears about to gape big
Doesn‚Äôt mean much given he has a month til expiration. I was down 50% on options I was holding and ended up selling them for 100% gain

You dodged the point to return to some weird vendetta you habe against Detroit like it's some aha moment. That's one data point. Most Midwestern and southern states are held up by a shoestring from California and New York's taxes. These states that scream for smaller government are the ones directly benefiting from massive subsidies and wouldn't survive on their own.

Also you've very quickly veered from it being a two party problem. Fascinating.

Can't wait to be a true cuck and yolo NIO tomorrow.
Diamond hands those bro
I like the ones that have different textures you can feel
Yah, I know how you feel.  I'm still kicking myself for being too chicken shit to go long on SPY right before the election after seeing the divergence.  Every day it kept climbing but only on Futures movement (air gaps all the way up), and every day I want to get long I just can't pull the trigger because we're nearing ATH and there's almost nothing below us but air.

I'm still relatively new to this and I can't figure out why we keep gapping up.  I mean unless the rest of the world is pricing in stimulus right now either Covid Relief or Biden trying to get his $2 Trillion Green Energy policy through.  Either way, seems premature at this moment.

How are you supposed to exercise options after hours and sell off those options in premarket trading before market drops 30 minutes before open(generally best to sell around 4:30-5:30 eastern time). Aftermarket volatility is tits.
The candidate isnt a noob tho he was VP. But yea

I'm holding some January calls with a 105 strike price #yolo
One thing that‚Äôs been so weird the past month is how in august if we were bigly green we would just stay green for the day and kinda consolidate a little bit, now it feels like I have to rush and sell all my calls at open before we drop 2%

Tldr was at the beginning of the post... to hedge against long positions and a way for people to make money while sitting on a flat stock market(markets generally don‚Äôt move much and the options sellers usually just sell covered calls or puts with a strategy to buy the stock at a given point or take in 1% profit every 2 weeks). That is why you usually see the market move in the opposite direction of heavy call/put positions
Don‚Äôt sell yet.

Meh, I think it's overvalued as a "buy and hold" right now, but the concept is nice. My wife got one because the 0% APR and monthly subscription fee combined is cheaper than a gold's gym membership + cycling class pass and it's also convenient because she can work out in the morning before work without having to account for commuting to the gym and back in her morning routine. It's a solid value proposition and the pandemic only accelerated that. Not to mention we'll probably have gyms close again in the US in January once Biden takes office after a record number of cases from people visiting family during the holidays. They'll probably have a national stay at home order to curb the rona trend for a month until the vaccine can be distributed to the most at risk folks.

Mostly non-leap plays, save GE:

GE 1/21/22 $12c ^($0.98 ask)

CCL 1/15/21 $17.5c ^($1.69 ask)

SNE 12/18 $95c ^($1.20 ask)

WMT 11/27 $157.5c ^($1.38 ask)

Hoping for better entry, but also not so much that they all look like a downtrend.

Puts on your eyesight.
my opinion is u need to be pullin atleast 200k/year in ny or cali to be considered a small time baller. i used to make low six figures at one point and i was struggling in nyc...not sure about the rest of the country but gold diggers want expensive bags, jewelry and high end restaurants. definitely cant do it comfortably on a 100k salary.
For each contract i paid, a premium, $2.58 a share. Each contract is 100 shares. So each contract is worth $258.
If things go well for me tomorrow my next move is gonna be 1/15 $15c's

In any case, you're correct, buying a put is loss limited but low probability and you will almost certainly lose that money either on this trade or within a few more

If you are set on doing this, I would suggest paper trading to see how you do first. And continue online study

Market gonna melt up this week. Test 365 easily. Maybe irrational rip to 370. But Friday is big option expiration... if too many calls open and ITM then MM will pressure market down Thurs/Fri.

If in doubt go to the doc/urgent care and they can evaluate you. Don't take this as official medical advice, but usually if you have normal range of motion and no swelling you should be clear. However your description is kind of weird so if it doesn't improve with an ibuprofen or NSAID after a good nights rest you should consider some kind of doc/nurse. However if you press down on your snuffbox (google the pic) and it's tender then DEF go see a doc asap.

Futures went up since Donnie claims victory
Trump kind of forgot that he lost the election
I agree. A lot of the times I‚Äôve written down a play and then started doing DD it‚Äôll randomly jump and I honestly give that particular play up because I‚Äôve already missed it and if I end up buying in is when it suddenly reverses the gap up it just did just in time for what I bought to be way upside down a couple hours after I bought. 

Like, last Wednesday night, about 9:30 MST, I wrote down ‚Äúsome SNE 1/21/22 $85c ($12.60 ask) to $95c ($8.30 ask)‚Äù as an EoW buy in (usually buy my bigger leaps EoD Friday because typically everyone profit takes from the week and they‚Äôll drop to a  decent/good entry), and then Thursday morning SNE gapped down like a whole $1 (which is where I should‚Äôve just bought in, but I‚Äôm stupid and didn‚Äôt). Then, Friday it decided to gap up $2 within 20 minutes of open, and then by 1pm EST it gapped up another $1 to $90.05. By that time, the 1/21/22 $85c, that was $12.60 on Wednesday, jumped to $14.80 ask and became a terrible entry. So I missed out on ~$200 and now I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs gonna retract back to $85.50 that it was last Tuesday the 10th, or if it‚Äôs gonna keep gapping to $100 like a lot of people say. 

I just know, that if I buy in now, at ATH basically, it‚Äôll do what always happens to me and gap back down to $85 **AFTER** I pull the trigger. Hahaha. It‚Äôs a fucking mess out there, my dude.

Right there in your link says Andrew has been shorting TSLA, and like so many other short shorts was burned.  Now he's trying the same crap with NIO.

Didn't know she died, feel kinda bad.  However as an investigator need to ask was it related to covid obesity or just coincidental timing?  Perhaps foul play related to the spousal support payments?  I don't know, just asking questions.

The only thing we know for a fact is that Andrew was a TSLA short seller because his wife's bf was an early TSLA investor.  

It wasn't just the glue from Grimes, Our Lord and savior Elon was right about these short sellers.

In the NIO report he even has the gall to use TSLA as the reason why he thinks NIO is overvalued.  Fuck you Andrew!  You don't get to do that you piece of shit.

We've been through lock downs so people know what to expect and therefore, the fear isn't as great as before. With vaccine news and possible stimulus and the Fed, seems like we'd need a new, deadlier virus to hit at this point for the markets to drop.
I have puts. It will print. Mark my words or free blowies on me
the smart move is to just watch as your profits slowly bleed away and the calls expire worthless.

"But we worked hard our whole lives for it!"

Yeah so will we but you'll suck it dry way before we get to tap in.
Priced in.
No. Not until you‚Äôre at -$100,000... only then you‚Äôll be accepted
This is just getting embarassing for everyone involved now
All I need now are 5 consecutive limit ups and things are lookin prettttay good.
Sorry, I don't know. If I knew the timing of these things, I'd already be rich.
Well said man

That Twitter disclaimer is hilarious.

"Official sources called this election differently."
Maybe I'll finally let go of these evfm bags
First you need to learn how to clean up on aisle 69
I do. I buy usually 2 month out contracts at the closest.
Amd calls!!
The wall on NQ is unbreakable https://imgur.com/a/TEsxXRJ
So he's coming here?
And then we will sell and re-buy again under 23.
You can‚Äôt just say it

Oh it will when everyone gets wioed out tomorrow
thats why you buy puts when you see it being spammed in here, Torpedo Trump
Wait i already work at Wendy‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on?
Hope so
They will totally print this week and next week. I‚Äôve concluded most people on WSB don‚Äôt even understand what VG does and how promising their future is in a pretty short time frame. They just go ‚Äúmeme stonk her der‚Äù
Saw what the guy above you said and told myself I will learn it when the yield start mooning. I think I have some of them in my boring bank account.
Hey some $JD also bruhhh üí™

"What's your move tomorrow?" Deciding whether to sell these calls for monday profit or hold out and lose it to lockdown fears.
Places going into semi-lockdown again (Michigan, NYC) and futures blood green. U wot?
Twitter is a retarded tech company
That would be incredible. Thank you for your sacrifice
Lol

Chamath is that you
Too bad I was smart and sold puts so when the market continues to go up, I'll take those who bought puts to the cleaners..

Ohh have you not watched The Expanse yet? Great show, available on Amazon.

Zombie JPow would be better. He could print through the night.
Chill Trump........ Jesus Christ. Can‚Äôt believe we have 2 more months of this shit.
TSM is up 4.75% in Taiwan stock exchange. My TSM calls about to fucking print big time
Anybody know what happened?
Kinda sounds smelly
How did McDonald‚Äôs become a billion dollar company? It wasn‚Äôt selling 25 cent hamburgers. It was investing in the real estate of which the burgers were made. Nio‚Äôs business model is factoring in baas station which will require space. If I were a businessman I would know this and we‚Äôll, I guess you know where I‚Äôm going with this.
Fake and gay S&P futures will pump to 3650. Then the fagot algos will sell
He's laying it on really thick. I don't think he believes this shit at all.
I think it'll happen this week (I live here). Right now, we (Chicago) are on a stay-at-home "advisory." Gyms, salons, etc. all still open. In fact I'm getting a haircut Wednesday, though fully expecting it to be my last for a while. I bet we lockdown Friday after shit starts to pop off this week
Please stop tweeting ü•≠ I beg you
You've missed out on a year of crazy.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything to buy. Just about any half decent web developer should be able to scrape up the same thing in a couple of days. Larger companies will have a CMS so that all they have to do is chuck the job descriptions, etc. into it and then that section of the site gets populated. A CMS you would have to pay for (or hack together yourself).
 Every time I read stupid bear shit like this I want to buy calls.
Buy a Highlander if you‚Äôre shopping for a Traverse
Congrats man! You might be a cripple but you have two big balls - which I didn have lol
SPY eow predictions?
I rode it up midweek and am now sitting on puts which means it'll moon to 600 eow
I hate that when my Spotify comes on in the car it picks up where I left off at the gym. Relax pal I‚Äôm in the car we can pop Taylor Swift on.
Right because NOW the stock market Is a tight circle, after becoming a massive global participant network, with MMs competing for tiny edges and people all over the world trying to make a buck. Makes sense. Maybe CEOs are just really fucking good at their jobs and we don‚Äôt realize how hard it is?
Ah yes Aladeen aladeens again
At least you're an expert in something

Samesies. Don't fail me now unfounded optimism
üòÇ Getting these guys excited for no reason
NIO 70+ eow let's fucking get it bois
I JUST REALIZED THAT IT WASN‚ÄôT CITROEN CARS THAT BACKED OUT OF A DEAL.  When I saw Citron dumped NIO I just assumed...
FUCKING LOL
Damn looks like these NIO $5 puts are gonna print ü§§ü§ëü§ë
Lol in order from presidents who contributed to the national debt by percent increase the most since 1970 it is:

1) Reagan

2) GW 

3) Obama

4) HW 

5) Carter

6) Nixon

7) Trump

8) Clinton

By dollar amount, which is a bad metric because it doesn't take economic factors into account but still proves my point, top 5 is: 

1) Obama 8.5 trillion

2) Trump 6.7 

3) HW 5.85

4) Reagan 1.86

5) GW 1.55

And that's not counting inflation (damn HW) or a national recession crisis stimulus package, which, by the way, Obama only had a 10% increase request than GW did. Not exactly shooting for the moon.

And again, where are Clinton and Carter? Wild stuff huh.
Not GM cars that‚Äôs for sure. Wife has to do a presentation on EV buying experience for GM soon and was asking for advice. We‚Äôre driving behind a Traverse (2014-16 model) last night and saw a big-ass rust spot just below the liftgate handle. Not even 10 years old and there‚Äôs rust. Maybe they should start building decent cars that don‚Äôt fuckin rust 5 years into ownership instead of worrying about ‚Äúbuying experience ‚Äú. I have an 03 Camry winter beater that spent more time outside than Casey Neistat and not a spot of rust on it. Puts on GM ‚Äúquality‚Äù.
Bezos will just put them to work in Amazon warehouses. Stock will jump 200% and tens of thousands of workers will get laid off.
I love his energy
jesus, sounds like DT gave up adderall for jack n' cokes
Man it should be really easy for Twitter to kill off the bots, when there are paragraph responses within 10 seconds of a tweet how is that not setting off alarms
Neo
Most underrated movie you ever saw? Me it‚Äôs Paid in Full

I don't see how these lockdowns don't push the stimulus talks going well into phase 2
I know man. Just have some exit strategy.
It's midnight !!!!! Muhahahaha
Usually any mid sized (funded) company will contract a firm to build their company site and a large sized company will just build it in house. The firms that are hired likely use some standard templating company that match the requirements set forth by the company
The only time my portfolio grows is when I deposit money in Robinhood...
The real tell will be when europe opens, I'm thinking we melt up, cases in Europe are starting a downward trend
