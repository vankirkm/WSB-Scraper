No
If Trump would have just stopped fucking tweeting, he could have won this.

I don’t think he wants to win this.
What's stopping people from becoming volunteer counters and just not counting the votes they don't agree with? I imagine if you're a volunteer your kink is probably politics so your likely not neutral. I can't imagine there's not some people that have bad intentions volunteering.
It’s a blowout rn
He’s leaning in the key states

Yes you are retard
So are mail in ballots really mostly pro-Biden or is that fake news? How do people even know? Polling?
Idk man. I am just a gambler
Even if 100% dem not moving the needle. So far Trump has the highest gap vs contender in Florida in the last 3 elections

My Nevada mail in ballot showed that they had to received by November 13th or something.  So it might be,  yea.
I just realized you and I have had like 3-4 convos today and I’m pretty sure many in the passed. I’ve gotta figure out how to follow someone on here.

Tech call holders.
Both Wendy’s and Scott’s Miracle-Gro are headquartered outside of Columbus, OH. Ohio is kind of a shithole so definitely going to be bad news. Buy calls.
They’re not listed as close, though. Hopium?
why are retards here saying trump is winning, he’s got way less electoral votes than biden (118 vs 209), am i missing sumsing?
Uncertainty
The Donald has been pretty quiet last few hours, tomorrow going to be wild. Strap in you degenerates, pick your pony and watch in awe as the world burns.
Bro Joes been in bed since 8pm
All I know is that if Trump wins, there will be memes for the next decade about how the polls were wrong again
The SEC should investigate Nate Silver
2% left to go dumb boi.
Both of those states didn't count mail in ballots either. A huge amount.
Someone else said DC too
CNN needs to stop lying. This shit is over...

Pennsylvania is home to the gay bear festival, and you guys don’t think Biden will win. Come on man!

Do republicans have a chance at the house wtf are these numbers I’m seeing 👀
Lmao, wins the election dies from celebrating with hunters Ukraine scontay
Schools and educational programs tend to be expensive.  I will spend everything I make to ensure my children are well educated.  If you make more, you can spend more. So far its working out pretty well.
y'all really aren't good at anything else so why not
Wrong
Election still up for grabs, but I think we can confirm the voters for Kanye truly represent the retarded lifestyle.
Wait so what do I do
r/politics closed their daily thread. What a bunch of cucks.
Makes sense thank you!
Both- it's called a strangle.  Or a straddle if you don't like a bunch of numbers.
I think in 2016 maybe? Again, that’s so hard to say because as unfair as it is to label him an outright socialist (I don’t think I’ve seen him call for literal seizure of companies, anyway), it’s a moniker that doesn’t fly with older voters that lived through the Cold War, Dems included.

From there, sorry boys
1.6 million mail in ballots for Dems. 580,000 for repubs. 260,000 NPA. So like split that last one.

1.7 million votes for Biden vs the 700,000+500,000 current lead Trump has, probably will stay at that level.

64% of uncounted ballots are in counties Clinton won.

Biden wins in this not improbable scenario.

Do you even electoral college
The process to break a 269-269 tie is incredible.

Goes to house where each state gets one vote (not per rep, 1 per state)

Currently 26-24 GOP advantage but I believe it goes on newly elected congress. If one state flips to 25-25. They must stay locked in the room like they are voting on the Pope.

Some state would have to flip.

Jeez I stepped away for like 30 mins and thought my computer glitched. Kept refreshing my screen.
Braindead idiot alert.  The market is an exact barometer of how likely Trump is to win.  Back when Biden looked more likely, everything went down.
Never trusting that shit again
Yeah I’m sure the US is going to let it’s biggest company/producer/world #1 aircraft manufacturer/military defense/aerospace company go bankrupt. Makes sense

Either way tomorrow is green. These futures have too big of a lead.

How far out and avg premium cost does everyone look for on these calls?
I'm in California in a high col area. Collective bargaining got us a 20% raise bringing us up closer, but still under, our peers in other states if you do it by cost of living. Sometimes you got to play the game and get involved to make sure things will go your way. A lot of people are spineless, but I'm fine with speaking out and don't really care if anyone is mad at me making me perfect in my leadership position.
Probably some Dec and Jan, gonna have to free up some money first but fuck it
Don't be a bigot

Hello r/robinhood? How do I sell my shares of stocks when Nasdaq futures are up 4%?
how so?  GOP 145, Democrats 120
I don't understand why we couldn't have started counting all the mail-in votes before election-night.

Apparently Joe telling them fracking won’t be stopped then immediately saying in the last debate it will be stopped didn’t do him any favors
Anyone got livestream on protests?
Fuckers spent 200mn
MI and WI sweep is looking rough
C’mon you know hunter is tweezing in the pool bathroom
Looks like all the blue areas haven’t got all the votes in.  A million mail in ballots yet to be counted.
I have these fantasies Sarah Huckabee Sanders is my middle school gym teacher and I show up to class without my gym clothes.

True.
I always felt like he was sort of the dem counterpoint to trump.

Snarky, aggressive, says what he thinks, scrappy, etc etc. I always felt like he would do better against Trump than these moderate dems.

The fact that we never got to see that debate is a crime.
I actually think this proves the blame is on the pollsters. Models are only as good as their data

Senate they might hold, very little chance they take the house

Trump wins.
Is that countrywide or just in certain states? Here in CA I know Uber was directly affected by prop 22.
My state loves football so much they voted in a coach as senator lol
I didn’t, but Pennsylvania’s Secretary of the Commonwealth [did](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/03/democrats-more-mail-in-ballots-pennsylvania-433951), and I feel like she might know.
Yeah, I dont care about Mccain. That was a very important state to keep though
So we lose?
Wow that ES action.

House of Representatives something something trump wins
 If neither candidate gets a majority of the 538 electoral votes, the election for President is decided in the House of Representatives, with each state delegation having one vote. A majority of states (26) is needed to win. Senators would elect the Vice-President, with each Senator having a vote. A majority of Senators (51) is needed to win.

I'll be honest. I would've voted for him as opposed to 3rd party this year. Just cause he seemed like an actual good guy. DNC fucked themselves.

Alabama voting in a fucking football coach as a senator. Jesus Christ my state lol talk about a puppet.
I'm not a big fan of Unions. The heart of the union is to milk money. Luckily I don't have to pay dues. But the extent of the support offered to me is limited to being a bargaining chip. Suffice to say I haven't had a pay raise in years.

So it's an all or nothing with them. If I felt they were more concerned with the actual employee than the coffers I would be singing a different tune. But money breeds corruption.

Wasn't the House already called for Dems?

I thought about it before you even posted, actually. 17% reporting w/ 75k more for Biden. Extrapolating puts that at 300k, closing a 500k gap. 

Your numbers are wrong. Embarrassing.
This is the truth.

You’re probably right. Dems want more stim money.

Why isn't google showing FL for Trump already? tf
Some states start counting early and some don't.  Nobody knows, probably a ton are just sitting on the floor in a post office somewhere.
Well most of the other states were essentially guaranteed before the election. Those 3 are the ones that trump stole from Obama administration to beat Hilary that Biden based his campaign on winning back.
Well shit. Road trip. I’ve got lots of “issues” I need to iron out. This place being the biggest

None of that matters since trump is winning WI, MI
We make fun on politics.😂😂
Realize, at this point the market is slow to catch on, but I can't see either candidate conceding any time soon, and if Biden gets a surge of mail in ballots, its going to be absolute insanity in the market as Trump melts down. Buckle your seatbelt.

HEXO has a reverse split planned FYI
All the votes that have been counted so far are in red counties. The cities and other blue areas have very little counted
I don’t think anyone is ever ready to “eat dick.”

Either way I think anyone who includes 2020 polling research in the morning resume should be blacklisted.
Florida is still not being called because the Postmaster General defied a judge’s order to locate 300,000 missing ballots from 12 postal districts. Miami and Tampa are two of those districts.
Swung left, futures doubled back

We're not.
NIO gonna tank anyway, momentum has been leaking out that bitch for a couple weeks now.
Nevada polls still open bc they stayed out at the strip clubs last night
Nah
BREAKING: nothing has changed since 5 minutes ago
Markets just want a clear winner you dimwits. They don’t care if it’s Joe or Orange man. It’s a narrow Joe win and a contested election that will fuck us
That Cathie lady added more BABA today to her funds. Maybe I should still diamond-hand my BABA Jan/Feb calls?
This is the way.
Sure! Make sure they’re all at a loss, though.
A lot of them, apparently lmfao
Vegas polling stations still open so the hookers can vote after their shifts
FOX is calling it for Trump. Not sure if that's what you're looking for.
Nope
I go full Apollo Creed Rocky IV
Makes sense. How do you rectify the internal conflict of libertarianism with partaking in organized labor? If you have any at all. If not, I totally get “looking out for number 1” and being pragmatic enough to understand the system you have is the system you have.
ME been puffing on that legal weed for years. Everyone there is basically Canadian now

NBC is basically pinning this on "overconfidence" from House Democrats for both POTUS and senate races
dem party did a number on him like they did to tulsi.
"Business" majors don't settle
Yuan tanking + stocks up equals a trump win
You are the embodiment of ignorant if you think that’s why the democrats can’t beat an arrogant real estate investor with a 2nd grade vocabulary.
Lawyers always get their fee!
Market don't care. Market wants clear result, and it's less clear now.
I got about 10 text messages today from different numbers to tell me to go vote Democrat today. Not to mention the thirty Ive got the last two weeks. Who would think this is a good idea??? I told them to lose my number but then another number would just text me.  It was infuriating.
I see a civil war brewing on WSB
Lol Psyops
I literally called this days ago if you look at comment history
I guess Republicans don’t know how to use the mail?
Andrew Yang 2024
No just annoyed at the stupidity of this sub. WI, MI & PA all that matters now
I'm literally shaking
Everyone was too busy betting on the election to actually vote.
lmao MSM propping up liberal hopes by not calling TX, FL, OH, MI, and so on. it's sad, really. but i guess they need the liberal eyeballs for a few hours or days
People are embarrassed to be voting for Trump so they lie in polls lol. They want a republican in power but Trump is their only choice so they fall in line
Prop 22 looking like a strong Yes in CA. Did you guys buy $LYFT?

$26c 11/13
Ahh I see what you mean. That city with a population of \~300,000. 

\~268,000 of which are of voting age. 

Clearly they all voted twice for Biden in the mail.

Please think before replying.
u kidding or for real?

My ass is feeling hungry too. Maybe it wants a huge eggplant
Uhhhh. sell all my stocks first thing tmro due to market uncertainty???
Its actually pretty close. Gotta plan for a contested election🤨
Just wait for -4% and then you’ll be begging for 2%
They’re callin shit all over the place and way ahead of anyone else tonight. They called Arizona for joe...
rofl they would do something like this.
I need -5% in 2 days plz bear gods
The graphs/people counting are projecting mail-in ballots to make a change
you are not a fan of florida man
if j pow can print money cant the postmaster print votes? ha ha ballot printer go brrr
Oh, NQ. Got it
If this is contested and we don’t know till next week bulls are actually mega fucked
When Cali comes in, He goes down in popular vote but the way media portrayed like he will loose veterans and old people votes because of COVID. That’s why I made that joke.
I never believed trump has a chance of winning popular vote but let’s see where it goes.
BREAKING: A Pennsylvania court has agreed to hold a hearing tomorrow on a GOP effort to invalidate mail ballots that initially contained errors but were later fixed (or "cured," in legal jargon)
As bad as Mitch is, I can respect him for being a consistent asshole.  He knows what he wants and he goes after it even if it fucks everyone else. Lindsey on the other hand flip flops and sucks anyone's dick he can. He is a spineless turd
Which one is that?
⭐️
Yep
2.2M mail in ballots in PA... has to go Bidens way. Would be big surprise if it didn't.
Ones that insist we show up. Not that we do much.
Trump is orange which is closer to black and brown than white. Simple science.
Bernie's party pulled the rug on him both times.  I'm still not really sure how he fell off this time around.
I guess saying our main focus is to TRY to make money is more accurate.

is the numbers showing that GOP is actually leading the House?  Shows 140 GOP, 121 Democrats
A white male just won a senate seat in Delaware.
This is the way. We don't do politics here.
are you mad??
F for my spy and slv calls
They're too dumb to understand statistics apparently. Single digit/low teen reporting percentages from pitt and philly and they think Trump's already won the state 😂
Shit’s over commies. Try again in 4 years
Nevada's been smoking that blue sky and forgot about the election all together.
well I just don't understand how it would make stocks go down, no matter who wins we get a stimulus and we are already recovering from that panic sell off last week so idk why investors wouldn't buy back in now before the stimulus
Florida fuckin rules. Always fuck with the election. Did they check the local Hummer dealership?
Definitely, Biden is like a regurgitation feed for whatever opinions poll the best, same as Hilary and most national politicians before
I’ll save one for you
Investing.com
risky comment. U know his followers believe he’s done nothing wrong right?
I can’t find this news anywhere. Are you trolling or are you ahead of my google? 
If so calls or puts tomorrow
They’re assuming the Dems regulation efforts will fall flat if GOP retains Senate control.
Ahh okay. I mean basically at this point we dont know and wont know.
If all goes as usual bellwethers tell, trump has it. Valencia, NM; Vigo, IN and Ohio all republican
The only way to ensure the people have to decided is to count all the votes. Now, if the state doesn’t meet its own deadline, that’s a discussion to be had in 3 days. 

Something to really consider is the logistics of what a nationwide election entail. It’s an absolutely massive undertaking managed by a contingent of citizens that are partially volunteers. It amazes me some states start counting today and will report numbers as well. And that’s with shit a turnout; not the case this year.
is there a term for it?

i always thought odds are ratios, like 1:10, or 1:40, etc.
🔥💥💥💥
West or East?
Never count the tendies
Starting to think a straddle was the only reasonable play.
Seems to be selling off there might still be hope for my account! 🤞😂
It wants a clear winner.  Looks like they’re not getting  it tonight
WAIT VXX COULD STILL PRINT HAHAHA
General post master lost 300k votes
He is contesting the call by Fox, other channels didn’t call AZ yet
Imagine living in a county where Trump gets 80%+ of the vote 🤢
lmfao accurate
Idk jd up huge in hk. At ath
Bruh quit saying he won those states that’s literally not how this works. PA and MI won’t finish counting until later this week, and they’ll probably singlehandedly decide the election
Line me up a 20
It is by most networks

edit: this was false, called by Fox and decision desk. Other networks just being conservative.

Judge Wapner? People’s Court??
Red or blue... I think we all just want green 💵
Was that the most epic bull trap we've ever seen?
It’s “trendy” not to call
I need my mind cloudy to win
I agree. Trump was-700 and Biden+450 earlier
Market is not gonna crash when we are talking about crash.
Lil marco
I was just making an example. I don't know what the numbers are
Even with the mail in votes Virginia will be way closer than I expected. I’m shocked.
uh ohhhhhh
No it’s not that easy. But bernie would have done much better for sure.

Melania lives matter
Please don't get my hopes up. Tonight has given me three heartattacks with two giant pumps and one giant dump and now we're flat.
ME turned blue, not sure if MN was always blue
greatest analyse i have ever seen, i’m all in
So we're just going to have wild fucking chop until they figure out which old dude wins. Massive IV and dick-ripping whipsaw movements. There are going to be a couple majestic idiots in here who make bank. Wonder what will happen to the rest of us?
Where can I see futures movements?
VXX will somehow trend lower
Shut up pussy, I voted no
Should’ve picked a popular democrat governor from Pennsylvania or NC
Trump campaign already said we won’t know until atleast tomorrow so...

He’s like 80 he’s gotta go to bed
1.6 Million dem ballots compared to 580,000 republicans and then 260,000 NPA. Mail-ins probably haven’t even been reported yet. With a 500,000 vote lead currently, that still is destroyed by the 1.6 million.

PA is definitely not a done deal yet.
Americans are too fucking lazy for a civil war
[deleted]
Yeah... where is that a thing? Europe or something?
we all couldve been smoking joints living life not worrying about this election
DC voted to legalize Shrooms though, so make a trip on over!
Bernie could articulate better than Biden

He also had a track record of compassion and do-goodedness
Lmao are you counting th ballots or something?
Wait until you guys hear about the internet!
Damn, u go to the office? What kind of slave drivers do you work for
Biden would still lose lol

Let's go trump
Did all of Nevada have puts today or something?
Why is Florida not called in with 98% votes counted ?
Please do show me a video of Trump Jr. getting a footy from a hoe while blasting a stem. Even better fucking his dead brothers wife. 

Maybe some emails showing Ivanka getting kick backs from China while her father is in the White House. 

I'm having a great night thanks for caring.
Futures pricing in a Dem President and Rep Senate. No stimulus lol. Plus Trump contesting it is gonna get real bad.
Yeah I’m looking short term. Don’t plan on being here long term. If I’m making 200k+, I’m living in a state with no income tax.

No lie... the darts work. Take it from me. Darts made me rich as fuck. The moment I put my autist mind to work, shit hits the fan.
Yeah doesn’t it seem a little unlikely to be that large of a difference? And there are a ton of mail-in ballots yet to be counted... many democrats did mail-in ballots this year.
All I know is that I will useless in the office tomorrow. Put on productivity, calls on an afternoon nap.
Lmao they shouldn’t have talked shit if they weren’t ready to eat a dick
what car are you selling? ill buy it
i stand by my choice of cash camp
Virginia was called by Fox News for Biden 3 hours ago you dumb fucks
Why do you ameritards only care about winning?
Anyone else think Bernie wins both times against 🥭? Tough scenes for the bern crowd.
"So I was just walking down the street and there was this chap selling his automobile for 100$. I thought about it for a while and then it occured to me why not invest the same 100$ in buying naked Calls? This guy just writes on the board that he lost all his money on the stock market and needs it in cash and gives me the best idea of my life. So I put the 100$ in options that day and my life takes a major turn over. Now I'm living the American Dream."


- Degenerate, WSB (circa 1940's)
There is over 1M uncounted mail in votes. Not a small number
I blink my eyes and futures are green again wtf
Hey fuck you Kentucky reelected Mitch McConnell again. That said my state elected a fucking Auburn football coach. Puts on my state. I gotta get the fuck out of the south.
Futes no liking possible contested election
You can prosecute a sitting president. This was explicitly stated by the Supreme Court under the Nixon admin. Nothing stopping them from doing it now. They won't ever
Riots are going to happen once they announce Trump won
He won Texas Ohio Florida pa and Michigan that’s over 270 without the other states

Fox called it 3 hours ago nbd
NQ does what it wants
they were expected to vote for trump, instead they voted for biden and caused a helluva lot of uncertainty in the markets which made futures drop
[deleted]
Weird how FOX has. But 200,000 votes is a sizable lead with 76% reporting
Ok but for real a cramer/powell ticket would be unreal for markets
lol even if he gives it all to joe he still loses it
I was just thinking if there was no clear winner tonight +2% to -2%?
Great outlet, I thought it was gonna be a bad idea but letting loose was a terrific way to blow off some steam.
Don't think I wiped completely but I'm too addicted to watching results come in to go to the bathroom.
Lmao fox called that 3 hours ago haha hahah
Wtf is happening in Nevada lol
On the plus side, maybe predictit will actually be useable tomorrow but I’m not optimistic
Nope you can't
It was always going to be contested anyways. He’s a classic sore loser, always has been. He would contest this even if it was a blowout for Joe
Only thing that matters is whether we're getting that big ass stimulus or not
I love fucking this dog
The Democrats are the ones saying “mail-in ballots,” most haven’t been counted yet in states such as PA

Pricing in Biden squeak out victory.
I think if nasdaq futures are above 3% -> pricing Trump win. 
Between 1 and 3 -> Biden win
So far I’ve only seen Fox call it
He is down by over 1Mil pop votes now.
Seriously who wins?
I think because our main focus is making money.
Vix gonna rocket!
If Biden fails in PA, He will really gab it.
Lmao false
Not really
I’ll bring my default potluck item, bag of tortilla chips!
Media is a business and election night is big ad revenue
Can we make request for cock inspection anyway?
That'd be easy, any biden hope you short.
This is the correct answer.
Uh oh mango contesting AZ results. Get your riot gear ready
Lmfao if the election isn’t called tonight option volatility will be fucking insane
This is why we can’t discuss politics on this sub, because of people like this.

Why can’t it just be about the data analysis and not about our own bias?
AZ
Wait I don’t get it, mail in voters are statistically mostly Democratic?? Why is everyone like BUT MAIL IN BOTES
All my bets were on a contested night. We shall see
Futures are like that chick who goes crazy first week at college and let’s the whole crew run train
I’m 100% not a democrat, you’re just a pussy boy

Have you ever seen Chicago on the 4th of July?
Oh shit Biden just got lead in Virginia
Yeah it’s been his for a couple hours don’t know why no one has called it
He only considered black women just to pander and it doesn't seem like it made a difference.
I'm not just a union guy, but local leadership. Libertarian believe it or not. I'm not super into unions, but as I'm a union worker I aim to be able to influence my own fate by being locally elected leadership.
CNN getting happy again
Election results probably won’t finish until Nov 12th
Like the president matters. Powell is my current Prez
He got the biggest of China’s big red dildo
Where are you seeing this also I wonder why trump basically won at this point
what does -800 mean?

Yeah, that's what i was saying but far less eloquently
Biden up 290 in Germany
What did they cost us?

Serious question.
Trump's acceptance speech tonight is going to be lit AF even though he could still lose. That would be the most Trump thing to ever happen
If Dems try to cheat with mail in late counts we will 10000% have a civil war
Hope Fox News eats a dick for Arizona
Simmer down, it’s still early lol
Y’all thought you had a chance. SAD! 🇺🇸

Why ?
5PM central time: Trump +195

Currently: Trump favored -145


Seems like a gain in Trumps favor...

Captain obvious over here loll
Futes fading, Biden looking like he can still win. Fuck this I'm taking a nap.
Biden would need near CA-level support in mail-in votes to clutch it.
Fuck yeah Virginia
Might be a tight vote. A lot of tourist based workers not wanting a shut down may vote for trump

Imagine going to sleep an hour ago and waking up to red lmao

at the craps tables
thats because they are all rigged
I might just visit there more often now just to make you cry
1.3M votes actually
Pennsylvania is close to the point where democrats can't win even with mail in votes.  They tried this shit in 2016 where they slowed down florida tallies and started adding dead people to the ballots.

Trump claims victory in the next hour.
Dow is now red
Monte Carlo showing Biden at 290. Sheesh. Some people got suckered in at that -800 line.

Fake internet points can't buy you a lambo.
Lol just as scared as Hillary has been since 2016
Yes
Trump doesn’t care about short term moving averages. Only wider trends
Anecdotal, but what would you say your political splits are being a union guy, if you don’t mind me asking?
LOL
looking like ~250 // ~250 with MN/MI/PA not decided until post-tonight. My vix calls might be saved after all
Like, do you think you're smarter than the combined advice of medical and science experts across the world? You're a Karen, bro
Why is Nevada reporting zero votes? Is everyone dead?
Looks like we are seeing a politics style meltdown right here.
circa 2016
Dude these are the longest futures of our lives
NIO tanking regardless, sorry everyone
I can tell you right now, it’s great. 4 (small) glasses of sake and 4 brews in. Going all night and about to hit the gravity bong because I found my brothers weed crumbs. Haven’t smoked in a few days so I’m gonna be shmeeked

Lol, how long ago did r/politics lock the live discussion thread?  Getting too heated I suppose?
steve's a pro's pro
Trump victory fading
Ohio going pump 😎
Futes are like a war zone!
Wisconsin is in trumps favor by 5.1% with 78.88% of the vote in. I think trump wins Wisconsin and Michigan. If he does that and wins Iowa(which he’s leading in), assuming North Carolina is a given win for trump, he doesn’t even need Pennsylvania to win.
How do they know that? Pretty sure votes are still being tallied.

yeah but u don’t have absentee ballots counted in Michigan that’s expected to be 55% of the total votes and there’s only 15% of them counted, same for Pensylvania, they won’t be ready till atleast tmrw or the day after, shits not even close to being over, expect it to take a couple days
Someone find the drill team and tell them to stop the circle jerk
Damn beat me to it.
boycott arizona, never step foot there, never drive there. they wont earn a penny off of us after what they have just cost us
Its a byproduct of how the electoral college is designed. Because the flyover states (the empty place i call home) get 3 electors no matter what it doesn't matter if california has 80 times the population of Wyoming. They only get 20 times the electors.

Oh shit. Forgot about all that. At least a union lockdown will help curb the spread.
I think it will be by 12th
Gotcha. Pilgrim shit. But it’s okay to drink a 12 pack of Bud Light with a fifth Jack back. These laws...😒 

Hope it works out for u! Ridiculous legislation.

Even if Trump is declared winner?
That would be cool
ok got it, thanks.
yeah, should've thrown money when Joe was at +600 when I looked an hour ago.
the margins could be really close

and we won’t know for a while

You had me until those three last sentences
That's reddit.  I've been called a racist so many times on topics that have nothing to do with race just for disagreeing.
Fox called Ohio for trump
Ran out of bath salts
Whatever helps you sleep
Trump is scared that hes gonna go to jail if he loses
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA bulls LMAO! 😂😂😂
They don’t count good out thurrrrrr
My calculation is lose PA, win rest and get IA

So far only Fox called it.. I’m watching wsj updates
These betting odds continue to narrow. This is getting interesting
Suck his dick too
Compare it to covid randomized trials regarding facemasks please
And there’s the attitude that will lose every election the democrats are involved in.

He’s going to try and the federal courts are going to throw out the suit. They’ve been pretty consistent across the board about not meddling in state election issues. See Harris County in Texas just this morning.

OHIO let’s goooo
Mail in ballots and big cities still have votes to count. That's going to be the x-factor.
They gotta get the meth residue off the ballots
Mail in ballots.
A lot of mail in ballots for PA, MI, and WI. Going to make this a stressful week for the market haha. With AZ for Biden, these are the states it will come down to.

1.6 million for Dems vs 580,000 for Repubs in PA alone. With 260,000 NPA. Based on mail in voting data available through electproject.GitHub.io
why contested?
# THANK YOU ARIZONA FOR SAVING MY PUTS

# ALSO THANK YOU TO RUPERT MURDOCH FOR GIVING AZ TO BIDEN
Map guy 2024
Fox News could taste the Trump landslide and then Arizona happened.  They are getting pissy just like CNN.
How is it bullshit?  Pennsylvania has 1.6 million Democrat ballots and 500,000 Republican ballots to process.  You don’t think that might change the results slightly?
Tree fiddy
That's the biggest positive with him is that he doesn't have a plan therefore he doesn't get anything done and things don't change much

Lets load our homie up with the reload
Fox calling Ohio to Trump.

🥭- 1
LBJ - 0
If Trump is the worst politician in modern history... acting like a complete buffoon...  allowing 200k people to die during a pandemic... and you LOSE to him.. what does that make you?
Yea but if you only have X amount out and the difference doesn’t cover it you can assume there is a 0% chance. You just need the majority of them to run the numbers
Tell me about it, all I did was call them idiots, and I lost so much karma
puts on all the pollsters . how do you get  it wrong two elections in a row?

They must be regulars from WSB.

My dead great grandpa who lived in Hungary just mailed in for Biden in PA. Looking like a Biden landslide there. #BlueWave
# OHIO
He's said Senate, several times
You won.
Not based on his performance amongst the demographics in this state and avg nationwide performance vs. Polling. V bullish for Biden rn.
Maybe like 8 points?
Melania in shambles that mango has a chance.
red probably
Wisconsin 69%
This is definitely going to get contested 100%, We can all agree on AT LEAST that
?? Im not watching TV
Contested election still might be in play. Gonna be a wild week and I can’t wait to lose money
\*whew\*  VIX back to flat...my UVXY Calls ain't f\*cked yet for now...got to get to some sleep....will probably wake up at 3am to check futes 😵
give me some adderall and i’ll count these ballots faster than these bozos
Bought out of the money calls expiring in 2023 for like 1,000$ each
softbank
He will have to win NV, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but by then biden will already be at 270. Going to steal iy from under his feet. Stopped counting for the night in several states. Never saw that before. Trump won TX but not calling. Not calling any states he is winning. Ask yourself why? THEY ARE CRIMINALS..
Bruh why can’t we have live feature anymore in mobile 😣
🥴
“Don’t blame me I voted for JC2020”
Biden will take the lead in MI and WI with mail in vote later tonight. Biden will be declared President-elect at 6am tomorrow morning. Then this will head to the courts
[deleted]
I dunno about you guys but if you bought puts hoping for worst case scenario it sure looks like you’re gonna get it. Some states counting votes for as long as 10 more days, unclear winner, if the late votes swing expect lawsuits and unrest, split house / senate, etc. I ain’t buying this futures pump until I see it closed tomorrow at 4pm.
Regardless of outcome, Trump does not care about the stock market anymore. Either 4 more years and no more terms, or Dems are coming to power-
Blue M&M MABA!
PA is going to be the lifeline for either at this point
For a nursing home right

[deleted]
My karma got nuked for shit posting in r/politics for saying “I’d jerk Biden off just to be able to unload another vote into trumps mouth”
Because they're almost to a point where the democrats can't win even with mail ins.
I analyze this stuff for hours a day. Not saying this as a partisan stance. Biden now the strong favourite IMO.

Even at a 269-269 tie which is now a real possibility Biden becomes president due to house.
might dip one last time tm before that shit shoots up again
More of a soggy waffle imo
[removed]
Looking like we might not have a clear decision tonight. Markets don’t like that
Good point. Actually haven’t seen anyone bring that up yet
-145/+110
If futures are up, say 100 points. What do we expect SPY to open at?
Trump is leading in every single swing state he won in 2016 (except for Arizona) with a much higher margin than last time. He obviously won.

Last time he won in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania by less than 0.5%, now he's leading each state by more than 5%. This shit is over. Biden is finished.
Short memory guys: we’re going into contested elections mode, a few key states will only have final results by EOW and it will be tight. Hang on.

🤡🎢
[deleted]
Dems looking to see how many mail in ballots they need to dig out of the dumpsters to get the W
No shit. He started campaigning his first week in office!
TRUMP gonna get IV crushed
I tried tax the rich one, let’s see

( only got 1 thread is moving too quick )
Terrible play. His wang couldn't possibly go down any more.
Start campaigning for a third term probably
If vix actually measuree volatility it would literally be over 100% up right about now
trumpers disappeared real quick lmao
At least twice recently he's asked for your vote for his run for Senate.  And [today](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8909537/Joe-Biden-starts-election-day-attending-morning-mass-visiting-son-Beaus-grave-Delaware.html) he called his granddaughter the name of his late son.   So maybe not.   I think it's sad really, he has obvious dementia and no one steps in.
So why isn’t everyone throwing their life savings at TQQQ calls then
bruh wtf we were up 2% and now barely up .7%, what the fuck
lol idk
I was playing with the map and that’s where I settled as well
Sorry I’m an idiot, can someone hypothesize why tech futures are ripping so bigly?
Puts on pton
Thinking Michigan will go Trump and Wisconsin breaks for Biden after more % reports. Will see.

Penn is going to be the war zone.
Boys they're gonna stretch the fuck out of this aren't they? So what SPY puts if its still contested by open tomorrow?
Bovada
Let’s not forget my $0.36
Nah, chill im still holding calls 😂
I don’t know what the fuck the market wants lol
I'm showing 287 electoral votes for Trump, not including Iowa or Virginia. He can afford to lose any one of PA/MI/WI/OH and still win (can lose PA only if pick up IA).
[deleted]
Now imagine how 6 will feel
already yolo'd $1000 on Biden last week. Alan Lichtman called it for Biden, so seemed like a safe bet: [https://www.american.edu/cas/news/13-keys-election-prediction.cfm](https://www.american.edu/cas/news/13-keys-election-prediction.cfm)
Nice fence sitting there son
Tommorow Trump is going to try to shutdown the absentee counting in Pennsylvania. SPY 325 EOW.
What were the betting odds prior to the election?
Biden most likely for Nevada
My union is gonna be sending out some wild emails this week
The worst part of all this is the at&t in the upper left
Somebody is projecting
You didnt hold?
Checked my iTunes playlist and only saw Kanye on there.  Kanye’s always been there in my iTunes.  Fucker got my vote
You don't think it's weird that so many votes somehow vanished? Or are you going to ignore it because your candidate is winning?

Guessing you're going to ignore it, and you'll probably ignore the fact that Trump instantly called fraud too
🥭 win means. RIP MSM, dem campaign, pollsters. 

Nobody's gonna ever trust pollsters ever again. I think degenerates like us do better DD than pollsters.

Some states stopped counting ballots. We won't know the winner till early next week.
Wtf happened to futures?
Daughter is a successful business owner and mother of 3 children. Multi millionaire from her personal business before entering politics. His other two sons are not on video smoking drugs and getting paid by China and Russia. 

Bidens son is a literal meth addict who fucks hookers and gets foot jobs from skanks he gets high with. He's also getting paid by China and Russia. His daughter is a recovering drug addict. 

Real class that Biden family is. Seethe more.
Happy Cake Day!
if market is red by open. republicans = red = win?
Babe, stop
But today morning we were told market is bullish on Biden’s win. I think futures are looking at contested case. Both the candidates are coming close.
No lie, that’s what my sister and brother in law walked into their wedding reception to.
If Donnie wins NIO is going to tank tomorrow
It’s a clown market rn. All a fugazi
Donald Trump -170 Joe Biden +130

62% / 43%

(Doesn't total 100% because the house always wins)
Wouldn’t be fun without a little volatility
That’s a lot....
Trump is up by 600k I suspect it's going to get to a point where even the mail ins would make it impossible to win.
Right - Biden was a heavy favorite going into tonight and now Trump is the favorite
Fuck Pennsylvania - they quit counting for the night
No body thought trump would win. Every poll pointed to landslide Biden.
I almost panic sold my puts today, but then i remembered that I was ALWAYS counting on post election insanity and so far everything is going perfectly according to plan 🍻
Jyeap
So is Nevada just like not voting?
What are you smoking ?
I'm sorry brother.
It's not going to be decided tonight most likely. Maybe not till Friday
I hope this lady turns up, if Trump wins that is:

Sure, Trump just leading the swing states. Far too early to call it though
Gore Bush fiasco in 2000, no one wants to risk being wrong
I did it like 2 hours ago so hoping to get out of it tonight
CONTEST THIS SHIT TRUMP
Ouch Baba Jd and Pdd

Imagine how bad Biden would’ve lost if Rona and Floyd never happened. Like trump or not he really fucked that up and this is close even with all that.
Good DD
I’m preparing myself for when somehow all of the absentee votes go to Biden lol. 

The market has got me conditioned to believe that all systems are rigged.
Voting in person during a pandemic should count for two votes because you need bigger balls.
Abacus is hard 🧮
Seriously. What is mango gonna do for the next four years? His only goal was to get re-elected. Lmao
All that matters is path to Victory even if you have 260 electoral votes and are winning if you can't win any more States then you lost.

Question to you isn't whether Biden is ahead it's how many more states do you think he can win and is that enough to put him over 270
My late father had a picture of Ronald Reagan in his office. On this all nighter I'm ordering one of Donald John Trump for mine. What an absolutely amazing, honorable, and inspirational Man.

Would love to share some fine whiskey with him some day, but sadly he doesn't partake. At least we share a common interest in the love of hot sexy women!
Yeah ima say futures can't be fuckin trusted haha

If only they would create a separate branch of government that proposes and creates laws, we could split it into two houses to give everyone an equal representation and then another one based on population.
They started later on those, so yes, current counts don’t mean much. AZ is honestly massively bullish for Biden, it became the most important state in the election after Biden lost NC, FL and GA.

Trump leading Florida and Texas. Biden probably needs one of those to get it

Lol Sure buddy. Look who's leading
What the hell? stop lying, the nice man at the booth said it was required
Yeah if you are blinding following the current reporting count with no understanding of how they’re reporting
WI, MI, & MN still have to count mail in right? I think Biden has MN.
*All of which were ballots cast for Trump
I really hope my candidate wins
Nah, it's Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin that he needs
Good luck brother, remember to add: “I love Biden ❤️ “
Predicting Trump win on 273
Republicans started drinking faster, futures fading
That figure is as reliable as polls

Are you winning son?
PA wasn't allowed to process mail in ballots until this morning, Florida has been working through them as received. Hooray stupid fucking voter suppression laws! This time it will fuck the market AND Biden will still win, my puts are crying with laughter 🤣🤣🤣
Wrong song bot
Hey, where do you see the odds? Wanna track them live
AZ looks good for him
Or just start counting ballots early.... there was no reason to wait to the last minute other than to just cause drama. And only a few state did it so that way they could get all the attention because they are attention whores
Always inverse the news - see 2016
#BREAKING: China plans to crack down further on Ant Group by discouraging lenders from working with the fintech giant, sources say  
  
*R.I.P. BABA*
The real win is when we get the Election Results Reaction Video in the next week or so if Trumpers pulls this off. Gonna be a lot of pretty funny hysteria and outrage tonight
You win the election. What’s the song you walk out to the next day to accept your prize.
Yeah he totally didnt try, retard lol.
they refuse to call FL, TX etc with most of the votes already counted.

its about the optics. cant make old man joe look tooooo bad.

⚠️WARNING⚠️ cock inspection is NOT required at the voting booths!!!! don't be tricked like me!!
Didn’t he do a bunch of rallies while Biden cancelled his due to an ongoing pandemic. This “Trump didn’t even try” narrative is odd because it’s incredibly wrong

Im pretty neutral but 🥭 shitting on McCain while him being a draft dodger done it for me. But democracy at play so amen to that. It just plagues me that most of murica don't care about character, values, morale, principles etc. Just scary.

Good luck 👍

I don't want him to win, but if I was a betting man and I am, right now at this moment, I'd put my money on 🥭. Hope I'm wrong...
Don’t underestimate the power of simps
Hmm, the news keep showing Biden is ahead.  So wtf.. who's up?
Pence?

Nio is Chinese... it doesn't need an American Presidents help are you stupid
Can’t forget about the europoors whose futures are dumping again
It will be hilarious to see both side completely flip their position. Dems defending the electoral, and Repubs screaming it should be the popular.
We are the monkeys
These betting odds make no sense. Biden at +190 with this map?

Biden can still definitely lose, easily, but those seem like good-ass odds for a Biden Yolo right now.
r/politics won't even let you say the word riot
We are not going to know tonight.
If it wasn't for covid and Dems doing everything they can try tank the economy it would've been a red landslide
You’re a fucking legend mods flair this man
oh ok i see what you mean now.
Nate Silver is going to hold on to Trump losing longer than he's holding onto that fucked up hairline. Bro get a razor your entire hair situation, head and facial is a disgrace.
Mail in votes tend to lean dem though
I like Biden. He seems honest genuine and not creepy
Don't like the man, but gotta hand it to him. He's grabbing this as hard as he can 🍑
Fcking call FL already omg
nah there is 2 mil mail in ballot to count
looks like a clear winner won’t be decided today. means uncertainty means high vix
Shiii... maybe one day we will have a black president. Peace and Love

Proof or ban
He didn’t lose it yet. Preemptive call. Wait..
Mother doesn't like him leaving the closet. Toe the line or no visits from REDACTED.
If still contested by then, likely
He's winning Texas and Florida. Without them Biden probably won't win

Lol Republican talking points if Biden got it were going to be how bad our deficit is and blame the democrats as socialists for that...Might get some revised talking points Marco...

VIX futes about to go green lolololol
Reality
Rkt
imagine of all the things he did, this is what people perceived as crossing the line
Just realized we’re all looking at maps of people voting, it literally doesn’t matter. We’re all retarded. Electoral college can still vote for whichever side they want in the swing states
Idk. I saw a few posts a couple weeks back that said don't believe the election week drop hype and to buy the dip the week before.  Had crayon charts and everything. I just kept my Nio shares and said fuck the rest just in case though.
PA needs to figure out how many votes to find
[deleted]
I’m looking at googles live results and trump definitely gonna win Florida
Vix back on the menu
We seriously may not know until Friday or Monday lol
Agreed. And i feel like people are missing the signs that this is kamalas election. Biden wont last for 4 years. They are using bidens name to get kamala in
Donnie didnt even try, and he is still winning? 😂😂
The suspense makes money
Biden might as well be a vote for theta gang.

Fuck you theta gang. My straddles do not like you.
Imagine not understanding how timelines work.  Imagine not understanding the obscenely simple fact that the Yuan started tanking from a stable level at the exact same time Trump started winning.  Imagine thinking the two are uncorrelated.  Imagine not realizing China has wanted Biden from day 1.
Lol idiot
VIX pumps and we have a fun ride
Man, you demos are always so aggressive. Good luck with that hate dude.
not knowing is not good
I think u just got banned
Closer than I expected
##DD: Knife edge election not decided for weeks, election lawsuits, civil unrest and Corona cases smashing through 120k is going to make the market absolutely tank over the next week.
At this point I don’t know who the market wants to wjn
100% agree!!!

I guess I was coming on it from the angle of that’s what republicans hide behind

Separation of church and state fuck!
Rad.
We won’t even know who’s gonna win tonight. Stupid ass market rallying like it already knows. Bruh this is Softbank in tech again.

Bears down but not out Hahha wtf is happening
Wtf does it take so long to count things - that’s what we should be upset about as Americans
What the fuck is a 32x long derivative?
Lol, Fox News is the only one that called AZ for Biden.
Because this is all a show. Every single time there’s an election it’s gotta be a big show. Can’t just be clean or we wouldn’t be dealing with doubt
Don't count Jo Jorgensen out. If she wins, all weed companies up, government contractors down, awesome up.
No, just fucking no
Still pretty close race, Biden has a good chance of winning PA after they finish counting all the mail-in votes, he just needs to get lucky on one of the other swing states.
It's a troll. They are common here. You just paid your toll.
Futures are looking beautiful. It’s pretty close on the polls rn.
Florida man stories.
Yeah volume was fucking TRASH!! I was gonna get back into too, but it just won’t budge!!!
update?
This is going to be close with Az going to Biden. Then if the mail in ballots lean heavily to Biden you bet your ass Trump is taking this to court
[deleted]
And Michigan and Ohio
Curious to see how this plays out.

PA hasn’t counted mail in votes and some early votes which tend to be democratic leaning.. they may not finish counting until Friday
Stop I can only get so hard

If Biden wins MI, WI & MN he wins the election. Doesn't even need PA.

No
Do you know where the liberals stashed the country when they stole it from you?  You should have called the police... although it’s kind of on you for not keeping track of something that large
WSB always follows the trend. If Trump is up, that's what WSB will upvote.

Although I have not seen a negative trend towards Biden/Democrat posts.
But you can't win if you don't play.
CNN trying to act like they’re aren’t thrilled they have 4 more years of trump shenanigans to cover
Will they finalize realize it’s an echo chamber on not representative of everybody else? Probably not
Detroit has barely reported. Michigan & PA will go to Biden by Friday.
Well Donnie won this one. My solar calls are going to be worth next to nothing tmm. Cheers 🥂

Futures did not like Trump losing AZ...
AMA too. I need to know what my long lost uncle is doing with those winnings. I got puts to buy! Er, student loans or whatever.
Isnt it like a million ballots
Arizona win is absolutely massive for Biden. He doesn't even need PA now if he takes WI, MI & MN
You're welcome, man!
Again? Lol
The way they counted the votes so unevenly is how you start chaos
Ah yes the Trump family isn’t a gang of degenerates.
We, in PA don't work at night bruh. We will start counting tomorrow. Lol
We green as fuck. You have puts or what?
Was Arizona called early?
They really thought🤣 clowns
That probably true. I think either would cause wall street to shower them with success in the market. And you don’t forget an early win.
Fuck Yeah! First I'm hearing of it. BK employee, but great news all around

Why would we buy puts? We know tromp will push us into the next 4 year bull run
I can't wait for Biden to get on air and send his congratulations to George Bush for his win today.
Can I have it
Because he hasn’t won until WI and PA count all their votes
Hell no market needs Biden
Probably unmade a lot more millionaires on that tech jump lol
Probably
Yes that is why annually more people move to the US from Canada than the other way around.
They align with christian/mormon voters if they support either of those they lose a massive group of voters.

Nio sells in China and its major upcoming catalysts are the battery and expansion into Europe. It's doing its own thing.
Hey well thanks! I saw this from you and now it’s all over my feeds. Good shit
I would like to move on top of the anti fracking activist lady gaga tomorrow.
China is raping us via asymmetric tariffs. Trump is the only politician from both parties who brought that forward. Now fuck off and quit expecting everything to be spoon fed. Maybe go talk to someone who makes a living farming or ranching.
calls on weed and puts on china. one gotta hit right after the elections?
The US is meant to be a federal alliance of states, the purpose of the electoral college is to protect the more rural states from being completely pushed around by the more densely populated states. Without the electoral college the California would effectively rule the US. I can't see the rural states ever agreeing to eliminate the electoral college.
Seriously I see NASDAQ rally like that I don't give a fuk I'm happy. Last I checked I live in a fucking America

Qcom: the tsla of 99 baby.
The reporting on AP shows Trump pulling 280 without Nevada and Alaska and the popular vote
As far as hispanics go, maybe the Cubans? I honestly dunno myself. And with the black voters, it's probably cause of Biden's flimsy history regarding his views on race. 

&#x200B;

Also, you ain't black if you're not voting for Biden. Supposedly

Deutche Bank calling in Trump debts for 2021, RIP ☠️ 📉
No, they are starting to count in the mail in ballots and that is what they are getting so far.
He’s certainly in far better mental shape than Trump.

BREAKING NEWS:  Trump campaigners in Florida have been caught stuffing ballot boxes around Mar-a-lago.  Results in question!
Respect. Someone commented about futures a minute before this and so I thought they were now tanking.
China keeps their currency low because it benefits their exports. Imagine not understanding macro economics.
I won’t be crying when half of Florida is under water. Fucking idiots
Here comes joeeeeee
Surprised futes are still green.  It looks like we are going to get exactly the nightmare scenario.  The states that decide the election are the ones that told us it would take days to finish counting the votes, and we likely go to bed tonight not knowing who the winner is.
I heard trump shits his pants on the reg

Trudeau's scandals were having his family work on a charity he was donating to and doing black face. That's nothing compared to trump
Trump is leading in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. He can lose Pennsylvania, the state with the most electoral votes of the three, and if he wins the other two he still wins because he retook the lead in Iowa.
Spy directly tracking trumps odds

You love to see it
That's what people have been saying for weeks. Both candidates have even been strawmanning. "oh, he ain't gonna steal it by announcing a win prematurely."

Arizona just fucked out tendies.

Just asked someone else this, but I can’t seem to find how many mail in ballots will come in after today/tomorrow. Where can I find those estimates?

The fact that anyone would vote for Biden who shows clear signs of early onset dementia is mind blowing.

They really think this guy would be a force for the US and fight for this countries interest against the rest of the world? Guys whole family is a gang of degenerates and he's the best we can get for the US. 

Can't believe it's this close.
Futures def made a few millionaires tonight, not here, but somewhere.
im serious bro why the fuk u laughin at me
People saying futures mooning must’ve not had their phones two hours ago, after AZ, we need a definitive MI or WI for futes to moon again. PA no chance is figured out tonight
Yo mama
Nobody knows shit. The most we know are scenarios.
Most of early votes are not yet in
Ya, the inner city trash school districts are a mess, hence the voting.
Bro. It's hilarious this is your first time voting. Go fuck yourself kid
We're all too exhausted
Nowhere in the Bible does it say anything about abortions, or weed for that matter - repubs would get so much support if they caught up with the times

I get what he was saying but damn it was hilarious
Moscow Mitch also
500k vote gap not going to be made up by mail-in. Stop living in denial lmao. I'm not a Trump supporter but you gotta know when you've lost.

This is America.... We have personal. Fucking freedoms.

No party is against this. 

I'm tired of Americans fighting over shit we fucking agree on, that's idiotic. It only benefits our enemies.
what's the SPCE earning play?
lmao
Unfortunately,  I'm at work for 30 more minutes. Give me an hour or so.
so market was pricing in a blue wave, then futures started pricing in a red wave, I think this will be too close and courts will be tasked to work it out, might be biased with my uvxy calls
Ew. She’s a fuckin idiot lol
I wouldnt be surprised. Yuan is tanking rn
How the fuck are futures up when this clearly go on longer.  Of course I got 🦃🍆 on puts already this week.  Maybe these 11/30 p will print.

When can i start buying RGR
EV stocks go brrr
Trump down to -185 on the odds - things have tightened up. Was at -800 at one point. Arizona changed things
Mail in ballots for PA:

1.6 **million** for democrats.
586,000 Republican
260,000 NPA.
 
So his 500,000 he’s ahead by right now (most likely all in person votes) still puts him behind even if he takes all the NPA and Republican mail in ballots.
Yeah like 2 hours ago. I actually made a difference today with my vote fckn hype
Tomorrow night
Just look at the math and the projections and the remaining vote % based on population.
He gained Cuban voters with the socialism fear thing.

He lost other Latino voters though, big time, which is why Arizona just flipped blue.
No riots. I think Sleepy wins
Expect it. Election won’t be resolved for several days minimum
*Exhales in covered calls*
Yeah, it's like the "If everyone's talking about it, you've already missed it" kinda deal. See: Pokimane asking about options right before the March crash
It's because the bulk of blue votes in PA, WI and MI are not in yet
Did you expect anything else?

Trump raw dogging bears tonight 🇺🇸
So whats the deal with PA? are we not gonna know who won before friday?
Who's winning the elections?
Biden is up 10% in the most populated AZ county and polls just closed in El Paso where Biden should receive a large chunk of votes. Texas shouldn’t flip but it’s a hell of a lot closer than AZ.
NC could be the savior
That's what I'm thinking...  It's could take days to count the Millions of Mail-in ballots to determine this election, and Mango would probably declare himself the winner and the lawsuits will start....  My UVXY Calls better print.
Probably down
Fuck that dumb bitch
Fuck the presidential race who’s winning senate majority?
why
Some of those lines are straight, one is clearly 🌈🐻.
They should probably figure it the fuck out
WI, MI still only like 60% votes counted. Pennsylvania will be counting mail in votes well after the election too
Reported 60-1 in favor?

Did the media open up all the mail in ballots, tally the votes and reseal them or something?
Was just there. Lotsa youngsters want free shit. Clinton ‘96 all over again. BTW good for them.
Lol all the people going “haha Trump won again. Feasting on lib tears for days!”....these are the same people who brag that their puts will print overnight only for them to open at .01.
No hangover, no withdrawal
What’s their rankings with rice?

Whoops.
CNN is Robinhood of political maps.
What are you talking about?

I'm just saying there's no way that's not retarded to say Republicans are the majority
This is all gonna be close. Good time to be a lawyer in play lol
That’s it, I’m leaving the US and going to Puerto Rico!

sleepy wouldve won if he chose AOC as vp
But seriously, we can’t let him get his hands on the nuclear codes
Qualcomm?
Contested because Wisconsin and Penn won’t be done counting votes at least until Friday. Many states aren’t used to mail in votes.
OH, PA, MI, WI, TX are the most important states to capture.
What are you following right now?  I have Reuters and NYT open but I’m leaning more towards Reuters
I heard it may tank, Yuen has dropped. I think it will only be temporarily

Biden is gonna win PA with all the mail in votes coming in (reported 60-1 in favor of Biden), putting him at about 260 electoral votes (after winning AZ and NH), he just needs one more swing state and he wins.

PA has until Friday to count mail in ballots. Regardless of what the president says, the respective Secretaries of State decide their process, not the president.
I actually shorted nq at 11400 so I’m hoping for a quick crash then lengthy uptrend
Looks the same to me
i think the pollsters just straight up lied to make money on these betting sites. heheh! That's one way to recoup all the money they lost in 2016
Go for it brother; I’m banned already
If futures flip to red I’m gonna shit my pants
Yeah ik, read my edit lol
AZ clutched up
[deleted]
Reminds me of some breaking bad shit
hoes mad
Dems are gonna tank the market with this “no counting until tomorrow” in PA even though they have the votes there. What a joke.
No verdict
If you feel the urge to comment about futures, look at what time the rally started and look at what time it is now.

Your “HoLy FuCk FUtUrES” and shit is just wasted fucking time. 

Post some DD instead you fucking morons. 

We fucking KNOW what futures look like, we don’t fucking care about your surprised feeling of seeing futures.
Weekly OTM QQQ calls isnt a portoflio? Who knew
Kanye got 10,000 votes in Tennessee
I’ve blocked so many people on that sub I don’t think I’d be any to post on anything that’ll aim veiws
Meaningless with only half the votes counted, with likely heavy democratic bias on the mail ins they’ve barely opened yet
A Pennsylvania tie breaker holding shit up til Friday
If this ends 269/269 I'll come out looking like Quagmire after his weeklong binge.
Yes, trapfactory has it backward
If you have calls, SELL at open tomorrow. Delayed mail in ballots could change everything. Market is gonna be volatile af either way
Someone call the lawyers and hail the elevator
Won't that sell off if Trump wins? Lol
This is gonna drag on 

https://twitter.com/salehamohsin/status/1323839724063252483?s=21
Mail in votes need to come in first.
I just got 40+ downvotes there lol
Yup
Can we put the theory that stuff is priced in and  accept that the market is controlled by the major players
Bold prediction: NIO will tank tomorrow and next few days. (Temporarily)
I'd take Biden on heroin, riding a pony wearing assless chaps carrying a picture of him in a 3 way with Epstein and Micheal Jackson over that moron Trudeau
Yup, and this fake ass pump is gonna crash so fucking hard.
Oo TGT er in 2 weeks also. I think they both crush tbh.
Silver lining. Good shit man.
Zero mail in ballots so far
So... Business as usual?
[deleted]
I like Biden's chances more now than i did an hour ago
Uber wants prop 22 to pass. It let's them keep their drivers as contractors...
So are we really not going to know the results tonight? I mean I knew we might not but this fuckin sucks
Considering they refuse to call Florida, it's odd.
He bought in at about 40:60 odds so around 12.5 million

Just following the news!
it is
Ill admit when I'm wrong. This shit is going to get contested and shits about to get dramatic af
Every time a polling company called me I said Biden just to fuck with the numbers.
I need answers!

PA sus
Joe Biden
I have small dick
AZ is a traitor to our portfolios
from -350 to -200 now on bodog
Or because they hit limit up
Dumb.  People can't just up and move to Canada
Different states different rules for counting votes
🥭 should have respected war hero John McCain.
PTON needs some of that love
Looking at nyt and what votes are left likely trump wins Wisconsin + Michigan

USA has 0 to little effect on them. No sales in the us, production in the us, etc. maybe a pullback but its grown as much as it has this year with trump in office. I think ill be fine
[deleted]
What would it take for Futes to flip back to red?
They were only battlegrounds cuz he was on the defensive. Pa is the true decider and they have counted zero mail in ballots so far
He is rich, so we make fuck.
Feel like a pass out on the couch is imminent. Hit the bottle a little too hard. Unsure of whether I will check election results or futes first upon waking up
Covfefe
LOL
Bad for the market = everything goes up
[The Chinese Yuan tonight.](https://kekpe.pe/i/5fa21dac39748.PNG)

You've been brainwashed.
Why
Technically Biden is way ahead on electoral college votes, but a ton of red states are not finished yet, so that gap will close a lot, very quickly.
That's electoral counts dummy

As in states that are called
Trashy ass Arizona
🤔
They were asking for too much extra stuff.
AZ Flipped.
Trump looks so much better bald.
id nut
Mangos a moon
And still finds time to slam hookers
Na lockdowns and mask mandates
Thank you! Are you a fellow Oregonian or just following the news?
TTD seems like it’s going to explode tomorrow
Doesn't he still have a chance? He took AZ.
Turns out being pretty good in the looks department and able to read a teleprompter is harder than it seems.
Pen still too early, less than 50% reporting.
Oddly, I think we'd get way more done that way.  Trump is not that hard to manipulate into being decent, it's just a matter of who he's talking to.
Cgc calls gonna print tomorrow
Dude Trump has 0 impact on cannabis stocks. It’s the states voting on legalization.
Arizona just fucked everything up
I don't feel as bad when my poor decisions lead me to losing money as opposed to jumping on some FOMO train and losing money because everyone else was doing it
Rip your heart
is there actual legit news that calls states anymore?!?! this is a sitcom/reality show tease.. im neutral and its over. downvote at will dont care

Thanks! Last I heard Nsaids were fine. I looked into it a few months ago and didn't see any reason it'd cause issues with the cytokine storm or anything like that. Think I'll be wearing a medical from now on 100%
Sleepy Joe is sleepy
I’m up on futures for the evening so I’m going to let Jesus take the wheel and wait this out into open
Now he’s driving
Nah if you look at futures it looks like we are crashing hard af tomorrow
Florida can count like 11,000,0000 votes in 5 hours. What the fuck are MI, WI and PA doing
So is NIO going to 41 or not?
Im extremely bullish on it but it doesn’t move as freely as TGT, it should be at 150 already

I have equally boomer BA calls
Bro look at the futes
If Kanye doesn’t squeeze out a win, I’ll be disappointed
Guess what. It's still super possible for 269-269. HOW FUCKING FUN WOULD THAT BE! VIX would look like jizzed-out Randy marsh
da bulls
Can i hope nio goes up too... i know biden woulda helped more
Aaaay! Just lemme see a big green dildo before my calls expire. Then you can tank my stocks or protest or whatever the fuck.
Hahah - 100% 🤣
What if he loses
Expect all brokers to crash tomorrow at open

CNN seeing how long they can milk all these viewers flips to 2012 map to 2016 map to 2020 map 😂😂 I cant Lmaoo
why? Ik you guys aren’t my personal financial advisors but I’m just tryna learn.
wow, calling AZ for Biden changes it.    Futures are following.
Mango will win and we will crash
100 shares at 9.50 30 dollar stock in no time
I think because the total vote number is a prediction, they aren't sure exactly how many total votes there are until they're counted. Maybe? idk
Including prescription drugs?  Prescription drugs or no balls
Orange man good
Same :/ bought a shit ton of calls on the lows of last week. Bittersweet
Wow i haven’t seen Nasdaq this green in awhile
Futures already coming down, I wonder if that's because its looking more and more like a contested election.
We legalized in NJ, letsgoo
Didn’t Brian Williams flame out few years ago? How is he .... somewhat respectable again on MSNBC?
Regardless of what polls say. It doesn't look like he will flip enough needed states. If we're are waiting on 3 states to finish counting tomorrow and trump is up by 300k in those its unlikely biden wins if head needs more than one.
Lol probably 350 at this point
AZ flipping blue for Biden has straight spooked Fox News
Do you think Biden already went to bed tonight?
They will tie at 269 a piece and theta will fuck us all
ngl, thought it would be closer
I think Melania got it last time. This time i think it goes to Ivanka
Shoulda took Biden  +400
Thats fine but literally you said something factually incorrect like it was historical record. We literally would have had a 2nd check in our pockets if republicans passed the bill the democrats literally passed. No one took your money than republicans which is literally what they always do unless you are super rich.
House already went blue so no
They’ve been expanding since the 70’s and like 50 years before that
Melanie gonna have to lick ass if he wins. Donnie gets his stimulation before she gets the package
There’s always been a disconnect between the electorates. You’ve obviously got outliers but the biggest correlation is actually highest education achieved, not income.
Shannon Bream is such a Milf
Quadruple witched!
Trump 420 Biden 269 ;)
HK is pro USD smart boi. Jina is who is going to get clapped.
Uhhh I got these TQQQ calls sooooo fuck yeah bro the Trump train gonna take us to tendie town
What would mother say
He's had the therapy bro, not happening anymore
Biden is winning the states that matter, northeast and West coast
We're not gonna know who wins tonight, either way that's bad for the market
Might as well make it interesting and break the markets with a single tweet.
Dana Perino has those nice DSL.
Lol do you seriously even need to ask that question?

Oh, of course. Liberals can't think right. Either that or they sniff the same cocaine that Biden is on.
What these 3 states are so significant?
LOL. his betting chances are popping with the Arizona win
Don't get me wrong, I agree with what you're saying in regards to economy. But the data show significantly higher death rates than flu and common cold, and that attitude makes everyone lax. If people would just wear a mask effectively, the problem is almost entirely solved

What people don't realize is that deaths are surpressed as long as hospital capacity is not overloaded. When that happens, deaths will increase substantially. Literally just wear a mask. Hospitalization is not very fun for these people, and its very costly
Interesting
AZ checking in, looking like March is when we can start buying, and we will need it if mango wins
All three appear to be postponing results until Friday.
BANNED ONE TOO MANY TIMES MODS ARE GAYER THAN FREDDIE MERCURY ON A FRIDAY IN 1979
Biden got Az and PA mail in ballots have barely been counted 88% dem leaning. This isn't over. Markets won't like that by morning
True, but Trump’s actions has made it easier for them. Alienation of our allies, putting tariffs on chinese exports so they have satellite countries “complete” their products so they aren’t exported as chinese products. Vietnam was heavily anti-china, but since chinese exports have heavy tariffs, china will have their products 99% complete, ship them to vietnam to be finished, and then exported. Now vietnamese jobs rely on China, growing their influence. So many people don’t understand geopolitics and it will be the death of America as the lead superpower in the world.

Pollsters as about a good at election as I am at stonks. Pick the fastest pony and ignore everything else
can they just fucking call Florida already.
If not, I’ll give her some stimulus package myself
wtf nevada forgot there was an election?
Whatever happens, it was already priced in
Same man same and tendies
bruh .... the most "reliable" news source

Fox News - Biden 218, Trump 148

Biden leads popular vote 

So fuk u morons
Media wanting to keep it close to maintain viewers.
You know numbers aren't final until at least Friday or even next week.
Its 2020.....watch it be a tie.
CNN seeing how long they can milk all these viewers flips to 2012 map to 2016 map to 2020 map 😂😂 I cant Lmaoo
inversing wsb never fucking fails. 

Never
Wow this is all gonna come down to mail-in ballots in PA, NC,MI & WI
they have a strong heroin addict union there
Pa def could not have been called. They have counted zero mail in ballots
Nbcnews pretty fast in update. Let’s see
Boomer af, but I kind of like it. I'll scope out some Sht for mid December tmrw
damn i just wanted weed legalized :(
So many votes left brother. Have to wait for the mail in votes.
It's not. 300c EOY
The market has been a barometer of how likely Trump is to win for months now
How can you vote mcdnonald trump and not have small pp
Arizona makes the margin smaller, but still a Trump victory.
Are trolls trying to recreate the r/politics chaos in here? Jokes on you fucks it was already chaotic here
Hey stfu the man is tired and wants to go to sleep
My VXXX calls won't.
PA, WI
Donald Trump -200
Joe Biden +150
Exactly, they call AZ quick for Biden. However they won’t call TX for Trump. 

Wtf?
Actor from home alone 2
I'm in danger chuckles
Whats the payout gonna be
good point
69
Married too huh
I am not from US
That's because they're right. Many thousands of mail-in votes won't be counted until Friday probably.
Lmfao the comments 😂
Up until just a few minutes ago, trump has by far led with popular vote but lagged big time in electoral. The system is fucked no matter what side you are on
IV crush is going to be brutal

*stares solemnly at my 330p as well*

Can we just all agree to downvote the lame ass posts saying “BIDEN” or “4 more years!!”? You assholes have subs for that shit. I just wanna make fun of two old white guys.

Donald Trump Live Betting odds -303

Implied probability 69.3%

Nice
Of estimated vote count. Estimates on total votes could be wrong, especially with how big of a shit show everything is right now. Way more mail-in ballots than ever.
*Looking at the Blue Wall, or it was a Blue Wall until 2016 when Trump smashed it*

Is Melania gonna let Donnie give her his stimulus package if he wins?
So... Buyden or Selltrump?
HOLY FUCKING NAS FUTURES!
Oh I'm sorry, who was the one who lead countless lawsuits on Trump?

Who was the one who focused their entire 4 years on impeaching trump?

All the media does is put this guy down. But you're making him stronger. Nothing can defeat him now.
They loved McCain so Trump self inflicted that pain there.
Let’s hope not.
When does the looting start I’m asking for a friend who wants a new Xbox and ps5
this is much closer than anyone anticipated, regardless of who you support. we wont be getting the winner tonight
Circuit breaker
Would say WMT, earnings in two weeks but its boomer
Hope you got puts with AZ flipping blue
Fine, but don't Alabama my United States
Lol well I’m fucked with mine then
Well shit, now I don’t believe it 😂
good thing we don't count votes by feelings.
Holding out for the best. I feel like it’s ready to crumble. Volume was weak as hell today and it struggled. So hopefully it falls soon.
gotta hit the reddit libs with the lmaos

the media is just giving them false hope, TX, FL, PA, OH, AND MI could have been called an hour ago.

guess this is what happens when you call everyone who disagrees with you a nazi and/or racist lmao. thought ya'll learned in 2016!
Congrats to that guy that bet 5 million for trump to win. Mod him
[deleted]
Hopefully. But yuan is tanking rn so maybe not😤
A blue senate and blue house with 🥭 holding would be such a shit show, but probably entertaining
Oregon is pretty lenient on drug charges even before this. 1st time possession charges is a misdemeanor already (specific amount). I wasn’t aware that measure 110 was passed tho. Link?
If Biden loses its because of the riots
PA is counting into Friday and WI isn’t reporting everything until 5am tomorrow
Fox has it called but not MSNBC which  is interesting. But Fox hasn't called NM and MSNBC has
Now that’s a vacation, daddy, I need that retard to come out the little retard

What specific policies do you like from Trump?
Uhh... don't know how you read that from my comment.
For who?
Always inverse WSB
Be honest: would you be really surprised if Pence came out gay?
40 VIX seldom lasts long.
TQQQ in the morning gonna be BOOMING
He’s already sleeping
Huh, I know 3 people personally who tested positive, and two of them are dead, and the third was hospitalized for 2 weeks.

Weird, it's almost like anecdotes aren't representative of the whole sample or something.
Keep going. Texas ain't going to flip. But it might next time. The only way to not be a forgone conclusion is to keep it up.  Also fuck electoral system. Both sides hate that shit.
We won’t know for 10 days
Apparently ibuprofen isn’t ideal at the onset? Maybe medical mask better than clothe. Best of luck thanks for your service
Imagine thinking Biden had a chance 😂😂😂😂
white girl Instagram virtue signalers are in for a rude awakening when there is no one there to drive them home from the club at 2am.
Doesn’t mean it’s any less true. Bernie polled much better against Trump than other democrats.
Red sweep?
Puts on Nate Silver too
Thanks dawg. I got asthma but my bmi is like 23 so that seems to be a plus against this.
Lol betting sites robbed autists
where do u guys check the polls result? all i seeing sleepy leading, why u guys keep saying orange winning?

I will never understand who decided this was a attack line. It's like trump trying to make fun of biden's hair. I mean yeah, he obviously had some transplants or something but you're in no position to talk.

SPY 345 tomorrow if orange wins
I’m a virgin
Fuck
Will TSLA moon tomorrow on a mango man win?
Wonder if he’s still concerned about fraudulent mail in voting?  What a fucking 🤡 President and weak-dick man...
?? No, not really? AZ gives him 11 EVs which means he would HAVE to pick up PA, MI, and WI to win which isn’t that easy
Dont worry you'll lose the rest before then
Always a good choice.
If I have to wait 2 weeks to know who wins imma be highly annoyed
He’s winning in states by so much more than he did against Hillary.
[deleted]
I like to imagine a scenario where she was the democratic candidate. She'd win by a comical margin. She doesn't want to give people free shit and she's pro school-choice so it would never happen, but I still like to think about it.
I'm gonna join your dog
Hell yea!! Trump 2020!!!
hm. I pretty much only invest in random growth stocks with a fraction of my paycheck every month. Would now be a good time to experiment with options then? I’m starting to feel like I am going to miss out on great opportunity if I don’t.
Maybe you dont understand it too well then, huh?

Why so interested if you aren’t from here. Fuck off Eurotrash. No one here gives a shit about your politics.
Agreed.
You nailed it. Education has been poor here for a while- ever watched “Idiocracy?”
Common sense? In this sub?? MODS
[deleted]
Go laugh at R/politics they said 2020 can’t get any worse, once they load that gun it will
AZ going for Biden means 46 other electoral votes in play. PA, MI, WI. 

Unfortunately we won’t know who won on election night. But AZ going for Biden means 79-83% chance he wins even with Trump winning all the other sunbelt states tonight. 

Literally going to go down to PA, MI, and WI just for the lols. PA way too early to call especially with all the mail in votes.
2016 repeats itself, the democrats learned nothing haha
Half is wsb will reeeeeeee
[removed]
holy fuck all the big battlegrounds look like a clean sweep for trump
**DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.. ONE THING WE CAN ALL AGREE ON HERE IS WSBs MODS GAY**
This is not good
Biden not speaking until tomorrow he already knows he lost 😂
50/50?  Don’t do drugs bro, it’ll fry your brain then you start talkin’ LikE tHat
This election is Crazy!
Yeah right when people started hyping up that odds were going in trumps favor. I just couldn’t find a way to bet besides my CGC calls
fox news
They’re all showing trump leading by 4 or more percent which is literally his states meaning he won already.
You really are clueless.
but im not that retarded only a little bit
Donald Trump -180
Joe Biden +135
Betting odds have it almost a toss up at this point. If trump would have picked off AZ it’d be an easy win
cringe
And beer
[deleted]
/r/politics says no one will win by today and Biden is statistically in the lead.

no one could answer who's leading in VA (?)
Nice. That means uber stays?
You guys got hit hard from the beginning and were good about wearing masks during protests.  There was quite a spike in many other stats in the weeks following the protests.  Yes the media blamed it on covid parties and other shit since they were the ones stirring up protests to being with.
AZ called for Biden. The Dems do alot better out west.
Keep ya butthole tight
[deleted]
C’mon man
This race is gonna be tighter than gnat booty
Lot of whining about PA, but most of the big metro areas haven’t reported much.
Not having to pay for so many ads on Reddit that were obviously not effective lol.
No bad news is good news
we can only hope
Boys I might’ve just made 100k from trump. Haven’t been watching what swing states he’s won but so far it sounds like all the ones I picked. So if he does win it’ll be bitter sweet lol
PA 44% in, Donnie 54.5%, joe 43.6%
WI 53% in, 51-47
Only 3 states matter, PA, WI, MI. Whoever wins 2/3 will most likely win. Right now mango is winning in all 3
Surprised they didn’t burn down their polling stations in June
Idk if Jyna is included
https://ibb.co/KsjmF5L
I live in Wisconsin and there’s a ton of hicks, so def going trump
You’re retarded if you think Canada is a shithole. Top 5 country on the planet
Honk Kong is flat bc they know Daddy Trump gonna kick their ass for another 4 years
69 obv
Arizona hurts but def Trump’s race to lose now.
No PA is red if you look at votes so far Trump did better now than 2016.
If Biden wins after this shift of odds that’s legendary
Just like the betting companies, it does not matter who has a presence in NJ, the state will be flooded with weed soon.
But msnbc hasn’t yet. Weird!
I dont feel so good, going to drink until i do

There is nothing worse than the sinking pit of fear that forms in your soul when **WSB starts overwhelmingly hyping your plays**

WSB always calls the top on a play. Always.
Trump 270, Biden 268
Wisconsin has some good cheese
Watching news anchors speak on data and do mental math is fucking great
Lots of hopes last I checked
Bruh they have to actually count the votes first lmao no channel has called any of those states
4 MORE YEARS 🕺
I think a plummet tonight when all the futures traders go to bed and we’re still contested
I never said they did a good job copying him, I just want BABA to bounce back this week like TSLA does.
Let me know if you find the arbitrage
Update: Instead of Trump I said "I voted for Jo Jorgensen" and I'm already -30 in that comment.
Imagine being a political analyst your whole life. Puts
Bruh you whack! Trump already won all the major states to seal it. They just aren’t added yet
FOX just called the election for Biden
It's not even real money it's that funny E money.
No
Never give up hope.

On a serious note. Trump wins let's say, which sectors/tickers are a buy and hold tomorrow into the Christmas rally? Currently holding a stupid amount of WORK calls/PLTR
I think you’re mistaken
Ok Im completely wrong on my DD just like stonks. 🥭 did it again. All the pollsters should quit their job and become degenerates like us. Well they already are If they are biased and caught up in their liberal bubble. I dont care 🥭 wins because its good for stonks but the whole world sees murica as a form of 🥭  man now.

As 🥭 once said he wont lose a single vote even if he shoots somebody. He is absolutely right. Also 🥭 is a hard worker. He campaigned 30 times in PA just in the last few months. That will get you the votes. 

🥭 did it. Lets be happy for another 4 more bull years and more jobs.
God, I love seeing Nielsen tanking in the after hours. Pollsters are being proven to be big retards.
That’s what they said 4 years ago
The current vote is not an accurate representation of the whole. Trump looks to have locked down many key states, but didn't get the vote yet (it will come soon)
Do you only watch CNN? Lol
thank you
Donald Trump -180
Joe Biden +135
Would BABA participate in this Nasdaq rally?
14
Why?
KENOSHHHAAAA
We good. Arizona and NJ legal
As someone not from America I find it funny Biden wins pretty much every large city yet all the hick towns vote for Trump. Puts on US Education and America
Prop 22 is winning 61% vs. 39%
The apprentice dude
It's not worth shutting down the economy and ruining people's livelihoods over 200k deaths from a flu.  That's just a bad flu season.  Multiples more than that will die from second order effects of the economic shutdown.
Red states that are highly likely to remain red aren’t officially tallied yet
🍿
Finally got enough retirees from NY, CA, and the rust belt.
Has to win Pennsylvania
Yes but choosing which way the market will go is the gamble...
arizona called for JOE BIDEN

Not over at all. This goes into next week
Red Sweep.
We should thank our fake news media and anti national leftists
You smell like elderberries.
Isn’t nio gonna fall cuz trump & China relationship? Good luck retard
Idk where you can bet but I would’ve placed a bet on Biden when Trump flipped the odds. This shit is going to Biden. Like someone said earlier, always inverse WSB.
Puts on firearm companies. Look back to post Election Day in 2016 with a surprise trump win.

I voted Gold
If it was Bernie, this would of been a different story
My 100 330 puts expiring this Friday need support
If trump wins I’m saying. CLZ0 future also up 2.58%
Yes ma’am. I mean sir. I mean ma’am.
I don’t think so, not until fuckin Pelosi gets arm wrestled by aoc
That seems silly because i know you're not arguing that the west coast is contested after all the crazy shit that went down this summer. 

Grab a drink. Cry less. Enjoy the pretty colors and the "experts."

I wonder if it's too late to FOMO into tech calls tomorrow.
penn still hasnt counted mail in votes along with michigan
I guess votes ?
He can bet on Nevada, Minnesota, Maine, and Hawaii which puts him around 229. He’d need any three of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. It’s not looking great for him.
is it just me or did trump pretty much clinch it at this point? biden looking to end up around 250 electoral votes total.

I would cum in my undies
Is this why AZ flipped blue?

Yea way more like a Hindenburg, about to take off!
Load this guy up
Trump is ahead in states that aren’t being allocated to the total
Is it bad that I want to see Mango comeback to make this close and more interesting?

Trump odds going down🤯
Palantir baby. All in on the evil eye 👁
Historically speaking this is a return to a previous world order. Not too surprising the world's largest and longest continuous empire is rising again.
Pa definitely going blue. Too many mail in votes. Michigan and Wisconsin are the deciders.

Anyone have any insights on Wisconsin or Michigan?
Can confirm. Results tonight or miss me
🚨 R-tard alert. 🚨

Shouldn’t there be a reddit dartboard with “DD”
Go to the special politics WSB sub for tonight
How is “how to move to Canada” looking on google trends?
Scary to think [this guy](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8909537/Joe-Biden-starts-election-day-attending-morning-mass-visiting-son-Beaus-grave-Delaware.html) could be in charge of the nukes.
Google is showing blue 209 vs red 118. Why people are saying red is winning?

I am not so familiar of US elections
You need like an atomic bomb of upvotes to survive 5 mins in the college of woke culture
I voted for Joseph Biden
I closed my stupid OTM positions, so I am hella salty
All in?
with votes and stuff
Mail ins, fucking dipshit. Why do you think states haven’t been called
Stop celebrating. We wont know the results tonight.

Honestly Im trying to see if I can play both sides on different betting websites
Yea, bend down, I’ll stimulate your anus
Idk what channel you’re looking at but trump won already. Texas Michigan Ohio and pa are enough for 270
Yup
This is objectively reasonable tbh
Just google hunter biden footjob or some shit lol
I have 362, wbu?
Best futures trading night of the year! Volatility is off the chain!
Lmao true
oh no Arizona oh no
It's too early, but it's looking very likely that mango will  get re-elected
Na we gooch fam
He’s fucking done
Lmfao
That shit is cool as fuck. Need that shit for stocks
Sum Ting Wong
I’m new to this so this question is stupid but wouldn’t it be a good idea to invest heavily in options based on who you think is going to win because there is almost guaranteed to be large jumps/dips when the market opens tomorrow?

Yes lord
Sentient mango

Looks like civil unrest is even less likely if this shit is drawn out. By then the excitement is gone. Who has the patience to wait until Friday? Definitely not my fellow Americans.

Well if youre going to say that, it's especially retarded to compare it to the common cold. The common cold doesnt usually warrant worrying about infectivity and spread. Under 45 age group definitely looks ok in the short term (no idea on long term effects) but when they spread it, it's pretty dangerous.

C'mon, man. I know we're on WSB, but dont do a disservice to something thats actually dangerous to a significant portion of our population. It's bad to spread misinformation, even to other retards.
SPY $1000.00 EOM
Personally, ya, I just want the person with the most votes to win. IDK call my crazy
How are my CGC calls doing
Who took the country from you bro
Probably with votes
[deleted]
Funny how quick you were to respond to this but not my other comment. And if you won’t provide your insight then I won’t change my opinion. Thus the divide between college-educated liberals and rural conservatives widens.
So bullish, like a rock baby!
That needs to be done federally
Trump isn’t able to contest pa
So guys... any news on stimulus?
Gonna take back the country from these idiot doctors.  /s
You do realize sleepy joe can’t put together a sentence
How? What states does he win where Trump is currently ahead? Feel like he needs NC
are you retarded
No, he’s a big trump fan.
Are... You trolling?
Yeah thats not coming with much certainty tonight. But its looking like itll lean rep.
Trump winning
Bruh literally every channel has one dude controlling the large tv screen like he’s Vanna White
John King sound BIG nervous
You’re always welcome here. Our Democrats love guns, our crime is through the roof if you live in the hood, and the food is fuckin top notch. This is the Land of Mañana.
Is there an interactive board like the one CNN is using available online?

That shit is impressive. I wanna look at it myself without the biased commentary. Whichever data scientist built that deserves a pay rise.
First person to guess how many spy puts I have gets a useless 🐻 hug award
See you tomorrow :)
This place is full of retarded Trump lovers who actually think he’s a Republican
👏All👏the👏mail👏in👏votes👏are👏for👏Biden.👏
I voted for biden and even I can see the liberal bias of it
[deleted]
Click to see how Bernie can still win
Maybe if he left the democratic party
I look a lot like Ricky, and I tweeted at him once. He retweeted and I got a TON of Canadian Trailer Park Girls DMing me.
check again retard
Nvm then.
Lol for real
He can count on Nevada, Maine, Hawaii, and Minnesota so he’d need any three of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Not looking great for him.
As long as their not 11/4 you’ll be fine
Yes
Nice
NC mostly go in trumps pocket. PA is the last hope for Biden.
Suckin votes away
Ill do it
Ahh that makes sense
Realized how retarded this sounds. Patients test themselves in the drive thru. I just put them in the fridge. Not horking these people's noses with a fake mask.
Shithole country
I don't understand
Yuppppp
The people have spoken, and they've said "we're fucking retarded"
Already banned with two posts in high negatives. I could use some love
Same. My puts are going to 0.
because it becomes more contested not because he picked up votes.
What’s the most likely way Biden wins?

How likely is that?
How's Jorgensen doing tonight?
##market finally starting to realize
Yo this is fucking close as FUCK

biden might squeeze it out honestly
Ugh, fine... I’ll bite. Who the fuck is this Trump guy?
13% gap...
???
They die
Democrats are in the delusion phase right now
Biden claimed AZ.
Barely any of the dem counties reporting even a third of the votes yet.
he didn't have enough space on two monitors
Not a liberal, but what the fuck are you talking about
Reporting for duty cap
baba is drilling because of the ant shit. it's still an excellent company

Shut up retart
Nah, rhino tranquilizer
Watch the Sopranos or The Wire that show is for dumb fucks honestly
🤔🤔🤔
He's also got some kind of drug so he seems to have more energy
Does anybody know any more ways that Bernie could still win?
Looking at the HP bars you would have thought that mango is losing by more than 50%



Then when you scroll down the reporting figures you go like wtf how is mango looking like he's gonna win the rest.
[removed]
Electoral college and vote gap based on remaining reporting votes.
I’m banned
Trump winning with a projected 10% chance is the reason why we have gain porn posts on the stupidest fucking positions.
Numbers don’t look good for Biden there. Let’s see Pennsylvania
Networks are working overtime to show every possible way Biden can still win. 

I honestly don’t give a fuck anymore who wins. But I can see how republicans can get pissed at the media.
Thanks homie 😚
Can someone smarter than me tell me why Florida hasn’t been called even though the margin is less than the remaining sample?
Oh he's definitely not. The Trump vote is an FU to the absolute insanity and corruption of the DNC (and old guard RNC).
china is on an upwards trajectory since a few centuries now. dont know how you want to change that short of a war. its more about making small changes around technology and competition.
Don’t California my United States!
chinavirus giftwrapped the election to dems and they still couldnt win

fucking retards

they should all be fired permanently
If Trump gets the states leaning in his favor he will win. The 209 Biden has are states that were called early on.
No clue. Could plummet at anytime if they announce no winner tonight or could remain constant
Congress has enough lawyers already.  Not that many football coaches.  It's all about diversity.
Probably a better place than most of reddit. Much better than r/politics
trumpers will say those are the rules and always have been so deal with it can't be that bad

But do you really want a system that leaves literally the majority of the country feeling like they get fucked every time? Aren't effective political systems ones that keep most people happy with the system
Won’t be me, i’m straight chillin until that old dementiated fuck tries to come take our guns :)
Just you wait. Republicans will hang in to senate and Democrats will hang on to the house. 🌈🌈🐻🐻
Missing some karma
Go eat some timbits ya retard
Early seasons yes (TPB). I stopped watching  at season 7
Our country*. Ever seen an empire collapsing before your eyes? Me neither, been a while and I wasn’t alive
Also, the democrats literally passed a bill GIVING YOU MONEY. and the republican LITERALLY blocked it. How are you this stupid
I played red dead redemption. 🤠 I’m all about the Wild West.
Let’s upvote the fuck out of someone here and then send them on a kamikaze mission to r/politics

Any volunteers?

You bring much honor to r/wallstreetbets
I just dressed up as Julian for halloween this year
Hes leading in basically every swing state
lmao
Probably. I test like 40 people a day at work for it and wear the cloth mask the company provides us with. So yeah. I ain't too worried but we shall see.
This
Idk guys maybe I'm biased but I think it's pretty early to celebrate a 🥭 victory. am I crazy?
I hope so so my uvxy 19.5/20 put credit spreads print!
Honestly how bad can baba even drill if trump wins, it’s not like he wasn’t incumbent ??
Like a tsunami it’s building up. Gotta count the mail in ballots too 🤔
Same
$SPY just got sad.
Money where your mouth is champ

Mail in ballots...
Yeah. Why the fuck do we have Dunkin Donuts and not Tim Hortons? Such a shame
He forgot to sell before close because F
Fuck MAGAts
I can wait until you liberals are swimming in your own tears. Trump will win, this country is still mostly republican and I'm glad for that. We have our country back.
check how they called Virginia. Idk how they come up with this stuff honestly
it’s not 5050. looks 8020 to me
That’s what ur mom said after unzipping my pants. Donald pump! Pump! Pump it up!
Shits actually going to continue to friday...
Worked in Portugal
I didn't vote Republican either
I don't know anything about politics or what presidents do. I just wanna make tendies
Put on an FB call spread on the close. Fingers crossed
Too late bud. Should have bought today.
well consensus seems like it will be too close to call tonight, how would market react to this uncertainty?
Too late retard. Don’t chase
Because the areas that have reported are those that lean more dem but Trump is predicted to win much more of the rest as they are heavily republican and more numerous.
North carolina and pennsylvania. Whoever takes those will win imo
Nominate anybody except a walking corpse
Classy. And very demo of you. Bravo.
Come on Trump pull this through!!!! This race is far from over.
AZ gets called for Biden, futures start to dip, go fogure
For a 1.5% move that pretty small
Fl is mixed, so is GA.
What did bringing up September have to do with my comment? 

Also making assumptions about me being a “permabull” 😂

You’re pretty dense lol.
Calm down, Trudeau ain’t no prince.
Market is not going to like that uncertainty...
why XOM? Is there some good oil news
Fox calls Arizona for Biden...
Can someone please explain to me why everyone is bullish on trump winning when biden is at 209 and trumps at 118 am i missing somethin
Proof or ban or whatever

Damn I cant wait to see videos of people crying tomorrow in the streets.

Trump lost Zona
Play the Earnings
This is what I’m worried about. If the majority of the votes that are mail in are democrat there’s gonna be claims of fraud
She is a member of Congress and I don’t think she will lose in cali. If she loses the. Cali will become all red.

BTW China has expanded their political reach and imperialism significantly under Trumps presidency. It must be nice to believe everything he tells you, but it’s almost entirely lies.
We're gonna get what we deserve RIP USA

Because our political parties are run by 60 year olds.
NO
Thanks for that. It’s pretty legit, most of the time. We have issues, but being the last bastion of the Wild West has its perks. I highly recommend the cheap real estate
The hard data shows CFR's less than the common cold for people under 45-ish, actually.  Higher for old farts. Maybe you should read the data.
Right. Which are based on what bets are being placed against the house.
No, you're an idiot if you think that. You are literally voting for people who want to give you less money if you have less than 10 million and vote republican
"Biden will probably win the popular vote but it doesn't mean you're president". This is one of the biggest flaws in our system
The keys are Arizona, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. If they split those, look out.
But losing in states he needs to win
Yoloing NIO so not really worried about this election position wise, happy the Don won though. I doubt this effects NIO in anyway.

Imagine thinking a billionaire is for the people

It can still flip until the mail in votes are counted! Kanye still has a chance!

Lowered it to 667. Someone downvote his comment
Nasty the way you talk to OUR president.
I thought big tech favors Biden? Why is NQ up?
Might go balls deep on nio calls tomorrow
Speed up the counting by only counting Presidential votes and count all the stupid shit later
Do you even math?
That’s right I remember that! Him riding off all awkward on his horse from a press event haha
80% of Pennsylvania votes are mail in and it's projected they won't all be counted til Friday.
i got wendys calls just for the meme, i ordered the chili and peach lemonade today
Wsb is definitely the place to get answers for that.
Yeah no shit. Instead they kept playing games and belittling the people who live in swing states and they got royally fucked again.
Thank you. ;)
Man idk about u guys but I’m fucking exhausted from all this shit for last four years

Shit
+11% now with 47% reported
Puts on username
Sorry bro. Should’ve voted. Magaaaaaas
F
Both sides are playing the blame game, but Republicans at least moved up on their original amounts. Nancy hasn't budged.
Yeah no matter what side you're on, it's pretty wild to see places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Florida control the fate of our nation
R/politics is melting
At least u didn’t get banned
Yeah I took some ibuprofen. Brought it down a bit. Gonna get checked tomorrow. Thanks for asking tho homie!
Season finale would be in 2024 it got approved for 4 more seasons

Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania arent being called today. Probably safe to go to sleep
Lmao that's next on the list
no one here cares who wins we just waiting on that stimmy

It was only an8l, so it doesn't count.
I love these articles dude.  I have to say, even though he lamented his creation, it might still be superior to the alternative.  Could you imagine if everyone had to work in the same room with no partitions and everyone just got their own tiny little desk?  Essentially trying to do an office job in a school setting.
Which states Biden should win to make this race tie or a contested election ?
Yep

Well to be fair, they did elect the lawyer over a suspected/alleged pedophile, so at least they have some standards.
Ordinarily I would've voted libertarian but with all of the election suppression efforts from the totally legitimate and not dying party, I was forced to vote Biden.
Hmm, thanks. I didn't like my points either. That's what I'm going to do.

They got my ass earlier too. -100 in a minute
Dude no one wants to call Florida until 99% after 2000
Now this is what I like to see
You can’t see the PA and WI mail in and early votes that could swing it
Check back on this one
4 more years of that ugly, stupid motherfucker lol. Oh well
Huh, I saw a bunch who tested positive and would have died if not in the ICU. Maybe look up some hard data before comparing it to the common cold?
Says the guy asking for what calls to seriously buy tomorrow...
Is it because it's too close to call it? Why are blue states being counted so much faster?

It’s just people voting with their money
What bullshit you looking at
Truer words have never been typed on reddit before
it’s been blue homie
I heard Wendy's is doing well, might be hiring.
Next idea for the Dems. Maybe nominate a cute puppy for the next Presidential election. A golden doodle, or a Pomeranian. I think that will get more votes next time
bought spy puts at close today AND  bet $300 on biden, so u know.. i'm doing great!
[deleted]
Mail in ballots not counted til Friday and we know lots of Dems are voting at home. I'm buying OTM puts on Friday. Calls on VIX when Trump calls out the mail-in ballots are rigged.
Ur looking for r/politics
Fucking right! Boutta quit my job
Butthurt redneck piece of shit
So why the fuck do they call blue states right away? They gave sleepy joe the whole west coast .0004 seconds after it opened but STILL won’t give trump states he’s obviously going to win?
The state isnt being called tonight
don’t really care either way as long as my calls print
reaction was what we saw today. People don’t realize that they didn’t drop 8 percent consistently between 2 days lmfao
Brainbow Sherbert orange man
I just realized I’m hanging out with teenagers not even old enough to vote.
So what? What are you thinking?
If republicans bar a Supreme Court nominee for an election year, would they do the same if it’s in their favor?? Oh wait...
Not a single tweet from 🥭 in over 5 hours. Setting all kinds of records tonight
Wait for the Vix to go to normal levels so you don’t overpay for options
We called it hrs ago

American's once again tell the coastal elites who control the media that they don't pick the president. The people do.
Fair and equal, like the liberals want.
They already said on CNN PA hasn’t counted mail in votes yet and they tend to sway blue and WI isn’t reporting everything until 5am.. it could be a toss up but if Biden gets those two it may be over
JPM just raised the price target on this to $200.
Yeah "projecting" is about right lmfao
This is what ABC said. Metro DC apparently takes significantly longer to count than rural counties.

if you think you lost money because she held money up and not the republicans youre a complete cuck
I dont know man, you guys definitely appear to have euroboners which defaults to communism for me.  America has negative cultural affinity to Europe... always seems like you guys feel like we are a failed european state....   trump is shit, collectivism is worse than trump.

Hate to say it but glad DT is gonna win.. I care more about my wallet than my values
Yeah it's been known that they wouldn't start until the polls closed. Them and a bunch of other states. That's why in all reality this race is wide open
Why do you hate freedom?
Just Russians trying to sell the narrative that Trump is good for the market
People who think polls are sure outcomes are the same who lose their money to posts on Stocktwits
[deleted]
Same. Still a sliver hope remains
Must shed blood to rise up.
I thought so too, but maybe the whole downturn was trying to price in a win for him, and now that he might lose the market is going back up to where it was before. I dunno. There's no understanding this shit right now.

TO THE MOON TILL THEN!
Yup nicely said, this is going to come down to the wire.
Downvoting instead of being able to provide an answer. So unsurprising. The truth is that uneducated, blue collar workers aren’t knowledgable enough to understand how Trump’s policies hurt them despite how much he lied to them.
Chinese stocks should tank.

So, left for college at 15 with 80k supposedly instead of 18. Yeah, big bullshit lmao. No way you made 80k in a year or so through tutoring+investing. Shit I while I wouldn't believe it either way I'd give it the *slimmest* odds

>I already posted some of my lower 7 figure trades. 

Yet you've conveniently 'deleted' them lmao.

>You realize software engineers fool around reddit and other things 50% of the time while working?

Most software engineers don't make 7 figures. Shit most entry levels don't even make 6.

Also you're missing my point. If you're supposedly that filthy rich there's no way in shit you'd waste your time on wsb.
I don’t see how Michi goes back to blue at this moment.

The sad part is Texas where there was a real chance of it going blue and it’s 500k votes red RN
You said they're all communists you dork.  One is a socialist and the other two totally establishment.  The far left doesn't like either of them.

Both states have insane amounts of mail in ballots. They won't be decided until this weekend.
They’re like 15% of the population dude, of course they’re worth that many
Looks like Nancy Pelosi's plan to hold up stimulus to get votes is working in their favor 🤡 She's a big reason I didn't vote Democrat.
Going all in on $HERB
Admit it, you’re fucking retarded
Congrats man
Would put money on Biden with these odds if fanduel had it fuck
We’re still counting votes...?
Anywhere
honest question,  why Mango?
Biden lead Texas...and Florida....
God I hope so
Gross
It was explained to me in another comment that the urban counties haven’t reported yet and they lean very blue. So unless the urban counties buck the trend of voting Dem, there’s more than enough votes to overcome the deficit comfortably. 

Not my comment, just relaying what I was told.

Think about it this way... Some dickhead calls you from a random number. 


First, you have to answer a call from a random number

Then they say do you have 20 minutes to answer some dumbass questions? 

Then you have to not tell them to fuck off and /or eat shit

Then you have to actually answer their questions truthfully. 

You have to be full retard to participate in a poll.

No you didnt. Stop karma whoring here.
Even if biden eeks out the win by slim margins here in the next few days

he will not have a mandate

dems will not be able to push for the radical reforms they talked about
Looking like VIX will fall to 29 tomorrow
Guaranteed that won't be the case as it'll still print $$$ whether you believe it to have a real impact or not
I think it’s just general sentiment honestly otherwise who fucking knows anymore
I love it
Go back to your shed and eat avocado toast for dinner.
Yes “officially” but anyone with any sensibility to count knows it’s Trumps.
Because Trump = stonk goes up and also less capital gains tax

Postal votes don’t count
Can they decide for them to rule as Co-Presidents and force them to abide to the reality TV cameras?
Yea dude, red october was pricing in for a biden win
Literally the perfect situation for bookies, decent odds on both sides for possibly multiple days
Pretty sure because it's only 60 percent reporting and it's most of the big cities still to come in. Still seems early
Wait wasn’t wall street for Biden?
can’t wait to see everybody on Instagram crying about trump winning 😩😂 mother fuckers voted for Clinton and Biden at least this man told Iran we’ll blow them to bits if they want action
If Trumps win the popular vote, but loses the electoral college, will Democrats including Nanci, dead Ginsberg, etc listen to their own advice and abolish the electoral college?🧐
60% cash, wish I was 100
Ok guys I’ve got 50k of cash sitting around. What do
I do with it tomorrow?
Truth hurts.  But America once fooled can't be fooled agin.

Yeah I hear you, all we can say is good game and move on.
Puts on nate silvers career
Yea there is still like 10 red states finishing the count, should put him around 300. There is only like 3 blue states left to add votes
People are so stupid in here. This is going to be contested because of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. If those flip blue its going to be right down to the wire. People are celebrating way too prematurely.
[removed]
Nice
They haven’t but OH and PA vote counting so far shows Trump is doing better now than in 2016 in counties that were counted so no chance Biden can pull a comeback. Michigan is hard because Detroit hasn’t been counted.
because the votes remaining heavily favor Biden.
It's because of the counties left.
I would shit

Yep... it was literally the mini Cultural Revolution for 21st century America.
VA has a bunch of dense urban districts that have been inexplicably stuck at 29% counted for a few hours. Nobody knows why. Once they are counted it is expected to surge up Dem votes.

Are the Dems gonna keep that same energy about how unfair it was to win the popular vote and lose the electoral vote if it wins them the election this time?

It's gonna be close and the states aren't being called tonight. VIX popping off tomorrow, boys

let’s just say i’m not surprised that the dems got roasted again
What do futures traders think they know that is rubes don't?
if trump wins AND wins the popular vote? wawaweeewa
Same here. It was given to them even without counting. Haha
im fuckin dead😂😂so godamn true
Says more about Biden
They said PA hasn’t counted mail in and early voting yet and wisconsin isn’t reporting some until 5am tomorrow
You were right on that Indian food dude. 😋
What platform?
So my uvxy calls have a chance?
Gay
Swing states trump leading by 500k votes. Without 4 of them Biden cannot hit 270
Commie state or hunter?
How does the electoral votes count work? It's showing 209 vs 112 in favor of Biden. Are a bunch of red states not being counted yet?
Guess it's bedtime then
It looks like this will be a contested presidency that may head into the courts.  If the Senate remains republican, then it looks like we won't see a stimulus bill for a while?  Don't get why the markets are up.  + rising covid cases and europe in lockdown.
PA and WI will go to Biden. Postal votes will get it over the line.

Whew that was one tough bear market guys.  Strap in for SPY 500 by 2022 and don't buy puts unless they're on SQQQ.
I’m not sure Biden could say the same though. Sure he had a scandal but it didn’t get the same air time or steam behind it. Which is why I say this is more surprising for me than 2016
Pretty much. I'm only slightly more liberal but this shit is mentally exhausting. I don't even use any other subreddit because of all the Trump posts and comments it ruins like 1/3 posts.

I expect my vision to become true. Trump is going to win tonight, Biden is going to win on the 12th. I had a vision about this around a month ago. I posted it on one of the subreddits.
OH, PA, and MI haven’t reported that much yet have they?  Anyone reputable outlets projecting Trump wins in those states?  Doesn’t he need to win them all?

lmfao honestly, 98% of votes counted in FL, he’s got a 400k lead and CNN still wont call it? meanwhile, CA appears on the screen and is automatically clutched by Sleepy Joe.
Something about a red mirage
Fox already called it
Apparently 400k votes with 2% left to count is relatively close
Bolt Up brother
He already did
Florida is Trump - he also has a big lead in GA

Stockholm syndrome at this point
Biden wipes back to front
If they tie 269 269, can they run as Co-Presidents and we have a reality show following them around all the time?
Congrats on the sex.
Thanks bro
You kidding or just slow?
So your argument now is that Trump is better for stocks not because of longer term S&P 500 performance but because while the market was closed Trump is performing better than expected? You really do belong here.
So? They didn't call a fuck ton of states trump will obviously win.

I'm saying he can't get 40 more electoral votes.... It's 118 now for Trump.

And no, I didn't vote for Trump, I'm looking at the map and doing the math. Just my thought, I'd rather make the right prediction, and that's my prediction.

Make yours, how many votes does Biden get? What states swing his way as the path to victory?

Northern Virginia isn't counted yet and is blue af
That will be a war
I’m retarded and bad with words but when the market was tanking, it was pricing in a Biden victory. Now that brumpft basically won we can move on and start the next 4 year bull market
I sell premium. Don’t care which way any of this goes. Plenty of long leaning strangles, I’m doing great. Doesn’t change anything I’ve said.
Will be ironic af if Biden wins the EC but loses the popular vote haha

I'm trying to figure this out too. Someone here has to be smart.
[deleted]
Don't know why anyone still trusts them
Lol check the charts bro, historically bears feast in September. But stick your with perma bull bull shit and see how long you last
Yessir
Right.  That’s not my question.  Any wrinkly-brained retards wanna give it a shot?
Can someone explain why Virginia is shown as a win for Biden yet trump has 52 vs 46 percent Biden
A lot of great state parks. I saw a squirrel once
Nah just confused. Somebody else told me some key states are not counted yet
I voted for Biden but now I want mango to take it lol
I thought it would be a biden blowout....looks like it’ll come down to the wire
this is so tight
I had no idea trading view had a graph of this, so cool!
Bruh I'm a democrat and know we are the best at snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Its embarrassing
they (CNN) don't want to lose the ratings - they want ppl to think there is still a chance
What has Biden lost that they were counting on?...  especially if he wins Arizona.  How are you saying it’s not gonna happen?
Ya didn’t understand this either. Guess they are just projecting Biden will end up taking the lead?
No I think there is a greater implication to it..
1300 shares @ $30. To the moon
Yuge Puts on lady Gaga
Who runs the WSB twitter account?
Yeah have you not been listening to the news for the last weeks? Early numbers will show trump lead then mail in will come in all for Biden

Penn repub counties refusing to count mail in until tomorrow to encourage this narrative
Imagine  thinking you're going to get a good night rest tonight
I just wanted ye to win
Yeah looks like Trump won. Don’t have any positions but fuck
Because China and Donnie don’t get along
Just Philly lmao. Like why is that so hard?
It depends on state laws
Non Americans are having a tough time to understand the elections. A few friends did not believe me when I said Trump has won already practically speaking.
:(
I usually hate it when people say proved in to everything, but I’ll agree with this one
This is far from over, way too many trump supporters celebrating.
0
Man there’s going to be some pissed off people here shortly 🤣
Sigh another 4 more years of this shit.
Y’all really counting out my boy howie Hawkins like that
Cash gang going strong?
no patrick mayonnaise is not an instrument
🤔
I don’t think they know what a swing state is. There is a difference between a swing state and a state that could potentially flip.
That's not really how it works. It's not a sport. No one is winning until it's over and someone has won.
California shouldn’t be worth 50+ points, bunch of homeless people and celebrities who are out of touch with reality.

Glad I sold my tsla this morning oil the play get in early morning sorry tsla, but you still the winner baby we don’t want oil no mo, everybody following papa
Yes, you can even wait until tomorrow
is a nice place, good beers
What are Trump's bovada odds now?
As long as it helps my calls idgaf
If you are looking at asian markets that is in response to ant announcement today. Tomorrow MIGHT be different.
No he has basically won it he is up in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and NC
It ain’t over until the BBW sings!
It's quite a reliable blue state so easier to call early
so do wildfires but ....
It’s over. Accept the Don won. Guh.
Florida is 98% counted just call it lol
Soo it comes down to Pennsylvanian Georgia and Florida 😐
Its recovering. DXY falling. Was down like 5% at one point
election thread is dead.
And then moon some more
the common man in America reads at an 8th grade level
Man I hate Trump but nights like this remind me why I hate democrats so goddamn much.  Bunch of idiots.

Maybe telling everybody you are going to ruin the economy is a bad strategy or something
What’s so hard to understand?? Biden is the worst candidate in US history.
Lol I never said you said Biden was a good pick. Whose the biggest idiot is the issue. Biden is.
Please direct me to any updated site where he's not leading in VA
Yeah. I would love to be wrong on this one.
left media already reeeeeing on trump, so predictable
Aren’t trading hours closed?  How does a halt happen
just shut up man hahahahahahaa
If Joe doesn't win them it's over
Ah yes, I also dwell in the past.
You won’t have a penny left
Because.....???????
No. Markets rally because it's pricing into the end of this shit show!
Chinese currency is tanking, they are predicting Trump win - what does this mean for markets and stocks?
[deleted]
They are way behind sadly. Last I checked something like 40%. Michigan official said it could take up to 80 hours
They just called the entire west coast Blue. The map still looks like 2016ish.
stock market is pricing in trumps win idiot
Hedge most likely
We might not even know the real winner until the weekend. This week gonna be wild
Inferno!
Neither, literally a 50/50
A news agency can call a race if they want. Doesn't make them right. They're holding out on Florida and Texas which is 67 votes alone. The rest that are polling having in Trump's favor put him at almost 300 total votes.
They starting to like it I bet
Of course the algos know it's Trump 2020
Well, polls are closed so that’s moot.
They can’t speak it into existence so whatever.
Dude its your fault for not knowing risk management and acting like a retard. Anyway, if your wife kicks you out, this is your new home.
Jesus why are futures up so much rn
It ain’t over until the BBW sings!
I do. Which is why I have been dedicating my life to Wheel it. I found the light.
sure it will buddy
My lord, jeezus. Jump fucking shitballs. They are interviewing some idiot alone in a room and she is wearing a fucking mask. Democrats are fuck-ing re-tar-ded.
It will print BIGLY
My pre erection poll results were always big red
My candidate is not going to win. I’ll be making a lot of money tomorrow. Feeling pretty lousy all things considered.
Yup. Assuming he loses Arizona, he still needs to win one of Michigan, Wisconsin, or Minnesota (in addition to pa, ohio, nc, ga, etc) to win
Even though trump is way closer to winning than he was against Billary. Smh
Biden lost
Just gonna have to happen the old fashioned way, Elon will make clean energy cheaper eventually
[deleted]
They are FAR more important to everyone's day to day life but so few realize it. States still have a large say in politics compared to federal but the presidential election is so much more attractive, so people focus on that
If every other state can count there mail ins before why can't Pennsylvania?  Smells like bullshit.
Don’t think the markets are gonna like it for a Trump victory
why TF is Virginia called blue? at least wait to have a blue lead with 60% votes lmao
Are you surprised? Most of this sub is actually retarded lol.
“Biden with now a large lead” with them auto giving him CA but won’t call TX/FL lmao!
Good one
They’re all fucking horrible is my point lol..
Why ?
A few weeks of burning businesses and looting, then BLM returns to it's 4 year hibernation in Nancy's nightstand.
Trump
"Assuming Biden turns thing around and wins Virginia, assuming Biden wins PA...."
ESCALERA OOOOHHH
Ohio and Texas will be called soon
Lol these fucking pre election polls are garbage
TACTICAL CASH GANG DEPLOYMENT INBOUND
Donnie won. If Biden wins every blue state left he still don’t have 270, the red states Donnie has support in will put him near 300
Thank you
Oh no doubt if Trump wins PA its over but I don't think it's there yet since they are counting mail in ballots tomorrow at the earliest
I’m honesty not understanding how Trump is still the betting favorite.  It seems like he has the more difficult path to victory still.  What am I missing?
Trump leading by 500k votes in all swing states totaling over 270 lmao it’s so over
Damn and I really though California was getting sick of the dems
If it was super close that would be the case, but we can be pretty confident of the winner “Tomorrow”
Exactly, all ya got is cheese and bank fraud
CNN loving the phrase “but it’s still early on”
Imagine putting up a male Hillary and expect the result to be different this time, Dems learnt nothing from last loss.
sell at open on the off chance there's massive profit taking...
[deleted]
Fuck Trump and his bitches
Because in those states the deadline was met and mail in ballots are counted. DUH
if its 50/50 you should go make some bets because the lines are far from 5050
Why?
BLM is a bullshit agenda hidden behind a purposeful mask
it's Trump right now
The karma has really gone up tonight
whichever way tonight swings i think we can all agree, i ain’t never seen 2 pretty best friends it’s always one of them gotta be ugly
Russian troll
I’m pretty sure it’s the other way around
That’s what mango wants you to think. Mail in will sway it
IM SAYING!!! I dunno how this isn't talked about more. We are in worst case scenario mode right now
[deleted]
lobsters and good hunting i guess
I was gonna buy calls if today was red 😢
TRuMP AlReaDY WoN
How is CNN still trying to piece together a Biden win?!? They’ve been doing this for like the past hour already. This guys right arm has got to be on fire right now from all the pointing and waving.
THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG 

BLOW OUT MY ASS SONG

AND I DON'T REALLY CARE IF MY ASSHOLE BLEEEEEEEEEEDS
You can't go full retard with tqqq. It's the safest investment. If you don't understand that you're actually fuckin retarded.
Trump
They’re raising taxes from 4.95 to 5.95 if it doesn’t pass. Unless you’re making over 200k, there was no reason to not vote for it.
You can tell who is over 18 and voted or has a functioning brain by comments saying this is over or trump is going to win the popular vote
Same here. Hopefully they can be considered us tech for a day. Unless something happened has Jack Ma been sent to the gulag yet?
once again, cnn wants u to know "we have a long way to go"
Many states already counted the mail in ballots. That’s why Biden took leads in some states right after polls closed and ended up losing that lead
No chance of that
Trump
[deleted]
Pollsters are absolute trash
Michigan is allowing same day registration and voting?

Does that mean if I am out of state student attending U of Michigan, i can register and vote?
In the end, we only care about money
Lol no it’s not
Just wait until the magical mail in ballots get counted...
Betting odds are betting odds
well, i think VIX will spike if i’m right so
We should do a race to see who gets kicked out faster
Clinton probably would have won if not for the very well timed email scandal. That swayed alot of ppl I think
That’s an error
Noted. 285c for December
Nio 3500 EOW?
[deleted]
CNN is so sad. They’re counting NE-1
I honestly don’t know what I’m looking at. Can someone just outright tell me who’s actually winning at the moment?
Yeah I’ll pile on, why?
If apple hits 225 I will be soo happy
Someone tell me my 11/4 SPY 334p will print!
Conspiracy 🙄
We calling some of these states yet?
There’s really grown men in here begging for attention the same way 14-year-old boys do
All I see is a sea of red
Man, I hope you're right on that. One of the staff on Crowder's show has predicted MI for Biden, I can see some merit in that.

Like I said, fingers crossed if suburbs turn PA, MI and WI for Joe.
Wasn't PA the last to call last election too? Whats up with that state

And AZ leaning blue rn is making this race tight af
Whose winning ?
[deleted]
Use white background and save some ink geez. Guy with the chart is the actual retard
Because he's not leading dumbass
Its still too early to tell whos gonna win you turbo autists
Is this the greatest moment of 2020?
That's gonna be my strategy for life.
Friday minimum they keep saying
Will we know Michigan and Wisconsin tonight? That might be our only chance of knowing soon
Not including pa Michigan which is another what 40 or so
I went bigly on spy like a retard. Should’ve gone straight tqqq
I could honestly care less but when have you retards ever seen a president have retards fully decked out in political gear of course DONNIE was going to win... lmao 😆
True autism. They just dumped the obvious WC states into Biden's tally because voting closed. It was always going to happen.
Arizona is my nigga 

Love you bois, stay blue

Riced in
CNN goodbye
People who said this wasn't 50/50 should be.
80 million California’s gonna vote all for Biden and it won’t mean shit
Betting markets are 70-30 Trumps favor. There wouldn’t be uncertainty of who the winner is. Delay may be? Sure. But winner will be 95% confirmed tonight it looks like?
Who called Virginia for Biden?
Futures > Porn > Election Results
Lol Trump doesn’t like big tech
FACTS
What percent of cali is counted
PA wont be in play if he takes NC along with the ones I aforementioned.It’s over.
[deleted]
The key swing states with a shit of electoral votes looks to be going towards Trump. The current count was expected. However, after the swing states report, Trump looks to have a healthy lead.
Why is VA still blue when Trump is leading?
And r/conspiracy
It ain't over till the fat mango yells
My NIO will be so red tomorrow:(
Breh if it goes down just buy more.
So essentially the pump the past month was due to a Biden victory priced in is what you're getting at?
The worse COVID stock
Essentially, stonks only go up!
Except for September

House already been called blue
Jesus that’s a stretch. I’m assuming 125? Even then, I hope spread that off
Assblasted lmfao
Lose weed?
Biden and Clinton are nothing like Sanders dude lol...
He can't just tank the market lmao he doesn't just have a switch he flips that makes it go up or down

&#x200B;

Edit: oh wait yeah he does it's called twitter
Honestly kinda more interested in state and local props at this point.
He has half the electoral votes right now. Wont win california. Pretty sure donny only gets 4 years.

Edit: maybe spoke too soon. Hes down, but most of the remaining states are likely to go to him.
Why?
You’re an idiot if you think he’s not going to win PA lol
FL is already counted i believe
[deleted]
Cnn didn't call it
My guy it is what it is. You want to fight over Alabama and those fly over state? Damn shut up
Wrong arrow bud
if the algos pick up the headlines, were good. Not as good as a blue win, but meh
I thought once you go gay you don't come back?
Districts drawn like that on purpose
they need to decide how many to manufacture
They didn't count fl, ga and tx yet
It looks like Mango will even win the popular vote! This is hilarious!
Who tf said Texas was a swing state lmao
[deleted]
Gotta think Yang would have taken him to the mat
Huh? No. Trump has the momentum but FL, OH and TX are 29 + 38 + 18 and he has to get to 270. With Fox right now that gets him to 233. NC and GA get him to 266.
Republicans won’t go after anti-trust issues I assume
It’s not counting Florida Ohio pa and texas which is like literally 125 points
people blowing their load way too early, mail in ballots will be mostly blue bc covid fears

&#x200B;

Idk how these people are calling anything either way rn
Okay mango supporters, just because I didn’t vote for your orange emperor, doesn’t mean I want communism...
CNN: “if we use a traditional map” lmao talk about WORRIED
Never have traded futures. I am well versed (lol) in options so can I just buy a futures bull call spread and it's conceptually the same as an option spread? Like all I can lose is the debit right?  Really itching to get in some action rn
Vaccine and stim gonna pass lightning quickly after election 😂😂
..... dude do u even know how this works? Biden has +400 odds rn go bet on him if u want
#Tonight is proof that most people secretly hated BLM.
So it looks competitive
Y'all some fucking retards if you think this is anywhere to close to being a lock for trump. It's still 50/50
repubs and dems can both agreee that pollsters should be beaten in the streets
If California flips I’ll take a 1 year ban
Glad that I went full retard buying TQQQs.
Turns out reddit was right: the market tanking in September and October was pricing in a Biden victory. Yesterday and today was pricing in a trump victory.

Republicans don’t regulate anything except abortion and gays
WHERE IS JAH
I need Trump to win so my PLTR investment moons.
Counting is not the fucking hard - report the numbers
Lol they did that for votes, once they get elected they'll forget about it.
Why do you say so?
They just called it on fox
I just wanted that sweet energy initiative, fuck everything else
It’s not looking good for Biden....
For every seat you give to someone else because of race you denied another the seat because they were the wrong race.
All other subreddits are for group think
If you look at a map with district voting results and ignore state borders almost the entire country, geographically speaking, is voting Trump.

Cities need to pay attention and liberals need to get off their high horses and out of their little bubbles. There's a reason Trump is rolling so hard right now and it's not racism.
You think they'll still both be alive in 4.5 years?  They old as fuck
A show of respect to the putholders from last week
Those are itm dude
Let me tell you about a little stock called GME, an epic short squeeze and did I mention Michael furry invested in it?
My favourite part was making NKLA the monkeys
You're delusional if you think he's winning PA, they even stopped counting tonight and they're the deciding vote.
Virginia, already called for Biden.

Only 60% of votes counted and Trump leading by 150k votes....

MSM: “The deep state is a fake news conspiracy perpetuated by Trump.”

Also MSM: “Biden wins DC 92.6% to 5.9% that went to Trump”.

Compare DC voting stats to the rest of the country and it’s obvious DC is a swamp.
Red still means less regulation in general, which is good for megacaps
CGC as well!!
209-118. You’re saying trump will catch up? Lol
I too was delusional once

Yup, only place where you won’t get downvoted into oblivion for being pro Trump/Biden.
This one is green.
Hey, you can hate on Trump but it looks like he is going to take this. I didn't vote for him twice and I'm willing to be able to say that.

I have bullish positions. So I'm happy.
Everyone said Texas was a swing state. I kept saying hell nah. Bet y’all feel stupid now.

Nio is the next Tesla. Nio will make millionaires
Nancy pelosi looks like she didn’t take enough virgin blood and adderall to hide her despair.
Yeah they don’t start counting mail ins until polls closed as opposed to other states who have been counting
CNN HAVING A TOTAL MELTDOWN LMFAO
Love how the called it “End diversity ban”

Our constitution won’t let us be racists is a more fitting title
why is Nasdaq futures mooning, considering Trump wins and republicans are after tech companies lol
The issue you will see is if we get a red majority across the congress as well...The consolidation of power will force Tech to bend at the knee, which doesn't bode well for them...
They wont have new skits if Biden wins
shit youre right hes getting crushed in those states
Bullish moon
Would trigger an automatic recount
Are you retarded? Lol
Good bot
Looks like the fair tax won’t be passing. Pritzker is tucked
Thanks for the in-depth analysis.

Personally I think if Biden holds AZ strongly like it appears to be, that shows his strength in the suburbs like that has been showing all night. 

PA, MI, and WI are ~~easily~~ are more likely going to Biden if that trend holds.

That’s 57 electoral votes that are still very much in play.
Puts on the prices
Let's all be honest tx isn't going blue 😂 that's like red illinois

Its the start of the next bull run
didnt he promise an election special?
Look how quickly Nancy Pelosi decided to stop wearing a mask.
new Jersey just legalized weed. Will this be good for my MJ calls? Or is this shit priced the fuck in?
He’s gonna take PA, Ohio, TX, and FL. It’s over.
Ok buddy but I am so bullish I’m in for $30k.  You are right on this one.
thanks man. I was waiting for myglasstrip's call
Election will come down to PA Mail in ballots which will take 1-2 days of counting.   Shit can still go wild.
I was making more of a jab at NBC and CNBC saying “Too close to call” and “too early to call” nearly every other sentence....
Why the fuck did they just start counting mail ins this morning?
It’s Biden leading 209-112 run but ok

Pennsylvania is going to be counting ballots for fucking days?
Also why everyone turned on them.  Anyone with half a brain can see through their fake bullshit narrative they are forcing.

So true lmao. It’s a Biden worse case scenario.
Only 45% reported in PA - this is gonna be a shit show

Lol I love how Fox/CNN called Ca, OR, and WA with 0% of the vote counted. I mean they’re not wrong, but it is kind of funny that they call it before anything is even counted.
Sorry, wrong. Kanyes got this in the bag
just be put buyer lol you can win in any market
I’m a dem and it seems Trump will win, unfortunately. We have to accept, adapt, and move on. I guess the consolation is that the market will reacted favorably to him wining and I’ll get paid.
Fox just called it
what's up with AZ?
It WILL be different tomorrow!
CHRIS WALLACE DID A 'GUH' when fox called Florida for Trump. Turn the volume up and listen.. THIS IS SO AWESOME!! All the crying, whining, fake nees, BANNING US.... THIS IS SO... SO... SWEET.
Just call Texas for Trump already. Texas is synonymous with republican, don’t pretend anymore just call it.

I'm with the band gang.
Pelosi is so gross 🤢
Realistically, I would close all bullish plays tomorrow if this tech trend continues. At this point Trump looks to be firmly in the lead, but on the off chance Biden takes it with delayed ballots, this could come crashing down again. Play logically, not emotionally

A lot of people getting very excited and making up their own facts. Man it’s going to be a tough comedown for those people. 😂
No, it's over.... Just my thought. This doesn't change with some mail in wave.

[deleted]
Cali is counted in already, stop watching the news and just use google
There's a 4% lead in FL. If it was biden I would call it
For sure but like why did they call that shit instantly while florida is still pending?
Correct
No, not at all.
I’m a dem but realize it’s not. Trump will win, unfortunately. We have to accept, adapt, and move on.
Florida Ohio and Texas put trump alone is no need to even watch anymore. He won officially
[deleted]
No, Michigan and Wisconsin in my opinion
And Michigan and Wisconsin
we won’t know winner for a while methinks 


puts don’t look that bad actually but i am gay bear so
they ain't the only ones in shambles
Better than puts
My boomer shit is up huge this week, thank god I joined Puts Anonymous.
East coast > west coast

Which coast has the NYSE and Washington DC? 

East coast runs shit, that’s why you west coast boys have to wake up at 6:30am for market open
Lol you would have thought that 2016 would have been enough. We literally watched Trump botch the handling of a pandemic and the democrats still couldn't get it done.

Who bought Nov 6 3500/3600 calls at close? This guy.
Futures slowly dipping
Are you retarded? The election results haven’t even came in for California yet. California is a blue state with the largest amount of electoral votes.
Same here thought I’d get free money from the election not half my account wiped
This dog is a genius.
They ain’t over
Yea, i doubt it’ll happen but he has a relatively large lead now and it’d be funny to see regardless
they just did
He won states that he was expected to win. Trumps leading in the battleground states
Florida called, Futes jump. NOICE.
Biden Clinton & sanders god damn how desperate are you all to just send us to the gutters bunch of communist 😂
Still not called with 97% votes counted
It’s Cali, it’s safely any democrat
Interesting
[deleted]
Yeah, I could use one after all this shit...😂😂
Cali says hi
Keep telling yourself that 👍🏼
Nancy pelosi is such a cunt.

Rifle is prepped

Trump won.

calling it now. Don't see a path for Biden. He at most gets 250 electoral votes.
so i sold anticipating an iv crush. however the green may overpower that? should i just buy back in tomorrow lol. it was long dated options on crox and noo
Nancy Live on ABC
You can't go by votes alone.  You have to consider the counties like you said.  They still need to count the tip of VA, which is where a gigantic population is that is Democrat.  VA is blue.  It's not in doubt.  VA is like 90% Trump land if you're only looking at area, but the vast majority of the population in VA actually lives in Northern Virginia and are democrat. It's extremely densely populated in NoVa.
Puts on pre-election polling from now on
They haven’t given half the states yet bro
**FLORIDA**
\+North Carolina
Say one bad thing about Biden in /r/politics and enjoy your -50 downvotes lol
No, it's expected states
No.

this was expected tho 


voted no on all the amendments at least
[deleted]
Didn't he say he would pass the best stimuli we can imagine if he win. Can't imagine he would have lied to us!
Yup. You know it’s real when NBC is favoring trump
Hell mode.....
300c for Jan? Idk don't listen to me
Puts on Louis Vuitton, gonna get cleaned out like a yard sale
CNN is fucking sweating
At this point this really could be the worst case scenario of the election hinging on recounts/lawsuits in the rustbelt

Imagine if it actually flips after days or weeks to biden and he squeeks out a win by the tiniest margin

This would be the most likely scenario to trigger widescale violence by militias and anti-fascists
CA called for Biden probably
They’re not calling most of the states where Trump is leading
Same question
But Virginia is blue, trump won the popular vote, I'm sad about it.
Its really gonna come down to PA and OH?
GREEEEEENNN NEWWWW DEALLL YOU FRACKING DORKS
# HAHAHAHA WE GOT FLORIDA BITCHES
Lol I saw some idiots averaging down on their puts today.

Hope all the bears get massacred ALL OF NOVEMBER.
Finally
All have high mail in counts which will take a bit to be counted. Probably won’t know for days
Why do people keep saying this? NIO ONLY SELLS IN CHINA.
How does that shit work? Who's up to call it instantly or wait?
Well said
Imagine if Maine goes Trump
Donnie pump takes Florida!
Thats part of Badakathcare
Bull gang please take me back I swear I'll never be bearish I've learned my lesson once is enough
This won’t fuck my NIO will it
If Trump is up by 600k and there are 40k outstanding mail in ballots, you can call it
you really need to educate yourself
WEN 🍔🍟🚀🚀🚀

Beauty of this place is that I can say I vote for AOC, you can call me a cuck and we are still retarded together talking finance. r/politics sucks big time.
Thats what i’m looking at and then got really confused when I came here and saw Trump was winning
Bigly
Literally any other candidate would’ve been enough
I'm not a fan of Trump, but I am a fan of seeing Leftists crying and moaning... especially on Reddit.

And for that reason, I'm team Trump tonight.
Hey, not bad, at least you’ll smile
Lmao its unreal how hard they try
Already in put in the future market to lock in my gain till market open.
The feeling that he won’t lie or skirt questions in all cases

It gets cold up here
Why is Google showing Biden with almost twice as many electoral votes as Trump? Are they just not counted yet?
This makes stimmy sad :,(
[deleted]
If Biden wins, do these futures mean nothing as Trump would rank the market? Or is that not how it works? 🤔
That's the way market works these days

Because that’s happened in the last 4 years 😂 keep crying
What are the chances California flips?  😂

I ask myself that every election
I know for real. Biden was projected to win those swing states but is gonna lose them lol.
Alexa play panic by the Smiths
Fck those guys, VA is RED AND STONKS GO UP MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN

If this ends with Biden + Republican Senate we are FUCKED 📉
It’s funny, because all the democrats had to do to win this election was pick someone who was competent. And they picked the one retard who was completely incompetent

What a scam to call west coast so quick.

If trump gets ahead by 1.2 million in PA he can safely call it.

West Coast best coast
Looking in the mirror. CRY FOR US!!!! MORE TEARS HAHAH I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!
U da ho
Well isn't PA Impossible to call til they start counting the mail ballots?
Once PA and the others come in, trump wins. It’s practically over for Biden already

Look at AZ. That’s all you need to know that he isn’t getting slaughtered. Especially in the suburbs. 

I honestly could care less either way, I wanted a clear winner tonight regardless of candidate. We’re not getting that. Just calling it how I see it.
Leaps on all vaccine makers

Well we won't know for sure until maybe tomorrow night so it's possible
Sooo NBC is basically showing this as a landslide to Trump...
[deleted]
[removed]
I still think biden might win with mail-in-ballots. Just like when the bulls get IV crushed... you never see it coming 

🐻🌈🐻🌈
I don't think they'll call it tonight. They'll accept mail-in ballots that were postmarked today.
This has it at 192 - 114 Biden right now
hopefully they dip im gonna come up big.

NIO will be propped up from China alone. They dont need our market. but it may just experience a shock and stumble
I live in Cali rip #TRUMP2020
They immediately call the west coast states but STILL refuse to call Florida. What the fuck
 Cubans
Jesus AP just gave the entire west coast to Biden without any final reporting. While Florida is still isn't called with 97% reporting? FFS
No chance source I live here

Yeah, but we won’t know until Friday due to the count in PA, which the race will come down to if Biden gets MI and WI. Lawyers will have a field day.
So how does PA, GA, and WI not calling the election tonight change futures?

It was a joke. Trump literally won already when he won Texas and Florida
Hey sorry forgot about this. It's already more popular than I like and popular tickers become meme tickers. I'm more confident about a play that isn't spewed on WSB a bunch I guess is what I was trying to get at.
FD for your FDs
Lmfao California INSTANTLY went Biden. No surprise but fuck they didn't even wait 20 seconds.
Shocked.
Why not? It obviously favors less qualified black kid over more qualified Asian or white kid. It's the literal definition of discrimination.
Burry deletes his tweets after they are no longer needed. He did that for covid where he posted a bunch and then suspended his account. Now he did it again. The account isnt deleted just temporarily removed. Whenever he wants to say something hell use it.
Floridian here, redder than vix
Amen
If Biden wins AZ: he has a 83% of winning. If Biden wins Nebraska 2nd as well, 93%. If Biden loses Nebraska 2nd, 76%. 

If he loses AZ: 52%. Along with losing NE 2nd: 44%.

The race isn’t being decided tonight unfortunately people. It’s literally coming down to PA.

[deleted]
I bought shares instead of calls...SQ and Pton... should've bought calls..
Dude Trump won Indiana
I’m really confused by the VA call for Biden too but it might be that the more urban counties that lean blue and have the larger populations haven’t reported yet. I don’t know if that’s the case, but I could see it being that way.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
for sure. i'd vote for her. but of course, she was "canceled" by the 'RUssIa!!!!' crew like stupid hillary...who called her a "russian asset".
I sure hope so

Might as well 💎👐 it and just play golf a fuck ton whilst drinking my sorrows away. Good thing life is plenty more than just money to me. Although money would make things more interesting to say the least
37 put end of Nov. I hate that fucking ticker haha
Yet.
Well some trump supporters really are racist but I don’t think that’s the majority. I think a majority just got screwed over by Obamacare because companies started cutting back, now Biden wants to introduce more radical taxes. So most I’ve talked to just like his policies a lot more.
Wait if trump wins and the republicans hold the senate but the dems hold the house, aren’t we back to “STIM TALKS GOING WELL”?

Trump is carrying states he won last time with smaller margins so if that carries on he will lose the WI MI PA trio and Biden wins

I'm watching the meltdown on the young turks on youtube and they're crying about racism and sexism.   Salt prices are about to go negative!
Nope, a data driven observation. I was actively reading conservative news media in 2015 and 2016 to see what the other side was thinking. Based on that I predicted right wing and centrist vote going to Trump, and I was right.

In 2020, my hopes for Dems reduced even more based on -

1. Their response to the protests and riotings after George Floyd, especially in fiercely liberal cities.
2. Their very reverse take on COVID-19 handling, it seems right-leaning and centrist Americans didn't like that.
3. Biden-Harris positions on fracking, court packing, illegal immigration. None of those were gonna fly well.

For Pence, his shining moment was his VP debate, and if anything right voters will and probably did see him as a strong potential presidential candidate.

This is fucking awesome btw. It’s a futures contract that expires at $1 if biden wins and $0 if he loses so its basically giving u market sentiment on chances of him winning
LOL, its official. Dems lost SC Senate race. 

Dems just spend money without results. It’s like shooting a lot of bullets without aiming
I hope pelosi is optimistic tomorrow
I think trump will win by the AM and he will file a suit to contest the mail in ballot if it start to turn against him. Early/ mid day.

Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, NC, Texas, Wisconsin— at least 6/8 of these are guaranteed trump wins yet they aren’t calling it. Trumps literally up by 200k with 58% in Virginia yet they called it for Biden.

Was not expecting things to look this good for Trump.

I voted for Biden. But if it wasn't for that stupid measure in california making it legal to discriminate against whites and asians, I probably wouldn't have voted. I wanted Mayor Pete on the ticket.

So eh.

edit: I wonder if Trump will go nuclear on fake news if he wins. Polls being wrong twice in a row is almost impossible and will be super easy to paint as a conspiracy.
Source? I’ve watched his odds go from -400 to -300
You’re honestly probably fucked
I wish, I voted for her.
But still didn’t expect trump will lead popular vote in any stage. Media became joke again.

I voted for Biden but I’m projecting a Trump win, sadly
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/03/election-ballot-delays-usps/

the coronavirus, trump’s own focus on election fraud, and the funding cuts to usps have set the stage for trump to “win” the election from an in person standpoint and refuse to acknowledge the mail ins (which likely favor Biden). The loss of hundreds of thousands of mail ballots does not surprise me. Going to get wild.

Plenty to see tonight still...but I think trump declares a victory and tries to stop the counting of mailed votes.
[deleted]
Were you a mod at TD
kamala was a horrible choice. Biden is a moderate and he chose a far left person in kamala. That was a huge turn off to all moderates.

Not by any shot. Az Wisconsin Michigan pa decide this
so is this actually closer than we think?

trump obviously favored, there’s no doubt 


but if biden gets arizona — word on the street is he only needs to flip one swing state
Post this to r/politics lol
Trump has it in the bag. If Trump can win twice that should be a wake up call to the folks asleep behind the wheel at the Democratic Party.
Will never happen because of California
All we need now is Trump getting a clear and decisive victory, 305+ votes, 1.5 million popular votes and the SPY hits 350 EOW
Watch it be contested and we go -1.5% by morning
If only the libs realized they if they tried owning their opponents they could win
Game over Trump wins
Fours years procrastinating, four weeks finding a slightly worse candidate

Perhaps, but the gap in these swing states is getting large. That and a contested election is the worst case scenario for stocks.
I’d go 7k on TSLA, NIO & PLUG.
Why? Is Joe leading?
Lol so uh.. Trumps actually gunna win huh?
It’s not.  Politics shouldn’t be banning people over innocuous horseshit like supporting Trump or even saying something remotely negative about Biden.  It’s also a default sub so that’s generally the first place people are going to discuss the election.

Little pimp definitely put him over the top
no, house is projected to dems
I mean, you’re calling it a “portfolio” 🤦‍♂️
Anywhere else?
I'm gonna set that ask higher asf tomorrow.
Currently, Trump is at 108. I am expecting FL, TX, GA, NC, OH, PA, MI, WI, UT, ID and AK to go Red. That's 175 votes, so 283.

If Montana and Iowa flip, that's 9 votes, and with Iowa looks rural Iowa votes are coming in slowly towards Red.

If AZ flips, add another 11 to get 303.

Biden is guaranteed CA,OR, WA and HI, that's 78 to the current tally of 131, bringing him to 209. If he holds to MT, MN, wins NV and AZ, that's 20 votes to him. NH and ME are 8 more total, so  241 total. If he wants to win, he must, must flip PA and WI. I don't see that happening.

Edit \[08:04 PM PST\] : AP just gave CA, OR, WA and NH to Joe, taking it to 209 as I predicted. Montana turned Red, and just a matter of time before Iowa does the same.

Calling FL and NC to Trump any moment from now.  


Edit \[01:48AM PST\] - WI just flipped blue, if it remains so then Biden has a shot, all boils down to counting in MI and/or GA. If not then more tense hours ahead.
VIX over 30 still, I don't trust it guys

It’ll be like the last election, where all the pussy hat wearing dumbfucks who didn’t event vote go out into the streets to protest so they can pat themselves on the back like they actually accomplished something.
That it’s obvious Trump has won

I don’t want 4 more years of Trumps mango face plastered all over the news. I’m tired of this grandpa
All this futures pumping; when all this is over and the market remembers that absolutely nothing has changed, the drop is going to be SO FUCKING BAD!
That's just because sqqq stopped trading- no one can short until the morning.
Stimulus talks going VERY well
Wsb sentiment says trump? Means Biden is gonna win it. Always inverse.
Maybe 435
Careful now...pitchforks might come out any time.
Honestly kinda shocked how crazy this seems to be in Big Don’s favor, feel like the Dems just had to show up and again even with way more voters it doesn’t work. Crazy stuff.
still a long night + mail in votes

edit: but lol

this is going to crumble when everyone realizes we aren't getting a winner tonight
It too, was a fake out
Why
Zero chance he wins wayne county.
This is all noise at this point. 

I'm gonna play Skyrim with 900 mods for a few hours and try to forget about the world
Riots, SJWs, zero charisma, and controversy around his son got too much traction.
so not going to crash I guess
I bought a bunch of FSLR puts. If Trump wins what is it opening at?
Trump -240, Biden +180
Looks like I’m buying that Dave smith OB6 baby ❤️

CNBC this afternoon ohhhhh we like Biden it’s all good for Biden market will pump... AKA ALWAYS INVERSE CNBC
I can’t dig it up, but hundred+ down years ago
RIP. 

Seriously if Trump wins is where those come in handy. R isn’t known for riots, the young D are. Imagine their displeasure if Trump wins? Those bitches could print yet..
SP plenty of times. Tech not since March but with a lot of shorts covered now it could come back down to earth
I’m 😴 Biden and I forgot this message
We had some nights in March that were massive
Sleepy will bring tendies for ants
Trump has pretty much won, damn polls really suck lmao
They would have a good chance with Yang but they fucked it up. Good for them.

You mean after “votes” are “found”
i really think kamala was an anchor for sleepy's campaign. if u recall, she was the 1st or 2nd democratic candidate to bow out of primary. she's completely unlikable and arrogant. i absolutely loved tulsi destroying her in the debates.
I don’t give DD often so listen up. if Trump wins here buy MSFT ASAP at open. Riots/looting/civil unrest will mean a lot of Windows need to be replaced and who sells Windows, Bill Motherfucking Microsoft
Damn just got banned from r/politics
Damn drink some chamomile brother
He was on stage endorsing trump last night historians will credit him with the election victory
Wait there up on hopes for a clear winner we will see what happens threw out the night
I think in shambles 😬😱
Watch them bring out Tim Kaine
Bear Lives Matter
Whether Trump can run again or not is a moot point. Look at the influence he's had on so many people. It's something I highly doubted would happen but the normalization of this far right and alt right ideology isn't going away for a long time
Nasdaq got that hulk boner
Trump = pro keep economy open
Biden = pro be a pussy

Easy pick.
Calls on safe spaces and cry rooms
The Silent Majority
What are they now?
Well, that's your mistake.
Members of r/politics are so woke
I literally cannot understand how even with Donnie's mishandling of the pandemic the democrats couldn't figure out how to put forth a candidate to beat him. 

  
My calls are happy but my brain trembles.
Shit u got the ‘rona?😷
Errr... Who exactly is predicted to win?
[deleted]
Edit. No politics I gotcha. :)
Some states counted early before and some just started today.
He pissed them off with the tariffs
Breaking: CNN now projecting Biden to win FL if he gets 107% of the remaining uncounted ballots.
Don't celebrate yet. Who knows? Maybe we see an uno reverse card.
Upper middle class (100-250k) seemed to think Biden will increase their taxes and voted for Trump as per polls.
^^^^HERE  ^^^^HIDING
Haha I literally have been saying that for an hr
Everyone gets a 4 for 4
I sold $500 calls, I swear if it makes me lose on that
Would you hold aapl calls or sell in the morning? 11/13
Ahh, cool. thanks for clearing it up, thanks bro. Futes don't lie. Also, the yuan is tanking which supports a mango win.
Looks like we’re fucked mate
Hey hey hey. That does NOT help my confirmation bias
And here i am, forgot to buy my puts
This shits got me more stressed than trading stocks
In many states the early votes were counted and reported when the polls closed...
Trump is a bully. Can't win even handed.
Sir this is a trap like no other
Nasdaq and it went up $25 todsy
Gay bear get fucked again hahaha

Can’t wait for this to go to Supreme Court and the totally unbiased court of hand it to trump

Holy shit Georgia and Pennsylvania (philly) stopped counting we are going to fucking go crazy tomorrow 👀
Oooooo forgot to check that one! Thanks brother!
Reply with ur most downvoted r/politics comment & score.

“Hunter voted trump, hes lowering drug prices” -45
It’s not over yet, at all. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania determine everything
All they need is good leader. Someone like Obama. Hilary cunning, Biden too old
Biden is getting absolutely slaughtered. This is gonna be worse than 2016.
No sir. Lots of happy Canadians out this way.
Lol. Move em by their pussy
Holy shit Georgia and Pennsylvania(philly) stopped counting we are going to fucking go crazy tomorrow 👀
I honestly don't know why everyone is acting like Biden has already lost. It's literally anyone's game right now.
\*call. I did have two until I wanted to minimize my risk today. I'll take your blessings. <3
Song title limit down
1 million votes under total for 2016 and those should let Biden win
You realize Trump has fetal alcohol syndrome; right?
Baba down 8% in HK
Thanks yeah I’m more poking at bears haha it’s only one mini contract

Bovada odds narrowing
Where’s that damn fly now?
Depends when they expire I think. Penn could make all the difference.
Yet they’re refusing to call Florida, lmao, msm is fucked
95% of the vote counted in FL

CNN: “it’s still early”
[removed]
Lost 100 karma instantly on r/politics God they're fucking sensitive
when it suits her.
Yeah same, at first. Then they really start escalting.
Same for rich Charlotte bankers
Trump voters are the last ones counted
[deleted]
Her record is terrible.

I think her background is quite inspiring though she made it from nothing and I respect that.
I’d be more shocked if an 80 year old won
no one will ever convince me to buy puts ever again, I've been hurt one too many times
CNN not calling VA yet

Anyone saying either candidate will win is projecting
Sooo my puts won’t pay tomorrow?
The US is actually ret-rded.  I thought it was kind of, like a funny joke... but this isn't the blue sweep we were looking for.
Mr. Vice Presiden~~t I'm speaking~~  I'm losing
Some states report delayed ballots sent by mail, e.g. Utah gives estimate of arriving between Nov 10 to Nov 17. Stocks should stay flat for now.

There was no huge orders in NQ, most probably algos just playing the news.
Bears, good news we hit circuit breakers. Not in the way ya'll were expecting though.
You will split your differential and tip the fuck over my friend.
I don’t. People have to realize voting blue doesn’t make you a good human.

If the DNC puts another octogenarian in 2024, I’d laugh.
well, you can’t fix stupid
[removed]
I really don't think this is true. I think it's more mixed than people think. Not saying it will sway results though. That I don't think.

I think this magical flip flop people think will happen is ridiculous
Anyone know why tf is Iowa a blue state??? 

You’d think corn country is Trump country
Feels like we got some /politics people here on downvoting streak 🤣 we are here to make money you people
Maybe because she was rated more liberal then Bernie Sanders when comparing voting records
This is gonna be the inverse of March or April isn’t it.. so we come full circle 

We go and limit up now just to wake up to -3%
JOJO
She seemed too far left for many independent voters.
If this shit reverses so many bulls gonna $ROPE
No
People are worrying too much. Trump did better than most thought but it was still going to be Trump jumping out to an early lead because of Republicans vote in person more than Dems.

Give this a few days for things to become clear after mail in ballots are tallied.
She slept her way to top.
Vixy
He should really stop trying to project elections based on faulty poll data.  It was way off in 2016.  It's way off in 2020.
lol someone in r/politics just now “guys I’m beginning to think those polls for Biden might have been inflated”
Imagine thinking that participating on the default politics subreddit and getting banned for saying something remotely negative about Biden and subsequently banned is considered brigading.  

Reddit desperately needs to fix that sub.
I will never trust any of those polls ever again.
Yea
Half cyborg half god. We are on to our 5th planet.
What “it” are you watching!?  Look at Texas, Florida, Georgia, etc.
Probably true for most of us here
PayPal yeah
agree but im sad i pussied out today because of election now i hope i can get in before all the action.
Made her bones lying on her back.
If trump could win the electoral vote by 30-100 votes, Florida gop by 3-4% (I think or maybe I chose 2-3% lol can’t check bc predictit is down) and just a Trump victory, I’d be a happy guy with a 4x return
She’s a hypocrite. She’s going for the black vote but as a prosecutor in CA she put a ton of black men behind bars for drug offenses.
I weep for the republic.
Hopefully 420
Bruh... I can only get so hard. Please stop.
Said the same thing in 2016
It's also running the wheel in Antarctica

That would be very cash money of you Mr.market

Middle class

Pick one
She’s smug and laughs when she can’t answer something
Biden brings in regulation and uncertainty.  The oil industry and the ability for the America markets to prosper have only be able to do so well because of the Trump administration’s ability to deregulate the EPA, make great trade deals in the best interest of American Companies and out the American markets first. 

This is why we have seen the markets soar.  Biden and Nancy Pelosi have called for the repeal of all the work the Trump Administration has done.  Biden and his son have uncertainty with China and or Russia.  More uncertainty for the markets.
Didn't have a choice after she told me her kid was an autist.
I agree but think my puts are fucked into oblivion right now no matter what

So no Alex Jones on JRE?

Fuck off
You definitely bought puts at close and now you’re effed 😂
Dems stop appointing career politicians you fukks
Russia man
Swing states tho?
Rip in peace 😔
Who the fuck is Jo Jorgensen on Libertarian ballot?
Market could be pricing in the best out come- Dems take both chambers of congress with a Trump win. Trump spends like a dem and they will get big stimulus done without congressional republicans, but limit Dems reach with raising taxes
Is this a real person or a character from a tv show?
Bro.

Wow. $1022.25????!??? Teach us your ways!!!!  BAN for not reading the rules. Retard.

Why, Biden didn’t win?
This...but this is also the doomsday scenario where Trump declares victory tonight and then election is called for Biden in 3 days
My TSLA calls = 😎
Literally the Soros playbook.
I quit. All my extra money going in VTI shares and not looking for a few years.
How uvxy looking tomorrow?
They swing fast though. Futures are very emotional. Theres a lot we don't know in the rustbelt yet
Wendy’s earnings tomorrow before open, that’s what’s pumping NASDAQ

Everything is going to surge until December

I've been wondering that all night.
If you want tendies you need mango.. look at futures.. booming!
Imagine Cali leaning Red or something wild Lmao
Wonder why it's such an echo chamber with literally no different opinions allowed. Lol fuck them.
You know the answer brother.
No political comments. Only money comments pls
community of beta bed wetters
What calls to buy at open seriously tryna make atleast 100% on a day trade
I'm less sure about it being a toss up, but if the mail-in votes change it to biden after a day or two, then that's likely the situation for the most outrage with how trump set the stage.
Church of Trump, insanely impressive
Ok nostradamus
I honestly think the democratic party is FUCKED if they lose this. In shambles.
My iPhone, even 2 years old, looks so new, because of new screen protector

Not really fucked
7. Stimulus passes

8. Stonks go up x2
Goddamn Democrats need to learn to stop bringing these half-dead half-asleep old white dudes  up to vote. 

Remember folks, if he can't make a basket, he doesn't need a nomination, he needs a casket
Yeah but biden got virginia (fox news), he might take NC and GA. Shits a toss up. Either way it lands its still gonna be a turd. Just a slightly different kind. -
Shitton of votes in NOVA
Futures so fucking confident tho lol
i fucking hate this sub 😭
Damn baba going to gap down hard tmrw. Oof, I fucked up
Nooe
NC went to Trump mainly because lot of rich middle class in Raleigh area voted for Trump who previously voted for Hillary. As they did not want tax increases
We don’t know who won

Plot twist: Lil Yachty drops album tomorrow

If that's true, COVID 19 is about to get a riot bump mid to late November.
From what I’ve seen market pumps on social discord
No I actually sold puts. I'm just looking at the counties analytically. This is far from decided
[deleted]
It's not like nq will never be below 11,400 again.  We will sell off end of week.  I'd get really bullish though middle of next week when things have settled down
We’re screwed. Short term good, next four years not so good
If NIO is up in the US is it down in Australia?
Betting on a trump win was much easier than the stock market
Damn we really getting 4 more years huh
Think if trump wins hes gonna be gracious toward biden during his speech? My bet is HELL FUCKING NO lol. Hes probably gonna rub it all over his face😂
People who voted trump obvisouly voted after 5 o'clock because they fucking work at jobs

Someone explain to the retard (me) why VA is called for Biden even though barely over 50% votes and Trump leading largely?

I'm just here for the free shit

They’re big mad
Contestion isnt off the board. Democrats said they will contest no matter what. They will claim mail in ballots
they counted the early ballots first in most states
That a real thing?
Crazy Nancy via Antifa
I hope so. I sold a fuckton of puts when the $18p were $5 each (for like 2022 or some shit).
SOMEONE TALK ABOUT VIRGINIA!!!

HOW TF IS IT CALLED FOR BIDEN???
My ICLN calls are fucked. Glad I picked up RTX leaps

Few more days of posts like this and I'll buy high
There is still plenty of opportunity for things to get fucky.
We get it, you have puts
They are deserving of a lot of blame themselves

They just called it. Trump wins
Not even mad about taking max loss on my credit spreads according to futures
We don’t even have the Rust Belt 3 numbers yet bc they’re too stupid to count.
Started several hours ago and it'll still be going long in to the night.

We're all getting shitfaced tonight.
NBC ad: I’m so ready to go to work 

Me: you are so not ready to go to work
Remember guys, you shouldn't care who wins. You're here to make money no matter what. Just use whatever happens to your advantage. Be a player, not a pawn. You got this 👍
Yep. What a moron. But he was probably told to say that by his socialist handlers.

something something choking
Yang gang
Pennsylvania Chads
Wait what’s going on in Virginia
No.
Jorgenson
Probably higher after trump wins
Would buy if profits were to be used on yolo calls
Yeah pretty much. I viewed Trump contesting as a nonfactor since he could whine all he wants it wouldn't change anything.

Now I legitimately want to know where these Trump votes are coming from. Market goes up because apparently him contesting was a risk.

But this is worse.

If it's up tomorrow I'm going with the dog and buying more calls on leveraged inverse products, expecting it to reverse mid day. Keep in mind when he won it opened down a ton and rallied.
I understand that reddit in general is a left leaning community, but r/politics is a whole nother level of bias.

How the fk did I managed to get banned from r/politics . Bunch of vaginas.
Oh right, I don't trade futures. But there is a futures market for trading those. So anyone who has an account there can trade em.
So who blows the horn to signal the rioting to start
i’m so far left i can’t fucking wait


haha, die neolibs die
Ditto, and these calls ain’t cheap!
Mail in ballot printer go brrrrrrrrr
For real.  DNC will blame Trump for not being fair or something.   The Democrats just fucking suck.
With the election being decided I would expect 5-10% up

Yea where can I hit that?

Trump got TX and FL...
Good time to buy next few days?
Really feels like this is it
If Biden somehow comes back to win futures will flip back to the Dow.
Lol, yeah I show it was called for Biden. 56% reporting with Trump up 52-46
You sure it was 50k? I saw 2 people that bet he'd get 5% of the pop vote, that's it tho
Didn't we already knows most votes today will be red votes until they go though the 90m early ballots? These results are skewed today.
I agree, I don’t see how either side can be confident rn
a gei bear detected, hope you get a green dildo in 3 hours more.
Haha no u are fucked at open. They will be worthless
Dum dum Democrats thought that if everyone voted they’d vote for Biden.
Hope y’all and your 401ks enjoyed being the strongest country on earth
They'll be ok but worthless
Gets the people going
I bought both
TRUM-BULL county

its a sign!!!

Trump won Michigan lol. Cnn just flipped Wayne county and trump is up 3x from his time vs Hillary 😂
You love to see those fucks in shambles
Man I sold 5k worth of 345 calls at 4:12.  I regret it a little bit now, will regret it a lot if I wake up and levels have held.

Edit: BRO

Edit: forgot to include bro
Oh boy your puts are fucked
While I personally think Donnie is a disaster and a liar and didn’t vote for him, I am really looking forward to the left crying over this.
U god damn right
John King going harder than Johnny Sins atm, no time to take a breath
No one tell him 🤫
Insane how Trump has built a cult behind him. Ngl its super fucking impressive.
McConnell doesn't have to do anything once the election is over with.  Trump really doesn't either.  He says he wanted a big stimulus, but you never know if he just said that to get elected. He could actually turn into a fiscal conservative President in his 2nd term. You never know when there's no re-election to play for.
Or Elon Musk
Holy shit riots are going to be insane this entire week
I can’t wait to see what excuse libby fake news media is gonna say about this blowout
I love capitalism. Wall Street loves capitalism. Nasdaq loves capitalism, straight bull loves capitalism.

What happened when no capital gain tax remains no capital gain tax?

Capitalism Baybee.

My calls Baybee.
4 more years of calls
“We are gonna make them pay!”
shouldnt have paid those bills to gamble I guess lmao but no good on you.
So how are the futures trending up? Who can trade?
The lucky few.
Ehhh this is still a tossup imo. Milwaukee, Detroit, Philly all way behind on counting. All three under 30% reported. AZ going well for biden. This is a coin flip right now in my mind
[deleted]
Stonks always go up
Yep
Same
[deleted]
Don't interrupt them!
The night isn't over, several states are within 100k votes. It could still be contested.
Well should be pretty easy to beat Trump in 2024
So basically stock market is back on easy mode, weekly yolo spy calls and we will be straight
If ur up by 4% in FL, you've won it. Thats a blowout
🚗
People who don’t understand probability, yet again
[deleted]
yeah, but trump can’t run again so

and i still think he will lose the popular vote


trust me, there is a huge amount of people still not voting
[deleted]
We retarded enough to try to buy calls at open?

Lol I never said Biden was a good pick, the way you think I'm for him just cause I oppose Trump is exactly the problem with today's political landscape. Cause of people like you it became party over country. They're both idiots that shouldn't be President
 Give them nothing, but take from them, everything!

Futures up bigly.
Pay your internet bill
Yang and his VP is a robot
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK CHINESE STOCKS ARE AUTO FUCKED IF TRUMP WINS?!?!

He says all this shit about China. Yes. But why would he delist or somehow screw all these publicly traded companies? At most he will sanction political figures from there. Da fuq does nio and jack ma have to do w anything.
Hop on the trump train ya dems, chu chu 🚂 mfkrs
Looks to me like China is still green?
I’m dumping 50k into spy at open
Lol mango finna end up being president for ~10% of our lives.
2028
 Same got busy at work and forgot lol
Fat joke. Good man!
Honestly are my puts going to be ok tomorrow morning?
Im feeling the aame way lol
Future don’t mean shit lol you really think the nasdaq is going to close tomorrow at +4%
Please let that be. I have a NKLA call and I'm probably one of the only six people here with one
Bigly.
So where are we at now?
No one knows what it means but it’s provocative

Imagine if Joe biden concedes before market open. 🌕🚀🌕🚀🌕🚀
Gay bears must recoup the losses.  Riots all night
F*ck that guy - I’m salty cuz Tex Tech stuff
Like Trump wasn't going to win? A vote for Dems is a vote for riots.
Ah so he’s not actually winning yet, but is ahead in the counted votes. Okay thanks
REAL TALK

Can anyone find the link to the retard who bet 1K$ on Kanye West receiving 50k votes for à 50:1 ratio?

This retard might not be autistic
True buy with these green lights calls may have been the way
If I want to dump a bunch in shares at open, do I go UDOW, QQQ, what?
Long $RIOTS
This is the way
Shhh....let him retard...
Gree
Believe 😀

Prpl calls on deck
pulling up by the brrrr machine?
*mUh EaRlY VoTe*

Acting like Biden is 100% in the early vote
Fuck I got downvoted so much on Politics it doesn't let me post more then once without a 20min lockout. Bundle of sticks subreddit.
Dude, if the dems lose this year after the US response to covid 19, then the party doesn't deserve to exist any longer, much less win an election
All it needs is a little push over the edge
Then I will be REALY REALY full of tendies
Even Trump stated that at his rally. 

Said, "They had some real killers on that stage and they went with Biden. I don't understand it."
Ah ok, so what day do you project? 11/10? or sooner
I wish... But only during market hours for options, and a little before and after market hours if you want to buy stocks, hope it doesn't spike too much pre-market so we can grab some more!
It just went down for 3 weeks in a row
Yea China is gonna get their ass ripped for 4 more beers
No. Correction still coming. Sell covered calls.
That, thank you.
no? everything still ticking
Stock market looking good though
These dumb CNN anchors still did not get the pattern. If trump is ahead in early counting he will definitely win that state, if he’s behind he may win that state in the end and that’s obviously because they start by counting mail-ins
[deleted]
LOL
God bless
Start printing ballots
So we arent getting a winner tonight are we? Maybe I can reinstate my bovada account tommorrow
Rahm be crackin' jokes all night
I see, that's probably why futes are up. But I'm looking at the electoral count and Biden is up big and we haven't even seen the east coast yet and Cali has like 55 votes. So Biden should win big right? or am I retarded?
TIK TOK TALKS GOING WELL?
[deleted]
Is it done and dusted? Is there a surprise in store tonight?
Black Friday came early this year
It's official.  Fat turd at Young Turks melting down loudly.  I'm calling it for Trump.
Calls at open... but on what I only have so much money?
CAN WE GET A NASDAQ FUTES TRUMP TWEET ONE LAST TIME BABY??

Good call.  Sold half at 920 and have been watching them since then....
MongoDB, Amazon, Square, Shopify, Carvana....we can keep going
PAMP IT
Go to YouTube and watch "The Hill" 

Their coverage is pretty good. They aren't wildly speculating

They are using the AP electoral map
Wait, is this bad for the BABA dip I bought? 😂
Anyone else go cash gang before the election and starting to regret it?
CNN - Biden needs to find 400,000 votes and mount a comeback in Florida.. after 95% of vote is counted.. come on now this is just sad
Sold so many amzn puts spreads. Fixing to be rich tomorrow.
2 high 4 me
Lol I wish I had more fucking calls😂😂
I am proud to be an American!
Weed is for dorks get excited and snort some gator tails or transcend and smoke some DMT or dissociate and inhale some nitrous and do some ket
FFFFFFF
DXY dropping, SLV calls gonna be ok
Because the media is disgusting and people don’t like being told they are racists going to hell.
You can't kill what's already dead. Have you seen stock prices this week.
Why did I bet against trump, fuck my puts
Imagine your last name being Tuberville though lmao
How are you getting that lower bound or higher bound for that matter?

It is headed for a contested election imo
what if gme short squeeze also comes tomorrow with all the action omfg
The bookies say yes: TX and FL seem to be pulling to Trump
Ouch
How does NC's dem gov win reelection, but presidential counts arent in yet. How many people these days vote for the other party for congress?

He had a landslide for Biden and basically marked every battle ground state blue except GA

True but I’d rather be here than stocktwits or fintwit
Fade the pump the risk/reward isn't there if you chase momentum
Ouch, I hope you make it back or things turn around before open brother
Thx mate just placed a bet
But I think he’ll lose in the end. Watch the futures tumble in premarket.
It's not a wave, he's eke-ing it out in a few important states.
Yikes red gang we should just join the downtown riots I guess
Ugh bag holding my 11401 short on the nq futures is tough. Is this how bears always feel? Just looking at losses hoping the market goes down like it should!
4 more years of Pelosi. Get ready for stimulus talks going well lmao
I’m in puts but also in a lot of calls so idgaf
I think we all look pretty retarded rn
Gtfo
It’s been going up since his presidency so I don’t see why it would get fked? Maybe trade flat
My boi Trump pulling up by his bootstraps!!!
Guys within all this chaos of the election and Nasdaq, don’t forget that one random day this week, NKLA will be up 13% on no news.
Will you retards stop brigading /r/politics? Holy shit.

This is the #1 cause of subreddits getting banned on reddit.
Probably tomorrow if not tonight
Trump won by 12,000 in Michigan in ‘16
i said a couple days ago (as a joke)
"bad news...i voted for trump. good news.....i forgot to sign my ballot."

i got banned in 2 seconds and had -56 lol
Doesn't really matter.. trust me.
Lol

Wait, is this bad for the BABA dip I bought? 😂
No
TQQQ gonna be up like 15% tomorrow lmao
I got 5k in cash on the sidelines in prep for a correction. Looks like Trump is winning. If I wake up to a Trump win tomorrow, dump all my cash into the market at open?
Futures are always here to give a true unbiased opinion of projected outcomes
Donnie earlier today said he had an acceptance speech and concession speech prepared

He also said “hopefully I don’t have to give both”

Seems to be foreshadowing a “win” with in person polls only but a loss when all mail in votes are tallied
That’s just it... they won’t
Deploying cash pre market! Gonna spend every penny
[deleted]
why?
fine with that
Yeah I'm about to get absolutely fucked on my SPY puts and UVXY calls tomorrow, fuck me
Even mango will support tsla and solar because it creates job.
hopefully high enough to get me all the tendies

Fox hasn't called them yet either
I guess the algos like that trump is winning 😂
My portfolio is fucked, I'm looking at a 10k loss at open
oh my god i hope you gay bears sold your puts
Yes
Ohh ill add that, thanks.
Haven't they called everything Google Elections live data has officially called or does that not fit your narritive?
Yeah it’s not called a circuit breaker you dumbass
Everyone saying baba calls are fucked, fuck u stop making me sweat lol
They must be devastated over there... knowing they’ll be called the “fake news media” for another 4 years. Anything to put that off a few more hours..
Relax and smoke some weed boys
Too many people have big tech gains this year
Hahahah me!
How my AAPL/SNAP/ZM/SWBI/CCW calls and TSLA puts looking?

Disclaimer I do also have some spy puts, vxx calls, and other bs
Only this time Donnie is gonna make it bigger than ever!! Promises made. Promises kept
Still counting votes for Texas. True cnn meme status right there
imagine betting against america
Biden finally posted a spanish tweet. An hour ago. Literally after most polls closed. Advantage - orange.
"THE MAIL IN BALLOTS"

"OUR ECONOMY HAS NEVER BEEN GOOD" 

Fuck this guy
CNN coverage is horrible - I need better data
He’d do that even if there was a landslide against him
Bro they halted everything
Because Trump looks to be winning by a bigger margin than in 2016. 

Also more minorities are voting for Trump than in 2016
Good thing Biden won Arizona. Hahaha fking retards.
[deleted]
Thats why you buy 11/6 puts when everything starts becoming more contested and questioned over the next couple days
Any of them
Haha, I do have some amd calls too, I couldn't resist buying after it dipped so much. Too many people waiting for the post-election pullback, so of course its gonna happen before.
[deleted]
538 would be wrong if they said he had a 0% change of winning. You sure you know how percentages work?
What do I look like, not a retard?
My conversion back to bull gang is complete.
Biden getting hammered everywhere you look right now
I’d pay for that onlyfans
Fucking get your news from google ya commies 
Orangeman is winning 



He is your president
Anyone check out the politics sub?
Nasdaq futures up over 3%. Mega green tmrw
Mango will make sure no mail in ballots are counted.
Calling it hung like my step-dad
It's gonna be people stealing TVs from Target
This is retarded, so it just might work
It would be.
So tomorrow is going to be the greenest day ever?
No, 611k shares is how many the contracts add up to. So 6,110 call contracts, that they paid $2,652,000 to purchase.
😂😂😂 
Meltdown incoming!

Trump 2020
Wonder if that means they’re about to call a swing state
Be honest, who’s in puts?
Yup. Lots of dem supporters voted absentee. Nothing will be settled tonight...
I’m a perma bull and this is the one time I bought SPY puts, cuz I was sure there would be a contested election and things would get fucky.

Serves my ass right I guess.
Nate is not having a fun night - the angry hordes on his timeline.
Have you considered not yoloing your entire account overnight?
[deleted]
He might be just autistic enough to pull this election off.
Bidens like the warriors in 2016 damn
Yup, anyone think he can sit still? He's gonna do a lot, idk what it is but there's gonna be a lot of it
No one knows, someone put $300m on 340, 350, 370 debit spreads expiring this week on interactive brokers

ALL MY FUCKING GOD GIVE ME CALLS
Will write in candidates count towards overall votes for Kanye West? He isn't in the ballot in some states
no, i’m not an accelerationist


but, biden was hardly progress is all
Final Predictions -   


Lower bound of 283 for Trump, middle of 292 if Montana and Iowa flip, high of 303 if AZ flips.  


If I am right, then two things -   


1) Never trust polls.  


2) We might see another Republican president in 2024 i.e Pence. The current wave of Trump voters will absolutely want Pence as president, probably even anti-Trump republicans will do the same. There's a decent chance that the US might not see a Democrat president till 2032, if Trump pulls a victory tonight.
Gotta build suspense
1) Trump wins election night

2) Leftists Riot

3) Democrats contest the election

4) Mainstream media calls Trump a dictator

5) Dark winter

6) Stonks go up???
man imagine the legendary memes that will be created
I saw this... don't know what it means but somebody seems very optimistic lol
[deleted]
CNN doesn't call races. They use an independent agency to count votes and call races. It's the same one that everyone uses, except for fox news (who has their own)
I suspected the green, but my balls weren’t big enough to bet on it.  Thank fuck I’m not holding puts.
Potentially. Still easily could flip. 65,000 votes and multiple solid blue counties haven’t finished their tallies.
Leaps. Before it hits 50. Hold while it goes TSLA style next year
so my 336$ put on SPY isn’t bringing me my tendies? welp time to wake up tomorrow to be down a hefty chunk of change
SPY 362c 11/4 printing?
LOL show me the crying snowflakes like they did in 2016
This sub will go bankrupt if that happens.
Roasted bbq chicken with 5 cheese blend and fried mushrooms and onions
Keep in mind rural areas cover lots of ground and are always red.  But not a lot of population.  For example in Illinois Chicago votes blue, the rest of the state votes red, and we are a strong blue state.

😝
Yang 2024
Seriously. Florida, Ohio, NC, there aren’t even enough votes left for Biden to come back.
What tech stock to go into at open
Biden back in it
literal braindead take
CA still has not reported.
Shop
[deleted]
Yes. It’s obvious
Why does it matter? Trump won, it's done
Some of the big spike for NIO is due to Biden/Harris saying they will invest/lean laws to benefit clean energy companies. It's gonna have a quick dip if Trump wins.
Tech literally just won’t stop pumping. Holy fucking SHIT
CA not in lad
Negative

ALL HAIL GOD EMPEROR TRUMP!!! FUCK ALL THE BLASPHEMERS, OUR LEADER WILL SMITE THEIR WITH A FURRY OF A THOUSAND SUNS

What’s SPY by open?
Ain't nothing wrong with getting a little saucy my guy
Fuck it, I’m switching to this thread from the /r/Neoliberal  discussion thread. My guy may have lost or only won by two votes but at least stonks are up bigly
xDDD FR
You've clearly never been on or worked on a farm or have any clue what's important to those people.
Accelerationism? 🤔
Damnit I blew my load too early
Back to always going up. gg bears
They have been surprisingly guarded with calling anything early
You should see this more as the disease of Trumpism becoming even more viral
stonks only up
My fucking QQQ FDs are gonna print crazy tendies in the morning!
When do the riots start
ban
It means trump has more of a chance then it seemed originally and futures are banking on that
Imagine setting up your portfolio so that only a major catastrophe will make it print
That's what you get for listening to a bunch of 24 year-olds who work the counter at Enterprise

I guess on Friday market assumed we would have no president and suddenly today it realised we will. Wtf is this.
I went incurious glad I figured out I was straight this morning.
CNN will be in disarray
LOL, why aren’t they calling Florida for Trump? 

98% of votes in. Trump leading by almost 400k votes. Only 200k votes left to count

Meh.  I doubt it.  Can’t get much worse.  I think they bump on earnings Thursday.  Maybe China will day haha just kidding in a couple of months.
the market didn't care who won imo, cause stimmy is going to happen either way
They had to halt Nasdaq Futures? Damn you, who puts CBs when futes are mooning!
God damn trump is going to win tonight huh.  I don't even watch the media and still got bamboozled into this stupidity. Rip my uvxy calls. And rip me for saying my nio calls
Can't believe CNN isn't calling some of these clear red states. It's pretty unreal how bias they are, they literally are the fake news meme
SPY leaps at open
Not gonna lie I’m a little tired of it. Wanted new creativity from late night shows

Welp not going red tonight boys. Fuck can’t believe this is gonna be green all week.
BLM'ers don't move markets.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares about covid either.  What they do care about is low corporate taxes, deregulation, and free money.

Cool man, tweets since been deleted and so has the account that posted this. Story checks out.
😂😂
People thinking trump is actually going to win the popular vote with california not even reporting and several states going to be counting the mail in and absentee for days LMFAO

Shows they know nothing
China backed the wrong horse...Trump will unleash judgement....
Fuck. This feels like 2016

Bulls tonight: “What color Lambo should I get?”

100 Million early votes

Could be a curve ball
Noon question.. is it possible to do off market trades? How?
If you trades futures yes. We tanked like 5% and then we’re green by open. Maybe green by 10 am but it was definitely a head fake
Where are the blacks voting for T? Source?
Till we speak out on FB, Twitter, Reddit or Snapchat or in public. Then get attacked....

#WSB Election Poll

Alright boys, time to gauge the collective wisdom of WSB. As usual, this will be a great indicator of what to expect in the market for the coming months.

[Who did you vote for?](https://fast-poll.com/poll/3e2fc4bc)

Place your bets! Cheers boys 🍻

UPDATE: 260 votes are in, Biden still leading the WSB poll with 45% vs Trump at 38%. Votes still coming in. We need 500 WSB electoral votes to call the race. 500th vote get the award!🥇
The fact that market is mooning right now means MM confident of a uncontested victory

Why?

Biden hasn’t lost seems like they’re counting large cities last.
Where are y'all getting your info? Where do I go to see the truth? All TV is saying Biden win. Are you checking Vegas odds?
4 more years of hilarious meme material from mango
Fuuuuck my VXX calls are not looking good, honestly I deserve this for betting against America.  GG bulls

So whats in your shopping cart boys? Which tickers?
I don’t even want to open the app 😂 my account will probably be down like 80% 💀
I'd honestly be surprised if he lived another 4 years lol. Puts on Trump's arteries.
Trump winning will create a lot of volatility not to mention riots, also covid will run rampant, but stonks only go up so
Lol
Everything. Four year golden bull run incoming.
Trump might actually have a shot at winning the popular vote too

Cresco Labs and Green Thumb are poised for some solid growth in their upcoming earnings from IL
He needs to win Pennsylvania and Michigan. Dunno how that's looking.
Dems already talking about how we have to wait for all votes to count and it will take days to know the results

Sounds like loser talk to me
Could be. But Biden helped with NAFTA that helped China’s economy bigly
The stock market is literally all that matters. If S&P500 is positive on the year that determines your winner
Biden closing in now?
Hi, am I in 2016?
U think they're fucked?
I bought $40k worth of shares last week.
he has a chance, PA OH MN VA undecided plus tons of mail in votes
The dip was last week while waiting for the shipping results
Where
When was the last time you saw 3% futures that didn’t mean anything?
Nasdaq triggered green circuit breaker
He says in all caps in bold
Look up Biden's mistakes. There are many video compilations.

He even said "together we will defeat biden" WHO the FUCK makes that kind of a mistake?
When’s power hour boys?
I wish man but fuck I messed up on my puts lol
[Canadian WSB users rn](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/031/003/cover3.jpg)

Hell yea,  hire the hooker for an hour  and get 58 mins worth of photo edits out of it.

They are popular ideas. 

Dems should have went bolder with a more dynamic candidate and bigger ideas.

If he give me 2k every month he got my vote

Too big to ban
A few days ago I posted why you should buy AMD and people were shitposting talking about “you moron! I’m gonna buy it after the election-pullback!”

Good luck boys.
there is a slim, but nonzero chance this ends at a 269-269 tie, and I cant think of anything that would get vxx harder
I just want my calls to print sleepy joe or dump trump
Np man
Puts on Tech at open if this 350+ point rally holds.  Russell 2k is only up 0.84.   Lot of profit taking at open I think
Can't wait for the casual racism towards hispanics if Trump pulls this off with their help 😂
Futures halted limit up lmao
K then go bet on biden
As usual the media was wrong! So many Latinos and African Americans voted Trump! You’ll never hear about it in the media though.
Your one tech pickup at opening tomorrow : go....
Cenk having a meltdown
My icln calls are gonna drill tomorrow but probably worth it
Brehhhhh
You are the problem
What did you think circuit breaker’s were
You can 5x your money in the betting markets rn if you think Biden will win.
DUDE. THIS IS THE SUB FOR AUTISTS. GET IT RIGHT
And it was in that night that the longest and strongest bull run ever started
[deleted]
RIP my NIO call

I got SPY call to hedge at least
r/politics in giga shambles
No joke
House Democrats going to demand a 3T bill. Trump will agree. McConnell will have to bend the knee. In retaliation, House Republicans will go after big tech.
# SILENT MAJORITY YOU MOTHERFUCKERS
North carolina and Georgia are closer than they thought. If biden wins one that drops odds significantly 

Az is heavy biden too which is good

Wisconsin michigan PA will be huge
Normally I’d be considering $ROPE when I’m facing losing my entire account but honestly whatever. I’ve just gotten used to this hollow feeling. Hitting the bottle hard asf tomorrow and playing a round of golf
I had a call haha fuck me
Look at SEDG, tanked 100 dollars within a few weeks after a run up the past few months like no other. Beat earnings too, just didn’t meet quota and tanked.
It speaks to the incompetence of the DNC that they fumbled what should be the easiest election beat ever. There were a million avenues to win this and they blew it
Betting odds are the best indicator imo
If trump wins is it gonna kill BABA even more??
2020 has been such a shitty year.  And democrats couldn't convince people to fire the boss.  Lol
He was -750, no clue. Maybe people liked the +350 Biden had
Omg we get to see a JPOW + Pumperino dance for 4 more years??? Ahhhh
What calls at open will continue to moon? If trump wins .... I feel like any tech will be fat money rn
Trump will declare victory before midnight imo
Arizona? Also WI, MI and PA not done yet.
Is he though? looks like he's gonna lose Arizona.
And I think to myselfffff

What a wonderful worldddd
I sold half that already printed, and I picked companies that had relatively high short floats. We’ll see if they squeeze tomorrow
You're probably right but fuck them
Cnn onslaught of trump projections 5 back to back
Like they’d end if he lost?
[deleted]
Im going to run for president and call trump a commy
SEDG tanking today was a clear sign
EPD is my biggest position.  Plus a 10% yield.
LET'S START A HYPE TRAIN. REPEAT AFTER ME. TRUMP 2020! TRUMP 2020!
At this rate bears will be eating ice cubes from toilet water
Wow!
Might sound dumb but is Disney or draft kings “tech” bc I have puts on them. I also have an Apple call so maybe that could out way those
AND NO MORE STUPUD FUCKING LOCKDOWNS
Yeah, whoever owns the farm. But not the workers. Also Trump’s trade war with china fucked over a lot of farmers. But people would rather be angry against their own countryfolk than admit they were wrong about the president they supported.
Hahahahaha who?????
LOL this is HILARIOUS
whats tsla opening at
Dems in shambles?
[deleted]
Yes
Are they pumping because they think Trump is gonna win?
I need biden to win so my renewable energy calls hit!!!
Literally everyone I know is shorting and I’m sure most of this sub is. gonna cause the biggest short squeeze we’ve seen in years
Like ded ded?
I fucking lovveeeeee itttttt
Obviously
Not really. Just used the interactive map
Sounds like you're going to give him a little more then information
Make my account great again please 😭🤣👍🏻
Even Vegas gives trump the lead now
Anyone calling it for either candidate at this point is an idiot.
I voted for that cuck twice motherfricker
Don’t worry. Knowing Apple, shits gonna be red. And I’m holding Apple calls. lol
imagine still thinking the stock market represents the economy after the last 8 months...
It still goes up. Will take longer to get where it’s going but the end result stays the same
So does this mean stimulus check? Lol
The DNC is the failure. They choose Biden as their champion.
Didn’t know futures could get halted. Da fuq
Good plan but I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if solar isn’t down too much tomorrow. Solar isn’t up just because people were expecting a Biden victory
Donnie u r a genius
[deleted]
Because I can tell by the look on the talking heads faces at CNN that Trump is going to win.
Looks like 🥭 squeeze is coming on those numbers!
The race isn’t even close Biden is gettin smashed. I should’ve went all in on calls
I don’t like him but I’m ok with Mango winning. He can’t get re-elected so he won’t care about anything, and neither should we. Sounds great tbh.
I went for a run for an hour, left the TV on, and it was like they were at a funeral when I came back.
[deleted]
Wow my leaps. 360 and 300 on you know what.

Wow
I have 100 Aapl shares!!  And sold a 114 CC 😔 I’ll still make money..but prob could have made more
Wow, they halted Nasdaq futures?!?
I wasn’t around 4 years ago. Was it good?
-270/+200 now
Post your positions, bitch
Watching Biden is like watching Ali in the 30 for 30 Muhammad and Larry, someone should have stopped him from doing this, It just bums me out.
Stop with the arrr politics stuff. We are our own people.
They’re the same picture
Circuit breakers only work when stocks go down
PLUG puts
CA kills that. Doesn’t matter.
Nasdaq halted
I just got a notice that Nasdaq futures were briefly halted. Is it true?
Have you even *heard* the mistakes that biden has made? Sometimes he doesn't even know what position he's running for. He even said "together we will defeat biden". There is NO excuse for this shit.
We should all YOLO on Wendys calls. If we lose it all, Im sure our interviews would be good.
Tech to the moooon
You right
[deleted]
Bulls gonna have blue balls when we open bloody
Stick up for yourself
When. And yes
[deleted]
Welcome to the futures bro. It’s been crazy all night
Just like 4 years ago just reverse
4 more years. Low taxes. Business growth. Law and order. Prosperity. Power. Respect!
What have good relations with china got us, many of our tech companies are banned from china (fb, google), they steal ip, force us companies to train their replacement in their market.
[deleted]
Does biden have a real chance still or what?
Trump won
Guys my intersectional feminist moon dancing group said Biden was a shoe-in what the fuck?????
Good day to be a bull

So thankful I live on the second floor. Puts on windows.
Bookie odds don’t lie. Trump is heavy favorite, it’s over
Told you 🌈Bois 🍊 was winning and to buy spy and Kodak leaps
What are the chances can ny go red 😂
LOL no kidding!
Controversial take
Dude you underestimate how many retards there are in this world that are sheep and  dont even realize they are getting screwed over
TRUMP 2020. STONKS TO THE MOON!
I only had covered calls to protect myself. I also sold some stuff to have cash on hand. AMA
Trump you son of a bitch. You’ve done it
Thanks
[deleted]
I’m getting hard just thinking about it
Naw brah markets will favor value over growth if the Dems get in
Don't be surprised if AAPL moons to 200 and we get SPY 420 by end of year.
It absolutely is ! Meltdown incoming
Man I was truly convinced..
Why would TSLA go up?
I think so at least throughout Christmas
There’s a while until market open. Remember 4 years ago
Lmao already got -44 for commenting "4 more years baby". At least I got a couple rewards
I’m on wsb you think I have any money left to gamble
Not terrible, thanks for the info
California hasn’t reported
Wow trump is really gonna win
Holy shit. Will see see an upside circuit breaker tonight?
No but you are here soooo
F
Rip
Oil
Wait why is future mooning rn.
Give them a couple hours to price in.  They are still forming and waiting on the go ahead from Soros...
It’s over
Why what even happened? Last time I checked the map he was dominating and I was heading to sleep
do you think they'll print? I thought they were pricing a Biden win...
Everything apparently
Biden would have won if he didn't say he was going to tax 40% capital gains. LOL
You only used them to hedge your other calls right?
Cal Cunningham shouldn’t have fucked his buddies wife
Yeah he fucked up, he needed a pragmatist, with an entrepreneurial background, that could pull votes from the other side. Sad!
Getting there .....
[deleted]
you got it. I'm just lurking over there to witness the butthurt. Fuck I voted for Biden but I'm not gonna be a bitch about it. reassess and make your plays
They keep focusing on paths for Biden to win. Why don’t you talk about other races instead...
Mr Musk let me off the simulator
🌈🐶
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA
Now I wish I sold ATM spy put instead of OTM
No. This shits gonna be crazy contested
No circuit breakers on uppies
So do we go back on easy mode if Trump wins?
Yes
Calls on glaziers
Solar puts. All of them.
Have we ever heard Mrs. Mango IV speak?
Haha fuck my AAPL ans NVDA CCs too
Just on bovadas website
Biden is a fucking failure. U really couldn’t win just one state out of alllll the tossups? Lmao he deserves to lose
Fuck you and your cuck leader
I vividly remember futures being down 3-4% sometime this summer during shit covid news and then we opened flat and ended green
Idiots
This is what they said the first month spy went up from March lows, and look what happened
Trump is even winning the popular votes. Wild
Ya, definitely not the only reason. But a big one.
It’s going to print bud
Puts are bad for business
Lmfao
Holy shit NQ

Why did I go in on Vix calls 🤦‍♂️
Rachel Maddow?
That’s a good point .... anybody analyzed that ?   I heard there’s also trillions in other uninvested areas
i didn’t even say anything that outrageous lmao
With Chinese stocks going down, and YUAN losing value, how does this affect NIO?
LMAO I BET ITS hilarious over there rn
Calls all in tomorrow with the big Pumperino
Yo real talk tho, if Trump wins or looking like a winner by tomorrow, what to buy?
So TSLA 500 tomorrow right? Or is that too conservative?
lol when u think the market will go down. it wont! havent u gay bears realized this? the drop only happens when u dont expect it
Keep pushing yourself bro. Things will work out if you don’t give up.
No she's gonna spend it on pens to sign parole denials for people with drug possession charges
CHEEEEERS
Well, it’s all done. Only 11 hours till the markets open in USA. Won’t change at all, never does, never will again. Congratulations! The last moments the market will ever trade. 🤔
Biden would've won if he didn't say "trudiderndershendurfer pressure"
Omg that was their reaction to the news they didn’t react yet. We reacted before them Christ
It’s a gift
It went up to 338 in after hours then dropped $5 in the last 10 minutes
Imagine being passionate about biden
Lame duck 4 years super bullish for tech
God I hope not.  What a stupid, stupid move.
Ded
bruh you're going to get the sub banned for brigading stop that shit
Because it’s gonna dump at 4am
Good luck they've got leaders that don't need to poop, have the cure for AIDS and breed unicorns.
Damn I’d hate to be a window this week
Fuck, my bovada account is inactive. Havent touched it in a while, but wanted to hedge my options
Because the mail-in votes affect the electoral college votes just like in-person votes?
Is it safe to go balls deep in the market tomorrow with no day trades left ?
Because Americans think for themselves.
Damn bruh what you do lol
Cause we're just spectating instead of preparing for civil war.
If solar stocks tank I’m buying the shit out of them cause solar is viable even without subsidies/incentives and will still be the future.
Bro if you watch tv it will literally tell you trump already won
They're huffing that copium
And the dude on MSNBC is really good too, King is just an absolute beast
fuck that sub, they bash people over anything. bunch of broke hating ass losers
XiNN in denial
i am so anxiety
why didnt i buy calls
We’ll make it back in other tech. Let’s get it
how does this affect NIO??
my 1 gme call is gunna print!!
Why are the liberals such pussies over there
I got -125 in 3 mins🤡
Ellen DeGeneres
Mathamagician right here.
I already ordered my lambo
Is my spy put safe?
Freeze him with ice, or burn him with fire. Depends on his weakness.
Reminder: polls DONT MATTER XD
ME SO HORNY
Lol, that guy lied Biden +220 per bovada
Easy to say that now
We already limited up :)
Yooooo were mooning lmao glad i didn’t buy puts even as a hedge against my QQQ shares
CBS calling Zona for Biden
This pump is looking like early euphoria just like after stonk ER only to dump.

Someone told me as many as 5k and I couldn’t believe it, had to double check

I’m equally confused, I’m watching ABC and seems fairly even, if anything looking better for Biden
Deep red in HK
I am already having fun scrolling that since morning
Dude seriously? Think about Ivanka vs aoc 2024
Now THIS is mooning
i didn’t even shitpost there and got downvoted lmao
His was like 600 to 800 or something like that
How is that by the way? I was gonna watch but haven’t yet
The Young Turks guy is literally going to cry rn
The only one that’ll be red man smdh
I was severely wrong it seems
Move on to the next one
Futures liked that
Futures may be green, but my FitBit calls are guaranteed going nowhere until the EU cuts this shit out. Do I get a political ban for bitching about EU corruption? Their Agricultural subsidies are such a shit show and everybody skims off the top.
Suck his dick. Then you lose a bully and gain a friend.
Nasdaq is fuking bearasshoe.
Sorry bro but in berlin I have people screaming allahua akbar on hermannplatz as a french teacher got beheadet.
Nothing new here, carry on 😂
If trump keeps his lead in all of the toss up states, he wins
I literally don’t care who wins I just need my $TQQQ call to recover :(
How the fuck is Trump doing this good??? Even if he loses, couple of house seats in Florida flipped to GOP, Alabama back to GOP and GOP looks to be keeping the senate
Biden looking good in MI and WI

PA won't be called for days or weeks

looking good in AZ

JUST BECAUSE IT ISN'T A BLOWOUT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OVER
CNNs “It’s still early” denial is fucking hilarious
Says who? Could be 8 more.
for those not watching cnn, but want to know the sentiment? here u go...."it's still way too early"
You can only think this if you’re a fucking moron who’s never listened to Biden speak.  Thanks for telling me that’s who you are!
Probably knows you’re a bear. Gross
Yeah they don’t wanna watch mangos electoral vote go up!!
Jesus fuck what am I looking at
Cashing this Kanye West popular vote ticket. Thank you very much.
Totally agree, after watching MSNBC especially
I truly feel he lost any chance he had when he picked Kamala
Is donnie gonna win?
I wish I didn’t  seeing this. Now I will probably sell my shares before earnings, and regret. Happens every time I see something on WSB that makes sense.
Everybody needs to drop a note on r politics just for fun.  Who ever gets most downvotes wins.
Y’all stop brigading r/politics. We don’t need the admins to curb stomp this sub over y’alls retardation. And honestly who gives a fuck about that sub. I’m a liberal and I’m banned from there. Keep the shitposting in this thread, don’t be a sore winner.
Bite him
Nailed it
hope BABA prints tmrw 🥺
Is there a stream for this?
No I mainly only use to watch liberal news which made me realize how brainwashed you people are.  Like you guys pushed me away by being so hateful. And realizing Trump is less racist than Biden and actually wants to help America.  You are so deep in your bubble you just getting spoon fed though. Don't have time to save ya.
It’a actually pricing in a trump win
Lol what
Calls on TWTR tomorrow if Trump does well- he is single handedly holding that company alive
4,000? Perhaps even more than that.
Suprised they haven't called Florida yet
I’m a libtard up in Canada but even I would give her the Northern Moose Skadoodle
Heck yeah I cuss
If only we could flip r/politics 🤔

Oh my b. Thought you were referring to the usual culprits
I have one...pouring some out for you homie
I thought I heard talks of raising interest rates sometime down the road in like a year. Obviously Trump is against them so I was just putting pieces together. 

But yes I’m new to the game. America, fook yeah 🇺🇸
Fox called it tanking but didn’t look too bad. I was hoping for a boner because nothing brings me more happiness than China being crushed.
The last 30 min just sealed the deal for you I think...
Chinese yuan already dropping...  oddsmakers favor T
Never bet against America 🇺🇸
They’re only sold in China. Someone elaborate on what could happen to nio it trump decided to take a hard stance against them? Other than somehow getting them delisted from the stock xchange.
Market doesn't care who wins. Market wants certainty. If the election becomes contested then it's going to go red. When Trump started winning Florida, futures dumped because of the uncertainty that brought.
So was it a limit up or not? 😂 why the fuck would it be halted
holy shit r/politics is quite upset


-10 downvotes in like 5 seconds lmao
I’ll come back in a couple days!
Ass to mouth?
Nothing like celebrating unrealized gains!! LFG BOYS lmao

Do I get a refund for all the money I donated to get Kamala Harris elected Prezz?
Epic short squeeze
I would have loved to get in on Biden at +300
Thank God I went cash mode but Fuck it, I'm a bear no more, all calls on the next red day.... If we ever have one.

Change of tone in CNN reporting results in the last hour is absolutely cringey 😬
I bought couple calls back in early September $9c & $10c 11/20 🚀🚀🚀
Shhhhhh
Not so much.
How did I not realize the obvious play was all my money in TQQQ due to a Trump blowout.
$ROPE?
i would love that. I  put my last few bucks to Jan 2021 325c's after being down -90% all time.
AMD to $125 tomorrow! 🙏
Huh? It's up almost 4%!
CNN “we cannot call Florida, Ohio, NC till every vote is counted. “ Seriously there is not enough votes left for Biden to win...
Enjoy not having passed middle school and having no idea what communist means :)
I don’t talk to girls, I don’t get any work done, I don’t sleep ... stocks are ruining my life.. and I love it!

That's true. Death penalty for everything here!
Why is tech ripping?
I sold my hedges today🤡 I ride with you.
Serious question, you think Bernie was sidelined for being a Jew?

Are you delusional? Look at trumps odds of winning (currently 73%) and compare that to futures
Bruh this is fuckin nuts!!! Thank gosh I held all my AMD calls
im praying for you dude. you can be an asshole all you want I'm just suggesting you shouldnt be because life is better when you're not a total prick. Anyways, good luck tomorrow.
MAGA baby
Agreed. It will all come crashing down as the night goes along and it gets contested
True, thankfully I didn’t bet on a drop. Came very close to buy some puts on SPY

Trump no like China
If Biden wins, enjoy communist America retard :)
Tech up because bond yields down. Lower interest rates mean lower discount rate. Future earnings worth more. Investing shifts to future earnings, ie tech

Damn maybe having your party run by a senile neolib from San Francisco doesn’t help swing moderate voters 🤔
You’re definitely right that market is pricing in no stimulus - that’s backed up by the dollar strengthening massively over last couple of hours
No one from here would talk this way, go back
Sold my apple calls today 🤡🤡🤡
Because trump is corrupt and looking the other way at a thousand Americans dying every day

My bet is Californians moving to Arizona. 

That’s why Texas was closer also. California is experiencing a mass exodus right now. Texas and Arizona are two of the top states where they’re moving to.
SPY 360
house already called for dems hours ago  lol
0
Why do y'all think the markets are so binary ie. Biden win=crash Trump win=moon? Why do you think NASDAQ is detaching and mooning so hard? Probably because Biden win is bullish for China-US relations **especially** on tech front..

Any of y’all know how many people voted/are expected to vote this year?
NIO FDs
contested doesn't mean the economy will be any worse
Californians moving there in droves to get away from California's overly liberal policies only to bring their shit politics with them. Plus big tech has been setting up shop there for a while now.
Same with SPY. Can't do options though.
I completely agree
a guy just said that Bidens odds are now only -250, they back in this
So like your ass? She sucks what comes out of your ass?
Anyways dude, I am not gloating though, don’t take this wrong. I just want everyone to calm down and the polarization to decline tbh
Bought 10 AAPL 120c weekly. How much am I gonna make tmr?
Those banks prob shorted the ever living fuck of weed and solar shit and went hard on tech after they were done bullshitting

From this humble yank to you, I'm happy you're enjoying the show. If it looks wild to you, believe me, it really is. I hope things are going well on your end too.

what are we looking at for EOY? SPY 400?
TRUMP gonna FIRE fauci tommorrow
Fox News says Democrats picked up at least five more House seats, after picking up another 41 seats for a huge majority in 2018.  There’s no way we see that level of Democrats voting in this election without Biden winning.  That indicates an insanely huge majority of the popular vote, like 10%+. It’s not possible for Biden to lose with those levels of voting.

2018 looked bad initially for Democrats.  Their insanely huge victory wasn’t apparent until a couple of days after the election.  It looks like that will be happening again tonight.   

Get fucked all you fucking retards who voted for Trump to destroy our country for another four years.  I hope you enjoy losing!
solid dd

all in
NC going Red too. I am predicting Trump winning with 283 votes. 292 If he takes Iowa and Montana.
they already rich, who pays 5k per call anyway
Tomorrow may be a record-setting single day gain for the Nas tomorrow

hey, at least u weren't in puts
Was 4.5%
If Repubs get the house, instant Stim, limit up
Holy fuck nasdaq calm down
Laughed very hard 👏
It really comes down to watching which states went to trump. Once OH and NC went, it was kind of like probably trump but with pa also going, it's really looking bad for biden. Someone hopeful in rpol said if biden can get Arizona (might will) and either wisconsin or michigan then bidens back in it. But it doesn't look like wisconsin or michigan are going biden. And truthfully, arizona might flip in an hour.
Let me check which calls do I hold... Hmm... Oh it’s SLV. Guh
Valhalla or breadlines. We ride together.
If it really is +3% tomorrow, I wonder if it's time to get puts again. Maybe after one more rally after it

Don’t count your chickens before they hatch
I said I expected it to be narrow. I was expecting trump from the start and posted about it earlier. It was always down to Biden must get 33-36% up Miami Dade in Florida and then trump must win 3 Biden expected states in the rust belt area
My hairline just gapped up 4 inches. FUCK
Can confirm

Nope

How the fuck is tech up so much while the Dow lags??? I’m so confused
I mean we can acknowledge the past, but we don’t have to it hold us back forever. Also, maybe left wing people should actually try and talk to trump supporters... ya know have a convo. I have some good friends that are trump supporters, but I don’t hold that against them and we have nice chats about politics. Maybe demonizing all trump supporters as beyond awful people wasnt the best idea. Like people saying, “unadd me if you support trump.”

NASDAQ BIG DICK ENERGY
THE AMOUNT OF MOONESS JESUS MARY JOSEPH.
So uuuh this solar etfbubble running up to election.... Puts at open?
Pretty sure Bush or Obama did it too during the financial crisis
Might drop tomorrow with trump victory but in general solar and renewable is getting much better so if you’re holding long term you should be fine
What the fuck are you talking about. This is on WSJ. Typical Trump supporter who just assumes shit and spewing non sense
Don’t be. You made a prudent decision unlike most of the retards on this board
Brb, gonna go check how r/politics is doing.
Tryna figure out if Trump winning is good for my BABA calls. NASDAQ is overall up bigly but China stocks will probably drop. Might just end up flat 🙃
It's low interest rates no matter who wins when the FED says they're going to keep low interest rates they do it otherwise they would lose credibility.

I know you guys are new to this game but it's not that hard.

Same thing when people told you not to fight the Fed

Can’t fear monger liberals that are always afraid of everything
Yeah but during alert hours we were going up pricing in a biden win lol
Probably.
Your dog is cute but gay, js🌈
It’s cause I bought sqqq...very sorry 😳
Also China market CRASHING those tariffs are not going away anytime soon lmao
Up is up. Can't go broke taking profit!
Tech is up because the market is pricing in a Biden win, but a Republican senate. No stimulus will pass (benefiting tech when smaller businesses collapse), and no taxes/regulation.
But small business owners are greedy and selfish sweaty :) we need to shut down all businesses forever
What's going on with futures? NASDAQ up 3.3%??
always has been

Is trump going to lose Arizona?

Uh check the tickers for futures.

Es=f and Nq=f.

Nasdaq in particular is mooning atm, and if big tech rockets up it usually drags the entire market up with it as well.
Yes check the twitch streams people are already fighting and rioting
Damn AMZN call holders gonna be rich
When Trump wins the best part of my night will be going to r/politics and reading the election thread
Yea.
I was looking to get the boxy one just because it scatters police radar waves the same way as the F117.

Basically, it is invisible on the police radar.
i also went cash gang. Luckily i sold my puts right before market close. I think the risk/reward ratio not so good for fomoing on calls tomorrow.
r/politics is the hermit kingdom of Reddit
Tech is up so much because everyone knew the Dems wanted to break up big tech with antitrust charges. A blue wave would’ve been devastating for tech.
Never thought I would say this, but I'm happy as hell to lose money on my puts.
This shit is getting contested. I'm buying puts at open.
PELOSI DENIED US A SECOND 1,200 CHECK FOR THIS???
So what's going on is trump winning hence the market is up
It’s only back to where it was a few days ago
Username checks out
I think trump got this, he’s even more ahead than 2016. Can go to bed now and wake up to a massive green portfolio tomorrow

Futures gonna be up 10% when donald comes out in an hour and says I won

Holy fuck my spy call credits r fuk
As of today....is curaleaf in NJ only medicinal purchases?
Let me guess, you’re looking at his lead now vs 2016? Why not look at where trump started the night in NC and where he’s at now.... Look at what’s actually happening and quit watching CNN. They’re telling you what you want to hear so you HOPE he still will win.
You’re going to be surprised.  Even with a Trump win, they are going up.
Leaps but I’d be wary of Chinese companies

The same way they yolo all their money - with no dd but plenty of confidence.

Biden up: NASDAQ up 1%

Trump up: NASDAQ up 4%

Biden back up w mail ins: NASDAQ up 10%

Step 1 don't call everyone racist
All of the polls said most Biden voters weren't voting FOR Biden, they were voting AGAINST Trump.

So much time wasted picking a Democratic candidate that even the Democrats didn't like.
He’s really kind of raking in the Hispanic votes. It’s a real weird time.

Trump down to -250 pretty quickly from -700
How did he “beat” the media?
Oof
Thank God my puts are on green energy 🤞

Of course! That’s why stock futures are up.

I don't see why a poc would vote for Biden either at this point. They just py lip service to issues that are grossly exaggerated to try to get cheap political points.

Woohoo!!!

How can they get around “shy” trump voters? It’s an impossible task. No one likes admitting being a trump supporter
I mean, I wanted this outcome tbh, but just take care of yourself my dude.
It's amazing that people think the electoral college is bad for democracy because it never changes. Nothing is permanent.
no
Nailed it. When the left wants to raise the American flag and not burn it, I'll vote blue again.
Gotta keep people betting plus the west coast reports soon
I’m rich bitch!!
I'm a liberal at heart and want Sleepy Joe to win. But after looking at those NASDAQ futures, my calls aren't making me too sad
NC voted for a democrat governor but Trump for prez lol

imagine nasdaq going up 4 percent

i must be dreaming 

someone wake me up
Draft kings
Yes it would change, that’s why they’ve been predicting a potential “blue fade” since they expect a majority of mail in ballots will be for Biden. Mail in ballots take a lot longer to validate and count
So tech up because trump leading? What happens if Biden come back?
I’ll cum everywhere. Video to follow. Fuck off mods.
NASDAQ AND SPY FUTURES MOONING
Just came back to say fuck you and enjoy 4 more years of Trump45, you pinko fuck

Too drunk to freak out my dude.

No idea bro. Human decency seems to be in short supply these days. There are so many different reasons people may support a certain candidate and often times it’s not because they just think he’s a great guy lol. 

If Trump does win, I really believe it’s because the Democrats galvanized his supporters by belittling and trying to shame them for supporting him. Just my opinion.
“I will only raise taxes for people making over $400k”

A 26 year old McDonalds worker in Kentucky with no college degree:

Bovada was the main one
Yeah, it’s still unclear who the market wants to win.

It’s a close race, anything can happen.

90% counted in NC. Trump leads by less than 1 point
Boring, and then probably up even more
Yes

This. Who tf answers the phone when it's an unknown number
Qqq up because it’s all growth and low interest rates if mango man wins?
Wasn’t Trump supposed to reignite the coal industry? Let’s ask the Appalachian people how their coal jobs are looking since 2016
Mango speaks properly. This is true
I think Biden is gonna win but Trump is gonna have massively beaten his polling expectations again
Why the eff didn’t I hang onto my tech calls I messed up

It's the media telling them how to think and what to think. A lot of them don't follow politics very closely and just take their information from the fake media.
Wait till this guy figures out that the election isn’t over yet
No we don’t
Love this
I vote 69 likes for this comment^
I remember 6 hours ago being called a retard and a bunch of other pejoratives for saying this weeks numbers showed it was going to be close and trump had a chance. Hmm.. it is what it is, I just hope everyone is doing okay out there. I figure a lot of dudes are freaking out
Eh. Maybe they can walk to a South American country or Canada. Honestly, if people are so opposed to the majority feelings of the democracy, we should help them with incentives to get elsewhere. A one way ticket is probably more affordable than the alternatives.
when trump went past 100 it mooned

This is an ignorant take. Most farmers have million+ dollar operations.
It's called a joke.
This is a way closer race than most were expecting and I think it could create market volatility - but even though that's a super obvious take, don't take it from my sperg ass
Any of you betting on the election? If so what site you using?

Wtf..  tech is mooning
He really didn't fucking beat Covid, let's not get ahead of ourselves lmao
Holy fuck are my puts murdered
Also, all the rioting and looting. Yeah people might say abolish the police, but people know deep down that’s fucking insane. Honestly biden policy doesn’t seem that bad. It’s just all the fucking crazy ass left wing people that are so fucking PC and everything is racist or sexist.
Enter Mitch
Tech moons because Biden wins and more lockdowns idiots.

You people must actively try to not use your brains.
Dems keep the house. Stimmy talks going well?
Weird ass map so far
Only 20? I'm surprised its not 100
Imagine a reversal into a circuit breaker by PM 😂
Should've just chose Obama as his running mate.
Is NIO gonna crash tomorrow because of this ? :(
Just realized how big Alaska is holy shit it's bigger than Mexico
What states are those?
Yeah I don't know what you're thinking I'm looking at the votes right now and that map and Trump is looking real good right now. I am not going to get worked up over no election though it looks like my portfolio is going to love the next four years and I ain't going to complain.

Got to look at this dispassionately
Shit I should have bought more aapl calls today
People are going to say not yet. But I’m going to say yes. This wasn’t supposed to be close to begin with.
Soooo, are my tech calls gonna moon?
What if last week was a big bear trap
The closer to 50/50 they make it, the more the country can be divided. A landslide isn’t wanted.
Tech about to go crazy 🤑
Whats nio doing tomorrow
I hope someone harvests all of their bigoted comments in politics and shares them throughout the next few years
Shut the fuck up
Puts on NIO?
What media?  There are no journalists anymore.  Just propagandists shilling for Dems and Globalists.
Naaa I think we good but who the fuck knows
My SLV calls might be ok after all
Yeah, might be the next "dgaf about what's going in the rest of the market, I'm mooning" stock.
Fuck boomer stocks
Shit trump is going to lose Arizona 👀. Should i feel worried for trump
Good plan brother.
I'm mostly apolitical, but if it's Trump four more years I'm going to switch the station if he's on radio or TV. It rots my brain
Cause they’re partisan hacks. 

Most of America is going to finally realize this
Naw that wasn't me lol. Some other chode
Holly fuck Nasdaq up 4%
This is a big FU to masks and shut downs

Unless it’s on JKS or VXX
Lol Dems were saying “polls were accurate in 2016, just not really... but they’re right now!!!” 

Polls are worthless.
NOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hahaha
Trump beat COVID, the media, and now maybe Biden. Hell of a year.
DNC had huge influence over primaries. Several prominent candidates dropped out right before the first super Tuesday and all of them endorsed Biden. They did that because DNC pushed Biden
Better than puts, glad I didn’t get too many
Wow joe rogan is being a dick to his left wing guest lol

"well I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here"

the sad thing is looking at the extrensic value of these spy 11/4 calls I'm only going to be up about 20% at open if this holds.  IV is a real bitch on premium.
I’m so glad I paper handed those bitches this morning.  Let’s see how we feel in the morning though..
Only pussies hedge
Saw Trump and tuned-out.  Went over to r/kpopfap and returned to type this.
Majority of people have other sources of news besides reddit
And you think the way Trump talks are perfect coherent sentences? Lmao you're a fool as much as the libs are
Every call imaginable
Too many Californians moved there
FB calls as soon as the market opens?
I feel like an idiot for believing the pollsters, thinking that they must have learned their lesson from 2016, and tried to capture that shy Trumptard vote.

But the real retards are at the polling and the media industry, aren't they? Jesus Christ.
Only certain states matter, the ones which are likely to go either way and Trump is performing well everywhere he needed to pretty much.
TQQQ is an ATM
I think they actually have to have skills because those countries don't fuck around and just let anyone in.  So ironic.
Media outlets has biases...
Doesn’t look like it homeboy
How is the Texas race closer than PA or OH
can't wait for the meltdown compilation.
*but I am too*
Biden is weaker than hillary was, not a surprise he's losing to trump. If covid wasn't a factor this would have been a landslide
DONNIE WIN & BRING ME TENDIES
Looks like the R's will keep the senate
Huge pro trump
At exactly 9:45?
Grabbed SPY 350c and 320p at eod as lottos, one of them has to hit big hopefully.
Are we buying SPY puts or calls at open. I'll hang up and listen
thanks brother
Biden odds improving...
FFUCK THE MODS AND FUCK YOU
No , it can come crashing to 330 in 30 mins just like how it went from 334 to 343 in 30mins. Wait until open before you start dreaming about the tendies.
Thank you for your tears
ELON giving us over $500 tomorrow
The answer is still no.
They keep thinking they will flip moderate Republicans. They always play this game.
4 more years of market manipulation and the poors thinking it matters to them.

Lady G and his underage call boys lmao.
fwiw trump went from -800 to -300 in about 5 minutes on several betting sits
Yeah and that’s not how it works lol
Unless we have some mail in fuckery, Nate Silver is finished nomatter who wins
It does appear so. I thought the market was pricing in Biden’s win and that it would tank if Biden didn’t win.

But looking at futures, it appears that all the news about market pricing in Biden’s win was false.
Red=Green
Was asking for a ballpark, people imply that it’s expensive
No way the Trump supporters survive No Nut November after tonight
Covid doomers in shambles
Market thinks the election results are good for tech. 

Hopefully AMD actually follows the trend. 🥴

Communists. They probably mod r/politics
No blowjob if you eat meat and drive V12 engine car
I already got trump +160 the other day should I jump in Biden +270 too?
honestly do you liberal believe that Biden's gaffes were just coincidences? Then why the fuck do they appear in almost every sentence of his? He clearly has something wrong with him. I can't wrap my head around why anyone would vote for him. He can't even speak properly let alone run a fucking country. 

Trump did 7 rallies yesterday and Biden can't form a fucking sentence.
It's a hard knock life, always money to be made, you'll bounce back.
They probably should just rename it to r/democrats
It’s fucking hilarious - giving out trigger warnings telling their viewers to take a deep breathe
I’m so fucked. Trump win is gonna be doubly painful
what are the Trump bovada odds now?

Biden gonna win AZ

he's 11...so
538 gave Trump a 10% chance of winning. Those guys need to fired lol. At least I didn’t put any money behind it.
My job is safe but my puts are fucked. Guess I’ll just go to sleep
Did anyone load up on puts. That would be just sad
yea it should oh my god, do you know how it works?

Id probably win $ with Biden due to extra stimulus so 🤷
If you were thinking about buying puts it was lol
That 5 million dollar bet is fucking beautiful
I'm not even lying, I consider myself left on most things but I loathe the left. I'm tired of their anti-America rhetoric. I'm not ashamed of our history, I'm not ashamed of putting America first. So I vote RED
I was @ 100k in June from 9k back down to 50k. A trump victory will put me at 200k hopefully ;(

Should be at 1 million if I played tesla lol
Four more years :)
Where can I watch Nate Silver?
Lol

Nah man. It’s 💎👐
Tech boys better post gain porn tomorrow.
I want to catch this NIO train 🚂. If it dips a little tomorrow
Can't tell if your joking but trump is winning states he wasn't expected too like Florida. Media isn't reporting but look at stock futures and even betting odds
They want to keep their fracking jobs.
Majority of Americans are educated non gay bears
Time for WSB to raid r/politics?
CNN talking gaming Biden path to victory - they expected to be talking about trump not conceding

Holy moly QQQ futures at 3.5% right now
Lots of hype behind it and no bad news so far, so it might be a wild ride up until then. I remember when it was making its ride to $20 and people were skittish that would be the top
They’re still holding hedges until winner is announced.  When that happens -10 percent
Peri = close/about
This is actually hilarious. Calls on concealed carry permits.
I’m already just ready to hop on the unprecedented hype train that will be the Gabbard/West ticket in 4 years
Possibly. But wait til they see the salary cap impact that not playing has, they’ll be playing right quick after that.

Where you seeing odds?
great engineer, great leader...

apparently, a horrendous negotiator.
If there is 200,000 COVID cases per day and 2000 deaths I don't think the markets will be climbing. Trump disregards the science and even stated he is going to fire Fauci.
Yeah. I'm PoC, but I can see why virtually no white person (esp if you have a dick) would vote for Dems. It's fucking insane why they are trying to antagonize the most dominant group in America.
who didnt see this coming
They should have chosen Yang. Would love to see him going at mango
What do you do with a periscope?
Ever wonder what happens to Chad when he grows old? He becomes the +800 favourite in the presidential election.
So Sleepy's tariffs were a big neg to the market, is that why we are seeing an almost 5% rise in NASDAQ?

People voted for Biden in the primary.  DNC has some sway but in the end the people chose him to go up against Trump.  Both sides are retarded apparently.

Just very surprised with his track record so far, but based on my votes I guess nobody else on this sub agrees (or maybe assumes I'm one of those hyper left /politics people). Ah well.

Why are you all saying Trump won?
Went on a shit-posting rampage at r/politics and they put a 14 minute time out on my account

Yep, during the sell offs last week
Most reliable sources lol
Exactly right man. At least someone gets it. They need to get rid of the electoral college, it's not 1787 anymore. Even in Florida which Trump won tonight, the big cities were all blue.
Tech is rallying and carrying S&P with it. Ultra large tech companies generally do better with red White House
Literally what I’m thinking too
Lol
Same buddy

"did i remember to vote for myself"~biden
Yo tech futures. I love you dawg.
Vegas don't care if they report, Vegas is about making money and changing the line. They have odds maker determining what odds will make most money.

Take a deep breathe...but I Can’t breathe from laughter
When will Nio announce earnings?
Mango win
I don’t know dog how about you look at the fucking chart and report back?!?
Nasdaq futures up hugely
The Democrats hurt themselves with all the PC bullshit. People are sick of it and vote republican.

LMFAOOOO CNN “EVERYONE NEEDS TO STAY CALM AND WAIT JUST WAIT” they sweating major balls 😂😂
So far looking good. Really good

All the dems had to do was run a candidate that didnt have alzheimers. And they failed
Baba calls
[deleted]
Oh i don't like it either. Seems retarded but it is what it is. 
No worries though, it's a Trump victory
Sooo I'm balls deep in tech calls but I'm also a dem, so really I win either way, FeelsGoodMan
What makes you say that
How much?
Bears: how does Nasdaq ass taste??
Ah yes I see my puts are alive and well.

LOL
Lmfao CNN in shambles rn
You fool MM heard you being hopeful so we open flat tomorrow.
holy crap SHREK DILDO
These futures are crazy town
“ThIs Is LiKe a ReVeRsE CiRcUiT BrEaKeR”

It’s called a limit up you retards
Damn CNN people are shook, trying to keep viewer hope up for Biden, "Take a deep breath"
[deleted]
[deleted]
If you voted Biden you’re an idiot haha. Really though, you’re a fuckin idiot
Trump winning wasn’t priced in
It feels good to see March/April futes again
Hey retard - 1) it’s morning in China 2) CNBC is a business news channel 3) go watch CNN and jerk off.
Idk if it says something about you or the state of American discourse that you cannot tell I'm joking.
Dems: You don't make 400k/year, why would you care about taxes on the rich

WSB: One day I will. One day
Same. The portfolio is all that matters baby
me likey yo styleee
TURN THOSE MACHINES BACK ON
r/politics about to explode. Some people there are in serious risk of heart failure.
Shit. Mango is winning. At least my portfolio will be super green tomorrow.
Lol dang trump and senate won again. Oof they big mad
Chinese for Trump 🇺🇸
[deleted]
I would say Trump likes America, but not more so than himself, and there's a difference between being a patriot and being an effective national leader.

With Biden, it was looking like whatever he believes in, he's a non-entity. Maybe I swallowed the Trumptard fake news, but that's the perception anyways. And I can easily believe that Harris ain't a patriot.
For real

HAAHHAHAHAHAHHA BEARS DEAD
War Eagle

Fuck Auburn tho
[deleted]
Why lol
Definitely something fishy.
SPY futures is lagging the TRUMP contract. If you can trade rn, lot of plays are possible to make on the $DOW by following [this contract](https://ftx.com/trade/TRUMP)
Yeah damn. What caused that?
Europoor better not do europoor things
I choose poster
What the fuck..
It's leaps, they literally became a dollar each on monday

Against all odds Donnie won a second term. It all makes sense now that’s why all of the cities boarded up
What’s driving this tech surge??
Looking good Winthrop!
CNN: "don't worry guys its early things will change"

I wonder who they want to win?
I like how it says Vote below your post
The thing is when I say tank, we're up so much. My definition of tank is for us to come back to flat.
Rip solar.
Limit down by open!
Is the “peaceful protests” priced in?
[deleted]
No one does
Nah, Trump train has already been priced in.
Riots in the streets and gains in my portfolio
Not sure you realizet the damage Trump has done with the U.S. relations with their greatest allies. I mean Trump has publicly tweeted critism for G6 leaders while praising NK. It's messed up. Not to mention he is full of hate, incites division, and the U.S. economy will eventually have a severe recession.
👨🏿👨🏿👨🏿👱🏻‍♀️👨🏿👨🏿👨🏿
Dude, boomers are reps, they don’t want to give up their money
I check SPY first and I was like holy shit we're mooning. Then I checked the QQQ, almost fell off my chair

If NBA was still playing, they would be sitting out in protest
Oh thank fuck i got tqqq calls
I call my local psychic



Sometimes I go on investing.com though
Lol 3% so far 🤣
Yeah we mooning I’d imagine
My question is why we rallied when the race was so obvious earlier?
This is the second time tonight I"ve heard this dude on ABC say "the state of Atlanta". WTF man.
I have December spy 342 Calls
But I support biden

I feel fucking weird right now
Still have millions of Atlanta votes to count. Only 1% in some counties with half-million voters. Same in michigan's
Thanks man
lol
Holy shit, futes looking litty.
Tommy Tuberville goin to DC. War Eagle baby, I guess.
[deleted]
Yes
Holy shit my SPY put 0dte gamble is fucked. Gg bulls, another grand in the toilet
God bless you for saying this. I don’t like mango man, but why do we have to cancel every person that expresses their support for him? It’s so backwards.
Even with techs pumping like fuck, I bet you Apple my calls still not going to moon.
yo so can someone give me an update I just took a 4 hour exam and got fkd. whats going on
Bears punching the air
Non-partisan question: Who are the markets rallying for?? Too much info and too rapid to track the correlation between futures and polls. Or is it just the reduced volatility expected post-election?
OK retard
[deleted]
Ok buddy
VIX secretly pouring laxative in the party punch bowl
[deleted]
Loving that move for oil futures. Maybe these XOM bags will get just a tad lighter
its over. damn
The cuck doing the map on CNN can sucka nut
Have a single upvote in this trying time
Nasdaq futes trading halted momentarily after the massive rally
Thanks for the cash!
that'd would be literally buying the top, chill for a bit and get back in by selling puts, or roll out calls to next week for extra premium if you think they'll go up even more short term after +4% on the daq
If you’re self aware of how retarded you are, you’re less retarded than them

Canadians for US Markets🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
I voted for Obama twice and for Yang in the primaries. But I voted Mango lmao. I'm so fucking sick of the identity politics the dems shove up our buttholes.
Nas futures up 400 points on election night lmao. never go against the tech cult
[removed]
This came from google
[deleted]
I’m dumb money and I’m putting the half I kept in savings into the market no matter what happens by the end of the week
I want things to happen to nate silver that I cannot say here
Yeah PENN/BA and held
Donnie is favored to win. No tax increases, fed gonna print money for market makers.
nasdaq too low imo.
It's easy to say that now lol could have easily gone the other way
It’s going to follow all the other states. Starts blue then red.
[deleted]
Holy fuck Tech is fucking hulk dildoing
Is the nasdaq futures up 400 points or is investing.com jacked up??
mmm we dont want you Covid asses in canada mmkay? thanks
Futes options are cheap as fuck
They are not calling alot of states like FL or TX yet. Also some of the states they called at the start are alot tighter then they should be. Check out politicos map
Turns out people want law & order
Will I be buying the top tomorrow? Guys hold me
Rip my put
what now??
Holy shit wtf is going on???
RIP Elon
I have like 5k in BIGC calls I was gonna sell before earnings. Is that part of NASDAQ? lol
EOW
Lmao, that's what I'm thinking.

As the problems mount and maybe reversed calls and other bullshit, let alone the immediate declarations by both campaigns of wins and court cases, massive cliff down.

Also going to be hilarious when somehow I am completely wrong though!
Hollywood’s gonna be PIIIISSSSSED
Tax cuts will not be rolled back and trump is pro business/corporations..not that hard to figure out
but more laser focused on corporations and none to the poor
Just don’t bother to go there. They won’t give u 10 bagger options
[deleted]
Strange year due to mail in ballots
Hell nah
Uh futures are showing a fucking huge green dildo at the moment. Your AH price is already old and outdated
Anything not related to solar or weed.
Looks like buying the dip over and over again, pays off again.
My god.
Gonna see r/politics implode if trump wins
They're Trudeau voters now.
LETS GO BABYYYYYYYY
At the end of [this](https://youtu.be/EuZeff2y32M)
The amount of trolls in this thread....

Aaah i see. Thank you, now I understand
Honestly 50/50 chance lol
I'm buying some $ROPE
Why don't I ever fucking learn
Dude wtf.. it took me so long to figure out these were strikes for SPY and not TSLA.. da fuq is wrong with you? Holy shit..

!RemindMe 1 week
It's got to be an attempt at manipulation, right?

They did the same fuck up as 4 years ago
If you mean red states, then yes.
[deleted]
I came
Need it
I use TOS.. look at ticker /ES
chasdaq limit up :O
TAN about to get tanned to a crisp
My roommate plays futures (he has rich parents) and I just heard him yell FFFFFFUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCKKKKKK! I know they're going crazy and I know he lost 20k. Minimum.
My plastic is off now
Urban areas are the only ones left to be counted in mass (10-20% reported vs 90% reported for rural/suburban)
They can do one last gay bear orgy before they die.
Expiry?
Jumping in.
So my spy calls will print??
"paging baba. paging baba. stop going down. repeat, stop going down."

Tech shorts getting squeezed like Mandango vs a virgin midget
Why
Just took a look at /NQ and came in shorts.

that guy that buy $300m in spy calls is fucking JUICED right now
You pay gimps to edit your photos? Neat idea for people who can’t last the whole hour they paid for I guess.
It takes a couple days to let everything settle, usually later in November they will have the electoral college vote. It just gets done before early December
XD
Looked at r/politics for about 30 seconds. Wow. Thankful for the bois <3

APPLE 120 EOW
May not be by tomorrow
Ho Lee Shit nasdaq
Lmfao. You might as well buy spy puts if you want to waste your money
Please do.
They WANT TRUMP to win. Not that he’s actually winning.
Imagine being Lebron, Michael Jordan and Bloomberg - paying crime fees for millions of felons so they could vote for Trump.
Yeah pretty much vegas and Wall Street know
i have never seen this kind of nasdaq rally since March. holy fuck
We will see MASSIVE swings
[deleted]
so..how do explain this pump on stonks right now that trump is leading ?
Absolutely.
It is. We're not finding out who wins tonight and they will plummet
Nasdaq +1000 tomorrow.
what would you have bought if you weren’t a retard?
In the name of my SPY puts, I hope you are right.
Motion to make "being a Biden" a thing.
Holy shit
Hey retards, urban counties take longer to report. Give it 12 hours
It’s off now
[deleted]
There’s a reason trump wants to call this election tonight. He’s been saying it for months. It’s about to get crazy.
I use the investing.com app
10000%
Really!?
RIP
Lol no. Gonna get crushed by IV
Omg nasdaq futures halted for 2 minutes after 3.9% rally. LOL this is an inverse circuit breaker
#The opinion polls were propaganda all along.
Why
Nope 🤪
odds swung sharply backwards for what it's worth
Shares of spy calls 🤣🤣
can someone update me? 

if the market thinks Trump will win, futures go up? and right now, the market thinks Trump will win and futures are up? or do I have it backwards?
Do you really need to ask?
imagine if the dems actually trotted out a competent candidate
Why are futures up so much tho? Legit question
Been asking myself this all evening. At one point trump’s lead was huge so I thought they had percentages flipped
Donnie did it he got another 4 years holy shit prepare for riots in the streets
NC 👀
This is really important guys, if futures stay steady do you think we will see profit taking or people jumping in?
[deleted]
FUCK
“Paying the price” Trump is a patriot; no better option
So donny win confirmed?
Not necessarily Biden but the big boys dont like uncertainty.
How the fuck are pollsters so fuckin bad at their job
nate silver is fucking retarded. fucking biased statistics and bullshit math.random(0,1) rolling
Apparently my moves tomorrow are selling my fucking solar stocks.
Trump would destroy Bernie.
It’s the election coverage, not the day time business news coverage you dumb fuck
Of course not
Biden supporters in shambles
[deleted]
solar puts
Spy 500 eoy confirmed
It really is a landslide
Stuck to 420
Can we open red af please 🥺🥺
I'm only seeing 55% counted? Not sure if mail in ballots are counted after the in person for Virginia.
I am not seeing any blue wave yet
If you had 20 of them, you can get a Tesla... or just blow it on more calls
LOL who thought that was a good idea?.. like we don't trust these people.. lets just have a vote for fun i guess?
The shambles is strong over there lol
Philadelphia said they aren't announcing any more mail ballots until tomorrow.  PA not getting decided tonight
Where da fuck you all seeing futures?  I use ameritrade and I can’t see it.
PELOSI YOU OPTIMISTIC?
No sure what’s wrong with nasdaq futures , Wall Street bet on Biden seems he is losing and futures are green 🤷🏼‍♂️?
No WSB told me that.
Wtf. Bro trump won already. You not watching it
I have too many open positions I don't even know if I'm happy rn
AMA: Unloaded about $35,000 in tqqq, qld, fngu, and tecl.
He's leading in most of the contested states already, they just haven't been counted yet.  Its still close cuz CA has a huge electoral piece but its lookin blood red for the entire mid west.
HAHAHA all the brainwashed leftists are finally realizing that the market has been hoping for a trump victory!!!!!
I think we hit the ceiling.
fugue state
Sorry. Just been looking for confirmational bias that NIO is going to correct bigly 😂
❤️
Blue wave... I believe the market is cool with a blue wave or with trump winning and the senate staying red.  It’s looking like the latter and the market is cool with it.
Where do I see this live and why do Vegas people know what is gonna happen if we are still waiting for all key states to report?
Since it's qqq, I think traders think trump wins and more ridiculous tech regulation is off the table.

I literally had a cellphone company tell me to pay a bill because it'd be easier for me than disputing the charge every time they make a "mistake". 

Go after the internet and cellphone companies that fuck with the one thing EVERYONE uses. 

Big tech regulation is not the most pressing thing.

Data caps and other bullshit is... No one wants our search history going anywhere....
Bears are officially dead
It means you didn't embrace the culture here

Fucking glad I dumped SPY puts and UXVY this morning.
Biden gun flip Arizona
And a smaller stimmy
LMAO
Tbh they were dead already :(
What we buying tomorrow boys?
What happened to all those people who were moving to Canada in 2016?
CNN tell you that? 🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Thanks😊
Not sure what they are counting in GPU market share, but if they are including integrated graphics from CPUs / SoC, then that’s probably what is inflating AMD’s market share. Where is intel on that market share analysis? Would tell you a lot bc Intel makes no discrete GPUs. The problem with AMD is their actual discrete GPUs market share is much smaller than Nvidia, and the tech has historically lagged (both hardware and software / drivers). Therefore, when you think about applications of both - AMD’s ATI line of GPUs have been used in video game consoles, where manufacturers are price sensitive (trying to keep costs low). But in the higher end market and faster growing markets - data centers, AI, computer vision, big data analytics, etc. they are all running NVDA GPUs. Hence, NVDA has seen higher growth and in turn commands a premium multiple. 

AMD is trying to turn the ship around, but their problem is they have historically been 2nd in both CPUs and GPUs. A good alternative, but not the market leader in either
I have 20 lots of SPY 335 Call bought for $6.2 per, $12.4k total. Am I rich yet?
It's dead Jim
congratulations and sincerely, fuck you
Montreal is awesome. So is Vancouver
How’s TSLA gunna look tomorrow bois ?
Wow Trump might make me rich
For months bears were dreaming of a circuit breaker

Probably not this kind though 😂
Why aren't they calling Florida for Trump yet?
[deleted]
Nate silver needs to invest in $rope lot of seasoned investors here to help him
Not the House, I think Senate is still Republicans though.
I can only get so erect
4%
DUMB ASS DEMOCRAT BOOMER IDIOTS XD
LMAO
They didn’t add up all the electoral votes for the key states.. but it’s looking like he may get the W like 2016
Nasdaq bringing massive tech cocks to the bear gangbang tomorrow.
I don’t think it’s at all clear yet
No brakes
Why are they even doing coverage still if trump already won?

I read an article saying a lot of Californians were moving to AZ and turning it blue. Looks like it's happening.
LMAO
Trump win
We're not finding out who wins tonight boys bulls r fuk
Choo choo
He was -775
have u chdcked nasdaq futes lately?
Didn't get the reference lol
I thought I was the only one
The people have voted, fuck COVID.
I love watching r/politics and seeing them realize that there are a lot of people who have different political views than you see on Reddit
well he looks like he could still lose Arizona and there are many ballots that won't be counted till tomorrow. But, generally speaking, I agree with you. The model is predicting 65% chance Trump win so there is still some uncertainty but the models previously were giving him a 10% chance.
If NQ breaks this resistance it’s going to 12.3 omg that’d be so many tendies.
Futures hit 420 for a sec there. RIP Biden. Imagine losing to Trump.
[deleted]
What about TSLA calls?
I hope so, I need to get in when there's a dump
Trump said fuck big tech, big tech says plus 10%
Does TSLA sell shares for its company?
#Biden very confused right now
Yes my dick
How does Google have Biden winning Virginia already when Trump has an 8% lead???
ofc
fuck i had my finger on the trigger on that GEO call and couldnt do it
Wait tech futes really up 3% lmao. Wtf is going on
Bears in shambles. Never bet against Murica!
All these Reddit liberals in shambles LMAO
You get the odds you bet. I took trump +135
So when trump gets to -1000 I still get +135
Oil going to gap up so much, fuckkkk

you really are autistic if you think i’m a nazi from what i said
B/c this feels like 2016
Is the GOP gonna have the Senate and the House?
Bruh this election is too close for comfort
Robinhood
Does this bode well though? Feels like ‘Gyna tariffs’ are just around the corner cuz “we gotta make them pay!”
Always inverse the winners
Roll it out
LMAO Trump is -400 on betting markets? What the fuck happened in these last 3 hours?

I wasn't super shocked in 2016, but i will be if he somehow pulls 2020 out of his asscheeks.
It’s not
Yeah, $TSLA has been just awful under Trump, right?
Holy fuck
BEARS, THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO GET GAPED.
Has nasdaq futs every been halted before lol
No you're not.
U retard you should have bought them monday
What was the "trump upside surprise" at exactly 9:40 btw? Actual question. I haven't really been watching.
NASDAQ FUTURES HALTED FOR TWO MINUTES AFTER 3.9% RALLY

Ayyy if I could predict the future I would be much better off instead of cherrypicking comments about the chinese tesla on an internet board to validate it nearly being 100% of my portfolio

[deleted]
Ummmm what just happened to nq?
[deleted]
when you ostracize one group of people so much that they can no longer voice their opinion one way, polls will show the other way
My nio is big fuk
Does this mean that the recent "bear" market was really just a "Biden" market? Holy shit.
Those are polls.. Maybe look at actual numbers.. If looking at polls trafalgar polls are accurate. Only one to predict trump win in 2016
RIP bears tomorrow
Senate race 11-8 reps but the moon mission continues.
I think the markets had a trump win all along but then they got sketched out for 2 minutes
Barring some crazy shit, he’s about to take some big states like Texas and Florida
Essentially
That’s like trying to call the direction of the market tomorrow. There’s really no way for you to know that it wouldn’t have been better.
Nasdaq futures up 4% , what in the fuck ?!
Fuck man why didn’t I just get tech calls I got shitty PFE calls and JNW
*affect
Yeah wtf Nasdaq!! I thought I was sitting pretty with my short at 11400. Thank goodness it’s only one contract!

Holding hoping for a joe win
I gotta deal with the possibility of riots here man, I'm already prepared to replace glass on some of my commercial properties. So yeah unfortunate.

So what did we learn from 2016? NOTHING
Omfg tech futures jesus h

Wow, that joke went right over your head.
Bovada
Fuck your puts
538 said early voting tends to be democrat, take that for what its worth though.
you are fucked future just gapped the fuck up
Rip to my puts.   ffffffffffff
dear futures,

you still have 5% to go.

signed, 
dynamic circuit breakers don't exist on the upside, the whole thing's a scam
So guys, trumps gonna win so I’m gonna most likely shove a pineapple up my ass and dick hole and move to canadurh. What’s a good city in canadurh to move too that enjoys stonks and big dick energy? None? Ok fine I’m not moving. 

I’m drunk, sorry
Did you really just question me? You fucking nazi
Is it because he won key states already even though he's down in the electoral votes?
Look on Google election map or Bloomberg. It’ll show the map. It is 🥭 as far as I can tell.

It would appear this may be a deluge of misinformation.
What happened to this

It's 75% of my portfolio
Hopefully it becomes as overvalued as TSLA.
This is what I want to know
Wait I thought Wallstreet wanted Biden? Mooning on Trump? This shit wild.
Any run back towards 300 would make my tip tingle
Bovada has Biden +275 to win. Good hedge for my calls?
Short panic covering
I’m not disagreeing but idk anyone that’s actually concerned about it. Only concerned about when we can go back to normal. Not how it’s being handled, vaccine, etc. just when we can go back to doing everything normally.

Mango is winning practically every swing state that polls showed he was losing bigly. What a joke. Puts on pollisters.
BABA, APPS, NIO
won't know PA for days or weeks
Fr
Based
its okay, the smartest thing was to stay out. the next smartest was to hedge longs
MCSALLY DOWN
Gotta buy back some CC's at a loss tomorrow
So SPY calls because the market is pricing in an uncontested Trump win. Ok. Thanks
Fuck yea that’s how we roll haha buncha retirees up in here, we’ve got an early bedtime so we gotta count this shit quick
I’m pouring my entire net worth into calls as soon as the mart open tomorrow
Love it 😄
i'm moving back to canada anyway lol
Hate the Mango Man, but can't blame Americans for not voting for the Dems. 

Biden was looking like a crypt zombie and it was obvious that the Dems were trying to sneak in Harris as the backdoor president, cause GIRL POWER SLAYYY and BLM, or something. Even though Harris was a prosecutor.

Dems took this election for granted again, and are now paying the price. Even if they end up winning, they are going to have a big stinking turd on their face. This was supposed to be a landslide, and it would have been if they didn't fuck around.

Futures is about to drop hard, but I still see us opening at least +1% if Trump wins (assuming that’s why futures is pumping)
Then you clearly don't understand how penn works lol
Holy shit nasdaq
Lol wut
Best comment
Should have been buttigeg or yang
It’s up?
TX, NC, and GA are all but called by NYT if trump wins OH, PA, and either MI or WI that is ball game.  The rest are safe states like MT, ID, MO, IA  and he should pick those up with ease Arizona won't matter
Holy FUCK Nasdaq
tonight is erection night
Voted for Biden and loaded up on SPY puts. How do I always make the wrong decisions when the odds are 50/50
Nasdaq isn’t halted you mouth breathers
I do not feel good holding SQQQ
This is MAGA country
But it’s been going up during his presidency though?
Fellow wsb retards what will be of NIO? I think short term dump and fast rebound? I might be in shambles LOL
What is this a gun for ants??
Something does not feel right about what we are seeing right now. But I'm also shoving marbles up my ass as we speak
It’s to late
We joke about being retarded.  But r/politics is a retarded echo chamber of reeeeeeee

Place is fucking toxic.
Are you following the swing states? Like hes leading currently in most of the swing states, these states determine the winner, not your typical party stronghold states.
Is this going to effect Tesla?
Russell 2000 swings from -2% to up 1% in like 30 seconds, jesus christ
Flair checks out
Trump is keeping Michigan and possibly Wisconsin. Pennsylvania is leaning Trump. Ohio is leaning Trump. It’s not good for Biden at all
MAYBE UR VIX AND VXX CALLS AREN'T DEAD
RSI pushing too much, SPY cut to cycle industries, Trump will surprise the U.S, too much money in SPY at close betting against (unless it's a MASSIVE hedge).
Blacks for trump 🇺🇸
[deleted]
Fuck I had no calls just shares
Yes.
tbh, I don't see how you go through second trump term without market crash
Electors choose, not popular vote.
Only thing left is fairfax
Roku pls pop off tomorrow ty
Too early
Nah Biden lost
I mean, yeah. Futures get manipulated into oblivion and have been swinging wildly all night. It could mean literally anything.

Let's just stop this nonsense and actually see how things look tomorrow. Then we don't have to argue in theoreticals.
Omg dude rip
I do declare “check”. It has been done!
Damn son. The little engine that could did it twice - no one believed
Best site to bet on election?
Probably
NJ votes for legal weed!!
Pricing in Biden win=bullish for Sino-Merican relations?
Fuck election uncertainty, should’ve just bought the dip
we're going to be playing limit pong all night ;)
actual no joke might limit up tonight
Ban. No politics.
DNC is like those retard studio execs that think making remakes will be better than making original movies.
Shen Bapiro is that you?
I’d cream pie this hinge bitch so hard
Ive been encouraging them to move. Is there a program to make it easy for them to get to the peoples states of Europe? A fund w/a one way ticket and expedited citizenship?
🥱
Holding weeklies not sure how to feel
Does this mean we buy puts in all of trump's businesses?
[deleted]
So it turns out the riot about the presidency, but is  instead just thousands of angry bears
Everyone keeps saying Trump has already won, but everything I find when I google it (538, politico, etc) says Biden is up. What's the discrepancy?
Pretty funny how the DNC could've probably taken this if they'd learned their lesson with Hillary and just gone with Bernie... but they just had to go with the guy that has trouble putting together coherent sentences
[deleted]
Yup. These futures are retarded as fuck
NASDAQ about to hit limit up (+5%)
It’s now -600 peach
So tomorrow I’m immediately cashing out my SPY calls and going balls deep into AAPL
Holy Fuck

The DNC should be ashamed lmao
[deleted]
Lindsey Graham survives yet again.
Spy calls tomorrow?
We are going to ignore that he was born in South Africa. Papa Elon for El Presidente!
I hope it doesn't all happen pre market so I can get in with the FOMO
Yeah we’re fucked
so if I sold covered calls against AAPL and AMD to hedge, should I buy them back right at open or just chill for a bit?
You definitely can't check Penn yet. Philly missing most of its count
Got it.  Thought you meant after today... yea, that seems strange.
anyone who doesnt sell on a limit up is retarded
Are you on Mars?
Fuck fuck fuck
Margin call fucked

Ya that’s why I mainly got in. Probably won’t hold through ER
RIP

So long account. It was fun. After tomorrow my whole account will be 1000 shares of KMPH. F.

There’s no point to even buy calls tomorrow, all the action will happen before market open you all missed your chance
Puts on pollsters, what fucking retards
He is losing PA and MI. It’s ova
The idea that the dems would have had a better shot with Bernie is so LOL
I'm so torn. Not a fan of mango but he's good for my stonks.
If electoral college calls a state one way but the absentee ballots show the opposite over the next couple days, can the E.C. vote change or is that it?
/NQ 2m halt over. Shorts getting absolutely fucking smoked.
Well goodnight bear gang. We gave it all we had
I got downvoted into oblivion when I said peach is good for stonks. Not sure why, look at them futures 😎
Because fuck it. That’s why

Very big chances
Jesus Christ I can’t believe I don’t have calls lol
What? Biden’s winning
Reeee futures looking green
Wtf was the market pricing in?
Some of states already counted mail in before the in person. Like Arizona.
Remember, cut with the vein not across it. 

Just kidding bro- it’s only money. Your life is worth more. Don’t do anything crazy.

PA has like 30% in and hasn’t counted mail in ballots lol
Polls = TA crayons for politics
Don’t worry. Nio stock price target is [$550! 😉](https://youtu.be/NyNOiLDz3ak)
Vegas odds for Trump at -775 right now. Looks like he's about to lock in on re-election unfortunately.
NVDA 600c for 11/20
The night is young
I sold QQQ 11/6 285 calls for a $12 loss today... I am such a pussy.
how is VA called for biden if trump is up over 5 points and 96% of vote counted?

Holy fuck futures
NASDAQ 3.9% and halted?!?
Best place to get furniture ?
hoky shit nasdaq.
About 4.45 right now. I sold some to pay down my mortgage and buy a Ferrari I wanted since I was a kid. 1997 550 Maranello, in yellow. As well as a half handful of Teslas. Got an R80, model 3 LR and just took delivery of a new Y performance.
Should’ve been called 2 hours ago.
Also, calls on Amazon. Ban me if SPY closes above $336, or if Amazon closes below $3100.
Busch 2020
Please get the fuck out. For our sake and for yours.
Hi kids! Do you like Stocktwits? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me inverse SPY and kill my profits? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna short NIO and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try margin and get fucked up worse that my life is?
Surprised VIX is only down 2% though
Depends on your expiration. If it expires tomorrow, not gonna matter if this pump keeps up.
VIX IS UP GOING UP LOL. What the
Ban ❌
Bro m, just do Coke already
TSLA going up 12% tomorrow
Wait so who’s winning?
That feeling when you start dancing seeing nasdaq futures but then remember ur holding dkng calls
The real question is what does all this mean for GME 🤔
He’s taking the states he had to win. It’s still very close. 

And go to the special politics sub for tonight
Tech going to fucking limit up or what
Hopefully BABA calls don’t lose value
Ah 2%+ dildo on some big Trump upside surprises but it’s a coincidence, market wasn’t reacting to that. Myyyy bad.
I mean did you really want a 40% tax on your tendies?

Nasdaq about to hit a limit up soon at this rate
Only 9 states matter. Biden wins the early and late states - the middle states make the difference
[deleted]

this short squeeze is going to blow your fucking bollocks off

thanks
I only look at charts that go to 11am too
**Market +6.9% tomorrow**

*you heard it here first*
you can bet on whos gonna be running for 2024... 75x payout for elon LOL
If biden don't carry PA it's game over.
Is there a chance we don’t know whos President for a few days?
If bovada had biden at -300 a week ago do you keep those odds or are they updated
apparently Virginia started counting mail-in votes after the polls closed for some reason
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL
20% day tomorrow
I might buy a few shares of GME tomorrow, what do you guys think? 🤔
One mega pump before the free fall?
Yeah wish I didn’t bitch down going all in tech calls lmao
[deleted]
Not even gonna get a chance to buy my Leaps I wanted to get into FML
Sooooooo..... trump landslide
Really liking this PBS livestream. Alabama just elected a college football coach to the US senate lmao.
Is this trump being more lax on big tech regulation?
watching vids of Haka dances while looking at the pumping futures giving me chills rn. fuck yea
The fomo tomorrow will pump market to 3600.
These next two weeks will be the best rally the market has ever seen
They directly refer to “we” as if all the chat was liberal. 

Hang on a minute...
4% tech
So all we know is it isn't a biden blowout

All he needs it PA, WI, and MI

He's still looking good in AZ

Wow you're literally a fascist. Please go 👉🏽
Where were the guys an hour ago bragging about their puts?

[deleted]
Ya I don’t see it either,,, Biden still has the electoral votes, maybe not the popular vote. Very interesting
[deleted]
Ohio, check.
North Carolina, check.
Pennsylvania, check.
Florida, check.
Man they are dumb as fuxk
Feels surreal to see futures jump like +/- 10 in a second!
They've only counted about 20% of the absentee ballots on these swing states. They account for about 45% total vote. So it's possible you still have about 30% yet to be counted that will lean heavy dem. Too early to know
I was accidentally on r/politics thinking it was WSB and was like damn did the IQ here drop even more? Noticed I was on the wrong sub. Phew. 🥰
Some swing states are not called yet but show Trump in favor.
They were right it was gonna be a landslide victory.. just not for Biden
400
/ES went up 90 points in 30mins lol , crazy
Cocaine when
Apple 125 eod lmao
The mail in votes might be the dark horse in all of this
They are so biased to the Chinese owned democrat party. How do you figure?
Why is Shep Smith talking about Chinese currency instead of the election?
Could be worse, I could be a woman.

It’s okay bears, at least you’ll get a stimulus check. Should of straddled like the chad traders
We already found out that the market loves riots
APPLE APPLE
start?
Bears are about to get anally gaped.
wouldn't trump be winning early on and as the mail-in ballots get counted go towards biden? so in a way, it is too early to celebrate?
I mean, it’s not really a debate. Markets are swinging with Trump’s chances. Giving money to the person you think will win and who you want to win are 2 different things FYI
weed legal in jersey
^ahem...

Crystal meth
Can this start the GME squeeze to infinity please?
With SPY mooning my VXX calls aren’t looking so good.

I held calls in October.  

November ... WITNESS ME MOTHERFUCKER!!
I’m still salty about Bernie. The memes would have been glorious.
Lol love it
Every state sets their own laws for mail in ballots.  Maybe you already knew that, but I just learned it today.  Shit is gonna get messy.
any rational person knows that place is aids
I feel like a fuckin leprechaun
It’s gonna be so easy to make money again. Call premiums are gonna be too high though :(
US future is so fucked but we're all gonna be rich from these future pump

Trumo wins Flordia. Dow jumos from -30 to 300 in a few minutes
If Biden has more electoral votes atm why are futures sky rocketing based off the assumption trump is winning lol
Somehow ATVI will still find a way to be down tomorrow

Let’s freaking go Trump make futures super green print those calls
BEARS R FUKT.
I haven’t seen futures this green since March holy shit
Asking the real question
Nasdaq wants to return to 12,000 hard.
DOW barely green wtf lol
You bet against America, then you're asking for r fuk.
Chances? It's almost certainty now
pattern analyse , is like ooga booga wudu stuff
This. This is what will happen. We need to stop pretending this is a one day thing, shits gonna drag out
Do you really think it's that simple? Futures went from red to green for the moment and the election is uncalled, therefore Wall Street didn't back Biden? 

Good God I can't believe you tagged me for this. Don't do that again thanks.
Holy shit wow
Tech futures up 4% holy shit
Looks like it’s already removed. U banned?
squeeezee dem gay bears
Maybe you misunderstood and I wasn’t clear. I mean Biden winning right now don’t mean shit. Those 2 states can put trump ahead of Biden.
Yeap I shocked myself with the realization.
Dude are you a dumbass? Just asking if there will be a correction. Not asking for investing advice. Asking for a trading advice. And yeah, it’s possible that it ran up more than it should’ve from fomo and Biden’s support in EV industry.
It's so huge that the green dildos can't fit in the chart
[deleted]
Big tech = big DICK
feel like we heading to SPY 400 end of year.
He was just -775
Might be too late to buy calls tomorrow?
Lol it's gonna be insane. What if AAPL is up like 10%?
this is the wildest swing in futures Ive ever seen from minute to minute for hours.  I imagine all the hedge fund election prediction algos are working late night.
God no matter the result, looks like my portfolio will be happy it seems.
Holy shit that’s it for tonight
Pricing in a mango win
NQ limit up frozen

Holy shit tech is going to moon so hard tomorrow if this holds

Ah yes, that’s why futures are mooning alongside Trump’s win percentage.
🌈🐻lose again
I voted Kanye too. One, because this whole spectacle deserves it. Two, I want to see the post mortem blaming the Kanye vote for swinging the election.

I was never voting for either. My vote is for chaos. Fuck all y'all for telling me I have to pick a side.
Dunno, Trump has no incentive to pump the market after reelection unless he plans on living another 4 years and going 3 terms.

Biden I would imagine would increase taxes on investors encouraging them to realize gains this year.
Holy shit nasdaq futures up 4%
how much of a lead is 400k in florida with 91% reporting? They should call that shit right?
Futures ripping too early??
Wake up in 2021

Holy shit way too easy to troll those libtards on r/politics
Wasn’t futures just blood red an hour ago? 

Crazy how low volume pumps can swing the numbers
So mango wins are wypipo gonna start killing black people?
PA is a mirage. Mail ins mostly won't be counted till tomorrow

Holy fuck Nasdaq calm your tits
What to buy shares of at 4 am?
A great purge for the bears is coming
Why did I get out of tqqq fuk
What does this mean for life savings in GameStop gang?
That sub is 99% liberal. I expected a moderate page
My amzn weekly calls.. just wow
OXY calls looking good
NQ futes is like when you nut and she just won’t stop
Legal weed on arizona and new jersey!!
Its gonna get crazy tonight i feel bad fir the businesses
About that time when google trends "move to Canada" starts spiking.. wonder how many of these searches are from r/politics contributors 😂
Is the rally going to continue at open though? 🤔
Probably tried to push a narrative, very interesting tbh
Going full retard on TQQQ tmw morning
March this year I think $20. At the very bottom of the dip

edit: biggest loss is $26 in March again
🤦🏻
Lmao again, why are futures absolutely ripping? I'm too smooth brained to understand. It's fucking retarded.
Who built those cages Joe? Who built those cages?
Got earnings this week and singles day next week, think you’ll be ok
At this point fuck my political beliefs just whoever will make my calls rocket can win.
Stop. It’s over
" Any tips on strategy afterwards? "

Buy shares in a company you believe will be highly successful over the next 20 years.  Don't gamble away your winnings now that you actually have something to lose.
FUTES RIPPIN 🇺🇸
That’s one cupcake I’m not gonna eat.
This is crazy
What’s it doing?
We making tendies while libs and bears burn down own cities
but...but I voted
I want to be excited but futures being up this up tonight vs the morning makes me think it won’t last
Puts on pollsters
The meltdowns are probably the most hilarious parts.
My VIX calls are dead
Fuck CNN's wall, ABC has an entire floor
Trump -400 it’s over
unhealthily retarded
Market doesn't think so.
If baba ain’t green tm with the market sentiment looking like this I’ll be enjoying a nice happy meal from McDonald’s
Trump is going to win NC
Lol at thinking anyone in the media does their job well
Balls deep :).
COOOOOOOOOM

They’re pricing in a trunq win aren’t they
Ban

Wake up SPY 350 lol nice!
Just asking if there will be a correction since it’s been running up tremendously for the past few days cuz of October deliveries and Biden’s support of EV industry
[deleted]

You have to bet 600 dollars to win 100 on a Trump victory
So does market want a trump win or Biden win? Headlines for the last few days was that market was pricing in a blue wave and that’s why market was up.
I got him at +180 today
He’s now at -600, dummy, lolololol
BER FUCKED!!
WE ARE PRINTING TOMORROW. <3

Yea it does lol, electoral colleges makes the final decision, you know how many times a candidate has won popular vote and lost electoral college? Lol
Trump is leading in popularity but losing electorally for now
Fuckkk I should’ve bought my calls at close. Didn’t realize it’d be this one sided
[deleted]
I trust Fox more than NYT. NYT, CNN, and 538 are proving to be absolute clown shows full of morons.

Press x for doubt, it’s a hedge. Money gonna flow everywhere else
Oof trump -600

Doubt it. Pretty sure it’s going to be called tonight. It’s not looking like it’ll come down to PA or WI
Bets on Biden are free money rn!!!!

Post that in politics and report how quick you get bamned
Futures have been unreal
Futes are just fucking nuts, for every bar down there's an equal bar up and vice versa.

Who is winning?

Heavily favored
Why is it fucked
Jesus Christ. Us talking like retards is one thing, but now it’s becoming the norm for the people running this country.
Nothing stiffens me more than watching the boys at CNN begin to have a melt down as Trump narrows the gaps and reality sets in. Can’t wait to see Van Jones and Donny Lemon later 😍
Do you remember 

When the stonks were red in September 

They gone be green as fuckkkk in November

Lol tech futures are angry
NASDAQ HOLY FUCK
What are these futures lol
Narrow lead before the panhandle reported. Trump victory in Florida was clear a couple of hours ago
0x
Read my reply for the other commenter. Lmk if you think there will be a correction on NIO cuz of it.
aight
Trump now 77% chance of win https://twitter.com/OddsShark/status/1323821149504049153?s=20
Fox News said Dems won the house? Is that true? They also said Biden has  a 85% chance of winning North Carolina where NYT says Trump has a 94%  chance of winning NC
Biden should be ahead early in Ohio and Pennsylvania he's already behind in both.

If you're a Democrat you should be sweating cause this is major bad.
I mean I voted for Biden and Kamala

Just seems to be an issue with some voters
Idk but that would be fucking sweet

🤡🤡😭😭
More like next level debating. Lets be honest, political redditors are lame anyways.
wtf lmao
They never intended to learn from 2016, either. It's all about keeping the money rolling in. They fought way harder to defeat Bernie than Trump.
I always knew there were a ton of T_D refugees here lmao

NASDAQ BABY!!!!!!!!!
Tucker Carlson has been dropping real bombs tonight
thats exactly what futures did tonight
Will it be too late to get in calls tomorrow if Trump clearly wins?
GOP everything would be best, but Dem Senate & House + Trump might work bigly in the short-term from a stimulus perspective.

If Dems have both though, they will also 100% try to impeach again, and again, and again - until it passes.
[deleted]
Blm fucked the democrats. They pandered to them and lost the Hispanic vote. Holy racial politics Batman
Ohh shit, trump got PA

i thought mango itching to break up the tech giants, would crash nasdaq
You don’t know how this works do you
we can limit down circuit breaker overnight. dont get excited yet
They don't count early votes there until now
He obviously gonna win
Yeah but they just started counting mail in ballots which is like 60% of them
It's over, it's literally completely and utterly over. If you don't think so go put your money on Biden to win and you'll 4x it
Really???
Uh yeah lol
This is the way
Quick, what's a 2x play for the IRA

A 340 bet yields 100. -340 means heavily favored.
Bro, think there will be a correction on NIO from Trump’s predicted victory?
Trump crushing Florida - remember when Biden was in the lead?
Rip bro
But he wasn't born in Kenya...
DAMN, NC is super close with over 80% in
What a bunch of childish fuckin losers lol. Wowzaz
The peaceful protests hurt Biden...BIGLY
The blood will flow orange.
If Trump manages to pull off the same win as 2016,

A) He made a deal with the devil.

B) This is his tv show, we're just living in it.
My puts are mega dead I feel it. 

everything is rigged and I quit.
Why is it fked
It’s not even power hour yet.  Shit won’t get real until 1am
What are the odds ZM goes up 10% tomorrow? My calls have been bleeding for a week straight

People don't realize too stimulus won't even go through until Januaryish. That's at the earliest.
Dem party just didn't want to listen to Bernie and his calls for populism, and allowed Trump to subvert them. Very weird decision. They must be truly owned by the wealthy, and now the Repubs are the party of religious nationalists. This country is toast.
Biden still leading electoral college, just remember you can still win the popular vote , but still lose cause the opposing candidate had more votes in electoral college
Man, I am so happy I went all in.  Please baby keep these levels for tomorrow.  I have made huge gains so far and I need a solid run to peel off some trades and raise more cash!!!!!
positions or gtfo
Lumber and plywood is often traded in cost per thousand (board foot). 900m for a standard piece of plywood (4x8/32sqft) would be calculated like this : 32×.900=$28.80 per sheet.

Lumber is a bit difference.  You can calculate price per foot or board (2x4/12=0.6666x.900=.60 per ft 2x4x8/12=5.333x.900=$4.80 per 8' board).
so odds are trump is winning
Are my NIO calls fucked
Holy shit
Is trump win good for the market?
Funny shit

i appreciate honesty above almost anything. but, i also never listened to the man speak. but i see how media and people i know think hes racist and blame "coronavirus" on him. I am not a fan of learning from colbert and local news like everyone who hates trump is. i also am libertarian to a fault. so i dont have a horse in the race, but biden is not honest... not honest at all
Who the fuck said market priced biden win
I’ll say it again, what the fuck is happening lmao
Toronto seems pretty nice

Rent cheaper than nyc
Would Trump’s chance of winning drop NIO a little? Wasn’t it mooning from their increase in deliveries AND prediction of Biden’s win?
Dude, you guys are retarded hahaha.

Like every post in the /r/politics thread is you guys. Then you read each other's posts and come back here and say they are "having a meltdown."

This is amazing lmao
Biden wins, American saved, limit up.  Trump and his blah blah tax policy whatever... How about no one wants a fucking absolute lunatic.
Holy shit Donnie ahead in PA
Tqqq is gonna drop or shoot ? Futures are red, so it’s gonna drop right ??

PA red
The right are all brigading /r/politics to pretend to be democrats all upset that Trump is going to win, lol.

It's a weird-ass strategy though, I don't really get the point. Do they think that if they can convince /r/politics that Biden is going to lose, that will somehow affect the election? I don't get it.

Someone must have made a big trump bet.  Bovada is just trying to get more Biden plays to even out the action.
Yeah I think one of her main points was that she’s the only candidate actually opposed to the police state or something
Holy fuck looks like Trumps gonna win unless the Midwest comes in with a 4th quarter comeback
Which one nasdaq?
How long is this ANT IPO halted for?
WSB is the best place for commentary as the election unfolds because, like our behavior in the stock market, every irrelevant tiny movement in either direction becomes “to the moon” or “drill team 6 reporting” and it changes second to second. It’s thrilling
Yup
They're going to gaslight us if they lose and say "actually the polls were close!"
Definitely ban. Gonna be contested for sure at this point
Hickenlooper won a seat.
Whoo go Trump!
I got my degree in women’s studies from the electoral college.
Did CNN just do a stealth flip of VA to Trump?

Stop tossing money
Wall Street thinks the Dems will actually take action on breaking up big tech (as opposed to just tweeting about it). So the past few weeks, tech has been pricing in a Biden win based on the polls. Market now adjusting to a Trump win.
If mango wins no regulation and low rates help tech
So will baba pump still?
People embarrassed to say they support trump out loud but still vote for him
Is Trump win good for the stock market tomorrow?

The absolute worst-case scenario would be a Biden win by just a few electoral votes because Biden is bad for the market due to taxes and harsher Covid measures, and Trump would cause chaos contesting results across the country and there would be riots calling fraud left and right.
Of course....and what comes next?  ohh yeahhh puts baby! Buy long term and selll as soon as it comes up!

I think they base that on how each county voted in the past. They can deduce who will win the state as long as some counties have fully reported and they know how the fully reported counties lean.
NBC is avoiding it at all cost

He was way ahead in Ohio and is now only up by 13k votes
Zoom stock gonna moon lmao, rona will never end now
Go long shares honestly.. attempt to play around with calls on "Dips" best of luck
Heard some people saying trump made a faustian bargain for this election 🤔
Trump is losing

California
Wow 10 year treasury took a massive shit after hours, anyone care to guess what that means for equities??
Anyone have a good link for where I can see real-time Vegas election odds?
And people say the left are smug assholes.
Except for the fact naturopathic “doctors” can prescribe paralytics without any medical training.
To get people to get off line and stop voting?
that’s pretty bad odds lmao

Kanye Trump
Hahah what tf are you watching that Biden is winning? Is that what cnn is still telling your dumbass?
 Onlyfans will be a huge pay raise
This is looking like a drawn out contested election. 📉
Idk even know who I should be rooting for, for my calls. This contested bullshit will cuck me reeeee

Sky is also blue. Thanks, soldier
Lmaoooooo lets go!!!!!!!!!!!!
Week*
There's a seperate thread bud
I guess futures will be up later tonight if Trump wins.
why tech up bigly
Wow I guess Americans really don't like free healthcare
I have CNN on they haven’t mentioned at all that Trump completely closed the gap on Biden in Ohio. 

You guys watching any other channels and are they talking Ohio?

EDIT: Thanks for all the updates homies.
No they're not. Look at DOW, its tanking bad. They're pricing in no stimulus (which will hurt DOW companies the most)

True, they already knew
Kanye will win florida
Presidents too old imo
How do you figure?
This guy books
Trump's odds on Bovada literally improving every thirty seconds or so.  He's at -250 now.  Holy crap.
Lame
No no i mean the discrepancy rn
Why is Joe Rogan saying that Trump is losing while 0.6861 odds on trump?
Who the fuck knows, right?
Why has Virginia been called for Biden despite all counties reporting and 50% of the vote in, with Trump leading by 12%?
Well now I have a financial interest in this happening so this is difficult
Don't care much who gets to be the prez but I'd love to watch the 2020 election meltdown night video ngl. I liked the 2016 one
Anyone hiring?  Lota pollsters will be lookin for new jobs tomorrow morning.
Nate Silver def works for the bookies
Whyyy is tech pumping so hard?
I mean he’s gonna take Florida and Texas that’s like half the battle
It's starting to feel very similar. The excuses from CNN seem to be pouring in...
Not if he wins
Probably
same
Trump szn
He doesn't really do anything special. He just runs an algo based on polling data. So really he offers nothing more than the polls.

The fact that degenerate gamblers and bookies set better predictions is an embarrassment, tbh.
Good bot
Biden won New York right? Shouldn't that be worth more than Florida since it's the capital city?
They’ll be fine, shit up like 2000% OTY so far

Probably celebrating
Bought UVXY $20 calls at noon. I'm feeling good vibes right now.
AMD gpus are the “budget” gpus. AMD has share in the console market too. AMDs cpu line is top notch theyre an awesome company. Nvidia has been in GPUs since the beginning of GPUs I believe. AMD has always been the underdog but theyre making a run over the last couple product line releases. The Ryzen chips set it off.  Thats my surface level analysis. Ive been holding 100 shares for a long time now.
Yes
Trump leading in Flordia, Ohio, and Michigan.
If he gets them, he is reelected.
Wow, just by reading this thread and not watching the news I can't figure out who's leading. My bet on a close, contested election is so far so good.
Lmfao ABC.... uhh uhh uhhh looks like trump might take Ohio we’ll be back after this..... “OKAY GUYS WHAT DO WE DO NOW... STALL!! STALL!!! This is hilarious
lmao Trump wins Alabama. Big surprise
By god, that's Trump's music!!!!!

Weird futures
America got cucked by the leftist media

Lmao this was a landslide
Tell me how I held overnight for 40% sold in the morning today. Waited all day for a good price for re-entry, nothing happened. Said fuck it with a market order at like 359.
in the current climate you will be ostracized if you admit you voted for Trump. A friends brother literally cut off contact with him for over a month now because he's voting for Trump. And people are shocked that polls are off?
Which mushrooms will help me *taste* SPY calls?
It’s not about the language, but the conversation surrounding AI and other technological improvements. That conversation was laughable.

Agreed that Jack Ma is a very smart person, when it relates to business. Of course, AliBaba isn’t a “new” idea. It’s just Amazon copy pasted in China.
NASDAQ 🤝
DXY moving like it’s TSLA. Scary.
Sweet home Alabama for papa Trump
The fuck!!! My portfolio is based on trump win

nah if people were this dumb theyll fall for it a third time
*We could win in Texas!*

If Ohio and Michigan end red, it’s gg
Or if trump does because people like the kind from r/politics will explode and storm the streets and probably make corona worse in the process
Post that in the election thread my guy

Never been there! I just know basketball is huge there.
Research Triangle for the win

Mad respect to the futures traders, Id be paper handing all over the fucking place today.

Thank god I got out
Yeah Tech's done so well it made the fucking dow into a Tech index... really quite insane
Wait for a spy pullback and daytrade tf out of it
How are polls always so fucking wrong lmao I shoulda just bet on trump. Better return than weeklies
They were predicting like a 89% Biden win. Somebody fire this guy
betting lines have completely flipped.

About 3 hours ago $300 bet for joe biden to win was bet 300 to win 150. I just got another $300 bet in for biden and now odds have flipped and i bet 300 to win 550.

Have the odds really flipped that much? Is anyone realistically predicting trump takes it?
Why are futes blood green tonight you ask?

Biden believes in science 🧪 🧬 🧫 

Technology 📱 💻 ⌚️ depends on science

Nasdaq IS technology 👺🗿

Biden is winning BIGLY 🤓🥳🤠

Therefore ➡️➡️➡️ Nasdaq FUTES blood green 📈🕺🏿📈
Turns out that screaming "Racist!" non-stop doesn't work
So trump winning is bad for Dow?

Holy shit there are going to be some very angry people tomorrow

Palantir wins no matter what
r/politics salty. Hard to believe those are real people.
I guess some large city is yet to report
So glad I bought last minute SPY puts eod
yeah but people on Twitter say Trump is racist so therefore how could old conservative minorities vote for him?
I love it here... we need to full send it tards, let’s get back to printing or burning tendies after the election like the degenerates we are

And yes you’re the only person I have to talk to about this
Lmao sports books are pulling nearly all bets off the board 😂😂😂 they know they’re fucked. Their books are probably loaded with trump picks
It's literally just trying to bring votes in for Biden to balance the payout book

Gee whiz bro
He keeps extending his lead as more votes being reported
They pop that limitless drug
bullish futures traders realizing the independent variable is DXY not price of SPX

Game over man!
I like Bloomberg.
The deregulation of banks, the corporate tax breaks, the low capital gains tax are all big factors. Also there has never been a president more proud of numbers in the stock matket more than the actual economy. He will not let it dump, period
can someone tell me how joe is winning virgina?
This thread is proving exactly why I bought vix calls.
But that’s no fun. I’m looking for a shitty 0.10 contract I can get 13 of.
Oregon is voting on decriminalization of shrooms as well. That state sounds like a lovely place to live
They are severely risk off
I’m not watching CNN. Even if mango loses Ohio he’s short
he would be escorted out, what do you think will happen
Imagine the cocaine right now with the big boy future traders. It's probably fuckn glorious
these pollsters should all be fired at this point, they are never right

Why? Most of these red leaning states have very low percentage of votes counted
Used to but dam jameo is harsh. Surprised you’ve never had Jameson and ginger
They’re gonna start but they probably will take a day or two to count

Big changes
NC is lit, one of the best upcoming places in america imo
godamn trump is winning in ohio ! if trump gets ohio, he's the president , at least statistically all candidates who won it, were presidents
It’s almost like people don’t realize Hispanic and Latinos are a historically conservative culture
Yes, to both
Merry Trumpmas!!!
Trump creeping up from behind - stormy
American people cucked polls again

She's annoying. I like the rest of the panel though. Charles Payne is the man

Because if it's a close election, it opens the door for a drawn out contested election. This creates uncertainty and volatility. If it's a landslide win then it's much harder to legally fight and question the results.

If you ever trust the polls that gave him 10% again I don’t even know what to say. I don’t know if it’s malicious, but whatever method they use to sample is clearly biased
Sure I agree but I think if it were to come down to violent protestors or a seemingly oppressive government police the libertarians will side with the rioters.

So the swing states one (Florida, Georgia, etc) haven't been counted? We're fucked then, he really might win again
Are we crashing because Biden is winning or because it’s close
Were futures this divergent 4 years ago?
No
So hopeful for my SPXS calls but not gonna toot my horn until I see some blood red past 8:30 am.

Small caps going to limit down. No blue wave. 
Big stimulus never happening.
Trump supports TSLA cuz it's American company
Electoral votes aka the only thing that matters : Biden 131 , trump 92 
Looks like electoral college leaning toward biden for now
This sub is the only nonbiased one left.

Pro tip (jama traders only):

Sell everything in a panic, go to bed early, and get a full 8 hours' sleep
The QQQ SPY movement is weird. So trump victory is good for tech and bad for the rest? I guess if it’s bet on pandemic mismanagement

When I google it, it says Biden is leading overall in electoral votes, not sure if google is including the swing states already or not yet?
There are a lot of turtles in this country.

True. Don’t really care. Don’t want him to win so I never hear about how great/criminal/predator/ saviour he is.

Lol, Nasdaq futures ballin while Dow futures in red.
Lmao USD wffffd
On election day? This is an obvious sign.
vixx👀👀
why are trumps odds surging wheN I see biden ahead on votes
CNN crew looking nervous...
Even Cali is not in. I didn’t expect he will lead in popular vote at any point of time.
Bovada
If biden wins the shit show EVs will be huge.
F in the chat for my SLV calls
No because doesn’t have one. He has a leather bound dictionary-sized book of blank pages that he will have a White House aid drop in your lap after he leaves the room like a pouting child.
It’s easy for retards to forget not everyone speaks English. How fluent are you in your second language. If Jack Ma was brain dead he wouldn’t be in his position right now.
Lol not sure why I laughed at this
NBC very downtrodden and talking about rural voters not showing up for Democrats like they did for Obama, or something like that.
Despite the username I'm not a big fan of either candidate but I sure as hell hate those fucks on that sub. Most miserable sexless cucks on the planet.

There was no healthcare plan 60mins to confirm.
sooo am I ditching TSLA for coal? lol
Holy shit as Trumps odds of winning increase the market is going red which makes no sense but ok
Just realized that I haven’t taken a shit today yet.  Farts are smelling ripe AF
But you can still touch her wiener right?
[deleted]
Also Biden is technically winning right now in Electoral votes, Trump was up earlier. Nasdaq was fucking ripping earlier.
Well I bought an 11/6 $9 put today because of unusual whales, so hopefully we can both be right
4 for 4 is too good of a deal to sustain profits. Puts

Im not very good at politics but i have spce and gme calls. Who do i root for
Oddsmakers want equal betting on both sides
In Less than 3 minutes right? 😂
Damn PredictIt completely crashed, probably too many people trying to bet Trump
Ohio just flipped, the people are speaking
maybe my VIX calls will print tomorrow after all...
But it goes against the maxim of the non-aggression principle. Your right to swing your first ends at my face. BLM has been incredibly violent, they've killed people, caused billions of dollars in property damage, and their goals are in no way aligned with Libertarian ideals. I just don't see how *any* Libertarian could support them.

But, meh, it is what it is
Where are you getting this?

Worked for trudeau. Now were stuck with him.
If Trump wins and Dems grab the Senate, just wait for him to do the tiniest thing and impeach him again, just because.

Impeach for what
Trump leading Texas, noice

Just a reminder that CA, WA, OR, and HI will he last to call and almost always blue. They make a combined 78 electorals.

Lmaoo futures falling hard
Looks like this might payoff better than a Tesla FD
If you're confident enough people look at it as a free $50. I think the odds will swing back and forth throughout the night though. Lot of ups and downs. People live bet these things to find better value though

He likes the katma bro. Just like you. Now take this upvote, slut.
Some states (maybe all) have a tracking system so you know if your ballot has been processed at the post office and if it's been delivered to the counting location
Just make sure you stay far out with 45 days out.  It’s going to be a roller coaster
Two things.

First, if you are gonna get fucked, you already are -- can't really do anything about it now looking at futures like a retard.

Secondly, you had just as much chance getting ruined holding the call. IV crush is gonna eat them both for breakfast in pre-market cause you went long instead of selling a credit spread.

Now go back to the deck on your personal Titanic watching ES futures.
It's a false perception. The market has outperformed under Democrat presidents. Plus you can't discount the loss of US leadership around the world under Trump. This is a bigger issue to prevent China from taking the leading role.
Kanye really got people out here voting for him 😂😂💀😂💀
election talks going well!

Neither party nor President has the answer to our problems. The rest of the world has simply caught up to our manufacturing ability for the most part, though we still make the best of the best. No amount of fomenting war between USA and China can bring back their jobs. Tough situation.

This is projections from the AP. They have statistical models they adjust as  precincts come in and eventually it surpasses their confidence threshold to call it.

It also happens as the night develops they might reverse that, or say it's too close to call again

Bernie got fucked in the primaries, I went anarchist capitalist and bought calls
Lol good plan bro I might drink something too
If your vote can swing so easily, I worry for you. Same if you voted Biden of course.
Renewables in shambles?

Updated odds (per Bovada):

Donald Trump -220
Joe Biden +155
In Florida you get an email when your vote is received and counted. Took less than 48 hours for everyone I know. You can track and trace your ballot if for some reason you didn't receive your email confirmation.
Third party and write ins are the other 2%
$100 to win $200 if Biden wins
A lot of states have ballot tracking in place so you can see if your ballot was received and validated
Are u listening Nance
Same
I am just happy more people voted this election. I get so pissed off by people not voting when so many other countries literally have no say.
we all belong here
- is the favorite. Bet a football game ffs

Source?
Futures Dow down 0.75% and tech up 1% seems like it's a Trump win. COVID goes out of control, tech/stay at home stocks moon.
It means he's favored. Do you not know how odds work?
[deleted]
That means you gotta bet more money than you stand to win

\-110: Bet $110 to win $100

\+110: Bet $100 to win $110
If sleepy sleeperson wins, jpowell gonna lift that 0 finger
Laughing up here in Canada 😂
yeah...
You’re not wrong
Wouldn’t be surprised if this election ends up being a bigger upset than 2016
What does that even mean. 2 to 1 in favor to win?
lmfao
Tip: By calls in european exchanges. There's gonna be hella uncertainty tonight and you might get some things on sale
That is a matter of perspective my friend
spy and dow shitting the bed while the chad nasdaq is pole vaulting 1% jesus
Tfw the nytimes pussies out on the needle so everyone has to resort to bovada to get real probabilities
I think you can check online if your vote has been counted or something like that. There's ways to check up on it
If Trump wins, what stocks for when 30,000,000 people get the rug pulled out from under them for health care?
They just updated to reflect what you showed
Fuck it always wins everything 🤦
I just don't think I can handle 4 more years of Trump every single day in the news or god forbid if he dies a Pence presidency.
Cracked up, thanks for that
I was thinking about how wsb clowns other subreddits and I wonder if there are subreddits out there that clown wsb.

I approve this message
You guys are underestimating how much Trump has held back past 12 months on Twitter when he realized he was tanking the markets.   Once he wins,  he is going all out folks.   He could care less what markets do.  They gonna go heavy against China
Lol people are so stupid
DXY JUST BROKE 94 SHITTTT
Well, did you at least vote for him?

Only the ones that's been called.
They are generally pretty good. They'll fuck with pre election polls but it looks really bad to mis-call the actual vote. Also New England went solid blue one minute after polls closed lmao

What does that mean

Why are you so fucking lame?
Small rural counties report very fast, larger metro areas take longer. Anticipating Biden votes in slower areas
Man...I love you homos...best source for news always lol
gotcha
Link? To the thread?
Okay honest question. I’m not saying that I think mail
in ballots are fraudulent or anything. But how can they say that it’s completely safe. I’ve had my shit lost in USPS before, it just happens sometimes. How is this any different?
And the dems will protect it if that happens. Vice versa
If sleepy wins y’all think mango will still tell us his healthcare plan?

Edit: yes this was (obviously) a joke that he and the GOP don’t have one.
If you thought Texas would end blue you belong here
Normally I wouldn't give less of a shit who wins but today I bought ICLN calls so if its not Biden winning then im fucked
Go find an election where the Republicans won VA.
Steve Brannon. War Room.

30 year bond yield dropping by 11 Bezos points. I have no idea what Jeff has to do with this but whatever. Analysts speculating Biden and Dem wins senate => more stimmy.
I'd really like tech to go red for selfish buying at open reasons
I think it’s you you have to pay 220 to win 100.

He was initially -160 or around there, so odds are moving in his favor
Bet 275 to win 100 for Trump vs bet 100 to win 225 for joe. 1:3 to win vs 2.5:1
You need a better shirt
Actually insane

Friend is a  Democrat council member for the local town in PA where he lives.  He worked the polls today.  He said there was a very intense turnout of Trump supporters for his supposedly Democrat township.  Granted, most Dems probably mailed in their ballots already, but he said do NOT count your chickens before your eggs have hatched.  The intensity of turnout of Trump supporters in PA caught the Dems off guard, according to him at least.
Looks like Biden lost this

You know shit isn't good for him when r/ politics isn't excited anymore
I don't get the political betting. Says if you wager 500 on a trump win you'd still lose money if he wins??
-200 means bet 200 to win 100
The way I have been picking stocks in the past few months 100% makes this true
I’m doing bear and bull spreads regardless

you gain almst nothing if you're right

I’m *not* libertarian, but wasn’t her support of BLM basically chalked up to she supports citizens rights to protest and she’s against a police state? Standard libertarian stuff I think

So from reading these comments the market will go up either way right?
-275 now
How is VA already saying Dems won but is 57% Trump, anyone got an answer for this
Those are fire af

Pre-ban his unborn children, and their unborn children. Posthumously ban his dead relatives.
I’m very tempted to pull the trigger. Been agonizing all night
We literally couldn't care less who wins as long as our contracts print

The medical system is handling literally millions a day already. They empty out of the room level collection daily. The hospital my sister works for (Seattle) literally has a dumpster full every week. The avg in patient goes through 4-5 a day.

If dems control house + senate, couldn’t they impeach right away lol?

Why tf you all want Trump to win? Please tell me it’s only because you have money on it.

Check out the sports book pal, not CNN
Yea bro, big time. Puts on my genitals
-220 on Bovada
My man!
Interesting, just curious why? better for me to understand from a local than read from articles.
Just saw on CNN total difference is like 20k votes. That’s nothing for a state that size. Trump will still win it but crazy how tight it is.
Lmao market will tank if Biden wins dude
I believe it will
Someone give me a link to these Trump Biden betting odds... I got some money to win.
Latinx is such a white liberal thing that they think is flattering to minorities, lol. Why would they think that Latino and Latina are offensive to a people who come from Spanish-speaking countries, the language that has feminine and masculine forms for every noun?

Fox News says that Democrats are expanding their House majority further even further than 2018, which was a huge blue wave.  It’s hard to deny that when Fox is saying it, given how bad it would be for them.  That should be reflected in the presidential votes as well, which we’re not seeing right now.  Some counties won’t even start counting mail-in ballots until tomorrow, and mail-in ballots lean Democrat.  It’ll be interesting to see what happens over the next day or two.
Interesting what do they say ab ohio
South Dakota my man!
TRUMP LANDSLIDE
OMFG MCCONELL WON!? are you fucking serious.....people actually vote for that guy????
I wanna know too

All the college educated people reported
He doesn't have the balls Hitler did.  That's why he sniffs Putin's
What???? Okay then
It won’t. It’ll be like Beto a few years ago. It’ll be close but Trump wins by a small amount. However it helps since Biden seems to be winning more of the suburban vote in Texas which is good correlation for other states.
He’s closing the gap but it’s still big
Maybe the most ignorant comment in here, you know even Fox already reported democrats retained the house?
Here’s that volatility we’ve been waiting for since Sunday futures. Strap in cocks.
Trump cucks in massive denial. So cringe and sad
Lol neither of them are competitors
The Texas "swing state" thing is mind boggling to me. Drive all around this state and you can tell the MAGA is skrong here. I don't think the analysts have a good grasp on that
I have been thinking about replacing my plastic food containers with glass ones since March. They say wait 30 days before making a large purchase so I went ahead and been waiting for more than 180 days.

It's not an all-or-nothing situation. TX won't become CA overnight. First step is to get the Medicaid expansion passed; OK just passed it. TX marijuana laws are idiotic, those need to change. Get the QAnon, religious nut politicians out of there. Baby steps.

Im still hoping for that Spy bloodbath.....

Yeah man, I creeped all the way back from a 20K loss to just around 5K loss. After last week, I’m back down to 16K. It goes up slow but it falls pretty fast.

Wichita. I traveled around the country for 2 years and this is one of the cheapest, nicest cities I've found. Winters aren't terrible. Quiet and beautiful. Not the best economy, is one reason. Too dependent on aircraft manufacturing, but they're trying to to diversify. There's good coffee, booze, food in all the midsized cities now ala Tulsa, OKC, etc. I think my friends back in LA are totally insane, they could all retire and buy a nice house for 150k and work part-time at Walmart or something, but they're obsessed with 2 hour commutes, 1800 for a one bedroom and having sports teams, I guess. It's hard for some people to let go of that city pretentiousness. Now I just go visit NYC or some other cool city every few months when I want some excitement and come back to my 400/mo studio where I can watch eric andre and not kill myself to make rent.

If Biden wins Ohio I'll make an Onlyfans
What channel
Trump gonna lose those Midwestern states he won in 2016. That’ll be the difference.
LOL a perfectly reasonable question that they haven't thought of. The ban was because of their defense reaction of denying that dilemma.

But by all means, let's ping u/Opinion_Is_Unpopular to adjudicate.
they're up, bonds have been completely obliterated, money is going into risk assets and yields are rising. We are moving up until de Fed steps in with more QE to lower yields, and then we will have another spike in bonds and probably a correction in equities.

You realize whatever the election results are, trump is still president until january. Retard
Older generation dying off, lots of people from other states moving there, rapidly growing Hispanic vote.
I’ve done business in Dallas Houston and Austin for 10 years. It’s been becoming more liberal every year...
There's really no way to know. Just try not to think about it until morning when the picture will be clearer.
It was obviously a joke, I just meant to point out the reason no one is talking about it is because it’s less than 500mm market cap
Not really
Your username says Patel so I figured you were Indian. Modi’s India’s PM and he likes Trump.
No way Trump concedes easily. Hell tank the whole market if he has to.
why’s the nasdaq up rn?

Texas is red
If they call PA for Trump I could sleep just fine. Truth is I have fireworks ready to fire off so imma be up anyways

I wish she’d get more recognition if for no other reason than at least to spread the concept of libertarianism (I am not one btw) or at the very least popularize the fact that there are more than two options
Looking at how the vote counting is going so far, looks like cities are getting their votes in first. Which is why Biden seems to lead early in states. Texas is a prime example. Most of geographic Texas isn’t even counted yet.
Isn't it close
Peri- is a prefix meaning near/around. So there’s pre, peri, and post.
Now a complete toss-up in the betting markets.

Not surprising with all the voter suppression and gerrymandering

I sold everything yesterday morning
Except you have no idea what I’m even saying...I’m not saying he’s losing Texas. It’s just it’s so close it’s really bad for him in other states that have a correlation.

Wait till midday but if you get a concession speech tonight you cant miss regardless of winner. I am short because I expect shenanigans but once decided all in. Oh and positions for Biden win are GRWG and PLUG. For Trump win close eyes and throw dart you will hit a winner.

Trump pump > all the shit you wrote that I won’t read
Texas: we red
We've been red for years and we're known as the gun toting state for a reason.  The thing is we're so big we have some of the largest cities in the u.s.  Out of the top 14 cities we've got 5 of them.  That's big.  Multiple of those cities have more population than other states.  It would create the largest divide in the U.S. among rural and suburban people.  You'd see a lot of voter manipulation in the coming years to turn it back to red.
It matters for irony

Twice a fucking week
With the electoral college those in underrepresented (and just as valuable) areas can have a larger say in the election and for good reason. Both groups of people are valuable and valid, but when those falling to the groupthink of big cities are the only ones who decide the election, then we have an enormous amount people who do not have their needs fulfilled.

It’s pretty much over for Trump. Biden is way too close in Texas, which translates to other states. He’s winning counties in Texas Democrats never win. It doesn’t even matter Biden loses Texas. Trump is losing all his suburban white mom votes so he’s pretty much losing the Rust Belt.

> The chart isn't just an arbitrary line. AMD+Xilinx is not the same as AMD stocks plus Xilinx stocks.


i never said it was.

i said xlnx is no growth.  because they are.  hence, their lack of growth in their financials and chart being dead until the rumour broke.

you omit the issues with the overpayment and worse, the 1.72 tether (and subsequent dilution).

there's a reason why amd's sp went from 88 down to 74, amidst the best ER they've ever had (with beats on eps, rev, and guidance) and 2 major catalysts (zen3 and big navi).  without the xlnx deal, it would have rocketed to 100 and probably beyond.
Probably works on a subconscious level

I am a city slicker and although not liberal, probably far from being right-wing nutty enough for the poor rurals, but I get why they vote Republican. At least these folks had the pride of being the backbone of America. And then Dems roll in, and try to tell them that they are the problem with America. Wtf.

Dems still don't get that you are trying to win hearts and minds in elections, not make converts out of people by proselytizing. Ironic, coming from a now barely-Christian party.

what do you plan to do when market opens if biden wins? and if trump wins?
cause these retards refuse to answer. it is not priced in, hell not even intel losses are priced in yet. looking at least 2 yrs before its priced in. expecting market cap to double is probably an underestimation.
That looked weird to me as well. I guess it is based on which districts have reported and the performance relative to last time?

Yes and no. They wont liquidate all at once. However, dividend investing aint what it used to be. Gradually cashing out is pretty much the only way to consistently draw at the 3-5% they're set up for. Boomers need millennial money to keep pumping the deflating bubble. Wealth transfer is going to be bullux. Millennials, aka the damned generation, will finally see a real burst sometime around 2040-2050.  Then gens Alpha and Beta will fight a civil meme war over oil reserves directed by Z and funded by millenials who went cash gang just in time. Ironically TSLA will be the primary military vehicle supplier, this time with actual bullet proof windows.

Nvidia is a small asian man in a leather jacket that picked up a cheap hooker in Vegas (ARM) because they think that's what you're supposed to do when you're rich and powerful. They don't tell their wife because they don't want to admit they spent 4 hours watching softcore porn on cable before she took his money and left.
Unlikely, but remember that lots of people from California have been moving to Texas. If it stays blue (big if), then this over.

Congrats to anyone who bet on arkansas to trump on your free 2% return
Yeah sure but for 50% to be unhappy that means an entire party (and some winners) would need to be sad about the result. I doubt any winners would be sad, and I’d be surprised if every voter in the losing party cared enough to be sad. All I’m saying is “half” of America being unhappy would be surprising. I’m being a smartass lol

WHERE ARE THE BEARS
Mango lost to his home state lol
Look up how electoral college is calculated. It's all about population and where the lines are drawn.
It appeals to simpletons, that's why it works.  If everybody thought for themselves and, you know, did some research or read a fucking book once in a while, then the rallies would be pointless.
Of course they’re gonna count those ballots and make Biden win. People already have begun being investigated for mail-in ballot fraud dude. If they are a majority Biden that only shows that the mail in fraud was left-leaning. That means we literally have election tampering going on and it’s not from russia, but done here. It’s tampering with the vote count to make Biden win. That’s worse than russia paying for pro-trump facebook ads. Stimmy saved America so drumpf has my vote. Biden is a dimwit with every plan imo. But it’s super concerning to see that the media is overwhelmingly steering people to Biden, try to meddle with votes to have him in, social media is stifling republican posts and pushing left bs, and even the FBI is ignoring the shit on hunter biden just to get Biden in office. I get there’s corruption everywhere but to say they have the laptop and the files are on there, but the fbi says if any media posts any info with the files, they will be in trouble? U kidding? It was supposed to be a secret within the FBI till Rudy had whistleblowers tell him and he blasted it. FBI admits it’s real shit but sweeps it under the rug? Government is a corrupt joke, teenagers want socialism, and capitalist socialism is facism. They screech against facism. How many brain washed retards are there?

People who care at all about how people pronounce target to the degree that they could characterize them as assholes, are assholes.
If Trump turns California red you know it's over right?
Dude is the largest state. If any of the candidates win there, the other is fucked. Period.
I mean this as gently as possible, but get some help. If you need to move to the city, maybe that's for the best. It's just politics, at the end of the day. There's one thing certain, no matter who wins, and that's very little will change.

If your guy wins, great. If he loses, look forward to spending the next few years whinging and moaning as hysterically as possible (That's my plan, lol. It's great fun).

Oh fs

With Ohio blue its already not looking good for mango
That is true. I did not think about that.  But the markets should like 4 years of nothing getting done other than stimulus.
The race was tighter than a virgin's twat. Basically it call came down to Florida, which didn't get called till very early the next morning. Al Gore conceded. Then it turned out there were issues with voting (hanging chads, confusing ballots), questions over absentee ballots. Al Gore un-conceded. Legal battles back and forth all leading up to just a day or two before the electors meet. A 5-4 Supreme Court case (Bush v Gore) in favor of Bush. Al Gore concedes again.

We literally had no idea who the President would be until December.
That type of democratic strategy has already failed once.  Still feel they did enough to win this time though.
Duh. But that won’t happen
Yeah that would be a complete disaster for Republicans.
God you’re dumb
I expect ACB stock at 7 at open
Surprising that Biden is up so much in Ohio, North Carolina and Penn? Trump looking like a big win in Florida though.
Look, I know it hurts for you rural folks or conservatives, but EVs, clean energy, TSLA, NIO, TAN are all going to make us some serious tendies. You can’t fight the future. The green new deal will pull us out of this recession and will make us a manufacturing powerhouse.

Crowds at rallies are generally more indicative of the existing support and enthusiasm for a candidate rather than as an opportunity to persuade voters. For ex. in 2016 it was a big deal that Donny T was having huge turnout at his rallies because it showed that voters were way more enthusiastic about him than the media would've had you believe. It has less of an impact now though, because we have 4 years of information about how supportive his base is.
Joe winning? 

Russians:  deploy the hacking system
Nah u won’t, nqs just being a little gay for now 😅
How republicans convinced poor and rural people to vote for them time after time is beyond me.

If Texas turns blue you know it’s over right?
You can bet on that?
Oh wow so brave, +1 virtue points to you good sir!!!
How do have they only 92 votes so far? It says 44 Biden 48 Trump this will take years and what happens if it takes longer than 4 years to count, do they vote again

TOUCH THE LEGS ON MY HAIR GOLD IT TURNS
It was always going to be red. Dems were delusional
You don't think that people are investing in this election?  This is the biggest turn out in decades.  I have to believe that this election is very emotional for people.
Let's face it, Biden would be coasting right now if he picked someone else, someone who wasn't so obviously a diversity pick and extremely reminiscent of the "Squad".

Dems ran a white woman in 2016 as president and lost, and figured that they might try to sneak in a half black woman as president in 2020 via the back door. Wtf were they thinking?

This coming from a guy who, overall, wants Biden to trounce the Orange Retard.
Watching spy futures now like “I’m going to be so fucking rich” then 4 seconds later “oh fuck I am going to be so fucking poor” to 5 minutes later “I am going to be so fucking something.”
Go all in don’t look back seriously
Trump has the popular vote now but losing in electoral votes

Biden looks good once polls start reporting but then trump comes in hot as more votes come in. The narrative is that it's because of early voters ( most likely biden) being reported first. 

This is backed up by the odds swinging. Biden a gone from -200 to -145 in the last hour or so.  


Idk who's winning but it's going to be close in the swing states
Trump looking better

It's about perception.  "Oh wow, lots of people went to that xyz rally, must be a good candidate"

And the people who go to the rallies go home and talk about it to their friends and family.

Basically, if you're a moron that's impressed by shiny things, then you might be swayed to vote based on a rally attendence.

Orange Juice futures is up .50%. It’s at $115.65 right now. Hell yeah.

I think a split President - Senate is really good for tech (since they can’t pass any legislation). But it’s terrible for IWM, since they also will have a tough time passing the stimulus. 

Or maybe it’s just your round of the mill rotation back into tech and the election is just noise...like tech had been underperforming since last Wednesday and we’ve seen this story a lot.
This is the way

Woah. Has something like that ever happened before?

Yes! That green candle is saying something.
There is a 100% chance he will lose the popular vote. This was never even really a question. He lost by 3 million votes last time, lol. Republicans haven't won the popular votes in decades, except for the one Bush election after 9/11

The question is whether he can find a way to pull of an electoral win again.
I dont agree, why would oil be up for the last day if the market thought Biden would win?
Brrrrrrrr... sorry what?
Love you mango man.. but you gots to go
so you just bought them EOD ?
if I'm not mistaken, the popular vote never has and never will mean shit right? I mean democrats have won the last 5 out of 6 popular votes right? 

Electoral votes are where it counts. There's a reason why the right hired academics to create gerrymandering and map out counties and complicate the fuck out of things.

Tech futures literally mooning GAT DIGGIDY
I can’t believe Ohio is basically a toss up right now.
Of course, I can get a hell of a good look at a POOR by sticking my head up a bull's ass, but I'd rather take the GAY BEARs word for it
And u wonder why itll be close against a dude thats in the shadow of his former running mate and now his own VP?
Always bet on friendship
There will be unrest in one form or another no matter what. Not necessarily tomorrow, but when someone claims they have won.
Goddamn, futures are crazy right now. Huge green dildos in NQ.

Everyone calling it for both sides here. As someone who isn't checking the results due to stress this is so damn confusing.
How? You guys have no idea what you’re talking about
Dems still winning atm
If texas flips and they don't end electoral college there will not be a republican president for the next 40 years

Seriously what happens if they both get 269?
How many votes does Kanye have nationwide right now?

It really doesn't matter who wins the election because the bulls will win.

Trump win: more deregulation, tax cuts and stimulus.

Biden win: improved trade relations, maybe stimulus.
Cant remember where I heard that but look it up
Probably not, especially because I dont think Trump will win

MS Marijuana vote will be interesting for weed stocks
Dam something happened. Futures just flipped to super green. Tech up at least 1.2%.
Hold up... we are wall street
Yup
Oh please.
I mean shouldn't we maximize the opinions of the most people though? As it stands, California and New York votes don't matter. There will always be votes that don't matter. The idea is just to maximize how many people have an impact. If everyone has an equal vote, then it would maximize happiness. I'm also in support of a ranking system.

Meh, at least you have your education, career, and retirement funds to fall back on.
Don’t be a smart ass, you know all of our burgers come that way.
Not that it doesn't have it's flaws but if we went straight majority vote then Dallas county alone could outvote the entirety of the 4 least populous states. At that point where's the point in voting if you don't live in California, Texas, or New York? There isn't one. With a majority vote, you straight up eliminate the voices of practically the entire midwest/west
It's awful, but it depends if you are poor or not poor. The bay area is great.

I know it's early, but Trump leading the popular vote is concerning. If Trump remains a contender, it's going to be a long night...and worse, more instability going forward. Biden will almost certainly win if all the mail in votes are counted, but if Trump ends up ahead (or at least very close) tonight, then expect a big fucking fight.

Not many of y'all remember 2000. It was fucked.

usually just browse /pol/ for memes
So far, reporters are acting like all the key states might be able to be decided tonight.  But my state (Michigan) claimed they may not know until Friday (if it’s close).  I have to imagine that ONE of the 4 ish key states will be too close and not able to call until after 9:30am tomorrow (probably Thursday or Wednesday night depending on the spread).  &&& as long as this feels to you, it feels even longer to those trying to limit risk and decide policies for their entire corporations.  If it drags out, it’s crashing bad.  If it’s not a landslide victory (in the electoral college, not popular vote) then either candidate can fight the result or both claim victory or blah blah blah.  People hate that. 


So decent odds for you.  I would say 35%.  Praying may help lol - but don’t pray for money & don’t pray to money lol
Was just singing Old MacDonald’s Farm to my toddler and when we got to sheep and it was BABA here and BABA there, I started crying about my calls.
For people who werent watching the markets 4 years ago, when Trump got elected futures sold off hard and then we had a massive bull market. Sure it was a surprise win but my point is that tonight’s futures are even more meaningless than a typical nights futures. We will just see more volatility for a bit and then stonks go up.
They would and they know it

Trump leading popular vote as expected
Check in at 11pm this is mostly meaningless bullshit until at least then
Very true. Here in Texas though early voting will make a huge, huge difference. I still expect my state to go red, but with so many mail-in’s the result could be unforeseen
There’s also a really high correlation between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Even if Trump wins Ohio, if it’s by a smaller margin than expected, that’s good for Biden’s PA chances (since Biden has a larger urban vote there vs Ohio).
Election would be so much more fun if the markets were open

I'll take back everything I said about Texas if they enf blue lmao
Hell yeah he’s awesome. Not his time yet but maybe one day
They need to stop doing that on Google. If you don't have any numbers... Don't put 0% and call it... What the fuck...

I've got like 4 pics of that I've been sending to people on what's app
Well damn. Tech gonna carry the market. Either way green tomorrow.,

It’s crazy trump even has a chance of losing Texas
Is that actually true?
*Pimp
This is such a stupid sentiment though. Californians that move to Texas vote red because they were pushed out of California!
How dare the minorities vote against their masters, Hahahaha.
Voted for trump but honestly thinking this election will swing in Biden’s favor ngl
It’s better to vote on principle than to sell out
You know what they say about a fool and his money.
Maybe it's about the senators we bought along the way
Northwestern is the joke of the big ten lmao
I mean ya Trump will win its still retarded though that they call it that early

Took trump at +140. Shit won’t pay for weeks probably but fuck it
Yeah their hatred of Latinos in Florida is v sus
Bro, Trump is not good for the market, hes total fukken chaos

Markets love stability, not a moron who threatens war with other countries over twitter
Yep
Turn off your ringer
Saw a democratic something was called in Delaware with 0% of the vote.
Honestly I'm expecting the volatility later in the week when results get questioned and the legal threats start from both sides
So glad I literally can't see my positions rn.
By the time he got hit in the head enough for that, dude was already dead

Currently up 30% on my calls!!
Yep

Looks like a stance to me.

Would you have the same argument on experience with Amy McGrath vs Mitch McConnel? She’s never held office, but Mitch is a career politician.
Shout out to all my Californians in Texas voting Blue 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
Alex Jones is actually retarded.
nah he's a very transparent egomaniac
I thought Biden was supposed to win by 10%?

What about Pat Casey for Senate? Or even president?
It’s done. Biden doesn’t need it though.

BUT MUH WATER PIPE
People only move out of Cali because its property values are too high. They then go to shithole red states that have cheap property because their economy is trash.

Edit:
Contribute the same amount per capita to the federal budget as California does and I won’t call red states shitholes.
Erection. It’s spelled erection.
I believe if the margin of victory is within half a percentage for any one state, it’s an automatic recount
She can do it!
Every time a republican has lost Ohio they have lost the presidency(puts on dementia don)
Honestly,  democrats fukked up again picking up status quo with biden.   Pick someone original dammit
Fuck if Biden losses he’ll die if he wins he’ll die
What’s pumping rn?
We’re getting stimmy regardless.
BREAKING: Joe Biden has been elected as President of the United States
Because a lot already know what socialism looks like and they don’t fuckin like it.
I'm republican dawg
Is this putting in some weird sexual thing, or do you want me to tell her good things about you? Also, she doesn’t work at Wendy’s.
Trump win. Shutdown forever. Tech rules the world.
but muh Biden landslide
That's what I don't understand unless this is literally the only thing keeping him from going to prison lol
You mean that Hillary got 51% of the vote & Al Gote before her? S-ck a d-ck. 🖕
Memes
Austin just popped in to say hi now. Biden 51, Trump 47 in texas. lol
Cali will be red before Texas goes blue
i dont use the flair often but thats a fucken trap
It’s a leftist news source. Fox is probably doing similar

TRUMP 2020
Win what?
Yea a lot of them have parents or grandparents who escaped Communist countries so they hate socialism.
I think the difference will be the Lil Pump endorsement 😪
Fuck morons. They practice polygamy with under age girls.
No stimmy. Mitch still in
Imagine panic selling
Was just thinking this. Have a couple sips left of this wine bottle it’s too early for this
🤡🤡🤡
Bro, tell them in 4 years there will be a hoax virus on the loose! Also invest all in on Tesla
Who would have thought making your entire platform based on one minority would alienate other minorities.  . . .

I'm puzzled
I’m 52. My life has never changed for better or worse based on who is in the Oval Office.
Back when I was in the office I would get Wendy’s once every other week. Now I work from home and have a Wendy’s the same distance away. Haven’t had Wendy’s since I worked in the office. I’d stay away.

how much was the ask?
Spxs calls anyone ? I loaded up at like 3:00. Spy premiums were too expensive.

 best play this week is square, 80 percent of the world doesnt even know what it does
Anyone wonder why the fuck Trump even wants to do this job for 4 more years?
Yea it was a good sneeze.
who else holding their cock rn?
I’m interested to see how many Californians voted Trump.  A lot of us did and there were good rallies.  Clearly Biden but still...
Why are you surprised
Its early
Keep Austin weird
I was surprised how mild the market was today
Despite the retardation, this is the only place on the internet everyone can come together and talk shit. The only people getting offended are r/politics migrants who just discovered they can make money outside of their Starbucks jobs.

Dude its such a crock of shit. A few thousand votes can be worth millions. We need to get rid of it, and everyone should agree. It speaks volumes about Republicans that they wouldn't want majority to rule
Unless you went to UI, Northwestern or UMich your school isn’t exactly a bastion of academia
Looks like biden win must be alot of dem voter fraud

why does the margin of winning matter? like isn't it winner takes all for the state even if the margin of winning is by very little (pimp)?

Trump is getting a lot more of the Latino vote this election.
You’ll be crying when trump wins tonight. Fuck liberals
they must have some early votes that they know of
I don't know who to hate more - sleepy Joe, or Obese Trump - both are a laughingstock, and they represent the worst of America. At least Trump is the physical manifestation of a vast majority of Americans - obese as fuck.
Sorry to hear it
More pussy
So has anyone looked at NQ futures? It literally does not care (it was up earlier too even when Biden looked in better shape). I have mostly tech calls and I’m hoping for a rotation back into tech after last week’s disaster.

China has a large economy and its a shithole
It’s when you’re half-hard
Trump is too dangerous for stock market, one tweet all down. I want to live in a safe country, go Biden
I wish this thing would hurry up, and also go my way.  I have some text messages I have been waiting a long time to send.
There may be one on the moon thats neutral
Blue senate conversion will make it easier for the stimmy to pass, that's what the market cares about most short term
They also said Arkansas is too close to call 😂

But I do think Biden may take Ohio
That's anecdotal as fuck

The fact is that the demographics are changing.
bulls are fuck lmao
If Texas flips we gonna ditch the electoral college right? Not that I think it will

Lol college football coach going to the Senate baby. Peyton next pls

Ya daylight savings fucking sucks rather have it dark in the morning than dark in the evening after work
I assure you that everyone can throw away a needle already.
I bought SPY puts 10 minutes before close and am already up 25%, hoping to see red in the morning!
Let's hope not. We need to make some money. No one wants to be more poor
Did Alabama really call a Trump victory with 1% reporting in? Lol
capital gain tax? I k it’s ok for this sub
Mail-in votes are all blue.
China wants Trump to win, they don't want to deal with someone new. Trump has costed China nothing,  he has no international support. Biden can actually get EU on board to counter China together. All Trump does is talk, the EU isn't with him
Lol pipe bursting so they can’t count ballots. Can’t make this stuff up
The south isnt voting Blue until Jesus runs as a Democrat

You people have been saying “next election” for the last 30 years. Texas is never going blue
It was even odds just half an hour ago
Apollo Creed would have voted for trump
Chop em up like the Saudis do
What happened ?
I’m shocked. I thought Biden would get some redneck vores
BAN
On the real, pull out the 1k and buy something nice. Do it again with your original investment.
Biden's lawyers are for defense. He wants to make sure all the absentee/mail in ballots get counted.
You sound like you're going to cry.

Holy shit man if trump loses Texas he's absolutely fucked
Hes been sliding all night. Bidens gonna get it
You keep trying but it just not working. Take a break gather your thoughts and come back im sure you'll get them next post.

Bull or bear if you didn’t play spreads you’re retarded and asking to lose money through IV crush
Didn't he get shot?
Trump was up 300k voters when they called it for Biden, that was a head scratcher. He’s probably gonna take it once NOVA reports but still
BET
I know we're all expecting Trump to be the one to put up a legal fight to question the results but Biden also has 600 lawyers on standby so if he starts challenging the results maybe that will be the wild card to finally drop this ridiculous market rally or atleast save my VXX calls lol
Calls? I heard there’s gonna be a 100% discount on merchandise
so many retards gave her money... 80 million dollars that could have gone elsewhere

Trump slipping in Ohio
Suck a dick kakaface
Nah. Dems want big stimmy.

This sub cracks me up.
Uh, every single statistical model of a Trump victory winning includes Ohio. He can win the northern rust belt states and Florida and he'll still lose without Ohio. 

He can't win without it. I mean unless he like flips new York or California or something, lol.
All these people wanting to know if Texas is gonna flip, no buddy it’s not. Look at Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. These guys are gonna decide everything

I thought they support Kanye?

Mods are gay. No one word
Honestly, I think the biggest move we'd get is if Trump gives a speech late tonight or turns to Twitter and basically says he's not conceding and he's going to contest the election. That will send VIX through the roof.
Deal
Spy needs to be down 4% for my puts to print
It's gonna happen by 2024-2028 but yeah too early this time around
Imagine Republicans suddenly pitching fits about the electoral college like Dems have been doing for the last four years
Yeah oh yeah.  More fetishizing politicians and crusty old judges yeahhh.  You Republicans are a bunch of fucking inbred children

The house always wins. If Vegas says Biden, Biden it is.
John King: *But some good news, Biden has votes left in ---- county*
In Texas, Biden is leading trump by very very small margin but the problem is most of the votes are from Huston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Corpus Christi. Once we move rural then fireworks begins.
Bears are gunna eat shit tomorrow
Did some math. You are right it would be 272-266 (Nebraska changed their system so Biden gets a vote there). I forgot about Arizona when I was adding up the points. So yes I guess Trump needs to win every single state he won in 2016 except those 2.
Maybe friendship was the 10 bagger all along
I’m so glad I cashed out my stonks today.

I don't know, I could see a "markets rally on recount hope" and it wouldnt surprise me
MSM not even trying to hide their biases right now with how they’re covering the election
Big blue areas reported first.
some grain of truth in this, they are very big on how they are perceived
Penn Station
McConnell is to stimulus as ... Trump is to paying taxes
Also calls on Dell.
Not if trump takes Florida
With a name like that she should be...
If Biden wins, he's definitely getting his d-ck sucked.  I'll do it if nobody else is going to step up.
Imagine thinking Amy McGrath would happen - probably NKLA bulls
Prepare for thy downvotes

Trump really made up 10% in Miami-Dade off Lil Pump
I have some gold! Is it good??

I know we're all expecting Trump to be the one to put up a legal fight to question the results but Biden also has 600 lawyers on standby so if he starts challenging the results maybe that will be the wild card to finally drop this ridiculous market rally
They’re super liberal down there, like Austin Jr. these days.

You moron, Selling on the news would be selling when he actually gets sworn-in during January.
Yep and the first one is pronounced "Kan-saw".
Biden -170 Trump +140 now
I’m not saying the polls are right, but you can’t draw a conclusion about national polls based on a +/- of 3-4 in one state...  literally the margin of error.

There's literally no path to a Trump victory without Ohio.

I'm there.. can confirm
Trump r fuk
Think of it this way.

You didnt have to count a single vote to know that Trump was winning Alabama
EXACTLY ! no one here that’s for sure
Unless mango wins
Mississippi called in 1997
Hope the Algos are keeping hydrated

If texas goes blue repubs should move to cali and then make it red. Take turns every 20 years
[deleted]
They called Vermont after 2100 votes
Yeah those squares are quite satisfying.

They know what the fuck they're doing.
they started talking about some stupid shit I had to switch lol
if anyone wins definitively, it be green
[deleted]
California will never go red, Texas will actually probably go blue though.
[deleted]
Who’s giving me a stimulus check for calls? You get my vote
What if I’m not from here but passed the U.S. government test?
Stability. And I’m afraid we aren’t going to get it.
I would be so mad if I lived in Texas. What a disgrace.
Up to 46% reporting. Biden has a marginal lead
Literally nothing substantive has happened yet.
How is Kanye doing? That will decide tomorrow’s market.
Wont
Hold

Done.
i didn't even consider the scenario that there could be biden prez and GOP senate... we'll still be talking about COVID stimulus on the 2024 campaign trail if thats the case
What cunt? What he say? Cramer?
Sit back, grab a drink and soak up their tears
Futures changed pretty quickly.
Is that supposed to scare the rioters? Bro look back at American history. When the fuck did they ever get scared and obey the government?
Here's to my calls

Another day of outstanding journalism from cnbc
A decisive victory either way short term.
i pussied out
Because some states have voted the same way for the last 100 years. Pretty easy to call them early

It’s honestly hilarious how retarded this sub is.. not even an hour ago y’all saying “bears r fuk” now it’s “bulls r fuk” none of y’all got a clue how the market works 😂 very comical reading here
Joe rogan
I don’t think it knows what it wants
All the old people in Texas retire to Florida for non shitty beaches.
Lol, they called Alabama etc with 0%
I haven't even gotten one vote :(
2016
Honestly I want this just to watch the epic meltdown from trump not understanding why he loses despite having won the same way
!remindme 1 week
Smh, suburban moms and white voters without a college degree deciding the future of this country.
celestial cock suckers, Wu
Predictit spazzing out for anyone else?
Blame joe rogan for Texas
FUCK AND I SPENT 35$ ON THIS TRUMP HAT
Is that the strike or the # of puts lol
Yeah not sure how it’s not called yet, but maybe it’s only early voting. This year is going to make this shit look wonky

Me too im wondering about that, some states reported like 1% vote and the electoral college is already given lmao
I hate californians. Always shitting up their own state with liberal policies and then mass exodusing to my state and voting for the same shit.
Usuretho, for real tho trump made a point to have joe say he hated oil the last debate. How can texas be blue.
[deleted]
I call that trading opportunity.

mental note:  whenever some Chinese dude making too much money mentions something against the "party" short that sucker.
Looks like FL is a lost cause for Biden.
Fucking locusts
[removed]
Although this may seem closer than what ppl thought, I think there is no way Trump wins PA. 
And if he loses TX that’s like the Republican apocalypse.
TBH if Dem lost this election, it prob because of not accepting the 1.8 trillion dollar package. Lot of my friends got urk by that even though they are going to vote blue anyway
Whats the score
Lol wow San Antonio full Biden now
This market has been selling on the news , if trump doesn't win there will be a sell off
In terms of calling elections, you can.

There are two major organizations in the US that count votes and project winners, and CNN and FOX each use one of them.
Biden is fucking sweeping
Come on man, at least make an effort. This is lazy af

Voted for Trump today, first time I've ever voted. Let's do it boys.
Deserved probably already got Tons of hate on all my comments about buying 362 puts today lol
Waters getting choppy for mango
Listen idiots look at the map of Texas right now. You see the few blue counties that reported? The rest of the state will be red except the border
Trump wins Pop Vote, Biden wins the College...all hell breaks lose...
at least arnold was at least somewhat involved in politics before he even ran

edit: and at least arnold would take a stance and show knowledge of issues and policies
I’ve been asking this question all night
He didn't ram over them bc the elections were near... Now ahahahaha go to cry rioters the army is going out.
Typical American. I was assuming everyone on the Internet is from here LOL
How about bet you a permanent ban here?

Texas better be red. But only the major city county reported. The rest haven’t.  here to a contested race.
She’s the libertarian/porn hub candidate.

Those racists didnt even put him on the ballot
What does the market want, that's all I care about
What about Texas ? If Biden grabs it isn't it over for Donnie ?
Because you’re retarded.
Ye
If I imagine spotting a bot trying to comment as a human, it would look exactly like your comment
FOX.. balance and fair
tongue-punch that fart-box! USA!
need dat link
Going into this it was projected he would lose by 2 points, he's going to win by 2+. That just means the polling in the rest of the country is wrong too. Not good for Sleepy Joe!
Plano is safe AF go away
You know why?  Mango gonna be unleased with no re-election in line.   UVXY to 100 bro
Texas is going blue wtf
what is this, porn for ants?
Give that fellow a RH account
Can’t believe no in the west coast is voting... ~~lol~~
yep because a biden win was priced in. so trump win = uncertainty
what live stream u cucks watching on YouTube
Why does it say "won" and then something like 7% of votes counted. Either im retarded, given, or the mathematics don't work

I didn’t read the “ and almost called you a retard 😅
Let’s go Trump!!!!
Yeah, lets send the military on your own citizens. You follow QAnon too?
If Biden wins Texas it would be truly retarded and typical of 2020. How the fuck can you lose Florida but win Texas a historically strong Republican state.
If Ohio goes blue trump is done for imo
Which is the best station to watch the elections, which is unbiased??
I wouldn't be surprised at this point.
biden is going to take TX fool
Shouldn't affect ITM options as much. Also if the elections are contested, then IV crush ain't gonna happen either
There’s a 0% chance that Texas goes to Biden
Mississippi, 3000 votes enough to call it....
Ant sized, we should have known
BABA is RIP in HK, also who yall got winning election?
Narrator :

*And at this moment, he knew he fucked up*
Meh, historically-speaking, markets tend to do well after a democratic president takes office. Who needs a house when you have stonks.
GG TX. Trump won TX
Trump taking all the fat, sleeveless hillbilly states. Who'd have thunk?
Uncounted counties are super liberal
We are talking about Election Day. Tomorrow will decide which way we will be heading for rest of the week.
Holy shit TEXAS would be the nail in the coffin ⚰️
Hopefully it was a ban haha
Plano

I’m reckless 

Come up in the building and I might just jack yo necklace
Why yes I did
Who the fuck is voting for Jo Jorgeson? who even is that and why do they have a fake name?
Good luck buddy
Almost like they have values or principles or sth
Trump bigly up in Michigan and FL

Thats pretty big
Which is the best station to watch the elections. That’s unbiased
Dumb ass Californians ruined their own state with homeless and debt.  Then proceed to move to Texas and continue to vote the exact same way. Since what do they care,  they got a house paid off and a telsa.  Nothing better to virtue signal til they ruin the next city.  They are like locust lol.

she doesn't put out.
yeah i mean i don't disagree but i think objectivism deserves at least a little bit more consideration than it's typically given. i don't think it should really be considered an entire philosophy for the reasons you stated like it's short sightedness but i don't think it's entirely different than adam smith's invisible hand. she seems to actively disavow greed rather than argue in favor of it like you're suggesting which is part of where i think people misunderstand her.

i'm not even saying i agree with objectivism, but i think it's a valuable concept as a thought experiment if nothing else
Yeah, they're basically making a call based on turnout predictions in un-reported blue counties.
Rogan: it’s entirely possible
before 8PM,  UVXY shot up from 17.67 to 19.24
Remember the wall? And repeal Obamacare within 30 days? And which party couldn’t get that done when they controlled all 3 branches?
Biden doesn’t need Florida...  trump does...
There's like 10% of the vote counted retard. No Republican has ever won VA.
What’s your reasoning for that?

The fuck is going on in NC? Do they usually vote blue?
[deleted]
Yeah her opponent dropped out after going through a divorce and getting threatened. He’d never run for anything before
He slept while Trump was calling him a socialist
Democrats failed to unseat McConnell. If they fail to unseat Graham and Trump after spending shit load of money (which could have been better spent on YOLO trades in this sub), the entire Democratic leadership needs replaced. Incompetence should not be rewarded
Texas is the state where trumpers literally tried to kill someone in broad daylight and nothing happened so you tell me
[deleted]
Until a month ago it moved with TSLA and Nasdaq. Now it just moves up
[deleted]
Apparently Virgina was called for Biden by the associated press with only 32% votes in? Probably bugged
Still close. 

NY Times had projected if Biden wins any/either FL, GA, or NC, he is most likely the winner and it would be decided quickly. Right now he is not favored to win any. So it is still a toss up.[Here is their Live probability needles ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html) for each of those three states. If these three go Red, it’s anybody’s game.

If one went Blue, likely Biden victory over all
bull market goes TRRRUUUUUUUUUUUMP
Joe gay
Hahahaha it is. I'm not even American so I don't really care that much about the election. Was just there to troll

Interesting. Seems the market wants a Biden win. 🤔🤔
I respected the fuck out of Shep when he left Fox.

Love that he's on CNBC now. His nightly show is a solid recap of the day without the talking-head bullshit.
This is what I said, but people told me the uncounted areas are super liberal and it’s basically automatically a blue state

Why?  Zero stimulus gets passed in that scenario.

Trump gaining steam in TX
Looks bearish to me
Yeah. Mango wins. sleepy calls a recount. And blue wins house and senate
But I still like him! You see, I can’t think that basic, so I need to hear him tell me what all the dumb (not retarded) people are doing
I don't understand this. NASDAQ is big tech, big tech is censoring everything trump related (sort of) NASDAQ companies are for the left  
Edit: I'm open to having my mind changed. I'm Canadian this ain't my fight lol.

Jokes on you.  I have 1,000 in savings AND 40k+ in credit card debt.    So top 30% in savings.  And top 1% in bad decisions.

Arkansas too early to call

Trump:42
Biden:30
Yessir
Some of y’all retards failed US government in high school
Just seen odds lengthened for trump
Agreed 🍻
So if Biden becomes prez he should normalize relationship with Cuba and Venezuela just to spite Latinos in FL who voted against him
Talked to a GOP contractor designing campaign ads in 2018, she said she was already designing Texas ads then for 2020 and her firm was getting a huge budget cuz everyone was worried about keeping it red. Said their data pointed to it as flipping without a massive operation.

It's amazing how many people go out and make the effort to vote, before literally throwing their time down the drain.

-.4% is nothing son. That is the market waiting for big green or big red
Calls on Trump killing himself after losing Texas and Carolina
There’s no way it’s close rn is it?
Companies basically gave people the day off.

NOTHING got done in large companies today by anyone who remote works
BIGLY
Can’t you’ve already nutted. Only the pure can meat the mighty macadamia
I just chose it because it looks cool
The funny thing is that I'm not even American. I don't really care who wins, Trump just makes more headlines in the news so I've been entertained these past 4 years.
He wasn't ever going to win that state.
A put for December?! That's not how we play SPY around here...
 It's almost there's a major volatility event going on after a huge unexplicable Trump 

There I fixed it for you.
liar
Quite the master at fucking shit up that guy.
Large futures swings. While most of us waste our time consuming media, the futures gang is either making a killing or losing it all.
That’s what you deserve if you voted trump lol.
I thought we were getting a woman president in 2016, instead we got a mentally handicapped president and I was like, "Only in America."
Is there a scenario where mango man wins and we dump
Tomorrow
Puts on work productivity tomorrow
Thanks 

So it's still close or can go to contested ?
If Trump wins FL and loses TX then I don’t know wtf to make of all this.
“Omg futures up 1% game over 5% game on spy tomorrow 400 eom - kill yourself you gay fucking aasholes you hate America  maga forwrver hrr drr drr” - everyone 1 hour ago

Including you 🤡
Anyone got a link to that guy on MSNBC panicking in 2016 when Trump won and trying to figure out how Hillary can still win?
I sold 323 puts for tomorrow
Of course WSB go with the dying retard. Inverse 🍊 2020
He's going to send in the national gaurds
If Trump wins everything he did in 2016 except Ohio and NC he wins 273 to 265.
Lol they still exist?
Futures are too high imo
Are you implying the big cities are more red than the other parts?
This discussion thread is as high energy as Jeb Bush
I’ve got more faith in Biden winning Texas then Florida tbh, I figured Florida was going to go red af with all those anti-socialist ads they were running
If Trump takes Michigan this gets interesting
To buy TSLA calls, I think. But I'm no professional
TX on Deck!!! LOL
God damn
If you don’t vote for Donald trump you ain’t white

The real market determination depends on if they can call a clear winner tonight or tomorrow.  


The market HATES the unknown. If there’s not a clear winner tonight, the market is going to tank. 


If there is a clear winner tonight, it doesn’t matter who, the market will go up (give & take certain sectors obviously). 



All in all, you have a small chance if the presidential race is still looking like a coin toss tomorrow at 9:30am

Dems likely reverse the bans on Chinese tech

like idc who wins, obviously one candidate would make it more likely but no contested bullshit please ughhh
It’s way too early. Only states called so far for each candidate were expected to go as they did. Florida is the first toss up state it looks like is going to Trump. That’s 1 battleground state

Not judging here at all. but Google the projections and it will help keep score. Right now the map looks like it was “expected” to (except FL toss up now being Trump)
PA is not looking good for mango at all
Texas is a battleground, and been slowly gaining for dems. Next election, Texas has a good chance of winning for the dems.

Cos they’re pretty certain based on the votes counted already, certain enough to make a call. It’s not official yet but it’s likely enough that the networks will stake their reputation on it.

I think its the opposite of what people think - if Biden wins I think bull run / bubble will continue, and if Trump wins well go Bear and pop!

Ohio not looking good
Why is s&p so detached from nasdaq right now
Maybe because the Ayn Rand philosophy is demonstrably short sighted. Think about how interconnected the world is-now more than ever.  Everything we or other countries do ultimately affects everyone. Pure unchecked capitalism that rand championed ends up with results like Somalia. Her “objectivism” philosophy has been lampooned by critics countless times for more reasons than I’m going to list on wallstreetbets. It’s not “misunderstood” it’s just a shallow selfish sophomoric way of thinking. It’s ok to look out for yourself and to be greedy sometimes. If everyone did it all the time we would be ferengi and it’s stupid to want to live in a society like that.

Why should I? Y'all haven't changed for four years.
I feel like back to back elections the Dems have nominated the _only_ candidates that wouldn't beat Trump
I joined a FB group where people pretend to be an Ant colony and it is the funniest shit ever. They post a picture of like fruit and people comment on it “YUM” and “NOM” and “EAT”. Or a picture of a magnifying glass and they say “ATTACK” or “BITE”.

You should. If you didn’t, that would be concerning.  However, just remember that it’s going to suck, but it won’t really matter much for very long.  Obviously the repercussions won’t be undone, but in awhile they won’t impact your day to day. 

In a couple of years, it probably won’t even matter (besides the occasional reminder from friends and family lol).  You might always regret it, but it won’t always suck as much as it does fresh.  We all regret things we did (or didn’t do), they don’t have to ruin our lives or cause us daily misery.  But the short term won’t be fun.  

Chin up & just remember that it’s just numbers on paper.  People here have spent more than that on cocaine and hookers, if you learn something from it (obviously it wasn’t investing), then you’re further ahead than them.

Oh ok that makes sense. Basically some states are fixed Democrat or Republican states so you can account for a certain number of guaranteed votes from these states. Other states flip flop depending on the candidate they prefer and some like Florida and Pennsylvania have a good amounts of vote to get you closer to the 270 needed to win.

Harris will win in 2024
I trade out if it starts going the other way. So far, that hasn't been the case. 🙋🏻‍♂️
Damn MI just went big red
Biden did worse than Hillary in Florida
How did Biden win Virginia could someone please enlighten me? It says that its only 28% reported with Trump leading 59.5% to 38.7% and somehow Biden won the electoral votes. Im so confused
Interesting. Zaxby's?
I voted for him earlier today it felt great, man I hope I get to see all the libs have breakdowns and cry again lol https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYNVH0U3cs
It’s not too late, if you’re long term you can easily double your money in a year or so.
My vix calls do not want this

Crack cocaine
Its a vote against liberals rather than for Trump. They'd vote for Satan so long as "he's sticking it to them libs"
texas is spazzing
Robinhood crash tomorrow? 😂

I am moving to Canada if Kanye loses

Jesus
bullshit. it'll affect everyone in the country in minor ways, not zero
It's up to PA now
last one is a sure bet
Probably back when he was a kid there it was very different. But also he needs to connect to the voters.
That’s like me switching between the election and daily moves threads
Who wants to go out and kick some ass?
Ggez only
FLORIDA Called for mango!
Tech really out here trying to save the whole market
Bro same! Except I went to prison for half a decade after my homeless junkie stint. Now I'm making 6 figures a year and have a quarter of that figure in a portfolio. People change and grow. Not everyone, but some of us.
Coporations come and go.
sell the news me hopes
It’s a shame
Rank choice
Lmfao it starts already
Biden lost Florida it’s over gg
No if Biden wins Ohio, he wins the election. There’s basically no path for Trump to win if Biden wins Ohio.
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.
[deleted]
BLM fucked Biden
One of them is wrong
regardless who's winning, I'm getting high tonight
Hey, I'm pro biden, but you can never.
That is the ultimate truth.
When's the last time a president lost Florida but won election..... 

Doesn't look good. Puts on Biden.
Futures drunk af
It's based on two things:

Projections, they kind of extrapolate from the votes they already have

And

Historical precedent. SC was *always* going to go for Trump. They're *always* red, lol. 

And maybe also some wishful thinking.
Why? It's basically flat.
You’re going to jail. Puts on your heterosexuality
Username checks out
When do the riots start?
FUCK NANCY PELOSI AND FUUUUUUUCK BITCH MCCONNELL
Dude this guy has been talking for 3 hours straight. It’s hella impressive.

Look up vix contango or Twitter handle @jam_croissant
hilary won virginia retard

florida i agree
Whats ironic is he will probably take Ohio on the mail in ballots counted after today

Pennsylvania is the real focus here
to be fair he is quite entertaining on twitter
Expiring Friday 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I just need baba to go up, that’s literally it
VA gone blue since 2008 pretty sure
Yes and Texas
Its entertainment
Fox already said Biden won Virginia lol
Y'all ever wonder if famous people frequent WSB? I'll have you know I'm one of those numbers that voted in Michigan 😏
🤢
BABA down 9% on the honk-honk stock market. Fuckin Lego Head Ma always saying stupid shit and tanking it
no, im european
CNBC election coverage is pretty good so far.

Switching between them and Fox/CNN is jarring.
Headline tomorrow:

Trump wins Thanks to Latino voters in Miami-dade county
[deleted]
jesus this shit is close as fuck
I’m not angry Florida, just disappointed
Took my $4k loss today from last night and today’s bullshit as a sign to sit this one out XD
It’s almost like the Democrats trotted out an uninspiring ticket
im european
Anyone playing prop 22 bets with Uber and Lyft?
Alright cool, let’s see if I can make it until midnight 😅
not that the tobacca!
I can 100% guarantee that a man will win the presidency this year


Mods ban me if I'm wrong
Well my puts are ded
Mental illness
CNBC Poll had Florida +3 Biden lolololollolo
As the other guy said, then Biden wins Ohio. That’s all it means
I beg to differ.
🤯🤯🤯
lmfao
Jeez sounds kinda fishy idk.
Looks like it.
it blows my mind that there are millions of people who actually vote for Trump lmao what a time
Ya got Bojangles?
so you spent \~1600 on something you have no idea how to exit
Bought some puts at about 350 today for the gamble expiring tomorrow. 🤷‍♂️
forreal? I think I'm gonna move there, maybe he'll be governor one day
What kind of workout did Lindsay finish?
Fuck anally probing myself might make me nut tho
Don't worry just keep going until your balls falls off then no blue balls anymore.
Jack straight
Mexicans
Lol. A pajama trader gatekeeping WSB? Yes sir/ma’am
Bc without it Trump guaranteed loses. Now that he's winning, he's still got a decent (but not favored) chance
Buy calls because employee compensation is up. TLDR, Gamestop is having a tiktok competition for 100 bucks and/or? 10 work hours. Big employee appreciation there
Two party system is broken. No one was inspiring this time around.
Was trading in 2009-2019 just straight easy mode? Looking at the SPY max chart it looks like it went straight up except for that big dip in 2018.
Imagine thinking Florida or Virginia will vote blue 

Imagine being that brain dead
Ban this spam shit
It makes a contested result more likely 🧸🧸
why do some of you get so worked up over this. it will have zero affect on your life at all. ZERO
Where are all the bulls that were talkin shit?
It was sold on SL.  Went back down to 3, got too busy during the March dump.  Shoulda, coulda, woulda.
Google it instead of asking these scholars. I say no they are not a state
Pure gold. We should have a thread on “what does it take to get banned from r/politics”
TOS down for anybody else?
Then Biden wins ohio
Heard you have to go to christmas if you start late. No nut taxation
Just asked Modi .He says Trump.
I'm not gonna change your mind, because you're right lmao

I think if he needs both.
I hate that sub. And I'm not even American.
Be already one
why? Isn't low taxes and low regulations best for companies and hence stocks?
Trump is gonna win Florida and probably Georgia. However, what if Biden randomly wins Ohio, which was projected for Trump.

The big toss up states left are Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, and maybe Ohio and Texas. Might be misremembering a state so correct me if I’m wrong.
Panhandle is deep red.

I hate my state so much
We only care about making or losing money. Fuck politics
fuckkkkk meee this shit is getting scary
I went up 100% the last two jumps. Both times it’s dipped, but not by a significant margin. If I waited for the dips I would have made way more. It’s always a risk to wait for one, but it’s trended this way several times already.
Nice man. Was looking at Canada iShares this week
I mean they were just waiting for election didn't they ? Now we will see stimulus as per Trump's wishes, House won't have much of bargaining chip

Yo what news station you guys watching the erection on?
I bought 1 ES 11/4 3300 P for $1,125 and 1 ES 11/4 3450 C for $512.50

Can anyone explain what my P&L looks like should /ES go up or down?
You are rooting for your wallet. Maybe we call her betty
WTF would you WANT to sleep tonight. The volatility is what we live for!
It’s worth too many points IMO

I had the NYT chart up but it was too much screen space for my triple monitors. I need to be able to talk shit with my degenerate peoples.

Also Bloomberg looks like Tetris.
Then retreating back into his shell
Stable bullish markets.
Yeah pinnacle is better, he’s -1000 there. Still up but not as much
So Florida is for mango?
Oh it's a penis joke, nice

Vodka & apple cider or vodka & guava juice? Yes I am a 43 year old housewife.
News flash: Trump isn't the source of your problems, you are.
Ohio and Pennsylvania will be why Donnie loses
Yes, yes, and Marchish
These futures aren't even exciting yet compared to some nights recently.

Mitch the Bitch. Fucking Kentucky jesus christ.
To quote Cramer "there's a bull market somewhere" I don't care if we get Trump or Biden. I'm also Canadian
Save the whiskey, burn everything else in Kentucky

Smh Bitch McConnell is gonna win
Pull him out Apoc
Except Nebraska district 2
Shoulda kept my puts fuck
The remaining counties that have a lot of votes to be counted in Florida - any one have any idea what the demographics are like?
Should have got in early, those cars looks slick as well.
Considering that was 2 months ago yes.
[deleted]
My bad, Nebraska and Maine confused me
I don’t even know who I’m rooting for
Ill trade u, tired of fake city problems would rather have real stick problems
Almost assuredly
mango has to win texas

if joe wins 38+55 thats like 1/3 the needed votes
Whatever, McConnell is slipping in the shower before the end of the year.
Not with a blue house, as you’ve seen these past few months.
at least he's handsome
Alaska they love him
This sub is definitely one of the most conservative on reddit
It's going down for real
Not if he wins FL
are you like 16 years old or something
Lol

Mitch McConnell giving a big fuck you to everyone who hates him
I highly repect you if you bought call/puts today and they're are still active
Kentucky a shithole, change my mind

I finished the day at a net change in my account of $0.00 with after market action
I heard if trump wins target and Walmart are having a fire sale
OH and PA Blue SPY $400
NOVA and Richmond too close to swamp. SE VA all Trump
Kanye rn: "oh" 👁👄👁
He needs North Carolina to win comfortably, but yeah you're right
CAnt we just have a clear winner pleeease
This thread is so much more fun than /r/politics.

It's like watching water boil, cept it's chlorine and you might get chemical burns.
Imagine taking stock advice from someone who calls them evaluations
lol
What will be the first state that Kanye wins?
My fiance is stressing bigly. She's not a big don fan. Need Joe to pull it out or i'm gonna be stuck banging my right hand for the next month
I still don't know who the market wants to win but I'm guessing it doesn't matter that much.
Red or Blue fuck the electoral college, one person one vote
Imagine thinking Florida man supports sleepy joe
Lol, the classic “Trump mooning in FL”.

+0.6%
320*
What happened?
Get a bovada account and do sports betting. Just makes sports a little more interesting. Don’t take it too seriously and only bet small amounts
Can’t believe trump won PA and OH in 2016. If he loses them tonight he’s fucked?
AAPL figures out which index is doing shittier that day and follows it.
I'd make about 5000, so roughly 17%.
[deleted]
Moscow Mitch will continue to hinder the American people, good job Kentucky
Just close your eyes. It ain’t that hard
CNBC reporting breaking news from like 3 hours ago.. just stick to the business day. Switching to CNN
Can’t wait for whoever wins to pump market with massive stimmy promise in their acceptance speech.

Who is leading now.
I posted about Trump winning Florida and got over 100 downvotes in like 2 minutes lmao.
It’s a swing state
Good either way puts and calls 332p 340c
That mail in vote for PA Jesus
Bol Bol for president
Wonder what their excuse will be this time: Russians? Gynas? Iranians?
too many calls for a bear market trend
-5% I would make 10-15k
GameStop
Yes never too late. I’m on day 3. Got to get through tonight though
Good man
I love the whole “too early to call”.  Shut up CNN and just go ahead and color NY, CA, WA, OR blue.  Then paint NE, TN, OK red...
MITCH MCCUCK
Seriously fuck Florida.  Those guys are spooky bad luck
Same here when futures go down 0.1% 'bulls r fuk'.
yes
Try now
why does florida matter so much
Nah, Donnie = Stimmy
Biden clear win
Unanimous W
Probably nothing important going on
I got downvoted for asking that and somebody said to anally probe myself to offset the nut. So do what you will with that info
Sup beavs
2020 - maximum chaos
I'm going to do a 3 way parlay. 

1. Biden going to win

CNN has a dick in their mouth. Go check out the sports books. God bless DJT!

Some did, big news orgs haven't called it.

I'll trust it when cnn/fox call it
You aint gonna be buying shit for christmas. But I’ll volunteer at the soup kitchen you’re eating at
Was just gunna say the same thing
Printer goes brrrr
If Biden holds onto every state he's leading, he pretty much wins the thing with western blue states coming in.

Poll going strong. 680 votes polled. No intimidation and voter suppression please.

Here is the poll for 🐄 vs 🐻 . Pleas submit your votes.

https://strawpoll.com/u8swvdvbx
Texas?  What a bunch of little champion, hanging Chad boys voting for Biden.
Lol if trump wins I won’t need tendies to buy an xbox
well there goes our chance at a quick election result... fucking florida
👍
If that gets called, we can all go to bed.
We drilling now. Fuuuuuuuckkkkkk
Battery swap appeals to those in China who live in the inner city and don’t have garages. Battery swap is optional if you have your own way to charge. It’s just an added bonus.
They probably took his phone away
Biden isn’t taking Texas lmao

Yes
-3 overnight, then opened up +2%.
Total Psyop.  No way Texas goes blue.
What strike price
Ban.
what is the best outcome for stocks to go up tomorrow?
#THIS IS WILD
if you're seeing winning then yes
[deleted]
Makes no sense nothing is happening in rl
That's only the consensus because the people who decide the consensus are anti-Trump. Bidens taxes will kill companies long term.
how am I gonna sleep tonight wtf
Some poor trader in Japan just sat down late for work, hungover and looked at his screen and realized it was the US election and shit is about to get weird
Nio was much better up 1% AH 30 mins ago
Big life changes for me if Trump wins. Life is near intolerable as it is already. Four more years will break me. Might move to a big city. Be near people. The sticks are too isolated.
Better than 80% of 'Fund managers'.
I’ll let you know in the morning
What sucks is it’s the fucking electoral college not out votes
I can call California for Biden with 0 percent of vote counted.
538!!! Fuck Nate silver
Because of Florida?

Lol
[deleted]
i watch today and he said its going both ways wtf you speaking of

&#x200B;

Wrap it up fellas he picked heads and it indeed was heads, good game!
Short term excitement. Long term bad effects

-5% my VXX calls would print massively
Anyone betting?? Biden longshots on Texas look good but I think Trump is barely gonna snag it
NBC News just called McConnell win

TRUMP IS GOING TO WIN !!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

PA started reporting
CNN
Stop being a little bitch
Bonds? Bail bonds?
So who won
It always is this early cause they count the cities first
Senate is going Dem and House might flip over to Republican. Fuck its close

It's almost there's a major volatility event going on after a huge unexplicable oump
Is gambling good?
Am I fucking banned or what!?
down = good

up = fml and portfolio :(
I think they called Trump for Florida
Lot of latinos believe voting trump is the macho man thing to do regardless of what he says, and macho man culture is extremely strong
Nope
You know i think the best part about this political thread is that both pro biden and pro trump things get upvoted as long as theyre well thought out or obviously satirical. Its when people post political bullshit that things get downvoted so everyones just enforcing the rules as a community from all sides. This has been another gay i heart wsb post
Wait what
FL to trump.
by who?
Not sure if commuting by helicopter to work or homeless by end of week =/
How the fuck is trump losing Texas.  Like that screams Republicans and guns and shit
Way too close.
[deleted]
Yao Ming for president.
I'm surprised that orange man isn't tweeting all over the place.
Check again
Lol.... It's not that I'm pissed because "oh no my candidate is losing."

It's just wtf... How does this inspire confidence in the system? 

For all the shit they talked about trump hurting the system, still, every fucking year we see this and it DOES NOT inspire confidence.
>i'm so confused... is biden good or bad for markets?

THIS IS FINANCE NOT POLITICS WITH RANDOM DOLLAR NUMBERS
I think the most telling thing about the futures tonight is that when everything was up big early on, the Nasdaq was lagging the Dow and S&P. Now with them down, the Nasdaq is holding on more than the other two. Tells you about what people think depending on who gets in.
Invest in plywood for windows
This is the best. Remember when every liberal downvoted me when I said trump was going to win 😂
Hey guys,

Puts on XOM?
And no stimmy
Yeah keep in mind.  There's nibbas who have been in it since its early days who are waiting for just onnee more dollar to sell off.  The only question is: how MANY of those guys are waiting...

I bought a put for 11/20 just to fucking see how it'll go...

What’s this main stream news you read?
[deleted]
No people don’t want rioting/looting so they vote for Trump
Obviously Biden isn’t going to win Florida, but you’re posting shit like this while I guarantee “fake news” is in your vocabulary.

We accept all views here because we are all special (ed)
ehhh, lock them gains with a trailing stop
Yes
Futures. Just looking for the election reaction lol
They just keep ask for the government cut taxes. What do you think?

🥳🥳🥳🥳 yes sir
lol i swear most of the people posting about market crashes are the ones selling OTM puts
Yes
Still better than RH
[deleted]
i'm so confused... is biden good or bad for markets?
Why is AP results diffetent from what CNN and others are reporting
Lmao nice, let’s see that print screen
Bullish for our crippling US budget. You can make money in both markets, just be better.
It’s like calling a game after the first touchdown lol
That's why you don't watch biased news.

Your billionaire boy bloomy:

> It’s possible that neither candidate reaches the 270 electoral votes needed to win by the end of election night.
MMA is about speed and flexibility. Dude can't walk down a ramp
AP is calling races and has a lot more data at hand than you counting reported votes.
Oil industry is depleted. Fracking is all but dead. Oil prices are in the toilet.

My college roomy who is sell side analyst covering energy industry cries to sleep every night
Definitely not RH. It's TDA.
So true
those are odds
No way Biden wins GA.  Total bullshit.
this sub will be fine
xD.
Some people on the internet has been trading so madly that they kinda forgot the basic idea behind investing.
1 day chart 🤣
wonder what the race would look like if dems werent so lazy and voted in person
did futures tank when florida results came through?
What channel y’all watching? I keep bouncing between CNN and Fox News. CNN guy basically trademarked the phrase “suburbs are where the math is” and Fox News guy can’t do math.
So, you think that rioting and looting demonstrates that he has support?
Thank you man. You’re very smart!
dude we were literally making jokes about this when tesla split...
Michigan, Wisconsin & Pennsylvania are the key states
I dont work at wendys but I did get their breakfast alot when it first came out nationwide. Its alright. The sausage is nice and spicy. Biscuits a little dry and their bacon egg and cheese biscuit got nothing on McDonald's. I expect it to go flat, maybe slight upside if breakfast went well, but from what I saw it wasnt anything surprising.
Trust me, I did...

Doesn’t matter to theta gang though. They want neither side to print.
Anyone figured out what the market wants ?
SPY red. VIX red. What is this witchery
That’s the most American thing I’ve seen so far. 🍺 🍺 🍺
Biden cal literally loose the entire south east and win y’all needa chill
Quit being stockcist
They shouldn't be..cause the Trump train don't stop baby. Trump me the fuck up and shower me in downvotes baby!
This whole thing will end up as a huge ass nothing burger if we get trump back, red Senate as it was and blue house. That would cause a red day on both SPY and VIX as it's just nothing different from what we already had.
all this movement and futures still basically flat
Lol true
Trump taking a slightly larger lead in FL
Winner winner chicken dinner 😂
he got until 11/13.  anything can happen..lol
Markets are too thin. That gap would narrow quick if any big money came in.
No shame in voting for the smaller piece of shit
[deleted]
How was the market 4 years ago today?
Got 'em!
I laughed at how you genuinely countered his comment
Mango Gets FL and Georgia?
[removed]
But what if?  I’d love to see all my neighbors pissed
watching r/politics is like watching futures right now lol.  every micro change people freaking out
Guys, I was banned from r/politics by writing: "Thank god, 4 more years of Trump. God bless America!" I also got 100 downvotes in 2 minutes, that's crazy.
Lowkey want mango to win again, just to see how this sub reacts.
I dunno man something about Kanye West, I think he is running for president
So even if trump has 60% of the votes, biden just won some key areas within virginia?

Is biden from fucking scranton?
So many people are so stupid that they think the market will go green if their guy wins.
Hey there’s still come money left, lose it all or trade your way to WSB Valhalla
Exactly. Bro. Volatility is our friend.
its gonna be a tie until big dick cali drops trow
I think futures want Biden to win lol
are you delusional? trump has basically won florida biden isn’t gonna win texas
Texas will not be blue. They love their oil.
Not really though? Biden still has a clear path to 270 without either...
Was just gonna say the same thing
You don't rat out the establishment without consequences.

Thank you for the info. I really can’t buy into their battery swap thing though. Hope that is just an additional feature.
They said it was in play in 2016 too lol
How can you buy them now?
This is gonna be a stupid ass question but are my spy puts good because Biden is -145 now?
Wtf did you just attempt to growl

Florida looking like a Trump win, but wow I’m surprised how much Biden is crushing Ohio currently. Gonna be a tight one.
alabama bout to have a college football coach for a senator instead of the lawyer incumbent who also prosecuted the klan members who bombed the 16th street baptist church

Bruh... this isn't the primaries. It's winner take all
Can't wait to pick up my Free PS5 if Donnie wins the election
Something like that
Not true. Biden camp never counted for those states., They are counting on Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania
BLUE growing on graph
When we find out this whole time the market was controlled by this French bulldog.
Dems have gained 3 seats in the senate so far. Stimmy coming baby.
At least futures are showing what people have been saying for a while.

Biden is a bull for markets. Trump is a bear for markets. Can't ask for a clearer sign than the reality of the futures market.
Say it agin?
Lets get more comments than in the daily thread
Love it when they show a state, "\_\_\_\_ winning big in Georgia"

24,000 votes counted
These futures are wild man
The panhandle is last to report and will be solidly red. Betting markets say Trump has Florida in the bag.
And just like that back to green
lol more like Ohio, he needs to wins those
Anddd futures back green 😂😫
It might be like last time where it dumps insanely hard at open and then ends on a rally lol
Kerry was taller he lost to bush
Crayola
Might beat harambe
Check again
Why does google have IL blue won? Nothing has been reported
Biden's voters will be working at the bank that repos your rented rawries.

edit: but nobody challenged last time so i guess it's not a true comparison

Imagine thinking Texas will be blue lmao

Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania all opened blue.
I think market is pricing in disputed results
Oh no. I accidentally held. 

Lol no one with any reasonable amount of equity in the market has these ideas. 

Oh, lemme just pull out 500k tomorrow and owe 30% taxes on it just so I can reinvest and yolo it all tomorrow.

What’s your broker?
So glad I sold as much as I could into strength today. Today’s pump was an incredible gift for my margin.
Texas is definitely ending red
Jeff bezos wont care who wins. He will pay 0 tax either way 😂 XD
We are in a simulation, or a giant MEME I dunno
What makes you say that because the literal votes say it’s close
Personally I’m a long time NIO investor and very bullish with the company. Here’s why:

It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can’t manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It’s a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It’s impressive offering different concepts than Tesla’s market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don’t have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here’s a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw
Trump is associated with less stimulus and stronger dollar. Biden is the opposite.
Explain
F-ck him, p.o.s. get hit by a bus.
TASTY
It looks this way now because they count absentee ballots first (more pro Biden). After that they go through in person votes (more pro Trump)
Cuz I have calls in Quest Diagnostics and Trump hates covid testing.
Rona mishandling, trade war, shitting on trade partners
He got the most votes.

GG Florida. Trump up 100k - Panhandle still to come in
I think there’s some sort of election but I’m not sure I’m just as clueless as you
thats the spirit man
I stand corrected.  My bad.  Biden 2020
Yea almost 100k up
Yeah, I think so.
People claiming if trump wins we gonna get a fat green day
VXX?

[removed]
wait if market pricing in blue? why we still red... I want to speak with the manager!
20. Collected 4.08 per on Monday, worth 4.82 per EOD today. Usually play the bull side of things but the premium was too good and it seemed like a sure thing. We’ll see
Does Biden actually feel any kind of affinity towards Scranton? I moved from PA to OH when I was 10 and don’t consider myself as being from PA
for the record, I just bought puts. 🐻🌈
They're trying to figure out what's a ballot and what's a hanging Chad bruh.
I know but hahaha shits funny
I don't think anyone really knows.

I am pretty sure now that kanye is gonna lose florida
Be nice man
Because it’s looking closer than we all thought.
How long does it take to count after polling closes? Are they counting manually
That’s the spirit
Probably not, but it may be the closest it's been since the 1975 election when it was last blue.
Because they shouldn't have been up to begin with.

Literally just Dallas reporting so far
HOWDY Y'ALL
Spreads are the way.
Weird, right?
ngl that would be a cash cow stock
There are really only a few states really in play every 4 years. Those states are traditionally Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, etc. 

Many of the states are solid red or blue.  For instance - you can automatically count the entire West Coast for Biden before a single vote is counted just like you can count parts of the Midwest and South for Trump.
Mcconnell coming back
I tried. It was boring af
Trump won Florida imo he is pulling ahead by 50k
Ohio is the state to watch here

This is going to be tight w/ 🥭 winning FL...

You still have to imagine them doing it. We've had nightly examples of Biden's crew torching places all over the country, but OP still seems to think that it's Trumpsters going to riot.

As a Texan... I wouldn't be so sure.  If Biden wins it's going to get fucking crazy here.  Everywhere is going to be getting looted.
It's looking good for Trump in Florida. Almost 90% of the vote is in and typically red counties haven't been counted yet.
LET IT BURN LMAO

Yo is libtard still a word people use
You for real?
i think biden will win, so my aapl calls are fucked
Too early to pound the chest, it's usually like this deep south red / northeast blue lol unless it's 2016 where it was over quickly x.x
Nah Biden won’t win now
Cringe copy paste
I also voted a few times online, just to be sure.
Illinois called for Biden, 0% reporting.

What the fuck?

Id upload the picture but I'm sure others have it.
More than 1% is high for Florida. He won with 1.2% in 2016.
Google homie
**VOTE FOR PEDRO**

Guuuuh
Trump*
Down to -110.  The silent Trump voter is real
I may piss myself laughing at the irony if Biden somehow loses the popular vote but wins the electoral college ahahahaha what a fucking plot twist that would be
FL looks clear for mango now. Gonna come down to PA I think
Florida is going to trump pan handle still to be counted.
Not as close as it was earlier.

They can pretty much say there aren't enough votes left for the other to win.

Cant give a real answer if youre retarded
🤫 we can’t jinx this
Assumption from past results. Some states haven’t voted for another party since the 80’s
You don't want my advice. But maybe up 21% from today. (7% nasdaq drop)
Long story short, they do lots of polling over time and look at historic vote patterns and are pretty good at guessing that some states are gonna lock for that candidate.  Like Oklahoma... it's going to Trump, it was a lock the second google started reporting it.
Take a shot for every vote that's counted tonight
Stop texting and driving it's fucking selfish and stupid
nio day, nio me my dude
They'll have to talk about... news again... eww
why are futures tanking?
What's the play if there's an upset in the House, and the Dems lose control?
lmao true
Dude i fucking typed my order out and by the time i was done it fucking shot up
Literally only 2 counties have reported. It's SUPER early.
Can i borrow 30k?
Give it a few
No fucking way
VIX futures and UVXY green! Fucking finally!
Yes, some states have such a heavily partisan lean they can safely be called without all the votes in. For example: I can safely call the state of California for Biden, even though no votes have been reported.
This is the way
Texans gonna have lynch mobs looking for Biden signs if it goes blue
Being President would be so surreal
85 - 55 biden right now, says pbs newshour
Fucking texanians betrayed us
This may be a retarded question but does puerto rico get to vote in the election?
I can’t wait for the mango to aggressively claim an early victory and crash futures tonight 🤣🤣

What downfall? It’s literally 35 dollars down from 460. It’s doing great
Here. Only a handful of times did March go +2% to -2%.. direction was usually confirmed by midnight. Tonight is just gonna continue to wipsaw based on news
Definitely interested. Please share.
Whats the highest you'll buy at? Im thinking sub-30 is best case scenario and no brainer. But realistically i think 32 will be the dip.
Awaken almighty VIX. Your time has come
Yes sir!
Texas about to smack these libtards to the curb. FINISH THEM
Bet so I’ll root for 🥭 tonight.
GREEN OUT (if senate is also red)
Statistical forecasting.  It’s just an assumption based on that news networks analysis or historical and statistical factors.  In 2016 (and 2000) they had to change their projection/announcement because they called it too early.

Plus/minus 20% is just regular investing this year. Not that crazy. This doesn't belong here.
Its much tighter than everyone thought it would be. Trump is very much alive. Which means there is a greater chance of contested results and delayed stimulus (specially if dems get the house and trump wins)
Better than my nkla puts

Texas has entered the chat
This is exciting just reading the comments lol

Idk who was priced in today, but I sure hope they win so we get more days like today

Btw was funny everyone crying about VIX dead, and now it ain’t dead lol
Bears r fuk! 😂
LOL 2016 FUCKING SO OBVIOUS. Libs in shambles
Can someone explain why is says states are won even though it's not at 100% vote.

Brit here
Senate seats 7-4 to the dems so far for those watching for stimulus impacts.
Right in Florida for puts I would guess. Which it is right now. May have an Al Gore type recount.
Looking like biden win was priced in, puts if trump pulls ahead
With you brother!
A rollercoaster would be the best way to describe it
where were you in march
Trump train rise up
too many "too close to call" 

Odds of contested election goes up.. Hello VIX!
Does senate switch seats in January too?
LMAO THESE PRICW SWINGS PLEASE STOP
Guys guys guys. DC went got Biden. This is groundbreaking
[deleted]
If Texas is blue I’ll cry laughing an my calls too
Mooning!
Just wait
certainty vs uncertainty
What's up with the fucken texans this year?
are we gonna see red or green tomorrow if trump preliminarily wins tonight?
dont get hopes up too high just yet
No clue but I got options expiring on 11/6 at 35C not sure if I want to sell the option or just execute them and buy the shares
**IT'S OKAY FUTURES. JUST STOP WHINING AND POINT TO WHERE HE TOUCHED YOU SO I CAN MAKE IT BETTER. NOW STOP FUCKING DUMPING FFS.**
Stay mad as their margins go above 40% buddy.
Wtf is about to happen jesus christ

A truly great compromise
Opposite look at the results
WHAT THE FUCK
Lol futures will be fun to watch tonight
Trump is .02% ahead in FL
Lefties stroking it to TX when basically only Dallas has reported lol
Only 10% counted, this means nothing for now
Wrong
god dammit i should have kept my puts huh
Nasdaq futures holding up way better than the rest. It was just a rotation back into tech all along. Election is just noise.
They did but the market opened up the next day
Have faith. I rebought in at 338p 11/18 today. 
SPY 300-320 hopefully
With the counts this close, mail in counting will give it to Biden in the coming days. So maybe don't act like it was a forgone conclusion.
Facts
I’d say call your mom and put in a good word for me
0% chance he concedes if he loses tn too
Oh fuck here we go.  So many trump signs here
DOW FUTURES JUST WENT DOWN, RED DAY TOMORROWWWWW
Florida tighter than a nun’s butthole. Yeah, this is gonna be contested.
Enjoying your lives while anticipating a face ripping red day 😜🤡🤡 chirp
lets not celebrate too early
S*** sinks to the bottom of the toilette

Tonight may be the craziest Futes showing in years

Spy is tanking right now retard sell tomorrow
Trump = lowest black unemployment in history.....

This dog correctly predicted a green day last night. We red tomorrow bois.
Big red tmrw, mango not conceding tight loss
Yeah buy all nio shares and hang on for 5 years.
limit down in pre-market and finished up 1%
this all started 15 mins ago when the wire about mitch mcconnel winning re-election came out.

its his fault
They "release" more votes all through the night tn, put that tin foil hat away for a minute
I went to take a shower and didn’t jerk off for the first time just so the market can tank. What do u know worked like a charm
Poll going strong. 670 votes polled. No intimidation and voter suppression please.

Here is the poll for 🐄 vs 🐻 . Pleas submit your votes.

Election might go to overtime, big investors going cash gang
Flo Rida voted Trump
Happy for you!  Good luck on your interview!
[deleted]
Yes. That 1 put will ruin you.
do people at the age 20 watch TV at all?
If Florida barely flips to Biden and becomes crucial you will be fine cause Trump will fight that to the death
VIX is not updating right now because SPX options are not trading...../VX futures are up.
Lmao I wish I had monies to give you gold, but jere's my janky-ass award🥇
🕺🕺🕺
No kidding.
That’s if the margin of win is enough. If it’s super close to 50/50 it could take days.
Lol what the hell caused that 1% red dildo?
He invested in himself.
Wtf is going on with Ohio?
Lmao you fucking idiots
Your telling me, I went from +8k to down 6k in a matter of minutes. 

Crazy ride.
Spy just dropped to 333 after hours in the last couple mins of the day - you’re good
Futures recovering. I’m not going to watch these until tonight.
massachusetts is called already with 0% reported.  or perhaps nobody voted like 0 citizens in the entire state exercised their right to vote? its possible
Its a joke and a saying in this autistic hangout. You new here?
Stocks only go up
Every Biden win notification on Twitter leads to some green candles  
  
Every Trump win notification on Twitter leads to some red candles  
  
Hmmmmm
Red sweep is bull city USA bro
Cnn says a lot of shit.  Don't listen to the talking heads on any channel.
Mango might win
Calls it is.
Just looked at futures for the first time since 6:30. What happened?
Odd shark
It’s really about to be a landslide
If trump 🎺 wins I'll suck everyone's dick for free
Trump was the president all the while and the second stim still didn’t take place so why do you think that’s the case lmao
Will Joe be as drunk as Hillary when he loses?
Biden leading 85-55
How wild would it be if Biden wins the electoral college but loses the popular vote? How many red tears will there be?
Hog Fucker
[deleted]
Where is JOJO part 6???
Are you paying attention to anything going on in this market? Market has been dropping Everytime it looks like Trump might win and going up the more it looks like Biden is doing well
Any correlation y’all are seeing between news and futures? What should I be rooting for if I have calls vs puts.
[removed]
Nasdaq futures holding up very well. It’s just your 3 day rotation back into tech, masked by an election.
They limited down and then back to limit up
Pajama boys riding huge swings tonight

It expires.

Election is on, i'll follow up tomorrow
TEXAS ABOUT TO SHAKE THE WORLD
Imagine spending 47 years doing less than nothing
What happened to nio?
now I am glad I got puts
In a stunning turn of events, HOWIE HAWKINS with the election lead!
Mojo Jojorgensen
Yeah this
So, puts? Or calls, since you “left”?
If you're of a certain age, any mention of North Carolina immediately triggers this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHnA94-hTC8
I dont understand how people honestly thought Trump was losing FL. He has to win FL to even have a chance, if he loses FL the election is basically over at that point. And FL being this close is not a good sign for Trump either, look at the other states. On another note, watching futures is hilarious right now.
My futures position is bouncing between being up $1000 and being down $300 in a matter of seconds. I've been preparing for this all year and I still wasn't ready.
Crowder!
Wait why did futures crash?
Was going to try buying UVXY at 17.69; now I regret waiting...
No, it's that they don't want the race to be close. Or to not have a clean sweep of blue.
[deleted]
I bought so many puts today! Am I gonna be rich?
Hey kiddo . We're more mature the mom jokes. This subreddit is a place of class. See the mom fucking is a no no. But your slutty wife is fair game
How many of you voted twice? One by mail and once in person?
Eerily similar
Didnt futures tank 2% in 2016 election? Then went full on green dildo for a month
My poor NIO
That’s balls sir
My puts agree
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response was there anything that could even be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul!
Mail in ballots will come in and save the day

GA flipped to blue again

How many and how much premium?
Nooooo whyyyy
why is everyone so hung up on the floorida city, isnt there like 60 other ones, just go win one of those instead, florida sounds lame either way

Wow gold just fell off a cliff

So the market doesnt want biden to win....rip
Nytimes has trump win in Florida at 95% 

This increases likelihood of contested and very tight race

Hence, spy dumping

Cash gang is still probably the play if you can't handle the swings.
you know i think futs are down because Mitch Mc. Turltle got re-elected
I can’t wait
When I worked there I used to sneak bags of chicken sandwich patties out with the garbage. Each bag had easily 50-60 patties. Massive internal corruption, Wouldn’t touch
He is wrong.  1 contract represents 100 shares.  You are paying a premium for a reduced price on the stock.  This way it's far cheaper to own 100 shares of stock temporarily, than it usually is to outright purchase 100 shares.
Are you talking about a Wendy’s union? :)
metals with a dump and pump
Trumps going to win Florida panhandle is gonna do it
That stock blows

Also: the Kioxia IPO has been delayed. Not a comp I would want.

Do you think she gonna bang dudes for money ? She might have a bigger portfolio than most of us already that too in safe stocks and bonds
It's higher.
Trump winning florida means we probably won't know President until late this week at the earliest. Penn gonna take a while. Oof
Nice dude thanks for your insights. I like the play
SPY Oooof at 7:59
>wait, futures drop on biden lead AND trump lead? wtf

BRO ITS UNRELATED WITH FINANCE GOD DAMN U AUTISTS
yea biden win priced in
Imagine pretending you know whats going to happen tomorrow. Smoke a joint and chill out, this ride’s just getting started
Man I'm bagholding from the TOP
CNN saying lots of Biden votes left in Tallahassee
SQQQ calls bby
On election night, most people are rooting for red or blue, but on WSB, it's all about red vs. green!

Sounds like the guy who celebrates his weekly SPY options during AH movements, only to get slaughter at opening bell.

VIX, the perfect conditions are here, here to set you free...

Only once every hundred years can an investor experience this kind of volatility...

Please pass stimulus immediately after election

Did it happen in 2008
Whos idea was this fuckin nerd on rogan, I'm just waiting for Alex Jones to show up on another podcast
LMFAO no votes red Alabama 😂😂
SPY is making me hard rn
When will we know the result?
Trading futures is like playing *professional* football in Canada. Get out of my face with that knock off Western Family shit
I just realized that I'm going to find out the next president here first. That is terrifying and exciting...
which candidate will return to monke
Literally no bullish outcome to the election
man I'm so glad I only have a minimal position right now... I would be freaking out otherwise

Wish our elections were run like Ergodan or Saddam in the 90s
Theta gang wins. Bulls and bears rekt
Imagine believing polls
Futures selling off hard, my VXX calls looking good so far for tomorrow...

[Who did you vote for?](https://fast-poll.com/poll/3e2fc4bc)
Imagine driving all the way to the pill station, and you’re about to cast your vote, but you pull out your phone and see that Biden is winning with <1% of votes counted and you throw in the towel and drive home
Probably the actual outcome too
Futures go red for 10 minutes and you say this lol. Green by open!
Guys don't freak out like those on r/ politics are doing rn...

We just had a big bounce and a normal red day isn't off the table at this point. This isn't crash, and looks like we getting clear winner now...
Idgi why does it show SC voted already when only 3% of votes are in? Same w/ VA and mango has the lead by a longshot there but they voted blue. Help me understand
wait, futures drop on biden lead AND trump lead? wtf
FL goes red
These dumps and pumps don’t mean anything until we know who wins. Can be erased either side
What's up with Vermont?!? Start recounting Daddy Trump...
Bulls got played for fucking fools the last 2 days lol
Omg I might actually save my spy puts ?! Holy fuck
Wrote naked SPY 335 calls expiring tomorrow. Praying the rug keeps getting pulled
But him winning Florida and Texas is a win for sure so it’s over already basically
Nioooooooooooo fuk
I paper handed some of my puts ngl

Lambo is for poor.
People actually thought trumps reign was over 😂
Where did all the bulls go?
Just look at FL, shit just flopped back and forth over the last hour.

R-4.844 vs D-4.826
Holy shit just been reading thru /r/politics and if mango wins the meltdown over there is going to be fucking insane
Shit we are at about a 500 point swing in the Dow.
Imagine getting caught longing ES at 339 :/ 

*RIP in peace*
Oh my god we are gonna limit down
So trump doing well but futures dropping... lol
Red map, red futures? 



Hmmm
Race got closer
Looks like my VXX calls aren’t so fucked.

FUTURE BOYS WANT BIDEN LOL
Fake red Georgia I sleep 😴🥱🥱🥱

Red waves everyyyywhere
 FLORDIA RED
Damn! Glad I’m all cash tonight! 

Not ready for this rollercoaster
So this is what a face ripper looks like?
I really sold my puts today. Fuck me
Fuck the news media. Watch the legit tracker, go to Google and type in "election tracker"
If 🥭 wins the popular vote and 😴 wins the electoral college I will cum

 this is fun, we should have presidential elections more often

Suburban women please like me.
Fuck u bitch ass. Trump 2020 butch
So half the people in here saying trump winning is extremely unlikely and other half are saying there’s no chance Trump can lose at this point... idk what to believe anymore

I didn’t want trump to win Florida

Faux South
This is some wild ride jesus christ man. 

One minute my puts are worthless next minute I'm pre-ordering a lambo.

This election stock discord retarded lmao
 🤡
nah dude, there is prolly like a good portion of people here with NIO calls..
She may like that
She can’t make up her mind
Florida going to trump increases likelihood of contested election which is bearish

Crash Incoming
Congrats!
Pls die futures I need something tonight
Someone doesn’t want to hold futures any longer

This sub is loaded, with pussy farts

They’ll cry when mango, rules the land

They say jerking off, is fucking your hand
There will be an anonymous every where who leaks.
I am drinking mango white claws tonight so it’s probably not looking good for bidet.
Futures have been banished to the shadow realm
Says he won 68% of the vote... You on crack rocks m'boy?
Talk about a reversal
Markets don’t like uncertainty, guess bulls forgot last election when the Dow ranked 900 points
Ah. Classic.
Futures dropping off trump winning South Carolina?
Only way you can control the narrative and hope red voters give up at the poll and go home.
futures dont come like this every night...
Trump now leading FL
NC, GA and FL all favoring Trump now per Bloomberg
vix is named volatility index, but really it's a measure of fear. 

in short vix is just a bear indicator.
Once the Republicans get off work it will start to swing red
Dont understand why dems dont think this will happen. Every republican including trump have said this and pelosi wouldn't be able to push back
VIX with the face ripping rally

Trump is up in Florida loool
Florida just flipped
I’ve seen this before. Green in 30 seconds.

wow wow wow... dear lord how the fuck did we blow our lead.... fuck sakes
I smell vote fuckery in FL. Watch all the lawyers fly down there tomorrow.
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP DUMP
Turnout isn't that important this election no ? since so many people voted early/via mail etc..
Lol bulls fucked.

Chloroform to make her pass out and smash till my dick collapse
I'm just looking forward to a Biden win so I can see all the annoying ass die-hard Trumpers have a fit when the country rejects their messiah for his second term.
Hope u guys realize the closer this race is to trump winning the more we will dump. The markets want Biden to win lmao
Tendies disappearing on spy calls
We were up 1% now we'll pump down 1%, and we'll open flat, balance
So trump is slightly winning is the memo im hearing
Im not british, fuck britain. As a spaniard i love America
Or loses. Stimmy still gets passed

Trump gonna win! Futures dropping cause market had priced in Biden win! LOL
It's not really that. It's that it will be close, and he won't concede.

Imagine thinking Trump is good for markets
*Bruce Buffer voice* It is all over!
This Mike Pence dude looks like he's straight out of a political movie lol
This isn't futes final form
Drill team 6 has arrived
What happened in 2000? Do I have to get my Brooks Brothers suit back on and go protest against some Chads?
What does that have to do with anything. Wendy’s is a franchise and it falls on the cooperation which owns the property to cover the cost. Still just angry single white laborers screaming on the top of their lungs for a man who only takes from them.
"we are projecting Biden is the winner"... with 1% of the vote in. WTF
Nah Trump will pull ahead panhandle votes are coming in
No
Hell I don't know, just wishful thinking I guess!
lol agreed
Hope so
In 2 minutes, another big boy will come to the stage. Are you not entertained?!
🏳️‍🌈🐻
Good
Exactly, thank you! I've been saying this all fucking week, no one wanted to listen. This was going to be contested all along. No way Trump would leave quietly, and no way a blue sweep would be that easy.
Florida about to flip
4.785 vs 4.760, YOU SLOW.

Uhhh, looks like Trump might overtake Biden. Gap keeps shrinking and the swampers haven't reported in yet.
This is like when ppl thought Conor McGregor had a chance against Mayweather, then where surprised when it didn’t go that way
[deleted]
I still don't understand why people thing COVID is a hoax. They made it entirely political.
Maybe trump winning isn’t good for the market 🥵
[deleted]
That’s probably a good start
Oh, I'm not saying it's new news.

But I mean, WV was called with 30k votes.

Can't someone do the math and let us know which counties need to vote and who can just stay the fuck home?

3-4% of the vote was needed... So why the fuck do we all vote? It's obvious SO MANY counties have worthless votes.
within .4% brother, holdfast
I did write in my dog's name for president; same amount of mental ram, even though my dog is dead 😂
I think it's *extremely* unlikely, but if Trump wins then 2020 will truly be one for the record books.

Famous years in history: 0, 1492, 1776, 2020
CNN and MSNBC only show counties where blue is on top.
Can someone explain why they don't process mail in ballots before election day. Is it because it makes too much sense?
The stock market is definitely not liking it lol
As long as she can sit still and watch Frozen on repeat easy mode.
Imagine thinking higher corporate taxes is bullish for the market
Look at a map and visualize what a pan handle would look like

God I’d honestly deserve it for being such a cuck and posting here.

As soon as trump wins he's gonna push stimulus.
im starting to think futures dont like how well mango is doing lol
Think it means they voted 3rd party
Boeing
Holy shit Biden had 15,000 turn out in a heavy democratic part of Georgia that Biden needs to win. Trump might win this if it shows the state of his enthusiasm
they are open, wanna buy amazon right now?

I like to think the under taker as institutions. Big, established and intimidatingly powerful. 

While baptista as retail investors ( the autist) mad crazy plays. Odds are will fail horribly. Small. Not powerful. But when that 619 options doesn't break his own neck and lands the flashy payout amazing
Futures traders getting rich right now.
Where were you when a Florida tie (or close to it) murdered the bull market?
Twitter to gap down tomorrow?
Really nice, stonks bring me money. Im from spain and the uk is honestly shitty, shit weather, shit food and obviously shit stocks. In the future I'll move to America and live the american dream.
I'm showing .4+ for Biden with Trump gaining. Just Google it they've got a tool for election results by district and state
Undertaker gif
Start(its)up
Good, I hope all the PJ traders lose their ass’ for that bullshit they pulled last night!
#VIX is green!
Trump winning FL creates uncertainty about overall winner. If Biden wins FL the math for Trump to be reelected is almost impossible
Where you getting your numbers???
Fuck Florida how bout daaat
Don't say you're comfortable holding a stock for 5 years when you literally have a stop loss at 15%. That's fucking retarded.
Mail in ballots in Florida could decide this
also i'm fairly sure bloomberg probably has an API and is just scraping data from either AP or Google, but presenting it with a better UI.
49.5 to 49.5 in Florida
Gonna laugh if they pull a "paper trading contest" and ban every retard in this thread.
Fuck trump and fuck u
Lmao 2,000 votes separating the candidates with almost 10 million votes in.


Florida is straight retarded. And I can say that with confidence because I was born and raised there, and I'm retarded af.
Early take in FL: Biden’s lead in Dade and other Latino counties are not as big as hoped. Some criticized that Biden didnt do enough to reach out to Miami area Latinos, who are more conservative than Latinos in other parts of the country. Trump also associated Biden with socialism. Latinos in Miami fled from socialist countries like Cuba and hate that

Biden did awful in Miami, all Latino vote went to Trump and that’s going to cost him the state
Ya... People who complain markets aren't open... You have futures... If you make this complaint you're a person who doesn't trade and should just stop pretending you follow stocks.
Imagine if ballots were tradable and had options, futures and etfs

Yup, I know plenty of Cubans and Venezuelans down there. Sad to see the “I got mine, fuck you” mentality though because republicans want nothing to do with immigrants. Except when it comes to votes.

Biden won VT by electoral votes but loses popular vote. Your vote does not count

Alright boys, time to gauge the collective wisdom of WSB. As usual, this will be a great indicator of what to expect in the market for the coming months.

Place your bets! Cheers boys 🍻 

UPDATE: looks like Biden is still leading the WSB poll so far, WSB clearly leading blue. 🗳 🇺🇸

The fuck is going with spy and why
😂😂😂
Bears out of the hideeee
FL RED ?
That's because Dems just run up the score in California and New York.  The whole point of the electoral college is to prevent a few large cities from controlling the entire country.
No, it's just that people are seeing this election may be closer than originally thought. And that spells uncertainty = whipsaw futures
Yep. Not sure how that gets changed though I’m sure dems want to try
season finale of the united states of america is on tonight on FOX
I think the NV news made this dump
All we need are more lockdowns.
Cant wait for the "if you voted for trump go ahead and remove me as a friend" posts tomorrow. Too predictable wish the stocks were that easy to call.
yay I got a new job finally ! No more unemployment and corona BS . Had a great job before getting laid off in March due to corona shut down here in CA. now I feel like I’m back on my game again . Interview is this Friday . Should be cake 🍰! So excited 😃
It’s a Biden blowout
Where do you see the live map

They hate democrats because of bay of pigs and they hate socialism because of Castro (Democrat = socialism)

why futures died
Im canadin so idk about us election too much
I'll riot if they take Texas and I didn't vote.  Stocks go up with riots.

Panhandle has like 500k+ voters
Wrong. I'm holding the perfect combination of calls and puts to ensure that I'll lose money regardless what happens.
Where are you getting your numbers?
Damn WSB hates mango
I literally need a -3% day to close break even :D

kinda weird to call your pimp a boss

Ha-haaa! Well done, sir!
this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard
Pray4puts
Where did you find that information? I haven't seen anything about that.
This is crazy, less than 50k vote difference between them right now in Florida
#Calculated Risks
i expect mass rioting either way
What's with /u/mmwtgs , is that your burner account? Posted the same shit.

Also your numbers are like 15 minutes behind. It's .6% Biden with 90-99%.
Virginia is called for Biden already by the ap with almost 60% voting for Trump.

Why do we do electoral College?

WV for Trump with 45% trump and 30k reporting.... Like what? If you're in certain counties just tell us our votes don't matter so we don't waste our time.
[deleted]
worst and most likely, it'll be obama v mitch .
nothing gets done
Yeah, fuxk you
Not according to Bloomberg.
How the fuck is this shit always so close? With 4.5M each, there’s a 5k difference in votes in Florida rn
[deleted]
Probably not, tho I expect small one or two events events from nutjobs. Right has more guns but they're much more docile
go to sleep we probably won't even know in 6-8 hours.
Trumps gonna take Florida
Currently a tie in Florida with only 19% of votes being left.... this is fucking blueballing me
Somethings happened in the last 15 mins to strengthen the USD massively
The fuck is carrows
big fukkin dump on /es
Fuck this guy got balls
riddled with gay ass bears for a week, I did
Hahahaha guys... stop fucking dancing today is gonna be the wildest day, pure gambles

And every other day but especially election days
I’d trust this dude with my daughter
BIDEN TOAST IN FLORIDA, PANHANDLE REGION STILL NEEDS TO BE COUNTED
Big if true.
Was about to say
>Florida is going to be challenged in the courts 100%

hanging chads baby
He and fox had a falling out months ago. He couldnt stand the political theatre and fake journalism of the tucker carlson vs of reporting.
Ber=Doomer.Bul=Bloomer.
Latinos in general align with Republican values, the only thing they really differ on is immigration. If Republicans realized this, they would win over a large percentage of Latino’s

You are right. Election is rigged!!!
Meet me behind the dumpster tomorrow at 930am... I'll share some "insider" information.

HOLY WHEN DID TRUMP TAKE VIRGINIA BACK???
Post your loss porn when the time comes
Yh, no way he wins the popular vote if he lost it to Hillary.
What a fucking reversal. Probably gonna be like this all night tbh
[deleted]
Wallstreetraider is lit
Yeah we need this election to be contested if we want big red
Can you manage my finances
Yep, that would be very bad for stimulus talks
thnx
They’re about to go up 50% if Biden wins. Sell everything before Inauguration Day if that’s the case
NYT called Florida for Trump
Yeah I watched the great Hack on Netflix and was certain of this outcome when I put the bet on
Weed stocks down with Biden win
Depends on the Senate. Mark Kelly loses in AZ we might go red.
I live here and it would blow your mind how much of the non white vote Trump is getting here... Cubans especially.
If you can call states this early... Our votes don't fucking matter for so many states lol.
[deleted]
voting hopes going well
Damn, I looked away from futs for 5 minutes

Fuck Yes, bring it on
If house and senate split we probably aren't getting stimulus for awhile
Oh...sorry...NOW the British care about our open elections???
Because it’s almost 8pm
I can almost guarantee either Trump or Biden wins.
Enough will turn - I’m sure plenty of reds are desperate for a chance to ditch Trump - he’s a sinking ship whether he’s re-elected or not.
I got puts on the Don
I'm not sure... Things reverse without warning. But I did sell puts today. I wouldn't mind owning long term
Florida Biden 49.6 to 49.5
Why futures moon
I really hope I bought enough on both sides to come out on top tomorrow
It’s like if Biden got elected on March 23rd of this year
WTF MY COINS
Wtf are you talking about...  no one has called Florida.

Biden doesn’t need either. But if he won either it would be game over

Do you expect a dip coming up this week? Or should we buy at 35.

Im contemplating on buying ASAP vs waiting a few days and waiting for a dip. But i fear it could rise to 38-40
Nah
The one near me closed for two weeks because of “plumbing issues“   Puts on Dave
Yerp
If this doesn’t come down to the military blasting Trump out of the White House in January then I want out of this simulation.
seriously wonder if there will be mass rioting if dems win this time
Technical difficulties
Biden leads by 0.1% in FL with 80% counted votes
100%
He takes his time before selecting, evaluating all the choices. Solid DD.
Florida is going to be challenged in the courts 100%
Eh you wait until a few hours then see how crazy futures are swinging.
Historically, the best outcome for markets is republican president with replubilican congress. I dont have a horse in the race, but if you just want markets to go up, republican sweep is the statistically best outcome
The popular vote?  By a 10% margin?  Almost completely.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grindrapp.android
Hoping it does.
Aren't you in lock down?
Retarded, there's no way he takes a +5% pop vote lead, FFS even Hillary beat his ass.
Even my shitty E*TRADE account has futures.
Cool
Who do I want to win so that we get a fat red day?

My opinion though, is that we’ll get a fat red day if there is no winner announced even by open tomrorow (aka too close to call or no one concedes or generally fuckkery)
georgia close as FUK
LETS GO TRUMP!! KICK SOME ASS!!
What do you think about Americans
My taxes were changed 0% with Trump so I don’t know what all the hype is about
Don’t forget the hookers
Yes, this is true. And if you want a cherry on top, is Biden winning, but that it's so close Trump calls fraud and challenges his victory. All hell breaks loose then.
Some constitutional something
This shit is about to end in a tie isn't it.
We will get the final results by Christmas if it closes below 1%
Whoever is playing ES and NQ, I salute your balls of steel.  
  
Not for the faint hearted.
its a big let down that Alex the mother fucking Jones is not on Joe Rogan rn. Spotify really got Rogan by his balls.
You're missing the point. A close FL win for Trump means he probably loses the even tougher states. Trump needs to crush in FL.
Keep going...
LETS FUCKING GO 🥭
FLORIDA TIGHTER THAN YOUR MOTHERS PANINI MAKER
Unrelated to election, but got a completely unexpected 8K raise today at 4:45pm and the only thing I could think was “thank god my boss didn’t tell me this an hour ago or I probably would’ve bet it all on this election”
“What losses puts/calls!?! Pshhh, my puts/calls printed bigly. It’s like I didn’t even bet on the otherside.”

-Ideally me tomorrow.
can someone tell me how joe biden is winning virginia right now? it says biden has less votes than trump
Fuck Florida

Can the South just secede from the US again, all they do is just freeload off of blue state tax revenue anyway
They’d need 2/3 of the senate to remove
Sir, this is not Wendy's
Futes don't seem to like it
Florida's gonna to be tighter than someone tipping on the early bird special at Carrows...
If you are holding calls you deserve a medal, honestly. Let's not act like we know what the fuck is gonna happen, but holy shit it's a big dick move to have calls right now.
A contested election..
If Trump had shot out another stimulus check real quick he would have had a much better shot at winning. Neck and neck right now.
Impeachment hearing = Good for 🌈🐻
LOL.  
Why Trump is so concerned on processing of  mail-in ballots ? Aren't they valid votes?

There’s these things called resistance and support
GA red
We named *the dog* Indiana
And youll pay it back in taxes within a year.
If we do get red action, sell your puts and take profit.

Market went red intraday when trump won as the idiots sold, and then went green. 

Samething will happen no matter who wins. 

Haters will sell, then it will turn green as rational people recognize business always prevails.
What makes a professional gambler... you win more than lose?

Yo if the senate and the house go blue trumps gonna get fuckin impeached.
I think this is way more likely than some crazy movement personally
Doesn't matter. A narrow win in Florida means Trump will probably lose the midwest battleground. He needed to crush in Florida by 200k, not eek out a 15k win.
It will die, just like my calls
The cities have too much power over everyone's lives as it is. Thank the founders for the electoral system man

I literally can’t find any information on Biden planning to remove the 12K standard deduction. Where do you see this? And nowhere do i see that your total income tax deduction is limited to 27% of what you can put into your 401K. As I said, you are conflating two unrelated things.

You should be against the electoral college, in fact, the whole first-past-the-post voting system is should be removed.
Still think Don presidency means we go up? Futures selling off with him not getting buried

But we’re throwing money at something doesn’t matter, waste of time and money
racist folks like other racist folks
I’ll donate 10% of my profits (if j break even) to whatever charity you want if true
Is sad but can one not be hopeful?!
LOL he's gonna win isn't he
If you want that bet id wait until biden loses Florida. Probably get better odds.
Does futures want trump winning Florida or Biden? I’m confused asf
it's a valid answer for either of them but biden if you must know
Biden
No shit he campaigned as being from Ohio, they jerk off to anyone even remotely from there
Joe leads FL by 150,000 votes, but we have nothing but rural counties left, this will be close.

We bull again bois
Praying for a contested election for you and me both.

Dang, stimmy infatuated market don’t like this Florida news
Futures wylin out
Florida is maybe Biden’s wow. That’s game over for trump if happens.
No they don't...and they think a "big switch" happened where the racist Dems switched to the Republicans...and that never happened.

The left rewrote history and people used to buy it but SOME are waking up.
futes just crashed

it's over for bul
Take a look at the stock market from 2009-2016 then tell me why I shouldn’t want biden to win...

Lol why are futures red after being bullish as fuck? Did they suddenly remember there’s an election? Fuck these markets man. Stupid.
lmao you're commenting and don't know how things work
Given the current count in FL, I'm calling the whole race for Biden. Trump needed to outperform there to signal momentum in much tougher states.

This could be a bloodbath.

Edit: I did not mean Biden wins FL. I mean Biden wins the white house.
i am very glad i decided to sit tonight out because nothing about what i just saw could be remotely close to being considered normal or reasonable

Why the fucking hell futures dumped
Blue wave destroys country? What? 

Blue wave means larger than expected stimulus because the Dems want to spend more. Lockdowns wont have any effect until they actually start happening.
What in the devil's dick
Panhandle also has counties with like 5k votes, shits not gonna matter within the next 10 minutes once the nicer areas of Miami/PalmBeach wrap up.
Lmao
It's actually green on my chart bro

Those are rookie numbers.
Its tough buddy. I am pretty old now so I have been working and investing the greater part of my adult life.  The best advice I can give is to keep buying broad based indices over time.  Buy more aggressively when the market falls more than 7%.   It is boring as hell but 20 years later you have a good chunk of money.

99% of my investing is boring as hell and has allowed me to get to my goal of retiring at 55.  

Good Luck

The panhandle is basically Alabama and Biden is trailing Hillary with Hispanics.
I've been considering JD as well but I don't know very much about the company and on paper it's not as appealing as BABA. 1/8 the market cap with 6x the P/E ratio which makes me more confident in BABA; especially with Ant Group IPO on the way (but who knows when that'll happen now)
Is this true?

Florida is surprising me, buncha pussies voting blue like wtf do you not like money?
Looks like baba likes Biden
Just like that, futures are flat. Again, don't read into them, they are going to swing wildly all night. Worry about it tomorrow morning at like 7am.

It's kinda nuts that democrats have won the popular vote in 6 out of the last 7 presidential elections. And the one they lost was the second Bush election, which you could argue wouldn't have been possible if Bush didn't win the first time while losing the popular vote, then get re-elected in wartime. 

I'm not necessarily against the electoral college, it's just insane that Republicans have held power for such a large % of time over the past 20 years without ever actually gaining majority support.

Holy shit Ohio lol
keeps going up.. but its still early.  I heard votes in so far are day of voting only so early voting will probably swing it for Biden Biggly
If it hits 23-25 that's a huge win after the run up of late. They have several quarters ahead before the adopters during the last 4-5 months that lead up to this earnings translate to revenue. Their Enterprise focus will pay off long term but acquiring that customer, then setting up new departments, getting them to post Jobs, then hire the talent, then the project to be completed - takes longer than $50 logos on fvvr

Say it with me everyone. “President Powell”. Get used to saying it.
Whipsawing. This was to be expected, they are going to swing a lot on every little voting report. Don't read too much into them right now.
If the election isnt contested bears are fucked
All the little counties that vote trump probably immediately reported 100%. The larger counties that typically vote dem are still voting/tallying
fellow florida man, have faith brother
From VA. The biggest counties in state have not reported. Virginia will be blue, 100%
Not lies

That’s awesome nice worj
If Trump and all the other reds want to minimize the legal ass fucking a blue gov will give them they’re gonna keep the economy on track.

I’m sure they have lobbyists who would be angry if they tanked stuff too - and that lobbyist money is what will help pay their legal fees.

Maybe the Russians will pay them to crash the economy idk - but if blue sweep happens they’ll be afraid to do it.

Not necessarily true anymore because of the shift of other states that are now swing states. But it's still important overall.
I usually just comment bearish sentiments like “don’t forget to buy your puts” so that people on WSB join the bear sentiment and buy puts. We all know the markets do the opposite of what WSB wants. I actually have calls.
Honestly I just want to see the reactions of all of the smug ABC cucks if trump manages to win again lol

Someday we're all going to have those huge touchscreen displays in our homes
I'd be okay with futures mooning if there was a legit reason but I can't think of one.
Well, he theoretically could but the odds wouldn't be in his favor if he lost Florida
[deleted]
Cool post bro
Hope you’re not eating these words tomorrow
CBS won’t say any winners either
Because it has 29 electoral votes.
This is America, we allow Florida to decide all the elections for the thrill, never know what those methy fucks will do
Ylan Moi just does it for me
Oh man. You’re a week late.
I think he's taking the first 3. But weakness w hispanics in Florida makes it likely that of any of those others, he's most likely to lose AZ.
Just got off the phone with my homie in the secret service. He says 🥭 is going to tweet something insane tomorrow. Your puts are safe
Shoutout to the latina voters 😉
Wow that escalated
Not really, I hear whomever takes Florida gets the election.
I don't even wait for results im just going to riot and talk shit to my neighbors plants right now. They are from Brazil , serves them right.
yes from the .gov website ive been reading the past few days. I was so astonished bc that was a Hillary strong hold. But ultimately comes down to today out turn
Idk man why ever watch a sporting event when you can just check the score after it's over?

Miss me
ASL?
I’m a suburban
It’s just breaking news again on nbc literally right now? Says trump gets big boost from Florida
Yes but it would require him winning some states that aren’t traditionally swing states if he loses Florida.
Me. Just waiting a week or two after the election then gonna hop into a shit ton of JD, Nio, and PYPL leaps
This is the way

When mango wins Florida we’re gonna pop and that’s where you short NQ for when joe wins this thing
People love Trump. Just not here on Reddit
Biden winning Florida by 2.5% with 73% votes counted
He will now have access to the finest hair clippings in all the land
Never say never
At home
Calls on Donnie
lol god this is gonna be hilarious
I can feel it too
Holy shit!
I’m feeling nostalgic for a Florida recount
DUAMP IT
Why does Donnie NEED to win Florida? Can’t he win without still
Futures have been up since 6, before any news started rolling in. Has nothing to do with biden
Amazing, would love to do myself
Did they actually? Damn!
Not really no. Unless mango flips a blue state
[deleted]

Theyve done so well for their effort.
The other one sound like a retard tho so there is that.
lmfaoooo this about to be a fucking mess for the right
I’d rather record myself fucking you in the ass
TSLA MOONING
Panhandle of Florida is in a different time zone that’s why they haven’t reported. It’s pretty much as Alabama as you can get without being in Alabama
90% odds Trump takes it right now.
Looks like Trump has Florida judging off betting markets.
Why would you ever want to go to /r/politics it’s a cesspool
I'm from the Future. Florida is too close to call and we don't know the winner until next week
It really comes down to PA.
Replying because I wanna know too lol
Everyone that have calls is voting for Trump
Holy shit. Maybe I will make popcorn
Keep your eyes on the prize
RIP Mango
State leaned blue in recent elections locally and state wide
I’m literally watching it and no one said that.
Orange man will do it again.
Hot takes and shit posts in real time
Gonna see many downvotes I’ll get for saying I’m black and voted Trump in r/politics
For the drama my dude
Biden Win by less than 2%
HONK HONK
Isn’t writing these contracts equally as autistic? Tying up a lot of capital to take $450 from OP
That info is just coming in. And I you look, futures are slipping
is that real i thought google tweaked out
RIP MAGATards if Mango can't hold Florida lmao
*aunties
The birthplace of fascism and communism? They’ve had massive political turmoil one after another.
lol too soon buddy
Man a lot of closet Trumpers coming out of the woodwork here. Maybe I don't see them in the daily threads because they fear they will get downvoted. lol
Probably. With IV crush that shit is gonna be worth 0 even if it goes below 335
Instead of thinking everyone else your age is brainwashed, maybe its you?
[deleted]
No surprises so far. Red states still red, blue states still blue, swing states still swing.
Why does donnie NEED to win Florida? Can’t he still win without
ABC News is busy declaring winners left and right while NBC News is being more conservative.
PA/AZ/NC/FL any one of those
Joe Rogan is doing it live!
Uhh why does it show virginia going blue
Game over for mango
Literally a 50/50
John King has a weird body.
Kanye West for sure

Too early to call. We have another 14 hours for the blackswan to materialize.
Biden really goofed if he underperformed Hillary in Miami
Stephanie Saul in Atlanta
Jordan Fuchs, Georgia’s deputy secretary of state, says Spalding County, which Trump won in ’16, will keep polls open an extra two hours due to an equipment malfunction today.

Very legal, very cool

This is nothing like “last election”
Blue wave, stimulus hopes, recovering from the massive sell off last week, inflation, Fed printing, etc.

Biden winning Georgia by 2% with 5% votes counted
It’s gonna be blue at this rate. All the places where the polling will go late into the night are more population dense and therefore bluer.

Even if Mitch wins his senate race, if congress goes blue then all the GOP who did shady shit are gonna get crucified.
The vix is saying everything is going to be up 10% tmr.
Imagine elections turns out to be buy the rumor sell the news event.  Bulls fucked
And DD we deserve
Stimmy either way

Your post is bad and you should feel bad
if Georgia goes blue

Sounds like he hates life lol
Dont worry Trump will call in the national guard again and end in within three days. civil war or a bitch fit

Just smoke some weed and wait it out

This CNN guy probably hates election night. He has to spend all night nonstop reading numbers out loud
Is there a decent YouTube stream? CNBC is garbage and so is CBS
Because you’re a gay bear
Sad no Alex Jones
Ahh probs cause I don’t live in US. We have a KFC on every street corner though in U.K. tho
Anyone have a solid idea as to why futures are positive considering how close the election results are?

Biden is gonna lose Florida, but he doesn't need it. NC could be the tiebreaker for him.

Cocaine is a hell of a drug

Bruh our puts are ded. May we guh in peace
Wassup with Texas 🤔
Some of the smaller swampy counties haven't counted yet and those are where the rednecks live. All the higher economy areas are blue-leaning.

The last couple packs of voters could be red, who knows until we know.
I’m 20 and I swear everyone around my age is for Biden, blinded by the media

1 straight up bet on trump win at the bookies. Get a x 3 return on 12k USD.
2 put everything on a 32x leveraged s&p long derivative and get rich
I’m not burning it down lmao, I think that’s why Trump got a lot of support because dems are burning/looting.

Yeah I'm worried about buying into CHIQ because NIO is one of the main holdings and we all know what's been happening with NIO this year. Will probably wait for a correction to get in on CHIQ.

Other than that I'm really not sure because I don't know if I want to buy more US stocks at the moment. BABA looked like a safe bet compared to US stocks until today happened
No
FL has been counting mail in votes for three weeks now. People who voted today are the tail end of the count

Guys, if you’re not trading futures, just turn your phone off and check back in the morning to see if your positions printed.

That’s what I would do if I wasn’t trading futures like a degenerate.
they think we're all 4 year olds thats why they feel so superior and speak down to us and claim they know whats best for us.

Biden winning Florida by 2% with 65% of votes counted
Just like in 2016, whoever wins Florida wins the country. And it looks like Biden.
Completely.
HOLY SHIT HE GONNA LOSE FLORIDA
I'm betting on vol crushing no matter who wins. 

It might spike if Trump says he's contesting the election though.

thats the wild card right now, if biden wins and its close then we have a problem
If Trump were to have a surprise night like 2016, he'd already be up in Florida. It was one of his better "toss-up" states this year. Biden's lead is solid.

Biden winning Florida by .5% with 60% of votes counted
I wrote in GME for President on my ballot. 

That way when they announce that GME got a vote for President it’ll make the stock moon.
Biden wins possible legalize
WHERE IS JAH ?!?!?
I pull my profits fully clothed
Fuck both sides of this race, we have trash for choices... and yet we still stand for it
Hey, math is hard for the uneducated
hope he wins
If trump loses how fast do u think he turns into dementia don to try and avoid jail

Absolute brainlets in here supporting Biden due to irrelevant social issues rather than focusing on what actually matters; money

Root for chaos tonight.
It’s so fucking close in Florida
$BGGSQ  has an average volume of 6. This is a good sign as it is always nice to have a liquid stock.
So if markets are adjusting for a biden win, then that means everything should moon if trump wins right?
[deleted]
Lol next polls close in 1 min, STILL TO EARLY TO CALL
VIX is the projected future 30 day volatility, not the current realized volatility. VIX dropping means the market thinks there will be a clear winner.

We don't even wait for the real numbers, we look at midnight futures and go OMFG RED even though it goes green the next day.

Are you me?
Trump is leading Florida by 1% so bears are celebrating
May whomever win be 100% focused on creating new ATHs in the stock market weekly. Amen.
Even if futures go up more, or come back down in the next hour, realistically the movement isn't going to matter at all until at least 10pm-1am. That's when you'll have a much clearer picture of how this is going to play out. Until then, your stupid SPY mOoNiNG comments are pointless.

What kind of shit stocks do you have to invest in to lose everything? Maybe lose 50%, but all of it? Come on
We should end up in the 320-350 range by open...
Margin now shrinking to +1.6% Biden. with 30%+ votes remaining.
Holy fuck is Florida BASED?

Even if 1 out of 20 people thought it was funny to write him in, less than 5% of them would get off their ass to actually vote for someone with such a slim shot at winning.
If mango wins, the place I work is getting burned down...

The only 2 states that matter as far as GDP goes are CA and NY; and most of that money is generated by 1% of people. 

Irrelevant argument
Yeah. They kind of are. The people don't vote for the president and VP directly. They vote for the electoral college that would vote for them.
predict it is down LOL, site for betting on presidential election

guarantee it's a panic to buy/sell right now, everyone dumping biden shares
No I’m just asking cuz the markets haven’t given a shit lately about nothing. I’m just trying to see if this fucking massive rally will continue to the after party tomorrow

Anyone else get this bracelet commercial on youtube?

Idk im headed in for a deep dive, its literally a r/thathappened story being presented as proof feng shui makes your cousins watch business blast off 'in just a week'

Old people.  Covid and Trump shitting on Biden for acting like an old person, turns out old folks don’t like that.
Trump will have a late rally since his voters have been at work all day
Yeah but I think it's theoretically possible to win with only like 30% of the vote or something stupid
I dunno man, Trump killing it in miami.

Trump might win Florida due to the Latino vote. What a fucking twist.
Someone with a dildo tried assaulting me with it in front of that poll please be very careful
I mean, why weed is against a party who's ideals are for personal freedoms is beyond me.

Damn.  I was in on AUY.  I like b2g too.
LOL r/politics is loosing it
Impressive. Mine was -94.
Bidens always been ahead
The fact trump has majority of the middle/southern counties in Florida with 0 northern countries counted makes me confident he will win Florida.

I mean, we'll just have to agree to disagree, but we finally get a black president and Trump goes on a fucking campaign to try to prove he isn't American even though there wasn't evidence to back it up.
I’m up 5% today soooooo
> Dade county is 54% for Biden

CLinton got over %60 last time

I’m looking at google live and it’s saying Biden has a 3% lead
He and his followers will shout 'silent majority' for another 4 years. Not knowing what majority means.

Back in August I sold some November 20 iron condors and they lost zero value since then because VIX decided to jump to fucking 40. Tomorrow I'll finally start profiting from those iron condors after sitting on them for 2 months.

Never selling anything longer than 28 days again.
as Biden’s odds increase market gets more red, you see the pattern here ?
Wow can this election make or break murica?
What are the plays here? Been out of the MJ stocks for awhile now after getting burned there...
Fuuuck those are bad numbers for Biden

Every important country has its struggles. I've only ever seen Canada struggle on south park. So sit back with your ketchup popcorn or whatever the hell it's you eat at the movies, watch the show, and 🤫🤫🤫.
I think the presidential election is decided
so does it seem like futes aren't rooting for big T?
I still got time on these VXX calls. But I’m getting big scared rn
Same for GA. If GA goes blue, Trump is fucked.
Everytime orange takes the lead in Florida, futures start to fade. 🤔🤔🤔

The only thing that ViX loves is trumps Twitter
I agree with buying this dip, especially since it would be an irrational sell off. I’m just saying that libertarians would argue the “dems make stonks go up” data might be misleading.

If stocks are forward looking, if rich people believe dems will hurt stocks they can go down in anticipation of the coming tax regime which is being measured as stocks going down during a republican. Then anticipation of the political pendulum swinging toward a lower tax regime might make forward looking stocks go up at the end of democrat presidencies in anticipation.

I really like this thread so am coming back to write something I saw here. 

There is a retired surgeon member who realized at least 1M or so last year trading AMD. Based on posts I remember, I am fairly certain he paid or partially paid the student loans of a pre-med student member here who was down on his luck. That was a real wsb feel-good moment.
Fuck, markets would be up 25%+.
Personally I think anyone is better than Mango Smallhands, but the market gives zero fucks as long as there is certainty. There will be stimulus and Fed printing either way.
Can’t. Polls are closed.

Hookers and meth

Check the stock market from 2009-2016

Punctuation?
Yes, 56% of people polled believe they are better off now than in 2015. Considering the year we have had that says something
Oh yeah
The IV crush is gonna be insane tomorrow
Rofl... Like that's changing.

No matter who wins, we will be laughed at.
Dummy is sus, vote him out

Whatever soy boy
its 3% now with 48% of votes counted
Y'all really thought Trump was losing Kentucky lol
[deleted]
Too soon to tell. Dems voted heavy early and Republicans turned out heavily today. If the results are close the panhandle could turn it red. If polls were even remotely accurate, Biden easily
[removed]
If it gets anywhere near that close this shit will be contested by both sides for a long ass time
Breakeven - $29, current price - $17.9 .. F
Puts on stability
America is literally worse than it was in 2016

Jimmy Carter would like to introduce himself.
Vermont has a bunch of white 1%’ers and they’re not voting trump... what the fuck
Trump gonna lose Fl and Ga? Damn, anticlimactic.
Their website, fuck if I’m actually watching this shit show on tv, got plenty of better things. Plus riots won’t start until midnight or later.
You think this is going to be given up without a fight?
[deleted]
Holy shit peopl actually voted for ye 💀💀💀💀
Now this is pod racing
1% in and Biden is winning Vermont by 30%
I’m putting on my looting shoes, I don’t care who wins, I’m getting a new TV damn it.
Mike Pence is short for Michael Pencil
3.4% at 48% now
What's all this blue shit $USA is puking up.
You think Joe doesn't have enthusiasm behind him? That would be a snore fest
😴gonna make it moon 🌝
 Donnie 50%

Piden 49% 


close race
Broccoli Biden
Damn someone’s PISSED 😂
You would die
Almost a thousand people voted for Kanye in KY
Holy shit this might be over quick if that gap doesn’t close for Florida even though the pan handle doesn’t report for another hour
He’s not winning them yet they’re saying it’s 50/50. Trumps up 24 to 3 right now
Not true it may take another fat rip before it crashes that’s why I said I’m watching it
Congrats theta gang. Puts and calls fucked with IV crush tomorrow. We gonna open flat just because.
NBC says Vermont goes to Biden. That’s not news
Donnie 50% 

Piden 49% close race
Wow I really underestimated how dumb this sub is. Lot of trump voters. My question to all of you: is America great again yet? 🤡🤡🤡
Absolutely massive riots if Trump wins
Futures crashing
I was watching McConnell vs McGrath and it felt like I was watching my puts premiums.

When I first looked it was a close race, but then everytime I look back it turns more and more red.
Damn as a europoors I don’t give a fuck who wins. I just want him to win clearly without post election bitching and revisions
🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵 Florida
What a fggt
Wtf FL flipped ?

Still futures didn't change ? 


WTF
For 1460 days we all make fun of Florida for being far and away the most wheels off state in the country. And then every 1461st day we let them choose the leader of the free world so maybe the rest of us are actually the retards.
[deleted]
Ride pumped so hard today. Any news?
Lol if Biden wins FL just pack it up
God I hope Trump

Only 15% in, lots can change either way
Bears fell for the most obvious trap
So are my SQQQ and VXX calls for Friday fucked? Or is it red tomorrow?
I bet that every single Biden supporter in here has PDT restrictions and is desperate for their next $1,200 stimulus check to get back in action. 

No chance anyone with money actually votes for Biden
Anyone familiar with that bitch Jacob wohl?

well he's back on his bullshit

Are you not seeing biden is winning Georgia and Florida?
Anyone who sold last week because they were afraid to hold through the election are straight pussies. 

My balls are in a wheelbarrow!!
Trump Lickers in shambles
We used to barely coexist, and that's deteriorating
The falcons
Biden winning Florida by 2% with 36% of votes counted
What if one vote determined this election.... woah
trump wins, stonks go up

biden wins, stonks go up

stonks only go up
Gay bear 👎👎👎
*sigh*

check their charts/financials.
Im all in
Congrats. Fuck off. When did you buy them?
It's r/Politics, what do you expect?
Not all that impressive considering I had around 200 at one point.
They haven't even reported close to the numbers they'd need to call those states.
Bruh he’s gonna win by midnight if not earlier
If you aint living in 'Merica, GTFO
Realistically, I’m the closest living relative in the US. My daddy was an illegal that got deported when I was an infant.

Jesus.  It's just hard to win.  People just keep buying.   It's up 2000%.  Crazy
Yeah if you can keep up with 15 gender pronounss and don’t mind shoveling billions of dollars to a bunch of corrupt tribal elders talking about living with nature as they drive f-500 dualy with their racing spec skidoo on the back to go out and shoot a couple hundred caribou with their high powered rifles.

Massive blue dildo on the $FL one hour chart
Trumps up 60-38 but they called VA for Biden
Florida is a swing state. This means that they choose to have an open relationship. Sometimes, they go for the republicans and sometimes they go with the democrats. In the swinging world, Floridians make their own rules around what they need within political affiliations and vow to abide by the boundaries set forth.
Who cares 😂 😴 Joe makes STONKS go up that’s what is important

Who won the supper bowl
2016 mango won Florida by like 117k votes

this is gonna be intense as fuck
At this price I am playing to get both. I haven't bought TLT in many years and it isn't normally even on my radar but I like some cash safe here with a solid month or two return thinking the broader market will be lower in a month or two when I'll cycle back. I know most are bulls here but I expect a selloff end of year due to a Biden win and Covid round 2 being bigger than what people seem to realize (seems a bit crazy to me!). Market doesn't reflect the real economy though, so I may be wrong.
Trump duh.
ayeeeeeeeee will be drunk fast as shit man hahaha
Polls weren't fucking wrong in 2016. The national vote was correct. Hillary got more votes and that's what idiots quoted, national numbers.

The state polls were right or within margin of error. 

People literally just ignored ANY result that favored trump because "hmm.. That seems crazy".

People will latch onto media narratives and never do any work themselves

Yeah jacked to the tits in stock positions
Do people really think there are gonna be riots tonight. I don't see why there would be unless a cop kills an unarmed black person tonight which tbh isn't that unlikely
Got what a sad story. Didn’t even YOLO SPY puts, just sold positions like a pussy.

The fuck is “Cellcom”?
So far, in rural counties Trump is doing slightly worse than he did in 2016 and it's enough for him to lose most swing states.
Let’s see that daily activity you lazy shit
Trumps gonna win by 10 pm lol
Kinda feel left out not holding any position through the election. Would have gone with calls.
I dont know what you are watching but they didnt call it yet
“Yesterday”
Nancy would still have no reason to give in, and neither would mitch, who you need remember is still at 500b
Yep
I’m pissed as hell. Dumbass Zimbabwe-server run bs
These are always blue
Is that real or?
Damn you must be young
Balls
Florida doesn't matter until the pan handle. If trump is within 3-4% he wins florida because pan handle polls close an hour later
...I have a portfolio of calls. It’s finally happening.

limit down by open
America Will finally be a nation of intellects and believers in science again (maybe)
so who does the market want to win???
Trump losing FL cuz shit is rigged
This comment from this interview sparked my interest into looking into the things Biden says or does off the cuff. The things that roll out of his brain when he's off script are baffling.
Uh oh, McConnell just took the lead, not getting a stinky

Because I don’t give a fuck what Mike Tyson sounds like when he talks, I bet on him because he’s going to win fights. People that hate Trump have so many human centric problems with him as an individual.

Idk man I’m baked
Yeah at like 15% votes counted it was Trump winning by a 10% margin at least, now it's turning around to Biden so he caught up by 10% in those 5% of votes counted
CNN was saying one of polls was still open in Florida
Florida Biden voter here 💪🏼💪🏼
Well he’s gonna contest so
Doesn't look like he's losing any red states.

I agree with you completely.. people just dont want to listen and think and have a conversation.   I may disagree, but damn, cant we at least hear each others' viewpoint before shutting it out.  

It is amazing to me to see the number of people who see something on social media and/or tv and immediately forward it on if they agree, or ignore if there is an opposing viewpoint.

I watch a little bit of every news channel throughout the week, and actually like the foreign stuff like some korean news thing that comes on later at night.   Interesting to get their slant on shit.

Nah Hitler is evil and Trump doesn't compare but I wasn't comparing them. I'm just saying, a good economy doesn't excuse Trump's asinine Presidency. The man literally did nothing except enact a tax plan that made his friends rich while the working man gets fucked down the road.

Watch TYT for the meltdown
If Biden wins Florida the race is literally over. If Trump wins it, it’s still on. That’s insane
Clear proof of systemic racism today in age
I doubt it and I didn’t vote for him
I voted biden in california so it really didnt count.  I shouldnt be in the poll
I mean... If you just figured that out you really shouldn't be trading

Everyone predicting wins forgets Hillary was predicted to win pretty much all night.

Blitzer has to constantly interject that “it’s still early” to calm folks seeing early red.
CNN called Vermont for Biden with 0 votes and 0% reporting.

I mean it will, but come on man
I think florida is the evidence going against Trump right now. Most expected Biden already, and it is leaning more that way early into the evening.

Florida...such a weird state. Super high amount of rich ass smart people avoiding taxes, and then even more super high amount of dumb fuck rednecks avoiding taxes. And that's just Northeast Florida
I can't understand why you would ever vote for Donald Trump. Maybe if I start inhaling rubber cement I'll understand.

If Biden wins should I buy $SWBI ?

Why would you ever tell someone. Half my friends are posting shit on Instagram that if you vote for trump you don’t respect me. Wtf is that type of shit
What is your current position / size ?
Which state?
Way too early to tell.
I guess JRE isn’t happening ??
Bruh not autist if you’re leaving 17k liquid, ur just smart
Biden’s plan for the savers credit is for a tax credit paid to you for 26% of your contribution to a pre-tax 401k. If you make $80,000 per year and contribute 10% to your pretax 401k, that works out to a tax credit of $2080. Under the current plan, all other things being equal, you would see a tax savings of $1760. Where are you getting your info?
CNN is so entertaining to watch atm. They sound like us when analyzing every possible Biden win.
Didn’t know Briggs and Stratton was bankrupt
6 month long con. I regretted not getting any action in 2016 and decided to leverage a string-bet. Strategy:

1. Straight up bets on trump win on bookies. They give a 3:1 for your money and that seems like the best bet. Ive put $ 12 000 and im just waiting to cash in.
2. Do clever research and realize s&p500 goes higher the first five days after the reelection of all last presidents last 20 years. S&p took a 15% dump after Obama on election, then just 5% down days after reelection. Trump had a solig 3% s&p gain after 2016 win, so im pretty confident we will see a 5-6% gain first-two days after results are in. This is the only weak point in my strategy, because WHEN is key here. This will also act as a catalyst the longer no clear winner is determined because the market will stagnate or fall. Then, when he is decleared winner, go ALL INN 38k USD on a 32x geared long derivate of the s&p for a day maybe two.
3. Cash in a small portion to cover christmas expences now that I have a 1 year old child, and re-invest the rest. Any tips on strategy afterwards?
Because I bought puts.
I had calls all last week.

As long as we pick someone. I can't imagine no clear winner is bullish.
Bruh how much premium did you get for each one of those? 5 bucks ?
Imagine being a military veteran and supporting a draft dodger 🤡
Okay you've made it clear you can't read so I'm done. Have a good one. Sorry that your party stole the election from your savior Bernie twice.

Well certainly -- they tightened monetary policy -- and that was a result of Hoover, as I recall. But to blame them is stupid. And it's especially stupid coming from people who advocate for the gold standard, which caused the constricted  monetary policy in the first place.

And it's triply stupid to assume that the Fed hasn't changed since then in both power and policy, and also gained knowledge.
it absolutely works both ways. both sides shut the other out. there is no dialogue. and i put a lot of blame on our media. fox, cnn, msnbc pump their bias to the partisans.

Long term I plan on selling further OTM, especially once I make my money back. I’m planning on this to be a long term play so the covered calls are basically a bit of added cash. But ya know...if they get exercised then at least I made some dough.

r/politics is perfect representation of what's going on in this country with media and social media. god forbid u have a different view, or challenge the orthodoxy, ..u won't have a chance to express your view. maybe this is a "just silence everything that may support trump" and it'll end if biden wins. but, i don't think that's what gonna happen.

I look at big money inflow and it is crazy high in recent weeks. It's similar to saying insiders are buying a stock. I was considering buying at $158 with roughly $170 as my sale target by December. Getting in at $156 is very safe from a risk perspective. Not sexy though, no big return here.

It's a pendulous progression.
Biden’s plan only allows a personal deduction of 27% of what you could possibly put into the 401k. The current tax deduction allows your entire 401k contribution and an additional 12k.
I guess we'll find out shortly.

Calls on ladyboys
You are conflating two different things. The standard deduction and 401k credits are separate. If you compare Biden’s proposal to the current one, no matter how you calculate it you get more money back as a credit under Biden’s plan if you make less than 163,300. How smooth is your brain?

I thought my life was a comedy but it’s really a try not to cum challenge
Each state has a certain number of electoral college votes depending on the population size of that state. Depending on which candidate wins in a state that candidate gets ALL the votes of that state. So it Biden wins by 1% in Texas all of Texas’ votes go to Biden.

People have been able to vote by mail or vote in person. It takes time for votes to be counted (especially mail in votes). We can expect results for early mail in votes and in person votes sometime in the next few hours but many of the mail in ballots won’t be counted for 2-3 weeks 😮

Many states are pretty solidly republican or democrat. So really the election mostly lies in the hands of a few states which are hard to tell who they will vote for. This year keep your eyes peeled for Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.

There's always uncertainty, its a market. There are other factors at play besides the election. We're up 100 points now on the S&P BEFORE polls close. It has already exceeded my expectation on the trade - as far as I'm concerned the market is absolutely expecting a Biden win. Trump lost the minute he announced he got COVID - the market turned hard that night into a Joe Biden victory. The isolation of posters here however are in a group think bubble that's about to pop. Days later everyone will talk about how obvious it was - except clearly it was not.

I really am not sure what you mean by not tracking accordingly. 

Nothing is certain though, I'm just early, and it pays to be early (if correct) I would be very very surprised if I'm wrong, but I've put myself out there, we'll see how things turn out shortly.
Lmao this should be the only trend
Oh yeah, prop 21 in CA, right?  Uber will just pull out of CA

As I sit here, and drink myself to death
I think the most straightforward answer is that I think we should have a good president. I'm not a fan of the nihilism argument that "it doesn't really matter so why do you care?" Surely we've got higher standards than that. 

The practical answer is I have insurance through the ACA. He's actively trying to remove it without a replacement. I was actually hopeful that an outsider like him could tear through industry and bureaucracy and set up a new system where health insurance was affordable like he said he would do. But I can see now that it was all just hot air. There's no plan, there's no outline, after 4 years of saying "next month".
Bought a spy put to hedge. What a waste of money. Fuck you bears

I don't know how travelled you are, but America is one of the least racist places in the world, definitely the least racist place I have been to. I don't believe the systematic racist narrative one bit, but I know we will never agree there.

SPY 270
Dude the delegates aka electors can't vote for whoever they want. Their delegates are assigned to the majority winner of the state. The states are almost all winner take all. If the results are in dispute it goes to the House and Senate no matter what. The house doesn't select the president on simple majority either, it's based on who holds the majority of seats in each state and each state then has a vote or each state delegation has a vote. Currently the Republicans have a majority in 25 states and the Democrats in 24.
I wanted to watch the election but I started too early and I’m kinda fucked up. How do I gamble on this

Yes but that doesn’t translate to stock prices as news moves stock prices more than sales do. Plus who gets the benefit, do I think the manufacturing company is the one who will reap the benefit of the increase volume, or is the physical/online retailer the one who is most likely to see an increase in value as a result? Is it both? And it very easily can be offset by any negative news whether true or false that comes out about that company. 

The stock market doesn’t move the way it should because it’s not an indicator of present value alone, but also all future predicted profit and value. And as such like I said news and feelings of consumers matter just as much and usually more than current or even past sales trends.

I thought this was good! I agree that the market will respond favorably to a Dem sweep.  I do have a question -- Is the market more skeptical of a Biden win than the polls?  If the election news is so good for Biden, why hasn't the market tracked accordingly? You paint a portrait of certainty, but the market seems to disagree.

TSLA should have been Mufasa - the current king of EV

Good point. That many Supreme Court appointments are quite an anomaly. And the hundreds of federal judge positions were open prior to Trump taking office. Obama didn’t do his part by appointing those before he left office if I remember correctly.
I hate getting fatfished on tinder
At least you made profit.
There won’t be anything left for calls by morning time, MMs will take all the pump for themselves

12 More Years
The presidential system in the US is odd. 

Each state has a number of Electors based on the population. The candidate who wins the popular vote of a state receives the votes of all of that state’s Electors. 

So the election results come in as each state reports who won the state and the Electors are assigned to one candidate or another. 

When one candidate hits 270 Electoral votes the election is called or determined. 

This is the default scenario with no recounts or “fraud” accusations or whatever else may happen. 

I can go into more detail if you’d like!

There’s a new thread guys.
Welcome to the club 🚀

Don’t let this distract you from the fact we already at 90,000 corona cases and 1120 deaths. This is really what futures are mooning off of.
It’s been 36 minutes and futures are up 1%. *what*

Not the most important thing. It’s equally important. A president is spokesman and emissary for the 300 million residents of the country. 

trump is a petty, small man. He’s an embarrassment to our nation and has left us as divided as we’ve ever been since slavery was a thing. Look at the boarded up businesses across the nation now if you don’t believe me. 

The trump presidency will go down as one of the darkest moments in American history and rightfully so. We need to correct the mistake tonight
BYEDON 2020!!
Why would someone competent aspire to become president?
Does anyone else feel like between Executive, Judicial, and Legislative that the president has the LEAST significant impact on our day-to-day lives? Far less than legislative at least, IMO. Yet we all get so worked up over who the president is the most and sling the most shit over that than anything else?

Lol no, the electoral college isn’t tied to any laws requiring them to vote based on the outcome of anything else. Even so, they just would abstain. The election continues. If one of the candidates gets 270 electoral votes they win. 

If they don’t it falls to congress then and there to vote for it. Regardless the show rolls on. House and senate will vote for president and Vice President.

Just go read the Wikipedia lol. There’s **policies and procedures** for it. That’s government for you!

How do you know he's the lesser evil when nobody knows anything about him yet? Did you know what trump was gonna be before he got into office?
Democrats are dangerous because they play with people's emotions and they try to influence indirectly. Trump is being a retard sometimes but at least he doesn't hide his opinions and him being direct (too much at times) should actually be comforting you

Someone explain to me how a 300 million citizen country produced these two dickheads as candidates.
Imagine seeing record minority turnout and thinking it’s good for Trump 🤣
Y’all keep seeing the market is mooning because of Biden. Lol no it’s not. As soon as they said orange was ahead in Kentucky and Indiana, futures started ripping.
Fucking CNN is happy as pigs in shit watching Trump burn
Me 💎🤲🏻 362 puts bought today
I’m edging all night until I hear that bell ring. 💦 starting to hurt 😔🥴

Where are the bears saying that futures gonna be bloody?? Get cucked deep with your worthless puts. 😬🤯🤡🤣🤣

Here's the thing, your reasoning behind the market rally means jackshit. I'm also in calls but for completely different reasons:

1. Technical reversal pattern with 90% success rate.
2. Exact same pattern played out in 2016. VIX topped and DJI bottomed on the last Fri before the elections.
3. There's absolutely zero outcome where market tanks because all outcomes are risk positive.
4. I think Trump wins and market spikes another 5%.

Market does what market wants and don't let a lucky roulette round get to your head. If market doesn't agree with my direction I'll be the first one out the door.

Enough with these lmao
Calls on Trump killing himself after losing Florida
Yep.  You’re fucked buddy lol
2009-2016 take a look at the stock market performance. That’s all I have to say. If you aren’t long on a 😴 J win you are going to miss out so hard.
I may have made the same mistake, if I hadn't done a zillion hours of research first. You can't sell something no one is willing to buy.
👍 thanks bro
Pessimists getting obliterated
I’m so glad I can finally go a day without being told to vote
I sold my VIX calls over the last week, I’m wagering the outcome isn’t as bad as everyone hedged for. I really think we’ll melt up as hedges unwind and X Trillion in stimulus comes into play.

Rip vix october20-nov20 the hype was short lived
Futures pricing in a rally tomorrow hence the rally in futures
The pattern over the past few months has been huge run up then consolidation followed by another run up. 

But more recently that consolidation period isn't really happening....jumped from 23 to 28 then 28 to 32 and now 32 to 35 super quickly. So you could bet on a consolidation period but there might not actually one at all.
Wouldn’t qqq do the best under Biden though?
Unfortunately not 😭

Man, if Biden wins Kentucky...
I only bought them because spy was extremely overbought. 

That's literally the only reason.
That’s all we need. Call the race, it’s over!
So you think the most important thing about being a politician is nice? Like you could go over to his house and he could talk about opinions with you?

Don't you think a spine is more important characteristic?
If you really wanna flush it away like that. Give it to something local Nobody’s heard of. The big charities Like Red Cross just dump money on dumb expenses and big organization overhead structures. Put it to good use with something targeted in your neighborhood
I know. Hence if. I didn’t know what Lamborghini you were referring to.
Lol it amazes me the inability of people to see the bias in the news they watch. I mean, I'm definitely a pretty far right leaning conservative, but I'm not gonna sit here and act like Fox isn't completely biased and downright ridiculous A LOT of times (I don't actively watch Fox News, btw).

Thanks genius
Probably bovada
Damn just took a look at futures.
I doubt we’ll even make money buying calls tomorrow MMs gonna save it for themselves with futures. It’ll just open high and stay flat LOL
Prob not gonna happen. Pretty red
WTF is this CNN analysis: "here is a county in bumfuck Indiana that just happens to have voted for the eventual president in every election since 1956." Who TF cares? It means fuck all unless there's something unique about that county.

Yeah January 290, bought today during the second dip

I think we can all agree that the best thing about tonight will be the rampant tweeting from Trump, whether it be a close election, a loss, or a win, this man is going to tweet like crazy
You do realize Biden was campaigning on a  “dark winter” under trump... totally not fear mongering at all.

Nope, sorry I'm not the fantasy "liberal" person that lives in your head. Also FWIW I consider myself fairly left, to the point that I'd use the word "liberal" to refer to both Democrats and Republicans in the US.

Market was down about 55% when they took office, now it’s up 50%. Interesting change of pace for him if he wins.
Oh S H I T KY jelly wtf is that about?
It’ll say “too close to call” because news networks need their ad revenue

Did people actually move when trump won last time?
I don’t care who wins - I will still be here for you all
I agree. Short term I am extremely bullish if we get democratic sweep and big stimulus. Long term, I am extremely bearish on the USD. Not sure about equities because government might have to enact UBI. A lot of jobs won’t be coming back.

I think we are disagreeing on the short term. But also keep in mind there’s some money still for use from CARES and also it’s only 2 months until a new stimulus (not that long). And there’s also eviction ban.

I believe it will go to Biden based on the democratic energy being at an all-time high in the state & all fresh 18-year olds are being encouraged to vote for Biden

hey guys i’m new here is it true that stonks only go up ?
Are you holding any?
I missed Tesla i wont miss this. Im buying all week! Bought today!
Been torture in AZ
Bruh just use the internet
And that’s why we can’t have nice things everyone
Absolutely. It's super bullish in here. Plus, we had nearly +3% over the past two days. I'll report my gains tomorrow.
RIP Put Holders 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
So is best buy having 100% off sales in any stores near you?
Lmfao
See that's the main problem. People hate trump so they just vote for someone who's not him. I am betting you that 90% of these new young voters have no idea what Biden is all about but they get a vote in cause everyone tells them its the right thing to do
[deleted]
And the texts and calls
I tried to sell my NIO calls at 3:59 and missed cause I was on a work call. I think that was the universe saying “Nah dude, hold those another day, bigly pump tomorrow.”
great, can they approve the ant ipo now?
POLITICS!
Wait till we take out the highs maybe?
Up 10%
Anyone know what time Florida will report? I’m convinced whoever wins that state wins the election
Policy-wise? I won’t comment. As a human? Yes
You can’t buy puts all the time. The orange man won’t give up.
Your wife’s boyfriend will nail your other foot to the box if you sell his car
What if orange man is actually bad and people have been making sound arguments supported by evidence this whole time? What would that look like?

It’s green rn. But he was pretty quick to change. So probably before midnight we’ll start tanking. Exactly as planned. Sublime DD

Today was weird but I bought at market open due to a feeling, and made a killing. Fucking NIO was on an Elon rocket blasting off to the moon. I even made money on fucking Del Taco yo.

Vote counting won't technically be done for weeks, and the electoral college results aren't final until December.

But depending on how everything goes, an accurate projection can be made, sometimes in the early morning on Nov 4. If it's close, it could take days, or weeks, to count the absentee ballots and make an accurate projection.

Really depends if it's a landslide or not.
We should know by tn, and don't trust polls. Clinton was leading them all campaign and Trump still won.
China won't let that happen
I don’t understand why Disneyland is closed in California, if people want to go, let them go man, it’s their choice. If you’re so afraid of this damn virus stay inside fucking Christ there I said it.

What do you do when you need to do something really painful but needs to be done? You rip that fucking bandaid off.

It happened again, was wiping my ass and my finger accidentally slipped into my ass this is very bullish but I kinda liked it so maybe it’s bearish 🤷🏽‍♂️
Don’t worry. You’ll see. 😘
Joke's on you, I never leave my house willingly.
You can argue the fight against coronavirus is a war, but it’s false to say he started it, wuhan, China started it.
I hope so too. Just want it to go one way or other, very choppy.
I have lots of liberal friends (I’m more moderate but I voted for Biden this time) but I can’t imagine any of them being like those rioters or people burning down cities. I wonder where you meet those types of liberals.
Ah go fuck yourself with a cactus.

My NIO calls went down eod when stock price stays flat.. why is that

You guys are pretty cool so I ask, as a non American, how does this elections work? 

Main questions: when do we know who won? Where can I see some sort of pre-counting or official polls?
everyone sayin bears r fuked makes me think tomorrow will be the darkest red we've seen since March.
BREAKING: In response to looting concerns, the Federal Government has allocated billions of FEMA funds for GameStop Corp. (GME) to ensure it has the necessary funds to survive a social uprising. 

Concerns that younger looters may want revenge on GameStop for ripping them off over a decade ago with unfair trade-ins led to the decision. 

One analyst believes GameStop's market cap will be worth $10 Billion after tomorrow's open.
Mods thank you for not being gey and giving us this for once.

11/27 305c an 12/11 295c
You guys already freaking out over futures when no results have been announced yet and there is 15 to market open. 

Damn
We need to know who the youngsters are voting for these days.
Trump supporters so desperate for good news, celebrating a Trump win after a couple of rural counties from red states vote for trump 🤣
No, it never is. Tomorrow should be tendies for all
Yeah there are A lot of pro lifers but I think most vote on economic issues depending on where there from. I'm from Fl here most are republicans since so many cubanos. Used to live in Ca there most are democrats and Mexicans. Think Texan Hispanics  are the latter.
Don't forget the butt-fuck portion of NH - someone from NH
Yeah go all in
Not really, I have looked into both tax plans pretty deeply.
Trump won Indiana by 19 points last election. Lmao yall are desperately reaching at this point

Nah. I got puts on the VIX.

Yes, they do have a test that specifically tests for COVID.

Aye! Thanks!

Go back to mama
Celebrating a little early are we? Before the first states have reported?
U got me
Bro I look at the facts not the media. The facts are that Biden wants to dip his nose in my pocket, prefers that welfare leeches get more money from me because they do not believe in working hard.
Socialism helps those who need a system to rely on, not independent people who take responsibility for their lives. And that's a fact
The number #1 most popular first name of Biden supporters is literally Karen so I think you're right

Might as well just limit up tomorrow.

Winning? Sir this is a casino.....
Its rural Kentucky and Indiana.  Biden stomps overall
I’m banking on iv crush so I can buy back contracts
Yea it’s just like not voting. But Ross Perot got 19% of the vote back in 1992, so its possible if we ever had a candidate like him who also appealed to young people + minorities (to get that to 40%+), it could make a difference.
If you think it will only apply to 400k+ then you're in for a surprise.
You wouldn’t vote for yourself if you were on the ballot?🤡🤡🤡
Holy shit. Jeb is in the lead!
Making a statement or voting your conscience or some shit.  yoloing weeklies has a better ROI than voting third party.

Futures acting like it’s all a formality at this point and the race will be called by 8pm. Someone must be way ahead in a couple swing states for insider polling. Biden only needs a couple swings to get the odds dramatically in his favor

What happened to everyone's balls in this sub.
Sauce? All I saw was Dicksville Notch
Posted this last night

Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tonight. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY and puts posts i see.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY from yesterday's close. https://i.imgur.com/IjSZYef.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode - it may be short term, highly uncertain, but I think clearly negative - and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

All day long I saw people wondering why's the market up so much today?? Well, now you know - the best tasting tendies for me yet - and still more to go.
Just voted in the WPG election. Might vote in this one too
[deleted]
[deleted]
The initial margin require though is still damn high which I think is not set by the brokers. I use to trade like 5 ES at a time, but now need bigly money to do it.
I know lots of suburban women voting for Trump. We have no idea who will win.
CNN, FOX, and MSNBC are trash.


But I gotta be honest, I legitimately live for John King and his touch wall, zooming in and out of counties and shit.

I can't get enough of it. Gonna watch this shit all night then go back to never watching CNN for 4 years
My calls do depend on it
What do you have?
I can't deduct any donations. Welcome to Europe.

To be fair, haven't seen any big wins yet either.
My new co worker moved from Cali to Germany. He asked me „what’s your favorite TV show?“. I Feld guilty to when i told him „murica“. 🍿 it’s 12 am but the election will be worth it 😁
Boo
Dont be shy pump some more
Some of you are really that retarded thinking a Biden win is good for the market like holy shit
[removed]
can agree, never said this either
Biden is fucked, no way he can close that gap with only 4M votes left
I'm a pussy and been cash. Plan to do some yolos tmrw so ill update then

You guys are brutal, I just wanted to have a laugh
what changed for you?
is futures moving on Trump winning Indiana, but that's expected?
someone link me the election live feed
Like 50k votes lmao

Trump probably wins it but still too early
Definitely  did not say monthly honey. You dreaming. Only director level, fellows, C level employees make that monthly.
BUSH DID 9/11
fuck that red candle. it's gonna be a long night of staring at futures with puckered cheeks
I have calls, but I’d like to remind everyone that futures went up in a similar fashion on the night after the first debate and proceeded to tank to deep red shortly after. So don’t dance yet.

Haven't you guys realised? r/politics is just r/orangemanbad

Not really rallying for nothing. There was hesitation that there wouldn't be a clear leader. Now it seems like Biden will most likely win. Which means a huge stim package. Aka bullish. This game is literally too easy.

this sub is def not conservative skewed.. kinda surprised it isn't tho

Heads up guys.

There’s not going to be a contested election. There’s definitely not going to be a civil war. 

[Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/11/922827554/gen-mark-milley-says-the-military-plays-no-role-in-elections) already said *publicly* months ago that they don’t work for Trump and won’t support any election bullshit.


If there’s a big blue or red landslide then there’s no contest or issues. 


If it’s a close race, [contested elections need to be recounted and declared 6 days before](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641) December 14th, because that is when the electoral college votes. And once they vote; it’s over. Their say is the final say either way. There doesn’t need to be an inauguration. No ceremony. Nothing. Who they decide WILL be president. 

People know this. This isn’t a secret. Do you think smart money is out there loaded with VIX calls? No. Because they know regardless of how we poors vote, they know it doesn’t matter until December 14th. And when it’s over it’s over. 

Enjoy the IV crush. 🤷

Feels good to be a reserve currency
The way I see it is that mango hasn't really responded to any of those issues. 

He talks shit about the (legitimate) peaceful protesters, riles up his supporters, and doesn't take responsibility for making half of the country believe that covid is a political thing.

He could have sat back and coasted to re-election if he didn't try to make everything about himself. Narcissistic retard.
Well I got one today expiring the 20th and it’s a $116 call. Hopefully it goes up tomorrow so we can sell
lol going to be so green tomorrow what the hell man

What schools actually teach: "Oppression and exploitation is what America is and always has been all about! The only thing you can do is overthrow the system!"

Of course I want my market to pump, but we'll need all that and some more $$$ to fix everything that is fucked up afterward. I usually like to pay my dues up front. Turd Sandwich FTW.
Spy +3% tomorrow

Why are Tesla's the autist's car of choice?  You got fucking middle managers pretending they can afford this shit.  Sure they're fast, until after the 3rd time in a row you have shown off how fast it can accelerate, then you have to turn off Ludacris mode so you can make it home.
Half think he's way better than he is, and half think he's way worse than he is. Its hard to find people with a balanced sense of skepticism

Why not 3,000 or perhaps 5,000
What’s next
this is the way.
whats the best place to watch election
Liberals are what's wrong with today's society. Sad people who can't think for themselves and need to depend on a bigger daddy to help them cope with life.
I miss the days where individualism was regarded as strong and people aspired to be successful and rich . Now everyone's jealous, crying and doing tiktoks while wondering why their life is shit but instead of blaming themselves they blame trump.

Sadly these same people have been led to believe they're the smarter ones by the media and all other sad creatures like them. Open your eyes, it's not good to be part of a desperate herd. Think for yourself, don't be influenced. Smh
Trump plays a huge role in the market. Especially if he’s elected. My YOLO spy calls depend on it. 😤 I’m buying a fuckin lambo this weekend.
I thought something was A-mish
Just buy calls duh
I mean, he put quite a lot of thought into it all the way until the very end so I'd say he's trustworthy.
Me thinks the market was pricing in a trump loss not a biden win
But muh stonks have never been better!
Oh god I’m getting jplowed rn
There arent 540 missing kids. They are unable to find the *parents* of the kids. Biden replied to someone from the crowd who mentioned it and said "we are going to find those kids"

And make sure their parents are together?? Uh what?
waittttt, this is so sad being a robinhood trader, i cant buy stonk rn...Id buy the hell outta some stonk rn :(
They used it for blackmail for years then decided dumping it was with more to try to influence the election. 

Have you seen the stuff? There are literal pics and video you can watch. It isn't fake lol
Are BABA call holders in for another cuckening guh

Elections are run by the states. More specifically, the states’ Secretaries of State. Some states have said all ballots must be received by tonight. Some have said 3 days. Some have said 2 weeks. It all just depends. 

Re: lawsuits. Federal courts have done well to stay out of electoral issues, for the most part. See some Texas GOP loons that tried to get 120,000 votes in Harris county thrown out. They went to federal court and were denied a hearing.

This. People bitching about the mail - Oregon has been mail-in my whole voting life, you can't mail it in time then drop it off at a county drop box, not that hard.
The majority hates him
Shit's planned, anything to show how "good" the economy is. Imagine a pissed Donnie going  HAM on twitter because it's over.
Vix dying
Most likely yes, market prices in things much less likely than a Biden win

Trump can still win, but it's the least likely outcome by far
So a jebaited pump by initially going for green then a market crash if i understood this dd. Solid work.
Yep. Buttgieg VP 2024 LMAO. I love it

I actually do agree he somewhat sold out by backing Biden. Maybe he thinks getting a place, along with yang and AOC is worth it. Socialized medicine and education doesn’t make him a socialist. By that term any sort of bailout is “socialist”. Bailing out banks, automobile companies, even a stimulus check is “socialism”.
Holy shit why is futures literally mooning so early
I can’t wait to call my Republican dad when Biden is declared president elect. Going to hear a lot of racism.

No I don't member that since markets close hours before polls do.  Give me your drugs.
These are contentious times, people feel angry and alienated. But let's just keep everyone from expressing the full spectrum of emotions because we need to keep things neat and in a bubble.
Politicians say shit all the time.

I never cared for money, only as a means of freedom. It doesn't bring me joy so I'll happily pay more taxes so long as it goes where it is needed and so long that it is reasonable. Being pre-occupied with such trivial things like that instead of focusing on life is very lame to me.
what the fuck is this pump from no where

China wants in on IPO, guarantee Baba will moon. Today was a set back for them to buy while it was short squeezed.

Lmao futes mooning and it’s funny because I know everyone is in SPY puts and VXX calls. Logically so.

SPY 359 INCOMING
Holy fuck SPY on a tear lmao
Facts, both parties took a second to stop bickering to make sure the Bernie train didn’t leave the station. Twice.
538 gives Trump a 10% chance of winning. It’s more likely that the polls overestimated Trump supporters than underestimated them this time too.
The time when he didn't do his fucking home work and just winged it from the display they had up and started talking about using sunshine INSIDE the human body to kill the virus 🙄

Futures green = Biden win
For whom
Joe Biden is an f word that we have recently not been able to say.
ruh oh americans about to do something stupid
If you have to ask, you shouldn’t be playing this game
Given how much I've heard about people loving to see liberal tears, making liberals cry, etc... I better not hear ANY COMPLAINING when Biden wins.
More bankruptcies means a lot more layoffs means a lot less people buying shit (no matter where).
Bernie genuinely cares about people, which is why he wasn’t elected.
Where are these vids? Lost in the mail like Tuckers docs?

Up 81% on calls I grabbed the 28th.
I mentioned the calls in a daily thread around that time.
The way you talk about "big money" literally makes zero sense. The size of these portfolios... You see at most 1% adjustments. You guys fucking talk about $100M for christ sake.

It's literally the equivalent of people talking about horoscopes to describe stock movements.

I don’t think the market cares about Main Street. More bankruptcies mean more market share for the larger corps, unfortunately, eventually wall streets pockets will be lined and the wealth gap continues its steep stratification.

Why is SPY mooning but individual stonks flat?
Still love hearing people argue over which racist dude with sexual allegations to vote for when Bernie Sanders was right fucking there.
Why is this bad ?

Y’all remember 2016, it was obvious before markets closed she wasn’t going to win
I dunno man. The left fucked up hard last time, they seem like they just doubled down on their stupid shit by picking Biden
Exp?
One of you fucking drool monkeys link me to the exit poll I can’t find it
I think stimulus might happen in this circumstance because dems just wanted to not get it in before election. If they lose it wont matter.
States to watch tonight:

FL, GA, NC (should have a good idea), AZ, NE2nd.

If Biden wins just two of those, game over for Trump. If Biden wins even just FL out of all those 85% chance Trump has lost.

Something I like about Elon Musk is that he responds with answers to shit people ask on twitter. “Is starlink coming to X?” Musk - “yeah xyz reasons, but we’ll get there.” “ Is the cybertruck gonna do this?” Musk - “It won’t be available until at least 2022.” Or some feedback will be given and Musk will be like “Oh shit, yeah we’ll fix that.”

I think the worst outcome for our stocks and the market is Trump keeps the White House and Dems take control of House AND Senate.  Then NOTHING is getting done.  It will be gridlock.  No stimmy - no nothing.

Not a political statement about whether the candidates are good or bad- just a statement about the outcome.
The betting market is much better imho.

Can you explain why Trump is a worse candidate than Biden at this point? 

People act like they are polar opposites and that Trump is the worst thing ever when in reality they are both centrists. People just hate Trump personally and get caught up over these inconsequential social issues while missing out on the things that matter. 

For example the race issue is more of a wealth inequality issue; it just happens that most inherited wealth goes to whites because of the way things were in the past. Poor whites (the majority) are as bad off as anyone else.

You have the right to vote and the right for that vote to be meaningless no matter how much you downvote on r/politics
you mean his strategy of "fuck you, old people. die poor" didn't resonate strongly with them?
Biden is going to win but the story will be told as Trump being the real hero. He thought he was tearing up the democratic party, when in reality he was only making them realize how important every vote was. They went on to take control of the house, senate, and white house that very next election, fucking the republican party even harder than they could've imagined, distancing themselves from their core voting demographic and replacing it with college frat boys nationwide.

But wouldn't happen for months
Even without Stimmy where you gonna put your money? Ya'll need to think more like a person managing billions. Where are you going? Bonds? Eh, that trade has been absolute dogshit for 8 solid months. Good luck reporting to your investors you made 6% this year.  Foreign equities? Good luck when Boris shuts everything down and you lose 20%. Know what sucks less than european stock markets? Literally nothing. Commodities! you scream like a proper autist. At best you can hope for sideways and at worst COVID pulls you into a loss for the year.

No friends, the only move is the US stock market. Why? Because COVID pretty much turned tech into the messiah. An tech is having a huge ongoing halo effect on the whole US stock market. COVID resurgent just guaranteed a green year.

Of course there are some risks. I'm not 100% invested because you never can be sure just how full retard the election will go. But to me those are buyable dips. Frankly all that would scare me away at this point is some kind of true deadlock where the election literally has to wait for multiple court decisions. Then I might take a break and wait. But that's pretty unlikely. It will probably be over tonight, effectively, when Biden takes Florida.

If we get a blue landslide (senate and presidency + no contest) I’m thinking we hit limit up as stimulus would begin at $2 trillion.
tastytrade.com will broadcast it at 7pm CST.
If Trump wins, twitter will drop. Social media regulation will be yuge
me
I'm balls deep in March $20 with a sprinkling of $30s

I just don't see it staying only 10% above IPO after a decent earning report

But I'll take some profit if the pre earnings run-up is stronger in the next few days
I’ll upvote you forever just for doing that
lol
I just watched a video of buildings getting boarded up in case of riots ( I think in DC?). Seems... fucked
Red wings or reefer madness, luckily I can have both.
Yes. In the event no merger takes place, you may cash out for $20. If a merger takes place and you do not want to participate, you may cash out for the IPO price of $20 per share.

In the scenario where Biden wins, is a Democrat sweep better or a Biden - Republican Senate better? For the market of course.

I don’t even vote dude lmao I think you worry too much friend. Honestly does it matter who is president? You can make money both ways, let people get riled up. I suggest you live in another country for an extended period of time. And when I say another country I don’t mean somewhere cushy like Europe, an actual third world country. When you go through actual stuff, you’re thankful to be here.

It helps that he was a model.
Either trolling or genuine mental disorder

Yup, that’s the risk! It’s like a losing option play that never leaves your brokerage. 95% of OTC plays are pump and dump trash. Fun to ride the pump on some, but very dangerous because they can be easily manipulated. There are always a few diamonds in the rough that are legit long holds though. If you hit an OTC winner early on, they can be literal millionaire makers. Hard part is finding the right one. Best feeling ever when you hit an OTC home run though (only done it once).
I'm in with various $ICLN 25C, 20C, 21C on different expirations. Shit liquidity forces you to get creative with your choice.

Exit polls only check the people who voted in person, this year that will be more Trump leaning because Biden voters are more concerned about the pandemic and are more likely to have voted by mail or early in person.

In short: be skeptical of exit polls.

2024 might be too early once people calm down from voting Trump out. It could be a swing state for a decade or so but yeah 2030s I bet it's perma-blue
It’s not ending yet imo. It might as well reach 50 before any real sell off. Maybe even higher.
If you read how it works, that proposal would also help the poors. Why would they vote against it?
Hillary was the wrong candidate. It seemed as if she felt entitled to the presidency. I wanted Biden to run back then. In 2016 I didn't vote for Trump nor did I vote for Hillary. 

Biden got my Cali vote. I voted all blue this year. I work with a guy who has an inflated ego. Trump reminds me too much of him.
I think we were pretty clear about how the market doesn’t like uncertainty

No matter who wins I can't wait for all the twitter videos of people crying and complaining lmao
They actually do ban republicans or being more specific they ban non neoliberals because lots of left leaning people do not agree with r/politics
MAGA BAN
Ann Richards was so funny. But for real we have Newt Gingrich to thank for the flip to the Republicans in TX and all over the south. 

We can have a Northam-style Dem party running Texas like they do in VA if only they can end the gerrymandering down there.

I agree they'll capitulate but the republicans stimmy will be like 500 bil. and that won't appease the markets
Its a bit deceptive. Varying degrees of lockdown have already been in effect for month(s). Gave a nice bit of momentum for MMs to bring the market down & re-enter pre-result though, so mission accomplished for them.
If California goes Red AND Texas goes blue, ban me.

And I mean once all the votes are counted, not tonight before mail-in ballots are collected and counted.
Nah, AOC is an electoral powerhouse so she'll be relevant in some capacity. She's just never going to be President. They'll give it to Kamala like they gave it to Joe over Bernie.

I have 500,000 shares from 2010 that I haven't been able to sell for 9 years...it's hell. I just stare at 99.99% down everyday and I can't ever get rid of it. If someone wants to buy 500,000 shares of SNRS from me for $0.0001 hit me up. This shit is aggravating. Current price is $0.000001.

People were voting on the idea of Trump. Now they are voting on his first 4 years.

Completely different ballgame.

Also hillary was like the least-liked democrat candidate in decades.

The final factor is that a lot of democrats stayed home last time, because they simply couldn't imagine that Trump could win, so they didn't get fired up. That's also a huge difference this year.

I don't think Dems will keep blocking Trump over stimmy. They'll eventually reach a compromise.
That is statistically true. You can flip a coin a 1000 times and it's still 50/50. Otherwise it's a gambler's fallacy (If I flipped head 4 times in a row, the 5th must be tails), which isn't true.

You just ignore how well Asia is doing? There are obvious ways to contain the virus without shutting down the economy.

Agreed. Something to remember is Zodiac is universally unliked and Beto ran a hell of a campaign. Had he not made AWB part of his platform I’d probably have given him my vote. End of the day this is Texas; we like our guns.

* When he does step down or rip, Harris is probably going to be bad.

Sure thing champ
Tried to go to mangos rally on Sunday in GA. Was turned away due to it being max capacity
the bear thesis for this election is strong, there's few outcomes that won't lead to red:

biden wins, takes senate, blue wave > huge stimmy will pass but that money won't go to corporations, it'll go to states, individuals and small businesses. Corporations will face big tax hikes, high earners will tax hikes, corporate gains tax will face a hike. Big tech potentially gets broken up. More regulations etc.

biden wins, senate remains red > no worry about tax hikes for the short term, but also no hope for stimmy passing and we know how baby reacts without his baa baa

trump wins, house remains blue > 4 more years of inept leadership, no stimmy, covid spirals out of control

no winner announced > market hates uncertainty

can anyone think of a realistic outcome the market won't react negatively to? 

hope you got your puts autists.
I wish there were public stats for how many bans /r/politics is going to give out tonight.  Place is going to meltdown when Trump wins again.
None of this nonsense relates to election results night of election. Dems have conceded every time. So have Repubs.

My middle school brother said at his school, it was 70% Biden vs 25% Trump (5% Green Party). And we live in a suburb that is definitely Republican leaning. Most middle schoolers aren't smart enough to know about the candidates so they definitely got some of their ideas from their parents.
MMs are DA DEVUL
Here is the poll for 🐄 vs 🐻 . Pleas submit your votes.

nope, free.  but if you hold shares it locks you out from doing anything while the transfer is taking place.  i couldn't do shit when the market was tanking last week
Were just here to shit talk and hope our bets come true. Dgaf about who wins really.
The only reason I went bearish today is because the fomc is meeting tomorrow and I don’t think it’s going to be good
Cant believe Im saying this, but he would have been a better nominee than Biden imho.
are you retards gonna buy all the toilet paper again

i had to blast my ass clean in the shower for like 3 months
If they’re short dated I think tomorrow will be high vix and then we will decrease
That could print..  Mine are all December or later...  If earnings crush, we'll both be sitting pretty
Expiry? BABA will recover to 400 in the next six months when this china bullshit goes away

Say goodbye to your 401k tax deduction and your 12k deduction on income tax. Biden's plan limits it to a deduction of 27% of your 401k contribution only

There are. 100s

Difference:

Chinese govt giving Nio contacts to supply them with EVs. And with their battery swap program things look promising
Without the elections I wouldn't even know Vermont exists.
Yup, MMEDF is solid. Could see multiple dollars in a year or two. My only other OTC plays right now are INQD and IGEN. Both sub penny right now, so no way they ever get to anything close to multiple dollars, but OTC plays are sometimes fun to buy a few million shares, stash them away, then hit a 50 bagger once in a while (or lose your ass, either way).

We're not even in the top 10 of fattest nations anymore lmao

But yea keep sticking to your outdated anecdote
I just watched most of it, 10sec skipped all the parts I have seen and remember. I have seen most of these before in full. I will agree there are cases here that the police went too far and those individuals should be held accountable. However, the majority of these were justified, once a riot has been declared and the crowd warned to disperse else physical violence will be used if they don't leave they get pushed and  beat. It is a simple concept to do as you are ordered by the police and you'll be fine

Right? Like would they rather have sold in the red, I’m confused
-100 now let’s go
I don't feel bad after the first time it happened.  Dude should've taken his people and founded a new party - the American Democrat Socialists.  All the radicals in the Dems would've joined which would have helped the Dems too as there wouldn't be any "Biden is a socialist" talk.

And sure, this would have basically guaranteed a Trump win in 2020, but Trump is probably winning anyway.  It would be better in the long-term though.

And that’s why people champion the Democratic Party for civil rights. I mean, it was a great political move by them, but most people don’t know LBJ’s comments regarding passing the Civil Rights Act of ‘64. It’s a shame really.
Would you? I mean I’m a fan but I wouldn’t.
There were some posters here that printed from it, but they were telling us to buy the calls like 2 weeks ago. In retrospect it was smart as fuck b/c VXX went from 22 to 27 pretty quick. Hopefully they sold in time tho
Thanks!
Went balls deep in BABA at the 9:45AM fire sale
VXX calls was a dumb choice.  Markets just chilling til the end of the year apparently
Actually I’m now -100
Not american and dont know who will win. Just someone poor from a shitty country who wants their calls to print. But I have a feeling mango’s will to win is much higher than sleepy. Seems biden is not that interested.

Anyone else here just waiting to see the 6PM CST election futures?
Yup. I’m a moderate and I’m socially liberal. My hyper-liberal friends always point to how other countries can operate with socialist policies.

I tend to agree with you. If I had to bet right now, I'd bet Texas goes trump.

That said, Beto got like 48%+ in the senate race, and senate races have far lower turnout. And, love him or hate him, Trump is driving turnout with his divisiveness. 

Id still bet red, but I honestly wouldn't be 100% shocked if it went blue. It'll be a fascinating one to watch for sure, and it's the state I'm most excited about seeing tonight.

I'm over here in GA, and it's a similar situation. It's actually going to be close, which is pretty crazy.
LOL every time he loses it’s someone else fault
The worst is his supporters - Bern at least got a summah cabin - they just keep getting bamboozled

More FD's. your next painting should have beautiful canyons and jagged peaks of granite
Okay I counted all of Pennsylvania’s votes by hand and I can report trump came out on top 420% to 69%
The air is electric. is nuts
I think AOC in her 20s would be awesome, but Ivanka is just awesome at any age.

E: any *legal* age.
That is because there is no breakdown of your income tax on your pay stub like in so many other countries (a lot of places require that). We pay about 65% of our taxes to military. Definitely seems like a bit too much.

Absolutely 100% horseshit, and it's literally never been done in the history of the united states. Which is why it got shot down, due to the precedent of "voter confidence."

If a state tells people how to vote, and people vote that way, you can't throw them out. Because it's not their fault that some county did something improperly. If the county did something wrong, fine them, or make sure they don't do it again, but you can't throw out votes that were cast as instructed.

They didn't, by the way. As the courts decided, they followed the law.

Republicans were trying to push a technicality that a tent isn't a "structure" to take away the right of 160,000 american citizens right to vote.

But, you did answer my question. As a republican, you support throwing out legitimate votes of your fellow citizens if it helps your side win. 

Thanks for the insight.

I fuckin love AOC. She’s intelligent, speaks well, good looking. Refreshing compared to the rest of Congress. She’s that liberal arts girl I couldn’t get cause I smoked too much pot.

Likely is going to be impossible for Trump to win. Biden will win back the states that didn't vote for Hilary because she was a Women and it will be impossible for him to win.

Couldn’t have possibly meant stand down could he? Especially since he’s condemned them more than any president with the exception of Lincoln maybe.
The conspiracy was that Biden will develop health issues and she will be the 1st woman pres.

!remindme 1 day
Trump wins = mass riots

Biden wins = mass shootings

Kanye wins = mass celebrations
Did you read why? It was a simple legalality based on Texas voting law. Before bitching read the whole story. Either side would have done it.
nah its about the raccoon tail
Imo it all depends on what the govt does in the next few days
Oh for sure. I just don’t think Texas has the numbers to flip just yet. And despite what the right screams about people from other states moving here, it’s mostly native texans like myself and 2nd generation immigrants that are turning things. The argument itself that its libs moving here is stupid and doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.

Anecdotal: my brother’s buddy is pretty well connected in the Dallas political scene and as a never Trump republican, he’s betting Trump by 1.5-2%.
Sigh. Wrong. Check the White House YT channel, they upload all of them.

Dude u still gained.
Yes, NIU is the electric scooter company. Don’t just look at share price, look at the market cap. That will give you a better idea of room to grow. NIO sitting at a market cap of almost $50 billion. NIU sitting at $2 billion. A lot of room to grow in the moped and scooter industry in Asia and Europe, which are huge markets right now. Good fundamentals and great products. Flying a bit under the radar right now, but will pick up steam in the next few months. Earnings coming out at end of November, and they have been great the last few quarters. I am holding some March 2021 calls, so probably a bit biased. But check them out.
I posted my comment when spy was 335 and said it would stay flat the rest of the day.
no
At this moment neither as I have no idea how the US Congress will be made up and good luck passing anything substantive regardless knowing their partisanship.

I’m mocking Reuters who report 4 times a day the index performance and always correlate it to stimulus talks
No it makes perfect sense, people are pretty damn sure Biden is going to win so all the money that was sitting on the sidelines (last time i checked was about 4 trillion) is coming back in.

Lol, what libertarian ideals? Tariffs? Take guns with due process later? Restricting access to press?
I feel like it was a baby squeeze from the market being green and Biden prospects. I thought about going short when it was around 21-23 so I bet there were others that have added to short interest the last couple weeks.
Am aware. He said he posted all positions yesterday. Couldn’t have known that was gonna happen
I do some weeks. I don't want to sell my shares thou... So I only do it after a big pop, sold 37c this Friday yesterday since it rallied 10%, and it's alrdy cutting close with election it's gotta comedown a bit lol, but yea 1k a week is nice

Trump has condemned bad whites more than Biden ever has.
Of joy
Immigrant, could give a shit about American politics. Frankly, I think shit is just so plebs can feel like they have a sense of power with their *vOiCe* while the rich keep getting richer. But I will say, I wouldn’t mind the meltdown if clementine wins. 😎
I’m going straight for GameStop to make my puts print! And I want an Xbox one (yes I’m still on that version!)
Donald Kamala tandem would be the shit
Trump is only 3 years younger than Biden.
I’ll be surprised if you get a rationale response. I don’t think people that loooove trump care about democracy. He is inherently anti democracy with his actions.
BABA’s Jack Ma is the Chinese equivalent to Musk.... Innovating and talking shit w/ the govt and ramping up volatility. Here hoping today was just his version of “price to high IMO”
No matter the outcome one thing is for sure. 

Trump Daddy will be insufferable after the election. 

If he wins he will gloat, take multiple victory laps and sink deeper into establishment republican/libertarian ideals. 

If he loses he will be on every news show possibly have his own and do nothing but talk shit about Joe Biden for the next 4 years.
You could be if you trained real hard.
I don’t think so. Why waste all that effort trying to throw out 100k ballots if it’s a clear republican win. Why spend all that time suppressing votes?
AL Flipping for the Senate sure but Donnie won easily 16. He'll lose MI WI PA maybe AZ OH FL. It's a rap only the Senate races are still interesting.

if Trump can draw 57000 people for his rally at Butler, PA and over 1k at every Trump rally. its hard for me to believe Orange Man gonna lose to Corn pop.

CGC and TLRY have earnings Friday. Sector is poised, bottom DEFS in. Just saying.
I know some smart people who are like that. They just got caught up in their parties propaganda machine. I think it does make someone seem less intelligent for not being aware of what's happening to other people they get angry at, could also be happening to them as well but from the opposite team.

Like if you watch Fox they act like Sleepy is gonna turn USA into soviet russia and you'll have to eat your dog. MSNBC acts like Trump is gonna gas the gays in minorities in his beautiful new concentration camps. Bothe scenarios are overblown and absurd but people really buy into it.

Legit non-loaded question to the republicans in this thread: how do you feel about the attempt to throw out 160,000 votes in Houston? Do you support it?

To me, seems like some unamerican shit to try to nullify americans' votes, regardless of your party. Wondering how republicans actually feel about it.
Where are you getting your news from just curious
That's exactly correct. All the maggots say the "plandemic" is just to make him look bad. All he had to do was pretend to be human for a little while and he would actually win in a landslide.

WTF?
Is that calls on Trump or calls on Biden?
All I know is my China mutual fund(tcelx) pumped almost 8% yesterday. Market makers must think Biden is going to win.
Imagine if Trump never inherited his wealth we would’ve never heard of him. We’d probably be working next to him at Wendy’s.
Pin this shit nigga
Ron Paul is. That makes him a clown. And that makes his book a joke.

He doesn't have a clue what the Federal Reserve does so him opining that he thinks it caused the depression -- while not mentioning the half dozen or so crashes and depressions that happened before the great depression in the late 19th century.

PLUS the great depression was under the gold standard. He's too fucking stupid to realize that.

But in his defense he sold this snake oil for *years* to gullible suckers, thus getting him in power and sucking off the government teat for ages while accomplishing nothing.
Well... He's going to make it great again, again. That second "again" is a key pillar of the GOP platform.
They did. The general perception of gyna is negative bcoz of the beer flu. 🍊 has no problem berating gyna and his supporters love that. Chaos is a ladder for a proper leader. 🍊 is mentally challenged so what to expect.

Also Gyna is much more populated and they managed to contain it, same goes for all the other Asian countries. Singapore, Hongkong are basically the most densely populated places on earth. Look at their numbers.
Gonna be sad to see Trump go from europoor perspective. guy provides me so much entertainment with his nonsense

.... No no. The store gets 10 labor hours for Black Friday. One of the fucking prizes is being able to have another person on shift for Black Friday.
Because the deadline for mail in ballots is November 10th and so there is a a chance someone can double vote. So they want to wait and count mail in ballots before they start counting in person votes. If the results are out by the 10th why do they need to count in person votes.

Reminder: the end of voting is tonight, but the election isn’t over. Whatever counts are announced tonight could change over the next several days as mail in ballots are counted (some states have laws forbidding them from being counted until Election Day). Plus, if there’s any controversy the process could last up until December (when the electors meet) and possibly even after. 

My advice: the presidential election is not what to watch. Pay attention to the Senate races. If the GOP loses the Senate, then you can be pretty certain how everything turns out. If the GOP retains the Senate, then things could get dicey. 

Also, there is at least one Senate race that is virtually guaranteed to a runoff. Loeffler in GA has a ton of candidates and likely won’t be resolved tonight (or even this week).
Well mango tried to legalize discrimination against LGBT, they aren’t wrong...

Much smaller. He sounded worried on one interview said he didn’t have a victory speech planned
These voter analysis polls on Fox News is hilarious. Something you would see on CNN.
That’s probably not an unfair statement. What also should be considered in the OP is Trump and the GOP were handed a well-oiled machine, then put the fucker in 6th gear and redlined it to the point of throwing a rod through unnecessary tax cuts.
It literally would not be as bad if trump didn't politicize mask wearing and avoiding crowds. The dumbest 30% of our population believes mask wearing is a democrat thing now. Instead of being a leader/proponent of national guidelines, he's also encouraged the dumbest governors to open everything prematurely.... Leading us into the worst possible positioning for this winter, according to Fauci, who he also politicized.
Its a joke fking idiot

Imagine if you bought calls instead
Honestly you basically have a coin-toss at this point.

The fact that republicans fought so hard to try to throw out 160,000 democrat votes in Houston shows they know how fucking close it is.

Don’t put all your eggs into weekly spreads for one underlying. I used to do this (95% success rate!) and got amazing returns until that one time you finally hit the 5% failure rate and you get wiped out. Now I do a ton of spreads on a wide variety of stocks so that a single loser doesn’t wipe me out.

It happened 4 years ago when President Trump came into office. All the Democrats were saying it was Russian meddling and stuff like that, but it was never proven. In my opinion, I believe President Trump will be reelected.

Lol. You think cities are boarding up in fear of a Biden win? Right.
Even if they did it would be chalked up as fake news and people would argue amongst each other while the person who did it setup the next city for destruction.

New Zealand, Australia, Germany, Canada, Norway, and many more are doing far better than the US. Still, you have a point, the perception of Trump's performance could've changed if he had embraced the science (and could've saved a few lives along the way).

True.

its gonna dump
you guys are looking at it the wrong way. The stimulus is good. But the real strength of that v shaped rally was because of how much money went to The Fed. With no oversight committee it was just a slush fund to prop up the markets.

Do you really think the same thing is gonna happen again? I would wager that the reason Pelosi couldn't come to a deal was because Mnuchin wanted the same kinda deal as last time. markets will bounce on stimulus news sure. but not like you're thinking.

People seem to forget about the shy trumper.....
Old boomers. Get tf out of my way when I'm driving, shopping for groceries, literally anywhere
Fuck that bitch
Oh take this award tard-o
Is he up tho
I got $1000 on Biden winning Texas. Am I boned or what?
My presidental proposal.......

We should use taxpayer dollars to trade options, so that we can pay off the national debt, pay for healthcare, and for college.
I just remember him going, "Hillary ain't gonna win it" on MSNBC four years ago and Maddow looking like she smelled his dick
All in on BABA calls....  Seriously all in...  Now I'm scared
A bit worried...but as a doc I know insurance reimbursements will still be yuge...and holding clean energy LEAPS...I'll be aight.
 i have no clue

i really dont give a shit about how i look though

too lazy to care
Oh man. I want that so bad. Lay that fraud bare.
Nah, Riots are happening regardless.

The Hillary protesters rioted in 16 even tho they showed up to protest her election.

They just want to burn shit and they'll make an excuse

Almost as bold as the guy who sold his house to buy NIO shares
Just show some photo of him rolling up the sleeve and carrying some boxes around with a caption 'fighting pandemic'. His supporters would have sucked it up. But he is all about winning. So lets see if he goes full RREEEEE today.
The open interest on spxs 11/20 contracts  is fucking insane holy smokes lol
Wouldn't it be great if people could stop electing senior citizens to be president. They should be playing bingo or golf or whatever old fucks do
I think Trump will win and I bought puts.
Reminder! wsb poll
https://strawpoll.com/2oobxpz3p
Wtf why they tracking me?
loud minority
In what scenario would that happen though?  Biden being a clear winner and Trump throwing a fit even before all votes are counted even though it wouldn't make a difference?  

Trump clearly winning?  Figured that'd make it go up myself

It being a close election and now we have to wait for all mail in votes to be counted and it takes days, possibly weeks?  Sounds like that wouldn't hurt tomorrow too bad but maybe a slow bleed?  

I put 1k on SPY puts near the close today at 339 and 336 expiring tomorrow and even I'm questioning in what scenario am I going to print here and ready to lose it all.

Wait UVXY always will go down long term. That's actually a known fact. Take a look at it from 2010. It reverse splits a lot to keep the price in the same range but if you take out the reverse splits it will drop long term (it's actually in the prospectus - this and VXX will say "it goes to 0 long term"). 

The SVXY drop is different. It dropped in 1 day not long term. Basically VIX temporarily went over 100 on a day in February 2018. I believe if you google something like 2018 volmageddon, you'll find some articles about it.

im pretty sure  most of this sub dont give a shit bout who wins

Not going to affect the market for sure

any one of these protests could get angry. Weather is supposed be nice on Wed, thurs, and Friday
Do rednecks bawl?
Thanks!  Appreciate it
Alexa play I still believe by vince gill
Don't put that evil on me
Tell yourself that 😂
genuinely asking, why do you think that's the case? I would imagine a Biden admin would be much more friendly to solar than Trump. Biden doesn't have to win Texas
Dont leave us hanging, what's the link?
Or maybe this is the one place that isn’t a echo chamber ?
GME 15 eow 🤞
TSLA boiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I said THOSE cages. Not just any cages but those at detention facilities dipshit.
Thanks for posting that. Very heartfelt, Glad I voted for him.
Hope you did 🤙
I think a trump win, we’ll still see Biden contesting the election
15k USD in SPY calls, 100x leverage..  


Am I stupid?
Have you seen this election? The blatant voter suppression is sickening, the right to vote in a fair election is a huge one

His conservative judges are now set to remove the rights for healthcare, gay marriage and choice

The right to justice and fair trial regardless of the colour of your skin

The right to information and free speech, he’s already said fauchi is on the chopping block if he wins. He actively downplays or straight removes anyone who opposes him.
Forever?? No one will care once he’s out of office, not even him
This is the only DD I needed to remind myself that NIO puts was a good idea.
All of them over the next 4 years probably
Fuck both candidates just give us a clear winner so we can rocket
Just wait, trump wins in landslide, SPY hits 420 couple hours later. Fuckin book it
That’s right. Stocks are first priority and riots are bad for stocks
GG Portland
SUPN +15% AH🤙
This meme is so fucking bad its fucking great
Regarding the beer virus, everybody fucked up. Including Europoors. Only the Asians (Koreans, Japanese, Singapore) did good. Learn from the Asians. They have strict mask mandate and social distancing which the people actually follow. Also do you hear any protest against mask wearing in Asia?

But it doesn't matter. 🍊 could have easily done a huge PR stunt running around doing photo-op fighting the pandemic. Showing his face blaming gyna (which he has no problem doing) would have done wonders. But instead he was like if you bury your head in the sand there is no pandemic. Also no mask extreme right, against health officials approach might have costed him this election.
[deleted]
It doesn't. These people are retarded and have no idea what they're talking about.
Thou I have to say, $30 calls didn't even exist back then, like would if I bought $15 calls, would I have been making the same amount of money? Don't fully understand the Greeks yet.
QCOM and INTC puts. 100% AAPL sells their chips to other laptop/desktop makers.
I normally post anti trump memes on social media. but today was the first time the trumpsters took it personally. Biden confirmed
SBE
Just about every blue one
Seeking endorsements from Soundcloud rappers to begin with is desperate and embarrassing. Then you have to go and boomer up the name when you pull them on stage. lol what a buffoon
I think cannabis and gun stocks cover pretty much both scenarios
I dropped 1% of my portfolio on a bottle of wine. $4 wine isn’t too bad
SF for sure
I was planning on becoming a millionaire by 2022, but if Biden wins I think I’m going to just ride this local government $65k/yr job out until retirement.  

Not worth paying the extra taxes.
do trump supporters here actually just want america to fail faster or do yall think he's genuinely done a good job?
Sure but National guard doesnt mean marital law.

Theyre just getting ready for antifa/BLM protests that usually end up with looting and fires
LOOL I meant I need someone declared the winner tonight
Step one.  Change name

Step two. Run for office.
agreed
no im saying likely trump win and rioters/looter demo protests
Thought so! Let me guess, it's all fraud and fake news when Biden wins.
Ummm don't forget about a massive crash...I assume we'd be up way more if that didn't happen.
How is everyone positioned for tomorrow?  Upvote Long. Downvote Short.
Hows the vibe in here? For real Biden is such a favourite he has to win it right
Operating margins across the country are quite strong because of all the layoffs.
Uvxy calls checking in
Pot stocks... supposedly therell be quicker legalization of MJ under a Biden win
So you’re making a lot of bad decisions like any other dummy with money lmao
Nah i think texas will be sleepy
But that’s logical so maybe down
Biden = stability, covid management, stimulus = green.
Let’s go joe you sleepy fuck!!  Make my ICLN print
Bruh did you not see any of the daily press conferences from Trump? Lol. They were from March until August afaik everyday
Diamond hands
So how many cities are going to burn down if Trump wins?
So consensus is Trump win = riots + green market. Biden win = Trump contesting election integrity forever + red market.
Ur legit retarded lmao

It is too cold to riot
What happened to him and the Trump Towers in Chicago isn’t unheard of. It happens from time to time. Sometimes banks go fuck it, it might be better to let this loser keep it than to lose even more money trying to sell it to another party.
It worked fine for Fred Flintstone
will be -20% tomorrow
Yeah what explained to me how mango got into office was the fact that 48% of people believe in ghosts. Damn some people are fucking stupid
Isnt NIO chinese backed? No way to go red right now.
I have seen 2 posts on FB of Trumpets promising to "take the country by force" if Biden wins.
Yes
Fuck you
It's okay, nio gains make everything else looks like pennies
Yep confirmed.  That's the smallest pee pee I've ever seen and it's already gooey too.
We won't. No bike locks beating the shit out of Biden supporters just because they support an opposite candidate either.

I don’t know about that, something had to get it started. Especially a run up to strong resistance of 338, bleed out and then run up to 338 and then sharp drop. That shit smells like manipulation

Florida is leaning red. And with the amount of hispanic and latinos for Trump are gonna make it tough.

Tim apple can eat a dick!
I'm going to smash all my windows if mango steals it
Haha I was just kidding. Although I'm not a big MAGA fan honestly
Not if you’re smart... Anyone find out who dropped off the pallets of bricks down city streets across the country during the protests a couple months back?
Are you saying they should have run Hillary again? Lol

Absolutely a possibility. If Biden wins TX, gg
How did this number go up? Earlier in the year it was around 30. JFC what has happened to my country????
Uhm, I'm sure you don't need to declare martial law if counting the votes takes more than a few hours.

You can use his name in this thread you know
IPA
The market just wants a clear winner. I doubt it truly care much which one. 

What it doesn't want is uncertainty for days or weeks.

So if we get a solid winner tonight, it's up tomorrow.
Oh nice. Good luck bro
Yeah you were.  I certainly wasn’t going to bet against it.
I’m somehow still in the green thanks to Nio. Should I liquidate everything and go cash gang? Market may tank tomorrow
Just weird it was up today and all of sudden started going down
Damn that is easy money

No everybody fucked up. Including Europoors. Only the Asians (Koreans, Japanese, Singapore) did good. Learn from the Asians. They have strict mask mandate and social distancing which the people actually follow. Also do you hear any protest against mask wearing in Asia?

If we limit down tomorrow, I’m going to give out a few gift cards for chicken nuggies.
Assuming Mango loses, that Deutsche Bank story will be interesting to watch unfold.
Looking at the weekly chart, SPY closed directly below the 9 week moving average of 336.7.  Seems to be a strong area of support/resistance. 

Could be interesting if it gets rejected
Hes not big enough, hes Hillary Clintons corpse puppet like that horror movie dead silence
Trump's lackey's may successfully suppress enough votes across the country to tilt it his way, you mean.
Do you think their would actually be hardcore riot if either one of them win?
Somewhere around there, Florida should be called about 9pm unless it’s tight.
Apparently not....

Me too I went to the electric college, I know all about it.
NO, we weren't. That's whole point. 

Tons of people were out of work, underpaid, limited potential, slowing economic growth.

BUT there was the LOWEST Black unemployment ever!!!!

Just because Black people had the highest number of jobs ever at walmart and mcdonalds doesn't mean people (black or white or asian) etc are actually making any money.

A "job" doesn't mean making money. 

Minimum wage is the lowest "actual" value money its ever been. 

Hardly anyone anywhere can afford a 1 bedroom apart. 

How you grow an economy is simple, pay people, the poorest people, more money. Then unsurprisingly, they spend all that money. Then that money gets spent by the people who got that money for goods and services spend it, and then next people spent again and again. 

And that creates expansion. This creates demand. Demand, demands more supply, demand for supply creates demand for factories and labor and jobs and good paying jobs. 

That results in companies being formed and stocks going up. 

Tickle down economics is for idiots who don't know how economics works. 

Its all about trickle up economics.
What is this? An IPO for ANT?
If Biden wins Florida or Texas it doesn't matter who PA votes for. Biden will be the winner tonight.
Bro. They are returning the ANT ipo money to investors. It’s literally done. Not “in waiting” like it’s entirely cancelled. MAYBE some time in the next two years we will see the IPO or maybe never again. It’s done for now.

Pennsylvania has said it wont declare winner for 3 days.

And AG said "even if all the votes are counted trump cant win"

Which is some political fuckery, and is gonna call the state into question.

From that point. News outlets have said they might not declare a winner tonight.

We WILL NOT KNOW WHO WON.  And national guard has been deployed in areas that are expecting riots.

This means continuously selling small and closer to expiration call and put credit spreads around your positions to eliminate your max pain risk and also make up for any liquidity issues in the near term.

&#x200B;

Because this is an extremely bullish view on XME, in the short term you could sell weekly call credit spreads or put credit spreads (iron condor) in strikes that have deltas at around 0.10. This allows you to slowly offset your financial exposures.

Let’s be real, we’re all too retarded to really understand this book
>Your rare examples

Yours was a rare example. Out of the millions and millions of BLM protestors, what % were burning down buildings? If they were all burning down buildings, the US would literally have no more buildings.

A handful of buildings set ablaze as a result of tens of millions of people protesting. So, probably like 0.0000001% of the protestors were rioting, if you do the math. Yet you are calling every single one of then rioters. 

There are thousands of videos of mass gatherings of protests being peaceful, yet you only see the video where some dude smashes a window. 

Youre just biased.


>the MAGA crowd acted like that I'd call em out too.

Imagine being a pussy.
DNC choosing to nominate a VP candidate that received exactly zero delegates. In my mind, this VP candidate is more important than in any other recent year given Biden won't be running the country. For a frame of reference, the democratic populace was more interested in Gabbard who won one  delegate. They pulled this shit (not listening to voters) in 2016 and are pulling it again in 2020.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...

Biden Bump; Sleepy Slump?

If you were billions of dollars short the market tonight, why wouldn’t you spend tens of millions on grassroots campaigns to instigate violence and civil warfare? (Ie fund radical groups to take the first shots, etc.).
That would be quite nice
This is an excellent question yo.  I wish I was drunk right now to answer it properly.

If you want to long SVXY long term, it would benefit if there was a slow drop - flat movement of VIX over time. Basically you don't want any VIX spikes. 

Zoom out max years on SVXY. 2016-2018 is where there was just a slow drop - flat VIX and that's how SVXY went up so much. 

Then you had the volpocalypse in Feb 2018 and SVXY lost basically everything. You pretty much should never be long SVXY for more than 2 weeks. 2016-18 was a huge exception and is not normal.
Just because they failed doesn't mean they didn't try. They've been bringing every lawsuit they can and trumps been railing against mail in voting for months.

Here, I'll post it again:

Over the last fifty years, economists have settled on some very broad areas of consensus. The first is, as famous libertarian monetary economist Milton Friedman wrote, "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". When the supply of money outstrips the demand, prices rise. And this is by no means limited to fiat currencies; see the great Spanish inflation of the 16th & 17th centuries, thanks to the steady influx of gold from the New World. Or check out the price of basic commodities in mining towns during the Gold Rush, when all anyone had was gold.

The second is that a little bit of inflation is okay--possibly even beneficial, since it helps the economy to overcome the problem of sticky wages when the relative value of labour has fallen. But a lot of inflation is very, very bad. Exhibit A is Zimbabwe; Exhibits B-∞ are every other economy that has had inflation near or above the double-digit mark; the higher the inflation, the worse the economy did. The feeling that the currency will experience an unpredictable amount of inflation dampens the willingness of the citizens to save and invest, which is why so many third-world loans are denominated in dollars.

The third is that deflation is also bad, and at the lower percentage values, often even worse than inflation. This surprises/offends/meets with the frank disbelief of many "sound money" types, who think that, barring local shortage, in an ideal world everything ought to cost the same or less than it did when Grandpa was a boy. (These sorts of opinions are cemented further by the fact that Grandpa, who is often the source of them, is usually living on a fixed income, and therefore feels that he would make out better in a deflationary economy.) The problem is, deflation does rather devastating things to anyone who has debt, since they now have to repay what they borrowed in more expensive dollars. Deflation means that, thanks to the abovementioned sticky wages, the economy has to deal with demand shocks by lowering output. Deflation can result in what's known as a liquidity trap, a concept pioneered by liberal economist John Maynard Keynes and best elucidated by liberal economist Paul Krugman back before he left economics writing to focus on his hatred of George W. Bush. Deflation is what made the Great Depression so memorable. Deflation is so bad that almost everyone agrees that moderate inflation, in the range of 1-2%, is better than risking even a small amount of deflation.

And no, it's not Ron Paul's childlike religion of "free markets" that makes him a racist -- he's a well known racist and has been for decades. 

And the gold standard is *by definition* deflationary.

My kids school voted 82% Trump and 18% Biden.   2nd graders have their shit together more than most of the tards on this sub.... Not surprising actually.

Yes, that's why you take hundred of polls and combine all the data to create a very large sample size and remove as much bias as possible. You cannot ever predict the future, but statistics are a very accurate science.

It's so clear that some of you people have never taken a statistics class. You think people just walk around asking people who they are voting for and tally checkmarks, lmao.

There are very accurate mathematical ways to test how accurate a sample will apply to a larger population, and when you have hundreds of samples, you can make very accurate predictions. This is why 2016 was an extreme outlier, as presidential polls, historically, are almost always right.

Yes, some people will just straight up lie in a survey, but any decent model will control for that. 

I have a degree in statistics and am fluent in R data modeling, and it irks me to no end when people have no faith in statistics but also have no idea how it works. They just distrust it based on a gut feeling or some shit

It's not analysis. It's a throwaway comment but if you look at pretty much everything this sub hyped at the IPO stage palantir did absolutely nothing in comparison. For a company that's all about tech (data manipulation/consolidation/analysis) and government contracts I'd say a 5% drop from its IPO is an extremely lukewarm reaction from the market.

Looking at the chart she's definitely chugging away so I wouldn't be too worried about any options/shares you have (unless the options are retarded like 11/10 30c or some shit).

Compound decay. They aren't inverses of each other. If VIX (which is what all the products are related to) goes from 15 to 50 and then back to 15, SVXY is fucked.

Think about it as you have 1k. You lose 90% of it but then you make back 300%. You still only have way less than 1k. It's a "similar idea" with SVXY but then you add in the daily decay along with it and it's basically a product you should never hold for more than 2 weeks.

I have never seen discussion happen on wallstreetbets
(  •  Y  •  )
forget amazon, the big banks upgraded it, so you know they already unloaded their bags

just buy spy or the ex-spac energy stocks

if you want leverage just do /es
Just do 3 quick 3 baggers, much easier haha. But hopefully this can be the 10 bagger for you 🙏🏻
"Little pimp" 🤣
I think this sub is like 20% Trump, 10% Biden, and 70% doesn't give a fuck.
Fine by me since I’m riding theta for the election with a 345c I sold that expires tomorrow

Curious: What caused you to switch parties?
what election coverage are you guys watching rn?
Add a 🇷🇺 flag next to mango you mean
It isn’t I got downvoted for my support, Reddit only likes dems
Alright, which one of you did this
Send him this way so we can help knock off about 5 zeros.
He sounded very defeated last night and today. He has no platform. He has no plans. He has no accomplishments. America has failed the address the pandemic. He never wanted the job and now only wants it to avoid criminal charges.

I was banned from r/nba because I said i was voting for Trump.

Reddit is a leftist echochamber
Owner of blacked.com thank you
More than just President on the ballots. And honestly, I'm in a solid blue state. If I was in PA or something I'd probably go Biden because

But I'd hold my fucking nose doing it
BMW is scar
CAN YOU TAKE MEEEE HIGHERRRRRR

What are you talking about Trump is the worst for spreading disinformation and denial of truth. He’s all about shitting on your rights and freedoms. There’s a reason ANTIFA is riled up for the first time ever and that because he’s trying to be a facist dictator and we all know how those end. If you really want an Orwellian nightmare vote for Trump, you’ll never see another election.
Ok now I'm worried
Perfect setup for a ER moon
Doesn't protect him from the States though.
No good bookie in Canada. I'm in on Trump but was not able to put size in it.
Is tonight going to be the episode where they're in a stance powering up, and you have to wait another week to actually watch the fight?

I anticipate this to be exactly to be like DBZ... you expect to tune in to watch the showdown, and they're just smack talking all night powering up their kamehamehas.
Loses constantly. Gets cucked throughout. Bets on two colors. Regarded as a genius.
Do you even know how fibs work? Or are you just drawing stuff
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaand SPY is green
tis is life
Not really. Early Oct was crazy uppied
Yeah it’ll continue its run til eod Friday
If you're willing to bet this, probably for the best you don't reproduce anyways
Couldn’t the under-allocation to that they point to be attributed to pension fund mandates and low boomer risk tolerance? 

They cite lower compared to historical allocations, but boomers also got older and hold all the wealth.
Nah. He issued a cease and desist to his campaign and Trump responded by threatening to sue him for using his name  in the song and uncollected royalties. Mac didn’t win anything.

Honestly sad how you can’t even talk about trump on Reddit without getting downvoted, kinda makes me hate dems even more now lol
where did you bet at?
My buddy's got Goodyear on 'em.  Fight me.
You’re braindead if you seriously think the chance polls give are accurate enough to compare to a die roll. There’s bias in whose chosen for polling and bias in who responds to polls. Not to mention the people who purposely lie on them. Polls don’t do nearly a good enough job in representing the population

Come on cannabis stocks
Nope, a covered call is a call you've sold (you're short that call) but you own the underlying stock to sell if the call you're short gets exercised. 

Being long a naked call is just buying a call. 

Being short a naked call is selling the call, without owning the underlying shares. Being short naked calls is the options play with the highest theoretical risk, since no matter what the stock jumps to, you have to buy the shares, and then sell them at the price of the call you're short.

Everything is the same for puts, except that there are no covered puts, instead there are cash secured puts, which means you have enough money to buy the shares at the strike price you sold the put for.

And a naked short put is theoretically less dangerous than a naked short call, since a stock can only drop to 0.

ive got $40 ridin on biden lets goooooo

There is definitely going to be some unrest, some rioting, a few incidents tonight and the next few days. But the only people who think a "civil war" is coming are fat rednecks living in the woods who don't live close enough to anyone they can fight, and a bunch of 18 year old self-proclaimed commies who are actually just larpers and will run at the first time they get tear gassed. Life will go on and we'll all continue to lose money
Same in 2016 as well. I just refuse to give into this garbage of "lesser of 2 evils". Trump is trash, but im no Biden fan either.

Give me a real choice in 4 years please
Don’t talk dirty to me like that

just shoot through the sack instead
Dude, I just couldn't do it. I'm on the wrong side of the gamble like 80% of the time.
Feels like I’m going to be vexed by retarded pumps all night long again

Content does not matter, its all about tricking a retard to click the article, see useless info and  few adverts(how they make money from you). No one has any information to whisper to you. Fools reed daily articles by their flavour to enforce the feeling that they are right.
Tp out again
I had 1 spy put which got obliterated. I went bicurious 🌈  🐻 and I deserve all these losses. Sorry guys.

#\#ICantBearAnymore
it depends  on your strategy. If you held it all last week it would  have been wise because it slowly grew from monday to  friday as the market performed poorly. 

I  would  say a week is  probably  max for my comfort level. Buying shares  or calls on VIX tickers is the same as buying  puts on  SPY or QQQ. If you're more comfortable with that  then  maybe that's the best  thing  to  do.
Lol bro
**Important:**

The **day** after GW Bush election day, QQQ dropped 5.4%.

The **day** after Obama election day, QQQ dropped 5.5%.
Noooooo. What are we going to do?! This place won't be the same.

But Harris was a prosecutor so you get them rioters in jail
Social media amplifies retardedness
puts on the news if trump is done.  one thing about "sleepy" joe biden is that news stories about him will put you to sleep
Imagine buying puts.
It doesn’t even matter who wins, this thread is going to have some salty ass fucks in here that I can’t wait to laugh at
At least one of the candidates has some policies and plans instead of empty, though very catchy, slogans
shorting vol, if it sells i win, if it moons i win too

My man!
Well you can't trust every poll. Some polls are absolute garbage.

But also wasn't that like way before the election? It was probably accurate-ish at the time. He gained massive ground in the weeks running up to election day.

I remember checking fivethirtyeight and the odds weren't that crazy leading into election day.
Yeah most retards like him
I don’t think you’re the only one
Nice
Your rare examples amount to public nucience, and a case of road rage though. The other side is by the literal dictionary definition conducting acts of terror. They are also destroying black communites and businesses, gang bashing anyone who disagrees with them. Stealing looting, and it goes on every night for months.

I'm not American, I'm watching for the sidelines and appalled people are making excuses for this behaviour. If the MAGA crowd acted like that I'd call em out too. Nobody should be able to break the law with impunity.
It's for investment retards though, not gambling retards.
Isnt he already the presumed winner? I would think a reversal would buck the current market trend.
Looks like I'm fucked
Some of us are not so strong...
Jamal is so high right now .. he’s going to skip right through elections without voting but his speech about how the system is rigged will be for the ages.. and will repeat every time that blunt is hit

Normal elections don't cause any significant market movement afterward but this one feels real fucking special.
VIX gods — if UVXY is near its pre-covid levels, and if SVXY is the inverse of UVXY, why is SVXY so far off its pre-covid levels?
$4C before the 12:1 reverse split is like $48C today. Very far OTM and not surprisingly, worthless. Are you sure that’s what you bought?
A a large number of my close friends and some family members all tested positive for corona in the last week. After i went this whole time since March and I barely knew anyone with it. This shit is gonna explode after Election Day.
No. Sad. At. All.

amd did purchase them.  at a bad price.  at an awful conversion rate.  at the stock's expense.

great deal for xlnx shareholders/autists with calls.  

awful assraping for amd share/callholders
I'm not sure if he can top the ridiculous shit Trump has said the last 4 years but sometimes I think he's definitely going to try
Is it though?

Higher voter turnout for me means. Last election ppl are not so enthusiastic about hilldog and all the poll shows she winning so why care. And 🍊 did the rug pull on all the lazies and pollsters. 

So this election eventhough ppl are not enthusiastic about 😴 they are showing up to vote. 🍊 did fumble the pandemic.

Whats your thoughts?

Most certainly Biden. The largest group of voters in 2016 was people that didn't vote at all. Then Hillary. And then Trump in 3rd. (Going by popular vote). A lot of people that sat out because they hated Hillary are more chill with Biden

Yeah I looked at 5 races and the incumbent Republican was a big favorite maybe the rest are closer
Bye bye Trump. Cause a scene, I want the crash
Wow 🥭 looks like he thinks he's done honestly. It's kinda sad in a way
You dipshits always go to that one when in fact nobody is saying that. What people identify as and what they biologically are are obviously two different things. One is science and one is a feeling. Teaching kids that people are different and we shouldn’t be shitty to them just because of that isn’t brainwashing either, it’s just not being an asshole. 

Try to keep up.
would be fucking hilarious if they buy back in now and we get another crash

sad, but hilarious
It doesn't man, his school started remote for a month and we can tell it wasn't gonna cut it so as soon as they set up to open we went in. Hes young only kindergarten but nothing like having a teacher. Plus hes tired of me teaching his ass for the pas few years lol
Not at all.
REMEMBER WHO BUILT THE CAGES!
How much we talking

Ah the ‘ol paper hands leading to a paper divorce
This is pretty terrible analysis. It’s already trading at like 5 year future value. I’d say ws is pretty hot on it.
I think it was more bemoaning the fact the electoral college voted for the wrong candidate again.  I would understand it if Donald Trump was smarter or better-looking than Hillary, it was just the fact he weaponized facebook to win that really irks me.
if you've had chicken pox then the herpes virus is already inside you!

i support this movement
i hope msnbc goes out of business after mango.  they can wring their hands all they want in front of the camera but I bet the ad revenues are pretty good these days.  I wonder if Maddow et all got fat contract extensions in the last 4 years.
Wow is that a Lamborghini or Ferrari
It’s actually been green all month. We only 2 days in
Their just doing this for clicks and publicity. That would imply trillions of dollars of inflow into the overall market, which is unlikely given overall volume has been down since March when compared to the same time period in 2019.
just need some positive news for the challenger and AH will tank
[deleted]
Sure it may have mixed reviews but it’s a platform which actually empowers individuals. Some thing 95% of stocks on the market don’t do with the exception of Uber etc.
I mean my personal opinion is that the email scandal like 2 days before the election fucked up everything and made the previous polls obsolete. And that the polls were far more accurate before that. 

But I really don't wanna get into all that.
you gonna sell any options with that?
this is better than any movie

QCOM earnings tomorrow AH

Lots of unusual whale call buying activity yesterday and today that went under the radar

FTC lost bid to revive antitrust case vs Qualcomm

QCOM's new 5nm chip leaked benchmark AnTuTu test revealed that the 875 chip reached a score of 847,000 points. Significantly higher than Apple's A14 Bionic at only 572,133 points.

QCOM's founder, former chairman, and largest shareholder Irwin Jacobs is a democratic super donor.

If the economy falls apart then there is no market. 

Trump doesn't have the mental capacity to create a growing successful economy.

And I'm just basing this off all the people he keeps hiring and then firing like two weeks later. 

Like DUDE just hire actual smart people and ask them questions and then use what they say. He literally hires idiots and then argues  with them when he is in meetings like he is the smartest person in the room. 

That's not how you successfully lead anything. You want to be the LEAST smart person in the room, not a not-smart person, but have your advisors be even smarter than you. 

Then listen to them. 

So, simply TWO things Trump is bad at are actually hiring smart/good people as advisors and listening to them in meetings.

That's how you get a faltering economy, which results in a faltering stock market.
If Coty reports a decent quarter on November 6 and there's vaccine news this month, its going to ramp up to $6+ again in short time. Nordstrom probably $20+ again. And Pfizer calls because that's who I am betting on comes out with the best news first. This industry in stocks are still incredibly hammered but I dont think its as bad as the prices reflect.

COTY Jan $4c

PFE March $41c

JWN Jan $17.5c

tech salaries have gone up because of the stock market bull run -- FAANG which pays heavily in stocks which have relatively mooned, and then other firms competing for talent and driving salaries up valley-wide. for example, FB stock was $26 in 2013, now its $260. thats why you can make 350k as a 27 year old at facebook rn, and why Lyft or whatever will pay that much as well (because they have to compete)

pretty sure the stock market bull run is continuation from Obama, not anything Trump policy related. 

so im a bit confused at what you mean, what exact policies are you talking about?

also you completely dodged my question. please answer it

You think saying "its vapid and wrong" is a detailed critique? 

>Here's another point, and I can keep them coming at you: Let's say that we're in deflation like your ideal world of Ron "I'mafuckingracistclown" Paul. But let's pretend for a moment that a vagina doctor was right about economics

Hey dipshit, in the book he says deflation is a bad thing. Idk if you know this, but the federal reserve thought deflation was a good thing and that's what made the Great Depression so bad at the start. 

Idk how believing in free markets and freedom makes someone racist. Oh, you must be a lefty. That's the only way someone can make such a leap.

What's the opposite of confirmation bias? It fell from 90 a few weeks ago for pretty much no reason and has been hovering around 60 since. I'd say the major factor is whether or not it does well on earnings (Nov. 17).

Yo real talk people who think Trump is gonna win because the pOlLls WeRe WrOnG lAsT tImE are legit braindead. They weren't wrong, the less likely event just happened. If someone gives Trump a 40% chance of winning, it's not "wrong" when he wins. He had a 40% chance.


Let's say I have a 10-sided die and 8 of the 10 sides are painted blue. 2 of the 10 sides are red. 

I'd tell you "there's an 80% chance this lands on blue."

If I rolled it and it landed on red, you retards would literally bet that it lands on red the next time because "statistics were wrong last time!"

Oouch. Hope it bounces back. Good luck buddy.
Got £500 on Biden but for my stocks I'm sure Trump will be better for me.. dont mind either way as a UK resident.
Might crash tomorrow due to a contested election so I suppose we will all see.  Medium term the market will rise as regardless as who wins we will get stimulus and a vaccine in the coming months.
Let it be so--I have SPXS calls and UVXY puts, and having my play and my hedge both hit would be a real gift.  Which candidate must I vote for to see this happen?

Blm doesnt care about anything bad that happens to black people literally they say they only care about police brutality but most black people appreciate police in their community

In addition, investing heavily in green energy infrastructure will lower our energy cost over time and cement our status as the best economy for another 50 years

I just had a retard moment. 

Wouldnt it make more sense to sift thru calls when writing calls? Like look for OTM calls that have a decent BID with Low Open Interest and Low Volume and then buy to close when that option is worth shit because of bad option performance, pocketing the difference?

True story, 2008

Got pulled over twice within 20 minutes for speeding on I-80 on my way back to Notre Dame from PA around 2:00am after Christmas vacation.  Smoked pot 5-10 minutes before EACH pull over I kid you not. 

The first guy let me off with a warning, citing how Ohio St beat ND in football and he feels bad for me. 

The second guy, after coming back to my car, asked “Did you get pulled over in Ohio already today?”

To which I responded, “Yes, sir, about 20 minutes ago”.   He also let me off. Couldn’t believe it.  They obviously weren’t hunting for white college students. 

I always thought cops in Ohio were such assholes but those guys were cool.
From reading these comments, it's clear you are all as good at predicting election outcomes as you are at predicting whether the market will go up or down tomorrow.

Real question is will Trump have a temper tantrum and attempt to crash the markets on purpose.
That was really funny.
I wonder if there's a large correlation between peoples political beliefs and their investments

Dems seem to prefer tech, whereast Boomer Repubs all seem to be in travel, energy or oil

Nah they eat on a Trump win. The market probably priced in a Biden win today.



I will admit the Trump supporters blocking bridges and running cars off the road and intimidating voters by running up to their cars and shouting at them bordered on riots, though, so you do have a point.

Ya carbon tax and socialism is real good for business.  U serious?
Im tired of being grouped into being a left just because I don’t agree with Trump. I dont agree with sleepy joe or killary either because I am able to form my own opinion outside of shit party lines and biased media outlets. I recommend forming your own opinions and rethinking your stance on a character who “jokes” about undermining democracy. Fuck both parties
Shocking, because most 🥭 supporters will not admit they voted for 🥭 because they will be called racists and xenophobes, plus it’s hilarious to skew the polls the wrong way

Bruhhhhh 😂😂
I’m hype for the protests. Did you think we weren’t getting protests? We’re getting protests. Oh, are we getting them. 

Biden wins - Trump not going to hand off smoothly, Corona going to peak over the holidays and it’s not his problem in his eyes. You want Joe, let Joe clean it up. Guaranteed social unrest this winter 

Trump wins - I mean, this is the easy one. Holy fuck. 

Uncertain/delayed outcome - guaranteed wreck because the markets will shit themselves.

Agreed. I voted Biden this time but I can’t stand liberals and will happily laugh my ass off if Trump wins because there is nothing funnier than watching lefties cry and melt down into a puddle of estrogen every time they don’t get their way.

Well I bet on Trump in 2016 (small money for fun), but this time many of my bets are for Biden and the Democrats. I'm also in a lot of other bets like voter turnout, state with the smallest margin of victory, etc. I have no deep and extensive DD, just a straight up last minute YOLO. Here's hoping I go 2 for 2!

Where’s the dude who said a market crash was priced in
The uncertainty was around if the election itself was going to be a shitshow but it's been remarkably well-handled and most states are probably going to have results earlier than expected. Civil war cancelled, stocks only go up, buy CROX 60c

A lot of you retards forgot Biden was Delawares senator(you know the place where a lot of you stonks are incoporated in) for 36 years. I swear Republican/Trumpers have memories of gold fish. He is going to be good for the stock market. Time to load up on calls.
Literally says on their website that they want to take them away. Let’s your research?
No
Minor nitpick: Volga and VVIX are not interchangeable.

Volga is the partial derivative of Vega with respect to IV, which when evaluated at a point gives a linear approximation near that point. VVIX is merely a statistic calculated from the parameters of a basket of near-term VIX options with nonzero bid as explained in the CBOE white paper.

What’s usually the time between first exit polls and preliminary actual count? IIRC they go the real numbers in really quickly last time.
Trump wins because the riots scared the average american citizen and also for most the economy is more important then covid
Well that's why I voted the way I did.

Imagine thinking that there’s IV crush for a political election lmao wtf is wrong with you
From Twitter : “Yesterday, I voted. I voted for our future generation, I voted for our schools, our low income families, our rights, my LGTBQ+ friends, and minority rights. I voted for she, him, and them. I voted for my rights as a woman, and I voted for our Mother Earth” - what?
NBC just interviewed a guy who voted for Trump and they asked why they chose Trump.

No lie, his response was that he hated how America was currently viewed and laughed at by the rest of the world and he thought Trump was the best candidate to help correct that.

Bruh, who does he think was in charge the last 4 years to get America to this state?
Lol 🤡🤡🤡
I said in another reply that I was not a republican.  

You're a Trump supporter huh?

yeah he made a mistake, he admitted it, that's what normal people do.
Imma start doing that so you inverse me and go back to following the trends
I'm not saying Trump won't win, just your dad must be a tool if he was impressed by the past 4 years of Trump/Republicans and decided to vote Rep for the first time.
Oof, the odds are pretty rough. Might drop $300 on Biden to win the whole thing, but I'm worried Trump will say/do some crazy shit to invalidate the bet.
I Don't understand how Vix is still dying. We don't have any results. What could be more uncertain.

Jeromes Dream - A Well Documented Case Of Severe Autism

not only does it shoutout our boi Jerome but it also throws homage to this sub, and best yet it was made in the 90's! Dude is a time traveler
They were \~4% off last time. Saying this as a stat-nerd, that's still pretty damn accurate given the massive voting base and data pollers have to sift through.

Margin of error would have to be even bigger this time around for a Mango win
im opposite, i think we moon no matter who wins, then tank when we realize it doesn't matter because we're still fucked

I'm reg democrat and switched to republican because of reddit power mods perma banning for even hinting you don't like Biden.  Gave me a taste of what it like in a far left cancel culture society and didn't like it.
Ya that stuff shows just how desperate they are to inject liquidity and, imo, is a huge moral hazard.  They aren't allowed to directly buy bonds from the treasury to pay for stimulus checks but they can give disney a few billion to help their balance sheet after a decade of corporate stock buybacks
Holy shit mango would have a meltdown and barricade himself in the white house after the house decides the tie breaker for Biden.
SEC OPEN UP
I got lucky and sold when the stock was flat today for a 50% profit. Might re-enter the same trade with next week's expiration if continues to drop. Earnings was good and I think will set a new floor on the stock price.
Imho Donny cutting corporate tax rate had by far the biggest impact on markets since 2016. Ppl here who started investing think the last 7 months is a real market. The fact is the market was a rocket ship 2019
I'm sorry I need ssd's spxs to hit 30

VXX goes red.  
  
Its not happening guys. Volatility is dead. gghf
I can see it having a negative effect in the long run, but with near zero interest rates where is the money going to go? We may see a massive sell-off before that tax rule would go into effect, but then people would just have to buy back in

What is the maximum length should you hold SQQQ? 3 day? Week? Month?
But they've already asked all the wall street CEOs about this, and their answer is clear: increased economic expansion under Biden would offset increased taxes, which makes him completely neutral for stocks.

On the other side of the coin, contracted expansion under Trump offsets his reduced taxes, making him neutral for stocks. 

They wouldn't be forking cash over to Biden if they actually thought he was going to fuck their bottom line.
Seriously. He talks really well.

wow christians are smart
This is the biggest joke ever.  All the countries in the world are FUCKED.   Nobody and I mean nobody has any clue on how we stop printing money.  No country has figured out what they are going to do.  Covid is now forcing us and most other countries to print even more money and this has nothing to do with who the president is.

So fuck it.  Lower all taxes and keep printing money. I will take all the gains and when the music stops, I will be happy to short the market and sit on my piles of cash.  Fuck everyone else.  That is the way it works.

It is so fucken hard to make money.  Investors should never give a shit about anything other than how they will make more money and then keep it!!!

And if Trump sucks.  Why the fuck have we had stellar returns over the past 4 years.  Why did we get to 3% unemployment???  

Having said all that, if Biden wins and the market goes up then great I will take that as well but if he fucks this up with left bullshit then the music stops and the party ends too early.
In 2016 the market fell hard the week before election, during election week: fukin green dildo all week.  BULLISH
Since I'm not a 1%er, I guess I know which party is better for me. Thanks.
Literally can't go tits up.
I dont follow politics much but I put a shitton of money down on a Biden win. If it hits, I'll be posting some massive gain porn (or loss porn if he loses). Anyone know if those type of gain/loss porns would be allowed or is it "too political" for the gay mods in here?

The only way it will get that high is if the dollar legit shits the bed. If that is the case, it means the gains are barely gains.
Biden will increase capital gain taxes for 1MM+ incomes.  I know that won't affect anyone here, but it's quite bad for stonks.

i would ask if you're retarded but this is WSB so i already know the answer
So your way is just going against people you don’t like. In fact it’s the majority of voters that you don’t like. The republicans want their voters to vote and nobody else. It’s the reason they block so many voters through a bunch of voter suppression. You’re an imbecile. Why shouldn’t the person with the most votes win? Oh yeah cause most people are democrats? Go fuck off you fucking retarded mongoloid.
Exit polls don't mean shit. They were so wrong last time. They are like futures the night before.
Ahahaha how?

I found his racial jungle comment and crime bill worse
You keep saying that. How about you actually tell us who the fuck made it?
He’s gotten better over the last couple months.  I wonder if it was just confidence or what, but the last couple debates and his town hall were pretty good as far as him staying on topic and not getting flustered.
Are we gonna get a result tonight?

What outlet will call it first?

Closer than the polls show or or farther?
Ima be super real.. anyone is nervous the day of no matter what
Also Biden: if you're white and vote for me you get an n-word pass good for 4 years, courtesy of Kamala aka Black Clinton.
i actually called this. had a gut feeling

I finally came to that point a few months ago. I was debating buying a PS5, and then I thought to myself, it’s better to by it than lose it on options

That's what the car companies want you to think. The real reason is access to credit. They cost more because we'll pay more. No really. 

Boston Fed:
>everything came together in the 1920s: mass production, electrification, highway construction, mass communication, the expansion of consumer financing.
Auto manufacturers perfected assembly line production and began to turn out cars at a price that would “put the middle class on wheels.”
Public investment in a federal highway system helped to expand the market even further.
Other manufacturers adapted assembly line techniques to produce affordable home appliances and consumer electronics: ovens, refrigerators, washing machines, phonographs, radios, telephones. And investment in the utility infrastructure — electrical power grid, phone lines, water and sewer systems — helped to bring these products into more homes. But the catalyst — the thing that helped to bring all these industrial and technological marvels within the reach of so many consumers — was the expanded use of installment credit. The big breakthrough came in 1919 when General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) became the first to make financing available to middle-income car buyers. Instead of having to come up with the entire purchase price, prospective car buyers needed only a down payment and an income that was big enough to cover monthly payments over the life of the loan.

Joe Biden's tax increases are pretty modest, and I don't believe he will ever get them done anyway. Obama didn't really mess with Bush's taxes. Joe Biden isn't even proposing to raise corporate taxes back to where they were under Obama which is hilarious to me.
Also, lots of shares.

If you think a Trump win = drill and that Biden stim is priced in, why would you buy calls? Neither situation moons. No one knows how the market will react to either candidate winning.
Lmao what an idiot
That is the official bag holder narrative, its ok suckholes a blue wave is gooood, here try some soylent green. The 1 and only benefit to blue wave is massive stimmy.

Who is brave enough to admit they are a registered Republican and voted for Sleepy?  Awards if you say your state.

Edit: Again, read the question. You get no award if you claim to be a democrat voting for Trump.
I just need to know about the tit part.
Feeling like this was a big bull trap today. They dump this down to 310 then rocket to 380 by December.
Only way I can see it helping is that once this shitshow is over stim is coming. Doesnt matter who wins though.

Honestly, it would be bad. That's the actual answer. People here like to shitpost that a Trump win will rally the market, but it's nonsense.


Wall Street backed Biden, and he's so far ahead in the polls that him winning has been priced in for months. There's no way that an unexpected upset would rally the market. At least in the short term, it would crash as all the big money pulls out and re-evaluates their strategy. Longer term is anyone's guess. 

This is pretty unlikely to actually happen though.
For the people saying I could have held you might be right but the screenshot doesn't tell the whole story, I have more than one position in NIO. I also have CSPs and diagonal spreads, been playing with this ticker since before it was dropping down to sub 2 dollars.

People will always be taking profits. You can look at my posts as well. I raised money today.  It is not rocket science.   The market has moved up strong over the past two days. Somebody had to be buying and people that bought the dip should be taking SOME profits.

I might be the smartest person here but I made more money in the past month than I had before.   Not sure everyone is in the same boat.

Why don't you layout your trading strategy buddy???  Tell me what we should do to make more money.

My Great Grandfather  on my Mom's side was buying stock on margin, sold out a few months before the crash and bought a trolley line in Louisville Kentucky.

He thought that people would need to get to work, but couldn't afford or might have to sell cars.

Eventually it turned into a bus line, and he sold it in the 60's or 70's.

Buying it kept the family afloat, as he was an attorney, and they didn't have to move.

**But now Robinhood says HTZGQ is no longer supported. Can I still exercise this? Do I have a time limit before exercising now since company will be gone?**

You can still exercise them. But you will need to manually call Robinhood to help you get out of your position.

# Biden sweep agrees with my TSLA and NVDA Calls
Next time I gain above $20k I'm just taking the difference out in cash and spending it on stupid shit...
For MBS ya, fed has printed around 2 trillion on their balance sheet last time I checked.  However, for stimulus, the treasury will give the fed bonds to auction.  As far as my understanding goes the fed then sells them to the primary dealers.  So now the fed has the primary dealer's money.  The fed will give that money to the treasury.  So, in the end, the treasury got its money out of the pockets of primary dealers.  The fed then buys those bonds back from the open market, usually from banks, and gives them illiquid reserves in return.  Hence no money was printed during the process.  Now sometimes the fed will buy from someone that isn't a bank and they will have to print money to buy it, but broadly speaking they don't really print

Tech probably good regardless. It doesnt care about covid and as soon as the election stops being an uncertainty it'll shoot up.
you don't pay capital gains on losses so the majority of people here won't be affected anyway
Hell yeah!
Knees and Toes
If tmrw green that means u should’ve gotten them 3 days ago bro
It's a YOLO bet, of course we give fucks.

yes because of the whole one child law they value life

Whoever wins the other sides reaction will be hilarious we can agree on that
Where did you place this bet? I can't find any place to bet on the election.
Driving an Audi and was only speeding by 27MPH?
rest in pesos
And the auto industry, steel, DoD,...
Who is negative?
If you weren’t selling credit spreads today I feel sorry for you
yikes
Just realized I got scammed by the extended auto warranty phone calls, puts on my IQ for giving my credit card numbers.
Congrats & fuck off!   


Lets see the election gains with that!
Cash gang! I declare our animal to be a sloth.
Tonight's election fuckery?

I'm planning on drinking through all of the election fuckery....or you know, being consistently drunk until New Year's.
Damn it, think we want the SEC closing our sub again? Let him riot!
Biden win: Bullish on BIG stimulus

Trump win: Bullish on no new regulations

Bears Lose.
There's really only a semantic difference between the two
I gotta wait another hour in Texas ..
Nah just the threat of it. But yes this would be ideal for my rh balance
My sole reason for voting Biden is because I am tired of a fear mongering, divisive leader. Everyone needs to chill the fuck out. And all the people complaining about tax increases almost certainly do not meet the income threshold to be affected, unless they bought NIO at $4
I LUH Y'ALL
I don't have guns nor do I use weed.  Someday I will get a gun I guess.  Hopefully whatever happens this market keeps going for another year.  We will have to pay for all this stimulus at some point and it will be dark days.  Printing money has never been a way to grow to prosperity.

We just need to be out by then and shorting the market.
buy high, sell low...nice
Damn
This I can get behind
What were you thinking with BABA p’s? Earnings?
Cash account: you can make more than 3 roundtrips per 5 business days. No margin. No immediate settlement of trade.

Margin account: pdt for <25k account, immediate settlement of trade. Margin.
Tax free gains and you still have an account that'd PDT in America? Stupid europoors.
Everyone's asking about your mom
Tomorrow
Probably the same moves as every day, load up my watch list with a bunch of calls and puts, not buy anything and then be pissed off about what I should have bought
Exactly and buy the dip.

I'll give you 40k.
Man you should make my options plays
Shit if tomorrow green, I selling my kidney and buying calls
You’re gonna need an asteroid to hit the white house if you want your puts to print at these premiums
First thing I opened to wsb to while taking a dump, nice
Probably dumb. But who knows with the election
About to be wild for at least the next 24 hours.

Strap in motherfuckers!

Good luck to anyone with big enough balls (or smooth enough brain) to actually hold overnight tonight.

I got him for +160. So if OPs bet pays out at that rate, it would profit 24k.
Aww yes the ramblings of a negative account holder
I really don’t want a civil war as that would be absolutely awful for everyone. I really just need the mango to throw a hissy fit over losing for a day or two.
I feel for Trump supporters, their only friends are their cousins who allow the bad touch.
Honestly there's not really a guarantee there
I support segregating politics into its own sub
Yeah but you're in Scotland
Ban
Politics
wild.  libertarianism in full force
Good luck man.. truly zero risk involved
Bro you could have just put it all on GME
Now whisper that in my ear you dirty girl.
How dya do that?

Trumps overall Fiscal policies are garbage and that is bad for the market. There are some real retards in this subreddit, "cutting taxes is good". Not always retard.

YOOO When SPY was trading at $337.50 I bought Puts and now I can maybe make back a hundred dollars worth of the \~25,000 I've lost since I started :D
The guy above you
I'm pissed boys. I use ToS, but I've been using RH lately to try it out. 

tried to roll out my puts at close. Sold them, then put in a buy order and shit just fucking froze for like 45 seconds and didn't fill.

So now I only have $2k of FD puts when I wanted like $30k.


Not as bad as holding calls like a dongus, but still. The missed gains due to this shitty-ass app are gonna be painful.


I try to make excuses for RH, but it is just legit impossible to not get fucked using this shit. Gotta go back to ToS full time.
[deleted]
now that's real freedom
No matter what play I make calls puts debit spreads I’m getting fucked
Can't I have something of actual value?
Everyone look, it’s a self righteous fa ggot
I just got insider info from a cat that told me Biden will win after a recount.  

Also, GL tard, may your golden showers be inside a yacht.
With all of us expecting huge swings either way, I think we will have a really flat day tomorrow! Y’all really jinx everything you touch! 😒😒😒😒
sounds like a big-ass hedge
Cash gang !
Classic
I have 9.4 shares in Nio right now. Thinking of putting 2.5k down

Just going to post that regardless who wins

Bears will be fuk 🤣😂🤣
Sometimes, yeah. It'll be gone in a few minutes.
Disregard my retarded TEAM play.
that was at midnight tonight
Illegal to fire them but not “open carry” and my state repealed most safety laws. More likely to get a seatbelt ticket than anything. They are doing it to intimidate people, I’m not intimidated but I’m also a gun loving leftists who has more than I’d like to admit
I got in at 155%. It was up to 180% today. Kinda annoying
[deleted]
Doubt it
My mother in law called last night. She lives in suburbs north of Atlanta. Apparently all these Asians are going around promoting Trump because these Asians are church goers and they dont believe in women’s right to choose. When asked about it, they say that they dont like Trump but because he is against abortion, they will vote for him.
Proof?
Everyone fleeing California's high taxes and cost of living now voting for Democrats in Texas is something else.

I love Chapagetti. Not a soup type ramen, but Korean blackbean noodles in an instant ramen pack.

Thanks. I'll sell a bit probably so that I can add them back for a double-down, if they die more on earnings.
Well we knew about Michael in 2009... sooo
Margin
Started to pop and turned into a dump. I mean a poop.
The word you're looking for is "efficient market." And the answer to that is passive investing, not stealing.
Put/Call ratio on the SPY hit 1.565.  This is back to the highest levels.  Lots of puts trading for the past 10 days.

100% cash for the first time ever... feels really weird to be able to sleep without worry tonight..godspeed tards
lmao this scene is so iconic
If 😴 wins FL & PA its over for 🍊. Lets get this over with already. SPY 350, VIX 20.
Yessir
U do realise here In Scotland there is no PDT and al my gains are tax free
What’s the potential payout?
Lmao bruh no. I ain’t betting against a dude named Joe when all America wants is to return to boringness
I've made decent money being a bear the last few weeks. Not getting cocky of course, having a plan and stop losses is crucial. And I don't fuck with options anymore.
Who is cash gang?
No.. never did either. WV lol.
Nio mooning while all the stonks getting shorted by small pp MM’s. I love commi stonks
I just want to get rich and get high. These old people are just in the way

About to be wild for at least the next 24 hours.

Strap in motherfuckers!

Good luck to anyone with big enough balls (or smooth enough brain) to actually hold overnight tonight.
What kind of communist gynese thread is this.
It's been like that for a while now. Turned into the wild west and I guess they just said fuck it and let it do it's thing.
BABA gonna scream past 300 tomorrow.
whatever happens tonight, at least we all had fun along the way :)
...zap job?
I bought a put near the top today but that last min pump made me turn it into a credit spread. Then the last last min dump fucked my spread.

R senate is the bigger problem imo and trump will be pressured by R's to keep stimmy low
Are we embracing ourselves for the shitshow or are we chill.

Gonna order some food/beers accordingly.
...because they did? Movement today was crazy
Fuck it man I put $ on Biden to win TX. +300 isn’t too bad
Today was a big ole bull trap. The Bear Party starts tonight!
Trump = Green tomorrow
Biden = Flat tomorrow
i made 16.09 today in the final 30 mins of the market open ! Time to pay my wifes boy friend rent
That is a whole other level! Good luck!
What expiration?
I would personally like business and environmental regulations less personal ones. I like guns and weed but my weed friends say im conservative and my gun friends say im a leftist.
And sooooo
What’s the chance of us seeing a blue Texas?
System wide bot will ban you
so I can say FUCK TRUMP AND HIS FASCIST SUPPORTERS and not get banned...again?
I encourage you to fact check me with your own sources, and come to an independent conclusion on if you agree with me or not. I’ve been heavily researching the company for 6 months before I bought any shares.
I sold all my NIO calls today. Now I’m feeling like tomorrow is going to be super green again.
Not enough downvotes
In the south you get shotguns though so... calls on Texas
Exactly. Going to be a huge rug pull. Too many retailers in nio now
Straight to jail
😂😂
Texas is going red.

Blue wave in Texas is the dumbest shit...anyone who thinks that would happen hasn't spent a minute in Texas.
I cant believe you're being downvoted lol
No options in my fidelity account but 500 shares of uvxy as a swing trade should do
I loled
WIN OR LOSE WE BOOZE
Watch us trade completely flat tomorrow. That would be hilariously brutal.

Anyway, anyone have a list of the best ramen? I might need it...
I bought spxs the triple leveraged 🐻 equity about 7 minutes before market close today, dont be greedy tomorrow if theres a dip early, get out
Yeah you’d retire off those, send me 5k when you hit!

Sheesh.

I’m a fan of Donny pump as much as anybody else but don’t you think any politician would have done the same?
if everything is truly priced in, all stocks would have only two values, zero and infinity
You are literally handing out free personal info lmao
Stimulus talks proves that
The problem with these hours long run ups and last minute dumps is they make it a true gamble to hold your puts. Feels like everyone is playing a game of financial chicken
does ur state not give Tesla tax credit? rip
You're entirely too smart for this sub.
That’s the life bro
[removed]
I can confirm, I remember this.
whats the difference
Shaved some stuff off the table and added an XLE position after they pulled back today. Feeling like I'm in a good place but will probably regret selling anything when we continue to moon tomorrow.
I feel like people rioting won’t do much but if mango refuses to give up power, that will tank the market.
red tomorrow bois,

sell at start for profit
# You're welcome r/politics
It goes up and down. It'll pull back some for sure
I did a double take cuz my name is Kamal LOL
I’m not sure why YouTube keeps recommending me women’s pole vaulting and long jump videos but I’m not complaining

Donny doesn’t do shit. All praise our lord & savior JPow!
no. mods cant do anything

reddit will ban you for calling someone gay now.

just dont do it unless u want to create a new account every 2 days

WSB is full of \*\*\*\* little \*\*\* virgin \*\*\*\* who will report u for anything now
And give the poors a chance to exit positions?

HA!
Biden is going to be a puppet for the left. He is surrounded by a fucked up group of people and he will appoint them in places where they will fuck with every part of your portfolio.  The left is too far left!
Why so I can plead a mental disability ?? You guys are smarter than you look...
What if it said up 4.2069% to $420.69
Alright. PayPal for settling the bet?
Watch the market be completely flat tomorrow, we’re building this up to be a moon mission or drill
How we feeling TEXAS?  

Whats the latest on the ground? 

We ending this thing quick tonight?

Yes
Huy Tu Hi
Bought these today. https://i.imgur.com/c7EZOxx.jpg
I posted a detailed critique but you didn't give any substantive answer. 

Huh. 

Here's another point, and I can keep them coming at you: Let's say that we're in deflation like your ideal world of Ron "I'mafuckingracistclown" Paul. But let's pretend for a moment that a vagina doctor was right about economics. 

Why do you think that a small level of inflation is necessary? Let's say you're making money from a pool of a roughly fixed amount of national gold. Every year the economy grows and the gold grows more scarce because more people are needing to use it. That's deflation. 

If you didn't have at least some inflation you could put your money in your mattress and come out ahead every single year. That would be bad as that money would not be invested in the economy. Do you now understand why some inflation is necessary, to motivate people to NOT hold their cash, but to invest it and spend it into the economy?
[deleted]
I’d buss
Might have something to do with the market being open
Tomorrow gonna be lit
I am ready for these clueless networks declaring winners of each state prematurely and then changing it throughout the night.
Dodged some serious bullets today, took a couple in my holding bag, I’ll have to carry for the week or more, but TD says I’m a bad faith guy. Puts on them, I’m a Faith No More guy.
WELLLLLL, west coast is on fire, east coast gets snow, northern areas get snow, southern areas have a fuck ton of spiders.
Went back to a cash account. Fuck PDT.
Let’s get this senate blue, purge the religious conservative scum from the government and start a new advanced era for America.
Yeah because he really came through for those coal miners ...
Vote for TRUMP and WEED. Gonna be a hell of a schlonging tonight

No ban we bang🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thx chimpu. I know thats you in disguise
Probably not though. Trump already brought the trash out of their hidey holes
UVXY & SQQQ calls baby, my ass is bleeding as much as yours don't worry. Nio kept me green on the day though
Imagine thinking either cares about you 😔
Send me more stimulus, pay for my college, erase any student loans I already took out, give me an extra 600/week in unemployment so I can bet it on NIO.

Some of y’all shady as fuck.
Are these old ones left over from before the reverse split? If so they’re non standard options - instead of 100 shares they’re good for 8 shares - and nobody wants them. You can execute but I’m not doing the math on whether that is a good idea or not. Consider it homework.
Show up to court with your all time PnL chart and the judge will let you go.

Extremely dumb.
it was a trend day up ... trend days tend to close with profit taking .. so a trend down will rally and a trend up (today) will dump
Worried Mitch McConnell is the hang up here. I think Trump + all Dem congress > Trump + all repub congress
Because China is using the election as a distraction while they add regulations to businesses like NIO.

Just shut down the ANT IPO in a closed door meeting with the owners.
Nah the market always does the opposite of what we think.

Calls on everything
$50 says Biden is clear winner but Trump refuses to concede
Nice
woah thats some nice after hours movement. why couldn't they have done that during the day?
They're constantly trying to stop fun. Im not saying theu dont do the acts, im saying why wake up the next day and try to ban them
No hedge?
It’s just the beginning. Mighty claw coming soon.
I just want a stimmy to put in my rh. And a Tesla tax credit.
Done
Upvote because you were driving an Audi
Sigh....I've tried to be a good gay bear. Responsible plays. Average into a position. Have an exit plan that matches my entry plan. What has it gotten me? Full time employment giving handjobs behind a Wendy's dumpster.

You know, sex is great. I love banging out my wife. But porn is pretty great too, because I can’t tell my wife half the weird shit I’ve beaten off to, and nobody knows my dick like my hand. Sex is a production: the timing has to be right, there’s a bit of performance, there’s preparation beforehand and cleanup after. But jerking off to porn is a breeze. I can rub one out in the handicap stall at the office to a video of a dude knocking golf balls into a Eastern European chick’s gaping anus. I can crank it in the car on the way home while watching Asian fetish models drink spit from a glass. With the right material I can beat my dick to a pulp in 2 minutes flat. That’s convenience you don’t get with sex. Sex and porn aren’t *competitors*. Sex and porn are like two shirtless twinks asking you without judgement if you want a good old fashioned fuck or a quick handjob. Both are good. I like to think this world is big enough for both sex and porn.
None of that will help their terrible actual business prospects.

Unless it would squeeze for some reason I guess

That has nothing to do with people driving around my city with a passenger sitting out the window with a shotgun over their back. Completely unnecessary
I love it..... that is the best clarification of being far left.  It should not matter what age you are. All that matters is you want no regulations, lower taxes and more money from your investments.

I personally could give a flying fuck who wins from a politics side because rarely has the government helped the people, BUT Donny helps my bank account sooo thats how I vote
Yes, Fred Jr. was the one who was groomed to take over the empire but he wasnt very interested in it. He wanted to be a pilot and Trump Sr. forbade it.

When Don took over, and even before then, when the business fucked up, it was Freddy's fault.

Dude wound up self medicating with alcohol, drank himself out of his pilots license and then ultimately wound up as the Trump companies maintenance guy.

Donnie boy has only proven to me why he should be voted out.  ORANGE SUS!
Agreed, but I feel like if it's legal nationwide people are gonna spend so much money on it. Think about how much $ this sub has burned. People always looking to burn $, specially if it gets them high
Who says you can't do any of that?
Got notice my job will no longer exist on 5/1/21. Panic pulled out everything I had in Amazon at 3000, pulled out of NIO 200 shares on October 22nd as well as a ton of 1/15/21 25c, 11/13 25c, 11/20 30c & 35c.

Still have GME calls that are -89%.

That'll do it for our post-game coverage this evening, for more analysis tune into the election discussion thread. From all of us here at WSB Sports, good night!
Guh
The dude looks like Putin
I do get what you are saying as far as monetary policy having a limited effect in getting extra cash into the circulating money supply because the limiting factor is banks being unwilling to lend additional money even if they have the expanded reserves to do so. Expanded reserves don't necessarily lead to a truly expanded money supply. 

The FED however does have direct lending facilities set up right now, and they have bought directly in the corporate debt bond markets; not just through Blackrock.

Markets grew by 10.5% per year under Obama. 9.5% under Trump thus far.

Stocks do just fine regardless of who's in power. We had a steady pattern of growth before the corporate tax cuts.

This weird notion that a Biden victory means we go into a recession is some bullshit. But chances are that's a trough you willingly go to.
Same
Meanwhile it’s leftists that are burning and looting their cities.
Nobody tell him
I have calls, but I'm hoping for a clown fiesta before next open that causes us to gap down so calls can get real cheap. Then by Thursday we start having an idea of a clear uncontested winner and the rally engages.

Bro relax  Agreed but I want to let the market move a little first. I feel like it’s going to make some major swings which will crush options less you’re day trading.

Sadly, reality has shown that the stock market has risen significantly under a number of democratic presidents and fallen or not gone up as much under republican presidents. 

You can look it up. 

I was told if trump (being a business man, not a republican establishment politician) became president he would fix the economy and taxes and regulations in such as way that the economy would boom so hard like we'd never seen before.

That did not happen. Even before the corona. That did not happen. 

THERE WAS NO MASSIVE BOOM THE LIKES WE'VE NEVER SEEN.

(Going up a little bit isn't the same thing.)

the idea that it’s priced in is priced in
Hell yeah bruther
Do you think the Bears maybe think about a quarterback change after the last couple performances?

Well they've certainly got to be thinking about it, because as I mentioned, these breakout performances by VIX were really fueled by teams that weren't accounting for his explosive athletic abilities, you maybe see how much more you can get out of Michael VIX but as a long term solution I don't think you're gonna surprise anyone going forward
😂😂😂😂👍
My guess is nothing will change. Both are incompetent retards that will achieve nothing greater than winning an election

Bide is still winning

Independents will break massively for Biden

Biden is behind in a few states but still has a clear path to victory

Biden can still win on election day

Biden can still win without Florida

Biden can still win without Pennsylvania

Biden can still win with late ballots

Biden ca still win with the recount

Biden can still win with the Supreme Court

Who leading in the polls rn? Biden?
thanks
He's going to concede for fuck's sake. He's just sick of being asked. It's a stupid fucking question by a bunch of idiot trust fund kids who can't tell the difference between a narcissistic game show host and an actual tyrant.
Inverse WSB, Papa Clementines is going to win. This man wakes up and the first word that comes out of his mouth is DOW.
Oh shit my VXX calls may have life! Is Kanye catching up in the polls?
I am no role model man, trust me. Everyone’s situation is different. For me personally, I am in a position in my life right now where I am young enough to risk everything, and still have time to recover if things went south. If you have no real responsibilities, like take taking care of a family, or anything like that. Then you can afford to be more risk adverse. Just my philosophy, don’t be afraid to lose it all to gain everything. Otherwise life is boring.
Omg lets pls have a political bot genocide tomorrow so tired of them

MMs degraded the VIX. Are they seriously gonna let you make money off the VIX?
Election is another uncertainty factor that will be gone, plus whoever wins will promise a *stimulus*

TLDR: stop overthinking buy calls
People keep hyping Texas' record voting numbers saying it's bullish for Biden, when Texas has the largest oil industry by far - arguably bullish for Trump
Sorry, seemed like you were looking for quick hitters.  I get your point though.
Really? markets have been green all day with expectations of a Biden win. As far as presidents go Biden is a really stable and safe pick.

Trump is such a wild card, in 2016 people wanted a change but I don’t think anyone expected the ride to be that wild.
If Biden is winning Florida, it's over.
Where’s target 🎯 going AH?
Awww baby... 😘😘😘
I got one 338p 11/13 along with my 🍿 just to see where this goes. Few straight days being green it has to balance I think.

No one here want to pay to play.

Rest my case then.
Whoever makes the printer go brr 2020
Feels weird not having puts for this. My weak hands couldn’t take it anymore but looks like they dumped at close. Gonna have circuit breakers tonight fuck
I am surprised by the number of people in WSB that think Biden is the right choice. You would think people trying to make money in the market and taking risks would be mostly republican.

Making money is f n hard, keeping it should be your number one priority.  Don't go for this socialism crap.  It never works and you do not want to fund people that are not taking risks to make money.
I got a shit-ton of shares. Holding till they get juicier

Then you have to select all and export to excel. I have a table that allows me to quickly paste and get statistics on.
You should want to keep the volatility. You get bigger swings faster, so it's easier to profit when you're right. You want to go back to days of the market being up or down .30% and your portfolio barely moving?

Well Todd, you also mentioned some missed opportunities by VIX

Yeah Gus take a look at this play right here, UVXY gets a great release on this route and the defense is on the strong side of the field but the ball gets away from VIX here, just throws it over his head out of bounds, and then you see mental lapses from the rest of this offense here on this late holding call that really -- I mean, you just can't afford to be holding here, I don't know what they were thinking on this one.
3380 to 3347 in a couple of mins... no biggie, completely normal market.
I suspect this is a bull trap, I bet like 90 grand on that today, hope I'm right or its blow job's behind Wendy's for me, SQQQ calls and other random super leveraged bear shit.
Try atom?
Covid still a thing bud
Of all the plays out there, I was confident that volatility would go up leading into election day.

For fucks sake, the orange cunt already told that he thinks votes are fake news and that he won't concede.

Either this is a blue wave priced in or MMs just completely rat fucked the VIX.
Maybe a good short-term play, but in my experience investors haven’t been enthused by weed stocks after the bubble popped.
Tonight’s about to be wild. No one thinks we’ll get the results tonight so naturally we probably will know by midnight who won.

So this is what I did.. bought the $37 call back cause it was -20% and sold the $38 call paying the small difference in premium (debit). I want nio to run but this euphoria is not sustainable. If it drops tomorrow which I’m guessing it will, I’ll buy back the $38 call again and hopefully cover what I paid in premium today. I’m already up 120% on the long leg ($30 strike) so yes, in the green 😀

Tech will probably face more uncertainty if biden wins, there is incentive for him to crack down on certain companies(FB, Twitter) that he feels aided trump.
Bold
I think I can safely say, futures don’t matter tonight
😂😂. Imagine how deep market will go if it become a contested election. It seems both of them are ready for it. The only difference is Donnie is screaming about it.
Wana make it a bet?
😂😂😂

See, it doesnt matter who is elected as POTUS. Donnie Boy has proven that.

As long as JPOW is the Fed Chairman, stonks will go up
We'll make more by making weed a cash crop and taxing the hell out of it. Gotta replace tobacco somehow
Whatever the result, it's important that everyone has fun.

I... I need to change my vote
Enough with the gibberish gypsy, tell me what positions to buy
Hope we test out those new shiny 7%’rs tonight
No
States wanting bailouts should just legalize weed to supplement for the lost revenues from the heads in beds taxes. Change my mind
Donnie Boy is fake billionaire though. Some autists in this sub probably have more money than Donnie Boy
Back...All the way back...to Monday’s low. 😒 Pump & chill.

Couldn't care less who wins tomorrow, all I care about is for this crazy volatility to be over so we can go back to Hard instead of Ultra Hard mode.
Said every bear since Sunday night, only to get piped as usual
Now that’s how you fuck some people over.
Exactly why it won’t happen
> He's the incumbent so not really an underdog imo

Nah, he's just literally that bad at being president. That even as the incumbent, he's still somehow the underdog.
The tomorrow’s moves thread starts too soon bc the time change
This is a fuckin history book memory trigger
Im gonna go home, eat lots of junk food, masturbate, and when i get back tomorrow you better have this market UP Jeromethy!
Not sure how I feel about that tick down right at close

Ey brother there’s enough for all of us, just remember to take profits when shit goes thru the roof. I mean this is a good long hold but i don’t have balls of steel to hold thru to $40 😆
Stimulus isn’t all that matters, would help in the short term though

COME ON BIDEN GIMMIE MY FREE COLLEGE
Which year and strike I love that play
Think about it. Everyone fucking sold because no one wants to hold during the election. However, the traders bought at open fully expecting a Trump win.
You sir are doing it right 👍🏼
Okay so. I’ve made like a grand and trippled my
RH account from your call. I’m freaking out. >.<
So that'll do it for this one and Todd are you surprised by the performance from Michael VIX today?

Oh absolutely, VIX had a huge opportunity here, after a breakout performance last week there was so much hype for Michael VIX and the stage was set, but he was completely shut down by Jerome Powell and this defense. Seems to me it's one of those situations where now the coaches around the league have updated film on the guy and he hasn't been able to adjust to the strategies they've used to counter him.
Doesn't matter if Biden or Trump wins. It matters who gets the Senate.
Goldman Sachs promotes it as well. 

They may be right in a weakening dollar raises prices for stocks - along with everything else
6 mins into AH...
Called the pump this past few days in a comment last week and the flat level for today I called this morning. Let’s see if the third part comes true: big pullback by friday no matter who wins.
Biden too
Just cracked open a beer in the office.  #justcovidthings

Guys. Trumps gonna win. In a liberal county in Florida, some deranged chick was handing out fliers for the Dems outside the polling station, and literally every single person walking by was either laughing at her or saying something pro trump related. It was pretty astounding to witness.
1:05pm
We should be able to vote on Fed's chairman too. It's more important than the president.
Today was less volatile than I thought. Futures might be more fun.
What about tech!?
Looks like it, believe he’s implying itll moon towards 200% fib extension spot, which aligns with the JP Morgan 54% increase, if they ever said that.
wouldnt say so
Hey, how bout that close, huh?

Who knows what the market is thinking. The market doesn't even know.
Might go out and riot tonight to help my VIX calls a bit

Yeah I loaded up on vsto, swbi and rgr after seeing their lots full for the past few weeks.
What is a trap? 


Guh
Basically the worst happened on Monday it reversed directions 2 times and ended at the same price as open. This will obliterate both legs. A .5% move or more is what you want to make a profit.
Y’all are idiots for even caring after what’s happening to your stock rn, everything’s gonna change as election progresses

fingers crossed for some road warrior shit my man!
AH trading like no one heard the bell
Atta boy!
well fuck id like to get some spy options, just dont know which way
The Fed does buy Agency MBS directly from the secondary market. 

The Fed also does literally buy bonds from commercial dealer banks when the purpose of buying those bonds is to fund the federal government (in these cases the dealers are buying at auction and quickly flipping the bonds). The $1,200 checks we got were new money printed by the fed; not just money generated from leveraged bank reserves. 

The Fed also accepts treasury bonds as collateral in repo which expand bank reserves - I believe this is the activity you are referring to

But at some point the FED does have to be buying treasuries or at least giving incentive to dealer banks to buy them (expanding reserve requirements and accepting treasuries as collateral for cash), otherwise they would be unable to achieve their targets as far as lowering interest rates goes.
Not this time.  Biden needs to win by a landslide within the first week (maybe today) to clinch a victory.   He doesn't have alternative paths to victory, aside from fighting Trump's other paths in court and hope he wins.  

But yes, you're right that technically Trumps paths to victory existed with other elections, but this time we have something we didn't have which is 1. the pieces are all in place at the same time and 2. an incumbent who is willing to actually use them.  

Anyway, I don't personally think it's going to shake out like that.  If Trump loses, despite all his boasting and the hand-wringing of his campaign about how they'll fight to the bitter end, I bet he'll just concede and be glad the whole thing is over.  

But the dude who bet $5MM obviously disagrees with me.
I was going to get puts but then I realized they'll be a whole lot cheaper tomorrow at open when it's flat and the IV plummets
Bought a put at 3:40, watched it drop 30%, held and sold for a 6% loss at 3:59
I'm stacked to the tits in vxx calls. Let's see how this shakes out. There's no way of knowing anything anymore

Apparently in some small township in NH they already started counting the votes and Biden got all 5 votes. That's it folks, the results are in.
200% gain last week, 50% hit today.... this may be it but its been a hell of a ride!
It’s all just a simulation
I think NIU is the better NIO 2.0 bet than XPEV. Both good plays along with LI though.

If your long leg strike is low enough you should still make money from the higher delta. A lot less money but that's the price of hedging 🙃. You can wait or just close then whole position, what's your breakeven on the $37 and what's your long leg strike? I wouldn't be that worried you're gonna make money either way.

I kind of want Biden to win so aurora cannibis goes up and I can buy more puts on that dumpster fire of a company.
That pump was bs at the end so that the dump wouldnt look as bad as it would seem
That guy is getting those 260 11/4 options ITM
That was a sell off? Looked like someone at MCD giving change on a $1 menu McGriddle.
Intel you piece of shit
last election the market dropped ≈ 5 % during election night and the quickly recovered. now with this volatility I have no idea whats going to happen but it would be extremely funny if the market would just trade some kind of a confusing range to fuck just about everybody.
biden clearly won, the market says so
Glad I got 11/11 338 puts at the high today 😈😈
hey whattaya know RH fucked me again by taking 45 seconds to process a buy order at 3:59 and not filling

Back to ToS I goooo
SPY and QQQ photo finish tied at 1.73%

Jeez that was some insane selling going on the last two minutes. WOW!
What a bull trap that was.
Buckle up
This aged very well very quickly. Nice job jinxing it retard
It can still be sold since there are computers that will take it from you for the right price. You can always get it's "intrinsic value," which is the amount of profit you'd get if you exercised it and sold the shares this instant.
after hrs is not lol
Damn that close was truly wild
That part where they pumped everything at 3PM only to fucking dump it at 350 was not particularly cash money
YESSSS SSIRRRRR
Bagholding BABA December way OTM and November ATM calls. Let’s see how earnings goes after they’ve already been beaten down to a new low. If ANT IPO V2 gets announced in the next few weeks it will moon.
Wehhh pussy
Had us in the first 6 hrs and 25 minutes, not gonna lie
So lets see...

* Fauci & other experts said it would not go away on its own, Trump said it would.
* Fauci & other experts said we would see another spike/wave in the fall which we currently are, Trump said we're rounding the curve out of it.
* Fauci & other experts said not to expect a vaccine until 2021 at the earliest, Trump said we'd have it "momentarily" and before the election.

Looks like expertise does know what the fuck its talking about, generally. Trump and his base's response to this information is... *fire Fauci*.

And what does the future hold?

* Fauci & other experts say we will experience a brutal, dark winter with COVID, Trump says we won't.

Vote the dangerous idiot out.
So GME is not just a meme?
Holding 329p down $350. Fuckkk
I’ve been gaining 300-500$ every day since the 29th. And I only have 2,400$ in my rh acct. It went from 500 down to 1.4k up. Is this real?
I bought 20k worth of calls seeing all this green today :/
Me and you both brother
Jesus spins the wheel. What a pleb
🤡🤡🤡
Trump wins a narrow EC. Dems take the senate and hold the house. Trump resigns January 19th and is pardoned by Pence. We then proceed with no VP for 4 years. Wish Bovada would cap this cuz I’d throw $100 on it at +4000 or better.
Either last week was the greatest bear trap of all time or today was the greatest bull trap of all time.
You liked that dump into the close. Kind of obvious that would happen. Easy money.
Well how about that
Yessir
Holy fuck.

I still think there will be a Trump win.
Loaded to the tits with puts. Godspeed
You bought spy puts too?
Did 340/350 debit spreads on spy on that dip for next Friday. See what happens
FUCK YEAH BOI *snorts cocaine*
Spy opens at ___ tomorrow?

Yeah......it was reported to be a scam about a year ago........but  I keep buying calls.
I bought 20 shares of UVXY so I'm either smart or emperor of retards
Was grocery shopping at close for some cheap hedge plays 😳
Markets are giving us a clear sign who will win...

nobody 

it's trump v. biden

we all lost...
Has the market suddenly realized?

>He's going to win, isn't he

Didn’t get to close all my spy puts so let’s hope the election is contested!!!
What the fuck do we know? We can’t even predict the market
Gap down tomorrow looks like
Half the sub gonna be shopping for private islands. The other half shopping for a patch of private Astro turf.
I support this segregation of politics from the rest of the board.
Lmaoooo this market
I lost 10k today going massively short the market, hopefully tomorrow pays

Florida has record turnout for voting my guess is for biden
turn off your machines, step away from your forge
Touche.  My thinking as well
SPY DEAD
That close was so bullish.
Damn that EOD selloff
[deleted]
I can see this happening.

Let me paint the scenario for you:

It's Friday, and the votes are in. Chump, whom you voted for, has lost. There's a lot of talk about how the libtards rigged the election and memes all over FB showing how Burisma participated in a huge disinformation campaign against your buddy Chump, but that's just gotten you fired up.

You need to do something, you need to relieve some stress, you need to fucking scream.

It's a party then. DM's fire off to Alex, Chet, Brandon and Mary. You're getting together at Gerald's at 10, bring everyone, bring all the bottles, bring anything.

The white pickups with peeling tint congregate in numbers like your county hasn't seen in years, not since Judy's graduation smash in '15. People are parked on the other side of the neighbors, and Gerald's dad has 51 acres of fallow corn fields that he wrote off as a loss for tax rebates after harvesting for deer feed.

Impressive.

It's wild, party is off the chain and nobody can hear what anybody is saying. Becca showed up, so you naturally start grinding on her to the caterwauling of Luke Combs' "Lovin' on You." On the other side of the room is an orangutan someone kidnapped from the zoo during some protests in the city because shit wasn't locked up so why not? He's wearing a MAGA hat and seems to be getting himself quite inebriated. Everyone has decided that he's their personification of Chump and keeps walking by and smacking him on the back mid-swig.

Well it seems that orangutans aren't fond of choking on carbonated beverages, and Becca just happens to be "in season", as your jocular and definitely not hyper-masculine and never sexist pals on the varsity team would quip. OraungoDonnie can't get a fix on who is slapping him on the back. He spins one way and sees idiots gesticulating wildly, and he swings the other and sees a bunch of screaming kids around a beer pong table.

He zeroes in on you because he understands how to compete for a mate, and he can smell Becca from across the room. He knows how to handle this situation and he's ready for some blood.

The bellow goes out, you've been challenged and the room goes silent except for the blaring speakers. Next sound is the coffee table being flipped and OranguDonnie is charging. Instincts kick in and you're running after shoving Becca on top of her friends on the couch. There's a quick  loop through the kitchen, when you come back out you find everyone staring, but when OranguDonnie comes out everyone fucking books it.

Shit just got weird.

Forgetting the floor plan of Gerald's you accidentally end up in the laundry room. There's a tense few seconds of OranguDonnie trying to beat down the door and you realize it isn't going to hold, so you grab the ironing board off the wall, let it swing and lay the board on top of OranguDonnie to use as a plank, sliding your way to an escape.

The doors are packed with screaming rednecks when you come back into the living room and OranguDonnie didn't lose any time, he's just behind you. Upstairs is the only option. You take them 3 at a time and just manage to avoid tripping to find the hallway with doors of which you only know where one leads and it has no windows. Your smooth brain calculates the law of averages before you have time to and you instinctively head for the opposite door.

But not before OranguDonnie snakes out one of those creepily long orange arms and grabs your ankle in a death-grip. You go face first in the carpet and next thing you know he's crawling on top of you.

This is when you squealed. You know what type of squeal.

Nobody heard it, you think. Except OranguDonnie, he knows what that squeal means and he raises his hands high to give you a double open-handed ground pound that'd likely have put you out for the weekend if you hadn't somehow managed to worm - literally, do The Worm - and wiggle out from underneath him. He changes tactics to grab you again but only gets your pants, and they come off with minimal effort.

You're off to the door. You're through the door. The piss-flap on your boxers catches on the knob and they give way as you careen into the wall, knock over a chair and fall on the bed.

Into my room that I was renting from Gerald's dad after losing my ass on WSB and having to give up my bachelor pad in the 'burbs. I had been fucking around on my phone for 3 hours trying to pretend there wasn't about to be an orgy downstairs while flipping through Tinder only to find that everything under 40 in possession of a vagina was already at the party because there aren't exactly a lot of options on the ass-end of society and I was probably going to have to swallow a handful of xannies to get to sleep sometime this weekend.

And you land right the fuck on top of me, micropenis shriveled even further from the adrenaline rush of your life being in danger and heading in the wrong direction your balls end up smacking my chin before I get kicked in the head as you scramble for the window. OranguDonnie has "A moment" with the door which he doesn't appreciate just swinging any which way it pleases and that affords you the gap you need to get the window open and roll out on the shingle roof, then slide down to freedom.

Giving yourself some absolutely brutal road-rash, the scabs of which will be peeling for months.

I mean Biden shouldn’t take over until like late January right? So im not super worried about his effect on lockdowns since if there is still no end in sight by then we have bigger problems
Jesus these swings wtf???
so you just had to wait until the absolute last minute... OK
HEADS DOWN, STAY DOWN

Mods r gay.
First down, VIX drops back, three man rush, VIX floats one up to the end zone looking for SPY and it's picked off in the end zone and that'll do it here
Going all in on $ROPE rn holy fk
Good fucking day NIO bros.

Lindsay Graham is one of you
Selling right before the election results is such a pussy move
Too risky to hold positions in this retarded ass market. Election is going to be contested no matter who looks like is gonna win because of the mail in ballot system.
Kanye 2020!!!!

Edit: can we let trump finish his wall before he leaves 🥺
  👉👈
Jumped min last minute 😂
CRACKING A BEER NOW BOYUS
That’s not true. Trump tried to legalize discrimination against the LGBT, but the Supreme Court struck it down..
I’m pretty sure that is not true
its because of it's stupidly high valuation obv

I think the mods all live in Portland. One mention of Portland and you’re getting sent to the shadow realm just to come back with a barcode next to your name.
 I assume you’re playing a Biden win for legalizing mj, it’s a growing industry, yeah, but I think it has a while to go. Mainly bc i don’t think its a priority rn, like how he was talking about environmental change/plan coming in March (with stimmy deal). It’s good that u traded the rumor, but no one was interested in it rn.
You'd think it would've consolidated through election, but it's been running since last week.. few big players got in recently and with good numbers I think retail is finally catching up.
lmao true
NGL pretty excited for futes
just some calm profit taking just in case, no worries
this sentiment conflicts with my financial prospects .... FAKE NEWS
You would have been better off throwing your money into a toilet.
What’s your reasoning here? I thought IV crush is solely related to investor relation findings, such as earnings and press releases
Perfectly timed puts purchase in the last 10 mins.  betting against America for a hopeful $500. here we gooo!
It means no one is trading that option today.
I use Bovada for my sports degeneracy. It’s a decent enough book.
>eh, pc culture is lame 

I don't think you got downvoted for calling him a retard, it was just because the rest of your comment was dumb.
Wow this is too complicated
I've been watching UPWK, as a freelancer on their platform. Not convinced this is going to happen.
I won't go down like this.
Not at all, all signs point to a very profitable quarter
Make it moon, Answer man.
If you need proof for how rigged this shit is, plnt planet fitness is up 8% on record covid numbers going into winter
Lol if we've learned anything this year, it's that those are two very different things.
5%? Jesus Christ. You gotta sell now
lol, i had this same thought, ugh
Today is SPY's earnings day.

Tomorrow, IV crash.
Wow, algos checking in to make sure the 1% stay the 1%
mini dump
WTF is going on ?!
fuck off
That’s all I can do on predict it or I would have 250k on him
Huge smack down damn

Well this is awkward
great, right after i bought
You’re going to get iv crushed buddy
Two days in a row ending in massive volume selling. Fed liquidity PPT is real.
Im a canuck so i get to just watch from up here, with no moral responsibility
This election has me posting and buying November 16 calls for 355 lol
Those who bought anything less than 330 probably but it’s a lot more realistic this will go down short term than shoot up to 350 like most people are claiming lol
But RKT is not the type of tech company as BILL, DDOG and JFROG
My biggest issue with the "democrat" party is that democracy selected Bernie not once but twice. And both times he got robbed. Anyone who supported Bernie or who truly believes in "by the people" should be outraged.  

Trump is winning because consensus is not democratic. 

My ICLN leaps will still print.
That is some strong selling going on right now. Wtf.

FUCK THE ALGOS

this is the bullshit
inside tip, stock will blow the roof
brace brace brace
To sell.those puts
# PUTS AREN'T GOING TO BE ANY CHEAPER FOLKS!
The market sold off too much over the past week and it was mostly retail.  Retail accounts increased in cash and institutional accounts decreased in cash.  Money has been coming back into the market and today we had such a huge run that people started taking profit in the middle of the day. Now at the end of the day you have people covering shorts and/or getting long.  

The key here is where do we end up at the end of the year.  It looks like 350+ on the SPY.
Here comes the drop
SYSTEMATIC SEXISM THAT WOMEN CAN WEAR SKIRTS AND I CANT WEAR SHORTS. WE HAVE RIGHTS
Don't you do this
He didn’t have a track record like he does now.
I’m holding the election means nothing in the end.
Iv is a result not a cause people  don’t get smoked by spy here tomorrow
EVERYBODYYYY HURTSSSS..... bum, bum..... SOMETIIIMES
ok champ, I think trump is going to win but I'm not that retarded/confident
[deleted]
Even Biden has couple more paths to victory. As a matter of fact the same can be said about every presidential election.
[deleted]
Sorry, what????? I can’t understand your comment because of all the weird abbreviations and capitalizations. My girlfriend(which you probably don’t have😂) would never be interested in someone who does not have the basic intellect needed to put together a sentence. Guess which button I pressed on your comment. (hint: it wasn’t the upvote button😂) (hint: it was the downvote button😂)(since you’re probably too dumb to figure it out yourself😂)
First down, VIX takes the snap, no pressure this time they're in zone coverage, VIX steps up and throws one up looking for SPY and he's GOT IT across midfield but he's inbounds! Clock still running and they need to get on the ball! Michael VIX is hurrying everybody back to the line of scrimmage and he clocks the ball
Meanwhile here in CA the card rooms and tribal casinos would rather not let it ever happen than see the other side share in success. Good thing Reno is only a 3.5 hour drive 😭
Easy money
Decided to short Russell 2k as I decided it had least upside most downside - up over 4% in 2 days 🤡

Can someone tell me who’s better for stocks? One minute it’s joe next minute it’s trump lmaooo

His younger brother was really interesting to read about, sounds like he was the OG Tiffany in that no one really gave a shit about him
Rumspringa bitches!

The tug of war going on between bears and bulls... it’s truly 50 50 from what it seems right now. Both sides confident and predicting things to break their way today. I love it. It’s normally pretty obvious the majority of WSB

No
So what you are saying is I can’t do anything with this put???
NIO did the same thing yesterday at market close.  Rocket or drop?
💅🏻
Alright you mothafucka don’t fail me. I’m counting on you.
No way vxx calls go tits up on the week of this historically contentious election. No way at all.

Under two minutes to play, Michael VIX leads the offense back on to the field, no timeouts trying to make something happens. THey'll need several miracles here. VIX takes the snap, three man rush and VIX takes off, 25, 30, and runs out of bounds just shy of the 35
Everything is green except my BABA and Zm man!! I see how it is!! 😔
Bounce that ass for a real ni🅱️🅱️a 😤
It’s like a given Florida will vote trump right ?!
If Trump loses either Florida, Texas or Georgia, it's game over for him. He has to win all 3 of these states just to have a chance at winning.

Don’t think uou need it. Pretty sure everyone already knows.
Your a clown
These guys getting real good at taking my money
If florida goes biden Trump has no route to victory. So basically we could see the effective decision pretty early
I think we are pricing in a contested election. Something about today's run feels like a bull trap. I'm holding mostly cash, a few stocks, and some VIXY calls. We'll see...

All options gunna get IV crushed tomorrow ?
lets make this thread entirely about TA, plays, etc very on topic trading stuff. no one talk politics in this thread please
Dont say I didn’t warn you. I’m not saying circuit breakers but buying on a 2% day is basically asking to lose money
Why it mooned after market open, then why dropped and then why it is mooning now?
Thank you
So Biden win is priced in and if Trump wins we tank?

Bears are extinct after today
Yes please. Selling short term cc’s today to you degenerates.
Yes duh

Edit: actually I may be wrong. The market is probably factoring in a slim (maybe 20%) chance the election is decided tonight (Biden). Assuming that isn’t the case IV may actually go up (I’m retarded and inexperienced) tomorrow due to the fact that the election is going to be a contested lengthy event.

Edit 2: sorry for the “yes duh” I’m drunk
No way it doesn’t pump if Biden is ahead all night.  Stimulus news is bigger than anything right now

Yeah, but I'm buying shares with a trailing stop order. Not calls. Those are probably getting fucked.
I think vix is relatively unaffected tomorrow. maybe even slightly up.
Baba ain’t going to go much lower. 285 the floor even under investigation, earnings won’t drop it unless it’s shockingly low

If president is decided tonight there will be huge IV crush. IV will stay high or go up if things remain uncertain.
no matter who win, as long as there is a result by next morning, tomorrow market gonna be fine

the drop is cancelled dude. It's over. Priced in as fuck.  

Only up from here.
every time you sell a straddle, iron condor, strangle, or any strategy that involves selling volatility (convexity) back into the market your exposure is significantly larger than the actual profit you make. This is for every single small investor, large institutional investor, and Hedge Funds. This is the inherent LEFT TAIL RISK due to exposure and small profits in ANY AND ALL SHORT VOL strategies - The difference between all other strategies you've seen posted is I include your exposure risk and profit. Hence why they say you're "picking up pennies in front of a steam truck" - The amount of profit in terms of overall exposure is very small. Although - if you were to annualise the profit potential on this trade its is off the map despite the inherent left tail risk etc
Why not both?
YOLO PUTS

I have a feeling this thread will end well with no hurt feeling and be the most civil discourse ever witnessed in WSB history.
Well, Michael VIX had the perfect setup here, he had a man open and made a throw to the spot but this is just a brilliant play by Jerome Powell to see the play developing and jump the route, and then look at this sidestep as he evades a tackle from UVXY, just an incredible effort
I always manage to have puts in the biggest rallies of the year. Each time this year, and calls on the bloody days. It’s amazing.

chinese regulators checking out Ant's balance sheet
You are wrong.  The fed doesn't print money to buy bonds, it goes to the commercial banks and buys bonds from them in exchange for reserves.  Banks are not allowed to withdraw or touch their reserves, they can only use the reserves as collateral for loans.  New money is not introduced, rather people leverage themselves with debt and through the fractional reserve banking system that money is amplified--this is where inflation comes from.
What stupid inspirational bullshit. Rich people do all of those things on the left

Dude come on! personal attacks were fine but now you gotta professionally attack me as well? Jesus christ bro
It’s been over
I'm all in on 11/20 calls. 17 days to stop the spread of Coronavirus(aka theta) in my wallet
Went and downvoted every single pro Trump comment 🤓
I’ll leave you with three tickers before close: ICLN, USO, and SWBI
Just send the ticker man I don‘t understand a single word
sort of yea there's a free poll thing
Sources confirmed that AOC is starting an onlyfans and the only way to get access is a picture of a Biden ballot
Just like 2016....

Investment banks are content with the media saying that a Trump win is unlikely so that the market would react bearish. Then these Investment Banks and Hedge Funds swoop in a buy these cheap stocks (fully knowing that Trump would win) and sell at a massive fucking profit out of a Trump win.

Clear as day
flat
Lol good luck
Buying puts
Farewell Chris, I was once a bull too, September changed me... forgive me brother 😞
Puts or calls for tomorrow??
Finally
Nio might get dragged down by all the other clean energy stocks tomorrow, if it does buy the dip
10mins until casino close, get your bets in Boyz!

I bought FIT puts a month ago for a lot more than .02 and I came to find out most days there wasn't a single buyer for that strike and date.  I got lucky some schmuck like me came in without doing research and bought my near worthless options for my original premium.

NIO dipping a bit.. remember ER in two weeks! Been climbing fine under T probably rocket under B. Looks like the market sees it as fine either way.  Thing seems to only drop some on full market drop days.. 15m left
It's probably like 2 feet long.
Why is everything being downvoted to oblivion?!? 🧐

VSTO is the play here. They sell ammunition so they benefit from the whole sector. If you have tried to buy ammo in the last 6 months not only has price tripled but you cant get it's so sold out.

The news article says “amcs outlook is extremely dire as pandemic drags”
I bought Expedia puts when it crossed 99. 11/6 97p. There's no way Expedia comes close to beating or having good forward guidance with all these rising rona cases. That said, I'm sure I'll be -75% on 11/5.
Go to pornhub son you’re imploding
Maybe that's what it is. Both sides being stupidly optimistic about their own side winning. And only one of them will be right.

Welcome to the club. 🐻
Market already has dipped well enough. Companies still are having great earnings. Sales increase in November its still pretty bullish. Election about to be done stimmy should be coming in few months

Would like a BABA EOD pump please
So you breakeven at 407..hmm..if you hold i think you could potentially sell for 4000 but could be worth 1000 on Friday. That's a tough one! If it is a significant portion of your portfolio then you should sell. If it isn't a huge position for you let it ride.
investment banks are buying in right now for a bigly green week
I agree on Florida. Texas isn't vital, as its not super likely to flip. Penn said it'll take until end of week.
-210 Biden
+140 Trump

There’s the current money line
Alright keep telling everyone that 😂
Good luck tomorrow. Sitting this one out.

Do you jerk off?
Believe it or not, ban.
I do not understand why anyone thinks Biden winning is any better or worse than Trump winning. Just because you feel one way about a candidate doesn't mean the whole world or the market feels the same. Even if everyone on your social media agrees with you.
I want to wake up and not remember my positions

Unpopular opinion: NIO is a hype, and everyone’s taking out their frustrations/FOMO for the Tesla bull run last year. Nobody knows why everyone’s buying NIO, just the price is increasing but nobody thinks that the price is increasing so abnormally only because retards are spending their life savings on a stock whose products they haven’t even used.
SPY calls???
Anybody buying UVXY shares at close?
Let them be, I need someone to sell puts to!
Yeah looks like they’re pricing in a Biden large victory and a democratic senate. But from what I’m hearing on the news, there are some unexpected delays in the key states so I feel chaos

I put a decent sized bet on Kanye to get 0-199,000 votes. If I'm wrong, probably going to move to Canada because I live amongst retards.
Have you read the comments around here?  People were expecting a drop like March to happen starting today.  I will say though, I for one was not expecting us to just pump like we did today.  I had TSLA calls yesterday and I decided to turn them into bear call spreads to because I figured we'd stay flat, and yah - they're in the money now and I'm getting ass raped.

This makes no sense. People let the market tank for a week and then the day of the election decide, "actually, I think Biden will win even though the polling/percentages have been the same for literally 6 months."
No way we should be this green today. I’m buying spy puts for tomorrow
Upvote for Biden
Lol you make 400k.  Alright buddy 👍🏻
TRUMP SOUNDS DEFEATED AHHHH FUCK!
So what's your point. I'm not trying to push politics.

Sure the market may not show greater returns from "sell off before taxes", but that doesn't account for the other economic measures, which make up the fundamentals of the market in the first place. 

What you're saying basically boils down to "prices change, but value doesn't"

So if a blue sweep gives us a pullback, buy the fuckin dip.
Thank you Xpev 🙏🏼

I hope so. I have been all during this last dip. I bought the dip too early but it has still been very profitable.
No.
I often ask myself, on a daily basis, if GME is the answer to my prayers. My beliefs were shaken recently, but I have finally see the light. GME o' child, take me to the promised land of tendies. My faith is eternal and will remain unshaken in these dark times, I pronounce to thee.

Wait at least until mid day tomorrow. Then, do not touch the options. Buy shares in waves. 

People here don't know of refuse to care to know that options are essentially buying the first and second derivatives of the stock price function. In a volatile time like this, the second derivative doesn't converge to anything, so you have no idea where the price will go.
Volatility my ass
It’s pretty true. I have a BS in Economics and an MA in applied economics and an MQM (Masters in Quantitative Management) as well. And the first question people ask when they find out what I did in college is about the economy and stocks. And it’s a dumb question and they don’t even realize it. Like I spent years learning about scarcity and a bunch of basically applied calculus and statistics. 

Unless I work directly for a brokerage I wouldn’t have enough time to make an informed decision any one way or the other, and even then it would only be a best estimate and one with enough of a likely chance to not be correct that it would be pretty irresponsible to give an opinion on it. 

I can fully do the math behind it sure, but the stock market has proven time and time again that it’s irrational and not really predictable with any algorithm. There is a reason that economic theory even says throwing a dart at a chart of stocks and picking where it lands is just as likely to be accurate than if you picked it based on extensive amounts of DD and research. 

But I just point people towards index’s, tell them if they aren’t retiring in the next 5 years don’t be afraid or worried that the stock market drops every now and then etc etc. 

tl;dr Economists don’t study the economy they study scarcity. I’d be extremely skeptical of any economist claiming to know what the market will do or that they have figured out the stock market. We exist to do small scale data analysis, or to advise large scale economic moves aka monetary/fiscal policy, we aren’t adept at guessing small movements within certain markets. And if we’re in a spot where we can then we are also in a spot where the sec would have something to say if we profited off it.

Okay, so I was a manager at AMC before the pandemic began. This company is too mismanaged to stay in business.

First of all, most of the theaters are falling apart (I'm talking about the previously owned by Carmike theaters.) They are filled with mold, old/broken equipment, etc. Before the pandemic, they already couldn't afford the necessary repairs.

Individual theaters waste way too much money when it comes to inventory. That's mostly because they've chosen bad food products to sell (i.e. stuff that goes bad quickly or things no one wants.) They also do not have enough control over spending when it comes to cleaning supplies; theaters waste thousands of dollars on unnecessary supplies, and their theaters are still disgusting. Also, the teenagers who work there are super wasteful and honestly steal a ridiculous amount of food. Oh, and projector light bulbs are $1,000+ each.

And an important point, AMC made that really bad deal with universal to only have movies play for a few weeks before it can be moved to streaming or something. That's ridiculous and is terrible news for AMC. Mostly because studios have it set to where if they have a movie playing at your theater, you HAVE to play it once every set. So if there's a movie that's been out for 2 months, you have to play it alongside the new movies. So say, in the future, a big movie comes out, but there's only 1 blockbuster and 5 older indie films. AMC can't JUST play the blockbuster-- they have to reserve other screens for the other movies. They can only give the other screens to the blockbuster at the last minute IF no one buys tickets to the indie film. But if the movies are being moved to streaming services, no one is going to opt to see the indie movie when they find out the blockbuster is sold out. Not to mention the limited seating to allow for social distancing.

The thing is, AMC was already broke before the pandemic.. The business model just doesn't apply as well as it used to. If they survive, they'll definitely have to close all the older locations. I have looked at 2020 as the "nail in the coffin" for AMC. They had a good 100 years of business..

These two elections are nothing alike. Undecideds are far smaller, and the margin of error for polling would have to be off ***even more*** than it was for 2016.
Feel like election results are priced in UNTIL Trump starts tweeting BS and getting people riled up
so how do you gamble on the election with the stock market?
If you don't vote for Trump it's a vote for Biden

SPY calls expiring early 2021 a good idea?
I'm down
You´ve missed 350 EOD tomorrow, but I´ve got your back.
it's exponentially more complicated than just stealing checks. you'd have to steal all the votes, open all the envelopes including the inner ones that are signed by the voter, throw away the ones from the candidate you don't like, reseal the votes for the candidate you do like in new envelopes that have a plausible signature that matches the real signature (because they do compare them with software) then reseal them in new legit outer envelopes that match the ones from the board of elections, and then mail them all again without being noticed
Typically when a meme stock gets hyped here,  it dies after couple of days,  so Buy puts Thursday on Nio.  It happens every fukkin time

Anyone buying calls into end of the day?
Especially annoying ones
Implied volatility means that there is a higher chance the call is in/out of the money therefore there is more risk which increases the premium. Your breakeven is still the same but you’d make money selling them today

you're not really providing a scale here…
you didn't buy high, you bought with the expectations that they were going to achieve 100% growth 10 years straight and then start returning cash to investors at an aggressive rate.  I don't have your optimism, but its not like they can't do that.

Wow, this market is rallying now because orange says he predicts “red wave”. Bruh that’s what that pump was just now.

This is incorrect because those bonds are largely sold to the FED (via their intervention in the secondary bond market - they don't buy at auction) in this case; not bond investors. The Fed obviously does print money out of thin air

Why is anyone even asking this? Just using the available data, it's pretty easy to ascertain who would be priced in for a landslide.
No such thing
I got January calls for the low low
until 4:15 yes
Question - if Biden wins and dems take Senate, they won't actually hold office until Jan. Why would Trump and Repub senate go along with a stimulus bill in that case? Wouldn't they just sit on their hands until Jan so they can claim some sort of "fiscal conservatism" that they always revert to when they are in the opposition?

No reason for a huge pullback honestly.

They've got multiple events lined up, and theyre chilling around where analysts have their targets

Probably a small pullback and some consolidation due to everyone buying in, early investors may want to lock profits in.
NIO at 35 still seems like a good buy to me... maybe I’ll drop a grand in. I want to wait for a dip, but it’s climbing each day

Drinking is beginning a bit early today gentlemen, breaking out the imperial stouts for tonight’s election fuckery.
Yes that is what happened in 2000, but also 1800, 1824, and in 1877 when Congress ended up determining the winner.  If that same thing happened now, Trump would win (because despite Dems controlling votes, the Republicans have state delegation majority).  So there is a clear strategy to contest the election results in one or more state, have SCOTUS kick the decision to Congress, and win it there.  Alternatively, if Biden wins in swing states with GOP-controlled state legislatures, they can simply replace those electors with Trump ones.  


That's probably what the dude is betting on.  If he wins, he wins.  If he loses, he still has a couple more paths to victory.
HYLN ER is 11/12...I mean it can't be worse than booking solar panel installation revenues, probably worth a flier eh?

What is this? An IPO for ANTs?
tomorrow
Apple puts -70% lol
Break even price - from my understanding - is meant on expiration day. If the contract doesn’t hit that price by expiration day then you lost money on the contract even if it is in the money. Example, say you have a $10c and paid $1 for it, then if the stock value doesn’t hit $11 or over it on expiration day then you lost money on the trade even if you do exercise the contract. This goes the same way for selling contracts.
Just trying to lighten the mood.
Is their primary income fees or mortgage spreads?
That is talking about break even price at expiry.
If Trump wins we are gonna hit 360 by EOD tomorrow.
it's a tank. wish I just put everything in carrier 3 months ago

So you are aware that it’s because IV is more then double what it normally is on SPY rn? That’s why premiums are more then double the price. If we have clear results tonight we should see many posts made about why peoples calls/puts value dropped by half overnight.
Does that consider deposits and extractions and all that ?

stop r/gatekeeping autists use tiktoks too
When ? Don’t say 2000 because that’s not what happened.
this genuinely made me laugh
There have been 6 posts with PLTR in the past 7 days (yes I sorted by PLTR new and counted), and in the past 10 trading days it's 9.20 to 11.34 and now it's at \~10.50 so again. What?

PLTR got major legs, people on Wall Street are buying it life fucking fire. Just hasn't had institutional hop because of the lack of guidance and earnings report. The people at those institutions are buying it like fucking crazy though.
You realize after the election everything's going to moon; right?

Latter is no different than any other day fam. Sometimes they come back just to flash the DOW/SP 500 for 5 seconds and then go back for another 3 min break
Ok fair. But it’s not true. They don’t want a stimulus because they want everyone back at work. That won’t change if Trump wins.
She sounds fine.
Didnt Biden say he wasn’t going to legalize but leave it up to the states?
Mango just declare civil war so I can buy the dip

I’m in such disbelief at how fucking retarded this market has become. I’m sitting here ass clenched watching SQQQ hoping it runs like would only make sense, but instead, a fucking few hours before an election, you fucking idiots are pumping the goddamn market
H&S on the SPY? 👀
Thanks. If it gets to 1pm and has reversed back to your open price, or stayed flat, you close out around 15-20% loss? I'm going to try with a small position tomorrow morning, as there'll most likely be a move one way or the other.

Calls on PLTR, government gotta SPY on rioters
Its not propaganda its the reason the Republicans gave
probably because they don't have the backing of the CCP
Anyone look at VERY (Very Good Food company)? This shit is up over 100% in 5 days. I saw this jump 20%+ a few days ago and decided to stay away. FML
Any chance RIDE hits $20 end of the week?
imagine trump is elected tonight, market crashes right  
but the democrats camp says that there are still some mail in votes that were not counted, and after counting them in the next days, BIDEN wins ! Market is gonna go craaaaazy GUYS this is the opportunity of a lifetime !  Buy puts today, and calls on friday !!
This head and shoulders forming on SPY should spur a nice EOD dump to below premarket levels
RIP VIX call holders
What are your moves for tomorrow?? Today is over
Ok Warren Buffett.
Nothing election related is priced in. The only thing priced in is fucking over your options whether it be puts or calls.

tomorrow morning is gonna be like christmas
nothing burger
Nothing to see here, same news as this morning
Dumb question here. If you look at the break even price, it's $26.95, but the options are clearly making money today What am I not understanding correctly? If I theoretically sold these today, would I actually be losing money since it's not at the break even? Doesn't appear that way?

Nah that’s just propaganda. Blue states aren’t the ones who need bailing out. New York and California contribute more to GDP than all red states combined. And the bad outbreaks are in red states now. Don’t buy that BS. The entire southeast is bankrupt (all red states) and bailed out by blue states. This has been the case for decades. The state that takes the most federal funds is Kentucky.
Is this classified as DD or YOLO?
they did not fix auto timing from daylight savings time yet.  mods busy with butt stuff I guess.
You act like you're surprised.
For this option i have(ACB ticker), volume is listed as 0.  For ACB, volume is listed at 22 mil.

I was thinking the same lol

Except bc of rh diamon hands mode I made a lot of moolah which would be a lot coolah if I didn’t blow it all on options lol

1) Spy opens at 340

2) Spy opens at 330

Well Gus, you saw it right there, Michael VIX absolutely threaded the needle on that throw and would have set his team up, but what a costly mistake to commit holding right now in this situation, you know he's gonna get chewed out on the bench for that one. Just a crucial mental mistake right there.

BIG BRAIN MOVE BEFORE CLOSE ?
If u plan on going long.. buy anytime now.. this might be a 100 in a couple years..

calls obv
I am calling the police.
about to FOMO into 40 11/6 NIO calls. yes or no?
Hopefully, BABA does move though pretty regularly though. Lets hope for a bounce quicker than the end of Nov. lmao 11/20 calls ftw
Guys, even if SPY is slowly going lower, VIX is dead.  
  
R.I.P volatility.
If you spent your stimulus check, the choice is clear. More spy calls.

Are you telling me my LKN shares won't print?

real shit - I'm bullish on Biden. Buy solar and weed now or listen to Cramer and wait until tomorrow's inevitable dip (no matter who wins) and buy anything?

3M and 6M charts for SPY and NDX look pretty bearish honesty. Especially the 3M one, easy to see a falling wedge and we don't really have a catalyst to break that pattern yet.
I hope EVERYONE voted. I do not want to see another 4year of SHITSHOW.

Ouch.

BABA is too big for it to amount to anything in the long run IMO, seems like a prime chance for a long-term buy once the bottom is found.
I had 50 15 jan21 calls o bought for .80 cents each when it was 7 bucks in july... Sold for a loss when it dipped to 6 bucks... Coulda made 5k into 100k

I’m not retarded or anything, I know it’s bc of the election betting but it’s crazy how high premiums are this week compared to next week
The fact that there's an algo out there that looks at the headline "Comcast and Walmart making a smart TV" and immediately calculates "This is bad for ROKU" and dump it faster than the human eye and brain can process the same headline is fucking terrifying.

I believe the real cost of those cars was around $800-$1,000 which would make the price comparible. 

Those cars were very simple. No air conditioning, no seatbelts, no safety\crash requirements\airbags\seatbelts, no stereo, no automatic transmission
And it’ll continue to do that til next week
Good shit homie
Ali Bobbers please go up to -5% before close

Yep, that's a 10 yard holding penalty, I didn't see who was holding at this stage of the game but they must be pretty retarded. That sets up a 3rd and long for Michael VIX and this offense

Market isn’t pricing in anything today, it’s doing what it does best in moments like this, playing fuckary.
I'll follow up with the subreddit.  Good look.
Well obviously it won't keep climbing forever but I think it'll at least hit $40 before January.
I concur.
Slow on their payments to the local party heads, now they are gonna have to give the govt more of the company, install the requisite backdoors etc

Arent those the equivalent of you getting an email about a somalian prince getting an inheritance and wanting your bank account info to send you 10 million?
I know about IV (different guy now btw), but how much will it affect the price of my puts? Obviously there will be IV crush but I have January 2021 SPY puts, strike is 300. Will these be down 25% tomorrow just with IV?
I guess nobody told automod about the time change
Gonna celebrate being down only 50% today with a nice Asian lady (:
It means the market's going to stage a fast recovery post-election; or volatility is going to skyrocket.
Why the voice of reason in the bear fantasy ?
Switched to calls. Got some VXX for tomorrow maybe. It's obvious the market wants to rocket after this is over.

nothing, there is no reason to enter a bunch of trades EOD.  Wait until open.
The Republicans dont wanna pass it right now because they dont want to bail out blue states but I think that is only because the election was coming up, they know a bailout is needed so they will pass one after the election when a compromise is reached with the Dems

Where you got this stats
Odds ratios are a horrible representation. It kinda works when you assume some info: 37/20 meaning roughly 2/1, so a win for Trump gets a weight of 2/3. Hence the payout of 15 million includes the original 5 million the banker paid for the bet. A profit of 10 million remains.

Disclaimer: odds ratios are confusing af and I don't understand why anybody uses them in a serious context. For humanity's sake just use probabilities and returns.

It is because it is the EOM options before Thanksgiving rather than weeklies.  Same with 18 Dec 20, 15 Jan 21 in terms of open interest.  Its all open strangles/straddles it seems because they consolidate at the 1,2,3 standard deviation moves etc.  Or are you talking about the skew?

I convinced myself not to FOMO into Zoom back in April because I assumed that the pandemic was already fully priced in by then
Biden wins by a cunt's hair, trump contests, investigation, gap down, circuit breakers, gay bear seminal fluids all over the walls...
NIO leaps for late 2021 at the lowest strike price you can afford or if you want to be a bit more conservative AAPL leaps for late 2021 at the lowest strike price you can afford.
looks to me like it's shuffling in.

Dang, are they lifting the circuit breaker policy for you
Let the dump begin!
#$FUCK
All long dated calls. That’s just me though, I don’t fuck with puts.
if you don't know sell all your shit and just come back when you're learned some.
Don't think we're going below 335
When this shit isn't gonna be decided tonight it's gonna dump so hard tomorrow
No but maybe you're sexually attracted to clothing and not people though.
^(OMG WSBSYNTH is up again. When did this happen?)
510c 11/13, Avg @ $6.30. let's Yolo.
Sell and reenter later or do CSP or CC but my advice will be to lock current profit

Need a yolo from a mega autist asap
Hell yea, vegas is going to be a madhouse when this gets going again. I went in 2013, getting an uber back took forever. Camping sounds like a good move, just watch out for those dam clark county sheriffs.

anyone thinking of picking up vxx calls or no?

Time to turn your calls into spreads folks
Very bullish power hour
Bought PFE 40c sold 47c. I have no clue why PFE 47c is $25 rn, even with a vaccine there’s no way it’s going that high lmao
And then some! Leverage is a day traders best friend
Why is an iv crush assumed for tomorrow? Serious question
I feel like I'm constantly yelling at Robinhood the same thing you bears yell to those green dildos.

FILL MY SHIT
you know it babe
Sheesh finance degree? You know what's worse about it all, all the money we paid for degrees and you will now have this Covid generation of youngins who got into robinhood, burned their accounts but will know what a fucking iron condor is just by watching kamikaze cash and losing a few bills instead of getting raped with student loan debt.
Imagine not having both.
Sell. All the positive news about stock repurchase and support for Dorsey helped the stock today. Check your risk appetite, if you don’t wanna mess with these gains take the profit. If tomorrow’s red, you can put these bucks to better use. If not, you’ll still likely do okay. I’d say, just don’t fuck with your yolo today
Nah, i aint gay no more 😡

If it stops moving higher like tsla you’re gonna start losing

My nutsac is going to bounce off your chin.
VIX going down and market going down is bad. VXX naturally decays over time so the volatility increase has to outweigh the time decrease
I have a $45 leap. So come on baby

Neither Biden nor Trump can pass a stimulus FFS. Republicans in the Senate have made it clear they don't want one. The only thing that can bring a stimulus is D's win the Senate

The Chinese never stops pumping. It's written in their 5 year plan.

If Merrill's numbers are correct, SPY's volume today with an hour to go isn't even half that of Wednesday and Friday sell off volumes
I mean it’s California so they probably will? Also, they are probably gonna have terrible earnings. That may be priced in already though.

Who said 20% otm covers was safe for Nio 🙃

I can't see everything, but it's probably the bid-ask spread. If few people are trading that option and the price changes significantly it might note change the market price of that option until more bids are placed. Just remember that with an option that's in the money, it's worth the amount of profit it's already gained that very second and then some (because it also could gain more value later).

Candy canes are cheaper and u get to taste the minty ass flavor after your done.
Damn it rlly is Election Day, let that sink in... we will see chaos tn
Sell off with elections? If Biden wins it’s sure to rocket even more
But that ticker is nice tho
[removed]
Dumb question but I rarely use them, do options stop losses trigger after hours?
BABA is too big to fail. They have access to over 700m people in china alone.
What a nice guy, selling his cheap so more people can buy lower
I mean who ever get elected is going to pass stimulus so long gold?

SPY upsies or downsies
I'm pretty sure Build-A-Bear is just 8 retail traders and one of them left today.
no good reasons
Clock running, here's Michael VIX back to pass again, he pump fakes, loads up and sails one down the right sideline to SPY and IT'S CAUGHT! What a throw by Michael VIX!
Nah, there's always WSB.
vxx going down market going down. that's bad right? since it means volatility is going down so market will go towards the way it's going which is currently down?
Waiting for it to come down abit before i buy, what you guys think?
Not into politics but all I know is, if Biden wins he better erase my 10k remaining in student loan debt like he promised.
Waiting for that last 5 minute ______ dildo like Fri

Nope go for it
So tired of the “if this happens America will riot” comments. 

We’re lazy. Even the riots this year were over in 2 days.

Unrest is irrelevant
imagine not giving the people want they really want: Q4 stimulus for that phatty Santa Rally pump
Thanks for the feedback! Renting now is substantially cheaper than what my mortgage was. My overhead is way less. No more taxes, and insurance on the house. As well as landscaping. I’m actually considering backpacking through Asia where you can live super comfortably for less than 12k a year. Live minimally. Let my investments grow, then retire early.
I grabbed some 5C lottos.
Should i buy a green or red dildo for christmas this year
Has to swing hard one way or the other if the results come out tonight
Spread and volume is my guess.
Keep selling off faster than SPY, crapple.  That's a good boy.

Idk I see the numbers are up this week so far but I've still got a chub going on, think my body knows something I don't.
Why is it always that the options I’m short on always go ITM while the ones I buy immediately go the other way
Ah is that what it is? Idr what Iv was yesterday. It’s still 125% today. Must’ve been like 175 or something yesterday. I’m done buying weeklies. I get fucked 9/10 if I hold overnight

There will be a official result. Might take time but it’s impossible to not have a clear result.

If Trump wins, Americans will riot. If Biden wins, Americans will riot. People are boarding up shop windows in preparation for tonight. I don't see a good outcome here. Positions: SPY 310 puts 1dte, NIO 23 puts because I think this sub is hyping the stock too much, and don't worry - I am frequently wrong about the stonk monket. Good luck everybody, and God help us all.

I would go long into solar and green energy but that’s just me
Good point, I didnt consider that. I guess my 401k account will be grateful for that. I hope market overreact and tanks though (with a quick recovery of course).
Feeling big green dick energy on GME
Not a leap and high iv decay
Nio napkin math 
So nio doubles deliveries to  5k deliveries a month 
So let’s say they are on track to deliver 80k in the next year. Let’s say each car averages 50k. That equates to 4bln in revenue. So they are trading right now @ 9x revenue
Nio literally only goes up
So I’m balls deep in SQQQ and this fake ass support is pissing me off. Stop fucking around and sell off like we all know it will.

Finally-FUCK keep going
so puts?
They still expire 1/15/21?
Real talk, no politics. Did anything get done in regards to the China Trade war?
Sour hour commence
Outlook good
Question: Anyone got an insight, anecdotal or other, on how suburban Beckies are voting? You know, the kind that likes to vote for RINOs and went for Trump last time as lesser of two evils.
All in ACB weeklies. Let’s get this short squeeze started.
No one’s losing money on NIO unless they are betting against it bruh
Lol EtFs
Ok Drake
Bullish close or 🐻 close?
I remember when these shares were a dollar. Turns out that would have been a good time to load up
I may miss out on some gains but the amount of people saying nio 11/6 calls made makes me content with my 30% gains on getting out of those today

Check back tomorrow if I still feel the same lol
Unless you are shooting Teslas into space you don’t have fuck you money.
If you just opened your account I assume you don't have options enabled or have any significant settled funds in it. You've probably already missed it. 

We all pretty much have taken positions and just waiting to see big red or big green.

I got SPY Nov 20 '20 $350 Call￼s which, by some miracle, might actually make me money or at least break even. I also got SPY $315 put for December 31st.

I've got $3300 that was earmarked for ANT waiting in my fidelity account, BABA is a good call IMO.
Every situation and market is going to be different, so you'll have to play around with it to see if it makes sense for you and your risk profile.

Generally hedging with puts from the get-go is really expensive and a pretty serious drag on your portfolio and oftentimes not worth it, and the kind of stocks that you'd want to hedge on (read: high-volatility WSB-approved yolo stocks) are even *more* expensive to hedge, so it really has to be a moon-shot for you to come out on top.

In this particular case the OP was in a unique position where he had already taken on all the front-load risk and won big, so now hes far enough away from his original price where he has an opportunity to "let it ride" and hedge at his entry price for basically free.

What if there is no official result because several states are "in dispute"?  The argument won't be "I lost but I get to stay", the argument will be "this election was broken and the results are ultimately inconclusive".  

It's like if you're playing games with a guy and he starts complaining that his controller is broken.  He's not going for a win, he's going for a "this round doesn't count".
He’s way less verbally anti China than trump for starters but even his policy doesn’t target it as much. Remember in the second debate when they were asked the biggest foreign threat? Trump said China Biden said Russia.
My retard put spread offer will fill then 😎
... was doing two 6's at a time. Shit had me way too jacked. Had to put that shit down.
Hoping to get one more sweet entry point for BABA before the end of the day. 280 and under would be perfect
ive been waiting for a sub 35 NIO dip to jump back in
This level of profit on stocks is going to make you believe you can only make more off of options. When you inevitably blow up your account trying I’ll be here to laugh. Good luck though
The Russell is up about 3% from last night. They're pricing in good news for small caps.
Long HLYN instead. They actually have a working product.

There’s always the possibility of having co-presidents

I mean at this rate I could see it getting there but yeah it was prob too high of a strike to pick
I hope you’re right!
It doesn't matter who wins the election. What matter is that we'll only have one winner.
If SPY breaks 338 I swear to god.....
I have $5,000 in cash waiting to get 2023 leaps if market tanks 10% of more post elections. My current plan is:
$1500 in RKT
$1500 in HYLN
$2,000 in BABA

WSB hivemind, is this genius or completely retarded?
Ok

NIO🚀🚀
Wondering why Jeff Bezos Is pro democrat... I guess he likes to get fucked.
Yeah but you're not me and I'm buying puts
While you guys are losing money at NIO. I’m longing NKLA and will retire in 4 years
Holding AH?
We dump into close.  Once election is over there is no political motivation to pass a giant stimulus. On the off hand we get a blue wave and they do go ahead and pass the 3t stimulus, that means taxes go up everywhere.
Nope. It’s what zerohedge says some single unnamed “strategist” at JPM says. It could be made up. It could be some crazy uncle guy who works there with a political bent.  It’s the equivalent of any tabloid trash out there
it did bro we are almsot +2% on all indexes
I bought at around the top yesterday and just barely made back the money I lost today, then I sold.
The power of wsb
Killing it.
wtf SPY $350 calls expiring tomorrow are selling for .35?????? I was gonna buy like 1000 and thought they'd be like .05
do it
I work at your mom's house
SQ, AMD, and ROKU have ruined me. Gonna need a miracle.
Who else getting drunk while the votes pour in? Pretty upset we won’t get most results of election tonight, last election was pretty lit to watch.
expire tomorrow
322
RKT got to 19.99 and was like “nah, 20’s is unknown territory to me which I must avoid”
If bloody green probably it won’t considering it’s still pretty high
We’re still in a downward trend as it’s becoming more clear how overvalued tech is right now. With a pump tomorrow lots of people will buy calls, causing MMs to buy more shares to stay delta neutral, pushing us high enough for whales and institutions to get a good exit point.
Are you just arguing the semantics of it? That IV is crushing your options and not the other way around?

Honest question: will buying calls for VIX be a genius idea? it would be either bloody red or bloody green so VIX will go through the roof no??
Ah we’re back to this one?
Name is on point lol. And with that Vega is the change of option price for 1% movement in IV the same way Delta changes the option price with $1 movement in underlying stock price, yeah?
I hope spy tanks tomorrow I’m deep in 11/6 SPY 300p

Alright I’m done for today. Made some nice gains on QQQ calls and VIX puts.
Then it's not directed at you, Wattsun 210.  It's directed at these fuckers who be like, "IV goNna CRuSh yOooO guYSH!!"
What are y'all holding over night?
You sound like these evangelists from a church down the street
I see what you are saying; you don't want to buy some calls and place some spreads and have the price move away from you.

I'd put limit orders in, I usually do that by default. So when I placed the original put spread, the spread was at 1.50, my limit was for 1.7. MM's came to me. Same with the calls.

That is also why I advise running a continuous theta strategy around your calls and put spread to make up any differences and reduce max pain to 0

I, an atheist, accidentally said “oh my g*d” instead of “oh my science” when I saw NIO go up.
You read the title, I just cannot believe I said the “g” word on accident. Am I even an atheist anymore? I don’t like religion or anything but like maybe it infiltrated me and is manipulating me to say “oh my g*d” instead of “oh my science”. Please guys it wasn’t me, I didn’t mean it. I’m very disappointed in myself, I think I need to go to science camp or go to therapy. What if I’m secretly religious? what should I do? Is my foreskin going to fall off?? Please can someone give me advice, any advice is appreciated.

God I hope my bear homies didn’t load up on puts to play the election. Ain’t shit gonna happen, the IV crush is gonna wipe your 10% gains (if you do gain), and the market is gonna have a face ripping rally after all the election uncertainty is over. All the blue balled cash portfolios are gonna nut all over your stonks after their gold hedges start dropping.

**This Very Good Food stock. Its amazing what you can do with a low share float on a penny stock. Make sure every insider holds most of their shares but then slowly sell into the market while hyping the shit out of it on YouTube. Shoot the bitch up on low volume. And make sure you're in a sector thats on trend, in this case they combined plant based and tech. Its now approaching 500 million market cap on 1 million sales. And they spent 2 mil to get those sales. Mostly on youtube promoters. Where the fuck is the SEC lol**
Any advice/tips on how to shave your own back? My wife usually does it but I am away for a few months and it is starting to look like a shaggy bathroom rug.

Listen, dumb fucks, IV is not something you feed into options pricing model, it's one of the things that comes *out* of it. 

Price precedes IV; IV is a reflection of that fucking movement of price.  If MMs increase the price of an option due to an expected move in the underlying, IV changes.  IV does NOT fucking go up and down, crushing and inflating price. 

Fucking hell, the mythologizing around here just keep you mother fuckers dumb.

Yup. We’re gonna have a ton of revenue go overseas as well that’ll need to be repatriated and we’ll have to offer lower tax rates for that to happen. This is a big thing from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts that everyone forgets.

Bruh, we talking about options. Its about what the hot stocks are and nothings hotter than NIO right now
none of these companies will they own the government.
Momentus has developed a water-fueled propulsion system and vehicle called Vigoride to provide that “last mile” transportation to satellites once they are launched into space on rockets. After test-flying a prototype in 2019, Momentus has lined up a partnership with SpaceX and signed contracts with small satellite operators, notably the internet-of-things play Swarm, to ferry their spacecraft to the right orbit.

The company is effectively a middleman—its backers call it a space infrastructure company—that enables SpaceX and other rocket makers to provide more flexible service, while allowing satellite operators to spend more time and resources on their spacecraft’s payload than on figuring out how to get it where it’s going.

Will BABA go up or down if Jack Ma disappears suddenly?
Should’ve adjusted to 1000 for inflation
I think it's Australian
It’s kind of a big deal, right?
That's before they even report earnings. I think you should buy further out or lower the strike if you can. Not sure what's going on today, but over the past few months NIO's held pretty flat and only been bumped up when there's good news.
The Premium on VXX my gd lol
Is today a big sell day because of the election? I'm presuming if its undecided tonight the market will tank tomorrow.
not yet but working on it
Guys I am not gonna touch NIO because it will stop mooning once I do

Unless I feel spiteful
Not just serial killers, but studies are trying to link leaded gasoline babies to the crack era as well.
I think we're past that stage where the government is strong enough to break up large companies.

The sole exception to this could be the US Postal Service as it is "privatized" depending on who wins the election.

There is always a bounce. Even during the March crash the market would never go more than 10-12% down before bouncing up 5%. We were at 10% down just two days ago and at the fat September correction support. It's tempting fate to start shorting at that point.

With that said, I have no idea where the market's going to go after this point. We're at the crossroads where we're neither overbought or oversold.

Both should be above 500

SVXY is going to the moon on Friday, mark my words.
First time here and already a 🌈🐻
NIO is valued more than Tesla in terms of delivery numbers. NIO’s market cap is 40 billion whereas Tesla is 400 billion. Tesla delivered 140k vehicles in Q3 with positive EPS whereas Nio delivered 12k vehicles with most probably negative EPS. NIO’s delivery numbers are almost 12 times less than Tesla. At this valuation NIO is expected to grow faster than Tesla. And it doesn’t even account for Tesla’s innovation in batteries and self driving. No thanks, I will just invest in Tesla.
At what TIME should I grab popcorn and watch TV

Looks like NIO, XPEV, and LI are all Chinese EV makers that’ll be competing in China with NIO’s market cap greater than the latter two combined. Doesn’t seem bad to invest in all three but they’re all pretty much ATH right now and approaching overbought (RSI above 65 atm) on the 1D.

The moment we get more stimmy a new crop of robinhood traders are going to pile into this and it will be the next hertz
I've said it before and I'll say it again. I would absolutely have sex with Betty White. I would look forward to her teaching me things that I'm not really flexible enough to imagine, and I would tell anyone who would listen and describe our time together in excruciating detail.

When she outlives me I hope she comes to my funeral and speaks fondly of our passionate night together.
We green because the uncertainty of a contested election is minimal. I don’t believe today’s price action is based on who actually wins but the fact we will have a winner
IF YOU ARE NOT PLAYING THE RISING IV INTO ER ON SQ DO YOU EVEN LIKE MONEY?
Someone must have said "computer, enhance" like 10x in a row.  Cause I don't think the original was in color and had i-phone like resolution.

Jerome Powell thinks he can kill VIX, but what do we say to SATAN? Not today!
Doubtful. Market thinks Biden will win, and apparently likes it, today at least. Betting it's priced in to a degree.

I take from responsibility. Is not my fault
I'm saying there is a silver lining to the unfortunate reality of war.  Technological advancments, strong people, and new alliances are made.  I do not care if you are trans, but I do think the rise in it's popularity is a sign of a decaying society.  I'm sorry if that sounds harsh, it's nothing against them as individuals.
That’s now he it works. Trump refusal to accept the verdict has no impact on betting market. They go by official result.
BABA back to 300 by Thursday or Friday... watch.
A for effort, F for fuck you
If it's not, security escorts Trump out. What exactly do people think is going to happen? lol
Yessir, cause I’m early. Asset managers usually trade on a Q/Q basis, very rarely more than 4months out. So essentially, I’m trying to front run these bitches

Also, now you know I ain’t lying lol
First one will pay. 2nd one is less risky than people think. People are hung up on the fact that polls were off last time. If anything pollsters are hedging towards trump this time to avoid embarrassment.
I agree but my issue just like with other “things” I take it to excess. End up dipping all day and makes me feel like shit. Needing a good shower and tooth brushing to feel any better. A good weekend morning shit dip is great tho
This is the way

SPY is a ETF, there aren't any earnings for it. It represents a collection of stocks. I think AAPL and AMZN are apart of SPY, so look for those earnings if you want an outlook.

word from the wise: not a good idea to play earnings right now if you expect them to moon.

No leave ACB alone, they have bad management, big losses quarter after quarter with profits no where in sight. Canadian stocks allow dilution so they get watered down and that kills your stock value. PLNHF is similar market cap and is a killing it in Nevada. 1 location does 12% of the states sales and their expanding to SoCal Q1 2021. The industry is growing big but there is a lot of shit companies too, the etfs MJ and HMLSF are not good investments because they have the losers. Pick your top 2-3 favorites. 
Also I've heard good things about GTBIF but i'm not familiar with the fundamentals.  Cheers bro I hope this gives you some insight and makes you a couple bucks.

Careful. The mods will ban you if you "talk politics." They're a special sort.

This is the way
Reason for being up I have to guess is because today is election and it has been said that stimulus will be coming after election. So I mean could be due partly to that.

I read a post of someone making 1000% Off of an earnings call a few months back, I think it was on Tesla back in April? Or maybe when they announced deliveries for march, cant remember.

Anyways my question is, when does $SPY announce earnings next?
[deleted]
Nah he added more images on his other accounts, so the total is 1000, we're cool. 

BAN for shares not calls tho
$11c PLTR 11/7 @.20-25,
$12.50c PLTR 11/20 @.35-.50

$130c AAPL 12/18 $130 @.85-.90

Holy shit, dude. That is fucked up.

Walmart is making a smart tv.
Anyone else just sell a condor on SPY today?
Peloton has earnings this week and PTON options have massive premiums. Very tempting for theta plays.
This is what will happen, once the election results come out, it will be red as fuck cause of uncertainty what x president winning imply, and the pre-market retards will FOMO sell, then everyone will realize that the election doesn't even matter and it'll then it will pump all the day until it's 3% up for the day.
if Trump wins, long cruiselines, airlines, and USO?

Hey, this is great. Thanks for breaking it down. I still badly need to learn some better hedging strategies, and my sense is that options are the way to go. 

How often would you use this sort of a protection strategy, generally? On any position that's more than X% of your portfolio? Or any position that has gained at least +Y%?
You'll see when your puts expire worthless

Disclaimer: I’m not a professional and otherwise completely unqualified for anything but my feelings.

Now, with our debt exceeding GDP the only way the USofA can repay its debt is via inflation.

I bought an AMC $2.5 call yesterday for $11 and the stock went down .20 and my call value went up $4... ended up sellling this morning snd making a $6 profit. I’m going to use the profit to take my fiancé and her boyfriend to go see Nanny McPhee 2 when the theaters reopen.

Retard, I have not had a very interesting day, so my mind has been wandering, I found myself asking myself a question after watching a shrek meme, exactly how big is shreks dick.

Firstly o researched the average penis size worldwide which was reported to be 5.16 inches when erect. Based on this I found out what the average height was in the swampy country of Rwanda, the data shows the average hieght is 5ft 2 inches. With this data I calculated that the average penis is 12.0155% of the human body in Rwanda.

Using this data I searched up what is shreks height, the most common answer was 8ft (96 inches) based on the findings of my previous data I calculated that shreks dick is 11.53 inches.

This lead to me wondering what Fiona (shreks wife) height was as she must have been ruined pre ogre transformation, based on my research she was 5.10 meaning that pre shrek transformation she was taking ogre dick account for over 19% of her height!
biden is a no from me too dawg faced pony

25c ESPR 1/15/21

Stock plummeted 15% today, but just already has a released drug since March and is growing, just less than expected they think because of less people going to doctors offices since covid. Is scheduled to launch in Europe soon. I was just looking as a day/swing trade since it was a top mover on RH but after looking it up a bit, I feel like it might be a solid monthly/long term play.  I already invested all my grandmas lunch money on it but would love some autistic opinions on it.
It's not tomorrow yet
Jack Ma shitted on Gyna. Now he has to go to reeducation camp and ANT IPO cancelled
The GOP wants like a $500b stimulus with no direct checks to people. If you think that the GOP will race to pass a big stimulus *after* the election you haven't been following.

GOP = small or no stimulus.

DEM = big stimulus.

This isn't complicated. Dems wanted a 3 trillion bill and came down to 2.2 trillion. GOP wants 500b and Mnuchin wants a 1.6t stimulus. Any notion that a Trump/GOP win means a big stimulus or a stimulus before 2021 is a lie people are telling themselves.

The political gamesmanship in play though is the GOP counting on a Dem sweep so they can own the 3 trillion bill so the GOP can run on 'fiscal responsibility' in 2022, just like the 2008/2009 situation. Rinse and repeat.

GOP cause a recession, Dems fix it, GOP points to Dems fixing it as being reckless with money.

If you lost money this week, just know it's not because of MaNiPuLaTiOn. It's because you were wrong. You can't learn unless you can admit that.

Edit: This also includes the last couple months.

Where is the lie?
The hell is going on with BABA?
what are you talking about?
Haha nice funny weed number
I see...

Well if you’re just hoping for a spike where you can sell those for 3 cents, maybe it’ll work out
Big red wave is not feasible. There’s no possibility of Rs retaking the house unless all the polling is much more inaccurate than 2016. I think more than anything, the market wants a clear result and an end to uncertainty.
Already scalped this morning, have reloaded

It’s obvious we’re dumping after the election but I also doubt it because MMs are dicks
I really hope tomorrow we crash so I can buy Nio calls and cheap amazon leaps
Yes.
What app is that?
No, i don't think that's it. High uncertainty leads to high(er) volatility, i know there has been a downturn for awhile no and expect a rebound but why this week of all weeks, anyway we are still too high imo.

If there is uncertainty, why are we up?

Sounds good.  I hope it is working out for you.  I was running the numbers this afternoon and staying mostly long and all in the market, I am up 74% for the year.  

I tried to time/short the market back in 2009.  Every headline kept saying we are nearing the end of the world and the stock market went for a 10+ year run.  I decide fuck that, I am getting on this bandwagon until I am pushed off!

This time was no different.  My recommendation is to pick a direction where the market will be 3 or 6 months from now.  Load up on your favorite instrument (puts, calls, stock, etc.) and just buy more if the market goes against your direction.  If you are right, you will have made tons of money!!!

BTW the market has a higher propensity to go up than it does down.
Still got plenty of time in the month. Hahah
>young chinese go to starbucks to drink frappuccinos.  China starbucks also sell tea and juice teas
yep lol, fucking biggest rally ever!

the dump was last week, the market is always forward looking
Fuck it. BUY CALLS ON NIO. China loves for Biden
My retarded coworkers are talking about how they are wishing they had bought some more guns and think it's going to be dangerous to go out the next few days.

I may be a clown but if I hit. Ima be loaded
Voted today, despite what others tell you the results will kind of be known tonight. FL will report after polls close, if Trump takes FL he’s got a good shot at victory, if he loses FL it’s 100% over
Thank you. I can finally show my wife that atleast one other person thinks like me!
Yes there is.

Why would it tank?

you need to hit the pipe again.

good economy ≠ stonks going up
This is the DD that we desperately need
Only if Trump has a leg to stand on, meaning he probably needs to win PA or Florida clean and try and mess with the results in the other. If one or both give Biden a clear win, it’s over and volatility will collapse.
Well shit. Right behind you.
Spy got some serious retard strength
not a chance, loading up on food costs a tleast 2$. needa invest all i can

Thanks, felt good. Im almost out of my hole and into profit territory  lol
This shit needs to tank. There is no reason for SPY or anything to be this bullish besides trauma clown wants it to tank if he doesn't win like the stupid baby he is.
I can’t believe you guys still don’t understand how memes work.
The only dump coming 🌈🐻 is the shit the MMs take on your puts as they pump us to new all time highs.

If you're in weed stocks prepare to take profits. Weed never even gets a semi for more than a few days. "Decriminalization" really means nothing for the industry this early on

Stupid question, why obviously green?
Don’t be shy TSLA to 500 by Friday
lol damn dude, you should stop trading...
damn so many bears are scared. Saying "dump is coming, dump is coming" to reassure themselves. Bitch ass fools, dump happened last week! and the past 2 months was straight up consolidation/correction.
damn, what is that?
Gamestop on the front page? Calls it is.
especially anyone who bought TSLA in 1929. I bet those guys are all billionaires now
Always using limit order, you’re just one dumbass away from selling everything at market to some guy for 0.01
If the election has been called for Biden and the outcome is clear and Senate is held by Dems, probably green for a bit. Contested results: probably a little red unless there are serious problems (contested ballots, etc.), in which case worse. Probably about the same for Biden win and Republican Senate (slower burn but potentially lasting into 2021).
Roku is doing its best impression of Wil E Coyote falling off a cliff
Nice
These are both interesting, imma dive in👀 thx
Inversed, bought more calls.

I think the actual term is for double digit lead in popular vote. At least that's what 538 said

Pathetic dude
A non-zero non-100% probability of a contested election is priced in. But reality will take us the rest of the way
Yeah man and i have zero plan on when I’m getting out. 29C 11/13 and doubled down 33C 1/15/21. Probably the 29’s EOD/EOW
It's a classic "Imma head out" pattern
🤡😂😅😂🤣
Are we buying roku sub 200??
Lol - $VBR, which I bought right after Trump was inaugurated, is basically at the same price as it was then. Not sure how anything other than stimulus optimism is bullish rn for small caps, but it is kinda interesting that it's managed no gains in 4 years.
First ones free.

Autist WSB trader selling his assets after blowing up his account during the Great Depression - 1929 colourized
Do you guys use limit orders when selling out of a position? I always use one when buying, but when selling I usually just want out ASAP. I know without one I'll probably get filled at a price that's less than I wanted, but if the price is rapidly dropping I'd rather be out for sure at a bad price than stuck in the position as it drops to a worse price.
Lays 5 million at +200 = 15 million dollar payout. 5 mill of that is his own money. Makes 10 million profit. 

Again. Trump is not 3/1 odds and the twitter account is wrong.
Welcome fallen 😤🐂
Are you demanding a recount?
Knows it's retarded but does it anyway.  That's like crayon-up-the-nose retarded.
Best advice on this sub.
10/13 TSLA $495 call or
December $40 VXX call
Do these idiots actually know what landslide victory means? Just winning the election doesn’t make it a landslide victory smh

I certainly wouldn't go to bed without turning positions into spreads.
This is a stupid stat. Wall street is donating to both sides but Trump refuses it.
This country turned into a reality tv show 4 years ago and that’s why the market doesn’t know what the fuck it’s doing. The one constant is jpow and he don’t fuck around. Long the market
if my Wendy's calls print tomorrow I'm buying Baconators for everyone
I’ll never buy an ETF just out of pure spite for r/stocks
Can someone please help me on what will the market do tomorrow?! 

Bigly green sounds like obvious thing, like, too obvious and it seems sentiment all over different trading/investing platforms seems to expect this also. Which is why i keep going/thinking, that perhaps it will be surprised red.
Imagine all the people in the midwest that are gonna buy lordstown trucks cuz they have lord in their name. Bless you jesus.

You could buy yourself such a fast electric scooter with $2,500!
yes, I believe
same.. oh well
Yeah, if you're not betting your whole portfolio on your take then STFU. (Biden for the win, TAN, ICLN, and MJ Nov 20 calls)
Another idea is cash out initial investment of 100k and put it somewhere else (TSLA would move your single security risk to now just single sector risk).  Tax implications are also something to consider.  

None the less, congrats on your gains!!! Can I ask, if you sold your house, where are you staying now? or basically have your monthly overhead expenses increased or decreased from the house sale?

Everyone is expecting a dip so MMs won’t let that happen
Yeah didn't realize what it was. I'll research but not position

This is now akin to what the investing.com forums look like. Forget DD there aren’t even any targets people share. It’s only good to gauge sentiments.

priced in. Trump can only win. President can just decide Joe BIden is a national security Risk and exile him
lol yeah, it’s fake as fuck.
People closing shorts can push price up.
Meaning its a green day.
buy at eod and then sell at open
It's going to be a blowout victory for Biden lol I voted for a 3rd party but I'm just saying. Volatility is going to be absolutely destroyed. Do not long volatility..if you missed the last week you missed your chance.
Made 1.4k today, bought today . Sold at 35.44

18 Not impossible but I just had some leftover and at the time it was the cheapest call I felt ok about. Bought some shares at 13 which isn’t the best but can at least break even by eoy I imagine
If you were a pro, you would of figured out the cost of the original car at time the picture was taken and the percentage loss. Then apply the calculated percentage loss to the current value of a Tesla and updated the note accordingly.

Bears are the doomsday people you see hoarding 10lbs of beans and rice 🍚 delusional I tell you
Trump is not +300 odds
By EOD. Earlier if we limit down.
Calls and puts every two comments. Just like choppy days in the market
I sold my $9 11/6 calls today, can say paper hands but there's just no clue what will happen post election. I'm holding onto my $9 1/15 calls though. I think those will print after the next earnings report and the transition of power.
Lol, electoralism is bullshit. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746
ANT isn't going away and BABA is still the most undervalued major tech company in the world. Easy hold or dip buy. I'm grabbing some january 300s before EOD.
Cool link thanks, odd they don't mention his appearance in that very iconic photo. You should edit the article.

This is going to be another day where the market just slowly bleeds down bouncing off of every support price point it can find.

Fucking. Boring.
Spy honey dicked the bears pretty hard
Am I crazy or did spy touch 330 around 145?
He said China doesn't have systemic financial system risk because they don't even have a financial system, instead the banks operate like a bunch of pawnbrokers and the regulations were out of touch with the real world.
Sell before earnings.

*chuckles* I'm in danger
Whoa...
And spreads. If the election results are clear, we could have an IV crush comparable to earnings.
Bought a 292.5c at 292.5, shit hurts!!
SQQQ calls
Where’s the stimulus step bro? I can’t find it!
Have a plan before you buy -- why are you buying?  What's your max loss?  Max profit?  If you bought "to make money" you'll probably lose it.  If you bought puts because you think tomorrow will be a shit-show, wait until tomorrow.  It sucks losing value instantly but if you do your DD and have a plan, it helps (my SPY puts were down 50+% this AM, recovering for what I hope is printing tomorrow).
I got 3 months of rent on the line right now, qqq puts
Bears and bulls playing magical chairs 🪑
I'm a bit bias since one of those "big techs" is my employer, but I think the politicians are under-estimating the logistics of any significant break-up. I don't think it'll happen aside from some small token-deal to appease the masses.
😂
TSLA options or NIO options safe from IV crush ?

It’s all fun and games until he has a mysterious malady and is never heard from in this world again. I got into calls both weekly and long. Could have sold 30% up now I’m 30% down. Holding. He’s got to give some sort of press release about this with a new timeline for IPO and BABA still own a share of Ant and earnings is coming up.

Best you can do is 1dte. Nothing expires today.
Looks like I'm gonna be wronggggggggggg.

Aphria's market cap is 2.5b not 3.4b, unless this is an estimation for next year. In which case you should be buying weed stocks if it's going to go up 40%.

This is what I’m thinking too
The dip will be bought, and the bears will be taught
Think we bounce from here and close near hod, closed these $336p for $5.10 didn't think 50% is possible https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jmv1ax/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_november_03_2020/gaz6mcd?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3 - grabbed some baba 11/13 $300c

I love this stock...
duh. Have you seen how much SPY contacts are just 1 dollar otm? Theres like a +3 dollar premium on it
I’m expecting the same thing. I’ll definitely be buying more calls of NIO.
Holup
Damn, where you live that they let you have that much product? Decriminalized limit in my state is 1 oz per person.
Everybody in shambles
I get what you mean from past results, but if everyone actually voted things could change significantly. Either way not voting is the most pathetic, unamerican thing you can do
never--mind
> What are their fees like?

Damn bro use Google... The other questions are relevant, but this one is better answered by you. You've only got a handful of brokers to choose from. If you care about fees, look them up yourself.

Does $200 make you feel like a big shot?

Lmao Jack Ma really went off and started talking shit to the Chinese Govt right before his IPO? That's a big dick move right there.

I might get back into BABA with this wild dip. Earnings coming up too
Dude get some beard oil and start combing that shit in. My job makes me clean shave or have a beard no longer then 1.5inches. they are hyper cristal too if you have a curly scraggly sort of beard hair. So I get hella shit for mine when I grow it out. The itch is insane for my and beard oil and conditioning soap helped when I had it. Don't got any brands to recommend cause that is kinda like the shampoo issue. You gotta find what works for your hair and skin. Best wishes though. Beards get MAD RESPECT.
The flush is starting
Yes
This is almost back to where we started the day at. Still down -3.5K. Lmao congrats theta gang.

Could this text **be** any more bold?
Time for 2:00 liftoff

EDIT: Well, they tried. Big volume jumps, but little green candles.
vix rising lol
ACB? That's pretty retarded. ACB is dog shit and has done a reverse split fairly recently. HEXO is about to do a reverse split too. I can see it being a good hedge for American Companies. But there's a good chance I'm more retarded.
Made $200 today. I’m taking interviews
Buy the dip
I did the same thing today. 

NIO 34p 11/6
Exactly. I’m usually buying 3-4 month exp so I have been putting up with it. But it’s hard. Also- like WTF my shit doesn’t refresh usually and I’m always wondering how much I’m loosing; not asking for real time but even a delay would be helpful.
I mean you got me there. I feel like DC could get nuked and the AI headlines would just be like “Tech surges as Anti-Trust lawsuits no longer a concern for investors”
Theta gang doesn’t mind the volatility
Poor bears Lmaoo... about to lose it all
Here comes the dump right on time
And here begins the dump. Close positions now

If that happens I will fucking quit my job eod tomorrow and buy $2000 of weed

Nah I could’ve sold for a slight loss before I got assigned. Just selling covered calls, would’ve rather been in lower but AAPL not bad to be sitting on.
I understand. Wouldn't that be a short term solution to a long-term problem?

A couple of weeks ago, my father in law was telling me how he had been trading stocks based off of advice he was getting from his fucking UT football message board. First- I called him a pussy for not going all in on FD's and then I immediately went cash gang because if that doesn't tell you to pull it all out of the market, I am not sure what else would
So is $X gonna rally hard again if Trump wins?
playing the swings both ways is the way.  Nothing but profit.  It dumps I sell the puts.  It pumps I take profit on the calls.  We ain't trading flat these days.
If you have balls, buy calls!

BABA down 8% is so fucking tantalizing. Too bad I'm a broke bitch.

Curious question from a non american. Why would the expectation of a democrat win rise stocks?
Market makers agreeing to a price and settling large sums privately
In actuality...

&#x200B;

A candidate must receive an [absolute majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_majority) of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, that election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the 12th Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote-winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote-winners as vice president.
Anyone playing HLT earnings? Feel like with a second wave their outlook may be dismal, but don't know if all that is already priced in. Thoughts?
what time poll end?
He's worse for trade.  Protectionist policies are all posturing that hurt yourself as much as, if not vastly more than your opponent.  

US companies have suffered from the Chinese tariff, while China did take a hit but not nearly as bad.  As would have been predicted by anyone who is familiar with global economics post 1700s.  

Baba will probably do just as well with either president.  They have an entire world to trade with.
Mostly stock and April 21 and even some Jan 22. I really didn't think that it would pop off like this until they were able to report holiday numbers. But the fact that's the SI is up to ≈70MM is insane
I say definitely but maybe not a weekly call, maybe a month out or so. Last earnings it sold off for some reason on great numbers and then popped literally two days after.
Don’t care, didn’t ask, Still holding calls
Someone talk me through this play

I feel like a lot of iPhone's are going to be looted tonight and tomorrow.

So if Biden wins, you got Trump who might go scorched-earth in a tantrum in the last 2 months before he leaves.

If Trump wins, he'll have a free for all 4 years with no more re-election to worry about.  And probably will focus more on his policy of Tweets that sends the market on surprise drops and spikes to help line up the pockets of his family.

I wouldn’t trade the weeklies tbh. You can get longer expiry for slightly higher, so if you’re wrong, you won’t be annihilated.
Is there still hope for vix spike?
I feel like I've turned a corner as a trader maybe it's just dumb luck but I'm a million times better at entry points and exits then I was 6 months ago.

**SELL**
Loss money on spy hedge today because of paper hands.  Held for only 20 minutes because market went straight up.  Now it’s back down. I’m pissed!  How do you harden these hands?
Trump _says_ he's mean.  But in reality he's a total pushover.  Biden _acts_ nice, but in reality he works with allies to pressure adversaries.  

It's like the guy who talks shit and then is a pussy when its time to put up, vs the guy who walks softly but carries a big stick.
lol spy IV is just stupid today. easily 2-3x normal price on a tuesday
And now that it has been fulfilled...
Turn around Tuessssdaaaayyy
Thanks homie
I think if it’s a clear winner the markets will rally.
Boobs I think
 why
GME is a timebomb, sell
What happens if it’s 269-269 tonight?
Nevermind youre right. im thinking with FOMO again.
You know it. More stable
Correct. Call 1-800-Dumbass to collect your prize
SPY is getting weak.
People are waiting to buy options. The leaps are coming. Florida will be the tipping point.
What if Biden abolishes the stock market? 

😳🕶🤏🏻
pretty lame satire then tbh
where can i see short borrow rates for stocks in ibkr? like for GME?

i have 70 GME shares, can i lend them or is my broker doing it automatically?
Not a secret. A strong move up followed by a pull back to around the 50% point is typically a bullish sign. It bounced right off that point. Still needs to break trend though which is the important part and it hasn't done yet so can still drop more.
Seriously tho why is Apple so weak ?
you say wendys too like wendys isn't food haha
As far as options is concerned I’m not too sure and would be weary in these crazy times though I do believe there will be a run up to earnings. I’m holding 1300 shares so I’m just chillin and waiting for the landing
Damnit got in calls and left puts too early

Major support at $50 because I have an order for 10 shares at $50
Yeah, I know that's why it went up yesterday and today. I'm sure it'll keep climbing especially closer to NIO Day but I'm thinking my premium might drop over the next few days so I could sell now and get in again at a cheaper price.
Funko Pop earnings and Rocket earnings are the move
Dump them tits girl!

I think if they sort out the ANY ipo on the near term and explain what happened it could get back up to highs rather quickly, also I think earnings are next week.

Lol same
Serious and non-political question. To me the past two green days seem to be anticipating a strong Biden and Democratic win. If we get a pretty clear picture of the results and they are as expected before open tomorrow are we thinking another big green day or a little drawback?? I'm trying to decide if I should sell some calls I'm up on today or tomorrow.
Bought some $25 jan 2023 rkt calls, I'll see you all in 3 years 🙏
By placing sell orders.
Bought BABA 11/20 300c with a healthy 10.05 average 🤡
it would still be up to the governors i believe

Nice never cash out with a loss always redepo and you will hit it sooner or later
Not at all brother.


Fully Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) was $0.69, compared with $(0.29) in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.51, or up 738 percent, compared with $(0.08) in the prior-year quarter.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was positive $77 million, compared with a use of cash of $(36) million in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow generation was positive $73 million, compared with a use of cash of $(45) million in the prior-year quarter.

I got blown up by MGI. Always hedge distressed companies because bullshit abounds
Just might be autistic enough to work
Yeah very true. I think, and this is just my opinion, that the most interesting scenario will be an early declaration of victory from Trump if the earliest reporting states are all Republican.
They're a long term pick for me.
Just like seal team six, drill team six moves stealthily and you’ll never know when they hit you.

All the more reason I keep my tin foil hat on at all times.
Man, once this elections bullshit is over, Nov. is going to be rocket fuel.  Moderna AND Pfizer are both expected to report.  If the data are good, the market is going to blow its load.
is it me or are options not moving as fast in terms of buying and selling
Y’all ever seen a NIO car? Shits ugly af, especially compared to a Tesla. Not saying the stock won’t keep going up, it’s just ugly
Depends on time frame my man
This is just in response to all the retards frothing at the mouth that "we are about to dump"

Like $3 drop on the SPY and they are celebrating going from -98% to -96%
-3% EOD
Idk man I am in the pool for some of these surveys. I never answer that I would pay cash because that's stupid. I put every expense on a card and pay it off before due. I always put this in the review at the end, they never ask "do you have enough cash to cover a $400 expense?" They ask "how would you cover a $400 expense?" I could easily be counted as a borrower under the wrong methodology, even though I could cough up $400 liquid no problem. Statistics based on flawed survey questions are 2 layers of misleading.
Lol we are?!?!

SPY in the 330s is bear territory??? Dont be a retard
Big stimmy is being priced in along with blue wave
Smart money is getting in now
This is the ground floor
So do I buy?
It can never hold its gains. Its been consolidating here for months. Earnings is going to bring it over $30 where it will stay.
Your mom was crazy overpriced
You underestimate our ability to buy the top and sell the dip on options only.

But yeah anyone who bought shares is sitting pretty happy.
Foreshadowing
They're trying to scare us away from the profits
LOL triggered, it's not 2016 anymore trumpy
Definitely, but not necessarily today. I'm expecting an earnings beat as a lot of the stuff sold on Amazon is repurposed from Alibaba and Amazon had good earnings again. Plus as soon as the Ant IPO gets approved and goes through it will pop.
Haha... My same thought
I use vanguard for my Roth to trade options and your not missing anything. Shit sucks. It’s like 1992 on dial up.
just FOMO’d the shit out of Nio 🤡
I’m convinced it’s being pushed down today by MMs. I noticed when we were still climbing mid-day that vix wasn’t going any farther down and TLT started climbing a little (scared investors). Also not sure if it’s much of an indicator but I’ve noticed the ETF TAN has been down every day on the day before a drop, like people are already taking their money out there because they already know. Idk, I’m no wizard, but I feel safe in my vix calls.
ding ding ding
God this makes me want to go in on 0dte puts if it stays here

What the markets value above all is stability and based on some reading the markets seems to be anticipating a Biden and Democratic win in general, and therefore a more stable period upcoming.
Correct
AMZN is a steel under 3000 and you missed that Bears. Lmao.
The issue with that is all the states that are pretty much a lock for either candidate are the ones you'll find out first about. The battleground states won't be able to report until late tonight at best, and a few days from now at worst.

The dollar vallue doesnt make sense for 600k call options unless they all expire within the next few weeks, it’s like ~ $4 a contract w that math adding up to 2.6 mil

This has gotta be for 6k contracts, probably longer dated and not super OTM
Its all an allusion. I’m thinking it’ll dump in AH bigly

bro we in bear market territory, buy long dated puts and relax. if you play weeklys you are asking for trouble

Owww, dddaaaannng, that hurts
I mean it's just as helpful as someone complaining about movement relative to earnings performance. 

That one little number barely means shit during the earnings report. The market already has a good idea what that earnings number is. It's all about future guidance and what orange man tweets.

Nah that just brings them over here too
We aren’t going to have the results today unless there is a landslide victory. That doesn’t seem likely. Sc is already projecting late results, others may follow.
10 labor hours so about $120 bucks wow such big prize
Just my two cents here - I think the market is pricing in a democratic sweep and decisive victory, therefore erasing Trumps path to contest the election and the ensuing chaos that would create. Just looking at Trumps map to victory there is no realistic scenario where he wins outright tonight. In trumps bullish election scenario he does well in many swing states like Pennsylvania and declares victory before mail in ballots are counted. As mail in ballots trickle in over the next week this will most likely be taken to the Supreme Court and will create the prolonged confusion that the market is afraid of.

which ones better uvxy or vxx for options?
the best part is this retard didnt even account for inflation LMAO
With enough volatility, small dumps can cause large dumps

Biden is now a 2 to 1 favorite, 67% chance of winning.  
I think Trump was +700-ish at the beginning of the day for last election.

You'd think if everyone was betting on Biden, they'd make the odds better for Trump in order to try and balance out the wagers.
Big money buys in when you least expected.
Any hope BABA will recover to 303?

Why would any buying happen today. Does that market feel that it outcome doesn't matter? Either way no stimmy, so I don't see why the markets popped.
Bears praying for even the smallest of dumps right now.

Keep praying, there must be some investors that have waited till the day of a highly volatile presidential election, after weeks of red, to sell their large positions.
Does it?  Or does inflation drive up the cost of living to the point that labor wants more pay, but can't get it because someone overseas is willing to work without modern labor protections for a fraction of the pay?

I don’t think anyone has any idea who’s going to win
Not today, but back then it wasn't possible for most countries to HAVE an auto industry because of how hard it would have been to coordinate the supply chain.  

But all of the money and material made to produce that car stayed inside the country which means that much more American labor went into that car than is true today.  It wasn't really a qualifying statement for anything other than that car represented more opportunity for labor in this country than an American "made" car does today.

> There's a regulatory draft that requires small business lenders like Ant to warehouse 30% of the loans they originate vs the 2% that they currently have on balance sheet.

For those who've been investing for a while, is there a common pattern for how the market behaves around election time?
If there wasn't so much uncertainty surrounding the election, I would say that this is one of the days where you buy at close and sell at open.
I'm aware. But some styles transcend time. Well-fitting, simple clothes will always look good. If this guy wore this today, people would appreciate the suit. Hence this post.
Markets are forward looking and literally everyone on both sides of the isle is expecting stimulus to happen (because it is happening). Market pumping hard yesterday and today suggests people are expecting an uncontested election which likely is not going to happen. First one is neutral second one bearish.
Poots?!

Earnings plays are terrible rn. 6 out of 7 big tech earnings tanked the stock. GOOG was the only one that came out green.
It does run up to events tho. Exactly 1 day before the event it'll run up, and if ur not sure, the EU market trades 7 hours earlier than that, if theres a green candle, its gonna run up hard. Just please make sure to sell BEFORE the day of the event, because ppl will wanna take profits on the event day but there wont be much buyers, and down it goes. Lol. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Anyone know why SEDG is just getting slaughtered? Their earnings weren’t great but not bad enough to lose 24%, especially when a Biden W could be huge for solar.
March
In 2008 we were up 3% on the election day and down -6% the next day. Today reminds me of that.

That's what my USO calls are.
Send it my way. Then I'll double it and get it back to you. Trust me.

What happened to CRSR hitting $32? my 11/20 $25 C is just getting eating away by theta. Wait till earnings, or just count my losses?

2018 S FSD in Midnight Silver. May the tendie train continue.
I can't help you here
Miami dade hasn't released their numbers yet, they are in a diff system that hadn't updated counts yet. A spoiler is it is way closer than 2016, maybe even going red.
My point exactly
You got most of it, Now ask yourself this, why 17days out, would there be "priced in" or  "bets"s like you are seeing?

CRSR why can’t you just hold a pump😭
That's what I just told your mom
Not worried SEDG gonna bleed down further after negative guidance for the next quarter?
If he taps Buying Power he can add more USD tokens.
Fucking cresco labs. Get on your phones and actually open up a recreational menu in Illinois New York or michigan. More than 70% of the menu is cresco. They don’t sell garbage tinctures or other trash that just drags down the bottom line. They sell bud wax some edibles and cartridges of wax. They’re the only company I’ve bought from since illinois legalized because their stuff is hands down the best. It’s about the product, their company history can be sparkling but if their weed is shit they’re going to do shit. I’m already up 30% since buying in September, hop on the train.

Half of a brain.
WEED and PDD (all time high today)
Contrary to popular belief, I do not believe my vote matters
Ngl I was strongly considering that one. Got the Amex now so I can meet the minimum spend and get the bonus points, then when I travel in the summer I’ll get the CSR since Amex isn’t accepted most places overseas, and get the bonus points on that one.
It has been my bread and butter on my fun account. I love it.
Lol all these voting tracker things are misinfo because they all disagree. I just read one had Miami-Dade way ahead 🥭, another has biden way ahead they cant both be right or am i just dumb
 free food if u vote!!! wendys too https://www.newstimes.com/food/slideshow/Election-getting-you-down-211978.php?src=nthpcp
And they'd be right. Most people's votes are meaningless because of the electoral college.
"one"  lololololololololol
If you had 17k like me, how would you double it before next week ?
Any thoughts on NIO boys? I am still holding on one call, but I am not sure what will happen after tonight.

I think tmr might not drop just to kill the last batch of 0dte spy puts and let the bulls load calls. The drill might come Thursday or Friday when bulls are smiling (I’m a bull🙃)

NIO nice today. Short squeeze ahead?
In my opinion, either Trump or Biden will win

Edit: oops forgot about Ye
thank you I'm kinda retarded
Many analysts see a huge upside potential in a Biden win within the next year or so, but as soon as higher taxes get implemented we get a slow drip down for the remainder years. I mean analysts know nothing like us so take it as you want it.

Eventually they’ll add that. Hell they’ll even start doing Roth’s and shit too in a few years
Well than the market is selling off coz you're not getting both of those things
Stimulus is coming either way and imo that’s priced in. Market is pumping in anticipation of an uncontested Biden win which is far from guaranteed. Dangerous to be long rn.
Full retard.

allstate's exposure to business umbrella insurance ain't shit.  same with commercial property insurance.  i assume.  idk, sir this is a wendys

Based on the exit polls it looks like Biden or trump might win tonight. 


If either of these two clowns win, the market is gonna open tomorrow.
Other than the second worst recession in US history?
Work WiFi blowing straight Ass right now gawd damn
spy, you better march back up those stairs and clean that room
You’d lose your money.
this man fucks.
What does that have to do with uncertainty? The bubble popped in March and was then reinflated by Trump and co. Fat loans to companies through the Fed and treasury. Unwavering support of big fiscal stimulus. 

Biden winning may lead to a short-term rally, but the eviction wave poses a big systematic risk and will make any rally short-lived (I’m assuming the evictions will happen as property owners keeping squatters would be far more costly). Stimulus in 2021 will be too late as defaults will follow shortly after. JPOW can limit the damage by tying over a few owners, but some will be ineligible for aid due to existing leverage, so defaults will be inevitable by December. 


If Trump wins, we’ll get a stimulus sooner and that risk won’t be realized. Trump won’t pass a stimulus if he loses too.

That’s fine. You have that freedom. You do you playa.

Yep, I’m in the same boat. If Biden is the winner, I’m loading myself to the tits on puts, if trump wins, im probably just going to pull out of the market for a bit anyways just to see if the uptrend continues and then get back in

You bet $100 and get $188 

Bets go off with the presumption you bet $100.
Things that are priced in:
- Biden winning uncontested 
- More stimulus coming in the next 2-3 months 

There will be no additional pump from either of these events and a major sell off if either doesn’t happen.
I hope we get 2 presidents so we get 2 stimuluses just like 2 Christmas after my parents got divorced

I'm not too sure any such amount exists in China. Even Chinese billionaires [have gone missing after openly criticizing the party](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/asia/china-ren-zhiqiang.html). Plus the fact of the matter is that the Chinese party does not allow businesses to grow and any significant wealth to be accumulated without allegiance to the party. Part of that allegiance involves engaging in corruption which is then used as blackmail against you should you fall out of line.

I feel like JKS has to moon with a Biden win, but I'm also down 95% on 11/20 100c's so I'm just a little biased.
I am assuming we are no more skilled/lucky than the average, which seems a fair assumption.
VXX puts for me, just a few.

Making money is so easy,buy Spy calls at open,sell it afternoon,buy puts ,sell it at close.
Did the same thing. Sold at first spike and bought 37p 11/6.  Thinking there will be a sell off, then load up on more calls.
And they’re all voting Trump now, wild
Load up on poots kids!
Anchor women decided to wear extra makeup today, calls on makeup.
SPY calls eod
Man I wanted to buy more today but I am waayyy over leveraged in my margin account.  Still holding shares from under 5 bucks though. It is a Lambo or zero on this one. Not selling.

You should vote for nothing else that your single vote in your local elections does matter, and a lot of your local policy that plays out WILL affect you.
entire market rose on a short squeeze, lmao.
Wow, I want what your having.
Position sizing for the win. Tiny position with BABA calls for Ant and earnings. All gone...don't even care. BABA got what it deserved.
I dont need this kind of negativity in my life.
Damnit. Do you have a link to where I can make my $5 mil bet?
Does it ever not dump after being up around 3-4%?
Just leave the $62k to ride and put your initial money into other things so you don't get wrecked. Concentration isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but 100% in one very volatile stock is a pretty bad idea. People think stop losses will save them but forget that the biggest moves are always *between* days in the market so that stop loss could easily cause you to sell at the bottom because the initial move after bad news is usually overblown. 

If you don't want to sell at least pick a price target and sell covered calls, with your shares you could sell \~68 $45 calls for Jan 21 for a total of \~ $22,000, if it hits $45 you'll get assigned and leave with a \~$328,000. Price goes up or sideways and doesn't hit $45, then you get to keep the $22k and your shares. Even if NIO went to 0, you still have $22k, and if it dips down but you think it will come back, you can just buy back the calls for a profit.
Genius

Of course after I sold covered calls on PLUG yesterday
My VXX calls ate a bit of shit. Still gonna hold til EOD. Maybe sell my current ones off and buy a few lottos on far OTM ones.
Literally gambling on SPY with some OTM call credit spreads that expire tomorrow.

It's a well studied effect of lead. It leads to a lower iq, more crime, and a bunch of other stuff. Look into it it's actually a pretty crazy story of how it affected a whole generation of kids.
Oil and health insurance insurance companies are not betting on Biden today
I hope not.....
Probably but even that won’t save me since all my calls are $130 or more. It’ll pump a bit before then dump on the day of the event like it always does.

Srsly tho: how can she slap?
I’ve never voted because on an individual level, it makes zero difference. If a candidate or measure ever loses by one vote then sure, I’ll say it’s my fault. But that never happens so my vote will never change anything
It looks like the market believes there is a clear winner. Doesn't matter who, they like stability
it's not that low of volume.
Nope. It doesn't. But, that's what I've seen happening over last 6 months during major stress periods.
Yessss
I get like 10 a day it’s retarded
my spxs calls would like that
I am thinking put credit spreads as an option too , seems that they dont drop too much outside of events.
Plug up 10% fslr down 4%..... market is retarded
Safe to say most of us. Battery Day did some damage.
336 falling in 3... 2... 1...
Hopefully if donnie wins he makes amends with China so my Nov 13 Baba calls are saved
Oh so def
Is there a link to that video ?

sit on your hands and trade tomorrow or wait til at least 3 EST

Everything is up but PTON, oh how the turns have tabled
Looking at today low volume pump it shows how stocks naturally want to go up as the majority of the big money is on the sidelines awaiting election outcome

I somewhat agree.  It's definitely a competitor but it's up 2000%.   I just don't know why people think 4000% is a reasonable thing.  People want tesla to go to $1000.  It was 80 bucks 12 months ago.

> There's not much point in me laying out a case for us to argue, because you're already starting from the supposition that it's debunked.

That's the whole point of convincing me which is to get me to change positions.

> You might be better off steel-manning the case for Austrian economics and then saying why it fails.

Well shit why didn't you ask? That's fucking easy as pie to do. 

Over the last fifty years, economists have settled on some very broad areas of consensus. The first is, as famous libertarian monetary economist Milton Friedman wrote, "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon". When the supply of money outstrips the demand, prices rise. And this is by no means limited to fiat currencies; see the great Spanish inflation of the 16th & 17th centuries, thanks to the steady influx of gold from the New World. Or check out the price of basic commodities in mining towns during the Gold Rush, when all anyone had was gold.

The second is that a little bit of inflation is okay--possibly even beneficial, since it helps the economy to overcome the problem of sticky wages when the relative value of labour has fallen. But a lot of inflation is very, very bad. Exhibit A is Zimbabwe; Exhibits B-∞ are every other economy that has had inflation near or above the double-digit mark; the higher the inflation, the worse the economy did. The feeling that the currency will experience an unpredictable amount of inflation dampens the willingness of the citizens to save and invest, which is why so many third-world loans are denominated in dollars.

The third is that deflation is also bad, and at the lower percentage values, often even worse than inflation. This surprises/offends/meets with the frank disbelief of many "sound money" types, who think that, barring local shortage, in an ideal world everything ought to cost the same or less than it did when Grandpa was a boy. (These sorts of opinions are cemented further by the fact that Grandpa, who is often the source of them, is usually living on a fixed income, and therefore feels that he would make out better in a deflationary economy.) The problem is, deflation does rather devastating things to anyone who has debt, since they now have to repay what they borrowed in more expensive dollars. Deflation means that, thanks to the abovementioned sticky wages, the economy has to deal with demand shocks by lowering output. Deflation can result in what's known as a liquidity trap, a concept pioneered by liberal economist John Maynard Keynes and best elucidated by liberal economist Paul Krugman back before he left economics writing to focus on his hatred of George W. Bush. Deflation is what made the Great Depression so memorable. Deflation is so bad that almost everyone agrees that moderate inflation, in the range of 1-2%, is better than risking even a small amount of deflation.
If the presidency isn’t announced tonight the market will bleed slowly and than tank

I did that with AMD and TSM, but then after a long time of basing around 50-60 they both just took off and ate my covered calls.
I don't know, at this point, might as well just wait until tomorrow. Anything can happen.

I trade on an if/then basis. I would buy puts if SPY gets to 345 but that doesn't mean I'll buy calls expecting it to get to 345 because I don't know if it will or not.

For example, my plan was to buy calls if SPY drops to 323 which it did last week but I didn't buy puts when it was in the 330s because I didn't know if it would drop to 323 or not but once it did, I knew there was a high chance it would bounce. Unfortunately, I sold way too early, it's the scalper in me. 

I did the same when I bought puts at around 350, sold too early.
Ehh ma is worth tens of billions if the ccp gives him some ridiculous terms he can tell them to fuck off that’s why I’m nervous

I would love to see where you saw Trump turnout was historically high because I have not seen or heard that anywhere. 

I do agree the methodology in '16 did not take in the white vote in regards to college educated and not. Most of the respected ones have now fixed that issue in their polling. Trump in '20 has strengthened his core base in regard to fandom (cultish if you ask me) but that makes his opposition hate him more and alienate the moderate Republicans and Independents.

Trump just pumped Johnson and Johnson and moderna
We have to hear about media bias for 4 years and then they give us a source literally called **joeisdone** and think the data is not biased. Your source does not even try to hide its bias.
What’s scary is people are saying a trump win is priced in lol. Do we go down if either win?
Yes, but some people would also say I’m retarded so take that with a grain of salt.
Said another way, VIX starting to get a boner.
Civil war is priced in
Wow! CNBC: Moderate Democrats pushing for standalone bills on Unemployment and PPP

BULLISH AF!
good luck
Why would you think airlines would go up when worldwide lockdowns are happening again and Covid cases are at all time highs.
Chinese government flexing their muscle. People remembered that China could delist BABA from foreign markets at will. BABA shares have a real possibility of becoming worthless.

Well...
Thanks man - that was helpful. I just went ahead and sold the shares around 207 since that’s well above my breakeven when considering the premium. I just wasn’t sure if I was going to make a profit if I sold now, or if I was still breakeven / negative. Your explanation helped!

CYA LATER NIO
Beware of the cursed BABA YAGA
Ever have a sore dick from pounding it one too many times :/
I have a NIO $35C 1/15/21 that's up 70%. Would now be a good time to sell and buy back in at a cheaper premium or should I just hold until closer to the NIO event in January?
delusional
No
The way things should always be.
Kind of like voting Rep in Cali or Dem in Texas is the most pointless way to waste time but seen as a civic responsibility
I would guess MMs believe blue wave - pumping on massive stimmy, yet oil is selling off
in the future every stock is worth thousands of dollars a share and money is meaningless
Bro theres dozens of cards out there with 0% APR for 16 months!!
it already tanked last week
I'm purely guessing ... The price rarely goes below it's 14 day MA. Right now it's around $29.15ish but MA will go up with today's pump. I'm likely getting back in if it hits 31ish but I'll always check the charts etc first and market conditions.

Shares, leaps, otm w about a month to exp are good plays IMHO. I'd keep an eye out for ER.. I wouldn't sell ccs on them though for now if you eventually buy shares.
Kiss me by my zoom puts babey

A blue wave is the only thing that would explain this circus market
Can spy dump already?
If it's so easy why dont you just open a margin account and do it instead of trolling? Even hedge funds, institutions, and prop trading firms would kill for 3 percent gain per day that you're describing.
Same. It should bounce back though.

Real key issue:

-Jack Ma criticized the gouvernment and system too hard for once and CCP decided to send a warning

Chinese companies work because the CCP allows it. They can randomly pump 10% and lose 10% according to the whims of the communist party. Nobody here should forget that.
I would fucking kill myself because I don’t have the patience to wait that shit out and I would definitely lose my whole account

This is textbook MM manipulation or a bounce from last week. We are still considerably lower than last weeks numbers

God I hope so
I really wonder what MM are planning. Are they that confident there will not be a contested election? But like MM fashion they have a need like hunger to fucker over retail.
No that’s a liberal talking point.
>  they got delisted in the US though.

you're expecting WSB people to know what that means.
Go over to politics bro. Nobody wants to hear this shit.
Oh ffs Najerian he’s a fucking monkey for sure. He called usual options for ups last week at 175, big boys ran it up day before cashed in and it dumped to 158 the next day.

I agree that the election will be a positive catalyst but I do not think it will be cleanly decided by tomorrow and the risk of civil unrest is too high.

GYNA!!! LOL u know its bad when china thinks the books arent right.
Yessir. Depends on your entry point (did you fomo on Wednesday at the top?) but we will get another spike this week. 

I would not hold past this week unless we get other bad news.
>	Most of the raw materials were sourced domestically too 

Is your argument here that sourcing raw materials domestically makes something cheaper? Maybe I’m misinterpreting your comment, but isn’t the entire point of importing raw materials in the modern day is because it’s cheaper? 

It certainly wouldn’t have been cheaper to import back in the 20s, but is that even relevant given that importing materials like that was almost universally cost prohibitive?

If you can stomach people who disagree with you vehemently. But you should be able to. Freedom of speech is amazing, and if your ideas are really the best, then they should stand up to criticism and over time should become more refined
Plan was to hold my nio calls till week of expiration. But since the market was open later cuz of fall back I decided to grab my profit.  

Plan was to hold and exercise if they where way above the strike.
I’m liking the way things are holding. 
Haven’t seen this in a while. Seems serious.

Perpendicular means they are like X and Y axes. Movement in X direction doesn't have any influence on Y and vice versa. Knowing value of X can't help you with value of Y. 

If they are parallel then moving along one, either positive or negative, also impacts the other with some correlation. Knowing value of one tells you *something* about the value of the other.

There's no attack there, it's simple motivation. If they accept that printing money is bad, and admitted that to the public, they'd have to stop printing and explain to people why they've continued to steal from the poor and middle class. 

There's not much point in me laying out a case for us to argue, because you're already starting from the supposition that it's debunked. You might be better off steel-manning the case for Austrian economics and then saying why it fails. 

You make the vague statement that it's been discredited, and Austrians 
 see the business cycle at work every time the Fed pumps more cash into the system, inflating the bubble, and then acting surprised when it pops while they start printing even more.

Inflation as measured by the US govt is low, but they also keep changing the definition, don't they? We're also helped by the benefits we'd typically expect from a free market - products becoming cheaper to manufacture over time as manufacturing becomes more efficient. Ideally, we'd see this as continued deflation in prices, not inflation, with a stable currency. With a gold standard, your purchasing power would increase, and we'd see less speculation. It would likely make WSB much less interesting, but it would be better for the working class and encourage saving.
I didn't know Biden was going to tax me so much until 50 Cent said so.  Good lookin out fiddy
Oh he is most likely full or shit. Or just dumb as fuck and doesn’t know how vaccine trials work. But I assume it’s the former.

Baba better moon tm
SPX still has an expected move of $94.5 ($9.5 for SPY) for tomorrow's expiration. That's still 3% up or down from where we're at already! 
There's millions of dollars of hedges for $3,200 and below. I'm by no means saying that's happening, there's also millions on the call side too, but there's real cold hard cash being used to give substance to the threat of volatility, regardless of what we've already seen yesterday and so far today.
Holy fucking shit baba where u going
Bad day for bears
So many combinations to win

I'm still at around 31.  Was going to lower to around 24 but for some reason figured it would go lower than 18 and got lazy.  I'm apparently playing the long game.. the very long game.
market is up last two days because they see such a big biden landslide victory that trump won't be able to gin up any support or cause fo a loud-mouthed challenge
jack ma opened his fat mouth and criticized gyna. now ant ipo on hold, or off the table
What do you expect from FIT?  Isn't the merger price set at $7 per share?
I’m sure they are skewering him and agree he should have kept his mouth shut about the financial system, funny how these moguls can be their own worst enemy sometimes.  I do think it will be back on at some point, simply too much money at stake to keep it down forever, but yeah it could be months away now as they do damage control and return institutional investments.  It’s a huge blow for sure.
Why?
VXX ya cunt stop being gay, this shits broken
If spy drops 10 dollars, I would not be surprised, since they don’t let either side win

Oh god, right in the puts.
I think you’re on the right track.  I’m just gonna continue holding my shares and selling covered calls, maybe selling some naked puts on some stuff I would mind picking up on sale.
Why buy the afternoon before the election? Indices up 2% on the day seems like a very good indicator that the election is a strong upside catalyst. If you're buying, waiting until tomorrow could be a big missed opportunity.
short squeeze is over. It's all down from here.

What virus ?
Yeah I get stoned and before I know it I’m blasting music punching that thing full force lmao
Ouch, fucking Solarwedgie more like.
Vote Orange
the what?
so if what you say is true " there’s a 95% chance we have a contested election or Biden wins" then why would the market react to that? dont you think they have access to the same polling data you do and have traded accordingly for weeks now?
What do you mean?
it depends on brokerage. for instance, if i sell a CSP on MSFT at 207.50 strike for 3.00 premium, when I get assigned, it shows that I actually bought at 204.50 (it rolls the premium into cost basis). So, if your purchase price for MSFT shows your actual strike price of the put (207.50), then that $300 premium just went into your account (as cash proceeds) but not counted as a P&L because it's not tied to the underlying performance.

make sense? basically, if you now sell MSFT at 204.50, you've broken even (if you include proceeds from the premium). what you *should* do is now sell a CC a couple strikes above where MSFT is.

good luck have fun
I don’t think they can tell him until the trails are completely done.
baba calls
Waiting for all the bravado to wear off around 1500ET and people start shitting their pants about "what if..." scenarios so my SPY puts print.  I have confidence.

Of course not. I simply replied that’s a political betting site. There are thousands of possible bets on there. $850 is simply
The limit for each contract. For Trump
Or Biden winning alone there are hundreds of possible bets. I have $13,000 bet today
Why the pump this morning is the better question.
i mean shares but yeah true
Oh yeah
think my 11/6 vxx and uvxy calls are good?

Let’s just hope this isn’t another Luckin Coffee, then that stop loss won’t do shit
Youre missing the big picture. 300,000 plus production line coming and now Chinese gov backing. The stocks going to 100 bucks.
This
lol ath? tmr
Borrow on a credit card to gamble?

Fuck. You're. Dumb.
My last roommate lied to me all the time. I finally up and divorced her ass.
Re-shorted at ES 3365.
What headlines do we expect to see explaining this rally
What price are you going/which calls
I have to admit I am struggling with this last season of Billions too
Trump acting like an adult.  Hmm.
As a WFC shareholder I feel really bad for whomever bought 20,000 24.5 11/20 calls.

You poor dumb bastard.
I was already here
Who is the market expecting to win
Succession obviously
Lmao, I think we would’ve know by now.
I bought calls yesterday morning.  :D I'm a happy man.  Tho... do i get out now or wait till trump tanks the market with his legal case for voter suppression?
Facts
Oooh how do I invest in pre market coke companies. 

Does anyone know a cartel member who will sell me shares?
Fucking tell me about it
Hmm.. DOW up 1,300 points in less than 48 hrs.. seems like a good time for calls? You tell me
Your absolutely right, I’ve been revenge trading off emotion and keep losing everything I put in, I need to chill and relax and only make good trades when I see a time to enter such as if it goes to 350 or if it tanks right now there isn’t much to play
On the chance that the winner is obvious and can’t reasonably be disputed, get ready to moon. Removing uncertainty is always good.
BABA 290c seems potentially lucrative  on the 01/15 losing 40% today. A bit pricey for me but would that be a smart play?
Hell yeah, ever heard of the liteboxer? If you love the bike when stoned you’ll love this extra https://www.instagram.com/p/CEzbXJTgkTF/?igshid=1m1e6aqqhzln8
Alright listen up autists. I'm going to tell you exactly how these next few days are gonna go (and yes they conveniently match with my positions). Biden landslide victory announced tonight. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt all disappear. Huge green to end the week particularly weed stocks which will shoot to the moon (think 20%+ weekly gain considering weed will soon be decriminalized and possibly legalized). VIX and VXX will be dead, sorry homies who are holding
always ask myself, why I hedge... and when I don't it fucking dumps... Hedges are such a waste of money
She's on a winning streak.

How could she lose, right?
fuck you
Yeah I’ve been waiting for the pullback since $30, but it just keeps going up. Think it’ll ever go below $30 again? I wanted to buy shares and hold. Maybe leaps. Nothing risky because I think the upside for long term is huge
[removed]
Uncertainty only is good for wallstreetbetters, not the rest of the market. Sorry dude.

Also Bloomberg would have endorsed the mango not Biden then.
Natural selection lol
Just you wait my guy.
I wanna buy puts at the top of the pump but last time a pump took us to $350 😳
The silence before the storm.
it’s mybookie.ag now smh

Lmao

FUBO mooning.
PLAY is mooning so this has to be some stimulus hype on a blue wave. Either way nah

I know someone who is part of one of the trials. But he doesn’t know if he got the vaccine or a placebo.
FUCK YA DUDE! Nice! :)
Calling him out for going to parties? Are you his mom lmao
[deleted]
Seeing Selena Gomez wet hair telling people to vote, ran to the closest ballot box to finalize my vote
Not feeling this last season of Billions. Never got into succession.
I think he’s trying to say this would be a good time to buy a dip
Spy head and shoulders
Who said anything about contested election? Every election, SPY takes a dip. Just trying my luck this time.
Trump r fuk
See you should have shorted instead of going long.
Lmao true
My exes are shortish, but I need to grow if I want to date this new breed of AMZNs
VXX you cunt whore
f*cking bullish
Yes
no idea, my hedges didn't even bleed that much... lol my longs positions are green :D
It’s alright. When I looked up the date i realized it was to win $100. So doesn’t really matter. I don’t want trump to win anything anyways. I should just go dump my balance on other book on Biden since everyone seems to think Biden a lock
Lol, any trade made today is degenerate
[deleted]
286 usd just seems so cheap for BABA coming into christmas times....
giphy was bought for $400mm. . .insane
I bought the dip!
Make him do a pee on a stick pregnancy test, but tell him it’s a COVID antibody test
the polling places are empty. 80% already voted.. maybe there will be some more traffic in the evening, but by then it will be prime time coverage in the studio. And there isn't anyone trying to scare voters away, that's just made up crap.
AAPL $115 C for Nov 13?
Play underlying shares man, buying options have so much against you. Theta, IV, all other factors it’s not worth it. I’ve made more money trading underlying shares than options
Thanks bro. Up %30 now.

BREAKING:

NATION'S GIRLFRIENDS UNVEIL NEW ECONOMIC PLAN - 'LET'S MOVE IN TOGETHER'

SAID TO SAVE NATION $220B/YR IF BOYFRIENDS SIMPLY AGREED TO MOVE IN WITH THEM
IWM puts?
I remember the time where sentiment on this company is "NIO sucks" or something like that.
It's not too late. I'm waiting to get back in. It usually pulls back after a run up. ER is 11/17 so that factors in too but I'm keeping my eye out for a drop. If not there's other EV stocks to play 👍👍
So you needed to come to social media to tell us that? haha
[deleted]
You see that volume? 93% was me, and I bought one contract for my cat.
[removed]
Calls on sedg? 25% drop today and smart energy sector. Biden wins, it jumps. Thoughts?
What if Trump patiently waits like an adult, and then he wins. There you go, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ r fuk!
If ya’ll still holding calls after this morning ya’ll wild
Nah it’s humorous
Why not?
I thought you left? No one gives a shit bro
Is the volume on that dildo fr lol 750k?
thanks for the condescension shill. People like you will ensure I never vote on your side
What's the time frame outlook for regulatory response for Ant?  Can the issues be addressed within the next month or two?
Anything under $300 is an easy buy
If I were you I would hold, I am looking at more downside to come. But sell around SPY 310-305 if it gets there.
Sell the news. Always
Keep up the grind my man, be disciplined
My bad for buying the baba dip
Now is a good time to get in. Longs are cheap af. I should know, I’m down 80% on some of them lmao
Now how is it looking?? Excited for you! Hopefully you get a good gain! :)
If it breaks 270 I'm in
See Elon's tweet on Aug 4 - I wouldn't be so sure
Polling showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide. You'd be a fool to trust the polls. And to think Biden actually stands a chance.
Robots are cheap but child labor is cheaper
no volume
Should have bought Roku dip instead of PTON
we trade flat, possible some upside. :) the play is to condor or strangle. Its like Earnings day for SPY lol
Actually I went from -99% to -94%, suck it nerd
ok, be sure to make your choice known:

Billions or Succession, which is the better tv show?
Just don't revenge trade and try to make it all back in a short amount of time. That often ends up going badly.

I mainly scalp futures so I'm usually in and out of trades within seconds to minutes.

But as for options on the market, planning on puts if SPY gets to around 345. It might get to 355 as well. Will have to see how price reacts at those levels. Hell, it could go to 400 too.

The other plan is to just wait to see if there's a crash and buy calls at key areas. 314 and 300 being the next support areas.
We’ll be back under 3000 soon enough
NIO has to correct now I can’t handle these gains
Nah Prop 22 will prob pass
[deleted]
You forget the autists who bought calls at the top
Reasonable, balanced thinking? GTFO of this degenerate casino dude
To the tits!
CXW pumping while weed and solar bleed👀
Wtf is happening to stock market did we just save the world? Why is everything so green lol.
Depends if there is a winner
When the only snaps you get are from Team Snapchat 😎
Imagine if we could post gifs in here.

Just imagine the shitposting potential.

Calls on GIF.
How much for your tranny?
how much leverage do you have bro, it's been at 336 for like 4 hours
True, the senate predictions are indicating a fairly even split ([https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/senate/)). A slight Dem majority is within the realm of possibility, though.
Was a shitty day yesterday, spending today trying to get back to my initial amount
Ummm. Lol. Were you here in March?
Won't ANT IPO later in the year, and then long calls on BABA will pay bigly? Especially if it drops down to $250 again.
aight i'm quitting options but I gotta try making up my losses


what if I dump the rest of my available margin into QQQ or smth
[deleted]
Have heard this the past few weeks. Eventually one of you retards will be right
uber puts?
What do I do?
Dunno but it’s very frustrating
First ones free, see you in 2 months @-99%
Zoom out retard
Problem is they need him to sign off on bills and he won't even if they pass them. Any vetoed bill needs 2/3 majority to over turn, which they won't get. Could be a lot of stalemate again if that scenario plays out.
You’re right, what’s 200 more shares going to hurt when you’re already down 6k playing weeklys.
MMs: DAHMP ET
makes no sense
[deleted]
Would be nice if NIo could pump to 36 so I can get out and watch the chaos from cash gang
this
Set your threshold ahead of time and stick to it. Pick your exit to get out if it goes up and pick how far you’re willing to go down before you bail.
Imagine wanting a contested election so your two spy puts can print.
0 calories in bong rips
I hear ya believe me, you go numb to 50% returns lol
mine too, such a piece of shit
no lost too much buying tech on the top before ... but it helped me get some of my money back.. lost 90% on an AMZN call before
[deleted]
Kinda looks like they do lol.
Apple news has one
I weirdly doubt we’ll have too much election trouble. Think people might be wore out over political rioting from the last 6 months of different shit and want to move on. We’ll see tomorrow...
check your personal risk tolerance
I think we def taper into close
Price action alert: SPY is forming a classic flaccid dick pattern
🤣😂🤣😂
atta boy
Yes, do it one hour or more before
I think tonight and tomorrow will be chaotic
[deleted]
Genetics yo
Regardless of the election results, I’m taking a break from all social media.
Sell so we can finally crash
STFU!
Wtf this spy dump
Bullshit. I'm 6'3, all my exes top out at 5'5. Making out while standing blows when you're like a giraffe trying to pick up something off the ground
Is there any reason not to buy a ton of BABA shares right now?
Eat more tendies
I personally love riding my indoor bike while high
market investor is my favorite flavor of nihilism
Good luck.
dont give up retards

eventually you;ll win once

turn your account from -99% to -98%
Puts on nio, it’s the top. Nios battery swap system is ridiculous now that fast charging is a thing via tabless battery
Analysts are simultaneously hacks, and also trying to be "responsible", so its their jobs to consider everything in the price. Part of that might be something like "Trump could shut down trade" to "TSLA is a strong competitor and reduced TSLA car prices could compete with NIO" (which was the stated reason).

Ultimately though, true red blooded bulls know none of that shit matters in this market. Stocks go up because people get excited about them. Nobody is sitting around brooding about could, may, and if. They're thinking "this company is spitting fire every single month and I want some." That's what's driving this bull run.
Like if you made money so far today
[deleted]
PLTR with the straight reversal
0.18% intraday dip and these bears are already coming out to announce their plans to lose even more money. GET REKT YOU FUCKS

This is just stupid at this point. I don't care who won.

My puts hope mango man uses mango woman as a hostage in the oval office tonight, while constantly yelling fraud.
Went all in on SPY puts. God bless me and God bless America. 😃
Buy high, sell low 👍
Holy
Fuck, how do some people bold face lie. I called my roommate out for going to parties and he said he got the vaccine for covid.
[deleted]
What way so stocks only go..? Are you fucking new here
Sell OTM calls
[removed]
not even gonna fall for this fake dump. been raped Friday and Monday at close
Lol i was thinking the same. They are going to dump this shit
GameStop isn’t a long term smart choice, closed like 500 stores in 2 years alone, pretty sure soon they’ll be bankrupt
[deleted]
I love Nio stock, but imo it should’ve been a bit longer to see this jump. But I believe it’s going up, but I got puts on Li auto for sure.
I was going to buy more NIO on the dip, but there has been no dip. Should I just load up at this price? Hmmm
Best place to track live election results? Counting etc
no, it's multi-tasking which is very productive
I’d suck a duck for aapl to go red so I could get more calls
Loaded up on long calls after seeing bond movements. Don’t just look at equities
Bye bye BABA
BUY THEM NOW RETARD.
My theory for this afternoon's action is that buy-side pressure will disappear (why buy the afternoon before the election?) and normal, or slightly higher, sell action will push the indexes lower. Disclosure: I bought QQQ puts this morning.
Wtf is nios volume rn
I don't buy my guns I build them so id always advise against this play :p

Still, the climate ain't right either like you said.
Election coverage is so boring. If you want ratings, just forget election analysis and other commentaries. Just put cameras at polling places in swing states, and find idiots dressed in military uniforms with guns trying to scare voters away. Just broadcast that all day and it will be ratings gold
I think you could argue that it’s just the market moving up to the moving averages
NIO is a fucking godsend
When did girls get so tall?

Everyone out here clearing 5'9" easy
Nice
Then zoom out retard

Dollar bid, metals bid, people not so sure about the election anymore.
none of us are going to be walking right, after this nonsense...
Whats the play eod
People aren’t holding through the election???
If everyone owns OLEDs, QLEDs, etc., why do fucking stupid ass networks insist on putting a dumbass fixed logo in one of the corners of the screen that never moves?  We all know it can burn in images into a screen.  Stop doing that shit.
Even if Mango wins, the house and senate will likely be blue which is big for all clean tech companies. Better buy now. $NIO $HYLN
ok SPY dump now trash set a stop limit.
Down 40%
RemindME!  2 days
Gayme Stop 🌈
Right here baby
Is it counterproductive if I smoke my bong while riding my fake Amazon Peloton?
Who cares. I’m getting tendies. I’ll dump it when it’s time but right now we’re going to Valhalla 🚀🚀🚀.
[deleted]
Awesome day, took a shitload of profit, about 30% cash now, rest of my positions looking good for a swing tmr.  LFG.
Let’s go make it back my friend
me too down 5k
Why SPY is slowing dropping?
Papa Trump is not gonna win?
NLS is the new PTON
Should have bought more at 18 :-(
please let this be true
I’m in
Doordash ads are so fucking dumb when 95% of their orders are Chinese or Burgers
T212 down again? Did the entire UK population just made accounts and now pump the shit outta the market?
You’re right. I was pretty high on nio back then too. Just wish I would’ve stuck with it. Damn. It hurts knowing I was that close and it was that easy
Today could be a good time to get in. But it could also go extremely sour if the election swings the other way. Really just gambling if you buy in now.
Glad you didn’t say heart. Scientists are still studying the black hole where that’s supposed to be.
Im gonna vote today. Wait, i’m not even american 🤡
BOMBS AWAY!!!
Making money bro! That’s all that matters
Sell half at 25% up, one quarter at 40% up and the last quarter is up to you depending on your risk tolerance, let it ride or close out
Alright time travelers tell us what happens to spy tomorrow.
sold SNE calls for $400 when today it would have been $3000 profit 

The next move awaits, til we break ofc
Nice. I was thinking ITM spreads for January but yea I’m not touching anything that I’m holding until after tomorrow.
I think it bounces between $35-$40 till January.
Imagine what will happen to the states like Kentucky/ Alabama who require federal assistance to operate under normal non-covid circumstances. Puts on the south
VXX truly worthless piece of shit
VXX calls?
[removed]
So yolo Healthcare ETFs?  FHLC for the win! 🤣🤣🤣
I think we end red, just my completely unprofessional and biased opinion
Bought the dip on SEDG today.
SPY dropping and VXX just broken
Oof, that’s not great odds. He has a much better chance of losing the pop vote and winning the electoral college. Hard to imagine him winning the pop vote, sorry brother.
Profit is profit man. It could've went 30% the other way. Nobody really knows.
No way china govt will let nio sink
Short from 3378 ([post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jn7ua1/daily_discussion_thread_for_november_03_2020/gb0md1j/)) looking good, covered 1 at 3362, letting rest ride  and hoping for below 3355 and then 3348, then it can really waterfall.
Yes it is part of Tippie
I didnt. You ruined christmas for me.
Bears literally had a fake depression in march.
Looks like a blood bath incoming tomorrow with all these fake pumps the past few days
I am being absolutely raped on the baba calls I bought
Crazy shit likely happens tonight and tomorrow
Worried about the IV crush tonight. Staying out of options and looking for LEAPs on Wednesday to play
🥭 is going to log off his Yahoo Messager for maybe the last time.

Short yahoo.
i usually clock out at 50% gains and reinvest. Going to wait for that nice red river of death to come any day like it did before.
IAU
Sir we are autists here, this is full retard
Got many moneys too?
I’m already out
Got up 340% on some SQQQ last week. Ended up selling at +250%. Hard to sell +40% (or 75%) when you get that thought of +300%
Move over tsla, nio is the one.
[deleted]
Wait to enter BABA, gonna touch 270...maybe
How about we start now?
Alibaba and the 40 **~~Thieves~~** percent loss almost immediately.
I'm going to buy puts eod. Who's with me?
Why not? That would squeeze all the max leveraged bulls who are expecting a post election rally. Seems like thats the crowded trade rn
[deleted]
What kind of IV compression are we expecting overnight on SPY/QQQ options, specifically 11/6's or 11/13's

i think they are mid 50's right now.
lol
the market is not always trending up, see feb 20th to march 20th that is literally a downward trend
[removed]
Sometimes the smartest play is not to make one
Get in again M8. It's never too late
ER might hit it differently. You never know.
why is vxx dumping with spy
He did but the house has control of finances. You think Nancy wants to give trump what he wants?
Handys from yo mama
No way MM let nio end week above 35, if u check volume 35c expiring friday
anyone playing $NET earnings?
If the rest of the election goes off as it is now (no crazy shit) what are you doing EOD? I'm really thinking NIO, SPY, and maaaaaaaaaaybe APHA calls.

I don't have that much capital in it but I do have an average cost of $3.29 on 60 shares...
Wait after ER.
Don’t be a retard like me and lose all the money again.

I wish I just stopped after breaking even every day. -30K to +300 to -30K again.
WeWork redux?
i have one month promo on the card meaning that if i dont pay balance back in full, i have start paying 14.99% APR after promo expires, hence my $93 11/20 lotto expiration date.
Maybe my thinking is wrong, but here it goes...

Trump wins- economy opens up quicker and more oil is needed

Biden wins- tries to ban fracking, small companies go out business, large companies have layoffs, and oil production is cut thus driving up the price of a barrel of oil
Smarter than most.
And in the world
If spy goes to 320 by Friday than I’ll zelle you
best thing I ever did was starting to inverse WSB ... had so much calls for today
😎
Cash
Toys r Us going bankrupt really hurt Mattel and the gaming industry took notice.
no
/VX are VIX futures. Same way /ES are SPX futures
how do you buy those two stocks? Td ameritrade and chase investing doesn't allow it
Depends how many people got out of puts and into calls so far today
Puts on snap. Didn’t go up during that rise this morning. Going to fall today
As hard as your flaccid cock.
Most elections seem to tank the market right after. Remember the trump market panic of 2016?
Wait what the hell is a singles day? Ok : Just googled it. I am sorry about wasting bandwidth asking stupid questions.
Well if you go all in TSLA calls, you should already be up 10 folds. I know it because I sold calls
There is no scenario where Baba goes up on the back of this news. Maybe on some other news, but this news is all bad.
Still scared money smh...
Man, HYLN with that big dick energy. Never thought I would be saying that.
Then reply to emails lazy ass
[deleted]
This is the old version of selling your lambo
Literally have no idea what to do....so I wait.
Fair enough. Didn’t know yahoo finance had a live show but would make sense if there’s no order to any of the list.
Credit card cash advance?
3k orders of Wendy's $15 11/20 puts. $WEN is at $22.60 and hasn't seen $15 since April. I'm in.
DAMN YOU COVID-19!!! (Blows really hard)
Cause we got calls son
After lunch dump incoming
Can't go tits up
got jan 325c's
I mean inflation captures labor costs being more expensive now
Eoy solid $40
Panic at 2pm until close?
My toilet paper hands 🙍🏽‍♂️
Get on the RKT ship while you still can 🚀
Quit investing you pussy. Will be the best decision you will ever make.
Feels like spy’s about to dip
Amazing how retarded some people on the other ends of these emails are. Ffs
[removed]
Puts at the readyyyy
$50
Thank you for this advice!
60
There is not going to be a crash are u all actually retarded MMs will not allow that
Lmao
[deleted]
Gamestop autists managed to use online order numbers to track order flow. They're on track for a huge online Q3.
Might be at 41 by then.
The volume we see the last 5 minutes of the trading day is going to be wild
Assuming you're not joking, no IV crush will happen either way after the event that was spiking IV is over... like earnings or in this case an election.
This is the problem with puts. The market is always trending up. You could be totally right about a 10% drop coming soon. But it goes up 10% first so your puts still don't print.
NIO is the new PTON which was the new TSLA
Ya, they are going to take our guns and rape our wives. I heard that one back in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016.. yet my house is not burned down, I still have my guns, my wife remains un raped and I still have to pay a shit ton of taxes so people in middle america can sit around waiting for factory jobs to come back while smoking meth.
Yeah, pretty bitter about it.
Cucked by CCP
it broke
Your vote only counts if you post a selfie with the sticker on social media.
this guy just made like 20.000 since open
Yea. If we are flat then everyone dead. Seems like the most likely outcome tbh
[deleted]
And I'll spend their tendies at Wendy's
Honestly what do you guys think NIO hits eoy
At least 336.49 am I right?
I truly hope that’s not the case
gross, good luck
Every time i get an email that says per my email yesterday i want to reach through the screen and choke the person
We must settle for 30% returns. That’s my price point from now on. Greed only kills returns
VIX 👀
Let the stimulus begin
Please. It could have easily gone red today too.
Of average trading volume
Decide to be bicurious and turn into a gay bear last Friday for once and down 1500 (40%) on all my bearish positions (SQQQ, VXX). Fuck this shit.
left that strike behind so damn quick as if it didn’t want to be associated with it
Alibaba bulls be like:

BABA black sheep, have you any wool? 

Yes sir, yes sir, **three bags full 😩😩😩**
keke
The market is not goin to tank bro why are u all wishing for a crash
Yeah I'm already up and out for way more than I initially put in, with plenty leftover. I'll see how tomorrow fares after the ballot initiatives are concrete and sell.
Next red day might be $42 -> $40
Of course it’s true? One person buys and another sells- it’s a zero sum gain at all times.
[deleted]
It's a long way to the top, if you want to rock and roll.
I’m so sad that I sold my nio calls for a 30% profit. Would’ve been a 2 bagger by now. Fuck me dude
Sir.. if my margin call gets cleared soon.... I'm in. Calls. All the calls. And if this prints me a 3 bagger. You can fly to Arkansas and ill give you the roughest hand job you've ever had. Ill use rem oil, gun powder and maybe even give you a Beretta bite.
I probably would bro but I legit have nothing left
You sure aren’t selling it well as an act. Anyways, calm down, shits basically over by the end of the day
Raise your hand if you had calls at the top and puts at the bottom. ✋✋
Yeah im feeling pretty strong ab a Biden win (not partisan, based on polling etc). I’m wondering if now is the time to get into the stuff that would perform well with Biden before it becomes more certain. I would buy in to clean energy and a few other things slowly. I have about 1k USD
holding on qqq 300c mar exp but this baba dip seems to good, to sell or not to sell for baba 300c
Exactly my point. Ammo and guns are back ordered  until April at the earliest
Sold my calls and switched to puts. Wish me luck
Republican senate == no states bailout. 

MTA about to be in shambles. CA is fucked.
take the emotion out.  set a defined limit for selling, or once you are up, set trailing stop losses.  use of conditional sell orders is the one part everyone ignores, but mastery of it can dramatically increase your gains.
Y?
If you are looking to make $100 and you do, take the $100 off the table. If you are looking for $1,000 and you make that $1,000, take that off the table. Rinse/Repeat.

If I feel the stock still has some movement in it. I take my profits and look for a reentry. Now I have a new set of downs to work with.
just buy one more from me. I want a new car

Yeah, discipline in my struggle. 20% is an amazing return but you start going numb when your double or even triple returns. It’s a vicious game

Limit down/up tonight would be 🔥🔥🔥
I think they meant the order of the list.  i.e. how is the order of the list determined.
The only thing that got us to that was the stimulus check. 2018 was a dip. 2019 originally dipped until announced a stimulus which spiked the market. That's no different than  when obama bailed out the market during the 2008 crash.
Around 10pm MST we have a decent idea of who is going to win, and by tomorrow morning we'll be pretty clear.

At least that's how normal elections work. Whatever gets called in the next 24 hours will be contested through Thanksgiving because mail in ballots
all good g. PYPL got my lunch covered today
We’re hard to kill.
Never when i bought my hundreds on the dollar SPY poots did I think seeing it dip below 2% today would be a victory lmao
I think I’m just never buying puts again
F ouuta here
Put to Call Ratio 1.12 LMFAO
Puts are melting faster than the polar ice caps
Now that most people dumped their puts its time to bleed down.
I know exactly how this feels! I went from 60k to 30k and had to scrap my way back to 60k! Keep going strong!

Now why would an expert businessman who deals with the CCP on a daily basis make these comments. smh.

But a grt opportunity to buy the dip. Chinese regulators will jerk him around a bit and declare supremacy but cannot afford to really stop it altogether. this is one of their national champions

Have you guys thought inversing your own trades or idk risk management? Fuck I thought my -$20 day was bad
[deleted]
I feel like you have too much fair in journalism as a whole
either set a price target (e.g., 50% profit) or let it run until price action reverses direction and use a trailing stop-loss. If underlying is at ATH, be greedy and hold longer than anticipated

Ya assuming Trump becomes even more of a wildcard in his hypothetical second term he’s probably more likely to legalize then a trad  dem like Joe. 

This is just going off the thing that Trump jr posted on his gram tho lmao.

Reducing position size as the returns start decelerating is the proper way, but some people need to be slapped with losses for months before it actually sinks in.

What they do next is uncertain, but a lot of them like to march around with guns and pretend to be an army. It's a little worrisome to some people.

Well for every trade there’s a winner and a loser. It’s just that a small percentage of the players win the vast majority of the trades.
Yeah that’s right. They also won’t stop you from executing number 4, but at that point you have the 90 day ban/PTD classification.
Great plays. The only thing I'd change is apple. It's neutral normally up and down throughout november and December (dipping in January after reports). You'll probably see at most 3% up and down per week.
Don't get me wrong, more power to any of you who made money off of NIO or BABA or any other Chinese companies, but if any of yall retards are still surprised that this is happening, you deserve to lose money if you did. This is why, as appealing as any Chinese companies seems, I personally don't touch them since the government can literally fuck you in the ass anytime.

This shit happened cause Ma said some non PC stuff regarding the country, if you piss off the govt in anyway, you will burn for it, any of the big companies in china needs approval from the govt to be successful in any major form, and they can take that opportunity from you just as quickly as when they first gave it to you.

Good luck guys.
If the incumbent holds office, what happens to NIO?
Did you ask, nicely?
Can Nio go back to 35. Wtf is this

What the fuck that's the only reason I went.
Sad... don’t give up man
3 every rolling 5 day period.
Yeah in december
My mind says BABA monthlies but my mind says weeklies
Before you enter a trade, set levels where you will take profit or take a loss and follow your levels when they hit. I tend to cut a losing trade all at once but scale out of winners. I set two or three levels to cut 20-30% of a position and let the last 10-20% ride. Sometimes I’ll rebuy on dips if I like the stock.
Congrats, I sold at the first spike. I should’ve held an hour longer but I’m a pussy. So I bought puts like a retard. Obviously NIO only goes up. Or I should’ve bought $35p.

According to NatGeo:
“Under federal law, states would have to follow a uniform process to deliver their electoral votes to Congress by late December. The timeline was intentionally created to give states time to deal with electoral disputes without allowing it to drag on indefinitely. States have until six days before the winning electors meet to resolve any issues. In 2020, this “safe harbor” deadline—so named because it guarantees that a state’s resolution of outstanding issues will be accepted by Congress—is December 8.”
Bought nio leaps at $25 a share. Sold a week later for a 30% gain. If I held it would’ve been over 150% gain by now 🤡🤡🤡🤡
yea
3 day trades in 5 days. The 4th will cause you trouble
Dont forget to lose it or you gotta pay taxes on it
ive been waiting for a nio dip since it broke 30... guess i missed that train

Oh shit, almost there bro, end it strong! In regard to TAN, wait until the erection crap blows away, a Biden win is great for TAN.
I’ve decided to become a bot
Is this high or low? 10% of what
True dat and this one was almost instant. Must be the big dildo rally for today.
the buddy really adds to the condescending tone ahahah
Unless you're stupid 10% -20% a month are good gains
Loaded up on BABA 350c 1/15/21...see you guys next year on my yacht!!!
I was up 75% today on $PLTR calls. Now I’m almost break even :/
The coming FOMC meeting this week has more impact on market than the election. IMO
I wish reddit had laugh reacts :)
Good trade idea, I'll watch it
Or will go through but with CCP now owning half of it.
What strike you looking at?
Lmao okay buuuuudddyyy
I know I’m dumb but please help me

Robinhood will let you do 3 day trades in the span right? It’s only the 4th one that locks you out?

Thanks for this!
I looked at the odds for Senate races doesnt look like the Dems will be flipping enough to get a majority, Dems will countrol the House and Biden is favourite to win

Knowing the Chinese, they'll find a way to seize the company and have him replaced with someone willing to toe the party line instead of outright destroying the company. If they outright fucked over one of the single largest Chinese companies in existence it would destroy international trust and investment in Chinese firms for a long time to come. They aren't that stupid. They'll find a way to make Ma bend to their will, or they'll hand the company over to someone else. Then the IPO will move forward.
I guess the wind stopped blowing?
True. But they have an enormous first mover advantage, they’ve become a verb stock (Netflix n chill, google, zoom. This has crazy marketing power) they only do streaming instead of being partially in parks (Disney), they don’t have any conflicts of interest with their IP being tied to a partner cable network (Disney again), huge network effect, extraordinary original content spend, massive international growth, ability to raise prices significantly without losing many subscribers over time, & this is all without ads which is the prime money maker for the content creation world
Did you get slaughtered in the September massacre as well?
Can you help me get rich please
stimulus isn't money printing.  They take money from the rich in exchange for bonds.  They then take that money and spend it on dumbass shit.  Stimulus is just another way to rearrange the money supply

Best way is to have a set price target before you hit the trade. Once it hits the target I sell. You have to be disciplined.

Damn got me. You aren’t wrong 🤡
Funny they would write this article when at the same time they are loading up on ass loads of 30 year bonds.  Commercial banks have something like 4 trillion dollars in bonds between all of them.  Here's a question for everyone:  What happens to equities when bonds go up?  Goldman sachs also wrote an article saying that gold was going to skyrocket past 3k when it was hot.  At the same time they've been buying every bond in sight since 2016, a bet on deflation if anything because lower yields means lending conditions will probably tighten, hence less borrowing.  These guys aren't your friend, and imo no one should ever take their advice.
Strike?

Inflation bad
I just realized the girl with tourettes syndrome in Duece Bigalow was Amy Poehler.
Market pricing in a government trifecta (big red wave or big blue wave). If one party controls the house, senate and presidency in an environment with zero inflation pressure, they could moon the economy and stock market.
i would feel like a broke fuck cuz I can only afford three
That’s absolutely not true at all. It is not 50%. If that were the case there would be a lot more winners out there.
I'm sad that they knocked down the leverage, but man it got absolutely destroyed that fateful day GDX and GDXJ had like a -20% or -25% day followed up by another massive drop. Now First Majestic has about the same IV as GDX. It'll cycle back to popularity if gold drops back to $1,700 to climb again or hits $2,000, though both could be a ways out.

Biggest IV crush is expected after election. Let me elaborate. There is going to be a clear winner tonight and either parties are going to be poise about it. Sure, there will be unrest here and there but democracy is in play. You had the chance to vote, whomever is chosen just suck it up. Amen

I could not agree with you more to be honest, your right and smart about sitting it out for now. Right now I have no clue which way but after election this should get interesting. I need to get my overall back lol need so make smart plays soon, what are you thinking for your next potential play
They're decentralised and time tested. No guarantee either way but with one we know many of the loopholes and is much more labour intensive to break

Uh he's playing one side. Selling puts **and calls** is theta gang. He's not theta gang.
Don’t forget ex-dividend date is Friday, too
Trump is winning, SPY is up.
Damn does Tippie run this?
Yeah went public not too long ago, holding shares long at $88. It's a wild ride this one, but Im a believer in their game engine so they can have my money
Then now would be the time to buy em..when your fear is at an all time high

Just wait a couple of days
I want to hang myself, congrats

You think itll shoot past 40?
Yea definitly, this should be a day of red

Dear poors,

Why lose money when you can make money?
I just want  about eight million and travel
Anyone that makes those seltzer drinks. Why not play  Anheuser Busch.
Yeah this is great
The issue is the Chinese govt is retaliating against jack ma after he criticized the govt. I think they might shut down the ipo for longer or not let it go through
Literally everything is Green today are U stupid?
yes
Indeed. Don't fuck with Xi. Those Triads don't fuck around like Western people.
I think this makes you a stable genius
hows your butt feeling
GME gonna hit that short squeeze when first day sales of new consoles comes out
I sold this morning like a paper handed bitch
This is the way
Maybe buying dat paypal dip wasnt such a bad idea....
Jack Ma is probably one of the most powerful people in a China right now. The government isn’t just going to “pause” this IPO and wait for additional disclosure. My money is on it being cancelled. 

You can’t see the stuff Chinese media has been posting about Jack Ma. Not been pretty.
Haven’t tried that yet I’m a complete noob. Played echo vr and had my mind blown flying around having people in there teach me how to play it was surreal.
Yeah that about sums it up. I feel like wall street has the memory of a fish

How do I know winter is here? When my internet stops working all of a sudden. Fucking xfinity only works properly during the summer.
The key issues here are 

\- Buy PUTs

\- The IPO is cancelled, money being returned to investors. 

\- ANT have to use 30% of their own money for originating loans. Previously the requirement was 2%. 

\- They already have 2T Yuan in loans outstanding which means they need 700b Yuan to cover them. That's USD$45 Billion required, when the IPO was only due to raise $25. 

\- Ant is no longer worth $300B, not even close. 

\- Baba own 30% of Ant Financial and was running on the back of "World's biggest IPO".

What type of answer is this. Take that bullshit back to r/stocks

Actual retarded question for you guys - I wrote a MSFT put at 207.50 for $300 premium. I ended up getting assigned the shares. I’m about break even for the shares now but did my portfolio keep the +300 in premium?

Who is staying up tonight? I got my snacks and energy drinks ready.
Spy train was 2 days ago. It’s just now back to where it’s been. I think right now allot people are hyped on NIO at the moment. My suggestion is to go Tesla 2022 Jan 1k call. That play has allot open volume still and interest. If you got in on Monday that call was around 2k it’s already back to 3k. 
If you ply nio Idk I just suggest to buy shares. My opinion. The short term lotto plays have popped. But there is allot hype so I think the bulls will push nio to 100$ by x mas maybe. Idk that optimistic 

Right now my positions are 85$ amd call nov 20th nothing but loss. Bought at the top and bag held 

Apple 120$ call 6/18/2021 this is little more of a conservative play. 

I got SPY Jan 2021 400$ call bought at the top bag held my whole position. 

And I think I have a QQQ put retarded play all together almost made 9$ on it yesterday decided to bag hold. 

I just also want to say. I love you guys. All you autist and bag holders out there.
Hmmm I’m gonna check your info out. Thx for the input
30% loss is better than 100%
Insider polls say yes
Where you been?
Sir, this is a comic book.
Probably a good idea to stop trading OTM weeklies. Unless you're using charts to pinpoint entries, it's a sucker's game. 

I don't know, maybe only buy calls on big drops. Even the fastest drop in market history was followed up by the fastest recovery in market history. The market goes up like 80% of the time.

If the market is going to crash, I think we'll see at least mid 340s first. But I don't know, once the election is over, there will be less uncertainty.

Personally, I'm sitting out until I see how the market reacts.

It does seem, that everyone has front run tomorrow Biden win, hence the 2 day small rally, expecting a mega green tomorrow, as in 2016. Perhaps it really is going to be different this time around, red tomorrow, due to some vote counting "issues", for example, and then greenish Thursday-Friday. Or maybe it really will be really that simple and obvious, Biden wins, SPY 360 by Friday, or something like that.

I’ve seen Trump as low as +130 today...Pennsylvania he’s at +120 and Biden/Harris have made multiple stops there today, 4 a piece yesterday. I don’t think their internal numbers are as strong as the media polls. Personally, only bet I made on it was Texas -460 and Florida -220. Everything else is a toss up.

I've been subscribed to unusual whales for a couple of months and it's somewhat helpful but not totally sure if it was worth it.

This is solid advice. Surprising for this sub

EDIT - jambi - just google "covered calls".

You're really far in the money on NIO.  You might as well generate some cash out of it.  Your risk on selling the call options is contained because you own NIO.

Buying puts just means that if NIO tanks then your puts offsets whatever loss NIO takes.  The example that Erik gave is solid.

Godspeed Autist and a heartfelt congratulations
Grats to people holding NIO. Lowkey thought that shit wasn't worth it back in July. Feeling FOMO for some 2023 OTM calls
If that's a short squeeze abandon hope for all who travel there

Bleh day
It is possible. It’s a toss of a coin depending on the results that would happen. Someone brought up major cities being blue, which, yeah, that doesn’t help the odds. It isn’t impossible though
Trump can’t just contest - there are strict guidelines to contest and you have to go through county to county to determine that. Doubt that will happen.
I got NIO leaps $25c for 01/15/2023, had 8 and sold 6 for 80% return in 2 weeks, now I sit with two and hope they can take me to promised land. Might have to load up some more stocks, only got 100
The sell off was last week
I'm still upset with Trump because of the day I went all in on JDST back when it was 3x during a quiet week and 30 minutes later he tweeted "I am the Tariff Man!", causing gold to spike and taking 15% off my portfolio.
Pointless comment, because you know no one is
Sounds fire! Hope you get to enjoy some!
Why work for the company of you can own part of it... im talking about buying a share.
I agree, and this election will most likely get close to 150m votes which is good for dems. The problem for GOP is that they need a huge wave of support to be showing up at the polls right this minute to catch up to dems early vote, making long lines a soothing sight for GOP
Spy 420 1111 same cost
Calls still be expensive though!
With 51% or precincts reporting, I can safely say that Bears r fuk
What makes you like APHA so much better

NEWS NETWORKS LAUNCHING 'LIVE POLLS' WHERE GUESTS/PUNDITS PANDER TO VIEWER RATINGS OF THEIR OPINION IN REAL-TIME
Graphs
You mean the results 12 hrs + 1 week from now.

Guy listen I’m not trolling you. If you don’t believe me I get that. I’m not sour, if Biden wins he wins. Yeah it will suck for America but I survived Obama for 8. Get a life guy. I can realize life still goes on. You can’t. That’s why no one likes libtards
Go Behind Wendy’s and pump those odds
Even more so than life savings on GameStop options expiring in a week after a 40% run up?

I want to buy nio I really do... I just know that once I do the ATH will be pinned on my tick
Beto lost by only 200K votes in 2018. There’s been significantly more west coast liberals moving here since then.
I wonder why governor of Florida has just announced they are deploying the national guard 🤔can look it up rn
no matter what he can cash out at $20??
Its actually the opposite 🤦
This bs pump is going to burn by eod today! For the sake of my puts 😂😂🥺🥺
I don’t think it doesn’t matter who wins. If Biden win Trump will contest market will take a shit. If trump wins, every major city will burn, market will take a shit. So buy callls end of day today.
Legit daydream about waking up in February and clearing out my 401k.

If you don’t know why that’s a surprise I dont know what to tell ya. lol. Look at their history over the past 600 years
Woahahahahahahha wowowoeowowowowowowo omg Jesus fuck!!!! Wowowoeowowowowowowowowowow
Even though a good chunk of Democrats turning in ballots already are massively ahead in early-voting, a large voter turnout has historically been in favor of democrats as a whole.

I mostly buy video game stocks. They say buy what you know. I want to buy more
Oddsmakers have R party for popular vote at around 10%. Honestly even if Trump wins I think the pop vote goes to D =>99%. Either way 4 to 1 is a terrible payoff for that bet.
should I be worried about my 336p 11/6
Wise words my dude
Get out while you still green

well yeah he's fucking broke lmao.
Niche. And no competition.
Had my 1 work call for the day - about to do some 930am BRs and settle in for the results 12 hours from now
TWNK December calls. Earnings on Thursday. Lot of open interest
Pretty sure trumps turnout was very very high historically. The problem was everyone was indolent and expected a victory for Clinton due to bad polling methodology. Which is that happened this time. That alone makes everything up in the air low key

Nio cars objectively look better than Tesla cars, fight me

I went here in Dallas TX and the CEO burger is yummy. CEO is ex Burger King exec who was head of franchise expansion efforts at one point taking it international and marketing. Important because all Burger Fi has to do is get to the west coast and it’s game over, successful national brand. Currently it’s mostly only successful in Florida with a cult following.
I would sell tech now and buy in late afternoon if you're still bullish here
Im talking about autmated tellers, due to power outages and internet outages caused by the CIA
sigh.. what a world, when gains on shares of AMC beat my options plays..
150% return is not good enough for me

PSA: Always hold cash for discount days
So if mango won how many Green Day’s we going to have?
Real life picture of OP waiting for his wife to finish
yup bc IV is v high
Naw still early for the company. China is going to be the world’s biggest EV market. Nio is a Chinese company backed by the Chinese government. They will want them to succeed over the American competitors, mainly Tesla. Tesla is currently 10x the value of Nio. Plenty of room for Nio to grow and possibly surpass Tesla in the future
It will just to fuck all the puts
Some of their super cars legit look like a modern batmobile doee
GME calls, held those a bit too long, SPY puts last week to make it back, then bought PLUG at $14 right before the spike. Going shares and covered calls now lol. Maybe take some small option positions.

Their motivations could be to drain the Catholic babies' blood. But that doesn't matter to what we're discussing.

We're discussing Ron "National Clown" Paul's position, are we not? 

Remember, whether we get rid of the Fed rests on you making a cogent argument that we can jointly examine -- not insult others or impugn their motivations.

The scary part, if the markets ARE pricing in a Biden win -- how is the market going to react for the lame duck presidency? Any past examples to help make decisions?

Man, there's so much action this week for me - markets, soccer, politics. I love this week.
I can not WAIT.
Shockingly, the economic theory that is based on sound money and anti-govt intervention in the markets has been cast aside by the people who want to inflate the currency and intervene in the economy.
Reeee
Yes I've talked to buddies that still work there and they have been going gang busters since corona hit. They started giving the workers 1.75 OT rate as opposed to 1.5
At least pick a reasonable strike if you're going to bet either way. These SPY 270p or 360c plays are just fucking dumb unless you're setting expiry at like 3 months.
QQQ up 1/3 of a point since RH couldn't get my bid in, awesome.
anyone got any cheat codes? been trying to beat this game for over a year but cant win
That is a terrible bet. Trump's money line was only like +150 to +175 and he has to win FL, PA and then some combination of MI, AZ, WI. It is at a minimum a 3 state parlay where he is the underdog in all of them if you believe the polls are at all accurate. Even if you think they are wrong or it is a toss up you are looking at much longer odds than +150.

Can someone point me to a stock currently dumping so I can buy some dips

No, as my first comment said, Biden all the way purely because of his favorable stance toward helping me eliminate my loans.

I was just trying to point out that I think, for the vast majority of voters, it comes down to a candidate's ability to affect their wallet and religion. Everything else is tangential at best.

Why would the market price in a Trump victory when he's currently sitting at around 10 percent chance to win based on the polling data. The market doesn't have any other secret data that others don't.
Y’all use the most biased sources for polls. Buy leaps and take a nap till market close 🙄

Holding puts til end of day. I’d be happy to maintain a 50% loss at this point but hoping for a dump
If you have $5 million to bet like this, you probably do it more to be able to say you did it. Winning probably doesn't matter to him.



Unless he went full retard, which we all know one should never do.

BuildAWall Trump been priced in since yesterday
Oof
Poor boys stand down
My strategy is usually to go against the crowd, I go based off speculation and news and rationality which clearly isn’t working, I’ve been mainly trading spy and I played Facebook earnings and got fucking raped, I mainly play spy tbh
OK have to ask now.. Sold the $37 calls after the run up yesterday but getting ass blasted today lol. How do you manage such positions where it has run up so much that it's more expensive to buy back than the premium you made? It's Jan dated so I could wait for it to fall
Now change the guy to little pimp
What were your positions?
This ^
good job waiting until VIX was down 6%.
man NIO puts are really cheap atm
I know I'm just going to watch it and cry
this is not a trump sub
You were told that by retard bears and listened lol
Apple lol. Closed spread yesterday.
Ok reefer madness hot take
$5M on QQQ 18 JUN 21 270 P
Great shooting kid don’t get cocky
What
Everything is priced in including OnlyFans IPO 😘
I've $SPY puts, you think they will print tomorrow?
FUBO has meme status potential.
Loaded to the tits with puts. Sleepy joe will win. All trumps gains in the stock market wiped out in 6-9 days. See you in tendie town retards.
Don't know if y'all paying attention to GME today, but it's barely even dipping with the market, just steadily charging straight up all day so far.
I’m damn near out of capital 😳
So your only partially a retard?
ok
Yeah it took me a bit to seriously comprehend that. Still can’t get over the thought
Just got cleaned out today Bc of this retard market.  Thanks for the fond memories. ✌🏾
Voted. Wrote in “J-Pow”. Feeling very patriotic.
no and I just checked and the bottom half of my body is missing

Go on
Wow that’s interesting. Well i definitely think they got all hands on deck now as well. If biden gets elected can you imagine what might happen. And if not, we still have insane racial tensions with another trump presidency as well as a pandemic and overall widespread fear causing gun/ammo purchasing
Nothing cause votes are tallied and exit polls are biased
This pretty much explains today. Quite happy with my decision to sit this session out. Today’s massive rally is a mystery.
Candy cigarettes are the worst gateway drug. I’d smoke a pack a sitting of those babies
I sold a call spread and sold a put spread Im raking in your premium! Between 330 and 343 by close tomorrow and all your precious premium is mine!!!!! Muahahahaha!!!

If market is pricing in a trump victory someone tell me why plug is up 10%

Somehow robinhood purchased pltr shares for me at 10.72 on ipo day even though the price was supposed to be 10...
When you sell your CCs, take 10% of the premium and buy a weekly call ATM....you'll feel less sad no matter how things shake out.

Also, RSI on JPM is through the roof right now, it's coming back down in the next week or so, but maybe not by Friday to save your CC. Regardless, just buy back in or sell a CSP when RSI is low again. Rinse and repeat.
9k in GEO calls. If it does the same as 2016, I will make 200k+
doesn't matter, all that matters is to bet against volatility in the long run
Legalize and tax weed. Finally a sensible national policy. Can use that money for so much.

I’m pretty sure we don’t find out the clear winner today but we get an idea best case scenario for bears is we get some states today and the race is super close more likely to be contested
I’ve never seen it this green before bears are fucked on a molecular basis
Fldm reaching $7 this week? What yall think
54%, lmao. They might as well just say stonks only go up. At least that would be clear they’re just guessing like anyone else.
Damn. Youre rich AF now

Bears in shambles

Okay I'll give you an explanation. The Fed is responsible for terrible monetary policy and controbutes largely to every economic downturn, and directly caused and prolonged the Great Depression. I hope that explanation wasn't too long for you.

PSA: If youre buying puts today buy futures instead of SPY. That way you can still sell when something crazy happens when the market is closed.
You’re not doing it right then
Little gonna be out too sadly, mostert being out too is also telling because I love him, he has so much potential to be an amazing runner but he’s gotten hurt a few times every year it’s sad to see, hasty been playing well, actually a lot of the backs have been but they end up getting injured. Just been a rough year and being at .500 makes me think “what if we were healthy” but that’s sports so whatever

It's pretty easy
People HATED Clinton
There wasn't a huge Rep turnout more of low Dem turnout
Trump won independents
Trump won by razor thin margins in MI/WI/PA
Comey emails really screwed Clinton 

2020
Now lots of people HATE trump
Huge voter turnout which generally" supports D
Biden is winning over independents and doing much better with Seniors
The Hunter Biden story isn't sticking
Biden is setup much better in states Clinton didn't win (GA AZ MI WI PA)

Biden is rightfully the favorite but crazy shit can happen. Trump didn't win the election in 2016 as more as Clinton lost it with low turnout (everyone thought she was going to cruise), many more undecideds on election day and independents tilting towards Trump.
Its a Green day but my account is Red WTF!!

I hope you realize 99.99% of the people responding are fucking peasants that will never break out of the middle class when and if  they ever get there.... Real fuck you money? net worth has to be at least 100 million. people saying <20m? gtfo... 20million goes very fast, problem is they don't know that because they will never have 20m. you can't even retire on 5-6m how the fuck could that be fuck you money? fucking crack head peasants....
I see what you mean, and I don’t mean to be a Debbie Downer, but I’m almost certain the reason the Nov. 20 strikes go so low is just because it’s a monthly call and not a weekly

Makes perfect sense! Vaccines are made from chook eggs afterall.

Agree with this analysis. Then it just comes down to how the market will react to stimulus + whichever pres. wins.

I actually see the market tanking in a Trump win. I think wall street has recently realized he's only using them and that the volatility and uncertainty isn't worth it even tho he gets on twitter to hype up JPOW.
i just want to puke about this week in general.
The people at my polling place can’t figure out how to prop a door open and I’m to trust them with the integrity of an election? This is madness.

Good luck! Mine are already up 40% and the election could easily push our plays into much higher returns
What will you all hold through tomorrow for election?
I bought a 334 spy put at  3355. Worst trade of my life. I never try to call tops like that but my portfolio has been flat for a couple weeks and emotions got the best of me
Probably once the outcome of today is resolved
Decent entry this morning. I like the 6 month chart. Bought some 30c for March 2021. Looking at it, I think this is pretty undervalued at 2 billion market cap considering the valuations of other EV plays right now. Once more start to catch on, I could see this doubling into the end of the year possibly. I’ll take the ride. Options volume not great, but safe with longer dates I think. Made out like a bandit on NIO (still holding some 20c leaps), and this looks similarly positioned in the scooter/moped field.
You, like me are betting on a contested election.
Earnings thursday, If biden wins, this should be $300 tomorrow and then crap shoot to either $270 or $330 later in week. Lets pray $330

Dude, meme price theory is real with Tesla.
Isn't that just alphabet?
Data shows Joe has an excellent chance of winning. Markets follow the data. Safe to assume market is pricing Joe winning right now.
"the only reason it's Biden" Josh got stuck in a loop lol
r/investing is that way ----->
I'm guessing it will go up this week because there will be a lot of volatility.

You got 73% left, plenty to make a comeback. I was 60% down all time and now slightly up. You got this!
Hehe down 1300 by friday
It could always be worse :D and it could always be better :D
Just got back from the polls. Note - Am in PA. Was it a mess for anyone else? I asked the woman why it took so long. She said that literally hundreds of people got the mail-in ballots and then ripped them up and came in anyways, so they had to get a provisional ballot. Those wont be counted for a week apparently, and that was a ton of people all across the state. This could be a wild ride

Well my shit ending 11/6 has been worthless for at least a week now. Just going to hold.
Umm isn't that all of our reasons? Biden is only attractive because of the student loan forgiveness he's going to rain on me
Lost 27% of my portfolio trading a 1dte today. Biggest loss ever. Fuck this shit hurts but I 100% deserve it😔

Bears are a bunch of party poopers
But inequality wasn't as big as today, so rich people weren't astronomically better off from the average citizen, so things were fairer. And it's been observed that our brains don't care about absolute wellness.

We are a happier group if most people get 5 dollars and a few receive 10 dollars, than if most people get 10 dollars while a few receive 40 dollars.
bears pls buy the puts that I am selling.

A rising market has preceded a victory for the sitting party 86% of the time since 1928.
KC about ready to pump to 40 again, under cover of the election???
Definitely, I feel like the mass production of one size fits all sack suits kinda stripped them of their appeal, making them associated with soulless corporatism and dodgy politicians.
Holy fuck green dildo on spy
fyi it looks like the packers already beat the 49ers, i have multiple sources
Tanked 1%, went up like 5% on his recovery.
To feel superior of course. Everyone else is a sheep, but my throwaway vote means I’m different... I’m better.
5% rise? Sure. 

15% rise? Possible if we hit a euphoric streak.

54% rise? I want whatever those JP Morgan analysts are smoking.
Yessir, i mostly stopped trading options. Up 80 dollars today on aapl and tsla shares🤗
Hey dumbfuck, its a link to a book that is literally the fucking explanation. Would you like me to type out the book for you? Are in capable of reading more than small paragraphs?

If trump wins definitely, if Biden wins people are going to pile into clean energy stocks, if you remember what happened to banks in 2016, same thing will happen with renewables for the next couple weeks.
Found the gay bear jealous of my gains
When do we know who “wins”? (I’m not in Us)
My buddy that works in PE said that the street has been pricing in a blue sweep for the last couple weeks.

I smoked a bong full fruit loops, now I’m watching the mid-morning movie.
Sir this is a casino. Everyone with half a brain understands trump is way better for foreign trade, but the ppl in this sub are 1) on reddit so they hate drump, 2) legitimately autistic, or 3) fucking with u. There’s no need for whatever ur tryna say because nobody here will listen
So you don't see any potential for exponential growth in this stock once covid is over and everyone is back on cruise lines???
I think 45 days gives you time for your play to materialize.  For instance those who sells weeklies last week wouldn’t be able to recover but if they had longer expiry,  this week would have give them an opportunity to exit with profits
Perfect time for theta gang to go in
Opportunity to buy more vix puts

I used to work at their ammo plant. All I can say is when Obama was in office for 8 years we worked 60-80 hours a week. We had guys making $30+/hr just sitting at tables hand packaging the boxes of rounds as all the automated packing machines were running full capacity.

Then trump won and we laid off like 20% of the work force and cut hours back and inventory went through the roof because we couldn't sell it fast enough. Look at vsto stock price 2015-2016 then look at 2017 as trump takes office
Pretty sure the hod for SPY has been printed... Holding a small position in some $336P bought at $3.80 when it printed $338s but not expecting anything crazy think maybe spy can test $335 before a bounce into close > have a 20% stop in this and will gladly take a 50% gain if I get it
So cramer talked about nio. Is that what caused this back to back gain
I got a 340 and a 341 spread. Best of luck to you
Just curious how do I find this out?
its  inevitable
dollar going down is bullish for companies, since inflation = more revenue.
Market doesn’t like unknown. It’s up just based on the hope that election may finally be decided soon.

I'm also shorting NIO. Wish me luck. Seems like a bubble though.
So it's first down again, Michael VIX back in the shotgun and he looks over towards the sideline for the signal. Man in motion to his left, and here's the snap, VIX steps up in the pocket. He's looking, looking, moves to his left and he's looking deep, and he checks it down and completes a pass for a short pickup.

Itellya, they really expected to be able to get some deep looks for VIX today, and he's been looking for them but they've been well defended
Back to pavilion
He is the one
Doesn’t matter. Hopefully Donnie doesn’t kamikazee the economy when he loses.

If congress and presidency go blue, Donnie will need to be a good boy and keep the trendies flowing so Biden goes easy on him in court maybe.

If Biden wins and Congress is red, bulls mayb fuk.

If Trump wins and Congress is blue - bulls mayb fuk

If Trump sweeps congress and presidency, bears are kill.
Thank you ATVI puts easy money. Shit can’t break over $77.50

Biden win= Trillions in stimmy

Trump win= Trillions in stimmy.

Little people playing with matches and rocks make the news.
Just fyi, that's not an explanation, that's a link to a website. You might be unfamiliar with what the difference is -- one displays even a rudimentary understanding, and the other is a book selling outfit. 

It's like if someone asks for money and you give them a giraffe. A giraffe is a different thing.

Also Ron Paul is a known national clown and racist. He's the guy who hired a blimp that ran out of money for his campaign. He's the guy who let his campaign manager die with millions of hospital debt after the guy raised millions for Paul. The racist guy who ran tasteless ads claiming that MLK, who did in fact not like racists, would support him. The guy who doesn't understand or believe in evolution.
I’m assuming everyone’s selling then going to lunch for the day

so does trump flee the country come jan when he hands over power? lol
I've usually seen SPY IV around the 15-20% range so yeah probably.
I wouldn't bet with what you can't lose. If I lost my whole account today it wouldn't be a big deal.

yeppp, 334P 333P 332P 331P and the beat goes on...
Go rewatch the school house rock episode on how bills become law, Dingleberry. They require the presidents approval or a 2/3 vote. Soooo what about Congress?
The Chinese government just trolled the entire investing world.
1k to 13k, that's actually really good bro. If you achieve that with the 9k you could be sitting on 100k

Never playing VXX again
Floridas rules require the sec of state to get results within 30 min of polls closing regardless of whether or not theyre finished tabulating. My point is just that whatever gets first reported wont be final. And in an election this heated and contested your damn sure to see it all go to the courts before anythings set in stone.
There’s only one rule.  Never mess with a Sicilian when death is on the line! 

Inconceivable

That’s true, but if you were to randomly select a person who lost money in the stock market in the era of the picture taken, you’d very likely select someone who lost money in the 1929 crash.

Username checks out.
Bought 100x SPX 11/09 3415C yesterday. Sold today for a gain of $104k. Could have held longer for a gain of nearly $300k. Normally I'm good about reminding myself "gains are gains, get up and get out" when I make a short-term YOLO. But damn, that woulda been epic. 

Now need to not trade anything for a few days. I have a bad habit of chasing winners and losing it all.
Nio on a moon mission
I don't feel secure at all if I see a $1,000 jump, need to see like $4,000 to make sure I won't dip into red later in the day. Leverage is helluva thing
Would be funny if all indices closed near 0%.
Sold some OTM December calls so kind of?
No more plays for today. Nothing looks good. Unless AAPL dips hard
If I have reason to believe there will be a 54% spike, even if only for a second, I'm taking out a massive loan. Remortgage the house sized loan. Student debt sized loan. Yolo to end all yolos

Because last week was the biggest red week we've had since March so some decent green days is to be expected regardless of the election.
At first I thought I would never go to the moon. Papa Elon was seeing red and his electro mobile made me sad as its share price looked beyond the reach of a poor mortal. But then I listened to Morpheus, took the red pill and realised Nio was indeed the One. Nio had emerged from the matrix to take us to the moon and beyond. Ever look back. Stonks only go up. Electric car go brrrrr

Hey real talk, with this much cash at stake consider selling as far out of the money covered calls as you can with early expiry to buy protective puts at your initial price with late expiry, something like this:

https://imgur.com/a/6ysAFlL

I took a guess on around how many shares you own so adjust contract numbers accordingly - 1 contract = 100 shares, but basically you'd pay 8k and take the risk that for the next month you'd have to forfeit any gains past $45 if it makes it there, but you'd completely protect your investment from loss for over a year.

Do it again with just the call side and take the risk of capping your gains for another month and you've completely paid for your insurance and have effectively a 0 risk position with unlimited upside for the next ~400 days, and you'll be protected if they gap down big past your trailing stop or end up being completely fraudulent, because, ya know, china.

I know WSB is all yolo's and FDs, but this is real money my mans, enjoy the big win and don't lose it!
SPY 336 psst... come here

Looking for fade to vwap, shit popped off this morning, all ATRs blown up, can it actually just go higher on no news?
HYLN! need you to go up another... does math 100%
I bought 11/13 40c NIO with some spare cash and it doubled. Had I used the rest of my money to buy that I'd be up hugely right now.

Still, I'm up 34% today.
Yes

Ah someone in general thread just pointed out new Zealand is 12 hours ahead of us so the MMs mist have called then to get the results. Mystery solved.
I would get some pots and pans and bang em outside. Riot the shit out of it.
Yeah but market share.. and purchasing power.. not to mention manufacturing capacity
Plus it’s backed by the Chinese gov’t
Glad to dump my SPY puts for $7 loss (taken by E*TRADE for executing my trades 😤)
But what if the drop last week was fake and gay?
im here in philly and people are spouting bullshit like we’re preparing for civil war because businesses are being boarded up in center city. did you see the eagles super bowl parade? no election can top the chaos of that lmao. anyways spy 420 1/21

One of the reasons ANT IPO was suspended is because of small loans. Chinese government thinks people taking small loans to invest or pay mortgage will threaten the financial stability of the country.

I’m not opposed just in disbelief!
GME gang lets get it!
When my trading account jumps by $1000, I feel nothing...

When I use a $10 coupon on an Amazon purchase, "***holy fuck that was a steal!***"
Why this looks like legit TA DD.
At least he could lose his majority tho.
Here's hoping
You didn't hear? No stimulus check till next year, rising covid cases, nationwide lockdowns and the most controversial election to date. Bigly green
Yeah apparently I don't know how VXX works.
Brother you are ok, keep fighting on. I bet on volatility today and now my living situation is going to be volatile. I guess we just don’t care about a contested election
Little blankets on my feet..socks.
I bought NIO 35c leaps when it was at $25 (a week ago) and ITM already....wtf
So the put/call ratio on VIX is 1.9 (higher puts purchases) and it is .45 on VXX/UVXY (higher calls).  VIX buyers tend to be “smarter” money where as VXX/UVXY is more often used by RH traders.
Exactly these guys are too into old investment styles hahaha
Dude it’s Philly, it wouldn’t be the first time we had looting/rioting this week. It’s gonna be so much worse with a trump victory.
Tech goes up, sell a few contracts, buy weed, weed goes up a bit. All day.
Bought one 45 dte otm $NIO for shits and giggles but other than that I'm staying the fuck away until election shit dies down.
So you’re still claiming it was just short covering? Ok Bobby stay in denial, no one can see you cry behind a screen.
NIO 😍😍 Tim apple got nothing on my new love
this is wallstreetbets not politics
Is a 339-341 iron condor expiring tomorrow stupid? Break evens 338.14 and 341.86
Haha my puts just went from -60% to -55%

Stupid-ass bulls 😄😄😄😄🚀
VXX tracks SPY puts. Bears too afraid to buy puts because of very legal pumps
why tf is vxx dumping with spy
it's obvious to me now that whatever i think is the obvious play means it is too obvious thus i should obviously do the reverse

Bull flag 🇺🇸
I imagine KY enjoys having an outsized control over US politics

i don't understand how options work but what would happen if things went the other way? does the account go into a deficit of 380k?
LIMIT BUY UVXY AT $19.40 and take a ride with me brothers
Just go to sleep, it will keep going up.
We will get Florida and if Biden wins then it's gg
[deleted]
Same
Bruh, I meant relative to other states.
This option has an open interest of 302 with a bid of 1.41 with 200-ish size, I put in two bids at 1.45 and the bids suddenly became 1.45 with 232 size lol
Raise your hand if you sold your puts at the very top.

Now ask yourself; why would you do that? Do you hate money?

biden but i don't feel confident enough to put money on it

im in harris county (HTX) and we had huge early voter turnout
VIX up, VXX down

Haha fuck my ass
Trump losing bigly
[removed]
Leaves order at market, price gaps higher and order isn't filled

Leaves order 10% below market to catch the dip, price dives lower and immediately holding at a loss

.........
Market is rallying to create the perfect short selling opportunity lol- remember you can make money on both movements.

Regardless of election outcome, SPY is likely going to fall. It makes perfect sense to get it nice and fat and juicy before this afternoon/evening.
I’m buying a Border Collie next week, I’m going to name him/her Nio
Slightly green on optimism. Red on Wednesday if we get no clear winner.
The best icing on the 2020 cake would be if the election was contested between kayne and jojo
Should've bought leaps some of my $20 strike Jan 21 calls went x8 from $2 to $16 a contract, this was back when NIO was 14-16
That's actually super interesting. Instead of reading about the election, I shall learn about old gasoline pumps today.
[deleted]
Oooo this is definitely one I’ll want to watch. A bank down since the virus? Especially Citibank
if we break 336.5 then 335.5 here we could push down to 333.5 and then consolidate at open levels for a bit probably before there is another large move
It’s to kill your calls
AAPL dumplings
VIX never fails to disappoint.
Hoping for it to break into the 12's today
Wow..... thanks bro.
NIO $40 by friday.
Lol at the market baiting everyone in to buy equities since open just to pull the fat rug underneath everyone for the rest of the day
That's a heavy statement. Did you at least position yourself in case (even a small position or hedge)?
[removed]
I bought mine Thursday afternoon, and surprisingly they are only down about 30%.
Finally green again after 40% loss in beginning of September. Almost all realized. Feels good bros
Lmao did they get the homie firstsquawk?
felt very long for me. especially the summer
I don't have the answer if it will drop or rally but I know within 15 days will be huge news/event to move the markets.

I know this because I have done my DD and if I show you the way I do it, it won't really benefit me anymore will it?

But lets just say this, I want you to look at the expirations of options of 15-18 days from today..

What do you notice if you look at all the strikes? It's not fun, but you should see it.

Tell me if you see it.
Lol this pump is so fake and gay
[deleted]
SPY and VXX both dumping ?
yeah ww3 is still like 6 years away
bro we all are! IV is insane atm.. theta/gamma cucking all of us!
Imagine stocking up for something that won’t happen,
That’s actually dope
Couldn’t check the market until now. Wtf is going on? Why bigly green??
This is an option pricing bot. The latest option price is:

SPY   400.0|0.17|0.18|0.18|0.04|22.95%


SPY 400.0C 2020-12-18 was mentioned 6 times

Why is vxx not reacting to this spy dip
Biden is old school big business. He'll win and it's all goin UP!
Aside from being a fucking slug, Cheeturd is wildly unpredictable and the big money gets uncomfortable. Remember the China embargo? Yah. He's gone and we can all get back to gambling
Second and short, they go no huddle. Quick snap, and here's VIX on the keeper right side and he'll get enough to move the chains
This year went by so fast.
Possible outcome: Trump, Pence, chuck grassley, and Mike Pompeo all flee to China to avoid prosecution after  election.

By 25th amendment, this makes Pelosi president and Mnuchin VP

Over lame duck session they bond and release a giant stimmy

SPY 400c 12/18
IV crash scheduled for tomorrow. Think of it like earnings day for SPY.

VIX will drop like a rock even if we have a red day just like it mooned during green days in the last month.
My prediction was 35 eoy idek anymore
So I’m down by I would say a lot. diamond hands?
Having a statement such as "Seeing how carnival used to be 50$ a share and now it's fighting between 10 - 13$ a share" invalidates every single argument you could have made. New information, new price
If somehow we finish even I would be happy as a bear

Trump is good for stonks

If you think Americans are going to make the right decision today, I simply ask you to think back to 2002, when Americans cast their votes and chose to crown Kelly Clarkson over my boy Justin Guarini.

😤
What part of sell the news don't you understand? Smart money buys in early, hypes the stock, ER beat then use superior trade execution times to dump at pre-market/opening. Little guy as usual left holding the bag.
This is the dip you’ve been waiting for. 

Don’t be stupid, buy it !

I went in on weed also. Should be interesting. Will make for a fun night.
Yoo wtf is going on?! I need this bitch to gap up ASAP.
I’m genuinely curious as to why people vote for 3rd party candidates that are guaranteed to lose. I get it, you should vote for who you think is best, but in reality we know it’s just throwing your vote away

All above ask
This is like the Super Bowl on steroids
Nio is retarded
it was only a matter of time
I also felt like it but my fomo is getting strong hahaha I like crm and baba a lot more then aapl to be honest. Nee is the only solar stock I would feel comfortable holding and I don’t know much about arry cause they are new right? U planning on sitting out until tomorrow on options?
Do you use whether the first ten minutes are red/green as an inverse indicator for what will happen for the first few hours? The entire time I’ve being watching aapl, until around noon is always an inverse of those first ten minutes
You’re a pardon turkey then 🤡
To everyone who wants the original polygon look: You'll get it.

It's too expensive to shape the type of stainless steel they're using into anything remotely similar to the renders in the article. Would easily add 50% to the sticker price.

Nio is a safe haven
lol these mother fuckers are trying to create buyer power so they can unload. literal definition of scum bags
SNAP DYING
Wow, most of the tickers I track are up 2-5%+ today. If I wasn't a scared lil bitch,  I would have grabbed Calls.

Someone told me, idk if I’m allowed to say tho
The mechanisms of the economy were broken in 2008. They aren't necessarily broken now just hitting the e-brake

If Biden wins Florida tonight, which should report results quickly, he’s almost guaranteed the win. If Trump wins it, the race is still on

My dogs provide a better signal, they somehow can pick up on CNBC analyst shittalkers and pick up subtle cues indicating bear or bull EOD by the speed of the tail wags or just straight up tail not wagging.
NIO just gave us a preview of what the new floor is gonna look like shortly. So excited.
Watched weed drill, then bought more. Muahahha...ha.
Interesting and I think this scenario makes the most sense although obviously who knows...

Tesla Jan 2023 spreads and let it sit. Could go for like a 500/600 spread or something lower. 

Tesla’s growth and release of autonomous driving over the next few years should easily drive this to the break even point on this
I've tried that a lot. Maybe this time it'll work. I know I can 10x this time.
When the stock market is lower on Oct 31 than it was on July 31st, statistically the incumbent loses.

i've been there brother. firsts are so tough becuause its tough to imagine the future or anything past the shitty moment you're in. best thing i can say & advice I can give  is just take this time to work on yourself and be the best version of you. use it as motivation to become a better person. it's alright to take some time and be sad, but make sure you're surrounding yourself with people that are supportive of you and push you to get out of your comfort zone. break ups are hard - but in the long term you'll be glad you went through them because they do make you stronger. find some hobbies, get yourself active, make sure you're working out everyday and releasing those endorphins. all that little stuff helps. also, you're probably super fucking young and have your entire life ahead of you. i'm 32, single and loving my life right now. don't sell yourself short or worry about some girl. keep crushing it and lets get this moneeeeeeeeeeey

Kill what homie my options are up 400%
Everybody’s is this year
And BEER you fool!
There may be some wiggling at close today but everything's on the rise and the future looks bright.
Amd/NIO/TSLA/c/m/spy/apple.   Mostly calls, sold some puts that are all green.
Haha the first time I bought a put was at the bottom in March
That Amazon consolidation tho.
Yeah its *theoretically* possible but most 21 year olds dont or cant do that either due to living in high COL, or even areas where the minimum wage is still 7.25 an hour, having to pay for unforseen life expenses, paying for college or being irresponsible with money due to age. Also gotta factor in that a lot of highschoolers can't have a job due to grades or simply because their parents won't let them, and even among those that do get jobs many will receive less than 20 hours a week.

16k in savings is definitely [not the average savings for the 18-24 age group](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/09/14/how-much-money-the-average-millennial-has-in-savings.html) most have less than 1k in their bank accounts so average savings for a 21 year old is sub 1k. We'd be living in an entirely different world right now where socialized medicine and hiking the min wage wouldn't even be a debate if your average 21 yo had 16k laying around. That would be more than enough to cover most medical copays and set you up to have a good future at a young age if you invest that properly.

Basic republican tactics
Which color Lambo are you getting?
But is GOOGL that big of a company? As in Standard Oil big? I know they can't be compared, but on the basis of market capitalisation I guess GOOGL/Alphabet really is huge. AAPL on the other hand tho can be favourably compared to those Industrial Revolution mammoths.
yhahafsasfgsgaahaah this market is not even manipulated. its controlled.
Market is soaring yesterday and today because it knows the candidate proposing an increase in the federal corporate income tax from 21% to 28% is going to lose. 😉
If you haven't placed your bets yet you're already too late and there will be a lot of fomo
Yeah maybe or it could be like Tesla and just keep going. China market is way bigger than USA and Tesla is 10x Nio’s market-cap currently
Ok so 10% of income in to snp index funds ? That’s some bitch theta shit we are here to try to time the market my friend

I could get behind the others, but MSFT 160??

So the opposite will happen ? Fuck JP.
That's what I've been saying.
What are the odds he got I wonder
dumbest thing i've ever heard
VIX gaining momentum
Remember PRPL? Earnings upcoming $$$$
Laughs in Europoor to the fact that the US is completely oblivious to the impending Covid tidal wave that is about to crash on them

Hell only comes twice
God I hope so. I've been diamond handing and averaging down my leaps for a month.

For the bottom to confirm and not bounce straight back to where it came from lmao
MM pump and dump
Bro go back to PersonalFinanceCanada
Elections are bullish as fuck. Anyone who thought otherwise must have forgot about April through August when record unemployment, lockdowns, rising covid cases, and all sorts of similar things were also bullish as fuck.
Make VIX straight again
Same
I'm going to try to guess the outcome of the election by watching futures, not watching news or looking at social media.
let’s say election results decided today. if i have january calls, will the drop in vix hurt them a lot? or should i just keep holding them?
Ew, big text attention seeker

hey, so are you normally this much of a retard?
He probably only had one or two changes of clothes.
500 shares at 19. Have a little over 10k in NVDA now. I think I want the slightest dip and I’ll roll that into NIO. But if this bitch is going to $40-$50 and beyond. What’s the difference between a few bucks.

Puts on ATVI. Shit is sputtering even when the chasdaq is up 2% insta red when profit taking happens
72% of people who voted in 2016 have already voted by yesterday. Don’t know what that dude is talking about.

Wait for elections. I’d sell half and roll that if Joe wins or sell half and keep that cash for Donnie.

New Zealand should have the results already. Wtf. Why has no one broken the story yet? Theta gang cucks us again.
Look at this fat cat just spending pennies left and right.
And there's Michael VIX, with a helmet on, jogging onto the field and he's coming back into this ballgame!
I’ve been wanting to fuck up a Baskin Robbins for months.
Neither Trump nor Biden are conceding. I think VIX tanks by early Wednesday on polling results. Then as this reality settles in it will spike again.
Shit imagine going back in time with a Tesla. Henry Ford will have a fucking heart attack and the US government will think it’s alien technology.

I'm just asking because I personally feel like it's a pretty tough prediction to make, especially this election. I have a gut feeling you're right but I'm just wondering?
Haha, from Sentimenttrader on twitter: 

> Lotsa optimism with nearly 90% of volume flowing into advancing securities on the NYSE today.

> There have only been 3 election days that enjoyed more than 75% up volume. They didn't last, FWIW.

there 1 white guy, and one orange, who did you vote ?
Funny how this is upvoted now, but WSB was 100% certain over the weekend that there will be total chaos this week, resulting in huge market losses.
I sold too early. NIO is a great November tendie maker.
I'd be surprised if I went back to the office at any time in 2021 at this rate.
It probably will imo, dip after earnings
We only riot when our team wins sports championships
FUCK why did I do spreads on ANET🤡🤡🤡 I closed so many fucking short legs on the dip but thought to myself "eh no way it will go through $230 I'll just keep it" DOPE I'm a sucker
People commenting they are glad their put orders did not fill.

Do you just place orders and go back to touching yourself?   
Doesn't your phone/webapp notify of orders being filled?  
Don't you know you can move closer to ask end of spread and your orders have higher chace to fill?  
And SPY has 1 cent bid-ask spread, how cheap are you that unwilling to pay one cent more to fill your put orders.

I bought spy puts for the first time in my life yesterday. You all are very welcome.

Whoa, whoa whoa, Ms. Lippy! The part of the story I don't like is that the little boy gave up looking for his puppy after an hour. He didn't put posters up or anything, he just sat on the porch like a goon and waited. That little boy's gotta think 'You got a pet. You got a responsibility.' If your dog is lost you don't look for an hour then call it quits? You get your ass out there, and you find that fucking dog!

 **Russia’s “Sausage King” killed with crossbow in his home sauna**

 A Russian oligarch reportedly nicknamed the "Sausage King" was killed with a crossbow in his sauna after masked robbers broke into his home, investigators said Monday. The man and his wife were in their banya — a traditional Russian sauna — outside Moscow when several masked men entered, tied them up and "demanded they give up the money kept in their home," Russia's Investigative Committee said.

Unfortunately, it may all change tonight
I am saying to leave it to the media to assign senseless reasons to every ebb and flow in the market.  Its all just noise.  Like trying to smooth rough waters with a flat iron.
Got in at $26 took profits at $30

got back in at $32 am still pretty happy with NIO 

get back in
Needs 36% to break even. Next year should be a good year as long as interest rates are still low and we have a vaccine

I'll take myself as an example. 

From the end of last year I thought the market was going crazy-bull too hard and I stopped buying shares like I normally did for the past 10+ years. Just sitting on a pile of cash now. It was the crash in March that made me buy just a bit, but I still got some reserve cash because stuff seems crazy this year and I want it to go "back to normal". I also gambled a bit since discovering this sub & learning about options, but I still got a good cash pile waiting for normal responsible investing.
Nice of you to not mention it wasn't positive eod friday
When SPAQ merged and ticker changed to FSR, my cost basis also became zero. Is someone else having the same issue? RH 😖

Fuck man. Hope you hit some big baggers and recover.

Yeah I went from -$10,000 to +$30,000
Within 15 days.. so don't buy puts unless you have them for over 15 days expiration..

I bought two guns during this time. I’m a new gun owner and buying because of the political climate so I fit this plays model but one was a transfer and one was new but I’m buying zero guns in the coming months regardless of what happens.

Next down day I'm definitely selling NIO puts.
There was another market predictor signaling incumbent party win based on where market peaked.

Typically, for an incumbent loss, it peaks in July, but we peaked in September this year
Why wouldn't you?
Best of luck to you man, I am not involved in GME in anyway but hope it works out for y'all!
Yeah don’t see the market dropping 18 points today. Sorry boys Trump another 4 years!
NIO the chosen one!
Trump loss is better for short term vol as he throws the toys out of the pram
Weird math but ok.
I don’t think it’s a bad shares play but that drop was not unseen at all.. I wish I traded options lmao because those puts would have printed.

Who gives a fuck. Biden is a company man anyway so even if he did get elected nothing is really gonna be that different.
lol!  It's a toss up but I don't think I have lost :)
Huh?
Man it hasn't even kicked off yet.  Retail shorts are probably going to start covering soon if we stay up here through close.  Tomorrow could be beast mode

The industrial revolution to me is just like a story I know called The Puppy Who Lost His Way. The world was changing, and the puppy was getting... bigger..... so you see the puppy was like industry, in that they  were both lost in the woods and nobody, especially the little boy "society" knew where to find it. Except that the puppy was a dog, but the industry my friends.... that was a revolution
those clueless people thought it was no big deal and keep buy the dips, they going take another hit when IPO is suspended indefintely or cancelled

The benchmark S&P 500, which has predicted the winner of 87% of all presidential elections and every one since 1984, added 1.2% from July 31 through Monday.

Typically, a gain in the three months leading up to the election has signaled a victory for the incumbent party while a loss signaled a transfer of power.
BUY NIO
Meh, her face kinda looks like the bride of chunky doll lol
Lol yeah ur right and they missed revenue so that’s sucks plus bad guidance

What can I get for a Trump ballot?
Biden win = lots of stimulus
Won’t happen, there isn’t a country that can be a reserve currency compared to us.
Nio honestly....what the fuck
They usually dont let you return pieces of bundles
My 11/20 321p are fucked too. Sorry for your loss.
less than 1k off my all time high.
The market is fake (always has been) and wants to move back to a certain straight line that you can draw onto the logarithmic graph of NDX or SPX since 2009. If it’s above it for too long nobody cares about earnings anymore.
Up 65% this month ty Nio 🙏🏽

Hmm, doesn't look good for the puts

Caveat: One thing to watch out for is a very high voter turnout. That'll tip the scales towards Biden. But it'll be a really huge increase in voter turnout compared to the last 2 presidential elections.
This is my biggest issue for sure. Definitely plan to take a break - it's hard not to take a break when you're brok.e
Glad someone is smart enough to listen to experience these days. I don't make plays without actual testaments from people. Retards these days think their opinion on what direction a stock is gonna go actually matters, when in actuality, the facts of the situation are what do. Thanks for giving me the time of day big man :)

I hate seeing any industry suffer.  My question is, after this pandemic, who wants to go on a cruise and risk being quarantined for a month.  Imagine being locked in a small room with no windows for a month.  A stateroom, may be more bearable but I can barely last in my home for two days.
GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDD YEAR BABY!!!!!! My secret diamond in the rough no one GAF about because it isn't tech.  Just a nice little 500% gain on calls today.  IV and IVP are allllllllways reasonable on GT, and the constant 3-7% swings make it a goldmine for options plays.

Of course it is, eventually.  The biggest IPO in the world was bound to have some regulatory hurdles to clear in a country like China.  Also BABA won’t care when they crush sales on Singles Day next week so it’s still one of the best short term plays available rn imo.

Dude if u think it’s about beating the eps then ur retarded -The company beat estimates on income, but revenue was down compared to the prior-year quarter, and company guidance called for another report of lower revenue in the fourth quarter.

Ah gotcha, thanks!
Just so you know EVs are going up because the Chinese government has a goal if becoming an EV leader which means selling more cars. The way they are doing that is restricting new licenses for gas powered vehicles and making electric vehicles more easy to register. This is why Li Auto and Xpeng are also going up, and why Tesla also had a run up because they operate in China. If anything if this is apart of Chinas 5 year plan then holding for 5 years isn't that bad of an idea.
I have the same number of shares as you do at a slightly worse price (average about 10.40) though I feel like I haven't bought enough and I'm considering taking a bigger position.   I have an IRA with a little over $25k cash and I'm considering going all-in PLTR with that account as well.

Like you, I'm in for the long haul, so I'm not really concerned where it goes after earnings, other than the fact that it might be my last chance to buy at these levels.

Edit:  actually this is not entirely accurate since I picked up half my position by being assigned on puts that I sold.  The premium collected does not reduce my average cost as displayed by IBKR, even though it does for tax purposes.

Just accept that the market is pretty random.  It does not only reflect the value of a company, but also changing perceptions of value, material information, dividend payments, the re-balancing of large positions, the expiration of hedges, accidental large order submissions, sudden spikes triggering chain reactions of stopped out positions, algorithms trading on indicators, market makers remaining delta neutral, insider trading, etc.  Sometimes the market moves up because some whale out there is hedging an even bigger short position.  You never really know

What plays would that be for Trump?  Like Weed and Solar are the top of my head plays for Biden.   I would be slightly concerned about Google, Facebook and Apple with a Biden win simply due to antitrust and possibly a dip in health insurers with possibility of public option.  Struggling to think of specific plays for a Trump win though.

Agree we’re in a downtrend but that can quickly change.  On a technical basis we broke 20 & 50EMAs and there is that 340 which is my stop loss for short positions if it closes above.
There is no bad news that stops this market crazy
NIO wants to break 35
This aged like warm milk!
That’s what I’m saying. People are already calling it a win.....

Man I thought market would dip a bit on Biden winning but instead it's rallying hard on his projected win? Glad my put orders didn't fill I guess.
Lmao 1.6m would be all the seed money I ever need. Taking money from bears makes me smile.
Same  except with futures. Stop 3390
then as you can see they will have bought late

nah. Both are good. TSLA is better.
Yeah, no way you made that much from investing your tutoring money lmfao. High doubts some high schooler who’s brand new to investing pulled that off. 

Also 10-15k is a lot of money *for a highschooler* lol. Especially around the time you would have been in highschool given that you supposedly have a PHD and have been working long enough to land a 7 figure job. A highschooler being able to save that much is pretty impressive and virtually unheard of especially back then. 

Thats a nice bullshit story you’ve created for yourself there.

EDIT: also just FYI, you literally would not be here as a supposed “decamillionaire” with a supposed high profile 7 fig job and no way there’s some secret group of “decamillionaires” wasting their time on WSB of all places.
if we break 338 we go to 340 then most likely see a reversal down to 336.5-335.5
Learn from what went wrong, make plans to never do that again, give yourself credit for being able to take that much of a hit and survive.
No joke, I bought 50 shares this morning to move the price up 15 cents.  Saw all these shitty little orders holding the price down

It's definitely better. SPY broke through its pre covid highs while IWM still hasn't. 

And during the Feb-March crash, IWM dropped 43% while SPY dropped 35%.

SPY, Dow, and NASDAQ are the 3 indexes everyone watches, no one cares about the Russell 2000 so less incentive for them to pump it. To pump SPY, they just need to focus on a handful of stocks.
yeah, so if trump wins florida it pretty much means its over, he just has to snag a few battle grounds.

Why do you think trump is guaranteed to give stimulus? He doesn’t care about citizens and he doesn’t have another election to win. There’s no personal gain for him to do it so why would he? As of right now it makes sense to talk about because he wants to win. I guarantee he drops all talks about it if he wins.

Anyone ever get a cramp in one side of their neck? Like at the front, the muscle just tightens up and your mouth gets pulled down slightly. It usually takes like 20 seconds then it loosens up slowly, but in that time that side of your face from the mouth down gets pulled like you're having a stroke. Anyway last time I smoked some weed I got paranoid "what if I was actually having a stroke all those times and I've actually had like 100 strokes?" and I got all nervous about being severely retarded as a consequence. Then an hour later I was drunk thinking 100 strokes... THAT'S COOL. 100 STROKES AND I'M STILL WALKING.

Look at amazon and JD. Amazon turned green and shot up, JD literally about to go green. BABA is oversold and could hit 300-310 EOD
Is so low lmao
Wrong sub dipshit
The EOD dump, will be quite scary

I ditched your wife last night, because she was hairy

While usually I’m not, scared of the bush

When I dropped her drawers, it smelt like mush
Might sell on the next run up, already at 46% and I’ll just buy back on the pullback
I think the market is pricing in the best parts of a Biden win, Trump win, civil war, alien invasion and plague inc like pandemic. Hence, every freaking thing is mooning.
I was in a rush and set a stop loss of 4.30 for my 4 FB 11/06 270c but accidentally just did a limit order instead and it executed at 4.68. Could have sold 6.50 😭
Ha true I know it’s all about risk here in WSB but even the biggest degen knows not to risk your whole portfolio of 100k on one ticker. This guy doubled his money. The smart thing to do is sell half diversify and he can still retire early if NIO goes to the moon.
Dude, have you not reviewed the DFX threshold yet?  It's showing a PMR double-wide XRT and I'm thinking that with the 4DS hitting a new PDD, that we're looking at a definitive coil-up unwind down to the KKF levels we saw when the CVC hit that point

Nope, that's not why. Trump cannot win the election without Florida.

Biden has at least 4 paths to victory without it.
This shit has to dump. Even the shitty stocks like HYLN are pumping. This is nuts.
Some me just wanna watch the world burn
Can we have an election every day?
But you live in california and you're a cowboy so who really is living in california and who really is electing who in florida
CGC is the one I personally picked

Everyone waiting for a dump is dumb. Not gonna happen.

SPY please stop it! Go down now! 😭😭😭😭
I could not give less of a shit. I’m stating a fact Florida is only of +50 states and providences with electoral votes
Glad someone is smart enough to talk this play down.
so what this pump says about election result
Imagine everyone and their grandma thinks market is going to dump and buys spy puts and vix calls. Who is on the other side of those trades? What do you think they want to happen?
Who won?
Anyone know why GWPH is skyrocketing?!
ICLN up 1.5%.....
Y'all losers who told me to buy Nio AFTER the election, screw you smh
It's almost as bad as Nikola literally fake products with zero patents on anything.
Bots + fools. How else do you create chaos?
When volatility decreases those .05 premiums would be .01.  Not worth the risk and reward.
Now they going back up
So...when is this dumping?
66% voting is over in Florida
Vix will drop on an orderly transition and spike if not.

Doesn’t matter who wins
I nuked my account and turned gay for this? Holy fucking GUH 🤮

HYLN is BOOMING
yes and the point is with him winning it it shows the poooolls were probably wrong. it is the state that turned futures around in 2016
solid earnings, even more solid guidance
I can't see any way where Orange Man comes out and doesn't drop double-birds to America.

If he wins.  Double Birds

If it looks like he's going to lose.  Double Birds

If he loses... you guessed it.  Double Birds.

Yeah, that or earnings.  I'm gonna go with earning pump.

People be like “Trump won in Florida already” is like saying “Hippies live in California”

No shit
EVs in general having a field day. TSLA up 5.75%, NIO up 4.6%, FSR up 3%, HYLN up 12%...

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Those sectors went up 25% in the last week to expect a Biden win. Everyone will buy right back in if Biden is confirmed and the Senate flips
I bought these a couple weeks ago. It's not too late. It's gonna keep going up.
Everyone who bought the "erection bad for stonks" narrative went all cash by eod yesterday. That's why there's no sellers today. All the sellers already went cash and now they're trying to get back in before it's too late.
bingo lol. nah life isn't that bad, it's cool to see that even though we are on the spectrum, we still look out for eachother on here

Grabbed uvxy dip today, looking very 50/50 right now though
He needs a shit load more than Florida to win this election.

Trump **requires** Florida to win. He has basically no path to victory without it.
You're right that it isn't a slim cut but it's definitely snug/fits correctly in key places which partly helps a suit to look good on someone. You're right though, you want a suit that's right for your body type. A slim cut suit is good for thinner/fit people.
Thus rally can’t go into close right?

Dems have more hardline anti-covid policies. Seeing as wave 3 is here and growing (and scaring the markets), hardline lockdown policies from a sweep are alleviating fears

How do vxx calls sound? No matter who wins were bound to see a spike in volatility right ?
He’ll be back on here complaining the robinhood cucks hacked his account and withdrew his money. Amazing how many people won’t enable 2fa
I mean rioting is in response to repression so predicting whether they riot based on the period where they were in control seems like a bad mental model.
Nvm.. we load up on next dip!
As far as I’m concerned, the election is guaranteed to be contested. May not end until next Monday or Tuesday even
It's priced in bro
He probably did have one of the most favorable YouTube algos. I would say it’s more like children/autism money because of his content.
Yeah, but remember what happened after. Shit mooned like mad the day after and kept a continued gradual climb. Just be careful about being too bearish if it happens. Know when to take profits

bro.

the democratic party is borderline neoconservative. and biden is a middle-of-the-road democrat.

the only reason you think they aren't moderate is because republicans have [lurched so far to the right over the last 10-20 years](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/31/the-republican-party-has-lurched-towards-populism-and-illiberalism) that democrats seem extreme by comparison.

Calls if it passes. Puts if it fails.
buy 100 shares of stonk at $10 each.  Sell call to retard at $15 each that expire in a week.  He hands you $20 right away(premium you keep regardless of how it plays out you can buy yourself some coffee with this right away.)  Friday comes and stock is $10.10.  You laugh, he obviously does not buy your shares, and you do it again next week.  It's safer than purely holding shares.  You really can't fuck it up.

That literally doesn’t matter

Mods hate me I think
From my notes on March 5th: market had experienced a 1,000 point rally after Biden became the presumptive nominee and the field threw their support behind him. Market ended up crashing the following week.

IMO today is a relief rally and puts are on sale. We’re still in a pretty significant downtrend. Also don’t think many are considering the possibility of a split White House and senate and what the implications of that would be for stimmy. R/R on DIA/QQQ/IWM puts is good here but I’ll probably wait to see if we get a massive 1,000+ point rally into the close, which feels likely.

It missed by 1%. That’s pretty damn good.
All in on NKLA
The market will never drop ever again
edit: contested election.
If you haven't figured it out yet, the market is pricing in a Trump or a Biden win. Everything is mooning.

I will try to better myself, think about bettering myself instead of thinking of her, it sounds hard but I’ll implement it starting from today and see if I’ll feel better even by a little bit. I don’t know what else to say I just really appreciate you and maybe I’ll message you in the future if you’re interested how I’m doing. Thanks again man. I think that quote will keep me sane for a while.

Everything he said is true, the founding father set it up this way cause the smaller states wouldn't agree to it if they didn't other wise they would just keep getting railroaded by large states. The stupid thing is if it was based on the popular vote the small states would have to start doing positive things to gain voters, but the system is actually set up so they have more power.

I was thinking about writing in “JPOW” I’m sure they’d know I’m talking about Jerome
Yeah... But like, they always go up. My opinion piece for millennials is that Bloomsburg is retarded.
JPOW says that this market needs stimulus. If Biden wins, there will be a BIG stimulus. GREEN DAY
I love the undue optimism on spy.  The only bullish scenario for a large and quick stimulus is Trump with a blue senate and house.  Any other scenario has it pushed out to Feb
gme up 6% but no one says a word
Account less than a year old saying how great this sub was years ago. Then proceeds to shill for Trump... very legit
I'm thinking TLT calls. It's oversold and at the bottom of its bollinger band and support trendline, so even if it doesn't pan out, you'll likely make a little money

Wondering the same, I have 325p expiring Friday. Wasn’t expecting the market to moon today, thought today would be flat then tank tomorrow on election fuckery.
I know I transferred a fresh 10k in just for NIO didn't settle in my account until yesterday was seemed like it was to late so I just let my smaller position ride until about an hour ago. Hoping it dips again.

Sell after the pump declares victory but before Biden is deemed winner. Once the outcome is clear IV crush will get you.
This is absurd. I know this is WSB, but there’s far more evidence that China would benefit from another 4 years of Trump... If Biden is elected expect a coalition of countries battling with China, placing much harder restrictions and sanctions (for various reasons ie human rights violations and Taiwan related issues, things Trump ignored because he was/is a pussy)... Trump thought the US could win a trade war against China alone, which any person who took an economics class from Grand Canyon university could tell you that wouldn’t work.

why bro?
Trap trap
Master degree in CS / PhD statistics drop out

$180k + 20% bonus + \~800k in RSUs over 4 years.
538s been looking at a full dem sweep, House, Senate, and executive. That's just leaves expelling the Supreme Court, and we have a neoliberal America. Call it a neoliberal revolution, let's see how long it lasts

Consider these next four years to be the strongest growth the market will ever see, before we have a great crash due to low IR like Japan and the credit crunch. Then it's just going to be sideways for 29 years
I bought nio 25c 1/15 some time back and I’m up 100%, anyone have any advice should I hold or sell and get a later date
These are unprecedented times. Wouldn't rely on past data, especially when it's at least 4 years old.
It has nothing to do with politics, just probability. Start using reason and rationality and stop letting biases cloud your judgment.
I normally don’t even touch that shit cause I pretend to be ➡️🐂but i figured the uncertainty around this election would make the market piss it’s pants.

SPY, go to 330 where you belong. Don’t act uppity
All I see is testing of 338
Wait for a confirmation first lol
I don’t fuck with this whole “privilege guilt” thing, but how else can you describe that?

You’re bitching about things being stressful at home, while there like 12 bloody revolutions and 2 genocides in the last 15 years before 2016.   

There are actually less military conflicts worldwide now.

If this was the 90s, I’d just tell you “suck it up, pansy”
You’re right, but I was trying to understand why. I just don’t see them prospering like everyone thinks they will.
Time for bed Elon
it's the right call. i finally have clairvoyance because i'm all in on puts
Shaking out the weak hands
Do I take the 60% loss on my SPY 330 11/4s? Roll them out? Fuckin hell should’ve stayed cash yesterday
[deleted]
Lmao
no fucking way this holds tomorrow right? I mean look at this shit country
Remember.......approximately 50% of every one will be disappointed with the election outcome.  Today everyone is betting on their guy.
How ya holding up?
TAN looks like it’s ready to jump off a cliff.
While he wears an oversized blazer sitting at a faux mahogany desk.
That’s the little hack to get most of your profit back without using a day trade
338 is top for today
BOMB 💣
In the food stamp line
NO matter who wins, we were all here together. Dealing money in the party of bets
Cognitive bias
It is. I don't know anyone who thinks that, so, terrible strawman.

What they DO believe is that he's corrupt as fuck and will tank the markets if someone pays him to do it.
$FSR shares
Same. This makes no sense
Which retard is downvoting any new comment? Gotta be a gay bear.
Jack Ma got caught in a sex scandal with 5 Taiwanese lads
Sir, this is 2020.

last chance to buy calls before 338 smashed through
Yah December VXX $24c
BABA volume crazy today
i wanna buy SEDG calls but mango win is probs gonna tank it even more smh
It could work out still
There are no exit polls.
r/investing and r/stocks are for that. WSB is for yolo tesla calls, Elon memes and loss porn
He’s probably dead
NIO NIO NIO MOON MOON MOON
For when stocks go down, but we know that never happens so dw about it.
Thank you for your sacrifice.
Is this in response to the terror attacks on vienna? Or US election concerns?

This is some SoftBank shit right here.
Yes! 

I have traded JPM between 95 and 105 so many times already.  This has been a very reliable trade.

Banks are going up because rates have been creeping up.
Kevin Durant, Kyrie though... Not a bad bet, followed. BOL!
CLCT carrying my account right now
If you are buying calls up 2% intraday the day before an election and possible civil war , you are going full r word
being doing so allll  morning..  took a few k profit already going to let the rest ride..  (at least until tomorrow night..  lol

Weed stocks dumping but I’m holding strong
You're probably right, but your question was how they benefit under Joe. There are reasons they also wouldn't benefit.
Lmao just cause the gay bears are being sad in silence and not posting does not mean this sub is all bullish
The words you utter are treasonous
Hmm...today's rally is kinda sus
this is a company that doesn't know how to make profit or scale the business and they depend on gov a lot
I’m thinking of going cash. 

But I’m also really stupid.
Hold?
lol
When you accidentally buy a call instead of selling a call 🤦🏽
Voter turn out is looking pathetic in almost every state. Dems numbers looking horrible all over the country

It's hard but honestly life is hard. It's a bitch being alive. It's so hard. The least you could do is be on your own side. Think about if you spend even half the time you spent thinking about her, thinking about yourself. You'd be leaps and bounds ahead in your personal development. I promise you it is really hard not to love people that are really in love with themselves - and prove it every day. 

When you respect yourself your energy your effort and your (VERY LIMITED INCREDIBLY LIMITED) time on this planet everyone can see it and everyone can feel it - and better than that the people that make their way into your life from that point forward will have the same deep respect and admiration for you that you have for yourself. You are inexhaustible - you need more money? You can work. You want to be in better shape? You can work. You want to see the world? You can travel. That level of self love and self respect is infectious. Every single good thing in your life comes from you and your effort. Good luck figuring it out bud i've been there and I'm telling you where I'm standing is infinitely better than where I was (now the girl in my scenario has wanted to claw her way back into my life - the other nice thing is once you develop that self love and self respect you won't even have a real romantic interest about anyone that doesn't feel that same deep enthusiasm for you every second of every day, the same way you do)

Tough love: suck it up, find things you love and attack those. Simple things- morning coffee, park walks with your kid, swimming- whatever. Stop looking at everything negatively, It’s literally all in your head. And, seek professional help. Nothing wrong with that.
go long on baba if biden elect
Imagine investing in anything that trades on the Shanghai stock exchange smh
Based on what?

I am such an idiot for buying Puts this week. 
SPY Jan 330p

no, more calls
Literally none
If you were bullish on the worst case election scenario why did you even move to cash in the first place?
I feel offended
Gunsmith here. This play won't float, guns and parts are on back order for months, and all of the sales that are being done right now are not retail, but transfers rather, because guns are not on a lot of shelves at this time.

Uvxy seems like a good trade so it’s probably not
BK soon? Worked for HTZ
Bc it’s already had a big run up
Yep, puts are pretty brutal in that aspect. The price of some assests may never return to that level lol.
there is no civil war. Biden will declare victory tonight. thats what markets are telling y'all

Tell my why i dont sell nio 35c, and use the premium to buy 38c, both weekly
The inevitable dump is coming

Hold on to your butts
Ah, a certified retard. Welcome home
Someone please explain this stock to me.  Priced way below its moving average, killed earnings, going to crush Q3 earnings.....WTF!!?
I hope those retards who dumped NIO at open causing it to go from +3% Premarket to -1% are crying.
I win with puts but also calls

Y’all see what I’m seeing right? Here comes the drop. 🐻🍷
Just a couple days ago on Sunday evening, futures opened down -1% and bears were celebrating victory. Now they are all in ruins.
When was the last time you cleaned your phone-screen you dirty fuck?
Hey man thanks for taking the time to respond to me with good advices I appreciate it.

We’ve been dating for a 2 years she was my first with everything, I guess that’s a major reason why I’m so attached and this miserable. Towards 4-6 months ago it started getting really toxic. And we ended things very recently on a bad note. It was just two weeks ago since we’ve been apart. And it feels like hell honestly, everyday is just so hard and feels like whatever I do doesn’t help.
I don't know much 'bout votin' or the politics but I do know this...

BEAR...

FUK.
It costs $100 to reserve a Tesla
It’s a baseball reference. It just means this is the final chance for him and he could either strike out or win the game.
Buy puts. Any person who thinks puts are a good idea should buy them.
Always
Why the fuck did I sell my NIO calls for +130%
Calls on people being BIG mad tonight
better faster stronger cheaper
yeah but im really fuckin stupid
Call Leaps or monthly puts
Dude the beautiful thing about the market is that it's always there waiting for you to make another play

Just stop betting on weeklies and start dying diagonals or at least itm debit spreads, way higher chances than just plain old weeklies

Stop playing at the casino and start being the fucking casino
NIO too big to fail?

Fine. Calls on VXX

If I sell ITM they’ll hopefully get called away and I break even, but for the rest of you guys, buy the dip now and ride with me or do the smart thing and load up on puts
Is it time for SPY puts?
If you riot today please don't touch gamestop, I don't want to be bagholding any longer
I have 4K to spend what do I YOLO ?
The worst part about being a 🌈 🐻 is that when you’re wrong you can’t even buy the dip
I hear that. That is a little bit too much sanity though...
Should I sell my SPXS $6 calls 11/20
NIO long??
Y’all holding calls through the election?
No
do it
That’s me with spy 450c
They’re $40 and not sure about expiration because they’re LEAPS
I lose a grand to that stupid makeup company I hope you make money because I’m not a sour bitch about it
My fomo is kicking in. I feel bad about buying calls on a very green day.
man if i'm smart i would sell some GME calls today huh.

too bad my share avg is like ~12

12.5c for Fri is going for .8 to .9 tho hmm

(edit: i'm retarded those are 11/20s heh)
Lol. Retarded market. Rip puts
Fuck off

You are mentally capacitated if you didn’t buy the PayPal dip

Warning for fellow autists stay away from atvi. Today confirms the crazy sell pressure from Institutions that own 93% of the company. Even as other gaming companies are mooning this shit is stuck. Confirms buy puts for this shit company

just hold. Today is MM just fucking over peoples short positions and puts.

Mango and Sleepy are going to both contest the election even if one of them wins by a wideish margin. Only way that doesnt happen is if it is a completer landslide and even then one may not concede
Jesus, 290 lol. If that were even remotely true, the dollar wouldn’t have broken down literally on the day of the election. TLT as well. Stimulus getting priced in

For the second fat pump?
I know it’s all fun and games but this is clearly a fake pump... it’s a bottom 9th with full count for mango
MODS: Can we ban the word "imagine"?

Jan 22nd
Oooooooooo..... weeeeeee..... !!
Today will be mostly republican voters, so keep that in mind when reading exit polls

If exit polling is showing a narrow trump lead or a biden lead, that means its going to be a biden blowout.
I bought a 43C for May a couple weeks back. At the rate it's going it may print by the end of the year
Stock moves $0.5, “we taking the elevator up”, “we mooning”, “next stop ATH”, seriously can we please ban al of these 10 year olds!? 😒😒😒
Seems like a pretty dumb rally at this point considering what’s about to happen. It also seems that both trump and Biden trades are going up. Long yields also going up a shit ton, this should not be good for stocks especially the growthy names 😳
NIO 35.50 eod
Bro, he’s literally only 3 years older than Trump lol I know y’all are shit with numbers but 3 isn’t a lot.
Your flair has to be the funniest shit I've seen this week.
They care about dick size.  Unless the girls at Pornhub are full of crap.
So half this sub was wiped out when they had calls and we dipped for a few days. Then they switched to puts for this week and the market is up like this. 

Love y’all but LMAO
Happy to help
[deleted]
Thanks, done.
Why would the markets be up on the prospect of Trump as president with likely Dem control of Congress? A unified dem control scenario = big stimulus and right now the polls show that is the most likely outcome.

I am not saying it will happen but algos run on probabilities.
I think so. I've got $40c 12/4
UPS has a tasty gap to fill and looks like it broke out of its post-earnings slam jammer
confident
SPY double top !! Free falling
Everyone gets a trophy!
Safe to hold Spy overnight ??
TSLA order book super lopsided yet it continues to pump. Amazing
My FDs didn’t go to 0 I’m amazed
Cringe
It doesn’t move as aggressively as TAN plus with SEDG tanking tan I feel like it’s oversold to hell right now. I DO have 4/2021 $30 ICLN leaps already tho
my funds are on hold til tomorrow. Maybe for good reason.

CASH GANG.
If nothing is concrete yet, why the fuck are you making concrete statements?
Trump really called that rapper little pimp lol
Perfect, thanks didnt think of that
Bears please don’t be delusional we’ve quite clearly broken that downward trend, we might get a red day or too but don’t go full send on puts, be nimble here
anyone playing QCOM ER ?
Market news for 11/3:

Stonks rise on hope of hope
gme 13 eow please let me fucking win for once
Imagine if cash gang right now hopes for a landslide win, expecting for another decisive bull run to begin tomorrow, only to get a rug pull for an unknown reason.

I am part of cash gang.
Lol people shouting incoming dump ... This pump train ain't stopping soon
Sounds ominous
I would have made the same call. Don't listen to these retards they put all their money into SPY puts and SQQQ calls. Seeing how carnival used to be 50$ a share and now it's fighting between 10 - 13$ a share. If you kept up with cruise line news also the CDC is allowing cruises once the ban is lifted, but most won't start till the beginning of next year according to a few articles I've read. Carnival and RCL being the two that stated this.
Market is super green today, pulling everything up with it.
Whats funny is no one knows why the fuck this market is going up right now:

"Clearly the market pricing in a Trump victory, the market may never go down again"

"This is definitely the market factoring in a Biden win followed by an immediate stimulus"
buy order comes in above my limit sell. my order doesn't fill. i'm stuck holding. thanks, fidelity.
In awhile
Ok so I need some more cash my account is like all nio shares. I’m retarded
Awe that's cute.

Balls the size of Brazilian booty. Congrats man.
One fat pump and you guys getting carried away lmao. Election hasn’t even happened yet just wait.
dude tsla is literally death. IV is too high
no wonder we're mooning
This is the way
too late i have paper hands and they're only monthlies. if they were leaps (which i dont have the capital for) i would hold until 530-540 but alas.
I think I’m on the wrong sub for this kind of talk
How are the bears feeling?
What was the outcomes of that? Repealing Glass-Stegal didn’t crash the world economy

Sixty million is nowhere near enough money to know what's going on.

If you mean oil and gas, people will nationally be encouraged to wear masks and socially distance, virus will reduce in prevalence enabling more reopening, more cars on the road for going places, more oil consumption.
If this bitch has the nerve to touch 340 before the most highly contested election of all time...well then, I’m all the fuck in on puts
Top US Generals held a video call with news anchors this weekend assuring them the military will play no role in the election.

 VXX calls in shambles :(
I didn't realize national sandwich day would be such a big catalyst for the markets. I'm marking November 3rd on my calendar for next year.
especially with their earnings release on 11/17!
We have the House of Representatives which is supposed to work the same way but there are still mostly two parties bc independents get crushed and the only thing one party hates more than the other is a third party
I should not be making money rn lol
Seriously what happened to BABA?
As an American I don’t like the two party system, we have more you can vote for but they get like 3% of the vote each year. 

I’m somewhere between libertarian and conservative, just small government minded outside of green issues and road building etc. The Libertarian party always just seems so edgy and until this year they just can’t seem to put a palatable candidate up on the ballot and never get enough support to get into one of the debates.

I don’t get why Libertarians don’t get more support tbh, it’s a “let states figure it out on a smaller level” appeal and Libertarians don’t give a fuck, live your life however you choose, it’s a free country do what you want as long as it doesn’t infringe on others in a meaningful way.
and thats why vix is down 3.5%?
Are you lost?
Facts
number 1. Delete her on all apps. delete her number. make sure you don't have to see her on any type of social media or in person

My biggest regret in life isn’t tucking that really fat chick my junior year of college.

Thank you for this. Up bug this morning.
yea you really suck at this how the HELL do you lose a quarter of a million dollars, man you stupid and need help seriously!
strike and expiration?
[deleted]
💚😂
Here is the deal:

I watched a documentary about what happened to Bill Clinton. 

He ran on raising taxes and more regulation. 

On day 1 bankers came in and told him if he doesn't cut wall street regulation and raises taxes economy would tank.

He agreed and never raised taxes. 90's saw huge market gains.
[removed]
Jesus man stop playing weeklies (assuming you bought these recently).

I can't tell you what to do because I would never get myself into this retarded position, so I can't relate. Sorry

Edit: The only thing I can say is IV crush might ruin you even if you're directionally correct. At this point you're betting on a Sleepy win with Mango contesting the election.
That’s a funny play hope you get rich
I don’t care my portfolio

After trump says he won before 60% of the votes are counted, you betcha
Oil/coal/natural gas companies get subsidies from the federal government to bolster profit and stabilize energy prices. Presumably under blue government that money would start going to wind, solar, etc
if trump does lose he's going to do his best to tank the market.

Dude is a vindictive SOB and he'll say "I told you so"

Bears dream is Biden win and republican congress. In this scenario there’s almost no chance of a big fiscal stimulus. Thats what matters most in the short term imo
Volume predictably low today.

People ain't tryna get fucked by weird shit happening today
20k volume on 1dte 351c's

But why male models
You need to sell calls if you have shares as collateral. You sell puts when you have cash as collateral.
At least 4 years lol
Do you already have a pending order?
Haha all good signs of a good trader (joking). Good luck though, these fuckers will be really nice to you when you're up but as soon as you're down and under they'll come out and attack. So definitely play it smart
338 top?
As a real black man (TM) on Reddit, I approve this message.

Almost a $1 move in less than two minutes. It feels like this house of cards is primed to come crashing down if any downward momentum picks up.
Would all option value drop after the election due to IV?

It’s been a 2 weeks and I’ve just been going to the gym making healthy decisions and just trying everything to be better, including hanging out with other potential female partners. I just feel like it doesn’t help a damn thing. I’m constantly just thinking of her and damn is it hard to get over. All I do is think of her even when I don’t want to, like days become miserable and I wake up being miserable. 

I feel like I just need more time and it will heal, but thanks for your advices and I will implement some in some way or another.

Bears shoulda listened to Cramer
Easier to make sure the system is kept the same if you have only 2 differing options to pick from. The status quo/"the system" is never vulnerable to radical change.
Selling your orders isn't illegal, loads of brokers do it.  Front running those orders is the no no.

Still convinced it’s just a bull trap. The real show starts tonight.
Current share ownership means nothing when obligating yourself to buy more shares
🤣🤣🤣
Oh please. So if I gave 99 wall street bets users and 1 Stanley Druckenmiller each 1 million dollars and 5 years there is only a 1% chance he would perform the best? And a 1% chance he would perform the worst? Just because there is some chance involved doesn't mean luck is "the only" or even the the most important contributing factor to success. I guess its comforting for people who fail to believe people who win were just "lucky".
That was my position.  It would take a meteor to bring it back down at this point  to where I was.
Florida tags. Green paint. Fitting.
I've had to adjust and tighten my naked /RTY strangle to keep from giving up credit so many times that I need the IV crush from fucking hell tonight.

Why is solar going down? Why is oil going up?
Strong resistance at SPY 338. I think it will break through though.
Either when it's obvious that Trump lost, or if Trump wins through ratfucking, there must be some shit. Whether markets care is another question.
No I was amazed it dropped below 400 so I picked the closest to money strike I could. 

For my strategy I need it low to sell covered calls against it on days like today

Can't wait to watch the market crash over the next few months after I switch all my puts to calls.
Yes. When Trump wins, various D-heavy cities (think NY, DC at least) will have idiot Biden supporters rioting. 

Then it is up to the local governors if they allow them to rampage or call in the national guard to bag them.

Note how the cities where streets are getting boarded up are all Democratic strongholds. They have very few Trump supporters, so they are not afraid of those somehow rioting over Trump losing...
if this isn't copy pasta or turned into copypasta that spreads all over reddit, i'm going to cry.

It's like this. There are 2 worlds. 

1. The commoners that protest or riot; being angry about stimulus checks and threatening war if their man loses today. 

2. The upper-class people with money; investors. Rich people, or at least people who's income aren't impacted by covid. They just keep working from home gambling on the stock market; sometimes checking up on social media watching everyone else insult each other.

World_1 is definitely going to see some chaos tonight. 

World_2 is just chillin' trying to decide to buy the dip or short the market. They probably went to the store yesterday and again today to stock up on some stuff. Never forget Ron Whitey of Futurama:
> _"Now, my caddie's chauffeur informs me that a bank is a place where people put money that isn't properly invested."_

Investors are buying because they're becoming more & more confident in the outcome of this election and being all-cash is blasphemy to these people.

Anyways, I can't wait to see how this sub goes this evening. Stay safe.
He introduced him as “Little Pimp” too lmao
Take Musk, go to space. Bezos is stuck suborbital and neither Billy nor Zuckbot have space programs.

Oh yes, doubling down on SPY Puts.

See you morons on Friday 😁
I wonder if people are selling puts (were selling puts into this decline).  How do the MM make money if they have to create a market?
I agree. But also a teenie bit of biden vs trump
Yeah no matter what the polls say Trump is gonna declare himself the winner, then even if Biden is the clear winner Trump and co will pull out every trick in the book to try to steal it. Meanwhile Trump army will be in the streets wreaking havoc.
No way either of those two are getting it up without a little (read: a lot) of help. Calls on Cialis.

Nobody cares.
Other countries do democracy better than the US.
Wtf was that big red candle that made SPY drop $0.8 under a min?
You can't sell puts against shares that you own because a put is a promise to buy more shares at a specific price. You need to have the cash on hand to buy those shares if the put is exercised.

If you want to sell a put, you can cover it with a short position of -100 shares.
fuck it went back up
They have one of the largest cloud services?

Sold my SPWR/PLUG calls this morning for 60% gains and rolled them into an 11/20 SEDG debit call spread ATM.  I figure it will recover from this drop after earnings--especially if Biden wins.
What do you do for $50k a month...
Heeeellll no.
lil Pimp
L M A O gay bears
If you look at P/C ratio and volume, seems everyone put a collar on their stocks. Gamma squeeze up (fucks over anyone who sold call and bought put). At the spikes, you can see the options exercising (100 shares at a time fills). People aren't buying, its dealers who are just fucking over option holders.
Your welcome. Besides paying taxes, some Americans are also in Europe keeping you safe.
WTF paypal lmao
i mean that's only 30 blowjobs a day, if you're good enough that's 3 hours of work
ALRIGHT THEN... i won’t and no one will know about it
They didn't cut it. The yield is what matters. Obviously the notional amount changed due to the split.

Everything green except PTON, goddamn it
I think it's between Trump going crazy on Twitter or not
This shit is about to fucking rip tomorrow
Does Walmart and target have AWS printing money for them? ? Or diversified into other segments like a streaming platform (twitch) or sophisticated AI/delivery for easier management of inventories ?

I was just noting the difference between cost and price is all.
My best guess is that we had an open gap down from 338 to 332 on SPY that got filled violently

Someone flair this man
You are all actual clowns If you buy puts for tomorrow.
Bought in, figure its a good opp!
You realize there's someone on each side of every trade, right?
Buying frenzy. Doesn't matter what it is at this point, straight to the moon no stops
You can only sell calls using shares as collateral, have to have cash to sell puts. 

Retard.
Oh by a large margin
I’ve definitely considered a few downsides. But if you look at past earnings, they did amazing in their “worst” case scenario at the peak of the hoarding in march. They even had to shut the factory down for a corona outbreak during last quarter and still beat earning crazy. Makes me believe this quarter will knock out the park. They have a broad spectrum of brands from bow and arrow to hunting gear. I would definitely not put up this much $ if i wasn’t confident. I’m more worried about an overall market crash but even that i feel is a low chance with all the fed injections of stability
EM?
Trump had LIL PUMP ON STAGE 

this is peak 2020

Safe play my friend.
Sold my FB calls way too early. Profit is profit though.
America can vote for lots more than 2 people you tard
Do u guys think there are actually gonna be riots 🤔
You belong here
Why are we pumping so hard today of all days?
Gotcha. They are pretty close to ATM so I might just hold unless they pop today

But low sell high
I'll say the same thing I said last time this was posted:

Depends on our Emperors mood at the time
Hope you've all been playing within your personal risk tolerance®️
Yeah the beginning is super super rough. It’s not for everyone, but I often find becoming interested in someone else usually helps me a lot. A little casual dating; the problem is she occupies so much space in your romantic mind and romance in the forefront of your mind rn. 

So, fill that empty space. Even start by just swiping right— it’ll help you realize you can actually do this again. 

You’ll be aight.

Anyone buy some cheap $Baba $305c this AM?
BABA will spike past $300 after earnings

Gg bulls. I sold my ber positions at 9:35 and put it into GameStop
cuz u gey
Betting odds today somewhere between 2/1 and 60/40, significantly tighter than any poll-based predictions
Do I dump my SPY 325p for a fat 50% loss? Bought it expecting lots of civil unrest after the election gets fucky, but now I’m down so much that even if the market dumps I’ll barely profit
It’s not about Trump VS Biden. It’s about contested vs uncontested.

Going by that it would make sense for today to be flat or down and then either pump or tank tomorrow. A lot of states are saying it could take a couple of days to finish counting all of the votes this year and I doubt either candidate is going to concede until literally all of them are counted.
Apps apps apps to the moon
Congrats to whoever bought that PYPL dip. I took profits at +30% damn I shoulda diamond handed that shit
Uh it’s called “buying the dip”
Once news starts flowing in, and shows how close this is gonna be, it’s gonna get reaaaal choppy
lol
Clearly wall street knows result will be clear tonight, it will not be a contested election
More buys than sells
Jesus TSLA and NIO ain’t slowing
i swear this is prob cuz WSB went all in on puts last week
I would. Holding onto my uvxy i got today and im pretty sure they will print.
because america is a one party state with one wing that hates the working class openly and one wing that pretends not to

Wow I didn't think they'd cut it that much

Lowest dividend since 1995

He will do what he has to so he can keep banking those stock options

There is always a reason for breakup and people tend to forget the bad moments. Remember why it didn't work out... and if things will change if you were to date her again. Usually the answer is no

Can anyone actually explain what the hell is happening today? This movement is nuts.
The moving 50 is still below the 200.

SPY $325p 11.20

Good boi
You know it split 4:1 right? As in your 1 share that you got the previous dividend for, you get 4 shares to get 4 of the current dividend.
Is there anything nicer than when all of your calls move ITM simultaneously?
Holy fuck today is annoying. All my trades were green at open and now slowly fading to red
[deleted]
uh... did you hear about the stock split?
We did our part soldiers. let’s go big boys pump this shiiat
What's funny with the USA is I can't tell if this is photoshopped or not.

The big guy taking Florida and Texas is the only way we know the results for sure tonight. It may still happen, but even if it does, half the market will sell off thinking he is bad for economy.
Both
No way we pump into tomorrow right? One side will be pissed with the results of the election
The market is pricing in a Trump landslide
RemindMe! 3 days
Yes
U are a clown
Ur single NIO call making u rich?
Same #feelsbadman
The dip down recently was not fun when your shares are collateral, but as long as you zoom out and look at a calendar no reason to care. Free money.
Bears are dead 🇺🇸
They have to already know he’s winning for it to pump like this
calls
GameStop can’t stop, GameStop won’t stop
how the fuck is amazon a tech company if they sell stuff? Is Walmart & Target also tech company? smh my head
When I try to sell puts on nio it says” you don’t have enough buying power “when I do , and I also own 100 shares. Can someone explain ?
Ok slim jesus
How are we feelin PTON gang 🚲
Calls on you good friend
Pollsters of networks inside battleground states count real votes as they go out showing Trump is winning -> this gets out to their friends in the media & Wallstreet -> SPY is up.
why can america only vote for 2 people lol, in europe we can vote for like 20 different parties and our vote actually matters even if the one we voted for didnt get majority. we have like 400 people controlling and voting for shit and if x party got 10% votes then they get 40 people from their party out of those 400.
Bears realize there same logic now applied in April and March when we had the greatest rally of all time ?
Who the fuck holds vix
Look for oversold stocks from the last few days that will recover after election regardless of who wins.
So this... this... is what hope feels like 🥺🥺🥺

$AAPL’s quarterly dividend is 20.5¢/share. 75% down from last dividend disbursement. Well, at least it’ll cover a little over my quota for the week. Besides, $AAPL is recovering well.
Yeah luckily none of mine expire until next Friday at the earliest. Hopefully the next week is red. Good luck brother 🙏
Same. I think so

Work on yourself. Extend the same consideration you do towards her to yourself. Every second you spend thinking about her is time that would be better spent thinking about yourself. Learn to have a deep love and appreciation for who you are, why you are the way that you are, and be ready to address your shortcomings aggressively. The only way I've found to be happy and satisfied is to develop an aggressive predisposition towards health and healthy choices


That doesn't mean dont drink don't smoke fuck fried foods it means loving and respecting yourself enough to make the decisions that are best for you regardless of how hard or complicated or simple and easy they are. It means drink a beer if you want a beer, appreciate that your ability to move your body and your health in general is a privilege - getting to work out is a privilege, go date 6 girls if you want to date 6 girls, take yourself out to dinner. We might die tomorrow might as well live - and remember you are inexhaustible. Every single good thing in your life comes from you. Fill your cup.
I'm cash. Should I chill for today or get calls or puts?
Trump W
Yep
Staying away from tech

Thanks fr man, everyone’s been saying the same thing even my friends, but shit is just hard, you constantly think of her.
If you’re not buying puts on a plus 2% day what are you even doing
Fck I sold my NIO calls early today.
Hold my VXX and SQQQ calls until tomorrow? They expire on Friday
Mods, we gonna have a discussion thread for tonight?
We're talking cost not price. If it increased the cost (what expenses it takes to manufacture) there would be no benefit to advertising them as features when you could do something else that might be easier or cheaper. If it, however, does, you can then increase the price and margin of profit.
I need MSFT to go up 1 more dollar to break even on the retarded trade from last week. Break even = big time win in my book
Is it going down for wrong reasons? Seems people are buying equities. Doesn't really induce real world inflation. Jerome gonna need to print more money (digitally).

Amazing enough for analysts to upgrade them crazy as well as multiple upward revisions of this quarters EPS and Revenue estimates

Thank you. I will definitely look into it. I’m also considering TAN. I’m going to give myself at least a day to calm down though. I don’t make good decisions when I’m pumped with adrenaline.

Of course, most of us think/know/wonder if its total BS... but still...
It was only really bumpy for two months. Made it all back in two days. Capitalism may be a bitch but she’s a sexy one.
i think trump is a lot better than a retard.

McDonald's started house delivery this month in my country before any lockdowns were imposed. McDonald's NEVER had delivery here. Their drive through has a queue of at least 20-30 cars every night at peak hour. It's insane. It's highly unusual for junk food to be so popular here all of a sudden. Especially McDonald's which is considered seriously bad food here.
Ugh.  Sell my 11/6 SPY Puts right now for a 75% loss or hang on to them as a lottery ticket in the hopes for some market craziness and risk a 100% loss.  Why am I such a pussy?

False, NIO to the moon
You better sell fast bulls
I don't know. Maybe the fact we woke up this morning and people weren't burning down polling places? 

Obviously, the real fear is for after the polling places close. I don't think the fear is totally gone, but the way the market is reacting suggests the fear has been mitigated.
God dam someone ban this asshat

How do I get stop missing my ex, boys I need help
I think this looks like a good play, but you have a "litterally can't go tit's up" additude which makes me weary. 

I have heard that the main reason there have been ammo shortages is because the U.S isn't mining for lead at all right now and there is a global shortage so buying overseas isn't easy either. Adding to that, brass, copper, and even gun powder is in short supply. I would add that prices are likely higher for those raw materials but that wont have an effect on demand because as we've seen people are willing to pay for even the opportunity to purchase ammunition. 

Adding to this, winter is coming. I haven't looked at what exactly this company sells for outdoor gear but assuming it is mostly camping supplies and things that are mainly used during the warmer months sales could take a hit. 

I'm loosing my train of thought, but there's just a few things to consider.

anyone selling SEDG puts?

Because Trump is done
Hm, what [changed in 1920](https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=63)?
They like lying to you
Social Status basically, but all of those things can contribute to social status
Biden is an old man, out of touch with the times, who is losing his mental faculty.  Trump is a fucking retard.
I think so too man

Trump hires terrible advisors  
Trump also ignores all his advisors and does his own thing
My thought exactly, by the looks of it I honestly think insiders know trump wins, so there loading up.
Nothing in particular, haha was just throwing it out there. There had quarterly earnings growth of 246% and I think they will keep going up
SO A LOCKDOWN!!!
I second
That's why the market is going up. If dems take senate and white house we get a monster stimulus and covid gets under control and the economy recovers.
why the heck is SPY up so much today
Who else went cash gang last Friday

Is it too much to ask for?

All I wanted was a little bit of money. I thought pits would be foolproof. No way the market doesn’t go down in the midst of a historically uncertain election right? Wrong. The MMs hate me too much. I don’t know what I did. I just wanna make a couple hundred off some plays here and there. Is it too much to ask the algorithms to maybe stop buying up overvalued stocks for once?
Tweet from Elon a few minutes ago

[Yes, although I didn’t expect the stock to rise so much so soon.....](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1323643630997917697?s=19)

Basically doing "Tesla stock price is too high, IMO" all over again.
Once you buy it will be
Agreed with this. Cost me money to learn today, but I'm done chasing.
Same.... it went down to $2951 yesterday and I set my buy limit at $2950 🤡

I thought it’s gonna go to $2900 today ugh

If I strictly want to bet on the outcome of the election, what are the moves to play?
Classic NIO pump and pump*
meh taking my NVDA monthly gains. 25% is still 25% considering its 10k worth of calls.

i just need amzn to do 5 more 2% days and that Jan call MIGHT be near even!
Holy fuck this Biden rally. I made 7 cents in dividends today. 7 cents!
Nah I bought Friday
It’s going to take weeks regardless
Going to ride the election hype into the money and sell when my dick gets hard .. fuck a recession jpow ain't going no where baby
Went from -70% all time to - 45%
Pump and pump
MM’s were team blue all along?
Enjoy the chicken tendies lad
Yeah but not everyone did
Thank god I sold my VIX calls on Friday
SPY $400 confirmed
What a recovery by PayPal
AAPL 11/27 @120 c, hold or will get fucked?
Still bearish, just moved my puts back to 11/9 and $30 closer. 320 Now I can ride the week in peace . Loss 60% on SPY 290 11/6

yeah that’s what’s so stupid but I guess it’s very legal and cool
dollar dumping
Yeah. So I sell calls and puts at the same time. 

On earnings I closed my short 120 calls for a good profit. My short puts are down but not much now.

I like paying less taxes on gains as well

Cash gang is the winner
I'm getting worried that the Bears might still win. If Trump wins FL, and PA declares absentee ballots need to be counted for the final results, then we will drag this through the week and VIX will come back. Be decisive ppl, break one way or the other!!
News Friday but no insider trading
Because he just got insanely lucky. Chinese companies have a higher risk generally and the recovery play he's looking for or was planning for would generally have given him less returns over 5 years than he just got
It's possible but I don't see it causing a selloff. Not until the first shots of Civil War II are fired anyway
Nice when do you think you will sell? We might be heading into a recession in the next couple years
It’s super green because people are no longer uncertain that the worst case scenario of riots and fuckery will ensue? That is some big brain moves.
Nio expansion will fail
Upvote if you've made money today 🚀🚀
I've bought a couple of suits off the shelf that fit pretty well. Only thing I need to tailor is the sleeve length which really makes them look good, similar to the pants length. Probly not necessary for everyone though

Biden wins we tank cuz Trump will fight it, Trump wins we tank cuz Biden will fight it
Last chance to get out bulls, act wisely. don't fall for the hype
FSLY calls
Zuck came to fuck.
I only see proof that you shouldn't hold cash. The stocks or holding the car would have been the right move.
It doesn’t really matter who wins what matters (in the short term) is whether the election is contested
Vix would sleep. Vix would wake. Vix would walk.
People who post and mock bears or bulls on green or red days are the people with $200 accounts.

Anyone else buying today?
Yeah this is a rip that dump couldn’t even last 15min shit gonna reach 340... I’m mentally challenge and just gonna diamond hand this put to 0%

Ah, well rock chalk ichabods then

Was so much like april. Always inverse. When greed is everywhere and gains porn is spammed left and right. That is when you become a bear.
Yeah exactly like long term I should buy right now right? But like I’m so horny to get that low share price so I might sell puts in the meantime.

Yeah and once I build my porty up I’m gonna use options that INVOLVE shares because theta gang
I know right. And with how fast this pump happened it’s obviously low quality. Holding puts through the week because the real catalysts down haven’t even happened yet
GME gang we out here
Man not trying to be political, all speculation, but if Biden wins im sure going to miss the Trump Market lol, even pre covid everyone was fucking making money, real or not life was good, than buying the dip in march until now. Fuck man it was like a video game
Which one?
That's what I did. Right now going hard into options is going to either wipe you or make you a king. I'll probably get caught bagholding these shares because there will be a random dump soon, but whatever. The money will return as long as I don't go full retard and sell the bottom
Either way stock market hitting all time highs in January.  More stimulus will come.  This last dip has been another great opportunity.

I managed to put together a ton of money in college.  They just give away free money in the financial aid office. 

Now, idk what the difference between a grant and a loan is, and I sure as hell don't know the difference between a secured loan and an unsecured loan, and as far as I remember from high school, interest is a good thing, the banks pay it to you or something, idk, whatever, "Yes, I'll take all the money you offer me"

Fast forward a few years:  "Loan? huh?  PAY BACK? Dafuqyousay? How the hell can I pay that much money back?"

tl;dr if you're just retarded enough, you can convince yourself you have a bunch of money while you're in college.  Even if you just use it all for hotel parties, weed, and liquor.  At least OP considered trying to do something responsible with their ill-gotten gains

I think even just this morning it was +125
Hahaha
Wow mr. market, I thought you were big but not that big 😳😳😳😳
Yeah, I got burned by puts that I bought Friday, so I bought calls near yesterday's bottom.
I’m fine with a flat day tomorrow.
This is the only reason that I don’t completely hate places like “Men’s warehouse”. When I first getting a job it came down to buying a suit at JC Penny and having it tailored to fit (but getting decent materials - not the best) or going to Men’s warehouse and getting a better fitting suit with shittier materials for the same price. At men’s warehouse (and similar stores) they will measure you and they have a massive amount of suits in every size so you can get an almost perfect fitting suit that needs minor modification. Where as at a department store they will measure you and just find the closest fit on the shelf and leave a lot of altercations to the tailor.
You forgot something
Bears talked so much shit this morning. I’m edging this shit till eod then releasing the most disgusting 🥜 ever

no, i know exactly what SPY will do because i have positions on it and it will do whatever is necessary to zero me
My theory: insiders are pricing in a government trifecta (big red wave or big blue wave). If one party controls the house, senate and presidency in an environment with zero inflation pressure, they could moon the economy and stock market.

If no clear winner. Small down. Then big up.

Wtf kind of trading strategy is this?
Please fasten your seatbelts NIO about to moon again
Too bad for you I only have calls.
For sure dude. Keep your gains and don't be dumb trying to do options. I was just saying to buy solar edge since it went down 20% even after bearing earnings and there's a better chance of biden wining in my opinion. But enjoy your gains man!

Trading bot told me to buy calls 4 times since the summer (including yesterday), and I ignored it every time because of a whopper $600K loss that has made me very timid. If I had followed the bot those 4 times, I would've made ~$1.3M.
You are the one trying to understand and give reason to the market.

I am talking about the actual mechanics of the market.
How often have IPOs been suspended, historically?
what in the fuck is a campaign enthusiasm? Is that how people get elected?
So, just like every election since Wall Street opened?
Sorry, I missed this until after close.  I'm holding FDX, UPS, WMT for December and January expiration.  I picked up some PLUG last week for a run to $19 - $22 (according to the crayons), so far on track.  Yesterday, I  only picked up a little PYPL for earnings which of course failed miserably along with all of my other earnings plays.  Having finally learned my lesson this earnings season, I will unload all or most PLUG prior to the 11/9 call.
Just got into NIO. That was a mistake, right?

Yeah I’m thinking about just sitting out. There way too much going on.

it will be +1000% by midnight

I get that the market always inverses logic, but I'm confused as to who would be buying right now instead of just selling and going cash gang until next week just to be safe.
Yes. But doesn't make sense to fight it. I've lost so much money by being confident about an outcome but wrong about the timing. I'll switch to puts in a couple days.

Yes, discretionary spending is way lower for low- and middle-class people. Redistribution will propel the American economy to new heights, further concentration of wealth will however work as a big brake. 

It is economics really, money going towards inflated assets is factually less productive than money going towards well-valued and/or intangible assets.
It’s always fucking priced in until it isn’t
Damn that is sad

I want to get back into plug but with longer dated options. Might wait until after tonight though.
Technically I'm mongolian so yes I am.
It assumes that stimulus happens faster and election uncertainty is gone.  The amount of money on the sidelines is crazy.  If this market drives higher people will have to capitulate and dive in.

Another reason I think this is pricing in a trump win is with all this crazy green, most Chinese stocks are actually down today lol say what you want about Trump but other countries know he doesn't take any shit.

Shit is definitely going to be contested though. Curious to see what’s gonna happwn
We had riots and shit for 2 months and markets mooned.

Nothing matters because it doesnt impact the billionaires + multimillionaires. None if it is based on what little people do, how the economy functions, whether companies are profitable or not. The top 1% will continue to hoard cash/assets, you can see the debt going up, fed printing money, yet money velocity is down. 

Its game over tbh unless we allow markets to stagnate for years or a crash looks like fundamentals will never matter again.
yes. Volatility shouldn't go down in a contested election on election day lol
isn't the market a little over confident about a clean win and smooth transition?
What happened to papa, I mean baba.
What stop loss?
Ass play
Market rallying because it's pricing in a Biden win and trillions more in stimulus.

Yeah, my man looks fly as hell

the market will rally on hopes that the president will be selected soon
Down 0.8% because of dollar taking an elephant shit 👽

Just use a spread to lock in the gains if the trade goes your direction and you're confident.

I see no downside to baba December calls tbh
50% WSB were bearish in poll, 23% were bullish for today. Never fails!
It was ignored cause high end retail stores or a mom n pop shop aren’t weighted in the DOW
Baba calls or puts for tomorrow? $300 or $250??
What if uncontested?
This has more to do with HFT having access to option buyers & sellers information. They just play the opposite of what retail is doing, and take in the cash.

Nope, we continued the Jpow pump sesh like nothing was happening. Case spike in June made us sell off though
How many times will you idiots use logic to predict what will happen in market. We went through this in April when all the bears kept saying we will retest March lows like a mantra.
The entire move down and entire move up in the last week has nothing to do with anyone buying and selling. It's just a reverse gamma squeeze. MM sell stock as people buy puts. Now puts are further OTM, they buy stock back. Simple as that. It's not like every retail/institution decided to buy in the last hour, just like it's not like they decided to sell last week in bulk together.

Market doesn't give a shit about who is president, market does care about uncertainty though. A clear winner tonight and no contested election will send us mooning regardless of who it is
I was holding a straddle on LYFT a few days ago. Expecting it to crash for the election, prop 22. Instead shares jumped 7 percent, I said screw it and cashed out everything at 36 percent gain. Not really sure what happened there
Did the stock market actually give a fuck during George Floyd unrest? 

Also how much unrest can there be with national guard standing down in half the country
If you're still holding/buying puts you really are mentally retarded.
The original retards.
Priced in asshole!

EOD puts has to be free money, also I just got banned from another sub for calling someone retarded. Thanks retards.
pricey.. one day.  


do you just look for it to be 10% otm?
Her face looks like a chicken nugget.
put a sizeable bet on sleepy j to win last night at -170. it's now down to -160. shits getting tight. 

also, my vxx puts some of u tards said were a bad idea are doing just fine, btw.
By definition, today can't be a bottom because Friday was lower
[deleted]
LET THE MARKET CRASH SO MY PUTS CAN PRINT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Christ dude, fomo has you gripped by the balls
If YoU aCtUalLy hElD gOlD bla bla bla
just picked up a couple at the top for once
As a perma-bull I actually feel sorry for the Bears. They were thinking too logically, but the problem is the market is a bet and it's placing it's bets in advance.

Good time to buy BABA and PYPL though
I'm so sad I did.
[deleted]
That's what I'd be doing right now if I had any money left.  But I don't have any money... so probably don't do what I'd do.
Lol sold too early. Scared rofl
[deleted]
I thought they were already happening.
So many retarded bears are about to buy puts right now
Are the markets aware that Trump will continue to be president for approx 3 more months?  I'm sure he'll be a reasonable & responsible leader that will calmly transition the country's most powerful institutions to Biden's administration.
His grandkids would be rich
Yea, stopped watching CNBC in April
Market dumps on election uncertainties, second wave of COVID, European shutdowns and lack of stimmy.

A few days pass. None of the issues are resolved.

Market says "eh, screw it, I don't give a shit anymore" and rallies back to new highs.
Thoughts on Wayfair earnings?
It sounds like he cares
I always thought the narrative was that BABA was tight with CCP
just remember if a play is too obvious it's most likely priced in already.

Nig*a what... how... what the fk did you buy?
when did he say that?
I sat out last week. Gotta inverse the market. One would think before election market is red. This year all logic in the market goes out the window.
Alange quality and overall watch is so much better than vc.
Anyone else pick up puts to ride till the end of the day?
i know you live in your own bubble, but trump winning is not bullish
Lol whenever people are all screaming "bUy PuTs!" you know it's time to double down on calls
dont risk it if you dont have a way out
That worked out well!
This market is such horseshit haha
He told me when it was 289
The theta on spy puts. Wtf
Do it. I dare you
Industrials, energy, and REITS those are my 2021 plays.
it makes sense yes but this market is irrational
That's like, your opinion, man :) I'd say if you want to understand everything about them, you should be reading about Austrian economics and the business cycle. That money printer keeps going Beer, and the bubbles keep getting bigger. At some point, we stop being a reserve currency, and the house of cards falls.
Common knowledge and priced in go hand in hand
Buy Jan calls.
Based on China just giving the company a slap and a warning despite them committing massive fraud, it's pretty safe to say they're government backed and not likely to go under now.
God damn premiums are sky high on everything
Yes cable providers are actually going to crush Netflix over the next decade! Buy Puts!
You good now? 😂😂😂
Saw this. Good novel. Almost read it. Just got Baba calls anyway.
Finally
Is this market pricing in a Biden win?
Guys, AMD just announced that they have a vaccine for Covid. Also they cured AIDS and convinced ISIS to play Call of Dudy instead of using real guns. I am so glad to share this good news with all of you. Now, please buy their stocks so that my calls survive.
Lol same pattern as yesterday
In the same boat, SQQQ just shit the bed.

Does 538 show historical numbers? This bet is probably a year old now as I usually only bet shit like this if I’m up for the season

Edit: just checked yeah it was over a year ago lol. Oct 28,2019
is a contested election really priced in???
These accounts are so obviously purchased. Look at the history on that dude. Has never commented on WSB before the last few comments. Previously exclusively posted on a Hispanic pro soccer sub, and at some point just totally stopped doing that and only posted GOP talking points lmao
"if you want to trigger a lot of people, spew nonsense that causes them to lose their faith in humanity"
Trump already said he will not cause a ruckus if there is a winner, no games (enough for the market to pump). Put/Call ratio says a lot of people put collars on their stocks. This gamma squeeze ain't going to end.
1. Solid industry and believe in market/company
2. down right now and cant go below 10 which makes it safer
3. Either pres it goes up 
4. been having 5% sways for the past 2 months for me and has not gone below 14 (when I bought)
RIP
I'm not holding any BABA. JMIA is the way.
Sell the blip

This is going to end badly
TSLA puts looking nice but I’m out of day trades. Is it worth sending it?
See, looks like it’s reversing
This is the most corrupt shit i've ever seen
I’m buying puts end of day no way we have a clear winner tonight
Thank you to the person on here who told me about AMRC
I’m hoping for some life in that Ant IPO, but it’s hard to predict Beijing
The Biden Bump already getting priced in
Uvxy if ur feeling sexy
Pump over. Buy puts
Somehow I'm more sad about my put hedges doing poorly than I am about my calls doing well

Fuck hyln in its vaporware ass
High risk, high reward.

WSB 99% bulls... uh oh
Tom Lee on CNBC predicts:
1. Biden wins = stocks go up
2. Trump wins = stocks go up
3. Contested election = stocks go up

The obvious play never works out. Spy puts and Vix calls for election day chaos? Nah, we mooning up in this bitch
What should I do with my SPXS calls &6 11/20
It’s so stressful holding calls today lol

I saw my ZM calls return $1.1k at one point, I thought of holding on, it started dipping, I finally sold at $200 profit 😒😒😒
Let’s do it
You think so?

I can see them fucking with the VIX for the rest of the week
Found the sub 5k (tiktok trader)
BABA at the very least not drilling to the Earths core. I’m probably selling my November call before earnings though

Good work.

You lose Florida and Pennsylvania it’s over
I question this. Why would it not have been priced in already if this were the case?
Lol nah
Can't sustain rallies. Too many paper hands and shorts. Back to the basement :(
Ant group ipo delay
If you're trading them, consider selling on the next big up day; if you're holding long term, just keep adding on dips until the day you retire
This is why you shouldn't yolo on a single play.

Bought calls spy 340 just now that expires this Friday

ICLN is surprisingly disappointing given the general market action and PLUG absolutely mooning right now
Markets domestic and abroad seem to be pricing in blue wave. The vol on futures tonight should make for some nice trading opportunities for anyone who wants to be a pajama trader because it is probably going to be touch and go even if that proves out.
Lol MM have to buy back all those shares they sold to hedge the puts they sold you guys that are worthless now.
Yep let's make some coin
Puts puts puts 🌈🐻
1x vs 1.5x
no they were outlawed after the crash in 1929
Imagine buying puts at the bottom. Pamp eet
I was deep in debt but went into spy calls early morning made all my losses back😎 now stopping until president has been chosen
This screams to buy puts right?
mmm tasty
she kinda quirky 😳
Okay let me break it down for you. This move means something will happen later that some people aren't going to like. Bank on it probably.
Ds 11/20 2.5 .03
The biggest gaurantee in life is that the market will always do the opposite of what the majority of people in here think it will.
Looks like $BABA left it's blinker on in the fastlane for too long ...
ANT IPO
A Biden win will make gun stocks rally hard. Interesting bet.
Markets voting Biden..
UVXY dropping again, VIX consolidating for leg down again lol
SPY has options expiring on Wednesdays. I knew there was a real reason election day is always a Tuesday.
Just sold everything...jumping out my 1 story window if market goes up now
Actually, you’ve got a fair chance of catching some serious volatility. Just depends on what we know about the election by tomorrow. Pennsylvania will take weeks, so eyes are on Florida. Good luck, bro
As cash gang I have no clue what to do I don’t know if we keep trending up and enter bull market or if this is just MMS.

You need to realise that stocks go up and down and which way to bet
all in on spy puts fuck u bitches

Fuck me if I wasn’t broke I’d be making so much money rn
It’s pretty fucking savage for the Chinese government to pull the plug on the Ant IPO this close.
Shit I accidentally went all in on spy puts for tomorrow
So no way we figure out who wins tonight so the market has to drop due to uncertainty like in 2000 with gore and bush???
I'm so happy I didn't buy puts yesterday
go for a run. better then therapy
IDK why anyone would buy puts, but this market is a house of cards built next to the ocean. When the tide comes in us poors are going to be fucked.
Check your ammo, we’re going on a bear hunt
Like Crumple Zones, Airbags, Anti-Lock Breaks, Traction Control, Seatbelts, all those alerts and backup cameras to tell you if someone is coming up on you. Cars are a shitload safer and more expensive.

No i just pointed out the left’s hypocrisy.
I dont agreed.  I think the market will collect premiums cause the IV is so high.  I dont like the risk reward.  There are thousands of trades over the next 10 years.  I can miss one!!
WSB
Damn I had 11/2 337c on SPY that had to be sold at a loss yesterday. Fuck me and my short expiration life style lol
If you want to trigger a lot of people, just post the following:

BABA has to be oversold due to the ANT listing drama, and earnings are on Thursday. Bounced off 280 in premarket and at open drop.
Jesus guys I mean boomer analysts even told you. JPM even said "if theres a dip before the election, you should buy it".
I'm holding, is probably a panic, but BABA is solid (I hope lol)
I'd like to order 3 giant red candles, and make it a rush order please. Thank you.

No doubt it's risky. If bad news piles up regarding Covid, this shit is gonna tank right back to where it was. Shares are probably a good play for the most part, but you might get stuck bagholding a while. Short plays are very high risk high reward now imo. Bought some shares of stuff yesterday and some small hedge options, but gonna hang tight until the dust settles for playing short stuff
I bought puts at 327.9
My BRK/B leaps are coming back to life. Only 30% down now.
Buy puts. There’ll be riots tomorrow. Shops are boarding up.
hey guys. earnings play here coupled with election shit that's not overpriced because of the election.   


Allstate 100C 12/18
No. The sadder part is they will sell their puts and buy calls 5 seconds before reversal
Long WMT calls

Hey, at least HYLN is pretty green
Holy fuck where’s the guy with those UVXY calls 🤮
Pray to god we do
i did and then sold in the same day to make 15 bucks lol
Liquidate all my VXX shit and go into 11/20 337p?
IV is insane today. Going to drop at some point
i'm hoping for just one thing now.

if we're back in STONKS ONLY GO UP territory, can i please have the 1030-1100 "bulls question life choices" dump before it recovers to go even higher?
Instructions unclear. Been buying since fridays eod rip
Ok
I’m gonna sell a covered call here soon
I will never financially recover from this
Tesla went off bro... been ages since that kind of move
So whats making it go up now 🥳🥳
Roll to November 20. Biden will most likely be declared by then and earnings is on 19th.

loss for ants
Go long. Calls a month out at least or longer if you're not broke/retarded
Dont give me hope on my call credit spreads..
SPY just made a casual +3% move since 2pm yesterday. 

Fuck this shit
Resistance at 3380
Bears didn't deserve this, did they?
Did SPY beat earnings yesterday?
i feel ya. honestly felt like my 1/15/21 apha calls were too short term.  sold them.  made like 20 bucks off a bunch of calls 😂
[deleted]
Just bought calls. Thank me later.
Puts at 338?
[deleted]
I concur. That weight and instant torque kills the tires. Calls on Michelin?
[deleted]
Stop buying stuff at ATH
Because this market has nothing to do with the economy. Literally just depends on more retarded bulls throwing in money. And the fed coming to save them when they’re in trouble
Friends wife got suspended from FB and last thing she posted was wedding pics 3 weeks ago... Puts on FB
what were your plays?
Just sell it’ll literally be worthless that’s way too otm
Feels like we are.
Yep same. Just sold them a few mins ago so I guess we’ll dump now?
God you are clueless
How are the bears doing? lol
This is hilarious and pathetic. 

It's like the final boss of Trump pumps before he loses and brings the markets down with him tomorove a point.

538 gives him 3 or 4% chance to win the popular vote, you got robbed on those odds
Imagine holding puts when the market has been going up straight for 200 years.
Anybody still holding these bloody puts?
See ya in a month
LOL at the autistic mother fucker to yolo what I have left to the ANT ipo runup. Fuck yourself. Good thing I didn’t listen to you.
Anyone getting back into FSLY after this week?
Millions!
Source? 👀
This is the pump to end all pumps. Donnie knows he’s going out hard tonight - he told JPOW to make this the greenest dildo ever seen for his Mar-a-Lago friends to get one more run in.
You're making $50k per month and you're still using Robinhood? Right...
Leg into a spread

How is the market not crashing the last two days??
Me trying to help others but they think the opposite, sad

A circuit breaker this week will bring us back to Spy 313, Trade very cautiously
Shout out to all my blind bulls. 😘✌️💚
get fukt bitch ass bear, never bet against murica
7pm ish is gonna be big today either a green dildo or a red dong
I WILL NOT FOMO
Nah everyone still on the OG EV stock Tesla, 🚂
First time I’ve seen converting puts to calls at open actually being profitable. 

Usually it’s the other way around
You can't say this is about blue wave US stimulus hopes boosting domestic demand. Global markets are all up even though Ant IPO got fucked and Europe is reliving the black death. This is just mania.
No, I fell sorry for you because you ski Vermont.
Are you selling fidget spinners? I here those are really popular tight now with the kids. Gonna be around for the next decade!
this is a bear massacre. no chill either. feel bad for the cuddly guys
What makes you say that

Pretty sure short interest is very low on CRSR, like less than 2 percent
W e a r e g o i n g h i g h e r
Don’t know what I’m looking at, what are you yoloing?? Fuck outta here
Lol for real, fuck every one of their puts. I'm surprised we didn't see more people larping and an autistic doctor shilling GME for Halloween.
Sold my SPY puts before they lost 50% of their value even though they are DEC dated. 

Still holding SPXU and SQQQ as hedges at this point though. It just doesn't feel right with such a low volume pump. 

That being said, now that my biggest bet is off the table, I'm sure this will whipsaw against me and I'll lose even more.
Ok Apple, I’m ready to get hurt again.
Also lost on DKNG... Luckily I only bought a few hundred dollars worth of options (expiry 11/13). Debating hopping in now with calls expiring next Spring
Calls on tmobile with all the political spam text and calls I am getting.  Just got 3 spam texts within 30 minutes.

Who are all the polls forecasting? I literally haven’t been paying attention.
Always lost on AAPL calls, always won on AAPL shares.  Screw options.
I want to close my amzn trade up 2.5k but will be hit with PTD rule
I'll get back into shorts if we cross 336.5 again but for right now I'm not touching this retard shit with a 10ft pole I'll stay cash until EOD then I'll enter a staddle
Time to sell?...we can’t have 3 Green Day’s in a row like this staring down the barrel of covid can we?

Pump is over, boys.
BABA TO THE MOOOOON
hey it's not just anime
Might have to look at UAL. AAL just seems down so much relative to its highs and I see a lot of upside potential even at a long share level.
Burned hard by SEDG on this Green Day 🥵
BIIB will have a big swing tomorrow from adcom briefings
If AMZN is under 3k buy it, seriously just buy it 🤑
a bear's wet dream right now
Bought puts on ATVI can’t break out past 77.50 (new support/resistance) levels . Buy puts at this price level Easy tendies
Just cut mine...only had 2 SPY $320 puts that I bought for 5.08 a piece, sold for like 1.68 each...wish I would’ve just sold yesterday when I was only down like $100
This is all in preparation for a circuit breaker coming this week
[deleted]
I have 5k left buying the pump what do I get ?
Lol DKNG gonna go red by noon
Lol what?? 310 is retarded
bang ding ow
4 more year
Yup in addition to 200 shares of SQQQ. It went down to about $700 after that screenshot but my call doesn’t expire till Dec so I got some time
[deleted]
Just voted. Super chill down there, almost no line.. This is the best time of the day to go if you were able to get the day off.
Nice way to lose that 5 figure on an election day

Imagine not holding calls and thinking market would tank.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
no you didnt
Election already priced in
Bull trap
It cracks me up how malls were held up as the epitome of shallow mindless consumerism when they were popular, and now that they're virtually gone, people wax on about how everything seems so impersonal and they miss the character of them.  I'm the exact same way.  I was abusing them then, and miss them now.
RKT you un-American fuck
“It’s normally $5k but only $349 for a few more days.”
Could this be a huge pump to take profits before dumping leading into close?
Cool.
Already sold out of all my puts
I thought i was a bit early buddy?
I'm in AMAT, NIO, and SPCE. All printing. Fucking love it.
Very stable genius
we're stalled out at 338, here's a chance to buy more calls before it shoots to 350 for no reason
Ho lee
Hell yeah congrats
Bet - I’m trusting you just put $650 into the call
My puts are almost worthless .. 1000$ down the drain ...fuck it I’m not going to sell. They expire tomorrow .. spy 310$ ..
Yes sir, buy dip again
Paging /u/SolitaryEgg.  Tell me, how does it feel to be the dumbest asshole on WSB?
I sold all but one
Is this the great SPY short squeeze of 2020 or what?

Crsr gonna get short squeeze to fuk.
I'm down a lot on puts but I will hold them. I've seen this kind of melt up before.
So investors are back to not caring about corona but who are they pricing in will win tonight?
Good advice and a cool username you can slide. In reality I agree, it’s just annoying seeing all these nerds think they’re the next Michael Burry
1 day SPY iron condor 315/320 - 347-352, received 0.88 credit

I worked the corporate gig for a company that had 100,000+ employees. I built an independent income.  I knew I had fuck you money when this happened.

Me: "I want to take some time off.  How much can I have"

My Boss: "You mean more than your six weeks paid vacation?"

Me: "Yes.  What is the limit on unpaid vacation?"

My Boss: "Well there isn't one."

Me: " You better not tell me that."

My Boss: "Well there isn't."

Me: "Okay I'd like to take the next four months off."

My Boss: "Hold on what?"

They had to give it to me, but the next year this huge multibillion company suddenly had a limit on unpaid vacation.

I was still in my 20's. 

Now they knew it too. :)
Life is fucking cruel.. went cash gang last week and i know the moment i go back we will crash, until then the market is pumping 2% everyday
Can’t wait for bulls to get a good castration
Gimme play plz I can't believe I'm losing money on fucken GE puts
Fuck no. This is not the market pricing in a Mango victory
This has pump and dump written all over it
I WANT TO GET OFF MR. BONES WILD RIDE

Shorting AMC Top has been nice so far Green Day baby boys

Watch there be mass chaos in cities tonight and its too close to call anything and it will take atleast a week and the market moons the entire time lol
Sold calls yesterday, would have been up bigly today. As it goes.

Anyone think if Trump wins we get a circuit breaker?
TSLA has re-entered the chat 🔋
[deleted]
Buy the rumor sell the news
mlmlwml
It looks like they take us higher just so we can drop really hard later on tonight
With an iron condor it’s maximum profit no matter what as long as it’s between the two at expiration right? So my spy break evens are 341.87 and 338.13
Yes, check it out if you don't want to understand anything about economics and the Federal Reserve. Guaranteed to get facts outright wrong, and miss critical information.
When you all called me autistic for saying TSLA under 400 was looking like a snack on Friday, I’ll be enjoying my tendies today.
today, the People have elected bears to be r fuk.
Yeah but at that point it won’t matter. Like, if Trump refuses to concede after losing, say, PA and one of NC, FL, GA, or TX, then it doesn’t really matter what Trump will yell out. He wouldn’t win mathematically.
Bear trap

You retardos don't realize that it's BULLISH regardless of who wins
If it's a blue landslide then him contesting means nothing
Chances are like 40% (538)that we don’t know prez tomorrow. I DGAF, I’m thinking puts could totally go tits up, but they’re on sale
Best form of insurance there is. Plan for the worst hope for the best
Stonks go up is the news
I've been selling puts

#ThetaGang.

#Just sell credit put spreads on SPY and you'll see the computers kick it down real fast.
This will be the thing that kills this sub.   Straight up.
Do I sell these aapl calls 11/20
You know you had like an entire month to vote, right? You lazy fuck.
gap filled
Cool, then why are you responding to me
Should I sell out of SPXS $6 calls 11/20
Blue 🌊 =green
REPEAT AFTER ME:

TRUMP PUMP TRUMP PUMP TRUMP PUMP
The 319 level seems to be when the brrrr machine gets going. The market priced in a Biden victory. But let’s be real here, Trump is actually ahead in the polls. The question is this: Is wall st dumb enough to believe the MSM polls, or the actual on the ground info that shows campaign enthusiasm?
Which stock or brokerage?
How many times someones gonna post this picture here? 😂
its down over 6%???
...I'm down 61%..really hurts cause I thought this made sense.
Avg down on puts here

Not sure how much higher we can go. Might sell some spy and voo puts later today
TSLA’s popping. what the news?
This 🏳️‍🌈🐻 knows when he's beat. Sold my puts at the open and bought some SPY 11/4 336c.
$6 + $15 foreign fee (charged a day later)
An earnings play on a gun company the day of an election that could nuke them?

Yeah, you've gotta be retarded.
Green as fuck. Why didn’t I buy smh
You guys stop jerking while you trade?
Its only custom to get burned by Activision.
weird. it was kind of the biggest story of the primary, how moderates coalesced behind the strongest moderate candidate rather than have Bernie Sanders win a plurality.

but hey, when you only pay attention to memes and OAN then it likely would be news to you

I need 360 by EOW, 380 by EOY, and 400 by Q1'21. Make it happen.
This is crazy. Pretty high, pretty fast
Nearly Everything has a big green dildo today

No tension is starting to pass. Anticipation of an event is always made more dramatic with our monkey brains. Things get “priced in” bc we hear bad news as fucking Armageddon when it in fact is just, bad news.

What is this
Lmaooooo where are all the guys who bought GME puts on Friday
We don’t care what bet you placed. Lmao
No one cares f@g
I agree with major cities being liberal. Its nearly impossible for a republican to win the popular vote
VIX isnt buying this
4chan /b/
This rally though. LMAO. No volume. Price is fooling you.
Someone's down 60% for the day?
I got puts that were in ITM at 335 yesterday, and now at a 35% loss...

RIP whoever bought strike prices < 330
🤡🤡🤡🤡
If I have an option for 11/27 and 12/18 and they shoot up, how close to exp do you wait?/ how much do I lose for exercising the option early? (Not saying im trying to do this today, but in the future if I’m up a lot.)
Saving your comment
That line has crept up to almost 7:1 in some books. It’s more likely he loses the popular vote by more votes this year but wins the electoral college.
Literally vertical holy crap
Always inverse WSB

I’ve seen a lot of unwarranted pumps but this might take the prize
VIX down to 34
Market clearly predicting a clean victory for either Mango or Sleepy. If anyone contests it, or Sleepy wins and Repubs keep the Senate, market will straight dump into a circuit breaker.
And by Cash we mean don't expect the ATMs to work.
End of hour at this rate
Take this with a heaping bucket of salt, as it was posted on Stocktwits, but the bulls there have generally been on point with info like this:

>According to unconfirmed media reports, NIO is preparing to expand its business beyond China, and start sales of ES8 and ES6 models in Europe in 2021.
You can buy options >5DTE?

Which app has that?
Sony might not have the biggest percents.. but they’ve been green for the last 8 days straight going on 9. Consistent tendies.
Someone is gonna be caught buying the top here soon, a little out of control buying right before an election lol
Sounds like you owe me like a dollar
Time to reverse
Holy shit bois
it will take alot to go back to green, depending on % lost sell now.

Last chance to get out bulls, act wisely. don't fall for this hype
We aren’t even an hour into the trading day but it’s felt so long
Crank it up to 11.  You see, that's one more than 10, so it's more volume
I was agreeing with you,  and at open they definitely did when it drilled from 3004 to 2982
hope we do it today, then I can recoop all the L's I just took on my puts from yesterday LOL
If Biden wins it’s going sub 300
Thanks for the advice. I thought 9 weeks was too far
Enjoy the Green Day. When the result of the election wont be known until the end of the week, plus the chance that Donnie Boy will contest it. This is like the Pearl Harbor before the attack
looks like you unlocked the next level, bankruptcy
SPY 350 EOW
Its surreal seeing an index go vertical like this. Wow.
Don't ask why, just ride the trend 🌱

I think it’s a solid plan. We’re not going to stop flying forever. I’m doing the same thing but with UAL. Based mostly on my anecdotal DD of seeing the United terminals more packed than American the past few flights I’ve taken since corona started

Couldn’t he get back in at the “bottom” even if it’s triggered?  Could actually save him money if it kept dropping after 50% (obviously theoretical...  we know that’s not gonna a happen).

HYLN baby let’s keep this up please I need $22
Who would have thought markets wouldn’t ROPE at the prospect of a stable, boring moderate?
hopefully it goes better than the reversal at 336
Lose the money, lose the wife, more tendies for you.
Believe it or not, you have people reporting the actual numbers coming out of polling sites...
holy dildos
Repeat ad Infinitum: stimulus run up soon (even if actual stim isn’t passed); vaccine / new therapeutics soon. The dip was there to be bought without being so leveraged as to not survive a few topsy turvy days meanwhile
Yeah I’m really dreading tomorrow
Broseph, the market prices things out years in advance lol(refer to the Tesla stock manual). But in the context of this convo, yes, it’s currently pricing in a victory. I’d guess we’re still only 1-2 months advance. The market moves fast, so I wouldn’t be surprised by the end of the week it’s pricing in a year in advance.
We're being set up for a spectacular fall

340 EOD no joke
I mean, I don't care what you think lmao
I’ve never seen SPY do this
what’s the difference between when i fuck and when i get fucked by vix? i find bottom

You can get this at a lot of suit places and with a tailor.
QQQ not a single drawback or red candle even on the 5 minutes jesus ducking christ
VIX will be below 15 next week right?
probably just as accurate as half of these IB analysts
Idk how many times we have to teach them this lesson LOL
waiting for v and tdoc to go up some more, hopefully everything crash again so I can buy back calls

Tesla 😳😳
I'll be awaiting your loss porn
yeah idk, the MM's  just wanted to fuck bears today. Too bad I have no common sense and won't sell.
Last few weeks there’s been so much chatter about contested elections and uncertainty

The reality is that 🥭 or Biden losing one or two key/tossup states is a wrap for either candidate. Biden losing PA and/or Michigan and Wisconsin. 🥭 losing FL, GA, NC, TX. If any of those hits, this is over. 

Money just doesn’t want to get left behind once it’s shown that this won’t be contested.
sold
Market on easy mode.
TSLA and NVDIA shared last week were THE PLAY. All of the gains and none of the stress of expiration
It just keeps going 😩😩😩
This right here.
Bears in absolute shambles my god
Fuck should have bought that TSLA dip last week
thanks
[deleted]
no, it is still not too late to buy calls
Lol.
Sold my spy calls kind of early for a 50% gain.  Should’ve held, but I guess I can’t complain lol
DXY tanking, equities mooning.  Market is pricing in Biden win with a fuck-ton of stimulus boys.
Twitter, the bastion of truth and facts.
There’s no end in sight!! TSLA just keeps goin up!!!
My only thought is that the market thinks the unprecedented amount of votes will provide clarity and less conflict. That or we're in for the biggest rug pull of 2020.
"Democracy?"
I’ve been tryna get back into NVDA for 6 months. Can’t believe I sold in March.
Lmao short squeeze
Why are stocks up on election day? I thought the relief rally would be after election so tomorrow?
Well, my SPY put was not the move I guess. Didn’t see this shitshow of an election pumping the market like this...
Old resistance is 3393, previous ATH
Are you joking
Watch for reversal at 338
But you believe those who were smart enough to go cash gang for the election would wait until the day of the election when choosing to sell?
It's bullish for January because they expect him to spend a lot on stimulus and infrastructure bills. But that also means he would need Senate cooperation to pass those spending bills.

There's nothing bullish happening in the next couple months however.
IMO AAL won't exist by then
ah shit, tesla calls i sold 🤯
SPY PUTS?
Buy vix calls and spy puts at the top right now, we gonna get funky
Holy shit spy what drugs u on

Downvoting the mango trolls is going to get really old today.

Are my 11/13 spy 320p's fucked? Or do I 💎 hand it?
Lmao yeah okay market, let's rip up for absolutely no reason. No COVID/terror attacks in Europe. No election anxiety in the US. No increase in COVID cases and hospitalization. No this is just swell, let's go to SPY $340.
Woah the volume is so low!!!
The fact that you can classify yourself as a Democrat or Republican is honestly sad af.

Sorry about your losses on puts. Y’all should have learned from April this year
ARE YA WINNING SON? YES I AM DADDY everything is up 2% today
Damn bro I don’t expect this shit to hold tho maybe after today it will taper off
I feel so smart, being late on buying puts, and buying calls instead 😂
This could work, but I think this is typically how people lose money on the market. Fighting trends.. although I do feel like a drop wouldn’t be unreasonable
You must hate money
If you don’t vote Orange then you ain’t black

Am I retarded for thinking AAL calls expiring in July are good play? Seems like reopening and a Biden win could push it up to $15
Be careful...every 10 points up..the next moment it will drop 5%

unfortunately, im a professional retard
Nasdaq is pumping out of its mind.

Grow up
Oh good so I’m the idiot then 🤪

Buying more BABA is definitely the play though. This is political bs, commerce always wins
See the market is telling us something. You only make money when you are stupid
man, even GME get's a little love today
Same
I got a GREAT entry on NIO 12/18 40c this morning when it dipped down to 32.8. Also nabbed 11/13 40c for the memes with the spare $45 I had left over.
Newsflash: The "market" is actually comprised of millions of individuals making individual decisions in non-hive-mind-like fashion.
The VIX trend is less telling than the level, when it's this high. IMO.
Not if shit hits the fan
Jesus
r/cursedcomments
So the market would price in a change 9 weeks out?
🚨 This is not a drill. TSLA going full autism mode. Get in boys
Retards have woken up from their slumber
have been holding VXX and TLT calls 12/18 expiry after some retard suggested here. It has been bleeding since. where's that guy?
Is the market really factoring in a Biden win right now?? Is that what’s causing this?
Love it, thank you
That’s the thing. I can actually feel it coming very soon. That’s why I just double down on my SPY puts and VXX/UVXY calls 5 mins ago. Either I end up rich or lose some hard earned cash. Worth the risk
I want to load up on NIO under 28 again lol.
Is there anything left to buy the dip on?
lol keep telling yourself that, “Mr.Big brain macro thinking gay bear” 

People who lose the most money in the stock market are often the ones who think they “understand” the market
Don’t get stupid boys. 538 puts chances of knowing the likely winner by market open tomorrow at 60%. Save a little bit to throw on some aggressive shit if the coin lands on the other side. More money to be made there
Dam feels like there is no more downside in the market. Just buy stocks.
Invest in VTI and wait for 5 years - I'm something of a yolo-er myself 😉
Is election day, drill team taking off to vote
Lol thank you for your sacrifice
Fuck I missed a 10am alert for 351c FD and then was looking and thought it already doubled so not gonna buy it and now look damn lol

Tsla pump after I sold some shares at the dip wow

Found the smoking gun boys, DXY is falling off a cliff...
[deleted]
holy fucking jesus
As green as everything is though I’m not adding anything more until probably after we get done results. Probably will miss out on some extra gains (outside my current positions) but shits so risky
I would roll. Tough timing though cuz if Biden is declared winner tonight it would likely get a big quick pump tomorrow but if not then down we go.

bruh i  had a 430 weekly tsla call but thought it was too retarded and took the loss smh
Starbucks never closed around here, just the inside.  Most of the local coffee shops got steamrolled by lost sales and subsequently closed. More people are working from home so are setting their own hours therefore have plenty of free time to go get a $7 carmel breve latte with a caramel swirl and whipped cream and sprinkles and a fucking cherry on top or whatever these cretins drink.  On top of that, as per the "hot waitress index", they've had a chance to bolster their staff with bigger tits and higher cheekbones so more people want to come.  Exponentially so since everyone is trapped alone and just needs a distraction so tossing off in the car while staring at the bouncing cheerleader serving your drink  is at an all time high.

tl;dr Becky don't give a fuck 'bout no covids
If stimulus comes along with ATH, it’s going to be a hell of a rush. The fomo is already gripping the market
Wow please slow down before you go bankrupt big boi

The market is rallyling because there is no volume and there was a gamma flip.  But thats too complicated for you.
I don’t think that’s why we’re mooning. The reality is that if Trump loses a major key state (FL, GA, TX, etc) or Biden loses two of his (PA, Michigan, Wisconsin, etc), this thing is over tonight. Investors don’t want to be left behind.
Is 340 even out of the question at this point
welcome the club g
keep buying calls, it's pumping because the put/call ratio is over 1 and it's just not going to stop
Didn’t feel like enough of a correction last week to me...  especially if we have a contested election.  I’m only a little gay bear curious... I swear.

If it's going to sell off, it'll be in futures based on news. Shorts likely aren't looking to enter a position with an outcome largely based on a binary event. Probably a slow grind to 338 or flat most of the day. VXX going out to the woodshed but will stay high regardless

As long as Fear and Greed Index stay below 30, I'm buying as many calls as my gf's bf will allow me
But, Mitch McConnell can say, that’s too much, and the market will go on with no stimulus pack till January when Democrats are sworn in
Probably loving life in Utah right now, tbh.

Market is mooning because we are seeing the trends come in from Florida and Pennsylvania. And it’s not good for the blue man.
You told me puts would print :(
[deleted]
You buy half a Tesla stock? And called that a yolo?
just lost a quick $500 and all my gains from last week

Nice
Because that's how 10% chances work... the underlying stats are just wrong... lmao.
it's all ogre now
When will the results be out?
just wait and we'll see
Bears r fuk 

Election uncertainty is priced in. Fuck your puts.
Not sure why the downvotes, Trump actually did fuck it up and introduced him as "Lil Pimp," look it up.
Palantir
Can someone tell me why my posted thread keeps getting removed, trying to help yall with legit DD on VSTO
FSLY looks like it's prepping for better GYNA relations. My FDs are starting to print.
Fight it NIO fight it
Market is either predicting a trump win, or biden landslide with stimulus behind it
Please tell me I’m not the only one that has seen baba stop at exactly 289.00 5 different times then go down, not a cent more, how does that happen? Wtf
So if its mooning on election day, market wants biden to win? if Trump re-elected all in on puts?
Can't hold AMD down forever. Su Bae <3 <3 <3
I had no idea this happens haha

BABA looking nice. Buy the dip and then the earnings dip
Cant even afford rope rn
Exactly I’m wondering how tf the market is going up rn. The entire country is getting more tense by the day. Maybe JPow just switched the button on.
yes on ibkr
time to reload on puts
Now there’s an actual fucking retard.
Definitely. Now if they announce an indefinite suspension.. thats when shits gonna hit the fan freal.. the chances of that happening are slim to none but then its the ccp we’re talking about
Oh wow didn’t know
Tonight is Maryland and South Dakota as well. Could be what it needs to start another run
Bought more uvxy because I hate myself
WU
Perfect time for some puts
Banks and Industrials too lol
What’s going on with SolarEdge?
I did that yesterday..
China stocks down tho
[deleted]
I wonder how the guy who got the Romney face tattoo is doing.
Stfu
SPY 340 EOD tomorrow.
[deleted]
No
Yup because this is going up further

L
I just sold calls. IV should collapse today and tomorrow. Not a recommendation.
This reminds me of the Stark Trek movie where Hector the Klingon yells, “send in everything!!!” 

That’s my portfolio today
Exactly
Guys help me pay for college by buying $PLTR shares
That dude is about to get paid
Pretty high volume? What ticker you watching? SPY doesn't have a single 1M candle.
About to dump. Better sell now bulls, its your last chance
That's The difference between the guy buying at the bottom and the guy who held a position to the bottom
[deleted]
Spy puts iv is a joke guarantee you will get fuck
Flat day for NIO better than a red one
this is so fucking green its insane
That’s the joke lmao. Still holding! 

RKT 20c 12/18

Market is rallying because it predicts dems will take the senate and presidency. Pelosi is going to jack offf the economy with a 3T bill and put her finger in the butt for a prostate orgasm

This did not age well
Box? You a toy lambo?
Everyone buying everything up because the President elect has so much emphasis on certain areas of the market. The hedging on everything today is a total gamble but I love it.

WMT COTY OXY PFE RKT ABBV DKNG calls here
RKT starting to run up to earnings. Going to moon
MSOS ETF is the way, no options though =/
Come on NIO all I need is 2 points.
Thatd be pretty cool
We going long on NIO. Biden bring me China tendies pls
This sell off is gonna be one of the greatest we’ve ever seen I can’t wait
Nothing would make me hornier than squeezing every short out of every stock in the whole market on erection day!
Where's the volume? This bubble can pop anytime.
YTA live in a cardboard box to support the homeless people
More Slacktivism. Nothing more.
VIX is high as fuck dude lol

It's basically SPX earnings day tomorrow. I'm selling more contracts on SPY today
well WSB is bullish again, time to switcharoo
Whenever I look at HYLN it looks like it’s mooning but the stock price is always lower than the last time I checked
Fck ur gay ass zoom platform
No this is staying bullish
No the opposite, Market is rallying because. Predicts dems will take the senate and presidency. Pelosi is going to jack offf the economy with a 3T bill and put her finger in the butt for a prostate orgasm
You know what that means...buy the dip!
buy more
Good, because i would have hold.
Lol you're fucking delusional. But I guess that was my mindset before the September bull massacre
Solitaryegg in scrambles
I'm a 🚀 man!
Any truth the rumor thst T has conceded even before polls closed? Is this why we are mooning? I was promised riots and bricks being thrown in downtown Denver. Peaceful transition of power?! Blabering Blatherskite!
[deleted]
Imagine pumping off the hopes of an increased lockdown and higher taxes
Did erection results get leaked early?
I keep thinking that too, but I think the metagame is to continually find fresh meat who don't see it coming. Being experienced has perks, except that I doubt myself when plays are *too obvious*.
It’s Indonesian for jungle (utan) person (orang)
DRILL TEAM SIX.... ASSEMBLE RIGHT FUCKING NOW
Makes perfect sense. Market up almost 2% and Vix down 6% on Election Day where we may not know the winner and supposedly record covid.
What’s your expiration? I’ve been sitting on 11/20 300 calls for a long time and I’m back to even on them. Thinking of averaging down but don’t want to fuck myself with short expiration.
So there's 1.5 Puts being bought for every Call?
My priest said it’s only ok if he does it. I don’t wanna go to h e double hockey stick😳
All this guy posts about is some outdoor store so it's probably that.
I saved one UVXY spread but I think I just over hedged and if the market does crumble or volatility rises I can have a chance to recoup some of the losses on it.
told yall baba is some gynese shit
Paypal squeezing
It’s coming down soon, but buying spy puts Friday was retarded. 

Had to listen to the bears be annoying as fuck all weekend while I sat on the tqqq puts I’d sold haha.
What do I do with my SPXS calls $6
Just bought **Etsy** calls
[deleted]
[deleted]
Jack Ma criticized China's state owned banks. Good luck
I sold it, can't take this kind of pressure, make 150%
Just went in on calls for this election. I believe in ‘Merica and I believe that we’ll have a clear winner by the end of tonight. Regardless of the party that wins, I think the late votes won’t have enough of an effect to alter the election and Wall Street is going to rally tomorrow regardless of the outfall. Pressure will be relieved, we’re all gonna wake up tomorrow, and we’re all gonna have another day at work. Life will go on. Stonks only go up.
Lmao so many dead bears
How so? From what I have heard the markets appears to be pricing a Biden victory. Dollar is weaker across the board (big stimulus). Equities generally stronger (certain result) and 10 year bond yield is up (big stimulus).
bears be sweating
FUBO short squeeze?
As a wise man once said "it's already priced in"
[deleted]
So yesterday it was pricing in a Biden win. Today a trump win. What are y’all smokin 🤣
Give it time.  Just early optimism...
Who's betting on PredictIt? I don't think Biden is a sure thing, but I'll bet against Trump for $0.58...
Sir, this is the unemployment line.

Calls or puts?!?! Also ban!!!
Sell the news.
We going down down this time
It was going so well before being mentioned on here...
Only thing Trump will be sweeping is the prison cantina.
Oof my Yahoo Screen froze. Briefly letting me not realize how gaped my SPY puts truly are. 

Never hitting refresh again my god
I don't see him winning
market is rally because stonks fucking go up
stimulus headlines are coming back once again
I really expected red today. Not bigly green.
Thanks, Mang!
Bears as much as I don't want to believe it like the rest of you guys

this pump seems pretty legit

pretty high volume, VIX dead, DXY dead, bonds dead

people are really optimistic on the outcome of the election I guess and want to "buy the dip"
K
They are getting fucked hard lmao
Thanks can’t wait for that honestly
The ecstatic bullish optimism here is concerning. This is a juice before a big sell off eod.
[deleted]
I can’t even think right now. Was not ready for this
https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk
Market is rallying because no volume, nobody is doing anything but wait for news to leak out. Good for those of you with calls but I’d be weary of doubling down
market acting like we’ll have a winner by tonight. yah ok
That's already a given. I'd recommend you some shin or jin ramen though. Look for a korean market near you.
Which one? 🤡
It’s only at ~60 on 1hr and 50 on 4hr. 5m candles don’t matter.
Grindr
It is pricing in that we would eventually have a president? Lmao what do they think we're voting for? Best banana of 2020?
Sell puts on Thursday
The market would’ve gone down if that were the case
Of course as soon as I buy Calls we dip 😂😂
Guys I had conversion therapy. I am no longer a 🌈🐻
Yeah, I have no clue about the safety tests for it.
everything is backwords
Can you really call it investing if you just dumped gasoline on your wallet and tossed a match?
[removed]
Cannabis is not
You think it’s completely related to the ANT IPO?
Whoever wins we mooning
It priced in the depression in 2040 and now we are pricing in the first Chinese president of the United States of America due in 2044
Well okay. Stay strong friend. Consider selling puts at the bottom like I have been doing
Careful though. If Biden wins, Mitch can say “no stimulus because Democrats cost too much”. No stimmy till January if that’s the case.
Did I for real time Amazon calls?! 3250 exp Friday
Calls?
Anyone else think this game is actually too easy? Wasn't this morning pretty obvious?
My portfolio is too tech, and I think it may get rotated out of after election if dems win....  But fk if I know any good non qqq names.
Oof this is gonna dump so hard if it does.. be careful bois😳
Just like 2016 when they talked the same and nothing happened?
Then why did SEDG get hammered while SPY shot up?
If Trump wins I will chop my own dick off.  Like I said it’s a mathematically impossibility.  This isn’t 2016 bruh, 93 million people have already spoken.
LUMN calls
Picked up some BABA calls at the bottom, see you on Singles Day Chyna
lol
Holding mine. Volatility won't arrive until tomorrow, if it arrives at all. 50/50
Dude they were insufferable.

I sold tqqq puts on Friday and bought them back Monday for 40% profit. 

But tbh even I didn’t think it was gonna be this green today. Thought green Monday and red or flat Tuesday.
You are going to lose your job
[deleted]
Bears r fuk
So tempted to sell covered calls but I need to have restraint. Not until tomorrow morning. The $450 in premium on assignment strike looks nice though....restraint.
I wish they weren't doing the generic case for display thing. I like to look at the art for games I don't normally know about and make random impulse buys based on the studio and case art. That's how I got into falcom games. We'll see how it plays out. This doesn't seem too popular but then again most nerds don't know what the fuck they actually want. I think they'll evolve with the feedback as time progresses.
I mean you could have called half of the stocks out there and have been right lol

With that said I’m a rkt believer :-)
VIX tracks volatility projected *over the next 30 days*, so naturally as we get closer to the catalyst and VIX gets farther from it ... science
Burning day trade even worth it when IV is this high? Won’t see any returns really
Fair enough.
“Alright there Frankie....we’re here at Papa John’s”
So you don't know what short covering means. Or don't know the difference between that and hedging. FYI I exited my shorts (covered) them at 3233
It's obvious! It's a red day. Stocks 'll turn red any second now. Any second now
That’s me...
is PayPal run done?
lol SPY put/call ratio 1.48
I give up what kind
Right? Things keeps fucking going.
Why the fuck is baba keep stalling at exactly 289.00 on the dot? Wtf
Same
I thought it was supposed to be staircase up elevator down. Seems like it’s the opposite.
What if the earnings were contested by a lawsuit and dragged out for a few days?
Hope you retards bought baba calls at open. Biden wins, ANT IPO goes through, earnings, and singles day all around the same time. This was just a scam to let more Chinese billionaires load up 🚀
Well the stock is going up in his defense, and their are a lot of people long on it
Sell solar calls now or wait?
entire sub goes bear for the election lmao
Should I sell my SPXS $6 calls
Looking at 2016, vix went up day after.  This election is even more contentious than that one, so again, I'd hold with a GTC limit sell order of what profits you're looking to hit, within reason.
[deleted]
Just bought calls, prepare the drill.
Lol. Hr fuked up!
Trump win mooning, why is all green otherwise?
Theta applies to elections, too. Trump has run out of time and is still OTM.
Spy overbought rn im a bull but this ones obvious

Cup and handle on the 3month. Might rip and breakout
No volume. Cash gang.
Market recalculating for a Trump win just like Nate Silver lol
This is bs. Polls were wrong in 2016. They’ll be wrong today.
Same! I’ve already accepted my 11/4’s expiring worthless 😪
Watch nothing happen after the results are called and we all get IV crushed tomorrow. MMs win again
Sounds right
So market is rallying because it’s predicting a trump win?
Trump leading New Hampshire by 6 votes. (26 votes in total)   2020 president confirmed?!?!?!
UVXY is for losers URTY FTW!!!
Watch as nothing happens in USA and stock market acts like retards to panic buy or sell.

Not true at all. Market values predictability and consistency.
Is there a reason why IPOB keeps dropping? Any news?
Polls haven't moved much in months. Bears- I'll buy puts. lmao
I work for an oil company. We make transportation fuels. It is important for us to assess and determine when hydrogen fuel cells (and battery too) trucks will be widely used because that impacts diesel demand. I run that analysis. Hydrogen is going to be very large. Plug is not a meme
Fuck it I’m buying 19.5 Uvxy calls expiring Friday watch me burn this cash
markets thinking Biden runs away with it. No way to contest, and stimmy coming shortly after.

Thats how I read this.

Of course they are going to pump the shit out of this market on the election day but it won't change the results.
Oh its still pumping cool
You know how hard it is to get fair-trade salamanders these dats?

Had the same thought
[deleted]
Seriously? That’s pretty retarded.
Im with chu. I think good dip to buy.
The first hour of the market doesn’t mean shit. I’ve literally seen it pump the first hour, bears are fuk, just for eod bulls are fuk.
Lol, you had to say it...
Fuk it I’m still waiting
[deleted]
Spy puts here
Moment of silence for the Cash gang waiting for election dip😂
Jack Ma infuriated the CCP by criticizing the banking system in China.
That’ll hit too lmao

we are rising cause "no stimulus until after election" tomorrow is finally "after the election" lmao
Spy puts here
Could this be a move?
11/13 VXX calls down 30% today OOF
The problem is that he gambles with the rich. If he gambled with the poor, we could have had narrower class divide.
repented for my gaybear ways by closing out puts, luckily my PLUG $17 calls covered my ass
put holders.. what do we do
To fuck with everyone’s calls and puts. Why else?
SPY 350 EOD at this rate da fook
Everyone and their mother has been talking about a “civil war” happening since September. If you don’t think it’s priced in, then I don’t know what to say...

Then it stay flat

Right. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
I can get behind that level of going all in
Market up bigly, china stocks getting hammered... They predicting a Trump win?
sometimes i look at the unusual options activity and wonder which one of you guys did that

Bears are straight clowns this morning. Love to see it
Should have gotten more BABA dip
It won’t. Everyone is hype at the sale. Slow bear
$CARTEL
It's less inflation and more the fact that it was a hell of a desperation deal. That is a 1928 Chrysler Imperial 75 Roadster, would have cost $1.5k new ($24k-ish today).  


And you didn't ask but since I know way too much about this picture, that is Walter Thorton. He retired a very rich man, and died in 1990.
[deleted]
We’re filling the gap above so we can drill the rest of the week. I dont trust this pump
I’m glad I have these baba calls instead of spy puts lol get fucked bears
 Baba dropped almost 8% and nov 6 put are barely 150% up. Is it IV drop or IV gain? I thought these options should be up 500-1000%
They don't even have a product. I heard they rolled the volatility down a hill to give it the appearance of motion
holy great mother of pumps
VIX going down. What does this mean? Less *uncertainty* on who will win the election?
It will. This is a bull trap imo
Correct
Richard Dawkins approves.

I just noticed that’s a real hand in the first picture, wtf.
Doesn’t sound profitable. Puts on that idea.
I'm holding out for at least $50. Several year timeframe. Not really a gambler like most here. I can afford to lock the money up.

People still believe stock market is connected to real life 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uh yeah. Isn't that why we're all here?
Implied volatility on VIX 321%!?!?! 👀!!!!

Wooo yea cheap puts I thought I missed out
I guess Europe doesn’t use Zoom?
So mad at myself for buying puts. 

Looking at how much we sold off in October I thought the smart move may actually be to buy calls... everyone is talking SellOff,... usually means it doesn’t happen. Why did I doubt my vibe...
Idiot bulls, dw they’ll bleed tmm
The market apparently is pricing in the fact that we will eventually have a stimulus and a president, according to CNBC.

So that brings back the question, why the fucckkk did it sell off last week on stimulus and election?...
[deleted]
we'll see i guess.  i mean obviously you're not wrong but that doesn't mean that future growth potential isn't there.  leaps not fuds

same brôther
they are announcing the vaccine today or something???? da fook
Nah. Just fucking the shorts over as per tradition.
Plug Power ($PLUG) going to the fucking moon. Vertically integrated hydrogen company that does everything from hydrogen production, to transport, to fuel cell manufacturing. If ever there was a play broadly on the “hydrogen economy”, Plug is it. The industry is projected to worth trillions of dollars (from McKinsey). Europe outlined its hydrogen strategy and Biden win will push the US even faster into the space as well.
This is fucking wild
Haha
Nah, but you're right about his base. Low income wage earners that have to actually go into work.
DKNG $44 by this Friday

Bull buy puts??

I could care less mate. I'm not even from the US.

No its still in great shape, only 80k miles on it. I'll sell it to you for (checks blue book) 10k.
It's like people haven't learned to always look for the bull case first.
Plug

Why is UVXY dying?
SPY RSI now above 76 for over 30 mins straight. Fucking fake and gay. Should I close my puts on the next pull back?
damn my spy 11/11 call is already itm, should I sell now at 100%?
Get paid 20 racks commission Friday... someone convince me not to abuse robinhood’s instant access feature to buy 5k in puts without it in account yet.. please... I can’t stop thinking about it.
Hahahaha my puts are fuuuuuucked
TQQQ profit converts to SPXS
For all the people crying about volume and "WhO's BuYiNg??", just remember, SPY can go up on no volume. 

Bulls don't need volume to prove it - just look at all of 2017. Bears need volume to prove it.

It's not a fair game for Bears. Never has been, never will be.
I sold! Now I feel safe
Buy some stocks for companies you believe in. Then hold. Don’t touch it. You can’t grow a tree if you constantly dig up the seed.
Fuck this might be the top for today on indexes
Tsla about to hit a double top I’d get in puts now

Seems fitting bears get raped on Election Day
lol why did I even hedge.
Lol this fake PayPal pump. Short this all to the ground
Except Trump looks vibrant (did you see all his back to back rallies last night?) while Biden looks broken down in body, mind and spirit.  He will be a puppet dancing on strings.

So much organic growth. I'm fucking loving it!
I’ve definitely seen a few people with APPL or MSFT and a few others around this subreddit. If you google “Robinhood free stock reddit” it should bring up a few people that have gotten it. It’s like a 1% chance I think.
Fuck bears upvote party 👍

Holy fuk we pumping
They talk like we only buy a week out like they do lawl.
I trade 3-10k per trade only when medium to long term market opportunities present themselves. so every few days to weeks. if I make over 5% on these trades, the conversion fee isn't too bad
I use robinhood

The Yaris is no more?:(
I guess we're going straight up
omg what the actual fuck is that candle

Well done, this is way cooler than saying you have cash in your checking account.
Yes, the market is totally pricing in a Biden win, because literally so much has happened in the last 24 hours to shakeup the race.
Fisker literally makes **ZERO** money as it has **ZERO** sales because it has **ZERO** cars, but is a billion dollar business. This is why we can never make fun of stories like the tulip frenzy. Human stupidity and greed are everlasting.

Bears are mentally ill. Y’all aren’t getting circuits breakers again. You’d need normal people, who have “just leave your investments alone until you retire” drilled into their heads to panic sell.
Always do
hold hold hold. at least that’s what i’m telling myself. january 300p here. election certainty and stimulus priced in, anything else and we could correct further

Election is now priced in thank you for playing.
God he's posting dancing tweets

Are you lost?
Baba could still go lower imo. not expecting pump since investors scared and realising CCP could just pull the plug whenever they want.
Why would that dude be mad at Amazon? It’s not like they made their stock go down. Blame the investors who backed out of it for whatever reason and caused it to drop lol

Wow been disappointed by RKT for so long that I assumed it was illegal for it to have two green days in a row.
This jaunt bout to crash and burn. Pallets of bricks showing up in metropolitan areas. 🍑 pretty much guaranteed to declare victory tonight after exit polls show he's in the lead without factoring in all the 96M early mail-in/in-person votes. Countries advising not to travel to the US. Bad foreign actors guaranteed to stoke the flames. I'll be shocked if we don't wake up to civil unrest tomorrow.

Happy Cake Day dudeitsadell! I hope you will have a wonderful year, that you'll dream dangerously and outrageously, that you'll make something that didn't exist before you made it, that you will be loved and that you will be liked, and that you will have people to love and to like in return.

Cashed out yesterday. Now I’m standing here with my dick in my hand waiting for a dip to buy back in.

Long gold, guys. You know it’s the play. At least 10% of the folio
WTF Corsair? Why?
** The meeting came after Mr Ma criticised China’s state-owned banks at a financial summit in Shanghai at the end of October. Jack Ma suggested the big banks had a “pawnshop mentality** ” and that Ant was playing an important role in extending credit to innovative but collateral-poor companies and individuals.

At the same summit, however, Wang Qishan, China’s vice-president, emphasised the importance of financial stability. “There should be a fine balance between encouraging financial innovation, invigorating the market, opening up the financial sector and building regulatory capacity,” he said. “Safety always comes first.”

Before announcing the timing of the IPO, Ant executives met with PBoC officials this summer to seek their blessing, according to two senior group executives. Despite receiving assurances, there have long been voices sceptical of Ant within the PBoC and China’s banking and insurance regulator, which views itself as the champion of the country’s biggest lenders.

“I've never seen an IPO suspended at this stage” said a director at one Shanghai-based brokerage, who described the decision to suspend Ant's dual listing as a “very last minute thing".

“It's in no one's interest to cancel the allocations at this stage,” the director added, “but I don't think there's any precedent for this type of situation.”

Lol at bears gloating when futures were down a bit Sunday night
Why don't you like money that much? Just sell options instead of buying them.
Gave up on options heavily - gonna buy stock from now on and only dabble in options - would have been better off back when I started, I will be better off now.
I would be jumping on BABA so hard right now if I wasn’t already balls deep in it
We had a gold standard where we could redeem money for gold at the bank, but govt printed currency every chance it got. Lincoln created the "greenback" as a paper dollar to pay for the war. Wilson created the Fed and immediately started printing money. So while we had a gold standard, they still had inflation in the money supply, which is what caused the big crash before the Great Depression.

The Fed continued printing until the 1970s, when the other countries started calling for their gold to be redeemed, at which point Nixon abandoned the "gold standard", closed the exchange window, and told them all to get fucked. 

To learn more about how govt ruined our money and creates the ever increasing booms and busts, visit www.Mises.org :)

Calling someone like him rich just helps billionaires maintain that status quo. Let’s have some class solidarity instead of passive aggressively calling him rich because he can take off work for a couple years. He’s still a wage slave like most of us here. Drawing these arbitrary dividing lines helps nobody except those who are actually rich, not the chump working 60 hours a week to bring home 80k post tax if he’s lucky.

Pump with 1mil candle but need a 10 mil candle to dump 0.0001 cent. So stupid
[deleted]
Getting pumped by retail buying the dip. Big money waiting for news to drop
Sell off is after Biden is announced winner. All big tech buyers take out their profits and sell shares massively to avoid Bidens high tax cuts
I’m taking a nap. If I wake up and SPY is at 340 I’m buying puts
You're catching on

It’s not gonna dump til my stop loss for puts hits. Sorry bears.
You heard it here first - Biden wins 300+, no crazy shit happens today, Trump concedes tomorrow, stocks go up, I finally buy a new Yaris EOY.
Mmmh BABA 👅
Not a yolo but I'm holding the calls 11/6 I have until tomorrow.  Down 25% at the moment.  About to just go back to bed until lunch lol.
Damn your comments just keep aging terribly 😅
BABA is about send me to the breadline

Not huge trading volumes, which means that it is us retards and retail traders trading. Institutional traders are probably on the sidelines, watching the election

Holy shit SWBI RGR VSTO (gun & ammo stocks pumping 3%+.). Its bigger than “liberals winning make gun stock moon.” Civil unrest will make it truly rocket. I know liberals (and see liberals all over reddit) that are buying guns in fear. A market segment that would otherwise never purchase guns. 

Ez calls bois. Ez calls.
Imagine not having tech calls
Red candles are illegal apparently
Even Draftkings is up
ACB is kind of a penny stock joke but a Biden win would be great for the cannabis market. I think a few states like new jersey and south dakota have legalization on the ballots too. Although SD may not pass it. Calls on THCX are on my mind but I'm unsure
You know, with the extremely strange day ahead and the likelihood that nothing coming will make sense, you could've just as easily said "nah, fuck it" and taken a day off. But you didn't. Thanks for coming through, man.
Everything is mooning while Apple acts like a cripple
If you aint holding PLTR leaps, you hate money
Chinese govt stopped the IPO of ANT Finanicial
Oil and health insurance spiking, you don’t even need to read the election results to me, I know.
Bull trap
Ant IPO halted by Chinese regulators
Ban me then pussy or shut the fuck up
Its not doing anything.
Nows a good time to start hedging. MMs are gonna chop ur head off anytime
hmm, if only there was some world changing event between now and when your puts expire that might provoke instability and save them
Selling $30 puts is probably the smart move.  Buying OTM short-dated calls is the WSB move.

I have 1/2022 $10 leaps.  The greeks on it make it so it's basically the same as owning the stock with a bit of leverage.
That is extremely cheap. I don’t know much about these cars but that is a bargain
Mmm sweet baba discount

BABA calls? And is it too late for tesla?
Dang, all my entries just straight blown out of the water.
Screw Ant IPO, this is good for my SQ. GayPal is relevant.

Buy calls with expiry that is further out. Apple always recovers back up to their 2T market cap, in time.
Speculation of a Biden win, he would be a lot less likely to retaliate with China than Trump.
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in ceiling fan
spy calls printing
SPY RSI has stayed above 76 for over 23 mins now. Got it to pump up on this low volume. Looks like printers are back on boys.
50k/ month isn’t that much money. Sure, it’s very good but I’d certainly be pissed if I lost $300k in a year like this. This is like a years salary for your 50k/mo when you account for taxes.
I think my Robinhood account must have been hacked. I keep adding money in but my portfolio keeps dropping.
Loooooool u r fuk
Ok, but I'm up over 200% on LK. Kicking myself in the ass for not buying more of a fraudulent, bankrupt, shitty company.
Why did baba crash?
Cash out and re-invest your profits. C’mon man
Yesterday market was pricing in Biden win now it looks like its swung into Trump win? Yesterday guns down weed up, today guns up weed down??
IV up on Green Day? What that mean??🧐🧐🤓
I’ve got an extra 1k to throw into the first decent play idea commented below
This, man some people are so retarded. When was oil the highest last? During Obama years, less supply means higher price. But people can only think in terms of “they took errr jobs”
Their competition on the world stage might be falling out of favor in China.  The Europoors are asking the US to be bffs again so they can afford the things they laugh at us for not having.  Today is great news for Bezos.
[deleted]
98% we don’t know who won for at least a week, probably longer and you silly bulls are out here buying calls. F
Its all a percentage nothin more
Should have gotten way more BABA dip I guess
Not even 1M volume on SPYs first candles. Something is gonna happen.
PYPL is up like 50% since COVID hit. If ya can't make money in this market, it ain't the market.
Congrats who got baba at dip. Fuck ccp
Dammit, my puts for 11/6 are gone.

Ok, sorta leaning bullish right now. I need a play and I have none. What is the play! NIo puts? SPY calls?
Guess we pump on nothing again
holy shit BABA 3dte puts premium  looking so juicy
I guess "U ain’t black” is not working
when people say the market is forward looking they arent kidding

I guess I'm a bull now

PLTR straight up.  New meme stock

Bull trap or election priced in?
Which cannabis stock are we buying calls on boys?
Seems a little flat during open hours right now though. I guess everyone has made their bets and hedges and is waiting to see what happens tonight/next couple of weeks maybe
Contested election? Biden's new capital gains taxes if he wins? Reduced stimulus if trump wins?


There's more uncertain than certain
PLUG 🔌 💰💰
APPS

Probably good to short SPY right now
It’s just pandering, because they know Trump was going to win a record number of black voters this time around. Probably 15+ percent
Hold another 20 minutes or so it’ll tank
touch yourself with them

$PLTR $11 calls are cheap! Get weeklys
It's max pain for bears this week. good thing I hedged with calls at open yesterday.

weedstocks and calls are keeping my portfolio green. really green. weedstocks out of nowhere.
If tomorrow goes smoothly this is probably the dawn of the next bull run.
Ban.
who?
Anybody else following MRCY earnings?
I'm literally betting that it won't be flat this week for the elections, and yet I'm still feeling fuk.
Take a look at TeleTrader Webstation https://www.teletrader.com/Products/WebStation
We've been using it for about a year or so after we decided BB was simply too expensive.
OFC it's not exactly the same, but so far I havent really found anything missing. Excel plug-in works fine.
Price is somewhere around USD 5k USD, so way lower than BB

can't say I won't enjoy your income source evaporate in a couple years :)  
if thats even true lmao, since your post from a year ago stated you borrowed that money from your friends. But that was obviously a joke right?
I've been looking for a financial advisor that works at a movie theater for some time now. Glad to come across this post

In red China fraud is priced in
Fake pump or what
is that seriously the lowest SPY is gonna go today is 333.18?!
Do I sell my spy puts and take what I can or do I hold and lose everything? 
Hold it is
Who fucked with the FED by buying puts yesterday

His YouTube ad is at least 5 minutes long and the best part is - he spends the whole ad telling you how successful he is and that you can be too.. if you just follow his strategy “by clicking the link to watch the FREE webinar”

Poor people: think theyre middle class because theyre embarrassed about being poor and want to fit in.

Rich people: think theyre middle class because their neighbors have bigger mansions, boats and cars then they do.

Ive seen countless examples of actually poor and actually rich people try to pretend they're middle class lmao
Honestly don’t know what to do with my puts expiring on Friday fml

That possibility doesn't exist. I'm coming back to congratulate you on making bank.
i would be thrilled with $23-25 at this point
GET FUCC COMMIES
Stock market crash was 1929
evangelicals?? lmao....gonna be a crazee month for sure no matter what
Kinda funny how Kamala Harris had 1% after primaries but they selected her to win the black vote but then Biden and other white people started telling black people who to vote for and it worked against them and now the support isn’t there anyways. Lol
Funny how I almost gave a shit.
Jack Ma criticized China's stock exchange. Shit might just go down hard.
Show me a pay stub for 50k I quit my job and I come work for you
Cause he might cripple supply, dumdum
Really but what did you have cause you at least lost 100k before that trade
Best way to learn lol
I sold my SPY puts at open. So SPY will die down later today. Down 60%. Give me some long dated calls. Is NIO that good?
Big money exited in the last few days of Oct.
Until it’s $0 can’t go lower than that
My past month I’m down 33% 🤡

Is there any way to make money off the impending IV crush that doesn't involve me selling naked options
Ok have fun not making gains
been staring at green candles for 3 days now this is wild
[removed]
Sucks to be too poor to even ask for rich knowledge
We buying anything today or waiting until dust settles tomorrow? I’m eye fucking SEDG and BABA hard
I messed up this dip by a few days.  I bought too early and then ran out of cash to keep buying as the market kept dipping.  Even with all that, I ended up printing money if we stay at current levels.

If this market is truly coiled to go to 360 on the SPY then I am well positioned and wish I had more cash to invest.
Oh shit someone got carried out pre-market. Look at SI, poor guy got filled at $29. Market price is $23.
Well I'm not seeing a lot of buying or selling pressure right now. The calm before the storm maybe
Yea same. I dont see a retarded valuation run up, but 20% LEAPs are a good play.

Bro fuck this shit
Its not about candidates, its about the senate. 

Right now dem sweep = good for stimulus and covid prospects. 

Dems holding house is near assured, president is very likely biden. Senate needs 3/7 tossup seats to go blue for dem majority. 

If you think the dems will sweep, todays uptick will continue. If republicans hold the house buy puts because todays market hype falls flat.
Yes WMT is definitely going to go up until it doesn't anymore, at which point it will go down
rug pull at 336
Moron. Why tf would you pick ACB. If you picked CRON or CGC I'd be hoping you make money. ACB?! I hope you lose every dime you wasted on that shit
If Biden is winning how come Oil is up like 10% in a week?
It’s been under performing the market for the last 4 months even when it’s been performing at its best. What makes people think winter holidays will be any different. People know it’s going to do well in the holidays. At this point what’s going to break it up higher? Not sure
If SPY doesn’t start tanking within 20minutes definitely buying puts...same pattern as yesterday....
What time SPY going negative?  You know it’s coming
Finish your mission private.

Do we really need to wait for tomorrow for INTC to die?
AMZN is refusing to go with the flow
It's the expectation that the election will be over soon
The market will shift. Volatility will impact the S&P/DJIA. No matter who wins, you'll see the volatility. This is a good buying time as the value of stocks won't change but their price will.
My bills are like 5k a month lmao its not hard to sell a $20 product to 1000 people every month with a few diff products 😂

Buy high, sell low
What did I do to deserve this
Third down, VIX looking, pumps once, fires across the middle and he's lucky that one isn't picked off. So they'll have to punt it here and not a very encouraging first drive for Michael VIX, we'll see if they can make some adjustments to get him more comfortable on the next series

why is DKNG and MGM doing so well? Virus cancelled?
Lol You Know how I know this market is fake and gay? SPY RSI since open has stayed above 76 for 15 mins straight.

holy shit DKNG lets gooo
No
Metal gang
Why is JD tanking? Just cause it is Chinese and linked to BABA??
Every day I look at AMZN to make myself feel better about selling it when it was 3400.
I think it heard you
i legit bought paypall calls at ath kill me
I’m in shambos
It was the Biden worker that caused the accident in Texas
155C 1/20/23
Lol this is the third time the dip has convinced this whole subreddit the market is crashing. We got June 11th, September 3rd, and now October 26th. I guess the CEO of SPY can’t pay out all of those puts.
BABA eventual dump after earnings is gonna a great buying opportunity
Biden will fix baba
Op must be a mega douche. Could you radiate enough small dick energy?
So we back to full bull or still bear/cash gang?
Welp SPY put did not turn out well at all. I sold a put to reduce the loss a little but that kinda hurts

I think it’s just the institutions that trade it with each other mostly. Activision made a ton of money this year and will continue to do so next year with all this stay at home order, yet the stock looks like it’s purposely kept  low
Sold outta my tsla calls early but I’ll take the 250%
Guys I don’t think we are going to crash anymore
the difference is that this is still 300k we are talking about. and unless you are 100% certain that you have guaranteed job security for the next decade it is probably not a good idea to set that much money on fire
Weird flex but ok 👌
Plus American. Big if Biden win
I think we hit 450 by friday if Biden wins cause he likes EVs :)
My risk management practice is going well yet somehow I just yolod hard into ACB. Oh well let’s go, weed!
I like it
BABA calls👀
Right now tbh Americans just woke up
I remember reading something like 90% of millionaires don't consider themselves to be rich. People tend to move goal posts on themselves because it's easy to look up at the guy above you and realize the gap. People rarely compare themselves downward.
There’s no “easy 3k a day”

I have 8K to spend what do I get?
CVS gang checking in.
That Ant news really fucked them
You’re right, if this is the Great Depression Era. $1500 now won’t get you a reliable car these days. Not only are the feds to blame, but also the automotive industry, tech industry, and the manufacturing industry inflating their prices too. The only thing that has really stayed with inflation or below is the price of oil/gas.
He should have went long on that Roadster. They're worth upwards of $200k today.
Jack himself? Chinese government?
TSLA just said fuck your puts
I have been bagholding 100 shares since it was DPHC, but youre fucked if you think theyre a Nikola.

Largest IPO fraud ever happening this morning and it's part of the largest publicly traded company in China and 5th most valuable company in the world and the world markets are gonna be like

"I'm gong to ignore this is happening"
I agree but it seems so obvious I have a feeling it’ll just hover right around where it is all day just to fuck with people
They’re different people?
BLEED APPLE BLEEEEEEEEEEEEED WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS RETARDED BULL SHIT
Tomorrow is the biggest stock market crash in the history of November 4th 2020 crashes
I hope, holding 75 shares of that crap at 230 and was feeling pretty good about it.
Electronics and all the fancy safety shit cars have now make them hella expensive.

Whats the difference between this and a normal person losing 10k in the market? Lol
Either moon or drill already
If you're gonna buy 100 shares of TSLA when the time is right your gonna need a souped up DeLorean and the help of Christopher Lloyd
Second rip tomorrow maybe after profit taking?

This shit is moving sideways
Was watching nio at 2$ hahaha and then I saw it 1 week ago almost 40 😂😂
GME most obvious dip to buy
50K a month pretty great, what do you do ?
I truly hope there are no riots if trump wins because they have 100% 1000% 10,000%  not priced in the fact the cops were waiting to see if he would win before they started shooting back for real. Just saying
Is this the beginning of the next rally?

That would have to be a long hold to go back to the green.
Once Again theta Gang has won
ATVI sucks so much. Glad i bought puts on this bitch. Everyone under the sun says to buy it. Yet it still goes down. Love the company but it’s 93% institutionaly owned which means it’s being dumped. Don’t be duped by the analysts go with the trend and flush this shit at least let the MMs pay you on the way out

Not true, the popular vote will be significant. Trump can only claim fraud if it's very close.

4:20
to all BABA dip buyers, 276 is a gap fill point just warning you
All in puts fuck the haters
What can I get puts on for this week if I don’t wanna do SPY?
But your vote really matters for state and local issues which usually effect you more than who is president.
So many bears in denial it’s crazy just let it go
anyone buying baba fds

BABA TO 250
Net at open would have been the move
buy spy puts
i dunno...tough one, this may be last day ever that tsla sees 400s....
This just rattled me haha. I had to look up their stock because I refused to believe they could possibly still be in business and listed. Wild. Good luck bro. That business is doomed for sure.
No, Q4 might be different though. Revenue from the consoles and Microsoft agreement can boost stock price. The intrinsic value to GME stock price is stupid low right now
Bruh! Why not?
Fuck jack ma and his stupid mouth
Don't use RH
time travel. what could possibly go wrong?
Buy everything
cute
Fire sale?
i'm stuck riding RKT until the wheels fall off
SEDG gonna V shape
19c/27c debit call spread. wide spread because i'm bullish af
When we buying back into BABA? This may be a life changing opportunity
Haha it's probably not that big of a deal. Criticising the executive branch of the Chinky government is where the execution starts.
Dude dw, at the risk of jinxing shit I think March 4th (or for that matter, Oct 13th, 1987) is a pretty useful guide to understand the volatile up moves across the market today
I think the smart money is betting on a Biden win and that would be good for the market
😂 it means no one is interested in buying your shitty contracts.
We really are living in a meme
My secret is that I'm a retard 🥴
Who is still selling BABA at -9%, fuck
So here's VIX on first and 10, flushed out of the pocket, nowhere to go and he throws this one away. They got to him with the pass rush and there was just nowhere to go with that one
Vote for Powell
Amazon need some milk
They have a dope penguin exhibit, but yeah I can see why a lot of people hate them

Been like that since March, it's crazy.

Technically. But 538 has his odds at less than 1% if FL goes Biden
Holy shit baba
Expected my VIXY to be down a lot more.

This trade might still print

How much longer is AMZN bleeding for ?
Waiting with bated breath on what the initial hype bots have to say about it. 

Will the manufacturing advantages of being designed by a 3 year old still be in play?

Will the addition of rear view mirrors ruin the asthetic? 

Will actual windows that can withstand a gently thrown rock increase costs too much?

The mechanical programming behind the human mind is the same across the board.



So you can probably jump into any timeline and people will act/behave the same, behind the layers of cultural conditioning etc.


But inside the sphere of personality the mechanics will move the same, just different landscape.
I don't give a shit about stocks... I only buy stonks

dude its hilarious how wsb actually turned bearish at the right time, BUT so many got greedy and cocky. some dude yesterday said the market makers set up a perfect put play for us. not even what a market maker does :D :D

it was obvious vix at 40 was peaking, people were short vol, us economy is recovering. election uncertainity can only do so much... and many people were right to call fear sentiment dropping the markets, but long term december or even 11/20 calls are gonna win.
🥭 sounded like he needed some milk on fox today. Low Energy.
FUCK U TD
Oof thank god I sold out of my BABA calls last week. Those things would be worthless today
SQ?
Just got a notification, why is BABA down 8%?
With what positions. Baba has me down 50
This is such a fake general bump. Everything is basically up 1.5% all together

I don’t even know how I got there tbh I think I was watching JRE with Alex Jones and they were talking about it there, then I watched a Trump speech at the WEF and I went through the WEF upload history and just saw that they are openly advocating for a great reset

Yeah learn a triangle from guard. I think what they mean is raise both arms above your head with finger tips touching, to form a triangle which makes attackers think you're in a Sacred Order of The Eye of Providence and they will worry about their families if they harm you.
Thank god I did not buy BABA yesterday

Please tell me Elon is trying to mine this or something
Lol. Waaaay different. Weed is an actual product, not a service.
Kinda cringe you can't read into carrying on the joke you started but ok.
So you are no longer planning to buy when it's down but were planning to buy when it was up? Isn't that quintessential WSB?

Isn't all of this stuff priced in?  Everything thinks stocks are going to be sold off, but if that was the case, then everything should already be priced in.  

Buying calls.
Imagine starting with $1.00 and then someone takes .90 and you have .10. THEN someone gives you back .05 and you’re at .15 from your start of $1.00. That’s what you sound like when you say tech making big gains today

You need to learn to trade like us professionals hwre, and but 11/6 puts not 11/4 and watch is lose value for more days before expiration.

Unless I’m overlooking something, a fracking ban would drive up the cost of oil and thus the stock value of those surviving companies. Plus, Biden isn’t going to do anything drastic like that. Oil is needed and cheap oil makes the populace happy.

Train your UFC when you get a chance today boys. 

Once the results come out, it's not gonna be pretty, and you might need to defend yourself. Plan on jumping into the middle of the riots and lying down on your back like a baby.

I think what he meant is that there are people with $3000 who will book 5 nights @ $500 a night, and be broke after their trip. They’re comfortable doing it, because they’re financially illiterate. 

Then there’s the dude making fucking bank who doesn’t even consider anything less than $400-500 a night. Comfortable, and financially literate.

Oil has tanked forever under Trump. The market is assuming the following: Conditions are so friendly to Oil right now that supply is too high and it's too easy to produce. Biden's combo of tightening regulations and also huge spending on infrastructure could trigger both a decrease in supply and increase in demand, leading to rising oil prices.. very good for the likes of XOM and co.

Hey its you again, I'm that complete fool that thought there was a chance yesterday could be green, and then you were a condescending jackass, but hey you said you'd tell me why the markets been bleeding for 2 days today so lay it on me
Actually, that was my plan- I have been buying my calls during or right after earnings calls/drops. Made out like a bandit on Netflix calls I bought during the earnings calls tank, and then sold them later that day when they announced the price hike and jumped back up. I tried to dump FLWS yesterday at market open but couldn’t unload before it dropped
How do you know you weren’t sleep walking, murdered someone, came home, got in bed, and just woke up there?

Oil is ready for a rebound, forward thinking into next summer after vaccine. Q4 will see production cuts and industry pullback sending WTI up a bit. I'm guessing sustainable $50+ after late winter
Yeah exactly. I was so worried, it felt like the dream lasted forever too. It was awful
if it dips to 154 im buying with everything i have
On the same boat. Need the market to tank ASAP.

So, if republicans hold the house stocks will go back down.
SPAC don't do so well these days after NKLA

This could be the biggest non-event for the market in U.S. history
Hedging isn't as fun when it turns out to be the wrong move.
NIO has huge potential for grow; it is planned to enter European market around June 2021.
This picture looks like ~~1928~~ 1929. We got off the gold standard in 1971.

We had pretty crazy inflation during those 40 years too. I’d think the real driver has been the industrial revolution.

Shoulda bought calls
Lmao. Inverse yourself and make the bank. Why do you think oil is mooning right now? It's because they are betting on a Biden win.
I was thinking of posting it at market open, unless someone else has that spot booked already
Buy the dip?
Big Puck is gonna pop, what are the plays?
get boeing longs, boeing is america!
Nah, just fascinating to watch. also fuck earning plays
oh fuck you might be right
Grabbing 11/6 320p at open, so yall should get calls
Who's going all in baba at open?
To some that is a nightmare. To others that is a dream.
It's not as easy as u think. Will he cripple american supply or demand harder? And which one first?
Maybe someday we’ll hit the bottom and get back to pumping :(

Wait what? 😂 that was an actual post
I would think so... no earlier than 20Nov imo
I’ve had a few of those when I was younger. It’s always dope to wake up after because I didn’t like those dreams
I’m holding spy puts that expire tomorrow and I’m fucking shitting bricks
Ant ipo suspended
lol SPY up 4 wow
[deleted]
China isn’t letting their biggest company stay down, incredible buying opportunity
So glad I went cash instead of buying puts Friday. Knew this shit was possible
what's their price / earnings again? I also love elon, but markets overshoot all the time, and they did, majorly, with TSLA.
I have no idea what to do with my January aapl calls.....
Are y’all retarded? We’re so green why would spy calls be fucked?
Buying baba calls or puts for earnings now?
load up on cannabis! it’s gonna crash eod
Did you get that panicked feeling "oh shit, I'm going to prison forever."

That's how mine go and they suck.
Ma has been summoned by regulators

Anyone ready to trust DKNG again? Maryland and South Dakota have sports betting on ballot and earnings are next week.
Yea, Walmart was the local shop killer in the same way that Amazon is the Big Box killer. 

But given the crap quality counterfeits and review mills, people are slowly going back to local shops (or etsy, etc), homegrown quality, DIY goods. 

Full circle.

In my experience it tastes better,  a vast improvement in freshness. Little extra kick in the go button as well. My garden also likes it as food to begin the year.  

I like Organice Native Coffee company and Split Oak coffee company. They both tend to send a free sample with your purchase.
TL;DR?
Weedies 🤟
What's with the weed stock hype? Did I miss something?
My problem with my model 3 is that the tires barely make it to 20k miles
C'mon AMD. Today might be the day. It better be. Fucking Lisa couldn't wait a week for this to run up more before announcing mergers. 🤬
Where is bottom for PYPL from here? The 100 SMA has been solid support over the past few months, but it blasted through that in overnight trading. 200 SMA at $154 or so next?
Popping 1%+ at open. Big buying today, the dip was last week
[deleted]
Market is going to be flat/slightly gain today. Tonight and tomorrow it will pump. Rest of the week will pump too

Market just wants to know who's going to be the next president and we will find out tonight (keep dreaming those of you who want it to be contested)
Good call. My calls are getting fuk right now but I expect things to change today.
buy stocks
Risked A LOT in the beginning (almost my whole net worth back then, $7k) but after I touched 6 figures, I decided to only play stocks and utilize margin instead of options so it would be more forgiving to take paper losses; not to mention, no theta decay/IV crush and the ability to sell covered options to recoup premium during flat weeks/months.
we all know Biden doesn’t have that kinda strength anymore
Nothing is guaranteed, but that sounds like a good risky play
My ears
Waste of money too, you are technically behind because of inflation and jpowpowpowrightinthekisser

It’s a Brexistential Crisis at this point
Not any time soon. I think it’s an overreaction.
Should have sold Monday.  Buy spy calls on open
It was because the retard talked about his ant shit was better than the government. How slow and bad the government banks are. Fucking retarded fuck. He fucked me too while fucking himself
Should I dump my AAPL calls that I'm slightly up on this morning and buy more weed calls? No idea what tech is going to do.
Printing bigly
This place has gone soft.

Really hope the market tanks so my UVXY calls will print, DFEN will tank, and I can load up on more cheap shares
[deleted]
I have money but will probably sit this out. No clue what to buy. Averaged down on a bunch of positions.

Edit: AMD still attractive though. March calls?
I view DKNG and CGC as having essentially the same EPS opportunities moving forward, maybe a slight edge to DKNG due to current # of competitors.

but DKNG is at ~14.5 billion market cap, and CGC is near 7 billion. 

one or more likely both of these stonks are quite mispriced.
Yeah 29 break even.
What do you own?
Literally a coin flip
No. Only for political bearshit
Should have sold Monday
Omg I just had a nightmare that I killed someone in my sleep. You have no idea how relieved I'm that if was only a dream...
In my darkest hours I think of that clip and chuckle
Welcome home
Oil seems to be the most pure play on the election. Biden winning would be terrible for the industry.
haha yeah man this stuff is a pain in the ass. Take it from me, just like everyone here I've gained and lost.  I believe what will happen is if you sell covered calls with your shares as collateral, for example, is if the sale strike price hits you'll lose the shares at the price you sold the options for. So basically someone gets them on sale and you're out the shares.  You have 100 shares of Apple, sell an option for $125 and the stock hits $130, you lose the shares for $125 to the person that bought your option.

Theta is the fucking devil. It's a fact of life. I like holding most of my options with at least a month or two before expiration so I can have some type of advantage on Theta but it ain't much... I try to only "yolo" weeklies with a small amount just for fun to see if something hits but it's a small % of my gambling portfolio.

quick, you got 15 mins
Excellent entry .. they will “work this out”
So FOMO into baba?
It was a good run
Fucking hell this guy called it
Should I sell my UVXY weeklies by EOD today or hold them?
Invest directly in ANT after it ipo's or just get BABA?
I know
You'd think robots make this shit cheap

guys what the FUCK happened to baba
You forgot to add the upcoming million-dollar inheritance.
Thanks for the work.  🙏🏼
because it usually does this, it will do the opposite
People have very short attention spans. IF political shit can stop circulating in Twitter and FB just a little, it could really help

There’s gonna be profit taking today. Timing that will be key. I’m willing to lose 10% of my account to take these risks. Let’s do this.
What is happening to Baba
CRON, CGC, TLRY, and ACB and any other weed stock you can think of are gonna ride out like its earnings
Yeah, the market will generally care a lot more about control of Congress because that's where actual policy is made that can impact markets

By setting stop losses you basically never lose money. It's why no one loses money on wallstreet. Stop losses are the fucking tits.

good bot. What a neat concept.
hooker with a penis
Look at break even on expiry - that factors in for the total price of the option and how much intrinsic value needs to be built to match the price of the option.
What are the ticker symbols for the spread and your iron stuff?
it didnt even destroy earnings like that tho...not like paypal and them, people just thought wayfair was dead and it happened to meet expectations

edit: i sold my calls yesterday :(

What the fuck is a stop loss?
Actually true
Why do you hate making money?

The volatility is worth it
Okay, so does this mean that it'll hit $100 by EOB today? Great, i'm in, 1st thing in the morning!
What do you watch?
Because oil is still needed for everything. Airlines are getting busier, ships still need it. Countries (Saudis, Iraqis, etc.) highly rely on it for their budgets and they won’t let it collapse. They would rather go to war over it.
FOMO. Buy some TSLA calls or something dude

China waiting for election results before allowing Ant ipo to go forward? or is that way to dumb

Same bro. And AMD calls
Yup... TSLA.

If baba make it back to $300 today I’ll be fine...
Future do matter
Not in debt. And potentially about to have a windfall due to cashing out another investment. But this is good advice and it’s always a good reminder.

gotcha. Thanks
Just a friendly reminder that the stock market only gives a fraction of a fuck about who the president is
Lol
If you’re not buying spy puts you aren’t black
It’s not about Chinese companies, it’s a problem with China and government as whole. Most untrustworthy people on earth
Feels like those lines are cutting my eyes! 👀
Fuck bulls and bears. Monke gang represent.
Do people like enjoy tanking stocks, sometimes for no reason at all?
This is the same sentiment all the Tesla call holders were like the Tuesday morning after the split.
Because apparently green new deal = EV stonks go up

Thats what I'm thinking
I would be so disappointed if with everything going on we stay flat through election outcomes
Poor apple
Ok u must be a genius tell me what ur move is today
did you risk alot or did you start small?
Hi all, just a quick note to say if you base your plays solely on what people say on this board then you deserve to be inaugurated as Trumps bidet. He likes high pressure so I suggest you start working on your water blowing technique you sack of retards. 

The only certainty in this pandemic is that people will die, airlines are fucked and the high quality chinese stocks will always weather the storm. Never forget to wash your asses folks. New findings have come out that people that only wipe with paper are 500000% more likely to not get their assholes eaten more than once by the same person. Hope this helps. 

If I were you I would wire transfer me all of your money so I can make your parents proud, then I will build a school to educate your children as to why their parents were such idiots and lost their college tuition listening to some fuds on a sub reddit instead of actually learning and making their own fucking decisions. 

Oh and it goes without saying... Gold and silver will reach all time highs following new stimulus. Instead of burning your money in shit stocks, make some metal plays whilst listening to enter sandman before crying yourself to sleep tonight fuckos.

Ohh, might be a buy for me then
I know
are you guys ready for da volatility?
Lol insiders dumped their shares
Well it is down 7% pre earnings. I think it has more to do with ant group’s ipo being suspended that the technicals

Edit 2: this was meant to be read in the Owen Wilson voice from Royal Tennenbaums.

Wow, China halted Ant's IPO.  That's why BABA's stock is down big.
Good morning everyone, happy ragnarok

A flat market does not make money.
i think itll trade sideways a bit first and then slowly go up
Everything pointing to a breakout at open
Ouch W was up 13% pm
Saw that. Will be buying calls at open

gonna buy tf out of PayPal
I mean Biden does have 4,000 lawyers in Florida and he hasn't even lost yet.  Dude's handlers won't let him concede shit.

It would be foolish for Chinese companies to cultivate that impression. It's bad for investment for them, and wouldn't make business sense.

Stop overthinking this, 

Just👏 buy 👏 calls👏
I know.
Good moves to sell Friday
That too. Owning a gun is not a crime yet why can't we buy them and why are we arrested for carrying them legally? Because there is an agenda. Self defense doesn't exist anymore. According to police they can bully us until we resist then take our lives.
Every perma bear
Im not arguing with the point - I am just pointing out all the things I am seeing right now
You’re talking about a company worth 850 Billions. It will most likely be green eod.

That’s what I’m talking about man. Been trying to tell people too. I bought 40k worth of shares last week. I expect $100 by 2022
Checked my calls before coming here, can now say I had an IRL GUH moment after realizing that BABA price wasn’t a typo
🤡
only thing you need to do today is buy any calls at 11:29am est. and sell for 3x on friday
I'm just worried that it's doing this on the thoughts that Harris/Biden wins, which won't happen.

Better to be prepared. You can always give it to the homeless or a shelter if nothing happens
They just suspended the ANT IPO, which BABA owned 33% of
Oh. Makes sense now
I'm sorry to hear that.  :(  You gotta look at the whole trend.  Almost every big company is dropping even after earnings.  Don't be too stubborn and follow the trend.  I've place put spreads in the last 2 weeks and have made some money despite the selloff.
Because its market cap is so low we could buy the whole company with the loose change in our cars. That makes a stock price bouncy.
Reverse this genius
[deleted]
Your posts are genuinely so helpful.
Where’s the drill?????
No. What is the market cap if you used the ask instead of the bid for the market cap?
If you hate money
Always wanting more I see.
Puts it is

I believe Baba owns 30% of ANT. On a $30B valuation that’s about $10B worth of equity they thought they’d have that they no longer do
[deleted]
Damn straight.

These boomers think us autists actually don’t have feelings. I’m huurt. I can still make 20-40% a week and still only work as much as his dick kid who plays xbox all week hahahhahaaa.

Weed and solar. Maybe fuck around and buy some gold
Selling my nio calls at open and sitting cash for this shit show
Why is BABA drilling?
Baba worth buying?
Baba or Nio call
I buy into different type of snow that clouds my logical thinking
BABA will most likely be okay in days, but I put a good portion in it, so I am stressed.
SPY price too high imo

What happend to Solaredge?
BABA
It’s not about governors reactions as a whole. Whitmer did some weird things that were unique to her response, like banning the purchase of seeds and home construction equipment. Not letting people go to their vacation homes that they pay taxes on. 

Just some odd shit that was 100% unconstitutional. People don’t want to be told “you can’t grow vegetables during a food shortage”
We're selling off at open, right?
Did you buy into SNOW ipo too?
You had entire week last week. Wtf?!
Poots are expensive right now. I can see someone buying today and still losing somehow.
Currently bag holding 30 13.5 puts im somehow down on?

Spacecataz.
WSB: Don't Invest in China stocks because they have no regulation and all the companies are full of fraud!

Also WSB: Don't invest in China stocks because regulators are warning ANT/Baba founder that there will be more regulations applied - see that shows they are frauds!

Edit: Also WSB right now - Invest in China Stocks because of Biden!
I haven’t been this anxious for a market day in a minute
If you're looking for a serious answer- propaganda. Biden ain't seizing the means of production, bro
asians too.

And got shut down
Only if it’s weed or Chinese stocks imo.
Time for the spy to die
Buying today or tomorrow, selling before earnings
Shit we have our fair share of drawbacks but in other parts of the system. Can't win them all. Someone without insurance going to the emergency room will pay what youre paying on commish and then some lol
Press F for all the VIX call holders
Die
Guilty of this my self. Shit feels so bad, seeing your ticker skyrocket after buying puts hurts so much :(
They know the truth about communism
so what happened to baba
Yes, you were correct to hesitate
Because too many people went short last week. Thats the only reason we going up rn
You overestimate how much effort people are willing put into fact finding
When they say they don't care about them it means that if you fall short on one or a few of them it's okay. They don't mean they rank short, broke limp dick higher than 6ft rich dude. 

They're basically looking for something beyond those 'basic" things a few of which you can lose out on

Someone said yesterday, just because it seems too obvious to buy Vix calls, buy VIx puts instead. Next time I see a post that says do the thing that doesn’t make sense, I’m doing it.
More people buying calls vs puts, what’s not to get?
Nobody  is trusting chinese anymore
What happens if u eat cashews 1 year past expiration? Asking for a stomach
It might see below $10.

Their govt's give them stimulus.  Lockdown is easy to shrug off when you still make like 80% of your wage.
It's like IV crush, there's only a few days of serious uncertainty left and as nothing happens stocks go back up.

This is the event and if it goes over without any massive fuckups, which is pretty likely, then stocks will rise - even regardless of who wins.

investors begging for an entry point
Yes. Just how does mutex work, is the real question 🤔
XOM put a green month on the board with red crude and red indexes. It really might have bottomed out.
Gold is manipulated so much. I had calls for GLD and was making $2000 profit when this stimulus discussion started. I ended up selling my calls making $50. Good thing because I would have lost money if I hadn’t sold it.
Guys. Do you not read the articles filtered to your picks? Or watch any news? Don’t ask why BABA is down. If you can read this, I believe in your abilities to read elsewhere.

Yes
Isn’t it funny that Venezuelans, Cubans, South Americans predominantly vote red..why is that, huh?

Put a kazoo in your ass, make it festive.
That baba news was a fucked up way to start the morning
How would that relate to shanghai exchanges? I realize you can buy baba or an etf that may wind up with exposure. But you’d have to have an international brokerage account to get ant stock direct.
[deleted]
If you think the polls are way off and Trump is close enough to drag things out but not so clearly ahead that Biden concedes early, then sure. Seems like a tight needle to thread at this point.
Oof. Your going to regret that
Instead of buying puts, get a $100 haircut at a nice barber shop, maybe that’ll help 😁
Gonna need baba to keep drilling for calls!

**9AM LETS HAVE A GREAT DAY EVERYONE AND GOD BLESS AMERICA**

Highly doubt they will cancel the ipo especially 2 days before it was supposed to go live. Sounds like a shakedown to get what they want, all will be back on track soon.
the price is way too low

they are bout as smart as someone that sees a hole in the ground and decides to stick their dick in it.
Losing money is in the family. Just like how my great grandfather moved from Italy to Ethiopia to start a trucking business on the eve of world war 2, losing it all after the state took all his trucks for the war effort.
Wait till they find out NIO is just a mobile game

It’s amazing how so many people in the country are freaking out over who the president’s gonna be and all anyone here cares about is Apple’s stock price going up 2 bucks a share.

Not likely many wanting to hold through this.

Bulls need SPY to open above 334 to hold these gains.
$BABA tanking because it has a 33% stake in Ant Group, which has just had its IPO suspended, and CEO being brought before regulators.

This is why you don't deal with companies involved with the Chinese Communist Party.

Ok listen up, because I don’t give ideas often. AMC is currently at $2.46 a share meaning it’s market cap is like $235 million. If we all pitch in $300 we can do a **WSBs hostile takeover** of the movie theater chain. We can all take turns being CEO for a week, get free popcorn, and bang lots of sloots.. because, you know, we own the place 

Please Venmo me $300 at your earliest convenience so I can get the process start. I call CEO first week

U gotta be good looking and have good manners and be thoughtful and nice and considerate
Ant IPO is being suspended, and BABA jus= dropped 6% pre market.
Anyone playing VFF? Decent volume and a little more under the radar than some of the others. Earnings on the  12th, RH strikes start the 20th so it has some idiot proofing built in.
stop reposting this
An angel got its wings. Buy this bullshit dip.
At this point why would I sell any of my puts down 50% already... I’m gonna hold all 200:) rip
Anyone picking up some BABA ? ANT ipo got suspended
Gonna grab a BABA call this morning..... any date/strike ideas? Thinking 20Nov
HOW DO I CHANGE MY VOTE? IS IT TOO LATE?

I remember someone call me a retard yesterday thinking BABA would go below 300. Who’s laughing now? BABA 230p 1218 is printing
How can you not be more self aware. Literally every generation says this shit about the generation succeeding it. Shut the fuck up, old man.
That would be an interesting take. How about we name it after what she does, and not her name. Something like “Tomb Raider”?

Ok that makes more sense. Well then the people buying those probably already work at Wendy's.

im betting that mango sets interest rates to like 5-10% on news that biden is winning to tell his followers that biden winning crashed the market.  Previously my bet was that the market would go down pre election... NOW that im more OTM on my puts I need more outlandish reasoning 🤕
No way lol
No, I bought leaps when it was $18 tho.
F
Calls on everything, this shit is going to pop.
AMC gonna do it today!
Read again
I have no idea what the market is going to do. maybe im just going to wait I get a good entry 

but probably I just just cant resist the fomo and make an classical entry where I absolutely shouldnt.
oversold on lockdown? this is what Volatility looks like tbh
I've got a couple dozen shares of Cronos I bought a couple of years ago when I started my RH account with lunch money. Mostly as a meme, I bought most of the shares on 4/20 at $6.90.

It went up to twenty-something not long after that. Probably should have sold, but I wanted the meme to live on in my account.
Was thinking the same but damn, Gyna can be hard on stocks and BABA might have more room to fall here.
Lol of corse it’s green. 2020 doesn’t make sense at all . Spy will probably hit 420 today 😤

I basically dont work at all. sadly with corona I cant travel that much for my holidays.
I’m in the same boat
I need $300 lol
Lol baba's cucked going to buy some leaps at discount when things settle down
Simple: it was priced in
Why haven't they announced 100k new cases yesterday yet? The voters must be informed
yea when futures don't go your way they're probably the most irritating thing about the market

Lmao dumb asses buying AMC
See how today goes
Only if the fortunes are tied up in short dated options
Is this Location Location Location?
So. Regulators don’t like baba and ant because of the government backed banks. Potential bailouts if the economy dumps. Other than their government overreaching a smidge, do they know something? Or are they upset people are going through them and they are taking over the industry, away from government banks.
Wayfair such a cuck. 13% to almost red. Rip my call
Fuck yeah this is a blessing. I have diagonal calls I can buy back for pennies. Hopefully it’s back over 290 by next week. But yeah I’ll be buying leaps at open if price is right.
SF the town is beautiful. SF the tech bros and homeless crack smokers not so much.

People buying calls as if 2020 hasn't been the most unpredictable year in modern history.
If you give me 10$ and I give you that 10$ back we can both claim $10 in revenue. If you add inflation then a tiny bit of money was made as "Profit"

lol yeah remember when Trump said he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and his retard supporters would still support him and he was right and then we made him president by the thinnest margin in electoral history during a global moment of rising nationalism and at a time of deep economic inequality. Biden sucks but read a history book loser lol

Todays market makes me nervous, definitely the kinda day that can make or break fortunes easily
lol are you Disturbed about it
What kind of money are you trading with though? 1.5% fee there and back, adds up a lot. Even with just 1k, you spend 15$ commision, and assuming price doesnt change, you pay another 15$ when you sell. THat's expensive. I think it's only worth it if your maybe playing with like under 300$ or something.

Sure looked like the white car tried to cut in to me... but hey thats the beauty of this world we live in two people can see the same thing and have a different opinion on the matter.
Bad week to by baba FDs...... fuck me
Why should it be? There are so many different ways to vote
I’m actually only 20 hahah
Just like the riots were too?
Imagine bulls thinking bears were betting on pre election. The events they betting on weren't scheduled until Wednesday at the earliest.
In the past election day has been slightly green and the day after is red, but 2020 has shown that anything can happen.

Sell put -290

Buy put +289
europe is bullish that they are about to replace the US in economic status
If you can hold off until the afternoon, I'm thinking you might find a better opportunity. Its what I plan on doing at least. I figured I'll either get discounted puts, or maybe I dump my cash into a bargain stock and look away for a couple weeks lol
the way it looks contested elections are not priced in at all
It’s only bullish because market priced in worst case scenario last week and now it’s not looking like the election will be close.
All in on nuggets. Even the margin.
Fairish but I believe there is no debate who among these two has the least control over English
Downvote if u bagholding
Is tomorrow the day to go all in on tech? I've been 95% cash for the last month, champing at the bit to get back in to something other than pot lotto tickets
Because China's regulators aren't happy with Jack Ma

And there could be a hot war over Taiwan.

But I already have baba 400 leaps for Jan 2022.
Is Nio gonna get fucked too?
cos we don't care about mango and sleepy
Didn't say fun, just addictive.

Days like today always uncover how many virgins are here
Anyone else buy Corsair in the last couple minutes before close yesterday?

Shit that feels good
Buying calls at the top and buying puts at the bottom. Name a more iconic duo.
The only sure thing in this market is that gme is at the bottom of it's channel with consoles about to drop and still 100% shorted. Don't know why you'd buy anything else rn.
I'm not clear on Boogaloo.

Is it bullish or bearish?
This erection is a super spreader event and we see significant hospitalizations and deaths in three weeks
Did you play them?
What I’m saying though is that the uncertainty hasn’t changed at all since last week.
Have you tried Big Cuck? Maybe something a little more clever like, Cuckie Cheese
MMs are doing their job if you feel like that. Also never go too heavy on the spy puts easy way to blow up an account
Perhaps market is assuming a landslide instead of contested?
AMC are you going to be my SAVIOR!!!!
Webull gives you 3 free stocks.

Ffs why did I stay RH so long? I do belong here
I definitely will be

Which ticker? Uup?
Im so mad at china. Im speechless
no I'm trading us tech stocks. gotta deal with the 1.5% currency conversion fee though
Damn Jack. You should have listed Ant on the NYSE.
JNUG calls at open. Only goes up till it doesn't...
“Basing whole...in Donny throwing a temper tantrum” bro that’s the market nowadays.
So?
[deleted]
I usually buy in quantites of 5 contracts. I day trade 0DTE spy options so I maybe buy 2 a day. Having 5 contracts each so the commision is $29.90 in total, the price of the SPY puts only need to move 7 cents for me to profit. It forces you to be sure that your confident in your trade, because even if you sell at the price you bought at, your down 30$. It fucking sucks. I am trying to get a job in the states (border city), so I can get a visa and get american brokerage. You guys got it easy.
No nut November. We doomed.
If we go higher in the next few days and end the week higher, then I can almost guarantee we’ll see ATHs in November.
U can sell a put spread, if your account allows. OTM or ATM

Uh I’m not the smartest person around but wouldn’t this be a bull trap?
Good thing I bought shares in April. Too bad I bought LEAPs at $299....
Baba is down with the sickness
I think all the catalysts still remain, just delayed.

It's the uncertainty of who will win, as it could dramatically affect the market moving forward. Some may not want to make a play until things shake out. Either way, it's an uncertain future with two potentially wildly different outcomes.
Tell me why i dont go al in on baba 400 leaps mid 2021
On my knees for FB 270
Soon enough we will vote with phones, don't worry. The technology is already here, it's just being used on shitcoin at the moment
This reads like some gay version of The Kiterunner.

Who else is gonna be down a minimum of 2k at open?
VIX is blowing my mind.

I don't get it.
No, I dont think I will.

Unfortunately not
I never knew that contested elections was bullish.
How the fuck is Europe still pumping
0 dollars. I don't buy Starbucks. 
Although if I stopped ordering organic whole bean, fair trade, shade grown coffee off of Etsy...... Probably 600 dollars.

How are European stonks on erection day?
Sometimes life gives you one. I regretted dumping my BABA calls for MSFT two days ago. MSFT March calls may not be ideal, but at least they aren't tanking 8% in the premarket...

Thank you Saint. Elon, Patron Saint of Degeneracy and Retardation. 

(Tempting to load up on BABA leaps now though....)
Baba holders in shambles
Is this the fabled bull trap?
How do you set this up? Do you buy/sell call or buy/sell puts?

neuro atypical
Puts going to pay today if you had them on $BABA
Did everyone have baba calls
Baba is love
I don’t care about Europe bro
Canada reporting. I sure do. Got almost 2lbs this year and it’s very very good. I am giving it away to friends. I have more than I will ever use in a year.
I was all set to come out the closet and throw everything into spy puts today but now I’m having second thoughts..
fuck this guy what a pussy
What a genius
No, just cash. Credit spreads, iron condors, calendar spreads, and butterflies.
Agree r/conservative thinks they can trade now but they don’t even know what Autism is bwahahahahaaa.
This shit was so easy in August
U from the fyuchur!?
[deleted]
I’ve heard this before. Can you explain how gamma will mess me up?
I think they'll all pump today/after hours but one that seems a little more under the radar is VFF.

The general sentiment is that they're a a strong company with good management unlike ACB etc. Also has reasonable volume (&gt; 1M avg) 

They have earnings in the 12th, and the earliest strike on RH is the 20th which forces you to not dive into risky weeklies.

I have some ACB $5 calls that are up 300 percent even though they're a shitty company, but mostly because they're heavily shorted.

I'll probably look into VGG $6C for the 20th as a gamble play.
Oh, so you're not like a wsb retard, you're like a real *retarded* retard?
Yeah it’s almost as if the market doesn’t give a shit about the beer virus anymore. 🤔
Who's got UBER puts?  Doesn't look like prop whatever will pass.
You aren’t very intelligent
Where can I bet on the election?
U short or long?
Puts on my puts
Sounds like what bears were saying in early April.
I would stay away from CGC (and perhaps the whole sector other than day trades) only because earnings are Nov 9, and they could shit the bed
Fanta was the top beverage choice of the nazi party (not even joking)
"MAGA 202020 don't forget that!"
Yea I'm surprised condescending as fuck clickbait makes it passed editorial, its like they want to get shat on and become irrelevant.
Puts for the win. But....I don’t have any. May be calls for the ride up.
Yeah I’ve gone full kang gang this past weeks cuz permabull was killing me
It's not a Tesla; it's worthless.
When do we know about the Senate? Is that tonight or will that be contested?
Mississippi
Most polls had Hillary with a 70-80% of winning in 2016.  The polls were not "wrong," just the less likely scenario won.  Don't forget Hillary dominated the popular vote and Trump won by tens of thousands of votes in just a few states.
And which candidate are we talking about here?
BABA LOL
all you have been spewing here is politics, do you even have positions? or are you just here to praise your orange god, this is a casino, not fox news
Or over 290 lmao
Most other developed countries in the world vote through mail retard.

It's not that complicated.
Tech is dead.
Urban shops closing up shop and Peet’s is kicking their ass in grocery stores.
Buy the brands selling the final product not the grower. That’s like instead of buying Starbucks, buying their bean grower
By what?
Next couple months, you'll  be like I should have bought at 34 when it at 60
Mango is Big Dump.  I hear he wears diapers lol.
My prediction? PAIN
But have you done dmt
Thanks Bae! 😘
depends on which side you're on.  I'm balls deep in puts and I'm just pissed rn, not gonna lie...
Whoops
BABA leaps at open? Will never see it back under 290 again imo
Tomorrow regardless who wins would be the biggest sell the news event ever
GME gang reporting in. Asshole is raw spirits are neutral.
If I were you I’d hold the calls tho. We can get volatility tomorrow depending on the result.
BABA dragging NIO down with it, let go you piece of shit

This.. one roommate works for mango campaign , one for sleepy . Nbd

Noticed that, so is CRON. Both were up ~15% yesterday

Buying baba today
I don't want to see it again so take my upvote and gtfo
Only being allowed to sell in one country that is 1/6 of the world population
I thought there would at least be some vol on Monday/Tuesday of this week.

Makes no sense how they've already priced in a contested election lmao
VOO
Cheers fellas. Today will be an interesting day for the markets and for democracy. I wish you all the best.
Who bought baba yesterday? Show yourselves.
I disagree, I’m even a trump supporter myself but I’ll never hate someone just Bc they support Biden
SPY slipping!
Lmao
Less negotiations done over rage tweeting
this sub was always dumb, that's why we come here
at the end of the day

"futures were higher as investors weighed a host... actually lets cut the bullshit, they're higher because the printing press has been on fire for the last 6 months, and the USD is now essentially monopoly money and nothing fukken matters anymore"

however they cant say this because they will go bankrupt due to lack of headlines for the next 10 years
I never understood this. What exactly is "voter intimidation"? Some one saying "hey you better vote A!" ....like okay. They will have no idea who you voted for for.
When people realize Jack Ma’s new IPO not getting listed has nothing to d with BABA 🤡
You can buy jewelry?
You mean that convoy that safely escorted Biden? Being gentlemen and protecting the completion is what I saw. Didn’t see anyone get run off the road
No one is excited about shares man especially 5k worth of shares. Maybe if it’s 5,000 BABA shares ... shares are long term
I will be buying shares today
BABA broke my heart
What the fuck just happened to BABA?!?
Cash
Negative
I’ve been in SLV since end of July. It was a good lesson not to buy into the hype around here.

Maybe because this is not r/conservative here, it’s like me going to r/weebs and spamming my hardcore midget porn, no one gives a fuk.
Remember when bears swore they had this in the bag. Imagine basing your own whole investment thesis on Dony throwing a temper tantrum, then not selling when you had a chance. The show must go on
I'm just being a scared bitch TBH, not down 100% yet but this gap up has me worried...
Bruh mail in ballots sound so unsafe, how is this still a thing in the modern world? Can't we vote via google form
Futures are addicting as shit to watch.
This did not age well.
yeah but is a recovery likely in the future?
You need to have the capital if it gets exercised. 

Or go margin like a pimp.
no just cash to cover buying those shares
I've been a die hard CRLBF fan. No options and can't trade them on robinhood but they will rule the legal market in due time.
Just voted T and legal weed.
Steve will do it is like YouTube Steve o, less stunts, more alcohol.
Need cash for puts, shares for calls
What does this mean about polls if they end up being wrong again today? Do we just throw the whole industry in the trash?
Long term here is 2 weeks out
fuck that's a gross ass color but i kind like it 

what is that packered stale urine yellow?
Fuck me. I guess I’m in too.
I did yesterday. Should have sold before earnings
My puts are up from yesterday lol. Like printing. Maybe not today but shiddd yesterday them mfers printed.
Eh I think I’m just gonna get out of nio at open
basically what I did. A lot of the cash I manage is just in VOO, since it will pretty much outperform everything going forward in the next 7 years. Lucky for my family I can't buy options on vanguard and just fuck myself daily, while I watch my brother's 529 outperform me by 60%.
Sorry not when the choice can't complete english sentences. You don't have my respect. You have my sympathy because you are getting like 15% of the big picture.
really?
Omg its that price for buying AND selling? I was thinking with that cost buying and selling would be included. How many contracts do you trade a week usually?

Woww, sometimes not pulling the trigger is a blessing. Rip baba weeklies. & obligatory fuck China
If you’re at that much of a loss I’d hold and hope it’s really contested 

They’ll only go from -97 to -99 if it isn’t

If you aren’t selling and collecting these sweet ass premiums this week then idk what to tell you.
$Spy $322 P expiration 11/4
Yep. One contract will cost you around 22$ just in commision after you buy/sell. It's fked. If you pay 90$ a month though you get a "reduced" commision I believe its 6.95$ plus 0.75$ a contract.
It's the opposite in a lot of places. Country is facing extreme polarization.
Fuk you only stick with canadian stocks bud?
We are sitting right at 200 Days moving average.   Either we gonna drill or go to the moon.  Buckle up

Also byedon
I guess it's just people trained to buy the dip now after seeing every dip bought up since April
Honestly how did people think we were going to pay for the stimulus? lol
Trumps $750 didn’t even cover one $1200 stimulus

opinions on holding UVXY calls through election night hoping for a contested/delayed election?
This is the way.
I have heard liberal economists argue against the corporate tax. It makes more sense to tax people. With a corporate tax small shareholders pay the same tax rate as billionaires. Not sure they will raise the corporate tax rate. Capital gains...
Wasn’t 🐜 going to list in Hong Kong, too? Could this still happen on Thursday?
Shorted it above 94.1

All I need it is DXY below 93 by weekend
i mean, thats expected lol.  mail ins are expected to favor biden

maybe not 2.5:1 expected, but expected to favor mango
I suggest doing it on XSP as its Cash settled so you dont have to worry about assignment.  If you are using lots of contracts,  use SPX
Tied of buying spy puts. It never really moves. Give me stocks to day trade puts on for today
The people that wanted to get out for the election did so last week. Now it’s smart money buying the dip.
Positions or gtfo retard
Don’t fall for bear trap.
Your a fucking idiot if you think the market should be up
I was bullish yesterday. Getting too hyped up tho now.. gonna throw at least a little chunk into put on SPY or something
Def fish sticks
Up a little over $200k, started doing this last year.
when have trump supporters rioted at all during the past 6 months??? They are actually more civilized, it's the biden supporters that lack charm and *Savoir faire*

Where is all the bearish comments listing their 15 reasons why the market is down at??
🐂 gang now 🦧 gang
Why TF wayfair cuck? 290 to 270 just like that
he will payoff a driver with liquor
Nothing is actually going to happen today.  Fireworks start tomorrow.  Keep eyes peeled for Biden win with a republican senate.  That’s the most bearish outcome imo
Advantage of US is stable infrastructure. A reliable president will be good for stocks.
Yes, just saw on Twitter
I used to work construction in the SF Bay Area. A guy in Pac Heights bought a house and then bought the house behind his house, then leveled that house because it was blocking his view. That’s FYM to me. Or I’ve been on jobs where the homeowners pay $2500 in utilities alone and that’s FYM for sure
Make it 10% instead of 15%
Why come to Reddit to just post Tweets?
King
83 DOllars is max loss
1k spy puts, sq puts, vxx calls
I would win
Noice
Puts at 9:40 boys. This shits going down
Whoever is doing no nut November be a dear and send your girl to me
Ban all posters from the usa here please. Cant trust people's plays when 99% of them vote for a zombie as president. Thats like buying leaps on oil
ShitFrancisco?
dear lord, is that really what you pay over there?
Today is going to be red with tech leading us down. I’m literally bull gang for life tho
🐻 who prepped for bloodbath are fucked!!
[deleted]
on in person votes?
Was 12%
Was a bit grumpy last night. Earnings puts might not be the worst idea. Rest of November this stock will move like a fat girl on an ice rink... but like in the opposite direction.
I’m bag holding. Their call was bullish as fuck so I’m hopeful
Bruh your sense of money has is gonna be fucked from early
I live in SF. Whole city feels like one big dorm room. No one wants settle down there. Everyone wants to get out once they make enough money, start their own thing, till remote work is the norm etc., Very shallow conversations, too many men, tech on every billboard, filthy, too many rich assholes ... the list just goes on.
Buy the dip
Do I send tqqq yes or no fuck you also

Lol. Hope u got puts😂
There are alot of balance areas above us to 3400, and many gaps below us down to 3240. Today could be a awesome day for day trading, or a seriously horrific consolidation day.

There's proposal to tax on shareholder reported revenue, instead of IRS reported profit.  Harder to fudge those

I think it was a cycle of short covering / call-driven buying that finally stopped and is now close to a fair price

not entirely a bad thesis. BABA might be duh play.
I'll either be selling my Tesla or reserving a Cyber Truck by the end of this
It is but you should take it because if he sues you - go to court and prove you have the lil’est dick and it’s yours
It’s perfect
Bull trap if I ever did see one or my names not Ron Jeremy
something something be greedy when others are fearful
If you want these incredible shares then you're just gonna have to deposit big money into my bank account, cuz we only selling at a premium. No discounts for you.
Haha! Don’t worry retard, I made the same mistake! Then again I’m a Europoor and we turned clocks back weekend before last, so I have an excuse....

If you’re North American and you didn’t turn clocks back, 😐
Yes. The market is expecting a clear and easy Biden win.
Yeah the MM's inversing WSB....stronger force than anything in the universe -_-
I think I’m going to yolo 10% of my account on SPY puts at first resistance up (if any) after open. There is no way this doesn’t get dramatic
!emojify
Wayyyy too bullish in here.. if your holding calls be careful.
NIO 🚀????

I think theres some room in the basement im currently living at. But you sure you wanna pay 9.99 + 1$ per contract for each option trade you do bud?
It's up 6%?
"The perfect short" and the thing drops from 33 to 32. What a joke. Come back when you're down over 50%.
yes it actually is (lil dicky)
i was called many mean things when I suggested to buy the TWTR dip
volume doesnt come until 9:30 - 9:45
No. The closer to expiration the faster theta decay. Weekly IC QQQ .70 credit
$5k worht of baba shares I bought @ 304.

Should I sell at open or just hold for the long term? Is there hope it will recover to 304 anytime in the future? Fuck these chinese stocks
I legit cant figure out the td app for trading options so wealthsimple trade for stocks/ETFs is good for now

[No joke](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/national/business/2020/9/10/1_5099489.html) hopefully whomever wins the election down there has a proper plan. $1200 isn't going to help any family several months behind on mortgage payments.

Edit: I read in someone's comment here on reddit who works at a bank. His manager was told from higher up that they were to NOT have any mortgages marked as delinquent in their Q3 reports or something. He could have been full of shit, but they made it sound like they were kicking the proverbial can into next year and next presidency.
what explains the recent sell off of twtr
That would make sense for 830 am, don't jack off your little R boner quite yet
We can only hope!
Elaborate. Give me that double dicking analysis
THAT GOLD ROCKET 🥇🚀
3340 isn’t budging for shit
But long term this will stabilize the economy, and allow funding for Infastructure and healthcare... short term it will screw the markets. But since we mainly do options here who bloody cares. Make money up, make money down.
Most fuckers here are between 16-29 investing 1-3k profiting barely enough to buy their pizza and weed claiming they’re ready to buy lambos.. funny thing is you can spot them a mile away

My grandfather told be he shot a bear sunday, im not a superstitious fuck so i didn't correlate it to how fucked my puts would be, damnit i wish i was dumber
I kept saying “I just want to go back to even” and then on Friday I briefly did. But then I didn’t sell all my puts.

Doesn't mean I can't ride the wave on options. It works until it doesn't
Is the rapper name lil dickie taken? It’s perfect for me
Hilarious
herd immunity was the only shot we ever had but no one could say it out loud until after they get reelected, if they say it outloud the old people who voted them in will vote them out

fuck the aarp

American democracy is a fucking joke, just a bunch of fat illiterate facebook group users and old people freaked out medicare people (6 decades to get your shit together during the biggest period of financial growth in recorded human history, and you couldn't do it?)

at the time of the revolution America was the most literate nation on earth, more newspapers and magazines were sold per capita than anywhere else on earth, by far. Discussing these papers and shit was all they could do, because no tv or reddit.

now its just retards hyping retards hyping retards off some Instagram comment they read about how mango man is bad because he hurts feelings

gotta edit this again to just say fuck old people, get the fuck out of the way, stop voting for your own financial self interest when you have 4 more years to live anyway fuck you

im glad they were mean to memaw at the nursing home she was a bitch for giving everyone else double the trust fund. i stopped doing heroin anyway so fuck you lady

and the deaths dont mean shit, on the macro level. Its the ones that dont produce anymore, or never produced that are dying. until we hit enough deaths that hospitals are fucked ( we have a lot of room to go in tx), any reporting is just fear mongering to the groups i discussed in the ramblings above.
What time is the rug pull?

I was waiting to see it in the Daily before I went bullish though.

Edit:  imagur is failing the upload, but check the hourly RSI charts you'll see it
Yup, they glorify the looters out here
His website got hacked and the email went to the wrong pump
I think the stimulus will offset some of that especially since I’m expecting a drop if Biden wins in a few months
I am not even an American, my dollar short play looking nice and about to double my account...

But I will stay away next 24 hours just enjoy the meltdown of either side and to watch the retarded reaction of markets

It’s not an election year in most of Europe right now, do you think they still hear about Covid all the time or does the news just ignore it because there’s no trump.
Subs big bullish on trump victory, inverse for real results
If he declares anything the market will crash the next day, made 40% on that put.
Way fair just dropped 6%!!! My calls 😭
Funny. You got me.

I've been looking it up, but sometimes it helps to have people who can explain it simply. Still gonna do more research but the answers I just received makes me less nervous about it.

If you don't want to sell/buy shares when selling options, you can sell when IV is high or longer DTE for theta to die, then buy back the contract at a lower price for profit. IV crush is your friend.

We're on WSB looking for trading advice so guaranteed theres a LOT going on we dont know!
No.
Imagine if Trump brought out Big Pump instead. Even this lil pump was enough to torpedo me though.
you'll just cap your gains at whatever strike you sell + the premium you sold the calls for... so no, you cant lose more than your current investment, in fact its safer than just outright owning shares
If you think anyone is holding much through tonight I got another thing coming for ya
Ah yeah sorry. Ah fuck my life these futures are so shit.

I'm 12 and who is mango
I’m glad you can admit it. You said you live in the Midwest.
No one's talking about the corporate tax rate going back up to 28% under a Biden victory.  Also corporate tax on revenue instead of profit to reduce offshore tax avoidance.

Only way the market going back to stonks only go up is if Biden wins but Senate remains republican, blocking all policy changes.  Under this condition it's safe to continue buying all the dips.

Under a Biden victory and Democrats winning Senate majority, I'd sell any after election rally and buckle up.

Also if the results are contested, take a look at the drawn out Bush recounts in Florida...
Doesn't matter if Trump or Biden wins, it just depends on the senate. A red senate will likely keep kicking the can down the road.
You seem like a smart person.Gl.I actually deleted my post.
You're in the wrong place for this, but no you can't lose money selling covered calls.

All those companies are unsustainable cash furnaces. Piss thru crazy amounts of cash and can’t post profits
You are begging though.  Not sure why you can’t see it.  Picture yourself as a bond, you’re like a 0% beyond garbage grade bond.  It’s total begging.

Which degree gives you a guaranteed job with a entry level salary of low-mid six figures?  How do you guarantee stock income? 


Lastly, there’s a subreddit for borrowing short term.  They pay like 10-20% for a few weeks-months because they need the money immediately to survive.  If you compare like your request, realistically a 0% APR $2,000 10 year loan from 60 different people for education to a 122% APR $2000 ($2,400 repayment) 2 month loan to survive, it’s a joke.  The APR’s are through the roof showing how risky these are.  


If I took the $120,000 you’re asking for with $30,000/year for 4 years, just dropped it into VOO or anything and made 8%/year and ran it for 5 years, it’d be around $155k.  For 10 years, 230k.  You’re essentially begging for $110,000.  Have some shame please.  Acknowledge it as begging.
Oh these are options. You may need to look up what those are. Way more complex than shares
Here’s to hoping 🍻
You only learned to count beans not years.

Wondering how bad the iv crush is going to be? Have calls for 3/31/21 with 33% IV doesn’t seem that bad
So here's what I've been seeing in SPY:

Bullish divergence since Nov. 28th so this run up is not a shock, I'm just SUPER pissed I didn't pick up some calls.

Futures flagging right now, looking like we'll hit around $336 to complete the bull flag pattern...

At the end of the day, who the fuck knows though, I honestly didn't expect an overnight pump of 1+%

Ok....I have a lot if shares of shit. If sell options and the stocks go in the money. Will i only lose money equivalent to the shares cost minus strike price? So money i technically don't have now anyway. Or is there a way I could lose more than my current investment in said stock.

This sub is trash now, mango going to win thanks for the downvote libtards
I love watching the Benzinga explanations for this.

When it was going up it was always "ZM is up because of COVID". When it was down last week it was "ZM is tracking down with the rest of the technology stocks". Yesterday it was basically "something something volatility". Nobody knows except someone is finally cashing out.
Yea, if we open up I think people look to take profit and what not rather than hold through
sell the 3000 P for 11/6 and if the stock price goes below 3000, you will have to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3000. then sell 3020  call for next week.

Which one are you looking at? I have an F33A Bonanza and it’s awesome.
"In attempting to understand VIX, it is important to emphasize that it is forward-looking, measuring volatility that the investors expect to see.  It is not backward-looking, measuring volatility that has been recently realized.  Conceptually, VIX is like a bond's yield to maturity.  Yield to maturity is the discount rate that equates a bond's price to the present value of its promised payments.  As such, a bond's yield is implied by its current price and represents the expected future returns of the bond over its remaining life.  In the same manner, VIX is implied by the current prices of S&P 500 index options and represents expected future market volatility over the next 30 calendar days."

Source - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings.

"The VIX estimates the implied volatility of ATM option in SPX with 30 days of duration.  A regular option on the SPX estimates the volatility of SPX itself between today and the day the option expires.  Say it's May.  You're looking at November options in SPX, and they trade at a 25 volatility.  That is the volatility the market anticipates between now and November expiration.  A November VIX future?  Quite different.  That's an estimate of where the VIX will close on November expiration day.  So if in May, you buy or sell a VIX November future or option, you are simply betting on where the VIX will settle on the morning of November expiration.  It's a bet on a single snapshot number that one day.  And since the VIX itself is an estimate of volatility 30 days forward, a May transaction in a November VIX contract bets on where the market six month's hence will estimate volatility 30 days forward from there.  Confused?  You are not alone."

Source - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings.

To tie it all together, VXX is -

"The VXX is an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) that tracks the VIX short-term futures. To be more specific, the VXX is a portfolio composed of the front two month /VX futures that bear continuously changing weights. VXX is just one of the available volatility products, and it is important to note that it does not always perform like the other products may (such as the VIX)." [Source](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/vxx)



TLDR: Instead play volatility directly.  

If bullish, long straddles or strangles in SPY/IWM/QQQ.  If you are worried IV may decline anyways, then short VIX calls.  

If bearish, short straddles or strangles on SPY/IWM/QQQ.  If you are worried IV may go up anyways then play long VIX calls or short VIX puts.  If you plan on collecting theta, it would make more sense to do short puts than long calls and not offset the daily theta decay.
It's so stupid 😂
Yep media will have no reason to talk about it anymore

Stimulus earliest Jan 28th for a Biden win so if your long calls you better hope the Trumpster wins.
No dude.

They are going to have Jack Ma on TV just like those americans have the Zucker and Hobo Jack on TV.
I have 320s for that date... I’m holding and thinking about selling some stock for more calls
Why is that? Won’t this experience most theta burn during the first 45 days? And in turn burn theta more quickly than a shorter dated contract?
Can’t wait to buy cheap poots today

I strongly believe it will go back up, and I have no worries about my BABA shares. I'm still learning options though, so I'm wondering how to handle those. I better read up more. Thanks

NIO is never a long term hold precisely because of LK ANT BABA. The CCP makes a killing selling at ATH, then one piece of fraud news and everything goes to shit

I have BABA 330 1/15 y’all think it’s worth holding after the IPO suspension?
SLV free money right now
doesn’t even have to be a landslide. If any of the two wins PA and Fl by 0.7% it’s over. 2016 wasn’t a landslide and narrower than almost ever but thanks to electoral college pretty clear same day.
This guy fucks.
I bought the dip beginning of summer. Looking good for me.
Also no way he’s going that hard without drugs. Going to crash hard.
I laughed so hard, sorry. This caption is gold.
Didn’t know retards could read let alone tell time
Can’t wait for y’all libs to cry after re-election 😂😭😭 downvote me pleaseee
Depends on if we know who won tonight or if Trump contests until the end of time
So I guess I have no other choice but to buy the PayPal dip?
after 2016, no one will be shocked by anything...
This shit is legend
Catch me outside how bout dat?
Hey china

Why do you have to lie and be sneaky about everything? Gypsies of asia just trying to fleece everybody every which way.
How far out are your RKT calls? Playing earnings?
Nice. Id choose a closer expiry though
They’re just cry baby pussies who told on you in school

About the erections or green and red dildos
It’s like this sub completely forgot the term “priced in” lol. Yes, their eps is up 25% but the stock is up 69% (actually; not a meme) on the year; almost up 80% from eod yesterday before crash. All of this growth was priced in already because of covid. Growth would’ve had to have been crazy for it to go up. Welcome to the market people.
or for bootleg liquor
Shush kid
How do I do that on reddit?
Can we ban people labelling everyone who posts political things as r/politics gang and is calling a ban on them? 

🥭 v 😴 is one of the biggest things that will shape the stock market for years to come. 

You're a true retard if you think election's orthogonal to the stock market. COVID, Gyna, energy, taxation and a bunch of other critical things depend on today's result
I haven’t had a healthy shit in weeks and I think it’s related to the markets somehow
“Have you ever been subbed to WSB?”
This is purely self loathing
Gas guzzler!  A350 ftw.
So is it suspended or cancelled wtf is this 😭
I think they will be crazy. Probably moon a couple days or a week then dump. But will moon again if any speculation about pro-bud legislation being discussed or anything like that
You should do that yourself
CGC 4/16 $22.5c is ATM and at $4.20. Think it’s a sign?
Creative accounting means management really care about investors. Bullish.

if biden wins, we know that every liberal will bitch and whine and cry for years because it’s all they know how to do
Well done!!! Congrats man
Word is Chinese regulators suspended the IPO
no matter the result that’ll be an outcome
I had a thought that causes reported spiked because of elections
ANT financial is just the latest in Chinese fraud.

Yo, can we ban fucking chinese ipos for the next 15 years? They're riddled with fraud
Don’t know, I am a IV dyslexic but my guess is the stock goes down this week and goes up afterwards.
It's not ignoring it. Just don't talk about politics here unless you post proof of skin in the game with a real money bet. Everything else is nonsense.

WSB election forecasts:

Trump win - priced in.

Biden win - priced in.

8 week delay due to legal fighting over the 2020 'hanging chad' - priced in.

FMP

(Fuck My Puts).
Depends -- if states like Florida, Ohio, NC, or Texas can be called for Biden before end of day it'll be hard to not have him as the 99.99% winner.

More than likely it'll be 2-3 days as mail in ballots are counted.
aapl and ups 😔
all in on weeklies far OTM obviously... thats what we do here
Pretty vague question. Go to community, get good grades, and then apply to the bigger Uni of your choice later on. 

Some folks utilize Community College if; they did shit in high school and didn't have the GPA to get into the big Uni; sucked dick on the SAT/ACT; and/or to save money up front instead of paying massive amounts to take Gen Eds at the big Uni.

Chess, golf, McDonald’s eating, racing,
Hey. Be nice.
Both legs at a time?
if you bought it today it wouldn't be the worst thing, I started off in stocks too, penny stocks and this was one of them. Lots of times people would say "long term hold, blah blah blah and I would l say yeah right it's a penny stock, I watched this go from $2 to $8 to $12 and then to over $30, it's got growth and more people took notice, one thing I'll say is the penny stock sub loves doing their DD, some are trash/fake/dumb but some are hardcore about it. Point is, you can $10,000 in stocks and leaps with the other $10,000, godspeed
at this point weekly puts before earnings of any company is free money

The UK market has been slowly bleeding out for months due to the uncertainty. By the time we shutdown again it was priced in. The greater certainty associated with another lockdown has actually given people reason to get back in.

I bet people selling cash secured puts and saying they are being paid to buy stocks for cheap are the same people at work who set up meetings to discuss at what time we should have monthly meetings
Yeah, almonds make me thirsty
I might go back to mostly/all shares. I have a few BABA calls, and they cost so much and take away from margin-using ability. And now this shit, and right before earnings which I hear can eff up  your calls bad. What a headache this option shit is
It must’ve been the 40x margin or something they allowed people for the ANT IPO

Yolo your retirement savings
Ya I trade spreads and thankfully robinhood recognizes this. What retarded robinhood doesn't recognize is that if the options expire you can cover the max loss, so they automatically try to close your spread on expiration day. You can lose a few dollars here which isn't much but adds up over time

HANDFUL OF SPORTS
Oh damn Daddy 🤤 what time you picking me up?
Thanks for soiling my YouTube history
I said puts...
Yup. Depending on how close of a call it is... if it’s a landslide then we’ll most likely know by tonight honestly
What’s he doing? Desperately making copes about voter fraud and shit?
Dude always rambles like a mad man.  This your first Trump interview or is it especially bad today?  LOL
So just like any other interview?
Buy the clit at open?!
That’s only short term. Leaps are super cheap
Ban all r/politics idiots please mods.
It’s probably because of daylight savings
Been saying it all weekend. Absolutely the play.
“How I Met Your Mother” if you ever watched that.
Was this morning a last second hail mary attempt to sway potential voters? I see no reason the market should even be close to up right now
Ah I got it what you were trying to say.Thanks
Wait to catch the knife, shit plunges easy🔪🖐
got greedy and held their puts too long and are now broke, again, haha!
Ever looked up symptoms you’re having on the internet... only to find out you have stage 69 penis cancer?
We got notifications from the auto mod for a long ass time if you said his name. so we are trained to say mango instead
Here  I am!
Lmao “polls took a rapid turn Monday night as Mango broke sleepy’s ankles”
I’ve always understood early voting to be by mail and absentee ballots 

I’ve never seen voting locations open before election Tuesday
Yeah. I been holding SQQQ calls 11/20 and 12/18. Banking on prints
Mango is over, invest in dementia pills instead

Saw some. I think he is coming to terms with how fucked he is when the lawsuits don’t work.
Already lubed up bro.

Bruh all my DD is about chutney tho
Buy CLCT at open.
Already roped. The only ones left are the ones who are selling their calls at open and buying puts
Def sell off into close. People are so anxious
They want to fuck CCP. CCP turned around showing massive dick
"Can confirm" You're not dead though???

Stop chasing, start thinking
I see thank for info.
Please do! I sold covered calls thinking my shares would just sit quietly for a while! I need out

Then we can rally galore
prepare to get IV crushed bruh
Gotcha so calendar spreads might be effective in reducing my risk atleast for the short term
IV's were close to ATH's yesterday. Normally, I think theta gang is a bunch of pussies who are basically the r/investing of options. 

But, the election play is selling OTM's here on the huge potential vol collapse.
College Dropout and Late Registration were both amazing albums. His original music was not meh at best. He also didn't always publicly have the ego now has.
Anyone watching this trump interview live??

He’s rambling like a mad man what the fuck

On fox and friends btw, should be posted to fox YouTube channel in a bit
Well have a good idea in 10-12 hours. It’ll be either over pretty fast or go on for weeks.

China postponed ant ipo
BABA is the sound a baby makes, obviously not a sound investment.
Sounds like liberal propaganda to me. In my town of 14 people the polling place is right next door to the Wendy’s we all work at and lines don’t exist... so it must be like that everywhere.


/s for the slow people
I have a 1440 sat so if that helps in answering transfer question?
This is the way
Not looking to get blown out if there is a big move. All my options are paid for courtesy of covered calls.
So with $300,000 - I can make $80,000 roughly a year? Please explain how? What is the stately called? I’ll google it. What stocks to use. I’m in this! We can pm please. I like this better than options, I’m switching over. And what brokers should I use? Robinhood? and how does making the $20,000 every 3 months work? And what happens if I’m assigned shares? If you have time to answer all this, thanks a lot! If not, no worries. I’m a noobie, learning while waiting for the market to open lol
Bro this is WSB. We're here to talk shit as much as to discuss the stock market

Early voting has been a thing for ages. Early voting accounted for 42% of all votes in 2016. People still vote on election day, and exit polls still happen.
Prob not the main competitor but a competitor nonetheless. I’ve been following them for a while, have some shares, like the company and think they will do well.
Basically saying "just let the market do what it's supposed to do", "let the new economy form" and for the govt. to stop propping up zombie companies and get out of the way.
Lol which one of you tards went and placed the .01 bid?
To be fair, WFC, XOM and CCL are all shitty companies with businesses perfectly designed to fail in the 2020 crisis. All three of them a glowing radioactive heaps of 💩, not even worth shorting now.

Might see some more actual discussion/support for this if you post it over on r/smallstreetbets. Less teenage/shitposting over there.
They look equally like shit. Because they are both old fucking men
Aphria to 6 🔜
Wait it out a couple of days. I've consistenly made the mistake of jumping right back in after a dip. It will dip for a bit. Also, who knows what tonight will bring. If Biden wins by a margin will Trump concede? Too much risk don't you think? Wait until tomorrow or Thursday.
Most painful comment I've read in the last 5 mins, and that's saying something
Where's all the bears?
Also, if this is real and you actually waited until the day of to prepare, it doesn’t really matter what stock you pick. You’re fucked
Tech can be taking over the world and be overvalued at the same time
It then ended green
Lmfaooooo another mentally unstable Trumptard. Typical.
Any tickers for companies growing mangoes?
IPOB went from $10 to $25 which was actually a 150% return if you sold. Even no name stuff like FMCI netted a 100% return which is now Tattooed Chef (TTCF).
Glad I leave work early. Rednecks gonna lose it after Biden stomps Trump.
Ant news no bueno
PLACE YOUR BETS.
Gtfo
Int student here nvm
Wtf happened to BABA??? I’m about to get rekt

It has nothing to do with age “dumbass”. Take one look at Biden and tell me he doesn’t look like he could croak at any moment.
Mango?
Depends on if its close or not. 2016 was very close so if its like that not till next week or so more than likely, but this time we are breaking all voter turnout records which imo implies a large win for one or the other. Idk which, but my guess with all the fake news is biden
Damn children are expensive
I can invest in donkey kong?

all in, see you boys on the flip
Lmfao, this is why you lost money.
🤣😂 NO!  They almost locked up Ma for creating an IPO that could break China.
Shanghai stock market stopped ANT ipo 2 days before going live because of a regulatory clampdown by Gyna on Baba/ANT. About time Jack Ma stands up to those fascists.

Long time it won’t matter I think.

Enough that you have so much money that you can spend money to fuck over someone else. For most of us that means our boss, in the traditional "Fuck you, I quit". For these I would say you would need to be financially secure enough to not need a job again, so be in the upper income status based on investments alone. For a single person (or single earner household) then you're looking at needing $200k a year with no draw down. You could take the ultra conservative route, being tied to the 5 year CD/Savings rate or 1%, this would mean you would need 20M. More appropriately it would be generating 200k in dividends with a "safe" portfolio (25% BND/VOO/VXUS/VNQ or 2.6% yield) or \~7.7M. 

If you're replacing both incomes, then double the numbers.

If you're going to work at Lowe's or something, then halve the numbers. 

If you want Lambo's, then triple the numbers.
I’ll check it out thanks
Long calls, its what a Orang Utan would do and he's smarter than us. I'm all in.

So you're a loser and to feel better you need to try and fisty cup internet users?
Really owned me there! I located the typical ignorant micropenis white male everyone!
Well IV crush just means you shouldn't buy too far out and you'll make less profit even if it shifts your direction. Spreads can reduce that impact but ultimately high IV just means you're taking on a higher risk.

Aka if you think a big move is gonna be made in your direction, go for it. But if you're wrong about the direction or the momentum, you'll get fucked.
And then gets his salad tossed by the obvious money print goes brrr into a big bubble for corporate America.
You were not in here Sunday then. Holy shit everyone was so bearish thinking circuit breakers were going to get hit. They kept citing the weekend dow being down .7%

A nice way too look a things.Will keep this in mind.
If you knew where the market would go everyday you'd be a millionaire. Which I highly doubt. All I'm saying is it's super easy to play the result
Actually pretty accurate. $5m USD for any decent non NY financial centre in the world: London, HK, Tokyo? NAnd that’s a comfy middle class life, pizza once a week with wine
Oh yeah spreads

I have no idea... never gotten so unlucky before, just bought them yesterday. I’m going to just keep holding through and hope some good news pops them back up.
So BABA calls , got it

Bro what? Are you delusional? Mango is fat as fuck and would go into cardiac arrest. Joe would just randomly fall over and die. Neither one of these dudes are balling
That’s what they said in 2014
The dip was last week. Now it’s trying to break the 35$ level. I mean nothing is a straight line in investing but Nio has to have a bad day to go back under 30. Just don’t see that happening
Anyone buying this baba dip?

Spy calls at open ? Holding puts rn
International students get scholarships. By the way - go study in Europe, Germany pays ALL tuition even for foreigners.
If you want to take economics, you failed the intro. You're trying to take out a loan at a time of huge demand, finite supply and further fucked up by the government having its bottomless checkbook involved through Stafford loans. At a top university where you will be paying top premium for little relative benefit. This is on top of having an undergrad no longer cuts it if you want to get into anything quantitative or related. Most jobs are looking for master's minimum. Tack on more debt. You are paying into a huge student loan bubble as it is. You are in at the top. That's not the place you want to make your entry.

If you haven't qualified for scholarships on top of just getting into the school, you will likely not be competitive enough to standout from everyone else around you. Going to a cheaper, less acclaimed school but being a stud compared to your peers will be more beneficial than being near the bottom or even average at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, etc. Talk shit about community college, but they are getting fundamentally similar education at a fraction of the cost. If you're dead set on a university, excelling at a state school will be better than struggling at an Ivy.

1. They fucked with uncle sam by being too close with GYNA and Russia and uncle sam fucks back.

2. Their earnings may have peaked with covid and they are over valued for a one off scenario where their earnings were sky high. If they cant beat covid earnings, they are over valued.

3. China declared war on American tech just last week and is actively targeting APPLE in the 5 year plan. Its open season on American innovation and the gloves are off.

It won’t be decided tonight, hopefully this week. If not then probably next week at the latest

Is there a chance that this is big guys selling in lower volume to offload positions? Europe is shut down and they are showing 1.5% gains every day. Not one sell off during uk shut down. Can anyone put their finger on what’s actually rising the market?

Unfortunately i had the opportunity to talk directly with the likely MT governor (Gianforte) that dickhead said he doesn't support Marijuana legalization but in the same step talked about how he wanted value added agriculture in MT.

Lmfaoooo ❤️
Give me a break dude nobody knows where this market is gonna go. None of it makes sense. You can't be surprised if the market went down even more just like you can't really be surprised that it's green right now. People also thought it was stupid to buy outs after Monday drilled yet we drilled again later in the week. Nothing fucking matters it's all a coin toss. This told ya so bullshit is so fucking annoying
Credit spreads buddy
Hopefully TLRY
But their comment section is filled with bigger tards than here
This is so fucked. Baba barely inched up at all as ANT sized up their IPO and now its dump city.
Yeah but Apple is fucking luxury phone and laptop company, Google and FB are going to get buttfucked by anti-trust, TWTR is just too small etc.

You can be bullish on tech long term but still bearish on the companies popular today
According to Elon’s Twitter yesterday “about a month or so”
Need some help retards. Ive got an interview today and I need to prepare a stock pitch for it. What's a good value stock that I can pitch?
I'm getting out by close
Honestly respect man i don't know why but i respect that
Calm down BABA holders, at least its not a 10% drop and watch it recover by mid day
Has it been officially suspended?
I honestly think it’s at 22 on Friday
Doubt he will give a fuck about spinning anything since he won't have to worry about election again.
Props to you!
Back to stimulus talks and a trade war glooming in the horizon
LMAOOOOO
2.2T minimum, and it actually supports the American people, municipalities, and businesses.
Except he will wait until ah when he sees he is losing. So enable futures!
Ill just hold these BABA calls till it blows over.  Probably sell them for less of a loss next week. But fuck my ass and fuck china
How often does IV on a stock go up after earnings? Tonight is like earnings, except for the whole country. VIX is not "exploding" considering it already ran up to 41 in the last week. 

Also, notice how VIX is making lower highs even as the market went lower Friday? Volatility is done and people are going to be holding the bag as always.

And VIX is calculated by looking at put prices on SPX. Powell and Mnuchin are not out there selling puts, that's about the stupidest thing I've heard on this sub, and that includes people that bought Kodak at 50.
When will they announce if trump or Biden wins? Any1
People complaining about $BABA...
Did you get your calls at $300? I swear WSB is always too late. People have been singing BABA since last ER when it dropped to 254. That's when I got my Jan calls. Even with this price action, still up bigly
I’m gonna take my glock with me in my hoodie since it’s 30 degrees but I’m not really in the mood to be picked with since it’s cold and kinda wet.
I didn't sell yesterday. Baba puts about to print Billy fam
Vix doesn't listen to nobody, it marches to the beat of its own drum.  It is simply a statistic that estimates volatility 30 days forward. [More info](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6e2fu/vixvxx/gb039wt/)
😂😂😂🤣🤣
So Harris?
They don't need to buy stocks, flooding the system with money and destroying yields on bonds is more than enough to jack up prices. With how high inflation is right now (housing costs up double digits YoY last few years), people need yield and "safe investments" have literally 0 yield. Buy stocks or struggle to survive basically.
Shouldn't have waited this long. But good luck nonetheless. And thank you for voting. This would have been my second general election but I sat out of the 16 election. Thanks for not being an idiot like me

This is the way
Apply to U of Maine, Vermont, Arizona, UMass, UConn - they will offer huge merit scholarships or go to McGill in Canada - much easier immigration after graduation. Bentley is also possible. Big names matter less especially if you want to be an entrepreneur. Don’t pay $300,000 for a marketing or finance degree - you will feel scammed at the end.

Surprise win by Trump, Biden win is priced in rn
Trump gonna pump today and also release a statement saying he has a vaccine. Spy Calls
I play pdt.  Patterned day trader

It’s China. The government controls most of private business. If Ma didn’t preclear his plans with the CCP, this was inevitable. They probably are concerned about the level of foreign investment this will attract.
If he does lose, he's gonna instantly have a primetime spot on FoxN

rip BABA calls
"Do you have a post election safety plan in place? Regardless of who wins election there could be anger and violence. We need to be prepared physically and mentally. Do all your grocery shopping before election night. Use paid time off from work if you have it. Lock your doors and windows and don't answer the door for strangers. Have a battery powered radio in case the power goes out. Pack a "go bag" with food, clothing, meds, cash, and weapons. Make sure your car has a full tank of gas in case you need to evacuate your community entirely on short notice."

I've seen shit like this on my Facebook wall like 5 times in the past couple days. Reminds me of how scared people were of Y2K and it turned out to be nothing.

The market clearly is not scared though so fuck my puts I guess 🤷‍♂️🌈🐻🍆😭
I think you don't understand stonks, and that's okay
Mine are Jan too. So we don't dump for earnings, and just wait it out? I always hear we're supposed to avoid ER with calls, but...

Why's baba dumping?
Historically sp500 returns 11% when a democrat is in office vs 7% when a republican is president so I’m hoping for a Biden win especially since we’ll get a bigger stimulus but if trump loses who knows what the reaction will be
Hey, this guy is a great big PHONY!

Okay so we now know how to dump BABA: Summon 3 autists.

I think I know how to pump stocks, I use a photo copier to print hundies now that JPOW stopped. If we all do this stocks should moon.

retard magic y'all
If you go to the ER they will. (always have for me). Depends on where you live, in my city the docs don't do it at all, because of so many junkies in town. But i've had it work out fine in other states, just make sure you don't smell like booze at all when you go.
Let's see what happens tonight.

Good Morning folks

What's the play today? How do we make green? where are my tendies?

give it to me
I think it’s stupidly high already and it’s a bad idea, but if you’re dead set on it, sell ATM puts and buy ATM calls.
The new report sounds more damning
Go to predictit.org. That is what is priced into markets. The market prices things in as they see them 6-12 months in advance. Once you see it on the news, it’s far too late to make money. Trump used to be the favorite, then the underdog. That’s why Dem stuff has done well in 2020.
Just a follow up, AMC with a big miss on earnings and currently up in pre market @2.30. The risk to reward on these trades typically are not worth shorting. Just my opinion, which means nothing.
Trumps an anti-hero, he has to be against the establishment, even if it's the Republican establishment otherwise he can't get the backlash vote.
A year under mango, under biden idk

Good I’m tired of hearing about the ant ipo, I swear they were hyping it in July
One of you guys had a good point lol. Why the fuck is tech dying and why did JPM downgrade tech? Bruh Nasdaq is like 10% off from record high, all earnings beat and the virus is worse than ever. 

Than the even funnier thing is why tf did cruise line go green after announcing the no sail extension. Bruh I swear, any logic in this market and you lose money.

It’s polarization from the media calling him Hitler and fascist 10000 times.

Yeah stable foreign relationship as in being china’s bitch for the next 4 years
assuming he started working at 16, making \~10/hr 40hrs a week, that's 20k.

he can't do 40hrs a week, so lop that off to 20hrs... so roughly 10k a year. Now do that for 5 years, so 50k over 5 years, without factoring in expenses. He only has 16k.

Nice what did you invest your $6 into?
The RSI divergence on oil majors on the weekly is massive. Literally there’s a possibility of doubling stock price over the next 6 months.
Because oil stocks cant go much lower. Some are at 30 year lows, plenty of drillers are BK, when demand goes up supply may have a hard time catching up, price of oil will take off.  Why do you expect XLE to just go to $10/share?  Oil majors still make $100s billions in revenue per year.
Overpaying for an undergraduate degree is common for international students but you really should consider why you need to spend $300,000 for an education that can be had for 50% less at picnic universities. 

Are you aware it will be impossible to het a job in the US after you graduate? No employee will sponsor you as the supply of US students seeking a similar job is plentiful. It costs corporations lots of money to pay legal fees. It’s common for senior executives as their skill set is exceptional. If you want to stay after you graduate you will need to spend another $100,000-300,000 on a graduate degree on a STEM field to qualify for 2 year OPT work visa. The job won’t pay well and Once again employers will be cautious unless you are a computer science wizard. 

Sorry for your situation - call the financial aid office and start negotiating. They might offer you something but you will pretty much need to beg as they need full pay kids to give to the poor kids that truly need it.

Nah, it seems easy but we were just as dumb back then. I worked in technology and was a huge tech enthusiast and didn’t see Amazon happening, Apple happening or anything else.

Looking back it’s easy to see but it’s not as simple in the moment. Prices are so inflated now that there would be no way to guess stuff like Amazon and Apple would be insane multiples of earnings.

Markets don't react to fundamental stuff but to emotions. Wall street bros want Biden to win just because, and they concoct a whole bunch of weird explanations why that's good.

The truth is that it really doesn't matter who wins. WSB sells itself short, all investors are retards deep down.
You just said in your topic post that you were 17.  Now you say you're 18.  Are you 17 or 18?  I would assume that would be hard for a uni student to forget.

My first election with WSB. Damn, I love all you guys. Whoever wins, wish we all prosper the last 60 something days of 2020 and bask in tendies rolling into 2021.
I guess we're back to stocks only going up? Just in time I went near last week. Market can't be having me make money for too long eh?
I don’t really care who wins, but 🥭 losing would be the most hilarious outcome 😂

Edit: feel free to downvote you sensitive Trumpies
Big day today! Or I should say .. big night! Will we know who the president is? What if a very orange man falsely claims victory before all mail in votes? What if it’s a landslide? How will futures react? ... find out on the next episode of DRAGON BALL Z!
I think the most important is that the winner is clear and the looser accept It, we do not want riots
If america crashes it could bring down the others easy.
Fuck all you high and mighty "voting is your duty" idiots. Voting is like buying options, you have the right but not the obligation. How many of you actually exercise options? 

Sitting this out because you don't feel compelled to choose which color tie the guy who fucks you in the ass is wearing is a perfectly reasonable and respectable position.
Ant ipo suspended
Erection day boys. By then or tromp?

So retail on the sidelines. Big boys buying shit up now. Retail FOMOs in after shit is up 20% or more. And yeah.. dump when we least expect it. I like this idea

It's a yolo for a reason. $350 bet that has a 95% chance of going up in smoke. But... I've seen more retarded turn arounds.  I wouldn't be surprised if AMC dissolves before Christmas 2021, but hey. Never know
It does actually. 50 states elect the president, not 330M people. Theoretically a president could win with just 23% of the popular vote because of this.

Btw, not as extreme as yours but I will sell portfolio and allocate all proceeds to nio, Li and xpev. Check account next year lol
Bill Ackmann is having trouble finding a company “ unicorn “ to partner with. Bloomberg, AirbnB and Stripe turned him down. Hope he is successful but it might be a long wait to tie up your capital in a $20+ bet. The clock is ticking — he has about 16 months to go .... good luck 🍀
Geez.. only making <$62k a year, but throws this much into a single stock?? Truly do **belong** here
Thinking about buying 5 AMC $5C 1/2023 as a YOLO if they survive this pandemic and don't shutter completely. This is all off a gut feeling that whoever put their money into this a few years ago is going to do everything to keep it from dying
Never even heard of the symbol. I'll pick up 5 contracts of CGC 11/20 15p at open.
XPEV & LI are this Summer's EV IPOs as well. XPEV is younger in the business life cycle than NIO, if you want a shot at getting in at an EV before it blows up. XPEV & LI are still very volatile due to day trading and can be picked up as bargains on low swings for long positions. But those two are also gaining ground fast and there will be diminishing opportunities to get them at bargain prices going forward.

China has declared some crazy goal to be renewable by 2060. I forget the details, but it's very credible since China's very dependent on importing energy and that's expensive AF for a manufacturing society. If the US renewable/EV stocks have topped out, I'd say there's at least a decade of magnificent renewable/EV gains there. So in terms of big picture, you're getting in very early in that decades-long arc if you start initiating positions in 2020.
Everyone having fun, including small cap, meanwhile tech...
Kanye wins stocks ATH
The fact that tech has been the laggard makes me think the market is pricing in a blue wave and a fat stimmy, which small caps and the broader market will benefit most from. 

A Trump victory is better for mega cap tech that benefits from small businesses going bankrupt and people staying home as the virus spreads.

Regardless of the outcome, I honestly think the bottom of this sell off is close or has already passed, but only if the election isnt contested and the Fed doesnt scare the fuck out of everyone this week.

Fair enough.  Despite BABA’s fundamentals though, the stock hasn’t moved much during past two earnings.
Somebody in England (is that a real country?) put $5 million on Trump to win.
Rates on loans are at historic lows right now. Get a loan from a bank. In Europe sometimes they even pay you interest to borrow money.

My thoughts about why the market is bullish: its excited to move beyond election drama
Purge priced in
Rs actively trying to steal this election they worried about that blue tsunami. Don’t worry brainwashed cattle even if your taxes go up the market will go up more.
This is the way
Whole system is fake. I watch MSNBC in the mail in ballot processing center, where they open the secure ballot envelops. The people literally look at the enveolpe to see if the number matches for like 2 seconds. I doubt they even look when the camera off, and even if they do how hard would it be to counterfeit an envelope if they just glance at it for a second and toss it into a pile.
There's nothing to excuse. We joke about asking for money in memes at times but this is actual begging, self promotion.

Over long time frames yeah. Right now there's idiotic panic about the dollar but that's actually what the fed wants.

But if you have to avoid a -50% drop you go cash gang, you don't give a fuck about long term. Bonds are ded courtesy of jpow.
Ok, but i was referring to any election disturbance, it was at 31 this morning, i dont think its out of the realm of possibility. Im feeling you may be right though and i might just buy @ low 30's.

Top guy is still a bigger pussy. Of course they give him gold for putting 16k into an overvalued Chinese third market peddler like Amazon who’s losing market share to focused companies like Chewy and Walmart.
What's the market cap?
So according to the logic I’m seeing, either candidate that wins is bullish? And the only way we tank is if we don’t know? Yeah I’m out of these puts EOD. Not dealing with that iv crush coming tomorrow. The fuck did we tank for last week( besides me having calls) ? Smh, nothing has changed this week.
yes, you have to have the money in your account. robinhood will automatically exercise when the time comes
Nobody is forcing you to vote, but wars are fought for less and you should exercise that right
In 2016 wasnt Trump negative the day of the election?
He should be clear by now as COVID runs its course in 2 weeks if it doesnt cause complications. So no
Then you are an indecisive fence sitter with no strong convictions
Then don’t vote bud. Free country..for now
It’s green not red
this shit gonna crater between 10-11 mods
Mixed feeling about nio. Half of me wants to dumb my life savings on 2021 calls the other have thinks this company is bs and will die soon

Are you retarded? I'm in this guy's education 69c 4/20
Late tonight early tomorrow

Ah gotcha
Buckle up boys!
Been seeing lots of calls on PYPL exp 11/20. Think it’s a good time to get some shares at this dip?
so today?
I'm gonna be honest, I don't like the sound of it. I'm already invested in GME so it's gonna be interesting to see how this plays out.
what's wrong with not voting, what if I don't like either side
Market is betting on Trump winning now...
Whosever side wins this election gets some

Cause of death: being a fat orange mango
Ban for begging/pan handling.
My wife works from home making sweaters for chihuahuas out of dryer lint, so she’s going to need a 1500 square foot workshop. I’m a rust remover for bridges that only uses an ancient Japanese technique taught to me by a 150 year old Shaolin monk, so I’ll need a detached garage that can house a full sized semi truck. We would like to stay close to the city center as the suburbs give my wife vertigo. We have a budget of $12 million.
After the election
That’s how I thought post apple/tesla split, worked for a couple days then softbank/mm double teamed and pulled the rug
Lol.
Stonks rise on election certainty hopes
And folks didn't like it, coupled with almost 150% increase since pre-March crash. Took the loot.

Ultimately who the hell knows. Trying to make real sense will leave you more confused.
If you use “mango man” and “win” in the same post, all the gaping pussy wipes will downvote it lol
People complaining about Apple forget about the split? Pre-split, it would be up over $3.00.
guys when are the election results released?
Market loves Papa Joe. 

I have C calls that have pumped lately. Maybe should’ve purchased JPM too
You’re gonna get bullied for this, I feel it

This nigga 🤣🤣🤣 asking for loans at a casino 👌🤣
Agreed.  When I was in college I never had money....I was always in the negatives
Insane pump. Another strange day.
I could but then people can contact me and arrange a call.Giving a loan is after all a legal agreement.
What, you didn't get your mail in ballot? I'm sure by next election you'll be eligible to vote.

only $100 for a car?  man the US really has had crazy inflation since we got off the gold standard unfortunately!!!
This is your best way to go. Most trading platforms have them in their trading software built in just look for P&L Calculator.
Trade in a Roth you toad
If Trump dies of a heart attack/stroke over the shock of his loss to Biden, does his death certificate show the cause of death as COVID?
Vanguard, Blackrock?
I dont know if yall have read the latest news...NIO is paying another Chinese car manufacturer to make their cars. NIO is currently limited to oy selling in China. As we all know, the Chinese market has been growing and will continue to do so. However, only being allowed to sell to one country means that the stock price will hit a ceiling. So if you want to get into NIO, its best to do it sooner rather than later. Tesla on the other hand....can sell to multiple countries...
Gotta give the loan defaults and bankruptcies time to overwhelm the fed. 

Look at any previous real crash, big drops are followed by (less) big rallies.   Takes awhile for the euphoria to wear off.  People going to keep thinking they can make up the losses all the way to the bottom.
CNBC - Joe Kernan - seems like you're trying to tank your show.  I change the channel every time he has a guest who has nothing important to say about the stock market.

Those W calls were crying out to me, as if from a cupboard.
Guys I had a dream last night and some guy told me to buy SPY calls 😹
It doesn't matter, where else will people store cash no matter who wins? Inflation is worse

Sorry, I moderately like money
Or you sell drugs
I might, but honestly I think its gonna go up if a Biden wins and Im gonna sell Jan calls
True, but this is not a growth play.  AMC began the year at $7.26 and hit $7.61 in August.  Since AMC warned investors that it *might* file for bankruptcy, investors fled.  When everyone is looking one way, the other side is what interests me.  The risk is bankruptcy, but the reward for simply returning to their shitty existence is sizeable.  Here are some [unrelated graphs](https://youtu.be/U1zrV-vFGWA?t=360), not sure the source.
Now that we’re on to them, do they tank it?
This is bs... there have been countless times in history you could have said the same thing. We’ve never seen tomorrow or the next day or the day after that. That’s been true since day 0.
Fortunately you can’t vote though.
it won't be red whole week, or atleast it won't go down more than 1%
Same thing. The market is rigged. It goes up or down, and then media just says "Market \[up/down\] as <insert today's news>"

we'll be looking at another 4 years after today.

edit: guys i just meant we're looking at another 4 years in general, regardless of who wins. 

The last 4 years went by quick.
Well, 5d finally closed official line at -150 for Biden and +130 for trump. If you care about that stuff. Been following the line for a few months just to gauge everything.
Prediction - stonks rally 2-3% today, open flat tomorrow. IV crush murders options holders as Robinhood initiates diamond hands mode tomorrow
YO YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM ME BUT CRAMER SAID

" Shares of Corsair are already up 10% over the past month, but Cramer said this high-end gaming peripheral maker isn't done buy the dip. The company has 18% market share in the gaming market and its high-end products are sought after by high-end gamers buy the dip. While the company is spending a lot on research and development buy the dip, as well as marketing, it also enjoys buy the dip."

HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT BTW!

Yea that's sounds awosme thanks. I promise I'll be patient

Gay bear + stupid
CCL or RCL?
The pandemic has reduced the demand for petroleum and accelerated the transition towards renewables, hence the sharp jump this year. A Biden victory is probable, so it's been partially priced in. If he does win, renewables should jump up even more. I'll look at more diversified, US-focused renewable ETFs like QCLN

depends on how large of a margin he wins the ones that have started counting. you can use back data to determine a confidence interval where even in a 0.0001 democratic landslide in those counties, it wouldn't matter.

Honestly, NIO is a great company. The guy with the top comment is either joking or has no idea what he's talking about.

I'd say put 15K into NIO: buy 10K worth of NIO now. See how the week goes, maybe even buy another 5k within this week - or keep the remaining 5k for averaging down if it dips next week or the following week.

Put the remaining 5k in SBE (Chargepoint).
BABA needs to fly. IPO is in two days
So I can make $24,000 a month with $300,000? What strategy is this called? What broker do I use? Im new to this. Is this “selling covered calls” or “circle” . Thanks!
Something like 80-90% of the time spx falls when the president changes. Im pretty sure the markets fell for a biden victory in the past 2 weeks and now enough data is given that its priced in.

Sell calls against it to make more money
why can america only vote for 2 people lol, in europe we can vote for like 20 different parties and our vote actually matters even if the one we voted for didnt get majority. we have like 400 people controlling and voting for shit and if x party got 10% votes then they get 40 people from their party out of those 400.

Hey Americans, shouldn't you be out voting? LOOL
Anything under 30? Or do you think it could hit 25 at a low.
You’re using the last year as logic for that statement. You have to remember this market is unlike any seen before and the valuations (especially in tech) are highly propped up. Stimulus is a short term gain for some people. If Biden wins, he’ll be looking at the UK and other countries who are locking down for guidance on Covid. I’m betting (with my plays), that this week doesn’t matter as much as next or the following if there is a sweep. People will pull out of sectors and there will be a lot of unsettled investors. Tech will be hurt, break ups will be on the horizon, taxes will be levied, and healthcare will change. Hold on to your butts.
Just take student loan like rest of the Americans mate. This aint charity in here.
I went from 45k to 4k in two weeks. Back at 25k today the climb is real.

My girlfriend has chosen a nickname, out of nowhere, for my penis. She has chosen, for some god forsaken reason, to call it 'princess little piddles'. I have no idea where she got this name but it's not the most manly nickname, and honestly, I don't even have a nickname for it so why should she?? Every time she calls it by her nickname, I feel ashamed!

Am I the asshole for making her stop calling it that? Or should I just let her keep it up? I'm afraid this waking nightmare may never end.

UPDATE: I spoke with my girlfriend regarding this nickname fiasco. She informed me that it was not the princess that was little, it was the piddles that were little. That didn't make me feel much better tho.

I offered another nickname, per another user, "princess big and long piddles" but she said that was a mouthful. We compromised on allowing me to pick a nickname for her penis. Thanks everyone.

Thanks for sharing.  AMC is in a particularly bad spot compared to other cinemas because they also financed some upgrades and acquisitions pre-pandemic.  Also, fully agree with your closing comments.

"AMC is in tight corner, as it acknowledged. It has about $5 billion in debt and high debt means high interest expense. AMC, which is majority owned by Chinese conglomerate Wanda, racked it up pre-pandemic with a string of acquisitions, dividend payments and upgrades to its theaters." - [Source](https://deadline.com/2020/10/cinema-stocks-teeter-wall-street-ponders-possible-amc-entertainment-bankruptcy-1234596738/)
most stocks that pay over 2% do so because their stock went down, not because they paid a huge dividend to begin with
VOTE!
I need wsb to give me a guaranteed loser for today. I’m talking -99% within minutes type plays
Small business aren’t on the exchange

There is not a scenario where we know that Trump wins tonight.
Was hoping for tsla dump so I could buy more shares , owell gonna pick 100 more and sell some cc for that thetap
Bear b fuk
Rut up 2% again. Isn’t small business dying in the pandemic? Or right what pandemic
One of you guys actually did DD on Wayfair saying they earnings whisper was a much bigger number than analysts were expecting or something like that. And then said it was bullish af.
If you didn’t see that coming, you are not a bear but a donkey.🐴🐪🎠
This sub is one step away from posting flat earth videos as DD
Viable renewable energy stocks (like TSLA) are going to crush either way. Whacky energy stocks (like windmills) are going get taxpayer money if Biden wins.
If either candidate wins and the other accepts it, we will moon.
Lol town sports / latitude gyms filed for bankruptcy. Thats what they get for charging me a month after i cancelled my membership😎😎😎
So if I have Tesla calls on Friday, who am I rooting for to win? I think Market will go up regardless this week. Last week was a down week. 2 Green Day’s to start off. I’m hoping Tesla hits 420 this week.

XLE going up in anticipation of a Biden victory. Yeah shit doesn't make sense, someone explained yesterday why it does, I forget why
Betting on clear winner and a green pump day after election. Bought my call spread super cheap when we were 325.

I live in a small town and have showed up to vote for every election and has never taken more then 20 minutes.. we will see how today goes
If you ain't ready for 9:30 you ain't black
You’re assuming normal markets that are tied to rational metrics. What we have right now has never been seen before and there is no precedence to lean on.
Thanks bro
UVXY at $19.75 ON ELECTION DAY is free money. See y’all in Tendie Town 🤠
No, he’s talking about the PM drill
Lol, you did well
If you need spy 340 you bought at a terrible time lol
Wtf baba?
Nasdaddy lagging like a bitch
Taking this from you most recent article comparing yearly return. One of these being during a pandemic, I'd say the market doesn't care much which party is in the white house
Barack Obama (D): 12.4%

Donald Trump (R): 11.8%
I lost some money before the election, really temped to yolo into more calls but I probably should wait for the election to be over.
Massive red candles premarket?
Yeah. Bought a house in 2018. Haven't deposited money into my brokerage account in over a decade but have pulled cash out every year.
It’s harder when you’ve already been on top
You should probably head over to r/investing with those conservative ass positions. No one in this sub holds 100% shares in their portfolio. If you bought calls, you would literally have a million dollars already. 

Mods - Ban this man for being a total vagina
I've seen it all in this irrational market, fat red drop beginning of day and then green end of day. Then bears and bulls arguing about if volatility is priced in.
So if orange man wins we’re gonna moon hard tomorrow?
Why would you want to go? Expensive popcorn and grandma keeps staring daggers when I get a handy.

Thank god I held that W call
Wow Wayfair..
idk, on one hand, if this is close or a T blowout, then you are about to print. On the other hand, if it is a B blowout, you are going to take a haircut. I think you are probably ok, but keep an eye out for early exit polling results.

Golden. Took the day off tomorrow and put 36 on the calendar  so I can miss the constitutional law expertise most of my employees and boss will suddenly obtain overnight.
AMC can be whatever you want, but if you think movie theaters will go away that's delisuional. Ask Jeff B, Prime cinema coming soon.
It’s insane. Even with the news yesterday noonday cares.

We have a drive in theater, and they just showed a bunch of old movies all summer. I'm confused why AMC isn't doing the same
Do you have a daily 20oz Diet Coke addiction? Is that why you're day trading for $2.75 profit?

Biden bullish for oil, since he will shut down oil production, so big players will get larger share while oil prices increase. Smaller producers will go under.
Joe Biden literally caught flak during the primaries because he gave a private speech to Goldman Sachs in which he said “I have your back.”

Every president had “Middle East peace deals”.  This has been going on for decades and doesn’t lead to anything.  But ok, let’s give him that one.

The economy has been booming since Obama years, so I don’t see why that wouldn’t continue.  In the long run, Trump’s oil and coal obsession will put us in a worse place. It’s a dying industry, and it’s like trying to hold on to horse and buggies while the world moves toward automobiles.  I’d rather have the Dem’s push for making us a leader in renewable energy.  We don’t want to be left behind while the world moves on.

Wtf is his immigration policy?  Talking shit about other countries and putting children in cages?

Not sure what you mean by “weird tariffs.”  Trump is the one that imposes random tariffs on a whim, because some leader said something not nice about him.  And those tariffs are paid for by OUR companies.

Trump barely has any concrete policies.  His only plan for the economy is giving tax breaks to those that don’t need them and to prop up outdated industries like coal.  And even with coal, where are all those coal plants he promised to bring back?  They are not coming back.  It’s just bullshit pandering.   On healthcare, where is this “best healthcare for a lot cheaper” that he’s promised since before his first term?  Doesn’t exist.  And his foreign policy is based on which foreign leader said something nice or bad about him.

Don’t be fooled.  He’s an empty suit that just says whatever people want to hear.

God these puts are gonna get annihilated at open. Yesterday was bad even buying at the top. 

That guy who made the 300 million dollar bet on SPY rising during election was right I guess because this week is fucking retarded.
Just told my dog that today is Election Day. He had no idea. Couldn’t believe it
I sold SPY 337 Calls expiring 11/4 yesterday. Should I close?
It’s no but November so I’m stuck doing drugs and gambling. Gotta do what you gotta do

bruh i yolod my entire portfolio on one spy put at end of yesterday, do i sell this shit and take huge loss at open or what
Why would you go to the wedding
[deleted]
Why would it be? People have been able to vote for weeks now. It's never taken me more then 30 minutes to vote and many states have rules requiring employers to give you time to vote.
I’m talking bout voting. Participating in Democracy 🤷🏻‍♂️
Of course - but just watch what they do, not what they say. For example, Illinois is raising taxes yet again on property owners and everyone else. They will also simply issue more debt to 'kick the can' just a bit longer. At the end of the day, they will tax their populace into financial oblivion, vs. actually default on their debt - they know the moment that happens it's game-over.
420 contracts on Jan 43$ calls baby, im gonna retire 19 years old bitchesss

you are fucking retarded
Is there a reason you waited this long? Did you state not have early voting? Regardless, thank you for voting no matter who you vote for
Idk what to tell you, early voting was open for like a month AND MAIL IN BALLOTS. I think you’re just not interested, which is fine, but don’t blame it on not having ten minutes

So uh, re-up on more PINS puts? Tech needs a viagra at this point.

Me personally? No. Probably like 2-3 mins tops. But when you have hundreds if not thousands of people all trying to vote the same day then it does take hours to actually tick them boxes.
Imagine forgetting that the big boys use the sentiment here to pull the rug and fuck over retail

I do not trust this gain enough to be bullish
If I get assigned it sucks but ill have made 50 on 600 in two weeks so I can't complain

SPY puts, ICLN leaps
The polls that supported trump in 2016 (Rasmussen, USC) came out predicting overwhelming Biden victory. So less chance of contested election.
Depends if it's obvious Biden win and trumpo just being sore loser, or of it's close and PA is the decider.
People trying to get ahead of the post election bounce. I wouldn't get too excited about 1% after the huge drops we've seen.
You seen how much it’s up since ipo? 😂people here know nothing I swear.

The company aims to be cash flow positive by 2023, when it forecasts annual revenue will exceed $500 million.

Aren't municipalities current facing insane budget crunches right now? What are the odds on your munis blowing up?
Well I am fuk
Shocking that we haven't seen any DOMESTIC TERRORISM from the left then. Zero plots to kidnap or harm political opponents. Zero convoys attempting to block access to voting. The death throws of a desperate cult. When's this shit gonna click for you ignorant bastards?

At this point my theory is the Biden win was already priced in last week when the correction happened.  We'll still have a red day this week but nothing like a crash.  Market being red during the election was just too obvious of a play.  But they're banking pretty hard on no civil unrest.

So are we selling renewable energy and cannabis calls at open or holding?
Don’t listen to these retards saying buy now because it’s going to 40$. If you’re trying to invest invest then buy 20k worth over the course of 4 months.
Yea unless you are blind. If biden wins he's gonna give stimulus from 2-3 tril. With trump it's probably more limited.. It's simple to see how that would impact the market right? And that's without looking at chinese companies. Just b/c you are stupid doesn't mean we all have to be

Winning 65 millions vs 62 million in a country of 350 million isn’t a majority either; it’s a plurality.

So yes, I agree with you about YOLO moves and  especially if you like men who wear women's clothing. One more fa🅱️🅱️ot on  this sub🍆💦
Yeah the mods are obviously conservatives and extremely biased. But I think they eased up for election week on the bans 🤷‍♂️
Ok man. Keep buying those putz lmao. Go for broke!!
Haha sounds good to me
**My reasonings for investing in NIO:**

1. EV is becoming popular everywhere and China is pushing hard for it. For example, the state of Hefei recently loaned $1 billion into NIO.  
2. China is at the forefront of tackling climate change; President Xi Jinping says he aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.
3. They have the biggest market for EV and its middle class is growing rapidly (I believe it's predicted to be 550 million in three years, more than one-and-a-half times the entire U.S. population today).
4. Demand is growing for their cars - they are setting new records in sales every month so far.
5. It's still in its growth stage so there's lots of room for its share price to grow. They are already doing relatively well domestically and have still yet to expand to the rest of the world. 
6. I like how NIO focuses on the customer experience, much like what Amazon did with their brand. This is evident by its high referral rate through word of mouth.
7. I think it's criminally undervalued at the moment because it's a Chinese company. Investors are afraid to put their money in because they are scared of fraud, which is totally understandable, as it has happened in the past with other companies like Luckin Coffee, but I am optimistic this opinion could change in the future.
8. China as a whole is pretty much back to normal post-covid, at least compared to everywhere else. I think this stability will entice more investors to invest into China in the foreseeable future.
9. I like the look of their cars and can see myself buying one if they come to my city.
10. I have a good feeling about the CEO. He's an interesting character with lots of strong connections. He has grit and seems to not be in it for the money, but for the future of China.
Calls on Caesar ?
Trump was the best gift China and Russia ever got. Twitter rambling doesn’t hurt China.

They use to be absolutely ridiculous about political bans. I think they learned to ease up since you can’t filter everything like that during election time 🤷‍♂️ they might as well let it run it’s course and then go back to normal in a week or two hopefully when things settle

Yup true. Not terribly worried I knew the risk of playing the election volatility. It expires 13 NOV so might have time to correct itself or run up more. Either way I'll profit and the good news is the puts I sold are dead in the water.
There should be a age limit on candidates. Like 60 or something.

Here’s my point and it will easily be proven but there are so many Brexit from the Democrat party whether it’s gay and lesbian blacks Latinos that you have none of that on the Republican side.

Agree fuck off with the politics
You should actually buy before the election because the market usually goes down a week to days before the election and then bounces back to higher values after the election date. Altough this is only true for the last two elections with Obama and Trump and sometimes it has gone down like with GW so it's still a gamble and with this year it wouldn't suprise me one bit.

PayPal takes a tiny percentage of all the “business” transactions.

I’ve bought things in person (instruments off craigslist) and paid the dude with the “friend” option on PayPal so they don’t have their income tapped by PayPal in the exchange.

Needless to say - PayPal isn’t going anywhere because of their online checkout for small business owners.

It's useful if you don't want to share your bank/credit card information with every website. Now there are alternatives but PayPal still seems like the most widely accepted for that purpose.
Bro, I make make like 20k in a 2nd world country. And i buy option with half of my salary. This is the WSB way.
Everything beginning to slowly fade . Biggest rug pull of all time by EOD
It’s not even changed dude stfu man
Kanye, mango, sleepy would've also fit, imo
last week was red as fuck why would you have puts this week? if anything, you buy puts tonight after 2 green days and election day. still a gamble.
🌈🐻SQQQ choke me 😫💦🐣🐥🦆
Finally, a stance I can agree with.
Take profits before you get caught bag holding when it dips
more like a blue sweep and a big stimulus
WSBSynth is up again. I’m so fucking hype for today
This will age great when Biden wins
Don’t worry I underestimated my losses on OSTK calls and missed this dumpster fire somehow
If money was the issue, then bloomberg can spend billions and win the election but did he
LOL XD GG!
This is fucking amazing
Petty AND dumb. Not even remotely surprising.
The 10k I lost and couldn’t afford to lose is a lot less funny when I’m not constantly reading/commenting on the daily thread.
Just imagine the benefits. Maybe Rosie, Ellen, George Lopez and friends might finally bounce like they promised they would the first time.  WTF is a Whoppi anyway?
Dick and ballsack pattern.
futes baby what is you doin
Ok what’s ur point?! That don’t mean biden gonna win
U guys depend on the service industry, specifically tourism. What are u guys really manufacturing aside from toothpicks and pencils? Europoors 😂
There is no rational reason why the market is up.
If Trump is re-elected, weekly puts are ze best move. Like 310P 6/11, perhaps even 300P, if you brave enough.
holy shit nobody click anything on that site!
This sub promised me tendies if I bought puts before the election......

I think we can afford a few defense cutbacks
Mango nearly lost to *Hillary*, and you think he’s going to win in a landslide?
If you don't mind sharing, how old are you and are you still holding on to a large pile of cash? Do you think you think you will be buying more NIO shares any time soon? And what's your number in terms of pulling the trigger and selling your shares for profit? 

I'm in a slightly similar position to you and am just curious of your risk tolerance and circumstance
No but US won’t leave NATO under Biden. So defense picks might not be too bad
I'll take it! I'm set for a 45c in february lol so any run up again would make me very happy
Who cares? Ssl is now the standard of web browsing. Any site that doesn't do ssl tells me that they don't really give a shit or is a scam

If you have 300k do it with a stock you're okay with holding long term. APPL for example. If you buy it right now at this current time and sell a covered call at 110 expiring 12/4. Youd get $12k instantly.
Hey now
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack
You’re in luck. Either candidate will stoke the market most likely.
Its election day and I recommend listening to today's daily thread on [wsbsynth](https://wsbsynth.com/) for maximum entertainment. 
It's fucking hilarious
[deleted]
Cant even figure out who's who in ur description, except that kanye isnt the second one.
People that advised 21-25 year olds to "go to college" really saved their little white collar asses. Lots of blue collar service jobs are screwed but you're right, most office jobs can be done from home on Zoom calls. It's the restauranteurs that I feel bad about, hopefully they're getting rent forbearance or some sort of relief since Pelosi hijacked stimulus to help sleepy Joe get elected
Easy win, its in the bag already don’t even need to bother standing in the queue for hours to vote.
I'm going to say this with all sincerity.

If Trump loses, sell.

The cash you're able to keep will allow you to take advantage of the dip.

I know I'm like billionth person to tell you this, but the economy isn't what it seems.

If you really looked at the numbers and understood the game that was being played you'd cash out.

Once Biden comes in, this fairytale land of stonks only go up will crash down as forclosures and bankruptcies shoot up. Additionally, if a vaccine is found, it'll be a sell the news situation. That will signal to companies that it is time to come out of hibernation, declare bankruptcy, and recapitalize.

But congrats on your gamble win. And remember it's when you sell that counts...not your paper gains.
Hi! What's the point of having a stupid Paypal account? Had one, never needed it. Don't think I need it.
So we ended the day with vix relatively high and overnight with no real news vix just dies? Yeah I’m not buying it. There’s some major fuckery going on.

Oh, nice. MM’s are squeezing the paper handed retards I see.
Reminder that if going long on volatility was free literally everyone would do it all the time.

Watch that decay folks
As bears would say... sell your positions its going to drop... works vice versa to it doesn’t stay down and out forever
They don't even have proper ssl setup.
This is sooo accurate
This one time,  stocks went up before they went down.
Russians have a vaccine already as they did not drop the research when western medical companies did when SARS fizzled out and they could not make money in it anymore.

but considering that this is a virus which mutates as much as flu, i doubt the new vaccines would be anything than a band aid on a full blown wound. even flu vaccines just protect against 3 of most common strains out of over 300 outthere. corona at this point already has probably over dozen strains

and the Moderna selfmutating vaccine sounds like a beginning of every zombie movie

and the biggest issue, well good luck getting people vaccinated. people are against vaccinating kids with 40+year established child vaccines and you think they will just line up for something that was conjured up within a year, so they can fly with airplanes or go to bahamas? suddenly the life in suburbia in SFH with trips to woods sounds very appealing
You just said it again...BAN

trade war caused a larger percentage deficit in overall trade.  we got less rub for the tug.
I dont think you understand what covered calls is. To sell 300k covered calls, he would have to own the shares. So he already is yoloing and buying 300k worth of shares.

There are multiple outcomes that are close and potentially contested:
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/

Although Biden currently has a 90% of winning according to the forecasts, 97% probability to win the popular vote.

Trump is already trying to discredit mail in votes and wants votes that are counted after election day to be disregarded. Something the forecasts wont be able to model. But mail in voters are leaning democratic.

I fear that he will try to steal the presidency this way. Market wont like this for sure.
MSFT looking tasty

VIX is a product you trade intraday or hold with heavy decay until something happens

interesting perspective. That would certainly catch USA by surprise 🍿
It's out there but no company has the capital or balls to invest the capital to get it for at least 50 years, probably more than that.

This is a support group for autists after they lose money on options right?
Welcome to Pre-market pajama trading, where everything is made up and the points don’t matter. That's right! Futures are just like your birthday, since your dad left to pick up milk and cigarettes
So let me get this straight. 

You decided that since your job isn't secure, why not just buy the stock too?

I understand the film business better than you, so I know your biggest issues. One of which is that theaters usually do a lot better when it rains. However, during Coronavirus, who the eff wants to go to the theater if they'll get the COVID? So that winter attendence uptick is just fantasyland.

Beyond that all of the Studios have pushed back their tent poles so good luck selling much more than a dozen hot dogs during your prime set. Oh yeah, didn't you hear? All of those mid tier films are going directly to Disney Plus and Netflix too. So all of that ticket margin that you would have received from sucky films like Artemis Fowl, Hamilton, and Mulan from lower film rental costs are gone as well. They are Disney +'s problem now. 

AMC is just waiting until Studios start to produce films again for directly for the theaters. When they do, it'll take months before they get them filmed and through post. Then they'll probably try to cut corners on marketing spend...so it will be even slower than that. The perfect time to declare bankruptcy is right before a new slate of films hits the movie theaters, but they won't have the cash flow to last that long. 

By the way, did you see what Warner and Disney just did? Yeah, they said that the people who run their streaming services are now in charge of their theatrical production slates as well. Kilar got hired at that dumpster fire AT&T Warner Blows and a bunch of digital suits are now in charge at Disney. So when a decision to greenlight the next film comes around for theaters, the digital guys probably won't care as much.

You'll know you are 100% toast when the Marvel films start going directly to Disney +. We're not there yet, but it's getting closer and closer...and you can only hold Black Widow for so long before the executives rationalize that the Disney + Sub revenue is worth it. (Not a smart decision, but I've seen dumber...and if things don't open up again next summer, Disney isn't want to hold the P&A costs on their balance sheet all the way through 2022.) 

Do yourself a favor and learn how to code. Or something you can do that doesn't involve cleaning empty theaters or asking a couple of they would like to upsize their order.

It's going to be a tough couple of years. The theaters are gonna burn through captial like there's no tomorrow because landlords are beholden to their debt holders and building rents are a big part of the operating cost structure.

AMC will come back eventually. Just don't bank your financial future on it being before they declare bankruptcy or recapitalize a half dozen times.
My friend’s a virologist and actually told me this virus is extremely unlikely to mutate.

Mutations come from errors in replicated genetic code, and this virus is extremely good at making its genetic code consistent - which is actually a stroke of luck for us.

So if trump get elected again shit gonna be wild cause he wouldn’t give af any more it’s going to be his last 4 years anyway he gonna just do whatever tf he wants
Honestly it’s just a game from now on for me.
I have more money in the market than I earn in 10 years working as a student.

I cashed out my investment ~3k at start and another ~2k to hold my positions while they were dropping or to buy more in early July.

This money wouldn’t change much in my life right now since I don’t have anything I’d like to buy. I have a car and after paying bills I still have money left so I see no reason to sell now.

I would only sell once I need the money or it’s an amount that would set me up for life.

Heyy fellow Singaporean degenerate gambler!
Contest results in legal way, shit will drag for some time. Not USian, so not sure how the mood feels like, as in whether any candidate's supports are nuts enough to pull a curfew-level batshit acts.
VXX calls incase the election is crazy and/or orange man angry

SLV long dated calls because no matter what happens we are getting stimulus sometime in the next few months
It might bounce...  at least it would in a normal week.  That’s a lot of growth for one week.

But for an election week, anything goes.  If Biden starts getting a big enough lead (even with trump contesting), I think Plug is going to start pushing up even more.
That day with the big drop overnight was a trick to get people to buy puts. Expect steep drop again this afternoon going into tomorrow after everyone gives up on their puts and gets into calls.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
You jelly your candidate isn't a LYRICAL GENIUS

Straight facts. Most the people in the sub have the money coming from their rich parents or old scumbags . It’s easy to gamble money that isn’t yours, you didn’t work for that they just give it to you. For someone that works his ass off in order to invest is not a good thing to do options. So yes I agree with you about buying stocks if your young and especially if you worked hard for that money.One less autist on the sub🤙

A googolplex is the number 10googol, or equivalently, 10. Written out in ordinary decimal notation, it is 1 followed by 10100 zeroes, that is, a 1 followed by a googol zeroes.

Dow Jones is up
Bruh wer on the same boat

Iv been buying donkey kang Jan options since it dropped to sub 50. Some of em lost at least 70% value. Decided to short some delta by selling calls. Definitely helped a lot with cutting the losses. Also rolled them to mar and may. Im now holding 20x 45c Mar and 10x 50c May calls. Best of luck buddy

Edit: i rolled them midweek last week. IV is crushing my ass. I think some of my calls dropped even the stock went up ytd. So maybe u wanna check out iv rank and percentiles before buying
What does it has to do with today?
vix is only down 3%

not too bad
Lmfao for real, WSB is retarded thinking that it’s going up bc of a Trump win, nah, Biden has Wall Street backing him, & amazon is crashing bc Biden said he’ll make Jeff bezos pay his share of taxes from now on.    
    
Edit: GOLDMAN SACS personally said they’re hoping for a blue wave so the market will be less volatile & it’ll be good overall for the economy
it needs stimulus for people to keep buying their shit, anyway might as well wait till after election
I think the Grinch would fit in better but well played.

Next week. After the euphoria wears off and we realize Adderall Donnie and Cocaine Mitch have 3 more months to wreck things for Biden to fix, the correction will ramp up.

what makes you think that other than just repeating shit you hear on WSB?

wall street is backing biden and democrat senators, hoping for a blue wave. 5X the wall street money going to blue vs red. And wall street is the single largest source of campaign finance.

So I wouldn't count on the market rallying if Trump pulls an upset.
Buying puts for the inevitable shit storm that’ll happen
Interesting. My company just pretends it’s not happening and doesn’t tell anyone. I haven’t seen one of the other drivers in a few weeks now

This is your captain speaking. If you look out your left you will see us passing the low 330s. Those seated on the right are afforded a view of what looks to be a protest at the now largely defunct NYSE. A band of what appears to be homosexual bears are throwing red dildos and trying to light the building on fire with a zippo. It remains unclear what they are protesting.

well no matter what happens, it's been a helluva year
Yes, but what’s scarier is that trump stocks did much better. DFEN GEO and oil all pumped harder on high volume. Though one can argue that’s due there being a lot more value in those stocks vs clean energy which has ran up hard in the last few months

Maybe, but to risk that yield,you can lose so much more as well. While it's daily entertainment watching the autists on here sticking their nut in TSLA, MSFT, etc. repeatedly - I prefer boring and faithful as where my main nut goes.

STO (sold) -NIO NOV13 $40c for $.48

Total cost basis $70
Look imma be real with u chief. I tried for years to see both sides and not be biased. You’ll notice this sub leans left as well. Truth is, republicans (not all but the current state of the party) are propagandists who prey on the ignorant, morally bankrupt, and religious. You don’t hear about dems doing bad things because the scale that they do bad things is nowhere near the scale at which republicans do them. Yes they are corrupt, yes they are hypocrites, yes they go too far and are overly obnoxious on many issues. 

But what it boils down to is you’re asking to give some comparisons against a landfill versus a trash can. Yeah I can point out all the trash in the can, but is it really that relevant when the other option is a landfill filled with thousands of times more trash.

That’s the gist. Bad things are: still corporatists who take money from big business like pharma, Wall Street, gas, etc. yet claim to want to police them. They are also corrupt, no doubt. It’s just they are beholden to voters who actually care about it and members of their own party who do as well so because of that they can’t be blatant about it and uncaring. This does seem to work better than Republicans who don’t care that they are corrupt and actively root out the non corrupt ones. Ie: primaried any GOP Congressman who said they’d like to do action on climate change. 

And you look at the establishment and they just really suck. The main fault of a democratic system is that it is beholden to the voters (which also happens to be the main strength lol.) so the crime bills in the 90’s were also so so bad and passed by dems even though they were awful. But republicans used buzzwords (https://youtu.be/X_8E3ENrKrQ) to capture bigoted voters and started winning a lot with the war on drugs and cracking down on crime. So dems kept losing that battle so bill Clinton adopted that language as well. Which allowed him to win back then and pass a horrible crime bill that screwed over a lot of people with over policing that just doesn’t work. Biden and Hillary also involved in this and they are the recent and current faces of the party. And you see Trump attack them for it.

The political game is a hard one because if the voters are dead wrong or ignorant or bigoted, in order to win you have to appeal to them. So the dems have failed and done bad things as a result of that. But normally it’s because republicans started to do so in the first place and forced the dems hand lest they lose more and more. 

This is why people always say both parties are the same. Republicans do something to get an edge, normally something morally reprehensible, dems follow it to take away the edge. Average people get screwed: war on crime, using racially motivated language like “super predators”, taking money from big money, I could go on. 

The most recent being the Supreme Court debacle. Republicans do an unprecedented measure and don’t allow an Obama appointee Merick garland to be appointed even though he’s centrist and a compromise. Instead McConnell stalls, “wait til after election” even though that’s never happened ever and is a blatant cheating tactic. Then trump wins boom they get a super conservative judge in. Then similar situation comes up and ginsberg dies and then dems (try to) do the same as republicans did with Scalia dying during Obama. Then everyone is like wow dems are hypocrites both are the same. If you have the brain of a goldfish yeah they are hypocrites. But if you understand how setting precedents work then you’ll understand that a new normal was set by republicans and if dems had any hope to retain power they’d have to play their same game. But the republicans win either way because if dems do nothing then they consolidate more power and if dems try to fight them they can say they are hypocrites. And what’s funny is they got both bc dems suck at the political game so they got called hypocrites and let a religious nut job with no judge experience take the seat. 

Which gets to the final point which is that dems suck at playing politics. They just lose and lose and lose and lose bc they don’t play dirty until it’s too late. They never have the upper hand. And they are short sighted and get called out for it later when they stoop low. 

Bernie is just about the only one who played the long game and almost won. He stuck to what he knew was actually correct and it almost worked at the highest level. He still won though and radicalized millions to go farther left. 

So yeah, you can tell I’m left leaning so whatever you can say my info is biased. (And also bias is a term used by those without facts on their sides to discredit.) bias doesn’t really exist, not at the level people think it does. I’ll just tell you that i spent many years trying to understand both sides and see what they were saying and I can’t deny reality anymore. Republicans are a sham of a party built on ignorance, corruption, and bigotry. 

Somethings are just true, they are facts. Climate change is real and literally scientifically proven and there’s only one party in the country that acknowledges that. Doesn’t that make you think? There’s literally something we know is real, the world knows is real, based on hard data, and 50% of the politicians in the country don’t believe it.... I can’t trust the opinions of people who are so fundamentally wrong on an issue as to deny reality, how can you trust anything else they say? 

So when you ask, what are dems doing that’s wrong. I laid it out, I hope. And you also answered your question. The reason people don’t say the things dems are bad about is not that reddit is overly biased, it’s thats it just doesn’t exist even a little bit the same as the republicans. It’s just not the same. It’s landfill with only trash, versus a trash can with trash in it and like maybe a few still sealed bags of candy. 

Anyways, hope you like my wsb thesis, this subreddit despite its stupidity, faces reality head on because the everyone’s bottom line in here is based on reality. That’s why nio goes up and oil goes down despite what republicans spew. It’s just not the same between dems and republicans which Is why you don’t see the bad dems do on reddit, not here or elsewhere besides r/donald_trump lol

I could talk about this all day so if you read this, that’s dope. If not, hey I organized my thoughts at least lol

bull trap
yeah that is what everyone is thinking, but what happens if banks decide not to lend because rates are to low? then you don't get an increase in the money supply, bonds skyrocket because of all the QE, the market crashes because of a lack of cash, everybody rushes to bonds that are rising rapidly, banks sell you the overpriced bonds and buys back the equities at a huge discount, and they play everyone
And we're green. For now.
Green
Erection time yet?

You = banned, NIO = bankrupt
paypal or visa monthlies?
Been using this strategy since I found this sub around November last year. Hasn’t failed me yet. Just have to wait a bit. Most recent one was snap puts a nice 48% on those. Next one is NIO sub 32
We’re up like 1-2% literally every night and every single day you guys manage to convince me to buy puts
Personally I’m a long time NIO investor and very bullish with the company. Here’s why:

It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can’t manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It’s a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It’s impressive offering different concepts than Tesla’s market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don’t have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here’s a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw

What on that chart says a pullback is coming? It’s literally a fucking staircase!
The effects are truly spread overtime. Like education spending will increase productivity over the next 60+ years. Similar effects for all policy. 

But the stock market is forward looking and if people expect increased taxes on capital gains coming in a few months, they may start selling off early to avoid bag holding. So libertarians would say “yeah the markets always tank at the end of our presidential cycle, because the political pendulum is coming and investors* are trying to sell off before the communists get into power.”

 Thank you very much.  Thank you.  So beautiful out here.  And thank you for joining us as we announce a massive and groundbreaking concession.  And as you know, it’s already setting records — records like nobody has ever seen before.  Concession talks are going well.  Voters voted.  We set records, incredible records, world leaders are calling me saying these are the most incredible concession numbers they've ever seen.  I still may fire Fauci, I don't know.  They say I will. When the pandemic struck, there were zero concessions for the China virus, but we’ve marshaled all of America’s resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities.

We slashed red tape and approved emergency concession authorizations for.  That’s how great the concessions are that we have.  I invoked the Article 112 and made more concessions than any other president ever has before.

We’ve done nearly twice as many concessions per capita as France, Italy, and Germany, and over six times more concessions per capita than South Korea.  We’ve done far more than any other country, usually times two, three, four, five, or six.  We’ve performed nearly 40 million more concessions than India. These really are incredible concession numbers. Oh before I forget take these pens, here you go.  Crooked Hilary would have never brought you pens, but I did.  You know I had these pens.  Alot of people said I didn't have these pens.  But i have these pens. More pens than anyone has given out before.

With that I'd like to announce I've formed a concession task force.  I've appointed Bill Barr to oversee these concessions.  People say this will be the greatest concession task force ever..thats what they say.

I have no idea which one, but I know this vertical rally ain't good, probably
This is why i don't understand why zoomers have such euroboners.  This is where collectivism leads you.  Cultural homogeneity counter to America's individualism and multiculturalism.
How can I salvage the immense assfucking I’m going to take from my VXX calls? I made it so long without blowing up my account, I guess eventually we all become truly retarded.
Except he’s going to win.
It's looking really good for them. Several financial firms have upgraded their forecasted market value for NIO. Made a lot of headline news from the upgrades. This is what's causing the boom right now. Other things NIO has going for them..

1. China has more people who drive than there are people in the United States. Having a huge consumer market without even going international. If they go international shares will double again. 

2. The Chinese Government is requiring that 25% of all vehicles are EV by 2025. By 2040 or 2050 banning all combustible engines. 

3. A huge pension fund just sold their Apple and Intel stock to buy NIO. Source: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fund-sold-apple-stock-intel-bought-nio-zoom-video-51604003963

4. They are upping their production levels from 50k a year, to 150k next year. 300k in 2-3 years.

5. Their cars all immediately sold, always on back order for 6 weeks for every consumer. They just can’t manufacture them fast enough. Once manufacturing is updated it will double, and they will become profitable. It took Tesla several years to make profit from their vehicles.

6. The government of China has invested over a billion dollars in NIO to ensure they will be around for awhile. It’s a basically a government backed secure investment.

Ultimately, they really do produce high quality products. It’s impressive offering different concepts than Tesla’s market. NIO vehicles have batteries that can easily be swapped in 3 minutes for a full charged fresh battery. Reaching more consumers who don’t have garages, and live in apartments. 

Here’s a cool video featuring the NIO on YouTube: https://youtu.be/hTsrDpsYHrw

Not sure if you're asking him to elaborate or calling him an *elaborate retard*.
$10,000 in how long? One month? I have $300,000 too.
Look at the daily chart. We’re at the middle point where we either rally hard or drop to the next support level, no one knows what will happen til it does
Nothing gets past you.
Will go long tomorrow. Easy money lol
Have small positions atm so i don't get IV crushed, waiting to see where we're going. this is a binary event and we're gonna get big up/downsides after

How much to make $9,000? I have $300,000 too. How much can I make a month? What is it called specifically so I can research it? I can make $9,000 a month off $300,000? How??

Look, there isn’t going to be one magic solution right now. While there are advancements in green tech for homes and cars right now that RNG is not suitable for, there are still many other pollutants—semis, trains, etc—for which we are simply not there yet. Healy knows this and has discussed initial R and D into stuff like hydrogen, but such a network has yet to be built out.

Doubt it
I've heard a good definition of (not super) wealth is...   
Stage 1, buys off brand items and lives paycheck to paycheck.   Stage 2, buys on brand regularly, and can splash out without hurting on a meal / a household item like a laptop, but doesn't regularly.
Stage 3, doesn't worry about getting value from purchases and regularly stays at the more expensive hotels as this doesn't affect their wealth.

Give a look at early voting polling in the last two days. It’s much different proportionally than what you saw in the month leading up when polling was focused on a different demographic. It skews the way data is perceived
Dropped 20% within a week thus likely an oversold bounce/short squeeze
is anyone holding weed stocks during election
Y’all I’ve gotten about 4 hours of sleep in the past 42 hours and I don’t think sleep is in the cards for me tonight. Election got me jittered.

Historically a state like CA has received close to the national average in federal funds per person. And in regards to tax revenues you do understand that the top 1% contribute the largest proportion of income taxes. So a state like CA with high income executives from companies like Facebook and Salesforce are paying most of that tax. Exclude them and the federal tax revenue collected from the rest (the majority) of the state population really isn’t contributing that much.  We’ll see soon enough how long this federal funds donor status holds up for CA when companies like Tesla consider leaving for states like Texas and Nevada. On a side note, thank you for the SALT deduction caps ,TCJA 2017 🤗.
The people in this sub are so naive . As if election outcome matters ? Ever heard of the FED ? QE? why you think they putting Jerome Powell on all those stupid magazine covers recently . The president is a puppet . You are all fools. Only good bet is on inflation

Dude if you think people are somehow buying US stocks and holding them in euro value, you are legitimately braindead.

A broker based in Europe might handle the exchange for you and show you a value in euros, but the value of the stock is pegged to USD, and they will be sold in USD on the fucking market exchange when a European sells them.

So if a European buys US stocks and DXY drops, they are effectively losing value as they are holding a foreign equity in USD, which is dropping as compared to their local currency. 

The fact that I actually have to explain this to you is downright hilarious, frankly.
^^^^^^GUH
what if you would have put just one more dollar into there just think about that
Definitely, I don’t think this was a race thing. What people are saying where I live is that if people are willing to shoot people over a Trump sign, will they lose their shit if trump loses? 

Clearly, they don’t own property. It wasn’t about the sign, it’s about theft and trespassing. 

Still stupid to shoot tho. I would’ve understood that he’s not a really popular guy and that people might do shit to the stupid sign either ways. And I lean left
funny I was gonna ask if you lived in the midwest but I didn't want to dox you

calls
😰
That’s fairly logical. It just seems... dangerous to think that since that would suggest everyone is basing off of polling from mail in and very early voting and the population proportionally leans left who does that. Strikes me as complacency for one side like in 2016 is dangerous and all. Gl with your position btw

40%??? I want to start investing now with 50 pounds hoping for proffit to get me out of the hole and hopefully be able to pay rent this month.

hold them this rally end on election night
Oh my fucking god
There are Rainmeter widgets that can do that. May be delayed a few min depending on the service they pull from
I bet you were too scared to even ask.
Trump and it won’t be that close
Lmao found the genius
*Kanye win confirmed*
On reflecting upon my future losses from holding puts, I am not sure why bears are called gay

The market is inherently more likely to go up than down, and it takes true balls of steel to bet on this failing. Wouldn’t it then follow that the bulls are in fact gay, as they merely profit off betting that the market will go up similar to how rain falls from the sky?
That poll is surprising
Close my amc puts at open? Or hold and let them expire worthless. 50 Nov 6th puts $2
Sell the rumor buy the news..?
Hahahaha no more downvotes from you now bears ? What about you solitary ? Hahahaha losers

Fyi.. Elections are priced in bro.. Politic heads and smart money already know... They just aren't allowed to talk about it... It's a power game of the influencers and the influenced and right now the mainstream media is 'all in' on their ability to 'influence'.. Smart money already priced in your pre-determined conclusions based on their massive, "thought' campaigns... Just a heads up if you can't think for yourself...
Welp
My uvxy calls are fucked
[deleted]
I think the polls might be wrong. People like me are way too embarrassed to admit we are voting for the orange guy lol.
Still think kanye will fuck up some votes for biden
My logic:

Trump wins: The whole market rallies. TSLA gets pulled up with the rest of the market.

Biden wins: TSLA rallies as a safe haven stonk in association with the rest of the clean energy sector.
np baby. if you see me talk about buying it then you sell ok?
Had to wait for enough people to put their life savings in puts after the worse week since March

Thank you for confirmation bias.
Trump is winning, place your bets accordingly
Did you tell them about it?
Name a candidate with more foreign policy experience than Kanye. Think of all of the countries he’s been to on tour
$80/share is fair price for it. might go to $100 though.
I agree in principle, but honestly who the fuck knows in this market
LOLOLOLOL bears are fucked !!! BIG TECH FOR THE WIN !
I’m gonna get some midnight snack. Is Wendy’s like 24/7 or nah? Is there still Uber rn?
The market priced in more stimulus...all it means is that no one sold their positions...that is value stocks started to price higher on no news! Rather than new money entering the market, a sell off was planned on tech to fund these positions. Casino is rigged kids and unless you know someone that is in the know...well good luck!
and the market went up afterwards anyway. the only thing not priced in is stonks going up
I think I'm just going to stay cash gang like a little bitch until the election is decided, but at least I have a plan:

Trump wins: All in SPY 360C 12/18 

Biden wins: All in  ICLN 30C 12/18
I’m done expecting SPY movements this shit is retarded lol, maybe it’s because I assumed SPY would trap bullish positions and drop AH but it looks like we’re either rallying regardless of what’s going on in the work or this is the easiest entry for puts and I overthought it

Aw that’s cute, the poor is trying to tell us how to vote
from what I read ,apparently on the last election, the market bottomed before the results came out  ? that might be why ppl are pumping futures, its still a gamble
LETS GO BROS ! Lets make some money together and leave all these cry baby losers in the dust . Cream of the crop, let the dregs of this forum sink to the bottom and rage quit!

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb question again.
Ill post pics of my lambo when it does. Already up around 50%
Stared at the computer all day today. I’ve worked a lot today. I’ll be taking a day off tomorrow and Wednesday to enjoy the show
This is why you don't panic sell after a dip.

if its a swing state ill vote. it's very fucking far from being a swing state. if the electoral college goes away, I'll vote.
I talked with my dad today about how I paper handed my last two plays and both of them mooned once I was out. I was really pissed watching all my uvxy and sqqq tank while the calls I exited Friday for a loss were at a net profit for me today. 

He said to hold. Every time I bought something I had a reason, yet I paper handed when it wasn't working out only to watch it moon later. He was like "don't do that again, if you had a plan, see it through."

Who knows, could turn out poorly, but maybe Wednesday will be a huge sell off if the election goes really bad or Biden wins and trump says he won't leave office or something insane like that. All I know is I'm sick of giving up before I've even given it a chance.
Oh my god majulah moment right here guys.
Bruh

LETS GO BULLS ! Wipe these bear cucks out ! They won’t even be able to buy ramen after we finish with them !

I’ve never seen this sub further in shambles than tonight . All downvotes and crybabies . Make the bleeding stop ! 🩸 let’s go bulls!!!
Especially after the election is over and we get some positive catalyst going it’ll be a major run
have you like not looked? google it
I'm guessing he was quite young? Granted I've always had 'stuff' in my house, especially a sofa etc, but as I've approached 30 I've got way more into just making my house look nice and really considering the 'style' in the house and individual rooms. Before it was just a house I lived in, now I feel the need to make it into my home.

That really only came when I started living by myself and was emphasised this year because I'm staring at the walls 24/7. But like you say, if he's got a bunch of empty rooms, maybe he's just not bothered/thinking about what the rooms could be used for.

At the very least to make better predictions for 2024. Maybe your state will be a swingstate in 4 years ;)
Don't forget what happened to Nasdaq yesterday.
This is kinda funny ngl
You're welcome to read up on your history and pull data from the agencies to try and tie that to the market. 

I don't personally think what you're saying is impactful beyond the very short term initial reaction of election considering that actual policies would take a bit before they're even gone into effect. If a tax cutter gets elected, wouldn't the market be affected when changes goes into effect, which would be well into their elected term rather than expectations of a newly elected official at time of election? 

Even then, you're looking at only the stock market or GDP. Democrats consistently outperform Republicans in multiple measures, not just GDP. I'm talking about Poverty, Standard of Living, Unemployment, Growth of Median Income etc. Which imo would mean policy is a pretty major factor.
Voting for whoever makes my calls moon

Not with the housing crash next year. I sold at the absolute best time before the value fell. Over 25% of homeowners are facing foreclosure in 2021. I can invest the money, and buy another house after property values normalize.

Mango calling the Win at the crack of Dawn. SPY $380. You cant stop it.
At first I was like this is a rich sub. Then it hit me that itss only $16 per subscriber.

This range has been rejected like 20 times tonight. I'm always impressed how long bulls will buy into a sell wall. They have chutzpah

was definitely tempted to buy puts today but glad I didnt lol
More like Biden gets east AND west and Trump gets the middle.

Reasoning to why I sold my house: 
My house was extremely overvalued. The housing market in my area is forecasted to drop substantially next year. With over 25% of homeowners on the verge of foreclosure next year I decided to sell my home it it’s peak price. 

I was basically living paycheck to paycheck to keep up with the mortgage payments anyway. Lost my job, and said fuck it. I’ve been eyeing NIO all year waiting on the sidelines thinking about buying. Then finally decided to pull the trigger. Had I acted sooner, like back in May, I would have been a millionaire by now just on NIO alone. So far this past month, I’ve made more on NIO in one month, than I have with my regular annual salary.

Hmmm seems like 90% of this sub is balls deep in puts . Everybody dead silent rn and downvoting every bull comment
wtf no, that's like saying to a depressed bum to go inside a crack house, not a good idea
I hope he is, dude.
add an extra layer of protection before someone takes away the rest of your lifesavings

Probably safest to go cash and stay home for a few days. It won't be *terrible* either way, but definitely spicier than usual. Anticipate some supply shortages and non-essential businesses to be temporarily closed in certain areas. Just treat it like hurricane season or some other natural disaster preparation. Lots of places near me boarding up, full grocery carts, people filling gas cans. Nothing too concerning but there's people out there genuinely fearful that will be snatching up more than their share of supplies. Remember the March TP crisis. 🚽

Also, i must add, that market rally after election results seems almost too obvious, doesent it? Although i do believe it will become self-fulfilling prophecy at least for this week.
It's shameful to be firmly associated with either party these days.

If 🥭 wins Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan I’ll make 1 month’s rent
yup and you and your science have come up with the cure to cancer so you are prepared to speak with mastery on the subject. or maybe you just hurl radiation at everything you dont understand, sometimes to heal, other times to destroy. good luck on your nuclear weapons development, hope you can get a good sleep tonight
Market closed tomorrow for erection day you morons .
That would require me to admit I have a problem
If spy dumps tomorrow my only move will be failing no nut November
>$16k...that’s bigger then probably 40% of peoples portfolios

That's actually really sad. A lot of older folks can't stop working because they need the money.

I'll save you some time. Just cashapp me the remaining and I'll guarantee you -$100k by noon.

There's a decent chunk of them I've met.  From hardcore republicans who are tired of Trump's crap, to dem/3rd party voters who bucked to Trump last time but now are desperate to vote for the other guy no matter who it is.  


And unfortunately, some people who hate Trump but will vote for him again because he has the (R) tag.
Remindme!
lmao I dint realize jack Dorsey was trying out a Rasputin look
Nobody cares about politics here you dumbasses need to realize this or stfu . Republican Democrats nobody cares . If you affiliate with either party you are a cuck ass simp , if you suck up the shit these politicians spew out you deserve to get clowned on . 🤡
It’s fucking hilarious, they get cyber bullied and people don’t forget
PLTR gonna be needed to figure out who wins ...
Such effort just to say Lib lmao chill homie
Big Tech will genuflect to the democrats, but make no mistakes the power of the Democratic Party is in California.
When it feels like there’s absolutely no way we’ve hit bottom.
So you can pay $3,000,000 down for the $700,000 in income and put the $2,000,000 into repairs. Then you'd be getting a ~12% return on your capital employed and cashflowing back the $700,000 each year for a couple of years before the rax?
No matter who wins tomorrow I just want to say... fuck RKT you piece of shit stock

Its crazy how apathetic you can become about your own money when it comes time to cut/justify losses.  The more open losers, the easier it is to ignore and hope they fix themselves.

As much as it hurts, gotta clean house and focus on plays that work now.

Super long run 10+ years, more than likely no... the only hope is currently technology for long distances with heavy load isn’t there yet for a pure battery play.  So the hope is there is a nice window where HYLN can dominate the market as one of the only viable solutions until batteries catch up... also another hope is that everyone will be focusing on trying to capture the car market and won’t have a ton of capital to invest in the big 18 wheeler market until batteries get much much better and that transition to create a pure EV class 8 truck becomes much simpler.


My suggestion is if you want buy a small position before the call, but wait until all the shares are unlocked before dumping a ton of money in it ... also I’m bag holding a bit so that’s where I stand

Was +18% today, probably shouldn’t have held some of the calls
I feel like WSB hops on the gravy train too late on stocks... like two years too late.

Example:

Me (2018): “ETSY is a great buy. They’re super undervalued because people think AMZN will destroy them.”

WSB: “No way 80 P/E!?! No way. AMZN will dominate all e-commerce.”

Me (2020): “ETSY stonk price too high imo. Would not buy stonk at this price, but will play short-term with options.”

WSB: “Shut-up 🌈🐻.”
I’m feeling pretty bearish... on people who bought Nio puts! 🤪
Better idea, they need more partners to make more people to make these kind of bets and work at McDonald's for the betterment of society and faster delivery.

Congrats 🍾
Yea but if you are setting the strike at like 60 bucks you get the profit from the sale at 60 plus the premium from all the WSB tards who think its gonna hit 60 bucks if it makes it there. I mean you can make your strike anything you want and however long out you want. Find a strike you are comfortable with and sell those calls, there are a lot of people who buy dumb options, take advantage.

>For instance, I've done research science (various radiation hardness tests relating to computer components so we can do better physics). 

Sure a little evil, as those are used in nuclear rockets that have to endure the radiation of space. You are helping facilitate the delivery of nuclear warheads onto your own people.

>It's science for science's sake, with maybe eventual applications once we understand the world better.

This is what is called in the bible "the anti Christ" not that I'm gonna strongly take that angle, but its obvious that pure science isn't helping and this world is going to shit.

>I have colleagues and friends that have done a large number of other things. E.g. applying drones and robots to agriculture to save water and improve yields. Or control algorithm research so that assembly line machines can move faster and last longer. One of my co-workers worked on network analysis at the switching level to track the spread of malicious worms across the internet.

This excessive complication is like "the weaver" tarot card. The spider gets caught in its own web. You and others are making the world too complicated to understand, and therefore impossible to diagnose and deal with.

A movement towards simplicity is necessary and needed, that includes scaling back the complexity of technology.

Germany wasn't that close to a nuke. Pretty sure they also had issues sourcing uranium, and the resources for their program became diverted and siphoned off to the rocket program. 

They'd also have issues delivering the warhead because of British long distance radar. They were also getting bombed to shit, like Dresden where 40,000 were burned to death, which was as bad as a nuke attack. But Germans bad because they are Germans, got it.

>That page describes the issues a prostate experiences (none of them blackening and shrinking), as well as describes what it's involved in (fluid secretion with a specific purpose in the ejaculate). No squirt gun action, no inflammation post-ejaculation. For a "disproving" kind of approach, this page states that it's the muscles at the base of the penis that propel ejaculate.

We're talking about something that occurs over a man's entire life here. You can't just stick a probe into a man's prostate and observe this in one day.

>No squirt gun action

thats not being honest is it? It kind of does work exactly like a squirt gun. The black dude that invented it was pretty smart, its the most basic design possible, and the male body also tends to be the most basic and practical design possible.

>Do you really want me to go find the specific action of the prostate? Your bladder doesn't fill with air when it empties. Neither do your intestines, or stomach. The action of the prostate isn't quite the same as those, but maybe a good analogy is salivary and sweat glands. They do not fill with air on expelling saliva, or sweat.

you are comparing the bladder with the prostate, which I don't think is valid. I don't think that the human body was designed to ejaculate. I think that its a function like vomiting. so it would make sense to me that the bladder doesn't get air, while the prostate could get air. And I also don't care if 99.9% of humanity disagrees with me. doesn't mean that they aren't wrong (they are)

also doesn't have to be a lot of air. just a tiny amount over a lot of time.

Also the expelling of the ejaculate is also a big factor. It's not supposed to go anywhere. Its just supposed to sit there and sit there. the act of having to produce new prostate fluid over and over and over again also creates irritation, and this overactivity also produces cancer. 

>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among Canadian men (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). It is the third leading cause of death from cancer in men in Canada.

You fucking retards want Biden to win when Mango has created the best volatility in the market in years. Imagine if we had a competent president we would have never had the March crash. We would have never experienced the joy of circuit breakers. And then that unbelievable bull rally oh my god that never ending streak of green. Those epic future reversals in the last 10 minutes it made me CUM so many times. You guys want all that to GO AWAY? THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST EXCITING YEAR OF TRADING IN CENTURIES!

The whole notion of Biden winning means America going back to its old ways are so out of touch. You have to realise that in some ways media love trump because he is full of stories and with the stories come ratings and $.

you thought the $rope meme was a joke?
Well, you should. I pay way less in tax rate as a small business owner than if I was an employee

I think people think loophole=secret. Loophole=way to reduce your taxes through deductions or credits. 

You do pay both sides of the social security tax when you are the business owner or self employed but there are so many more write offs. 

Have a home office? Write off a portion of home internet, mortgage, cellphone, etc. Use your car for work? Write off miles. Have enough expenses to itemize deductions on your taxes and it all snowballs from there. 

Make enough money where you can leave the profits in the company to invest? Start a C Corp to be taxed on the profits at a lower rate until you take the money out of the company. Compounding interest for the win. 

Want to own a plane? Buy it in an LLC. Rent it out 51% of the hours it flys a year and write off 100% of the depreciation on an accelerated basis. Same goes for a yacht. 

Make a lot of money and want the best way to create generational wealth? Buy apartment buildings and pay relatively little taxes (compared to normal income) through various write offs including depreciation and capitalizing any improvements. Just stay liquid and over time the small rent increases will build. 

Think of this. Buy a rental for $10,000,000. Put $2,000,000 into repairs, thereby adding value so the building is now worth $14,000,000. Net income on the rental is $700,000. However, since you had “expenses” of $2M you don’t pay any tax on that income for about three years plus you are also deducting depreciation despite the fact that the building is actually worth way more than you bought it for not less! 



As an aside, there used to be a tax deduction for buying a Range Rover. When you’d go to the dealer they’d give you a pamphlet explaining it. Basically, any vehicle over 6,000 pounds qualified for an accelerated depreciation schedule. I think the law was written to apply to farm equipment but a Range Rover ended up qualifying. I believe this loophole was since closed and I would think the private plane one gets closed eventually too.

Healy claims that RNG is carbon negative, so that, "In a weird way driving the truck is actually better for the environment"
This comment always struck me as a bit of an oversell. I understand the gist, that capturing methane from decaying feedstock that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere offsets the emissions from the truck, but the Hyllion drivetrains do produce carbon and particulate matter. 
It seems like a lot of environmentalists are becoming less supportive of so-called transitional solutions, in favor of pure play zero-emissions like full EV and hydrogen.
Will Hyllion be able to sell RNG hybrid engines as a viable green technology in the long run?

General Dynamics?  Boeing?  Raytheon? Is that you?
> but you actually haven't bothered to counter my point about the people behind science. these people are absolute animals. the people who invented nuclear weapons for example and utilized them on people.

Would you like to talk about a specific scientist? I can't prove or disprove some blanket statement about a large group of people. Certainly there are folks that take money from outside interests and let that influence their results, but they are not in the majority.

For instance, I've done research science (various radiation hardness tests relating to computer components so we can do better physics). I've done algorithm research for rejecting large volumes of noise. Are those evil? It's science for science's sake, with maybe eventual applications once we understand the world better.

I have colleagues and friends that have done a large number of other things. E.g. applying drones and robots to agriculture to save water and improve yields. Or control algorithm research so that assembly line machines can move faster and last longer. One of my co-workers worked on network analysis at the switching level to track the spread of malicious worms across the internet.

Are they, or their research, evil?

I also wouldn't use WW2 and nuclear weapons as an argument for the "evils" of science. The people working on this weren't evil, and nuclear research has plenty of civilian applications. Nuclear energy, and especially modern reactor designs, are one of the cleanest forms of energy we have. It just wasn't a particularly good time for humanity in general.

[Did you know that Germany was extremely close to a nuke?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_nuclear_weapons_program) Had the war lasted longer, would you want Nazi Germany to be the only world power with nukes?

Most modern science, by the way, teaches ethics alongside the general curriculum. If you want some further reading, take a look at something like [A Gift of Fire](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Fire-Ethical-Computing-Technology/dp/0132492679) (programming specific).

> Ok i read what you linked there. absolutely nothing that was written in those wikipedia paragraphs disproves what i said

That page describes the issues a prostate experiences (none of them blackening and shrinking), as well as describes what it's involved in (fluid secretion with a specific purpose in the ejaculate). No squirt gun action, no inflammation post-ejaculation. For a "disproving" kind of approach, [this page states that it's the muscles at the base of the penis that propel ejaculate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct).

> prove that its not air that is getting in there. there must be some blood or juice or some shit that immediately gets sucked back into the prostate to fill the significant volume of liquid that leaves it.

Do you really want me to go find the specific action of the prostate? Your bladder doesn't fill with air when it empties. Neither do your intestines, or stomach. The action of the prostate isn't quite the same as those, but maybe a good analogy is salivary and sweat glands. They do not fill with air on expelling saliva, or sweat.

> if you cant find something that fills that void then its obviously air

No. That's reaching. It is not "obviously air." It _may_ be air, if we didn't know anything about the prostate, but we do. If it's obvious to you, please provide support for your obvious assumption. Things that are straightforward should be easy to prove.

> what do you think there is a black hole or wormhole in your prostate or something? its immune to the laws of physics?

It's not. But I expect it functions like any number of glands on your body, none of which fill with air when active.
the Venga bus is comin' bitches!!!

It’s still a little bit of a gamble even to just buy stocks. But you have a trailing stop loss that is pretty conservative. A ton of solid companies triggered that stop loss.

I have a small investing account just for fun and Everyday I kick myself for not going balls deep in NIO. Still refuse to do it though.

Also, it’s nice that NIO is mooning but owning a house is so important for growth because of tax reasons. What made you make this huge gamble?

dude are you crazy? if the worst case scenario is you lose 50k you would be nuts not to take it

Is a Biden presidency the beginning of the Dow leading the Nasdaq now? Fuck this boomer shit.
Using a court to throw out fraudulent ballots is also fair game. I'm not trying to make a value judgment one way or the other. My only point is that he's going to claim victory and if anything contradicts him, he'll fight it every way he can. He will not concede, because he will not admit that he lost. He never has before, there is no reason to think he will now.
Isn’t the disadvantage to a covered call something like, if NIO goes higher than I anticipated I would have lost those gains?

Seems like it. I think the mistake was dems put all their eggs in the mail in voting basket, under the premise that higher turnout benefits them. Normally it benefits them cause the increase is normally because they are driving their target demos to the polls. The problem here is they sent ballots to the whole population. Once you do that, you have no control over who votes and who doesn't. Trump does like 4 two hour stand up special infomercials daily, so no surprise if that is a call to action to mail those in.
Off the top of my head 

1) accelerated depreciation
2) keeping profits offshore to avoid US tax
3) offshoring what should be American profit
4) segmenting a business to create pass through opportunities
5) sweetheart gov contracts from  your gov cronies
6) playing municipalities against each other for the best tax breaks on your physical locations (see tesla and amazon for examples)
7) stock option compensation programs 
8) carried interest 
9) the use of C corps 
10) intellectual property deductions 

Bonus! 
11) industry specific subsidies like for energy companies 

Rich person Bonus!
12) holding assets in various trust schemes 

Many, if not most, large corporations pay far far less that the quoted corporate tax rate. Corporations have bought all sides of our government so that isn’t going to change as long as people want to be re-elected.

Bruh this election gonna be like everything wsb has predicted before. Whenever ppl think shit is gonna moon or crash it just stays flat, the outcome tomorrow or whenever it happens will be pretty normal imo
Kamala and Pence were +10,000 so I threw each $5. One of these old geezers could croak or concede to their own VP idk shit is crazy
You’re right on that. But, vaccines aren’t 100% effective and there are groups of people who are allergic to vaccines and babies who are too young to get vaccines. There have also been cases of healthcare providers getting mumps even if they’re vaccinated by being exposed to such a large viral load

peak wsb well done
With future inflation as a consideration and without the consideration of future employment/business income I think $5 Million at 1-2% draw down is enough to live/retire on if your under 40. If your over 40, 3-4% draw down on $2-3Mil would work too.

We’re going red tomorrow, Trump brought lil pump on stage. So fucked.

Markets are rallying now on Biden landslide .. how will ur puts print if he wins ?
You have ITM puts?
MA
Just make sure you cancel the 15% trailing stop then if it gaps down overnight, otherwise it'll take the loss for you.
Tomorrow is not the day to make that point. I agree with you but you must see that it’s the game we have to play at least for this election
There's no duality it's the same man, just on different timelines, buying before the peak and after the drop

Top tier growth companies will have their down days or weeks but every dip is a buying opportunity.  Unlike SPY, they won't be rangebound between 250 and 350 for the next 5 years. That 50-100% annual upside is way better than maybe getting lucky on perfectly timing a 30% crash.
Kamala is dope af bring it on
remember that you broke up with her bc the sex wasn't worth the headaches. It still isn't worth it
Uhhhh I'm a little speechless from that. Viral load doesn't matter if you're capable of producing antibodies...
Funny, your ex just dm'd me about you being a simp
We broke up a year ago so I’m just confused
No lie this is amazing advice.
she’s an ex for a reason. smash then ghost her if anything
I’m comfortable with holding for up to 5 years before selling. I’m old school, and am willing to wait for any recovery.

I'd say $3M after taxes

Honestly, if you think Biden is bullish for the market short/medium term, you are an actual retard. 

🥭 and the gang propped up markets since March. He’ll drop that support if he loses.

A chance of them is priced in.

If they happen, it's very likely VIX will increase quite a bit.  But they aren't guarantees.  So the market is pricing volatility such that there's a chance for these things to happen.  You're pricing it in your mind like they already have.
Damn Trump is really gonna win this thing
The party that's not in power is always full of shit. Dems couldn't pass healthcare when they controlled the Whitehouse and both houses of congress. Republicans couldn't repeal Obamacare after freaking out about it on Fox News for 4 years straight.

Dems will pass a bill with less than what they're offering now.

11/9. I'm not planning to ride them all the way down, but I have to believe that between a drawn out count, a contested election, post election unrest, and soaring covid numbers there will be a day this week that offers up a chance to take profits.

Yeah I got some 2022 stocks that’ll probably expire worthless but fuck it
If you sold $50k apple shares after 2001 crash, you lost money and also missed out on $15m in 2020
If the democrats definitively take both the presidency and the senate there’s increased confidence in passing a stimulus this winter and that stimulus would be to the tune of $2.5T instead of $1T which is what it would be if the republicans retain both or if there’s a split.  Not to mention the prospect of no longer having a president who has a habit of tweeting whatever pops in to his brain and tanks the market as a result.
I think it’s going to be fucked for a few weeks regardless who wins, then it will recover.
The whole “priced in” thing is never actually true though. You’re really telling me that the (slim) possibility of a heavily contested election and the resultant civil strife, along with the worsening pandemic and economy are “priced in” with vix sub 40? It hit 82+ in March because of the market crash, which is minor shit compared to a possible civil war/Great Depression part 2.
This is one of the weaker talking points of the right.

Biden is 77.

Trump is 74 and morbidly obese.


If there was a deadpool, I know where I'd put my money.
No it’s just bc most people are too lazy to vote in person lol And now they can send thru Mail
I imagine "godspeed retard" being spoken by a vengeful and very serious Green Goblin-suited William Dafoe
I know that's conventional wisdom, but that's just a media ploy to get people who hate Biden to vote for him thinking they'll get Harris. I guarantee you that old man ain't going anywhere. He spent his whole life trying to be President and he ain't giving it up no matter what.
Political posturing, she’s business as usual for the ruling class. War and Wall Street. So tendies.

wyze cams cost $20 a pop. I can buy 10 of them and monitor every room in my house. I can view the cams on my phone from across the world.  These things are super cheap.
you are getting way ahead of yourself here with all this stuff. telling me all about science etc, yes I get it, science is great etc. but you actually haven't bothered to counter my point about the people behind science. these people are absolute animals. the people who invented nuclear weapons for example and utilized them on people. the consequences of such actions are not even completely realized yet. nukes are not gonna prevent war at all, wars just happen because of the way we are. so now we are really screwed thanks to these people.

>This is pure speculation and as far as I can find completely unsupported. From everything about the squirt-gun function, to air filling the gaps, to blackened and shrunk gland. Specifically cancer generally results in an enlarged prostate, although there are benign causes of this as well.

Ok i read what you linked there. absolutely nothing that was written in those wikipedia paragraphs disproves what i said

prove that its not air that is getting in there. there must be some blood or juice or some shit that immediately gets sucked back into the prostate to fill the significant volume of liquid that leaves it. 

if you cant find something that fills that void then its obviously air

what do you think there is a black hole or wormhole in your prostate or something? its immune to the laws of physics?

There's a chance they're going to beat earnings then tank anyways. Not sure if the market sees it as "overpriced tech" like Paypal or if it sees it like "justifiably expensive value" like Clorox.

Even if you’re vaccinated you’re not meant to take large viral loads. The unvaccinated people are a risk to the population at large not just immunocompromised people. We got rid of polio and mumps by vaccinating the entire population and now they’re making a comeback because of anti vaxxers. If a vaccine has no side effects or minor side effects, I don’t think there’s any issue making people take them if they want to travel or be in populated areas

When I talk politics, it’s all about the money. 

The President doesn’t pass the stimmy, he can decide whatever he wants, but it’s up to Congress to put the money up. Mitch and the GOP already do not agree with the dollar amount the Democrats have proposed. Claimed Democrats are trying to “spend our kids money”. Bullshit aside, Biden wins = Mitch doesn’t pass the stimmy out of spite(I’m betting on this).

Even if Dems wins the Senate, they’re not in power till January. That’s 9 weeks. A lot can happen in the markets over 9 weeks. 

I mentioned this because seems a good deal of Bulls lately have been talking about  a stim pack as if its days away and are pricing the logic into their moves.
I personally believe once the pandemic is "over" there'll be a big jump in the entertainment industry in general. Movies, live performances, events.

If production is on hold, that means Netflix, Amazon, Disney aren't able to produce much content right now either. Netflix subscription prices are going up, Amazon Prime isn't a full membership and Disney isn't able to create as much blockbuster content then the movie studios are currently hoarding and will eventually get distributed through Netflix and Amazon. Don't forget YouTube is killing it right now also. 

Potential return on AMC is worth the gamble to throw a few bucks at it, Cinemark will for sure bounce back.
Wait for news or an event

Don’t know what to make of it but it’s definitely a funny image.

You mean we go back to the horrors of 2017 - its a non issue.

> Or if they pass a financial transaction tax on all securities and derivatives trades?

Highly unlikely NJ already looking to pass some, same with Illinois and firms are evaluating plans to move if something happened there - and though it it will not. Nationwide - unlikely. Not relevant this week's trade.

> The general opinion is if trump wins it’s bullish for markets and if he doesn’t then markets go down.

WSB's opinion is not the opinion of most market participants. The stock market is in for major pain in the next coming years regardless of who is in office - Economists and traders believe a Biden victory would be far more beneficial for the economy and stock market (5-10 yr time frame)

Nonetheless this trade has a window of a week - maybe more if people really get excited and the virus calms down.

Isn’t it funny that it’s not political comments that will get downvoted. It’s political comments that favor trump that will get downvoted. Political statements in favor of Biden get upvoted every single time. So it’s not just “people don’t want politics” here..smh..it’s people don’t want pro trump political comments

Edit: ahh yes, please more downvotes guys. This just reaffirms my position...same hypocrisy the media shoves down everyone’s throats.
My pops is a 25yr fed and his biggest concern is that the budget runs out Dec 1. If Trump loses, he has total right to just not sign the budget. It's so easy for me to believe he would blow up this country over his ego. Puts on literally everything all through December.
well if you'd put your pants on before you left the house, you wouldn't have trouble.

u have a point
> [sources/scientists involved/etc.]

Science is a process, and it's not immune to manipulation. There are even sayings in the field of statistics, to the tune of "if you torture the number enough, they can say almost whatever you want."

But it is _the_ process of iteratively trying to understand our world and arrive at supported conclusions. Definitely if common sense if being refuted (or we can't find any support for it), then the common sense should be re-examined. Common sense should, and does change based on this.

You can look at the progression of any scientific field. [Prior to the work of Francesco Redi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Redi), the common sense was that rotten meat generated maggots as it decayed. This is not true. Without access to egg-laying flies, life does not just spring forth from rotten meat.

[Prior to the work of Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius#Geography,_ethnology,_and_geology), people didn't really know if the Earth was flat or spherical. He not only "proved" that it was spherical (or at least curved), he also calculated the circumference to a pretty good degree of accuracy. Even now there are folks whose common sense tells them the world must be flat.

> common sense is not subjective, its meant to be objective, thats the point of "common sense"

If it is objective, it is science. What differs is rigorously trying to prove (and most importantly disprove) your hypothesis so as to figure out whether your musings are correct. The more you do this, the better your predictions and intuition might get.

> the prostate acts like a squirt gun ...

This is pure speculation and as far as I can find completely unsupported. [From everything about the squirt-gun function, to air filling the gaps, to blackened and shrunk gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate#Function). Specifically cancer generally results in an enlarged prostate, although there are benign causes of this as well.

Otherwise, I'll read more about the 20% study, thanks for pointing out that it might be unsupported by further research (and that the source might be a bit quacky).

> they will collect their salaries, they will do a bunch of stupid stuff and basically nothing will get solved.

If you figure science is some kinda lucrative career, well ... research science is definitely not.

Wall Street thinks the man is unstable and insane.  Biden clearly is a shell of his former self but is a stable adult and that’s all the market needs right now.  A Biden presidency will instill confidence in the market that would never be seen at this point under Trump.  If you’re operating on any other principle you’re clearly not paying attention.

Should I hold my $1000 of SPXS $6 calls 11/20
Well, at least somebody bought my puts a month ago for the same price. Almost earned 100% now. I cant see why volatility would go down leading into election but whether it goes up is always hard to forsee.
God, I cant wait for you americucks to finally be done with this election. You think you're gonna get it done this week or go full idiot like 2000?
You know it decays over time even with constant volatility? So like a 40 VXX in March is probably a 35 VXX now.

Long Calls and Huge Sacks: the WSB Story
Sell it all and put it in options.
its not really hard, its going big uppies but they dont want to pay off a lot of calls, so they went down and up and down again, which murdered basically everyone on wsb. so now we will go up. pretty simple really
it's called volatility
stonks do not only go up they can in fact slowly trend downwards
Let’s be honest, people who are voting for Biden aren’t voting for Biden, there voting to remove Trump...

Sure. But what happens when capital gains taxes go up? Or if they pass a financial transaction tax on all securities and derivatives trades? Every boomer who’s ridden this bull market to its fullest the past 10 years will cash out before the changes go to effect. 

The general opinion is if trump wins it’s bullish for markets and if he doesn’t then markets go down. This is from a valuation and opportunity cost point of view. So you’re banking on the stimulus. If that’s the case might as well go long /GC futures instead of /ES if that’s the primary reason for the trade.
UPS strangles then?
Dude I wonder the same. So many variables. I miss the easy days of the post march recovery. No bad news could bring that shit down.

That’s pretty much elections every time around elections. That’s why I just lock in profits EOD. I expect it to be more like futures of May and June after the Biden gets elected. More stability.

You want a crash now,  so maybe in 3-6 weeks. Or months. 

Stop focusing on a crash that might never come,  start looking for companies that will beat the market over the next year.
You mean bankruptcy king
Honor system. Sure there maybe a few fakes, but the majority are probably near accurate or they would rather decline to state or post something funny.
you know of this thing called adblock?
Biden wins, but close enough for Trump to call it fake, throw a hissy fit, and refuse to deal on stimulus.  Covid keeps rising and one or two states go back into partial shutdown.  Markets panic.


Then Ivanka gently whispers sense into his ear... "It's over daddy time to go home.  Leave on a good note and you can make millions  raging against Biden.... maybe they'll even not try to throw us in jail if we play ball"  


"You're right babe, says Trump, and damn you really are hot."  With his legacy at stake Trump eventually passes a stimulus and fades not so quietly onto the speaker's circuit.


In all seriousness he is going to go apeshit after Biden wins and not want to pass stimmy.  That plus Covid panic why does anyone have calls?  Wait two weeks minimum.
It's pretty much unwatchable outside of a browser with adblock these days

Sounds fucked to me. I'm a cell bio major and even i can't understand the argument for forcing people to be vaccinated. The shut down is to prevent people from being infected, so if every person has the option to be vaccinated against infection where do the restrictions come into play?

If you don't want to get vaccinated, that's your risk. If you die, it's your fault.

Yes it is proven by dental association. Many gum brands have the seal on them.
No give me the flair instead fuck this guy
lil pimp
It's not about the party, it's about the premise.

The reason why stocks rose so spectacularly this summer was because of the historic stimulus that was put forth to distract everyone from the economic impact of Coronavirus (forbearance programs and the Fed saying that they would backstop with 0% aided that). 

Now the markets are falling because speculators are concerned that stimulus won't pass soon. 

So if Trump is re-elected, the stimulus will be passed quickly. The Democrats won't have a reason to wait anymore and Trump won't care. It's not coming from his bank account.

If Biden is elected, you'll have to wait until next year for stimulusm Probably at least February before another stimulus deal, because McConnell will hold it up until he can't anymore. You really think Trump would care at that point? Again it's not his money and his focus will be sourcing as much paper and ink as possible to pardon as many people as possible. 

It's great that people talk about how awesome Democrats are historically with the economy, but it's a special year. Trump and his team has pumped up assets as they have never been pumped up before. Forbearance programs are inflating assets. Pandemic Unemployment Insurance is paying people more to be on unemployment than they were paid when they had a job. Biden cannot possibly spend enough to juice everything more. You would have to spend $3-4 trillion to do that.

What would likely happen is you'll see a reduction in asset prices to some sort of a low and then a steady climb back up as businesses start to turn around. It won't be the rocket ship you saw in April, May, and June.

I remember back in the day when you could at least *kinda* feel good about your position based on futures.

If futures were big green, they usually stayed that way, or at least didn't fall off a cliff.

These days it's like deep red, then deep green, then europe opens and it's deep red, then premarket opens and it's deep green, then the market opens and we fall off a cliff, then it fucking rallies to +2% at 1pm for some reason.

Pro tip, id buy your bullshit a little easier if you didnt try to claim you made 80k in highschool from tutoring of all things.

If that were the case half my friends would be rich as fuck right now. 

Id buy that you left highschool with *maybe* 5-10k, maybe even 15k if you lived in a rich area growing up and just pocketed it all. But no way in fuck you made that obscene amount of money just by tutoring.
Man if you are making 123k a year and your net worth is only 380k your doing something wrong lol no it's satrical but still lol
I like this as a possibility as well.
People are still quarantining? I feel like at this point you’re working from home (means you’re rich or have a cushy job) or if you’re blue collar you’re back on the frontlines as an “essential worker”, basically sent to die so karen and randy can have their fast food

Not to mention ice are better than evs on the top end whereas evs are better off the line. There’s a modified 720s that did the quarter mile in 8.9 which is fast af.
Vaccines will definitely reduce the mortality. More therapeutics will make the people less fearful of virus. Once we reach insignificant number of deaths things will be back to normal. No sane person is counting on Covid-19 to disappear. Its here to stay forever.

Thanks bro! If you’re in long term, like holding between 1-5 years it’s not too late. It’s bound to drop a bit here soon. But I don’t see it going below 28-29 again. It is likely to be over 60 a share next year. 

I was eyeing it at 20 a share last month. Waiting for it to drop below 20, and it never happened. So I bought in at 21, and it shot off into space. It’s a risk, but long term it won’t matter. I’m glad I didn’t wait when it hit 21.

Yeah, but I will say that AP is an american non-profit, and it might legitimately be the most objective news source on earth. It's pretty nutty the lengths they go to to ensure that all of their reporting is neutral. It's just straight up news with no loaded words, angles, or opinions.

Damn you sound triggered, snowflake!
I've been having this debate with friends for MONTHS. Once a vaccine is widely available, does it even matter how many people take it? Is it the govt's role to make people take it? Once it is available and enough time had passed (who knows how long that will be) that everyone who wants a dose could have it, does the govt have any right to restrict commerce or travel based on the disease? Lots of questions made prevalent by the USA's resistance to basic medical science. Fun times ahead!
Just so we can focus on facts, what is the percentage of a population that needs to be infected before herd immunity is reached?

If we get a blue sweep, the democrats are going to print everyone’s calls. 3T will be pumped in the economy within 2 months. Stock market will sky rocket, never mind taxes, Trump tax cuts were only temporary anyway and due to expire soon, there’s no way the republican senate would have allowed an extension and continue running up the deficit after the first relief bill.

I use AP as my #1 news source for written content.

I don't trust reuters *as much* as I used to, as they sold a majority stake to fucking blackstone of all people in 2018. AP is non-profit. So I always go AP over reuters, but I agree reuters still seems fairly legit.

But everyone else basically gets their news from AP/reuters anyway and warps it, so you might as well just go directly to the source.
Too low. Bottom of a move down will likely come in around 3130. If we do close below that, it's straight carnage till 2850 IIRC.

Federal versus state separation of powers. President can tell a state to open up but if a state's governor doesn't then that's the difference.
Buy buy buy !
Nah if Biden wins whole sector might get a bump even if they are a shit company
Getting paid later is always a better option then not getting paid at all. 

Growing up as a teen I heard a story about Trump and Ceasars Palace in Atlantic City. Crap casino was underwater for a long time, but never went into bankruptcy (90s), because the majority of the debt was held by the banks. They never foreclosed on Trump because they would've been left with an eyesore of a property worth waaay less than what they had tied into it. 

Similar to why Hospitals will work out a payment plan instead of sending the bill directly to creditors (make more money, then selling the debt for pennies on the dollar). Similar to why during this shit show of a year, even if there wasn't payment deferral protections for jobless people, banks would be stupid to foreclose on millions of homes, being stuck with all that property to offload for pennies on the dollar. 

Some group recently floated AMC some cash. In order to protect that money they would have to float more cash. I'm sure they have some level where they will call it a wash, but if they are flush with cash, payment put off is better than no payment at all. 

Sometimes it's better to float the debt until better times show up. AMC isn't fucked because of a shitty business model, it's fucked because of a pandemic. If the pandemic was gone tomorrow they would survive again (more debt of course). 

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading this ramble. 

AMC is a gamble at the moment, but honestly it's a gamble that might pay off. I mean SHIT. the premium is dirt cheap for options out to Jan 21 2022. Two years out. It's a gamble, but it's a cheap gamble. Would I pick up more than a handful of 21 Jan 22 5C; probably not. But a small percentage would be worth the pay off. In fact I will pick up a couple those calls for shits and giggles.

As a stat nerd, the number of people who think "pOlls aRe fAke" because of 2016 always cracks me up. 2016-polls only missed by \~4%, that's still extremely accurate historically speaking. And they got the popular vote down to a T.

Good luck bro, but do no more than that. Take time off enjoy it buy something tangible if u have to, so you dont spend it back in robinhood. Make a downpayment,, pay off a car anything other than trying to flip it. That was my problem. Back when I was only 8k deep I made back 6 and had 5 left in my account. All my Bill's paid a year out so I threw it all back in and have been throwing back in more weekly. I can afford to but I wish I hadn't and that feeling of regret hurts more then then wondering the what if plays I could've made since I can only do 200-300 a week.

Best of luck to you man be smart. If you cant be smart hire someone to do it for you /an accountant peace bro

A lot of autists think stocks are gonna rocket.. most likely they will tank
What if Biden wins and right before they switch over Trump sends out planes throughout the United States to spray COVID-19 particles all over the country’s population so that Biden will have to deal with it when he arrives in office?
After the amazing volatility and returns that 🥭 has provided all of us...you guys talk about only caring about the color green...you guys are doing him dirty to turn your back on him now!
I just bought 35 acres in Vermont in Feb. Been a wild transition year but working outside all day + trading stonks is seriously the best of both worlds.
I see a pullback to 26-27 before it rockets again. 40 seems very likely.
I think the market is going green for either victory. fuk u bears
Bookie odds on Biden are way lower than the polls so on paper it looks like a pretty good bet. FiveThirtyEight has 90% chance of Biden win, while current bookie odds are paying the equivalent of 66% chance of Biden win.
Ohhhhh.
I think you just want to define the middle class as rich for some reason. You're not really offering anything to support this middle class being dead thing, poor people not being able to support a family of 5 isn't proof there is no middle class

Up voted you for the shitty mods.
love the enthusiasm
the sources thing doesn't work. people are intellectual animals. they are animals with an intellect. they engage in nuclear warfare with each other and act like barbarians.

doing the science is one thing. but the person doing the science also matters.

the fact that they take this shitty study by alfred kinsey and spread it everywhere speaks volumes about the people behind "science". the rest of his science was shit and this is acknowledged in university. but they still spread the shit anyways. because they are bestial and immature and want to spread a version of the truth that is convenient to their way of life

in a sexual behavior class in university, a very talkative girl spoke out loud in front of like 300 people about her sexual experiences etc. she used it as a hook up vehicle.

sex science stuff is barely academic, highly politicized and generally a waste of time

common sense is not subjective, its meant to be objective, thats the point of "common sense". the prostate acts like a squirt gun. it ejects the ejaculate out of the prostate into the open air. air must then rush in to fill the void, to some extent or another. this irritates the gland. eventually over the years, the inflammation leads to various forms of cell death. the gland blackens and shrinks. then all these old men need surgeries on their prostate due to the cancer that sets in. usually if it sets in twice, they are dead.

you wont find the prostate cancer research center or whatever come out with some study indicating the above. they will collect their salaries, they will do a bunch of stupid stuff and basically nothing will get solved. thats how this works in dumb dumb world

Why would stocks go down with Biden? Look at the charts comparing democratic to republican stock markets. Dems are better for the markets. Taxes will likely go up which takes a chunk out of profits but there will still be a million loopholes so it’ll barely affects stocks.

Actually lower middle class, dudes clearly a loser. 40k to support 5 people pre tax? He's poor I was mistaken, and he's saving too much. Now, there's poor, there's rich, and there's wealthy. If you can afford to have money on hold, you're rich.

Thanks for the detail. I've been asking around but no one can give a good answer; PLAY had a massive spike on announcement that their creditors permitted them to issue later-dated corporate bonds to repay their current bonds and immediate obligations. That was an agreement to modify the existing covenants. I assume it's a win win for all parties involved, but it could also be a sign that the creditors are more nervous of default than the company is of getting defaulted upon. What's to prevent this scenario from playing out with all the other distressed companies of this sector? I could see it happening to cruiselines, but who knows maybe they'll give AMC another year on their maturities. I don't really want half of distressed companies to become zombies, but at the same time it's frustrating to try to devise a play when a debt reprieve or denial amplifies the movement of these already overleveraged stocks.
bet you think anyone who disagrees with you is a radIcaL lEftist

Makes sense, I am retarded.
All these polls showing Biden up by 6 or 7 points don’t let the audience know they’re sampling almost 20% more democrats than republicans. Which makes the propaganda even worse. Take advantage of the situation.
Will we actually know who will be President tomorrow night?
Will the warrants be available if shares are bought on Robinhood?
If you follow twitter there’s several who got the vaccine and confirms they had antibodies afterward . Search “Pfizer antibodies” it’s remarkable

ATH was 3.5mil, now I'm about 2.2 mil after Monday's green day. Haven't sold my FSLY or TSLA stocks, but I did sold my FB to buy some AAPL and PSTH.
I want to say yes... eventually. The start of it's decline when it entered chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 2000s(02 or 03), a year later closed a few hundred stores, laid off 10s of thousands and sold property to stay solvent. 

It survived and thrived enough over the next decade to contemplate purchasing Sears for billions; ended up as  a merged instead and then it started it's decline into it's current subsidiary state. 

\----------------------

It's odd though as going forward given covid I feel like AMC is in a better position (then cruise ships). Much easier to sell a store on land then a billion dollar ship. The thing that is fucking with AMC (as they are open in some areas), is they have no new releases as studios NEED theaters filled to capacity to make up for production cost. All studios are still hesitant to release new films into the theaters until covid passes. 

If AMC wants to survive, it's going to have to come up with some sort of gimmick to constantly keep their 25%/35% max capacity seating full. Old movies wont do it. 

Answer that question and expect a lucrative position within the executive offices at AMC HQ.

> you are making a great assumption in that i limit myself to empirical data instead of common sense

I was thinking we were having a conversation to learn something. Re-phrased this is the equivalent of "feelings over facts." No offense meant, it's just not something that we can properly discuss when our common sense differs.

> in reality jerking off accounts for the rise in prostate cancer. jerking off makes it inflammed

I would want to see sources here. My common sense doesn't agree. There are a number of similar activities that, even if they cause short-term inflammation (e.g. muscles after a workout), are better for you long-term.

> people back in the 1900s didnt jerk off like they do now

Sure. Access to porn was a lot more limited; and there are some studies that showcase the detriments of porn addiction. But you don't have to pop open PornHub every time you jerk off if you're worried about those effects.

> cancer rates have risen, because of plastic etc but also cuz of jerking off

Plastics there's some evidence. A lot of the literature I've read also points to a a large effect of just better testing. I assume (and this is taking a large leap about you) that this resonates with your common sense given the current COVID situation. But it's not automatically an argument that masturbation is correlated with more prostate cancer.

The pandemic is over.
It was a complete nothing burger and we're just going to go herd immunity.
Literally only old people and obese people die, unironically nature doing its job of culling the weakest links of a herd.

Hot take: More people will die as a result of lockdowns due to economic downturn for possibly years to come.

In future when the death rate is so low from a flu like virus we may as well just ignore it and business as usual.
The response was disproportionate and you would could only justify it for something like a ebola pandemic.

Also we aren't really clear on how many deaths are covid deaths as there's been a strong financial and political incentive to claim everything as covid related.
Many of the usual causes of deaths have dropped to unprecedented low levels.
The standard yearly flu for example that kills many people every year has all but vanished mysteriously.
Many such cases.

At that age my life was worth no more than a few zips
lol? are you like 18
My scrotum.
Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tomorrow night. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY posts i see.

Tech is still grossly overvalued, see DOW/SPX out performance today and right now in over night futures. Tech is valued already richly, bread and butter stocks, old school value will get a chance to catch up. Market action will move to COVID/stimulus talks going forward.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY. https://i.imgur.com/1XQZxqF.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode - it may be short term, highly uncertain, but I think clearly negative - and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

If I start 100k make $100k I now have 200k.

Then withdraw $90k. So I have $110k in my acc now.

It will say I’m up 1000% percent when I’m not and it will seem like I turned $10k -> $110k when I didn’t
Oh, so poor.

SP is abbreviated for stock price. 
Let's say you bought SPY 325 puts and SPY goes up to $335 tomorrow at some point. At that time your puts will lose a lot of value because SPY price moved higher. If you think that it will fall from that $335 then you buy some more 325 puts so that your average purchase price of those SPY 325 puts become lower. When SPY falls to let's say $328, your puts will gain value. You might get out with minimal loss/small profit/break even. But if SPY goes up even more after your averaging down then your losses will be even bigger because now you have more positions.
Last time this happened was in 1960 when Nixon got all 5 first votes. He went on to lose the election.

I feel you man. What's shitty about being new traders now is that literally for the last 12 years you could've bought ANY blue chip or tech stock and just made money hand over fist guaranteed. Now we're faced with actual market uncertainty and manipulation and have to be WAAAAY more careful. The whole "stonks only go up" thing isn't even ckose to true anymore. We could be headed for YEARS of dogshit economic performance. At the very least we haven't even begun to pay the price of Covid
UPS wiped me out on er.  I can’t believe how much it fell post er.  Fedex should logically beat earnings and gap up....which is exactly why it probably won’t.   It’s all really in the guidance.
Fuck you smoothbrains see it’s been mooning for 6 weeks and really think it’ll just continue like ups didn’t shit the bed on earnings
I guess saying you want to fuck your daughter doesn’t count huh? Weird.
As a binary statement, "do you want your taxes raised?" is inherently a biased question. Why don't you ask people if they want to pay for the US to murder innocent people?

Raise my taxes, I don't give a fuck. But fund programs that help citizens instead of funding subsidies for horseshit agriculture practices and US imperialism. Maybe if American citizens saw a material return on their taxes instead of it disappearing into an endless void they wouldn't mind it so much.
Could you imagine if the protesters burned the Walmart down on themselves?

FDX up 4% today which makes up half of what they lost last week. They should be over 300 by earnings on 12/17 even if they average +2% a week for the next six weeks. For perspective Over the past six months, the weekly average is +6%. They have been shipping at holiday capicity since shutdown and the next six weeks will be even more. Yes costs will go up, but they will shatter earnings both in December and April.

Short sellers will be forced to cover. Basically investors find out Monday before the bell if this company can make personalized cancer vaccines. So expect a run up as they cover going into data.

They are posting four different abstracts at a conference called SITC and the data is under embargo.

The previous data had complete responses and partial responses in a trail group of only 8 people. Statistically this is wild either by proof it works or sheer dumb luck. Either way noone in their right mind is going to risk data being that good twice. So short sellers will cover. We saw a bit of it today , it will continue all day tomorrow and Wednesday.

Buying shares until IV cool down . Not getting fucked on options lol
Ohhh cool. Now do Joe Biden when he was VP!
If Biden wins tomorrow itl be the first time in US history that they have elected an openly pedophilic man. Such progres
Biden's national poll numbers are fantastic, the margin required of error is just too unlikely for trump to win the electoral college. State level polling is also quite excellent. Early voting is up 100% from 2016, 97 million ballots already counted. Turnout will be record numbers. High turnout is crucial for democratic victories. Democratic voters are highly energized and singularly unified - no matter what astroturfing happens online here and elsewhere.

Senate projections look extremely strong for democrats. 2018 midterm elections were a huge democratic sweep, they outperformed significantly. Why? The entire issue was trump on the ballot. The 2018 House change was the largest change of seats in decades - it was a complete destruction of republicans. In the 2 years since then had trump made ANY inroads with voters? Absolutely not, they hate him even more than they did then. The evidence leads to more likelihood of a blue sweep. Plain and simple - the EVIDENCE - not feelings - points to a massive democratic victory tomorrow. A massive victory completely destroys any chance for trump with legal shenanigans, further, we understand the results likely tomorrow night. It becomes apparent to all and his twitter becomes impotent to anyone that matters. All focus moves to the new Biden administration.

Now that the election has been understood there are the markets...

The market has been negative almost every single day for 2 weeks with worry and uncertainty. Not entirely electoral but nonetheless - there is an enormous amount of hot money waiting to get back in.

If there is a blue sweep in the election, the market is looking for a $2.2T stimulus at minimum - and the expectation is even up to $3-4T. Do you recall what happened last time we spent $3T dollars in printed funds? Stimmy checks flow to people, schools get billions of dollars, kids get a plan to go back to school, free vaccines, states get billions in funds for budgets, confidence will moon. The dollar will tank, and gold will be good - but stocks will finally get a lot of pent up fear crushed. Volatility will get destroyed - RIP all those UVXY posts i see.

Tech is still grossly overvalued, see DOW/SPX out performance today and right now in over night futures. Tech is valued already richly, bread and butter stocks, old school value will get a chance to catch up. Market action will move to COVID/stimulus talks going forward.

Long 5 /ES contracts aka $825k of SPY.
https://i.imgur.com/1XQZxqF.png

This is my analysis, and it can be wrong in a few places but still leave me with a profitable trade. Worst case would be a trump victory, though highly unlikely - if that looks like that might happen, markets will implode and I hope I can exit the position fast enough.

I don't think it's that straightforward. Biden is more stable for the economy because at least he might try to control the pandemic (it's too late to eradicate completely before the vaccine). More stability means less uncertainty and stonks go up.

I was a customer of ADT until about 5 years ago when the system gave a false alarm. When I came home, I found a slip of paper notifying me that they had been there to check out the situation. One small problem: the note was taped to the door leading into my *garage* (which has my apartment number on it as well) and my actual apartment hadn't even been looked at. I cancelled their service next day. 

This was the final incident, but I had had issues with them since day one. When they came in to install the system, their technician drilled a hole in the *wrong wall*, leading me to file an insurance claim against them. Incompetent and unprofessional.

I guess you missed they basically mocked the kind of post you just made, and yours isn't even a parody. I bet that fancy car impresses women more than no car or some clunker off the used car lot. Oh, wait, women aren't into money, they like a guy that's broke. Nevermind. You talk about working for money & not being a consumerist, but getting free rides (oh sorry, full ride) isn't just welfare. Oh wait, if it's a women's scholarship fund it's fine, cause women are disadvantaged cause they are smarter and are better investors than men.  "Most guys are terrible with money," that's not sexist or prejudice.. you learned well at that college. As long as you are bullying the correct group, it's not bullying. If you bully the wrong group, time for censorship. Being educated you'd think you'd understand you can't tar a whole gender as "terrible with money," that's half the population. Next, you can explain statically how good Jewish people are with money, cause that's basically what you just did. I won't even mention that I heard women are bad drivers. Well, it's to be expected I guess since women don't want a nice car.
Not even close. I'm waiting for 3.50- 4$ to sell.

I did some election DD on Florida.

https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article246891077.html

"So far, 66.2% of all registered Florida Democrats have voted, as well as 65.8% of registered Republicans and 51.5% of no-party-affiliated voters."

Not only have they already voted, but the votes are already being counted, which means there is a strong chance Florida will be called by the media before 9pm tomorrow. And because of the way the electoral college works, mango NEEDS Florida in order to win.

This weakens the "Civil unrest" index puts play a little bit. But there could still be some crazy shit happen regardless of how the map looks.

If he wins I’m gonna go long solar and SOYB.
Futures are flat mostly which means volatility is in the corner. Remember we are all FD/options players and volatility is our friend. Don't be a permabull or permabear. be like liquid, adapt and make money. Hedge your positions, keep enough cash/buying power in case you need to DCA. Trend for tomorrow is unknown and that's a good thing. 

Enjoy the trading Christmas, for the last time in this year, tomorrow.

First one was Dixville Notch 5-0 for Biden. Now this. Almost 30 votes down, ready to call it in.
Yea saw that some votes were coming in on the 12th!? This feel crazy in 2020 lol. I hope its just a few votes and not something that can shift the election.

Well, it's essentially binary.

The odds are probably lower than one thinks given that Biden is favored in the polls right now. But what does it matter. If Trump wins, the market is going to moon. Tesla will be at an all time high and tendies will be falling from the sky.
there is no stimulus
I made about fiddy cents trading a penny stock in rich!
Yeah I see a 52 week high of 98 so if he wins the 90 calls should print
Because they're already on Nov 3rd so they already know who's the new president. So they're just acting accordingly.
they have their own internal polling data.
there is no stimulus
Fixed it - sorry boot that. Still captures the volatility of SITC conference
So, Nov 6th then?
No you didnt

Agreed. Biden would need to BLOWOUT Texas or Florida for there to even be a tentative winner this week. And even then, the loser will contest it.

Interesting, but without the variance, min/max values, context of the elections, and bunch of other data points you can't make an informed decision.

6 month CD’s used to give you like 5 percent back in the late 90’s/early 2000’s? Fuck! 😭 No wonder boomers are fucking loaded.
Thnx bby
I had a bunch of contrarian friends that voted Trump in 2016, thinking he would shake shit up.  Every one of them has voted For Biden.  That’s how he loses.  He lost more than he gained in the past 4 years.
All my friends discussing 500$ bets on the election but I got 8k riding on Fds
Show us your taint before ya sell
THE ONLY CIVIL WAR IS GONNA HAPPEN ONLINE. LIKE HOW IT WAS SINCE 2016. PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE.
If the stock market has taught me anything, if everyone thinks something is gonna happen, it won't happen.

I got a bunch of VIX calls, some expiring on Wednesday. Not even sure how to offload them properly. I hope you're right.
Downvote bc you’ll be poor by eod tomorrow
It’s crazy how our outlook on the market changes when we switch from puts to calls and vice versa. I was holding calls this weekend, looking for vaccine news and shit.

SPX broke thru the resistance side of the trend line from 10/3 intraday but closed right at the line yday, therefor I think the likely scenario for tomorrow is a gap up opening over the resistance side to capture prices on the support side/renter previous channel, thus SPY $336 possible which is next resistance, also ydays daily candle was a nice bullish follow thru candle off Friday’s candle, I’m short term bullish > just holding som JD $85c weeklies right now
Upvote if tommorow will be green, downvote if tomorrow will be red, comment if tomorrow will be flat.

It's for science.

EDIT: so far it's about 50/50 at -1 so slanting towards a red day. 1 comment so maybe less than 2% in either direction.  Spy 11/6 255P it is!

EDIT2: It seems like the bulls are pulling it up to +1 so ≤1% green day. SPY 11/6 400C might be the better play. Stay tuned!

EDIT3: Bears coming back with a vengeance, so far -3. SPY 220P on the radar.

EDIT4: Bulls really carrying the vote back up to ±0 but very few comments so high volatility but could be red or green. SPY straddles now the preferred play.

EDIT5: Bears really putting the downward pressure on the economy. -3 and counting, prepare your buttholes for a circuit breaker day. SPY 200P on margin is the new cool.

EDIT6: Comment bois really bringing the salty fire, aggressively flat day inbound. Cash gang or theta gang unite.

The adrenaline rush. But I’m with you man it makes me sick. Even when I’m in the green it’s so hard to let winners run. That’s why I’ve been utilizing lots of spreads. My goal normally is 10% a day.

Or we'll have no clear answer, Biden will be doing well and Trump will declare himself victor with a dozen swing states still counting for a few days.
funfact: The cars share a platform and powertrain and are built by Magna Steyr in the same plant in Graz, Austria. Most of what's hidden under the sheetmetal is the same, but almost everything that's in plain sight is completely different. You can even get the same engine - Toyota sold out to the Germans with the new supra
Yeah even if you don’t believe Trump you can’t deny that Chris Christie, Kellyanne conway, etc were all sick with the rona too. So trump definitely had it too
How is there always one comment like this
No..... now I’m thinking ban you instead
Biden is not even going to win 🙄
Didn't you read? He sold his house and won't have a new one ready for 3-4 months. He *is* homeless
I don’t disagree but this market has a special way of fucking everyone who is ‘sure’ of what will happen next.

Don't forget to take a step back and live in the moment. Meditation isn't just for hippies anymore, even after 8 years it's hard for me to believe how much of an impact 10 minutes of "nothing" each day can have. We live in a time where we have been completely ripped away from our evolutionary settings over a mere 4000 years, all while we destroy our planet at an unprecedented rate. Anxiety and depression are just a sign of the times. The best thing any of us can do is to consult the old gods 🍄

Longterm? Don’t pick stocks. Most companies underperform or go under. Remember how big Sears, Macy’s, and oil companies used to be? Railroads were the thing in like the early 1900’s. We don’t know what’s going to happen in the next 5, 10, 15 years. Even in the absolute worst depressions the SP 500 will make you money through dividends. I personally recommend IVV for its higher yield over VOO and lower expense ratio over SPY.

You are up 210%, at least take your cost basis off the table.

Losing money at this point would be peak retard.

Large catalyst like the elections or earnings for a company are opportunities for the market to make large corrections on a stocks valuation. Even if the event doesn’t have anything to do with the stock or is even beneficial like positive earnings, if the stock is overvalued the catalyst will be used as a correction.
I like your qualifier of ‘this past week’.

I still have no clue how the whole Russia collusion shit just got swept under the rug...like they didn’t try to pedal that bs you years.
honest answer.: specialized security shutters are expensive as hell, average retail couldn't afford them. in fact in most cases, bulletproof or impact resistant glass is cheaper. ply wood is cheap and you can install it quickly without a lot of skill. specialty shutters would require a whole industry of installers ready to go at a moments notice...randomly. not a feasible business unless you are talking retrofitting the garage door style metal doors. but same issues arise.

Check this out- what if Trump wins but Republicans loose both houses. Trump, having no political ideals and very reactionary, could easily get baited to pass the democratic agenda by congress. It's probably the best outcome for democrats because Republicans couldn't say shit. Historically it's likely next pres is dem too. 12 yrs of dem policy.
Terrible, terrible first date idea, as literally everyone here has already said.
